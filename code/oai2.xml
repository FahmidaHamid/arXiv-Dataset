two-dimensional) continua and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.
First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the
low-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame
method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,
fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,
are discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the
theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid
membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a
composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little
similar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances
highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and
availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A
revised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density
approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures
and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical
mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based
on this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial
concepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled
carbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.

edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this
response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory
data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is
believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across
neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively
small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of
sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been
proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the
specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still
largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural
representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism
that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding
algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from
natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.
Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding
results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of
natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding
is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical
competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more
efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.

understood, both empirically and theoretically. We study this distribution
using a version of Fisher's geometrical model without pleiotropy, such that
each mutation affects only a single trait. We are motivated by the notion of an
organism's chemotype, the set of biochemical reaction constants that govern its
molecular constituents. From physical considerations, we expect the chemotype
to be of high dimension and to exhibit very little pleiotropy. Our model
generically predicts striking cusps in the distribution of the fitness effects
of arising and fixed mutations. It further predicts that a single element of
the chemotype should comprise all mutations at the high-fitness ends of these
distributions. Using extreme value theory, we show that the two cusps with the
highest fitnesses are typically well-separated, even when the chemotype
possesses thousands of elements; this suggests a means to observe these cusps
experimentally. More broadly, our work demonstrates that new insights into
evolution can arise from the chemotype perspective, a perspective between the
genotype and the phenotype.

Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can
hold a continuous family of stationary states. We systematically explore how
their neutral stability facilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which
is believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a
perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network
stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump
shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance.
Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be
trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus.

system. This lays the mathematical foundation on which Boolean networks can be
applied to biological regulatory networks in a controlled way.

the earliest gene systems found to undergo both positive and negative control.
The lac operon is known to exhibit bistability, in the sense that the operon is
either induced or uninduced. Many dynamical models have been proposed to
capture this phenomenon. While most are based on complex mathematical
formulations, it has been suggested that for other gene systems network
topology is sufficient to produce the desired dynamical behavior.
  We present a Boolean network as a discrete model for the lac operon. We
include the two main glucose control mechanisms of catabolite repression and
inducer exclusion in the model and show that it exhibits bistability. Further
we present a reduced model which shows that lac mRNA and lactose form the core
of the lac operon, and that this reduced model also exhibits the same dynamics.
This work corroborates the claim that the key to dynamical properties is the
topology of the network and signs of interactions.

epidemic model in which individuals may make infectious contacts in two ways,
both within `households' (which for ease of exposition are assumed to have
equal size) and along the edges of a random graph describing additional social
contacts. Heuristically-motivated branching process approximations are
described, which lead to a threshold parameter for the model and methods for
calculating the probability of a major outbreak, given few initial infectives,
and the expected proportion of the population who are ultimately infected by
such a major outbreak. These approximate results are shown to be exact as the
number of households tends to infinity by proving associated limit theorems.
Moreover, simulation studies indicate that these asymptotic results provide
good approximations for modestly sized finite populations. The extension to
unequal sized households is discussed briefly.

exists a way to select a unique parent of each hybrid vertex resulting in the

general, there may be many other networks M such that Tr(M) = Tr(N). A network
is regular if it is isomorphic with its cover digraph. This paper shows that if
N is regular, there is a procedure to reconstruct N given Tr(N). Hence if N and
M are regular networks and Tr(N) = Tr(M), it follows that N = M, proving that a
regular network is uniquely determined by its displayed trees.

parameter values in systems of ordinary differential equations. A solution to
this problem is proposed for a class of systems of which the unknowns are
allowed to be nonlinearly parameterized functions of state and time.
Reconstruction of state and parameter values is based on the concepts of weakly
attracting sets and non-uniform convergence and is subjected to persistency of
excitation conditions. In absence of nonlinear parametrization the resulting
observers reduce to standard estimation schemes. In this respect, the proposed
method constitutes a generalization of the conventional canonical adaptive
observer design.

derived using only protein interaction network structure should define protein
modules with similar biological roles. We investigate the link between
biological modules and network communities in yeast and its relationship to the
scale at which we probe the network.
  Results: Our results demonstrate that the functional homogeneity of
communities depends on the scale selected, and that almost all proteins lie in
a functionally homogeneous community at some scale. We judge functional
homogeneity using a novel test and three independent characterizations of
protein function, and find a high degree of overlap between these measures. We
show that a high mean clustering coefficient of a community can be used to
identify those that are functionally homogeneous. By tracing the community
membership of a protein through multiple scales we demonstrate how our approach
could be useful to biologists focusing on a particular protein.
  Conclusions: We show that there is no one scale of interest in the community
structure of the yeast protein interaction network, but we can identify the
range of resolution parameters that yield the most functionally coherent
communities, and predict which communities are most likely to be functionally
homogeneous.

nonlinear oscillators. Observable variables are limited to a few components of
state vector and an input signal. The problem of state and parameter
reconstruction is viewed within the classical framework of observer design.
This framework offers computationally-efficient solutions to the problem of
state and parameter reconstruction of a system of nonlinear differential
equations, provided that these equations are in the so-called adaptive observer
canonic form. We show that despite typical neural oscillators being locally
observable they are not in the adaptive canonic observer form. Furthermore, we
show that no parameter-independent diffeomorphism exists such that the original
equations of these models can be transformed into the adaptive canonic observer
form. We demonstrate, however, that for the class of Hindmarsh-Rose and
FitzHugh-Nagumo models, parameter-dependent coordinate transformations can be
used to render these systems into the adaptive observer canonical form. This
allows reconstruction, at least partially and up to a (bi)linear
transformation, of unknown state and parameter values with exponential rate of
convergence. In order to avoid the problem of only partial reconstruction and
to deal with more general nonlinear models in which the unknown parameters
enter the system nonlinearly, we present a new method for state and parameter
reconstruction for these systems. The method combines advantages of standard
Lyapunov-based design with more flexible design and analysis techniques based
on the non-uniform small-gain theorems. Effectiveness of the method is
illustrated with simple numerical examples.

visual cortex uses parts-based representations to encode, store and retrieve
relevant objects. In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of
spatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical
fashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between
the constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed
by previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a
hierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of
parts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process
of self-organization. The process is based on the collaboration of slow
bidirectional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic unit activity regulation,
both running at the top of fast activity dynamics with winner-take-all
character modulated by an oscillatory rhythm. These neural mechanisms lay down
the basis for cooperation and competition between the distributed units and
their synaptic connections. Choosing human face recognition as a test task, we
show that, under the condition of open-ended, unsupervised incremental
learning, the system is able to form memory traces for individual faces in a
parts-based fashion. On a lower memory layer the synaptic structure is
developed to represent local facial features and their interrelations, while
the identities of different persons are captured explicitly on a higher layer.
An additional property of the resulting representations is the sparseness of
both the activity during the recall and the synaptic patterns comprising the
memory traces.

studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves an
inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a
heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern the
stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious disease
outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination of
epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network model are
described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions
are derived from the equations and used for the maximal likelihood estimation
of the topology and parameters. The method is tested with computationally
synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset on SARS outbreak.

between the intracellular membrane potential (V_m) and the local field
potential (V_{LFP}) in cerebral cortex. We first show theoretically that, in
the subthreshold regime, the frequency dependence of the extracellular medium
and that of the membrane potential have a clear incidence on F_T. The
calculation of F_T from experiments and the matching with theoretical
expressions is possible for desynchronized states where individual current
sources can be considered as independent. Using a mean-field approximation, we
obtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without
injecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential)
LFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of V_m and V_{LFP} during
desynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived
F_T matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the
impedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as
1/sqrt(omega) (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This
constitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive,
which has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs.

number dynamics of simple genetic oscillatory systems. Using the
three-component negative feedback transcription regulatory system called the
repressilator as a prototypical example, we quantify the degree of fluctuations
in oscillation periods and amplitudes, as well as the noise propagation along
the regulatory cascade in the stable oscillation regime via dynamic Monte Carlo
simulations. For the single protein-species level, the fluctuation in the
oscillation amplitudes is found to be larger than that of the oscillation
periods, the distributions of which are reasonably described by the Weibull
distribution and the Gaussian tail, respectively. Correlations between
successive periods and between successive amplitudes, respectively, are
measured to assess the noise propagation properties, which are found to decay
faster for the amplitude than for the period. The local fluctuation property is
also studied.

  in review</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The genetic code has been shown to be very error robust compared to randomly
selected codes, but to be significantly less error robust than a certain code
found by a heuristic algorithm. We formulate this optimisation problem as a
Quadratic Assignment Problem and thus verify that the code found by the
heuristic is the global optimum. We also argue that it is strongly misleading
to compare the genetic code only with codes sampled from the fixed block model,
because the real code space is orders of magnitude larger. We thus enlarge the
space from which random codes can be sampled from approximately 2.433 x 10^18
codes to approximately 5.908 x 10^45 codes. We do this by leaving the fixed
block model, and using the wobble rules to formulate the characteristics
acceptable for a genetic code. By relaxing more constraints three larger spaces
are also constructed. Using a modified error function, the genetic code is
found to be more error robust compared to a background of randomly generated
codes with increasing space size. We point out that these results do not
necessarily imply that the code was optimized during evolution for error
minimization, but that other mechanisms could explain this error robustness.

modelling language for the representation and simulation of biological systems
behaviour. It has been designed with the aim of combining the simplicity of
notation of rewrite systems with the advantage of compositionality. It also
allows a rather simple and accurate description of biological membranes and
their interactions with the environment.
  In this work we apply SCLS to model a newly discovered ammonium transporter.
This transporter is believed to play a fundamental role for plant mineral
acquisition, which takes place in the arbuscular mycorrhiza, the most
wide-spread plant-fungus symbiosis on earth. Due to its potential application
in agriculture this kind of symbiosis is one of the main focuses of the BioBITs
project.
  In our experiments the passage of NH3 / NH4+ from the fungus to the plant has
been dissected in known and hypothetical mechanisms; with the model so far we
have been able to simulate the behaviour of the system under different
conditions. Our simulations confirmed some of the latest experimental results
about the LjAMT2;2 transporter. The initial simulation results of the modelling
of the symbiosis process are promising and indicate new directions for
biological investigations.

  and the role of control: empirical statistics and modeling</title><categories>physics.soc-ph physics.data-an q-bio.PE</categories><comments>19figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Background: The pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) is a serious on-going global
public crisis. Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental
importance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies
have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which
strongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social
contacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.
  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of
confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's
law and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a
hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to
countries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control
effects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the
need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the
impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the
model and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical
spreading properties observed in empirical data.
  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although
strict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in
the regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention
after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the
largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the
spreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic
mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some
practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.

  NP-hard</title><categories>q-bio.PE cs.CC</categories><comments>13 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The celebrated Kermack-McKendric model of epidemics studies the transmission
of a disease in a population where each individual is initially susceptible
(S), may become infective (I) and then removed or recovered (R) and plays no
further epidemiological role. This ODE model arises as the limiting case of a
network model where each individual has an equal chance of infecting every
other. More recent work gives explicit consideration to the network of social
interaction and attendant probability of transmission for each interacting
pair. The state of such a network is an assignment of the values {S,I,R} to its
members. Given such a network, an initial state and a particular susceptible
individual, we would like to compute their probability of becoming infected in
the course of an epidemic. It turns out that this problem is NP-hard. In
particular, it belongs in a class of problems all of whose known solutions
require an exponential amount of computation and for which it is unlikely that
there will be more efficient solutions.

superhydrophobic surfaces that lead to various novel behaviors [1-5]. These
observations have inspired attempts to create artificial superhydrophobic
surfaces, given such surfaces have multitudinous applications [6-13].
Superhydrophobicity is an enhanced effect of surface roughness and there are
known relationships that correlate surface roughness and superhydrophobicity,
based on the underlying physics. However, while these recognize the level of
roughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale. Thus,
they are not capable of explaining why naturally occurring such surfaces
commonly have micron-submicron sizes. Here we report on the discovery of a new
relation, its physical basis and its experimental verification. The results
reveal that scaling-down roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique
and elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity but also to
increase its stability against environmental disturbances. This new relation
takes into account the previously overlooked but key fact that the accumulated
line energy arising from the numerous solid-water-air intersections that can be
distributed in the apparent contact area when air packets are trapped at small
scales on the surface can dramatically increase as the roughness scale shrinks.
This term can in fact become the dominant contributor to the surface energy and
so becomes crucial for accomplishing superhydrophobicity. These findings guide
fabrication of stable super water-repellant surfaces.

Submitted to ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions of
microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod models have
emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these
deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based description of
microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows
from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle
derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and
so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a
natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure
simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we
present a two-step inverse method for estimating the constitutive law using rod
theory and data generated from discrete-structure simulations. We illustrate
the method on a filament with an artificial and simplistic discrete-structure.
We simulate its deformation in response to a prescribed loading using a
multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. Using data generated from the MBD solver, we
first estimate the curvature of the filament and subsequently use it in the
two-step method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between
the restoring moment and curvature. Finally, we also illustrate how the
estimated constitutive law can be tested under independent loading conditions.

response to a strong sustained input stimulus, often supported by protein
activity-dependent inactivation. Adaptive response is thought to be related to
various cellular functions such as homeostasis and enlargement of dynamic range
by background compensation. Here we study the quantitative relation between
adaptive response and background compensation within a modeling framework. We
show that any particular type of adaptive response is neither sufficient nor
necessary for adaptive enlargement of dynamic range. In particular a precise
adaptive response, where system activity is maintained at a constant level at
steady state, does not ensure a large dynamic range neither in input signal nor
in system output. A general mechanism for input dynamic range enlargement can
come about from the activity-dependent modulation of protein responsiveness by
multiple biochemical modification, regardless of the type of adaptive response
it induces. Therefore hierarchical biochemical processes such as methylation
and phosphorylation are natural candidates to induce this property in signaling
systems.

cancer. High-density and highthroughput peptide arrays are being extensively
used to detect tumor biomarkers, examine kinase activity, identify antibodies
having low serum titers and locate antibody signatures. Improving the yield of
microarray fabrication involves solving a hard combinatorial optimization
problem called the Border Length Minimization Problem (BLMP). An important
question that remained open for the past seven years is if the BLMP is
tractable or not. We settle this open problem by proving that the BLMP is
NP-hard. We also present a hierarchical refinement algorithm which can refine
any heuristic solution for the BLMP problem. We also prove that the
TSP+1-threading heuristic is an O(N)- approximation. The hierarchical
refinement solver is available as an opensource code at

increasing de-correlated. This finding is related to ecosystem evolution. The
systems level dynamics of the model is subordinated to intermittent transitions
between meta-stable states. We improve on previous studies of the statistics of
the transition times and show that the fluctuations in the offspring
probability decreases with number of transitions. The longtime adaptation, as
seen by an increasing population size is demonstrated to be related to the
convexity of the offspring probability. We explain how the models behaviour is
a mathematical reflection of Darwin's concept of adaptation of profitable
variations.

nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide have been developed by task forces of the
European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society. These
recommendations have paved the way for the measurement of nitric oxide to
become a diagnostic tool for specific clinical applications. It would be
desirable to develop similar guidelines for the sampling of other trace gases
in exhaled breath, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which reflect
ongoing metabolism. The concentrations of water-soluble, blood-borne substances
in exhaled breath are influenced by: (i) breathing patterns affecting gas
exchange in the conducting airways; (ii) the concentrations in the
tracheo-bronchial lining fluid; (iii) the alveolar and systemic concentrations
of the compound. The classical Farhi equation takes only the alveolar
concentrations into account. Real-time measurements of acetone in end-tidal
breath under an ergometer challenge show characteristics which cannot be
explained within the Farhi setting. Here we develop a compartment model that
reliably captures these profiles and is capable of relating breath to the
systemic concentrations of acetone. By comparison with experimental data it is
inferred that the major part of variability in breath acetone concentrations
(e.g., in response to moderate exercise or altered breathing patterns) can be
attributed to airway gas exchange, with minimal changes of the underlying blood
and tissue concentrations. Moreover, it is deduced that measured end-tidal
breath concentrations of acetone determined during resting conditions and free
breathing will be rather poor indicators for endogenous levels. Particularly,
the current formulation includes the classical Farhi and the Scheid series
inhomogeneity model as special limiting cases.

of each edge denotes the energy flux between two species. By investigating 21
empirical weighted food webs as energy flow networks, we found several
ubiquitous scaling behaviors. Two random variables $A_i$ and $C_i$ defined for
each vertex $i$, representing the total flux (also called vertex intensity) and
total indirect effect or energy store of $i$, were found to follow power law
distributions with the exponents $\alpha\approx 1.32$ and $\beta\approx 1.33$,
respectively. Another scaling behavior is the power law relationship, $C_i\sim
A_i^\eta$, where $\eta\approx 1.02$. This is known as the allometric scaling
power law relationship because $A_i$ can be treated as metabolism and $C_i$ as
the body mass of the sub-network rooted from the vertex $i$, according to the
algorithm presented in this paper. Finally, a simple relationship among these
power law exponents, $\eta=(\alpha-1)/(\beta-1)$, was mathematically derived
and tested by the empirical food webs.

oscillations (MMOs) consisting of periods of small amplitude oscillations
interspersed with spikes. Various models with different underlying mechanisms
have been proposed to generate this type of behavior. Stochastic versions of
these models can produce similarly looking time series, often with noise-driven
mechanisms different from those of the deterministic models. We present a suite
of measures which, when applied to the time series, serves to distinguish
models and classify routes to producing MMOs, such as noise-induced
oscillations or delay bifurcation. By focusing on the subthreshold
oscillations, we analyze the interspike interval density, trends in the
amplitude and a coherence measure. We develop these measures on a biophysical
model for stellate cells and a phenomenological FitzHugh-Nagumo-type model and
apply them on related models. The analysis highlights the influence of model
parameters and reset and return mechanisms in the context of a novel approach
using noise level to distinguish model types and MMO mechanisms. Ultimately, we
indicate how the suite of measures can be applied to experimental time series
to reveal the underlying dynamical structure, while exploiting either the
intrinsic noise of the system or tunable extrinsic noise.

is still debated, and is an important issue for correctly modeling
extracellular potentials. Here, we first show theoretically that if the medium
is resistive, the frequency scaling should be the same for electroencephalogram
(EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) signals at low frequencies (&lt;10 Hz). To
test this prediction, we analyzed the spectrum of simultaneous EEG and MEG
measurements in four human subjects. The frequency scaling of EEG displays
coherent variations across the brain, in general between 1/f and 1/f^2, and
tends to be smaller in parietal/temporal regions. In a given region, although
the variability of the frequency scaling exponent was higher for MEG compared
to EEG, both signals consistently scale with a different exponent. In some
cases, the scaling was similar, but only when the signal-to-noise ratio of the
MEG was low. Several methods of noise correction for environmental and
instrumental noise were tested, and they all increased the difference between
EEG and MEG scaling. In conclusion, there is a significant difference in
frequency scaling between EEG and MEG, which can be explained if the
extracellular medium (including other layers such as dura matter and skull) is
globally non-resistive.

a popular transition between tree topologies known as subtree
pruning-and-regrafting (SPR). We analyze the Markov chain in the simpler
setting that the generating tree consists of very short edge lengths, short
enough so that each sample from the generating tree (or character in
phylogenetic terminology) is likely to have only one mutation, and that there
enough samples so that the data looks like the generating distribution. We
prove in this setting that the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, i.e., it quickly
converges to its stationary distribution, which is the posterior distribution
over tree topologies. Our proofs use that the leading term of the maximum
likelihood function of a tree T is the maximum parsimony score, which is the
size of the minimum cut in T needed to realize single edge cuts of the
generating tree. Our main contribution is a combinatorial proof that in our
simplified setting, SPR moves are guaranteed to converge quickly to the maximum
parsimony tree. Our results are in contrast to recent works showing examples
with heterogeneous data (namely, the data is generated from a mixture
distribution) where many natural Markov chains are exponentially slow to
converge to the stationary distribution.

describes the three-stage dynamics and the two time scales observed in HIV
infection. Assuming that the virus has high mutation and rapid reproduction
rates that stress the immune system throughout the successive activation of new
responses to new undetectable strains, the delay term describes the time
interval necessary to mount new specific immune responses. This single term
increases the number of possible solutions and changes the phase space dynamics
if compared to the model without time delay. We observe very slow transits near
the unstable fixed point, corresponding to a healthy state, and long time decay
to the stable fixed point that corresponds to the infected state. In contrast
to the results obtained for models using regular ODE, which only allow for
partial descriptions of the course of the infection, our model describes the
entire course of infection observed in infected patients: the primary
infection, the latency period and the onset of acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). The model also describes other scenarios, such as the very
fast progression to the disease and the less common outcome in which, although
the patient is exposed to HIV, he/she does not develop the disease.

expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. They are known to
play an important role in several biological processes and, together with
transcription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory
network. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a
few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary
regulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the
microRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor
regulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this
paper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version
of this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an
efficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall
gene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream
regulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is
that the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression
of the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected
fine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the
actual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their
targets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the
cross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the
microRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a
larger network of regulations.

method to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree from an alignment of molecular data.
In 2000, Pauplin showed that the BME method is equivalent to optimizing a
linear functional over the BME polytope, the convex hull of the BME vectors
obtained from Pauplin's formula applied to all binary trees. The BME method is
related to the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm, now known to be a greedy
optimization of the BME principle. Further, the NJ and BME algorithms have been
studied previously to understand when the NJ Algorithm returns a BME tree for
small numbers of taxa. In this paper we aim to elucidate the structure of the
BME polytope and strengthen knowledge of the connection between the BME method
and NJ Algorithm. We first prove that any subtree-prune-regraft move from a
binary tree to another binary tree corresponds to an edge of the BME polytope.
Moreover, we describe an entire family of faces parametrized by disjoint
clades. We show that these {\em clade-faces} are smaller dimensional BME
polytopes themselves. Finally, we show that for any order of joining nodes to
form a tree, there exists an associated distance matrix (i.e., dissimilarity
map) for which the NJ Algorithm returns the BME tree. More strongly, we show
that the BME cone and every NJ cone associated to a tree $T$ have an
intersection of positive measure.

scaling, trait-based modelling, and physiologically structured modelling to
provide a novel and ecologically relevant tool for size-structured food webs.
The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and
life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population
structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by
the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species
independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation.
Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities
as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be
reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and
the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation:
community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model
may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a
power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the
results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions
of the full model on 1) biomass distribution as a function of individual size,
2) biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and 3) relation
between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model
additionally predicts the diversity distribution as a function of size at
maturation.

transport the energy into a target molecule, the reaction center, placed in the

important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport
efficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any
initial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and
when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last
situation by using stochastic Schr{\&quot;o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and
non-Markovian type of interactions.

noise. The presence of noise limits the precision of neural responses and
impacts the quality of neural signal transduction. We assess the signal
transduction quality in relation to the level of noise, and show it to be
maximized by a non-zero level of noise, analogous to the stochastic resonance
effect. The quality enhancement occurs for a finite range of stimuli to a
single neuron; we show how to construct networks of neurons that extend the
range. The range increases more rapidly with network size when we make use of
heterogeneous populations of neurons with a variety of thresholds, rather than
homogeneous populations of neurons all with the same threshold. The limited
precision of neural responses thus can have a direct effect on the optimal
network structure, with diverse functional properties of the constituent
neurons supporting an economical information processing strategy that reduces
the metabolic costs of handling a broad class of stimuli.

systems, forming a functional barrier for cells and organelles from the
surrounding environment. The lipid molecules that form membranes contain both
permanent and induced dipoles, and an electric field can induce the formation
of pores when the transverse field is sufficiently strong (electroporation).
Here, a phenomenological free energy is constructed to model the response of a
BLM to a transverse static electric field. The model contains a continuum
description of the membrane dipoles and a coupling between the headgroup
dipoles and the membrane tilt. The membrane is found to become unstable through
buckling modes, which are weakly coupled to thickness fluctuations in the
membrane. The thickness fluctuations, along with the increase in interfacial
area produced by membrane buckling, increase the probability of localized
membrane breakdown, which may lead to pore formation. The instability is found
to depend strongly on the strength of the coupling between the dipolar
headgroups and the membrane tilt as well as the degree of dipolar ordering in
the membrane.

However, many biological and ecological systems operate far from thermal
equilibrium. Here we show that entropy production can characterize the behavior
of such nonequilibrium systems. To this end we calculate the entropy production
for a population model that displays nonequilibrium behavior resulting from
cyclic competition. At a critical point the dynamics exhibits a transition from
large, limit-cycle like oscillations to small, erratic oscillations. We show
that the entropy production peaks very close to the critical point and tends to
zero upon deviating from it. We further provide analytical methods for
computing the entropy production which agree excellently with numerical
simulations.

unaided eye. The plasmodium's foraging behaviour is interpreted in terms of
computation. Input data is a configuration of nutrients, result of computation
is a network of plasmodium's cytoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients.
Tsuda et al (2004) experimentally demonstrated that basic logical gates can be
implemented in foraging behaviour of the plasmodium. We simplify the original
designs of the gates and show --- in computer models --- that the plasmodium is
capable for computation of two-input two-output gate $&lt;x, y&gt; \to &lt;xy, x+y&gt;$ and
three-input two-output $&lt;x, y, z&gt; \to &lt; \bar{x}yz, x+y+z&gt;$. We assemble the
gates in a binary one-bit adder and demonstrate validity of the design using
computer simulation.

noise in biochemical and genetic networks arising from the finite copy number
of the participating species. That is, rather than modeling regulatory networks
in terms of the deterministic dynamics of concentrations, we model the dynamics
of the probability of a given copy number of the reactants in single cells.
Most of the modeling activity of the last decade has centered on stochastic
simulation of individual realizations, i.e., Monte-Carlo methods for generating
stochastic time series. Here we review the mathematical description in terms of
probability distributions, introducing the relevant derivations and
illustrating several cases for which analytic progress can be made either
instead of or before turning to numerical computation.

adapts to a large environmental change. In particular, genomic surveys indicate
that, following the transition to an obligate, host-dependent symbiont, the
density of transposons first rises, then subsequently declines over
evolutionary time. Here, we show that these observations can be accounted for
by a class of generic stochastic models for the evolution of genomes in the
presence of continuous selection and gene duplication. The models use a fitness
function that allows for partial contributions from multiple gene copies, is an
increasing but bounded function of copy number, and is optimal for one fully
adapted gene copy. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the dynamics
result in an initial rise in gene copy number followed by a subsequent fall due
to adaptation to the new environmental parameters. These results are robust for
reasonable gene duplication and mutation parameters when adapting to a novel
target sequence. Our model provides a generic explanation for the dynamics of
microbial transposon density following a large environmental changes such as
host restriction.

that is known to act as a potassium channel blocker, is investigated with the
aid of quantum mechanical calculations. The dipole moment vector (145 D) of
ChTX can be stirred by the full length KcsA potassium channel's macrodipole
(403 D) thereby assuming the proper orientation before binding the ion channel
on the cell surface. The localization of the frontier orbitals of ChTX has been
revealed for the first time. HOMO is localized on Trp14 while the three
lowest-energy MOs (LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2) are localized on the three
disulfide bonds that characterize this pepetide. An effective way to engineer
the HOMO-LUMO (H-L) gap of ChTX is that of replacing its Trp14 residue with
Ala14 whereas deletion of the LUMO-associated disulfide bond with the insertion
of a pair of L-alpha-aminobutyric acid residues does not affect the H-L energy
gap.

among individuals and taxa. Often of interest is a much simpler network, for
example, a species tree T, that summarizes the most fundamental relationships.
The meaning of a species tree is made more complicated by the recent discovery
of the importance of hybridizations and lateral gene transfers. Hence it is
desirable to describe uniform well-defined procedures that yield a tree given a
network N. A useful tool toward this end is a connected surjective digraph
(CSD) map f from N to N' where N' is generally a much simpler network than N. A
set W of vertices in N is &quot;restricted&quot; if there is at most one vertex from
which there is an arc into W, thus yielding a bottleneck in N. A CSD map f from
N to N' is &quot;restricted&quot; if the inverse image of each vertex in N' is restricted
in N. This paper describes a uniform procedure that, given a network N, yields
a well-defined tree called the &quot;restricted tree&quot; of N. There is a restricted
CSD map from N to the restricted tree. Many relationships in the tree can be
proved to appear also in N.

et al., 2009) for which we are able to map out all assembly pathways generated
by external invasions in an exact manner. In this paper we provide a deeper
analysis of the model, obtaining analytical results and introducing some
approximations which allow us to reconstruct the results of our previous work.
In particular, we show that the population dynamics equations of a very general
class of trophic-level structured food-web have an unique interior equilibrium
point which is globally stable. We show analytically that communities found as
end states of the assembly process are pyramidal and we find that the
equilibrium abundance of any species at any trophic level is approximately
inversely proportional to the number of species in that level. We also find
that the per capita growth rate of a top predator invading a resident community
is key to understand the appearance of complex end states reported in our
previous work. The sign of these rates allows us to separate regions in the
space of parameters where the end state is either a single community or a
complex set containing more than one community. We have also built up
analytical approximations to the time evolution of species abundances that
allow us to determine, with high accuracy, the sequence of extinctions that an
invasion may cause. Finally we apply this analysis to obtain the communities in
the end states. To test the accuracy of the transition probability matrix
generated by this analytical procedure for the end states, we have compared
averages over those sets with those obtained from the graph derived by
numerical integration of the Lotka-Volterra equations. The agreement is
excellent.

developed a full analytical treatment of the model of species assembly
introduced in Capitan et al. (2009). This model is based on the construction of
an assembly graph containing all viable configurations of the community, and
the definition of a Markov chain whose transitions are the transformations of
communities by new species invasions. In the present paper we provide an
exhaustive numerical analysis of the model, describing the average time to the
recurrent state, the statistics of avalanches, and the dependence of the
results on the amount of available resource. Our results are based on the fact
that the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the
recurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well
as the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact
manner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be
comparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in
units of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a
fluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers
without ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is
dominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small
extinction avalanches. Through the assembly process, communities become less
resilient (e.g., have a higher return time to equilibrium) but become more
robust in terms of resistance against new invasions.

changes. These shifts are theoretically understood as a regime switch between
alternative stable states of the ecosystem dynamical response to smooth changes
in external conditions. Usual models introduce nonlinearities in the
macroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different stable attractors
among which the shift takes place. Here we propose an alternative explanation
of catastrophic regime shifts based on a recent model that pictures ecological
communities as systems in continuous fluctuation, according to certain
transition probabilities, between different micro-states in the phase space of
viable communities. We introduce a spontaneous extinction rate that accounts
for gradual changes in external conditions, and upon variations on this control
parameter the system undergoes a regime shift with similar features to those
previously reported. Under our microscopic viewpoint we recover the main
results obtained in previous theoretical and empirical work (anomalous
variance, hysteresis cycles, trophic cascades). The model predicts a gradual
loss of species in trophic levels from bottom to top near the transition. But
more importantly, the spectral analysis of the transition probability matrix
allows us to rigorously establish that we are observing the fingerprints, in a
finite size system, of a true phase transition driven by background
extinctions.

memories quickly. Using a standard firing rate model of recurrent networks, we
develop a theory of flexible memory networks. Our main results characterize
networks having the maximal number of flexible memory patterns, given a
constraint graph on the network's connectivity matrix. Modulo a mild
topological condition, we find a close connection between maximally flexible
networks and rank 1 matrices. The topological condition is H_1(X;Z)=0, where X
is the clique complex associated to the network's constraint graph; this
condition is generically satisfied for large random networks that are not
overly sparse. In order to prove our main results, we develop some
matrix-theoretic tools and present them in a self-contained section independent
of the neuroscience context.

noise, can induce novel phenotypes. If an induced phenotype confers a fitness
advantage, selection may promote its genetic stabilization. Non-genetic
perturbations can thus initiate evolutionary innovation. Genetic variation that
is not usually phenotypically visible may play an important role in this
process. Populations under stabilizing selection on a phenotype that is robust
to mutations can accumulate such variation. After non-genetic perturbations,
this variation can become a source of new phenotypes. We here study the
relationship between a phenotype's robustness to mutations and a population's
potential to generate novel phenotypic variation. To this end, we use a
well-studied model of transcriptional regulation circuits. Such circuits are
important in many evolutionary innovations. We find that phenotypic robustness
promotes phenotypic variability in response to non-genetic perturbations, but
not in response to mutation. Our work suggests that non-genetic perturbations
may initiate innovation more frequently in mutationally robust gene expression
traits.

model closely related to the discrete time stochastic BES-model. The discrete
time BES-model is underlying current attempts to simulate cortical development,
but is difficult to analyze. The new continuous time formulation facilitates
analytical treatment thus allowing us to examine the structure of the model
more closely. We derive explicit expressions for the time dependent
probabilities p(\gamma, t) for finding a tree \gamma at time t, valid for
arbitrary continuous time branching models with tree and segment dependent
branching rates. We show, for the specific case of the continuous time
BES-model, that as expected from our model formulation, the sums needed to
evaluate expectation values of functions of the terminal segment number
\mu(f(n),t) do not depend on the distribution of the total branching
probability over the terminal segments. In addition, we derive a system of
differential equations for the probabilities p(n,t) of finding n terminal
segments at time t. For the continuous BES-model, this system of differential
equations gives direct numerical access to functions only depending on the
number of terminal segments, and we use this to evaluate the development of the
mean and standard deviation of the number of terminal segments at a time t. For
comparison we discuss two cases where mean and variance of the number of
terminal segments are exactly solvable. Then we discuss the numerical
evaluation of the S-dependence of the solutions for the continuous time
BES-model. The numerical results show clearly that higher S values, i.e. values
such that more proximal terminal segments have higher branching rates than more
distal terminal segments, lead to more symmetrical trees as measured by three
tree symmetry indicators.

transition into a state with a supercoiled structure known as a plectoneme.
Using transition state theory, we predict the rate of this plectoneme
nucleation to be of order 10^4 Hz. We reconcile this with experiments that have
measured hopping rates of order 10 Hz by noting that the viscosity of the bead
used to manipulate the DNA limits the measured rate. We find that the intrinsic
bending caused by disorder in the base-pair sequence is important for
understanding the free energy barrier that governs the transition. Both
analytic and numerical methods are used in the calculations. We provide
extensive details on the numerical methods for simulating the elastic rod model
with and without disorder.

interspecies interaction. Here, we include intraspecific competition to the
Lotka-Volterra model and solve it analytically. Despite being simple and
thoroughly studied, this model presents a very rich behavior and some
characteristics not so well explored, which are unveiled. The forbidden region
in the mutualism regime and the dependence on initial conditions in the
competition regime are some examples of these characteristics. From the
stability of the steady state solutions, three phases are obtained: (i)
extinction of one species (Gause transition), (ii) their coexistence and (iii)
a forbidden region. Full analytical solutions have been obtained for the
considered ecological regimes. The time transient allows one to defined time
scales for the system evolution, which can be relevant for the study of tumor
growth by theoretical or computer simulation models.

probability distributions lo- calised in an exponentially small area of the
parameter space. The algorithm provides both posterior samples and an estimate
of the evidence (marginal likelihood) of the model. The nested sampling algo-
rithm also provides an efficient way to calculate free energies and the
expectation value of thermodynamic observables at any temperature, through a
simple post-processing of the output. Previous applications of the algorithm
have yielded large efficiency gains over other sampling techniques, including
parallel tempering (replica exchange). In this paper we describe a parallel
implementation of the nested sampling algorithm and its application to the
problem of protein folding in a Go-type force field of empirical potentials
that were designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in
room-temperature simulations. We demonstrate the method by conducting folding
simulations on a number of small proteins which are commonly used for testing
protein folding procedures: protein G, the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase
and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. A topological analysis of the posterior samples
is performed to produce energy landscape charts, which give a high level
description of the potential energy surface for the protein folding
simulations. These charts provide qualitative insights into both the folding
process and the nature of the model and force field used.

mechanism are utilized in many areas of science. However, many such models
suffer from the defect of requiring fine tuning of parameters or an unrealistic
separation of scales in the diffusivities of the constituents of the system in
order to predict the formation of spatial patterns. In the context of a very
generic model of ecological pattern formation, we show that the inclusion of
intrinsic noise in Turing models leads to the formation of &quot;quasi-patterns&quot;
that form in generic regions of parameter space and are experimentally
distinguishable from standard Turing patterns. The existence of quasi-patterns
removes the need for unphysical fine tuning or separation of scales in the
application of Turing models to real systems.

studies of evolution. We propose a generalized Bak-Sneppen model and provide a
natural mechanism which accounts for both phenomena simultaneously. We use the
prisoner's dilemma games to mimic the interactions among the members of the
population. Each member is identified by its cooperation probability, and its
fitness is given by the payoffs from neighbors. The least fit member with the
minimum payoff is replaced by a new member with a random cooperation
probability. When the neighbors of the least fit member are also replaced with
a non-zero probability, a strong cooperation emerges. The Bak-Sneppen process
builds a self-organized structure so that the cooperation can emerge even in
the parameter region where a uniform or random population decreases the number
of cooperators. The emergence of cooperation is due to the same dynamical
correlation which leads to self-organized criticality in replacement
activities.

open ionic channels can be predicted by understanding electrodiffusion in fixed
structures, without invoking conformation changes, or changes in chemical
bonds. We know, of course, that ions can bind to specific protein structures,
and that this binding is not easily described by the traditional electrostatic
equations of physics textbooks, that describe average electric fields, the
so-called `mean field'. The question is which specific properties can be
explained just by mean field electrostatics and which cannot. I believe the
best way to uncover the specific chemical properties of channels is to invoke
them as little as possible, seeking to explain with mean field electrostatics
first. Then, when phenomena appear that cannot be described that way, by the
mean field alone, we turn to chemically specific explanations, seeking the
appropriate tools (of electrochemistry, Langevin, or molecular dynamics, for
example) to understand them. In this spirit, we turn now to the structure of
open ionic channels, apply the laws of electrodiffusion to them, and see how
many of their properties we can predict just that way.

new cluster-scaling method and the well known spectral methods. It is shown, in
particular, that the nucleotide sequences in DNA molecules have robust
cluster-scaling properties. These properties are relevant to both types of
nucleotide pair-bases interactions: hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions.
It is shown that taking into account the cluster-scaling properties can help to
improve heterogeneous models of the DNA dynamics. It is also shown that a
chaotic (deterministic) order, rather than a stochastic randomness, controls
the energy minima positions of the stacking interactions in the DNA sequences
on large scales. The chaotic order results in a large-scale chaotic coherence
between the two complimentary DNA-duplex's sequences. A competition between
this broad-band chaotic coherence and the resonance coherence produced by
genetic code has been briefly discussed. The Arabidopsis plant genome (which is
a model plant for genome analysis) and two human genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, have
been considered as examples.

structured in time spike trains. During further processing in higher areas,
information is subjected to a certain condensation process, which results in
formation of abstract conceptual images of external world, apparently,
represented as certain uniform spiking activity partially independent on the
input spike trains details. Possible physical mechanism of condensation at the
level of individual neuron was discussed recently. In a reverberating spiking
neural network, due to this mechanism the dynamics should settle down to the
same uniform/periodic activity in response to a set of various inputs. Since
the same periodic activity may correspond to different input spike trains, we
interpret this as possible candidate for information condensation mechanism in
a network. Our purpose is to test this possibility in a network model
consisting of five fully connected neurons, particularly, the influence of
geometric size of the network, on its ability to condense information. Dynamics
of 20 spiking neural networks of different geometric sizes are modelled by
means of computer simulation. Each network was propelled into reverberating
dynamics by applying various initial input spike trains. We run the dynamics
until it becomes periodic. The Shannon's formula is used to calculate the
amount of information in any input spike train and in any periodic state found.
As a result, we obtain explicit estimate of the degree of information
condensation in the networks, and conclude that it depends strongly on the
net's geometric size.

models, such as probabilistic Boolean networks, logical models, Petri nets, and
agent-based models, with the goal to gain a better understanding of the system.
The computational complexity to analyze the complete dynamics of these models
grows exponentially in the number of variables, which impedes working with
complex models. Although there exist sophisticated algorithms to determine the
dynamics of discrete models, their implementations usually require
labor-intensive formatting of the model formulation, and they are oftentimes
not accessible to users without programming skills. Efficient analysis methods
are needed that are accessible to modelers and easy to use. Method: By
converting discrete models into algebraic models, tools from computational
algebra can be used to analyze their dynamics. Specifically, we propose a
method to identify attractors of a discrete model that is equivalent to solving
a system of polynomial equations, a long-studied problem in computer algebra.
Results: A method for efficiently identifying attractors, and the web-based
tool Analysis of Dynamic Algebraic Models (ADAM), which provides this and other
analysis methods for discrete models. ADAM converts several discrete model
types automatically into polynomial dynamical systems and analyzes their
dynamics using tools from computer algebra. Based on extensive experimentation
with both discrete models arising in systems biology and randomly generated
networks, we found that the algebraic algorithms presented in this manuscript
are fast for systems with the structure maintained by most biological systems,
namely sparseness, i.e., while the number of nodes in a biological network may
be quite large, each node is affected only by a small number of other nodes,
and robustness, i.e., small number of attractors.

dynamics on lattice. This non-Brownian diffusion is characterised by a random
walk with a finite persistence length between changes of direction, and is
inspired by the motion of bacteria such as E. coli. By defining a class of
models with multiple species of particle and transmutation between species we
can recreate such dynamics. These models admit exact analytical results whilst
also forming a counterpart to previous continuum models of run and tumble
dynamics. We solve the externally driven non-interacting and zero-range
versions of the model exactly and utilise a field theoretic approach to derive
the continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics for more general interactions. We make
contact with prior approaches to run and tumble dynamics off lattice and
determine the steady state and linear stability for a class of crowding
interactions, where the jump rate decreases as density increases. In addition
to its interest from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics,
this lattice model constitutes and efficient tool to simulate a class of
interacting run and tumble models relevant to bacterial motion, so long as
certain conditions (that we derive) are met.

orders of the extant species and our goal is to reconstruct all of the
ancestral genomes so that the number of evolutionary operations is minimized.
Algorithms for reconstructing evolutionary history from gene orders are usually
based on repeatedly computing medians of genomes at neighbouring vertices of
the tree. We propose a new, more general approach, based on an iterative local
optimization procedure. In each step, we propose candidates for ancestral
genomes and choose the best ones by dynamic programming. We have implemented
our method and used it to reconstruct evolutionary history of 16 yeast mtDNAs
and 13 Campanulaceae cpDNAs.

mean-field methods and weak-noise expansions. Similar methods have been applied
also in spatially extended problems, relying on the fact that these populations
are organized in colonies with a large local density of individuals. We provide
a counterexample discussing a one-dimensional neutral population with negative
frequency-dependent selection. The system exhibits a continuous phase
transition between genetic fixation and coexistence unexpected from weak-noise
arguments. We show that the behavior is a non-perturbative effect of the
internal noise that is amplified by presence of spatial correlations
(strong-noise regime).

an individual basis (IBM) while the mosquito population, produced by an
independent model, is treated by compartments (SEI). We study the spread of
epidemics by the sole action of the mosquito. Exponential, deterministic and
experimental distributions for the (human) exposed period are considered in two
weather scenarios, one corresponding to temperate climate and the other to
tropical climate. Virus circulation, final epidemic size and duration of
outbreaks are considered showing that the results present little sensitivity to
the statistics followed by the exposed period provided the median of the
distributions are in coincidence. Only the time between an introduced
(imported) case and the appearance of the first symptomatic secondary case is
sensitive to this distribution. We finally show that the IBM model introduced
is precisely a realization of a compartmental model, and that at least in this
case, the choice between compartmental models or IBM is only a matter of
convenience.

brain neurons of different types of rats are analyzed by mapping to telegraph
signals. Since the neural information is coded in the length of the interspike
intervals and their positions on the time axis, this mapping is the most direct
way to map a spike train into a signal which allows a proper application of the
Fourier transform methods. This analysis shows that healthy neurons firing has
periodic and chaotic deterministic clocks while for the rats representing
genetic animal model of human depression these neuron clocks might be broken,
that results in decoherence between the depressive neurons firing. Since
depression is usually accompanied by a narrowing of consciousness this specific
decoherence can be considered as a cause of the phenomenon of the consciousness
narrowing as well. This suggestion is also supported by observation of the
large-scale chaotic coherence of the posterior piriform and entorhinal
cortices' electrical activity at transition from anesthesia to the waking state
with full consciousness.

distribution with important implications for both human and animal health. The
emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing
presence in many areas of Africa, has negatively impacted both medical and
veterinary infrastructures and human health. Furthermore, worldwide attention
should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV. We propose a
new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential
equations to assess disease spread in both time and space; with the latter
driven as a function of contact networks. The model is based on weighted
contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions
and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for
each set of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among
regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement of the infected individuals is not
only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated
into the model. We have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data
from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study; mapping the
epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive
set of simulation results shows the potential of the proposed approach for
accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the
world. The benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model
differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals among different
provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the
outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the exact value of the reproduction
number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction
number are analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.

The description takes into account the self-consistent electric field generated

As an application we study the noise in the ion transport process, including
the effect of the displacement current generated by the fluctuating electric
field. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the electric current with
and without the displacement current.

systems to external inputs. The motivation arises from molecular systems
biology. and, in particular, the recent discovery of an important transient
property, related to Weber's law in psychophysics: &quot;fold-change detection&quot; in
adapting systems, the property that scale uncertainty does not affect
responses. FCD appears to play an important role in key signaling transduction
mechanisms in eukaryotes, including the ERK and Wnt pathways, as well as in
E.coli and possibly other prokaryotic chemotaxis pathways. In this paper, we
provide further theoretical results regarding this property. Far more
generally, we develop a necessary and sufficient characterization of adapting
systems whose transient behaviors are invariant under the action of a set
(often, a group) of symmetries in their sensory field. A particular instance is
FCD, which amounts to invariance under the action of the multiplicative group
of positive real numbers. Our main result is framed in terms of a notion which
extends equivariant actions of compact Lie groups. Its proof relies upon
control theoretic tools, and in particular the uniqueness theorem for minimal
realizations.

branching probabilities decrease with branch age $\tau$ as $\tau^{-\alpha}$.
Depending on the exponent $\alpha$, the scaling of tree depth with tree size
$n$ displays a transition between the logarithmic scaling of random trees and
an algebraic growth. At the transition ($\alpha=1$) tree depth grows as $(\log
n)^2$. This anomalous scaling is in good agreement with the trend observed in
evolution of biological species, thus providing a theoretical support for
age-dependent speciation and associating it to the occurrence of a critical
point.

enduring enterprise, especially hindered by limited knowledge of the mechanisms
through which extinction of infection propagation comes about. We here report
on a mechanism causing extinction of a propagating infection due to
intraspecific competition to infect susceptible hosts. Beneficial mutations
allow the pathogen to increase the production of progeny, while the host cell
is allowed to develop defenses against infection. When the number of
susceptible cells is unlimited, a feedback runaway co-evolution between host
resistance and progeny production occurs. However, physical space limits the
advantage that the virus can obtain from increasing offspring numbers, thus
infection clearance may result from an increase in host defenses beyond a
finite threshold. Our results might be relevant to better understand
propagation of viral infections in tissues with mobility constraints, and the
implications that environments with different geometrical properties might have
in devising control strategies.

to a periodic train of short current pulses with Gaussian noise. The
deterministic neuron is bistable for antiresonant frequencies. When the stimuli
arrive at the resonant frequency the firing rate is a continuous function of
the current amplitude $I_0$ and scales as $(I_0-I_{th})^{1/2}$, where $I_{th}$
is an approximate threshold. Intervals of continuous irregular response
alternate with integer mode-locked regions with bistable excitation edge. There
is an even-all multimodal transition between the 2:1 and 3:1 states in the
vicinity of the main resonance, which is analogous to the odd-all transition
discovered earlier in the high-frequency regime. For $I_0&lt;I_{th}$ and small
noise the firing rate has a maximum at the resonant frequency. For larger noise
and subthreshold stimulation the maximum firing rate initially shifts towards
lower frequencies, then returns to higher frequencies in the limit of large
noise. The stochastic coherence antiresonance, defined as the maximum of the
coefficient of variation as a function of noise intensity, occurs over a wide
range of parameter values, including monostable regions.

gene in a population of haploid individuals subjected to mutations. We show in
this paper that this model can be mapped into an influence dynamical process on
networks subjected to external influences. The panmictic case considered by
Moran corresponds to fully connected networks and can be completely solved in
terms of hypergeometric functions. Other types of networks correspond to
structured populations, for which approximate solutions are also available.
This new approach to the classic Moran model leads to a relation between
regular networks based on spatial grids and the mechanism of isolation by
distance. We discuss the consequences of this connection for topopatric
speciation and the theory of neutral speciation and biodiversity. We show that
the effect of mutations in structured populations, where individuals can mate
only with neighbors, is greatly enhanced with respect to the panmictic case. If
mating is further constrained by genetic proximity between individuals, a
balance of opposing tendencies take place: increasing diversity promoted by
enhanced effective mutations versus decreasing diversity promoted by similarity
between mates. Stabilization occurs with speciation via pattern formation. We
derive an explicit relation involving the parameters characterizing the
population that indicates when speciation is possible.

and two vertices are adjacent in $T$ if and only if their distance in $T$ is at
most $k$. Then $T$ is a $k$-leaf root of $G$. This notion was introduced by
Nishimura, Ragde, and Thilikos [2002] motivated by the search for underlying
phylogenetic trees. We study here an extension of the $k$-leaf power graph
recognition problem. This extension is motivated by a new biological question
for the evaluation of the latteral gene transfer on a population of viruses. We
allow the host graph to slightly differs from a tree and allow some cycles. In
fact we study phylogenetic galled networks in which cycles are pairwise vertex
disjoint. We show some structural results and propose polynomial algorithms for
the cases $k=3$ and $k=4$. As a consequence, squares of galled networks can
also be recognized in polynomial time.

two powerful tools to determine the protein 3D structure. However, not all
proteins can be successfully crystallized, particularly for membrane proteins.
Although NMR spectroscopy is indeed very powerful in determining the 3D
structures of membrane proteins, same as X-ray crystallography, it is still
very time-consuming and expensive. Under many circumstances, due to the
noncrystalline and insoluble nature of some proteins, X-ray and NMR cannot be
used at all. Computational approaches, however, allow us to obtain a
description of the protein 3D structure at a submicroscopic level.
  To the best of the author's knowledge, there is little structural data
available to date on the AGAAAAGA palindrome in the hydrophobic region
(113--120) of prion proteins, which falls just within the N-terminal
unstructured region (1--123) of prion proteins. Many experimental studies have
shown that the AGAAAAGA region has amyloid fibril forming properties and plays
an important role in prion diseases. However, due to the noncrystalline and
insoluble nature of the amyloid fibril, little structural data on the AGAAAAGA
is available. This paper introduces a simple optimization strategy approach to
address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils.
Atomic-resolution structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid fibrils got in this
paper are useful for the drive to find treatments for prion diseases in the
field of medicinal chemistry.

excitation of each neuron, the network is composed of, and positions of
impulses in communication lines between neurons. In neurophysiological
experiments, the neuronal firing moments are registered, but not the state of
communication lines. But future spiking moments depend essentially on the past
positions of impulses in the lines. This suggests, that the sequence of
intervals between firing moments (interspike intervals, ISIs) in the network
could be non-Markovian. In this paper, we address this question for a simplest
possible neural &quot;net&quot;, namely, a single neuron with delayed feedback. The
neuron receives excitatory input both from the driving Poisson stream and from
its own output through the feedback line. We obtain analytical expressions for
conditional probability density $P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1,t_0)$, which gives the
probability to get an output ISI of duration $t_{n+1}$ provided the previous
$(n+1)$ output ISIs had durations $t_n,...,t_1,t_0$. It is proven exactly, that
$P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1,t_0)$ does not reduce to $P(t_{n+1} | t_n,...,t_1)$
for any $n \geq 0$. This means that the output ISIs stream cannot be
represented as Markov chain of any finite order.

of biochemical processes. It has long been understood how this equation
approximates the dynamics of irreversible enzymatic reactions. However, a
similar approximation in the case of networks, where the product of one
reaction can act as an enzyme in another, has not been fully developed. Here we
rigorously derive such an approximation in a class of coupled enzymatic
networks where the individual interactions are of Michaelis-Menten type. We
show that the sufficient conditions for the validity of the total quasi steady
state assumption (tQSSA), obtained in a single protein case by Borghans, de
Boer and Segel can be extended to sufficient conditions for the validity of the
tQSSA in a large class of enzymatic networks. Secondly, we derive reduced
equations that approximate the network's dynamics and involve only protein
concentrations. This significantly reduces the number of equations necessary to
model such systems. We prove the validity of this approximation using geometric
singular perturbation theory and results about matrix differentiation. The
ideas used in deriving the approximating equations are quite general, and can
be used to systematize other model reductions.

rod shaped bacteria enable them to effectively resolve traffic jams formed
during swarming and maximize their swarming rate. In this paper, a connection
is found between a microscopic one dimensional cell-based stochastic model of
reversing non-overlapping bacteria and a macroscopic non-linear diffusion
equation describing dynamics of the cellular density. Boltzmann-Matano analysis
is used to determine the nonlinear diffusion equation corresponding to the
specific reversal frequency. Macroscopically (ensemble-vise) averaged
stochastic dynamics is shown to be in a very good agreement with the numerical
solutions of the nonlinear diffusion equation. Critical density $p_0$ is
obtained such that nonlinear diffusion is dominated by the collisions between
cells for the densities $p&gt;p_0$. An analytical approximation of the pairwise
collision time and semi-analytical fit for the total jam time per reversal
period are also obtained. It is shown that cell populations with high reversal
frequencies are able to spread out effectively at high densities. If the cells
rarely reverse then they are able to spread out at lower densities but are less
efficient at spreading out at at higher densities.

Although these models are quite different, they lead to identical distributions

for the probability of finding one or more groups of taxa as clades in a rooted
tree, or as `clans' in an unrooted tree. Our findings are relevant for
calculating the statistical significance of observed monophyly and reciprocal
monophyly in phylogenetics.

sets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will
increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we analyse larger
regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer
periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through
minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints.
This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points,
such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new
method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal
number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost which, under
mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares
favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost
can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new
method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods.
We also compare with the Binary Segmentation algorithm for identifying
changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to
substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the
data.

doi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0009621) ant motion out of the nest is shown to be a
non-stationary process intriguingly similar to the dynamics encountered in
\emph{physical aging} of glassy systems. Specifically, exit events can be
described as a Poisson process in logarithmic time, or, for short, a
log-Poisson process. Nouvellet et al.(J. Theor. Biol. 266, 573. (2010))
criticized these conclusions and performed new experiments where the exit
process could more simply be described by standard Poisson statistics. In their
reply, (J Theor. Biol. 269, 356-358 (2011)) Richardson et al. stressed that the
two sets of experiments were performed under very different conditions and
claimed that this was the likely source of the discrepancy. The focal point of
this work is whether log-Poisson and Poisson statistics both are possible under
different external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where
interacting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring
site on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the
ensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions
between ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are
defined and on a control parameter dubbed 'degree of stochasticity' (DS), the
dynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a
standard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can
be described as suggested by Richardson et al.

punishment by institution can deliver the evolution of cooperation. Compared to
peer sanctioning, institutional sanctioning may be sensitive to players'
attitude toward players who do not pre-commit punishment. Departed from former
studies based on the punisher who always acts cooperatively, we assume that the
punishing player is skeptical in that she cooperates in proportion to how many
same types join in her team. Relying on stochastic adaptive dynamics, we show
that institutional sanctioning coupled with skeptical punisher can make
cooperation evolve for the case where peer sanctioning may not.

regulatory networks for more than four decades. However, most RBN studies have
been made with random topologies, while real regulatory networks have been
found to be modular. In this work, we extend classical RBNs to define modular
RBNs. Statistical experiments and analytical results show that modularity has a
strong effect on the properties of RBNs. In particular, modular RBNs have more
attractors and are closer to criticality when chaotic dynamics would be
expected, compared to classical RBNs.

become synchronized by virtue of the statistical correlations in their noisy
input streams. Recent work has shown that the degree of correlation transfer
from input currents to output spikes depends not only on intrinsic oscillator
dynamics, but also depends on the length of the observation window over which
the correlation is calculated. In this paper we use stochastic phase reduction
and regular perturbations to derive the correlation of the total phase elapsed
over long time scales, a quantity which provides a convenient proxy for the
spike count correlation. Over short time scales, we derive the spike count
correlation directly using straightforward probabilistic reasoning applied to
the density of the phase difference. Our approximations show that output
correlation scales with the autocorrelation of the phase resetting curve over
long time scales. We also find a concise expression for the influence of the
shape of the phase resetting curve on the initial slope of the output
correlation over short time scales. These analytic results together with
numerical simulations provide new intuitions for the recent counterintuitive
finding that type I oscillators transfer correlations more faithfully than do
type II over long time scales, while the reverse holds true for the better
understood case of short time scales.

much attention in the game theory of evolutionary dynamics. Both the ultimate
fixation and the pre-fixation transient behavior are important to a full
understanding of the dynamics. In this paper, we study the transient dynamics
of the well-mixed Moran process through constructing a landscape function. It
is shown that the landscape playing a central theoretical &quot;device&quot; that
integrates several lines of inquiries: the stable behavior of the replicator
dynamics, the long-time fixation, and continuous diffusion approximation
associated with asymptotically large population. Several issues relating to the
transient dynamics are discussed: (i) multiple time scales phenomenon
associated with intra- and inter-attractoral dynamics; (ii) discontinuous
transition in stochastically stationary process akin to Maxwell construction in
equilibrium statistical physics; and (iii) the dilemma diffusion approximation
facing as a continuous approximation of the discrete evolutionary dynamics. It
is found that rare events with exponentially small probabilities, corresponding
to the uphill movements and barrier crossing in the landscape with multiple
wells that are made possible by strong nonlinear dynamics, plays an important
role in understanding the origin of the complexity in evolutionary, nonlinear
biological systems.

phenotypes, including diverse degrees of virulence. The evolution of virulence
in viral populations is, however, poorly understood. Based on the experimental
observation of an RNA virus clone in cell culture diversifying into two
subpopulations of different virulence, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous
virus populations and the evolution of virulence. We introduce a
competition-colonization trade-off into standard mathematical models of
intra-host viral infection. Colonizers are fast spreading, virulent strains,
whereas competitors are less virulent variants that are more successful within
coinfected cells. We observe biphasic dynamics of the population: Early in the
infection the population is dominated by colonizers, which later will be
outcompeted by competitors. The simulations suggest the existence of a steady
state where few low-virulence variants coexist. This equilibrium implies
collective virulence attenuation in the population, in contrast to previous
models predicting development of the population towards increased virulence.
Nevertheless, the attenuation effect disappears if we include a highly
simplified immune response in our models. Thus, the competition-colonization
trade-off indicates a role for virulence in the modulation of the viral
population diversity. The evolution of virulence is a dynamic feature of the
population shaped by interactions between individuals and by the structure of
the patchy habitat.

that are difficult to predict or measure experimentally. The validity and
robustness of a given model can be evaluated by a sensitivity test to its input
parameters. In this study, we performed local (based on a Taylor-like method)
and global sensitivity (based on Monte Carlo filtering techniques) analyses of
a previously derived PAR1-mediated activation model of endothelial cells. This
activation model previously demonstrated that peptide-activated PAR1 has a
different receptor/G-protein binding affinity that favors Galpha_q activation
over Galpha_12/13 by approximately 800-fold. Interestingly, the present study
shows that the parameter regulating the binding rate of activated PAR1 to
Galpha_12/13 is indeed important to obtain the expected RhoGTP response.
Moreover, we show that the parameters representing the rate of PAR1
deactivation and the rate of PAR1 binding to G_q, are the most important
parameters in the system. Finally, we illustrate that the kinetic model
considered in this study is robust and we provide complementary insights into
the biological meaning and importance of its kinetic parameters.

  Networks with Genome-wide Association Data</title><categories>q-bio.MN q-bio.GN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Genetic interaction measures how different genes collectively contribute to a
phenotype, and can reveal functional compensation and buffering between
pathways under genetic perturbations. Recently, genome-wide screening for
genetic interactions has revealed genetic interaction networks that provide
novel insights either when analyzed by themselves or when integrated with other
functional genomic datasets. For higher eukaryotes such as human, the above
reverse-genetics approaches are not straightforward since the phenotypes of
interest for higher eukaryotes are difficult to study in a cell based assay. We
propose a general framework for constructing and analyzing human genetic
interaction networks from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
used for case-control studies on complex diseases. Specifically, the approach
contains three major steps: (1) estimating SNP-SNP genetic interactions, (2)
identifying linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and mapping SNP-SNP interactions
to block-block interactions, and (3) functional mapping for LD blocks. We
performed two sets of functional analyses for each of the six datasets used in
the paper, and demonstrated that (i) the constructed genetic interaction
networks are supported by functional evidence from independent biological
databases, and (ii) the network can be used to discover pairs of compensatory
gene modules (between-pathway models) in their joint association with a disease
phenotype. The proposed framework should provide novel insights beyond existing
approaches that either ignore interactions between SNPs or model different
SNP-SNP pairs with genetic interactions separately. Furthermore, our study
provides evidence that some of the core properties of genetic interaction
networks based on reverse genetics in model organisms like yeast are also
present in genetic interactions revealed by natural variation in human
populations.

allow an exact description of their energetic spectrum. From the Bethe
equations, I formulate the Baxter &quot;T-Q&quot; relation, that is the starting point of
two complementary approaches based on nonlinear integral equations. The first
one is known as thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, the second one as
Kl\&quot;umper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri- de Vega. I show the steps toward the
derivation of the equations for some of the models concerned. I study the
infrared and ultraviolet limits and discuss the numerical approach. Higher rank
integrals of motion can be obtained, so gaining some control on the
eigenvectors. After, I discuss the Hubbard model in relation to the N = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory. The Hubbard model describes hopping electrons on a
lattice.
  In the second part, I present an evolutionary model based on Turing machines.
The goal is to describe aspects of the real biological evolution, or Darwinism,
by letting evolve populations of algorithms. Particularly, with this model one
can study the mutual transformation of coding/non coding parts in a genome or
the presence of an error threshold. The assembly of oligomeric proteins is an
important phenomenon which interests the majority of proteins in a cell. I
participated to the creation of the project &quot;Gemini&quot; which has for purpose the
investigation of the structural data of the interfaces of such proteins. The
objective is to differentiate the role of amino acids and determine the
presence of patterns characterizing certain geometries.

computation model based on Turing Machines that we introduced in a previous
article.
  The use of Turing Machines allows for very simple mechanisms of code growth
and code activation/inactivation through point mutations. To any value of the
point mutation probability corresponds a maximum amount of active code that can
be maintained by selection and the Turing machines that reach it are said to be
at the error threshold. Simulations with our model show that the Turing
machines population evolve towards the error threshold.
  Mathematical descriptions of the model point out that this behaviour is due
more to the mutation-selection dynamics than to the intrinsic nature of the
Turing machines. This indicates that this result is much more general than the
model considered here and could play a role also in biological evolution.

with prescribed degree distribution is studied. Each edge $(u,v)$ in the graph
is equipped with two weights $W_{(u,v)}$ and $W_{(v,u)}$ that represent the
(subjective) strength of the connection and determine the probability that $u$
infects $v$ in case $u$ is infected and vice versa. Expressions for the
epidemic threshold are derived for i.i.d.\ weights and for weights that are
functions of the degrees. For i.i.d.\ weights, a variation of the so called
acquaintance vaccination strategy is analyzed where vertices are chosen
randomly and neighbors of these vertices with large edge weights are
vaccinated. This strategy is shown to outperform the strategy where the
neighbors are chosen randomly in the sense that the basic reproduction number
is smaller for a given vaccination coverage.

internal and external conditions by dynamically coordinating their gene
expression profiles. Our ability to make quantitative measurements in these
biochemical circuits has deepened our understanding of what kinds of
computations genetic regulatory networks can perform and with what reliability.
These advances have motivated researchers to look for connections between the
architecture and function of genetic regulatory networks. Transmitting
information between network's inputs and its outputs has been proposed as one
such possible measure of function, relevant in certain biological contexts.
Here we summarize recent developments in the application of information theory
to gene regulatory networks. We first review basic concepts in information
theory necessary to understand recent work. We then discuss the functional
complexity of gene regulation which arrises from the molecular nature of the
regulatory interactions. We end by reviewing some experiments supporting the
view that genetic networks responsible for early development of multicellular
organisms might be maximizing transmitted 'positional' information.

systems. Stochastic chemical kinetic models are often utilized to accurately
capture the stochastic nature of these systems due to low numbers of molecules.
Collecting system data allows for estimation of stochastic chemical kinetic
rate parameters. We describe a well-known, but typically impractical data
augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating these
parameters. The impracticality is due to the use of rejection sampling for
latent trajectories with fixed initial and final endpoints which can have
diminutive acceptance probability. We show how graphical processing units can
be efficiently utilized for parameter estimation in systems that hitherto were
inestimable. For more complex systems, we show the efficiency gain over
traditional CPU computing is on the order of 200. Finally, we show a Bayesian
analysis of a system based on Michaelis-Menton kinetics.

the entropy-theoretic notions. This is primarily due to finite sample effects
and high-dimensionality problems. In particular, topological entropy has been
implemented in previous literature to conclude that entropy of exons is higher
than of introns, thus implying that exons are more &quot;random&quot; than introns. We
define a new approximation to topological entropy free from the aforementioned
difficulties. We compute its expected value and apply this definition to the
intron and exon regions of the human genome to observe that as expected, the
entropy of introns are significantly higher than that of exons. Though we
surprisingly find that introns are less random than expected: their entropy is
lower than the computed expected value. We observe the perplexing phenomena
that chromosome Y has atypically low and bi-modal entropy, possibly
corresponding to random sequences (high entropy) and sequences that posses
hidden structure or function (low entropy).

and transient oscillations of the population densities, the associated
frequency power spectra, and the spatial correlation functions in the
(quasi-)steady state in two-dimensional stochastic May--Leonard models of
mobile individuals, allowing for particle exchanges with nearest-neighbors and
hopping onto empty sites. We therefore consider a class of four-state
three-species cyclic predator-prey models whose total particle number is not
conserved. We demonstrate that quenched disorder in either the reaction or in
the mobility rates hardly impacts the dynamical evolution, the emergence and
structure of spiral patterns, or the mean extinction time in this system. We
also show that direct particle pair exchange processes promote the formation of
regular spiral structures. Moreover, upon increasing the rates of mobility, we
observe a remarkable change in the extinction properties in the May--Leonard
system (for small system sizes): (1) As the mobility rate exceeds a threshold
that separates a species coexistence (quasi-)steady state from an absorbing
state, the mean extinction time as function of system size N crosses over from
a functional form ~ e^{cN} / N (where c is a constant) to a linear dependence;
(2) the measured histogram of extinction times displays a corresponding
crossover from an (approximately) exponential to a Gaussian distribution. The
latter results are found to hold true also when the mobility rates are randomly
distributed.

methods, have become a favourite tool for the analysis of complex stochastic
models, primarily in population genetics but also in financial analyses. We
advocated in Grelaud et al. (2009) the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in
the specific case of Gibbs random fields (GRF), relying on a sufficiency
property mainly enjoyed by GRFs to show that the approach was legitimate.
Despite having previously suggested the use of ABC for model choice in a wider
range of models in the DIY ABC software (Cornuet et al., 2008), we present
theoretical evidence that the general use of ABC for model choice is fraught
with danger in the sense that no amount of computation, however large, can
guarantee a proper approximation of the posterior probabilities of the models
under comparison.

pathways with similar design and highly homologous components including
multiple small RNAs (sRNAs). However, the associated luminescence phenotypes of
strains with sRNA deletions differ dramatically: in \textit{V. harveyi}, the
sRNAs act additively; however, in \textit{V. cholerae}, the sRNAs act
redundantly. Furthermore, there are striking differences in the luminescence
phenotypes for different pathway mutants in \textit{V. harveyi} and \textit{V.
cholerae}. However these differences have not been connected with the observed
differences for the sRNA deletion strains in these bacteria. In this work, we
present a model for quorum sensing induced luminescence phenotypes focusing on
the interactions of multiple sRNAs with target mRNA. Within our model, we find
that one key parameter -- the fold-change in protein concentration necessary
for luminescence activation -- can control whether the sRNAs appear to act
additively or redundantly. For specific parameter choices, we find that
differences in this key parameter can also explain hitherto unconnected
luminescence phenotypes differences for various pathway mutants in \textit{V.
harveyi} and \textit{V. cholerae}. The model can thus provide a unifying
explanation for observed differences in luminescence phenotypes and can also be
used to make testable predictions for future experiments.

(VOCs) contained in human breath and is considered to be a potentially useful
biomarker for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. However, neither the exact
biochemical origin of isoprene nor its physiological role are understood in
sufficient depth, thus hindering the validation of breath isoprene tests in
clinical routine.
  Exhaled isoprene concentrations are reported to change under different
clinical and physiological conditions, especially in response to enhanced
cardiovascular and respiratory activity. Investigating isoprene exhalation
kinetics under dynamical exercise helps to gather the relevant experimental
information for understanding the gas exchange phenomena associated with this
important VOC.
  A first model for isoprene in exhaled breath has been developed by our
research group. In the present paper, we aim at giving a concise overview of
this model and describe its role in providing supportive evidence for a
peripheral (extrahepatic) source of isoprene. In this sense, the results
presented here may enable a new perspective on the biochemical processes
governing isoprene formation in the human body.

complexation of a single long semi-flexible polyelectrolyte (PE) chain and many
oppositely charged spherical macroions are investigated numerically at the
ground-state level using a chain-sphere cell model. The model takes into
account chain elasticity as well as electrostatic interactions between charged
spheres and chain segments. Using a numerical optimization method based on a
periodically repeated unit cell, we obtain fiber configurations that minimize
the total energy. The optimal configurations exhibit a variety of helical
structures for the arrangement of macroions including zig-zag, solenoidal and
beads-on-a-string patterns. These structures are determined by a competition
between attraction between spheres and the PE chain (which favors chain
wrapping around the spheres), chain bending and electrostatic repulsion between
chain segments (which favor unwrapping of the chain), and the interactions
between neighboring sphere-chain complexes which can be attractive or repulsive
depending on the system parameters such as medium salt concentration, macroion
charge and chain length per macroion (linker size). At about physiological salt
concentration, dense zig-zag patterns are found to be energetically most stable
when parameters appropriate for the DNA-histone system in a chromatin fiber are
adopted. In fact, the predicted fiber diameter in this regime is found to be
around 30nm, which appears to agree with the thickness observed in in vitro
experiments on chromatin. We also find a macroion density of 5-6 per 11nm which
agrees with the zig-zag or cross-linker models of chromatin. Since our study
deals primarily with a generic model, these findings suggest that
chromatin-like structures should also be observable for PE-macroion complexes
formed in solutions of DNA and synthetic nano-colloids of opposite charge.

evolution taking into account biological roles of genes and their constituent
domains. In our model numbers of genes in different functional categories are
coupled to each other. For example, an increase in the number of metabolic
enzymes in a genome is usually accompanied by addition of new transcription
factors regulating these enzymes. Such coupling can be thought of as a
proportional &quot;recipe&quot; for genome composition of the type &quot;a spoonful of sugar
for each egg yolk&quot;. The model jointly reproduces two known empirical laws: the
distribution of family sizes and the nonlinear scaling of the number of genes
in certain functional categories (e.g. transcription factors) with genome size.
In addition, it allows us to derive a novel relation between the exponents
characterising these two scaling laws, establishing a direct quantitative
connection between evolutionary and functional categories. It predicts that
functional categories that grow faster-than-linearly with genome size to be
characterised by flatter-than-average family size distributions. This relation
is confirmed by our bioinformatics analysis of prokaryotic genomes. This proves
that the joint quantitative trends of functional and evolutionary classes can
be understood in terms of evolutionary growth with proportional recipes.

behavior of coupled discrete-time excitable cells (SIRS-like cellular
automata). Using mean-field analysis and simulations, we show that a
synchronized phase with stable collective oscillations exists even with
non-deterministic refractory periods. Moreover, further increasing the coupling
strength leads to a reentrant transition, where the synchronized phase loses
stability. In an intermediate regime, we also observe bistability (and
consequently hysteresis) between a synchronized phase and an active but
incoherent phase without oscillations. The onset of the oscillations appears in
the mean-field equations as a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, the nature of which
(i.e. super- or subcritical) is determined by the first Lyapunov coefficient.
This allows us to determine the borders of the oscillating and of the bistable
regions. The mean-field prediction thus obtained agrees quantitatively with
simulations of complete graphs and, for random graphs, qualitatively predicts
the overall structure of the phase diagram. The latter can be obtained from
simulations by defining an order parameter q suited for detecting collective
oscillations of excitable elements. We briefly review other commonly used order
parameters and show (via data collapse) that q satisfies the expected finite
size scaling relations.

immunohistochemistry to become a powerful medium-to-high throughput analysis
tool, particularly for the validation of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
However, as study size grows, the manual evaluation of these assays becomes a
prohibitive limitation; it vastly reduces throughput and greatly increases
variability and expense. We propose an algorithm - Tissue Array Co-Occurrence
Matrix Analysis (TACOMA) - for quantifying cellular phenotypes based on
textural regularity summarized by local inter-pixel relationships. The
algorithm can be easily trained for any staining pattern, is absent of
sensitive tuning parameters and has the ability to report salient pixels in an
image that contribute to its score. Pathologists' input via informative
training patches is an important aspect of the algorithm that allows the
training for any specific marker or cell type. With co-training, the error rate
of TACOMA can be reduced substantially for a very small training sample (e.g.,
with size 30). We give theoretical insights into the success of co-training via
thinning of the feature set in a high-dimensional setting when there is
&quot;sufficient&quot; redundancy among the features. TACOMA is flexible, transparent and
provides a scoring process that can be evaluated with clarity and confidence.
In a study based on an estrogen receptor (ER) marker, we show that TACOMA is
comparable to, or outperforms, pathologists' performance in terms of accuracy
and repeatability.

to a globule state followed by a second &quot;transition&quot; into a native state. When
placed in the proximity of an attractive surface, there is a competition
between surface adsorption and folding that leads to an intriguing sequence of
&quot;transitions&quot;. These transitions depend upon the relative interaction strengths
and are largely inaccessible to &quot;standard&quot; Monte Carlo methods.

On the nanometer length-scale the organization of DNA as chromatin in the
chromosomes involves a coiling of DNA around the histone core of the
nucleosome. We suggest that the size of the nucleosome core particle is
dictated by the fulfillment of two criteria: One is optimizing the volume
fraction of the DNA double helix; this requirement for close-packing has its
root in optimizing atomic and molecular interactions. The other criterion being
that of having a zero strain-twist coupling; being a zero-twist structure is a
necessity when allowing for transient tensile stresses during the
reorganization of DNA, e.g., during the reposition, or sliding, of a nucleosome
along the DNA double helix. The mathematical model we apply is based on a
tubular description of double helices assuming hard walls. When the base-pairs
of the linker-DNA is included the estimate of the size of an ideal nucleosome
is in close agreement with the experimental numbers. Interestingly, the size of
the nucleosome is shown to be a consequence of intrinsic properties of the DNA
double helix.

adaptive immune system, which we apply to binary classification. Our method
expands an existing analytical model of T-cell cross-regulation (Carneiro et
al. in Immunol Rev 216(1):48-68, 2007) that was used to study the
self-organizing dynamics of a single population of T-Cells in interaction with
an idealized antigen presenting cell capable of presenting a single antigen.
With agent-based modeling we are able to study the self-organizing dynamics of
multiple populations of distinct T-cells which interact via antigen presenting
cells that present hundreds of distinct antigens. Moreover, we show that such
self-organizing dynamics can be guided to produce an effective binary
classification of antigens, which is competitive with existing machine learning
methods when applied to biomedical text classification. More specifically, here
we test our model on a dataset of publicly available full-text biomedical
articles provided by the BioCreative challenge (Krallinger in The biocreative
ii. 5 challenge overview, p 19, 2009). We study the robustness of our model's
parameter configurations, and show that it leads to encouraging results
comparable to state-of-the-art classifiers. Our results help us understand both
T-cell cross-regulation as a general principle of guided self-organization, as
well as its applicability to document classification. Therefore, we show that
our bio-inspired algorithm is a promising novel method for biomedical article
classification and for binary document classification in general.

Boolean automata: schema redescription with two symbols. One symbol is used to
capture redundancy of individual input variables, and another to capture
permutability in sets of input variables: fully characterizing the canalization
present in Boolean functions. Two-symbol schemata explain aspects of the
behaviour of automata networks that the characterization of their emergent
patterns does not capture. We use our method to compare two well-known cellular
automata for the density classification task: the human engineered CA GKL, and
another obtained via genetic programming (GP). We show that despite having very
different collective behaviour, these rules are very similar. Indeed, GKL is a
special case of GP. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is more feasible to
compare cellular automata via schema redescriptions of their rules, than by
looking at their emergent behaviour, leading us to question the tendency in
complexity research to pay much more attention to emergent patterns than to
local interactions.

analysis of complex stochastic models. Earlier, Grelaud et al. (2009) advocated
the use of ABC for Bayesian model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random
fields, relying on a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the
approximation was legitimate. Having implemented ABC-based model choice in a
wide range of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.,
2008), we now present theoretical background as to why a generic use of ABC for
model choice is ungrounded, since it depends on an unknown amount of
information loss induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The
approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under
comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running
an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of
the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIYABC are
necessary to conduct model choice.

Although
progress is underway, developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging.
Thus, the main approach to fight the disease is vector control. A model for the
transmission of Dengue disease is presented. It consists of eight mutually
exclusive compartments representing the human and vector dynamics. It also
includes a control parameter (insecticide) in order to fight the mosquito. The
model presents three possible equilibria: two disease-free equilibria (DFE) and
another endemic equilibrium. It has been proved that a DFE is locally
asymptotically stable, whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as
the basic reproduction number, is less than one. We show that if we apply a
minimum level of insecticide, it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction
number below unity. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occurred in
2009 in Cape Verde, is presented.

  Set in Polynomial Time</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  For a given set $\mathcal{L}$ of species and a set $\mathcal{T}$ of triplets
on $\mathcal{L}$, one wants to construct a phylogenetic network which is
consistent with $\mathcal{T}$, i.e which represents all triplets of
$\mathcal{T}$. The level of a network is defined as the maximum number of
hybrid vertices in its biconnected components. When $\mathcal{T}$ is dense,
there exist polynomial time algorithms to construct level-$0,1,2$ networks (Aho
et al. 81, Jansson et al. 04, Iersel et al. 08). For higher levels, partial
answers were obtained by Iersel et al. 2008 with a polynomial time algorithm
for simple networks. In this paper, we detail the first complete answer for the
general case, solving a problem proposed by Jansson et al. 2004: for any $k$
fixed, it is possible to construct a minimum level-$k$ network consistent with
$\mathcal{T}$, if there is any, in time
$O(|\mathcal{T}|^{k+1}n^{\lfloor\frac{4k}{3}\rfloor+1})$. This is an improved
result of our preliminary version presented at CPM'2009.

proportion of unexpressed genes have pre-assembled RNA pol II transcription
initiation complex stably bound to their promoters. Some such promoter
proximally paused genes are regulated at transcription elongation rather than
at initiation; it has been proposed that this difference allows these genes to
both express faster and achieve more synchronous expression across populations
of cells, thus overcoming molecular &quot;noise&quot; arising from low copy number
factors. It has been established experimentally that genes which are regulated
at elongation tend to express faster and more synchronously; however, it has
not been shown directly whether or not it is the change in the regulated step
{\em per se} that causes this increase in speed and synchrony. We investigate
this question by proposing and analyzing a continuous-time Markov chain model
of polymerase complex assembly regulated at one of two steps: initial
polymerase association with DNA, or release from a paused, transcribing state.
Our analysis demonstrates that, over a wide range of physical parameters,
increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation
control. Further, we make new predictions about the effect of elongation
regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells,
and identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most
sensitive to molecular noise and thus may be most evolutionarily constrained.
Our methods produce symbolic expressions for quantities of interest with
reasonable computational effort and can be used to explore the interplay
between interaction topology and molecular noise in a broader class of
biochemical networks. We provide general-purpose code implementing these
methods.

deterministic model of interacting self-propelled particles in two dimensions.
In the process, we identify various types of collective motion, namely,
disordered swarms, rings, and droplets. We construct a &quot;phase diagram,&quot; which
summarizes our results as it delineates phase transitions ?all discontinuous?
between disordered swarms and vortical flocks on one hand and bound vortical
flocks and expanding formations on the other. One of the transition lines is
found to have a close analogy with the temperature-driven gas-liquid
transition, in finite clusters with the same interparticle potential.
Furthermore, we report on a type of flocking which takes place in the presence
of a uniform external driver. Altogether, our results set a rather firm stage
for experimental refinement and/or falsification of this class of models.

frequently and for extended periods of time. Root development is extensively
studied at cellular resolution to understand basic mechanisms underlying
pattern formation and maintenance in plants. Unfortunately, ensuring continuous
specimen access, while preserving physiological conditions and preventing
photo-damage, poses major barriers to measurements of cellular dynamics in
indeterminately growing organs such as plant roots. We present a system that
integrates optical sectioning through light sheet fluorescence microscopy with
hydroponic culture that enables us to image at cellular resolution a vertically
growing Arabidopsis root every few minutes and for several consecutive days. We
describe novel automated routines to track the root tip as it grows, track
cellular nuclei and identify cell divisions. We demonstrate the system's
capabilities by collecting data on divisions and nuclear dynamics.

Typically, two or more viral
agents spread within the same host population and may interact dynamically with
each other. We present a general model where two viral agents interact via an
immunity mechanism as they propagate simultaneously on two networks connecting
the same set of nodes. Exploiting a correspondence between the propagation
dynamics and a dynamical process performing progressive network generation, we
develop an analytic approach that accurately captures the dynamical interaction
between epidemics on overlay networks. The formalism allows for overlay
networks with arbitrary joint degree distribution and overlap. To illustrate
the versatility of our approach, we consider a hypothetical delayed
intervention scenario in which an immunizing agent is disseminated in a host
population to hinder the propagation of an undesirable agent (e.g. the spread
of preventive information in the context of an emerging infectious disease).

two forms of short-term plasticity, namely, short-term depression (STD) and
short-term facilitation (STF). They have time constants residing between fast
neural signaling and rapid learning, and may serve as substrates for neural
systems manipulating temporal information on relevant time scales. The present
study investigates the impact of STD and STF on the dynamics of continuous
attractor neural networks (CANNs) and their potential roles in neural
information processing. We find that STD endows the network with slow-decaying
plateau behaviors-the network that is initially being stimulated to an active
state decays to a silent state very slowly on the time scale of STD rather than
on the time scale of neural signaling. This provides a mechanism for neural
systems to hold sensory memory easily and shut off persistent activities
gracefully. With STF, we find that the network can hold a memory trace of
external inputs in the facilitated neuronal interactions, which provides a way
to stabilize the network response to noisy inputs, leading to improved accuracy
in population decoding. Furthermore, we find that STD increases the mobility of
the network states. The increased mobility enhances the tracking performance of
the network in response to time-varying stimuli, leading to anticipative neural
responses. In general, we find that STD and STP tend to have opposite effects
on network dynamics and complementary computational advantages, suggesting that
the brain may employ a strategy of weighting them differentially depending on
the computational purpose.

systems. In this review we focus on the challenges posed by interactions
between proteins, in particular transcription factors, and DNA and possible
mechanisms which allow for a fast and selective target location. Initially we
argue that DNA-binding proteins can be classified, broadly, into three distinct
classes which we illustrate using experimental data. Each class calls for a
different search process and we discuss the possible application of different
search mechanisms proposed over the years to each class. The main thrust of
this review is a new mechanism which is based on barrier discrimination. We
introduce the model and analyze in detail its consequences. It is shown that
this mechanism applies to all classes of transcription factors and can lead to
a fast and specific search. Moreover, it is shown that the mechanism has
interesting transient features which allow for stability at the target despite
rapid binding and unbinding of the transcription factor from the target.

target in cellular microdomains is a key parameter for chemical activation.
Although asymptotic estimations of the MFPT are available for various
geometries, these formula cannot be applied to degenerated structures where one
dimension of is much smaller compared to the others. Here we study the narrow
escape time (NET) problem for a Brownian particle to reach a small target
located on the surface of a flat cylinder, where the cylinder height is
comparable to the target size, and much smaller than the cylinder radius. When
the cylinder is sealed, we estimate the MFPT for a Brownian particle to hit a
small disk located centrally on the lower surface. For a laterally open
cylinder, we estimate the conditional probability and the conditional MFPT to
reach the small disk before exiting through the lateral opening. We apply our
results to diffusion in the narrow synaptic cleft, and compute the fraction and
the mean time for neurotransmitters to find their specific receptors located on
the postsynaptic terminal. Finally, we confirm our formulas with Brownian
simulations.

have been actively researched for the past decade.
  Negative examples have long been utilized in de novo motif discovery and have
been shown useful in transcription factor binding site search as well.
  However, understanding of the roles of negative examples in binding site
search is still very limited.
  We propose the 2-centroid and optimal discriminating vector methods, taking
into account negative examples. Cross-validation results on E. coli
transcription factors show that the proposed methods benefit from negative
examples, outperforming the centroid and position-specific scoring matrix
methods. We further show that our proposed methods perform better than a
state-of-the-art method. We characterize the proposed methods in the context of
the other compared methods and show that, coupled with motif subtype
identification, the proposed methods can be effectively applied to a wide range
of transcription factors. Finally, we argue that the proposed methods are
well-suited for eukaryotic transcription factors as well.

representation of visual space, with a roughly repetitive aperiodic map of
orientation preferences superimposed. It was recently found that orientation
preference maps (OPMs) obey statistical laws which are apparently invariant
among species widely separated in eutherian evolution. Here, we examine whether
one of the most prominent models for the optimization of cortical maps, the
elastic net (EN) model, can reproduce this common design. The EN model
generates representations which optimally trade of stimulus space coverage and
map continuity. While this model has been used in numerous studies, no
analytical results about the precise layout of the predicted OPMs have been
obtained so far. We present a mathematical approach to analytically calculate
the cortical representations predicted by the EN model for the joint mapping of
stimulus position and orientation. We find that in all previously studied
regimes, predicted OPM layouts are perfectly periodic. An unbiased search
through the EN parameter space identifies a novel regime of aperiodic OPMs with
pinwheel densities lower than found in experiments. In an extreme limit,
aperiodic OPMs quantitatively resembling experimental observations emerge.
Stabilization of these layouts results from strong nonlocal interactions rather
than from a coverage-continuity-compromise. Our results demonstrate that
optimization models for stimulus representations dominated by nonlocal
suppressive interactions are in principle capable of correctly predicting the
common OPM design. They question that visual cortical feature representations
can be explained by a coverage-continuity-compromise.

closed to matter and energy flow, paying special emphasis to its ability to
amplify the small initial enantiomeric excesses due to the internal and
unavoidable statistical fluctuations. The reaction steps are assumed to be
reversible, implying a thermodynamic constraint among some of the rate
constants. Absolute asymmetric synthesis is achieved in this scheme. The system
can persist for long times in quasi- stationary chiral asymmetric states before
racemizing. Strong inhibition leads to long-period chiral oscillations in the
enantiomeric excesses of the longest homopolymer chains. We also calculate the
entropy production {\sigma} per unit volume and show that {\sigma} increases to
a peak value either before or in the vicinity of the chiral symmetry breaking
transition.

statistical deviations from the idealized racemic composition. This temporary
amplification can be interpreted as a chiral excursion in a dynamic phase
space. It is well known that if the system is open to matter and energy
exchange, a permanently chiral state can be reached asymptotically, while the
final state is necessarily racemic if the system is closed. In this work, we
combine phase space analysis, stability analysis and numerical simulations to
study the initial chiral excursions and determine how they depend on whether
the system is open, semi-open or closed.

Through the
introduction of different types of noise to both the Spike-diffuse-spike (SDS)
and Baer-Rinzel (BR) models we investigate the change in behaviour of the
travelling wave solutions present in the deterministic systems, as noise
intensity increases. We show that the speed of wave propagation in the SDS and
BR models respectively decreases and increases as the noise intensity in the
spine heads increases. Interestingly the discrepancy between the models does
not seem to arise from the type of active spine head dynamics employed by the
model but rather by the form of the spine density used. In contrast the cable
is very robust to noise and as such the speed shows very little variation from
the deterministic system. We look at the effect of the noise interpretation
used to evaluate the stochastic integral; Ito or Statonovich and discuss which
may be appropriate. We also show that the correlation time and length scales of
the noise can enhance propagation of travelling wave solutions where the white
noise dominates the signal and produces noise induced phenomena.

phylogenetic trees based on DNA data is one of the main challenges of modern
biology. But despite all technological advances, DNA sequencing is still a
time-consuming and costly process. Therefore, decision criteria would be
desirable to decide a priori which data might contribute new information to the
supertree which is not explicitly displayed by any input tree. A new concept,
so-called groves, to identify taxon sets with the potential to construct such
informative supertrees was suggested by An\'e et al. in 2009. But the important
conjecture that maximal groves can easily be identified in a database remained
unproved and was published on the Isaac Newton Institute's list of open
phylogenetic problems. In this paper, we show that the conjecture does not
generally hold, but also introduce a new concept, namely 2-overlap groves,
which overcomes this problem.

controlling many essential biological functions, including cellular
differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing the network
topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge, in part due to the
exceedingly large variety of GRNs that exist for even a small number of
components. We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction
network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity
for bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two
transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only
the most elementary biochemical processes). We find that there exist reaction
rate constants leading to bistability in ~90% of these GRN models, including
several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly
associated with bistable systems, and the majority of which could only be
identified as bistable through an original subnetwork-based analysis. A
topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or
absence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks
(i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable
subnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies
suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with
relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight
the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network
identification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available
protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave
in a bistable fashion.

with populations, whether of molecules or organisms, and both seek to simplify
evolution in very many dimensions. Often, methodologies have undergone parallel
and independent development, as with stochastic methods in population genetics.
We discuss aspects of population genetics that have embraced methods from
physics: amongst others, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, travelling
waves, and Monte-Carlo methods have been used to study polygenic evolution,
rates of adaptation, and range expansions. These applications indicate that
evolutionary biology can further benefit from interactions with other areas of
statistical physics, for example, by following the distribution of paths taken
by a population through time.

pathogen that experiences different selective pressures according to a
stochastic process. In every environment, the evolution of the pathogen is
described by a version of the Fisher-Haldane-Wright equation while the
switching between environments follows a Markov jump process. We investigate
how the qualitative behavior of a simple single-host deterministic system
changes when the stochastic switching process is added. In particular, we study
the stability in probability of monomorphic equilibria. We prove that in a
&quot;constantly&quot; fluctuating environment, the genotype with the highest mean
fitness is asymptotically stable in probability. However, if the probability of
host switching depends on the genotype composition of the population,
polymorphism can be stably maintained.

Biosciences 240 (2012), p. 70-75. A corrigendum has appeared in the same

assay. The filament is described as rigid rod free to slide in two dimensions.
The motor proteins consist of polymeric tails tethered to the plane and modeled
as linear springs and motor heads that bind to the filament. As in related
models of rigid and soft two-state motors, the binding/unbinding dynamics of
the motor heads and the dependence of the transition rates on the load exerted
by the motor tails play a crucial role in controlling the filament's dynamics.
Our work shows that the filament effectively behaves as a self-propelled rod at
long times, but with non-Markovian noise sources arising from the coupling to
the motor binding/unbinding dynamics. The effective propulsion force of the
filament and the active renormalization of the various friction and diffusion
constants are calculated in terms of microscopic motor and filament parameters.
These quantities could be probed by optical force microscopy.

Biosci. Eng., 9(2), 2012</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Irregular bone remodeling is associated with a number of bone diseases such
as osteoporosis and multiple myeloma.
  Computational and mathematical modeling can aid in therapy and treatment as
well as understanding fundamental biology. Different approaches to modeling
give insight into different aspects of a phenomena so it is useful to have an
arsenal of various computational and mathematical models.
  Here we develop a mathematical representation of bone remodeling that can
effectively describe many aspects of the complicated geometries and spatial
behavior observed.
  There is a sharp interface between bone and marrow regions. Also the surface
of bone moves in and out, i.e. in the normal direction, due to remodeling.
Based on these observations we employ the use of a level-set function to
represent the spatial behavior of remodeling. We elaborate on a temporal model
for osteoclast and osteoblast population dynamics to determine the change in
bone mass which influences how the interface between bone and marrow changes.
  We exhibit simulations based on our computational model that show the motion
of the interface between bone and marrow as a consequence of bone remodeling.
The simulations show that it is possible to capture spatial behavior of bone
remodeling in complicated geometries as they occur \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in
vivo}.
  By employing the level set approach it is possible to develop computational
and mathematical representations of the spatial behavior of bone remodeling. By
including in this formalism further details, such as more complex cytokine
interactions and accurate parameter values, it is possible to obtain
simulations of phenomena related to bone remodeling with spatial behavior much
as \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo}. This makes it possible to perform
\emph{in silica} experiments more closely resembling experimental observations.

Rosenzweig in a class of
predator-prey models. Two of the parameters in the models are crucial for the
paradox. These two parameters are the prey's carrying capacity and prey's
half-saturation for predation. Intuitively, increasing the carrying capacity
due to enrichment of the prey's environment should lead to a more stable
predator-prey system. Analytically, it turns out that increasing the carrying
capacity always leads to an unstable predator-prey system that is susceptible
to extinction from environmental random perturbations. This is the so-called
paradox of enrichment. Our resolution here rests upon a closer investigation on
a dimensionless number $H$ formed from the carrying capacity and the prey's
half-saturation. By recasting the models into dimensionless forms, the models
are in fact governed by a few dimensionless numbers including $H$. The effects
of the two parameters: carrying capacity and half-saturation are incorporated
into the number $H$. In fact, increasing the carrying capacity is equivalent
(i.e. has the same effect on $H$) to decreasing the half-saturation which
implies more aggressive predation. Since there is no paradox between more
aggressive predation and instability of the predator-prey system, the paradox
of enrichment is resolved.
  We also further explore spatially dependent models for which the phase space
is infinite dimensional. The spatially independent limit cycle which is
generated by a Hopf bifurcation from an unstable steady state, is linearly
stable in the infinite dimensional phase space. Numerical simulations indicate
that the basin of attraction of the limit cycle is riddled. This shows that
spatial perturbations can sometimes (neither always nor never) remove the
paradox of enrichment near the limit cycle!

gene expression patterns. The study of their topology has revealed that certain
subgraphs of interactions or &quot;motifs&quot; appear at anomalously high frequencies.
We ask here whether this phenomenon may emerge because of the functions carried
out by these networks. Given a framework for describing regulatory interactions
and dynamics, we consider in the space of all regulatory networks those that
have a prescribed function. Monte Carlo sampling is then used to determine how
these functional networks lead to specific motif statistics in the
interactions. In the case where the regulatory networks are constrained to
exhibit multi-stability, we find a high frequency of gene pairs that are
mutually inhibitory and self-activating. In contrast, networks constrained to
have periodic gene expression patterns (mimicking for instance the cell cycle)
have a high frequency of bifan-like motifs involving four genes with at least
one activating and one inhibitory interaction.

affecting humans and animals. However, by now there have not been some
effective therapeutic approaches or medications to treat all these prion
diseases. Rabbits, dogs, and horses are the only mammalian species reported to
be resistant to infection from prion diseases isolated from other species.
Recently, the $\beta$2-$\alpha$2 loop has been reported to contribute to their
protein structural stabilities. The author has found that rabbit prion protein
has a strong salt bridge ASP177-ARG163 (like a taut bow string) keeping this
loop linked. This paper confirms that this salt bridge also contributes to the
structural stability of horse prion protein. Thus, the region of
$\beta$2-$\alpha$2 loop might be a potential drug target region. Besides this
very important salt bridge, other four important salt bridges
GLU196-ARG156-HIS187, ARG156-ASP202 and GLU211-HIS177 are also found to greatly
contribute to the structural stability of horse prion protein. Rich databases
of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts for horse prion
protein can be found in this paper.

(pediculus humanus capitis) to build a model of the evolution of head lice
colonies. Using theory and computer simulations, we show that the model can be
used to assess the impact of the various strategies usually applied to
eradicate head lice, both conscious (treatments) and unconscious (grooming). In
the case of treatments, we study the difference in performance that arises when
they are applied in systematic and non-systematic ways. Using some reasonable
simplifying assumptions (as random mixing of human groups and the same mobility
for all life stages of head lice other than eggs) we model the contagion of
pediculosis using only one additional parameter. It is shown that this
parameter can be tuned to obtain collective infestations whose variables are
compatible with what is given in the literature on real infestations. We
analyze two scenarios: one where group members begin treatment when a similar
number of lice are present in each head, and another where there is one
individual who starts treatment with a much larger threshold ('superspreader').
For both cases we assess the impact of several collective strategies of
treatment.

presence of noise at the level of individual cells. In order to study these
phenomena in large-scale assemblies of neurons, we consider networks of
firing-rate neurons with linear intrinsic dynamics and nonlinear coupling,
belonging to a few types of cell populations and receiving noisy currents.
Asymptotic equations as the number of neurons tends to infinity (mean field
equations) are rigorously derived based on a probabilistic approach. These
equations are implicit on the probability distribution of the solutions which
generally makes their direct analysis difficult. However, in our case, the
solutions are Gaussian, and their moments satisfy a closed system of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are much easier to study than the
original stochastic network equations, and the statistics of the empirical
process uniformly converge towards the solutions of these ODEs. Based on this
description, we analytically and numerically study the influence of noise on
the collective behaviors, and compare these asymptotic regimes to simulations
of the network. We observe that the mean field equations provide an accurate
description of the solutions of the network equations for network sizes as
small as a few hundreds of neurons. In particular, we observe that the level of
noise in the system qualitatively modifies its collective behavior, producing
for instance synchronized oscillations of the whole network, desynchronization
of oscillating regimes, and stabilization or destabilization of stationary
solutions. These results shed a new light on the role of noise in shaping
collective dynamics of neurons, and gives us clues for understanding similar
phenomena observed in biological networks.

models, we found the motion of molecular motors is loosely coupled to the
chemical cycle. Only part of the input energy can be converted into mechanical
work. Others is dissipated into environment during substeps without
contributions to the macro scale unidirectional movement.

physiologically as a response to injury or pathologically in thrombosis. The
active participation of RBCs in thrombus solidification has been previously
proposed but not yet experimentally proven. Holographic optical tweezers and
single-cell force spectroscopy were used to study potential cell-cell adhesion
between RBCs. Irreversible intercellular adhesion of RBCs could be induced by
stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a compound known to be released
by activated platelets. We identified Ca2+ as an essential player in the
signaling cascade by directly inducing Ca2+ influx using A23187. Elevation of
the internal Ca2+ concentration leads to an intercellular adhesion of RBCs
similar to that induced by LPA stimulation. Using single-cell force
spectroscopy, the adhesion of the RBCs was identified to be approximately 100
pN, a value large enough to be of significance inside a blood clot or in
pathological situations like the vasco-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease
patients.

directly drives bottom-up processes that describe memory, attention, and other
neuronal processes. The top-down mechanism considered are macrocolumnar EEG
firings in neocortex, as described by a statistical mechanics of neocortical
interactions (SMNI), developed as a magnetic vector potential $\mathbf{A}$. The
bottom-up process considered are $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves prominent in synaptic
and extracellular processes that are considered to greatly influence neuronal
firings. Here, the complimentary effects are considered, i.e., the influence of
$\mathbf{A}$ on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ momentum, $\mathbf{p}$. The canonical
momentum of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, $\mathbf{\Pi} =
\mathbf{p} + q \mathbf{A}$ (SI units), is calculated, where the charge of
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is $q = - 2 e$, $e$ is the magnitude of the charge of an
electron. Calculations demonstrate that macroscopic EEG $\mathbf{A}$ can be
quite influential on the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, in
both classical and quantum mechanics. Molecular scales of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
wave dynamics are coupled with $\mathbf{A}$ fields developed at macroscopic
regional scales measured by coherent neuronal firing activity measured by scalp
EEG. The project has three main aspects: fitting $\mathbf{A}$ models to EEG
data as reported here, building tripartite models to develop $\mathbf{A}$
models, and studying long coherence times of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves in the
presence of $\mathbf{A}$ due to coherent neuronal firings measured by scalp
EEG. The SMNI model supports a mechanism wherein the $\mathbf{p} + q
\mathbf{A}$ interaction at tripartite synapses, via a dynamic centering
mechanism (DCM) to control background synaptic activity, acts to maintain
short-term memory (STM) during states of selective attention.

chemical reactions admit positive steady states regardless of network
deficiency and the choice of reaction rate constants. This result holds for
closed systems without material exchange across the boundary, as well as for
open systems with material exchange at rates that satisfy a simple sufficient
and necessary condition. Our proof uses a fixed point of a novel convex
optimization formulation to find the steady state behavior of chemical reaction
networks that satisfy the law of mass-action kinetics. A fixed point iteration
can be used to compute these steady states, and we show that it converges for
weakly reversible homogeneous systems. We report the results of our algorithm
on numerical experiments.

The units on the x-axis of Figure 1 were 'years' but

epidemic of HIV to an end lies in the use of anti-retroviral therapy for
prevention, a strategy referred to variously as Test and Treat (T&amp;T), Treatment
as Prevention (TasP) or Treatment centred Prevention (TcP). One of the key
objections to the use of T&amp;T to stop transmission concerns the role of the
acute phase in HIV transmission. The acute phase of infection lasts for one to
three months after HIV-seroconversion during which time the risk of
transmission may be ten to twenty times higher, per sexual encounter, than it
is during the chronic phase which lasts for the next ten years. Regular testing
for HIV is more likely to miss people who are in the acute phase than in the
chronic phase and it is essential to determine the extent to which this might
compromise the impact of T&amp;T on HIV-transmission.
  Here we show that 1) provided the initial epidemic doubling time is about 1.0
to 1.5 years, as observed in South Africa, random testing with an average test
interval of one year will still bring the epidemic close to elimination even if
the acute phase lasts for 3 months during which time transmission is 26 times
higher than in the chronic phase; 2) testing people regularly at yearly
intervals is significantly more effective then testing them randomly; 3)
testing people regularly at six monthly intervals and starting them on ART
immediately, will almost certainly guarantee elimination.
  In general it seems unlikely that elevated transmission during the acute
phase is likely to change predictions of the impact of treatment on
transmission significantly. Other factors, in particular age structure, the
structure of sexual networks and variation in set-point viral load are likely
to be more important and should be given priority in further analyses.

unknown. This paper presents a mathematical model which is able to predict the
entire trajectory of the HIV/AIDS dynamics, then a possible explanation for
this progression is examined. A dynamical analysis of this model reveals a set
of parameters which may produce two real equilibria in the model. One
equilibrium is stable and represents those individuals who have been living
with HIV for at least 7 to 9 years, and do not develop AIDS. The other one is
unstable and represents those patients who developed AIDS in an average period
of 10 years. However, further work is needed since the proposed model is
sensitive to parameter variations.

traffic of unconventional (single-headed) kinesin KIF1A [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
95}, 118101 (2005)], in which each motor can bind strongly or weakly to its
microtubule track, and each binding site of the track might be empty or
occupied by one motor. As the usual two-state model, i.e. the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with motor detachment and
attachment, in steady state of the system, this three-state model also exhibits
shock (or domain wall separating the high-density and low density phases) and
boundary layers. In this study, using mean-field analysis, the conditions of
existence of shock and boundary layers are obtained theoretically. Combined
with numerical calculations, the properties of shock are also studied. This
study will be helpful to understand the biophysical properties of the
collective transport of kinesin KIF1A.

lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and killer lymphocytes, and we model them as a
unique system by means of a tripartite network. Each part includes all the
different clones of the same lymphatic subpopulation, whose couplings to the
others are either excitatory or inhibitory (mirroring elicitation and
suppression by cytokine). First of all, we show that this system can be mapped
into an associative neural network, where helper cells directly interact with
each other and are able to secrete cytokines according to &quot;strategies&quot; learnt
by the system and profitable to cope with possible antigenic stimulation; the
ability of such a retrieval corresponds to a healthy reaction of the immune
system. We then investigate the possible conditions for the failure of a
correct retrieval and distinguish between the following outcomes: massive
lymphocyte expansion/suppression (e.g. lymphoproliferative syndromes),
subpopulation unbalance (e.g. HIV, EBV infections) and ageing (thought of as
noise growth); the correlation of such states to auto-immune diseases is also
highlighted. Lastly, we discuss how self-regulatory effects within each
effector branch (i.e. B and killer lymphocytes) can be modeled in terms of a
stochastic process, ultimately providing a consistent bridge between the
tripartite-network approach introduced here and the immune networks developed
in the last decades.

different contexts, particularly in ecology and systems biology. It can be used
to analyze the stability and bifurcations of steady-state solutions. Although
many dynamical systems in mathematical biology exhibit steady-state behaviour
one also wants to understand nonlocal dynamics beyond equilibrium points. In
this paper we analyze predator-prey dynamical systems and extend the method of
generalized models to periodic solutions. First, we adapt the equilibrium
generalized modeling approach and compute the unique Floquet multiplier of the
periodic solution which depends upon so-called generalized elasticity and scale
functions. We prove that these functions also have to satisfy a flow on
parameter (or moduli) space. Then we use Fourier analysis to provide computable
conditions for stability and the moduli space flow. The final stability
analysis reduces to two discrete convolutions which can be interpreted to
understand when the predator-prey system is stable and what factors enhance or
prohibit stable oscillatory behaviour. Finally, we provide a sampling algorithm
for parameter space based on nonlinear optimization and the Fast Fourier
Transform which enables us to gain a statistical understanding of the stability
properties of periodic predator-prey dynamics.

biodiversity in plant-animal mutualistic networks. This structural pattern has
been explained in a static (non-growth) network models. However, evolutionary
processes might also influence the formation of such a structural pattern. We
thereby propose an evolving network model for plant-animal interactions and
show that non-random patterns such as nested structure and heterogeneous
connectivity are both qualitatively and quantitatively predicted through simple
evolutionary processes. This finding implies that network models can be
simplified by considering evolutionary processes, and also that another
explanation exists for the emergence of non-random patterns and might provide
more comprehensible insights into the formation of plant-animal mutualistic
networks from the evolutionary perspective.

Especially, flavonoids, a kind of secondary metabolites, of plant species are
interesting examples. Since plant species are believed to have specific
flavonoids with respect to diverse environment, elucidation of design
principles of metabolite distributions across plant species is important to
understand metabolite diversity and plant evolution. In the previous work, we
found heterogeneous connectivity in metabolite distributions, and proposed a
simple model to explain a possible origin of heterogeneous connectivity. In
this paper, we show further structural properties in the metabolite
distribution among families inspired by analogy with plant-animal mutualistic
networks: nested structure and modular structure. An earlier model represents
that these structural properties in bipartite relationships are determined
based on traits of elements and external factors. However, we find that the
architecture of metabolite distributions is described by simple evolution
processes without trait-based mechanisms by comparison between our model and
the earlier model. Our model can better predict nested structure and modular
structure in addition to heterogeneous connectivity both qualitatively and
quantitatively. This finding implies an alternative possible origin of these
structural properties, and suggests simpler formation mechanisms of metabolite
distributions across plant species than expected.

molecular evolution. But what are the modes of sequence evolution leading to
rapid formation and loss of regulatory sites? Here, we show that a large
fraction of neighboring transcription factor binding sites in the fly genome
have formed from a common sequence origin by local duplications. This mode of
evolution is found to produce regulatory information: duplications can seed new
sites in the neighborhood of existing sites. Duplicate seeds evolve
subsequently by point mutations, often towards binding a different factor than
their ancestral neighbor sites. These results are based on a statistical
analysis of 346 cis-regulatory modules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,
and a comparison set of intergenic regulatory sequence in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In fly regulatory modules, pairs of binding sites show
significantly enhanced sequence similarity up to distances of about 50 bp. We
analyze these data in terms of an evolutionary model with two distinct modes of
site formation: (i) evolution from independent sequence origin and (ii)
divergent evolution following duplication of a common ancestor sequence. Our
results suggest that pervasive formation of binding sites by local sequence
duplications distinguishes the complex regulatory architecture of higher
eukaryotes from the simpler architecture of unicellular organisms.

  Application to Epidemiology</title><categories>math.ST q-bio.QM stat.ME stat.TH</categories><comments>Imperial College London PhD thesis</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Parameter ensembles or sets of random effects constitute one of the
cornerstones of modern statistical practice. This is especially the case in
Bayesian hierarchical models, where several decision theoretic frameworks can
be deployed. The estimation of these parameter ensembles may substantially vary
depending on which inferential goals are prioritised by the modeller. Since one
may wish to satisfy a range of desiderata, it is therefore of interest to
investigate whether some sets of point estimates can simultaneously meet
several inferential objectives. In this thesis, we will be especially concerned
with identifying ensembles of point estimates that produce good approximations
of (i) the true empirical quantiles and empirical quartile ratio (QR) and (ii)
provide an accurate classification of the ensemble's elements above and below a
given threshold. For this purpose, we review various decision-theoretic
frameworks, which have been proposed in the literature in relation to the
optimisation of different aspects of the empirical distribution of a parameter
ensemble. This includes the constrained Bayes (CB), weighted-rank squared error
loss (WRSEL), and triple-goal (GR) ensembles of point estimates. In addition,
we also consider the set of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the
ensemble of posterior means --the latter being optimal under the summed squared
error loss (SSEL). Firstly, we test the performance of these different sets of
point estimates as plug-in estimators for the empirical quantiles and empirical
QR under a range of synthetic scenarios encompassing both spatial and
non-spatial simulated data sets. Performance evaluation is here conducted using
the posterior regret. Secondly, two threshold classification losses (TCLs)
--weighted and unweighted-- are formulated and formally optimised. The
performance of these decision-theoretic tools is also evaluated on real data
sets.

  Statistical Institute (ISI) in Dublin</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Unraveling the evolutionary forces shaping bacterial diversity can today be
tackled using a growing amount of genomic data. While the genome of eukaryotes
is highly stable, bacterial genomes from cells of the same species highly vary
in gene content. This huge variation in gene content led to the concepts of the
distributed genome of bacteria and their pangenome (Tettelin et al.,2005;
Ehrlich et al.,2005). We present a population genetic model for gene content
evolution which accounts for several mechanisms. Gene uptake from the
environment is modeled by events of gene gain along the genealogical tree
relating the population. Pseudogenization may lead to deletion of genes and is
incoporated by gene loss. These two mechanisms were studied by Huson and Steel
(2004) using a fixed phylogenetic tree. Taking the random genealogy given by
the coalescent (Kingman, 1982; Hudson, 1983), we studied the resulting genomic
diversity already in Baumdicker et al. (2010). In the present paper, we extend
the model in order to incorporate events of interspecies horizontal gene
transfer. Within this model, we derive expectations for the gene frequency
spectrum and other quantities of interest.

Achieving a better characterization and understanding of these processes not
only is of academic interest but also of high relevance for medical
applications as, e.g., the determination of absorption rates of electromagnetic
radiation by the human body. The dielectric properties of human blood are
studied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, systematically investigating
the dependence on temperature and hematocrit value. By covering a frequency
range from 1 Hz to 40 GHz, information on all the typical dispersion regions of
biological matter is obtained. We find no evidence for a low-frequency
relaxation (alpha-relaxation) caused, e.g., by counterion diffusion effects as
reported for some types of biological matter. The analysis of a strong
Maxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the polarization of the cell membranes
in the 1-100 MHz region (beta-relaxation) allows for the test of model
predictions and the determination of various intrinsic cell properties. In the
microwave region beyond 1 GHz, the reorientational motion of water molecules in
the blood plasma leads to another relaxation feature (gamma-relaxation).
Between beta- and gamma-relaxation, significant dispersion is observed, which,
however, can be explained by a superposition of these relaxation processes and
is not due to an additional delta-relaxation often found in biological matter.
Our measurements provide dielectric data on human blood of so far unsurpassed
precision for a broad parameter range. All data are provided in electronic form
to serve as basis for the calculation of the absorption rate of electromagnetic
radiation and other medical purposes. Moreover, by investigating an
exceptionally broad frequency range, valuable new information on the dynamic
processes in blood is obtained.

resorption by osteoclasts in a single cortical basic multicellular unit (BMU).
Our model takes into account the interaction of osteoclasts with the bone
matrix, the interaction of osteoclasts with each other, the generation of
osteoclasts from a growing blood vessel, and the renewal of osteoclast nuclei
by cell fusion. All these features are shown to strongly influence the
geometrical properties of the developing resorption cavity including its size,
shape and progression rate, and are also shown to influence the distribution,
resorption pattern and trajectories of individual osteoclasts within the BMU.
We demonstrate that for certain parameter combinations, resorption cavity
shapes can be recovered from the computational model that closely resemble
resorption cavity shapes observed from microCT imaging of human cortical bone.

(mRNA) as the corresponding template, is called {\it translation}. Ribosome may
be regarded as a molecular motor for which the mRNA template serves also as the
track. Often several ribosomes may translate the same (mRNA) simultaneously.
The ribosomes bound simultaneously to a single mRNA transcript are the members
of a polyribosome (or, simply, {\it polysome}). Experimentally measured {\it
polysome profile} gives the distribution of polysome {\it sizes}. Recently a
breakthrough in determining the instantaneous {\it positions} of the ribosomes
on a given mRNA track has been achieved and the technique is called {\it
ribosome profiling} \cite{ingolia10,guo10}. Motivated by the success of these
techniques, we have studied the spatio-temporal organization of ribosomes by
extending a theoretical model that we have reported elsewhere \cite{sharma11}.
This extended version of our model incorporates not only (i) mechano-chemical
cycle of individual ribomes, and (ii) their steric interactions, but also (iii)
the effects of (a) kinetic proofreading, (b) translational infidelity, (c)
ribosome recycling, and (d) sequence inhomogeneities. The theoretical framework
developed here will serve in guiding further experiments and in analyzing the
data to gain deep insight into various kinetic processes involved in
translation.

interactions, that is globally coupled large families of dynamical systems on
the unit circle with non-trivial stochastic dynamics. Each isolated system is a
diffusion process on a circle, with drift -delta V', where V' is a periodic
function and delta is an intensity parameter. It is well known that the
interacting dynamics is accurately described, in the limit of infinitely many
interacting components, by a Fokker-Planck PDE and the model reduces for
delta=0 to a particular case of the Kuramoto synchronization model, for which
one can show the existence of a stable normally hyperbolic manifold of
stationary solutions for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (we are
interested in the case in which this manifold is non-trivial, that happens when
the interaction is sufficiently strong, that is in the synchronized regime of
the Kuramoto model). We use the robustness of normally hyperbolic structures to
infer qualitative and quantitative results on the |delta|&lt; delta0 cases, with
delta0 a suitable threshold: as a matter of fact, we obtain an accurate
description of the dynamics on the invariant manifold for delta=0 and we link
it explicitly to the potential V . This approach allows to have a complete
description of the phase diagram of the active rotators model, at least for
|delta|&lt; delta0, thus identifying for which values of the parameters (notably,
noise intensity and/or coupling strength) the system exhibits periodic pulse
waves or stabilizes at a quiescent resting state. Moreover, some of our results
are very explicit and this brings a new insight into the combined effect of
active rotator dynamics, noise and interaction. The links with the literature
on specific systems, notably neuronal models, are discussed in detail.

behaviour which results in a rapid invasion that infects a large number of

strategy that traverses larger distances by infecting fewer hosts. The model
can be mapped to a dynamical bond-percolation with spatial correlations that
affect the mechanism of spread but do not influence the critical behaviour of
epidemics.

and groups of neurons is under intense investigation throughout the nervous
system. A ubiquitous circuit feature that can give rise to such correlations
consists of overlapping, or common, inputs to pairs and populations of cells,
leading to common spike train responses. Here, we use computational tools to
study how the transfer of common input currents into common spike outputs is
modulated by the physiology of the recipient cells. We focus on a key
conductance - gA, for the A-type potassium current - which drives neurons
between &quot;Type II&quot; excitability (low gA), and &quot;Type I&quot; excitability (high gA).
Regardless of gA, cells transform common input fluctuations into a ten- dency
to spike nearly simultaneously. However, this process is more pronounced at low
gA values, as previously predicted by reduced &quot;phase&quot; models. Thus, for a given
level of common input, Type II neurons produce spikes that are relatively more
correlated over short time scales. Over long time scales, the trend reverses,
with Type II neurons producing relatively less correlated spike trains. This is
because these cells' increased tendency for simultaneous spiking is balanced by
opposing tendencies at larger time lags. We demonstrate a novel implication for
neural signal processing: downstream cells with long time constants are
selectively driven by Type I cell populations upstream, and those with short
time constants by Type II cell populations. Our results are established via
high-throughput numerical simulations, and explained via the cells' filtering
properties and nonlinear dynamics.

the study of complex systems. Several approaches to this problem have been
advanced, many framed in information-theoretic terms. Our treatment starts from
the complementary point of view of statistical modeling and prediction of
dynamical systems. It is known that for finite amounts of training data,
simpler models can have greater predictive power than more complex ones. We use
the trade-off between model simplicity and predictive accuracy to generate
optimal multiscale decompositions of dynamical networks into weakly-coupled,
simple modules. State-dependent and causal versions of our method are also
proposed.

scale-free networks for the evolution of cooperation. We show that Apollonian
Networks (ANs) are perfect scale-free networks, on which cooperation can spread
to all individuals, even though there are initially only 3 or 4 hubs occupied
by cooperators and all the others by defectors. Local topological features such
as degree, clustering coefficient, gradient as well as topology potential are
adopted to analyze the advantages of ANs in cooperation enhancement.
Furthermore, a degree-skeleton underlying ANs is uncovered for understanding
the cooperation diffusion. Constructing this kind degree-skeleton for random
scale-free networks promotes cooperation level close to that of
Barab\'asi-Albert networks, which gives deeper insights into the origin of the
latter on organization and further promotion of cooperation.

eukaryotic cells. These are driven by a chemical fuel, namely, adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). CREs actively participate in many cellular processes that
require accessibility of specific segments of DNA which are packaged as
chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is a nucleosome where 146 bp $\sim$ 50
nm of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is wrapped around a spool formed by histone
proteins. The helical path of histone-DNA contact on a nucleosome is also
called &quot;footprint&quot;. We investigate the mechanism of footprint traversal by a
CRE that translocates along the dsDNA. Our two-state model of a CRE captures
effectively two distinct chemical (or conformational) states in the
mechano-chemical cycle of each ATP-dependent CRE. We calculate the mean time of
traversal. Our predictions on the ATP-dependence of the mean traversal time can
be tested by carrying out {\it in-vitro} experiments on mono-nucleosomes.

cells. Based upon available experimental evidence we hypothesize that the
mechanism underlying such a phenomenon involves the interaction between a limit
cycle (originated by a delayed negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch
(originated by a positive feedback loop). With this hypothesis in mind we
construct the simplest possible model comprising both negative and positive
feedback loops and show that (with a suitable choice of paremeters): 1) it can
show an oscillatory behavior, 2) oscillations are arrested via an
infinite-period bifurcation whenever the different gene-expression
regulator-inputs act together in an additive rather than in a multiplicative
fashion, and 3) this mechanism for oscillation arrest is compatible whit
plentiful experimental observations.

compensated for by a second mutation which recovers the original phenotype.
Such epistatic interactions have implications for the structure of genome space
- namely, that networks of genomes encoding the same phenotype may not be
connected by single mutational moves. We use the folding of RNA sequences into
secondary structures as a model genotype-phenotype map and explore the neutral
spaces corresponding to networks of genotypes with the same phenotype. In most
of these networks, we find that it is not possible to connect all genotypes to
one another by single point mutations. Instead, a network for a phenotypic
structure with $n$ bonds typically fragments into at least $2^n$ neutral
components, often of similar size. While components of the same network
generate the same phenotype, they show important variations in their
properties, most strikingly in their evolvability and mutational robustness.
This heterogeneity implies contingency in the evolutionary process.

  spectroscopy: Characterizing kinetics under measurement uncertainty</title><categories>cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Single-molecule force spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool for
studying the kinetic behavior of biomolecules. Through application of an
external force, conformational states with small or transient populations can
be stabilized, allowing them to be characterized and the statistics of
individual trajectories studied to provide insight into biomolecular folding
and function. Because the observed quantity (force or extension) is not
necessarily an ideal reaction coordinate, individual observations cannot be
uniquely associated with kinetically distinct conformations. While
maximum-likelihood schemes such as hidden Markov models have solved this
problem for other classes of single-molecule experiments by using temporal
information to aid in the inference of a sequence of distinct conformational
states, these methods do not give a clear picture of how precisely the model
parameters are determined by the data due to instrument noise and finite-sample
statistics, both significant problems in force spectroscopy. We solve this
problem through a Bayesian extension that allows the experimental uncertainties
to be directly quantified, and build in detailed balance to further reduce
uncertainty through physical constraints. We illustrate the utility of this
approach in characterizing the three-state kinetic behavior of an RNA hairpin
in a stationary optical trap.

constants is seldom easy in practice. Numerous issues, such as the complication
of poor reaction coordinates, cause obvious approaches to yield unreliable
estimates. When a reliable order parameter is available, the reactive flux
theory of Chandler allows the rate constant to be extracted from the plateau
region of an appropriate reactive flux function. However, when applied to real
data from single-molecule experiments or molecular dynamics simulations, the
rate can sometimes be difficult to extract due to the numerical differentiation
of a noisy empirical correlation function or difficulty in locating the plateau
region at low sampling frequencies. We present a modified version of this
theory which does not require numerical derivatives, allowing rate constants to
be robustly estimated from the time-correlation function directly. We compare
these approaches using single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements of an
RNA hairpin.

  with delays</title><categories>math.DS q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The cortex is composed of large-scale cell assemblies sharing the same
individual properties and receiving the same input, in charge of certain
functions, and subject to noise. Such assemblies are characterized by specific
space locations and space-dependent delayed interactions. The mean-field
equations for such systems were rigorously derived in a recent paper for
general models, under mild assumptions on the network, using probabilistic
methods. We summarize and investigate general implications of this result. We
then address the dynamics of these stochastic neural field equations in the
case of firing-rate neurons. This is a unique case where the very complex
stochastic mean-field equations exactly reduce to a set of delayed differential
or integro-differential equations on the two first moments of the solutions,
this reduction being possible due to the Gaussian nature of the solutions. The
obtained equations differ from more customary approaches in that it
incorporates intrinsic noise levels nonlinearly and make explicit the
interaction between the mean activity and its correlations. We analyze the
dynamics of these equations, with a particular focus on the influence of noise
levels on shaping the collective response of neural assemblies and brain
states. Cascades of Hopf bifurcations are observed as a function of noise
amplitude, for noise levels small enough, and delays, in a finite-population
system. The presence of spatially homogeneous solutions in law is discussed in
different non-delayed neural fields and an instability, as noise amplitude is
varied, of the homogeneous state, is found. In these regimes, very complex
irregular and structured spatio-temporal patterns of activity are exhibited
including in particular wave or bump splitting.

reticulate evolution. Our algorithm for computing maximum acyclic agreement

rate} parameter value. A similar situation is found in the Gompertz law about
human mortality. However, growth can neither be infinite nor reach a finite
steady state at an infinite asymptotic time. Moreover before some decay, some
growth must have occurred. For example, some levelling-off could occur at
finite time, followed either by some growth again or then by some decay.
Numerous examples show that the Verhulst and Gompertz modelisations are too
reductive (or restrictive) descriptions of their original purpose. It is aimed,
in the present note, to encompass into ONE simple differential equation the
growth AND decay features of, e.g., population sizes, or numbers, but also of
many other measured characteristics found in social and physical science
systems. Previous generalisations of Verhulst or Gompertz functions are
recalled. It is shown that drastic growth or decay jumps or turnovers can be
readily described through drastic changes in values of the growth or decay
rate. However smoother descriptions can be found if the growth or decay rate is
modified in order to take into account some time or size dependence. Similar
arguments can be carried through, but not so easily, for the so called carrying
capacity, indeed leading to more elaborate algebraic work.

exerts spatiotemporal control of the somitic patterning has required a
combination of experimental and mathematical modeling strategies. Significant
progress has been made for the zebrafish clockwork. However, due to its
complexity, the clockwork of the amniote segmentation regulatory network has
not been fully elucidated. Here, we address the question of how oscillations
are arrested in the amniote segmentation clock. We do this by constructing a
minimal model of the regulatory network, which privileges architectural
information over molecular details. With a suitable choice of parameters, our
model is able to reproduce the oscillatory behavior of the Wnt, Notch and FGF
signaling pathways in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells. By introducing
positional information via a single Wnt3a gradient, we show that oscillations
are arrested following an infinite-period bifurcation. Notably: the
oscillations increase their amplitude as cells approach the anterior PSM and
remain in an upregulated state when arrested; the transition from the
oscillatory regime to the upregulated state exhibits hysteresis; and an
opposing distribution of the Fgf8 and RA gradients in the PSM arises naturally
in our simulations. We hypothesize that the interaction between a limit cycle
(originated by the Notch delayed-negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch
(originated by the Wnt-Notch positive cross-regulation) is responsible for the
observed segmentation patterning. Our results agree with previously unexplained
experimental observations and suggest a simple plausible mechanism for
spatiotemporal control of somitogenesis in amniotes.

neuron oscillators. We focus on the design of minimum-power current stimuli
that elicit spikes in neurons at desired times. We furthermore take the
charge-balanced constraint into account because in practice undesirable side
effects may occur due to the accumulation of electric charge resulting from
external stimuli. Charge-balanced minimum-power controls are derived for a
general phase model using the maximum principle, where the cases with unbounded
and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of practical
importance since phase models are more accurate for weak forcing. The developed
optimal control strategies are then applied to both mathematically ideal and
experimentally observed phase models to demonstrate their applicability,
including the phase model for the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

biological world. It is the information center behind all vertebrate and most
invertebrate life, and thus has become a major focus in current research. While
many of these studies have concentrated on studying the brain directly, our
focus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected
network of nodes (neurons). A better understanding of the structural aspects of
the brain should elucidate some of its functional properties. In this paper we
analyze the brain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Consisting of only
302 neurons, it is one of the better-understood neural networks. Using a
Laplacian matrix of the 279-neuron &quot;giant component&quot; of the network, we use an
eigenvalue counting function to look for fractal-like self similarity. This
matrix representation is also used to plot (in eigenfunction coordinates) both
2 and 3 dimensional visualizations of the neural network. Further analysis
examines the small-world properties of the system, including average path
length and clustering coefficient. We then test for localization of
eigenfunctions, using graph energy and spacial variance. To better understand
these results, all of these calculations are also performed on random networks,
branching trees, and known fractals, as well as fractals which have been
&quot;rewired&quot; to have small-world properties. This analysis is one of many
stepping-stones in the research of neural networks. While many of the
structures and functions within the brain are known, understanding how the two
interact is also important. A firmer grasp on the structural properties of the
neural network is a key step in this process

on matter interactions using lagrangian approach and imposing certain symmetry
breaking is proposed. Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected
non-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional
\phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein
representing the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions
between individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is
determined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the
protein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in
some previous works.

selection, but extracting this information for short, widely scattered
noncoding elements remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a new
computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural
Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT
uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and
divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites,
pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for
variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method
is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and
positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism
and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup
genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to
genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure
into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are
estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT
can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex
demographic scenarios. We apply our methods to noncoding RNAs, promoter
regions, and transcription factor binding sites in the human genome, and find
clear evidence of natural selection. We also present a detailed analysis of
particular nucleotide positions within GATA2 binding sites and primary
micro-RNA transcripts.

Prior to experimental evidence of the cornea's gradient refractive index (GRIN)
nature, schematic eye models used a constant or average as the corneal
refractive index. A few recent models respect the intra-corneal GRIN, but are
based on the paraxial approximation, and thereby have limited validity in
peripheral visual field analysis and non-paraxial photon tracking. Here, we
introduce the Trajectron algorithm. It uses a closed form solution of the ray
equation of constant axial GRIN media, and evaluates over piece-wise constant
GRIN. Using Trajectron, we present the first quantitative demonstration of
non-paraxial intra-corneal light-bending phenomena. This demonstration has
significant implications in the development of refractive surgery algorithms.

  nuclear shuttling</title><categories>q-bio.CB</categories><comments>19 pages, 7 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins is involved in
regulating cellular fate activities such as proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis. Their fundamental importance has attracted considerable attention on
different aspects of the MAPK signaling dynamics; this is particularly true for
the Erk/Mek system, which has become the canonical example for MAPK signaling
systems. Erk exists in many different isoforms, of which the most widely
studied are Erk1 and Erk2. Until recently, these two kinases were considered
equivalent as they differ only subtly at the sequence level; however, these
isoforms exhibit radically different trafficking between cytoplasm and nucleus.
Here we use spatially resolved data on Erk1/2 to develop and analyze
spatio-temporal models of these cascades; and we discuss how sensitivity
analysis can be used to discriminate between mechanisms. We are especially
interested in understanding why two such similar proteins should co-exist in
the same organism, as their functional roles appear to be different. Our models
elucidate some of the factors governing the interplay between processes and the
Erk1/2 localization in different cellular compartments, including competition
between isoforms. This methodology is applicable to a wide range of systems,
such as activation cascades, where translocation of species occurs via signal
pathways. Furthermore, our work may motivate additional emphasis for
considering potentially different roles for isoforms that differ subtly at the
sequence level.

constrained by function and three-dimensional (3D) structure. Residues in
spatial proximity tend to co-evolve, yet attempts to invert the evolutionary
record to identify these constraints and use them to computationally fold
proteins have so far been unsuccessful. Here, we show that co-variation of
residue pairs, observed in a large protein family, provides sufficient
information to determine 3D protein structure. Using a data-constrained maximum
entropy model of the multiple sequence alignment, we identify pairs of
statistically coupled residue positions which are expected to be close in the
protein fold, termed contacts inferred from evolutionary information (EICs). To
assess the amount of information about the protein fold contained in these
coupled pairs, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted 3D structures for proteins
of 50-260 residues, from 15 diverse protein families, including a G-protein
coupled receptor. These structure predictions are de novo, i.e., they do not
use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The
resulting low C{\alpha}-RMSD error range of 2.7-5.1{\AA}, over at least 75% of
the protein, indicates the potential for predicting essentially correct 3D
structures for the thousands of protein families that have no known structure,
provided they include a sufficiently large number of divergent sample
sequences. With the current enormous growth in sequence information based on
new sequencing technology, this opens the door to a comprehensive survey of
protein 3D structures, including many not currently accessible to the
experimental methods of structural genomics. This advance has potential
applications in many biological contexts, such as synthetic biology,
identification of functional sites in proteins and interpretation of the
functional impact of genetic variants.

computational problems, in particular in the presence of paralogous proteins.
Available approaches aim to identify interaction partners among protein/domain
families through maximizing the similarity between trimmed versions of their
phylogenetic trees. Since maximization of any natural similarity score is
computationally difficult, many approaches employ heuristics to maximize the
distance matrices corresponding to the tree topologies in question. In this
paper we devise an efficient deterministic algorithm which directly maximizes
the similarity between two leaf labeled trees with edge lengths, obtaining a
score-optimal alignment of the two trees in question.
  Our algorithm is significantly faster than those methods based on distance
matrix comparison: 1 minute on a single processor vs. 730 hours on a
supercomputer. Furthermore we have advantages over the current state-of-the-art
heuristic search approach in terms of precision as well as a recently suggested
overall performance measure for mirrortree approaches, while incurring only
acceptable losses in recall.

different signaling processes. These signaling processes strongly differ in
type with TGFb ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members
of the TGFb family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then
be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand
concentration. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications
that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling
network. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the
core of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we
identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give
rise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as
well as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to
time-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens).
A combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus
biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while
oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the
turn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient
receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding.
We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the
response type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed
signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGFb ligand in
different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with
differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective
rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

inhibitors which have the potential for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Many
antibodies have been generated for this purpose, and the objective of this
study was to develop a simple mathematical model that may be used to evaluate
the potential protective effect of antibodies. This model was used to evaluate
the contributions of antibody affinity and concentration to reducing
antibody-receptor complex formation and internalization. The model also enables
prediction of the antibody kinetic constants and concentration required to
provide a specified degree of protection. We hope that this model, once
validated experimentally, will be a useful tool for in vitro selection of
potentially protective antibodies for progression to in vivo evaluation.

  (published)</comments><doi>10.1007/s10827-010-0279-7</doi><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/</license><abstract>  In this paper, we systematically investigate both the synfire propagation and
firing rate propagation in feedforward neuronal network coupled in an
all-to-all fashion. In contrast to most earlier work, where only reliable
synaptic connections are considered, we mainly examine the effects of
unreliable synapses on both types of neural activity propagation in this work.
We first study networks composed of purely excitatory neurons. Our results show
that both the successful transmission probability and excitatory synaptic
strength largely influence the propagation of these two types of neural
activities, and better tuning of these synaptic parameters makes the considered
network support stable signal propagation. It is also found that noise has
significant but different impacts on these two types of propagation. The
additive Gaussian white noise has the tendency to reduce the precision of the
synfire activity, whereas noise with appropriate intensity can enhance the
performance of firing rate propagation. Further simulations indicate that the
propagation dynamics of the considered neuronal network is not simply
determined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron
in a time instant, but also largely influenced by the stochastic effect of
neurotransmitter release. Second, we compare our results with those obtained in
corresponding feedforward neuronal networks connected with reliable synapses
but in a random coupling fashion. We confirm that some differences can be
observed in these two different feedforward neuronal network models. Finally,
we study the signal propagation in feedforward neuronal networks consisting of
both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and demonstrate that inhibition also
plays an important role in signal propagation in the considered networks.

using one or both of two measures: the spectral count, derived from the
identification of MS/MS spectra, or some measure of ion abundance derived from
the LC-MS data. Here we contrast the performance of these measures and show
that ion abundance is the more sensitive. We also examine how the conclusions
of a comparative analysis are influenced by the manner in which the LC-MS/MS
data is `rolled up' to the protein level, and show that divergent conclusions
obtained using different rollups can be informative. Our analysis is based on
two publicly available reference data sets, BIATECH-54 and CPTAC, which were
developed for the purpose of assessing methods used in label-free differential
proteomic studies. We find that the use of the ion abundance measure reveals
properties of both data sets not readily apparent using the spectral count.

of energy transport at room temperature in Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic
complexes. The excitation energy transfer due to the coupling of the light
harvesting complex to the reaction center (&quot;sink&quot;) is analyzed using an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that, as the coupling to the
reaction center is varied, maximal efficiency in energy transport is achieved
in the vicinity of the superradiance transition, characterized by a segregation
of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the sink (which
provides a quasi--continuum in the energy spectrum) is the dominant effect in
the energy transfer which takes place even in absence of a thermal bath. This
approach allows one to study the effects of finite temperature and the effects
of any coupling scheme to the reaction center. Moreover, taking into account a
realistic electric dipole interaction, we show that the optimal distance from
the reaction center to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson system occurs at the
superradiance transition, and we show that this is consistent with available
experimental data.

processes occur simultaneously. For uncorrelated networks under the assumption
of standard incidence transmission, we compute the disease-free equilibrium and
the basic reproduction number, and show that the disease-free equilibrium is
locally asymptotically stable. Moreover, for uncorrelated networks and under

  The existence of endemic equilibria is also discussed. Finally, the
prevalence of the TB infection across the metapopulation as a function of the

the topological features of idiotypic networks, namely the interaction networks
involving the B-core of the immune system. Each node is endowed with a
bit-string representing the idiotypic specificity of the corresponding B cell
and a proper distance between any couple of bit-strings provides the coupling
strength between the two nodes. We show that a biased distribution of the
entries in bit-strings can yield fringes in the (weighted) degree distribution,
small-worlds features, and scaling laws, in agreement with experimental
findings. We also investigate the role of ageing, thought of as a progressive
increase in the degree of bias in bit-strings, and we show that it can possibly
induce mild percolation phenomena, which are investigated too.

  Simulations of sliding-helix mechanisms</title><categories>q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Electrical signaling via voltage-gated ion channels depends upon the function
of the voltage sensor (VS), identified with the S1-S4 domain of voltage-gated K
channels. Here we investigate some physical aspects of the sliding-helix model
of the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear dielectrics and
whole-body motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions
are solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical
consequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain
insight into the sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured
ensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage.
Those consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for variations of:
S4 configuration ({\alpha}- and 3(10)-helical), intrinsic counter-charges,
protein polarizability, geometry of the gating canal, screening of S4 charges
by the baths, and protein charges located at the bath interfaces. We find that
the sliding helix VS has an inherent electrostatic stability and its function
as a VS is robust in the parameter space explored. Maximal charge displacement
is limited by geometry, specifically the range of movement where S4 charges and
counter-charges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. The steepness of
charge rearrangement in the physiological voltage range is sensitive to the
landscape of electrostatic energy: energy differences of &lt;2 kT have substantial
consequences. Such variations of energy landscape are produced by all
variations of model features tested. The amount of free energy per unit voltage
that a sliding-helix VS can deliver to other parts of the channel (conductance
voltage sensitivity) is limited by both the maximal displaced charge and the
steepness of charge redistribution by voltage (sensor voltage sensitivity).

  Electrostatics of the Voltage Sensor</title><categories>q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</license><abstract>  Voltage-gated ion channels mediate electrical excitability of cellular
membranes. Reduced models of the voltage sensor (VS) of Kv channels produce
insight into the electrostatic physics underlying the response of the highly
positively charged S4 transmembrane domain to changes in membrane potential and
other electrostatic parameters. By calculating the partition function computed
from the electrostatic energy over translational and/or rotational degrees of
freedom, I compute expectations of charge displacement, energetics, probability
distributions of translation &amp; rotation and Maxwell stress for arrangements of
S4 positively charged residues; these computations can then be compared with
experimental results to elucidate the role of various putative atomic level
features of the VS. A `paddle' model is rejected on electrostatic grounds,
owing to unfavorable energetics, insufficient charge displacement and excessive
Maxwell stress. On the other hand, a `sliding helix' model with three local
counter-charges, a protein dielectric coefficient of 4 and a 2/3 interval of
counter-charge positioning relative to the S4-helix period of positive residues
is electrostatically reasonable, comparing well with Shaker (Seoh et al.,
1996). Lack of counter-charges destabilizes the S4 in the membrane;
counter-charge interval helps determine the number and shape of energy barriers
and troughs over the range of motion of the S4; and the local dielectric
coefficient of the protein constrains the height of energy maxima. These
`sliding helix' models compare favorably with experimental results for single &amp;
double mutant charge experiments on Shaker. Single S4 positive charge mutants
are predicted quite well by this model; single counter-charge mutants are
predicted less well; and double mutants for both an S4 charge and a
counter-charge are characterized least well.

as a result, leave a signature of these changes in individual genomes in the
population. We are interested in the inverse problem of reconstructing past
population dynamics from genomic data. We start with a standard framework based
on the coalescent, a stochastic process that generates genealogies connecting
randomly sampled individuals from the population of interest. These genealogies
serve as a glue between the population demographic history and genomic
sequences. It turns out that only the times of genealogical lineage
coalescences contain information about population size dynamics. Viewing these
coalescent times as a point process, estimating population size trajectories is
equivalent to estimating a conditional intensity of this point process.
Therefore, our inverse problem is similar to estimating an inhomogeneous
Poisson process intensity function. We demonstrate how recent advances in
Gaussian process-based nonparametric inference for Poisson processes can be
extended to Bayesian nonparametric estimation of population size dynamics under
the coalescent. We compare our Gaussian process (GP) approach to one of the
state of the art Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) methods for estimating
population trajectories. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our method
has better accuracy and precision. Next, we analyze two genealogies
reconstructed from real sequences of hepatitis C and human Influenza A viruses.
In both cases, we recover more believed aspects of the viral demographic
histories than the GMRF approach. We also find that our GP method produces more
reasonable uncertainty estimates than the GMRF method.

bone resorption and bone formation. This coordination is achieved by a network
of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast
lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of
signalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of
experimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper
understanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a
mathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to
include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This
inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to
play an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased
rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of
proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone
mass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new
model to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt
signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells
by transforming growth factor \beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the
new model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to
bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to
release some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone
remodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal
signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to
either bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model
developed here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the
evolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone
microenvironment

Based on continuous-time model developed by Holland and DeAngelis 2009 for

of the Mickens Non Standard Finite Difference method to transform the

the step-sizes used in numerical simulations, in opposition of the forward
Euler method that shows numerical instabilities when the step size overcomes a
critical value.

  function of growth rate</title><categories>q-bio.GN</categories><journal-ref>BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:201</journal-ref><doi>10.1186/1752-0509-5-201</doi><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Background: In Escherichia coli, overlapping rounds of DNA replication allow
the bacteria to double in faster times than the time required to copy the
genome. The precise timing of initiation of DNA replication is determined by a
regulatory circuit that depends on the binding of a critical number of
ATP-bound DnaA proteins at the origin of replication. The synthesis of DnaA in
the cell is controlled by a growth-rate dependent, negatively autoregulated
gene found near the origin of replication. Both the regulatory and initiation
activity of DnaA depend on its nucleotide bound state and its availability.
  Results: In order to investigate the contributions of the different
regulatory processes to the timing of initiation of DNA replication at varying
growth rates, we formulate a minimal quantitative model of the initiator
circuit that includes the key ingredients known to regulate the activity of the
DnaA protein. This model describes the average-cell oscillations in
DnaA-ATP/DNA during the cell cycle, for varying growth rates. We evaluate the
conditions under which this ratio attains the same threshold value at the time
of initiation, independently of the growth rate.
  Conclusions: We find that a quantitative description of replication
initiation by DnaA must rely on the dependency of the basic parameters on
growth rate, in order to account for the timing of initiation of DNA
replication at different cell doubling times. We isolate two main possible
scenarios for this. One possibility is that the basal rate of regulatory
inactivation by ATP hydrolysis must vary with growth rate. Alternatively, some
parameters defining promoter activity need to be a function of the growth rate.
In either case, the basal rate of gene expression needs to increase with the
growth rate, in accordance with the known characteristics of the dnaA promoter.

involved classical behavior alone. Furthermore, we also find that the quantum
resonance condition is easier to be fulfilled in multiple pathways than that in
one pathway. We then definitely demonstrate that the optimal distribution of
the pigments, the multitude of energy delivery pathways and the quantum
effects, are combined together to contribute to the perfect energy transport in
the FMO complex.

relatives of a certain individual. It is well known that in order to evaluate
the genetic evidence in favour of a certain given form of relatedness between
two individuals, one needs to calculate the appropriate likelihood ratio, which
is in this context called a Kinship Index. Suppose that the database contains,
for a given type of relative, at most one related individual. Given prior
probabilities for being the relative for all persons in the database, we derive
the likelihood ratio for each database member in favour of being that relative.
This likelihood ratio takes all the Kinship Indices between the target
individual and the members of the database into account. We also compute the
corresponding posterior probabilities. We then discuss two methods to select a
subset from the database that contains the relative with a known probability,
or at least a useful lower bound thereof. One method needs prior probabilities
and yields posterior probabilities, the other does not. We discuss the relation
between the approaches, and illustrate the methods with familial searching
carried out in the Dutch National DNA Database.

the spatial Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that players choosing to cooperate or
not on the basis of their previous action and the actions of their neighbors
coexist with steady defectors and cooperators. We here study the coexistence of
these three strategies in the multiplayer iterated Prisoner's Dilemma by means
of the replicator dynamics. We consider groups with n = 2, 3, 4 and 5 players
and compute the payoffs to every type of player as the limit of a Markov chain
where the transition probabilities between actions are found from the
corresponding strategies. We show that for group sizes up to n = 4 there exists
an interior point in which the three strategies coexist, the corresponding
basin of attraction decreasing with increasing number of players, whereas we
have not been able to locate such a point for n = 5. We analytically show that
in the infinite n limit no interior points can arise. We conclude by discussing
the implications of this theoretical approach on the behavior observed in
experiments.

coherent for long times at room temperatures, one of the fundamental puzzles of
quantum biology. We show that systems with the right level of complexity
between chaos and regularity can increase their coherence time by orders of
magnitude. Systems near Critical Quantum Chaos or Metal-Insulator Transition
(MIT) can have long coherence times and coherent transport at the same time.
The new theory tested in a realistic light harvesting system model can
reproduce the scaling of critical fluctuations reported in recent experiments.
Scaling of return probability in the FMO light harvesting complex shows the
signs of universal return probability decay observed at critical MIT. The
results may open up new possibilities to design low loss energy and information
transport systems in this Poised Realm hovering reversibly between quantum
coherence and classicality.

neurons in which neuronal input-output functions are power laws with a power
greater than 1, as observed in primary visual cortex. This supralinear
input-output function leads to supralinear summation of network responses to
multiple inputs for weak inputs. We show that for stronger inputs, which would
drive the excitatory subnetwork to instability, the network will dynamically
stabilize provided feedback inhibition is sufficiently strong. For a wide range
of network and stimulus parameters, this dynamic stabilization yields a
transition from supralinear to sublinear summation of network responses to
multiple inputs. We compare this to the dynamic stabilization in the &quot;balanced
network&quot;, which yields only linear behavior. We more exhaustively analyze the
2-dimensional case of 1 excitatory and 1 inhibitory population. We show that in
this case dynamic stabilization will occur whenever the determinant of the
weight matrix is positive and the inhibitory time constant is sufficiently
small, and analyze the conditions for &quot;supersaturation&quot;, or decrease of firing
rates with increasing stimulus contrast (which represents increasing input
firing rates). In work to be presented elsewhere, we have found that this
transition from supralinear to sublinear summation can explain a wide variety
of nonlinearities in cerebral cortical processing.

of human genetic variation. Despite the advances in sequencing speeds, the
computational discovery of structural variants is not yet standard. It is
likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced
individuals. Here we present a novel internal segment size based approach,
which organizes all, including also concordant reads into a read alignment
graph where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of
alignments. A specifically engineered algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques
and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or
deletions (indels). For the first time in the literature, we compare a large
range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a
fully annotated genome and present various relevant performance statistics. We
achieve superior performance rates in particular on indels of sizes 20--100,
which have been exposed as a current major challenge in the SV discovery
literature and where prior insert size based approaches have limitations. In
that size range, we outperform even split read aligners. We achieve good
results also on real data where we make a substantial amount of correct
predictions as the only tool, which complement the predictions of split-read
aligners. CLEVER is open source (GPL) and available from

atom classical and quantum simulations to study the binding of small
interfering RNA (siRNA) by pristine single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT). Our
results show that siRNA strongly binds to SWCNT surface via unzipping its
base-pairs and the propensity of unzipping increases with the increase in the
diameter of the SWCNTs. The unzipping and subsequent wrapping events are
initiated and driven by van der Waals interactions between the aromatic rings
of siRNA nucleobases and the SWCNT surface. However, MD simulations of double
strand DNA (dsDNA) of the same sequence show that the dsDNA undergoes much less
unzipping and wrapping on the SWCNT in the simulation time scale of 70 ns. This
interesting difference is due to smaller interaction energy of thymidine of
dsDNA with the SWCNT compared to that of uridine of siRNA, as calculated by
dispersion corrected density functional theory (DFT) methods. After the optimal
binding of siRNA to SWCNT, the complex is very stable which serves as one of
the major mechanisms of siRNA delivery for biomedical applications. Since siRNA
has to undergo unwinding process with the effect of RNA- induced silencing
complex, our proposed delivery mechanism by SWCNT possesses potential
advantages in achieving RNA interference (RNAi).

Which is better
for saving lives and limiting black market use, the present altruistic system
of donations or a free and open sales market? I explain that there is a risk
with maintaining the present system, the altruistic vision, and that people may
die who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is
no guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current
supply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to
discussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to
increase organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and
explicit consent. Ultimately, I conclude that the altruistic donation system,
bolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate
financial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of
its shortcomings.

of a voltage sensor (VS), identified with the S1-S4 domain in voltage-gated K+
channels. Here we investigate some energetic aspects of the sliding-helix model
of the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear dielectrics and
whole-body motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions
are solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical
consequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain
insight into the sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured
ensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage.
Those consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for two alternate
S4 configurations, \alpha- and 3(10)-helical. Both forms of VS are found to
have an inherent electrostatic stability. Maximal charge displacement is
limited by geometry, specifically the range of movement where S4 charges and
counter-charges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. Charge displacement
responds more steeply to voltage in the \alpha-helical than the 3(10)-helical
sensor. This difference is due to differences on the order of 0.1 eV in the
landscapes of electrostatic energy. As a step toward integrating these VS
models into a full-channel model, we include a hypothetical external load in
the Hamiltonian of the system and analyze the energetic in/output relation of
the VS.

is active due a permanent distribution of stresslets along its contour. A
bending instability of an initially straight filament spontaneously breaks flow
symmetry and leads to autonomous filament motion which, depending on
conformational symmetry, can be translational or rotational. At high ratios of
activity to elasticity, the linear instability develops into nonlinear
fluctuating states with large amplitude deformations. The dynamics of these
states can be qualitatively understood as a superposition of translational and
rotational motion associated with filament conformational modes of opposite
symmetry. Our results can be tested in molecular-motor filament mixtures,
synthetic chains of autocatalytic particles, or other linearly connected
systems where chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy in a fluid
environment.

receivers distributed in a fluidic medium. In such networks, a transmitter
sends one or more signalling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to
the receiver to realise the communication. In order to be able to engineer
synthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these
networks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular
communication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous
input (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time
series of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and
chemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using
master equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model
molecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For
the case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how
RDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output
signals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal
of the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal
of a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers. Numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the model.

  The Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) is the foundation of many algorithms for
compression and indexing of text data, but the cost of computing the BWT of
very large string collections has prevented these techniques from being widely
applied to the large sets of sequences often encountered as the outcome of DNA
sequencing experiments. In previous work, we presented a novel algorithm that
allows the BWT of human genome scale data to be computed on very moderate
hardware, thus enabling us to investigate the BWT as a tool for the compression
of such datasets.
  Results
  We first used simulated reads to explore the relationship between the level
of compression and the error rate, the length of the reads and the level of
sampling of the underlying genome and compare choices of second-stage
compression algorithm.
  We demonstrate that compression may be greatly improved by a particular
reordering of the sequences in the collection and give a novel `implicit
sorting' strategy that enables these benefits to be realised without the
overhead of sorting the reads. With these techniques, a 45x coverage of real
human genome sequence data compresses losslessly to under 0.5 bits per base,
allowing the 135.3Gbp of sequence to fit into only 8.2Gbytes of space (trimming
a small proportion of low-quality bases from the reads improves the compression
still further).
  This is more than 4 times smaller than the size achieved by a standard
BWT-based compressor (bzip2) on the untrimmed reads, but an important further
advantage of our approach is that it facilitates the building of compressed
full text indexes such as the FM-index on large-scale DNA sequence collections.

suspension. For example, viscous and gravitational torques bias bottom-heavy
cells to swim towards regions of downwelling fluid (gyrotaxis). It is necessary
to understand how such biases affect algal dispersion in natural and industrial
flows, especially in view of growing interest in algal photobioreactors.
Motivated by this, we here study the dispersion of gyrotactic algae in laminar
and turbulent channel flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the
analytical swimming dispersion theory of Bees and Croze (2010). Time-resolved
dispersion measures are evaluated as functions of the Peclet and Reynolds
numbers in upwelling and downwelling flows. For laminar flows, DNS results are
compared with theory using competing descriptions of biased swimming cells in
shear flow. Excellent agreement is found for predictions that employ
generalized-Taylor-dispersion. The results highlight peculiarities of
gyrotactic swimmer dispersion relative to passive tracers. In laminar
downwelling flow the cell distribution drifts in excess of the mean flow,
increasing in magnitude with Peclet number. The cell effective axial
diffusivity increases and decreases with Peclet number (for tracers it merely
increases). In turbulent flows, gyrotactic effects are weaker, but discernable
and manifested as non-zero drift. These results should significantly impact
photobioreactor design.

acting on a large number of loci, each having a weak phenotypic effect. One way
to detect these loci is to identify genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high
correlation with environmental variables used as proxies for ecological
pressures. Here, we propose new algorithms based on population genetics,
ecological modeling, and statistical learning techniques to screen genomes for
signatures of local adaptation. Implemented in the computer program &quot;latent
factor mixed model&quot; (LFMM), these algorithms employ an approach in which
population structure is introduced using unobserved variables. These fast and
computationally efficient algorithms detect correlations between environmental
and genetic variation while simultaneously inferring background levels of
population structure. Comparing these new algorithms with related methods
provides evidence that LFMM can efficiently estimate random effects due to
population history and isolation-by-distance patterns when computing
gene-environment correlations, and decrease the number of false-positive
associations in genome scans. We then apply these models to plant and human
genetic data, identifying several genes with functions related to development
that exhibit strong correlations with climatic gradients.

perturbations. We investigate a coupled map network as a model motivated by
gene regulatory networks and design systems which are robust against phenotypic
perturbations (perturbations in dynamics), as well as systems which are robust
against mutation (perturbations in network structure). To achieve such a
design, we apply a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Analysis based on the
maximum Lyapunov exponent and parameter sensitivity shows that systems with
marginal stability, which are regarded as systems at the edge of chaos, emerge
when robustness against network perturbations is required. This emergence of
the edge of chaos is a self-organization phenomenon and does not need a fine
tuning of parameters.

processively along microtubule (MT), and also detach from or attach to MT
stochastically. Experiments have found that, the traffic of motor might be
jammed, and various theoretical models have been designed to understand this
traffic jam phenomenon. But previous studies mainly focus on motor
attachment/detachment rate dependent properties. Recent experiment of Leduc
{\it et al.} found that the traffic jam formation of motor protein kinesin
depends also on the length of MT [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. {\bf 109},
6100-6105 (2012)]. In this study, the MT length dependent properties of motor
traffic will be analyzed. We found that MT length has one {\it critical value}
$N_c$, traffic jam occurs only when MT length $N&gt;N_c$. The jammed length of MT
increases with total MT length, while the non-jammed MT length might not change
monotonically with the total MT length. The critical value $N_c$ increases with
motor detachment rate from MT, but decreases with motor attachment rate to MT.

primary tumor and accelerate growth: Primary Seeding, where cells from a
primary tumor shed into the vasculature and return back to the primary
themselves; and Secondary Seeding, where cells from the primary first
metastasize in a secondary tissue and form microscopic secondary deposits,
which then shed cells into the vasculature returning to the primary. These two
models are difficult to distinguish experimentally, yet the differences between
them is of great importance to both our understanding of the metastatic process
and also for designing methods of intervention. Therefore we developed a
mathematical model to test the relative likelihood of these two phenomena in
the subset of tumours whose shed CTCs first encounter the lung capillary bed,
and show that Secondary Seeding is several orders of magnitude more likely than
Primary seeding. We suggest how this difference could affect tumour evolution,
progression and therapy, and propose several possible methods of experimental
validation.

develop a regular pattern of heterocyst cells that fix nitrogen for the
remaining vegetative cells. We examine three different heterocyst placement
strategies by quantitatively modelling filament growth while varying both
external fixed-nitrogen and leakage from the filament. We find that there is an
optimum heterocyst frequency which maximizes the growth rate of the filament;
the optimum frequency decreases as the external fixed-nitrogen concentration
increases but increases as the leakage increases. In the presence of leakage,
filaments implementing a local heterocyst placement strategy grow significantly
faster than filaments implementing random heterocyst placement strategies. With
no extracellular fixed-nitrogen, consistent with recent experimental studies of
Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the modelled heterocyst spacing distribution using our
local heterocyst placement strategy is qualitatively similar to experimentally
observed patterns. As external fixed-nitrogen is increased, the spacing
distribution for our local placement strategy retains the same shape while the
average spacing between heterocysts continuously increases.

  Population Structure Correction</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.GN q-bio.QM stat.AP</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Exploring the genetic basis of heritable traits remains one of the central
challenges in biomedical research. In simple cases, single polymorphic loci
explain a significant fraction of the phenotype variability. However, many
traits of interest appear to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of
genetic loci instead. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is
nontrivial and often hindered by limited power. At the same time, confounding
influences such as population structure cause spurious association signals that
result in false positive findings if they are not accounted for in the model.
Here, we propose LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both, multi-locus
mapping and correction for confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free
of tuning parameters, effectively controls for population structure and scales
to genome-wide datasets. We show practical use in genome-wide association
studies and linkage mapping through retrospective analyses. In data from
Arabidopsis thaliana and mouse, our method is able to find a genetic cause for
significantly greater fractions of phenotype variation in 91% of the phenotypes
considered. At the same time, our model dissects this variability into
components that result from individual SNP effects and population structure. In
addition to this increase of genetic heritability, enrichment of known
candidate genes suggests that the associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are more
likely to be genuine.

permeating through the cell membrane. Ion flux across the cell membrane is
mediated by special proteins forming specific channels. The structure of
potassium channels have been widely studied in recent years with remarkable
results: very precise measurements of the true current across a single channel
are now available. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the behavior of
the channel is still lacking, though molecular dynamics and kinetic models have
provided partial insights. In this paper we demonstrate, by analyzing the KcsA
current-voltage currents via a suitable lattice model, that intracellular
diffusion plays a crucial role in the permeation phenomenon. The interplay
between the selectivity filter behavior and the ion diffusion in the
intracellular side allows a full explanation of the current-voltage curves.

(LTD) at glutamatergic hippocampal synapses are well characterized examples of
long-term synaptic plasticity. Persistent increased activity of the enzyme
protein kinase M (PKM) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional
spatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in
the synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only
synapses that have been &quot;tagged&quot; by an stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning
can &quot;capture&quot; PKM. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key
molecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents
relationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model
successfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKM, STC, LTD, and
cross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKM.
The maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term
memory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKM
enhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback
underlies bistability in the activity of PKM. Second, cross capture requires
the induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKM synthesis, although this may
require tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the
effects of PKM inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of
CaM kinases. Experiments testing the above predictions would significantly
advance the understanding of memory maintenance.

suggested as a mechanism that maintains cooperation in large human groups.
Importantly, models that support this idea have to date only allowed defectors
to be the target of punishment. However, recent empirical work has demonstrated
the existence of anti-social punishment in public goods games. That is,
individuals that defect have been found to also punish cooperators. Some recent
theoretical studies have found that such anti-social punishment can prevent the
evolution of pro-social punishment and cooperation. However, the evolution of
anti-social punishment in group-structured populations has not been formally
addressed. Previous work has informally argued that group-structure must favour
pro-social punishment. Here we formally investigate how two demographic
factors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro-
and anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we
find that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social
punishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that
anti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures,
the claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment
and cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated.

signals in the environment. The biochemical properties and spatial organization
of chemoreceptors play important roles in achieving and maintaining sensitivity
and accuracy of chemical sensing. Here we investigate the effects of receptor
cooperativity and adaptation on the limits of gradient sensing. We study a
single cell with aggregated chemoreceptor arrays on the cell surface and derive
general formula to the limits for gradient sensing from the uncertainty of
instantaneous receptor activity. In comparison to independent receptors, we
find that cooperativity by non-adaptative receptors could significantly lower
the sensing limit in a chemical concentration range determined by the
biochemical properties of ligand-receptor binding and ligand-induced receptor
activity. Cooperativity by adaptative receptors are beneficial to gradient
sensing within a broad range of background concentrations. Our results also
show that isotropic receptor aggregate layout on the cell surface represents an
optimal configuration to gradient sensing.

and infection spread on complex weighted networks. In these networks, nodes can
be interpreted as primitive elements of the system, and weighted edges reflect
the strength of interaction among these elements. The proposed strategy belongs
to the family of multiscale methods whose goal is to approximate the system at
multiple scales of coarseness and to obtain a solution of microscopic scale by
combining the information from coarse scales. In recent years these methods
have demonstrated their potential for solving optimization and analysis
problems on large-scale networks. We consider an optimization problem that is
based on the SIS epidemiological model. The objective is to detect the network
nodes that have to be immunized in order to keep a low level of infection in
the system.

processes in living cells. The temporal dynamics of protein concentration
levels is thus of great interest in biology. Here we propose a theoretical
framework to analyze the frequency, phase and amplitude of oscillatory protein
concentrations in gene regulatory networks with negative cyclic feedback. We
first formulate the analysis framework of oscillation profiles based on
multivariable harmonic balance. With this framework, the frequency, phase and
amplitude are obtained analytically in terms of kinetic constants of the
reactions despite the nonlinearity of the dynamics. These results are
demonstrated with the Pentilator and Hes7 self-repression network, and it is
shown that the developed analysis method indeed predicts the profiles of the
oscillations. A distinctive feature of the presented result is that the
waveform of oscillations is analytically obtained for a broad class of
biochemical systems. Thus, it is easy to see how the waveform is determined
from the system's parameters and structures. We present general biological
insights that are applicable for any gene regulatory networks with negative
cyclic feedback.

(capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability
is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as
functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding
why modularity itself evolved. While most hypotheses assume indirect selection
for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection
pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the
emergence of modular networks. Experiments with selection pressures to maximize
network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are
significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that
only select for performance. These results will catalyze research in numerous
disciplines, including neuroscience, genetics and harnessing evolution for
engineering purposes.

excitation energy transfer (EET) in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) complexes. In
this paper we add the quantum phase factors to the hopping terms and find that
the quantum phase factors play an important role in the EET. The quantum phase
factors allow us to consider the space structure of the pigments. It is found
that phase coherence within the complexes would allow quantum interference to
affect the dynamics of the EET. There exist some optimal phase regions where
the transfer efficiency takes its maxima, which indicates that when the
pigments are optimally spaced, the exciton can pass through the FMO with
perfect efficiency. Moreover, the optimal phase regions almost do not change
with the environments. In addition, we find that the phase factors are useful
in the EET just in the case of multiple-pathway. Therefore, we demonstrate
that, the quantum phases may bring the other two factors, the optimal space of
the pigments and multiple-pathway, together to contribute the EET in
photosynthetic complexes with perfect efficiency.

thermodynamic expectations from calculations in which receptor configurations
are sampled independently from the ligand is derived. Due to this separation,
receptor configurations only need to be sampled once, facilitating the use of
binding free energy calculations in virtual screening. Demonstrative
calculations on a host-guest system yield good agreement with previous free
energy calculations and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. Implicit
ligand theory provides guidance on how to improve existing molecular docking
algorithms and insight into the concepts of induced fit and conformational
selection in noncovalent macromolecular recognition.

two different alleles. Although the model is similar in spirit to classic
models of spatial population genetics such as the stepping stone model, here
however space is continuous and the total density of competing individuals
fluctuates due to demographic stochasticity. By means of analytics and
numerical simulations, we study the behavior of fixation probabilities,
fixation times, and heterozygosity, in a neutral setting and in cases where the
two species can compete or cooperate. By concluding with examples in which
individuals are transported by fluid flows, we argue that this model is a
natural choice to describe competition in marine environments.

models, underlie numerous practical tools in population genomic analyses.
Though an important application that has received much attention is the
inference of population structure, the explicit exchange of migrants at
specified rates has not hitherto been incorporated into the CSD in a principled
framework. Recently, in the case of a single panmictic population, a
sequentially Markov CSD has been developed as an accurate, efficient
approximation to a principled CSD derived from the diffusion process dual to
the coalescent with recombination. In this paper, the sequentially Markov CSD
framework is extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thus
providing an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogical
interpretation related to the structured coalescent with migration and
recombination. As a concrete application, it is demonstrated empirically that
the CSD developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a wide
range of migration rates.

reactants confined to a two-dimensional surface with one arbitrarily large
dimension and the other comparable in size to interparticle distances. This
situation could describe reactants which undergo both longitudinal and
transverse diffusion on long filamentous molecules (such as microtubules), or
molecules that undergo truly one-dimensional translational diffusion (e.g. a
transcription factor on DNA) but simultaneously exhibit diffusive behavior in a
second dimension corresponding to a rotational or conformational degree of
freedom. We combine simple analytical arguments and Monte Carlo simulations to
show that the reaction rate law exhibits a crossover from one-dimensional to
two-dimensional diffusion as a function of particle concentration and the size
of the smaller dimension. In the case of a reversible binding reaction, the
diffusion-limited reaction rate is given by the Smoluchowski expression, but
the crossover is revealed in the statistics of particle collision histories.
The results can also be applied to a particle-antiparticle annihilation
reaction.

factors determine helix stability for a given polypeptide or protein is an
ongoing challenge. Here we use van der Waals corrected density-functional
theory to address a part of this question in a bottom-up approach. We show how
intrinsic helical structure is stabilized with length and temperature for a
series of experimentally well studied unsolvated alanine based polypeptides,
Ac-Alan-LysH+. By exploring extensively the conformational space of these
molecules, we find that helices emerge as the preferred structure in the length
range n=4-8 not just due to enthalpic factors (hydrogen bonds and their
cooperativity, van der Waals dispersion interactions, electrostatics), but
importantly also by a vibrational entropic stabilization over competing
conformers at room temperature. The stabilization is shown to be due to softer
low-frequency vibrational modes in helical conformers than in more compact
ones. This observation is corroborated by including anharmonic effects
explicitly through \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics, and generalized by
testing different terminations and considering larger helical peptide models.

the comparison of PD between samples of different depth. One approach to
dealing with differing sample depth for a given diversity statistic is to
rarefy, which means to take a random subset of a given size of the original
sample. Exact analytical formulae for the mean and variance of species richness
under rarefaction have existed for some time but no such solution exists for
PD. We have derived exact formulae for the mean and variance of PD under
rarefaction. We show that these formulae are correct by comparing exact
solution mean and variance to that calculated by repeated random (Monte Carlo)
subsampling of a dataset of stem counts of woody shrubs of Toohey Forest,
Queensland, Australia. We also demonstrate the application of the method using
two examples: identifying hotspots of mammalian diversity in Australasian
ecoregions, and characterising the human vaginal microbiome. There is a very
high degree of correspondence between the analytical and random subsampling
methods for calculating mean and variance of PD under rarefaction, although the
Monte Carlo method requires a large number of random draws to converge on the
exact solution for the variance. Rarefaction of mammalian PD of ecoregions in
Australasia to a common standard of 25 species reveals very different rank
orderings of ecoregions, indicating quite different hotspots of diversity than
those obtained for unrarefied PD. The application of these methods to the
vaginal microbiome shows that a classical score used to quantify bacterial
vaginosis is correlated with the shape of the rarefaction curve. The analytical
formulae for the mean and variance of PD under rarefaction are both exact and
more efficient than repeated subsampling. Rarefaction of PD allows for many
applications where comparisons of samples of different depth is required.

homeostasis in humans and mice. However, the mechanisms that control
homeostasis of the activated IgM-secreting B cells are unknown. After adoptive
transfer into immune-deficient hosts, B-lymphocytes expand poorly but fully
reconstitute the pool of natural IgM-secreting cells and circulating IgM
levels. By using sequential cell transfers and B cell populations from several
mutant mice, we were able to identify novel mechanisms regulating the size of
the IgM-secreting B cell pool. Contrary to previous mechanisms described
regulating homeostasis, which involve competition for the same niche by cells
having overlapping survival requirements, homeostasis of the innate
IgM-secreting B cell pool is also achieved when B cells populations are able to
monitor the number of activated B cells by detecting their secreted products.
Notably, B cell populations are able to assess the density of activated B cells
by sensing their secreted IgG. This process involves the Fc{\gamma}RIIB, a
low-affinity IgG receptor that is expressed on B cells and acts as a negative
regulator of B cell activation, and its intracellular effector the inositol
phosphatase SHIP. As a result of the engagement of this inhibitory pathway the
number of activated IgM-secreting B cells is kept under control. We hypothesize
that malfunction of this quorum-sensing mechanism may lead to uncontrolled B
cell activation and autoimmunity.

this hemizygosity is expected to drive unusual patterns of evolution on the X
relative to the autosomes. For example, the hemizgosity of the X may lead to a
lower chromosomal effective population size compared to the autosomes
suggesting that the X might be more strongly affected by genetic drift.
However, the X may also experience stronger positive selection than the
autosomes because recessive beneficial mutations will be more visible to
selection on the X where they will spend less time being masked by the
dominant, less beneficial allele - a proposal known as the faster-X hypothesis.
Thus, empirical studies demonstrating increased genetic divergence on the X
chromosome could be indicative of either adaptive or non-adaptive evolution. We
measured gene expression in Drosophila species and in D. melanogaster inbred
strains for both embryos and adults. In the embryos we found that expression
divergence is on average more than 20% higher for genes on the X chromosome
relative to the autosomes, but in contrast, in the inbred strains gene
expression variation is significantly lower on the X chromosome. Furthermore,
expression divergence of genes on Muller's D element is significantly greater
along the branch leading to the obscura sub-group, in which this element
segregates as a neo-X chromosome. In the adults, divergence is greatest on the
X chromosome for males, but not for females, yet in both sexes inbred strains
harbour the lowest level of gene expression variation on the X chromosome. We
consider different explanations for our results and conclude that they are most
consistent within the framework of the faster-X hypothesis.

and genetically-encoded protein catalysts, has been central to models for the
early evolution of life on Earth. A key part of such models is continuity
between the earliest stages in the evolution of life and the RNA repertoires of
extant lineages. Some assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet
direct continuity between modern RNAs and an RNA world has not been
demonstrated for the majority of RNA families, and, anecdotally, many RNA
functions appear restricted in their distribution. Despite much discussion of
the possible antiquity of RNA families, no systematic analyses of RNA family
distribution have been performed. To chart the broad evolutionary history of
known RNA families, we performed comparative genomic analysis of over 3 million
RNA annotations spanning 1446 families from the Rfam 10 database. We report
that 99% of known RNA families are restricted to a single domain of life,
revealing discrete repertoires for each domain. For the 1% of RNA
families/clans present in more than one domain, over half show evidence of
horizontal gene transfer, and the rest show a vertical trace, indicating the
presence of a complex protein synthesis machinery in the Last Universal Common
Ancestor (LUCA) and consistent with the evolutionary history of the most
ancient protein-coding genes. However, with limited interdomain transfer and
few RNA families exhibiting demonstrable antiquity as predicted under RNA world
continuity, our results indicate that the majority of modern cellular RNA
repertoires have primarily evolved in a domain-specific manner.

implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition, and
predator-prey dynamics. An important goal of these studies is discerning which
evolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that
swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes
confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this
selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we
show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve
swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary
effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the
structure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,
high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on
swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming
in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the
functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey
density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual
constraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on
prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions
between predators and prey.

of databases, text minig and predictive methods, we expanded the sparse
information space of protein-protein interactions in three parasitic diseases
namely, malaria, sleeping sickness and cattle east coast fever. These network
models revealed significant similarities in molecular mechanisms underlaying
host's invasion, immuno-modulation and energy metabolism. The models also
suggested new possible pathways in the inter-species protein interaction maps.
Enrichment of these maps with drug-target informations showed a plethora of
drug space to be explored and led to proposal of two new targets for each

chromatin structure to gene expression regulation across conditions,
environments, or differentiated cell types. We developed and applied a
quantitative framework for determining the existence, strength, and type of
relationship between high-resolution chromatin structure in terms of DNaseI
hypersensitivity (DHS) and genome-wide gene expression levels in 20 diverse
human cell lines. We show that ~25% of genes show cell-type specific expression
explained by alterations in chromatin structure. We find that distal regions of
chromatin structure (e.g., +/- 200kb) capture more genes with this relationship
than local regions (e.g., +/- 2.5kb), yet the local regions show a more
pronounced effect. By exploiting variation across cell-types, we were capable
of pinpointing the most likely hypersensitive sites related to cell-type
specific expression, which we show have a range of contextual usages. This
quantitative framework is likely applicable to other settings aimed at relating
continuous genomic measurements to gene expression variation.

virtually all cells. Its core machinery is the subcomplex F$_1$-motor
(F$_1$-ATPase) and performs the reversible mechanochemical coupling. Isolated
F$_1$-motor hydrolyzes ATP, which is accompanied by unidirectional rotation of
its central $\gamma$-shaft. When a strong opposing torque is imposed, the
$\gamma$-shaft rotates in the opposite direction and drives the F$_1$-motor to
synthesize ATP. This mechanical-to-chemical free-energy transduction is the
final and central step of the multistep cellular ATP-synthetic pathway. Here,
we determined the amount of mechanical work exploited by the F$_1$-motor to
synthesize an ATP molecule during forced rotations using methodology combining
a nonequilibrium theory and single molecule measurements of responses to
external torque. We found that the internal dissipation of the motor is
negligible even during rotations far from a quasistatic process.

forces in life-sciences, paving the way for affordable and accurate whole
genome sequencing. As genomes represent the entirety of an organism's
hereditary information, the availability of complete human genomes prompts a
wide range of revolutionary applications. The hope for improving modern
healthcare and better understanding the human genome propels many interesting
and challenging research frontiers. Unfortunately, however, the proliferation
of human genomes amplifies worrisome privacy concerns, since a genome
represents a treasure trove of highly personal and sensitive information. In
this article, we provide an overview of positive results and biomedical
advances in the field, and discuss privacy issues associated with human genomic
information. Finally, we survey available privacy-enhancing technologies and
list a number of open research challenges.

for the formation of cellular networks in culture systems that exclude
intercellular interaction via chemotaxis or mechanical traction.

tumor cells that uses magnetic nanoparticles under a time varying magnetic
field (TVMF). The same basic principle seems promising against trypanosomatids
causing Chagas disease and sleeping sickness, since therapeutic drugs available
display severe side effects and drug-resistant strains. However, no
applications of this strategy against protozoan-induced diseases have been
reported so far. In the present study, Crithidia fasciculata, a widely used
model for therapeutic strategies against pathogenic trypanosomatids, was
targeted with Fe_{3}O_{4} magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in order to remotely
provoke cell death using TVMFs. The MNPs with average sizes of d approx. 30 nm
were synthesized using a precipitation of FeSO_{4}4 in basic medium. The MNPs
were added to Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes in exponential phase and
incubated overnight. The amount of uploaded MNPs per cell was determined by
magnetic measurements. Cell viability using the MTT colorimetric assay and flow
cytometry showed that the MNPs were incorporated by the cells with no
noticeable cell-toxicity effects. When a TVMF (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m) was
applied to MNP-bearing cells, massive cell death was induced via a
non-apoptotic mechanism. No effects were observed by applying a TVMF on control
(without loaded MNPs) cells. No macroscopic rise in temperature was observed in
the extracellular medium during the experiments. Scanning Electron Microscopy
showed morphological changes after TVMF experiments. These data indicate (as a
proof of principle) that intracellular hyperthermia is a suitable technology to
induce the specific death of protozoan parasites bearing MNPs. These findings
expand the possibilities for new therapeutic strategies that combat parasitic
infections.

with different intrinsic directionality is discussed in this study. Similar to
single motor movement, cargo steps forward and backward along microtubule
stochastically. Recent experiments found that, cargo transportation by two
motor species has a memory, it does not change its direction as frequently as
expected, which means that its forward and backward step rates depends on its
previous motion trajectory. By assuming cargo has only the least memory, i.e.
its step direction depends only on the direction of its last step, two cases of
cargo motion are detailed analyzed in this study: {\bf (I)} cargo motion under
constant external load; and {\bf (II)} cargo motion in one fixed optical trap.
Due to the existence of memory, for the first case, cargo can keep moving in
the same direction for a long distance. For the second case, the cargo will
oscillate in the trap. The oscillation period decreases and the oscillation
amplitude increases with the motor forward step rates, but both of them
decrease with the trap stiffness. The most likely location of cargo, where the
probability of finding the oscillated cargo is maximum, may be the same as or
may be different with the trap center, which depends on the step rates of the
two motor species. Meanwhile, if motors are robust, i.e. their forward to
backward step rate ratios are high, there may be two such most likely
locations, located on the two sides of the trap center respectively. The
probability of finding cargo in given location, the probability of cargo in
forward/backward motion state, and various mean first passage times of cargo to
give location or given state are also analyzed.

It is important to
find mechanisms of competitive coexistence of species with different fitness in
especially difficult circumstances - on one limiting resource, in isolated
stable uniform habitat, without any trade-offs and cooperative interactions.
Here we show a mechanism of competitive coexistence based on a soliton-like
behaviour of population waves. We have modelled it by the logical axiomatic
deterministic individual-based cellular automata method. Our mechanistic models
of population and ecosystem dynamics are of white-box type and so they provide
direct insight into mechanisms under study. The mechanism provides indefinite
coexistence of two, three and four competing species. This mechanism violates
the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle. As a
consequence, we have proposed a fully mechanistic and most stringent
formulation of the principle.

in bioinformatics used to infer related residues among biological sequences.
Thus alignment accuracy is crucial to a vast range of analyses, often in ways
difficult to assess in those analyses. To compare the performance of different
aligners and help detect systematic errors in alignments, a number of
benchmarking strategies have been pursued. Here we present an overview of the
main strategies--based on simulation, consistency, protein structure, and
phylogeny--and discuss their different advantages and associated risks. We
outline a set of desirable characteristics for effective benchmarking, and
evaluate each strategy in light of them. We conclude that there is currently no
universally applicable means of benchmarking MSA, and that developers and users
of alignment tools should base their choice of benchmark depending on the
context of application--with a keen awareness of the assumptions underlying
each benchmarking strategy.

structure and, potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global
climatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant
impact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these
patterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is
particularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we
integrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of
trophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited
mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during
the Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional
contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the
structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe
communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained
than other co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in
{\it Rangifer} abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization
of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared to Europe,
species interactions in Beringian communities before the LGM were highly
compartmentalized, or modular. This modularity was lost during the LGM, and
partially recovered after the glacial retreat, and we suggest that changes in
modularity among predators and prey may have been driven by geographic
insularity.

properties are strongly coupled to metal ions in solutions. In this paper, the
salt effects on the flexibility of single stranded (ss) nucleic acid chain
ranging from 12 to 120 nucleotides are investigated systematically by the
coarse grained Monte Carlo simulations where the salt ions are considered
explicitly and the ss chain is modeled with the virtual bond structural model.
Our calculations show that, the increase of ion concentration causes the
structural collapse of ss chain and multivalent ions are much more efficient in
causing such collapse, and trivalent and small divalent ions can both induce
more compact state than a random relaxation state. We found that monovalent,
divalent and trivalent ions can all overcharge ss chain, and the dominating
source for such overcharging changes from ion exclusion volume effect to ion
Coulomb correlations. In addition, the predicted Na and Mg dependent
persistence length lp of ss nucleic acid are in accordance with the available
experimental data, and through systematic calculations, we obtained the
empirical formulas for lp as a function of Na, Mg and chain length.

modularity in biological systems under increased environmental pressure. We
here develop a quasispecies theory for the dynamics of modularity in

dissipation relation for the rate of change of modularity and use it to derive
a relationship between rate of environmental changes and rate of growth of
modularity. We also find a principle of least action for the evolved modularity

via their synaptic connections. Despite receiving considerable attention, the
precise relationship between network connectivity and encoded patterns is still
poorly understood. Here we consider this problem for networks of
threshold-linear neurons whose computational function is to learn and store a
set of binary patterns (e.g., a neural code) as &quot;permitted sets&quot; of the
network. We introduce a simple Encoding Rule that selectively turns &quot;on&quot;
synapses between neurons that co-appear in one or more patterns. The rule uses
synapses that are binary, in the sense of having only two states (&quot;on&quot; or
&quot;off&quot;), but also heterogeneous, with weights drawn from an underlying synaptic
strength matrix S. Our main results precisely describe the stored patterns that
result from the Encoding Rule -- including unintended &quot;spurious&quot; states -- and
give an explicit characterization of the dependence on S. In particular, we
find that binary patterns are successfully stored in these networks when the
excitatory connections between neurons are geometrically balanced -- i.e., they
satisfy a set of geometric constraints. Furthermore, we find that certain types
of neural codes are &quot;natural&quot; in the context of these networks, meaning that
the full code can be accurately learned from a highly undersampled set of
patterns. Interestingly, many commonly observed neural codes in cortical and
hippocampal areas are natural in this sense. As an application, we construct
networks that encode hippocampal place field codes nearly exactly, following
presentation of only a small fraction of patterns. To obtain our results, we
prove new theorems using classical ideas from convex and distance geometry,
such as Cayley-Menger determinants, revealing a novel connection between these
areas of mathematics and coding properties of neural networks.

In

The approach is based upon a detailed numerical study of various versions of
the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation. The main motivation
of this work is to contribute to the following question: how much information
do statistics, collected by a stationary observer, contain about the speed and
bifurcations of traveling waves? We suggest warning signs based upon closeness
to carrying capacity, second-order moments and transients of localized initial
invasions.

  of all genes protein expression levels</comments><doi>10.7717/peerj.270</doi><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest that the
protein expressed at the median abundance is present at 8,000 - 16,000
molecules per cell and that differences in mRNA expression between genes
explain only 10-40% of the differences in protein levels. We find, however,
that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and the
relative importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61
housekeeping proteins to rescale whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al.,
we find that the median protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per
cell and that our corrected protein abundance estimates show a higher
correlation with mRNA abundances than do the uncorrected protein data. In
addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and protein
abundances, showing that mRNA levels explain at least 56% of the differences in
protein abundance for the genes detected by Schwanhausser et al., though
because one major source of error could not be estimated the true percent
contribution could be higher. We also employed a second, independent strategy
to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to protein expression. We show
that the variance in translation rates directly measured by ribosome profiling
is only 12% of that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. and that the measured and
inferred translation rates correlate only poorly (R2=0.13). Based on this, our
second strategy suggests that mRNA levels explain ~81% of the variance in
protein levels. We also determined the percent contributions of transcription,
RNA degradation, translation and protein degradation to the variance in protein
abundances using both of our strategies. While the magnitudes of the two
estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays a more important
role than the earlier studies implied and translation a much smaller role.

systems where all entanglements are trapped: a perfect network, and a melt with
grafted chain ends. We examine microscopically at what level topological
constraints can be considered as a collective entanglement effect, as in tube
model theories, or as certain pairwise uncrossability interactions, as in
slip-link models. A pairwise parameter, which varies between these limiting
cases, shows that, for the systems studied, the character of the entanglement
environment is more pairwise than collective.
  We employ a novel methodology, which analyzes entanglement constraints into a
complete set of pairwise interactions, similar to slip links. Entanglement
confinement is assembled by a plethora of links, with a spectrum of confinement
strengths, from strong to weak. The strength of interactions is quantified
through a link `persistence', which is the fraction of time for which the links
are active. By weighting links according to their strength, we show that
confinement is imposed mainly by the strong ones, and that the weak, trapped,
uncrossability interactions cannot contribute to the low frequency modulus of
an elastomer, or the plateau modulus of a melt.
  A self-consistent scheme for mapping topological constraints to specific,
strong binary links, according to a given entanglement density, is proposed and
validated. Our results demonstrate that slip links can be viewed as the
strongest pairwise interactions of a collective entanglement environment. The
methodology developed provides a basis for bridging the gap between atomistic
simulations and mesoscopic slip link models.

variables but continuous functions. Given a dataset of function-valued traits
generated by evolution, we develop a practical statistical approach to infer
ancestral function-valued traits, and estimate the generative evolutionary
process. We do this by combining dimension reduction and phylogenetic Gaussian
process regression, a nonparametric procedure which explicitly accounts for
known phylogenetic relationships. We test the methods' performance on simulated
function-valued data generated from a stochastic evolutionary model. The
methods are applied assuming that only the phylogeny and the function-valued
traits of taxa at its tips are known. Our method is robust and applicable to a
wide range of function-valued data, and also offers a phylogenetically aware
method for estimating the autocorrelation of function-valued traits.

often arise from stereotyped stimulus-response maps, associating to each neuron
a convex receptive field. An important problem confronted by the brain is to
infer properties of a represented stimulus space without knowledge of the
receptive fields, using only the intrinsic structure of the neural code. How
does the brain do this? To address this question, it is important to determine
what stimulus space features can - in principle - be extracted from neural
codes. This motivates us to define the neural ring and a related neural ideal,
algebraic objects that encode the full combinatorial data of a neural code. Our
main finding is that these objects can be expressed in a &quot;canonical form&quot; that
directly translates to a minimal description of the receptive field structure
intrinsic to the code. We also find connections to Stanley-Reisner rings, and
use ideas similar to those in the theory of monomial ideals to obtain an
algorithm for computing the primary decomposition of pseudo-monomial ideals.
This allows us to algorithmically extract the canonical form associated to any
neural code, providing the groundwork for inferring stimulus space features
from neural activity alone.

Understanding its behavior is of considerable public health importance because
of Congenital Rubella Syndrome, which results from infection with rubella
during early pregnancy and may entail a variety of birth defects. The recurrent
dynamics of rubella are relatively poorly resolved, and appear to show
considerable diversity globally. Here, we investigate the behavior of a
stochastic seasonally forced susceptible-infected-recovered model to
characterize the determinants of these dynamics and illustrate patterns by
comparison with measles. We perform a systematic analysis of spectra of
stochastic fluctuations around stable attractors of the corresponding
deterministic model and compare them with spectra from full stochastic
simulations in large populations. This approach allows us to quantify the
effects of demographic stochasticity and to give a coherent picture of measles
and rubella dynamics, explaining essential differences in the recurrent
patterns exhibited by these diseases. We discuss the implications of our
findings in the context of vaccination and changing birth rates as well as the
persistence of these two childhood infections.

information theory and mathematical coding theory. While information theory has
had a strong influence on theoretical neuroscience, ideas from mathematical
coding theory have received considerably less attention. Here we take a new
look at combinatorial neural codes from a mathematical coding theory
perspective, examining the error correction capabilities of familiar receptive
field codes (RF codes). We find, perhaps surprisingly, that the high levels of
redundancy present in these codes does not support accurate error correction,
although the error-correcting performance of RF codes &quot;catches up&quot; to that of
random comparison codes when a small tolerance to error is introduced. On the
other hand, RF codes are good at reflecting distances between represented
stimuli, while the random comparison codes are not. We suggest that a
compromise in error-correcting capability may be a necessary price to pay for a
neural code whose structure serves not only error correction, but must also
reflect relationships between stimuli.

either a limit cycle oscillator, where the deterministic nonlinear dynamics
gives sustained periodic oscillations, or a noise-induced oscillator, where a
fixed point is linearly stable with complex eigenvalues and addition of noise
gives oscillations around the fixed point with fluctuating amplitude. We
investigate how each class of model behaves under the external periodic
forcing, taking the well-studied van der Pol equation as an example. We find
that, when the forcing is additive, the noise-induced oscillator can show only
one-to-one entrainment to the external frequency, in contrast to the limit
cycle oscillator which is known to entrain to any ratio. When the external
forcing is multiplicative, on the other hand, the noise-induced oscillator can
show entrainment to a few ratios other than one-to-one, while the limit cycle
oscillator shows entrain to any ratio. The noise blurs the entrainment in
general, but clear entrainment regions for limit cycles can be identified as
long as the noise is not too strong.

for gastrulation. Whether loss of genes also co-evolved with this developmental
reprogramming has not yet been addressed. Here, we identify twenty-four genetic
functions that are retained in fungi and choanoflagellates but undetectable in
animals. These lost genes encode: (i) sixteen distinct biosynthetic functions;
(ii) the two ancestral eukaryotic ClpB disaggregases, Hsp78 and Hsp104, which
function in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively; and (iii) six other
assorted functions. We present computational and experimental data that are
consistent with a joint function for the differentially localized ClpB
disaggregases, and with the possibility of a shared client/chaperone
relationship between the mitochondrial Fe/S homoaconitase encoded by the lost
LYS4 gene and the two ClpBs. Our analyses lead to the hypothesis that the
evolution of gastrulation-based multicellularity in animals led to efficient
extraction of nutrients from dietary sources, loss of natural selection for
maintenance of energetically expensive biosynthetic pathways, and subsequent
loss of their attendant ClpB chaperones.

their ability to be expressed in cells with short mitotic cycles, a phenomenon
termed intron delay. As such short cycles are a hallmark of the earliest stages
of insect development, we used Drosophila developmental timecourse expression
data to test whether intron delay affects gene expression genome-wide, and to
determine its consequences for the evolution of gene structure. We find that
long zygotically expressed, but not maternally deposited, genes show
substantial delay in expression relative to their shorter counterparts and that
this delay persists over a substantial portion of the ~24 hours of
embryogenesis. Patterns of RNA-seq coverage from the 5' and 3' ends of
transcripts show that this delay is consistent with their inability to
terminate transcription, but not with transcriptional initiation-based
regulatory control. Highly expressed zygotic genes are subject to purifying
selection to maintain compact transcribed regions, allowing conservation of
embryonic expression patterns across the Drosophila phylogeny. We propose that
intron delay is an underappreciated physical mechanism affecting both patterns
of expression as well as gene structure of many genes across Drosophila.

become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into
high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome
assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their
performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer
read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled
sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the
quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are
intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly. Results
- In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for
three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total
of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these
assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and
several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key
measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies. Conclusions
- Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a
significant representation of their genes, regulatory sequences, and overall
genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries
suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome
assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one
species may not necessarily work well for another.

BMC Syst Biol 7(1):100</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Molecular biology knowledge can be systematically represented in a
computer-readable form as a comprehensive map of molecular interactions. There
exist a number of maps of molecular interactions containing detailed
description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large
maps, to comment their content and to maintain them. Though there exist several
tools addressing these problems individually, the scientific community still
lacks an environment that combines these three capabilities together. NaviCell
is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions,
created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and
maintenance. NaviCell combines three features: (1) efficient map browsing based
on Google Maps engine; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of
details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for
collecting the community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in
the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of their
interest in the context of signaling pathways and cross-talks between pathways
within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed
molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map
up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell facilitates curation,
maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an
interactive fashion due to an imbedded blogging system. NaviCell provides an
easy way to explore large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to the
Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, already familiar to many users. Semantic
zooming used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in
NaviCell, making any level of visualization meaningful to the user. In
addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based map curation.

measurements for the years AD 774-775. Contrary to claims regarding a coronal
mass ejection (CME), the required CME energy is not several orders of magnitude
greater than known solar events. We consider solar proton events (SPEs) with
three different fluences and two different spectra. The data may be explained
by an event with fluence about one order of magnitude beyond the October 1989
SPE. Two hard spectrum cases considered here result in moderate ozone
depletion, so no mass extinction is implied, though we do predict increases in
erythema and damage to plants from enhanced solar UV. We are able to rule out
an event with a very soft spectrum that causes severe ozone depletion and
subsequent biological impacts. Nitrate enhancements are consistent with their
apparent absence in ice core data. The modern technological implications of
such an event may be extreme, and considering recent confirmation of
superflares on solar-type stars, this issue merits attention.

equations. In particular, we analyze an Amari-type model driven by a $Q$-Wiener
process and focus on noise-induced transitions and escape. We argue that
proving a sharp Kramers' law for neural fields poses substanial difficulties
but that one may transfer techniques from stochastic partial differential
equations to establish a large deviation principle (LDP). Then we demonstrate
that an efficient finite-dimensional approximation of the stochastic neural
field equation can be achieved using a Galerkin method and that the resulting
finite-dimensional rate function for the LDP can have a multi-scale structure
in certain cases. These results form the starting point for an efficient
practical computation of the LDP. Our approach also provides the technical
basis for further rigorous study of noise-induced transitions in neural fields
based on Galerkin approximations.

regulatory networks. Our approach consists in adapting an established
reinforcement learning algorithm called the fitted Q iteration. This algorithm
infers the control law directly from the measurements of the system's response
to external control inputs without the use of a mathematical model of the
system. The measurement data set can either be collected from wet-lab
experiments or artificially created by computer simulations of dynamical models
of the system. The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of biological
systems due to its ability to deal with nonlinear and stochastic system
dynamics. To illustrate the application of the algorithm to a gene regulatory
network, the regulation of the toggle switch system is considered. The control
objective of this problem is to drive the concentrations of two specific
proteins to a target region in the state space.

  cerevisiae Assessed by RAD-seq</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for human food
production and as a model organism for biological research. The genetic
diversity contained in the global population of yeast strains represents a
valuable resource for a number of fields, including genetics, bioengineering,
and studies of evolution and population structure. Here, we apply a
multiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (known as RAD-seq) to genotype
a large collection of S. cerevisiae strains, isolated from a wide range of
geographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the
sequencing of the same 1% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence
alignment of 116,880 bases across 262 strains. We find diversity among these
strains is principally organized by geography, with European, North American,
Asian and African/S. E. Asian populations defining the major axes of genetic
variation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives and
sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One
population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high
levels of heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian
populations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. In the context of
this global diversity, we demonstrate that a collection of seven strains
commonly used in the laboratory encompasses only one quarter of the genetic
diversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring the
relatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab
strains. We propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by
human-associated admixture, primarily between European and Asian populations
and more recently between European and North American populations. The large
collection of genotyped yeast strains characterized here will provide a useful
resource for the broad community of yeast researchers.

employed in the context of molecular dynamics simulations, to a series of
systems-biology models that range in complexity from one-dimensional to a
system with 354 species and 3680 reactions. WE is relatively easy to implement,
does not require extensive hand-tuning of parameters, does not depend on the
details of the simulation algorithm, and can facilitate the simulation of
extremely rare events.
  For the coupled stochastic reaction systems we study, WE is able to produce
accurate and efficient approximations of the joint probability distribution for
all chemical species for all time t. WE is also able to efficiently extract
mean first passage times for the systems, via the construction of a
steady-state condition with feedback. In all cases studied here, WE results
agree with independent calculations, but significantly enhance the precision
with which rare or slow processes can be characterized. Speedups over
&quot;brute-force&quot; in sampling rare events via the Gillespie direct Stochastic
Simulation Algorithm range from ~10^12 to ~10^20 for rare states in a
distribution, and ~10^2 to ~10^4 for finding mean first passage times.

epidemic bursts in different patches, but rather with the linear stability
properties of the attractor that describes the steady state of the system in
the large population limit.

structure and function by finding homologous, or evolutionarily-related,
proteins of known structure and function. Since structure is typically more
conserved than sequence over long evolutionary distances, recognizing remote
protein homologs from their sequence poses a challenge.
  We first consider all proteins of known three-dimensional structure, and
explore how they cluster according to different levels of homology. An
automatic computational method reasonably approximates a human-curated
hierarchical organization of proteins according to their degree of homology.
  Next, we return to homology prediction, based only on the one-dimensional
amino acid sequence of a protein. Menke, Berger, and Cowen proposed a Markov
random field model to predict remote homology for beta-structural proteins, but
their formulation was computationally intractable on many beta-strand
topologies.
  We show two different approaches to approximate this random field, both of
which make it computationally tractable, for the first time, on all protein
folds. One method simplifies the random field itself, while the other retains
the full random field, but approximates the solution through stochastic search.
Both methods achieve improvements over the state of the art in remote homology
detection for beta-structural protein folds.

protein in the plasma membrane of the malarial parasite that causes the most
severe form of malaria infecting more than a million people a year. Finding a
novel way to inhibit PfAQP, I conducted 3+ microseconds in silico experiments
of an atomistic model of the PfAQP-membrane system and computed the
chemical-potential profiles of six permeants (erythritol, water, glycerol,
urea, ammonia, and ammonium) that can be efficiently transported across P.
falciparum's plasma membrane through PfAQP's conducting pore. The profiles show
that, with all the existent in vitro data being supportive, erythritol, a
permeant of PfAQP itself having a deep ditch in its permeation passageway,
strongly inhibits PfAQP's functions of transporting water, glycerol, urea,
ammonia, and ammonium (The IC50 is in the range of high nanomolars). This
suggests the possibility that erythritol, a sweetener generally considered
safe, may be the drug needed to kill the malarial parasite in vivo without
causing serious side effects.

fundamental breakthrough for the development of a statistical physics for
cognitive systems and it can shed light on the applicability of macroscopic
statistical laws for social systems. Even if the complexity of individual
behaviors prevents a true microscopic approach, the introduction of mesoscopic
models allows the study of the dynamical properties for the non-stationary
states of the considered system. We propose to compute various entropy measures
of the individual mobility patterns obtained from GPS data that record the
movements of private vehicles in the Florence district, in order to point out
new features of human mobility related to the use of time and space and to
define the dynamical properties of a stochastic model that could generate
similar patterns. Moreover, we can relate the predictability properties of
human mobility to the distribution of time passed between two successive trips.
Our analysis suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure in the mobility
patterns which divides the performed activities into three different
categories, according to the time cost, with different information contents. We
show that a Markov process defined by using the individual mobility network is
not able to reproduce this hierarchy, which seems the consequence of different
strategies in the activity choice. Our results could contribute to the
development of governance policies for a sustainable mobility in modern cities.

electrophoresis data, we previously proposed a suite of efficient analysis
software named HiTRACE (High Throughput Robust Analysis of Capillary
Electrophoresis). HiTRACE has been used extensively for quantitating data from
RNA and DNA structure mapping experiments, including mutate-and-map contact
inference, chromatin footprinting, the EteRNA RNA design project and other
high-throughput applications. However, HiTRACE is based on a suite of
command-line MATLAB scripts that requires nontrivial efforts to learn, use, and
extend. Here we present HiTRACE-Web, an online version of HiTRACE that includes
standard features previously available in the command-line version as well as
additional features such as automated band annotation and flexible adjustment
of annotations, all via a user-friendly environment. By making use of
parallelization, the on-line workflow is also faster than software
implementations available to most users on their local computers. Free access:

which consist of intensive and extensive search modes. Models of composite
search can generate predictions about how optimal foragers should behave in
each search mode, and how they should determine when to switch between search
modes. Most of these models assume that foragers use resource encounters to
decide when to switch between search modes. Empirical observations indicate
that a variety of organisms use non-directional sensory cues to identify areas
that warrant intensive search. These cues are not precise enough to allow a
forager to directly orient itself to a resource, but can be used as a criterion
to determine the appropriate search mode. As a potential example, a forager
might use olfactory information, which could help it determine if an area is
worth searching carefully. We developed a model of composite search based on
non-directional sensory cues. With simulations, we compared the search
efficiencies of composite foragers that use resource encounters as their
mode-switching criterion with those that use non-directional sensory cues. We
identified optimal search patterns and mode-switching criteria on a variety of
resource distributions, characterized by different levels of resource
aggregation and density. On all resource distributions, foraging strategies
based on the non-directional sensory criterion were more efficient than those
based on the resource encounter criterion. Strategies based on the
non-directional sensory criterion were also more robust to changes in resource
distribution. Our results suggest that current assumptions about the role of
resource encounters in models of optimal composite search should be
re-examined. The search strategies predicted by our model can help bridge the
gap between random search theory and traditional patch-use foraging theory.

expression is highly redundant. Accordingly, a population can accept mutations
without altering its phenotype, as long as thegenotype mutates into another one
on the same set. By linking every pair of genotypes that are mutually
accessible through mutation, genotypes organize themselves into neutral
networks (NN). These networks are known to be heterogeneous and assortative,
and these properties affect the evolutionary dynamics of the population. By
studying the dynamics of populations on NN with arbitrary topology we analyze
the effect of assortativity, of NN (phenotype) fitness, and of network size. We
find that the probability that the population leaves the network is smaller the
longer the time spent on it. This progressive &quot;phenotypic entrapment&quot; entails a
systematic increase in the overdispersion of the process with time and an
acceleration in the fixation rate of neutral mutations. We also quantify the
variation of these effects with the size of the phenotype and with its fitness
relative to that of neighbouring alternatives.

a recent study by Berestycki et {al.} [Nonlinearity 22 (2009),
{pp.}~2813--2844] where the nonlocal FKPP equation has been studied and it was
shown for the spatial domain $\mathbb{R}$ andsufficiently small nonlocality
that there are only two bounded non-negative stationary solutions. Here we
provide a similar result for $\mathbb{R}^d$ using a completely different
approach. In particular, an abstract perturbation argument is used in suitable
weighted Sobolev spaces. One aim of the alternative strategy is that it can
eventually be generalized to obtain persistence results for hyperbolic
invariant sets for other nonlocal evolution equations on unbounded domains with
small nonlocality, {i.e.}, to improve our understanding in applications when a
small nonlocal influence alters the dynamics and when it does not.

focuses on phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific
genetic mutations, but often ignore the cell's position within the
heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure
is common in mathematical models.
  Methods: We view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game
between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is
that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another
depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local
heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak
transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game.
  Results: We show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go)
strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary
-- such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane -- we show an
edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to
have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this
promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate
adenocarcinoma in bone marrow.
  Interpretation: Pathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in
the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of
invasive cells. We expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game
models where interaction neighborhoods change at fixed system boundaries.

projection operators are under consideration, which are connected with matrix
representations of the genetic coding system in forms of the Rademacher and

abilities for adequate simulations of ensembles of inherited biological
phenomena including ensembles of biological cycles, morphogenetic ensembles of
phyllotaxis patterns, etc. For such modeling, the author proposes
multidimensional vector spaces, whose subspaces are under a selective control
(or coding) by means of a set of matrix operators on base of genetic
projectors. Development of genetic biomechanics is discussed. The author
proposes and describes special systems of multidimensional numbers under names

  Resistance to Nutrient Loading</title><categories>q-bio.QM q-bio.PE</categories><comments>5 pages, 1 figure</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Mississippi River nutrient loads and water stratification on the
Louisiana-Texas shelf contribute to an annually recurring, short-lived hypoxic
bottom layer in areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico comprising less than 2% of
the total Gulf of Mexico bottom area. This paper observes that the NOAA and
LUMCON have now published errant predictions of possible record size areas of
temporary bottom water hypoxia (&quot;dead zones&quot;) three times since 2005, in 2008,
2011, and 2013 and that the LUMCON predictions of the area of hypoxic bottom
water average 31% higher than the actual measured hypoxic areas from 2006 to
2014. These systematically high predictions depend on the assumption that the
susceptibility of the Gulf of Mexico to forming hypoxic areas in response to
nutrient loading has been relatively constant since 2001, though the
susceptibility has been occasionally adjusted upward in different models. It
has been previously suggested that tropical storms in a given year that occur
on the Louisiana-Texas shelf between the peak nutrient loading in spring and
formation of the hypoxic zone in summer can mitigate the size of the hypoxic
zone that year through mixing of stratified well oxygenated lighter and warmer
surface layers and oxygen depleted heavier and cooler bottom layers. This paper
suggests several reasons why the Louisiana-Texas shelf may be systematically
growing less susceptible to a given level of nutrient loading over time so that
predictions based on the measured area of temporary bottom water hypoxia prior
to 2006 tend to be too big in recent years.

biodiversity that predicts a large number of macroecological patterns using
only information on the species richness, total abundance, and total metabolic
rate of the community. We evaluated four major predictions of METE
simultaneously at an unprecedented scale using data from 60 globally
distributed forest communities including over 300,000 individuals and nearly
2000 species. METE successfully captured 96% and 89% of the variation in the
species abundance distribution and the individual size distribution, but
performed poorly when characterizing the size-density relationship and
intraspecific distribution of individual size. Specifically, METE predicted a
negative correlation between size and species abundance, which is weak in
natural communities. By evaluating multiple predictions with large quantities
of data, our study not only identifies a mismatch between abundance and body
size in METE, but also demonstrates the importance of conducting strong tests
of ecological theories.

data by Gautrais etal (PLoS Comp. Biol. 8, e1002678 (2012)), exploring its
parameter space beyond the parameter values determined experimentally on groups
of barred flagtails (Kuhlia mugil}) swimming in a shallow tank. A modified
model is studied alongside the original one, in which an additional frontal
preference is introduced in the stimulus/response function to account for the
angular weighting of interactions. Our study, mostly limited to groups of
moderate size (in the order of 100 individuals), focused not only on the
transition to schooling induced by increasing the swimming speed, but also on
the conditions under which a school can exhibit milling dynamics and the
corresponding behavioral transitions. We show the existence of a transition
region between milling and schooling, in which the school exhibits
multistability and intermittency between schooling and milling for the same
combination of individuals parameters. We also show that milling does not occur
for arbitrarily large groups, mainly due to a distance dependence interaction
of the model and information propagation delays in the school, which cause
conflicting reactions for large groups. We finally discuss the biological
significance of our findings, especially the dependence of behavioural
transitions on social interactions, which were reported by Gautrais etal to be
adaptive in the experimental conditions.

  for neural dimensionality reduction</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Stimulus dimensionality-reduction methods in neuroscience seek to identify a
low-dimensional space of stimulus features that affect a neuron's probability
of spiking. One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions
(MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as &quot;single-spike
information&quot; to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based
perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the
parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical
single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a
Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find
maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as
Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive
a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete
time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality
reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that
they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic
terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of
stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the
non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with
simulations and data from primate visual cortex.

States and globally. While influenza vaccines are the single most effective
intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable
debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal
vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network
model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in
vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that
revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the
overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects
highly-connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately
large contribution to influenza transmission. Our work thus contributes a
population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza
vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual
vaccine histories.

  edition arXiv:1412.5995</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Motivation: The mapping of RNA-seq reads to their transcripts of origin is a
fundamental task in transcript expression estimation and differential
expression scoring. Where ambiguities in mapping exist due to transcripts
sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or alleles, the problem becomes an
instance of non-trivial probabilistic inference. Bayesian inference in such a
problem is intractable and approximate methods must be used such as Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Bayes. Standard implementations of
these methods can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex gene
models.
  Results: We propose an approximate inference scheme based on Variational
Bayes applied to an existing model of transcript expression inference from
RNA-seq data. We apply recent advances in Variational Bayes algorithmics to
improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard variational
expectation-maximisation approach. We apply our algorithm to simulated and
biological datasets, demonstrating that the increase in speed requires only a
small trade-off in accuracy of expression level estimation.
  Availability: The methods were implemented in R and C++, and are available as
part of the BitSeq project at https://code.google.com/p/bitseq/. The methods
will be made available through the BitSeq Bioconductor package at the next
stable release.

analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing systematic variation due to latent
variables in large-scale genomic data. PCA and related methods may directly
provide a quantitative characterization of a complex biological variable that
is otherwise difficult to precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in
this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are
drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (and
other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed from the
genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical significance
artificially inflated when using conventional methods due to over-fitting. We
introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately
identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with
any subset or linear combination of principal components (PCs). The proposed
method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered
in genomics and can be utilized to identify the genomic variables significantly
associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our
method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of
relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show
that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify
statistically significant genes that are cell-cycle regulated. We also analyze
gene expression data from post-trauma patients, allowing the gene expression
data to provide a molecularly-driven phenotype. We find a greater enrichment
for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to using a clinically defined
phenotype. The proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale
quantifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.

variables (outputs) on deterministic conditions (inputs). Random outputs
recorded under mutually exclusive input values are labeled by these values and
considered stochastically unrelated, possessing no joint distribution. An input
that does not directly influence an output creates a context for the latter.
Any constraint imposed on the dependence of random outputs on inputs can be
characterized by considering all possible couplings (joint distributions)
imposed on stochastically unrelated outputs. The target application of these
principles is a quantum mechanical system of entangled particles, with
directions of spin measurements chosen for each particle being inputs and the
spins recorded outputs. The sphere of applicability, however, spans systems
across physical, biological, and behavioral sciences.

a deleterious mutation might fix. Nonetheless, here we show that, in many
regimes, the first substitution is most often deleterious, even when fitness is
expected to increase in the long term. In particular, we prove that this
phenomenon occurs under weak mutation for any house-of-cards model with an
equilibrium distribution. We find that the same qualitative results hold under
Fisher's geometric model. We also provide a simple intuition for the surprising
prevalence of unconditionally deleterious substitutions during early
adaptation. Importantly, the phenomenon we describe occurs on fitness
landscapes without any local maxima and is therefore distinct from
&quot;valley-crossing&quot;. Our results imply that the common practice of ignoring
deleterious substitutions leads to qualitatively incorrect predictions in many
regimes. Our results also have implications for the substitution process at
equilibrium and for the response to a sudden decrease in population size.

of vast amount of accurate experimental data the atomistic resolution
structures sampled by the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup in
phoshatidylcholine bilayers are not known. Atomistic resolution molecular
dynamics simulation model would automatically resolve the structures giving an
interpretation of experimental results, if the model would reproduce the
experimental data. In this work we compare the C-H bond vector order parameters
for glycerol backbone and choline headgroup between 14 different atomistic
resolution models and experiments in fully hydrated lipid bilayer. The current
models are not accurately enough to resolve the structure. However, closer
inspection of three best performing models (CHARMM36, GAFFlipid and MacRog)
suggest that improvements in the sampled dihedral angle distributions would
potentilly lead to the model which would resolve the structure. Despite of the
inaccuracy in the fully hydrated structures, the response to the dehydration,
i.e. P-N vector tilting more parallel to membrane normal, is qualitatively
correct in all models. The CHARMM36 and MacRog models describe the interactions
between lipids and cholesterol better than Berger/H\&quot;oltje model. This work has

development of agriculture as it allows breeders to predict the potential of
breeding for certain traits. One such phenomenon is heterosis or hybrid vigor:
crossing individuals from genetically distinct populations often results in
improvements in quantitative traits, such as growth rate, biomass production
and stress resistance. Heterosis has become a very useful tool in global
agriculture, but its genetic basis remains controversial and its effects hard
to predict. We have taken a computational approach to studying heterosis,
developing a simulation of evolution, independent reassortment of alleles and
hybridization of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) in a Boolean framework.
Fitness is measured as the ability of a network to respond to external inputs
in a pre-defined way. Our model reproduced common experimental observations on
heterosis using only biologically justified parameters. Hybrid vigor was
observed and its extent was seen to increase as parental populations diverged,
up until a point of sudden collapse of hybrid fitness. We also reproduce, for
the first time in a model, the fact that hybrid vigor cannot easily be fixed by
within a breeding line, currently an important limitation of the use of hybrid
crops. The simulation allowed us to study the effects of three standard models
for the genetic basis of heterosis and the level of detail in our model allows
us to suggest possible warning signs of the impending collapse of hybrid vigor
in breeding. In addition, the simulation provides a framework that can be
extended to study other aspects of heterosis and alternative evolutionary
scenarios.

requires finding a route for the scaffolding strand through the desired
structure. When the target structure is a 1-complex (or the geometric
realization of a graph), an optimal route corresponds to an Eulerian circuit
through the graph with minimum turning cost. By showing that it leads to a
solution to the 3-SAT problem, we prove that the general problem of finding an
optimal route for a scaffolding strand for such structures is NP-hard. We then
show that the problem may readily be transformed into a Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), so that machinery that has been developed for the TSP may be
applied to find optimal routes for the scaffolding strand in a DNA origami
self-assembly process. We give results for a few special cases, showing for
example that the problem remains intractable for graphs with maximum degree 8,
but is polynomial time for 4-regular plane graphs if the circuit is restricted
to following faces. We conclude with some implications of these results for
related problems, such as biomolecular computing and mill routing problems.

cells is proposed. Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow
variables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the
differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition
between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an
analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the
rate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate
can be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of
the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming
are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated
and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition
rate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape
of the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that
by decreasing the coherence degree of some pluripotency genes a more effective
approach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.

experimental evolution studies and ancient DNA samples has created new
opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to
estimate their associated fitness parameters. However, it is a challenging
problem to compute the likelihood of nonneutral models for the population
allele frequency dynamics, given the observed temporal DNA data. Here, we
develop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrate
over all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. This
advance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which require
fine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space when
numerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method is
flexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where the
heterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, while
previous methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. We
demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it to
analyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration in
horses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitness
parameter space reveals that a heterozygote advantage form of balancing
selection may have been acting on these loci.

culture, but appear to be absent from the physical world and are not part of
the explanatory framework of the natural sciences. Understanding how meaning
(in the broad sense of the term) could arise from a physical world has proven
to be a tough problem. The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces
adaptations that only represent apparent (&quot;as if&quot;) goals and meaning. Here I
use evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic
scheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted
modulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological
cells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living
world: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of
causation (active causation). The extended scheme accomplishes this by
utilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by
evolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability
as well, and thus shows how freedom of behaviour is possible. A further
extension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic
meaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in
combination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the
phenomenon of free will.

dynamics of many organisms, including insects that are of concern for human
health and agriculture. This is particularly true for vector-borne infectious
diseases, like malaria, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in
humans. Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population
processes for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate
change on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important
measure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number
$R_0$. However, understanding the mechanisms linking $R_0$ and temperature, an
environmental factor driving disease risk, can be challenging because the data
available for parameterization are often poor. To address this we show how a
Bayesian approach can help identify critical uncertainties in components of
$R_0$ and how this uncertainty is propagated into the estimate of $R_0$. Most
notably, we find that different parameters dominate the uncertainty at
different temperature regimes: bite rate from 15-25$^\circ$ C; fecundity across
all temperatures, but especially $\sim$25-32$^\circ$ C; mortality from
20-30$^\circ$ C; parasite development rate at $\sim$15-16$^\circ$C and again at
$\sim$33-35$^\circ$C. Focusing empirical studies on these parameters and
corresponding temperature ranges would be the most efficient way to improve
estimates of $R_0$. While we focus on malaria, our methods apply to improving
process-based models more generally, including epidemiological, physiological
niche, and species distribution models.

finite populations with mutation, connecting the theory of the stationary
distribution of the Moran process with the Lyapunov theory of evolutionary
stability. We define the notion of stationary stability for the Moran process
with mutation and generalizations, as well as a generalized notion of
evolutionary stability that includes mutation called an incentive stable state
(ISS) candidate. For sufficiently large populations, extrema of the stationary
distribution are ISS candidates and we give a family of Lyapunov quantities
that are locally minimized at the stationary extrema and at ISS candidates. In
various examples, including for the Moran and Wright-Fisher processes, we show
that the local maxima of the stationary distribution capture the
traditionally-defined evolutionarily stable states. The classical stability
theory of the replicator dynamic is recovered in the large population limit.
Finally we include descriptions of possible extensions to populations of
variable size and populations evolving on graphs.

It is observed in numerous bacterial species that individual cells can
stochastically switch among multiple phenotypes for the population to survive
in rapidly changing environments. This kind of phenotypic heterogeneity with
stochastic phenotype switching is generally understood to be an adaptive
bet-hedging strategy. Mathematical models are essential to gain a deeper
insight into the principle behind bet-hedging and the pattern behind
experimental data. Traditional deterministic models cannot provide a correct
description of stochastic phenotype switching and bet-hedging, and traditional
Markov chain models at the cellular level fail to explain their underlying
molecular mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear stochastic model of
multistable bacterial systems at the molecular level. It turns out that our
model not only provides a clear description of stochastic phenotype switching
and bet-hedging within isogenic bacterial populations, but also provides a
deeper insight into the analysis of multidimensional experimental data.
Moreover, we use some deep mathematical theories to show that our stochastic
model and traditional Markov chain models are essentially consistent and
reflect the dynamic behavior of the bacterial system at two different time
scales. In addition, we provide a quantitative characterization of the critical
state of multistable bacterial systems and develop an effective data-driven
method to identify the critical state without resorting to specific
mathematical models.

function, but also used in many areas of physics. Here we present a theory of
the dynamics of finite-sized populations of spiking units, based on a
quasi-renewal description of neurons with adaptation. We derive an integral
equation with colored noise that governs the stochastic dynamics of the
population activity in response to time-dependent stimulation and calculate the
spectral density in the asynchronous state. We show that systems of coupled
populations with adaptation can generate a frequency band in which sensory
information is preferentially encoded. The theory is applicable to fully as
well as randomly connected networks, and to leaky integrate-and-fire as well as
to generalized spiking neurons with adaptation on multiple time scales.

$N\times N$ matrices of the form $A = M + LJR$, where $M$, $L$ and $R$ are
arbitrary deterministic matrices and $J$ is a random matrix of zero-mean
independent and identically distributed elements. For $A$ nonnormal, the
eigenvalues do not suffice to specify the dynamics induced by $A$, so we also
provide general formulae for the transient evolution of the magnitude of
activity and frequency power spectrum in an $N$-dimensional linear dynamical
system with a coupling matrix given by $A$. These quantities can also be
thought of as characterizing the stability and the magnitude of the linear
response of a nonlinear network to small perturbations about a fixed point. We
derive these formulae and work them out analytically for some examples of $M$,
$L$ and $R$ motivated by neurobiological models. We also argue that the
persistence as $N\rightarrow\infty$ of a finite number of randomly distributed
outlying eigenvalues outside the support of the eigenvalue density of $A$, as
previously observed, arises in regions of the complex plane $\Omega$ where
there are nonzero singular values of $L^{-1} (z\mathbf{1} - M) R^{-1}$ (for
$z\in\Omega$) that vanish as $N\rightarrow\infty$. When such singular values do
not exist and $L$ and $R$ are equal to the identity, there is a correspondence
in the normalized Frobenius norm (but not in the operator norm) between the
support of the spectrum of $A$ for $J$ of norm $\sigma$ and the
$\sigma$-pseudospectrum of $M$.

that evolve according to the usual principles of selection and mutation.
Quasispecies studies have invariably concentrated on the possibility of errors
during genotype replication and their role in promoting either the survival or
the demise of the quasispecies. In a previous work [V. C. Barbosa, R.
Donangelo, and S. R. Souza, J. Theor. Biol. 312, 114 (2012)], we introduced a
network model of quasispecies dynamics, based on a single probability parameter
($p$) and capable of addressing several plausibility issues of previous models.
Here we extend that model by pairing its network with another one aimed at
modeling the dynamics of the immune system when confronted with the
quasispecies. The new network is based on the idiotypic-network model of
immunity and, together with the previous one, constitutes a network model of
interacting genotypes and idiotypes. The resulting model requires further
parameters and as a consequence leads to a vast phase space. We have focused on
a particular niche in which it is possible to observe the trade-offs involved
in the quasispecies' survival or destruction. Within this niche, we give
simulation results that highlight some key preconditions for quasispecies
survival. These include a minimum initial abundance of genotypes relative to
that of the idiotypes and a minimum value of $p$. The latter, in particular, is
to be contrasted with the stand-alone quasispecies network of our previous
work, in which arbitrarily low values of $p$ constitute a guarantee of
quasispecies survival.

studied by methods of absorption and polarized fluorescent spectroscopy.
Measurements were carried out in aqueous buffered solutions (pH 6.9) of
different dye concentrations (QA concentration range from $10^{-6}$ till
$10^{-4}$ M) and ionic strengths ($Na^{+}$ concentration rang from $10^{-3}$
till 0.15 M) in a wide range of phosphate-to-dye molar ratios ($P/D$). It is
established that the minimum of fluorescent titration curve plotted as relative
fluorescence intensity $vs$ $P/D$ is conditioned by the competition between the
two types of QA binding to DNA which posses by different emission parameters:
(i) intercalative one dominating under high $P/D$ values, and (ii) outside
electrostatic binding dominating under low $P/D$ values, which is accompanied
by the formation of non-fluorescent dye associates on the DNA backbone.
Absorption and fluorescent characteristics of complexes formed were determined.
The method of calculation of different binding modes contribution to the
complex formation depending on $P/D$ value is presented. It was shown that the
size of binding site measured as the number of DNA base pairs per one QA
molecule bound in the case of the electrostatic interaction is 8 times less
than that for the intercalative one that determines the competitive ability of
the outside binding against the stronger intercalative binding mode.

stretched in nanochannels with sequence-specific fluorescent labeling,
represents a promising tool for disease diagnostics and genomics. An important
challenge for this technique is thermal motion of the DNA as it undergoes
imaging; this blurs fluorescent patterns along the DNA and results in
information loss. Correcting for this effect (a process referred to as
kymograph alignment) is a common preprocessing step in nanochannel-based
optical mapping workflows, and we present here a highly efficient algorithm to
accomplish this via pattern recognition. We compare our method with the one
previous approach, and we find that our method is orders of magnitude faster
while producing data of similar quality. We demonstrate proof of principle of
our approach on experimental data consisting of melt mapped bacteriophage DNA.

every two neurons of the network are connected by a probability of 2\%, 20\% of
neurons are inhibitory and 80\% are excitatory. These common values are based
on experiments, observations, and trials and errors, but here, I take a
different perspective, inspired by evolution, I systematically simulate many
networks, each with a different set of parameters, and then I try to figure out
what makes the common values desirable. I stimulate networks with pulses and
then measure their: dynamic range, dominant frequency of population activities,
total duration of activities, maximum rate of population and the occurrence
time of maximum rate. The results are organized in phase diagram. This phase
diagram gives an insight into the space of parameters -- excitatory to
inhibitory ratio, sparseness of connections and synaptic weights. This phase
diagram can be used to decide the parameters of a model. The phase diagrams
show that networks which are configured according to the common values, have a
good dynamic range in response to an impulse and their dynamic range is robust
in respect to synaptic weights, and for some synaptic weights they oscillate in
$\alpha$ or $\beta$ frequencies, even in absence of external stimuli.

clustering reads by sequence similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs), underexploits the accuracy of modern sequencing technology. We present
a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina datasets that can identify
independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S
tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of
human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97% similarity
OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S
tags differing by as little as 1 nucleotide (99.2% similarity). A comparative
analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most
such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100% sequence
identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is
strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in
the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in
cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We
discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into
factors shaping community assembly.

which drives the rotation of flagellar filaments and enable bacteria to swim in
viscous solutions. Understanding its mechanism is one challenge in biophysics.
Based on previous models and inspired by the idea used in description of motor
proteins, in this study one two-state model is provided. Meanwhile, according
to corresponding experimental data, mathematical relationship between BFM
membrane voltage and pH value of the environment, and relationship between
internal and external sodium concentrations are given. Therefore, with model
parameter values obtained by fitting theoretical results of torque-speed
relation to recent experimental data, many biophysical properties of bacterial
flagellar motor can be obtained for any pH values and any external sodium
concentrations. Including the rotation speed, stall torque (i.e. the torque
generated by BFM), rotation dispersion, and rotation randomness. In this study,
the single-stator BFM will be firstly analyzed, and then properties of
multiple-stator BFM are addressed briefly.

in theoretical population genetics and molecular evolution. Here we derive a
series of identities, inequalities and approximations for the exact probability
of fixation of a new mutation under the Moran process (equivalent results hold
for the approximate probability of fixation for the Wright-Fisher process after
an appropriate change of variables). We show that the behavior of the logarithm
of the probability of fixation is particularly simple when the selection
coefficient is measured as a difference of Malthusian fitnesses, and we exploit
this simplicity to derive several inequalities and approximations. We also
present a comprehensive comparison of both existing and new approximations for
the probability of fixation, highlighting in particular approximations that
result in a reversible Markov chain when used to model the dynamics of
evolution under weak mutation.

of individuals from a diverse network of ancestries. An important, unsolved
problem is how to formulate and estimate probabilistic models of observed
genotypes that allow for complex population structure. We formulate two general
probabilistic models, and we propose computationally efficient algorithms to
estimate them. First, we show how principal component analysis (PCA) can be
utilized to estimate a general model that includes the well-known
Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly mixed-membership model as a special case. Noting
some drawbacks of this approach, we introduce a new &quot;logistic factor analysis&quot;
(LFA) framework that seeks to directly model the logit transformation of
probabilities underlying observed genotypes in terms of latent variables that
capture population structure. We demonstrate these advances on data from the
human genome diversity panel and 1000 genomes project, where we are able to
identify SNPs that are highly differentiated with respect to structure while
making minimal modeling assumptions.

in infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing HCV transmission in this
population (such as opioid substitution therapy, needle exchange programs or
improved treatment) are difficult to evaluate using field surveys. Ethical
issues and complicated access to the PWID population make it difficult to
gather epidemiological data. In this context, mathematical modelling of HCV
transmission is a useful alternative for comparing the cost and effectiveness
of various interventions. Several models have been developed in the past few
years. They are often based on strong hypotheses concerning the population
structure. This review presents compartmental and individual-based models in
order to underline their strengths and limits in the context of HCV infection
among PWID. The final section discusses the main results of the papers.

biological competition in which birth and death rates of an organism depend on
the presence of other competing organisms close to it. In addition the
individuals perform random walks of different types (Gaussian diffusion and
L\'{e}vy flights). We focus on how competition and random motions affect each
other, from which spatial instabilities and extinctions arise. Under suitable
conditions, competitive interactions lead to clustering of individuals and
periodic pattern formation. Random motion has a homogenizing effect and then
delays this clustering instability. When individuals from species differing in
their random walk characteristics are allowed to compete together, the ones
with a tendency to form narrower clusters get a competitive advantage over the
others. Mean-field deterministic equations are analyzed and compared with the
outcome of the individual-based simulations.

physics, whose combination is needed when studying the dynamical organization
of spatially distributed systems from indirect measurements. However, the
associated connectivity estimation may be affected by spatial leakage, an
artifact of inverse modeling that limits the interpretability of network
analysis. This paper investigates general analytical aspects pertaining to this
issue. First, the existence of spatial leakage is derived from the topological
structure of inverse operators. Then, the geometry of spatial leakage is
modeled and used to define a geometric correction scheme, which limits spatial
leakage effects in connectivity estimation. Finally, this new approach for
network analysis is compared analytically to existing methods based on linear
regressions, which are shown to yield biased coupling estimates.

popular, there has been increasing interest in the development of
capture-recapture models that can accommodate both imperfect detection and
misidentification of individuals (e.g., due to genotyping error). However,
current methods do not allow for individual variation in parameters, such as
detection or survival probability. Here we develop misidentification models for
capture-recapture data that can simultaneously account for temporal variation,
behavioral effects and individual heterogeneity in parameters. To facilitate
Bayesian inference using our approach, we extend standard probit regression
techniques to latent multinomial models where the dimension and zeros of the
response cannot be observed. We also present a novel Metropolis-Hastings within
Gibbs algorithm for fitting these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Using
closed population abundance models for illustration, we re-visit a DNA
capture-recapture population study of black bears in Michigan, USA and find
evidence of misidentification due to genotyping error, as well as temporal,
behavioral and individual variation in detection probability. We also estimate
a salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating
the effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish.
Our model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and
provided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability
that is attributable to variable mark quality. Our approach is more
computationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the
flexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while
properly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and
imperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit
formulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian
analysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data.

probability, individuals who are genealogical ancestors of every extant
individual within approximately $\log_2(N)$ generations into the past. We use
this result of J. Chang to prove a curious corollary under standard models of
recombination: there exist, with high probability, individuals within a
constant multiple of $ \log_2(N)$ generations into the past who are
simultaneously (i) genealogical ancestors of {\em each} of the individuals at
the present, and (ii) genetic ancestors to {\em none} of the individuals at the
present. Such ancestral individuals - ancestors of everyone today that left no
genetic trace -- represent `ghost' ancestors in a strong sense. In this short
note, we use simple analytical argument and simulations to estimate how many
such individuals exist in finite Wright-Fisher populations.

leading to sudden qualitative and sometimes irreversible regime shifts. The
development of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge. Recent
progress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is
described by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key
variables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.
Here we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we
frequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism
leading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been
missed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type
mechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a
saddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over
substantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type
transition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological
data. This work thus establishes a connection from critical transitions to
networks and an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition. In
complex models and big data we anticipate that saddle-transitions will be
encountered frequently in the future.

aquatic animals in terms of a balance between the forward thrust from swimming
movements and drag on the body. Prior approaches have failed to provide a
separation of these two forces for undulatory swimmers such as lamprey and
eels, where most parts of the body are simultaneously generating drag and
thrust. We nonetheless show that this separation is possible, and delineate its
fundamental basis in undulatory swimmers. Our approach unifies a vast diversity
of undulatory aquatic animals (anguilliform, sub-carangiform, gymnotiform, bal-
istiform, rajiform) and provides design principles for highly agile bioinspired
underwater vehicles. This approach has practical utility within biology as well
as engineering. It is a predictive tool for use in understanding the role of
the mechanics of movement in the evolutionary emergence of morphological
features relating to locomotion. For example, we demonstrate that the
drag-thrust separation framework helps to predict the observed height of the
ribbon fin of electric knifefish, a diverse group of neotropical fishes which
are an important model system in sensory neurobiology. We also show how
drag-thrust separation leads to models that can predict the swimming velocity
of an organism or a robotic vehicle.

kinetics, and compare the performance of exact simulation with a commonly used
numerical approximation strategy. The first representation we present is a
random time change representation, popularized by Thomas Kurtz, with the second
being analogous to a &quot;Gillespie&quot; representation. Exact stochastic algorithms
are provided for the different representations, which are preferable to either
(a) fixed time step or (b) piecewise constant propensity algorithms, which
still appear in the literature. As examples, we provide versions of the exact
algorithms for the Morris-Lecar conductance based model, and detail the error
induced, both in a weak and a strong sense, by the use of approximate
algorithms on this model. We include ready-to-use implementations of the random
time change algorithm in both XPP and Matlab. Finally, through the
consideration of parametric sensitivity analysis, we show how the
representations presented here are useful in the development of further
computational methods. The general representations and simulation strategies
provided here are known in other parts of the sciences, but less so in the
present setting.

presented. It is based on a randomly connected recurrent neural network from
which both perception and action are simultaneously read and fed back. There
are two concurrent learning rules implementing a sort of ideomotor control: (i)
perception is learned along the principle that the network should predict
reliably its incoming stimuli; (ii) action is learned along the principle that
the prediction of the network should match a target time series. The coherent
behavior of the neural network in its environment is a consequence of the
interaction between the two principles. Numerical simulations show the
promising performance of the approach, which can be turned into a local, and
thus &quot;biologically plausible&quot;, algorithm.

genome has been an issue of debate for over a decade. Some groups have proposed
that the quantitative distribution of the DNA codons ordered as a
rank-frequency plot follows a well-known power law called Zipf's law. Others
have shown that the DNA codon distribution is best fitted to an exponential
function. However, the reason for such scaling behavior has not yet been
addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the nonlinearity of the
DNA codon distribution is a direct consequence of the frequency recurrence of
the codon usage (i.e., the repetitiveness of codon usage frequencies at the
whole genome level). We discover that if frequency recurrence is absent from
the human genome, the frequency of occurrence of codons scales linearly with
the codon rank. We also show that DNA codons of both low and high frequency of
occurrence in the genome are best fitted by an exponential function and provide
strong evidence to suggest that the coding region of the human genome does not
follow Zipf's law. Information-theoretic methods and entropy calculations are
applied to the DNA codon distribution and a new approach, called the lariat
method, is proposed to quantitatively analyze the DNA codon distribution in
Homo sapiens.

cohesiveness. Several species of them live in multilevel societies, and form
herds composed of smaller communities. We present a model for the development
of a leadership hierarchy in a herd consisting of loosely connected sub-groups
(e.g. harems) by combining self organization and social dynamics. It starts
from unfamiliar individuals without relationships and reproduces the emergence
of a hierarchical and modular leadership network that promotes an effective
spreading of the decisions from more capable individuals to the others, and
thus gives rise to a beneficial collective decision. Our results stemming from
the model are in a good agreement with our observations of a Przewalski horse
herd (Hortob\'agy, Hungary). We find that the harem-leader to harem-member
ratio observed in Przewalski horses corresponds to an optimal network in this
approach regarding common success, and that the observed and modeled harem size
distributions are close to a lognormal.

velocities. A good understanding of this collective behavior exists for linear
motion of the flock. Yet observing actual birds, the center of mass of the
group often turns giving rise to more complicated dynamics, still keeping
strong polarization of the flock. Here we propose novel dynamical equations for
the collective motion of polarized animal groups that account for correlated
turning including solely social forces. We exploit rotational symmetries and
conservation laws of the problem to formulate a theory in terms of generalized
coordinates of motion for the velocity directions akin to a Hamiltonian
formulation for rotations. We explicitly derive the correspondence between this
formulation and the dynamics of the individual velocities, thus obtaining a new
model of collective motion. In the appropriate overdamped limit we recover the
well-known Vicsek model, which dissipates rotational information and does not
allow for polarized turns. Although the new model has its most vivid success in
describing turning groups, its dynamics is intrinsically different from
previous ones in a wide dynamical regime, while reducing to the hydrodynamic
description of Toner and Tu at very large length-scales. The derived framework
is therefore general and it may describe the collective motion of any strongly
polarized active matter system.

dynamics of the overall system is a key focus of computational biology.
However, as these networks and resulting mathematical models are inherently
complex and non-linear, the understanding of this relationship becomes
challenging. Among many approaches, model reduction methods provide an avenue
to extract components responsible for the key dynamical features of the system.
Unfortunately, these approaches often require intuition to apply. In this
manuscript we propose a practical algorithm for the reduction of biochemical
reaction systems using fast-slow asymptotics. This method allows the ranking of
system variables according to how quickly they approach their momentary steady
state, thus selecting the fastest for a steady state approximation. We applied
this method to derive models of the Nuclear Factor kappa B network, a key
regulator of the immune response that exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Analyses
with respect to two specific solutions, which corresponded to different
experimental conditions identified different components of the system that were
responsible for the respective dynamics. This is an important demonstration of
how reduction methods that provide approximations around a specific steady
state, could be utilised in order to gain a better understanding of network
topology in a broader context.

outside physics, including in cognitive science. We analyze the applicability
of QM to two basic properties in opinion polling. The first property (response
replicability) is that, for a large class of questions, a response to a given
question is expected to be repeated if the question is posed again,
irrespective of whether another question is asked and answered in between. The
second property (question order effect) is that the response probabilities
frequently depend on the order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these
two properties occur together, it poses a problem for QM. The conventional QM
with Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the way
incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization of QM known
as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in order to account for
response replicability, the POVMs involved must be conventional operators.
Although these problems are not unique to QM and also challenge conventional
cognitive theories, they stand out as important unresolved problems for the
application of QM to cognition . Either some new principles are needed to
determine the bounds of applicability of QM to cognition, or quantum formalisms
more general than POVMs are needed.

studying the interplay between network topology and dynamics. This subject is a
topic of practical relevance to diverse fields, ranging from neuroscience to
engineering. Here we analyze how a single excitation propagates through a
random network as a function of the excitation threshold, that is, the relative
amount of activity in the neighborhood required for an excitation of a node.
Using numerical simulations and analytical considerations, we can understand
the onset of sustained activity as an interplay between topological cycle
statistics and path statistics. Our findings are interpreted in the context of
the theory of network reverberations in neural systems, which is a question of
long-standing interest in computational neuroscience.

on a Markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix is applied to the
analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics. The transition to bistability
due to the small-number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable
states are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations. In
addition, a novel transition involving the reversal of the chemical reaction
flow is found in the model under an external flow, and also in a
three-component model. The generality of this transition and its correspondence
to biological phenomena are also discussed.

Anthropogenic actions cause rapid ecological changes, meaning that animals
have to respond before they have time to adapt. Tools to quantify emergent
spatial patterns from animal-habitat interaction mechanisms are vital for
predicting the population-level effects of such changes.
  2. Environmental perturbations are particularly prevalent in the Amazon
rainforest, and have a profound effect on fragmentation-sensitive insectivorous
bird flocks. Therefore it is important to be able to predict the effects of
such changes on the flocks' space-use patterns.
  3. We use a step selection function (SSF) approach to uncover environmental
drivers behind movement choices. This is used to construct a mechanistic model,
from which we derive predicted utilization distributions (home ranges) of
flocks.
  4. We show that movement decisions are significantly influenced by canopy
height and topography, but not resource depletion and renewal. We quantify the
magnitude of these effects and demonstrate that they are helpful for
understanding various heterogeneous aspects of space use. We compare our
results to recent analytic derivations of space use, demonstrating that they
are only accurate when assuming that there is no persistence in the animals'
movement.
  5. Our model can be translated into other environments or hypothetical
scenarios, such as those given by proposed future anthropogenic actions, to
make predictions of spatial patterns in bird flocks. Furthermore, our approach
is quite general, so could be used to predict the effects of habitat changes on
spatial patterns for a wide variety of animal communities.

risk taking is essential for treatment and for setting environmental conditions
to limit damage. Using Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning (TDRL) we
computationally investigated the effect of optimism in risk perception in a
variety of goal-oriented tasks. Optimism in risk perception was studied by
varying the calculation of the Temporal Difference error, i.e., delta, in three
ways: realistic (stochastically correct), optimistic (assuming action control),
and overly optimistic (assuming outcome control). We show that for the gambling
task individuals with 'healthy' perception of control, i.e., action optimism,
do not develop gambling behaviour while individuals with 'unhealthy' perception
of control, i.e., outcome optimism, do. We show that high intensity of
sensations and low levels of fear co-occur due to optimistic risk perception.
We found that overly optimistic risk perception (outcome optimism) results in
risk taking and in persistent gambling behaviour in addition to high intensity
of sensations. We discuss how our results replicate risk-taking related
phenomena.

widely studied in epidemiology and in metapopulation theory. Contacts are
usually assumed to be possible only through a network of connected patches.
This network accounts for a spatial landscape or a social organisation of
interactions. Thanks to social network literature, heterogeneous networks of
contacts can be considered. A major issue is to assess the influence of the
network in the dynamic model. Most work with this common purpose uses
deterministic models or an approximation of a stochastic
Extinction-Colonisation model (sEC) which are relevant only for large networks.
When working with a limited size network, the induced stochasticity is
essential and has to be taken into account in the conclusions. Here, a rigorous
framework is proposed for limited size networks and the limitations of the
deterministic approximation are exhibited. This framework allows exact
computations when the number of patches is small. Otherwise, simulations are
used and enhanced by adapted simulation techniques when necessary. A
sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare four main topologies of networks
in contrasting settings to determine the role of the network. A challenging
case was studied in this context: seed exchange of crop species in the R\'eseau
Semences Paysannes (RSP), an emergent French farmers' organisation. A
stochastic Extinction-Colonisation model was used to characterize the
consequences of substantial changes in terms of RSP's social organisation on
the ability of the system to maintain crop varieties.

seeking to gain parts of space for their exclusive use. It arises through a
complicated interplay of many different behavioural features. Extracting and
quantifying the processes that give rise to territorial patterns requires both
mathematical models of movement and interaction mechanisms, together with
statistical techniques for rigorously extracting parameters from data. Here, we
give a brisk, pedagogical overview of the techniques so far developed to tackle
the problem of territory formation. We give some examples of what has already
been achieved using these techniques, together with pointers as to where we
believe the future lies in this area of study. This progress is a single
example of a major aim for 21st century science: to construct quantitatively
predictive theory for ecological systems.

the patterning for the ocellar complex formation in Drosophila melanogaster
fly. We have systematically pruned the GRN that drives the development of this
visual system to obtain the minimum pathway able to satisfy this pattern. We
found that the mechanism underlying the patterning obeys to the dynamics of a
3-nodes network motif with a double negative feedback loop fed by a
morphogenetic gradient that triggers the inhibition in a French flag problem
fashion. A Boolean modeling of the GRN confirms robustness in the patterning
mechanism showing the same result for different network complexity levels.
Interestingly, the network provides a steady state solution in the interocellar
part of the patterning and an oscillatory regime in the ocelli. This
theoretical result predicts that the ocellar pattern may underlie oscillatory
dynamics in its genetic regulation.

the brain and shape the landscape for the neural dynamics occurring on
substantially faster timescales. At any given time the network is characterized
by a set of internal parameters, which are adapting continuously, albeit
slowly. This set of parameters defines the number and the location of the
respective adiabatic attractors. The slow evolution of network parameters hence
induces an evolving attractor landscape, a process which we term attractor
metadynamics. We study the nature of the metadynamics of the attractor
landscape for several continuous-time autonomous model networks. We find both
first- and second-order changes in the location of adiabatic attractors and
argue that the study of the continuously evolving attractor landscape
constitutes a powerful tool for understanding the overall development of the
neural dynamics.

One important characteristic is the actual occupancy of a putative binding site
in the genome. In this study, we propose an analytical model to predict genomic
occupancy that incorporates the preferred target sequence of a TF in the form
of a position weight matrix (PWM), DNA accessibility data (in case of
eukaryotes), the number of TF molecules expected to be bound specifically to
the DNA and a parameter that modulates the specificity of the TF. Given actual
occupancy data in form of ChIP-seq profiles, we backwards inferred copy number
and specificity for five Drosophila TFs during early embryonic development:
Bicoid, Caudal, Giant, Hunchback and Kruppel. Our results suggest that these
TFs display thousands of molecules that are specifically bound to the DNA and
that, while Bicoid and Caudal display a higher specificity, the other three
transcription factors (Giant, Hunchback and Kruppel) display lower specificity
in their binding (despite having PWMs with higher information content). This
study gives further weight to earlier investigations into TF copy numbers that
suggest a significant proportion of molecules are not bound specifically to the
DNA.

worth asking what mechanisms allow presumably valuable resources to be left
unused? Evolutionary biologists have generated a wide range of hypotheses to
explain this, ranging from interdemic group selection to selfishly prudent
individual restraint. We consider a situation in which, in spite of high
intraspecific competition, individuals leave most of a key resource
unexploited. The parasitic wasp that does this finds virtually all host egg
clusters in a landscape, but parasitizes only about a third of the eggs in
each, and then leaves a deterrent mark around the cluster. We first test, and
reject, a series of system-specific simple constraints that might limit full
host exploitation, such as asynchronous maturation of host eggs. We then
consider classical hypotheses for the evolution of restraint. Prudent predation
and bet-hedging fail as explanations because the wasp lives as a large
well-mixed population. Also, we find no individual benefits to the parasitoid
of developing in a sparsely parasitized host nest. However an optimal foraging
model, including empirically measured costs of superparasitism and
hyperparasitism, can explain through individual selection, both the
consistently low rate of parasitism and marking.

(2014) vol. 118, 7910-7919</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Enhanced dynamical fluctuations of RNAs, facilitated by a network of water
molecules with strong interactions with RNA, are suspected to be critical in
their ability to respond to a variety of cellular signals. Using atomically
detailed molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures of purine
(adenine)- and preQ$_1$ sensing riboswitch aptamers, we show that water
molecules in the vicinity of RNAs undergo complex dynamics depending on the
local structures of the RNAs. The overall lifetimes of hydrogen bonds (HBs) of
surface bound waters are more than at least 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than
bulk water. Slow hydration dynamics, revealed in non-Arrhenius behavior of the
relaxation time, arises from high activation barriers to break water hydrogen
bonds with a nucleotide and by reduced diffusion of water. The relaxation
kinetics at specific locations in the two RNAs show a broad spectrum of time
scales reminiscent of glass-like behavior, suggesting that the hydration
dynamics is highly heterogeneous. Both RNAs undergo dynamic transition at $T =
T_D \gtrsim 200$ K as assessed by the mean square fluctuation of hydrogen atoms
$\langle x^2\rangle$, which undergoes an abrupt harmonic-to-anharmonic
transition at $T_D$. The near universal value of $T_D$ found for these RNAs and
previously for tRNA is strongly correlated with changes in hydration dynamics
as $T$ is altered. Hierarchical dynamics of waters associated with the RNA
surface, revealed in the motions of distinct classes of water with
well-separated time scales, reflects the heterogeneous local environment on the
molecular surface of RNA. At low temperatures slow water dynamics predominates
over structural transitions. Our study demonstrates that the complex interplay
of dynamics between water and local environment in the RNA structures could be
a key determinant of the functional activities of RNA.

hierarchical modeling, we demonstrate some distinct advantages and

using real or simulated numerical examples in applications of single SNP
association testing, multi-locus fine-mapping and SNP set association testing.

increasing demand for computational resources for their simulation.
Neuromorphic devices offer a number of advantages over conventional computing
architectures, such as high emulation speed or low power consumption, but this
usually comes at the price of reduced configurability and precision. In this
article, we investigate the consequences of several such factors that are
common to neuromorphic devices, more specifically limited hardware resources,
limited parameter configurability and parameter variations. Our final aim is to
provide an array of methods for coping with such inevitable distortion
mechanisms. As a platform for testing our proposed strategies, we use an
executable system specification (ESS) of the BrainScaleS neuromorphic system,
which has been designed as a universal emulation back-end for neuroscientific
modeling. We address the most essential limitations of this device in detail
and study their effects on three prototypical benchmark network models within a
well-defined, systematic workflow. For each network model, we start by defining
quantifiable functionality measures by which we then assess the effects of
typical hardware-specific distortion mechanisms, both in idealized software
simulations and on the ESS. For those effects that cause unacceptable
deviations from the original network dynamics, we suggest generic compensation
mechanisms and demonstrate their effectiveness. Both the suggested workflow and
the investigated compensation mechanisms are largely back-end independent and
do not require additional hardware configurability beyond the one required to
emulate the benchmark networks in the first place. We hereby provide a generic
methodological environment for configurable neuromorphic devices that are
targeted at emulating large-scale, functional neural networks.

biological and technological networks. A bow-tie in a multi-layered structure
occurs when intermediate layers have much fewer components than the input and
output layers. Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks
mediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass
components, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor
types passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple
output genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.
Here, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of
multi-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find
that bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the
evolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal
number of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of
mutations on interaction intensities between components are described by
product rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.
Product-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used
sum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These
conditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the
intermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank
of the evolutionary goal. These findings can help explain the presence of
bow-ties in diverse biological systems, and can also be relevant for machine
learning applications that employ multi-layered networks.

Both theory and simulations of
current models predict the onset of instability with growing size and
complexity, so for decades it has been conjectured that ecosystems must have
some unidentified structural property exempting them from this outcome. We show
that 'trophic coherence' -- a hitherto ignored feature of food webs which
current structural models fail to reproduce -- is a better statistical
predictor of linear stability than size or complexity. Furthermore, we prove
that a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will
always be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model which, by correctly
capturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their
stability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows
that stability can increase with size and complexity. This suggests a key to
May's Paradox, and a range of opportunities and concerns for biodiversity
conservation.

describe the relationship between promoter strength and its nucleotide
sequence. Our analysis shows that, promoter strength is greatly influenced by
nucleotide groups with three adjacent nucleotides in its sequence. Meanwhile,
nucleotides in different regions of promoter sequence have different effects on
promoter strength. Based on experimental data for {\it E. coli} promoters, our
calculations indicate, nucleotides in -10 region, -35 region, and the
discriminator region of promoter sequence are more important than those in
spacing region for determining promoter strength. With model parameter values
obtained by fitting to experimental data, four promoter libraries are
theoretically built for the corresponding experimental environments under which
data for promoter strength in gene expression has been measured previously.

for the transformation of a long polypeptide between an unstructured coil
conformation and an $\alpha$-helix conformation. The polypeptide is assumed to
be adsorbed to the interface between a polar and a non-polar environment such
as realized by water and the lipid bilayer of a membrane. The interfacial
coil-helix transformation is the first stage in the folding process of helical
membrane proteins. Depending on the values of model parameters, the
conformation changes as a crossover, a discontinuous transition, or a
continuous transition with helicity in the role of order parameter. Our model
is constructed as a system of statistically interacting quasiparticles that are
activated from the helix pseudo-vacuum. The particles represent links between
adjacent residues in coil conformation that form a self-avoiding random walk in
two dimensions. Explicit results are presented for helicity, entropy, heat
capacity, and the average numbers and sizes of both coil and helix segments.

to quantify the association between groups of genes and a clinical phenotype.
In many cases, however, a gene set-based interpretation of genomic data is
desired in the absence of a phenotype variable. Although methods exist for
unsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative
to clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the
clustering algorithm and number of clusters. Results: We propose a novel
method, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive
testing of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE
first computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal
components (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE)
method. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the
spectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level
p-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled
by Tracey-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE
algorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To
illustrate the utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior
performance of the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques
for testing the association between MSigDB gene sets and the variance structure
of microarray gene expression data. Availability:

improved accuracy is proposed using undersampled Cartesian spin-echo MRI data.
The technique employs an advanced signal model for T2 relaxation that accounts
for contributions from indirect echoes in a train of multiple spin echoes. An
iterative solution of the nonlinear inverse reconstruction problem directly
estimates spin-density and T2 maps from undersampled raw data. The algorithm is
validated for simulated data as well as phantom and human brain MRI at 3 T. The
performance of the advanced model is compared to conventional pixel-based
fitting of echo-time images from fully sampled data. The proposed method yields
more accurate T2 values than the mono-exponential model and allows for
undersampling factors of at least 6. Although limitations are observed for very
long T2 relaxation times, respective reconstruction problems may be overcome by
a gradient dampening approach. The analytical gradient of the utilized cost
function is included as Appendix.

functional unit (a placentone). The effect of villi density on oxygen transfer
efficiency is assessed by numerically solving the diffusion-convection equation
in a 2D+1D geometry for a wide range of villi densities. For each set of
physiological parameters, we observe the existence of an optimal villi density
providing a maximal oxygen uptake as a trade-off between the incoming oxygen
flow and the absorbing villus surface. The predicted optimal villi density
$0.47\pm0.06$ is compatible to previous experimental measurements. Several
other ways to experimentally validate the model are also proposed. The proposed
stream-tube model can serve as a basis for analyzing the efficiency of human
placentas, detecting possible pathologies and diagnosing placental health risks
for newborns by using routine histology sections collected after birth.

nucleotide variation (SNV) in next generation sequencing data. For instance,
errors may be introduced during library construction and sequencing steps. In
addition, the reference genome and the algorithms used for the alignment of the
reads are further critical factors determining the efficacy of variant calling
methods. It is crucial to account for these factors in individual sequencing
experiments.
  Results: We introduce a simple data-adaptive model for variant calling. This
model automatically adjusts to specific factors such as alignment errors. To
achieve this, several characteristics are sampled from sites with low mismatch
rates, and these are used to estimate empirical log-likelihoods. These
likelihoods are then combined to a score that typically gives rise to a mixture
distribution. From these we determine a decision threshold to separate
potentially variant sites from the noisy background.
  Conclusions: In simulations we show that our simple proposed model is
competitive with frequently used much more complex SNV calling algorithms in
terms of sensitivity and specificity. It performs specifically well in cases
with low allele frequencies. The application to next-generation sequencing data
reveals stark differences of the score distributions indicating a strong
influence of data specific sources of noise. The proposed model is specifically
designed to adjust to these differences.

de novo is an unsolved problem in synthetic biology. To address this limitation
without resorting to ad hoc computations and experiments, a predictive
mathematical theory is required to reduce these complex chemical networks into
natural physico-chemical expressions. Here we provide a theory that offers a
physico-chemical expression for a large chemical network that is almost
arbitrarily both nonlinear and complex. Unexpectedly, the theory demonstrates
that such networks can be decomposed into reactions based solely on the Hill
equation, a simple chemical logic gate. This theory, analogous to implemented
electrical logic gates or functional algorithms in a computer, is proposed for
implementing regulated sequences of functional chemical reactions, such as
mimicked genes, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, protein
interaction, and metabolic networks, into an artificial designed chemical
network.

consistent with those of MD simulations, at a computational cost orders of

  diffusion</title><categories>cs.PF math.PR q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper we consider large state space continuous time Markov chains
(MCs) arising in the field of systems biology. For density dependent families
of MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,
Kurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary
differential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The
computational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,
but the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce
relevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a
recent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump
diffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of
Kurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary
with non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion
approximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results
when the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that
it can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to
overcome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion
approximation only to those components of the model that are in density
dependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining
components are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a
hybrid switching jump diffusion. We show that the stochastic differential
equations that characterize this process can be derived automatically both from
the description of the original Markov chains or starting from a higher level
description language, like stochastic Petri nets. The proposed approach is
illustrated on three models: one modeling the so called crazy clock reaction,
one describing viral infection kinetics and the last considering transcription
regulation.

landscape with countable targets. In our approach, foraging is a step-based
exploratory random search process with a power-law step-size distribution $P(l)
\propto l^{-\mu}$. We find that, when the termination is regulated by a finite
number of steps $N$, the optimum value of $\mu$ that maximises the foraging
efficiency can vary substantially in the interval $\mu \in (1,3)$, depending on
the landscape features (landscape size and number of targets). We further
demonstrate that subjective returning can be another significant factor that
affects the foraging efficiency in such context. Our results suggest that
L\'{e}vy-flight foraging may arise through an interaction between the
environmental context and the termination of exploitation, and particularly
that the number of steps can play an important role in this scenario which is
overlooked by most previous work. Our study not only provides a new perspective
on L\'{e}vy-flight foraging, but also opens new avenues for investigating the
interaction between foraging dynamics and environment as well as offers a
realistic framework for analysing animal movement patterns from empirical data.

activations is essential in order for the entire recent past to be
simultaneously accessible. Any biological or synthetic agent that relies on the
past to predict/plan the future, would be endowed with such a spatially
distributed temporal memory. Simplistically, we would expect that resource
limitations would demand the memory system to store only the most useful
information for future prediction. For natural signals in real world which show
scale free temporal fluctuations, the predictive information encoded in memory
is maximal if the past information is scale invariantly coarse grained. Here we
examine the general mechanism to construct a scale invariantly coarse grained
memory system. Remarkably, the generic construction is equivalent to encoding
the linear combinations of Laplace transform of the past information and their
approximated inverses. This reveals a fundamental construction constraint on
memory networks that attempt to maximize predictive information storage
relevant to the natural world.

through the concentration field of the chemicals they secrete is studied using
dynamical renormalization group methods. The combination of the effective
long-range chemotactic interaction and lack of number conservation leads to a
rich variety of phase behaviour in the system, which includes a sharp
transition from a phase that has moderate (or controlled) growth and regulated
chemical interactions to a phase with strong (or uncontrolled) growth and no
chemical interactions. The transition point has nontrivial critical exponents.
Our results might help shed light on the interplay between chemical signalling
and growth in tissues and colonies, and in particular on the challenging
problem of cancer metastasis.

equations governing oxygen transport in the human placenta. We show that only
two geometrical characteristics of a placental cross-section, villi density and
the effective villi radius, are needed to predict fetal oxygen uptake. We also
identify two combinations of physiological parameters that determine oxygen
uptake in a given placenta: (i) the maximal oxygen inflow of a placentone if
there were no tissue blocking the flow, and (ii) the ratio of transit time of
maternal blood through the intervillous space to oxygen extraction time. We
derive analytical formulas for fast and simple calculation of oxygen uptake and
provide two diagrams of efficiency of oxygen transport in an arbitrary
placental cross-section. We finally show that artificial perfusion experiments
with no-hemoglobin blood tend to give a two-orders-of-magnitude underestimation
of the in vivo oxygen uptake and that the optimal geometry for such setup
alters significantly. The theory allows one to adjust the results of artificial
placenta perfusion experiments to account for oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation.
Combined with image analysis techniques, the presented model can give an
easy-to-use tool for prediction of the human placenta efficiency.

random events at the molecular level influence cellular functions. In practice,
the common challenge is to calibrate a large number of model parameters against
the experimental data. A related problem is to efficiently study how the
behaviour of a stochastic model depends on its parameters, i.e. whether a
change in model parameters can lead to a significant qualitative change in
model behaviour (bifurcation). In this paper, tensor-structured parametric
analysis (TPA) is presented. It is based on recently proposed low-parametric
tensor-structured representations of classical matrices and vectors. This
approach enables simultaneous computation of the model properties for all
parameter values within a parameter space. This methodology is exemplified to
study the parameter estimation, robustness, sensitivity and bifurcation
structure in stochastic models of biochemical networks. The TPA has been
implemented in Matlab and the codes are available at http://www.stobifan.org .

thermodynamic stability of the surrounding membrane. When the coupling between
membrane composition and curvature is strong enough the nearby composition and
shape both undergo a transition from over-damped to under-damped spatial
variation, well before the membrane becomes unstable in the bulk. This
transition is associated with a change in the sign of the thermodynamic energy
and hence has the unusual features that it can favour the early stages of coat
assembly necessary for vesiculation (budding), while suppressing the activity
of mechanosensitive membrane channels and transporters. Our results also
suggest an approach to obtain physical parameters that are otherwise difficult
to measure.

system and the heat bath plays an important role in the system dynamics. This
is particularly true in the case of non-Markovian noise. We rigorously
investigate the influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced
hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in
imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature. It is shown that the
HEOM in real time obtained when we include the system-bath coherence of the
initial thermal equilibrium state possess the same form as those obtained from
a factorized initial state. We find that the difference in behavior of systems
treated in these two manners results from the difference in initial conditions
of the HEOM elements, which are defined in path integral form. We also derive
HEOM along the imaginary time path to obtain the thermal equilibrium state of a
system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian bath. Then, we show that the steady
state hierarchy elements calculated from the real-time HEOM can be expressed in
terms of the hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM.
Moreover, we find that the imaginary-time HEOM allow us to evaluate a number of
thermodynamic variables, including the free energy, entropy, internal energy,
heat capacity, and susceptibility. The expectation values of the system energy
and system-bath interaction energy in the thermal equilibrium state are also
evaluated.

community. We introduce an individual-based model of the community that takes
into account both prey and predator phenotypes. Our aim is to understand the
phenotypic coevolution of prey and predators. The community evolves as a
multi-type birth and death process with mutations. We first consider the
infinite particle approximation of the process without mutation. In this limit,
the process can be approximated by a system of differential equations. We prove
the existence of a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium under
specific conditions on the interaction among prey individuals. When mutations
are rare, the community evolves on the mutational scale according to a
Markovian jump process. This process describes the successive equilibria of the
prey-predator community and extends the Polymorphic Evolutionary Sequence to a
coevolutionary framework. We then assume that mutations have a small impact on
phenotypes and consider the evolution of monomorphic prey and predator
populations. The limit of small mutation steps leads to a system of two
differential equations which is a version of the canonical equation of adaptive
dynamics for the prey-predator coevolution. We illustrate these different
limits with an example of prey-predator community that takes into account
different prey defense mechanisms. We observe through simulations how these
various prey strategies impact the community.

bacteria E. coli grown on minimal media, we aimed to determine the lowest
deuterium concentration at which the adverse effects that are prominent at
higher enrichments start to become noticeable. Such a threshold was found at
0.5% D, a surprisingly high value, while the ultralow deuterium concentrations
(up to 0.25% D) showed signs of the opposite trend. Bacterial adaptation for
400 generations in isotopically different environment confirmed preference for
ultralow (up to 0.25% D) enrichment. This effect appears to be similar to those
described in sporadic but multiple earlier reports. Possible explanations
include hormesis and isotopic resonance phenomena, with the latter explanation
being favored.

which is both computationally efficient and numerically stable. The algorithms
we present are also physically transparent and so allow us to extend this
method from the basic SIR model to a model with a phase-type infectious period
and another with waning immunity. The underlying theory is applicable to many
Markovian models where we wish to efficiently calculate hitting probabilities.

drift and determines their evolution. Building up on a recently proposed
method, which hinges on the emergence of a time scale separation between local
and global dynamics, we study the fixation properties of subdivided populations
in the presence of balancing selection. The approximation implied by the method
is accurate when the effective selection strength is small and the number of
subpopulations is large. In particular, it predicts a phase transition between
species coexistence and biodiversity loss in the infinite-size limit and, in
finite populations, a nonmonotonic dependence of the mean fixation time on the
migration rate. In order to investigate the fixation properties of the
subdivided population for stronger selection, we introduce an effective coarser
description of the dynamics in terms of a voter model with intermediate states,
which highlights the basic mechanisms driving the evolutionary process.

reciprocity through reputation fosters cooperation through the emergence of
moral and action rules. A simplified model has recently been proposed where
individuals choose between helping or not others, and are judged good or bad
for it by the rest of the population. The reputation so acquired will condition
future actions. In this model, eight strategies (referred to as 'leading
eight') enforce a high level of cooperation, generate high payoffs and are
therefore resistant to invasions by other strategies. Here we show that, by
assigning each individual one out of two labels that peers can distinguish
(e.g., political ideas, religion, skin colour...) and allowing moral and action
rules to depend on the label, intolerant behaviours can emerge within
minorities under sufficient economic stress. We analyse the sets of conditions
where this can happen and also discuss the circumstances under which tolerance
can be restored. Our results agree with empirical observations that correlate
intolerance and economic stress, and predict a correlation between the degree
of tolerance of a population and its composition and ethical stance.

of the nervous system in humans and animals. Prion diseases are invariably
fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases that affect a wide
variety of mammalian species such as sheep and goats, cattle, deer, elk and
humans etc. Recent studies have shown that rabbits have a low susceptibility to
be infected by prion diseases with respect to other animals including humans.
The present study employs molecular dynamics (MD) means to unravel the
mechanism of rabbit prion proteins (RaPrPC) based on the recently available
rabbit NMR structures (of the wild-type and its two mutants of two surface
residues). The electrostatic charge distributions on the protein surface are
the focus when analysing the MD trajectories. It is found that we can conclude
that surface electrostatic charge distributions indeed contribute to the
structural stability of wild-type RaPrPC; this may be useful for the medicinal
treatment of prion diseases.

  Networks</title><categories>physics.soc-ph cs.SI nlin.AO physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In the study of networks, it is often insightful to use algorithms to
determine mesoscale features such as &quot;community structure&quot;, in which densely
connected sets of nodes constitute &quot;communities&quot; that have sparse connections
to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities
algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When
optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or
time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph
ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes
that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the
null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally
on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel
null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under
study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take
incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the
radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial
benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on
distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static
and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard (&quot;Newman-Girvan&quot;) null
model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model.
In our comparisons, we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and
time-dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue
fever incidence data for Peru. We also evaluate a recently-proposed correlation
null model, which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are
constructed from time series, on the epidemic-correlation data.

  Synaptic Plasticity</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><comments>24 pages, 6 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Precise spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal action potentials underly e.g.
sensory representations and control of muscle activities. However, it is not
known how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt
such that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time.
Existing activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times. On the other hand,
the existing formal and supervised learning algorithms perform a temporally
precise comparison of projected activity with the target, but there is no known
biologically plausible implementation of this comparison. Here, we propose a
simple and local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism that is derived
from the requirement of a balanced membrane potential. Since the relevant
signal for synaptic change is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times,
we call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP).
Combining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a
sensitivity of synaptic change to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can
reproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as
was found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time
course of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish
between weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a
neuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For
spatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule
achieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations. The
sensitivity of the MPDP to the subthreshold membrane potential during training
allows robust memory retrieval after learning even in the presence of activity
corrupted by noise.

Morans I to analyze the spatial distribution of the 2010 dengue cases, and
developed multivariate logistic regression models through a multi-model
selection process to identify census variables and entomological covariates
associated with the presence of dengue at the neighborhood level. Using data
aggregated at the city-level, we conducted a time-series (wavelet) analysis of
weekly climate and dengue incidence (2003-2012) to identify significant time
periods (e.g., annual, biannual) when climate co-varied with dengue, and to
describe the climate conditions associated with the 2010 outbreak. We found
significant hotspots of dengue transmission near the center of Machala. The
best-fit model to predict the presence of dengue included older age and female
gender of the head of the household, greater access to piped water in the home,
poor housing condition, and less distance to the central hospital. Wavelet
analyses revealed that dengue transmission co-varied with rainfall and minimum
temperature at annual and biannual cycles, and we found that anomalously high
rainfall and temperatures were associated with the 2010 outbreak. Our findings
highlight the importance of geospatial information in dengue surveillance and
the potential to develop a climate-driven spatiotemporal prediction models to
inform disease prevention and control interventions.

eigenspectrum of the molecular dynamics propagator, yielding insight into the
long-timescale statistical kinetics and slow dynamical modes of biomolecular
systems. However, the lack of a unified theoretical framework for choosing
between alternative models has hampered progress, especially for non-experts
applying these methods to novel biological systems. Here, we consider
cross-validation with a new objective function for estimators of these slow
dynamical modes, a generalized matrix Rayleigh quotient (GMRQ), which measures
the ability of a rank-$m$ projection operator to capture the slow subspace of
the system. It is shown that a variational theorem bounds the GMRQ from above
by the sum of the first $m$ eigenvalues of the system's propagator, but that
this bound can be violated when the requisite matrix elements are estimated
subject to statistical uncertainty. This overfitting can be detected and
avoided through cross-validation. These result make it possible to construct
Markov state models for protein dynamics in a way that appropriately captures
the tradeoff between systematic and statistical errors.

characteristics of the geomagnetic compass believed to underlie the navigation
capability of certain avian species. In this study, the spin dynamics of the
radical pair model and decoherence therein are interpreted from a microscopic
state transition point of view. This helps to elucidate the interplay between
the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions that enables the avian compass, and the
distinctive effects of nuclear and environmental decoherence on it. Using a
quantum information theoretic quantifier of coherence, we find that nuclear
decoherence induces new structure in the spin dynamics without materially
affecting the compass action; environmental decoherence, on the other hand,
completely disrupts it.

The first

We analyze our architecture formally and computationally for the case of
reaching in a 3D environment. In the case of motor control, we show that there
are synergies of this architecture with the Equilibrium-Point hypothesis,
leading to novel ways to solve the motor error problem. In particular, the
presence of desired equilibrium lengths for muscles provides a way to know when
the error is increasing, and which corrections to apply. In the context of
Threshold Control Theory and Perceptual Control Theory we show how to extend
our model so it implements anticipative corrections in cascade control systems
that span from muscle contractions to cognitive operations.

causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Although H3N2 incidence is highly
seasonal, how such seasonality contributes to global phylogeographic migration
dynamics has not yet been established.
  Results: Incorporating seasonally varying migration rates improves the
modeling of migration. In our global model, windows of increased immigration
map to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased
emigration map to epidemic decline. Seasonal patterns also correlate with the
probability that local lineages go extinct and fail to contribute to long term
viral evolution, as measured through the trunk of the phylogeny. However, the
fraction of the trunk in each community was found to be better determined by
its overall human population size
  Conclusions: Seasonal migration and rapid turnover within regions is
sustained by the invasion of 'fertile epidemic grounds' at the end of older
epidemics. Thus, the current emphasis on connectivity, including air-travel,
should be complemented with a better understanding of the conditions and timing
required for successful establishment.Models which account for migration
seasonality will improve our understanding of the seasonal drivers of
influenza,enhance epidemiological predictions, and ameliorate vaccine updating
by identifying strains that not only escape immunity but also have the seasonal
opportunity to establish and spread. Further work is also needed on additional
conditions that contribute to the persistence and long term evolution of
influenza within the human population,such as spatial heterogeneity with
respect to climate and seasonality

cellular processes, including metabolism, signaling, and regulation of gene
expression. These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's
chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or
when genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the
importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we
investigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the
fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise
to evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding
strength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these
protein traits can emerge as evolutionary &quot;spandrels&quot; even if they do not
confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve
strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to
stabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins
may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending
on random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of
apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in
high-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding
and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of
biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra
folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is
developed. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of
fundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.

a general $d$-player $n$-strategy evolutionary game where the agents' payoffs
are normally distributed. First, we give a computationally implementable
formula for the general case. Next we characterize the asymptotic behavior of
$E(2,d)$, estimating its lower and upper bounds as $d$ increases. Two important
consequences are obtained from this analysis. On the one hand, we show that in
both cases the probability of seeing the maximal possible number of equilibria
tends to zero when $d$ or $n$ respectively goes to infinity. On the other hand,
we demonstrate that the expected number of stable equilibria is bounded within
a certain interval. Finally, for larger $n$ and $d$, numerical results are
provided and discussed.

Optimized Dissimilarity Space Embedding (ODSE) that operates in the input space
of sequences of generic objects. The ODSE system has been originally presented
as a classification system for patterns represented as labeled graphs. However,
since ODSE is founded on the dissimilarity space representation of the input
data, the classifier can be easily adapted to any input domain where it is
possible to define a meaningful dissimilarity measure. Here we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the ODSE classifier for sequences by considering an
application dealing with the recognition of the solubility degree of the
Escherichia coli proteome. Solubility, or analogously aggregation propensity,
is an important property of protein molecules, which is intimately related to
the mechanisms underlying the chemico-physical process of folding. Each protein
of our dataset is initially associated with a solubility degree and it is
represented as a sequence of symbols, denoting the 20 amino acid residues. The
herein obtained computational results, which we stress that have been achieved
with no context-dependent tuning of the ODSE system, confirm the validity and
generality of the ODSE-based approach for structured data classification.

  networks</title><categories>stat.AP q-bio.GN stat.CO</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  16S-ribosomal sequencing and other metagonomic techniques provide snapshots
of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial
populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community
structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions,
identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as
these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of
microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 16S datasets are
compositional, and thus, microbial abundances are not independent. Secondly,
microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of OTUs on only
tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of OTU-OTU interaction networks is
severely under-powered, and additional assumptions are required for accurate
inference. Here, we present SPIEC-EASI (SParse InversE Covariance Estimation
for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference
of microbial ecological interactions from metagenomic datasets that addresses
both of these issues. SPIEC-EASI combines data transformations developed for
compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that
assumes the underlying ecological interaction network is sparse. To reconstruct
the interaction network, SPIEC-EASI relies on algorithms for sparse
neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. Because no large-scale microbial
ecological networks have been experimentally validated, SPIEC-EASI comprises
computational tools to generate realistic OTU count data from a set of diverse
underlying network topologies. SPIEC-EASI outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of edge recovery and network properties on realistic synthetic data
under a variety of scenarios. SPIEC-EASI also reproducibly predicts previously
unknown microbial interactions using data from the American Gut project.

that the time distribution behaves like an inverse Gaussian with an exponential
decay. Varying the population size reveals that the timescale of the decay
depends on the population size and allows the critical population number, below
which fixation occurs, to be estimated from experimental data.

segregation of chromosomes and contributing to genetic diversity by generating
novel combinations of alleles. Using data derived from directUtoUconsumer
genetic testing, we investigated patterns of recombination in over 4,200
families. Our analysis revealed a number of sex differences in the distribution
of recombination. We find the fraction of male events occurring within hotspots
to be 4.6% higher than for females. We confirm that the recombination rate
increases with maternal age, while hotspot usage decreases, with no such
effects observed in males. Finally, we show that the placement of female
recombination events becomes increasingly deregulated with maternal age, with
an increasing fraction of events appearing to escape crossover interference.

spread of airborne infections (e.g., influenza) because of the high mixing
rates of school children. The closure of schools has therefore been proposed as
efficient mitigation strategy, with however high social and economic costs:
alternative, less disruptive interventions are highly desirable. The recent
availability of high-resolution contact networks in school environments
provides an opportunity to design micro-interventions and compare the outcomes
of alternative mitigation measures. We consider mitigation measures that
involve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily
available information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in
a class. We focus on the case of a primary school for which we have
high-resolution data on the close-range interactions of children and teachers.
We simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population by using
an SEIR model with asymptomatics and compare the outcomes of different
mitigation strategies. We find that targeted class closure affords strong
mitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time -equal to the
sum of the average infectious and latent durations- whenever two infectious
individuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70%
and strongly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all
classes of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the
whole school. Targeted class closure strategies based on readily available
information on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing
patterns, such as the grade structure of the school, can be almost as effective
as whole-school closure, at a much lower cost. This may inform public health
policies for the management and mitigation of influenza-like outbreaks in the
community.

  under environmental disturbances</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Inspired by real scenarios in Northern Patagonia, we analyze a mathematical
model of a simple trophic web with two herbivores and one predator. The studied
situations represent a common practice in the steppes of Argentine Patagonia,
where livestock are raised in a semi-wild state, either on the open range or
enclosed, coexisting with competitors and predators. In the present work, the
competing herbivores represent sheep and guanacos, while the predator is
associated with the puma. The proposed model combines the concepts of
metapopulations and patches dynamics, and includes an explicit hierarchical
competition between species, which affects their prospect to colonize an empty
patch when having to compete with other species. We perform numerical
simulations of spatially extended metapopulations assemblages of the system,
which allow us to incorporate the effects of habitat heterogeneity and
destruction. The numerical results are compared with those obtained from mean
field calculations. We find that the model provides a good theoretical
framework in several situations, including the control of the wild populations
that the ranchers exert to different extent. Furthermore, the present
formulation incorporates new terms in previously analyzed models, that help to
reveal the important effects due to the heterogeneous nature of the system.

permeates diverse languages and cultures. This paper outlines a system for
using basic principles from optics to visually represent psychological states
and processes such as ideation, enlightenment, mindfulness, and fragmentation
versus integrity, as well as situations that occur between people involving
phenomena such as honest versus deceptive communication, and understanding
versus misunderstanding. The paper summarizes two ongoing projects based on
this system: The Light and Enlightenment art installation project, and the
Soultracker virtual reality project. These projects enable people to depict
their inner lives and external worlds including situations and relationships
with others, both as they are and as they could be, and explore alternative
paths for navigating challenges and living to their fullest potential. The
projects aim to be of clinical value as therapeutic tools, as well as of
pedagogical value by providing a concrete language for depicting aspects of
human nature that can otherwise seem elusive and intangible.

  supplementary table</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Alterations in brain connectivity have been associated with a variety of
clinical disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
investigated empirically how the number of brain parcels (or scale) impacted
the results of a mass univariate general linear model (GLM) on connectomes. The
brain parcels used as nodes in the connectome analysis were functionnally
defined by a group cluster analysis. We first validated that a classic
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with parametric GLM tests did control
appropriately the false-discovery rate (FDR) at a given scale. We then observed
on realistic simulations that there was no substantial inflation of the FDR
across scales, as long as the FDR was controlled independently within each
scale, and the presence of true associations could be established using an
omnibus permutation test combining all scales. Second, we observed both on
simulations and on three real resting-state fMRI datasets (schizophrenia,
congenital blindness, motor practice) that the rate of discovery varied
markedly as a function of scales, and was relatively higher for low scales,
below 25. Despite the differences in discovery rate, the statistical maps
derived at different scales were generally very consistent in the three real
datasets. Some seeds still showed effects better observed around 50,
illustrating the potential benefits of multiscale analysis. On real data, the
statistical maps agreed well with the existing literature. Overall, our results
support that the multiscale GLM connectome analysis with FDR is statistically
valid and can capture biologically meaningful effects in a variety of
experimental conditions.

evolved in order to infer an accurate phylogenetic tree. For molecular data,
standard statistical methods have provided an effective strategy for extracting
phylogenetic information from aligned sequence data when each site (character)
is subject to a common process. However, for other types of data (e.g.
morphological data), characters can be too ambiguous, homoplastic or saturated
to develop models that are effective at capturing the underlying process of
change. To address this, we examine the properties of a classic but neglected
method for inferring splits in an underlying tree, namely, maximum
compatibility. By adopting a simple and extreme model in which each character
either fits perfectly on some tree, or is entirely random (but it is not known
which class any character belongs to) we are able to derive exact and explicit
formulae regarding the performance of maximum compatibility. We show that this
method is able to identify a set of non-trivial homoplasy-free characters, when
the number $n$ of taxa is large, even when the number of random characters is
large. By contrast, we show that a method that makes more uniform use of all
the data --- maximum parsimony --- can provably estimate trees in which {\em
none} of the original homoplasy-free characters support splits.

notion of &quot;blindness&quot; that does not distinguish BVSR from other theories of
creativity, and an assumption that creativity can be understood by treating
ideas as discrete, countable entities, as opposed to different external
manifestations of a singular gradually solidifying internal conception.
Uprooted from Darwinian theory, BVSR lacks a scientific framework that can be
called upon to generate hypotheses and test them. In lieu of such a framework,
hypotheses appear to be generated on the basis of previous data--they are not
theory-driven. The paper does not explain how the hypothesis that creativity is
enhanced by engagement in a &quot;network of enterprises&quot; is derived from BVSR; this
hypothesis is more compatible with competing conceptions of creativity. The
notion that creativity involves backtracking conflates evidence for
backtracking with respect to the external output with evidence for backtracking
of the conception of the invention. The first does not imply the second; a
creator can set aside a creative output but cannot go back to the conception of
the task he/she had prior to generating that output. The notion that creativity
entails superfluity (i.e., many ideas have &quot;zero usefulness&quot;) is misguided;
usefulness is context-dependent, moreover, the usefulness of an idea may reside
in its being a critical stepping-stone to a subsequent idea.

ends of the tube are dissimilar and are designated as `plus' and `minus' ends.
Motivated by the collective push and pull exerted by a bundle of MTs during
chromosome segregation in a living cell, we have developed here a much
simplified theoretical model of a bundle of parallel dynamic MTs. The plus-end
of all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable `wall' by a
device whose detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The
only requirement is that the device allows polymerization and depolymerization
of each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence of external force and
direct lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs
attached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing
MTs and vice-versa; the load against a group is shared equally by the members
of that group. Such indirect interactions among the MTs gives rise to the rich
variety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have identified by
computer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes. The
bi-directional motion of the cargo, caused by the load-dependence of the
polymerization kinetics, is a &quot;proof-of-principle&quot; that the bi-directional
motion of chromosomes before cell division does not necessarily need active
participation of motor proteins.

organismal complexity and adaptive properties, determining at once genomic
plasticity and those constraints that may limit the ability of genomes to
attain evolutionary innovations. An exhaustive experimental characterization of
the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes is at present out of reach.
Therefore, several models mimicking that map have been proposed and
investigated, leading to the identification of a number of general features:
genotypes differ in their robustness to mutations, phenotypes are represented
by a broadly varying number of genotypes, and simple point mutations seem to
suffice to navigate the space of genotypes while maintaining a phenotype.
However, most current models address only one level of the map (sequences and
folded structures in RNA or proteins; networks of genes and their dynamical
attractors; sets of chemical reactions and their ability to undergo molecular
catalysis), such that many relevant questions cannot be addressed. Here we
introduce toyLIFE, a multi-level model for the genotype-phenotype map based on
simple genomes and interaction rules from which a complex behavior at upper
levels emerges, remarkably plastic gene regulatory networks and metabolism.
toyLIFE is a tool that permits the investigation of how different levels are
coupled, in particular how and where do mutations affect phenotype or how the
presence of certain metabolites determines the dynamics of toyLIFE gene
regulatory networks. The possibilities of this model are not exhausted by the
results presented in this contribution. It can be easily generalized to
incorporate evolution through mutations that change genome length or through
recombination, to consider gene duplication or deletion, and therefore to
explore further properties of extended genotype-phenotype maps.

sequences, can produce incorrect results when used on more divergent but
functionally related sequences that have undergone the sequence rearrangements
observed in many bacterial and viral genomes. Here, we propose a classification
model that exploits the complementary nature of alignment-based and
alignment-free similarity measures with the aim to improve the accuracy with
which DNA and protein sequences are characterized. Our model classifies
sequences using a combined sequence similarity score calculated by adaptively
weighting the contribution of different sequence similarity measures. Weights
are determined independently for each sequence in the test set and reflect the
discriminatory ability of individual similarity measures in the training set.
Since the similarity between some sequences is determined more accurately with
one type of measure rather than another, our classifier allows different sets
of weights to be associated with different sequences. Using five different
similarity measures we show that our model significantly improves the
classification accuracy over the current composition and alignment based
models, when predicting the taxonomic lineage for both short viral sequence
fragments and complete viral sequences. We also show that our model can be used
effectively for the classification of reads from a real metagenome dataset as
well as protein sequences.

behavioural responses when they are confronted to threats. However a school's
response to perturbations may be different depending on its collective state.
Here we use a previously developed data-driven fish school model to investigate
how a single or a small number of perturbing individuals affect the long-term
behaviour of a school depending on its collective state. These perturbing fish
are characterised by a set of attraction and alignment parameters different
from those of the main population. We find that the responsiveness of the
school to the perturbation is maximum near the transition region between
milling and schooling states where the school exhibits multistability and
regularly shifts between these two states. We also find that a significant
school's response to a perturbation only happens below a certain threshold of
the noise to social interactions ratio.

self-assemble into amyloid fibrils which entangle to form percolating networks
called hydrogels. Such hydrogels have important applications as biomaterials
and in nanotechnology, but their applicability often depends on their
mechanical properties for which we currently have no predictive capability.
Here we use a peptide model to simulate the formation of amyloid fibril
networks, and couple these to elastic network theory to determine their
mechanical properties. The simulations reveal that the time-dependence of
morphological quantities characterizing the network length scales can be
collapsed onto master curves by using a time scaling function that depends on
the interaction parameter between the peptides. The same scaling function is
used to unveil a universal, non-monotonic dependence of the shear modulus with
time. The obtained insight into the structure-function relationship between the
peptide building blocks, network morphology and network mechanical properties
can aid experimentalists to design amyloid fibril networks with tailored
mechanical properties.

the importance of specific edges in a network, hitherto not captured by
existing network metrics. The effects of removing edges with high ${\cal P}_e$
might initially seem inconspicuous but are eventually shown to be very harmful
for networks. Compared to existing strategies, the removal of edges by ${\cal
P}_e$ leads to a remarkable increase in the diameter and average shortest path
length in undirected real and random networks till the first disconnection and
well beyond. ${\cal P}_e$ can be consistently used to rupture the network into
two nearly equal parts, thus presenting a very potent strategy to greatly harm
a network. Targeting by ${\cal P}_e$ causes notable efficiency loss in U.S. and
European power grid networks. ${\cal P}_e$ identifies proteins with essential
cellular functions in protein-protein interaction networks. It pinpoints
regulatory neural connections and important portions of the neural and brain
networks, respectively. Energy flow interactions identified by ${\cal P}_e$
form the backbone of long food web chains. Finally, we scrutinize the potential
of ${\cal P}_e$ in edge controllability dynamics of directed networks.

\pm 0.02$ cm$^2$ day$^{-1}$ was fitted. A third experiment used a
diffusion-cell setup with a $5.5$ cm central sand layer separating a DNAPL from
an aqueous top layer as a model source zone to examine the effect of random
motility on TCE DNAPL dissolution. With top layer inoculation, Geobacter
quickly colonized the sand layer, thereby enhancing the initial TCE DNAPL
dissolution flux. After $19$ days, the DNAPL dissolution enhancement was only
$24\%$ lower than with an homogenous inoculation of the sand layer. A
diffusion-motility model was developed to describe dechlorination and migration
in the diffusion-cells. This model suggested that the fast colonization of the
sand layer by Geobacter was due to the combination of random motility and
growth on TCE.

falling supply, rarity value, or both. There is concern that high price
flexibility can cause extinction by buffering harvest profits against abundance
declines. However, harvest costs also tend to increase as a population
declines. Here, I derive a simple rule of thumb for determining whether prices
might rise faster than costs as a population is depleted - indicating
susceptibility to severe overharvesting under open-access. Comparing this rule
of thumb to a review of empirical evidence from marine species, I find that
conditions leading costs to be insensitive to abundance declines - particularly
catch rates insensitive to abundance declines, termed 'hyperstable', usually as
a result of range contraction - are much more common than high price
flexibility, even in highly valued species such as bluefin tunas, sturgeons,
whales and abalones. My analysis suggests that factors potentially causing
coincident range contraction as a population declines - including herding or
schooling behavior and habitat destruction - may be important but
underappreciated factors contributing to price-related extinction threats.

in terms of two interacting traces, corresponding to the fraction of activated
NMDA receptors and the Ca2+ concentration in the dendritic spine of the
postsynaptic neuron. This model intends to bridge the worlds of existing
simplistic phenomenological rules and highly detailed models, constituting thus
a practical tool for the study of the interplay between neural activity and
synaptic plasticity in extended spiking neural networks. For isolated pairs of
pre- and postsynaptic spikes the standard pairwise STDP rule is reproduced,
with appropriate parameters determining the respective weights and time scales
for the causal and the anti-causal contributions. The model contains otherwise
only three free parameters which can be adjusted to reproduce triplet
nonlinearities in both hippocampal culture and cortical slices. We also
investigate the transition from time-dependent to rate-dependent plasticity
occurring for both correlated and uncorrelated spike patterns.

reveal the presence of long-range correlations and, at the same time, to
characterize the self-similarity of the series. The rich information derivable
from the characteristic exponents and the multifractal spectrum can be further
analyzed to discover important insights about the underlying dynamical process.
In this paper, we employ multifractal analysis techniques in the study of
protein contact networks. To this end, initially a network is mapped to three
different time series, each of which is generated by a stationary unbiased
random walk. To capture the peculiarities of the networks at different levels,
we accordingly consider three observables at each vertex: the degree, the
clustering coefficient, and the closeness centrality. To compare the results
with suitable references, we consider also instances of three well-known
network models and two typical time series with pure monofractal and
multifractal properties. The first result of notable interest is that time
series associated to proteins contact networks exhibit long-range correlations
(strong persistence), which are consistent with signals in-between the typical
monofractal and multifractal behavior. Successively, a suitable embedding of
the multifractal spectra allows to focus on ensemble properties, which in turn
gives us the possibility to make further observations regarding the considered
networks. In particular, we highlight the different role that small and large
fluctuations of the considered observables play in the characterization of the
network topology.

Yet,
theoretical studies of neural population coding typically focus on the encoding
of single objects in isolation. Experimental studies suggest that neural
responses to multiple objects are well described by linear or nonlinear
combinations of the responses to constituent objects, a phenomenon we call
stimulus mixing. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the consequences of
common forms of stimulus mixing observed in cortical responses. We show that
some of these mixing rules can severely compromise the brain's ability to
decode the individual objects. This cost is usually greater than the cost
incurred by even large reductions in the gain or large increases in neural
variability, explaining why the benefits of attention can be understood
primarily in terms of a stimulus selection, or demixing, mechanism rather than
purely as a gain increase or noise reduction mechanism. The cost of stimulus
mixing becomes even higher when the number of encoded objects increases,
suggesting a novel mechanism that might contribute to set size effects observed
in myriad psychophysical tasks. We further show that a specific form of neural
correlation and heterogeneity in stimulus mixing among the neurons can
partially alleviate the harmful effects of stimulus mixing. Finally, we derive
simple conditions that must be satisfied for unharmful mixing of stimuli.

spatiotemporal patterns in continuum neural fields. Our main focus is how
fluctuations impact patterns when they are weakly coupled to an external
stimulus or another equivalent pattern. Showing the generality of our approach,
we study both propagating fronts and stationary bumps. Using a separation of
time scales, we represent the effects of noise in terms of a phase-shift of a
pattern from its uniformly translating position at long time scales, and
fluctuations in the pattern profile around its instantaneous position at short
time scales. In the case of a stimulus-locked front, we show that the
phase-shift satisfies a nonlinear Langevin equation (SDE) whose deterministic
part has a unique stable fixed point. Using a linear-noise approximation, we
thus establish that wandering of the front about the stimulus-locked state is
given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Analogous results hold for the
relative phase-shift between a pair of mutually coupled fronts, provided that
the coupling is excitatory. On the other hand, if the mutual coupling is given
by a Mexican hat function (difference of exponentials), then the linear-noise
approximation breaks down due to the co-existence of stable and unstable
phase-locked states in the deterministic limit. Similarly, the stochastic
motion of mutually coupled bumps can be described by a system of nonlinearly
coupled SDEs, which can be linearized to yield a multivariate OU process. As in
the case of fronts, large deviations can cause bumps to temporarily decouple,
leading to a phase-slip in the bump positions.

arrhythmia, but these perturbations are not captured by conventional
electrocardiographic metrics. We developed a theoretical framework to quantify
electrical communication using information theory metrics in 2-dimensional cell
lattice models of cardiac excitation propagation. The time series generated by
each cell was coarse-grained to 1 when excited or 0 when resting. The Shannon
entropy for each cell was calculated from the time series during four
clinically important heart rhythms: normal heartbeat, anatomical reentry,
spiral reentry, and multiple reentry. We also used mutual information to
perform spatial profiling of communication during these cardiac arrhythmias. We
found that information sharing between cells was spatially heterogeneous. In
addition, cardiac arrhythmia significantly impacted information sharing within
the heart. Entropy localized the path of the drifting core of spiral reentry,
which could be an optimal target of therapeutic ablation. We conclude that
information theory metrics can quantitatively assess electrical communication
among cardiomyocytes. The traditional concept of the heart as a functional
syncytium sharing electrical information cannot predict altered entropy and
information sharing during complex arrhythmia. Information theory metrics may
find clinical application in the identification of rhythm-specific treatments
which are currently unmet by traditional electrocardiographic techniques.

and their interactions enabling an extensive, compartmentalized protein-protein
interaction network analysis (http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu). ComPPI enables the
user to filter biologically unlikely interactions, where the two interacting
proteins have no common subcellular localizations and to predict novel
properties, such as compartment-specific biological functions. ComPPI is an
integrated database covering four species (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D.
melanogaster and H. sapiens). The compilation of nine protein-protein
interaction and eight subcellular localization data sets had four curation
steps including a manually built, comprehensive hierarchical structure of more
than 1600 subcellular localizations. ComPPI provides confidence scores for
protein subcellular localizations and protein-protein interactions. ComPPI has
user-friendly search options for individual proteins giving their subcellular
localization, their interactions and the likelihood of their interactions
considering the subcellular localization of their interacting partners.
Download options of search results, whole proteomes, organelle-specific
interactomes and subcellular localization data are available on its website.
Due to its novel features, ComPPI is useful for the analysis of experimental
results in biochemistry and molecular biology, as well as for proteome-wide
studies in bioinformatics and network science helping cellular biology,
medicine and drug design.

of non-epistatic landscapes, and so it stands to reason that there exist
dynamical phenomena that can only be realized in the presence of epistasis.
Here, we compare evolutionary dynamics on all finite epistatic landscapes
versus all finite non-epistatic landscapes, under weak mutation. We first
analyze the mean fitness trajectory - that is, the time course of the expected
fitness of a population. We show that for any epistatic fitness landscape and
starting genotype, there always exists a non-epistatic fitness landscape and
starting genotype that produces the exact same mean fitness trajectory. Thus,
surprisingly, the space of mean fitness trajectories that can be realized by
epistatic landscapes is no more diverse than the space of mean fitness
trajectories that can be realized by non-epistatic landscapes. On the other
hand, we show that epistatic fitness landscapes can produce dynamics in the
time-evolution of the variance in fitness across replicate populations and in
the time-evolution of the expected number of substitutions that cannot be
produced by any non-epistatic landscape. These results on identifiability have
implications for efforts to infer epistasis from the types of data often
measured in experimental populations.

systems are investigated. A model is proposed to describe a large class of
systems within population genetics. We focus on a single locus, arbitrary
number alleles in a two-gender dioecious population. Our governing equations
are time-dependent continuous differential equations labeled by a set of
genotype frequencies. The full parameter space consists of all allowed genotype
frequencies. Our equations are uniquely derived from four fundamental
assumptions within any population: (1) a closed system; (2) average-and-random
mating process (mean-field behavior); (3) Mendelian inheritance; (4)
exponential growth and exponential death. Even though our equations are
non-linear with time evolutionary dynamics, we have an exactly solvable model.
Our findings are summarized from phenomenological and mathematical viewpoints.
From the phenomenological viewpoint, any initial genotype frequency of a closed
system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under time evolution, we
show (1) the monotonic behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) any genotype or
allele that appears in the population will never become extinct, (3) the
Hardy-Weinberg law, and (4) the global stability without chaos in the parameter
space. To demonstrate the experimental evidence, as an example, we show a
mapping from the blood type genotype frequencies of world ethnic groups to our
stable fixed-point solutions. From the mathematical viewpoint, the equilibrium
solutions consist of a base manifold as a global stable attractor, attracting
any initial point in a Euclidean fiber bundle to the fixed point where the
fiber is attached. We can define the genetic distance of two populations as
their geodesic distance on the equilibrium manifold. In addition, the
modification of our theory under the process of natural selection and mutation
is addressed.

Markov process associated to finite networks are investigated. We derive the
limit in distribution of the sample path of the state of a neuron of the
network when its size gets large. The invariant distributions of this limiting
stochastic process are analyzed as well as their stability properties. We show
that the system undergoes transitions as a function of the averaged
connectivity parameter, and can support trivial states (where the network
activity dies out, which is also the unique stationary state of finite networks
in some cases) and self-sustained activity when connectivity level is
sufficiently large, both being possibly stable.

association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the
steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies
has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of
key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently
contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants,
none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.
  To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for
PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces
extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic
improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4
orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit
in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data
format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and
multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the
new types of information.
  The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in
performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to
high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the
feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.

inference problems remains an open question in computational neuroscience.
Recently, abstract models of Bayesian computation in neural circuits have been
proposed, but they lack a mechanistic interpretation at the single-cell level.
In this article, we describe a complete theoretical framework for building
networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that can sample from arbitrary
probability distributions over binary random variables. We test our framework
for a model inference task based on a psychophysical phenomenon (the
Knill-Kersten optical illusion) and further assess its performance when applied
to randomly generated distributions. As the local computations performed by the
network strongly depend on the interaction between neurons, we compare several
types of couplings mediated by either single synapses or interneuron chains.
Due to its robustness to substrate imperfections such as parameter noise and
background noise correlations, our model is particularly interesting for
implementation on novel, neuro-inspired computing architectures, which can
thereby serve as a fast, low-power substrate for solving real-world inference
problems.

(30 January 2015) 43 (2): 1160-1169</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In post-transcriptional regulation, an mRNA molecule is bound by many
proteins and/or miRNAs to modulate its function. To enable combinatorial gene
regulation, these binding partners of an RNA must communicate with each other,
exhibiting cooperativity. Even in the absence of direct physical interactions
between the binding partners, such cooperativity can be mediated through RNA
secondary structures, since they affect the accessibility of the binding sites.
Here we propose a quantitative measure of this structure-mediated cooperativity
that can be numerically calculated for an arbitrary RNA sequence. Focusing on
an RNA with two binding sites, we derive a characteristic difference of free
energy differences, i.e. \Delta\Delta G, as a measure of the effect of the
occupancy of one binding site on the binding strength of another. We apply this
measure to a large number of human and C. elegans mRNAs, and find that
structure-mediated cooperativity is a generic feature. Interestingly, this
cooperativity not only affects binding sites in close proximity along the
sequence but also configurations in which one binding site is located in the
5'UTR and the other is located in the 3'UTR of the mRNA. Furthermore, we find
that this end-to-end cooperativity is determined by the UTR sequences while the
sequences of the coding regions are irrelevant.

membrane potentials of finite system of neurons in the absence of external
stimuli. The values of the membrane potentials evolve under the effect of {\it
chemical synapses}, {\it electrical synapses} and a \textit{leak current}. The
evolution of the process can be informally described as follows. Each neuron
spikes randomly following a point process with rate depending on its membrane
potential. When a neuron spikes, its membrane potential is immediately reset to
a resting value. Simultaneously, the membrane potential of the neurons which
are influenced by it receive an additional positive value. Furthermore, between
consecutive spikes, the system follows a deterministic motion due both to
electrical synapses and the leak current. Electrical synapses push the system
towards its average potential, while the leak current attracts the membrane
potential of each neuron to the resting value.
  We show that in the absence leakage the process converges exponentially fast
to an unique invariant measure, whenever the initial configuration is non null.
More interesting, when leakage is present, we proved the system stops spiking
after a finite amount of time almost surely. This implies that the unique
invariant measure is supported only by the null configuration.

It has a single
eyespot near its equator and as the cell rotates during forward motion the
light signal received by the eyespot varies. We use a simple mechanical model
of Chlamydomonas that couples the flagellar beat pattern to the light intensity
at the eyespot to demonstrate a mechanism for phototactic steering that is
consistent with observations. The direction of phototaxis is controlled by a
parameter in our model and the steering mechanism is robust to noise. Our model
shows switching between directed phototaxis when the light is on and
run-and-tumble behaviour in the dark.

have reinvigorated the idea that large neural networks operate near a critical
point, between order and disorder. However, evidence for criticality has relied
on the definition of arbitrary order parameters, or on models that do not
address the dynamical nature of network activity. Here we introduce a novel
approach to assess criticality that overcomes these limitations, while
encompassing and generalizing previous criteria. We find a simple model to
describe the global activity of large populations of ganglion cells in the rat
retina, and show that their statistics are poised near a critical point. Taking
into account the temporal dynamics of the activity greatly enhances the
evidence for criticality, revealing it where previous methods would not. The
approach is general and could be used in other biological networks.

variance of populations as a power-law. TL is widely observed in ecological
systems across space and time with exponents varying largely between 1 and 2.
Many ecological explanations have been proposed for TL but it is also commonly
observed outside ecology. We propose that TL arises from the constraining
influence of two primary variables: the number of individuals and the number of
censuses or sites. We show that most possible configurations of individuals
among censuses or sites produce the power-law form of TL with exponents between
1 and 2. This feasible set approach suggests that TL is a statistical pattern
driven by two constraints, providing an a priori explanation for this
ubiquitous pattern. However, the exact form of any specific mean-variance
relationship cannot be predicted in this way, i.e., this approach does a poor
job of predicting variation in the exponent, suggesting that TL may still
contain ecological information.

simulation-based statistical testing-like methods. In this paper, we
demonstrate that we can replace this approach by a formal verification-like
method that gives higher assurance and scalability. We focus on Wagner weighted
GRN model with varying weights, which is used in evolutionary biology. In the
model, weight parameters represent the gene interaction strength that may
change due to genetic mutations. For a property of interest, we synthesise the
constraints over the parameter space that represent the set of GRNs satisfying
the property. We experimentally show that our parameter synthesis procedure
computes the mutational robustness of GRNs -an important problem of interest in
evolutionary biology- more efficiently than the classical simulation method. We
specify the property in linear temporal logics. We employ symbolic bounded
model checking and SMT solving to compute the space of GRNs that satisfy the
property, which amounts to synthesizing a set of linear constraints on the
weights.

given structure. For sufficiently large well-mixed populations, the process of
extinction of one or more state variable components occurs in the tail of the
quasi-stationary probability distribution, thereby making it a rare event. Here
we show how to extend the theory of large deviations to random networks to
predict extinction times. In particular, we use the theory to find the most
probable path leading to extinction. We apply the methodology to epidemic
models and discover how mean extinction times scale with epidemiological and
network parameters in Erdos-Renyi networks. The results are shown to compare
quite well with Monte Carlo simulations of the network in predicting both the
most probable paths to extinction and mean extinction times.

  I propose a new algorithm for a DNA assembly which uses the relative

mathematical model shows the upper limits of accuracy of the results as a
function of read coverage. For high coverage, the estimation error depends
linearly on repetitive sequence length and inversely proportional to the
sequencing coverage. The algorithm requires high read depth, provided by the
next-generation sequencers and could use the existing data. The tests on
errorless reads, generated in silico from several model genomes, pointed the
properly reconstructed repetitive sequences, where existing assemblers fail.

  Escherichia coli ST131 using evolutionary and epidemiological genomics</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>18 pages, 1 figure</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  High-throughput molecular screening is required to investigate the origin and
diffusion of antimicrobial resistance in pathogen outbreaks. The most frequent
cause of human infection is Escherichia coli, which is dominated by sequence
type 131 (ST131), a set of rapidly radiating pandemic clones. The highly
infectious clades of ST131 originated firstly by a mutation enhancing virulence
and adhesion. Secondly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred enabling
fluoroquinolone-resistance, which is near-fixed in all ST131. Thirdly, broader
resistance through beta-lactamases has been gained and lost frequently,
symptomatic of conflicting environmental selective effects. This flexible
approach to gene exchange is worrying and supports the proposition that ST131
will develop an even wider range of plasmid and chromosomal elements promoting
antimicrobial resistance. To stymie ST131, deep genome sequencing is required
to understand the origin, evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance
genes. Phylogenetic methods that decipher past events can predict future
patterns of virulence and transmission based on genetic signatures of
adaptation and gene exchange. Both the effect of partial antimicrobial exposure
and cell dormancy caused by variation in gene expression may accelerate the
development of resistance. High-throughput sequencing can decode measurable
evolution of cell populations within patients associated with systems-wide
changes in gene expression during treatments. A multi-faceted approach can
enhance assessment of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli ST131 by examining
transmission dynamics between hosts to achieve a goal of pre-empting resistance
before it emerges by optimising antimicrobial treatment protocols.

When oscillations arise from a deterministic limit cycle, entrainment and
synchronization may be analyzed in terms of the asymptotic phase function. In
the presence of noise, the asymptotic phase is no longer well defined. We
introduce a new definition of asymptotic phase in terms of the slowest decaying
modes of the Kolmogorov backward operator. Our stochastic asymptotic phase is
well defined for noisy oscillators, even when the oscillations are noise
dependent. It reduces to the classical asymptotic phase in the limit of
vanishing noise. The phase can be obtained either by solving an eigenvalue
problem, or by empirical observation of an oscillating density's approach to
its steady state.

challenge. Empirical evidence suggests that, left unchecked, crimes may be
recurrent and proliferate. On the other hand, eradicating a culture of crime
may be difficult, especially under extreme social circumstances that impair the
creation of a shared sense of social responsibility. Although our understanding
of the mechanisms that drive the emergence and diffusion of crime is still
incomplete, recent research highlights applied mathematics and methods of
statistical physics as valuable theoretical resources that may help us better
understand criminal activity. We review different approaches aimed at modeling
and improving our understanding of crime, focusing on the nucleation of crime
hotspots using partial differential equations, self-exciting point process and
agent-based modeling, adversarial evolutionary games, and the network science
behind the formation of gangs and large-scale organized crime. We emphasize
that statistical physics of crime can relevantly inform the design of
successful crime prevention strategies, as well as improve the accuracy of
expectations about how different policing interventions should impact malicious
human activity deviating from social norms. We also outline possible directions
for future research, related to the effects of social and coevolving networks
and to the hierarchical growth of criminal structures due to self-organization.

rather than naturally occurring bio-chemical systems of a selection of basic
bio-inspired information processing steps. These include feed-forward loops,
which have been identified as the most common information processing motifs in
many natural pathways in cellular functioning, and memory-involving processes,
specifically, associative memory. Such systems should not be designed to
literally mimic nature. Rather, we can be guided by nature's mechanisms for
experimenting with new information/signal processing steps which are based on
coupled biochemical reactions, but are vastly simpler than natural processes,
and which will provide tools for the long-term goal of understanding and
harnessing nature's information processing paradigm. Our biochemical processes
of choice are enzymatic cascades because of their compatibility with
physiological processes in vivo and with electronics (e.g., electrodes) in
vitro allowing for networking and interfacing of enzyme-catalyzed processes
with other chemical and biochemical reactions. In addition to designing and
realizing feed-forward loops and other processes, one has to develop approaches
to probe their response to external control of the time-dependence of the
input(s), by measuring the resulting time-dependence of the output. The goal
will be to demonstrate the expected features, for example, the delayed response
and stabilizing effect of the feed-forward loops.

displacement reaction with a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA.
Strand displacement, during which a single strand displaces a different strand
previously bound to a complementary substrate strand, is an essential mechanism
in active nucleic acid nanotechnology and has also been hypothesized to occur
in vivo. We study the rate of displacement reactions as a function of the
length of the toehold and temperature and make two experimentally testable
predictions: that the displacement is faster if the toehold is placed at the 5'
end of the substrate and that the displacement slows down with increasing
temperature for longer toeholds.

general mechanism by which ecosystems are able to maintain high levels of
biodiversity. However, species coexistence is often possible only in spatially
extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed
environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of
biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid
environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and
diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model
composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions
among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the
circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external
environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic
interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the
children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from
a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with
hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes
bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to
biological interactions are varied.

  error fixes</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a population of noisy
cell-autonomous oscillators synchronizes to generate robust circadian rhythms
at the organism-level. Within these cells two isoforms of Cryptochrome, Cry1
and Cry2, participate in a negative feedback loop driving circadian
rhythmicity. Previous work has shown that single, dissociated SCN neurons
respond differently to Cry1 and Cry2 knockouts: Cry1 knockouts are arrhythmic
while Cry2 knockouts display more regular rhythms. These differences have led
to speculation that CRY1 and CRY2 may play different functional roles in the
oscillator. To address this proposition, we have developed a new coupled,
stochastic model focused on the Period (Per) and Cry feedback loop, and
incorporating intercellular coupling via vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).
Due to the stochastic nature of molecular oscillations, we demonstrate that
single-cell Cry1 knockout oscillations display partially rhythmic behavior, and
cannot be classified as simply rhythmic or arrhythmic. Our model demonstrates
that intrinsic molecular noise and differences in relative abundance, rather
than differing functions, are sufficient to explain the range of rhythmicity
encountered in Cry knockouts in the SCN. Our results further highlight the
essential role of stochastic behavior in understanding and accurately modeling
the circadian network and its response to perturbation.

exhibits discontinuity as a function of their frequency: the most frequent
verbs tend to be totally irregular. We aim to qualitatively understand the
origin of this feature by studying simple agent--based models of language
dynamics, where each agent adopts an inflectional state for a verb and may
change it upon interaction with other agents. At the same time, agents are
replaced at some rate by new agents adopting the regular form. In models with
only two inflectional states (regular and irregular), we observe that either
all verbs regularize irrespective of their frequency, or a continuous
transition occurs between a low frequency state where the lemma becomes fully
regular, and a high frequency one where both forms coexist. Introducing a third
(mixed) state, wherein agents may use either form, we find that a third,
qualitatively different behavior may emerge, namely, a discontinuous transition
in frequency. We introduce and solve analytically a very general class of
three--state models that allows us to fully understand these behaviors in a
unified framework. Realistic sets of interaction rules, including the
well-known Naming Game (NG) model, result in a discontinuous transition, in
agreement with recent empirical findings. We also point out that the
distinction between speaker and hearer in the interaction has no effect on the
collective behavior. The results for the general three--state model, although
discussed in terms of language dynamics, are widely applicable.

have independent effects with regard to certain phenotypes. Understanding the
global epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.
Current knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited
by the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic
relations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis
to simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations.
Specifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the
mutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis
tends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting
conditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing
deleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of
epistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic
interactions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable
epistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas
genes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore,
genes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas
this co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific
epistasis. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide picture about epistatic
dynamics under environmental perturbations.

neo-Darwinian view of genes as 'leaders' and phenotypes as 'followers' during
the process of adaptive evolution should be turned on its head. This idea is
older than the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance and has been given
several names before its final 'Baldwin effect' label. A condition for this
effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic plasticity
or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a population. This
gives the necessary time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and
the adaptive trait can be eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential
paper published in the late 1980s showed the Baldwin effect to happen in
computer simulations, and claimed that it was crucial to solve a difficult
adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various
disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary
emergence of high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language
almost hopeless. Here, we use analytical and computational approaches to show
that a standard population genetics treatment can easily crack what the
scientific community has granted as an unsolvable adaptive problem without
learning. The Baldwin effect is once again in need of convincing theoretical
foundations.

polymorphism to detect signatures of positive selection. There are two main
types of methods: (i) 'outlier' detection methods based on Fst that detect loci
with high differentiation compared to the rest of the genomes, and (ii)
environmental association methods that test the association between allele
frequencies and environmental variables.
  - We present a new Fst-based genome-scan method, BayeScEnv, which
incorporates environmental information in the form of 'environmental
differentiation'. It is based on the F-model, but, as opposed to existing
approaches, it considers two locus-specific effects; one due to divergent
selection, and another one due to various other processes different from local
adaptation (e.g. range expansions, differences in mutation rates across loci or
background selection). The method was developped in C++ and is avaible at
http://github.com/devillemereuil/bayescenv.
  - Simulation studies shows that our method has a much lower false positive
rate than an existing Fst-based method, BayeScan, under a wide range of
demographic scenarios. Although it has lower power, it leads to a better
compromise between power and false positive rate.
  - We apply our method to human and salmon datasets and show that it can be
used successfully to study local adaptation. We discuss its scope and compare
its mechanics to other existing methods.

Edition 1</journal-ref><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Background: While many infectious disease epidemics are initially
characterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level
Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower
polynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease.
Methods: We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales
(regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time
series of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from
the World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014.
Results: We found significant differences in the growth patterns of EVD cases
at the scale of the country, district, and other subnational administrative
divisions. The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone,
and Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local
epidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more
EVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an
exponential. Conclusions: The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD
outbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes,
success of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as
a high level of clustering. Quantifying the contribution of each of these
factors could help refine estimates of final epidemic size and the relative
impact of different mitigation efforts in current and future EVD outbreaks.

unpredictable environments often alternate between different evolutionary
strategies to spread and reduce risks. Such behavior is commonly referred to as
&quot;bet-hedging.&quot; Long-term survival probabilities and population sizes can be
much enhanced by exploiting such hybrid strategies. Here, we study the simplest
possible birth-death stochastic model in which individuals can choose among a
poor but safe strategy, a better but risky alternative, or a combination of
both. We show analytically and computationally that the benefits derived from
bet-hedging strategies are much stronger for higher environmental variabilities
(large external noise) and/or for small spatial dimensions (large intrinsic
noise). These circumstances are typically encountered by living systems, thus
providing us with a possible justification for the ubiquitousness of
bet-hedging in nature.

a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics
experiments usually relies on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the
thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of
metabolites remain unknown. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for
the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These
trees are found by combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the
experimental data via fragmentation cascades. To obtain biochemically
meaningful results requires an elaborate optimization function. We present a
new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial
optimization into a maximum a posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the
superiority of the new scoring for two tasks: Both for the de novo
identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a
database for structurally similar compounds, our methods performs significantly
better than the previous scoring, as well as other methods for this task. Our
method can expedite the workflow for untargeted metabolomics, allowing
researchers to investigate unknowns using automated computational methods.

&gt;150 protein components of the spliceosome. The steps at which splicing can be
regulated remain largely unknown. We systematically analyzed the effect of
knocking down the components of the splicing machinery on alternative splicing
events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis and used this information
to reconstruct a network of functional interactions. The network accurately
captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones,
revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components,
related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome
assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of
splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the
spliceosome display regulatory properties. The network also sheds light on the
antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can
be widely used to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.

have quite a few common graph edges that may describe the same connections
between the same cortical areas. The Budapest Reference Connectome Server Ver.
2.0 (http://connectome.pitgroup.org) generates the common edges of the
connectomes of 96 distinct cortexes, each with 1015 vertices, computed from 96
MRI data sets of the Human Connectome Project. The user may set numerous
parameters for the identification and filtering of common edges, and the graphs
are downloadable in both csv and GraphML formats; both formats carry the
anatomical annotations of the vertices, generated by the Freesurfer program.
The resulting consensus graph is also automatically visualized in a 3D rotating
brain model on the website.
  The consensus graphs, generated with various parameter settings, can be used
as reference connectomes based on different, independent MRI images, therefore
they may serve as reduced-error, low-noise, robust graph representations of the
human brain.

measures to quantify the dissimilarity of two trees. Recently, a new distance
measure has been proposed: the Maximum Parsimony (MP) distance. This is based
on the difference of the parsimony scores of a single character on both trees
under consideration, and the goal is to find the character which maximizes this
difference. Here we show that computation of MP distance on two \emph{binary}
phylogenetic trees is NP-hard. This is a highly nontrivial extension of an
earlier NP-hardness proof for two multifurcating phylogenetic trees, and it is
particularly relevant given the prominence of binary trees in the phylogenetics
literature. As a corollary to the main hardness result we show that computation
of MP distance is also hard on binary trees if the number of states available
is bounded. In fact, via a different reduction we show that it is hard even if
only two states are available. Finally, as a first response to this hardness we
give a simple Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation which is capable of
computing the MP distance exactly for small trees (and for larger trees when
only a small number of character states are available) and which is used to
computationally verify several auxiliary results required by the hardness
proofs.

translational bursting have the opposite effects. In a positively autoregulated
gene, increasing the noise converts the response from graded to binary, while
increasing the leakage converts the response from binary to graded. Our
findings support the hypothesis that, being a common phenomenon, leaky
expression may be a relatively easy way for evolutionary tuning of the type of
gene response without changing the type of regulation from positive to
negative.

tracking the three-dimensional motion of hundreds of dispersed Brownian
particles of sizes ranging from the thickness of the chromatin fiber up to
slightly above the mesh size of the chromatin solution. In agreement with
previous computational studies on polymer solutions and melts, we found that
the large-time behaviour of diffusion coefficient and the experienced viscosity
of moving particles as functions of particle size deviate from the traditional
Stokes-Einstein relation, and agree with a recent scaling theory of diffusion
of non-sticky particles in polymer solutions. Interestingly, we found that at
short times large particles are temporary &quot;caged&quot; by chromatin spatial
constraints, which thus form effective domains whose size match remarkably well
recent experimental results for micro-tracers inside interphase nuclei.
Finally, by employing a known mathematical relation between the time
mean-square displacement of tracked particles and the complex shear modulus of
the surrounding solution, we calculated the elastic and viscous moduli of
interphase chromosomes.

  emergence of functional brain networks</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Rich, spontaneous brain activity has been observed across a range of
different temporal and spatial scales. These dynamics are thought to be
important t for efficient neural functioning. Experimental evidence suggests
that these neural dynamics are maintained across a variety of different
cognitive states, in response to alterations of the environment and to changes
in brain configuration (e.g., across individuals, development and in many
neurological disorders). This suggests that the brain has evolved mechanisms to
stabilize dynamics and maintain them across a range of situations. Here, we
employ a local homeostatic inhibitory plasticity mechanism, balancing
inhibitory and excitatory activity in a model of macroscopic brain activity
based on white-matter structural connectivity. We demonstrate that the addition
of homeostatic plasticity regulates network activity and allows for the
emergence of rich, spontaneous dynamics across a range of brain configurations.
Furthermore, the presence of homeostatic plasticity maximises the overlap
between empirical and simulated patterns of functional connectivity. Therefore,
this work presents a simple, local, biologically plausible inhibitory mechanism
that allows stable dynamics to emerge in the brain and which facilitates the
formation of functional connectivity networks.

movement of agents who interact via alignment, attraction, and/or repulsion.
Each simulation time frame is a point cloud in position-velocity space. We
analyze the topological structure of these point clouds, interpreting the
persistent homology by calculating the first few Betti numbers. These Betti
numbers count connected components, topological circles, and trapped volumes
present in the data. To interpret our results, we introduce a visualization
that displays Betti numbers over simulation time and topological persistence
scale. We compare our topological results to order parameters typically used to
quantify the global behavior of aggregations, such as polarization and angular
momentum. The topological calculations reveal events and structure not captured
by the order parameters.

between spatially distinct brain regions and is usually inferred from the time
series coherence/correlation in brain activity between regions of interest. In
human functional brain networks, the network structure is often inferred from
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent
(BOLD) signal. Since the BOLD signal is a proxy for neuronal activity, it is of
interest to learn the latent functional network structure. Additionally,
despite a core set of observations about functional networks such as
small-worldness, modularity, exponentially truncated degree distributions, and
presence of various types of hubs, very little is known about the computational
principles which can give rise to these observations. This paper introduces a
Hidden Markov Random Field framework for the purpose of representing,
estimating, and evaluating latent neuronal functional relationships between
different brain regions using fMRI data.

evolutionary and a breeding perspective. For plant traits heritability is
traditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability.
This approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account for
different genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markers
there is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-sense
heritability, using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated from
genetic markers. Such estimates have received much attention in human genetics
but are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that current
methodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hence
requiring genotypic means. An alternative that we propose here, is to use mixed
models at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments,
simulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches,
and how these affect genomic prediction with G-BLUP and genome-wide association
studies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very large
standard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models at
individual plant or plot level produced more realistic estimates, and for
simulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomic
prediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49%
increase in accuracy. For GWAS on simulated traits, the use of individual plant
data gave almost no increase in power. The new methodology is applicable to any
complex trait where multiple replicates of individual genotypes can be scored.
This includes important agronomic crops, as well as bacteria and fungi.

continue to evolve. Elucidating how microbial communities respond to human
habitats is a fundamental and critical task, as establishing baselines of human
microbiome is essential in understanding its role in human disease and health.
However, current studies usually overlook a complex and interconnected
landscape of human microbiome and limit the ability in particular body habitats
with learning models of specific criterion. Therefore, these methods could not
capture the real-world underlying microbial patterns effectively. To obtain a
comprehensive view, we propose a novel ensemble clustering framework to mine
the structure of microbial community pattern on large-scale metagenomic data.
Particularly, we first build a microbial similarity network via integrating
1920 metagenomic samples from three body habitats of healthy adults. Then a
novel symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based ensemble model is
proposed and applied onto the network to detect clustering pattern. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on
deriving microbial community with respect to body habitat and host gender. From
clustering results, we observed that body habitat exhibits a strong bound but
non-unique microbial structural patterns. Meanwhile, human microbiome reveals
different degree of structural variations over body habitat and host gender. In
summary, our ensemble clustering framework could efficiently explore integrated
clustering results to accurately identify microbial communities, and provide a
comprehensive view for a set of microbial communities. Such trends depict an
integrated biography of microbial communities, which offer a new insight
towards uncovering pathogenic model of human microbiome.

structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and
Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate
protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known
PDZ-2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric
pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property
was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through
the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a
normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 {\AA}) that acted as a thermal rectifier. In
contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60
{\AA}), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat
diffusion was due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of
residues that, in turn, was also mediated by hydrogen bonds. This
asymmetrical/symmetrical energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal
communication directionality in proteins and for the control of heat flow in
materials science.

classical bioinformatics problem. Common methods use feed forward neural
networks or SVMs combined with a sliding window, as these models does not
naturally handle sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are an
generalization of the feed forward neural network that naturally handle
sequential data. We use a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long
short term memory cells for prediction of secondary structure and evaluate
using the CB513 dataset. On the secondary structure 8-class problem we report
better performance (0.674) than state of the art (0.664). Our model includes
feed forward networks between the long short term memory cells, a path that can
be further explored.

set of conditions typical for basic models like leaky integrate and fire, or
binding neuron model. A neuron is fed with a point renewal process. A relation
between the three probability density functions (pdf): (i) pdf of input
interspike intervals, (ii) pdf of output interspike intervals of a neuron with
instantaneous feedback and (iii) pdf for that same neuron without feedback is
derived. This allows to calculate any of the three pdfs provided the another
two are given. Similar relation between corresponding means and variances is
derived. The relations are checked exactly for the binding neuron model.

  Skull Evolution</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.QM stat.AP</categories><comments>42 pages, 18 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  This article shows how 3D geometric morphometric data can be analyzed using
newly developed distance-based evolutionary tree inference methods, with
extensions to planar graphs. Application of these methods to 3D representations
of the skullcap (calvaria) of 13 diverse skulls in the genus Homo, ranging from
Homo erectus (ergaster) at about 1.6 mya, all the way forward to modern humans,
yields a remarkably clear phylogenetic tree. Various evolutionary hypotheses
are tested. Results of these tests include rejection of the monophyly of Homo
heidelbergensis, the Multi-Regional hypothesis, and the hypothesis that the
unusual 12,000 year old (12kya) Iwo Eleru skull represents a modern human.
Rather, by quantitative phylogenetic analyses the latter is seen to be an old
(200-400kya) lineage that probably represents a novel African species, Homo
iwoelerueensis. It diverged after the lineage leading to Neanderthals, and may
have been driven to extinction in the last 10kya by modern humans, Homo
sapiens, another African species of Homo that appeared about 100kya. Another
enigmatic skull, Qafzeh 6 from the Middle East about 90kya, appears to be a
hybrid of two thirds near, but not, anatomically modern human and one third of
an archaic lineage diverging close to classic European Neanderthals. Overall,
the tree clearly implies an accelerating rate of skullcap shape change, and by
extension, change of the underlying brain, over the last 400kya in Africa. This
acceleration may have extended right up to the origin of modern humans. Methods
of distance-based evolutionary tree inference are refined and extended, with
particular attention to diagnosing the model and achieving a better fit. This
includes power transformations of the input data which favor root Procrustes
distances.

in malignancy and appears to play an important role during cancer metastasis.
Using in silico experiments, we study the interplay between collective
behaviours and cell motility heterogeneities in a model system. Working with
tumour spheroids that contain two non-proliferating cell populations of
different motile properties, we explore the conditions required for maximal
invasion into surrounding tissues. We show emerging spatial patterns of
cellular organisation and invasion which are consistent with in vitro and in
vivo observations. This demonstrates that mechanical interactions at the
cellular level are sufficient to account for many of the observed morphologies
of invasion and that heterogeneity in cell motility can be more important than
average mechanical properties in controlling the fate of large cell
populations.

  Neurons</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this report trial-to-trial variations in the synchronized responses of
neural networks are offered as evidence for excitation-inhibition ratio being a
dynamic variable over time scales of minutes. Synchronized network responses to
stimuli were studied in ex-vivo large scale cortical networks. We show that
sub-second measures of the individual synchronous response, namely -- its
latency and decay duration, are related to minutes-scale network response
dynamics. Network responsiveness is reflected as residency in, or shifting
amongst, areas of the latency-decay plane. The different sensitivities of
latency and decay durations to synaptic blockers imply that these two measures
reflect the effective impacts of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations
on response dynamics. Taken together, the data suggest that network response
variations under repeated stimuli result from excitation-inhibition ratio being
a dynamic variable rather than a parameter.

  (2011)</journal-ref><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The Memory Process, edited by Suzanne Nalbantian, Paul M. Matthews, and James
L. McClelland, is an intriguing and well-written book that provides a
groundbreaking overview of diverse approaches to understanding memory that sets
the agenda for an interdisciplinary approach to the topic. Memory has long been
a focus of investigation and interest in both the sciences and the humanities.
The way memory enriches and distorts lived experience has been widely explored
in literature and the arts. Our fascination with the subject is increasingly
evident in popular culture, with the widespread proliferation of novels and
movies in which events play out in a nonlinear fashion that reflects how
memories of them are woven together in the minds of the characters involved.
Scientific approaches to memory have focused on the study of amnesiacs,
neuroimaging studies, and cognitive studies of the formation, retrieval, and
forgetting of memories. Until now, however, humanistic and scientific
investigations of memory have been carried out independently. This book
provides an exemplary illustration of how disciplinary boundaries can be
transcended, showing how approaches to memory from the humanities and the
sciences can revitalize one another. With 19 chapters written by academics from
a range of disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry,
cognitive science, cultural studies, philosophy, bioethics, history of science,
art, theatre, film, and literature, it is undoubtedly one of the most
interdisciplinary books on library shelves. Together these diverse perspectives
provide a broad and stimulating overview of the memory process.

Theory&quot; ed. by Prof. Christos H Skiadas. The chapter is organized as follows.
First we study the statistical properties of combs and explain how to reduce
the effect of teeth on the movement along the backbone as a waiting time
distribution between consecutive jumps. Second, we justify an employment of a
comb-like structure as a paradigm for further exploration of a spiny dendrite.
In particular, we show how a comb-like structure can sustain the phenomenon of
the anomalous diffusion, reaction-diffusion and L\'evy walks. Finally, we
illustrate how the same models can be also useful to deal with the mechanism of
ta translocation wave / translocation waves of CaMKII and its propagation
failure. We also present a brief introduction to the fractional
integro-differentiation in appendix at the end of the chapter.

  Root Phenotyping</title><categories>q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph</categories><comments>5 pages, 10 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  New imaging techniques are in great demand for investigating underground
plant roots systems which play an important role in crop production. Compared
with other non-destructive imaging modalities, PET can image plant roots in
natural soil and produce dynamic 3D functional images which reveal the temporal
dynamics of plant-environment interactions. In this study, we combined PET with
optical projection tomography (OPT) to evaluate its potential for plant root
phenotyping. We used a dedicated high resolution plant PET imager that has a 14
cm transaxial and 10 cm axial field of views, and multi-bed imaging capability.
The image resolution is around 1.25 mm using ML-EM reconstruction algorithm.
B73 inbred maize seeds were germinated and then grown in a sealed jar with
transparent gel-based media. PET scanning started on the day when the first
green leaf appeared, and was carried out once a day for 5 days. Each morning,
around 10 mCi of 11CO2 was administrated into a custom built plant labeling
chamber. After 10 minutes, residual activity was flushed out with fresh air
before a 2-h PET scan started. For the OPT imaging, the jar was placed inside
an acrylic cubic container filled with water, illuminated with a uniform
surface light source, and imaged by a DSLR camera from 72 angles to acquire
optical images for OPT reconstruction. The same plant was imaged 3 times a day
by the OPT system. Plant roots growth is measured from the optical images.
Co-registered PET and optical images indicate that most of the hot spots
appeared in later time points of the PET images correspond to the most actively
growing root tips. The strong linear correlation between 11C allocation at root
tips measured by PET and eventual root growth measured by OPT suggests that we
can use PET as a phenotyping tool to measure how a plant makes subterranean
carbon allocation decisions in different environmental scenarios.

In many
cases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as
operons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:
gene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently
observed. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the
formation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been
proposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of
gene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene
block evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for
tracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the
evolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of
events. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes
out of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the
event-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the
evolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation. We
conclude that the event-based method can be used to help us understand the
formation of these important bacterial genomic structures. Availability: The

variations, the exact trajectories characterising the biological responses
differ. We examined whether the differences seen between metabolic trajectories
of a specific treatment, correspond to the variations seen in the other
biological manifestations of the same treatment. Differences in trajectories
were measured via alignment procedures which introduced and implemented in this
study. Our study revealed strong correlation between the scales of the aligned
trajectories of metabolic responses and the severity of the hepatocelluar
lesions induced after administration of hydrazine. Thus the results confirm
that aligned trajectories are characteristic of a specific treatment. They then
can be used for comparison with other treatment specific or unknown metabolic
trajectories and can have many metabonomic applications such as preclinical
toxicological screening

failed or insufficient lymphangiogenesis, that is the formation of new
lymphatic capillaries. Although many mathematical models have been developed to
describe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis) very few have been
proposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Moreover,
lymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at
different times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary
differential equations is presented to describe the formation of lymphatic
capillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell
densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters
are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved
numerically and the results are compared with the available biological
literature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as
a starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the
enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors
involved. In particular, the balance between TGF-$\beta$ and VEGF levels,
rather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective
lymphangiogenesis. In addition, the results indicate lowering the
macrophage-mediated activation of TGF-$\beta$ and increasing the basal
lymphatic endothelial cell growth rate, \emph{inter alia}, as potential
treatments. It is hoped the findings of this paper may be considered in the
development of future experiments investigating novel lymphangiogenic
therapies.

existing modelling formalisms are gene interaction graphs, where edges between
genes denote either an activation or inhibition relation. However, when
designing experiments, it is important to be precise about the low-level
mechanistic details as to how each such relation is implemented. The rule-based
modelling language Kappa allows to unambiguously specify mechanistic details
such as DNA binding sites, dimerisation of transcription factors, or
co-operative interactions. However, such a detailed description comes with
complexity and computationally costly execution. We propose a general method
for automatically transforming a rule-based program, by eliminating
intermediate species and adjusting the rate constants accordingly. Our method
consists of searching for those interaction patterns known to be amenable to
equilibrium approximations (e.g. Michaelis-Menten scheme). The reduced model is
efficiently obtained by static inspection over the rule-set, and it represents
a particular theoretical limit of the original model. The Bhattacharyya
distance is proposed as a metric to estimate the reduction error for a given
observable. The tool is tested on a detailed rule-based model of a
$\lambda$-phage switch, which lists $96$ rules and $16$ agents. The reduced
model has $11$ rules and $5$ agents, and provides a dramatic reduction in
simulation time of several orders of magnitude.

  vocal repetition</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Consecutive repetition of actions is common in behavioral sequences. Although
integration of sensory feedback with internal motor programs is important for
sequence generation, if and how feedback contributes to repetitive actions is
poorly understood. Here we study how auditory feedback contributes to
generating repetitive syllable sequences in songbirds. We propose that auditory
signals provide positive feedback to ongoing motor commands, but this influence
decays as feedback weakens from response adaptation during syllable
repetitions. Computational models show that this mechanism explains repeat
distributions observed in Bengalese finch song. We experimentally confirmed two
predictions of this mechanism in Bengalese finches: removal of auditory
feedback by deafening reduces syllable repetitions; and neural responses to
auditory playback of repeated syllable sequences gradually adapt in
sensory-motor nucleus HVC. Together, our results implicate a positive
auditory-feedback loop with adaptation in generating repetitive vocalizations,
and suggest sensory adaptation is important for feedback control of motor
sequences.

(V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments on the T cell receptor (TCR) loci.
To determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR
loci contributes to the observed clonal frequencies, the TCR loci were examined
for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of gene segment organization.
Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that the V
and J gene segments for both T cell receptor alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) loci
were arranged in a self-similar manner when the spacing between adjacent
segments was considered as a function of the size of the neighboring gene
segment. The ratio of genomic distance between either the J (in TRA) or D (in
TRB) segments and successive V segments on these loci declined logarithmically.
Accounting for the gene segments occurring on helical DNA molecules, in a
logarithmic distribution, sine and cosine functions of the log transformed
angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene
segments showed an ordered progression across the locus, supporting a
log-periodic organization. T cell clonal frequencies, based on V and J segment
usage, from three normal stem cell donors plotted against the respective
segment locations on TRB locus demonstrated a periodic variation. We
hypothesize that this quasi-periodic variation in T cell clonal repertoire may
be influenced by the location of the gene segments on the logarithmically
scaled TCR loci. Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double
helix may influence the probability of gene segment usage by means of either
constructive or destructive interference resulting from the superposition of
the two helices, impacting probability of DNA recombination.

neurobiologists and mathematicians dedicated to stimulus reconstruction from
neuronal spiking activity. This collaboration, in particular, led to the
consideration of binary codes used by brain for encoding a stimuli domain such
as a rodent's territory through the combinatorics of its covering by local
neighborhoods.
  The survey is addressed to mathematicians (cf. [DeSch01]) and focuses on the
idea that stimuli spaces are represented by the relevant neural codes as
simplicial sets and thus encode say, the homotopy type of space if local
neighborhoods are convex (see [CuIt08], [CuItVCYo13], [Yo14], [SiGh07]).}

It
also correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with
the largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a
predictive formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical
measurements. The median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years
playing Native American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing
the instrument (p = .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress
rates (p = .001). Physical discomfort was experienced by 47-64% of players at
least some of the time. Over 10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an
average basis. Females report significantly higher maximum and average physical
discomfort than males (p &lt; .001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span,
hand span, and reported length of time playing and experience level all
correlated with the largest flute that the player found comfortable.
Multivariate coefficient analysis on those factors yielded a formula with a
strong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r = +.650). However, the
formula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in predicting flute
design. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of improving
ergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.

on a fixed and known shape of the impulse response of the neurovascular
coupling, namely the hemodynamic response function (HRF). To cope with this
issue, the joint detection-estimation (JDE) framework has been proposed. This
formalism enables to estimate a HRF per region but for doing so, it assumes a
prior brain partition (or parcellation) regarding hemodynamic territories. This
partition has to be accurate enough to recover accurate HRF shapes but has also
to overcome the detection-estimation issue: the lack of hemodynamics
information in the non-active positions. An hemodynamically-based parcellation
method is proposed, consisting first of a feature extraction step, followed by
a Gaussian Mixture-based parcellation, which considers the injection of the
activation levels in the parcellation process, in order to overcome the
detection-estimation issue and find the underlying hemodynamics.

data provides a quantitative measure of blood perfusion, that can be correlated
to neuronal activation. In contrast to BOLD measure, it is a direct measure of
cerebral blood flow. However, ASL data has a lower SNR and resolution so that
the recovery of the perfusion response of interest suffers from the
contamination by a stronger hemodynamic component in the ASL signal. In this
work we consider a model of both hemodynamic and perfusion components within
the ASL signal. A physiological link between these two components is analyzed
and used for a more accurate estimation of the perfusion response function in
particular in the usual ASL low SNR conditions.

intersensory matching of audio--visual fluent speech in 12-month-old infants.
German-learning infants&#xe2;&#x80;&#x99; audio--visual matching ability of German and French
fluent speech was assessed by using a variant of the intermodal matching
procedure, with auditory and visual speech information presented sequentially.
In Experiment 1, the sentences were spoken in an adult-directed (AD) manner.
Results showed that 12-month-old infants did not exhibit a matching performance
for the native, nor for the non-native language. However, Experiment 2 revealed
that when ID speech stimuli were used, infants did perceive the relation
between auditory and visual speech attributes, but only in response to their
native language. Thus, the findings suggest that ID speech might have an
influence on the intersensory perception of fluent speech and shed further
light on multisensory perceptual narrowing.

networks. In our model, PPI networks evolve by two known biological mechanisms:
(1) Gene duplication, which is followed by rapid diversification of duplicate
interactions. (2) Neofunctionalization, in which a mutation leads to a new
interaction with some other protein. Since many interactions are due to simple
surface compatibility, we hypothesize there is an increased likelihood of
interacting with other proteins in the target protein's neighborhood. We find
good agreement of the model on 10 different network properties compared to
high-confidence experimental PPI networks in yeast, fruit flies, and humans.
Key findings are: (1) PPI networks evolve modular structures, with no need to
invoke particular selection pressures. (2) Proteins in cells have on average
about 6 degrees of separation, similar to some social networks, such as
human-communication and actor networks. (3) Unlike social networks, which have
a shrinking diameter (degree of maximum separation) over time, PPI networks are
predicted to grow in diameter. (4) The model indicates that evolutionarily old
proteins should have higher connectivities and be more centrally embedded in
their networks. This suggests a way in which present-day proteomics data could
provide insights into biological evolution.

catalyse the reduction of O2- into hydrogen peroxide. Three different classes
of SOR have been reported on the basis of the presence or not of an additional
N-terminal domain. They all share a similar active site, with an unusual
non-heme Fe atom coordinated by four equatorial histidines and one axial
cysteine residues. Crucial catalytic reaction intermediates of SOR are
purported to be Fe(3+)-(hydro)peroxo species. Using resonance Raman
spectroscopy, we compared the vibrational properties of the Fe3+ active site of
two different classes of SOR, from Desulfoarculus baarsii and Treponema
pallidum, along with their ferrocyanide and their peroxo complexes. In both
species, rapid treatment with H2O2 results in the stabilization of a side-on
high spin Fe(3+)-(eta(2)-OO) peroxo species. Comparison of these two peroxo
species reveals significant differences in vibrational frequencies and bond
strengths of the Fe-O2 (weaker) and O-O (stronger) bonds for the T. pallidum
enzyme. Thus, the two peroxo adducts in these two SORs have different
stabilities which are also seen to be correlated with differences in the Fe-S
coordination strengths as gauged by the Fe-S vibrational frequencies. This was
interpreted from structural variations in the two active sites, resulting in
differences in the electron donating properties of the trans cysteine ligand.
Our results suggest that the structural differences observed in the active site
of different classes of SORs should be a determining factor for the rate of
release of the iron-peroxo intermediate during enzymatic turnover.

superoxide radical in microorganisms. Its active site consists of an unusual
non-heme Fe2+ center in a [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal pentacoordination, with
the axial cysteine ligand proposed to be an essential feature in catalysis. Two
NH peptide groups from isoleucine 118 and histidine 119 establish H-bondings
with the sulfur ligand (Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR numbering). In order to
investigate the catalytic role of these H-bonds, the isoleucine 118 residue of
the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii was mutated into alanine, aspartate or
serine residues. Resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that the mutations
specifically induced an increase of the strength of the Fe3+-S(Cys) and
S-C$\beta$(Cys) bonds as well as a change in conformation of the cysteinyl side
chain, which was associated with the alteration of the NH hydrogen bonding to
the sulfur ligand. The effects of the isoleucine mutations on the reactivity of
SOR with $O2\bullet$- were investigated by pulse radiolysis. These studies
showed that the mutations induced a specific increase of the pKa of the first
reaction intermediate, recently proposed to be an $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ species.
These data were supported by DFT calculations carried out on three models of
the $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ intermediate, with one, two or no H-bonds on the sulfur
ligand. Our results demonstrated that the hydrogen bonds between the NH
(peptide) and the cysteine ligand tightly control the rate of protonation of
the $Fe2+-O2\bullet-$ reaction intermediate to form an Fe3+-OOH species.

monomer of 26.2 kDa that catalyzes the reduction of free flavins using NADPH or
NADH as electron donor. The enzyme does not contain any prosthetic group but
accommodates both the reduced pyridine nucleotide and the flavin in a ternary
complex prior to oxidoreduction. The specificity of the flavin reductase for
the pyridine nucleotide was studied by steady-state kinetics using a variety of
NADP analogs. Both the nicotinamide ring and the adenosine part of the
substrate molecule have been found to be important for binding to the
polypeptide chain. However, in the case of NADPH, the 2'-phosphate group
destabilized almost completely the interaction with the adenosine moiety.
Moreover, NADPH and NMNH are very good substrates for the flavin reductase, and
we have shown that both these molecules bind to the enzyme almost exclusively
by the nicotinamide ring. This provides evidence that the flavin reductase
exhibits a unique mode for recognition of the reduced pyridine nucleotide. In
addition, we have shown that the flavin reductase selectively transfers the
pro-R hydrogen from the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring and is therefore
classified as an A-side-specific enzyme.

with a rate constant of (1.1 +/- 0.3) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1). A first intermediate
is formed which is converted to a second one at a much slower rate constant of
500 +/- 50 s(-1). Decay of the second intermediate occurs with a rate constant
of 25 +/- 5 s(-1). These intermediates are suggested to be iron-superoxide and
iron-peroxide species. Furthermore, the role of glutamate 47 and lysine 48,
which are the closest charged residues to the vacant sixth iron coordination
site, has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of glutamate
47 into alanine has no effect on the rates of the reaction. On the contrary,
mutation of lysine 48 into an isoleucine led to a 20-30-fold decrease of the
rate constant of the bimolecular reaction, suggesting that lysine 48 plays an
important role during guiding and binding of superoxide to the iron center II.
In addition, we report that expression of the lysine 48 sor mutant gene hardly
restored to a superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli mutant the
ability to grow under aerobic conditions.

reduction of O2*- to H2O2. The reaction of the enzyme from Treponema pallidum
with superoxide was studied by pulse radiolysis methods. The first step is an
extremely fast bi-molecular reaction of the ferrous center with O2, with a rate
constant of 6 x 10 (8) M(-1) s(-1). A first intermediate is formed which is
converted to a second one with a slower rate constant of 4800 s(-1). This
latter value is 10 times higher than the corresponding one previously reported
in the case of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii. The reconstituted spectra for
the two intermediates are consistent with formation of transient iron-peroxide
species.

valuable in deciphering and understanding the intricate organisation of
cellular functions. Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein
interaction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the
spatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may
occur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages. Results: We
integrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer
(APID) with different meta-data to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific
interactome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained
interactome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins
involved in macrophage-related biological processes (i.e. immune response
activation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the
contextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: Our work confirms that
contextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of
bioinformatic analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network
rather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is informative on the
processes involved in the host response. Indeed, important immune features such
as apoptosis are solely highlighted when the spotlight is on the protein
interaction level.

some FMN bound, this form was not involved in the flavin reductase activity. By
studying the ferric reductase activity of ActVB, we show that its FMN-bound
form exhibits a proper enzymatic activity of reduction of iron complexes by
NADH. This shows that ActVB active site exhibits a dual property with regard to
the FMN. It can use it as a substrate that goes in and off the active site or
as a cofactor to provide an electron transferase activity to the polypeptide.

of enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in a number of metabolic and
biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. One component is a NAD(P)H:flavin
oxidoreductase, which provides a reduced flavin to the second component, the
proper monooxygenase. There, the reduced flavin activates molecular oxygen for
substrate oxidation. Here, we study the flavin reductase ActVB and ActVA-ORF5
gene product, both reported to be involved in the last step of biosynthesis of
the natural antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. For the first
time we show that ActVA-ORF5 is a FMN-dependent monooxygenase that together
with the help of the flavin reductase ActVB catalyzes the oxidation reaction.
The mechanism of the transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has
been investigated. Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin
(FMNox and FMNred) with regard to ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 have been determined.
The data clearly demonstrate a thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to
ActVA-ORF5 without involving a particular interaction between the two protein
components. In full agreement with these data, we propose a reaction mechanism
in which FMNox binds to ActVB, where it is reduced, and the resulting FMNred
moves to ActVA-ORF5, where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide
intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species
within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.

unusual [His4 Cys1] square-pyramidal geometry. It specifically reduces
superoxide to produce H2O2. Here, we have reacted the SOR from Desulfoarculus
baarsii directly with H2O2. We have found that its active site can transiently
stabilize an Fe3+-peroxo species that we have spectroscopically characterized
by resonance Raman. The mutation of the strictly conserved Glu47 into alanine
results in a stabilization of this Fe3+-peroxo species, when compared to the
wild-type form. These data support the hypothesis that the reaction of SOR
proceeds through such a Fe3+-peroxo intermediate. This also suggests that Glu47
might serve to help H2O2 release during the reaction with superoxide.

superoxide reductase (SOR) to eliminate the toxic superoxide anion radical
(O2*-). SOR catalyses the one-electron reduction of O2*- to hydrogen peroxide
at a nonheme ferrous iron center. The structures of Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR
(mutant E47A) alone and in complex with ferrocyanide were solved to 1.15 and
1.7 A resolution, respectively. The latter structure, the first ever reported
of a complex between ferrocyanide and a protein, reveals that this
organo-metallic compound entirely plugs the SOR active site, coordinating the
active iron through a bent cyano bridge. The subtle structural differences
between the mixed-valence and the fully reduced SOR-ferrocyanide adducts were
investigated by taking advantage of the photoelectrons induced by X-rays. The
results reveal that photo-reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II) of the iron center,
a very rapid process under a powerful synchrotron beam, induces an expansion of
the SOR active site.

inter-spike intervals (ISI) occurring during the progression of status
epilepticus (SE), so that the emergence of critical states could be reasonably
hypothesized as being part of the intrinsic nature of the SE. Methods. Status
epilepticus was induced by pilocarpine administration in post-natal 21-day rats
(n=8). For each animal, 24 hours of EEG from the onset of the SE were analyzed
according to the analytical procedure suggested by Clauset et al. (2009) which
combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and likelihood ratios. The analytical
procedure was implemented by the freely available R software package
&quot;poweRlaw&quot;. Time of calculations was considerably shorten by the exploitation
of High-Throughput Computing technology, a.k.a. Grid Computing technology.
Results. The progression of the SE is characterized by the emergence of
power-law correlations of ISI whose likelihood of occurrence increases the more
the time from the onset of the SE elapses. Log-normal distribution of ISI is
however widely represented. Additionally, undetermined distributions of ISI are
represented as well, although confined within a restricted temporal window. The
final stage of SE appears dominated only by power-law and log-normal
distributions of ISI. Significance. The emergence of power-law correlations of
ISI concretely supports the concept of the occurrence of critical states during
the progression of SE. It is reasonably speculated, as a working hypothesis,
that the occurrence of power-law distributions of ISI within the early stages
of the SE could be a hallmark of the establishment of the route to
epileptogenesis.

and small spatial scale motion of quantum dots labeling proteins in cell
membranes. Our analysis focuses on the jumps which are the changes in the
position of the quantum dots between frames in a movie of their motion.
Previously we have shown that the directions of the jumps are uniformly
distributed and the jump lengths can be characterized by a double power law
distribution.
  Here we show that the jumps over a small number of time steps can be
described by scalings of a {\em single} double power law distribution. This
provides additional strong evidence that the double power law provides an
accurate description of the fine scale motion. This more extensive analysis
provides strong evidence that the double power law is a novel stable
distribution for the motion. This analysis provides strong evidence that an
earlier result that the motion can be modeled as diffusion in a space of
fractional dimension roughly 3/2 is correct. The form of the power law
distribution quantifies the excess of short jumps in the data and provides an
accurate characterization of the fine scale diffusion and, in fact, this
distribution gives an accurate description of the jump lengths up to a few
hundred nanometers. Our results complement of the usual mean squared
displacement analysis used to study diffusion at larger scales where the
proteins are more likely to strongly interact with larger membrane structures.

found to depend on the steady state host population and pathogen growth rate.
Linear estimate of the extinction time is computed. The steady state host
population shows a threshold behavior in the interaction strength for a given

some applications of information theory in neuroscience to study encoding of
information in both single neurons and neuronal populations.

study of communication over noisy channels. Its probabilistic basis and
capacity to relate statistical structure to function make it ideally suited for
studying information flow in the nervous system. It has a number of useful
properties: it is a general measure sensitive to any relationship, not only
linear effects; it has meaningful units which in many cases allow direct
comparison between different experiments; and it can be used to study how much
information can be gained by observing neural responses in single trials,
rather than in averages over multiple trials. A variety of information
theoretic quantities are in common use in neuroscience - (see entry &quot;Summary of
Information-Theoretic Quantities&quot;). Estimating these quantities in an accurate
and unbiased way from real neurophysiological data frequently presents
challenges, which are explained in this entry.

modifications in different molecular structures, able to store biochemical
information that is not encoded by the DNA. Some of these covalent mark
patterns can be transmitted across generations (epigenetic changes). Recently,
the emergence of Hopfield-like attractor dynamics has been observed in the
self-organized enzymatic networks, which have the capacity to store functional
catalytic patterns that can be correctly recovered by the specific input
stimuli. The Hopfield-like metabolic dynamics are stable and can be maintained
as a long-term biochemical memory. In addition, specific molecular information
can be transferred from the functional dynamics of the metabolic networks to
the enzymatic activity involved in the covalent post-translational modulation
so that determined functional memory can be embedded in multiple stable
molecular marks. Both the metabolic dynamics governed by Hopfield-type
attractors (functional processes) and the enzymatic covalent modifications of
determined molecules (structural dynamic processes) seem to represent the two
stages of the dynamical memory of cellular metabolism (metabolic memory).
Epigenetic processes appear to be the structural manifestation of this cellular
metabolic memory. Here, a new framework for molecular information storage in
the cell is presented, which is characterized by two functionally and
molecularly interrelated systems: a dynamic, flexible and adaptive system
(metabolic memory) and an essentially conservative system (genetic memory). The
molecular information of both systems seems to coordinate the physiological
development of the whole cell.

accessibility percolation problem: The vertices of the unoriented
$n$-dimensional binary hypercube are assigned independent $U(0, 1)$ weights,
referred to as fitnesses. A path is considered accessible if fitnesses are
strictly increasing along it. We prove that the probability that the global
fitness maximum is accessible from the all zeroes vertex converges to
$1-\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(2+\sqrt{5}\right)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we
prove that if one conditions on the location of the fitness maximum being $v$,
then provided $v$ is not too close to the all zeroes vertex in Hamming
distance, the probability that $v$ is accessible converges to a function of
this distance divided by $n$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. This resolves a
conjecture by Berestycki, Brunet and Shi in almost full generality.
  As a second result we show that, for any graph, accessibility percolation can
equivalently be formulated in terms of first-passage site percolation. This
connection is of particular importance for the study of accessibility
percolation on trees.

the influx and the cumulative uptake of nutrient by roots. The physical models
studied are the fixed boundary model (Barber and Cushman 1981) and an improved
version of our moving boundary model (Reginato et al. 2000). A weight averaged
expression to compute influx on root surface and a generalized formula to
estimate the cumulative nutrient uptake are used. The moving boundary model
problem is solved by the adaptive finite element method. For comparison of
simulations of influx and cumulative uptake versus observed results six set of
data extracted from literature are used. For ions without limitations of
availability fixed and moving boundary models produces similar results with
small errors. Instead, to low concentrations, the fixed boundary model over
predicts while the moving boundary model always produces better results mainly
for K. For the P uptake the moving boundary model produces better results only
when the concentrations are very low and their predictions are comparable to
the obtained by a 3D-architectural model. The obtained improvements would
explain any failures of previous models for ions of low availability.
Therefore, our model could be a simpler alternative due to its low
computational burden.

Networks can represent any set of objects that have relations among themselves.
Communities are sets of nodes that are related in an important way, probably
sharing common properties and/or playing similar roles within a network. When
network analysis is applied to study the livestock movement patterns, the
epidemiological units of interest (farm premises, counties, states, countries,
etc.) are represented as nodes, and animal movements between the nodes are
represented as the edges of a network. Unraveling a network structure, and
hence the trade preferences and pathways, could be very useful to a researcher
or a decision-maker. We implemented a community detection algorithm to find
livestock communities that is consistent with the definition of a livestock
production zone, assuming that a community is a group of farm premises in which
an animal is more likely to stay during its life time than expected by chance.
We applied this algorithm to the network of within animal movements made inside
the State of Mato Grosso, for the year of 2007. This database holds information
about 87,899 premises and 521,431 movements throughout the year, totalizing
15,844,779 animals moved. The community detection algorithm achieved a network
partition that shows a clear geographical and commercial pattern, two crucial
features to preventive veterinary medicine applications, and also has a
meaningful interpretation in trade networks where links emerge from the choice
of trader nodes.

  unselected, retrospective study</title><categories>q-bio.QM</categories><msc-class>62-07</msc-class><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Objectives: In the United States, 25% of people with type 2 diabetes are
undiagnosed. Conventional screening models use limited demographic information
to assess risk. We evaluated whether electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping
could improve diabetes screening, even when records are incomplete and data are
not recorded systematically across patients and practice locations. Methods: In
this cross-sectional, retrospective study, data from 9,948 US patients between
2009 and 2012 were used to develop a pre-screening tool to predict current type
2 diabetes, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared (1) a full EHR
model containing prescribed medications, diagnoses, and traditional predictive
information, (2) a restricted EHR model where medication information was
removed, and (3) a conventional model containing only traditional predictive
information (BMI, age, gender, hypertensive and smoking status). We
additionally used a random-forests classification model to judge whether
including additional EHR information could increase the ability to detect
patients with Type 2 diabetes on new patient samples. Results: Using a
patient's full or restricted EHR to detect diabetes was superior to using basic
covariates alone (p&lt;0.001). The random forests model replicated on out-of-bag
data. Migraines and cardiac dysrhythmias were negatively associated with type 2
diabetes, while acute bronchitis and herpes zoster were positively associated,
among other factors. Conclusions: EHR phenotyping resulted in markedly superior
detection of type 2 diabetes in a general US population, could increase the
efficiency and accuracy of disease screening, and are capable of picking up
signals in real-world records.

Both the SNPs induced significant reduction in fungal growth and spore
formation, and also introduced marked deformities on the surface of
conidiophores at their sub-inhibitory concentrations. A genome wide
transcriptome profile then revealed manifold reduction in the expression of
GSH-GSSG transcripts among SNPs treated fungal isolates, which is unusual for
the micron sized elemental sulfur but probably effective in terms of antifungal
efficacy.

populations distributed over entire brains is a longstanding goal of
neuroscience. We developed a real-time volumetric and multispectral
optoacoustic tomography platform for imaging of neural activation deep in
scattering brains. The system can record 100 volumetric frames per second
across a 200mm3 field of view and spatial resolutions below 70um. Experiments
performed in immobilized and freely swimming larvae and in adult zebrafish
brains demonstrate, for the first time, the fundamental ability to
optoacoustically track neural calcium dynamics in animals labeled with
genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G, while overcoming the
longstanding penetration barrier of optical imaging in scattering brains. The
newly developed platform offers unprecedented capabilities for functional
whole-brain observations of fast calcium dynamics; in combination with
optoacoustics' well-established capacity in resolving vascular hemodynamics, it
could open new vistas in the study of neural activity and neurovascular
coupling in health and disease.

evolution and bioengineering. Given desired fluxes, necessary enzyme levels can
be estimated based on known rate laws and on a principle of minimal enzyme
cost. With logarithmic metabolite levels as free variables, enzyme cost
functions and constraints in optimality and sampling problems can be handled
easily. The set of feasible metabolite profiles forms a polytope in
log-concentration space, whose points represent all possible steady states of a
kinetic model. We show that enzyme cost is a convex function on this polytope.
This makes enzyme cost minimization - finding optimal enzyme profiles and
corresponding metabolite profiles that realize a desired flux at a minimal cost
- a convex optimization problem.

stabilization strategies used by proteins are still enigmatic. Studies on
recombinant xylanase which has the ubiquitous (\b{eta}/{\alpha})8 TIM
(Triosephosphate isomerase) barrel fold showed that, just a single extreme
N-terminus mutation (V1L) markedly enhanced the thermostability by 5 {\deg}C
without loss of catalytic activity whereas another mutation, V1A at the same
position decreased the stability by 2 {\deg}C. Based on computational analysis
of their crystal structures including residue interaction network, we
established a link between N- to C-terminal contacts and protein stability. We
demonstrate that augmenting of N- to C-terminal non-covalent interactions is
associated with the enhancement of protein stability. We propose that the
strategy of mutations at the termini could be exploited with a view to modulate
stability without compromising on enzymatic activity, or in general, protein
function, in diverse folds where N- and C-termini are in close proximity.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the development of
therapeutics involving proteins and for designing effective protein engineering
strategies.

occur in various natural settings. The overall macroscopic mechanical response
of such a composite network depends on the coupling between the active and the
passive properties of the underlying constituents and nonlocal interactions
between different parts of the composite. In a simple one dimensional system,
using a mean field model, it has been shown that the combination of motor
activity and finite filament extensibility yields a persistence length scale
over which strain decays. Here we study a similar system, in the complementary
limit of strong noise and moderate extensibility, using Brownian multi-particle
collision dynamics-based numerical simulations that includes the coupling
between motor kinetics and local filament extensibility. While the numerical
model shows deviations from the mean field predictions due to the presence of
strong active noise caused by the variations in individual motor activity,
several qualitative features are still retained. Specifically, for fixed motor
attachment and detachment rates, the decay is length is set by the ratio of the
passive elasticity to the active shear resistance generated by attached motors.
Our study generalizes the notion of persistence in passive thermal systems to
actively driven systems with testable predictions.

by molecular motors occur in various natural settings, such as the ordered
eukaryotic flagellum, and the disordered cytoskeleton. The deformation of these
composite systems is driven by active motor forces and resisted by passive
filament elasticity, and structural constraints due to permanent cross-links.
Using a mean field theory for a one-dimensional ordered system, we show that
the combination of motor activity and finite filament extensibility yields a
characteristic persistence length scale over which active strain decays. This
decay length is set by the ability of motors to respond to combination of the

tractable approximations to the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). We present
a Markov process describing coalescence at two fixed points along a pair of
sequences evolving under the SMC'. Using our Markov process, we derive a number
of new quantities related to the pairwise SMC', thereby analytically
quantifying for the first time the similarity between the SMC' and ARG. We use
our process to show that the joint distribution of pairwise coalescence times
at recombination sites under the SMC' is the same as it is marginally under the
ARG, which demonstrates that the SMC' is, in a particular well-defined,
intuitive sense, the most appropriate first-order sequentially Markov
approximation to the ARG. Finally, we use these results to show that population
size estimates under the pairwise SMC are asymptotically biased, while under
the pairwise SMC' they are approximately asymptotically unbiased.

to be sensitive to extremely small concentration changes of signaling
molecules. The accuracy of such molecular signaling is ultimately limited by
the counting noise imposed by the thermal diffusion of molecules. Many
macromolecules and organelles transiently bind to molecular motors and are then
actively transported. We here show that a random albeit directed delivery of
signaling molecules to within a typical diffusion distance to the receptor
reduces the correlation time of the counting noise, effecting an improved
sensing precision. The conditions for this active focusing are indeed
compatible with observations in living cells. Our results are relevant for a
better understanding of molecular cellular signaling and the design of novel
diagnostic devices.

probabilities, noise correlations and read-out weights in the classical
feedforward decision-making framework (Haefner et al. 2013). The derivation
assumed that behavioral reports are distributed evenly between the two possible
choices. This assumption is often violated in empirical data - especially when
computing so-called grand CPs combining data across stimulus conditions. Here,
we extend our analytical results to situations when subjects show clear biases
towards one choice over the other, e.g. in non-zero signal conditions.
Importantly, this also extends our results from discrimination tasks to
detection tasks and detect probabilities for which much empirical data is
available. We find that CPs and DPs depend monotonously on the fraction, p, of
choices assigned to the more likely option: CPs and DPs are smallest for p
equal to 0.5 and increase as p increases, i.e. as the data deviates from the
ideal, zero-signal, unbiased scenario. While this deviation is small, our
results suggest a) an empirical test for the feedforward framework and b) a way
in which to correct choice probability and detect probability measurements
before combining different stimulus conditions to increase signal/noise.

for predictive anticipatory activity (PAA) or presentiment (for first response,
see: Schwarzkopf 2014a; for additional response, see: Schwarzkopf 2014b, for

laudable effort to promote collegial discussion of the controversial claim of
presentiment, whereby physiological measures preceding unpredictable emotional
events differ from physiological measures preceding calm or neutral events
(Mossbridge et al., 2012; Mossbridge et al., 2014). What is called truth at any
given time in science has achieved that status through a continuous process of
measurement and interpretation based on the current knowledge at hand. Here we
address six points in his original commentary (Schwarzkopf 2014a), though our
responses are informed by the points he made in his his supplementary
commentary (Schwarzkopf 2014b). We hope our responses will help Schwarzkopf and
others understand our interpretation of these data.

Mathematical
biologists have several commonly-used models for RNA: words in a fixed alphabet
(representing the primary sequence of nucleotides) and plane trees
(representing the secondary structure, or folding of the RNA sequence). This
paper considers an augmented version of the standard model of plane trees, one
that incorporates some observed constraints on how the folding can occur. In
particular we assume the alphabet consists of complementary pairs, for instance
the Watson-Crick pairs A-U and C-G of RNA.
  Given a word in the alphabet, a valid plane tree is a tree for which, when
the word is folded around the tree, each edge matchs two complementary letters.
Consider the graph whose vertices are valid plane trees for a fixed word and
whose edges are given by Condon, Heitsch, and Hoos's local moves. We prove this
graph is connected.
  We give an explicit algorithm to construct a valid plane tree from a primary
sequence, assuming that at least one valid plane tree exists. The tree produced
by our algorithm has other useful characterizations, including a uniqueness
condition defined by local moves. We also study enumerative properties of valid
plane trees, analyzing how the number of valid plane trees depends on the
choice of sequence length and alphabet size. Finally we show that words with at
least one valid plane tree are unusual, in the sense that the proportion of
words with at least one valid plane tree goes to zero as the word size
increases. Open questions and conjectures are given throughout the document.

apoptosis, and we presume some of them may also protect the cell from oxidative
stress. We found that the absence of yeast caspase 1(Yca1)in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae leads to a more intense burst of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) In addition, compared to wild type yeast cells, the ability of
yca1 mutant cells to maintain mitochondrial activity is significantly reduced
after either oxidative stress treatment or aging. During mitochondrial ROS
burst, deletion of the yca1 gene delayed structural damage of a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter bound in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
This work implies that yeast caspase 1 is closely connected to the oxidative
stress response. We speculate that Yca1 can discriminate proteins damaged by
oxidation and accelerate their hydrolysis to attenuate the ROS burst.

  Methods for Studying Protein Folding&quot; edited by Robert Best</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In recent years single molecule force spectroscopy has opened a new avenue to
provide profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. In this
field, quantitative analyses of the data employing sound theoretical models,
have played a major role in interpreting data and anticipating outcomes of
experiments. Here, we explain how by using temperature as a variable in
mechanical unfolding of biomolecules in force spectroscopy, the roughness of
the energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about the
underlying reaction coordinate. Estimates of other aspects of the energy
landscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations
could depend on the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We
illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location
from loading rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition
state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied, which is reminiscent of
the Hammond effect, it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data.
The independence of the TS location on force holds good only for brittle or
hard biomolecules whereas the TS location changes considerably if the molecule
is soft or plastic. Finally, we discuss the goodness of the end-to-end distance
(or pulling) coordinate of the molecule as a surrogate reaction coordinate in a
situation like force-induced ligand-unbinding from a gated molecular receptor
as well as force-quench refolding of an RNA hairpin.

immune system develops pathogen-specific immunity. Induced immunity decays in
time and years after recovery/vaccination the host might become susceptible
again. Exposure to the pathogen in the environment boosts the immune system
thus prolonging the duration of the protection. Such an interplay of within
host and population level dynamics poses significant challenges in rigorous
mathematical modeling of immuno-epidemiology. The aim of this paper is twofold.
First, we provide an overview of existing models for waning of
disease/vaccine-induced immunity and immune system boosting. Then a new
modeling approach is proposed for SIRVS dynamics, monitoring the immune status
of individuals and including both waning immunity and immune system boosting.
We show that some previous models can be considered as special cases or
approximations of our framework.

  Data</title><categories>q-bio.QM cs.CE cs.DS</categories><comments>PhD dissertation, May 2014, Purdue University</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Flow cytometry (FC) is a single-cell profiling platform for measuring the
phenotypes of individual cells from millions of cells in biological samples. FC
employs high-throughput technologies and generates high-dimensional data, and
hence algorithms for analyzing the data represent a bottleneck. This
dissertation addresses several computational challenges arising in modern
cytometry while mining information from high-dimensional and high-content
biological data. A collection of combinatorial and statistical algorithms for
locating, matching, prototyping, and classifying cellular populations from
multi-parametric FC data is developed.
  The algorithmic pipeline, flowMatch, developed in this dissertation consists
of five well-defined algorithmic modules to (1) transform data to stabilize
within-population variance, (2) identify cell populations by robust clustering
algorithms, (3) register cell populations across samples, (4) encapsulate a
class of samples with templates, and (5) classify samples based on their
similarity with the templates. Components of flowMatch can work independently
or collaborate with each other to perform the complete data analysis. flowMatch
is made available as an open-source R package in Bioconductor.
  We have employed flowMatch for classifying leukemia samples, evaluating the
phosphorylation effects on T cells, classifying healthy immune profiles, and
classifying the vaccination status of HIV patients. In these analyses, the
pipeline is able to reach biologically meaningful conclusions quickly and
efficiently with the automated algorithms. The algorithms included in flowMatch
can also be applied to problems outside of flow cytometry such as in microarray
data analysis and image recognition. Therefore, this dissertation contributes
to the solution of fundamental problems in computational cytometry and related
domains.

size from 10 to over 80 pg. The urodela are divided into ten extant families
each with a characteristic range in genome size. Although changes in genome
size often occur randomly and in the absence of selection pressure, non-random
patterns of genome size variation are evident among specific vertebrate
lineages. Here we report that genome size in salamander families varies
inversely with species richness and other ecological factors: clades that began
radiating earlier (older crown age) tend to have smaller genomes, higher levels
of diversity and larger geographical ranges. These observations support the
hypothesis that urodel families with larger genomes either have a lower
propensity to diversify or are more vulnerable to extinction than families with
smaller genomes.

diode-laser bar optical stretchers. We employ a recently developed
computational model, the Dynamic Ray-Tracing method, to determine the stress
distribution induced by the applied optical forces on a capsule encapsulating a
nucleus of different optical properties. These forces are shape dependent and
can deform real non-rigid objects; thus resulting in a dynamically changing
optical stress distribution with cell and nucleus deformation. Chinese hamster
ovary cell is a common biological cell that is of interest to the biomedical
community because of their use in recombinant protein therapeutics and is an
example of a nucleated cell. To this end, we model chinese hamster ovary cells
as two three-dimensional elastic capsules of variable inner capsule size
immersed in a fluid where the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using the
Immersed Boundary Method. Our results show that the presence of a nucleus has a
major effect on the force distribution on the cell surface and the net
deformation. Scattering and gradient forces are reported for different nucleus
sizes and the effect of nucleus size on the cell deformation is discussed.

topic in molecular biochemistry. Structure plays a critical role in defining
the function of proteins and is more strongly conserved than amino acid
sequence over evolutionary timescales. A key challenge is the identification
and evaluation of structural similarity between proteins; such analysis can aid
in understanding the role of newly discovered proteins and help elucidate
evolutionary relationships between organisms. Computational biologists have
developed many clever algorithmic techniques for comparing protein structures,
however, all are based on heuristic optimization criteria, making statistical
interpretation somewhat difficult. Here we present a fully probabilistic
framework for pairwise structural alignment of proteins. Our approach has
several advantages, including the ability to capture alignment uncertainty and
to estimate key &quot;gap&quot; parameters which critically affect the quality of the
alignment. We show that several existing alignment methods arise as maximum a
posteriori estimates under specific choices of prior distributions and error
models. Our probabilistic framework is also easily extended to incorporate
additional information, which we demonstrate by including primary sequence
information to generate simultaneous sequence-structure alignments that can
resolve ambiguities obtained using structure alone. This combined model also
provides a natural approach for the difficult task of estimating evolutionary
distance based on structural alignments. The model is illustrated by comparison
with well-established methods on several challenging protein alignment
examples.

characterized by interactions yielding subjective fitness, but aiming at
solutions that are superior with respect to an objective measurement. Such an
approximation of objective fitness may be, for instance, generalization
performance. In the paper a link between rating-- and ranking--based measures
of intransitivity and fitness landscapes that can address the dichotomy between
subjective and objective fitness is explored. The approach is illustrated by
numerical experiments involving a simple random game with continuously tunable
degree of randomness.

systems. As an example, we consider a lattice of nuclei responding to a
concentration field of a transcriptional regulator (the &quot;input&quot;) by expressing
a single diffusible target gene. When input concentrations are low, diffusive
coupling markedly improves information transmission; optimal gene activation
functions also systematically change. A qualitatively new regulatory strategy
emerges where individual cells respond to the input in a nearly step-like
fashion that is subsequently averaged out by strong diffusion. While motivated
by early patterning events in the Drosophila embryo, our framework is
generically applicable to spatially coupled stochastic gene expression models.

  the Siegert Formula</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  When stimulated by a very large number of Poisson-like presynaptic current
input spikes, the temporal dynamics of the soma membrane potential $V(t)$ of a
leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is typically modeled in the diffusion
limit and treated as a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP). When the potential
reaches a threshold value $\theta$, $V(t) = \theta$, the LIF neuron fires and
the membrane potential is reset to a resting value, $V_0 &lt; \theta$, and clamped
to this value for a specified (non-stochastic) absolute refractory period $T_r
\ge 0$, after which the cycle is repeated. The time between firings is given by
the random variable $T_f = T_r+ T$ where $T$ is the random time which elapses
between the &quot;unpinning&quot; of the membrane potential clamp and the next,
subsequent firing of the neuron. The mean time-to-fire, $\widehat{T}_f =
\text{E}(T_f) = T_r + \text{E}(T) = T_r + \widehat{T}$, provides a measure
$\rho$ of the average firing rate of the neuron, \[ \rho = \widehat{T}_f^{-1} =
\frac{1}{T_r + \widehat{T}} . \] This note briefly discusses some aspects of
the OUP model and derives the Siegert formula giving the firing rate, $\rho =
\rho(I_0)$ as a function of an injected current, $I_0$. This is a well-known
classical result and no claim to originality is made. The derivation of the
firing rate given in this report, which closely follows the derivation outlined
in the textbook by Gardiner, minimizes the required mathematical background and
is done in some pedagogic detail to facilitate study by graduate students and
others who are new to the subject. Knowledge of the material presented in the
first five chapters of Gardiner should provide an adequate background for
following the derivation given in this note.

oscillator. We evaluate the regulatory function of a promoter with multiple
binding sites in the absence of cooperative binding, and consider different
hypotheses for how the number of bound repressors affects transcription rate.
Effective Hill exponents of the resulting regulatory functions reveal an
increase in the nonlinearity of the feedback with the number of binding sites.
We identify optimal configurations that maximize the nonlinearity of the
feedback. We use a generic model of a biochemical oscillator to show that this
increased nonlinearity is reflected in enhanced oscillations, with larger
amplitudes over wider oscillatory ranges. Although the study is motivated by
genetic oscillations in the zebrafish segmentation clock, our findings may
reveal a general principle for gene regulation.

is modeled by a stochastic switched differential equation based on the so
called $N$-intertwined model for disease spread over static networks. Assuming
that all the edges of the network are independently switched, we present
sufficient conditions for the convergence of infection probability to zero.
Though the stability theory for switched linear systems can naively derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence, the condition cannot be
used for large-scale networks because, for a network with $n$ agents, it
requires computing the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix of size exponential
in $n$. On the other hand, our conditions that are based also on the spectral
theory of random matrices can be checked by computing the maximum real
eigenvalue of a matrix of size exactly $n$.

Institute in order to characterize the genomes of hundreds of tumors of various
cancer types. While much effort has been put into detecting somatic genomic
variation in these data, somatic structural variation induced by the activity
of transposable element insertions has not been reported. Transposable elements
(TEs) are particularly relevant in cancer in part because of several known
cases in which a TE insertion is directly linked to cancer formation and
studies linking the epigenetic status of retrotransposons to carcinogenesis and
patient outcome. Additionally, evidence for somatic retrotransposition in
eukaryotic genomes suggests that some tissues and therefore some cancer types
may be disposed to increased retrotransposition. We built upon previous work to
develop a highly efficient computational pipeline for the detection of
non-reference mobile ele- ment insertions from high-throughput paired-end whole
genome sequencing data that is capable of detecting breakpoints through a local
assembly strategy. Using this, we analyzed 33 whole genome tumor datasets with
paired normal samples from TCGA across 3 different cancer types: glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) and colorectal ade-
nocarcinoma (COAD). We detected 72 insertions in colon samples, almost all of
them LINE-1 elements, and none in GBM or OV. The amount of somatic
retrotransposition varies widely between samples with 61 insertions present in
one case. The lack of somatic retrotransposon insertions in GBM and OV samples
suggests that TE activity in cancer is restricted to certain cancer types.

microscopy as a complex data source for the most of the system biology
branches, including the most perspective non-local approaches known as
&quot;localomics&quot; and &quot;dynamomics&quot;. A brief summary of various cryoelectron
mi-croscopy methods and corresponding system biological ap-proaches is given in
the text. The above classification can be considered as a useful framework for
the primary comprehen-sions about cryoelectron microscopy aims and instrumental
tools. We do not discuss any of these concepts in details, but merely point out
that their methodological complexity follows only from the structure-functional
complexity of biological systems which are investigated in this manner. We also
postu-late that one can employ some of the cryoelectron microscopic techniques
not only for observation, but also for modification and structural
refunctionalization of some biological and similar soft matter objects and
microscopic samples. In other worlds, we start with the cryoelectron microscopy
as a tool for the sys-tem biology and progress to its applying as an instrument
for system biology and functional biomimetics; i.e. &quot;system cryobi-ology&quot; goes
over into &quot;synthetic cryobiology&quot; or &quot;cryogenic biomimetics&quot;. All these
conclusions can be deduced from the most recent works of the latest years,
including just submitted foreign papers. This article provides an up-to-date
description of the conceptual basis for the novel view on the computational
cryoelectron microscopy (in silico) approaches and the data mining principles
which lie at the very foundation of modern structural analysis and
reconstruction.

individually considered, discrete, predefined representations but on a
contextually-elicited amalgam of items which exist in a state of potentiality
and may not be readily separable. This leads to the prediction that analogy
making proceeds not by mapping correspondences from candidate sources to
target, as predicted by the structure mapping theory of analogy, but by weeding
out non-correspondences, thereby whittling away at potentiality. Participants
were given an analogy problem, interrupted before they had time to solve it,
and asked to write down what they had by way of a solution. Na\&quot;ive judges
categorized responses as significantly more supportive of the predictions of
honing theory than those of structure mapping.

simultaneously has become routine in biomedical research during the past
decade. A tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in
the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect
differentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased
statistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed
$p$-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which
Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw
data and $p$-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies
that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a
certain $p$-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with $p$-value${}&lt;0.001$) are
reported in journal publications. The truncated $p$-value information makes the
aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to
apply a less efficient vote counting method or na\&quot;{i}vely drop the studies
with incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective
meta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored $p$-values.
We developed and compared three imputation methods - mean imputation, single
random imputation and multiple imputation - for a general class of evidence
aggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special
examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and
subsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established.
Simulations were performed to investigate the type I error, power and the
control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data.
The proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal
cancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder
(MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing
na\&quot;{i}ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed
the best and are recommended for future applications.

and found a correlation of 0.8 between the logarithms of the incidence of
cancer (LCI), and the estimated number of stem cell divisions in those tissues
(LSCD). Some of their conclusions however are statistically erroneous. Their
excess risk score, &quot;ERS&quot; (log10 LCI x log10 LSCD), is non-monotonic under a
change of time units for the rates, which renders meaningless the results
derived from it, including a cluster of 22 &quot;R-tumor&quot; types for which they
conclude, &quot;primary prevention measures are not likely to be very effective&quot;.
Further, r = 0.8 is consistent with the three orders of magnitude variation in
other unmeasured factors, leaving room for the possibility of primary
prevention if such factors can be intervened upon. Further exploration of the
data reveals additional findings: (1) that LCI grows at approximately the
square root of LSCD, which may provide a clue to the biology; (2) among
different possible combinations of the primary data, the one maximizing the
correlations with LCI is almost precisely the formula used by Tomasetti and
Vogelstein to estimate LSCD, giving support to stem cell divisions as an
independent factor in carcinogenesis, while not excluding other such factors.

electroencephalographic (EEG) data has gained considerable attention over the
last few years. In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization
method for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better
specify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the
proposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside
human brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with
imposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain
activity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a
realistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head
and includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity
values. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly
improves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed
method was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of &gt;75%) locate up to 6
simultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,
the accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was &lt;75%.
Conclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method
is potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human
brain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.

novel algorithms for RNA secondary structure kinetics. Using the fast Fourier
transform to e?ciently compute the Boltzmann probability that a secondary
structure S of a given RNA sequence has base pair distance x [resp. y] from
reference structure A [resp. B], Hermes computes the exact kinetics of folding
from A to B in this coarse-grained model. In particular, Hermes computes the
mean ?rst passage time from the transition probability matrix by using matrix
inversion, and also computes the equilibrium time from the rate matrix by using
spectral decomposition. Due to the model granularity and the speed of Hermes,
it is capable of determining secondary structure refolding kinetics for large
RNA sequences, beyond the range of other methods. Comparative benchmarking of

  Biology http://mlcb.org</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Determining the 3D structures of biological molecules is a key problem for
both biology and medicine. Electron Cryomicroscopy (Cryo-EM) is a promising
technique for structure estimation which relies heavily on computational
methods to reconstruct 3D structures from 2D images. This paper introduces the
challenging Cryo-EM density estimation problem as a novel application for
stochastic optimization techniques. Structure discovery is formulated as MAP
estimation in a probabilistic latent-variable model, resulting in an
optimization problem to which an array of seven stochastic optimization methods
are applied. The methods are tested on both real and synthetic data, with some
methods recovering reasonable structures in less than one epoch from a random
initialization. Complex quasi-Newton methods are found to converge more slowly
than simple gradient-based methods, but all stochastic methods are found to
converge to similar optima. This method represents a major improvement over
existing methods as it is significantly faster and is able to converge from a
random initialization.

  Epistemology</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>23 pages, 5 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Darwin claims in the {\em Origin} that similarity is evidence for common
ancestry, but that adaptive similarities are &quot;almost valueless&quot; as evidence.
This claim seems reasonable for some adaptive similarities but not for others.
Here we clarify and evaluate these and related matters by using the law of
likelihood as an analytic tool and by considering mathematical models of three
evolutionary processes -- directional selection, stabilizing selection, and
drift. Our results apply both to Darwin's theory of evolution and to modern
evolutionary biology.

  activity</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><comments>20 page main text with figures in-line; 5 page supplement</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Task difficulty is widely cited in current theory regarding cognitive control
and fronto-parietal function. Ongoing debate surrounds the extent to which
global difficulty across multiple cognitive demands is the main driver of
lateral frontal activity. Here, we examine a commonly cited behavioral marker
of difficulty in these accounts: time-on-task (ToT), as assessed by response
time. Specifically, we investigate the task-dependent scaling of frontal BOLD
responses with ToT during hierarchical cognitive control. We observe a
paradoxical relationship, whereby rostral regions show greater scaling with ToT
on a first-order task, despite showing greater recruitment on a second-order
task; caudal regions show the converse relationships. Together, these results
demonstrate that ToT does not reflect a single dimension of difficulty that
uniformly drives lateral frontal activity. Rather, this discrepancy in the mean
and scaling of BOLD requires that multiple, distinct processes are instantiated
across these fronto-parietal regions in the service of cognitive control
function.

syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.1-4 Some types of strabismus is
heritable (e.g. infantile esotropia syndrome), particularly the ones associated
with multisystem disorders, e.g. Moebius syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome,
craniofacial dysostoses, and mitochondrial myopathies.5 Due to the complexities
that a case of strabismus may pertain to, it is worthwhile to get to know more
about the strabismic syndromes and syndromic strabismus. This brief review -as
its name implied- does not attempt to cover every angle of the syndromic

model to compare and make qualitative predictions on the rheology of mucus of
healthy individuals (Wild Type) versus those infected with Cystic Fibrosis. The
mixture theory consists of the mucus (polymer phase) and water (solvent phase)
as well as several different ions: H+, Na+ and Ca++. The model is linearized to
study the hydration of spherically symmetric mucus gels and calibrated against
the experimental data of mucus diffusivities. Near equilibrium, the linearized
form of the equation describing the radial size of the gel, reduces to the
well-known expression used in the kinetic theory of swelling hydrogels.
Numerical studies reveal that the Donnan potential is the dominating mechanism
driving the mucus swelling/deswelling transition. However, the altered swelling
kinetics of the Cystic Fibrosis infected mucus is not merely governed by the
hydroelectric composition of the swelling media, but also due to the altered
movement of electrolytes as well as due to the defective properties of the
mucin polymer network.

Macular degeneration (MD) causes central visual field loss.
When field defects occur in both eyes and overlap, parts of the visual pathways
are no longer stimulated. Previous reports have shown that this affects the
grey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding
visual pathway structures have not been fully established. Method. In this
multicentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance
imaging and voxel-based morphometry to investigate the visual pathway
structures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD). Results. Compared
to age-matched healthy controls, in patients with JMD we found volumetric
reductions in the optic nerves, the chiasm, the lateral geniculate bodies, the
optic radiations and the visual cortex. In patients with AMD we found
volumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations
and the visual cortex. An unexpected finding was that AMD, but not JMD, was
associated with a reduction in frontal white matter volume. Conclusion. MD is
associated with degeneration of structures along the visual pathways. A
reduction in frontal white matter volume only present in the AMD patients may
constitute a neural correlate of previously reported association between AMD
and mild cognitive impairment.

understanding many socio-economic phenomena. Here we present a dynamical
systems view of the equilibria of two-person, payoff-symmetric games. In
particular, using this perspective, we discuss the differences between two
solution concepts for such games - namely, those of Nash equilibrium and
co-action equilibrium. For the Nash equilibrium, we show that the dynamical
view can provide an equilibrium refinement, selecting one equilibrium among
several possibilities, thereby solving the issue of multiple equilibria that
appear in some games. We illustrate in detail this dynamical perspective by
considering three well known 2-person games namely the Prisoner's Dilemma, game
of Chicken and the Stag-Hunt. We find that in all of these cases, co-action
equilibria tends to correspond to `nicer' strategies than those corresponding
to Nash equilibria.

Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the
environment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on
ecosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to
unify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from
available habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed
movement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization
distribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are
easily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability
density at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that
position. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch
of the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that
patch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this
non-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement
processes, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat
where the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give
statistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and
demonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in
Newfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the
model have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of
the local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat
are used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,
whereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4. Whilst we focus on
habitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any
environmental covariates and therefore represents a unification of mechanistic
modelling and step selection approaches to understanding animal space use.

resources, can report excessive false positives (type I errors), may miss
organisms (type II errors / false negatives), or scale poorly on large
datasets. This paper explores using big data database technologies to
characterize very large metagenomic DNA sequences in protein space, with the
ultimate goal of rapid pathogen identification in patient samples. Our approach
uses the abilities of a big data databases to hold large sparse associative
array representations of genetic data to extract statistical patterns about the
data that can be used in a variety of ways to improve identification
algorithms.

populated neuron activities with long-ranged interactions, $V(r)\sim r^{-n}$
associated with short-ranged interaction. We present the results from
comprehensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the nonconserved Ising model
with $n\ge 2$. Our results of long-ranged neuron kinetics are consistent with
the same dynamical behavior of short-ranged case ($n &gt; 4$). The calculated
characteristic length scale in long-ranged interaction is found to be $n$
dependent ($L(t)\sim t^{1/(n-2)}$), whereas short-ranged interaction follows
$L(t)\sim t^{1/2}$ law and approximately preserve universality in domain
kinetics. Further, we did the comparative study of phase ordering near the
critical temperature which follows different behaviours of domain ordering near
and far critical temperature but follows universal scaling law.

efficiently determine whether or not it contains a `self-sustaining and
collectively autocatalytic' subset of reactions, and to find such subsets when
they exist. However, for systems that are potentially open-ended (for example,
when no prescribed upper bound is placed on the complexity or size/length of
molecules types), the theory developed for the finite case breaks down. We
investigate a number of subtleties that arise in such systems that are absent
in the finite setting, and present several new results.

complementing recent partial directed coherence (PDC) results
\cite{Baccala2013}. Based on these results and numerical examples we argue for
a new directed `link' centered neural connectivity framework to replace the
widespread correlation based effective/functional network concepts so that
directed network influences between structures become classified as to whether
links are \textit{active} in a \textit{direct} or in an \textit{indirect} way
thereby leading to the new notions of \textit{Granger connectivity} and
\textit{Granger influenciability} which are more descriptive than speaking of
Granger causality alone.

  prisoners</title><categories>q-bio.OT</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) has been proposed as a marker for
depressive symptoms and other aspects of mental health. However, the real
correlation between them is presently uncertain, as previous studies have
generally been conducted on the basis of small samples. In a sample of 113
adult male prisoners, we analyzed correlations between five measures of HR/HRV
and five psychological measures of mental health aspects (depression, state and
trait anxiety, and social relationships). We used Nadaraya-Watson
non-parametric regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman
correlation to detect possible relations. Despite strong correlations among
HR/HRV measures and among psychological measures, correlations between HR/HRV
and psychological measures were low and non-significant for the overall sample.
However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some correlations in younger
people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52; both p &lt;
.005). Overall, the general utility of HR/HRV as a marker for mental health
across populations remains unclear. Future research should address age and
other potential confounders more consistently.

threat to life on Earth, primarily through depletion of stratospheric ozone and
subsequent increase in surface-level solar ultraviolet radiation. Simulations
of the atmospheric effects of a variety of events (such as supernovae,
gamma-ray bursts, and solar proton events) have been previously published,
along with estimates of biological damage at Earth's surface. In this work, we
employed the TUV radiative transfer model to expand and improve calculations of
surface-level irradiance and biological impacts following an ionizing radiation
event. We considered changes in surface-level UVB, UVA, and photosynthetically
active radiation (visible light) for clear-sky conditions and fixed aerosol
parameter values. We also considered a wide range of biological effects on
organisms ranging from humans to phytoplankton. We found that past work
overestimated UVB irradiance, but that relative estimates for increase in
exposure to DNA damaging radiation are still similar to our improved
calculations. We also found that the intensity of biologically damaging
radiation varies widely with organism and specific impact considered; these
results have implications for biosphere-level damage following astrophysical
ionizing radiation events. When considering changes in surface-level visible
light irradiance, we found that, contrary to previous assumptions, a decrease
in irradiance is only present for a short time in very limited geographical
areas; instead we found a net increase for most of the modeled time-space
region. This result has implications for proposed climate changes associated
with ionizing radiation events.

correspondences among neurons. The approach enables alignment of data from
distinct multiunit studies of nervous systems. We show that the methods for
inferring correspondences combine data effectively from cross-animal studies to
make joint inferences about behavioral decision making that are not possible
with the data from a single animal. We focus on data collection, machine
learning, and prediction in the representative and long-studied invertebrate
nervous system of the European medicinal leech. Acknowledging the computational
intractability of the general problem of identifying correspondences among
neurons, we introduce efficient computational procedures for matching neurons
across animals. The methods include techniques that adjust for missing cells or
additional cells in the different data sets that may reflect biological or
experimental variation. The methods highlight the value harnessing inference
and learning in new kinds of computational microscopes for multiunit
neurobiological studies.

  neural network</title><categories>stat.AP math.NA q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  One major challenge in neuroscience is the identification of interrelations
between signals reflecting neural activity and how information processing
occurs in the neural circuits. At the cellular and molecular level, mechanisms
of signal transduction have been studied intensively and a better knowledge and
understanding of some basic processes of information handling by neurons has
been achieved. In contrast, little is known about the organization and function
of complex neuronal networks. Experimental methods are now available to
simultaneously monitor electrical activity of a large number of neurons in real
time. Then, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spiking activity
of individual neurons is a very valuable tool for the study of the dynamics and
architecture of the neural networks. Such activity is not due to the sole
intrinsic properties of the individual neural cells but it is mostly
consequence of the direct influence of other neurons. The deduction of the
effective connectivity between neurons, whose experimental spike trains are
observed, is of crucial importance in neuroscience: first for the correct
interpretation of the electrophysiological activity of the involved neurons and
neural networks, and, for correctly relating the electrophysiological activity
to the functional tasks accomplished by the network. In this work we propose a
novel method for the identification of connectivity of neural networks using
recorded voltages. Our approach is based on the assumptions that the network
has a topology with sparse connection. After a brief description of our method
we will show some numerical results with some data obtained from numerical
simulations.

depicting flux distributions on networks in the steady state of an open flow
system. Energetic food webs, economic input-output networks, and international
trade networks, are open flow network models of energy flows between species,
money or value flows between industrial sectors, and goods flows between
countries, respectively. Flow distances (first-passage or total) between any
given two nodes $i$ and $j$ are defined as the average number of transition
steps of a random walker along the network from $i$ to $j$ under some
conditions. They apparently deviate from the conventional random walk distance
on a closed directed graph because they consider the openness of the flow
network. Flow distances are explicitly expressed by underlying Markov matrix of
a flow system in this paper. With this novel theoretical conception, we can
visualize open flow networks, calculating centrality of each node, and
clustering nodes into groups. We apply flow distances to two kinds of empirical
open flow networks, including energetic food webs and economic input-output
network. In energetic food webs example, we visualize the trophic level of each
species and compare flow distances with other distance metrics on graph. In
input-output network, we rank sectors according to their average distances away
other sectors, and cluster sectors into different groups. Some other potential
applications and mathematical properties are also discussed. To summarize, flow
distance is a useful and powerful tool to study open flow systems.

biological networks are able to provide new mechanistical insights into
biological functions. Currently, high-throughput data are usually visualized on
top of predefined network layouts which are not always adapted to a given data
analysis task. We developed a Cytoscape app which allows to construct
biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported
as values of nodes attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3.0 app which uses linear
and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network
layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL
implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as
continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one
network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. Combining
these possibilities facilitates creating insightful network layouts
representing both structural network features and the correlation patterns in
multivariate data. DeDaL is the first method allowing to construct biological
network layouts from high-throughput data. DeDaL is freely available for
downloading together with step-by-step tutorial at

  nucleus HVC in birdsong syntax</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Behavioral sequences of animals are often structured and can be described by
probabilistic rules (or &quot;action syntax&quot;). The patterns of vocal elements in
birdsong are a prime example. The encoding of such rules in neural circuits is
poorly understood. Here we locate the site of song syntax in the Bengalese
finch by rapidly and reversibly manipulating the temperature in the song
production pathway. Changing the temperature in the premotor nucleus HVC
(proper name) alters the transition probabilities between syllables. Most
prominently, cooling reduces the number of repetitions of long repeated
syllables, while heating increases repetition. In contrast, changing the
temperature of the downstream motor area RA (robust nucleus of the
acropallium), which is critical for singing, does not affect the song syntax.
Computational modeling suggests that temperature can alter the transition
probabilities by affecting the efficacy of the synapses in HVC that carry
auditory feedback to the motor circuits. The model is supported by a real-time
distorted auditory feedback experiment, which shows that perturbing auditory
feedback shortens syllable repeats similar to cooling HVC. Taken together,
these findings implicate HVC as a key player in determining birdsong syntax.

sustainable fisheries management, restoring depleted fisheries stocks and
maintaining ecosystems. However, even with total exclusion of fishing effort,
depleted stocks sometimes show little or no recovery over a long time period.
Here, using a mathematical model, we show that multiple stable states may hold
the key to understanding the tendency for fisheries stocks to recover because
of MPAs. We find that MPAs can have either a positive effect or almost no
effect on the recovery of depleted fishing stocks, depending on the fish
migration patterns and the fishing policies. MPAs also reinforce ecological
resilience, particularly for migratory species. In contrast to previous
reports, our results show that MPAs have small or sometimes negative effects on
the recovery of sedentary species. Unsuitable MPA planning might result in low
effectiveness or even deterioration of the existing condition.

reads with low error rates, emerging sequencing technologies generate long
reads with high error rates. A basic question of interest is the tradeoff
between read length and error rate in terms of the information needed for the
perfect assembly of the genome. Using an adversarial erasure error model, we
make progress on this problem by establishing a critical read length, as a
function of the genome and the error rate, above which perfect assembly is
guaranteed. For several real genomes, including those from the GAGE dataset, we
verify that this critical read length is not significantly greater than the
read length required for perfect assembly from reads without errors.

populations, but now there is a growing interest in the non-homogenous case.
One of the most important models has been proposed by Lieberman, Hauert and
Nowak, adapting to a weighted directed graph the classical process described by
Moran. The Markov chain associated with the graph can be modified by erasing
all non-trivial loops in its state space, obtaining the so-called Embedded
Markov chain (EMC). The fixation probability remains unchanged, but the
expected time to absorption (fixation or extinction) is reduced. In this paper,
we shall use this idea to compute asymptotically the average fixation
probability for complete bipartite graphs. To this end, we firstly review some
recent results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs trying to clarify some
points. We also revisit the 'Star Theorem' proved by Lieberman, Hauert and
Nowak for the star graphs. Theoretically, EMC techniques allow fast computation
of the fixation probability, but in practice this is not always true. Thus, in
the last part of the paper, we compare this algorithm with the standard Monte
Carlo method for some kind of complex networks.

  genome-wide approach</title><categories>cs.CE q-bio.QM stat.ME</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which assay more than a
million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals,
have been widely used to identify genetic risk variants for complex diseases.
However, most of the variants that have been identified contribute relatively
small increments of risk and only explain a small portion of the genetic
variation in complex diseases. This is the so-called missing heritability
problem. Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically
related, meaning these diseases share common genetic risk variants. Therefore,
exploring the genetic correlations across multiple related studies could be a
promising strategy for removing spurious associations and identifying
underlying genetic risk variants, and thereby uncovering the mystery of missing
heritability in complex diseases. Results: We present a general and robust
method to identify genetic patterns from multiple large-scale genomic datasets.
We treat the summary statistics as a matrix and demonstrate that genetic
patterns will form a low-rank matrix plus a sparse component. Hence, we
formulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem, where we aim to discover
risk variants shared by multiple diseases/traits and those for each individual
disease/trait. We propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an
efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our
method using both synthesized datasets and real datasets. The experimental
results show that our method can successfully reconstruct both the shared and
the individual genetic patterns from summary statistics and achieve better
performance compared with alternative methods under a wide range of scenarios.

autocovariate regression, offer distinct advantages for analysing spatially
autocorrelated ecological data. However, comparative studies by Carl and K\&quot;uhn
(Ecol. Model., 2007, 207, 159), Dormann (Ecol. Model., 2007, 207, 234), Dormann
et al. (Ecography, 2007, 30, 609) and Beale et al. (Ecol. Lett., 2010, 13, 246)
concluded that autocovariate regression yields anomalous covariate parameter
estimates. The last three studies were based on erroneous numerical evidence,
due to violation of conditions (Besag, J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B, 1974, 36, 192)
for auto-model validity. Here we show that after correcting these technical
errors, a more fundamental conceptual error remains: the comparative studies
are founded on a mathematically incorrect notion of bias, involving direct
comparison of parameter estimates across models differing in mathematical
structure. We develop a set of simulation-based measures of covariate influence
that are directly comparable across models and apply them to examples from the
abovementioned studies. We find that in these cases, the effect of auto-model
parameters is similar to (and consistent with) corresponding linear model
effects, due to a phenomenon within auto-models that we refer to as &quot;covariate
amplification&quot;. Thus, simple comparison of parameter magnitudes between
structurally different models can be highly misleading. We demonstrate that the
recent critique of auto-models is entirely unfounded. Correctly applied and
interpreted, autocovariate regression provides a practical approach to
inference for spatially autocorrelated species distribution or abundance data,
while overcoming well-known limitations of generalized linear models.

and must decide repeatedly whether to make an individual contribution or not.
However, players lack strategically relevant information about the game and
about the other players in the population. The resulting behavior of players is
completely uncoupled from such information, and the individual strategy
adjustment dynamics are driven only by reinforcement feedbacks from each
player's own past. We show that the resulting &quot;directional learning&quot; is
sufficient to explain cooperative deviations away from the Nash equilibrium. We
introduce the concept of k-strong equilibria, which nest both the Nash
equilibrium and the Aumann-strong equilibrium as two special cases, and we show
that, together with the parameters of the learning model, the maximal
k-strength of equilibrium determines the stationary distribution. The
provisioning of public goods can be secured even under adverse conditions, as
long as players are sufficiently responsive to the changes in their own payoffs
and adjust their actions accordingly. Substantial levels of public cooperation
can thus be explained without arguments involving selflessness or social
preferences, solely on the basis of uncoordinated directional (mis)learning.

into the workings of complex biological systems. Despite their seeming
simplicity, even so-called 'minimal' models can exhibit a diverse range of
behavior in various regions of the parameter space. These models can be studied
using simulations and analytical methods. Simulations are often parameter
dependent and fall short of providing a complete understanding of the full
range of system responses. Analytical approaches on the other hand provide a
framework to study the entire phase space. Here, we outline a largely
analytical method for studying reaction-diffusion models. Using a prototypic
model of cell polarization, we characterize protein activation in response to
an external stimulus and highlight the importance of phase-space analysis. We
demonstrate how comprehensive treatment of the phase space can guide
experimental design and supplement simulation studies. In order to make such
analyses more accessible, we provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface

factors in capsid self-assembly, survival of viruses in the extracellular
environment, and their cell infectivity. Virus shells can have applications as
nanocontainers and delivery vehicles in biotechnology and medicine. Combined
AFM experiments and computational modeling on sub-second timescales of the
indentation nanomechanics of Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) capsid show
that the capsid's physical properties are dynamic and local characteristics of
the structure, which depend on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input.
Surprisingly, under large deformations the CCMV capsid transitions to the
collapsed state without substantial local structural alterations. The enthalpy
change in this deformation state dH = 11.5 - 12.8 MJ/mol is mostly due to
large-amplitude out-of-plane excitations, which contribute to the capsid
bending, and the entropy change TdS = 5.1 - 5.8 MJ/mol is mostly due to
coherent in-plane rearrangements of protein chains, which result in the capsid
stiffening. Dynamic coupling of these modes defines the extent of elasticity
and reversibility of capsid mechanical deformation. This emerging picture
illuminates how unique physico-chemical properties of protein nanoshells help
define their structure and morphology, and determine their viruses' biological
function.

scientific research. Often these pipelines are resource intensive and require
days of computing time. In such cases, it makes sense to run them over
distributed computer clusters where they can take advantage of the aggregated
resources of many powerful computers. In addition to this, researchers often
want to integrate their workflows into their own web servers. In these cases,
software is needed to manage the submission of jobs from the web interface to
the cluster and then return the results once the job has finished executing.
  Results: We have developed the Job Management System (JMS), a workflow
management system and interface for the Torque resource manager. The JMS
provides users with a user-friendly interface for creating complex workflows
with multiple stages. It integrates this workflow functionality with Torque, a
tool that is used to control and manage batch jobs on distributed computing
clusters. The JMS can be used by researchers to build and run complex
computational pipelines and provides functionality to include these pipelines
in external interfaces. The JMS is currently being used to house a number of
structural bioinformatics pipelines at the Research Unit in Bioinformatics
(RUBi) at Rhodes University.

adults. Theory suggests that modularity can enhance the response function of a
networked system subject to changing external stimuli. Thus, greater cognitive
performance might be achieved for more modular neural activity, and modularity
might likely increase as children develop. The value of modularity calculated
from fMRI data is observed to increase during childhood development and peak in
young adulthood. Head motion is deconvolved from the fMRI data, and it is shown
that the dependence of modularity on age is independent of the magnitude of
head motion. A model is presented to illustrate how modularity can provide
greater cognitive performance at short times, i.e.\ task switching. A fitness
function is extracted from the model. Quasispecies theory is used to predict
how the average modularity evolves with age, illustrating the increase of
modularity during development from children to adults that arises from
selection for rapid cognitive function in young adults. Experiments exploring
the effect of modularity on cognitive performance are suggested. Modularity may
be a potential biomarker for injury, rehabilitation, or disease.

  1</journal-ref><doi>10.5296/ast.v3i1.6670</doi><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Several papers published since 2006 describe effects of magnetic fields on
elasmobranchs and assess their utility in reducing negative interactions
between sharks and humans, including bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a
single untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs
detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of
magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field
detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly
narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that
magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates
the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several
teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present
in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect
magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as
demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer
from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic
detection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies
depends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in
target teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be
independently tested with adequate sample sizes.

as an active continuum layer. The main active processes in this layer are
protrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers,
contraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active
bonding of trans-membrane proteins to a substrate. All three active mechanisms
are regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical
feedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In
this situation, it is instructive to take a reverse engineering approach and
study a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements
inside a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this
paper we assume that (in the range of interest) the energetic cost of
self-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion,
the maximization of the overall velocity. We then choose a prototypical
setting, formulate the corresponding variational problem and obtain a set of
bounds suggesting that radically different spatial distributions of adhesive
complexes would be optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of
self-propulsion. Thus, for contraction-dominated motility, adhesion has to
cooperate with 'pullers' which localize at the trailing edge of the cell, while
for protrusion-dominated motility it must conspire with 'pushers' concentrating
at the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms were
observed experimentally.

motor but also large probe particles coupled to it. The theoretical analysis of
these assays, however, often takes into account only the degrees of freedom
representing the motor. We present a coarse-graining method that maps a model
comprising two coupled degrees of freedom which represent motor and probe
particle to such an effective one-particle model by eliminating the dynamics of
the probe particle in a thermodynamically and dynamically consistent way. The
coarse-grained rates obey a local detailed balance condition and reproduce the
net currents. Moreover, the average entropy production as well as the
thermodynamic efficiency is invariant under this coarse-graining procedure. Our
analysis reveals that only by assuming unrealistically fast probe particles,
the coarse-grained transition rates coincide with the transition rates of the
traditionally used one-particle motor models. Additionally, we find that for
multicyclic motors the stall force can depend on the probe size. We apply this
coarse-graining method to specific case studies of the F1-ATPase and the
kinesin motor.

statistical and computational tools in order to be effective. Many such models
are `sloppy', i.e., exhibit behavior controlled by a relatively small number of
parameter combinations. We review an information theoretic framework for
analyzing sloppy models. This formalism is based on the Fisher Information
Matrix, which we interpret as a Riemannian metric on a parameterized space of
models. Distance in this space is a measure of how distinguishable two models
are based on their predictions. Sloppy model manifolds are bounded with a
hierarchy of widths and extrinsic curvatures. We show how the manifold boundary
approximation can extract the simple, hidden theory from complicated sloppy
models. We attribute the success of simple effective models in physics as
likewise emerging from complicated processes exhibiting a low effective
dimensionality. We discuss the ramifications and consequences of sloppy models
for biochemistry and science more generally. We suggest that the reason our
complex world is understandable is due to the same fundamental reason: simple
theories of macroscopic behavior are hidden inside complicated microscopic
processes.

often vary across life stages. Studies specifically aimed at assessing tree
survival are unusual and so data initially designed for other purposes often
need to be used; such data are more likely to contain errors than data
collected for this specific purpose. We investigate the survival rates of ten
tree species in a dataset designed to monitor growth rates. As some individuals
were not included in the census at some time points we use
capture-mark-recapture methods both to allow us to account for missing
individuals, and to estimate relocation probabilities. Growth rates, size, and
light availability were included as covariates in the model predicting survival
rates. The study demonstrates that tree mortality is best described as constant
between years and size-dependent at early life stages and size independent at
later life stages for most species of UK hardwood. We have demonstrated that
even with a twenty-year dataset it is possible to discern variability both
between individuals and between species. Our work illustrates the potential
utility of the method applied here for calculating plant population dynamics
parameters in time replicated datasets with small sample sizes and missing
individuals without any loss of sample size, and including explanatory
covariates.

and subsequent activation of the membrane proximal signaling module. Death
receptors cluster upon binding to death ligands, leading to formation of a
membrane proximal death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC). In this membrane
proximal signalosome, initiator caspases (caspase 8) are processed resulting in
activation of both type 1 and type 2 pathways of apoptosis signaling. How the
type 1/type 2 choice is made is an important question in the systems biology of
apoptosis signaling. In this study, we utilize a Monte Carlo based in silico
approach to elucidate the role of membrane proximal signaling module in the
type 1/type 2 choice of apoptosis signaling. Our results provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the formation of DISC signalosome and caspase 8
activation. Increased concentration of death ligands was shown to correlate
with increased type 1 activation. We also study the caspase 6 mediated system
level feedback activation of apoptosis signaling and its role in the type
1/type 2 choice. Our results clarify the basis of cell-to-cell stochastic
variability in apoptosis activation and ramifications of this issue is further

of inter-event density allows for a self-consistent calculation that determines
the asynchronous state and its stability. This framework, can readily be
extended to the analysis of systems with more state variables. To exhibit this,
we study a nonlinear pulse-coupled system, where couplings are dynamic and
activity dependent. We investigate stability of this system and we show it
undergoes a super-critical Hopf bifurcation to collective synchronization.

influenza H1N1pdm09-H275 wild type (WT) and H1N1pdm09-H275Y mutant (MUT)
strains, we describe a simple method of estimating the model's constant
parameters using Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo parameter estimation methods
present certain advantages over the bootstrapping methods previously used in
such studies: the result comprises actual parameter distributions (posteriors)
that can be used to compare different viral strains; the recovered parameter
distributions offer an exact method to compute credible intervals (similar to
the frequentist 95% parametric confidence intervals (CI)), that, in turn, using
a suitable analysis statistic, will be narrower than the ones obtained from
bootstrapping; given an appropriate computational parallelization, Monte Carlo
methods are also faster and less computationally intensive than bootstrapping.
We fit Gaussian distributions to the parameter posterior distributions and use
a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test to compare the two strains from a
parametric point of view; our example result shows that the two strains are 94%
different. Furthermore, based on the obtained parameter values, we estimate the
reproductive number R0 for each strain and show that the infectivity of the
mutant strain is larger than the wild type strain.

that is widely used in cellular and physiological situations. Interest in
studying death ligand induced apoptosis has increased due to the promising role
of recombinant soluble forms of death ligands (mainly recombinant TRAIL) in
anti-cancer therapy. A clear elucidation of how death ligands activate the type
1 and type 2 apoptotic pathways in healthy and cancer cells may help develop
better chemotherapeutic strategies. In this work, we use kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations to address the problem of type 1/ type 2 choice in death ligand
mediated apoptosis of cancer cells. Our study provides insights into the
activation of membrane proximal death module that results from complex
interplay between death and decoy receptors. Relative abundance of death and
decoy receptors was shown to be a key parameter for activation of the initiator
caspases in the membrane module. Increased concentration of death ligands
frequently increased the type 1 activation fraction in cancer cells, and, in
certain cases changes the signaling phenotype from type 2 to type 1. Results of
this study also indicate that inherent differences between cancer and healthy
cells, such as in the membrane module, may allow robust activation of cancer
cell apoptosis by death ligand induction. At the same time, large cell-to-cell
variability through the type 2 pathway was shown to provide protection for
healthy cells. Such elucidation of selective activation of apoptosis in cancer
cells addresses a key question in cancer biology and cancer therapy.

thrombi, occurs through binding of knobs 'A' and 'B' in the central nodule of
fibrin monomer to complementary holes 'a' and 'b' in the beta- and
gamma-nodules, respectively, of another monomer. We characterized the A:a and
B:b knob-hole interactions under varying solution conditions using Molecular
Dynamics simulations of the structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D
complexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob 'A' mimetic) and GHRP (knob 'B'
mimetic). The strength of A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes was roughly equal,
decreasing with pulling force; yet, the dissociation kinetics were sensitive to
variations in acidity (pH=5-7) and temperature (T=25-37 C). There were similar
structural changes in holes 'a' and 'b' during forced dissociation of the
knob-hole complexes: elongation of loop I, stretching of interior region, and
translocation of the moveable flap. The disruption of the knob-hole
interactions was not an &quot;all-or-none&quot; transition, as it occurred through
distinct two-step or single-step pathways with or without intermediate states.
The knob-hole bonds were stronger, tighter, and more brittle at pH=7 than at
pH=5. The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser, and more compliant than the
A:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, but stronger, tighter, and less compliant at pH=5.
Surprisingly, the knob-hole bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated
temperature (T=37 C) compared to T=25 C due to the helix-to-coil transition in
loop I, which helps stabilize the bonds. These results provide detailed
qualitative and quantitative characteristics underlying the most significant
non-covalent interactions involved in fibrin polymerization.

decoding are widely applied in industries and medical sciences. In spite of
high demands in these applications for a universal decoder that can be applied
to all individuals simultaneously, large variation in brain activities across
individuals has limited the scope of many studies to the development of
individual-specific decoders. In this study, we used deep neural network (DNN),
a nonlinear hierarchical model, to construct a subject-transfer decoder. Our
decoder is the first successful DNN-based subject-transfer decoder. When
applied to a large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) database,
our DNN-based decoder achieved higher decoding accuracy than other baseline
methods, including support vector machine (SVM). In order to analyze the
knowledge acquired by this decoder, we applied principal sensitivity analysis
(PSA) to the decoder and visualized the discriminative features that are common
to all subjects in the dataset. Our PSA successfully visualized the
subject-independent features contributing to the subject-transferability of the
trained decoder.

transport their genomic material. For many viral systems, in particular for
human viruses like hepatitis B, adeno or human immunodeficiency virus, that
lead to persistent infections, capsomeres are continuously produced in the
cytoplasm of the host cell while completed capsids exit the cell for a new
round of infection. Here we use coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of
a generic patchy particle model to elucidate the role of the dynamic supply of
capsomeres for the reversible self-assembly of empty T1 icosahedral virus
capsids. We find that for high rates of capsomere influx only a narrow range of
bond strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production
is possible. For bond strengths smaller and larger than this optimal value, the
reaction volume becomes crowded by small and large intermediates, respectively.
For lower rates of capsomere influx a broader range of bond strengths exists
for which a steady state of continuous capsid production is established,
although now the production rate of capsids is smaller. Thus our simulations
suggest that the importance of an optimal bond strength for viral capsid
assembly typical for in vitro conditions can be reduced by the dynamic influx
of capsomeres in a cellular environment.

self-assembly strategies for their capsids which are sufficiently robust as to
be reconstituted in vitro. Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually
assume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity
over the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,
binding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during
the self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible
advantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,
we use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us
to switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we
implement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become
active only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly
to be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural
reorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with
small dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.
However, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during
the final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a
weak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly
schemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here
for T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous
hexamers in the hierarchical scheme. In order to complement the simulations for
this more complicated case, we introduce a master equation approach that agrees
well with the simulation results.

work is to provide a quantitative approach to the problem of matching a wavelet

sixteen dogs and six volunteers were submitted to wavelet analysis.
Approximated wavelet-based versions of EGG signals were calculated using Pollen

Wavelet parameterization values that minimize the approximation error of

with vague or flat priors to analyze state-space models in ecology. Vague
priors are claimed to be objective and to let the data speak. Neither of these
claims is valid. Statisticians have criticized the use of vague priors from
philosophical to computational to pragmatic reasons. Ecologists, however,
dismiss such criticisms as empty philosophical wonderings with no practical
implications. We illustrate that use of vague priors in population viability
analysis and occupancy models can have significant impact on the analysis and
can lead to strikingly different managerial decisions. Given the wide spread
applicability of the hierarchical models and uncritical use of non-informative
Bayesian analysis in ecology, researchers should be cautious about using the
vague priors as a default choice in practical situations.

change, and accordingly evolve in response to the new conditions. This process
involves phenotypic changes that occur over several different time scales,
ranging from faster environmental adaptation without a corresponding change in
the genomic sequence to slower evolutionary dynamics involving genetic
mutations and subsequent selection. In this regard, a question arises as to
whether there are any relationships between such phenotypic changes over the
different time scales at which adaptive evolution occurs. In this study, we
analyzed simulated adaptive evolution in a simple cell model, and found that
proportionality between concentration changes in adaptation and evolution over
all components, and the proportion coefficients were closely linked to the
change in the growth rate of a cell. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
phenotypic variances in component concentrations due to (non-genetic) noise and
genomic alternations are proportional across all components. These global
relationships in cellular states were also supported by phenomenological theory
and transcriptome analysis of laboratory evolution in {\it Escherichia coli}.
These findings provide a basis for the development of a quantitative theory of
plasticity and robustness, and to determine the general restriction of
phenotypic changes imposed by evolution.

implants. By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of
the current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of
the output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation
current is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted
transistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit
low-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the
area of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented
in AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of
about 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the
anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor
can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed
system suitable for a large number of channels.

humans and almost all multicellular animals. However, its underlying kinetic
mechanism is unclear. The Gompertz law cannot explain the effect of temperature
on lifespan and the mortality plateau at advanced ages. In this study a
reaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to
describe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent
mortality function was derived. The new mortality function becomes the Gompertz
mortality function with the same relationship of parameters prescribed by the
Strehler-Mildvan correlation when age is smaller than a characteristic value
{\delta}, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than {\delta}.
A closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average
lifespan with temperature and other equations are derived from the new
mortality function. The derived equations can be used to estimate the limit of
average lifespan, predict the maximal longevity, calculate the temperature
coefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of survival curve. This
prediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories
for single-year birth cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process
results from the imbalance between damaging energy and protecting energy for
the critical chemical substance in the body. The rate of senescence of the
organism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality plateau
is reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The
decreasing rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent. This study
is exploring the connection between biochemical mechanism and demography.

important role in the origin of life context. Although the possibility to
reproduce this emergence in laboratory has received considerable attention,
this is still far from being achieved. In order to unravel some key properties
enabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own
existence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe
them in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by
different structural properties. From the point of view of network topology, an
autocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected
components (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets
(RAFs). We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the
probability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region
where the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter
also affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized
into linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs. Interestingly, we show that the
different network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems)
does not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance,
whereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to
play a role. A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and
that may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be
the presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or
catalyst of any reaction.

Multiset Genetic Algorithm (MuGA). The symbiogenetic approach used here is
based on the host-parasite model with the novelty of varying the length of
parasites along the evolutionary process. Additionally, it models
collaborations between multiple parasites and a single host. To improve
efficiency, we introduced proxy evaluation of parasites, which saves fitness
function calls and exponentially reduces the symbiotic collaborations produced.
Another novel feature consists of breaking the evolutionary cycle into two
phases: a symbiotic phase and a phase of independent evolution of both hosts
and parasites. SMuGA was tested in optimization of a variety of deceptive
functions, with results one order of magnitude better than state of the art
symbiotic algorithms. This allowed to optimize deceptive problems with large
sizes, and showed a linear scaling in the number of iterations to attain the
optimum.

and which carry the highest risk of causing a major outbreak if they are the
source of the infection? Here we show how these questions can be answered to
good approximation using the cavity method. Several curious properties of node
vulnerability and risk are explored: some nodes are more vulnerable than others
to weaker infections, yet less vulnerable to stronger ones; a node is always
more likely to be caught in an outbreak than it is to start one, except when
the disease has a deterministic lifetime; the rank order of node risk depends
on the details of the distribution of infectious periods.

  Among Tissues</title><categories>q-bio.PE q-bio.TO</categories><comments>17 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015a) find that the incidence of a set of cancer
types is correlated with the total number of normal stem cell divisions. Here,
we separate the effects of standing stem cell number (i.e., organ or tissue
size) and per stem cell lifetime replication rate. We show that each has a
statistically significant and independent effect on explaining variation in
cancer incidence over the 31 cases considered by Tomasetti and Vogelstein. When
considering the total number of stem cell divisions and when removing cases
associated with disease or carcinogens, we find that cancer incidence attains a
plateau of approximately 0.6% incidence for the cases considered by these
authors. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most
of the remaining variation in risk between cancer types. This new analysis
suggests that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions
but varies enormously ($\sim$10,000 times) depending on the stem cell's
environment. Future research should investigate how tissue characteristics
(anatomical site, type, size, stem cell divisions) explain cancer incidence
over a wider range of cancers, to what extent different tissues express
specific protective mechanisms, and whether any differential protection can be
attributed to natural selection.

its scope has been continuously changing. In this paper, we give an overview on
how and why its definition has evolved and suggest several clarification on the
concepts used in this field, in particular, on the notions of epigenetic
information, epigenetic stability and epigenetic templating. Another issue that
we address is the role of epigenetic information. Not only it is important in
allowing alternative interpretations of genetic information, but it appears to
be important in protecting the genetic information, moreover, we suggest that
this function appeared first in evolution and only later on the epigenetic
mechanisms were recruited to play a role in cell differentiation.

and Public Health planning. For multi-serotype pathogens, however, different
levels of serotype-specific immunity make it difficult to assess the population
at risk. In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimation of the
attack ratio of an epidemic and the initial fraction of susceptibles using
aggregated incidence data. We derive the probability distribution of the
effective reproductive number, R t , and use MCMC to obtain posterior
distributions of the parameters of a single-strain SIR transmission model with
time-varying force of infection. Our method is showcased in a data set
consisting of 18 years of dengue incidence in the city of Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn about the initial fraction
of susceptibles and the attack ratio even in the absence of serotype specific
data. On the other hand, the information provided by this approach is limited,
stressing the need for detailed serological surveys to characterise the
distribution of serotype-specific immunity in the population.

is performed differently compared with other objects. Converging reports, both
physiologically and psychophysically, indicate that faces are processed in
specialized neural networks in the brain -i.e. face patches in monkeys and the
fusiform face area (FFA) in humans. We are all expert face-processing agents,
and able to identify very subtle differences within the category of faces,
despite substantial visual and featural similarities. Identification is
performed rapidly and accurately after viewing a whole face, while
significantly drops if some of the face configurations (e.g. inversion,
misalignment) are manipulated or if partial views of faces are shown due to
occlusion. This refers to a hotly-debated, yet highly-supported concept, known
as holistic face processing. We built a hierarchical computational model of
face-processing based on evidence from recent neuronal and behavioural studies
on faces processing in primates. Representational geometries of the last three
layers of the model have characteristics similar to those observed in monkey
face patches (posterior, middle and anterior patches). Furthermore, several
face-processing-related phenomena reported in the literature automatically
emerge as properties of this model. The representations are evolved through
several computational layers, using biologically plausible learning rules. The
model satisfies face inversion effect, composite face effect, other race
effect, view and identity selectivity, and canonical face views. To our
knowledge, no models have so far been proposed with this performance and
agreement with biological data.

microchannel geometry on neuronal cultures and to maintain these cultures for
long period of time (over several weeks) inside the closed microchannels of
cellular scale dimensions.
  Methods: The primary hippocampal neurons from E-18 rat were cultured inside
the closed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels of varying sizes. The
effect of the channel geometry on the spatial and the temporal variations in
the neural microenvironment was investigated by studying neural maturation and
variation in the media osmolality respectively. The cultures were maintained
for longer time spans by PDMS device pretreatment, control on media evaporation
(by using hydrophobic ethylene propylene membrane) and an effective culture
maintenance protocol. Further, the devices were integrated with the planar
microelectrode arrays (MEA) to record spontaneous electrical activity.
  Results: A direct influence of channel geometry on neuron maturation was
observed with cells in smaller channels maturing faster. The temporal variation
in the microenvironment was caused by several fold increase in osmolality
within 2-3 days due to rapid media evaporation. With our culture methodology,
neurons were maintained in the closed channels as small as 50 microns in height
and width for over 1 month in serum free media condition and the time varying
spontaneous electrical activity was measured for up to 5 weeks using the MEA.
  Conclusions: The understanding of the effect of the culture scale on cellular
microenvironment and such long-term culture maintenance will be helpful in
studying neuronal tissue development; therapeutic drug screening; and for
network level neuronal analysis.

variables, useful to understand the organization of a dynamical system. The
variables belonging to a relevant subset should have a strong integration with
the other variables of the same relevant subset, and a much weaker interaction
with the other system variables. On this basis, extending previous works on
neural networks, an information-theoretic measure is introduced, i.e. the
Dynamical Cluster Index, in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets.
The method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among
the system variables, but relies on observations of their values in time. We
show its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random
boolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with
different topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks);
(ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii)
catalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway
in eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the
data are generated by a known dynamical model and the Dynamical Cluster Index
method is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization;
however it is important to stress that it can also be applied to time series
coming from field data without any reference to a model. Given that it is based
on relative frequencies of sets of values, the method could be applied also to
cases where the data are not ordered in time. Several indications to improve
the scope and effectiveness of the Dynamical Cluster Index to analyze the
organization of complex systems are finally given.

into cells via membrane vesicles. It plays an integral role in nutrient import,
signal transduction, neurotransmission and cellular entry of pathogens and
drug-carrying nanoparticles. As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the
plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending
and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension
conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this
study, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide
fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,
namely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane
tension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through
instability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination
to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR
proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we
present a new counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the
shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins,
supported by actin-BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing
of vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a new
stress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the
shapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through
transition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the
intriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into
detached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.

concentration gradient formation based on the Becker-Doring equations of
aggregation- fragmentation processes. We show that such a mechanism produces
robust concentration gradients on realistic time and spatial scales so long as
the process of clustering does not significantly stabilize the signaling
molecule. Finally, we demonstrate that such a model is applicable to the pom1p
subcellular gradient in fission yeast.

The homologous pairs are
almost identical pairs of chromosomes. For the most part, differences in
homologous chromosome occur at certain documented positions called single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A haplotype of an individual is the pair of
sequences of SNPs on the two homologous chromosomes. In this paper, we study
the problem of inferring haplotypes of individuals from mate-pair reads of
their genome. We give a simple formula for the coverage needed for haplotype
assembly, under a generative model. The analysis here leverages connections of
this problem with decoding convolutional codes.

  Ectocarpus siliculosus highlights signaling and tolerance mechanisms in brown

coastal ecosystems. They evolved independently from land plants and other
multicellular lineages, and therefore hold several original ontogenic and
metabolic features. Most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they
face frequent environmental changes, including exposure to toxic levels of
heavy metals such as copper (Cu). We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and
metabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal
model E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for
other abiotic stressors. This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative
stress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between
Cu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the
activation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,
together with the regulation of genes coding for several
transcription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically
activated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type
ATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent
bromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally
we observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic
processes on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen
assimilation on the other hand. Comparisons with data from green plants
indicate that some processes involved in Cu and oxidative stress response are
conserved across these two distant lineages. At the same time the high number
of yet uncharacterized brown alga-specific genes induced in response to copper
stress underlines the potential to discover new components and molecular
interactions unique to these organisms. Of particular interest for future
research is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-,
myo-inositol-, and oxylipin signaling.

the possibility to be stalled at certain position of the transcription
template. This may be due to the template damage, or protein barriers. Once
stalled, polymerase may backtrack along the template to the previous nucleotide
to wait for the repair of the damaged site, or simply bypass the barrier or
damaged site and consequently synthesize an incorrect messenger RNA, or degrade
and detach from the template. Thus, the {\it effective} transcription rate (the
rate to synthesize correct product mRNA) and the transcription {\it
effectiveness} (the ratio of the {\it effective} transcription rate to the {\it
effective} transcription initiation rate) are both influenced by polymerase
stalling events. This study shows that, Without backtracking, detachment of
stalled polymerase can also help to increase the {\it effective} transcription
rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. Generally, the increase of bypass
rate of the stalled polymerase will lead to the decrease of the {\it effective}
transcription rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. But when both
detachment rate and backtracking rate of the stalled polymerase vanish, the
{\it effective} transcription rate may also be increased by the bypass
mechanism.

produce necessary proteins for cell growth. Numerious experiments have been
performed to explore the translational properties. Diverse models have also
been developed to determine the biochemical mechanism of translation. However,
to simplify the majority of the existing models, the frameshifting of ribosome
along the mRNA transcript is neglected, which actually occurs in real cells and
has been extensively experimentally studied. The frameshifting of ribosome
evidently influences the efficiency and speed of translation, considering that
the peptide chains synthesized by shifted ribosomes will not fold into
functional proteins and will degrade rapidly. In this study, a theoretical
model is presented to describe the translational process based on the model for
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. In this model, the frameshifting
of the ribosome along the mRNA transcript and the attachment/detachment of the
ribosome to/from the main body of mRNA codons during translation elongation
process, are explicitly included. The results show that, with ribosome
frameshifing, the speed of correctly synthesized peptide chains may increase
first and then decrease with both the translation initiation rate $\alpha$ and
the ribosome detachment rate $\omega_d$. This results indicates that regulating
the translation process to reach maximal synthesized speed of proteins is
theoretically feasible. Traffic-related problems of ribosome motion along the
mRNA transcript are also addressed theoretically. Depending on parameter
values, shock wave (or domain wall) may exist for ribosome probabilities along
the mRNA.

polymer. The algorithm uses the statistics of coincidences among random samples
of configurations and is related to the catch-tag-release method for estimation
of population sizes, and to the classic &quot;birthday paradox&quot;. Bias in the entropy
estimation is decreased by grouping configurations in nearly equiprobable
partitions based on their energies, and estimating entropies separately within
each partition. Whereas most entropy estimation algorithms require $N\sim
2^{S}$ samples to achieve small bias, our approach typically needs only $N\sim
\sqrt{2^{S}}$. Thus the algorithm can be applied to estimate protein free
energies with increased accuracy and decreased computational cost.

  view</title><categories>q-bio.OT</categories><comments>13 pages, 5 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Measurement in biological systems became a subject of concern as a
consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental
results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general
features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their
chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.
Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct
trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible
sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,
sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the
organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And
this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a di?fferent
framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the
view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid
overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely
complemented. An increase of speci?cation of experimental procedures is the way
for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system may
be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.

Royal Soc. Interface, with

proposed to provide a metric for Euclidean space, possibly even hardwired in
the embryo. Yet one class of models describing the formation of grid unit
selectivity is entirely based on developmental self-organization, and as such
it predicts that the metric it expresses should reflect the environment to
which the animal has adapted. We show that, according to self-organizing
models, if raised in a non-Euclidean hyperbolic cage rats should be able to
form hyperbolic grids. For a given range of grid spacing relative to the radius
of negative curvature of the hyperbolic surface, such grids are predicted to
appear as multi-peaked firing maps, in which each peak has seven neighbours
instead of the Euclidean six, a prediction that can be tested in experiments.
We thus demonstrate that a useful universal neuronal metric, in the sense of a
multi-scale ruler and compass that remain unaltered when changing environments,
can be extended to other than the standard Euclidean plane.

continuum model, describing the dynamcis of two interacting families of locally
parallel actin filaments (C.Schmeiser and D.Oelz, How do cells move?
Mathematical modeling of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. Cell
mechanics: from single scale-based models to multiscale modeling. Chapman and
Hall, 2010). It contains accounts of the filaments' bending stiffness, of
adhesion to the substrate, and of cross-links connecting the two families.
  An extension of the model is presented with contributions from nucleation of
filaments by branching, from capping, from contraction by actin-myosin
interaction, and from a pressure-like repulsion between parallel filaments due
to Coulomb interaction. The effect of a chemoattractant is described by a
simple signal transduction model influencing the polymerization speed.
Simulations with the extended model show its potential for describing various
moving cell shapes, depending on the signal transduction procedure, and for
predicting transients between nonmoving and moving states as well as changes of
direction.

question in biology. Several models have been proposed for explaining the
origin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,
previous models only demonstrate either two important observations for the
allometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of
3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this
study, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that
total surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two
observations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic
rate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both
theoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law
although several different biological strategies are considered. The model
validity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the
importance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric
scaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the
origin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of
the model.

Indicators of
epistasis are of interest for large system where systematic fitness

theory. We show that considering shared entropy for pairs of loci can be
misleading. The reason is that shared entropy does not imply epistasis for the
pair. This observation holds true also in the absence of higher order
epistasis. We discuss a refined approach for identifying pairwise interactions
using entropy.

deeper levels of anesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anesthesia.
It is impossible to observe this &quot;rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic&quot; phenomenon from raw
electrocardiography waveform in current standard anesthesia monitors. To
explore the possible clinical value, I proposed the adaptive harmonic model,
which fits the descriptive property in physiology, and provides adequate
mathematical conditions for the quantification. Based on the adaptive harmonic
model, multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform was used to provide time-varying
power spectrum, which facilitates to compute the quantitative index:
&quot;Non-rhythmic-to-Rhythmic Ratio&quot; index (NRR index). I then used a clinical
database to analyze the behavior of NRR index and compare it with other
standard indices of anesthetic depth. The positive statistical results suggest
that NRR index provides addition clinical information regarding motor reaction,
which aligns with current standard tools. Furthermore, the ability to indicates
the noxious stimulation is an additional finding. Lastly, I have proposed an
real-time interpolation scheme to contribute my study further as a clinical
application.

individuals' experiences are believed to influence the cognitive aging quality.
In older individuals, both former and current musical practices have been
associated with better verbal skills, visual memory, processing speed, and
planning function. This work sought for an interaction between musical practice
and cognitive aging by comparing musician and non-musician individuals for two
lifetime periods (middle and late adulthood). Long-term memory, auditory-verbal
short-term memory, processing speed, non-verbal reasoning, and verbal fluencies
were assessed. In Study 1, measures of processing speed and auditory-verbal
short-term memory were significantly better performed by musicians compared
with controls, but both groups displayed the same age-related differences. For
verbal fluencies, musicians scored higher than controls and displayed different
age effects. In Study 2, we found that lifetime period at training onset
(childhood vs. adulthood) was associated with phonemic, but not semantic,
fluency performances (musicians who had started to practice in adulthood did
not perform better on phonemic fluency than non-musicians). Current frequency
of training did not account for musicians' scores on either of these two
measures. These patterns of results are discussed by setting the hypothesis of
a transformative effect of musical practice against a non-causal explanation.

for integrating new sensory evidence. Based on a probabilistic framework, we
investigated the alternative hypothesis that time is used for gradually
refining an internal estimate of uncertainty, that is to obtain an increasingly
accurate approximation of the posterior distribution through collecting samples
from it. In the context of a simple orientation estimation task, we
analytically derived predictions of how humans should behave under the two
hypotheses, and identified the across-trial correlation between error and
subjective uncertainty as a proper assay to distinguish between them. Next, we
developed a novel experimental paradigm that could be used to reliably measure
these quantities, and tested the predictions derived from the two hypotheses.
We found that in our task, humans show clear evidence that they use time mostly
for probabilistic sampling and not for evidence integration. These results
provide the first empirical support for iteratively improving probabilistic
representations in perceptual decision making, and open the way to reinterpret
the role of time in the cortical processing of complex sensory information.

and 36 parameters. Current methods from computational algebraic geometry and

  Problem with EEG or MEG</title><categories>q-bio.QM q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We study source localization from high dimensional M/EEG data by extending a
multiscale method based on Entropic inference devised to increase the spatial
resolution of inverse problems. This method is used to construct informative
prior distributions in a manner inspired in the context of fMRI (Amaral et al
2004). We construct a set of renormalized lattices that approximate the cortex
region where the source activity is located and address the related problem of
defining the relevant variables in a coarser scale representation of the
cortex. The priors can be used in conjunction with other Bayesian methods such
as the Variational Bayes method (VB, Sato et al 2004). The central point of the
algorithm is that it uses a posterior obtained at a coarse scale to induce a
prior at the next finer scale stage of the problem. We present results which
suggest, on simulated data, that this way of including prior information is a
useful aid for the source location problem. This is judged by the rate and
magnitude of errors in source localization. Better convergence times are also
achieved. We also present results on public data collected during a face
recognition task.

of bacteriorhodopsin (bR), a protein belonging to the transmembrane protein
family. To take into account the structure-dependent nature of the current, in
a previous set of papers we suggested a mechanism of sequential tunneling among
neighbouring amino acids. As a matter of fact, it is well accepted that, when
irradiated with green light, bR undergoes a conformational change at a
molecular level. Thus, the role played by the protein tertiary-structure in
modeling the charge transfer cannot be neglected. The aim of this paper is to
go beyond previous models, in the framework of a new branch of electronics, we
called proteotronics, which exploits the ability to use proteins as reliable,
well understood materials, for the development of novel bioelectronic devices.
In particular, the present approach assumes that the conformational change is
not the unique transformation that the protein undergoes when irradiated by
light. Instead, the light can also promote a free-energy increase of the
protein state that, in turn, should modify its internal degree of connectivity,
here described by the change in the value of an interaction radius associated
with the physical interactions among amino acids. The implemented model enables
us to achieve a better agreement between theory and experiments in the region
of a low applied bias by preserving the level of agreement at high values of
applied bias. Furthermore, results provide new insights on the mechanisms
responsible for bR photoresponse.

rate, the mean 'exon' length, and the mean 'exons per gene'. It is shown that
storing all genes of a single human definitely requires less than 12 MB.

options of behavior in game-like activities in free societies, yet the
co-evolutionary dynamics of these behavioral traits in the individual level are
not well understood. Here we investigate the continuous voluntary public good
game, in which individuals have two types of continuous-valued options: a
probability of joining the public good game and a level of cooperative
investment in the game. Our numerical results reveal hitherto unreported
phenomena: (i) The evolutionary dynamics are initially characterized by
oscillations in individual cooperation and participation levels, in contrast to
the population-level oscillations that have previously been reported. (ii)
Eventually, the population's average cooperation and participation levels
converge to and stabilize at a center. (iii) Then, a most peculiar phenomenon
unfolds: The strategies present in the population diversify and give rise to a
&quot;cloud&quot; of tinkering individuals who each tries out a different strategy, and
this process continues unchecked as long as the population's cooperation and
participation levels remain balanced. Over time, however, imbalances build up
as a consequence of random drift and there is a sudden and abrupt collapse of
the strategy-diversity cloud. The process then repeats again in a cyclic
manner. To understand the three aforementioned phenomena, we investigate the
system analytically using adaptive-dynamics techniques. Our analysis casts
light on the mechanisms which underpin the unexpected and surprising
evolutionary dynamics.

Molecular composition of recipes in a cuisine reveals patterns in food
preferences. Indian cuisine encompasses a number of diverse sub-cuisines
separated by geographies, climates and cultures. Its culinary system has a long
history of health-centric dietary practices focused on disease prevention and
promotion of health. We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show
that, in contrast to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines,
Indian cuisine has a strong signature of negative food pairing; more the extent
of flavor sharing between any two ingredients, lesser their co-occurrence. This
feature is independent of recipe size and is not explained by ingredient
category-based recipe constitution alone. Ingredient frequency emerged as the
dominant factor specifying the characteristic flavor sharing pattern of the
cuisine. Spices, individually and as a category, form the basis of ingredient
composition in Indian cuisine. We also present a culinary evolution model which
reproduces ingredient use distribution as well as negative food pairing of the
cuisine. Our study provides a basis for designing novel signature recipes,
healthy recipe alterations and recipe recommender systems.

many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an
inherent global directionality. Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a
simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\gamma$ controls the
degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the
model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also
feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and
feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio-
technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical
networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network
randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively
reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter
$\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\gamma$ correlates quite well with
another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a
novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network
directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the
observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.

multitude of clinical and research applications. Interpretation of flow
cytometry data is hard; the instrumentation is delicate and can not render
absolute measurements, hence samples can only be interpreted in relation to
each other while at the same time comparisons are confounded by inter-sample
variation. Despite this, current automated flow cytometry data analysis methods
either treat samples individually or ignore the variation by for example
pooling the data. In this article we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model
for studying latent relations between cell populations in flow cytometry
samples, thereby systematizing inter-sample variation. The model is applied to
a data set containing replicated flow cytometry measurements of samples from
healthy individuals, with informative priors capturing expert knowledge. It is
shown that the technical variation in the inferred cell population sizes is
small in comparison to the intrinsic biological variation. The large size of
flow cytometry data, where a single sample can contain measurements on hundreds
of thousands of cells, necessitates computationally efficient methods. To
address this, we have implemented a parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme
for sampling the posterior distribution.

Minimal models of bursting neurons must include both effects. We considered one
of these models and its relation with a generalized Kuramoto model, thanks to
the definition of a geometrical phase for bursting and a corresponding
frequency. We considered neuronal networks with different connection topologies
and investigated the transition from a non-synchronized to a partially
phase-synchronized state as the coupling strength is varied. The numerically
determined critical coupling strength value for this transition to occur is
compared with theoretical results valid for the generalized Kuramoto model.

transcription and translation is one of the most important molecular mechanisms
leading to ageing, a quantitative link between the error accumulation dynamics
and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. We study stability
properties of a generic gene regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that
phenomenology of ageing and the associated population mortality rate can be
naturally described in terms of critical dynamics of gene regulation and
metabolic profiles. We analyze age-dependent microarray datasets and metabolic
profiles for \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} and explicitly show that the
resulting GRNs are nearly critical and inherently unstable. This instability
manifests itself as ageing in the form of exponential distortions of gene
expressions and metabolic profiles with age, and causes the characteristic
increase in mortality rate with age as described by the Gompertz law. On top of
that we explain the plateau in mortality rates observed at very late ages for
large populations. We show that ageing contains both a stochastic component,
related to regulatory error accumulation in transcription/translation/metabolic
pathways, and a strong deterministic component, which can be naturally
associated with a part of a development programme. We conclude on this basis
that two opposing hypotheses of ageing, error accumulation and programmed
ageing are in fact compatible with each other. Since mortality in humans, where
it is characterized best, is mostly associated with age related diseases, we
support the idea of ageing being the driving force behind the development of
major diseases.

  deformation on air-mucus interaction</title><categories>physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph q-bio.TO</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Chest physiotherapy is an empirical technique used to help secretions to get
out of the lung whenever stagnation occurs. Although commonly used, little is
known about the inner mechanisms of chest physiotherapy and controversies about
its use are coming out regularly. Thus, a scientific validation of chest
physiotherapy is needed to evaluate its effects on secretions.
  We setup a quasi-static numerical model of chest physiotherapy based on
thorax and lung physiology and on their respective biophysics. We modeled the
lung with an idealized deformable symmetric bifurcating tree. Bronchi and their
inner fluids mechanics are assumed axisymmetric. Static data from the
literature is used to build a model for the lung's mechanics. Secretions motion
is the consequence of the shear constraints apply by the air flow. The input of
the model is the pressure on the chest wall at each time, and the output is the
bronchi geometry and air and secretions properties.
  In the limit of our model, we mimicked manual and mechanical chest
physiotherapy techniques. We show that for secretions to move, air flow has to
be high enough to overcome secretion resistance to motion. Moreover, the higher
the pressure or the quicker it is applied, the higher is the air flow and thus
the mobilization of secretions. However, pressures too high are efficient up to
a point where airways compressions prevents air flow to increases any further.
Generally, the first effects of manipulations is a decrease of the airway tree
hydrodynamic resistance, thus improving ventilation even if secretions do not
get out of the lungs. Also, some secretions might be pushed deeper into the
lungs; this effect is stronger for high pressures and for mechanical chest
physiotherapy. Finally, we propose and tested two adimensional numbers that
depend on lung properties and that allow to measure the efficiency and comfort
of a manipulation.

  identification</title><categories>cs.LG q-bio.MN q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Classification is one of the most popular and widely used supervised learning
tasks, which categorizes objects into predefined classes based on known
knowledge. Classification has been an important research topic in machine
learning and data mining. Different classification methods have been proposed
and applied to deal with various real-world problems. Unlike unsupervised
learning such as clustering, a classifier is typically trained with labeled
data before being used to make prediction, and usually achieves higher accuracy
than unsupervised one.
  In this paper, we first define classification and then review several
representative methods. After that, we study in details the application of
classification to a critical problem in drug discovery, i.e., drug-target
prediction, due to the challenges in predicting possible interactions between
drugs and targets.

fields ranging from biology, engineering, physics, chemistry, neuroscience, and
medicine. The functionality of networks with regard to performance, throughput,
reliability and robustness is strongly linked to the underlying geometric and
topological properties of the network and this is the focus of this paper,
especially as applied to certain biological networks. The fundamental
mathematical abstraction of a network as a weighted graph brings to bear the
tools of graph theory--a highly developed subject of mathematical research. But
more importantly, recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very
general metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and
ideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular,
robustness is closely connected to network entropy which, in turn, is very
closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of
alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the
classical Riemannian definition, each having its own advantages and
disadvantages, and are relevant to networks of interest. We will concentrate on
the role of curvature for certain key cancer networks in order to
quantitatively indicate their apparent functional robustness relative to their
normal counterparts.

diseases. In previous works, mitochondria are usually stimulated indirectly by
proapoptotic drugs to study mitochondrial development, which is in lack of
controllability, or spatial and temporal resolution. These chemicals or even
gene techniques regulating mitochondrial dynamics may also activate other
inter- or intra-cellular processes simultaneously. Here we demonstrate a
photostimulation method on single-mitochondrion level by tightly-focused
femtosecond laser that can precisely activate restorable fragmentation of
mitochondria which soon recover their original tubular structure after tens of
seconds. In this process, series of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(mROS) flashes are observed and found very critical to mitochondrial
fragmentation. Meanwhile, transient openings of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores (mPTP), suggested by oscillations of mitochondrial membrane
potential, contribute to the scavenging of redundant mROS and recovery of
fragmented mitochondria. Those results demonstrate photostimulation as an
active, precise and controllable method for the study of mitochondrial
oxidative and morphological dynamics or related fields.

this is due to the recently revived Deep Learning technology. Deep Learning
enables to process large amounts of data using simplified neuron networks that
simulate the way in which the brain works. However, there is a different point
of view, which posits that the brain is processing information, not data. This
unresolved duality hampered AI progress for years. In this paper, I propose a
notion of Integrated information that hopefully will resolve the problem. I
consider integrated information as a coupling between two separate entities -
physical information (that implies data processing) and semantic information
(that provides physical information interpretation). In this regard,
intelligence becomes a product of information processing. Extending further
this line of thinking, it can be said that information processing does not
require more a human brain for its implementation. Indeed, bacteria and amoebas
exhibit intelligent behavior without any sign of a brain. That dramatically
removes the need for AI systems to emulate the human brain complexity! The
paper tries to explore this shift in AI systems design philosophy.

  Using a Numerical Optimization Framework</title><categories>cs.NE q-bio.NC</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A central challenge in sensory neuroscience is describing how the activity of
populations of neurons can represent useful features of the external
environment. However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record
the responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter
entirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory
domains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is
effectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are
combinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of
possible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of
sensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are
almost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be
considered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based
experimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory
neurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and
leveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a
proving ground for our techniques. Specifically, using deep convolutional
neural networks, we asked whether modern black-box optimization techniques can
be used to interrogate the &quot;tuning landscape&quot; of an artificial neuron in a
deep, nonlinear system, without imposing significant constraints on the space
of stimuli under consideration. We introduce a series of measures to quantify
the tuning landscapes, and show how these relate to the performances of the
networks in an object recognition task. To the extent that deep convolutional
neural networks increasingly serve as de facto working hypotheses for
biological vision, we argue that developing a unified approach for studying
both artificial and biological systems holds great potential to advance both
fields together.

human pathogens, a protein shell called the capsid spontaneously assembles
around the viral genome. Understanding the mechanisms by which capsid proteins
selectively assemble around the viral RNA amidst diverse host RNAs is a key
question in virology. In one proposed mechanism, sequence elements (packaging
sites) within the genomic RNA promote rapid and efficient assembly through
specific interactions with the capsid proteins. In this work we develop a
coarse-grained particle-based computational model for capsid proteins and RNA
which represents protein-RNA interactions arising both from non-specific
electrostatics and specific packaging sites interactions. Using Brownian
dynamics simulations, we explore how the efficiency and specificity of assembly
depend on solution conditions (which control protein-protein and nonspecific
protein-RNA interactions) as well as the strength and number of packaging
sites. We identify distinct regions in parameter space in which packaging sites
lead to highly specific assembly via different mechanisms, and others in which
packaging sites lead to kinetic traps. We relate these computational
predictions to in vitro assays for specificity in which cognate viral RNAs are
compete against non-cognate RNAs for assembly by capsid proteins.

  scaling hypothesis</title><categories>q-bio.QM</categories><comments>Draft manuscript</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Respiration measurements of whole tree plants have been reported that give
evidence that the relative per volume/mass unit respiration decreases with
increase of tree body size. In this study, based on the available data
published a question was explored if the relative per area unit respiration in
trees can be a constant, independent of the surface area size. There is a
definite gap in the published data when the allometric studies of tree body
structure do not intercept with studies on trees respiration. Thus the question
was studied with the help of indirect comparison between various data. The
comparison showed that the scaling exponents, volume vs. surface area and
respiration vs. stem volume, are slightly larger than they should be for the
hypothesis of the relative respiration constancy to hold. The data studied give
evidence that the relative per area unit respiration slightly increases with
the increase in tree surface area. Possible explanations of the relationship
include a different distribution of metabolically active parts of stem and
higher nitrogen content in larger trees. Also, the published datasets might
include large fast growing trees, which imply that larger trees grow faster and
hence have higher per unit surface area growth respiration. A crucial
experiment is required in which the respiration measurements were performed for
the same data as the measurements of scaling between stem volume and surface
area.

hygiene. In order to achieve rapid and label-free identification of bacterial
species at the single bacterium level, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate an optical method based on Fourier transform light scattering
(FTLS) measurements and statistical classification. For individual rod-shaped
bacteria belonging to four bacterial species (Listeria monocytogenes,
Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis), two-dimensional
angle-resolved light scattering maps are precisely measured using FTLS
technique. The scattering maps are then systematically analyzed, employing
statistical classification in order to extract the unique fingerprint patterns
for each species, so that a new unidentified bacterium can be identified by a
single light scattering measurement. The single-bacterial and label-free nature
of our method suggests wide applicability for rapid point-of-care bacterial
diagnosis.

evolution of the genetic composition of a population under recombination and
resampling. There are $n$ sites (or loci), a finite number of letters (or
alleles) at every site, and we do not make any scaling assumptions. In
particular, we do not assume a diffusion limit. We consider the following
marginal ancestral recombination process. Let $S = \{1,...c,n\}$ and $\mathcal
A=\{A_1, ...c, A_m\}$ be a partition of $S$. We concentrate on the joint
probability of the letters at the sites in $A_1$ in individual $1$, $...c$, at
the sites in $A_m$ in individual $m$, where the individuals are sampled from
the current population without replacement. Following the ancestry of these
sites backwards in time yields a process on the set of partitions of $S$,
which, in the diffusion limit, turns into a marginalised version of the
$n$-locus ancestral recombination graph. With the help of an
inclusion-exclusion principle, we show that the type distribution corresponding
to a given partition may be represented in a systematic way, with the help of
so-called recombinators and sampling functions. The same is true of correlation
functions (known as linkage disequilibria in genetics) of all orders.
  We prove that the partitioning process (backward in time) is dual to the
Moran population process (forward in time), where the sampling function plays
the role of the duality function. This sheds new light on the work of
Bobrowski, Wojdyla, and Kimmel (2010). The result also leads to a closed system
of ordinary differential equations for the expectations of the sampling
functions, which can be translated into expected type distributions and
expected linkage disequilibria.

structures of ecological communities. Using the Yodzis framework of dominance
control versus founder control versus niche control, the importance of
intransitive loops in sub-communities in a source/sink or metacommunity
competition context is examined. It is found that a three-species sub-community
sampled from a species pool composed of nothing but dominance controlled
species pairs can result in a stable three species coexistence. It is shown
that if effect and response competition are balanced, the overall sub-community
will be persistent, anchored by one or more intransitive loops. It is proposed
that such an arrangement be referred to as an intransitive structure. It is
concluded that persistence of a sub-community (when species pairs in the
species pool are all dominance controlled) of more than three species is
possible only if it has an intransitive structure.

to confer them enhanced stability and robustness, is a subject of outmost
relevance. Mutualistic interactions have been profusely studied and their
corresponding bipartite networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, have been
reported to exhibit a characteristic &quot;nested&quot; structure. Assessing the
importance of any given species in mutualistic networks is a key task when
evaluating extinction risks and possible cascade effects. Inspired in a
recently introduced algorithm --similar in spirit to Google's PageRank but with
a built-in non-linearity-- here we propose a method which --by exploiting their
nested architecture-- allows us to derive a sound ranking of species importance
in mutualistic networks. This method clearly outperforms other existing ranking
schemes and can become very useful for ecosystem management and biodiversity
preservation, where decisions on what aspects of ecosystems to explicitly
protect need to be made.

University College London in 2007. It consists of 15 chapters by archaeologists
who self-identify themselves as practitioners who emphasize the benefits of
evolutionary or interpretive approaches to the study of the archaeological
record. While the authors' theoretical views are dichotomous, the editors' aim
for the book as a whole is not to expound on the differences between these two
kinds of archaeology but to bring forward a richer understanding of the
discipline and to highlight areas of mutual concern. Some chapters come across
as a bit of a sales pitch, but the majority of the contributions emphasize how
each approach can be productively used to address the goals of the other. The
book seeks to contribute to a mutually beneficial and more productive
discipline, and overall, it succeeds in this effort.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1205.4705</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  We present a dual optimization concept of predicting optimal sequences as
well as optimal folds of off-lattice protein models in the context of
multi-scale modeling. We validate the utility of the recently introduced
hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization algorithm by finding significantly lower
energy folds for minimalist and detailed protein models than previously
reported. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest
energy fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture.
In particular, for protein models with a binary sequence, we show that the
sequence-optimized folds form more compact cores than the lowest energy folds
of the historically fixed, Fibonacci-series sequences of chain lengths of 13,
21, 34, 55, and 89. We then extend our search algorithm to use UNRES, one of
the leading united-residue protein force fields. Our combined fold and sequence
optimization on three test proteins reveal an inherent bias in UNRES favoring
alpha helical structures even when secondary structure prediction clearly
suggests only beta sheets besides random coil, and virtually no helices. One
test in particular, a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain,
demonstrates that by permutations of its sequence UNRES re-folds this structure
into a perfect alpha helix but, in fact, the helix is just an artefact of the
force field, the structure quickly unfolds in all-atom state-of-the-art
molecular dynamics simulation.

molecular processes within the cell. Computational algorithms can be of great
help in the understanding of RNA structure-function relationship. One of the
main challenges in this field is the development of structure-prediction
algorithms, which aim at the prediction of the three-dimensional (3D) native
fold from the sole knowledge of the sequence. In a recent paper, we have
introduced a scoring function for RNA structure prediction. Here, we analyze in
detail the performance of the method, we underline strengths and shortcomings,
and we discuss the results with respect to state-of-the-art techniques. These
observations provide a starting point for improving current methodologies, thus
paving the way to the advances of more accurate approaches for RNA 3D structure
prediction.

  biological ontologies on the Semantic Web</title><categories>q-bio.QM cs.AI</categories><acm-class>I.2.4</acm-class><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  The delineation of logical definitions for each class in an ontology and the
consistent application of these definitions to the assignment of instances to
classes are important criteria for ontology evaluation. If ontologies are
specified with property-based restrictions on class membership, then such
consistency can be checked automatically. If no such logical restrictions are
applied, as is the case with many biological ontologies, there are currently no
automated methods for measuring the semantic consistency of instance assignment
on an ontology-wide scale, nor for inferring the patterns of properties that
might define a particular class. We constructed a program that takes as its
input an OWL/RDF knowledge base containing an ontology, instances associated
with each of the classes in the ontology, and properties of those instances.
For each class, it outputs: 1) a rule for determining class membership based on
the properties of the instances and 2) a quantitative score for the class that
reflects the ability of the identified rule to correctly predict class
membership for the instances in the knowledge base. We evaluated this program
using both artificial knowledge bases of known quality and real, widely used
ontologies. The results indicate that the suggested method can be used to
conduct objective, automatic, data-driven evaluations of biological ontologies
without formal class definitions in regards to the property-based consistency
of instance-assignment. This inductive method complements existing, purely
deductive approaches to automatic consistency checking, offering not just the
potential to help in the ontology engineering process but also in the knowledge
discovery process.

development of effective labels, e.g. organic fluorophores and nanoparticles,
to track trajectories of single biomolecules. Standard methods use particular
statistics, namely the mean square displacement, to analyze the underlying
dynamics. Here, we introduce general inference methods to fully exploit
information in the experimental trajectories, providing sharp estimates of the
forces and the diffusion coefficients in membrane microdomains. Rapid and
reliable convergence of the inference scheme is demonstrated on trajectories
generated numerically. The method is then applied to infer forces and
potentials acting on the receptor of the $\epsilon$-toxin labeled by
lanthanide-ion nanoparticles. Our scheme is applicable to any labeled
biomolecule and results show show its general relevance for membrane
compartmentation.

  on arXiv</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Quantifying the forces between and within macromolecules is a necessary first
step in understanding the mechanics of molecular structure, protein folding,
and enzyme function and performance. In such macromolecular settings, dynamic
single-molecule force spectroscopy (DFS) has been used to distort bonds. The
resulting responses, in the form of rupture forces, work applied, and
trajectories of displacements, have been used to reconstruct bond potentials.
Such approaches often rely on simple parameterizations of one-dimensional bond
potentials, assumptions on equilibrium starting states, and/or large amounts of
trajectory data. Parametric approaches typically fail at inferring
complex-shaped bond potentials with multiple minima, while piecewise estimation
may not guarantee smooth results with the appropriate behavior at large
distances. Existing techniques, particularly those based on work theorems, also
do not address spatial variations in the diffusivity that may arise from
spatially inhomogeneous coupling to other degrees of freedom in the
macromolecule, thereby presenting an incomplete picture of the overall bond
dynamics. To solve these challenges, we have developed a comprehensive
empirical Bayesian approach that incorporates data and regularization terms
directly into a path integral. All experiemental and statistical parameters in
our method are estimated empirically directly from the data. Upon testing our
method on simulated data, our regularized approach requires fewer data and
allows simultaneous inference of both complex bond potentials and diffusivity
profiles.

surfaces and can trigger hospital-acquired infections. They provide a classical
example in biology where the dynamics of cellular communities may be observed
and studied. Gene expression regulates cell division and differentiation, which
affect the biofilm architecture. Mechanical and chemical processes shape the
resulting structure. We gain insight into the interplay between cellular and
mechanical processes during biofilm development on air-agar interfaces by means
of a hybrid model. Cellular behavior is governed by stochastic rules informed
by a cascade of concentration fields for nutrients, waste and autoinducers.
Cellular differentiation and death alter the structure and the mechanical
properties of the biofilm, which is deformed according to Foppl-Von Karman
equations informed by cellular processes and the interaction with the
substratum. Stiffness gradients due to growth and swelling produce wrinkle
branching. We are able to reproduce wrinkled structures often formed by
biofilms on air-agar interfaces, as well as spatial distributions of
differentiated cells commonly observed with B. subtilis.

interacting components, both in discrete and continuous time. Each component is
represented by a point process indicating if it has a spike or not at a given
time. The system evolves as follows. For each component, the rate (in
continuous time) or the probability (in discrete time) of having a spike
depends on the entire time evolution of the system since the last spike time of
the component. In discrete time this class of systems extends in a non trivial
way both Spitzer's interacting particle systems, which are Markovian, and
Rissanen's stochastic chains with memory of variable length which have finite
state space. In continuous time they can be seen as a kind of Rissanen's
variable length memory version of the class of self-exciting point processes
which are also called &quot;Hawkes processes&quot;, however with infinitely many
components. These features make this class a good candidate to describe the
time evolution of networks of spiking neurons. In this article we present a
critical reader's guide to recent papers dealing with this class of models,
both in discrete and in continuous time. We briefly sketch results concerning
perfect simulation and existence issues, de-correlation between successive
interspike intervals, the longtime behavior of finite non-excited systems and
propagation of chaos in mean field systems.

distribution and dynamics of traits in communities. However, a general theory
of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g., species
that differ in size) and gradients (e.g., temperature), has yet to be
formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory
provides the basis for such a theory it does not explicitly account for
differences traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal
temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling
approaches into a framework that we term Trait Drivers Theory or TDT. It shows
that the shape and dynamics of trait distributions can be uniquely linked to
fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to
future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several
theoretical studies, recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic
gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences
ecosystem productivity across an elevational gradient and a 140-year long
ecological experiment. We argue that our general TDT provides a baseline for
(i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness
in terms of the shape of trait distributions; and (ii) integrating how specific
traits, including body size, and functional diversity scale up to influence the
dynamics of species assemblages across climatic gradients and how shifts in
functional composition influences ecosystem functioning. Further, it offers a
novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness
based approaches in order to build a more predictive functional biogeography to
show how assemblages of species have and will respond to climate change.

techniques such as diffusion imaging. However, these are imperfect because they
miss connections that are actually known to exist, especially long range
inter-hemispheric ones. In this paper we formulate the inverse problem of
inferring the structural connectivity of brain networks from experimentally
observed functional connectivity via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI), by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. We show that
structural connectivity can be modeled as an optimal sparse representation
derived from the much denser functional connectivity in the human brain. Using
only the functional connectivity data as input, we present (a) an optimization
problem that models constraints based on known physiological observations, and
(b) an ADMM algorithm for solving it. The algorithm not only recovers the known
structural connectivity of the brain, but is also able to robustly predict the
long range inter-hemispheric connections missed by DSI or DTI, including a very
good match with experimentally observed quantitative distributions of the
weights/strength of anatomical connections. We demonstrate results on both
synthetic model data and a fine-scale 998 node cortical dataset, and discuss
applications to other complex network domains where retrieving effective
structure from functional signatures are important.

This question engages fields as diverse as linguistics, sociology and cognitive
science. Previous empirical attempts to solve this puzzle all presuppose that
formal or informal institutions, such as incentives for global agreement,
coordinated leadership, or aggregated information about the population, are
needed to facilitate a solution. Evolutionary theories of social conventions,
by contrast, hypothesize that such institutions are not necessary in order for
social conventions to form. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis have
been hindered by the difficulties of evaluating the real-time creation of new
collective behaviors in large decentralized populations. Here, we present
experimental results - replicated at several scales - that demonstrate the
spontaneous creation of universally adopted social conventions, and show how
simple changes in a population's network structure can direct the dynamics of
norm formation, driving human populations with no ambition for large scale
coordination to rapidly evolve shared social conventions.

for automated analysis of functional imaging data that runs under the
cross-platform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.). ICM uses a
semi-supervised framework, in which at every stage of analysis computers handle
the routine work, which is then refined by user intervention. The main
functionality of ICM is built upon automated extraction of component signals
from imaging data, segmentation and clustering of component signals, and
feature computation and visualization. Analysis of imaging data through ICM can
also be done in real-time, enabling guided imaging experiments. ICM is built
using MATLAB's object-oriented class design, which allows the tool to be used
both as a graphic user interface (GUI) as well as in custom scripts. ICM is
freely available under the GNU public license for non-commerical use and open
source development, together with sample data, user tutorials and extensive
documentation.

diffusion. Yet, this description often fails to properly distinguish and
evaluate the physical parameters (such as the membrane friction) and the
biochemical interactions governing the motion. Here, we present a method
combining high-density single-molecule imaging and statistical inference to
separately map the diffusion and energy landscapes of membrane proteins across
the cell surface at ~100 nm resolution (with acquisition of a few minutes).
When applying these analytical tools to glycine neurotransmitter receptors
(GlyRs) at inhibitory synapses, we find that gephyrin scaffolds act as shallow
energy traps (~3 kBT) for GlyRs, with a depth modulated by the biochemical
properties of the receptor-gephyrin interaction loop. In turn, the inferred
maps can be used to simulate the dynamics of proteins in the membrane, from the
level of individual receptors to that of the population, and thereby, to model
the stochastic fluctuations of physiological parameters (such as the number of
receptors at synapses). Overall, our approach provides a powerful and
comprehensive framework with which to analyze biochemical interactions in
living cells and to decipher the multi-scale dynamics of biomolecules in
complex cellular environments.

coarse-grained model. Two of these proteins come from thermophilic bacteria,
one from a cryophilic bacterium and one from a mesophilic organism; three are
in the closed and two in the open conformations. Even though the proteins
belong to the same fold, the model distinguishes the properties of these
proteins in a way which is consistent with experiments. For instance, the
thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic
and cryophilic homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal
fluctuations near the native state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding.
The level of stability correlates with the average coordination number for
amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern
of positional fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is
different than in the open conformation, including within the active site. The
modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids
forming the active site are very different in the open and closed
conformations. Taken together, our results show that the precise location of
amino acid contacts in the native structure appears to be a critical element in
explaining the similarities and differences in the thermodynamic properties,
local flexibility and collective motions of the different forms of the enzyme.

the crops which depend on bee polination. Multiple factors are known to
increase the risk of colony colapse, and the ectoparasitic mite Varroa
destructor that parasitizes honey bees is among the main threats to colony
health. Although this mite is unlikely to, by itself, cause the collapse of
hives, it plays an important role as it is a vector for many viral diseases.
Such diseases are among the likely causes for Colony Collapse Disorder.
  The effects of V. destructor infestation are disparate in different parts of
the world. Greater morbidity - in the form of colony losses - has been reported
in colonies of European honey bees (EHB) in Europe, Asia and North America.
However, this mite has been present in Brasil for many years and yet there are
no reports of Africanized honey bee (AHB) colonies losses.
  Studies carried out in Mexico showed that some resistance behaviors to the
mite - especially grooming and hygienic behavior - appear to be different in
each subspecies. Could those difference in behaviors explain why the AHB are
less susceptible to Colony Collapse Disorder?
  In order to answer this question, we propose a mathematical model of the
coexistence dynamics of these two species, the bee and the mite, to analyze the
role of resistance behaviors in the overall health of the colony, and, as a
consequence, its ability to face epidemiological challenges.

  Maps without Gene Strandedness</title><categories>q-bio.GN</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The study of genetic map linearization leads to a combinatorial hard problem,
called the {\em minimum breakpoint linearization} (MBL) problem. It is aimed at
finding a linearization of a partial order which attains the minimum breakpoint
distance to a reference total order. The approximation algorithms previously
developed for the MBL problem are only applicable to genetic maps in which
genes or markers are represented as signed integers. However, current genetic
mapping techniques generally do not specify gene strandedness so that genes can
only be represented as unsigned integers. In this paper, we study the MBL
problem in the latter more realistic case. An approximation algorithm is thus
developed, which achieves a ratio of $(m^2+2m-1)$ and runs in $O(n^7)$ time,
where $m$ is the number of genetic maps used to construct the input partial
order and $n$ the total number of distinct genes in these maps.

induced dissociation and unfolding of the protein complex CD48-2B4. This
heterodimer is an indispensable component of the immunological system: 2B4 is a
receptor on natural killer cells whereas CD48 is expressed on surfaces of
various immune cells. So far, its mechanostability has not been assessed either
experimentally or theoretically. We find that the dissociation processes
strongly depend on the direction of pulling and may take place in several
pathways. Interestingly, the CD48-2B4 interface can be divided into three
distinct patches that act as units when resisting the pulling forces. At
experimentally accessible pulling speeds, the characteristic mechanostability
forces are in the range between 100 and 200 pN, depending on the pulling
direction. These characteristic forces need not be associated with tensile
forces involved in the act of separation of the complex because prior
shear-involving unraveling within individual proteins may give rise to a higher
force peak.

between system parameters, and uniqueness and stability of the resulting
equilibria. Such systems are typically employed to describe nonlinear dynamics
in chemical reaction networks, but over the last years they proved useful in
modeling a wide range of nonlinear dynamic systems with applications in
biology, process systems, economics or transportation problems. In particular,
a canonical representation of the set of all possible feasible equilibrium
solutions is developed. The characterization is made in terms of compartmental
matrices which by construction are strictly stable and define the so-called
family of solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are
linear in the log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of
the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly interesting representation of
these constraints can be established in terms of a class of monotonous
functions which turn out to be critical to conclude uniqueness of equilibrium
points in a class of deficiency one networks. One main consequence of such
representation is the possibility of a simple constructive proof of the
deficiency one theorem. It also allows a precise characterization of the
parameter space region of complex balance solutions we refer to as the Horn
set. Future directions may involve detection or design of networks having
multiple equilibria, or the use of complex balance condition to provide
stabilization via feed-back control of open reaction systems.

synthetic routes that connect the building blocks of modern life such as
sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids to &quot;molecular food sources&quot; that
have likely been abundant on Early Earth. In a recent contribution, Albert
Eschenmoser emphasised the importance of catalytic and autocatalytic cycles in
establishing such abiotic synthesis pathways. The accumulation of intermediate
products furthermore provides additional catalysts that allow pathways to
change over time. We show here that generative models of chemical spaces based
on graph grammars make it possible to study such phenomena is a systematic
manner. In addition to repro- ducing the key steps of Eschenmoser's hypothesis
paper, we discovered previously unexplored potentially autocatalytic pathways
from HCN to glyoxylate. A cascading of autocatalytic cycles could efficiently
re-route matter, distributed over the combinatorial complex network of HCN
hydrolysation chemistry, towards a potential primordial metabolism. The
generative approach also has it intrinsic limitations: the unsupervised
expansion of the chemical space remains infeasible due to the exponential
growth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the
combinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks
forms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the
computational exploration by chemical experience is indispensable.

linear heteropolymer, using a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as the corresponding
template; the sequence of monomers of the RNA is dictated by that of monomers
on the ssDNA template. While polymerizing a RNA, the RNAP walks step-by-step on
the ssDNA template in a specific direction. Thus, a RNAP can be regarded also
as a molecular motor and the sites of start and stop of its walk on the DNA
mark the two ends of the genetic message that it transcribes into RNA.
Interference of transcription of two overlapping genes is believed to regulate
the levels of their expression, i.e., the overall rate of the corresponding RNA
synthesis, through suppressive effect of one on the other. Here we model this
process as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP motors that are characterized
by two distinct pairs of start and stop sites. Each group polymerizes identical
copies of a RNA while the RNAs polymerized by the two groups are different.
These models, which may also be viewed as two interfering totally asymmetric
simple exclusion processes, account for all modes of transcriptional
interference in spite of their extreme simplicity. A combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation of these models demonstrate the physical origin
of the switch-like regulation of the two interfering genes in both
co-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of RNAP motors.

evolutionary game for various reasons, ranging from lack of interest to risk
aversion. In order to understand the consequences of such diverse activity
patterns on the evolution of cooperation, we study a weak prisoner's dilemma
where each player's participation is probabilistic rather than certain. Players
that do not participate get a null payoff and are unable to replicate. We show
that inactivity introduces cascading failures of cooperation, which are
particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs. The
drops in the fraction of cooperators are sudden, while the spatiotemporal
reorganization of compact cooperative clusters, and thus the recovery, takes
time. Nevertheless, if the activity of players is directly proportional to
their degree, or if the interaction network is not strongly heterogeneous, the
overall evolution of cooperation is not impaired. This is because inactivity
negatively affects the potency of low-degree defectors, who are hence unable to
utilize on their inherent evolutionary advantage. Between cascading failures,
the fraction of cooperators is therefore higher than usual, which lastly
balances out the asymmetric dynamic instabilities that emerge due to
intermittent blackouts of cooperative hubs.

pair of male and female determines the trait of their offspring. Each of the
pair contributes one inherited character, the allele, to combine into the
genotype of their offspring. Hence, for an N-gender polypoid gene-mating model,
each of N different genders contributes one allele to combine into the genotype

  (Pseudomugil signifer)</title><categories>q-bio.QM</categories><comments>9 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The escape trajectories animals take following a predatory attack appear to
show high degrees of apparent 'randomness' - a property that has been described
as 'protean behaviour'. Here we present a method of quantifying the escape
trajectories of individual animals using a path complexity approach. When fish
(Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked either on their own or in groups, we find
that an individual's path rapidly increases in entropy (our measure of
complexity) following the attack. For individuals on their own, this entropy
remains elevated (indicating a more random path) for a sustained period (10
seconds) after the attack, whilst it falls more quickly for individuals in
groups. The entropy of the path is context dependent. When attacks towards
single fish come from greater distances, a fish's path shows less complexity
compared to attacks that come from short range. This context dependency effect
did not exist, however, when individuals were in groups. Nor did the path
complexity of individuals in groups depend on a fish's local density of
neighbours. We separate out the components of speed and direction changes to
determine which of these components contributes to the overall increase in path
complexity following an attack. We found that both speed and direction measures
contribute similarly to an individual's path's complexity in absolute terms.
Our work highlights the adaptive behavioural tactics that animals use to avoid
predators and also provides a novel method for quantifying the escape
trajectories of animals.

  HIV Positive Patients and Its Application</title><categories>q-bio.QM</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  A total of 50 patients were enrolled in the study, and MRI brain with MR
spectroscopy was done. Tuberculosis was the most common neurologic disease
found in the HIV positive group, consisting of 9 patients. Seven of these
patients had tuberculous meningitis amongst which a further 2 had vasculitic
infarcts.PML was seen in 6 patients. NAA to Cr ratio was found to be reduced in
all the patients, and in fact the value was further reduced compared to the HIV
positive group as a whole. Raised choline and myoInositol peaks were also found
in all the patients. MR Spectroscopy showed lipid lactate peaks confirming the
diagnosis. 2 patients had HIV encephalopathy on the imaging study. Their
spectra also revealed lowered NAA peaks along with raised choline peaks. 2
patients with cryptococcosis showed characteristic imaging finding of enlarged
Virchow Robin (perivascular) spaces. They revealed elevated choline peaks in
addition to reduced NAA. The values of NAA to Cr ratio were determined after
duly processing the spectroscopic data from both cases and controls. Each group
(Cases and controls) were divided on the basis of age into two age groups:
Lesser than or equal to 40 years, and greater than 40 years. In all three
groups the values of the mean NAA to Cr ratio ratio was significantly (p-value
less than 0.05) reduced in comparison to controls. An ancillary finding was the
reduction of NAA to Cr ratio further in cases of PML. Combined use of both the
conventional and advanced MRI sequences is advisable as spectroscopy helps in
confirming the diagnosis of opportunistic infection of the CNS in HIV positive
patients. NAA to Cr ratio ratio is reduced in HIV positive patients and is a
marker for HIV infection of the brain even in the absence of imaging findings
of HIV encephalopathy or when the patient is symptomatic due to neurological
disease of other etiologies.

scale on which temporal correlations occur. They allow the computation of
jitter corrected cross correlograms and the performance of an associated
statistically robust hypothesis test to decide whether observed correlations at
a given time scale are significant. Currently used Monte Carlo methods
approximate the probability distribution of coincidences. They require
generating $N_{\rm MC}$ simulated spike trains of length $T$ and calculating
their correlation with another spike train up to lag $\tau_{\max}$. This is
computationally costly $O(N_{\rm MC} \times T \times \tau_{\max})$ and it
introduces errors in estimating the $p$ value. Instead, we propose to compute
the distribution in closed form, with a complexity of $O(C_{\max}
\log(C_{\max}) \tau_{\max})$, where $C_{\max}$ is the maximum possible number
of coincidences. All results are then exact rather than approximate, and as a
consequence, the $p$-values obtained are the theoretically best possible for
the available data and test statistic. In addition, simulations with realistic
parameters predict a speed increase over Monte Carlo methods of two orders of
magnitude for hypothesis testing, and four orders of magnitude for computing
the full jitter-corrected cross correlogram.

confirmation of the hypothesis that CGR patterns are preserved along a genomic
DNA sequence, and are different for DNA sequences originating from genomes of
different species. This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs of
genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. In particular, we
compare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic
sequences originating from the genomes of six organisms, each belonging to one
of the kingdoms of life: H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana, P. falciparum,
E. coli, and P. furiosus. We also provide preliminary evidence of this method's
applicability to closely related species by comparing H. sapiens (chromosome
21) sequences and over one hundred and fifty genomic sequences, also 150,000 bp
long, from P. troglodytes (Animalia; chromosome Y), for a total length of more
than 101 million basepairs analyzed. We compute pairwise distances between CGRs
of these genomic sequences using six different distances, and construct
Molecular Distance Maps that visualize all sequences as points in a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, to simultaneously display their
interrelationships. Our analysis confirms that CGR patterns of DNA sequences
from the same genome are in general quantitatively similar, while being
different for DNA sequences from genomes of different species. Our analysis of
the performance of the assessed distances uses three different quality measures
and suggests that several distances outperform the Euclidean distance, which
has so far been almost exclusively used for such studies. In particular we show
that, for this dataset, DSSIM (Structural Dissimilarity Index) and the
descriptor distance (introduced here) are best able to classify genomic
sequences.

Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT) in excitonic transport processes. In
disordered quantum systems transport is most efficient when the environment
just destroys quantum interferences responsible for localization, but the
coupling does not drive the system to fully classical thermal diffusion yet.
This poised realm between the pure quantum and the semi-classical domains has
not been considered in other biological transport processes, such as charge
transport through organic molecules. Binding in receptor-ligand complexes is
assumed to be static as electrons are assumed to be not able to cross the
ligand molecule. We show that ENAQT makes cross ligand transport possible and
efficient between certain atoms opening the way for the reorganization of the
charge distribution on the receptor when the ligand molecule docks. This new
effect can potentially change our understanding how receptors work. We
demonstrate room temperature ENAQT on the caffeine molecule.

(WoM) and epidemic dynamics controlled by voluntary vaccination. We combine a
game-theoretic model for the spread of WoM and a compartmental model describing
$SIR$ disease dynamics in the presence of a program of voluntary vaccination.
We evaluate and compare two scenarios, depending on what WoM disseminates: (1)
vaccine advertising, which may occur whether or not an epidemic is ongoing and
(2) epidemic status, notably disease prevalence. Understanding the synergy
between the two strategies could be particularly important for organizing
voluntary vaccination campaigns. We find that, in the initial phase of an
epidemic, vaccination uptake is determined more by vaccine advertising than the
epidemic status. As the epidemic progresses, epidemic status become
increasingly important for vaccination uptake, considerably accelerating
vaccination uptake toward a stable vaccination coverage.

i.e., by the attainment of a threshold value of a relevant cellular or
molecular dynamical variable. Since the governing variable itself typically
undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in
the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time
is called the &quot;first passage&quot; time and the corresponding process is a &quot;first
passage&quot; (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first
passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate
fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which
naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications
thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical
systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques;
the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of
necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor
binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.

summarising the dissimilarity, or 'incongruence', of two or more phylogenetic
trees. Many of these measures are NP-hard to compute and this has stimulated a
considerable volume of research into fixed parameter tractable algorithms. In
this article we use Monadic Second Order logic (MSOL) to give alternative,
compact proofs of fixed parameter tractability for several well-known
incongruency measures. In doing so we wish to demonstrate the considerable
potential of MSOL - machinery still largely unknown outside the algorithmic
graph theory community - within phylogenetics. A crucial component of this work
is the observation that many of these measures, when bounded, imply the
existence of an 'agreement forest' of bounded size, which in turn implies that
an auxiliary graph structure, the display graph, has bounded treewidth. It is
this bound on treewidth that makes the machinery of MSOL available for proving
fixed parameter tractability. We give a variety of different MSOL formulations.
Some are based on explicitly encoding agreement forests, while some only use
them implicitly to generate the treewidth bound. Our formulations introduce a
number of &quot;phylogenetics MSOL primitives&quot; which will hopefully be of use to
other researchers.

which has been established as a reliable means for a wide variety of
applications, including molecular separation, detection, crystallization and
biosynthesis. Although atomic and molecular level consideration is a key
ingredient in experimental design and fabrication of nanfluidic systems, atomic
and molecular modeling of nanofluidics is rare and most simulations at
nanoscale are restricted to one- or two-dimensions in the literature, to our
best knowledge. The present work introduces atomic scale design and
three-dimensional (3D) simulation of ionic diffusive nanofluidic systems. We
propose a variational multiscale framework to represent the nanochannel in
discrete atomic and/or molecular detail while describe the ionic solution by
continuum. Apart from the major electrostatic and entropic effects, the
non-electrostatic interactions between the channel and solution, and among
solvent molecules are accounted in our modeling. We derive generalized
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for nanofluidic systems. Mathematical
algorithms, such as Dirichlet to Neumann mapping and the matched interface and
boundary (MIB) methods are developed to rigorously solve the aforementioned
equations to the second-order accuracy in 3D realistic settings. Three ionic
diffusive nanofluidic systems, including a negatively charged nanochannel, a
bipolar nanochannel and a double-well nanochannel are designed to investigate
the impact of atomic charges to channel current, density distribution and
electrostatic potential. Numerical findings, such as gating, ion depletion and
inversion, are in good agreements with those from experimental measurements and
numerical simulations in the literature.

miniature movements and do not stand perfectly still. Such fixational eye
movements (FEM) can be decomposed into at least two components: rapid
microsaccades and slow (physiological) drift. Despite the general agreement
that microsaccades have a central generating mechanism, the origin of drift is
less clear. A direct approach to investigate whether drift is also centrally
controlled or merely represents peripheral uncorrelated oculomotor noise is to
quantify the statistical dependence between the velocity components of the FEM.
Here we investigate the dependence between horizontal and vertical velocity
components across the eyes during a visual fixation task with human observers.
The results are compared with computer-generated surrogate time series
containing only drift or only microsaccades. Our analyses show a binocular
dependence between FEM velocity components predominantly due to drift. This
result supports the existence of a central generating mechanism that modulates
not only microsaccades but also drift and helps to explain the neuronal
mechanism generating FEM.

  Hidden Markov model</title><categories>q-bio.GN</categories><comments>9 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations which generate tumor cells
with different genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and
therapeutics, it is necessary to identify the clones in tumor sample
accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity by either
computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of
mutations. All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of
clonal frequencies, discarding clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we
propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor heterogeneity by predicting
clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific
genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic
location. We also tested our model on different simulated data. The results
shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent methods which infer tumor heterogeneity.
Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity research area.

binding sites such as the ends of microtubules or actin-filaments. A
localization of proteins on these functional sites is of great importance. We
present a quantitative theory for a diffusion and capture process, where
proteins diffuse on a filament and stop diffusing when reaching the filament's
end. It is found that end-association after one-dimensional diffusion is the
main source for tip-localization of such proteins. As a consequence, diffusion
and capture is highly efficient in enhancing the reaction velocity of enzymatic
reactions, where proteins and filament ends are to each other as enzyme and
substrate. We show that the reaction velocity can effectively be described
within a Michaelis-Menten framework. Together one-dimensional diffusion and
capture beats the (three-dimensional) Smoluchowski diffusion limit for the rate
of protein association to filament ends.

suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are crucial for the function of the circadian
timing system, which is characterized by the expression of the so-called clock
genes. Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ ions seem to connect, at least in part, the
electrical activity of SCN neurons with the expression of clock genes. In this
paper, we introduce a simple mathematical model describing the linking of
membrane activity to the transcription of one gene by means of a feedback
mechanism based on the dynamics of intracellular calcium ions.

(OCD) based on a generative model of cognition. The framework is constructed
using the new concept of a 'formal narrative' which is a sequence of cognitive
states inferred from sense data. First we propose that human cognition uses a
hierarchy of narratives to predict changes in the natural and social
environment. Each layer in the hierarchy represents a distinct 'view of the
world', but it also contributes to a global unitary perspective. Second, the
generative models used for cognitive inference can create new narratives from
those states already experienced by an individual. We hypothesise that when a
threat is recognised, narratives are generated as a cognitive model of possible
threat scenarios. Using this framework, we suggest that OCD arises from a
dysfunction in sub-surface levels of inference while the global unitary
perspective remains intact. The failure of inference is felt as the external
world being 'not just right', and its automatic correction by the perceptual
system is experienced as compulsion. Ordering and symmetry obsessions are the
effects of the perceptual system trying to achieve precise inference. Checking
behaviour arises because the security system attempts to finesse inference as
part of its protection behaviour. Similarly, fear of harm and distressing
thoughts occur because the failure of inference results in an indistinct view
of the past or the future. A wide variety of symptoms in OCD is thus explained
by a single dysfunction.

with only 4 equations in the context of describing
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic dynamics on heterogenous
networks. The super compact model is based on a new closure relation that
involves not only the average degree but also the second and third moments of
the degree distribution. Its derivation uses an a priori approximation of the
degree distribution of susceptible nodes in terms of the degree distribution of
the network. The new closure gives excellent agreement with heterogeneous
pairwise models that contain significantly more differential equations.

cross-platform, open-source software library for the simulation and analysis of
models \ expressed using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is the
most widely used standard for representing dynamic networks, especially
biochemical networks. libRoadRunner supports solution of both large models and
multiple replicas of a single model on desktop, mobile and cluster computers.
libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run both as a component
inside other tools via its C++ and C bindings andnteractively through its
Python interface. The Python Application Programming Interface (API) is similar
to the APIs of Matlab and SciPy, making it fast and easy to learn, even for new
users. libRoadRunner uses a custom Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler built on the
widely-used LLVM JIT compiler framework to compile SBML-specified models
directly into very fast native machine code for a variety of processors, making
it appropriate for solving very large models or multiple replicas of smaller
models. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of the SBML
specification (except for delay and nonlinear algebraic equations) and several
of its extensions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators,
as well as tools for steady-state, stability analyses and flux balance
analysis. We regularly update libRoadRunner binary distributions for Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows and license them under Apache License Version 2.0.
http://www.libroadrunner.org provides online documentation, full build
instructions, binaries and a git source repository.

accompanied by local sliding and/or stretching of the constituent filaments.
Yet the nature of the sliding friction between two aligned filaments
interacting through multiple contacts remains largely unexplored. Here, by
directly measuring the sliding forces between two bundled F-actin filaments, we
show that these frictional forces are unexpectedly large, scale logarithmically
with sliding velocity as in solid-like friction, and exhibit complex dependence
on the filaments' overlap length. We also show that a reduction of the
frictional force by orders of magnitude, associated with a transition from
solid-like friction to Stokes' drag, can be induced by coating F-actin with
polymeric brushes. Furthermore, we observe similar transitions in filamentous
microtubules and bacterial flagella. Our findings demonstrate how altering a
filament's elasticity, structure and interactions can be used to engineer
interfilament friction and thus tune the properties of fibrous composite
materials.

  Correlations</title><categories>q-bio.NC</categories><comments>30 pages</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Humans and other animals base their decisions on noisy sensory input. Much
work has therefore been devoted to understanding the computations that underly
such decisions. The problem has been studied in a variety of tasks and with
stimuli of differing complexity. However, the impact of correlations in sensory
noise on perceptual judgments is not well understood. Here we examine how
stimulus correlations together with correlations in sensory noise impact
decision making. As an example, we consider the task of detecting the presence
of a single or multiple targets amongst distractors. We assume that both the
distractors and the observer's measurements of the stimuli are correlated. The
computations of an optimal observer in this task are nontrivial, yet can be
analyzed and understood intuitively. We find that when distractors are strongly
correlated, measurement correlations can have a strong impact on performance.
When distractor correlations are weak, measurement correlations have little
impact, unless the number of stimuli is large. Correlations in neural responses
to structured stimuli can therefore strongly impact perceptual judgments.

The facts we
believe we know are based on a few intuitions about time, which are, in turn,
based on our conscious waking experiences. As far as I can tell, these
intuitions about time are something like this: 1) There is a physical world in
which events occur, 2) These events are mirrored by our perceptual re-creation
of them in essentially the same order in which they occur in the physical
world, 3) This re-creation of events occurs in a linear order based on our
conscious memory of them (e.g., event A is said to occur before event B if at
some point we do remember event A but we don not yet remember event B, and at
another point we remember both events), 4) Assuming we have good memories, what
we remember has occurred in the past and what we don not remember but we can
imagine might: a) never occur, b) occur when we are not conscious, or c) occur
in the future. These intuitions are excellent ones for understanding our
conscious conception of ordered events. However, they do not tell us anything
about how the non-conscious processes in our brains navigate events in time.
Currently, neuroscientists assume that neural processes of which we are
unaware, that is, non-conscious processes, create conscious awareness as a
reflection of physical reality (Singer, 2015). Thus, if we wish to understand
how events unfold in time in the physical world, we would do well to attempt to
get some hints about how these events are navigated by non-conscious processes.

cosmetic products and medicines -- and some of them might be toxic. However
testing the toxicity of all existing compounds by biological experiments is
neither financially nor logistically feasible. Therefore the government
agencies NIH, EPA and FDA launched the Tox21 Data Challenge within the
&quot;Toxicology in the 21st Century&quot; (Tox21) initiative. The goal of this challenge
was to assess the performance of computational methods in predicting the
toxicity of chemical compounds. State of the art toxicity prediction methods
build upon specifically-designed chemical descriptors developed over decades.
Though Deep Learning is new to the field and was never applied to toxicity
prediction before, it clearly outperformed all other participating methods. In
this application paper we show that deep nets automatically learn features
resembling well-established toxicophores. In total, our Deep Learning approach
won both of the panel-challenges (nuclear receptors and stress response) as
well as the overall Grand Challenge, and thereby sets a new standard in tox
prediction.

cross-covariance across related datasets of different dimensionality. There are
many potential applications of CCA to neuroimaging data analysis. For instance,
CCA can be used for finding functional similarities across fMRI datasets
collected from multiple subjects without resampling individual datasets to a
template anatomy. In this paper, we introduce Pyrcca, an open-source Python
module for executing CCA between two or more datasets. Pyrcca can be used to
implement CCA with or without regularization, and with or without linear or a
Gaussian kernelization of the datasets. We demonstrate an application of CCA
implemented with Pyrcca to neuroimaging data analysis. We use CCA to find a
data-driven set of functional response patterns that are similar across
individual subjects in a natural movie experiment. We then demonstrate how this
set of response patterns discovered by CCA can be used to accurately predict
subject responses to novel natural movie stimuli.

Biophysically, unidirectional motion of large number of motor proteins along a
single track can be described by totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
(TASEP). From which many meaningful properties, such as the appearance of
domain wall (defined as the borderline of high density and low density of motor
protein along motion track) and boundary layers, can be obtained. However, it
is biologically obvious that a single track may be occupied by different motor
species. So previous studies based on TASEP of one particle species are not
reasonable enough to find more detailed properties of the motion of motors
along a single track. To address this problem, TASEP with two particle species
is discussed in this study. Theoretical methods to get densities of each
particle species are provided. Using these methods, phase transition related
properties of particle densities are obtained. Our analysis show that domain
wall and boundary layer of single species densities always appear
simultaneously with those of the total particle density. The height of domain
wall of total particle density is equal to the summation of those of single
species. Phase diagrams for typical model parameters are also presented. The
methods presented in this study can be generalized to analyze TASEP with more
particle species.

resource for generating energy and recovering valuable by-products. The
complexity of the anaerobic digestion process has motivated the development of
complex models. However, this complexity makes it intractable to pin-point
stability and emergent behaviour. Here, the widely used Anaerobic Digestion
Model No. 1 (ADM1) has been reduced to its very backbone, a syntrophic
two-tiered microbial food chain and a slightly more complex three-tiered
microbial food web, with their stability analysed as function of the inflowing
substrate concentration and dilution rate. Parameterised for phenol and
chlorophenol degradation, steady-states were always stable and non-oscillatory.
Low input concentrations of chlorophenol were sufficient to maintain
chlorophenol- and phenol-degrading populations but resulted in poor conversion
and a hydrogen flux that was too low to sustain hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
The addition of hydrogen and phenol boosted the populations of all three
organisms, resulting in the counterintuitive phenomena that (i) the phenol
degraders were stimulated by adding hydrogen, even though hydrogen inhibits
phenol degradation, and (ii) the dechlorinators indirectly benefitted from
measures that stimulated their hydrogenotrophic competitors; both phenomena
hint at emergent behaviour.

landscape of modern genomics. A number of large scale projects aimed at
sequencing many human genomes are in progress. Genome sequencing also becomes
an important aid in the personalized medicine. One of the significant side
effects of this change is a necessity of storage and transfer of huge amounts
of genomic data. In this paper we deal with the problem of compression of large
collections of complete genomic sequences. We propose an algorithm that is able
to compress the collection of 1092 human diploid genomes about 9,500 times.
This result is about 4 times better than what is offered by the other existing
compressors. Moreover, our algorithm is very fast as it processes the data with
speed 200MB/s on a modern workstation. In a consequence the proposed algorithm
allows storing the complete genomic collections at low cost, e.g., the examined
collection of 1092 human genomes needs only about 700MB when compressed, what
can be compared to about 6.7 TB of uncompressed FASTA files. The source code is

  population dynamic models</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>18 pages, 4 figures</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Discrete-time models are the traditional approach for capturing population
dynamics of a host-parasitoid system. Recent work has introduced a
semi-discrete framework for obtaining model update functions that connect
host-parasitoid population levels from year-to-year. In particular, this
framework uses differential equations to describe the hosts-parasitoid
interaction during the time of year where they come in contact, allowing
specific behaviors to be mechanistically incorporated into the model. We use
the semi-discrete approach to study the effects of host-feeding, which occurs
when a parasitoid consumes a potential host larva without ovipositing. Our
results show that host-feeding by itself cannot stabilize the system, and both
the host and parasitoid populations exhibit diverging oscillations similar to
the Nicholson-Bailey model. However, when combined with other stabilizing
mechanisms such as density-dependent host mortality or density-dependent
parasitoid attack rate, host-feeding expands the region of parameter space that
allows for a stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. Finally, our results show that
host-feeding causes inefficiency in the parasitoid population, which yields a
higher population of hosts per generation. This suggests that host-feeding may
have limited long-term impact in terms of suppressing host levels for
biological control applications.

  loci</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>11 pages, 2 figures</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</license><abstract>  The origin and diversification of Sino-Tibetan populations have been a
long-standing hot debate. However, the limited genetic information of Tibetan
populations keeps this topic far from clear. In the present study, we genotyped
15 forensic autosomal STRs from 803 unrelated Tibetan individuals from Gansu
Province (635 from Gannan and 168 from Tianzhu). We combined these data with
published dataset to infer a detailed population affinities and admixture of
Sino-Tibetan populations. Our results revealed that the genetic structure of
Sino-Tibetan populations was strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations.
Although the among-population variances are relatively small, the genetic
components for Tibetan, Lolo-Burmese, and Han Chinese were quite distinctive,
especially for the Deng, Nu, and Derung of Lolo-Burmese. Southern indigenous
populations, such as Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien populations might have made
substantial genetic contribution to Han Chinese and Altaic populations, but not
to Tibetans. Likewise, Han Chinese but not Tibetan shared very similar genetic
makeups with Altaic populations, which did not support the North Asian origin
of Tibetan populations. The dataset generated here are also valuable for
forensic identification.

countries. TB can be contracted and spread by species other than cattle and
this can cause a problem for disease control. In the UK and Ireland, badgers
are a recognised reservoir of infection and there has been substantial
discussion about potential control strategies. We present a coupling of
individual based models of bovine TB in badgers and cattle, which aims to
capture the key details of the natural history of the disease and of both
species at approximately county scale. The model is spatially explicit it
follows a very large number of cattle and badgers on a different grid size for
each species and includes also winter housing. We show that the model can
replicate the reported dynamics of both cattle and badger populations as well
as the increasing prevalence of the disease in cattle. Parameter space used as
input in simulations was swept out using Latin hypercube sampling and
sensitivity analysis to model outputs was conducted using mixed effect models.
By exploring a large and computationally intensive parameter space we show that
of the available control strategies it is the frequency of TB testing and
whether or not winter housing is practised that have the most significant
effects on the number of infected cattle, with the effect of winter housing
becoming stronger as farm size increases. Whether badgers were culled or not
explained about 5%, while the accuracy of the test employed to detect infected
cattle explained less than 3% of the variance in the number of infected cattle.

a determinate and orchestrated procedure that often incorporates stochastic
mechanisms in order to diversify cell types. How these stochastic phenomena
interact to govern cell fate are poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate
decision making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of
differentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work,
we focus on the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to
trigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral
inhibition, i.e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling
between neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic
decisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e.g.~as ones found in the
regulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations,
attributed to micro-environmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and
extrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem. Our goal is to
elucidate how the induction of extrinsic noise affects cell fate specification
in a lateral inhibition mechanism. Using a stochastic Cellular Automaton with
continuous state space, we show that extrinsic noise results in the emergence
of steady-state furrow patterns of cells in a &quot;frustrated/transient&quot; phenotypic
state.

for performing inference in simulation-based models. However, due to the
difficulty in scaling likelihood estimates, ABC remains useful for relatively
low-dimensional problems. We introduce Hamiltonian ABC (HABC), a set of
likelihood-free algorithms that apply recent advances in scaling Bayesian
learning using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and stochastic gradients. We find
that a small number forward simulations can effectively approximate the ABC
gradient, allowing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently traverse parameter
spaces. We also describe a new simple yet general approach of incorporating
random seeds into the state of the Markov chain, further reducing the random
walk behavior of HABC. We demonstrate HABC on several typical ABC problems, and
show that HABC samples comparably to regular Bayesian inference using true
gradients on a high-dimensional problem from machine learning.

A critical evaluation

supported by two pillars of evidences. The first is the finding of the initial
fixation location on a word resembled a normal distribution (Rayner, 1979). The
other is the finding of a moderate slope coefficient between the launch site
and the landing site (b=0.49, see McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, &amp; Zola, 1988). Four
simulations on different saccade targeting strategies and one eye-movement
experiment of Chinese reading have been conducted to evaluate the two findings.
We demonstrated that the current understanding of the word-based account is not
conclusive by showing an alternative strategy of the word-based account and
identifying the problem with the calculation of the slope coefficient. Although
almost all the computational models of eye-movement control during reading have
built on the two findings, future efforts should be directed to understand the
precise contribution of different saccade targeting strategies, and to know how
their weighting might vary across desperate writing systems.

useful e.g. for enzyme induction, bet hedging, and epigenetic switching.
However, this phenomenon has mostly been described with deterministic dynamic
or well-mixed stochastic models. Here, we map known biological bistable systems
onto the well-characterized biochemical Schloegl model, using analytical
calculations and stochastic spatio-temporal simulations. In addition to network
architecture and strong thermodynamic driving away from equilibrium, we show
that bistability requires fine-tuning towards small cell volumes (or
compartments) and fast protein diffusion (well mixing). Bistability is thus
fragile and hence may be restricted to small bacteria and eukaryotic nuclei,
with switching triggered by volume changes during the cell cycle. For large
volumes, single cells generally loose their ability for bistable switching and
instead undergo a first-order phase transition.

imaging and heating therapies, its application for neuromodulation is
relatively new and not well understood. The objective of the present study was
to investigate issues related to interactions between focused acoustic beams
and brain tissues to better understand possible limitations of transcranial
ultrasound for neuromodulation. Approach. A computational model of transcranial
focused ultrasound was constructed and validated against bench top experimental
data. The models were then incrementally extended to address and investigate a
number of issues related to the use of ultrasound for neuromodulation. These
included the effect of variations in skull geometry and gyral anatomy, as well
as the effect of transmission across multiple tissue and media layers, such as
scalp, skull, CSF, and gray/white matter on ultrasound insertion behavior. In
addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to characterize the influence of
acoustic properties of intracranial tissues. Finally, the heating associated
with ultrasonic stimulation waveforms designed for neuromodulation was modeled.
Main results. Depending on factors such as acoustic frequency, the insertion
behavior of a transcranial focused ultrasound beam is only subtly influenced by
the geometry and acoustic properties of the underlying tissues. Significance.
These issues are critical for the refinement of device design and the overall
advancement of ultrasound methods for noninvasive neuromodulation.

anatomically connected forming larger networks which perform cognitive tasks.
The cat cerebral cortex is composed of 65 areas organised into the visual,
auditory, somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic cognitive regions. We have built
a network of networks, in which networks are connected among themselves
according to the connections observed in the cat cortical areas aiming to study
how inputs drive the synchronous behaviour in this cat brain-like network. We
show that without external perturbations it is possible to observe high level
of bursting synchronisation between neurons within almost all areas, except for
the auditory area. Bursting synchronisation appears between neurons in the
auditory region when an external perturbation is applied in another cognitive
area. This is a clear evidence that pattern formation and collective behaviour
in the brain might be a process mediated by other brain areas under
stimulation.

synchronisation in a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Neuron plasticity is a
flexible property of a neuron and its network to change temporarily or
permanently their biochemical, physiological, and morphological
characteristics, in order to adapt to the environment. Regarding the
plasticity, we consider Hebbian rules, specifically for spike timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP), and with regard to network, we consider that the connections
are randomly distributed. We analyse the synchronisation and desynchronisation
according to an input level and probability of connections. Moreover, we verify
that the transition for synchronisation depends on the neuronal network
architecture, and the external perturbation level.

defined for a genome, one for each amino acid (valgram is an a^2gram for
valine; alagram is an a^2gram for alanine and so on). They provide information
about the distribution and occurrence of the investigated amino acid. In
particular, the metgram can be used to find out potential start position of
genes within a genome. This approach can help implementing a new diagnosis test
for genetic diseases by providing a type of DNA-medical imaging.

known, the DNA mapping into proteins remains as one of the relevant discoveries
of genetics. However, modern genomic signal processing usually requires
converting symbolic-DNA strings into complex-valued signals in order to take
full advantage of a broad variety of digital processing techniques. The genetic
code is revisited in this paper, addressing alternative representations for it,
which can be worthy for genomic signal processing. Three original
representations are discussed. The inner-to-outer map builds on the unbalanced
role of nucleotides of a 'codon' and it seems to be suitable for handling
information-theory-based matter. The two-dimensional-Gray map representation is
offered as a mathematically structured map that can help interpreting
spectrograms or scalograms. Finally, the world-map representation for the
genetic code is investigated, which can particularly be valuable for
educational purposes -besides furnishing plenty of room for application of
distance-based algorithms.

ecosystems and of individual and collective human behavior. Key components of
the social-ecological system are often over-simplified or omitted. Generalized
modeling is a dynamical systems approach that can overcome some of these
challenges. It can analyze qualitative system dynamics such as regime shifts
despite incomplete knowledge of the model's constituent processes, but has been
used primarily in theoretical contexts. Here, we review generalized modeling
and use a recent study on the Baltic cod fishery's boom and collapse to
demonstrate its application to modeling the dynamics of empirical
social-ecological systems. These empirical applications demand new methods of
analysis suited to larger, more complicated generalized models than is common
in theoretical contexts. Generalized modeling is a promising tool, in both
participatory and research settings, for rapidly developing mathematically
rigorous, process-based understanding of a social-ecological system's dynamics
despite limited knowledge of the system.

linear kernel through which stimuli are filtered before they are further
processed. If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward
cascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'
profile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many
feedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones
representing the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents
are generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore
constitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the
input/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive
field. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from
spike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from
nearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filtering
all input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only external
stimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical
properties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike
generation, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the
external stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that
spike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass
processing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators. For strong
feedback, a sharp resonance in the spectral neuronal selectivity may appear.
Our results provide a unified framework to interpret a collection of previous
experimental studies where specific feedback mechanisms were shown to modify
the filtering properties of neurons.

riders would otherwise take over. It is well known that sanctioning systems,
such as the police and courts, are costly and thus can suffer from those who
free ride on other's efforts to maintain the sanctioning systems (second-order
free riders). Previous game-theory studies showed that if populations are very
large, pool punishment rarely emerges in public good games, even when
participation is optional, because of second-order free riders. Here we show
that a matching fund for rewarding cooperation leads to the emergence of pool
punishment, despite the presence of second-order free riders. We demonstrate
that reward funds can pave the way for a transition from a population of free
riders to a population of pool punishers. A key factor in promoting the
transition is also to reward those who contribute to pool punishment, yet not
abstaining from participation. Reward funds eventually vanish in raising pool
punishment, which is sustainable by punishing the second-order free riders.
This suggests that considering the interdependence of reward and punishment may
help to better understand the origins and transitions of social norms and
institutions.

intermediate filaments about 10 nm in diameter; most likely, these filaments
are the channels providing light transmission to photoreceptor cells in
mammalian and avian retinas. We interpret transmission of light in such
channels using the notions of quantum confinement, describing energy transport
in structures with electro-conductive walls and diameter much smaller than the
wavelength of the respective photons. Model calculations produce photon
transmission efficiency in such channels exceeding 0.8, in optimized geometry.
We infer that protein molecules make up the channels, proposing a qualitative
mechanism of light transmission by such structures.

data have shown that depletion forces display different signatures depending on
the orientation of these particles. It has been shown that axial attraction of
two rods yields contractile forces of 0.1pN that are independent of the
relative axial shift of the two rods. Here, we measured depletion-caused
interactions of actin bundles extending the phase space of single pairs of rods
to a multi-particle system. In contrast to a filament pair, we found forces up
to 3pN . Upon bundle relaxation forces decayed exponentially with a mean decay
time of 3.4s . These different dynamics are explained within the frame of a
mathematical model by taking pairwise interactions to a multi-filament scale.
The macromolecular content employed for our experiments is well below the
crowding of cells. Thus, we propose that arising forces can contribute to
biological force generation without the need to convert chemical energy into
mechanical work.

bioinformatics analysis, data generation is one aspect that is increasing at a
concomitant rate. The burden associated with processing large amounts of
sequencing data has emphasised the need to allocate sufficient computing
resources to complete analyses in the shortest possible time with manageable
and predictable costs. A novel method for predicting time to completion for a
popular bioinformatics software (QIIME), was developed using key variables
characteristic of the input data assumed to impact processing time. Multiple
Linear Regression models were developed to determine run time for two denoising
algorithms and a general bioinformatics pipeline. The models were able to
accurately predict clock time for denoising sequences from a naturally
assembled community dataset, but not an artificial community. Speedup and
efficiency tests for AmpliconNoise also highlighted that caution was needed
when allocating resources for parallel processing of data. Accurate modelling
of computational processing time using easily measurable predictors can assist
NGS analysts in determining resource requirements for bioinformatics software
and pipelines. Whilst demonstrated on a specific group of scripts, the
methodology can be extended to encompass other packages running on multiple
architectures, either in parallel or sequentially.

gradients of concentration of attractants and repellents in a process called
chemotaxis. The E. coli chemotaxis signaling pathway is a model for signal
transduction, but it has unique features. We demonstrate that the need for fast
signaling necessitates high abundances of the proteins involved in this
pathway. We show that further constraints on the abundances of chemotaxis
proteins arise from the requirements of self-assembly, both of flagellar motors
and of chemoreceptor arrays. All these constraints are specific to chemotaxis,
and published data confirm that chemotaxis proteins tend to be more highly
expressed than their homologs in other pathways. Employing a chemotaxis pathway
model, we show that the gain of the pathway at the level of the response
regulator CheY increases with overall chemotaxis protein abundances. This may
explain why, at least in one E. coli strain, the abundance of all chemotaxis
proteins is higher in media with lower nutrient content. We also demonstrate
that the E. coli chemotaxis pathway is particularly robust to abundance
variations of the motor protein FliM.

an approximation that resembles plants growing in pots, meaning that the total
soil volume is fixed. We propose a coupled water uptake-root growth model. A
one-dimensional model for water flux and water uptake by a root system growing
uniformly distributed in the soil is presented, and the Van Genuchten model for
the transport of water in soil is used. The governing equations are represented
by a moving boundary model for which the root length, as a function of time, is
prescribed. The solution of the model is obtained by front-fixing and finite
element methods. Model predictions for water uptake by a same plant growing in
loam, silt and clay soils are obtained and compared. A sensitivity analysis to
determine relative effects on water uptake when system parameters are changed
is also presented and shows that the model and numerical method proposed are
more sensitive to the root growth rate than to the rest of the parameters. This
sensitivity decreases along time, reaching its maximum at thirty days. A
comparison of this model with a fixed boundary model with and without root
growth is also made. The results show qualitative differences from the
beginning of the simulations, and quantitative differences after ten days of
simulations.

flavivirus. Unavailability of medication to cure the transmission in human
blood becomes a global health issue in recent decades. World epidemiologists
are encouraged to focus on inves- tigation toward an effective and inexpensive
way to prevent dengue transmission, i.e. mosquito control. In this paper, we
present a model depicting the dynamics of mosquito population based on
indoor-outdoor life cycle classification. The basic mosquito offspring number
is obtained and analysis of equilibria is shown. We bring along a discussion on
application of optimal control model which engineers two simultaneous schemes.
The first scheme is done by disseminating chemical like Temephos in spots where
eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the second scheme is done by conducting
fumigation through areas where adult mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as
well as outdoor. A version of gradient-based method is presented to set down a
workflow in minimizing the objective functional with respect to control
variable. Numerical results from analysis of the basic mosquito offspring
number with constant control and from optimal control suggest that one has to
enhance the usage of fumigation rather than Temephos. It is also suggested that
applying both control schemes simultaneously gives the most significant
reduction to the population.

of the yellow fever epidemic outbreak registered in Buenos Aires during the
year 1871 as compared to simulations of a stochastic population dynamics model.
This model incorporates the biology of the urban vector of yellow fever, the
mosquito Aedes aegypti, the stages of the disease in the human being as well as
the spatial extension of the epidemic outbreak. After introducing the
historical context and the restrictions it puts on initial conditions and
ecological parameters, we discuss the general features of the simulation and
the dependence on initial conditions and available sites for breeding the
vector. We discuss the sensitivity, to the free parameters, of statistical
estimators such as: final death toll, day of the year when the outbreak reached
half the total mortality and the normalized daily mortality, showing some
striking regularities. The model is precise and accurate enough to discuss the
truthfulness of the presently accepted historic discussions of the epidemic
causes, showing that there are more likely scenarios for the historic facts.

information encoded in genes, which is initiated by the binding of RNA
polymerase to related promoter. Experiments have found that the nucleotide
sequence of promoter has great influence on gene expression strength, or
promoter activity. In synthetic biology, one interesting question is how we can
synthesize a promoter with given activity, and which positions of promoter
sequence are important for determining its activity. In this study, based on
recent experimental data, correlations between promoter activity and its
sequence positions are analyzed by various methods. Our results show that,
except nucleotides in the two highly conserved regions, $-35$ box and $-10$
box, influences of nucleotides in other positions are also not neglectable. For
example, modifications of nucleotides around position $-19$ in spacing region
may change promoter activity in a large scale. The results of this study might
be helpful to our understanding of biophysical mechanism of gene transcription,
and may also be helpful to the design of synthetic cell factory.

gene tree and species tree the possible lists of branches of the species tree
on which the gene tree coalescences take place. Properties of the number of
coalescent histories for gene trees and species trees affect a variety of
probabilistic calculations in mathematical phylogenetics. Exact and asymptotic
evaluations of the number of coalescent histories, however, are known only in a
limited number of cases. Here we introduce a particular family of species
trees, the \emph{lodgepole} species trees $(\lambda_n)_{n\geq 0}$, in which
tree $\lambda_n$ has $m=2n+1$ taxa. We determine the number of coalescent
histories for the lodgepole species trees, in the case that the gene tree
matches the species tree, showing that this number grows with $m!!$ in the
number of taxa $m$. This computation demonstrates the existence of tree
families in which the growth in the number of coalescent histories is faster
than exponential. Further, it provides a substantial improvement on the lower
bound for the ratio of the largest number of matching coalescent histories to
the smallest number of matching coalescent histories for trees with $m$ taxa,
increasing a previous bound of $(\sqrt{\pi} / 32)[(5m-12)/(4m-6)] m \sqrt{m}$
to $[ \sqrt{m-1}/(4 \sqrt{e}) ]^{m}$. We discuss the implications of our
enumerative results for phylogenetic computations.

Age groups between 80-95 have lower percentage of survival rate.

pressure, re- cent work has shown that pressure stabilizes the formation of
isolated {\alpha}-helices. However all simulations to date have obtained a
qualitatively opposite result within the experimen- tal pressure range. We show
that using a protein force field (Amber03w) parametrized in conjunction with an
accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) recovers the correct pressure- dependence and
an overall stability diagram for helix formation similar to that from experi-
ment; on the other hand, we confirm that using TIP3P water results in a very
weak pressure destabilization of helices. By carefully analyzing the
contributing factors, we show that this is not merely a consequence of
different peptide conformations sampled using TIP3P. Rather, there is a
critical role for the solvent itself in determining the dependence of total
system volume (peptide and solvent) on helix content. Helical peptide
structures exclude a smaller volume to water, relative to non-helical
structures with both the water models, but the total system volume for helical
conformations is higher than non-helical conformations with TIP3P water at low
to intermediate pressures, in contrast to TIP4P/2005 water. Our results further
emphasize the importance of using an accurate water model to study protein
folding under conditions away from standard temperature and pressure.

layered structure whose thickness varies little across species. However,
selection pressures over evolutionary time scales have led to cortices that
have a large surface area to volume ratio in some organisms, with the result
that the brain is strongly convoluted into sulci and gyri. Here we show that
the gyrification can arise as a nonlinear consequence of a simple mechanical
instability driven by tangential expansion of the gray matter constrained by
the white matter. A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel
captures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain
treated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri
similar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a
function of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with
brain size), and are consistent with observations of a wide range of brains,
ranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two
simple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to
qualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical
anomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia.

[Epub ahead of print]</comments><doi>10.1007/s00422-014-0641-3</doi><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Early brain connectivity development consists of multiple stages: birth of
neurons, their migration and the subsequent growth of axons and dendrites. Each
stage occurs within a certain period of time depending on types of neurons and
cortical layers. Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons
starting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at
different time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial
properties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore the extreme cases of axon
formation especially concerning short-distance connectivity during early
development, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i.e.
maximally-overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one
neuron after another (serial, i.e. no overlaps in time windows). For both
cases, the number of potential and established synapses remained comparable.
Topological and spatial properties, however, differed: neurons that started
axon growth early on in serial growth achieved higher out-degrees, higher local
efficiency, and longer axon lengths while neurons demonstrated more homogeneous
connectivity patterns for parallel growth. Second, connection probability
decreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than
for serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for
parallel growth. Finally, we tested our predictions with C. elegans data.
Together, this indicates that time windows for axon growth influence the
topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks opening the possibility
to a posteriori estimate developmental mechanisms based on network properties
of a developed network.

lengths between two phylogenetic trees that have the same topology and contain
the same set of taxa. This method scales both trees to a total length of 1 and
sums up the differences for each branch. Compared to previous methods, ours
yields a fully symmetrical score that measures proportionality without being
affected by scale. We call this score the normalized tree distance (NTD). Based
on real data, we demonstrate that NTD scores are distributed unimodally, in a
manner similar to a lognormal distribution. The NTD score can be used to, for
example, detect co-evolutionary processes and measure the accuracy of branch
length estimates.

To
shed new light on this long-standing conundrum, we study the influence of

the framework of the hydrophobic-polar (HP) lattice protein model. By employing
large scale Wang-Landau simulations combined with suitable Monte Carlo trial
moves we show that, even though knots are still abundant on average, sequence
introduces large variability in the degree of self-entanglements. Moreover, we
are able to design sequences which are either almost always or almost never
knotted. Our findings serve as proof of concept that the introduction of just
one additional degree of freedom per monomer (in our case sequence) facilitates
evolution towards a protein universe in which knots are rare.

Despite the routine prescription of rate control therapy for
atrial fibrillation (AF), clinical evidence demonstrating a heart rate target
is lacking. Aim of the present study was to run a mathematical model simulating
AF episodes with a different heart rate (HR) to predict hemodynamic parameters
for each situation.
  Methods. The lumped model, representing the pumping heart together with
systemic and pulmonary circuits, was run to simulate AF with HR of 50, 70, 90,
110 and 130 bpm, respectively.
  Results. Left ventricular pressure increased by 56.7%, from 33.92+-37.56 mmHg
to 53.15+-47.56 mmHg, and mean systemic arterial pressure increased by 27.4%,
from 82.66+-14.04 mmHg to 105.29+-7.63 mmHg, at the 50 and 130 bpm simulations,
respectively. Stroke volume (from 77.45+-8.5 to 39.09+-8.08 mL), ejection
fraction (from 61.1+-4.4 to 39.32+-5.42%) and stroke work (SW, from 0.88+-0.04
to 0.58+-0.09 J) decreased by 49.5, 35.6 and 34.2%, at the 50 and 130 bpm
simulations, respectively. In addition, oxygen consumption indexes (rate
pressure product, RPP, tension time index per minute, TTI/min, and pressure
volume area per minute, PVA/min) increased from the 50 to the 130 bpm
simulation, respectively, by 185.7% (from 5598+-1939 to 15995+-3219 mmHg/min),
55.5% (from 2094+-265 to 3257+-301 mmHg s/min) and 102.4% (from 57.99+-17.9 to
117.37+-25.96 J/min). In fact, left ventricular efficiency (SW/PVA) decreased
from 80.91+-2.91% at 50 bpm to 66.43+-3.72% at the 130 bpm HR simulation.
  Conclusion. Awaiting compulsory direct clinical evidences, the present
mathematical model suggests that lower HRs during permanent AF relates to
improved hemodynamic parameters, cardiac efficiency, and lower oxygen
consumption.

various oscillating states by investigating p53-Wnt model. The variation in
Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to
different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even
to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin concentration in Wnt could able
to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled

approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and Gsk3 interaction

and hyper-connectivity in brains of individuals having autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain subnetworks in
high-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing of a movie containing
social cues and interactions. Methods: Thirteen subjects with ASD and 13
matched-pair controls watched a 68 minutes movie during functional magnetic
resonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson`s correlation between
haemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels. From the
whole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level
subnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between
all subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure
of each subnetwork. Additional 27 individuals with ASD from the ABIDE
resting-state database were included to test the reproducibility of the
results. Results: Between-group differences were observed in the composition of
default-mode and a ventro-temporal-limbic (VTL) subnetwork. The VTL subnetwork
included amygdala, striatum, thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior
temporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs
correlated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with
autism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in
the reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Conclusions:
Reorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the
mixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the
functional organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of
inter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures across all
participants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of ventro-temporal and
limbic systems in autism.

uncertainty, and accommodating this uncertainty is an important component of
modern phylogenetic comparative analysis. The birth-death polytomy resolver is
a method of accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty that places missing
(unsampled) taxa onto phylogenetic trees, using taxonomic information alone.
Recent studies of birds and mammals have used this approach to generate
pseudo-posterior distributions of phylogenetic trees that are complete at the
species level, even in the absence of genetic data for many species. Many
researchers have used these distributions of phylogenies for downstream
evolutionary analyses that involve inferences on phenotypic evolution,
geography, and community assembly. I demonstrate that the use of phylogenies
constructed in this fashion is inappropriate for many questions involving
traits. Because species are placed on trees at random with respect to trait
values, the birth-death polytomy resolver breaks down natural patterns of trait
phylogenetic structure. Inferences based on these trees are predictably and
often drastically biased in a direction that depends on the underlying (true)
pattern of phylogenetic structure in traits. I illustrate the severity of the
phenomenon for both continuous and discrete traits using examples from a global
bird phylogeny.

common bioinformatics tools produce scores that can reflect the binding

not directly comparable between different transcription factors. Here, we
provide two different ways to find the scaling parameter $\lambda$ that allows
us to infer binding energy from a PWM score. The first approach uses a PWM and
background genomic sequence as input to estimate $\lambda$ for a specific
transcription factor, which we applied to show that $\lambda$ distributions for
different transcription factor families correspond with their DNA binding
properties. Our second method can reliably convert $\lambda$ between different
PWMs of the same transcription factor, which allows us to directly compare PWMs
that were generated by different approaches. These two approaches provide
consistent and computationally efficient ways to scale PWMs scores and estimate
transcription factor binding sites strength.

associated to rising temperatures and ecosystem overexploitation, leading to
catastrophic shifts on short time scales. Remediation scenarios capable of
counterbalancing these effects involve geoengineering, sustainable practices
and carbon sequestration, among others. None of these scenarios seems powerful
enough to achieve the desired restoration of safe boundaries. We hypothesise
that synthetic organisms with the appropriate engineering design could be used
to safely prevent declines in some stressed ecosystems and help improving
carbon sequestration. Such schemes would include engineering mutualistic
dependencies preventing undesired evolutionary processes. We hypothesise that
some particular design principles introduce unescapable constraints to the
engineered organisms that act as effective firewalls. Testing this designed
organisms can be achieved by using controlled bioreactor models and accurate
computational models including different scales (from genetic constructs and
metabolic pathways to population dynamics). Our hypothesis heads towards a
future anthropogenic action that should effectively act as Terraforming agents.
It also implies a major challenge in the existing biosafety policies, since we
suggest release of modified organisms as potentially necessary strategy for
success.

the challenge of migrating towards a target despite noisy information on the
target position. Here we discuss optimal search strategies for a chaser that
moves by switching between two phases of motion (&quot;run&quot; and &quot;tumble&quot;),
reorienting itself towards the target during tumble phases, and performing a
persistent random walk during run phases. We show that the chaser average run
time can be adjusted to minimize the target catching time or the spatial
dispersion of the chasers. We obtain analytical results for the catching time
and for the spatial dispersion in the limits of small and large ratios of run
time to tumble time, and scaling laws for the optimal run times. Our findings
have implications for optimal chemotactic strategies in animal cell migration.

the assessment of treatment efficacy essentially relies on the time-to-death
and the kinetics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Joint modelling has been
increasingly used to characterize the relationship between a time-to-event and
a biomarker kinetics but numerical difficulties often limit this approach to
linear models. Here we evaluated by simulation the capability of a new feature
of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm in Monolix
to estimate the parameters of a joint model where PSA kinetics was defined by a
mechanistic nonlinear mixed-effect model. The design of the study and the
parameter values were inspired from one arm of a clinical trial. Increasingly
high levels of association between PSA and survival were considered and results
were compared with those found using two simplified alternatives to joint
model, a two-stage and a joint sequential model. We found that joint model
allowed for a precise estimation of all longitudinal and survival parameters.
In particular the effect of PSA kinetics on survival could be precisely
estimated, regardless of the strength of the association. In contrast, both
simplified approaches led to bias on longitudinal parameters and two-stage
model systematically underestimated the effect of PSA kinetics on survival. In
summary we showed that joint model can be used to characterize the relationship
between a nonlinear kinetics and survival. This opens the way for the use of
more complex and physiological models to improve treatment evaluation and
prediction in oncology.

intracellular parasitic bacterium Wolbachia in populations of the vector Aedes
aegypti, is presently one of the most promising tools for eliminating dengue,
in the absence of an efficient vaccine. The success of this operation requires
locally careful planning to determine the adequate number of individuals
carrying the Wolbachia parasite that need to be introduced into the natural
population. The introduced mosquitoes are expected to eventually replace the
Wolbachia-free population and guarantee permanent protection against the
transmission of dengue to human.
  In this study, we propose and analyze a model describing the fundamental
aspects of the competition between mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia and mosquitoes
free of the parasite. We then use feedback control techniques to devise an
introduction protocol which is proved to guarantee that the population
converges to a stable equilibrium where the totality of mosquitoes carry
Wolbachia.

of parsimonious evolutionary scenarios for gene adjacencies, from pairs of
reconciled gene trees. Following the approach pioneered by Sturmfels and
Pachter, we describe how to modify the DeCo dynamic programming algorithm to
identify classes of cost schemes that generates similar parsimonious
evolutionary scenarios for gene adjacencies, as well as the robustness to
changes to the cost scheme of evolutionary events of the presence or absence of
specific ancestral gene adjacencies. We apply our method to six thousands
mammalian gene families, and show that computing the robustness to changes to
cost schemes provides new and interesting insights on the evolution of gene
adjacencies and the DeCo model.

the molecular dynamics method. A DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in water
solution with the alkali metal counterions Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$, and Cs$^{+}$ has
been simulated. The systems have been considered in the regimes without excess
salt and with different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or CsCl) added. The results
have showed that the Na$^{+}$ counterions interact with the phosphate groups
directly from outside of the double helix and via water molecules at the top
edge of DNA minor groove. The potassium ions are mostly localized in the
grooves of the double helix, and the cesium ions penetrate deeply inside the
minor groove being bonded directly to the atoms of nucleic bases. Due to the
electrostatic repulsion the chlorine ions tend to be localized at large
distances from the DNA polyanion, but some Cl$^{-}$ anions have been detected
near atomic groups of the double helix forming electrically neutral pairs with
counterions already condensed on DNA. The DNA sites, where counterions are
incorporated, are characterized by local changes of double helix structure. The
lifetime of Na$^{+}$ and K$^{+}$ in complex with DNA atomic groups is less than
0.5 ns, while in the case of the cesium ions it may reach several nanoseconds.
In this time scale, the Cs$^{+}$ counterions form a structured system of
charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as ionic lattice.

  landscapes</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Having a precise knowledge of the dispersal ability of a population in a
heterogeneous environment is of critical importance in agroecology and
conservation biology as it can provide management tools to limit the effects of
pests or to increase the survival of endangered species. In this paper, we
propose a mechanistic-statistical method to estimate space-dependent diffusion
parameters of spatially-explicit models based on stochastic differential
equations, using genetic data. Dividing the total population into
subpopulations corresponding to different habitat patches with known allele
frequencies, the expected proportions of individuals from each subpopulation at
each position is computed by solving a system of reaction-diffusion equations.
Modelling the capture and genotyping of the individuals with a statistical
approach, we derive a numerically tractable formula for the likelihood function
associated with the diffusion parameters.
  In a simulated environment made of three types of regions, each associated
with a different diffusion coefficient, we successfully estimate the diffusion
parameters with a maximum-likelihood approach. Although higher genetic
differentiation among subpopulations leads to more accurate estimations, once a
certain level of differentiation has been reached, the finite size of the
genotyped population becomes the limiting factor for accurate estimation.

project having as its goal to develop dynamic models of the brain network
involved in aggressive behavior. In this way, the complex neural process
correlated to basic anger emotions and resulting in aggressive behaviors is
purportedly schematized by the use of Petri nets, a work-flow computational
tool. Initially, the modeling technique is introduced taking into account the
most recent and accepted notion of the neural substrates of emotions,
particularly the brain structures involved in the aggression neural network,
including their inputs, outputs, and internal connectivity. In order to
optimally represent these structures, their connections, and temporal dynamics,
the Petri net foundations employed in the simulation theory are defined.
Finally, the model and dynamic simulation of the neural process associated with
aggressive behavior is presented and evaluated as a feasible in silico
experimental support of the Patterned-Process Theory.

  by Improved Variational Linear Regression</title><categories>q-bio.QM q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Bayesian approaches to variable selection have been widely used for
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for that aim are often difficult to be implemented for
high-dimensional variable selection problems, such as the ones arising in
epistatic analysis. Variational approximation is an alternative to MCMC, and
variational linear regression (VLR) is an effective solution for the variable
selection problems, but lacks accuracy in some QTL mapping problems where there
are many more variables than samples. In this paper, we propose an effective
method with aim to improve the accuracy of VLR in the case of above by
dynamically reducing components (variable or markers) with known effects (zero
or fixed). We show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of
VLR with little increase in computational cost. The method is compared with
several other variational methods used for QTL mapping, and simulation results
show that its performance is higher than those methods when applied in
high-dimensional cases.

tree coalescences can take place, and their enumerative properties assist in
understanding the computational complexity of calculations central in the study
of gene trees and species trees. Here, we solve an enumerative problem left
open by Rosenberg (IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and
Bioinformatics 10: 1253-1262, 2013) concerning the number of coalescent
histories for gene trees and species trees with a matching labeled topology
that belongs to a generic caterpillar-like family. By bringing a generating
function approach to the study of coalescent histories, we prove that for any
caterpillar-like family with seed tree $t$, the sequence $(h_n)_{n\geq 0}$
describing the number of matching coalescent histories of the $n$th tree of the
family grows asymptotically as a constant multiple of the Catalan numbers.
Thus, $h_n \sim \beta_t c_n$, where the asymptotic constant $\beta_t &gt; 0$
depends on the shape of the seed tree $t$. The result extends a claim
demonstrated only for seed trees with at most 8 taxa to arbitrary seed trees,
expanding the set of cases for which detailed enumerative properties of
coalescent histories can be determined. We introduce a procedure that computes
from $t$ the constant $\beta_t$ as well as the algebraic expression for the
generating function of the sequence $(h_n)_{n\geq 0}$.

technology for functional brain mapping, measuring the magnetic fields due to
the intracellular neuronal current flow in the brain. However, most often, the
inherent level of noise in the MEG sensor data collection process is large
enough to obscure the signal(s) of interest. In this paper, a denoising
technique based on the wavelet transform and the multiresolution signal
decomposition technique along with thresholding is presented, substantiated by
application results. Thereafter, different frequency analysis are performed on
the denoised MEG signals to identify the major frequencies of the brain
oscillations present in the denoised signals. Time-frequency plots
(spectrograms) of the denoised signals are also provided.

yeast by comparing them to an unselected pool of random individuals. Here we
re-examine data on individual F12 progeny selected for heat tolerance, which
have been genotyped at 25 locations identified by sequencing a selected pool
[Parts, L., Cubillos, F. A., Warringer, J., Jain, K., Salinas, F., Bumpstead,
S. J., Molin, M., Zia, A., Simpson, J. T., Quail, M. A., Moses, A., Louis, E.
J., Durbin, R., and Liti, G. (2011). Genome research, 21(7), 1131-1138]. 960
individuals were genotyped at these locations and multi-locus genotype
frequencies were compared to 172 sequenced individuals from the original
unselected pool (a control group). Various non-random associations were found
across the genome, both within chromosomes and between chromosomes. Some of the
non-random associations are likely due to retention of linkage disequilibrium
in the F12 population, however many, including the inter-chromosomal
interactions, must be due to genetic interactions in heat tolerance. One region
of particular interest involves 3 linked loci on chromosome IV where the
central variant responsible for heat tolerance is antagonistic, coming from the
heat sensitive parent and the flanking ones are from the more heat tolerant
parent. The 3-locus haplotypes in the selected individuals represent a highly
biased sample of the population haplotypes with rare double recombinants in
high frequency. These were missed in the original analysis and would never be
seen without the multigenerational approach. We show that a statistical
analysis of entropy and information gain in genotypes of a selected population
can reveal further interactions than previously seen. Importantly this must be
done in comparison to the unselected population's genotypes to account for
inherent biases in the original population.

methods for biomolecular flexibility analysis. However, the systematic
generalization of the GNM has been elusive. We show that the GNM Kirchhoff
matrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter, which is a special case of
a wide class of correlation functions underpinning the linear scaling
flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) method. Based on the mathematical structure of
correlation functions, we propose a unified framework to construct generalized
Kirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to correlation function based
GNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of the diagonal elements gives rise to FRI
method. We illustrate that correlation function based GNMs outperform the
original GNM in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins. We
demonstrate that for any given correlation function, FRI and GNM methods
provide essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the
correlation function is sufficiently large.

The two classical forces of evolution are
mutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution can be
predicted based solely on the fitness differences between phenotypes.
Predicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation rates as well as
varying fitness is still an open question. Experimental procedures, however, do
include these complexities along with fluctuating population sizes and
stochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate the mutational path
probabilities of systems having epistatic effects on both fitness and mutation
rates using a theoretical and computational framework. In contrast to previous
models, we do not limit ourselves to the typical strong selection, weak
mutation (SSWM)-regime or to fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic
interactions to also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively
non-trivial dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can
overcome fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential
to extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation and bring us
closer to what is observed in experimental systems.

slips. Small inhomogeneity (mismatch in the intrinsic firing rate of the
neurons) can stabilize the phase locking and lead to more precise relative
spike timing of the two neurons. The results can explain how for a class of
neuronal models, including leaky integrate-?re model, inhomogeneity can
increase correlation of spike trains when the neurons are synaptically

starting from laboratory experiments on the behavior of two ant species, the
invasive Lasius neglectus and the authocthonus Lasius paralienus. This work is
mainly motivated by the need to have realistic models to predict the
interaction dynamics of invasive species. The two considered species exhibit
different fighting strategies. In order to describe the observed battle
dynamics, we start by building a chemical model considering the ants and the
fighting groups (for instance two ants of a species and one of the other one)
as a chemical species. From the chemical equations we deduce a system of
differential equations, whose parameters are estimated by minimizing the
difference between the experimental data and the model output. We model the
fluctuations observed in the experiments by means of a standard Gillespie
algorithm. In order to better reproduce the observed behavior, we adopt a
spatial agent-based model, in which ants not engaged in fighting groups move
randomly (diffusion) among compartments, and the Gillespie algorithm is used to
model the reactions inside a compartment.

risk of occurrence increases until old age. Here we present a novel
computational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the
lifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are framed
in a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To
decrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate
recent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since
evidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of
glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem
cell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our
model. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual
demographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts
for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,
without the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the
population. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by
randomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.
Based on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)
decrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate
during aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests
that different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to
tumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are
sufficient for the formation of glioma.

attached to subchondral bones shaped as elliptic paraboloids is considered in
the framework of the biphasic cartilage model. The main novelty of the study is
in accounting not only for the normal (vertical), but also for tangential
vertical (horisontal) displacements of the contacting surfaces. Exact general
relationships have been established between the contact approach and some
integral characteristics of the contact pressure, including the contact force.
Asymptotic representations for the contact pressure integral characteristics
are obtained in terms of the contact approach and some integral characteristics
of the contact zone. The main result is represented by the first-order
approximation problem.

  topology</title><categories>cs.GT physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE</categories><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  Evolutionary game theory is used to model the evolution of competing
strategies in a population of players. Evolutionary stability of a strategy is
a dynamic equilibrium, in which any competing mutated strategy would be wiped
out from a population. If a strategy is weak evolutionarily stable, the
competing strategy may manage to survive within the network. Understanding the
network-related factors that affect the evolutionary stability of a strategy
would be critical in making accurate predictions about the behaviour of a
strategy in a real-world strategic decision making environment. In this work,
we evaluate the effect of network topology on the evolutionary stability of a
strategy. We focus on two well-known strategies known as the Zero-determinant
strategy and the Pavlov strategy. Zero-determinant strategies have been shown
to be evolutionarily unstable in a well-mixed population of players. We
identify that the Zero-determinant strategy may survive, and may even dominate
in a population of players connected through a non-homogeneous network. We
introduce the concept of `topological stability' to denote this phenomenon. We
argue that not only the network topology, but also the evolutionary process
applied and the initial distribution of strategies are critical in determining
the evolutionary stability of strategies. Further, we observe that topological
stability could affect other well-known strategies as well, such as the general
cooperator strategy and the cooperator strategy. Our observations suggest that
the variation of evolutionary stability due to topological stability of
strategies may be more prevalent in the social context of strategic evolution,
in comparison to the biological context.

models of the Usher or Lefkovitch types and a simpler model, the pseudo-Leslie
model. The pseudo Leslie model is a matrix that can be decomposed in a row
matrix, which is not necessarily non-negative and a subdiagonal positive
matrix. This technique has computational advantages, since the solutions of the
iterative problem using Leslie matrices are readily obtained . In the case of
two age structured population models, one Lefkovitch and another Leslie, the
Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies are different, despite the same growth ratio of both
models. We prove that Markov matrices associated to similar population matrices
are similar.

biologically realistic (nonlinear ODE) model of a neural circuit in a
multicellular organism: Tap Withdrawal (TW) in \emph{C. Elegans}, the common
roundworm. TW is a reflexive behavior exhibited by \emph{C. Elegans} in
response to vibrating the surface on which it is moving; the neural circuit
underlying this response is the subject of this investigation. Specifically, we
perform reachability analysis on the TW circuit model of Wicks et al. (1996),
which enables us to estimate key circuit parameters. Underlying our approach is
the use of Fan and Mitra's recently developed technique for automatically
computing local discrepancy (convergence and divergence rates) of general
nonlinear systems. We show that the results we obtain are in agreement with the
experimental results of Wicks et al. (1995). As opposed to the fixed parameters
found in most biological models, which can only produce the predominant
behavior, our techniques characterize ranges of parameters that produce (and do
not produce) all three observed behaviors: reversal of movement, acceleration,
and lack of response.

fast, active control mechanisms to counter aerodynamic instability. To directly
investigate how freely-flying D. melanogaster control their body pitch angle
against such instability, we perturb them using impulsive mechanical torques
and film their corrective maneuvers with high-speed video. Combining
experimental observations and numerical simulation, we find that flies correct
for pitch deflections of up to 40 degrees in 29 +/- 8 ms by bilaterally
modulating their wings' front-most stroke angle in a manner well-described by a
linear proportional-integral (PI) controller. Flies initiate this corrective
process after only 10 +/- 2 ms, indicating that pitch stabilization involves a
fast reflex response. Remarkably, flies can also correct for very
large-amplitude pitch perturbations--greater than 150 degrees--providing a
regime in which to probe the limits of the linear-response framework. Together
with previous studies regarding yaw and roll control, our results on pitch show
that flies' stabilization of each of these body angles is consistent with PI
control.

catalyzed by the development of jointly intentional modes of behaviour. From an
early age (1-2 years), human infants outperform apes at tasks that involve
collaborative activity. Specifically, human infants excel at joint action
motivated by reasoning of the form &quot;we will do X&quot; (shared intentions), as
opposed to reasoning of the form &quot;I will do X [because he is doing X]&quot;
(individual intentions). The mechanism behind the evolution of shared
intentionality is unknown. Here we formally model the evolution of jointly
intentional action and show under what conditions it is likely to have emerged
in humans. Modelling the interaction of hunter-gatherers as a coordination
game, we find that when the benefits from adopting new technologies or norms
are low but positive, the sharing of intentions does not evolve, despite being
a mutualistic behaviour that directly benefits all participants. When the
benefits from adopting new technologies or norms are high, such as may be the
case during a period of rapid environmental change, shared intentionality
evolves and rapidly becomes dominant in the population. Our results shed new
light on the evolution of collaborative behaviours.

opposing forces. This opposing force may be due to cargo carried by motors, or
resistance coming from cell membrane pressing against the cytoskeletal
filaments. Certain recent studies have shown that the collective maximum force
(stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or molecular motors
may not always be just a simple sum of stall force for individual filaments or
motors. To understand this phenomena of excess or deficit collective force
generation, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal filaments and
molecular motors. We argue that the stall force generated by a group of
filaments or motors is additive, i.e., the stall force of N filaments(motors)
is N times the stall force of one filament (motor), when the system is in
equilibrium at stall. Consequently, we show that this additivity typically does
not hold when the system departs from equilibrium at stall. We thus present a
novel and unified understanding of existing models exhibiting such non-
addivity, and generalize our arguments by developing new models that
demonstrate this phenomena. We also propose a quantity similar to thermodynamic
efficiency to provide a simple understanding of deviation from stall-force
additivity for filament and motor collectives.

of a common pool of microRNAs, a class of small non-coding downregulators of
gene expression. Behaving as microRNA-sponges, distinct RNA species may compete
for binding to microRNAs and coregulate each other in a dose-dependent manner.
Although previous studies in cell populations showed competition in vitro, the
detailed dynamical aspects of this process, most importantly in physiological
conditions, remains unclear. We address this point by monitoring protein
expression of two targets of a common miRNA with quantitative single-cell
measurements. In agreement with a detailed stochastic model of molecular
titration, we observed that: (i) crosstalk between targets is possible only in
particular stoichiometric conditions, (ii) a trade-off on the number of
microRNA regulatory elements may induce the coexistence of two distinct cell
populations, (iii) strong inter-targets correlations can be observed. This
phenomenology is compatible with a small amount of mRNA target molecules per
cell of the order of 10-100.

coupled simulation of signalling and tissue dynamics. A cellular resolution of
the tissue domain is important to adequately describe the impact of cell-based
events, such as cell division, cell-cell interactions, and spatially restricted
signalling events. A tightly coupled cell-based mechano-regulatory simulation
tool is therefore required.
  We developed an open-source software framework for morphogenetic problems.
The environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and signalling
models. In addition, the software offers great flexibility to add custom
extensions and biologically motivated processes. Cells are represented as
highly resolved, massless elastic polygons; the viscous properties of the
tissue are modelled by a Newtonian fluid. The Immersed Boundary method is used
to model the interaction between the viscous and elastic properties of the
cells, thus extending on the IBCell model. The fluid and signalling processes
are solved using the Lattice Boltzmann method. As application examples we
simulate signalling-dependent tissue dynamics.

liquid/liquid phase separation. But unlike the molecules in conventional phase
separating mixtures, RNA molecules are transported by molecular motors that
consume energy and so are out of equilibrium. Motivated by this we consider
what sort of simple rules for the dynamics of model mRNA molecules lead to
liquid/liquid phase separation. We find that dynamics that slow as the local
density of molecules increases, drive the formation of liquids. We also look at
the analogous separation of the two blocks of a block copolymer, in which the
monomers of one block have dynamics that depend on the local density of
monomers of that block. We find that this block condenses and separates from
the monomers of the other block. This is a simple model of the
out-of-equilibrium domain formation found in the chromatin in the nucleus of
cells.

networks (GRNs) controlled by Hox genes, a better analogy is computer
architecture: i.e., a task accomplished in sequential steps linked to an
external referent that &quot;counts&quot; each step. A developmental &quot;step&quot; equals the
expression of genes in specific cells at specific times and telomeres represent
external &quot;counters&quot; wherein &quot;counting&quot; is a function of telomere shortening at
each cell division that permits the sequential expression of Hox genes and,
ultimately, complex form. Metazoan development thus best resembles a Turing
machine, which could be used to model the development of any metazoan.

inside living cells. In order to fascilitate large-scale computational studies
of subdiffusive chemical processes, we extend a recently suggested mesoscopic
model of subdiffusion into an accurate and consistent reaction-subdiffusion
computational framework. Two different possible models of chemical reaction are
revealed and some basic dynamic properties are derived. In certain cases those
mesoscopic models have a direct interpretation at the macroscopic level as
fractional partial differential equations in a bounded time interval. Through
analysis and numerical experiments we estimate the macroscopic effects of
reactions under subdiffusive mixing. The models display properties observed
also in experiments: for a short time interval the behavior of the diffusion
and the reaction is ordinary, in an intermediate interval the behavior is
anomalous, and at long times the behavior is ordinary again.

crescentus cells using a novel combination of imaging techniques and
theoretical modeling. We determine the dynamics of cell pole-to-pole lengths,
cross-sectional widths, and medial curvatures from high accuracy measurements
of cell contours. Moreover, these shape parameters are determined for over 250
cells across approximately 10000 total generations, which affords high
statistical precision. Our data and model show that constriction is initiated
early in the cell cycle and that its dynamics are controlled by the time scale
of exponential longitudinal growth. Based on our extensive and detailed growth
and contour data, we develop a minimal mechanical model that quantitatively
accounts for the cell shape dynamics and suggests that the asymmetric location
of the division plane reflects the distinct mechanical properties of the
stalked and swarmer poles. Furthermore, we find that the asymmetry in the
division plane location is inherited from the previous generation. We interpret
these results in terms of the current molecular understanding of shape, growth,
and division of C. crescentus

The latest major outbreak occurred in Guinea, Sierra Leonne and Liberia in
2014. With the aim of understanding the spread of infection in the affected
countries, it is crucial to modelize the virus and simulate it. In this paper,
we begin by studying a simple mathematical model that describes the 2014 Ebola
outbreak in Liberia. Then, we use numerical simulations and available data
provided by the World Health Organization to validate the obtained mathematical
model. Moreover, we develop a new mathematical model including vaccination of
individuals. We discuss different cases of vaccination in order to predict the
effect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time. Finally, we apply
optimal control to study the impact of vaccination on the spread of the Ebola
virus. The optimal control problem is solved numerically by using a direct
multi-shooting method.

derive a number of properties that are core to scaling, robustness, and

the Landolt-C paradigm (Williams &amp; Pollatsek, 2007) in which they searched for
target squares embedded in linear arrays of spatially contiguous &quot;words&quot; (i.e.,
short sequences of squares having missing segments of variable size and
orientation). Although the distributions of single- and first-of-multiple
fixation locations replicated previous patterns suggesting saccade targeting
(e.g., Yan, Kliegl, Richter, Nuthmann, &amp; Shu, 2010), the distribution of all
forward fixation locations was uniform, suggesting the absence of specific
saccade targets. Furthermore, properties of the &quot;words&quot; (e.g., gap size) also
influenced fixation durations and forward saccade length, suggesting that
on-going processing affects decisions about when and where (i.e., how far) to
move the eyes. The theoretical implications of these results for existing and
future accounts of eye-movement control are discussed.

For example,
cell diameter only varies by a few percent across a population. MreB is
necessary for establishment and maintenance of rod shape although the mechanism
of shape control remains unknown. We perturbed MreB in two complimentary ways
to produce steady-state cell diameters over a wide range, from 790+/-30 nm to
1700+/-20 nm. To determine which properties of MreB are important for diameter
control, we correlated structural characteristics of fluorescently-tagged MreB
polymers with cell diameter by simultaneously analyzing 3-dimensional images of
MreB and cell shape. Our results indicate that the pitch angle of MreB
inversely correlates with cell diameter. Other correlations are not found to be
significant. These results demonstrate that the physical properties of MreB
filaments are important for shape control and support a model in which MreB
dictates cell diameter and organizes cell wall growth to produce a chiral cell
wall.

  incompatibilities in small populations</title><categories>q-bio.PE</categories><comments>13 pages, 6 figures</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</license><abstract>  Speciation is fundamental to the huge diversity of life on Earth. Evidence
suggests reproductive isolation arises most commonly in allopatry with a higher
speciation rate in small populations. Current theory does not address this
dependence in the important weak mutation regime. Here, we examine a
biophysical model of speciation based on the binding of a protein transcription
factor to a DNA binding site, and how their independent co-evolution, in a
stabilizing landscape, of two allopatric lineages leads to incompatibilities.
Our results give a new prediction for the monomorphic regime of evolution,
consistent with data, that smaller populations should develop incompatibilities
more quickly. This arises as: 1) smaller populations having a greater initial
drift load, as there are more sequences that bind poorly than well, so fewer
substitutions are needed to reach incompatible regions of phenotype space; 2)
slower divergence when the population size is larger than the inverse of
discrete differences in fitness. Further, we find longer sequences develop
incompatibilities more quickly at small population sizes, but more slowly at
large population sizes. The biophysical model thus represents a robust
mechanism of rapid reproductive isolation for small populations and large
sequences, that does not require peak-shifts or positive selection.

Escherichia coli. However, recent evidence suggests significant departures from
the E. coli paradigm in other bacterial species. This variation may stem from
different species inhabiting distinct environments and thus adapting to
specific environmental pressures. In particular, these complex and dynamic
environments may be poorly represented by standard experimental and theoretical
models. In this work, we study the performance of various chemotactic
strategies under a range of stochastic time- and space-varying attractant
distributions in silico. We describe a novel type of response in which the
bacterium tumbles more when attractant concentration is increasing, in contrast
to the response of E. coli, and demonstrate how this response explains the
behavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this &quot;speculator&quot;
response, bacteria compare the current attractant concentration to the
long-term average. By tumbling persistently when the current concentration is
higher than the average, bacteria maintain their position in regions of high
attractant concentration. If the current concentration is lower than the
average, or is declining, bacteria swim away in search of more favorable
conditions. When the attractant distribution is spatially complex but
slowly-changing, this response is as effective as that of E. coli.

structure of proteins and their functional properties. The Hydrophobic-Polar
lattice models have provided valuable insights regarding the energy landscape.
We demonstrate here the isomorphism between the protein sequences and
designable structures for two and three dimensional lattice proteins of very
long aminoacid chains using exact enumerations and intuitive considerations.We
emphasize that the topological arrangement of the aminoacid residues alone is
adequate to deduce the designable and non-designable sequences without explicit
recourse to energetics and degeneracies. The results indicate the computational
feasibility of realistic lattice models for proteins in two and three
dimensions and imply that the fundamental principle underlying the designing of
structures is the connectivity of the hydrophobic and polar residues.

path integral techniques. Hydrogen bonds between base pairs on complementary
strands can be broken by thermal fluctuations and temporary fluctuational
openings along the double helix are essential to biological functions such as
transcription and replication of the genetic information. Helix unwinding and
bubble formation patterns are computed in circular sequences with variable
radius in order to analyze the interplay between molecule size and appearance
of helical disruptions. The latter are found in minicircles with $&lt; 100$ base
pairs and appear as a strategy to soften the stress due to the bending and
torsion of the helix.

by acquiring and fusing multiple views of the sample from different directions.
State-of-the-art multi-view (MV) deconvolution employs the point spread
functions (PSF) of the different views to simultaneously fuse and deconvolve
the images in 3D, but processing takes a multiple of the acquisition time and
constitutes the bottleneck in the imaging pipeline. Here we show that MV
deconvolution in 3D can finally be achieved in real-time by reslicing the
acquired data and processing cross-sectional planes individually on the
massively parallel architecture of a graphics processing unit (GPU).

can decode information encoded at a spatial scale as fine as the basic
functional unit of cortex: cortical columns. We addressed this question in five
magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiments by investigating the encoding of a
columnar-level encoded visual feature: contrast edge orientation. We found that
MEG signals contained orientation-specific information as early as ~50ms after
stimulus onset even when controlling for confounds, such as overrepresentation
of particular orientations, stimulus edge interactions, and global form-related
signals. Theoretical modeling confirmed the plausibility of this empirical
result. An essential consequence of our results is that information encoded in
the human brain at the level of cortical columns should in general be
accessible by multivariate analysis of electrophysiological signals.

manner of in-homogeneous and accelerated. For understanding this phenomenon,
development of aging changes is analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, which is
introduced in Misrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of
repair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism in situations of
severe injuries; however a Misrepair alters the structure of a tissue, a cell
or a molecule, which are the sub-structures of an organism. II. Alteration of
the structure of a sub-structure by Misrepair also alters the spatial
relationship between local sub-structures, and this change will lead to
increased damage-sensitivity and reduced repair-efficiency of these
sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a tendency to occur to the
sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an old Misrepair has taken
place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again the damage-sensitivity of
these sub-structures and the surrounding sub-structures. The frequency of
Misrepairs to these sub-structures is increased and the range of affected
sub-structures is enlarged after each time of Misrepair in a vicious circle.
Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. III.
Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to formation and growing of a &quot;spot&quot;
or &quot;plaque&quot; in a tissue. Growing of a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots
grow faster than new ones. New spots prefer to develop close to old ones,
resulting in an in-homogenous distribution of spots. In conclusion, the
in-homogeneous development of aging changes is a result of self-accelerating
and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; thus the process of aging is
self-accelerating.

sampled lineages from genetic data. Applications of phylogeography are broad,
and in the context of pathogens include the reconstruction of transmission
histories and the origin and emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference
based on bottom-up population genetics models is computationally expensive, and
as a result faster alternatives based on the evolution of discrete traits have
become popular. In this paper, we show that inference of migration rates and
root locations based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and
sensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA
(BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in
BEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent
with the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few
populations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model
choice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission
of Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers
that successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled
non-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly
concludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to
persist over the past four decades. As genomics takes on an increasingly
prominent role informing the control and prevention of infectious diseases, it
will be vital that phylogeographic inference provides robust insights into
transmission history.

  Exclusive Alterations in Cancer</title><categories>q-bio.QM stat.CO</categories><comments>Accepted to RECOMB 2015</comments><license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</license><abstract>  Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different combinations of genetic and
epigenetic alterations driving the development of cancer in different
individuals. While these alterations are believed to converge on genes in key
cellular signaling and regulatory pathways, our knowledge of these pathways
remains incomplete, making it difficult to identify driver alterations by their
recurrence across genes or known pathways. We introduce Combinations of
Mutually Exclusive Alterations (CoMEt), an algorithm to identify combinations
of alterations de novo, without any prior biological knowledge (e.g. pathways
or protein interactions). CoMEt searches for combinations of mutations that
exhibit mutual exclusivity, a pattern expected for mutations in pathways. CoMEt
has several important feature that distinguish it from existing approaches to
analyze mutual exclusivity among alterations. These include: an exact
statistical test for mutual exclusivity that is more sensitive in detecting
combinations containing rare alterations; simultaneous identification of
collections of one or more combinations of mutually exclusive alterations;
simultaneous analysis of subtype-specific mutations; and summarization over an
ensemble of collections of mutually exclusive alterations. These features
enable CoMEt to robustly identify alterations affecting multiple pathways, or
hallmarks of cancer. We show that CoMEt outperforms existing approaches on
simulated and real data. Application of CoMEt to hundreds of samples from four
different cancer types from TCGA reveals multiple mutually exclusive sets
within each cancer type. Many of these overlap known pathways, but others
reveal novel putative cancer genes. *Equal contribution.

fate decisions in response to various stresses, and PDCD5 functions as a
co-activator of p53 to modulate the p53 dynamics. In the present paper, we
investigate how p53 dynamics are modulated by PDCD5 during the DNA damage
response using methods of bifurcation analysis and potential landscape. Our
results reveal that p53 activities can display rich dynamics under different
PDCD5 levels, including monostability, bistability with two stable steady
states, oscillations, and co-existence of a stable steady state and an
oscillatory state. Physical properties of the p53 oscillations are further
shown by the potential landscape, in which the potential force attracts the
system state to the limit cycle attractor, and the curl flux force drives the
coherent oscillation along the cyclic. We also investigate the effect of PDCD5
efficiency on inducing the p53 oscillations. We show that Hopf bifurcation is
induced by increasing the PDCD5 efficiency, and the system dynamics show clear
transition features in both barrier height and energy dissipation when the
efficiency is close to the bifurcation point. This study provides a global
picture of how PDCD5 regulates p53 dynamics via the interaction with the
p53-Mdm2 oscillator and can be helpful in understanding the complicate p53
dynamics in a more complete p53 pathway.

DNA damage. Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5) is known to interact with the p53
pathway to promote cell apoptosis. Recombinant human PDCD5 can significantly
sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies. In the present paper, we
construct a computational model that includes PDCD5 interactions in the p53
signaling network and study the effects of PDCD5 on p53-mediated cell fate
decisions during the DNA damage response. Our results revealed that PDCD5
functions as a co-activator of p53 that regulates p53-dependent cell fate
decisions via the mediation of p53 dynamics. The effects of PDCD5 are
dose-dependent such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics at
different PDCD5 levels. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two
mechanisms during the two phases of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics. This
study provides insights regarding how PDCD5 functions as a regulator of the p53
pathway and might be helpful for increasing our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms by which PDCD5 can be used to treat cancers.

multi-neuronal dynamics and connectivity in the brain. However, our ability to
extract a simple conceptual understanding from complex data is increasingly
hampered by the lack of theoretically principled data analytic procedures, as
well as theoretical frameworks for how circuit connectivity and dynamics can
conspire to generate emergent behavioral and cognitive functions. We review and
outline potential avenues for progress, including new theories of high
dimensional data analysis, the need to analyze complex artificial networks, and
methods for analyzing entire spaces of circuit models, rather than one model at
a time. Such interplay between experiments, data analysis and theory will be
indispensable in catalyzing conceptual advances in the age of large-scale
neuroscience.

all human genes and the challenge to use this information for elucidating the
etiology of common disorders. A secondary Darwinian method was applied to HGP
and other research data to approximate and possibly unravel the etiology of
schizophrenia. The results indicate that genetic and epigenetic variants of
genes involved in signal transduction, transcription and translation -
converging at the protein-synthesis rate (PSR) as common final pathway - might
be responsible for the genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia. Environmental
(e.g. viruses)and/or genetic factors can lead to cerebral PSR (CPSR)
deficiency. The CPSR hypothesis of schizophrenia and antipsychotic mechanism
explains 96% of the major facts of schizophrenia, reveals links between
previously unrelated facts, integrates many hypotheses, and implies that
schizophrenia should be easily preventable and treatable, partly by
immunization against neurotrophic viruses and partly by the development of new
drugs which selectively increase CPSR. Part of the manuscript has been

networks in living cells requires sufficient specificity of molecular
interaction to distinguish signals from one another, but much of regulation and
signaling involves somewhat fuzzy and promiscuous recognition of molecular
sequences and structures, which can leave systems vulnerable to crosstalk. This
paper examines a simple computational model of protein-protein interactions
which reveals both a sharp onset of crosstalk and a fragmentation of the
neutral network of viable solutions as more proteins compete for regions of
sequence space, revealing intrinsic limits to reliable signaling in the face of
promiscuity. These results suggest connections to both phase transitions in
constraint satisfaction problems and coding theory bounds on the size of
communication codes.
