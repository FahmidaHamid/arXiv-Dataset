Abstract
The thermodynamical stability of DNA minicircles is investigated by means of path integral
techniques. Hydrogen bonds between base pairs on complementary strands can be broken by
thermal fluctuations and temporary fluctuational openings along the double helix are essential
to biological functions such as transcription and replication of the genetic information. Helix
unwinding and bubble formation patterns are computed in circular sequences with variable radius
in order to analyze the interplay between molecule size and appearance of helical disruptions. The
latter are found in minicircles with < 100 base pairs and appear as a strategy to soften the stress
due to the bending and torsion of the helix.

It is known that the helicoidal conformation of DNA is essentially determined by the
hydrophobicity of purine and pyrimidine bases and by the bond angles in the flexible sugarphosphate backbone while sequence of the bases and environmental conditions due to the
solvent also contribute to the molecule shape [1]. As each strand bears a negative charge
(e) for each phosphate group and the rise distance between adjacent nucleotides is ∼ 3.4Å,
the bare double helix has a high linear charge density of ∼ 0.6 e Å−1 . Although the effective
charge density is reduced by the counterions in the solvent, the electrostatic strands repulsion
is key to the stability of the helix and also affects the inter-helical chiral interactions in those
condensed phases of DNA assemblies (such as liquid crystals) which underlie the impressive
growth of DNA-based structures recently witnessed in materials science.
Base pairing and base stacking are the fundamental interactions which control the synthesis of DNA and determine the thermodynamic stability both of single helices and of
helix aggregates. However even stable duplexes at room temperature show local openings,
temporary bubbles, which are intrinsic to the biological functioning as they permit the
transcription and replication of the genetic code. Such bubbles are due to the strong fluctuational effects on the hydrogen bonds between complementary strands and cause the local
unwinding of the double helix which ultimately leads to a state of negative supercoiled DNA
for almost all living beings. While these processes are qualitatively understood, quantitative
predictions of (energetically) optimal helical configurations for specific systems are scarce.
We contribute to fill this gap by introducing a new path integral computational method
which readily applies to loops of DNA as those found in bacterial plasmids, viral genomes
and also mammalian cells.

MESOSCOPIC MODEL

Let’s arrange N base pairs (bps) on a circle with radius R such that, 2πR/N ∼ 3.4 Å, as
depicted in Fig. 1. When all bps centers of mass lie on the circumference, which represents
the molecule backbone, the system is in the ground state.
Say ri , the inter-strand fluctuation for the i -base pair (i = 1, ..N) with respect to the
ground state. Hence, we define the vector ti :

= (R + |ri | sin θi ) cos φi ;

= (R + |ri |) sin φi .

The ground state is recovered once all bps-fluctuations vanish hence, ti = R, ∀i. The
polar angle, θi = (i − 1)2π/h + θS , measures the i− bp twisting around the molecule
backbone, with h = N/T w being the number of bps per helix turn and T w is the twist
number accounting for the coiling of the individual strands around the helical axis [1]. The
azimuthal angle, φi = (i − 1)2π/N + φS , defines the bending between adjacent bps along the
stack. As the polynucleotide chain has a direction due to the chemistry of the intra-strand
bonds, a distribution of values for the twist (θS ) and the bending (φS ) of the first bp in
the sequence is weighed in the computation. The fluctuational orbits defined by i = 1 and
i = N + 1 overlap consistently with the closure condition holding for the DNA ring.

SPACE-TIME MAPPING

My previous path integral analysis of DNA [2–10] were based on the ansatz that the
bps displacements could be treated as one dimensional paths x(τi ), |ri | → x(τi ), with the
imaginary time τi ∈ [0, β] and β being the inverse the temperature.
Here I introduce a more general (albeit more CPU time consuming) space-time mapping
technique, which does not pin a base pair to a specific τi thus avoiding the somewhat
arbitrary partition of the β length in N intervals:

|ri | → xi (τ ); |ti | → ηi (τ );

τ ∈ [0 , β] .

(2)

The paths xi (τ ) are expanded in Fourier series, the constraint xi= 1 (τ ) = xi= N +1 (τ ) for
a DNA loop is implemented and, for the model in Fig. 1, the bps fluctuations in the path
integral formalism are given by:


1/2
ηi (τ ) = R2 + xi (τ )2 + 2R|xi (τ )|f (θi , φi )
f (θi , φi ) = sin θi cos2 φi + sin2 φi .

(3)

This new mapping technique lets τ as an integration variable and permits to set a realistic rise distance between adjacent nucleotides along the stack. Written in terms of the
ηi (τ ), the Hamiltonian contains:

i) a Morse potential, VM [ηi (τ )], describing the effective

hydrogen bond interaction between bps mates, ii) a solvent term, Vsol [ηi (τ )], accounting for

the path Fourier coefficients while indicates that the paths xi (τ ) are closed trajectories.

The integration over the two particles potential greatly enhances the computational times
with respect to the previous method [10] but it offers a more realistic model for the base
stacking in sequences of any length.

FREE ENERGY OF MINICIRCLES

There has been a widespread interest in the properties of small sequences of DNA following measurements of high cyclization probabilities which have pointed to an intrinsic
flexibility for fragments of ∼ 100 bps or less [11]. It has been suggested that the formation
of local disruptions in the helix of DNA loops may be the mechanism which permits to release the torsional stress and energetically favors the stability of bent molecules. Certainly,
the breaking of some bps and the opening of fluctuational bubbles change the average pitch
of the helix, that is the number of bps per helix turn.
In the theoretical framework synthesized by Eq. (4), I compute the free energy (F =
β −1 ln ZN ) of three heterogeneous loops with different length, N = 18, 66, 86, but similar
content of AT-bps and GC-bps, ∼ 50% each. The rise distance is pinned to the experimental
value. The 66− and 86− bps loops have been prepared as described in Ref.[12] whereas
the N = 18 bps is a toy sequence here introduced for comparison. For each loop, we
simulate a broad set of values for the twist T w and, for any T w (i.e., h), ZN is calculated by
summing over an ensemble of fluctuational paths representing a large number of molecule
configurations, about 107 paths for each base pair in Eq. (4).
Hence, the free energy is obtained as a function of the helical repeat h. The computational
time for a simulation, e.g. for the N = 66 sequence, is about eight days on a workstation
(Intel Xeon E5-1620 v2, 3.7GHz processor). The room temperature results for F/N are
plotted in Fig. 2. While the shortest loop shows a free energy minimum also at h ∼ 7, the

Helical repeat

FIG. 2: (Color online) Free energy per base pair for three loops with N = 18, 66, 86. The free
energies are computed, at room temperature, as a function of the number of bps per helix turn.

minima for all loops are remarkably found for h in the range ∼ (10 − 12) in line with the well
known values of helical pitch in DNA sequences [1]. Even more interestingly, the 66− and
86− minicircles also show free energy minima at larger h due to a spontaneous unwinding of
the complementary strands. This T w reduction is consistent with the observations [12] of bps
disruptions occuring in small loops as a consequence of the strong rotational deformations
of the helix. The bending stress decreases by increasing the radius of the loop.
Then, for an ensemble of molecules with N bps, the free energy minimization evaluates
the thermodynamically stablest values of helical repeat, that is an average property of the
molecule ensemble. Furthermore, the path integral method can also determine the probabilities for the formation of fluctuational bubbles and select those base pairs along the DNA
sequence for which hydrogen bond breaking is more likely to occur. By tuning the system
temperature and the input parameters which control the counterions concentration in the
6

solvent, we thus obtain a general and reliable computational scheme for the modeling of
heterogeneous DNA loops in various ambient conditions.
