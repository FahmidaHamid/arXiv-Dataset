Abstract
A novel radio guided surgery (RGS) technique for cerebral tumors using β − radiation is being developed. Checking the availability of a radio-tracer that can
deliver a β − emitter to the tumor is a fundamental step in the deployment of
such technique. This paper reports a study of the uptake of 90 Y-labeled [1,4,7,10tetraazacyclododecane-N,N0 ,N00 ,N000 -tetraacetic acid0-D-Phe1,Tyr3]octreotide (DOTATOC) in the meningioma and the high grade glioma (HGG) and a feasibility study
of the RGS technique in these cases. Such estimates are performed assuming the use
of a β − probe with a sensitive area of 2.55 mm radius, that is under development, to
detect 0.1ml residuals. Methods: the uptake and the background from healthy tissues were estimated on 68 Ga-DOTATOC PET scans of 11 meningioma and 12 HGG
patients. A dedicated statistical analysis of the DICOM images was developed and
validated. The feasibility study was performed by means of a full simulation of the
emission and detection of the radiation, accounting for the measured uptake and
background rate. Results: all meningioma patients but one with an atypical extracranial tumor showed a very high uptake of DOTATOC. In terms of feasibility of
the RGS technique, we estimated that by administering 3 MBq/kg of radio-tracer,
the time needed to detect a 0.1 ml remnant at 95% C.L. is smaller than 1 s. Actually,
to achieve a detection time of 1 s the required activities to administer are as low
as 0.2-0.5 MBq/kg in a large fraction of the patients. In case of HGGs, the uptake
is lower, but the tumor-to-non-tumor ratio is higher than four, which implies that
it can still be effective for RGS. It was estimated that by administering 3 MBq of
radio-tracer, the time needed to detect a 0.1 ml remnant at 95% C.L. is smaller than
6 s with the exception of the only oligodendrioma in the sample. Conclusion: The
uptake of 90 Y-DOTATOC in meningioma is high in all studied patients. As far as
HGG is concerned, albeit the uptake is significantly worse, it is still acceptable for
RGS, in particular if further R&D is made to improve the performances of the β −
probe.

Introduction
The radio-guided surgery (RGS) is a technique that facilitates the surgeon when
evaluating the completeness of the tumoral lesion resection, while minimizing the
amount of healthy tissue removed (1). The impact of the RGS on the surgical management of cancer patients includes providing the surgeon with vital and real-time
information regarding the location and the extent of the lesion, as well as assessing
surgical resection margins. The technique makes use of a radio-labelled tracer, preferentially uptaken by the tumor to discriminate the cancerous tissue from the healthy
organs, and a probe (for a review see (2)), sensitive to the emission released by the
tracer, to identify in real time the targeted tumor focus. The radio-pharmaceutical is
administered to the patient before surgery.
Current clinical applications of the RGS are: radio-immuno-guided surgery
(RIGS) for colon cancer (3, 4), complete sentinel-node mapping for malignant
melanoma (5) and breast cancer (6, 7), and detection of parathyroid adenoma (8)
and bone tumors (such as osteoid osteoma). There are also clinical studies on the
application to neuro-endocrine tumors (NET) (9, 10).
Established methods make use of a combination of a γ-emitting tracer with a
γ radiation detecting probe (see for instance Refs (11, 12) and references therein).
Since γ radiation can traverse large amounts of tissue, any uptake of the tracer in
nearby healthy tissue represents a non-negligible background, often preventing the
usage of this technique.
To overcome these limits and extend the range of applicability of RGS, it was
suggested (13) to use pure β − -emitting radio-isotopes instead of the γ-emitting
tracers. β − radiation indeed penetrates only a few millimetres of tissue with essen-

tially no γ contamination, since the bremsstrahlung contribution, that has a 0.1%
emission probability, can be considered negligible. This novel approach allows to
develop a handy and compact probe which, detecting electrons and operating with
low radiation background, provides a clearer delineation of margins of the lesioned
tissue. It also requires a smaller activity to detect tumor remnants compared to traditional RGS approaches so that, due to the lower absorbed dose (13) and the short
range of electrons, the radiation exposure of the medical personnel becomes almost
negligible.
For this novel technique to be applicable, tracers capable to deliver pure β −
emitting radio-nuclides are needed. Among the existing tracers, those used for
molecular radio-therapy, in particular the Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy
(PRRT) with 90 Y, are the first candidates to be considered. Furthermore, neurosurgery is one of the fields that would profit most from RGS, given the importance
of complete lesion removal. Finally, pre-surgical imaging is scarcely effective for
the search for remnants because the operative field changes substantially during
the brain tumor resection. This makes 90 Y-labeled [1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecaneN,N0 ,N00 ,N000 -tetraacetic acid0-D-Phe1,Tyr3]octreotide (DOTATOC) an optimal candidate tracer for a first application of RGS with β − radio-nuclides in brain tumors: meningioma has long been known to have an important uptake of DOTATOC (14–17) and there are recently studies showing that also HGG presents receptors to somatostatin (18).
Existing studies (14) focus on the characteristics of the uptake needed for molecular radio-therapy. This paper studies instead, in the case of meningioma and
HGG, the aspects that are critical in the case of RGS, when the administered activities are significantly lower and the required tumor-to-non-tumor ratio (TNR) is

smaller.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Estimate of The DOTATOC Uptake
The first goal of this study was to assess the uptake of

90 Y-DOTATOC

in menin-

gioma, HGG and nearby healthy tissue. To this aim, we have examined PET scans
with 68 Ga-DOTATOC of the two diseases (19), with the reasonable assumption that
Ga and Y are chemically similar enough not to alter the kinetics of the tracer. We
have retrospectively analyzed, with the AMIDE software, DICOM images of 11
patients affected by meningioma and 12 by HGG and estimated the mean tumor uptake and the uptake of the nearby healthy tissues (the "non-tumor" estimate needed
to compute the tumor-to-non-tumor ratio, TNR). All patients gave their written informed consensus to clinical research. A summary of the characteristics of the meningioma and HGG patients are in Tabs. 1 and 2 respectively.
To estimate the mean tumor uptake, for each meningioma patient we considered
several slices of the PET scan and in each of it a region of interest (ROI), containing only lesioned tissue on the basis of the CT scans, was defined. In presence of
several lesions, each one was considered separately (see Fig. 1 on the left for an example). In the case of the HGG, instead, there was often a necrotic area in between
uptaking tissues (center of Fig. 1), due to previous treatments. In such cases a ROI
comprehensive of both the uptaking and the interstitial regions was chosen.
For each of the Ns slices, the effective number of voxels (Niv ), the mean value
µi (i = 1, ..., Ns ), and the standard deviation σi of the voxel specific activity was
measured. From this information the mean value of the tumor specific activity µ

and the corresponding uncertainty σµ was estimated with a weighted average

Fig. 2 shows typical values of µi for different slices and their average. Each slice
in the DICOM images is 3.27 mm thick. The effects on the margins of the tumor
are masked by the spatial resolution of ≈3 mm. Such resolution causes a systematic
underestimate of the activity concentration, effect known as partial volume effect
(PVE). We have conservatively avoided to correct for it.
In order to take into account the difference in administered activity of tracer
injected to the patients, the standardized uptake value (SUV) was estimated by normalizing the measured µ by the administered activity per unit of mass of the patient,
after having rescaled this activity at the time of the PET scan:

SUV =

where Aadm is the administered activity, W mass of the patient, ∆tPET is the time

elapsed between the administration and the PET scan, and TGa is the 68 Ga half-life.
As far as the healthy tissue is concerned, several ROIs on several slices of the
scan were chosen. Since the β − radiation is local, the ROIs were chosen, by means
of the information from the CT, close to the tumor margins, as shown in Fig. 1
(right). In this case, a weighted average was used to evaluate µNT , σNT and the
corresponding SUVNT .
The TNR was estimated as the ratio between µ and µNT .

The β − Probe
A critical element in the development of the proposed RGS method is the β − probe,
where the low penetration power of the β − radiation can be exploited by reducing
the size of the lateral shielding. Furthermore, we have found that we could minimize
the sensitivity to γ radiation by using an organic scintillator with low density but
high light yield (p-terphenyl (20)). The prototype used as reference in this study has
a sensitive cylinder of p-terphenyl with a radius of 2.55 mm and depth of 3 mm
(Fig. 3). To maximize the accuracy on the direction of the incoming radiation, the
sensitive region is screened by 3 mm of PVC. The scintillation light is transported to
a photo-multiplier tube (PMT, Hamamatsu H10721-210 in the prototype) through
four optical fibers.
Expected Performances of RGS With β − Decays
From the measured specific activities we also extrapolated a prediction on the potentialities of the RGS with β − decays. As previously mentioned and detailed in
Ref. (13), this technique exploits the fact that the tumor has a larger uptake of
DOTATOC than the healthy tissues: the patient scheduled for surgery is injected,
several hours in advance, with 90 Y-DOTATOC. From the DICOM images, properly
accounting for the radio-nuclide half-lives and assuming that the radio-tracer is administered ∆tsurg = 12 hours before the intervention, we can estimate the expected

During surgery and after the bulk removal, the surgeon explores the surgical site
with a β − probe to check the completeness of the resection.The probe will respond
to the presence of the β − radiation with a signal whose rate (ν) will depend on the
presence of radionuclides, their spatial distribution and the probe characteristics.
When probing for possible tumor residuals, a threshold on the number of counts in
a given time interval will have to be set to discriminate between healthy and lesion
tissues.
re f
To judge the feasibility of this approach, the measured specific activities µ(NT
)

need to be converted in the corresponding probe rates ν(NT ) . To this aim, we performed a full simulation, including all interactions of particles with matter, with the
FLUKA (21, 22) Monte Carlo software. In this simulation the background was repre f
resented by an extended region with a specific activity µNT
of 90 Y, while the tumor

residual used as benchmark is a cylinder with a radius of 3 mm and an height of
3.5 mm for a total volume of 0.1 ml. These are indeed the dimension of a typical
residual that has to be identified by the probe. The tumor region is assumed to have
a specific activity µ re f of 90 Y.
The FLUKA software, fully simulating the nuclear decays and the interactions
of the radiation with the tissues, was used to estimate the energy deposited inside
the active volume of the probe, described above, by the emitted radiation. The conversion factor between the deposited energy and the electronic signal issued by the
probe was determined in laboratory tests with a point-like source of 90 Sr of known
activity. When the estimated electronic signal overcomes a threshold, that was determined in the same laboratory tests, the probe is considered to have issued a count.

From this simulation we are then capable to extract the signal rates that we
expect to measure with a realistic β − probe in presence of a tumor residual (ν) or in
presence of only healthy tissue (νNT ). Such estimates, like µ and µNT that are used
as input, depend on the administered activity of tracer.
From the measured detector rates we can estimate the time needed by the probe
to identify a tumor residual of 0.1 ml with a given probability of false positives (FP)
or false negatives (FN). For a fixed acquisition time of the probe (t probe ) the FP and
FN are defined as:

where Pµ (N) indicates the Poisson probability to have N if the mean is µ and Nthr
is the threshold in counts that we expect to set on the probe signal.

It is to be noted that the scaling between activities is performed neglecting the

biological wash-out of the organs. Nevertheless, wash-out is faster on the healthy
tissues than in the tumor, where the tracer is bound. Tumors show typically a constant or increasing phase in the first day after administration and a wash-out after
24 h (23, 24). Since the surgery, compared to PET scan, takes place after a longer
time has elapsed, the TNR was most likely underestimated and the conclusions of
this study are conservative.

The results of the measurements on patients affected by meningioma and HGG are

Meningioma Patients
The observed SUV and TNR on the meningioma patients is shown in Fig. 4. About
70% of the lesions have a SUV greater than 2 g/ml, i.e. administering 3 MBq/kg
would yield a specific activity greater than 6 kBq/ml. The rest of the patients have a

of the times above 20.

HGG Patients
The measured SUV and TNR on the HGG patients is shown in Fig. 5. About 60% of
the lesions have a SUV around 0.2 g/ml, i.e. administering 3 MBq/kg would yield
a specific activity about 0.6 kBq/ml. The TNR is always at least four, and twice as
high in one third of the cases. The only case where the uptake is marginal is the only
oligodendrioma in the sample.
With such indications we have calculated the information relevant for the RGS
with β − decays (see Tab. 2) and found that by administering 3MBq/kg the probe requires in a significant fraction of the cases about 5-6 s to discriminate between lesion
and healthy tissue. In such cases, to reduce the probing time to 1 s, a therapeutical
activity of 20MBq/kg would have to be administered.

DISCUSSION
The novel RGS technique under development relies on the possibility to deliver
efficiently and selectively a β − emitter. To this aim, this paper studies the uptake of
90 Y-DOTATOC

in two cases of interest, meningioma and high grade glioma.

Meningioma is known to have high receptivity to somatostatine analogues and
therefore it is an ideal test bench for the proposed technique. Nonetheless, it is important to assess the impact of such large receptivity on the protocol of the RGS. In
particular there needs to be assessed whether there are meningioma patients that do
not express enough receptors for the RGS to be effective and which is the lowest
activity that needs to be administered for the technique to be effective, in order to
minimize the exposure of the patient and of the medical personnel. The results show
that in the case of meningioma only one patient out of 11 did not express enough
receptors to allow for a detection of a residual of 0.1 ml in less than 1s, nonetheless
also in this case the probing time is below 2 s. We can therefore conclude that the
proposed RGS can be applied to all patients. Furthermore, in 60% of the patients
the technique could be effective administering only 0.5 MBq/kg. It is finally to be
noted that the Monte Carlo approach developed here will be part of the protocol to
determine the activity of 90 Y-DOTATOC to administer to patients, since a PET scan
with 68 Ga-DOTATOC will be acquired prior to surgery.
As far as HGG patients are concerned, the literature reported a limited receptivity to DOTATOC. Nonetheless, it was important to ascertain whether the uptake and
the TNR were sufficient for a diagnostic use. the uptake was significantly less, but
nonetheless the TNR was in most of the cases larger than four, even with a conservative estimate. This implies that, in case of HGG, the RGS with β − decays is
expected to be reliable if each possible residual is examined for at most 5-6 seconds,
since the activities needed to reach the required sensitivity in 1s are too large. Alternatively, to reduce the measurement time, there are still margins to improve the
sensitivity of the probe: more sensitive devices can be exploited in the scintillation
light collection and crystals with a larger light yield can be considered, at the ex-

pense of a more challenging engineering of the probe. It is also to be noted that the
estimates are conservative because the region between areas with a good uptake is
also included in the ROI since it cannot be established whether it is still tumor or
not (see Fig. 1).

CONCLUSION
We estimated the uptake of DOTATOC in meningioma and high grade glioma in
the context of the feasibility study of a novel RGS technique exploiting β − decays.
The results showed that in the case of meningioma the uptake is so marked that the
technique can work even administering activities much smaller than the one needed
for PET scans. Such minimum required activity can be computed on a patient-bypatient basis. The proposed technique can also work for high grade glioma, although
the limited receptivity requires a longer probing time with the current version of the
probe.
