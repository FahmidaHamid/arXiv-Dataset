A microtubule (MT) is a hollow tube of approximately 25 nm diameter. The two ends of the
tube are dissimilar and are designated as ‘plus’ and ‘minus’ ends. Motivated by the collective
push and pull exerted by a bundle of MTs during chromosome segregation in a living cell, we have
developed here a much simplified theoretical model of a bundle of parallel dynamic MTs. The plusend of all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable ‘wall’ by a device whose
detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The only requirement is that the device
allows polymerization and depolymerization of each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence
of external force and direct lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs
attached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing MTs and vice-versa;
the load against a group is shared equally by the members of that group. Such indirect interactions
among the MTs gives rise to the rich variety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have
identified by computer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes. The bi-directional
motion of the cargo, caused by the load-dependence of the polymerization kinetics, is a “proof-ofprinciple” that the bi-directional motion of chromosomes before cell division does not necessarily
need active participation of motor proteins.

INTRODUCTION

A microtubules (MT) is a hollow tube of approximately
25 nm diameter. It is one of major components of the
cytoskeleton [1] that provides mechanical strength to the
cell. Each MT is polar in the sense that its two ends
are structurally as well as kinetically dissimilar. One of
the unique features of a MT in the intracellular environment is its dynamic instability [2]. The steady growth
of a polymerizing MT takes place till a “catastrophe”
triggers its rapid depolymerization from its tip. Often
the depolymerizing MT is “rescued” from this decaying
state before it disappears completely and keeps growing
again by polymerization till its next catastrophe. Thus,
during its lifetime, a MT alternates between the states of
polymerization (growth) and depolymerization (decay).
One of the key structural features of a MT is that
during its depolymerization the tip of this nano-tube
is curved radially outward from its central axis. While
polymerizing, the growing MT can exert a pushing force
against a transverse barrier thereby operating, effectively,
as a nano-piston [3, 4]. Although lateral cross linking
between the MTs and their unzipping can have interesting effects [5, 6], no such cross link is incorporated in
our model here because of the different motivation of our
work. Similarly, the splaying tip of a depolymerizing MT
can pull an object in a manner that resembles the operation of a nano-hook [7, 8]. Thus, a MT can perform
mechanical work by transducing input chemical energy.
In analogy with motor proteins that transduce chemical input energy into mechanical work, force generating
polymerizing and depolymerizing MTs are also referred
to as molecular motors [9–11].

In this paper we consider a bundle of parallel MTs that
are not laterally bonded to each other. Such bundles have
been the focus of attention in recent years because of the
nontrivial collective kinetics and force generation by a
bundle in spite of the absence of any direct lateral bond
between them [3]. For example, while driving chromosomal movements in a mammalian cell before cell division,
the members of a bundle that is attached to a single
kinetochore wall, undergo catastrophe and rescue in a
synchronized manner [12]. The type of collective phenomenon under consideration here is of current interest
also in many related or similar contexts in living systems.
For example, there are similarities between the motion of
a chromosomal cargo pushed/pulled by a group of polymerizing/depolymerizing MTs and that of a membranebounded vesicular cargo hauled by the members of two
antagonistic superfamilies of molecular motors along a
filamentous track [13–15]. But, as we explain here, there
are crucial differences between the two systems. Other
examples of similar collective dynamics include (stochastic) oscillations in muscles, flagella (a cell appendage) of
sperm cells, etc. [9, 10].
Here we develop a theoretical model for the collective
kinetics of a bundle of parallel MTs that interact with a
movable wall. The model is based on minimum number
of hypotheses for the polymerization kinetics of individual MTs. More specifically, the model takes into account
the force-dependence of the rates of catastrophe/rescue
and polymerization/depolymerization. These hypotheses
are consistent with in-vitro experiments on single MT reported so far in the literature. Numerical simulation of
the model demonstrates synchronized growth and shrinkage of the MT bundle in a regime of model parameters.
We classify the states of motion of the wall that is collectively pushed and pulled by the MT bundle. In one of
the states thus discovered the wall executes bi-directional
motion and it arises from a delicate interplay of load-

2
force-dependent rates of MT polymerization and depolymerization. This work also provides direct evidence that
bidirectional motion of MT-driven cargo is possible even
in the absence of any motor protein [9, 10]; the “proofof-principle” presented here will be elaborated later elsewhere [16] in the context of modeling chromosome segregation.

FIG. 1: (Color online) Our model is depicted schematically.
The wall to which the MTs are attached is represented by the
blue vertical slab. The polymerizing (growing) and depolymerizing (shrinking) MTs are represented by the horizontal
green cylinders (with dashed outlines) and red cylinders (with
solid outlines), respectively. The grey short cylinders, into
which the plus end of the MTs are inserted, represent the
“couplers” that couple the MTs with the wall. The directions
of polymerization and depolymerization are indicated by the
double arrows. The directions of the load force (the absolute
value of which is F+ ) on the polymerizing MTs and load tension (the absolute value of which is F− ) on the depolymerizing
MTs are indicated by the single arrows.

is similar, in spirit, to the kinetic models of hauling of
membrane-bounded cargo where no explicit molecular
mechanism is assumed for the motor-cargo coupling [15].
The only assumption we make about the MT-wall coupling is that none of the MTs detaches from the wall
during the period of our observation; catastrophe and
rescue of a MT merely reverse the direction of the force
that it exerts on the wall.
We assume that during the period of our observation
neither nucleation of new MTs take place nor does any of
the existing MTs disappear altogether because of its depolymerization. Therefore, the total number of MTs, denoted by N , is conserved. We use the symbols n+ (t) and
n− (t) to denote the MTs in the growing and shrinking
phases, respectively, at time t so that n+ (t)+ n− (t) = N .
Thus, at time t, n+ (t) MTs push the cargo while, simultaneously, n− (t) MTs pull the same cargo in the opposite
direction.
As we show in this paper, the distribution of the MTs
in the two groups, namely n+ and n− , is a crucial determinant of the nature of the movements of the wall.
By carrying out computer simulations, we also monitor
the displacement and velocity distribution of the wall in
different regimes of the model parameters to characterize its distinct states of motility. The observed states of
motility are displayed on a phase diagram.

A.

Parameters and equations: force-dependence

The force-dependent rates of catastrophe and rescue of
a MT are denoted by the symbols c(F ) and r(F ), respectively, while c0 and r0 refer to the corresponding values
in the absence of load force. The experimental data collected over the last few years [21] and very recent modeling [22] have established the dependence of the rates of
catastrophe and rescue on the load force. Accordingly,
we assume
c(F ) = c0 exp(|F |/F∗c )

As we stated in the introduction, our study has been
motivated partly by collective force generation by MTs
during chromosome segregation. The model is depicted
schematically in fig.1. At present the identity of the
molecules that couple MTs to the chromosomal cargo and
the detailed mechanism of force generation at the MTcargo interface are under intense investigation [12, 17].
Plausible scenarios for the coupling suggested in the literature include, for example, mechanisms based on (i)
biased diffusion of the coupler [18], (ii) power stroke on
the coupler [19], (iii) attachment (and detachment) of
long flexible tethers [20]. Moreover, the mechanisms of
the MT-cargo coupling may also vary from one species
to another. Therefore, in order to maintain the generic
character of our model, we neither make any explicit microscopic model for the coupler nor postulate any detailed mechanism by which the individual members of
the MT bundle couple with the chromosomal cargo. This

where |F | is the absolute value of the load force opposing
polymerization, and F∗c is the characteristic force that
characterizes the rapidity of variation of the catastrophe
rate with the load force. Similarly, we assume
r(F ) = r0 exp(|F |/F∗r )

(2)

where |F | is the absolute value of the load tension opposing depolymerization and F∗r is the characteristic force
that characterizes the rapidity of variation of the depolymerization rate with the load force.
We denote the load-free velocities of polymerization
and depolymerization of a single MT by the symbols vg
and vd , respectively. For the load-dependence of these velocities we follow the standard practice in the literature
for modeling the load-dependence of the velocity of motor proteins. Specifically, we assume linear force-velocity

respectively.
Since all the n+ (t) polymerizing MTs and n− (t) depolymerizing MTs are, by definition, attached to the wall
at time t, their velocities of growth and decay, respectively, must be identical to the wall velocity vw , i.e.,

At every instant of time t the state of the system is

Note that the rate constants in equation (13) depend on
the time-dependent quantities n+ (t) and n− (t). Therefore, the rate constants on the right hand side of eqnation
(13) take their instantaneous values at time t.

Equation (5), which defines the symbol Fw (n+ , n− ), is
just a mathematical representation of Newton’s third
law: the force exerted by the wall on each MT is equal
and opposite to that exerted by the same MT on the wall.
According to our choice of the signs, the load force on the
polymerizing MTs are positive. Based on the assumption
(ii) above, we now have
|F+ (n+ , n− )| = |Fw (n+ , n− )|/n+
|F− (n+ , n− )| = |Fw (n+ , n− )|/n− .

the absolute values of the respective load forces opposing
polymerization and depolymerization, respectively, of the
corresponding MT. Fs+ and Fs− are the absolute values
of the stall forces corresponding to the polymerizing and
depolymerizing MTs.
In the spirit of many earlier theoretical models of bidirectional transport of membrane-bounded cargo [15] we
also make the following assumptions:
(i) push on the wall by polymerizing MTs generates the
indirect load tension on the depolymerizing MTs while
the pull of the latter on the same wall simultaneously
creates the load force against the polymerizing MTs. (ii)
the load force against polymerization is shared equally by
the n+ (t) MTs, and the load tension against depolymerization is also shared equally by the n− (t) MTs. At any
arbitrary instant of time t, each of the n+ (t) polymerizing MTs attached the chromosomal cargo experiences a
load force F+ and exerts a force −F+ . Similarly, each of
n− (t) depolymerizing MTs feels a load tension −F− and
offers a load force F− . Therefore, force balance on the
wall attached simultaneously by n+ (t) and n− (t) MT is
n+ F+ = −n− F− ≡ Fw (n+ , n− ).

Comparison with other similar phenomena and
models

We can now compare the model system under study
here with the models of transport of membrane-bounded
cargo (vesicles or organelles) by antagonistic motor proteins (e.g., kinesins and dyneins) that move on a filamentous track (e.g., a MT) [9, 10]. The polymerizing
and depolymerizing MTs are the analogs of kinesins and
dyneins. However, one crucial difference between the
two situations is that unlike a MT, that can switch from

4
polymerizing to depolymerizing phase (because of catastrophe) and from depolymerizing to polymerizing phase
(because of rescue), interconversion of plus and minus-

end directed motor proteins is impossible.
A systematic comparison of these two systems is presented in table I.

We have simulated the time evolution of n+ (t) and
n− (t), that is described by the master equation (13) using
Gillespie algorithm [23]. We get the instantaneous velocity vw (n+ , n− ) by substituting the corresponding values
of n+ (t) and n− (t) into equation (12). This data is used
not only for plotting the velocity distribution but also
for computing the displacements of the wall as a function
of time. Moreover, the instantaneous force Fw (n+ , n− )
evaluated using (11) is used for updating n+ and n− in
the next time step. Finally, all the distinct states of
motility of the wall are characterized by the statistics
of n+ , n− . For the simulation we have assumed that
initially half of the MTs are in the the state of polymerization while the remaining half are in the state of
depolymerization. For the presentation of our data, it
would be convenient to reduce the number of parameters.
Therefore, in this paper we report the results only for the
cases where vg = vd , c0 = r0 = γ0 , Fs+ = Fs− = Fs . The
magnitudes of vg = vd = 50 nm/s are identical in all the
figures plotted below.

First we simulated the model for the parameter values c0 = r0 = 10 s−1 , and F∗c = F∗r = 3.0 pN. The
numerical data obtained from simulation are plotted in
fig.2. In this case the typical trajectories provide direct
evidence for bi-directional motion of the wall. This is
also consistent with the two distinct and sharp peaks at
V = ±50 nm/s in the distribution of velocities of the
wall. The physical origin of this bi-directional motion
[15] can be inferred from the nature of the distribution
P (n+ , n− ) which now exhibits two maxima. The maximum at n+ > 0, n− ≃ 0 corresponds to the situation
where the wall is driven forward almost exclusively by
the growing MTs whereas that at n− > 0, n+ ≃ 0.

FIG. 3: Characteristics of “no motion” (0) state. (A) In the
3D plot of the probability against the numbers of growing
(n+ ) and shrinking (n− ) MTs peaks are seen along the diagonal, i.e., n+ = n− . (B) The small random positive and
negative displacements of the wall recorded with the passage
of time reflects the fluctuations in the position of the wall
as a consequence of the tug-of-war between the growing and
shrinking MTs. (C) The sharp dominant peak at zero velocity in the distribution of velocities is a signature of the ‘no
motion’ state; the small non-zero probabilities at other velocities correspond to the small random excursions of the wall
about its mean position. Numerical value of the parameters,
used in the simulation are Fs = 0.1 pN,vg = vd =50 nm/s,
F∗c = F∗r = 10.0 pN and c0 = r0 = 2000s−1 .

The physical origin of the bi-directional motion in this
case can be understood by critically examining the interplay of the time-dependence of n+ (t), n− (t) and the
dependence of c(F ), r(F ) on n+ (t), n− (t). Although initially, n+ (0) = N/2 = n− (0), stochastic nature of catastrophe and rescue causes population imbalance in spite
of the equal values of the corresponding rate constants.
Because of the appearance of n+ (t), n− (t) in eq.(7) the
population imbalance grows further. Thus, if n+ (t) keeps
increasing with time t, the wall continues to move forward; eventually, if n− vanishes, vw would become identical to vg . However, by that time, because of the nonvanishing c0 , the polymerizing MTs start suffering catastrophe that, in turn, increases population of depolymerizing MTs which has a feedback effect. Once the majority
of the MTs are in the depolymerizing state the wall reverses its direction of motion. The velocity of the wall
alternates between positive and negative values, corresponding to the alternate segments of the trajectory, that
characterizes the bi-directional motion of the wall.

FIG. 4: Characteristics of only minus and only plus motion.
Numerical value of the parameters, used in the simulation
are Fs = 5.0 pN,vg = vd =50 nm/s,c0 = r0 = 10 s−1 . To
get only minus or only plus motion we take F∗c = 3.0 pN ,
F∗r = 6.0 pN and vice versa. (A1)Probability vs motor number plot has maxima for only shrinking MT number. Corresponding velocity distribution and displacement are shown
in (A2) and inset of (A2), respectively. (B1)Probability vs
motor number plot has maxima for only growing MT number. Corresponding velocity distribution and displacement
are shown in (B2) and inset of (B2), respectively.

• Tug-of-war in the ‘No Motion (0)’ state
Next we chose the parameter values F∗c = F∗r =
10.0 pN and c0 = r0 = 2000s−1. Note that that catastrophe and rescue rates are much higher than those in the
previous case. Consequently, each MT very frequently
switches between the polymerizing and depolymerizing
states. Moreover, because of the much smaller values of
Fs , a MT can exert very small force on the wall in both
cases. The results of simulation are plotted in fig.3. The
velocity distribution exhibits a single peak at zero velocity which is a signature of the ‘No Motion (0)’ state
[15]. This is a consequence of the tug-of-war between
the growing and shrinking MTs that is evident in the

single maximum at n+ = n− in the probability distribution P (n+ , n− ). Tug-of-war does not mean complete
stall; small fluctuations around the stall position visible
in the trajectory gives rise to the non-zero width of the
velocity distribution around zero velocity. The underlying physical processes in this case are almost identical to
those in the case of bi-directional motion except for crucial difference arising from the relatively higher values
of c0 = r0 ; even before the wall can cover a significant
distance in a particular direction the MTs reverse their
velocities. Because of the high frequencies of catastrophe
and rescue the wall remains practically static except for
the small fluctuations about this position.

7
• Only plus (+) motion and only minus (-) motion
Finally, for the sake of completeness, we explored
asymmetric behavior of the model by choosing F∗c < F∗r
in one case and F∗c > F∗r in the other so that in one case
the wall exhibits only minus motion whereas in the other
case it exhibits only plus motion. The simulation results
are plotted side-by-side for these two cases in fig.4. In
this case the typical trajectories indicate motion either
only in the plus direction or only in the minus direction.
This observation is also consistent with the single sharp
peaks at V = +50 nm/s and V = −50 nm/s in the
distribution of velocities of the wall. The maximum at
n− > 0, n+ ≃ 0 corresponds to the situation where the
wall is driven backward almost exclusively by the shrinking MTs whereas in another case n+ > 0, n− ≃ 0 the
wall is driven forward by the growing MTs.

FIG. 5: All the distinct states of motility of the wall
for the case F∗c = F∗r are displayed on the f − k phase
diagram (see text for the definitions of f and k).
The phases are labelled by the corresponding symbols (see text for the meaning of these symbols). The
re-entrance phenomenon exhibited for f . 0.23 is also
explained in the text.

The movement of the wall depends crucially on two important dimensionless parameters, namely, k = c0 /(c0 +
r0 ) and f = Fs /(Fs + F⋆ ). For the sake of simplicity and
for reducing the number of parameters, here we have assumed F∗c = F∗r = F∗ . We have varied these model
parameters over wide range of values and, for each set
of values, we have identified the state of movement of
the wall. The corresponding observations for the symmetric case F∗c = F∗r = F∗ , are summarized in fig.5 in
the form of a phase diagram on the f − k plane. Since
no new motility state, other than those observed in the
symmetric case F∗c = F∗r are observed in the more general asymmetric case F∗c 6= F∗r , we have not drawn the
higher-dimensional phase diagram.
For high force ratio (f & 0.23) we observe transition

from (+) to (-) region through the (+-) region in between,
as the ratio k is varied. In contrast, for f . 0.23 the
system exhibits “re-entrance”; as k increases from 0.4
to 0.6, first a transition from the motility state (+-) to
the state (+0-) takes place and, at a somewhat higher
value of k a re-entrance to the state (+-) occurs. This
re-entrance phenomenon disappears at f & 0.23.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we have introduced a theoretical model
for studying the cargo-mediated collective kinetics of
polymerization and depolymerization of a bundle of parallel MTs that are not bonded laterally with one another.
Carrying out computer simulations of the model we have
identified and characterized the motility states of a hard
wall-like cargo that is pushed and pulled by this MT bundle that is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the wall.
Among these motility states, one corresponds to “no motion” (except for small fluctuations); it arises from the
“tug-of-war” between the polymerizing and depolymerizing MTs. The wall exhibits a bi-directional motion in
another motility state. The qualitative features of the
characteristics of this bi-directional state of motility of
the wall are similar to those observed in bi-directional
motion of vesicular cargo driven by antagonistic motor
proteins. But, as we have argued here, the physical
origin of the bidirectional motion in these two systems
are completely different. In the case of motor proteindriven vesicular cargo the bi-directional motion is caused
by an interplay of the stall force of the motors and the
load-dependent detachment of the motor from its track
[15]. In contrast, in our model of MT-driven wall, the bidirectional motion arises from a subtle interplay of the
stall force of the MTs and the load-dependent depolymerization of the MTs. This result should be regarded
also as a “proof-of-principle” that for bi-directional motion of the chromosomal cargo active participation motor proteins is not essential; in contrast to past claims in
the literature (see ref.[24] for a very recent claim), the
polymerization / depolymerization kinetics of the MTs
are adequate to cause bidirectional motion provided the
load-dependence of their rates are properly taken into
account. The latter principle will be elaborated further
elsewhere [16] in the context of chromosome segregation
with a more detailed theoretical model which also treats
the kinetochore wall as a soft elastic object [25].
