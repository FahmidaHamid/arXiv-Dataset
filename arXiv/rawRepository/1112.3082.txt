Theoretical Studies
of Structure-Function Relationships
in KV Channels:
Electrostatics of the Voltage Sensor
Alexander Peyser
March 16, 2015
Abstract
Voltage-gated ion channels mediate electrical excitability of cellular membranes. Reduced models of the voltage sensor (VS)
of Kv channels produce insight into the electrostatic physics underlying the response of the highly positively charged S4 transmembrane domain to changes in membrane potential and other electrostatic parameters. By calculating the partition function
computed from the electrostatic energy over translational and/or rotational degrees of freedom, I compute expectations of
charge displacement, energetics, probability distributions of translation & rotation and Maxwell stress for arrangements of
S4 positively charged residues and S2 & S3 negatively charged counter-charges; these computations can then be compared
with experimental results to elucidate the role of various putative atomic level features of the VS.
A ‘paddle’ model (Jiang et al., 2003) is rejected on electrostatic grounds, owing to unfavorable energetics, insufficient charge
displacement and excessive Maxwell stress. On the other hand, a ‘sliding helix’ model (Catterall, 1986) with three local
counter-charges, a protein dielectric coefficient of 4 and a 2/3 interval of counter-charge positioning relative to the S4 α-helix
period of positive residues is electrostatically reasonable, comparing well with Shaker (Seoh et al., 1996). Lack of countercharges destabilizes the S4 in the membrane; counter-charge interval helps determine the number and shape of energy barriers
and troughs over the range of motion of the S4; and the local dielectric coefficient of the protein (S2, S3 & S4) constrains the
height of energy maxima relative to the energy troughs.
These ‘sliding helix’ models compare favorably with experimental results for single & double mutant charge experiments on
Shaker by Seoh et al. (1996). Single S4 positive charge mutants are predicted quite well by this model; single S2 or S3 negative
counter-charge mutants are predicted less well; and double mutants for both an S4 charge and an S2 or S3 counter-charge
are characterized least well by these electrostatic models (which do not include gating load, unlike their biological analogs).
Further computational and experimental investigation of S2 & S3 counter-charge structure for voltage-gated ion channels is
warranted.

Introduction
potential into a flow-controlling action on the pore domain
(Kumanovics et al., 2002). The voltage sensor motif is homologous with voltage-sensitive proton conducting channels
(Hv , Ramsey et al., 2006). The physics underlying the wellknown function of the K+ and related Na+ and Ca2+ channels
(Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952a; Catterall, 1988) in terms of the
atomic structures developed over the last 20 years (Doyle
et al., 1998; Jiang et al., 2003) has still not been fully elucidated. Questions are still open regarding the precise electrostatics, thermodynamics and distributions of relative positions & motions of charges at physiological temperatures.

Electrical excitability of cells is possible because the movement of a few charges can control the flow of many charges.
This principle – amplification – led Hodgkin and Huxley
(1952b) to their theory of the action potential in terms of
electrically controlled membrane conductances (for an example of a computation of their model, see Fig. 1.1). Such conductances have been localized to channel proteins conducting Na+ , K+ , or Ca2+ ions. Besides a conductive port (composed of transmembrane domains S5 and S6, see Fig. 1.2),
the channels contain four transmembrane regions (labeled
S1-S4 starting from the amino end). In the S4 region, there
are a total of three to seven positively charged amino acid
residues, each arrayed at every third amino acid position.
An extensive electrophysiological data set exists on voltagecontrolled ionic conductance and the ‘gating current’ attributable to charges controlling the ionic port. A second
extensive data set has emerged from experiments measuring
structure. Both sets provide essential perspectives, but no
direct means to assess physical interactions in the structure
and the significance of physical interactions for function. In
this thesis, I attempt to bridge these perspectives computationally. I focus on electrostatics because the voltage-gated
ion channels are controlled by an applied electric field that
acts on intrinsic protein charges.

Each voltage sensor comprises four largely helical secondary structures. The S4 α-helix bears a positively charged
arginine or lysine residue at every third position while the S2
and S3 helices bear a smaller number of negatively charged
aspartate or glutamate residues (Noda et al., 1986). The
other residues of these membrane-spanning segments are
mostly hydrophobic. It has been proposed that the transmembrane electric field moves the S4 segment through a
combination of translation and rotation with respect to the
other helices and the lipid membrane (‘sliding helix’ hypothesis, Catterall 1986), or alternatively moves the S4 segment
in association with part of the S3 segment across the lipid
much like a large lipophilic ion (‘paddle’ hypothesis, Lee
et al. 2003).

Voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv ) are composed of two distinct functional elements, a ‘voltage sensor’ and a ‘pore
domain’. As described by Lee et al. (2005), they appear to be “membrane proteins with separate, weakly attached membrane-spanning domains”. Kv channels may
have evolved as the concatenation of two separate proteins,
one contributing a central tetrameric K+ conducting pore
and the other contributing a weakly-attached peripheral
voltage sensor which transduces changes in transmembrane

In both proposed mechanisms, multiple electric charges of
the channel protein move in the electric field of the membrane and therefore produce a displacement current (‘gating
current’, Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952b; Chandler and Meves,
1965; Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1973), as well as electric
work which could drive gating of ionic conductance (Hodgkin
and Huxley, 1952b). Translocation of these charges could
be facilitated by factors such as a local thinning of the lipid

the proportion of ‘activating or inactivating particles’ for a channel in the activating position: n for the activating K+ channel particles; m
for the activating Na+ channel particles; and h for the inactivating Na+ channel particles. Since the rate constants for the first derivative of
these variables were voltage dependent, the physical interpretation was of a charge-carrying voltage sensor driving the opening and closing of
ionic conductance.

pore’ (Parsegian, 1969; Perozo et al., 1993) or the provision
of counter-charges along the route of the moving S4 charges
by static residues of S2 and S3. The existence of a short
gating pore is indicated by the accessibility of modified S4
positions to extra- or intracellular cysteine reactants or protons (Yang et al., 1996). The relevance of counter-charges
has been indicated by neutralization mutants (Seoh et al.,
1996) and coordination of S4 charges with residues of opposite charge in recent crystallographic studies (Long et al.,
2007).
An understanding of the natural design of the voltage sensor needs to be based on a broad exploration of the components that have been discovered experimentally. The importance of design elements that have emerged from these
experiments should be evaluated. How do such elements determine sensor characteristics? How do their specific evolutionary layouts bring about voltage sensor behavior as seen
in different channel types? And as an important control, can
results of experimental mutations be predicted?
It is tempting to base exploration of a molecular device like
the voltage sensor solely on available information of atomic
structures, as represented in Fig. 1.3. The study of atomic
structures, however, is greatly limited in the case of the voltage sensor. Crystallization destroys the natural (dielectric)
environment of the structure and in particular the electric
field that the structure is designed to detect. Atomic-level
computations like those based on Molecular Dynamics (MD)
are speculative to the extent that they are based on questionable atomic coordinates. Moreover, they are currently
restricted to explorations of sub-microsecond episodes of dy-

namics of a few chosen initial configurations (Khalili-Araghi
et al., 2010).
In this thesis, I analyze reduced electrostatic models (see
Concepts, sec. 2.1) for the voltage sensor which can be thoroughly specified: charged rigid bodies moving through piecewise homogeneous dielectric domains. The sensor model is
embedded in a simulation cell mimicking a voltage-clamp
setup including electrodes, allowing macroscopically observed variables to be predicted from the microscopic model.
The electrostatics are solved self-consistently with numerical methods that allow systematic exploration. Specifically,
my computations construct an electrostatics-based partition
function of charge configuration with two degrees of freedom: rotation and translation of the S4 segment. Using
this partition function, I compute the expectation of random
variables such as charge displacement in response to voltage for comparison with experiment. These measures have
not been accessible in other computational studies (Bliznyuk
and Rendell, 2004; Chakrapani et al., 2008; Nishizawa and
Nishizawa, 2008; Khalili-Araghi et al., 2010).
My results show that a voltage sensor (VS) model involving a sliding S4 helix is realistic with respect to both gating charge and electrostatic energetics. A crucial component of this model is negative counter-charges arranged in
close proximity to buried S4 charges. The electrostatic design of this VS tolerates considerable variation resulting in
electrophysiologically interesting variations of sensor characteristics. Simulations of S4, S2 and S3 charge mutants in this
electrostatic model predict experimentally observed patterns
of charge displacement (Seoh et al., 1996).

Methods
components can distort the internal charge arrangements of
molecules or groups that are overall neutral into asymmetrical distributions of charge. Both the rotational alignment
of molecules with internal charge asymmetry and the distortion of symmetrical charge distributions in molecules are
abstracted as ‘polarization.’ Polarization of matter in an
electric field ‘induces’ charge that is hidden in the absence
of the field (Griffiths, 1999c, see Fig. 22). The most abundant polarizable molecule in VS system is the water of the
solutions bathing the membrane.

My approach to voltage sensor electrostatics has three major elements: (1) I use reduced physical descriptions of electrostatic components; (2) I compute predictions that correspond to experimental conditions and observables; and (3) I
develop a statistical-mechanical description of sensor behavior by exploring a wide range of sensor configurations.

2.1

Concepts

Reduced descriptions. By a ‘reduced model’, I mean a
model where some details are reduced in resolution; for example, in electrostatic models many charge distributions are
reduced to dielectric constants or tensors. The selection of
which features are to be reduced and which are to be represented at higher resolution is an iterative problem involving
the identification of the relevance of those features to the
measures of interest. All models that are not calculated by
ab initio quantum mechanical calculations are reduced in
this sense. By explicitly structuring a model with multiple
tiers of resolution and identifying the relevance of those components of the system to measures of interest, it is possible
to distinguish the dominant terms in the underlying physics.
Atomic matter is made of charged constituents, charged
nuclei and charged electrons (Feynman et al., 1963). The
crucial charges for this study are the uncompensated nuclear
charges in the arginine or lysine side chains of the S4 region
and the excess electronic charges of the glutamate and aspartate side chain in the S2 and S3 regions (Creighton, 1984;
Islas and Sigworth, 1999), out of the vast number of nuclei
and electrons in the system. Most of the ‘vast number’ of
charges form neutral atoms or molecules, but at close range
many molecules reveal spatial asymmetries in their internal
charge distributions. Moreover, the electric field from other

An ab initio (quantum mechanical) description of the
charged nuclei and electrons in a channel protein, membrane,
and embedding ionic solutions is not possible — approximations must be made. Approximate physical descriptions can
be made in multiple tiers of resolution: either the results of
lower tiers become parameters for higher-tier theory, or independent experimental results produce parameters for higher
tiers. For example, an ion is an atom or molecule in which
the number of nuclear elementary charges is not identical
to the number of electron charges. A classical approximation for an atomic ion is a point charge at the center of a
sphere where the effective diameter of the sphere that excludes other atoms can be determined from crystallographic
measurements. I use such a classical description for formal
charges explicitly included in models.
Polarization of neutral molecules and groups must also be
described by approximations. Voltage sensor charges buried
in the membrane polarize bath water. A reasonable starting point for a description of that polarization is a continuum description of the water. A space element containing polarizable molecules will exhibit polarization charges
on its surfaces when an electric field is present (Boda et al.,
2004). These surface charges represent the polarization of

9

the molecules in the space element: if these charges are included in a computation of the electric field, the molecular
polarization is accounted for. The amount of polarization
charge is proportional to the strength of the applied field
(over a range), and depends on the atomic/molecular composition of the matter in the space element. In the linear
range, the polarization charge at the surfaces of the space element is related to the field strength by a material coefficient
(or tensor for anisotropic polarization). Water polarization
can be described this way by one number, the dielectric coefficient. Furthermore since polarization involves a rearrangement of charges, polarization takes a finite amount of time to
develop or disappear. However, since voltage sensor relaxations are slow compared to typical polarization relaxations,
polarization can be approximated as instantaneous. For instance, the rotational relaxation time of water is on the order
of 10-11 s (Barthel et al., 1995), while voltage sensor relaxation times are on the order of > 10-5 s (Hille, 2001; Sigg
et al., 2003).
The channel and membrane are bathed in electrolyte solutions on either side. Electrostatic interactions involving
bath ions are reduced two orders of magnitude by the solvent (water) with respect to the vacuum. This reduction
is described by the dielectric coefficient of water. Furthermore, ions screen one another to an ionic concentrationdependent extent. Screening arrangements in solutions form
in nanoseconds (Barthel et al., 1995), which is much faster
than the time base for VS motion — like polarization, screening can be approximately described as instantaneous.
Screening by bath ions is modeled in my simulation
cells by placing the electrodes closer to the membrane
than would be done in an experiment. A diffuse layer
of screening counter-ions is electrostatically equivalent to
counter-charge smeared on a surface a Debye length from
the screened charge, which is the essential result of the
Debye-Hückel and Gouy-Chapman descriptions of screening (Debye and Hückel, 1923; Gouy, 1909; Chapman, 1913).
By varying the distance between the membrane and the
screening electrode surface, variations of bath ionic strength
can be mimicked (for example, offsets of 3 nm and 0 nm
bracket the Debye lengths of dilute [3 mM] and infinitely
concentrated solutions1 ). In the simulations reported here I
use the electrode geometries of Fig. 2.1, roughly equivalent
to bath solutions containing 3 mM salt. Experimental vari-

ation of bath ionic strength has relatively small effects on
experimental gating currents (Islas and Sigworth, 2001). Indeed, control computations (not shown) in which the water
domain is removed from the simulation and the electrodes
are placed directly on the membrane and protein surfaces (to
mimic infinite ionic strength) yield results similar to those
obtained with the simulation cells of Fig. 2.1.
Coupling microscopic VS motion to macroscopic experiments. Computer experiments provide insights into
microscopic systems that are difficult if not impossible to
obtain by conventional experiments. To estimate the functional competence of hypothetical structures, experimental
observables of function must be computed, and conditions
comparable to conventional experimental conditions must
be established. Gating current, the most direct observable
reporting VS motion, is recorded experimentally while applying a prescribed voltage across electrodes placed in the
electrolytes bathing the membrane (a voltage clamp). My
computational setup is designed to establish a voltage clamp
and record the charge displaced by VS motion in a manner
comparable to charge displacement recordings with macroscopic electrodes.
From electrostatics to statistical mechanics. The primary results of my computations are the electrostatic potential energy and gating charge corresponding to a particular
location of the formal charges of the voltage sensor model at
a particular applied voltage. (Another output is the Maxwell
stress, see below in Maxwell stress, subsec. 2.2.6). The efficiency of my computational methods allows me to compute
these variables for a very large number of VS configurations
and applied voltages, thus enabling me to elaborate a statistical (thermodynamic) view of VS configuration.
I explore a configuration space that includes the rotation
of the S4 helix about its axis and the translation of the
S4 charges along that axis at a fixed applied potential. A
partition function in those configurational degrees of freedom is constructed from the ensemble of Boltzmann factors for each electrostatic potential energy. Using the partition function, statistical expectations of equilibrium positions and displaced charges are obtained. In this way, I
determine both how the model will configure at a particular
membrane voltage, and along which average configurations
the model will re-configure as voltage is varied in small increments – these are equilibrium averages and not trajec-

tory calculations. The relation between gating charge and
voltage is predicted, allowing comparison with experimental
charge/voltage curves recorded from ensembles of voltage
sensors.

Computing the electrostatics

My general approach for computing the electric field in this
system is to superpose the vectorial Coulombic fields of
all charges. Likewise, the electrical potential is computed
by scalar superposition of the Coulombic potentials of all
charges (Jackson, 1999b, section 3). The contributions to
the field made by the S4 and other formal charges at known
positions are readily computed, but the charges on the electrodes and the polarization charges at dielectric interfaces
are initially unknown. The determination of the contribution of surface charges is a crucial (and computationally expensive) element of solving the electrostatics.

The typical simulation cell. A typical geometry for a
computational experiment is shown in 2.1 (a). The simulation environment is represented by an axial cross-section of
the radially symmetric three-dimensional domain swept by
rotating that cross-section about its vertical axis. The hemispheric boundaries (in green) are electrode surfaces kept at
controlled electrical potentials. The blue zones represent
aqueous baths (with a dielectric coefficient  = 80). The pink
zone is a region of small dielectric coefficient ( = 2) that
represents the lipid membrane. The brown zone represents
both the non-S4 components of the VS protein and the matrix of the S4 helix (the central cylinder). The helix crosses
the membrane through a ‘gating pore’ which extends the
baths into the region joining S4 and the rest of the protein.
The dielectric coefficient of this protein region is varied in
my simulations to assess its importance for VS motion. The
dielectrics in this reduced model are piecewise uniform and
therefore have sharp boundaries (solid black lines). Point
charges representing S4 and other charges (not shown) are
embedded in the region of protein dielectric.
VS motion is simulated in this geometry by moving only
the S4 charges within the fixed cylinder bounding the S4
helix. Simulating S4 motion this way (by moving charges
and not dielectric boundaries) greatly reduces the computational costs of solving the electrostatics since solving for the
effects of moving dielectric boundaries requires recomputing
the matrix inversion (see Matrix inversion, subsec. 2.2.2). The
dielectric geometry as defined is invariant in terms of rotation. Only the end caps of the S4 are not invariant in terms of
central-axis translation. If those ends of the biological S4 are
translated, which is not well defined experimentally, then the
positionally fixed end-points of the S4 in these simulations
would not capture the movement of surface charge on those
S4 ends. However, the surface charge on those ends would
move outside the region of high electrical travel close to the
gating pore (Nonner et al., 2004, Fig. 1), therefore adding
little to either the charge displacement terms or the associated energy terms. Charge/end-surface interaction terms
could only become significant at the extrema of S4 charge
motion along the central axis.

Since dielectrics are involved, a precise definition of
‘charge’ is needed for the following mathematical treatment.
I follow the nomenclature of Jackson (1999a), who distinguishes between ‘source’ and ‘induced’ charges. The formal
charge on a side-chain of the S4 region (one proton charge)
is a source charge, as are charges placed by the external
voltage clamp circuit on the electrodes. Induced charges
comprise those charges appearing on dielectric boundaries
in response to the fields of source charges and other induced
charges. It is convenient to combine spatially inseparable
source and induced charges into ‘effective’ charges. Specifically, I assign to a point source charge (qs ) embedded in a
dielectric () an effective charge (q = qs /), combining the
source charge and the polarization induced at the dielectric
boundary around that source charge (−qs (−1)/). In other
words, the effective point charge is the sum of the source and
induced charges, expressing the fact that the field produced
by a source charge in a dielectric is  times weaker than the
field of the source charge in vacuum. Electrode charges are
also represented in computations by effective charges, which
eliminates the need to specify polarizable matter outside the
cell. Finally, induced charge on a dielectric boundary separated from any source charge is formally treated as an effective charge (lacking a source charge component). Thus, all
charges are expressed in computations as effective charges.
The field computed from effective charges is identical to the
superposition of the fields of the source charges and their
polarization charges. That superposition of fields is the field
that must be computed for the computer experiments presented here.

Figure 2.1: Cross-sections of the simulation cells for the sliding helix model (a) and the paddle model (b). The 3D setup is produced by
rotating the cross-section about its vertical axis. The setup is bounded by two hemispherical bath electrodes (in green). Their potentials are
maintained at prescribed values as the S4 segment is moved (voltage clamp). The cylindrical electrode (in gold) completing the boundary is
a guard. It is divided into rings maintained at potentials that are linearly graded between the potentials of the bath electrodes. The interior
is divided into two aqueous baths (in blue) separated by a lipid membrane (in pink) and, in the sliding helix model, a VS protein region (in
brown) forming a gating pore around the sliding S4 helix. In the paddle model, no distinction is made between membrane and protein — the
S4 charges (not shown) are embedded in the membrane. The charge configuration of the sliding helix model is shown in Fig. 2.2.

2.2.1

Electrical geometry made discrete

on the element. Properly choosing the tile size to conform
to that approximation requires numerical controls described
later (Gauss box, subsec. 2.2.3). There is one unknown to be
determined for each surface element: its surface charge. Below, I will show how one linear equation can be obtained per
surface element. Solving the system of these linear equations
yields all unknown charges, which typically involves 4000–
10000 surface elements of different sizes (and that number of

To compute the charges on the electrodes and dielectric
boundaries, the boundary surfaces are tiled into curved
quadrangular surface elements (Fig. 2.2 for the sliding helix model & Fig. 2.3 for the paddle model). The size of
these surface elements is chosen such that the charge density present on an element can be approximated as uniform

recover the total integral number of charges within volumes
surrounded by closed surfaces, see Gauss box, subsec. 2.2.3).
The electrodes impose voltage clamp conditions. In the
discrete representation of the electrode surface, the potential at the center of an electrode element (i) assumes a prescribed value (Vi ). The potential at the center of that element results from the superposition of the potentials due to
all charges (j), including that of element i itself:

where n is the unit normal vector from the region of  = 1 to
the region of  = 2 . Furthermore the normal field strength
exactly at the surface, without including the field due to
induced charge on that surface (E⊥ ), is the average of the
normal field strength at an infinitesimal distance from the
surface including all charges:

(2.1)
E⊥ =

The definition of the distance |rij | for a surface charge j depends on the distance of that element from element i. The
surface charge of a distant element is combined into a single
point charge located at the charge center of that element,
and |rij | is defined as the distance between those points.
The surface charge of a proximate element (in particular,
element j = i itself) is divided into smaller charges obtained
by sub-tiling element j into a number of subelements (typically 4 × 4 for j 6= i, and 10 × 10 for j = i). Each subelement
carries a fraction of element j’s charge, and 1/|rij | is defined
as equal to the weighted average by subelement area of the
inverse distances for all subelements to the center of i. The
subelements follow the curvature of the surface element.
A correct representation of surface curvature and the curvature’s effects on charge distribution is crucial for numerical
accuracy. Inhomogeneities in charge distribution are particularly problematic when source or other induced charges are
close to the surface element. If the element has curvature,
the charge induced on one part of the element will induce
charge at close range on other parts of the same element.
Inaccuracies due to charge inhomogeneity and surface curvature are limited by choosing an adequate initial tiling and
sub-tiling as needed.
The boundary condition describing the effect on the field
due to dielectric boundary elements can be expressed in two
equivalent ways. One way of describing the boundary condition is that the normal components of the field strengths on
⊥
each side of the boundary (E⊥
1 and E2 ) are inversely related
to the dielectric coefficients of each region (Griffiths, 1999c,

The difference between E⊥

with the field of the polarization charge at the surface which
has a magnitude of σ/20 in both normal directions (Griffiths, 1999b, 17).
Eqs. 2.2–2.4 can be combined into one expression relating
the density of induced polarization charge (σi ) to the normal
field strength on the surface of dielectric boundary element

If charge j is the charge of a distant surface element, it is

in (2.6) is replaced by its weighted average (by subelement
area) taken over all subelements of j. Note that qj is the
effective charge of each entity.
Eqs. 2.1 and 2.5 suffice to compute all initially unknown
surface (electrode or dielectric) charges. With these charges
known, all charges in the system are known. The electric
field can then be computed for any location by superposition
of the Coulombic fields of individual charges (using appropriate sub-tiling for nearby surface charges).

shapes that can be produced by turning a piece on a lathe,
including hollow shapes (cylindrically symmetrical). Techniques for tiling discretely more general surfaces are known
and could be used together with my method for solving
the electrostatics needed to explore more general geometries
than those in this study.
The electrostatic field is long-range — the field strength
at all locations depends on all charges. Since the coefficient matrix for those relations is dense, the computational
method chosen for solving the linear equations to determine
surface charges is LU decomposition (Bowdler et al., 1971,
implementation by Whaley and Dongarra, 1997). Inverting an N × N matrix by LU decomposition requires order
N 3 operations. Fortunately however, the LU decomposition
needs to be executed only once for a given surface geometry.
If source charges are moved, the electrostatic equations can
be solved by repeated back-substitutions using the inverse
matrix, requiring order N 2 operations.

2.2.3

by S4 charges, which can be done by verifying Gauss’ law
for each position of the S4. For instance, the sum of all S4
and other source charges contained in the region of protein
dielectric in Fig. 2.1 (a) must be accurately recovered by
summing the normal field strength multiplied by the permittivity andP
the element area, over
P the surface bounding
that region ( j∈S j 0 Ej⊥ aj =
i∈V qs,i , where j varies
over all elements of the closed surface S and i varies over all
charges within the volume V enclosed by S).
My approach to solving the electrostatics differs from the
more common approach of solving Poisson’s equation on
a spatial grid. The approach I use (Boda et al., 2004) is
based on relations describing boundary conditions (making
the method a ‘boundary element method’, BEM). The resulting boundary integral equations are made discrete on a
surface grid. Owing to the relatively small number of surface elements compared to the number of volume elements,
a full description of the charge distribution and therefore
the electric field can be stored in computer volatile memory. From this information any desired electrostatic output
variable can be computed. Exhaustive a posteriori tests of
solution accuracy are possible, such as verification of results
by checking the consistency of calculated surfaces charges
against the integral number of charges enclosed using Gauss’
law.

Gauss box: A control for numerical
accuracy

The error from approximating the surface charge distribution as piecewise uniform can be assessed using Gauss’ law.
(The approximation requires that the field strength at any
point on a surface element equals the field strength measured
at the center of charge of the element.) Gauss’ law states
that the integral of the electrical flux normal to a closed
surface over that closed surface is proportional to the total
source charge contained in the enclosed volume (Jackson,
1999d, 39):

Computation of gating charge

charge movements are restricted to a subrange of the
distance between the electrodes. The electrodes record a
displacement current due to the variations of the electrical
field produced at the electrodes by the S4 charges. It is
important to assess this charge displacement because the
displacement current (and therefore its integral, the charge
displacement) can be directly observed in experiments: the
displacement charge is the ‘gating charge’.
The electrode charge displaced by the motion of S4 charges
is assessed in independent ways to check numerical accuracy.
One method directly measures the integral of the displacement that reaches the internal or external electrode. Convenient surfaces for measuring this displacement are the internal and external dielectric boundaries of the membrane
and protein. Since the electric field strength perpendicular
to these surfaces has already been determined in the computation of induced charge, the electrical fluxes through these
surfaces can be computed via integration of the known norS4

i∈V

This conservation law holds for any closed surface of any
shape, and thus applies to any geometry of interest.
Since the density of polarization charge induced by a
charge on a dielectric boundary is particularly inhomogeneous when the charge is close to the surface, the local surface region proximate to other charges must be made into
smaller discrete surface elements. On the other hand, an
excessive number of surface elements is computationally expensive. Since S4 charges move relative to dielectric boundaries in my computer experiments, all S4 positions must be
taken into account in designing surface tiling. The adequacy
of the surface tiling must be checked for all positions taken

A method to solve for charge displacement is provided by
the Ramo-Shockley theorem (Shockley, 1938; Ramo, 1939).
This method first solves the electric field determining the
‘electrical distance’ of a source charge, which is the field
produced by the electrodes in the absence of source charges
inside the simulation cell. The gating charge corresponding
to an S4 position in a simulation including all charges is
given by scaling source charges by their respective electrical
travel:

force on the VS, both translational and rotational. Integrating the force along the path of movement gives the required
work for moving the VS between the endpoints of the probed
path:
X Z rs,new
∆W =
qs
E(rs ) · drs
(2.9)
s

where the summation is over the source charges (qs ) moving
with the VS, and E is the field produced by all charges of the
system, excluding qs itself. Note that the electrode charge is
continually updated by the voltage clamp as the VS moves
along the path.
This method of computing work requires that an entire
path be scanned at small intervals for a path integral. It
is computationally expensive and generates cumulative numerical errors. A more efficient method based on a direct
calculation of work is desirable, one that only needs to probe
the endpoints of the path. However, I have used the path integration of force as a useful control for other methods that
compute work.
A highly efficient method to compute work can be constructed using the Ramo-Shockley theorem. This method
requires the computation of the configurational energy when
the electrodes are grounded (hence Vm = 0) and the charge
displacement for a given configuration of source charges.
Computation of the charge displacement is described in Computation of gating charge, subsec. 2.2.4, and the method for
computing configurational energy when Vm = 0 follows here.
The configurational energy considered in my simulations
is the electrostatic energy (including all implicit polarization
stress). The configurational energy at a given potential is the
interaction energy of every charge in the system with: the
source charges; induced dielectric polarization charges (including implicit microscopic stress from polarization); and
the charges on the electrodes:

where U is the potential with all source charges removed
and the external electrode fixed at 1 volt; and r0j to r00j are
the endpoints of the trajectory of qj . This method has been
described for simulation cells like the ones used in this study
(Nonner et al., 2004). An important implication of this theorem is that the gating charge contributed by an S4 charge
is exclusively determined by the position of the S4 charge
in the simulated system. It is entirely independent of other
source charges, fixed or moving, that exist in the system.
Another implication of the Ramo-Shockley theorem is
used in the computation of potential energy (described below
in Electrostatic potential energy, subsec. 2.2.5). The RamoShockley theorem implies that applying a voltage to the electrodes modifies the electrical potential at the location of a
charge by the fraction of applied voltage corresponding to
the electrical distance of that charge (U (rj )/1 V). This is
true regardless of the presence of other charges and of dielectrics in the system.

Electrostatic potential energy

The charges of the VS move in an electric field that originates from other intrinsic charges, charges induced on dielectric boundaries, and charges delivered from an external
battery to the electrodes to establish a voltage clamp (or
under natural conditions from the charges that produce the
action potential). There are therefore both internal and external sources of electrical work. The biological purpose of
the voltage sensor is to transduce electrical work from this
environment into mechanical or other work that is applied
to other parts of the channel, in particular toward operating
the gate of the conducting pore.
The VS can be viewed as traveling in a force field that is
probed by fixing the positions of the VS while measuring the

Wconfig = Ws + Wdiel + Wel

(2.10)

where the interaction energy (with all charges) of: source
charges is Ws ; induced charges for dielectrics is Wdiel ; and
electrode charges is Wel .
The configurational energy can also be decomposed into
the total electrostatic interaction of all explicit charges in
the system plus the implicit mechanical energy of twisting

and stretching the polarized molecules:
Wconfig = Welectrostatic + Wdiel,stress
1X

qj V (rj ) + Wdiel,stress

field produced by all charges, including those produced by
dielectric polarization and charges on the electrodes.
(2.11)
The Ramo-Shockley based method used for the efficient computation of electrostatic potential energy is based
on the fact that the Ramo-Shockley theorem allows the dissection of the total electrostatic work (including configurational and displacement energies) into two components ∆W1
and ∆W2 , computed separately as follows (He, 2001):

The totalPelectrostatic energy of a discrete charge distribution is 21 j qj V (rj ), where qj are all the source and induced
charges in vacuo including dielectric and electrode charges,
and V (rj ) is the potential due to all charges not located
at rj (Griffiths, 1999b). For dielectric polarization charges,
the additional mechanical term Wdiel,stress corresponds to
the mechanical work of twisting and stretching polarized
molecules, including any implicit electric fields involved in
these deformations.
The configurational
energy when the electrodes are

is then:

1. With zero voltage applied to the electrodes, compute
the configurational energies for the given old and new
positions of the VS charges. If the position of VS charges
change in terms of electrical distance between these two
geometrical positions, displacement charge flows from
one electrode to the other.
Since both electrodes are at the same potential, no work
is involved in that charge displacement. Hence,

where V (r) is the potential due to all charges not located
at r, qs are the source (not effective) point charges, qd
are all induced polarization charges on dielectric boundaries
and surrounding source charges, and qel are all charges on
electrodes. The work to polarize dielectric boundaries is
Wdiel ≡ 0 since there must be no net electrical and mechanical work on induced charges at equilibrium (Griffiths,
1999c, pg. 193). Additionally, no work is required to place
charges at the electrodes (Wel = 0) when the electrodes are
grounded: V (rel ) = 0.

Therefore, the total potential energy change sensed by the
VS is:
Vm=0
Vm=0
∆W = Wconfig,new

(2.16)

This work defines the ‘electrostatic potential energy landscape’ in which the VS operates under an applied voltage.
Note that the configurational energy only needs to be determined for one applied voltage, 0 mV. Landscapes for any
applied voltage can then be computed once the displacement charge for the S4 charge position at that applied voltage is known. The displacement charge itself is efficiently
computed using the Ramo-Shockley theorem as described
previously (Eq. 2.8). Note that for all graphs, electrostatic
potential energy of the VS will be reported relative to the
0 nm translation position (and 0◦ rotation for potential energy landscapes).

Therefore, the total configurational energy when the electrodes are grounded is:

In other words, the total configurational energy is equal to

Maxwell stress

With this partition function known, the probability of a
configuration is:

Charges buried in the protein polarize water in the baths
and attract induced polarization charges. The polarization
charges are induced on the water surface, and their attraction produces a pressure (normal component of the Maxwell
stress) that tends to bring water toward the charges buried
in the protein. If a lipid bilayer is uniformly charged to
400 mV, the electrostrictive pressure across the bilayer is
about 0.3 MPa (3 atm). This condition typically breaks
the bilayer by hypothetically stabilizing the formation and
expansion of transmembrane pores (Melikov et al., 2001;
Troiano et al., 1998).
The normal component of the Maxwell stress (pressure, P)
acting at a dielectric surface is the product of the induced
surface charge density (σ) and the normal component of the
electric field at that surface (E⊥ ):
P = σE⊥

The random variables of interest are the rotational and
translational positions, the associated gating charge and the
Maxwell stress. These are computed for 1 mV steps in the
range from -100 mV to +100 mV of membrane voltage.
I also compute the expectation of electrostatic potential
energy for the VS at the particular translational positions
with rotational equilibrium established at each translational
position. The statistical weights are then given by the rotational partition function for that translational position.

(2.17)

Both quantities on the right hand side are computed in
my electrostatic analysis of the system (Eq. 2.5). Maxwell
stress may stabilize or destabilize structures composed of
charges embedded in a weak dielectric. Therefore, I assess
the strength and distribution of the normal component of
Maxwell stress for VS models.

Details of the simulation environment

The model comprises a region of inhomogeneous dielectrics
surrounded by an eggshell-shaped system of electrodes
(Fig. 2.1). The electrode eggshell is composed of three regions: two half-spheres (of radius r = 5.0 nm) interconnected by an open cylinder (of radius r = 5.0 nm and height
d = 3.0 nm). The intracellular hemisphere is at a fixed potential ψ/2, where ψ is the applied transmembrane voltage;
the extracellular hemisphere electrode is anti-symmetrically
fixed at −ψ/2. The cylindrical electrode joining the hemispherical electrodes is subdivided into bands, each of which
is held at the potential −ψ ∗ z/d, where z is the height of the
center of the band relative to the midpoint of the system,
and d is the total length of the cylinder. Therefore the potential on the cylinder varies linearly from −ψ/2 at the junction
with the extracellular electrode, to 0 at the midpoint, to ψ/2
at the junction with the intracellular electrode.
The space enclosed by the electrodes is divided into four
volumes: the two aqueous baths, the membrane and the
protein. The membrane is a disk of the same height as the
cylinder electrode (3.0 nm) and has a radius of 5.0 nm. It
has a fixed dielectric coefficient m = 2, representing its lipid
composition. The protein region is located in the center of

Statistical mechanics

A partition function is computed from the electrostatic potential energy. The configuration space has two degrees of
freedom in VS motion: rotation and translation. The partition function (“the key principle of statistical mechanics,”
Feynman 1988) in discrete configuration space is:
X
Q=
e−Eij /kB T
(2.18)
i,j

where i and j are the indices of the rotational and translational discrete positions; Eij is the electrostatic potential
energy of the VS in configuration (i, j); kB is the Boltzmann
constant; and T is absolute temperature.
Movement of S4 charges is restricted in my studies to the
rotational range of −180◦ to +180◦ and a typical translation
range of −1.925 nm to +1.925 nm relative to the central
position. Each degree of freedom is made discrete in 50
increments resulting in a total of 2500 energy computations
for the discrete partition function.

the simulation environment and spans the membrane (its
dielectric is described by a varied dielectric coefficient, p );
for the paddle model, p = m . The space between the upper surface of the membrane/protein and the extracellular
electrode and the space between the lower surface and the
intracellular electrode is an aqueous region with a fixed dielectric coefficient of w = 80.
For all statistical mechanics calculations, simulation temperature is fixed at 30◦ C (see eqs. 2.18-2.20).

2.3.1

ratios of counter- and S4 charges are referred to by fractions
between 1/2 and 3/2. There are three counter-charges, centered at the midpoint of the membrane. To simulate experiments with charge neutralization mutants, some of these
counter-charges are either eliminated for specific computations or replaced with dipoles.
The relationship of S4 charges and counter-charges for a
given translation is given in Fig. 2.4. In figures mapping
translation to applied voltage (such as Fig. 3.5 a), the translational axis is labeled in terms of that offset — the distance between the center of the S4 charges and the center of
the model membrane and counter-charges along the translational axis of motion, which is the vertical coordinate in
Fig. 2.1.

Sliding helix model

Embedded at the center of the membrane is the protein region (of p ) representing the S4 and the surrounding transmembrane domains; p is varied by experiment, but for most
cases is set at 4. The protein region is radially symmetric,
of radius 2.15 nm.
Moving radially inward from the membrane juncture,
there is the ‘gating pore’ from 1.966 nm to 1.266 nm. The
surface smoothly dips from a depth of ± 1.5 nm at the
juncture with the membrane to the total height of counter
charges plus 0.3 nm on either side (between ± 0.6 nm to
± 0.975 nm); the S2 and S3 counter-charges are placed
equally close to the protein/water interface for all variations.
The pore is smoothed by rounded corners of radius 0.15 nm.
At the center is the surface of the S4 proper, of radius
1.266 nm and length 6.5 nm. The α-helix lies within this
envelope. The S4 charges are at a radius of 1.0 nm, each
split into 3 charges of 1/3 eo on a circle of radius 0.122 nm
centered around the charge position (Fig. 2.2). This reflects
the structure of arginine residues’ guanido group charge distribution. The S4 charges are separated in the z-direction by
0.45 nm and in the xy-plane by 60◦ (each sixth residue completes a full turn counter to the direction of the α-helix).
There are 6 S4 charges, some of which are eliminated or
replaced with dipoles in specific computations to simulate
charge-neutralization mutants.
Counter-charges are located in the protein dielectric on
a curve of 1.4 nm radius, concentric to the curve of the S4
charges. Counter-charges are generally spaced at angular
intervals different from those of the S4 charges; the interval

Dipole mutants. To simulate charge neutralization mutants from charged residues to glutamine or asparagine
residues, two methods are used: simple elimination of a net
charge as described previously or replacement of the charge
by a dipole. The dipole is centered at the same position
as the center of the original S4 charge or S2 & S3 countercharge. The orientation of the dipole is radial, with the
negatively charged end pointing towards the central (z) axis
of the simulation setup and the positive end pointing away
from the central axis. The charges of the dipole are separated by 0.27 nm and the magnitude of each charge is 1/2
e0 (Pauling, 1960; Lozano-Casal et al., 2008). This dipole
representation of the mutant produces favorable interactions
not present in the representation by simple charge deletion.

2.3.2

Paddle model

In simulations of the ‘paddle’ model, the S4 region is entirely
buried in the membrane region with the axis of the helix
parallel to the membrane plane. The number of S4 charges is
four (as in Kv AP). Since the radius of the α-helix is 1.122 nm,
the membrane thickness is extended by 0.5 nm to 3.5 nm,
allowing translational motion as well as rotational motion of
the S4 helix within the membrane. I explore the range of
motion possible without the emergence of the S4 region into
the baths.

Results and Discussion
charges that are in the membrane electric field at a
given moment. That number of charges is also a determinant of the slope of the gating-charge/voltage (Q/V)
relationship. The VS model therefore must predict the
slope of the experimental Q/V curve.

Can an electrostatically viable voltage sensor model be constructed on the basis of proposed models? If such a model
is at hand, its sensitivity to model parameter variation can
be explored in order to understand why the model works.
Verifiable predictions can be made about the electrostatic
consequences of charge mutants. I will consider three criteria in evaluating VS models:

My computations simulate an individual, isolated VS. The
VS is therefore simulated under ‘zero-load’ conditions: it
does not drive the gating machinery that a real VS would
drive when integrated in the channel. Since experimental
gating currents have been recorded only from whole channels, the VS performance parameters derived from these experiments likely need to be exceeded by a viable VS model
studied under zero-load conditions. Specifically, the total
charge movement, slope of the Q/V curve and rate of motion are expected to be reduced in a VS operating under its
natural load.
In the following simulations, the S4 helix is modeled as
a solid body with embedded positive charges which move
with two degrees of freedom, translation and rotation about
the helix axis. Counter-charges are kept in fixed positions.
These constraints are a first step toward understanding the
electrostatics of the VS. If the VS is deformed in addition to
the translation and rotation of S4, then total gating charge,
internal friction, energy barriers and force developed will be
affected.

1. The VS model produces adequate gating charge. For
Shaker K+ channels (Jan et al., 1977; Hoshi et al.,
1990), a total gating charge movement of > 3 e0 per
channel subunit is expected (Schoppa et al., 1992; Sigg
et al., 1994; Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996). When
the membrane potential changes from a large negative
to a large positive value, this charge determines how
large the change in electric potential energy is for an
individual VS.
2. The model VS moves at the time scale of gating. Since
such motion occurs in condensed matter, its rate is limited by friction and possibly energy barriers. Consider
the passage of a single K+ ion across the pore of a
K+ channel: in a large-conductance Ca2+ -activated K+
channel, a typical passage time is on the order of 30 ns
(corresponding to ≈ 20 pA conducted by a queue of
3 K+ ). If the VS experiences at least as much friction
as the friction in K+ motion through a channel pore
(even though the VS is considerably larger than K+ )
and the VS completes its motion within 3 ms (Islas and
Sigworth, 1999), then it can not encounter electrostatic
energy barriers greater than 11.5 kT (≈ 0.3 eV).

3.1

A ‘paddle’ model

In the original version of the paddle model (Lee et al., 2003),
the S4 helix was embedded in the membrane lipid (like a paddle in water) and the proposed motion was like the transfer of
a large lipophilic ion between the two lipid/water interfaces.

3. The model VS provides adequate force for operating
parts of the channel molecule constituting the gate of
the pore. This force is related to the number of VS

22

This model has been found electrostatically implausible in a
previous computational study because the electrostatic work
required to translocate the multiply-charged S4 helix across
the weak dielectric of the lipid is very large (Grabe et al.,
2004). The original paddle model has been modified since
its inception; a recently proposed version (Tao et al., 2010)
has gained features of the sliding helix models that I have
analyzed and which are described below (A ‘sliding helix’
model, sec. 3.2), while losing paddle-like features. This section presents computations of the original paddle model to
assess how unfavorable electrostatic features produce unfavorable consequences for the stability and function of a VS
design.
I have simulated an S4 helix whose movements are computationally restricted to not extend the helix beyond the
boundaries of the lipid membrane. Electrostatic potential
energy of the VS (with respect to the central position) is
computed while varying the position in two degrees of freedom. The S4 helix is translated between the two membrane
boundaries with its axis kept parallel to the boundaries and
allowed to rotate fully about its axis. Electrostatic potential
energy maps for three different applied membrane voltages
are shown in Fig. 3.1 (a-c), with energy represented in false
color. Note that these energy maps are similar for all applied voltages, as if applied voltage has a relatively small
effect relative to the contributions of other simulation parameters.
Panel (d) of Fig. 3.1 displays the mean electrostatic potential energy of the VS as a function of translation. This
energy is computed by averaging over all rotational angles
of the paddle using the statistical weights of the rotational
partition function (see Statistical mechanics, subsec. 2.2.7). In
other words, the energy for each angle is used in a Boltzmann
factor to statistically weigh that energy to derive an overall
expectation energy for that translational position; graphically, one point for a curve at specific potential in panel (d) is
the expectation value calculated from the matching column
(by translation) of the respective potential energy graph of
panels (a-c).
The energy in (d) has a large maximum when the S4 axis
is in the center of the membrane, more than 0.5 eV above the
energy at the extreme points of the scanned range of translation (Grabe et al. 2004 scanned a wider range of translation and obtained an even larger variation of energy). The

variation of electrostatic potential energy due to the varied
applied membrane voltage are indeed small compared to the
large electrostatic barrier. The energy profile makes this VS
in essence a bistable structure. When in one extreme position, the S4 is very unlikely to ever flip to the other position.
My energy computations with this paddle model also reveal that translating the helix produces strong rotational
forces. At the end points of the ± 0.5 nm translations from
the center, electrostatic potential energy of the VS is minimal
in different rotational positions. This applies for all tested
membrane voltages. The differences between favorable and
unfavorable rotational positions approach 1 eV, making it
highly unlikely that the S4 segment could undergo translation without rolling by about half a turn. A proposed model
in which the S4 helix moves by translation alone would produce energetically unstable configurations. If the helix is
allowed to follow electrostatic force in the rotational degree
of freedom, the electrostatics of this paddle model antagonize VS function (Fig. 3.1 d).
Lipid bilayers tend to break down when voltages larger
than 400 mV are applied (Melikov et al., 2001; Troiano et al.,
1998). The electrostrictive pressure across the bilayer under those conditions is ≈ 0.3 MPa (3 atm). In the paddle
model, electrical charges are located inside the lipid membrane and create strong electric fields. These fields polarize
the water adjacent to the membrane, inducing charge at the
lipid/water boundaries. S4 and induced charges attract one
another; therefore, the lipid/water boundaries are attracted
toward the S4 charges. This is the Maxwell stress. I have
computed Maxwell stress on the lipid/water interface (see
Maxwell stress, subsec. 2.2.6) to see how this stress relates
to the electrostrictive pressure known to break lipid bilayers. For this paddle model, the Maxwell stress on membrane
boundary regions near the S4 charges is very large. Fig. 3.2
shows the pressure distributions on the internal and external
bath boundaries with a logarithmic false-color scale (pressures range from 102 Pa in blue to 2.5 × 108 Pa in red). The
peak pressure on the bath boundaries is much larger than a
safe electrostrictive stress, even if the S4 axis is centered in
the membrane (the minimal Maxwell stress configuration).
The likely consequence of the large Maxwell stresses of the
paddle model is that the lipid retreats and thus exposes the
charged surface of the helix to both baths. Such a configuration would not function as voltage sensor.

the direction normal to the membrane plane. The S4 segment is buried in the lipid in all scanned translational positions. Rotation is about
the S4 axis. Electrostatic potential energy strongly favors positions near the bath interfaces at all applied voltages. Panel (d): Rotationaveraged electrostatic potential energy versus translation for three applied voltages (averaging is based on the rotational partition function).
Since electrostatic potential energy depends on rotational position (panel a), allowing the S4 helix to rotate minimizes energy. Nevertheless,
the profile of averaged energy is parabolic, and applied membrane voltage does not remove the large barrier to S4 translation. Note that
panels (a-c) show the electrostatic potential energy of the VS relative to that at translation 0 nm and rotation 0◦ of that graph (Eq. 2.16),
while panel (d) shows electrostatic potential energy of the VS relative to translation 0 nm (expectation over the rotational degree of freedom).

Figure 3.2: A paddle configuration is mechanically unstable. False-color maps of the Maxwell stress acting on the water/lipid interfaces.
This stress tends to pull the water boundary toward the S4 charges. Logarithmic color scale goes from 102 Pa (blue) through 105 Pa (green)
to 2.5 × 108 Pa (red). The surface area shown is 10 nm in diameter. (An electrostrictive pressure of ≈ 3 × 105 Pa is known to break a
lipid bilayer.) The position in the membrane of the S4 segment is controlled by the applied membrane voltage (0 or +100 mV), and the
Maxwell stress shown is the expectation of the Maxwell stress (based on the translational/rotational partition function). A supplementary
movie (flat-paddle.mp4 [suppl.]) shows how Maxwell stress varies as applied voltage is varied between -100 and +100 mV.

3.2

A ‘sliding helix’ model

electrostatic energetics of this model are consistent with a
screw motion — the rotation is a physical consequence of
the electrostatics. This voltage sensor strongly resists either
exclusively translational or exclusively rotational motion.
As I do for the paddle model, I assess the mechanical stability of the dielectric geometry of the sliding helix model
using the computed Maxwell stress. Fig. 3.4 shows the pressure distribution on the protein/water interface (note that
the invaginated interface has been mapped onto a plane, see
figure legend). Both the intra- and extracellular pressure
distributions are shown for a simulation with applied voltages of 0 mV or +100 mV.
The Maxwell stress for the sliding helix model is largest
where charges are close to the bath interface. Large stresses
appear at the water interfaces of the S4 helix where charges
face a bath. These stresses do not compromise mechanical
stability since the charged groups are in direct contact with
water. The surface region lining the gating pore receives a
moderate Maxwell stress, except for one angular region located at the bottom of the gating pore close to the innermost
and outermost counter-charges (the gating pore is located
between the white and yellow rings in Fig. 3.4). There, local
Maxwell stress is on the order of 108 Pa. This magnitude of
stress provides a physical cause for the invagination of the
water boundary into a nano-scale gating pore, which requires
work against the surface tension of the water/protein interface. The existence of a gating pore is thus made plausible
by the electrostatics, although the gating pore postulated in
the model is not a computed consequence of the physics at
this level of modeling. The Maxwell stress due to the nearsurface counter-charge is narrowly localized so that it, by
itself, would not produce a full-circular gating pore like that
assumed in the model. On the other hand, S4 gating charges
could help stabilize a larger gating pore on the side(s) where
they are exposed.
Since this particular sliding helix model has desirable
properties, I compute the partition function over the rotational and translational degrees of freedom for stepwise
varied applied voltages. The expectation values of rotational and translational positions and of the predicted gating
charge can thereby be determined as functions of voltage.
The relationship between displaced gating charge and voltage is a prediction of the gating charge per VS displaced
when a voltage is applied to an ensemble of channels in an
experiment.
Figs. 3.5 (a) & (b) show the expectation of position for the
model VS at given voltages. The positions follow the trajec-

The sliding helix models investigated here are VS models in
which the axis of the S4 helix is oriented perpendicularly
to the plane of the membrane. Two independent kinds of
motion are allowed: translation along the axis of the S4 helix and rotation about the axis. No particular trajectory in
these degrees of freedom is prescribed. Thus both motions
envisaged for the ‘helical screw’ hypothesis of S4 motion are
possible but are not a priori coupled to one another as the
term ‘screw’ would imply. A concentric invagination of the
protein dielectric around the S4 helix forms a ‘gating pore’.
In addition to the S4 positive charges, three negative point
charges are present in the protein domain. For the specific version of the sliding helix that I consider in this section, these are aligned in a spiral pattern concentric to that
of the S4 charges, but the angular and translational intervals between the counter-charges are chosen to be two-thirds
(2/3) that of the S4 charge interval (i.e., 40◦ and 0.3 nm).
The counter-charge positions are fixed. The dielectric of
the protein is represented by a dielectric coefficient of 4.
These parameters have been chosen via an iterative process
to identify the envelope of parameters that are physically
reasonable and consonant with known biology.
The landscape of electrostatic potential energy (Fig. 3.3)
is very different from that computed for the paddle model.
When a membrane voltage of 0 mV is applied, a trough of
electrostatic potential energy tends to confine the S4 charges
to a range of positions which can be reached by moving the
S4 helix like a screw (Fig. 3.3 a). Thus the S4 segment in
this model tends to be electrostatically stable in its environment (rather than being strongly driven towards the baths,
like the paddle considered before). The energy trough is
quite shallow however, so additional stabilizing features are
required to ensure long-term stability.
The bottom of the energy trough is nearly flat, allowing the helical screw to visit a wide range of positions with
nearly uniform probability. When a strong positive or negative voltage is applied to the membrane, the energy trough
is shortened to a deep pit at either end of the S4 range of
screw motion (Figs. 3.3 b & c). Panel (d) shows the expected
electrostatic potential energy for each translational position
(a statistical average over the rotational degree of freedom
based on the rotational partition function, see Statistical
mechanics, subsec. 2.2.7). There are no significant energy barriers to translation. The applied membrane voltage simply
tilts the flat bottom of the energy trough. Altogether, the

Figure 3.3: A sliding helix configuration has electrostatics suited for a VS. Panels (a-c): false-color maps of electrostatic potential energy
of the VS scanned over two degrees of freedom, for three applied voltages. The S4 helix has 6 positive charges, the three counter-charges
are spaced at the 2/3 interval, and the protein dielectric coefficient is 4. The electrostatic potential energy map for 0 mV applied voltage
forms a trough favorable to combined translational/rotational (‘screw’) motion of the S4 helix. Applied voltages of -100 or +100 mV convert
the energy trough into a pit at one end of the trough seen with 0 mV. Panel (d): Rotation-averaged electrostatic potential energy versus
translation for three applied voltages (averaging is based on the rotational partition function). Since electrostatic potential energy depends
on rotational position (panel a), allowing the S4 helix to rotate minimizes energy. The averaged energy forms a trough that tends to restrict
translation at both ends but is almost flat over intermediate translations (thus allowing diffusive motion of the S4 helix). Applied voltage tilts
this profile (promoting drift/diffusion of the S4 helix). Note that panels (a-c) show the potential energy of the VS relative to translation 0 nm
and rotation 0◦ , while panel (d) shows the potential energy of the VS relative to translation 0 nm (expectation over the rotational degree of
freedom).

the center to the periphery). High pressures occur where charges face water and in locations at the bottom of the gating pore (stabilizing
the gating pore near buried counter-charges). The same model parameters are used as in Fig. 3.3. The position in the membrane of the S4
segment is controlled by the applied membrane voltage (0 or +100 mV), and the Maxwell stress shown is the expectation of the Maxwell

Figure 3.5: The action of voltage on a sliding helix VS: Expectations of translation (a), rotation (b) and displaced gating charge (c) in
response to varied applied voltage. The expectations of these random variables are computed using the electrostatic partition function for the
two degrees of freedom. The same parameters for the sliding helix model are used as in Fig. 3.3. Voltage moves the mean position of the VS
in a screw-like trajectory and displaces gating charge of the proper magnitude with the proper slope (an experimental charge/voltage curve
(Seoh et al., 1996) for Shaker Kv channels is shown as the orange line in panel c).

tory of a screw motion. Varying the voltage gradually from
-100 mV to +100 mV drives the expected position of the VS
over the range suggested by the potential energy landscapes
in Fig. 3.3. The amount of gating charge displaced over
that range of motion (Fig. 3.5 c, blue line) exceeds 3 e0 per
VS, which is close to the total gating charge measured per
VS in Shaker K+ channels (orange line). Since a VS driving
coupled gating machinery might have a smaller range of motion, it is reasonable to expect a model of an uncoupled VS
to produce at least as much charge per VS as that observed
in channels.
Charge is displaced in the model over a voltage range symmetrical with respect to 0 mV of applied voltage, whereas
the experimental charge displacement is centered about a
negative voltage. The slopes of the two charge displacement curves are quite similar; the chief difference between
the model VS and the real VS is an offset between the
charge/voltage curves. The real VS is integrated into a channel and drives the activation gating of the channel. My
model voltage sensor is isolated and drives no load. If the
voltage offset between the two charge/voltage relations is
due to the gating work that the real voltage sensor does on
the rest of the channel, then: (1) the gating work is applied in
closing the channel, and (2) the counter-force exerted by the
gate onto the VS is approximately constant over the range
of VS travel (in contrast to an elastic counter-force).
The sliding helix model presented fulfills the criteria for a
viable VS model as listed above. Therefore in this study I will
use those model parameters as a basis of further exploration
of VS electrostatics.

Counter-charges

the

The gating pore reduces the length of the S4 segment exposed to the weak dielectric separating the two baths. The
sliding helix model studied in the previous section also includes three negative counter-charges in the region of weak
dielectric. Either feature is expected to reduce the energetic
cost of moving the S4 charges from the baths into the region
of weak dielectric. The role of the counter-charges can be
assessed by deleting them from the model. Fig. 3.6 shows
electrostatic potential energy of the VS versus translation
for the models with and without three counter-charges. Removing the counter-charges produces a large electrostatic
barrier, much like that computed for the paddle model described above (Fig. 3.1 d, note the distinct shape in the
mid-range, however).
The S4 charges of the sliding helix model induce a substantial charge on the bath interfaces. The induced charges
are negative, attracting the S4 charges toward the baths and
thereby destabilizing the buried S4 charges. With the buried
positive S4 charges neutralized by negative counter-charges,
the charges induced on the bath interfaces are greatly reduced, creating a trough of electrostatic potential energy.
These computations indicate that an appropriate number of
counter-charges are required if the sliding helix model is to
function as a VS. The gating pore alone does not lower the
induced-charge barrier to the extent needed for the sliding
helix models to function as a VS.
Another consequence of the deletion of all counter-charges
from the model is that all rotational positions now have
equal electrostatic potential energy. Thus the S4 segment
in the model no longer operates like a screw. If the delivery of torque is important for operating the gate of the real
channel, this would add another consequence to neutralizing
mutations of VS counter-charges.

Which model features are important for voltage-sensing by a
sliding helix?

3.3.2

Sliding helix models have many features that can be
parametrized and studied: counter-charge position & number, protein dielectric, gating pore size & shape and membrane thickness, for example. In this section I present three
features of interest that show sensitivity and a significant effect on VS function. In particular, the existence of countercharges, their spacing and the local dielectric through which
they interact with S4 charges are strong determinants of the
viability of a VS model.

Counter-charge spacing matters

The counter-charges of the described sliding helix models
are arranged following the spiral curve on which the S4
charges are positioned. The intervals of the S4 and countercharges, however, differed for the previously described model
(Counter-charges eliminate the induced-charge barrier, subsec. 3.3.1): there, the counter-charges were spaced at 2/3
the interval between S4 charges. This precludes simultaneous alignments of more than one S4 charge with a counter-

to applied voltage? How does the expected position of the
S4 region respond to voltage? Fig. 3.9 shows the expectation translation (a), rotation (b) and charge/voltage relation (c) based on the partition function over rotational and
translational degrees of freedom. The charge voltage relations vary in steepness and total displaced gating charge
even though the numbers of S4 charges and counter-charges
are fixed, as is the dielectric environment. These variations
of the charge/voltage curve must originate from the range of
travel produced by the applied voltage as well as the distribution of S4 positions among more or less discrete locations.
Predicting these variations requires numerical analysis of the
electrostatics.

charge (see Fig. 2.4). In order to see how much the closerange electrostatic interactions of charge and counter-charge
affect electrostatic potential energy of the VS, I have computed the consequences of counter-charge intervals of 1/2,
1/1, 4/3, and 3/2 times the interval of S4 charges. A later
section (Charge mutations, sec. 3.4) will present computations
of less regular charge spacings obtained by deleting charges
at certain positions of a periodic pattern.
Fig. 3.7 shows maps of electrostatic potential energy in
the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, for both
0 mV and +100 mV applied voltage. The potential energy of
the VS expected when rotation is free is plotted versus translation in Fig. 3.8 with 0 mV curves for different spacings
superimposed. The 1/2, 1/1, and 3/2 intervals yield energy
landscapes more hilly than those of the 2/3 or 4/3 intervals; the S4 segment of these models with counter-charges
spaced at 1/2, 1/1 or 3/2 intervals tend to dwell in more
discrete positions in energy valleys. When a strong voltage
of +100 mV is applied in these models, some of the energy
valleys persist as discrete features.

The expectation values for rotation and translation at
different voltages (Figs. 3.9 a & b) reveal a monotonic increase in translation as voltage is increased; however, nonmonotonic variations of rotation occur in some cases. Thus,
for the 3/2 counter-charge interval, the rotation is in the
opposite direction to that seen for other intervals. Translational motion (and ability to produce translational force)
is robust, while rotational motion (and ability to produce
torque) is sensitive to counter-charge alignment. Never-

± 1 nm, leading the S4 segment to dwell preferentially near
these two positions. With a dielectric coefficient of 16, however, there is no significant energy variation (at 0 mV) at
any position within the energy trough, so that no S4 position is preferred. Hence, the distribution of the S4 segment
in the translational degree of freedom varies from a virtual
‘two-state Boltzmann distribution’ to a distribution within a
space of uniform potential energy. The uniform-energy distribution of charge approaches hyperbolic rather than exponential asymptotic behavior at extreme voltages. The midpoint slopes of the charge/voltage curves can be analytically
determined; the midpoint slope of the charge/voltage curve
is three times greater for the two-state case than for the
uniform-energy case (Neumcke et al., 1978). In this man-

ers emerges. In particular, significant wells develop around
± 1 nm of translation.
The changes in potential energy landscape have interesting consequences for the relation between charge displacement and voltage (Fig. 3.12). Reduction of the protein dielectric coefficient increases the slope of the charge/voltage
relation. These simulations were all calculated with the same
dielectric geometry, protein charges and counter-charges in
the model. Nevertheless, the ‘effective gating charge’ of
the VS as assessed by the steepness at the midpoint of the
charge/voltage curve increases as the protein dielectric coefficient is reduced. The reason for this effect of the dielectric
coefficient is evident in Fig. 3.11. With a dielectric coefficient of 2, there are two crisp energy minima at translations

Figure 3.8: Counter-charge alignment with S4 charges creates electrostatic barriers and wells. Electrostatic potential energy of the VS
versus translation, averaged over rotation and relative to translation 0 nm. The spacing of counter-charges is varied. The protein dielectric
coefficient is 4. The spacings of 1/2, 1/1, and 3/2 allow two counter-charges to align with corresponding S4 charges in certain positions,
thereby generating ripples of electrostatic potential energy (panel a). The spacings that allow only one counter-charge to align at a time with
an S4 charge produce smoother profiles of energy (panel b).

tive residues or one of three negative charges on the S2 and S3
transmembrane segments were neutralized. In addition, two
double mutants were investigated. These mutations produce
a complex pattern of change in the charge/voltage curves,
including reductions of total gating charge, shift, and alteration of slope and shape. Predicting such patterns is a
challenge for a physical model.
For these comparisons, I use 3 counter-charges set at a
2/3 interval to test whether the apparent VS-like behavior
of that model as investigated above responds like a biological VS to physiological extremes. The positions of these
counter-charges in the biological VS is ambiguous. Unlike S4
charges which are regularly arrayed on a single transmembrane domain that is α-helical in nature, counter-charges are
irregularly placed on multiple helices connected by amorphous linking regions and arranged at various orientations

ner, the same structural charges produce up to a three-fold
varying effective gating charge as the protein dielectric coefficient (and therefore the potential energy landscape) is varied. The force that can be delivered by S4 charge movement
is therefore constrained by the local dielectric coefficient.

Figure 3.9: Counter-charge spacing is important for VS response to voltage: Expectation values of translation (a), rotation (b) and
displaced gating charge (c) in response to varied applied voltage. The expectations for these random variables are computed using the
electrostatic partition functions for the two degrees of freedom. The same sliding helix models are used as in Figs. 3.7 & 3.8. Counter-charge
spacing controls the extent of S4 charge motion, direction of rotation, as well as magnitude of gating charge and shape of the charge/voltage
relation. (Note that 1/2 interval in blue falls closely on top of 2/3 interval in orange).

+100 mV, p is varied over 2, 8 & 16 in panels (d-f). The potential energy of each VS configuration
relative to translation 0 nm and rotation 0◦ is represented in false color; note the difference in scales.
At p = 2 the range between maxima and minima are ≈ 3 eV, while at p = 16 this difference is

Figure 3.12: Protein dielectric coefficient constrains the distribution of charge displacement. As p is varied over 2 (blue), 4 (orange),
8 (magenta) & 16 (cyan), the maximum slope of the charge displacement curve is reduced, while total charge displacement is not. The
charge displacement for p has been previously presented versus experimental results in Fig. 3.5 (c), blue curve. All curves were calculated

and relative positions to each other (Jiang et al., 2003; Long
et al., 2005, 2007; Tao et al., 2010), recalling that each of
these examples is crystallographic data from a small subset
of the full ensemble of conformations of the VS. Motions of
the S1–S3 regions of the VS are experimentally undetermined.
The charged residues of the VS have many points of rotation and extend relatively far from the α-helical backbones
to which they are attached (particularly arginine and glutamate residues, Creighton 1984); for example, in Long et al.
(2007, Fig. 4), four charge/counter-charge pairs are shown
in direct contact despite the S4 appearing to form an angle
(and therefore creating a gap) with the S1, S2 and S3 domains. Additionally, there exists ambiguity regarding which
charges are permanently situated in the intra- and extracellular solutions and which ones are within the gating pore
regions where the ratio of electrical travel to geometrical
travel is larger (Nonner et al., 2004, Fig. 2).
However, it is known that three or four counter-charges
on the S2 and S3 transmembrane domains are highly conserved depending on which Kv channels are included (Islas
and Sigworth, 1999; Jiang et al., 2003; Tao et al., 2010),
and that neutralization of three counter-charges have profound effects on VS behavior (Planells-Cases et al., 1995;
Papazian et al., 1995; Seoh et al., 1996). From the results
shown in Counter-charges eliminate the induced-charge barrier, subsec. 3.3.1, three counter-charges are sufficient to produce VS-like behavior, and fewer charges fail to stabilize the
sliding helix in the membrane (data not shown for single and
double counter-charge simulations).
The biologically possible configuration space is of high dimensionality, so as a test of the variety of conditions under
which the previously elucidated model can function I begin with a reduced model of counter-charge positions and
mutations. As described in Sliding helix model, subsec. 2.3.1,
charge and counter-charge mutants are modeled both as a
simple elimination of the point-charges associated with the
residues and by the point-charges’ replacement by a dipole
to represent the polarizability of glutamine and asparagine
residues. The envelope contained by the curves representing
these two extreme models of each mutation can be used to investigate the robustness of components of this model (charge
elimination is a maximally energetically unfavorable model,
whereas the chosen dipole representation is minimally energetically unfavorable).
I have calculated the behavior of models with corresponding charge deletions, testing to what extent the experimental charge/voltage curves are predicted. This requires as-

signing the S2 and S3 negative charges neutralized by Seoh
et al. (1996) to counter-charge positions in the sliding helix
models. The residues E283, D316, and E293 are assigned
to the outermost, central, and innermost counter-charge respectively. The counter-charges are spaced at the 2/3 interval, and the protein dielectric coefficient is set to 4. In
these models when one of the counter-charges is removed,
the trough of electrostatic potential energy that confines S4
charge motion (see Fig. 3.6) becomes inverted; therefore the
S4 segment is no longer stable in the weak dielectric. On
the other hand, mutants with one S2 or S3 negative residue
neutralized are functional, indicating that their S4 segments
are not dislocated. Therefore, I confine the S4 segment of
the models presented in this section within the translational
range of ± 1.5 nm. Charge/voltage curves are computed
using the partition function resulting from the electrostatic
potential energy of the VS sampled over the rotational and
translational degrees of freedom.
Figs. 3.13 through 3.21 summarize the results. Panel (b)
of each figure shows the experimental charge/voltage curves
for the wildtype channel (orange squares) and the mutant
(blue circles), as reported in Fig. 2 (A-J) of Seoh et al.
(1996). Panel (a) of each figure shows the corresponding curves computed for the model. The experimental
charge/voltage curves are vertically aligned so that their
midpoints correspond to zero displaced charge. There are no
horizontal alignments or normalizations except in Fig. 3.13
(Seoh et al., 1996 report in their Fig. 2 E a normalized
charge/voltage curve for mutant R362Q). All other curves
represent charge per VS.
In comparing the computed and experimental results, it is
useful to consider differences in the size of wildtype and mutant charges, shifts between wildtype and mutant voltage
dependencies, and slope and shape changes between wildtype and mutant. My computations apply to an isolated
VS, while the experiments were done on channels; therefore,
the ‘idle’ VS is being compared to the naturally gate-coupled
VS. To the extent that the coupling to the gate restricts S4
charge motion and requires work to be done by the VS, it is
expected that the gating charge of the model VS is greater
than that of the channel VS, and that the charge/voltage
curves are shifted with respect to one another. Because VS
model and channel charge/voltage curves are expected to
be shifted with respect to one another, it is useful to focus
on the differences between mutant and wildtype curves. To
what extent does the model account for the mutation-versuswildtype changes?

38

3.4.1

Mutation of a positive charge

curves of the mutants are shifted to negative voltages; the
activation curves are also strongly altered (with a left shift in
the case of K374Q+D316N ). The VS of these mutant channels appears to have difficulty in moving into fully-closed positions. The predicted curves reveal limitations of the model.
A double mutant lacking two VS charges is expected to be
particularly sensitive to the geometry assigned to charges
due to the positions and orientations of potential gaps between charges and counter-charges, apart from the already
mentioned distinction regarding gating load.

Model and experimental results of successively mutating one
S4 charge are shown in Figs. 3.13 through 3.16, starting
with the outermost arginine residue. In real Shaker channels, these mutations produce substantial changes to the
charge/voltage relation including reduction of total charge,
changes of slope, deformations of the charge/voltage relation and shifts along the voltage axis. The experimental
pattern of change varies from mutation to mutation. The
predictions from the model reflect the varying experimental
patterns very well. Only one qualitative difference is seen:
the model does not predict the shift toward negative voltages
seen in the R368N mutant (Fig. 3.15).

3.4.2

3.4.4

The double mutations of K374Q + E293Q and K374Q +
D316N by Seoh et al. (1996) were partially motivated by the
lack of functional expression by K374Q mutants. Since ionic
conductance was blocked at all potentials, charge displacement per channel could not be estimated. One could speculate as to the cause of this — whether the VS proper was
non-functioning or whether some folding pathology blocked
proper expression. Experimentally, there is limited accessibility for non-expressive behavior; however, computational
exploration is still possible. In Fig. 3.22, a computational
analog of K374Q is tested: (1) charge displacement is greatly
reduced in panel (a), with some increase extending towards
large positive potentials; (2) S4 position is constrained to the
intracellular, closed positions in panel (b); and (3) no path
for fully moving to the open position is apparent from the
potential energy landscapes in panels (c) & (d). The failure of K374Q to function biologically is consistent with the
predicted electrostatic limitations of K374Q as a VS.

Mutation of a negative charge

The results of neutralizing one of a group of putative
counter-charges, two glutamate residues of S2 and an aspartate residue of S3, are shown in Figs. 3.17 through 3.19.
In the model, these mutations are mimicked by deleting the
outermost (E283), central (D316), and innermost (E293)
counter-charge. Since these assignments are tentative, testing the model against experiments also tests for the adequacy of the guessed counter-charge to residue assignments.
The comparisons of predicted and experimental mutant
effects are, again, surprisingly good. The varying directions
and degrees of shift along the voltage axis are predicted quite
well. Because the model assigns the first and third in the
group of counter-charges to the residues E283 & E293 and
because of the symmetry in the model’s charge configuration, the simulations predict that the Q/V curves for E283Q
and E293Q should reflect such symmetry, but in fact the experimental curves are not symmetric. In particular E293Q
has a substantially smaller total gating charge than E283Q.
Thus the VS of the channel has an asymmetry in its structure or operates under asymmetrical constraints that are
not included in these VS models. E283Q and D316N reveal activation curves (not shown) of the ionic current that
are strongly shifted to positive voltages. The charge/voltage
curves reported by Seoh et al. (1996) do not extend over this
voltage range, so they can not reveal the full gating charge.

3.4.3

Investigation of a mutant lacking
functional expression

3.4.5

Summary of mutation simulations

These model studies of charge mutants show that the quality of the model predictions varies in a pattern. S4 charge
mutants are described well, S2 and S3 (counter-charge) mutants less well, and double mutants least well. S4 charges
likely form a regular array of charges because of the S4’s
helical structure. Thus the model assumption of uniform
spacing of the S4 charges is probably sound. The arrangement of putative counter-charges provided by the S2 and S3
segments has a much larger range of uncertainty, of which I
have explored only a small subrange — more exploration is
needed.

Combined mutations of a positive and
a negative charge

Figure 3.13: Effective gating charge is reduced by mutating the outermost arginine. The slope of the QV
relation, the effective gating charge, is reduced relative to the wildtype for both the computed and experimental
results. Note that Seoh et al. (1996, Fig. 2 E) report for this case normalized charge displacement, so total
gating charge is not comparable with wildtype results. Dipole and deletion representations are similar.

Figure 3.17: Mutation of the outermost counter-charge produces a right shift with no gating charge
reduction. Experimental results also show a right shift for the open probability (data not shown). Both
representations of the mutation are right-shifted and have similar slopes, but the magnitude of the right-shift is

Figure 3.18: Mutation of the middle counter-charge has a mild effect. Experimental results show a small
reduction in gating charge & slope, while computational results predict a slight increase for both due to the
exclusion of S4 from central positions. Dipole and deletion representations are similar.

symmetrical with 3.17 (a), while experimental results show a large reduction in gating charge which is not
apparent in E283Q. Experimental results also show a left shift for open probability, as opposed to to the right
shift for E283Q (data not shown). Both representations of the mutation are left-shifted and have similar slopes,

Figure 3.21: Mutating the outermost lysine & the innermost counter-charge produces a reduction in total
gating current. The computational results for deletion, however, predict a reduction in slope that is replaced by
a larger reduction in total gating charge in the experimental results. K374Q + E293Q also shows a left shift in
open probability (data not shown). The dipole representation fails to predict the left shift of the experimental
results reproduced by the deletion representation; however, the dipole representation reproduces the higher slope
of the experimental mutant.

Figure 3.22: The non-functional K374Q mutant is electrostatically incompetent. Charge displacement in
panel (a) is marginal, only reaching 0 e0 at highly positive potentials. The associated translation in panel (b)
tracks the gating charge, never moving past the central position until the internal relative electrode potentials
approaches +100 mV. In panels (c & d), a large energy barrier at 1 nm is apparent even at +100 mV. Panels (c)
and (d) were produced with the deletion representation. Both mutant representations show similar results.

Perspectives
I have developed a computational approach for studying the
electrostatics of the voltage sensor (VS) controlling conduction in voltage-dependent ion channels. The VS is described
in a microscopic physical model that is reduced in detail to
those features whose relevance for VS function is to be investigated. The microscopic model is complemented by a simulation system that establishes voltage-clamp conditions and
records gating charge movements in a manner analogous to
and comparable with a macroscopic experimental setup. Using efficient computational methods that allow a statisticalmechanical analysis of VS behavior, characteristics that are
experimentally accessible (such as the charge/voltage relation) are computed for different models of the VS. My approach thus substantially extends the computational means
for studying structure-function relationships of the VS system
while making comparisons with experimental results. The
presented results provide the following perspectives on the
VS.
How do charged residues ‘contribute’ to gating
charge?
Published experiments have sought answers to
this question by neutralizing a formally charged residue of
the VS and measuring the slope of voltage dependence of activation (Stühmer et al., 1989) or recording ensemble gating
charge while counting channels with an independent method
such as noise analysis of ionic current (Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996; Seoh et al., 1996; Baker et al., 1998; Ledwell
and Aldrich, 1999). The results of the latter are expressed as
the change (typically reduction) in gating charge per channel.
My computational studies show how charge neutralization can
modify gating charge in a manner amenable to several modes
of analysis: (1) the S4 charge motion carries less charge as
a direct consequence of removing one of its charges — the

simplest mode; (2) the range of S4 charge motion becomes
electrostatically restricted, leading all S4 charges to travel a
shorter distance, as they are part of a solid body; and (3) the
electrostatic potential energy landscape for S4 travel is altered
in such a manner that the probability distribution of positions
is altered, with consequences for the shape of Q/V relationships. Modes (2) and (3) may apply regardless of whether the
neutralized residue is mobile or fixed in position. Under the
latter conditions, the total gating charge can be reduced by an
amount greater than the neutralized charge since the motion
of all charges is modified by altering one charge.
Counter-charges to the positively charged S4 residues
are essential. Much discussion of how the S4 helix with
its array of positively charged residues might be stabilized
in the membrane has focused on the polarizability of the S4
matrix and its environment. The primary requirements for
allowing the S4 charges to act as a VS are the proper number
and positions of counter-charges. The importance of negatively charged residues for VS function is well established; the
respective residues of the S2 and S3 segments are highly conserved (Islas and Sigworth, 1999; Tao et al., 2010), and neutralization mutants show strong alterations of function (Seoh
et al., 1996).
Computationally, I find that a viable VS model includes
counter-charges. Removing counter-charges from the model
creates a landscape of electrostatic potential energy that tends
to exclude the S4 charged region from the membrane region
— a large barrier develops from charge induced on the bath
interface by buried, unbalanced S4 charges. This happens
in the presence of deep gating pores that reduce the number of buried S4 charges to no more than three. My computations show that much of the observed consequences of

neutralization mutants on S2, S3, and S4 can be understood
on electrostatic grounds as resulting from the charge/countercharge interactions among the buried residues and the charges
that they induce on dielectric boundaries. The computational results for a reduced electrostatic model suggest that
the charge/counter-charge interactions in the VS warrant detailed investigation.

trostatic interactions can thus provide essential insights into
experimental behavior.
My simulations assemble a handful of positive and negative charges, enclose them in a reflective dielectric boundary,
reshuffle their configurations with an external field and provide an experimental window for viewing. The result is a
kaleidoscope. A “simple” electrostatic system produces complex phenomena which appear to be more easily understood
Electrostatics dominate. The fact that a model solely by constructing the mechanism of the kaleidoscope than by
