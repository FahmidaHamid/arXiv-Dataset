Abstract. We study a model of self propelled particles exhibiting run-and-tumble
dynamics on lattice. This non-Brownian diffusion is characterised by a random walk
with a finite persistence length between changes of direction, and is inspired by the
motion of bacteria such as E. coli. By defining a class of models with multiple
species of particle and transmutation between species we can recreate such dynamics.
These models admit exact analytical results whilst also forming a counterpart to
previous continuum models of run-and-tumble dynamics. We solve the externally
driven non-interacting and zero-range versions of the model exactly and utilise a field
theoretic approach to derive the continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics for more general
interactions. We make contact with prior approaches to run-and-tumble dynamics off
lattice and determine the steady state and linear stability for a class of crowding
interactions, where the jump rate decreases as density increases. In addition to its
interest from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this lattice model
constitutes and efficient tool to simulate a class of interacting run-and-tumble models
relevant to bacterial motion, so long as certain conditions (that we derive) are met.

1. Introduction
The last decade has seen a growing number of studies of biological systems conducted
by physicists. Much of this work relies on tools not traditionally found in biology. For
instance, recent methods of nonlinear optics have made possible observation of biological
systems on much smaller scales than was previously possible [1]. In other cases biological
systems have helped shed light on questions of fundamental importance in theoretical
physics. Studies of bird flocks showed that it may be possible to observe long range order
in systems with a continuous symmetry if detailed balance is broken [2] (in equilibrium
this is forbidden by the Mermin-Wagner theorem [3]).
Bacteria provide one example of a biological system which is of great interest to
the study of nonequilibrium physics. Some species of bacteria, such as Escherichia coli,
swim by means of a series of relatively straight runs interspersed with short periods of
chaotic motion, known as tumbles, during which their orientation changes at random and
they experience little net displacement [4]. This can be seen as a type of non-Brownian
diffusion where the steady state probability distribution will not be Boltzmann.
Following experiments to determine their behaviour by Berg and others [5–11]
since the 1970s, much is known about the dynamics and behaviour of individual
bacteria. Less, however, is known about their collective behaviour and it is here
that statistical mechanics can play a useful role. Schnitzer et al. analysed various
strategies bacteria may employ, e.g. changing their speed or tumble rate, and studied
the differences these make to the steady state distribution [12]. These analyses, which
were based on off-lattice descriptions of the particle dynamics, were more recently
extended to allow for various types of interaction between bacteria [13], external
force fields [14], hydrodynamic interactions [15], and coupling to logistic population
growth [16]. Intriguingly it was shown that a dependence of motility parameters such
as swim-speed on density was alone enough to cause phase separation [13], in contrast
to detailed-balance systems where many-body effects on particle mobility cancel exactly
in Boltzmann steady states.
In this work we construct a lattice model whose non-interacting continuum limit
recovers the off lattice equations previously derived for noninteracting run-and-tumble
particles [12, 14]. We will also address interactions in the form of density dependent
motility parameters, and thereby connect also with the off lattice approach of [13].
One motivation for this approach is as follows. Although real bacterial systems are
off lattice, both the microscopic run-and-tumble equations, and the diffusive continuum
equations found by coarse graining these, are difficult to simulate efficiently, particularly
once interactions are included. On lattice the local density of particles is easy to
determine and so density-dependent interactions are easy to include at relatively low
cost computationally. Lattice simulations are also easier to extend to higher dimensions
as we will consider towards the end of this paper. For all these reasons, creation of
a robust and accurate lattice representation of bacterial motility is a worthwhile goal,
even from a purely phenomenological standpoint, whereby the purpose of a model is to

Lattice Models of Nonequilibrium Bacterial Dynamics

provide a fairly direct explanation for results seen in experiment.
A second motivation is more fundamental. Models of non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics can be broadly split into two categories: one phenomenological as just
described, the other comprising simple models which allow the study of basic concepts
and facilitate a more detailed understanding of the nature of non-equilibrium physics. In
the latter category we can think of lattice transport models such as the exclusion [17] or
zero-range [18] processes, for which some exact analytical results can be found, as well as
methods to characterise fluctuations and large deviations in non-equilibrium states [19].
Our model falls squarely into this category of simple theoretical models, and indeed
extends some of these examples; we investigate both a zero-range process and a partially
excluding version of our run-and-tumble system. As a microscopic lattice model we can,
under certain conditions, calculate exact steady states and understand precisely how
changes in the underlying dynamics affect the probability distributions. More generally
we can always write an exact master equation for probability of a configuration and
utilise a variety of field theoretic representations to derive the large scale fluctuating
hydrodynamics, to attempt to map the system to a free energy and to determine the
steady state behaviour and dynamic stability.
As already explained, in addition to being an interesting toy model that we can
use to understand driven non-equilibrium physics, our model also forms a direct lattice
counterpart to some well established phenomenological continuum models of bacterial
dynamics. It is unusual for a model to allow exact computations while credibly
describing the real behaviour of a physical system, and this is one of the reasons why
we consider this model to be of interest.
In section 2 we introduce our model of run-and-tumble bacteria on a lattice.
In section 3 we consider those cases in which we can find exact solutions to the
steady state behaviour. After first examining in section 3.1 the non-interacting case,
which for inhomogeneous and anisotropic jump and tumble rates can still admit nontrivial solutions, in section 3.2 we include a zero-range interaction and derive sufficient
conditions on the rates for a factorised steady state to exist.
In section 4 we consider more general interactions, where the jump rates can
depend on the full configuration of the system, and derive a continuum fluctuating
hydrodynamics using a field theoretic approach. We first set up the theoretical apparatus
and re-derive the results for non-interacting systems within this framework; we then
calculate the field equations for the more generic interacting system. In section 5 we
consider one specific type of interaction and investigate the effect of crowding. We derive
a free-energy-like functional from which we can determine the steady state probability
distribution and compare the effects of different methods to coarse grain the local density
in the interaction terms. Finally we extend our results to higher dimensions more
applicable to real systems in section 5.3.

2. The Model
To model the finite persistence length in run-and-tumble dynamics on lattice particles
jump repeatedly in the same direction, u, with rate d(u) and change direction - tumble with rate α(u). In 1d, this means particles can be either right-going or left-going. Right+
going particles jump with rate d+
i from site i to site i+1 and tumble with rate αi . After
a tumble, they become left-going particles with probability 1/2. The corresponding rates
−
for left-going particles are called d−
i and αi , see figure 1. Throughout this paper we
assume tumbles to be instantaneous. In reality the duration of tumbles is typically of
the order of one tenth of the duration of runs [4]. There may be situations, however,
where time spent tumbling may increase, and where the finite duration of a tumble may
have an effect on the dynamics and steady state of the system. We leave a consideration
of this case to future work.
3. Exactly Solvable Cases
The jump and tumble rates defined in section 2 may, in general, depend on the
occupation numbers of any lattices sites. Through this we may introduce interactions
to our system and consider the general case of N interacting bacteria. Before we deal
with such complex cases in section 4, however, let us look at the interesting limiting
cases that allow for exact computation of the steady state. In particular we start by
considering first the non-interacting case and investigating the effect of position and
direction dependence on the rates in section 3.1, before then turning to zero-range
processes in section 3.2.
3.1. Non-Interacting Particles
For non-interacting particles, one can always handle the single particle case first and
compute the average occupancy ρ±
i of left (−) or right (+) moving particles on site i.
As shown below, the steady-state distribution of n particles is then given by a product
on each site of a multinomial distribution of parameters ρ±
i .
Let us start with the single particle process and call P (k, +) and P (k, −) the
probability to find a bacterium at site k going to the right and to the left, respectively.

3.1.1. Exact Solution of the Steady State For the case of non-interacting particles,
where all interesting and non-trivial effects come from heterogeneities or anisotropies in
the jump and tumble rates, we can calculate the steady state probability distributions
exactly. We start from the continuity equation
.t[P (i, +) + P (i, −)] = Ji−1,i − Ji,i+1 ,

(3)

where Ji,i+1 is the net probability flux between sites i and i + 1, that is
−
Ji,i+1 = d+
i P (i, +) − di+1 P (i + 1, −).

(4)

As we are only after the steady state distribution we take the time derivative on the
left hand side of equation (3) to be zero, so all currents Ji,i+1 are constant and equal to
some J fixed by the boundary conditions.
The master equation for the density of left-moving particles at site i reads

Using (4) to eliminate the first term on the right hand side of equation (5), which is the
only term to depend on site i + 1, we can establish a relationship between the number
of left and right moving particles on site i at steady state:

The probability to find a particle at any position and in either state can then
be calculated by noting that the total distribution must be normalised, i.e.
P
i [P (i, +) + P (i, −)] = 1 and that J is imposed by the boundary conditions. For

example, closed boundaries require that J = 0, while for periodic boundaries we have
the additional constraint that P (L+1, ±) = P (1, ±). Note that the probability densities
for left and right moving particles do not have to be the same, and, in general, will not
be.

3.1.2. Continuous limit Since we ultimately want to compare the run-and-tumble on
lattice with its off lattice counterpart, let us first take the continuum limit of the master
equation. Explicitly introducing the lattice spacing a and defining xk = ka, the master
equation (2) reads

(13)

We are interested in cases where the typical run length is much longer that the lattice
spacing so that d±  α± . Furthermore, when a → 0 while v ± (x) = d± (x)a remains
finite, one gets, at leading order,

with α = (α+ + α− )/2, v = (v + + v − )/2. It was shown that (15) captures the steady
state of the off lattice model exactly [13] and in section 4 we will show that it also
describes the large scale behaviour of run-and-tumble bacteria on lattice. The condition
for (15) to derive from an effective free energy is that there exists an excess free energy

as long as, for periodic boundary conditions, 0 dx(α− v + − α+ v − ) = 0. The total free
energy is then given by
Z
F[ρ] = dxρ(log ρ − 1) + Fex [ρ].
(19)
Note that it is not always possible to write a free energy of this form for non-interacting
particles in higher dimensions, nor, in general, for interacting systems. As we can see,
there is no gradient term in this expression. This is due to the fact that when deriving
the continuum limit, terms of order a and higher are neglected. If equation (15) leads
to large gradients in the density, these higher order terms should be included and may
alter the result; these terms control the surface tension, for example. These higher order
terms could also violate the condition (17).
We will now illustrate the steady state predictions of equations (8) (9) and (19) for
a few simple cases and show the difference between the results predicted by the lattice
model and by the continuum approximation.
3.1.3. Examples Where not stated otherwise the simulations we present here use
reflecting boundary conditions; if a particle tries to jump off one end of the lattice
it is, instead, kept where it is but turned around. All simulations are performed with
continuous-time Monte Carlo algorithms.
Position Dependent Rates with Closed Boundaries First, we consider the case of a
position dependent, but isotropic, jump rate and a constant tumbling rate. As a simple
example we use a top-hat function for jump rate such that d±
i = 1+10 θ(i−150) θ(350−i),
where θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. Both the continuum and lattice theory predict
that the average occupancy should be inversely proportional to the velocity,

The results of the simulations and both predictions are shown in figure 2 (main).
In contrast to the jump rate, simply making the tumble rate depend on position
but maintaining isotropy has no effect on the predicted distribution. Note that the free
energy in equations (18) and (19) has no dependency on α for isotopic rates. Using

at t = 5000.

the same form as for the position dependent jump rate in our simulations this can be
verified numerically, see figure 2 (inset).
Direction Dependent Rates with Closed Boundaries In many physical situations,
however, bacteria do not move unbiasedly but are affected by their external conditions.
This may be due, for example, to sedimentation due to gravity, where there is an
asymmetry in jump rates between left and right (or up and down) moving particles.
Another case of interest may be anisotropic tumble rates. Bacteria undergoing
chemotaxis often vary their tumble rate dependent on whether they are travelling up or
down a chemical gradient. Though a simple asymmetry in tumble rate does not fully
capture this behaviour, we do see particles preferentially move in the direction of a lower
tumble rate, as would be expected.
These two cases show qualitatively the same behaviour, with an exponential decay
in the unfavoured direction. From equations (8) and (9), the probabilities for left or
right going particles on lattice are

For expositional simplicity we consider homogeneous rates here. To examine the

We can see then that the two decay lengths will be equal if the jump rate is much larger

Note that in equations (23) and (24) one constant multiplies lattice position, i, and

d0 /α0 → ∞, unless  = 1, in which case both decay constants diverge.
Periodic Boundary Conditions We can also calculate the expected probability
distribution for periodic boundary conditions. In this case our calculation on lattice
is slightly more complicated as we do not know the current a priori, but must determine
P
it through the conditions P (L + 1, ±) = P (1, ±) and i [P (i, +) + P (i, −)] = 1.
We can write P (i, +) = C1 (i)[P (1, +) − J C2 (i)], where C1 (i) and C2 (i) can be read
from equation (8). Then from the periodicity of the system we can write the current as

We omit the exact forms for the probability distributions as these do not reduce to a

3.2. A Zero-Range Interaction
Though there is no generic solution for the steady state of interacting run-and-tumble
particles, there are limiting cases that can be solved exactly, most simply a zero range
interaction. We define the number of left and right going particles on a site as,
+
+
−
respectively, n−
i and ni . The total occupancy of a site is then ni = ni + ni . The
simplest interaction we can add is a zero-range interaction, where the rate for a particle

to jump from site i with occupancy (n+
i , ni ) to site i ± 1 is defined as di (ni , ni ) and
is a function of the number of particles at the departure site but not dependent on
the number of particles at the arrival site. With this addition we can now see more
complex behaviour and non-trivial steady states, even for homogeneous and isotropic
jump and tumble rates, but can still, under certain conditions presented below, calculate
the stationary probability distribution exactly.
As is standard for zero-range processes (ZRPs) [18], we begin by assuming there
exists a factorised form for the steady state probability distribution of the form

Then, for periodic boundary conditions, one way we may choose to solve this equation
is to separately balance the fluxes for right moving particles entering and exiting each
site, left moving particles entering and exiting each site and particles tumbling between
species on each site. We then arrive at three sufficient conditions on the allowed rates
for such a factorised form to exist:

in which c and c0 are arbitrary constants. The first two of these conditions are the same
as Evans and Hanney found for their two species model without transmutation [18, 20],
while the third is due to balancing the tumbling. Note that, in principle, there may be
other ways in which we can balance these terms which could arrive at different conditions
on the rates.
Putting the three conditions (31)-(33) together and eliminating the factors

gi (n , n− ) yields two constraints on our choice of rates:

− log(gi (n+

chose to solve the master equation does not lead to factorised steady states for which
the distribution can depend on the tumbling rates. As we saw that asymmetric tumble
rates could affect the equilibrium distribution for the non-interacting case, we might
suppose there are other solutions for the zero-range process which admit distributions
dependent on the tumble rates. Whether or not these allow for factorised steady states
remains to be determined.
To foreshadow the finite range interaction we will examine in section 4, and to
mimic the situation where an increase in density decreases the particles motility (as, for
example, they get in each other’s way) we now consider the following particular form of
the steady state for this two-species ZRP for jump rates

n+ + n− = nm − 1. In this case the effective free energy is double welled and the system
separates into isolated sites of high and low density. The relative numbers of high and
low density sites to which the system first separates are initial condition dependent. The
system then relaxes via a series of evaporations and condensations towards a fixed steady
state. This is reminiscent of what happens for single-species zero-range processes with
similar jump rates. Where the jump rates remain finite even for very large occupancies
the normal condensation is arrested [21]. The free energy is shown in figure 5 along with
a typical snapshot of the system.
To this behaviour we can then add a drift term to simulate sedimentation by biasing
the jump rates in one direction and applying closed boundary conditions. We see all
the high density sites collect at one end of the lattice and the low density sites at the
other, see figure 6.
4. Fluctuating Hydrodynamics for Interacting Bacteria
We now turn to the more general case of N interacting bacteria with interactions that
are not limited to being on-site. Specifically, we allow the jump and tumble rates to
depend on the occupation numbers of each lattice site so that

In general the coarse graining kernel Ki−j
could also be a function of lattice position
though here we do not consider that situation, where the manner in which the density
is felt by the particles varies with position. We aim at describing large scale behaviour,
i.e. on a colony size, and so to derive a fluctuating hydrodynamics. In addition, this will
allow us to compare again the phenomenology on and off lattice and to look for cases in
which there is a “free-energy” like description, and for which we can thus characterise

the steady state. We follow a field theoretic approach to derive a continuum Langevin
equation for the system, from which we can deduce the appropriate Fokker-Planck
equation and the steady-state distribution.
4.1. Field Theory for Non-interacting Particles
To illustrate the technique we shall use to construct the fluctuating hydrodynamics
for the full interacting case, let us first handle the non-interacting case and re-derive
equation (15).
Field theoretic representations of lattice gases using bosonic coherent states were
established in the 1970s following Doi and Peliti [22, 23]. The case where each site
is limited to a single particle can be handled in some cases in this formalism [24],
while more general finite occupancies could be handled using spin coherent states [25].
Alternatively, probabilistic approaches from mathematical physics have also been
used [26–28]. Here we use an alternative derivation, based on an approach à la Jansen
and De Dominicis [29,30] transposed in the context of the master equation. This is very
similar to the generating function approach used by Biroli and Lefevre [31]. Beginning
with a process discrete in both time and space one writes the probability of a trajectory
as

isotropic systems and validates the results obtained previously, see equation (15).

4.1.1. Fluctuating Hydrodynamics and Large Deviation Functions Before going any
further, let us make a brief detour to consider the connection with the standard
fluctuating hydrodynamics approach considered in the mathematics literature [32]. Let
us first note that from the definition of the continuum limit, one has
Z 1
X
dxρ(x)
(61)
N=
ρi =

i

The integral of the density field is thus an extensive variable. On the other hand, the
density field considered by mathematicians is often defined by
1X
ρi δ(x − ai)
(62)
ρ(x) =
` i
and satisfies the normalisation condition
Z
N
(63)
dxρ(x) =
`
To make the connection between the two approaches, it is thus natural to rescale our
density term to make the extensivity apparent:ρ → `ρ. To ensure that the conservation
equation still has the form ρ̇ = −∇J, one must also rescale the current field J → `J.
Before introducing the η(x, t) field, the action thus reads

Interestingly, the fields are now all intensive, and the smallness of the noise does not
√
come from a ρ versus ρ noise prefactor, but from its explicit variance, read in the
Gaussian weight:
1
(66)
hη(x, t)η(x0 , t0 )i = δ(x − x0 )δ(t − t0 ).
`
This is the usual fluctuating hydrodynamics, as considered, for instance, in [32]. In the
large size limit, the first order correction to the deterministic equation in a 1/` expansion
√
√
is given by the addition of the noise term 2Dρ. This noise is typically of order 1/ `,
i.e. trajectories of probability of order 1 have `η 2 of order 1. Large deviations correspond
to trajectories where the noise can be of order one. They yield probabilities of order
O(exp(−`)), and are described by the fluctuating hydrodynamics constructed here.
4.2. Interacting Particles
Consider now the case of interacting particles where the jump and tumble rates depend
on the occupation numbers of each lattice site. Our velocity is then modified to
v ± (x) → v ± (ρ̄± (x), x),

(67)

Lattice Models of Nonequilibrium Bacterial Dynamics

and the tumble rate to
α± (x) → α± (ρ̄± (x), x),
with ρ̄± (x) given by an integral over the density
Z
±
ρ̄ (x) = K ± (x − y)ρ(y)dy.

one gets for the action

term implies that, for the diffusive scaling to hold, at a scale `, the asymmetry
α+ (ρ̄+ )v − (ρ̄− ) − α− (ρ̄− )v + (ρ̄+ ) must be of order
√ 1/`. This is reminiscent of the ASEP,
where if the bias is much smaller than 1/ ` the diffusive scaling holds (EdwardsWilkinson universality class), as in the symmetric exclusion process, but for larger
asymmetries the dynamic exponent z is the same as Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling [33].

This formalism can now be used to analyse the effect of interactions on the large

5. Crowding Interactions
Having set up and utilised a field theory apparatus to derive a fluctuating hydrodynamics
for a general linear dependence on density in the jump rates, let us turn now to a specific
class of interactions. In particular we consider a crowding interaction, where the velocity
of the bacteria decreases with increasing density, in which case we expect to see our
system separate into regions of high and low density as particles become trapped in
regions of high density [13].
In general we expect to see qualitatively similar behaviour for any choice of v(ρ)
which decrease sufficiently quickly towards a finite non-zero velocity at high densities.
In the following we use
(
v0 (1 − (ρ̄± )/ρm )
if ρ̄± < ρm
v ± (ρ̄± ) =
,
(73)
v0 /ρm
if ρ̄± ≥ ρm
as we did for the exactly solvable zero-range process.

5.1. Zero-Range Interactions
This approach can describe many types of interaction, in particular let us now consider
the zero range interaction we met in section 3.2 in the context of the fluctuating
hydrodynamics we developed in section 4. This provides us with a benchmark to check
that our fluctuating hydrodynamics is consistent with the exact results we obtained
previously.
For the zero-range process, where the velocity depends only on the occupation at
the departure site, our kernel is given by Ki± = δi0 and in continuum ρ̄± (x) = ρ(x).
For simplicity, and to compare with our previous results we shall take α± (ρ̄) = α. This
simplifies equation (71) considerably and, indeed, guarantees that α+ v − − α− v + = 0.
From section 4.2 we know that the fluctuating hydrodynamics describing the run-andtumble bacteria with velocity given in equation (73) are given by

5.2. Finite Range Interactions
We saw in section 5.1 that our fluctuating hydrodynamics admit a free energy and
accurately reproduced the exact results for the zero-range process. Let us now extend
that analysis to a system with finite range interactions. As before we now take the
coarse grained density ρ̄± to be given by

ρ̄ (x) = K ± (x − y)ρ(y)dy.

(red) and 10 sites (blue) for the isotropic, Gaussian kernel. The black lines show
the predicted average high and low densities. Data recorded at t = 1000 using 5000
particles with nm = 50, k = 2 and α = 1.

For smooth profiles, we hope that the differences between ρ̄± and ρ are small so we can
treat the free energy in equation (77) as a mean field theory. This way we can still use the
free energy we derived in section 5.1 to predict the coexistence densities and instability
to spinodal decomposition. The finite range nature of the interactions will introduce
correlations between sites which we hope will manifest only via surface tension [13]. We
hope that this surface tension will only effect a clustering of the high and low density
sites without affecting the coexistence densities. If the mean field theory captures the
picture correctly, spinodal decomposition occurs whenever the second derivative of the
free energy density is negative, i.e. for

Thus, whenever ρm > ρ > ρm /2, the system should be unstable with respect to spinodal
decomposition.
5.2.1. Isotropic Kernels If we use an isotropic kernel to calculate ρ̄± in our jump rates
we do indeed recover results consistent with the zero-range free energy. That is, if we
take K + (x − y) = K − (x − y) our simulations match the free energy predictions. In
particular, we have worked with a Gaussian kernel, where K ± (x) = exp(−x2 /k)/Z,
with Z a normalisation and k a parameter to control the range of the interaction. The
results of simulations using this kernel are shown in figure 7 along with the predicted
average high and low densities from the free energy. To calculate the coexisting densities
of the high and low density sites we form a double tangent construction on the free
energy [35]. As predicted the finite range nature of the interactions effectively creates
a surface tension, but does not significantly alter the coexistence densities. Further, as
expected we see no dependence in the steady state on our choice of v0 and α.
5.2.2. Anisotropic Kernels For anisotropic coarse graining kernels, however, the
situation is more complex. One simple and natural way to introduce an anisotropic
kernel is to account for the finite volume of bacteria by stating that there can be at

In this case the effective free energy is limited to a region where ρ < ρm and this
section is sketched in figure 8. A double tangent construction amounts to looking for a
density ρlow such that the tangent of the free energy density at this point meets with the
free energy density at ρ = ρm , as can be seen from inspection of figure 8. This amounts
to finding ρ such that

For a total average density larger that ρlow , the stable phase should thus be a
combination of two phases, one with ρ = ρlow and one with ρ = ρm , the ratio of
the amounts of the two phases being set by constraint on the global mass.
Interestingly, although the theory correctly predicts a change from a flat profile
to phase separation, on examining the results of simulations of the underlying lattice
system we found that the densities into which the system separates do not correspond
to those predicted by the continuum theory. Indeed, while the continuum theory had no
dependence on the tumble rate α or the coefficient of the jump rate v0 , the simulations for
an anisotropic kernel showed a strong dependence on the ratio of these two parameters.
The lower and upper densities both varied considerably with the average run length
r ≡ v0 /α, as shown in figure 9, and below r = 4 we see no separation at all.
This discrepancy is not limited to the particular choice of anisotropic kernel we
use as illustration above and is general to any anisotropic choice of K ± (x). We have
also conducted simulations with smooth anisotropic kernels without a hard limit on the

number of particles per site, and saw exactly the same qualitative effect. Thus we have
seen that the relevant factor is indeed the isotropy of the kernel but although the origin
of the difference has been established, a comprehensive explanation for the variation
between isotropic and anisotropic kernels is yet to be formulated.
Note that it is not in itself surprising that a fluctuating hydrodynamics developed
to describe smooth profiles fails to quantitatively amount for the coexisting densities
of profiles alternating high and low densities. One of the reasons our fluctuating
hydrodynamics work so well for the isotropic case is that we always consider large
occupancies on each lattice site. This means that the model is close to mean-field in
the same sense as the large spin limit of a spin chain is well described by a continuous
spin chain [25]. Smaller occupancies would lead to quantitative differences between the
predicted coexisting densities and those predicted from the fluctuating hydrodynamics,
even for isotropic kernels. Furthermore, the Ito drift that was neglected in equation (75)
for symmetry reasons would not vanish for the anisotropic case. In fact even for the offlattice model, the fluctuating hydrodynamics developed previously [13] is only valid for
isotropic kernel and the quantitative mismatch between the fluctuating hydrodynamics
and the simulations on lattice for anisotropic kernels are thus not that surprising. We
nevertheless now try to shed some light on their origin.
5.2.3. Stability Analysis One way we can analyse the difference between the isotropic
and anisotropic interaction kernels is to examine the dynamic stability of the two
systems. We consider a one dimensional system evolving from a homogeneous state
under a small perturbation and determine whether the system is dynamically stable or
unstable, whether the perturbations will, on average, grow or shrink.
One possibility is that the discrepancies we saw in figure 9 between the theory
and simulations arise from the assumptions behind the diffusive limit taken in the field
theory, see section 4 and Appendix A. We therefore start from the continuum microscopic
mean field equations for homogeneous and isotropic rates, i.e. after the continuum limit

It is clear that one of these eigenvalues will always be negative while the other is negative
for ρ0 < ρm /2 and positive for ρ0 > ρm /2. Hence a homogeneously flat profile is stable
when the average total density is less than half the maximum density and unstable above
that, with no dependency on run length. This corresponds precisely with the stability
predicted by the free energy derived in section 5.2. That stability analysis was derived
from a free energy which considered only the total density and was itself calculated only
after assuming a diffusive scaling. That the diffusive scaling does not alter the criterion
for instability justifies taking that limit and implies that the discrepancy between our
lattice simulations and continuum free energy arises from another factor.
We turn, then, to consider the dynamic stability of the lattice dynamics directly.

Figure 10. A flat profile is stable when in region I, but unstable in region II, for a
system with exclusion and homogeneous, isotropic jump and tumble rates. The x-axis
is the fractional density, i.e. n/nm .

Graphing this we can see that a flat profile will be stable in region I of figure 10 and
unstable in region II. We see that for short run lengths the range of densities in which
the system will spinodally decompose is restricted and at run lengths below 4 sites there
is no separation at all. Conversely, in the limit that the run length tends to infinity,
i.e. where we effectively have two totally asymmetric partial exclusion processes on the
same lattice, the system is unstable for any density between nnm0 = 0.5 and nnm0 = 1. This
instability is in accordance with that seen in our simulations.
In our simulations we found that when we replaced the anisotropic kernel in the
interaction terms with an isotropic one we recovered the density profiles predicted by
the continuous theory. We can also analyse the effect of an isotropic density kernel on
the dynamic stability.

In general Kj± can take any values, we enforce only that they are both normalised, i.e.
P
that j Kj± = 1. Relaxing this constraint would effectively re-normalise the maximum
density. This more general interaction reduces to the simple exclusion case if we take
Kj± = δ±1,j and to the zero-range case if we take Kj± = δ0,j .
For an isotropic kernel, where Ki± = Ki , when we expand around a flat profile we
find that there exists a q such that λ+ (q) is greater than 0 if and only if nm > n0 > 0.5 nm ,
see Appendix B for details, which matches the condition we derived from our continuum
free energy. Thus for an isotropic interaction kernel we recover the continuum stability
result while an anisotropic kernel will, in general, not produce the same result. It
thus seems the error comes from the continuum limit itself, which is not valid for
anisotropic kernels. While the stability analysis accounts qualitatively for the difference
between isotropic and anisotropic kernels a theory which quantitatively accounts for the
differences in coexistence densities at steady state remains to be constructed.

than 0.6nm are marked in red, while those with a lower density are left blank. Left:
allowing only nearest neighbour hops and no diagonal movement. Right: allowing for
diagonal hops. Both simulations performed using 400, 000 particles and recorded at
t = 2500.

5.3. Finite Range Interactions in 2D
Most cases of physical interest require a model in more than one dimension; it is
therefore natural to extend our analysis to higher dimensions. This can be done on
lattice relatively easily. On a square lattice in two dimensions we allow the particles to
jump between nearest neighbours. We therefore consider 4 types of particle now instead
of 2. We find that in two dimensions, the behaviour of the run-and-tumble crowding
model is qualitatively the same as in one. The system separates into regions of high and
low density, where those co-existent densities are given by the same free energy as in
one dimension. The field theoretic approach developed in section 4 indeed generalizes
straightforwardly to higher dimensions and yields the same fluctuating hydrodynamics.
We find, however, that allowing only nearest neighbour hopping results in an unrealistic
surface tension because of the anistropy of the lattice [37, 38]; the regions of high and
low density form elongated, and thus anisotropic, domains, see figure 11 (left).
To correct this unphysical characteristic of our model we extend our dynamics
to allow next to nearest hopping along diagonal directions and consider 8 species of
√
particles, where the jump rates in the diagonal directions are scaled by a factor of 2.
The droplets then coarsen into more realistic curved domains, see figure 11 (right).
The stability conditions remain the same as do the coexistence densities and the
discrepancy between isotropic and anisotropic kernels. We examined simulations with
both the anisotropic partial exclusion kernel, and the isotropic, Gaussian kernel on
lattices of 500x500 sites for densities above the spinodal point. The systems were seen
to separate into droplets of higher and lower density which then coarsened into discrete,
contiguous domains, see figure 11.
We measured the coarsening of these domains and found them to scale as t1/3 ,
as we would expect for conserved model B type dynamics [39]. An approximate

measurement of the size of the domains was calculated by randomly sampling the system
and measuring the horizontal and vertical size of the encountered droplet at that point.
Mathematically, we define
Lx (i, j) = max {k ∈ N : |ni,j − ni+m,j | < n∗ , ∀m ∈ [0, k]}
+ max {k ∈ N : |ni,j − ni−m,j | < n∗ , ∀m ∈ [0, k]} ,

(95)

where n∗ is an arbitrary cutoff to distinguish the two domains but ignore random
fluctuations. Computations were run with a number of choices for n∗ and the particular
choice of cutoff was found to have no significant effect on the results. We calculate the
vertical size in an analogous fashion and average the lengths over a large number of
points on the lattice. Though this does not give an exact measure of the droplet size
it is sufficient to show the scaling of the domain size with time whilst being quick to
calculate numerically.
Using this procedure we determine that the domains increase in size with an
exponent of approximately 1/3, i.e. hLx i (t0 ) = (t0 /t)1/3 hLx i (t). The two-point,
connected, equal time correlation function C(j, t) = hni (t) ni+j (t)i − hni (t)i hni+j (t)i
was also calculated numerically from the data and fit reasonably with a re-scaling
C(x, t) = C(x/a1/3 , t a). The data for both these measurements can be seen in figure 12.
As can be seen from the figures the choice of kernel does not change the coarsening
exponent, only the relative speed of coarsening, with interactions over a larger number
of sites taking longer to reach a steady state than those with shorter ranges.
6. Conclusion
In this work we have presented several classes of lattice models based on the run-andtumble dynamics of certain species of bacteria, notably Escherichia coli. We calculated

Lattice Models of Nonequilibrium Bacterial Dynamics

27

the exact steady state probability distributions for both inhomogeneous, anisotropic,
non-interacting and zero-range interaction models. For more general types of interaction
we used a field theoretic approach to derive the continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics
and from there derived a mapping to a free energy like functional describing the steady
state profile for a crowding interaction. We analysed the linear stability of both the
continuum and lattice microscopic mean field equations and isolated a condition on the
coarse graining we employed in our interaction terms for the zero-range free energy to
work as a mean field theory.
Our work builds on earlier treatments of run-and-tumble bacteria where interactions
between bacteria were not included [12, 40]. It provides a lattice counterpart to prior
continuum approaches and qualitatively reproduces results obtained off lattice, where
a similar, though not exactly equivalent, density dependence was considered [13]. Our
approach on lattice provides a microscopic justification for manner in which this density
dependence manifests; previously it was added in an ad-hoc manner after the diffusive
approximation had been taken where in this work the dependence is intrinsic from the
microscopic definition of the dynamics. That we produce qualitatively similar results
justifies the way in which the dependence was inserted there. Our work also reveals
a condition on the way in which the coarse graining in this density dependence must
be performed for free energy mapping to work; it must be taken isotropically, so that
particles moving in any direction feel the same effective local density.
This work provides a means to simulate microscopic run-and-tumble dynamics
efficiently, which is particularly important in two or more dimensions where microscopic
simulations off lattice are very computationally expensive. It illustrates potential
hazards in comparing lattice simulations and continuum theoretical predictions and
offers some insight into how to avoid those problems by carefully choosing how to
implement non-local interactions in the lattice dynamics. Note that early studies of
off-lattice run-and-tumble dynamics actually had to discretise space to do simulation
for position dependent swimming speed in order to compare with their theoretical
predictions [40]. We hope the techniques we presented in this paper will develop the
use of lattice simulations in the bacterial context much further, for example, to study
pattern formation.
We hope that the lattice approach will provide new exact results for run-and-tumble
dynamics in higher dimensions, generalizing previous studies to more general external
potentials for sedimentation and trapping [14].
Last, there are some open question regarding the coexistence densities for
interacting bacteria. Although our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the
existence of phase separation, the coexistence densities are accurately predicted only
for isotropic kernels and large lattice occupancies. Quantitative predictions beyond this
case are yet to be derived. More generally, explicit two body interactions and more
general non-linear interaction kernels have not been looked at yet. These are a few of
the outstanding questions among the many concerning this new and interesting class of
models.

To calculate the correct manner in which to rescale our fields let us begin by considering
a system ` times larger and rescaling t → t`α , x → x`, ρ → ρ/` so that the action is
given by

exponentials to give

If we explicitly take Jˆ to scale as Jˆ → J`

Now, we need the coefficient of each term to be of order 1 or smaller so that no terms
blow up so
1−β−δ ≤ 0;

α−1−β ≤ 0;

α−δ ≤ 0;

α−2β ≤ 0;

1+α−β−δ ≤ 0.(A-8)

However, as we do not want to simply be left with ρ̇ = 0 we need α − δ = 0 and as
we also want to retain a noise, which corresponds to the Jˆ2 term, we also require that
α − 2β = 0. That leaves our action

is invariant under further diffusive scaling. Note that the scaling of the fields considered
here is arbitrary and we could choose to look at currents J, Jˆ larger than 1/`2 , 1/`. This
would correspond to trajectories whose probabilities are smaller than exp(−`), which
are not correctly described by fluctuating hydrodynamics and large deviations. One
can also check that under this rescaling, the action S1 stays of order 1 and aS1 is thus,
indeed, negligible.
For one isolated bacterium the run-and-tumble dynamics is a variant of a random
walk and is known to be diffusive at large scales [12, 13]. It is therefore not surprising
that we find α = 2. In the presence of interactions (as in section 4.2), a uniform density
profile of bacteria will continue to exhibit diffusive behaviour; the interactions will simply
rescale the diffusivity. If interactions cause the profile to become unstable, however, the
model can nevertheless give rise to length scales which grow in a non-diffusive manner,
as for example for coarsening (see section 5.3).

Now, we can define a new function κ (q) = j Kj exp(i j q). With this definition, and
the normalisation of Kj± , we can simplify equations (A-11).

For isotropic kernels, where κ± (q) = κ(q), it turns out we can write the eigenvalues in
a relatively simple form and, even without knowledge of the specific shape of Kj , we
can analyse the conditions under which there will exist positive eigenvalues. We start
by writing the eigenvalues of the matrix in equation (A-12) as

Further, as K(x) is always positive, κ(q) will have a maximum at q = 0, where κ(0) = 1,

When this inequality is fulfilled we will see instability. Given that r must be positive
this means any isotropic density kernel will be unstable in the range n0 ∈ [0.5 nm , nm ].
