Abstract
In computer simulations of spiking neural networks, often it is assumed that every two neurons of the
network are connected by a probability of 2%, 20% of neurons are inhibitory and 80% are excitatory.
These common values are based on experiments, observations, and trials and errors, but here, I take
a different perspective, inspired by evolution, I systematically simulate many networks, each with a
different set of parameters, and then I try to figure out what makes the common values desirable. I
stimulate networks with pulses and then measure their: dynamic range, dominant frequency of population
activities, total duration of activities, maximum rate of population and the occurrence time of maximum
rate. The results are organized in phase diagram. This phase diagram gives an insight into the space of
parameters – excitatory to inhibitory ratio, sparseness of connections and synaptic weights. This phase
diagram can be used to decide the parameters of a model. The phase diagrams show that networks
which are configured according to the common values, have a good dynamic range in response to an
impulse and their dynamic range is robust in respect to synaptic weights, and for some synaptic weights
they oscillate in α or β frequencies, even in absence of external stimuli.

Introduction

A simulation of neural network consists of model neurons that interact via network parameters;
The model is a set of differential equations that describes the behaviors of neurons and synapses,
captured by years of electro physiological studies [31]. A model can be as simple as Integrateand-fire or as realistic as Hodgkin-Huxley [39]. Realistic models generate reliable results, but
they are computationally expensive. On the other hand, simple models consume less computer
resources, at the cost of loosing details and biological plausibility; therefore, there is a delicate
balance between computational feasibility and biological plausibility, Fortunately, there are many
reviews and books that compare different models [39, 18, 20] and neural simulators [7]. They
help us to find a suitable model of a single neuron, set its parameters, and get reliable results in
a reasonable time.
No matter how much a neural model is detailed and efficient, A carelessly constructed networks of perfect neural models, is misleading. It only produces wrong biologically plausible
results, in a reasonable time. Unfortunately, network parameters are a lot more ambiguous.
There are four essential parameters in a neural network simulation that I investigated in
this work - the ratio of excitatory neurons to inhibitory neurons, the topology and sparseness of
connections, inhibitory and excitatory synaptic weights. To make it more general and realistic,
one may consider the values follow a distribution. This distribution function may change the
behavior.

There are experimental works that reads network parameters from nature [22, 21, 8, 33, 6, 13].
For example, Lefort et al studied the share of inhibitory neurons in each layer of C2 barrel column
of mouse [22]. They reported that 100, 16, 10, 8, 17, 17 and 9 percent of layer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A,
5B and 6 are inhibitory neurons, and in total, 11 percents of the column is made of inhibitory
neurons. They have also studied the synaptic connections of excitatory neurons, they reported
neurons of each layers 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and 6 is connected with the probability of 9.3, 18.7, 24.3,
19.1, 7.2 and 2.8 percents to the neurons of the same layer. Moreover, they have studied synaptic
weights by measuring unitary Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential (uEPSP), the mean uEPSP
for connections inside a layer are 0.64, 0.78, 0.95, 0.66, 0.71 and 0.53 mV for layer 2 to 6 but
the maximum values are much larger, 3.88, 2.76, 7.79, 5.24, 7.16 and 3 mV for the same layers
respectively.
The actual values in computer simulations usually are less diverse, In many computational
studies, 20% of the neurons are inhibitory, the network topology is a random graph with sparseness of 2% and there are only a couple of fixed synaptic weights for inhibitory and excitatory
neurons. Despite their simplicity, they observe many interesting phenomena like oscillations, synchrony, modulations [38, 7, 16, 9, 1, 30, 3] and even psychological disorders [4]. There are also
many works that show the results are not actually sensitive to the parameters [35, 28, 27, 26, 17].
Why do this parameters appear in nature? What are their evolutionary advantages? How
much is the result of a simulation robust in respect to the parameters? How does one decide
about the network parameters in a simulation? Which other parameters might give the same
results? These are few question that come to mind, while dealing with properties of neural
networks, and they could be easily answered by looking at a phase diagram of neural networks,
that shows the behavior of a network in respect to its parameters. Like the phase diagram of
water, tells us about the properties of water in different pressures and temperatures. But such a
phase diagram does not exist for spiking neural networks, yet. First, because of the large amount
of computation needed and second, because of the ambiguity of the concept of phase or state in
neural networks.
To answer these question, I could use sophisticated evolutionary algorithms, like the study
of evolution of intelligence by [29], however, I used a simple brute force search in the space of
parameters, so I can also generate a phase diagram, similar to the work of [36].

Method

I did a brute force search in the space of parameters, by simulating a population of 1000 neurons,
let say a part of a single layer of cortex, that receives excitatory signals from previous layer of
cortex or an external stimuli, and then sends excitatory signals to the next layer. There are
lateral connections among all types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory) in a single layer, but
only excitatory neurons interconnects different layers. I stimulated this network and watched its
response. This was repeated over a wide range of parameters. At the end I calculated fitness of
each set of parameters and then investigated the overlap of the best parameters according to my
simulation with the nature’s choices (or computational neuroscientists’ choices).
To do any sort of evolutionary analysis, first we need to agree on something to optimize –a
fitness function, it can be the network capacity to learn and store information [5], or it can be
the speed and the quality of transmitted signals [10]. But here, to define the fitness function, I
remind you of three obvious evolutionary facts:
1. High Dynamic Range is evolutionary favored, an animal that can see during days and
nights, has a higher survival chance than an animal which can see only during days.

Logarithm of stimuli in base 2

Fig. 1: This figure demonstrates a typical tuning curve and its dynamic range. Two consecutive
stimuli are different by a factor of 2, also known as one stop.
2. Small Just-Noticeable Difference is evolutionary favored, an animal which can discriminate
more grey levels or colors, has a better chance to find its preys and foods.
3. Low Energy Consumption is also favored, an energy efficient animal, consumes less food
and therefore has a better chance to survive [32].
Dynamic Range is the ratio of the largest possible value of stimuli to its smallest perceivable value. Just-Noticeable Difference is the smallest detectable difference between two sensory
stimuli, which is often roughly proportional to the magnitude of the stimulus. The ratio of
Just-Noticeable Difference to the magnitude of the stimulus is known as Weber constant [11].
Both Dynamic Range and Just-Noticeable are well presented in logarithmic scale, but instead of log10 and dB, from now on, I will use log2 and stop which are common in Optics and
Photography (FIG. 1).
Here we are left with a neural network and three concepts to play with – Dynamic Range,
Just-Noticeable Different and Energy Consumption. To keep it simple, I only measure Dynamic
Range while there are upper bounds for the other two. I require Just-Noticeable Different to be
smaller than one stop, thus, the calculated Dynamic Range is a lower bound for the real Dynamic
Range, and I require the Energy Consumption to be zero in absence of stimulus, which puts an
upper bound for the Energy Consumption. Moreover, energy consumption can be a determinant
factor when all other conditions are equal, when there are two sets of parameters with about
the same Dynamic Range, the one which consumed less energy will be favored, and here, the
measure of energy consumption is the number generated spikes [2].
I stimulated the network with a set of stimuli that were equally spaced in the logarithmic
scale, separated by 1 stop (×2) intervals, similar to FIG. 1. I ran the simulation for a given time
(1024ms) and then I calculated Dynamic Range over the range that Just-Noticeable Difference
was smaller than 1 stop.
To be precise, I used a sequence of n stimuli plus the resting state (no stimulus), so the
sequence includes n + 1 members s ∈ (s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . , sn ). Except s0 , the resting state, the
difference between i-th and (i + 1)-th stimulus is one stop: si+1 = 2 ∗ si . Each stimulus si
evokes a response r(si ) ∈ R, where R = (r(s0 ), r(s1 ), r(s2 ), . . . , r(sn )). Now, the Dynamic
Range is simply the number of elements in the largest subsequence of R′ ⊂ R that fulfills the

Fig. 2: A simplified schema of simulation setup. Here there are just N = 9 neurons (N = 1000 in
the actual simulation), in which Ne = 7 are excitatory neurons (circles) and Ni = 2 are
inhibitory neurons (disks). The network is stimulated three times, each time s ∈ (1, 2, 4)
neurons are stimulated (up left, down left and right respectively), with a pulse, in a way
that they fire once at time t = 0 and then they are like any other neuron in the network.
expectations,
1. For any r(si ), r(sj ) ∈ R′ , we should have si < sj ⇒ r(si ) < r(sj ). It means that R′ is
strictly monotonic and it satisfies the constrain on the Just-Noticeable difference.
2. For any si ∈ R′ , the network must return to resting state in acceptable time. This satisfy
the Energy Consumption constrains.
For example, if stimuli (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) leads to the responses (0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 4) then the subsequence
(0, 2, 3, 4) ⊂ R is the largest subsequence of R which meets all the conditions; Therefore, the
dynamic range is 4. In this way the minumum dynamic range can be 1 and its maximum can
reach the total number of stimuli.
In this study I assumed response r(s) as the maximum firing rate of population of excitatory
neurons in response to the stimulus s. But the paradigm of this study is general and can be
applied to any neural coding schemes.
I stimulated some of the neurons with an impulse, I forced si excitatory neurons to fire once at
time t = 0, then I monitored the propagation of the impulse. Here the number of excited neurons
represents the magnitude of the stimuli si . This is very similar to Optogenetics stimulation, in
which, a laser pulse excites a specific population of neurons [40, 24, 34, 23].
I used a simple compartment Izhikevic model [19]. It can imitate the behavior of HodgkinHuxley model, and its computational costs is comparable to the Integrate-and-fire model [20].
It is based on a system two-dimensional differential equations:

My network has a random graph topology [12]. In a random graph, every two neurons are
connected by probability p, called sparseness. This is one of the simplest topology for a network
or graph.
I simulated networks of N = 1000 neurons with
NI ∈ (100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
inhibitory neurons. The neurons were connected by a random graph topology, with the sparseness
p ∈ (0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16).
On the other hands, the synaptic weights are chosen randomly, but in a way to cover the
region of interest in the we , wi plane. In this way, it is always possible to add new points later
to improve results. The new points could be just another pair of connection weights(we , wi ) on
the same random netwrok, or they could be synaptic weights of a whole new realization.
I stimulated each network 10 times,
s ∈ (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256)
so in each trial, s neurons fire at t = 0. Then I watched the network for 1024ms. At the end,
I calculated Dynamic Range of the network. I repeated the whole process for few realization
of random networks and and then the median of all data in each hexagonal is calculated and
displayed (FIG. 2).
The whole process needs a great amount of computational power. That is the reason I used
NeMo (http://nemosim.sourceforge.net/), a neural simulator software that runs on GPU [14, 15],
but for the pilot study, I used Brian (http://briansimulator.org/) [16]. Both of them are open
source and available on their websites.

Results

I wanted to present the results as a function of 4 other parameters, for that I needed to map a
4-D space to a 2-D space. Here I used the template in figure 3, to present the dynamic ranges in
figure 4, oscillations in figure 5 , duration of activities in figure 6, maximum achieved firing rate
in each trial in figure 7 and the time of achieved maximum rate in figure 8 First I made the plots
of dynamic range in the space of synaptic weights – we and wi . Then I put these plots next to
each other according to sparseness of connections p and number of inhibitory neurons Ni .

Ni is the number of inhibitory neurons, we is the weight of excitatory synapses (a positive
number) and wi is the weight of inhibitory synapses (a negative number). The plane of
we and wi is divided into hexagonal bins. The color of each hexagon is defined by the
aggregated value of data points inside that hexagon. For aggregation, unless specified,
median value of points are used. If a hexagon is empty, then its color is white.

Discussion

In figure 4, top right corner of each figure is empty (white). This is where the excitatory neurons
dominates and the network riches its maximum firing rate, this region is visible in figure 7 as the
darkest shade of red. The left side of each graph, where the inhibitory sub-network dominates,
is also empty, but this time because networks did not return to resting states. More detail about
the length of activity demonstrated in figure 6.
A narrow band separate this two regions, on this band, the inhibitory and excitatory network
are balancing out each other. As we increase the number of connections, this band gets narrower,
the delicate balance can be easily disturbed. The dynamic ranges on this band is low or moderate.
At the bottom of each graph, there is another region with valid data points. In this region,
excitatory sub networks are not strong enough to saturate the system, so we have a good dynamic range regardless of the inhibitory synaptic weights. Nevertheless, stronger inhibitory sub
networks improves the dynamic range.
For the calculation of dynamic range, only trials who returned to resting state have been
used. But in many other trials the network sustained its activity up to the very last millisecond
of simulation (FIG 6). These networks shows interesting oscillatory behaviors, that can be seen
in figure 5 and figure 9. The oscillations are mostly α and β waves, with fewer case of γ waves.
There are also δ and θ waves, but the simulation time of 1 second may not be enough to study
these waves. We also didn’t consider the effect of GABAB receptors, which may be dominant
factor in slow rhythms oscillations like δ and θ waves.
The oscillation and synchrony of spiking neural networks are studied intensivly. Few examples
are [25, 3, 37, 1]. In most of these works, the neurons are intrinsically oscillatory or there is an
external force – a current, some noise or a few poison spike generators. But here, the networks
are stimulated with only a pulse, and then they are left alone, even though there is not any
spontaneous activity implemented in the model, yet, the networks show sustained oscillations.
The oscillation are mostly β-waves, and they happen in the region of dominating inhibitory
sub networks. As we get to the balanced inhibitory-excitatory band, the oscillations become
α-waves.

Fig. 9: An example of fast respoding network with a good dynamic range (left), poor dynamic
range (middle) and an example of oscillatory network (right). Population rates as a
function of time (top). The spiking activity of neurons (bottom). The red line separates
excitatory neurons (below the line) from inhibitory neurons (above the line).
It seems that the results are not very sensitive to the parameters, We can have good dynamic
range over some value of parameters, and we can have neural oscillators in different settings.
These finding confirms former studies [35, 28, 27, 26, 17].
The results of this paper, specially figure 4 and figure 5, serves as a starting point to decide
about parameters in a neural simulation, and they may help to find the networks with desired
behavior.
This work by no mean is complete, I only studied the effect of four parameters, in just
one model, over dynamic range and oscillations. Many other parameters could be included, like
network topology, synaptic delay and distribution of weights or connections. Also it is interesting
to know if my results holds for simpler models, like Integrate-and-fire.
At the end I suggest that any numerical simulation of neural network should be accompanied
with such a phase diagram, it demonstrate the robustness of the results in respect to the parameters. One good example is the the work of [36], where they made such diagram to compare
experimental data of orientation selectivity index of mouse primary virtual cortex to their model.
