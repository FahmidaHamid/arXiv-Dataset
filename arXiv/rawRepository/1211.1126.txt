Abstract
The cargo motion in living cells transported by two species of motor protein with different intrinsic
directionality is discussed in this study. Similar to single motor movement, cargo steps forward and
backward along microtubule stochastically. Recent experiments found that, cargo transportation by two
motor species has a memory, it does not change its direction as frequently as expected, which means that
its forward and backward step rates depends on its previous motion trajectory. By assuming cargo has
only the least memory, i.e. its step direction depends only on the direction of its last step, two cases of
cargo motion are detailed analyzed in this study: (I) cargo motion under constant external load; and
(II) cargo motion in one fixed optical trap. Due to the existence of memory, for the first case, cargo can
keep moving in the same direction for a long distance. For the second case, the cargo will oscillate in
the trap. The oscillation period decreases and the oscillation amplitude increases with the motor forward
step rates, but both of them decrease with the trap stiffness. The most likely location of cargo, where the
probability of finding the oscillated cargo is maximum, may be the same as or may be different with the
trap center, which depends on the step rates of the two motor species. Meanwhile, if motors are robust,
i.e. their forward to backward step rate ratios are high, there may be two such most likely locations,
located on the two sides of the trap center respectively. The probability of finding cargo in given location,
the probability of cargo in forward/backward motion state, and various mean first passage times of cargo
to give location or given state are also analyzed.

Introduction
Motility is one of the basic properties of living cells, in which cargos, including organelles and vesicles,
are usually transported by cooperation of various motor proteins [1, 2], such as the plus-end directed
kinesin and minus-directed dynein [3–5]. Experiments found that, using the energy released in ATP
hydrolysis [6–9], these motors can move processively along microtubule with step size 8 nm and in handover-hand manner [10–12].
Although numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been done to understand this cargo
transportation process, so far the mechanism of which is not fully clear. In [13], one basic model is
presented by assuming cargo is transported by only one motor species and all the motors share the
external load equally. Then in [14], one more realistic tug-of-war model is designed, in which the cargo
is assumed to be transported by two motor species with opposite intrinsic directionality, and motors can
reverse their motion direction under large external load. According to some experimental phenomena this
tug-of-war model seems reasonable [15, 16]. In either of the models given in [13, 14], the only interaction
among different motors is that, motors from the same species share load equally and motors from different
species act as load to each other. In [17–19], some complicated models are presented, in which interactions
among motors are described by linear springs. Recent experiments found that the tug-of-war model might
not be reasonable enough to explain some experimental phenomena, so several new models are designed
to try to understand the mechanism of cargo motion by multiple motors [20–26]. Finally, more discussion
about cargo transportation in cells can be found in [27–35].
In recent experiment [36], by measuring cargo dynamics in optical trap, Leidel et al. found cargo

2
motion along microtubule has memory. Cargo is more likely to resume motion in the same direction
rather than the opposite one. This finding implies that, cargo location in the next time depends not only
on its present location but also on how it reaches the present location. The behavior of cargo depends on
its motion trajectory, which is different from the assumptions in previous models. In this study, one model
for cargo motion with memory will be presented. But for simplicity, we assume that the cargo has only a
little memory, it can only remember the motion direction in its last step. The description and theoretical
analysis of the model with memory will be first given in the next section, and then corresponding results
will be presented in the following section. Results will be summarized in the final section.

Model for cargo motion with memory
In this study, the cargo is assumed to be tightly bound by two motor species: plus-end (or forward)
motors and minus-end (or backward) motors. The forward and backward step rates of each plus-end
motor are u and w, and the forward and backward step rates of each minus-end motor are f and b.
Obviously u ≫ w but b ≫ f when the external load is low, since the intrinsic directionalities of the two
motor species are opposite to each other, and the intrinsic motion direction of plus-end motor is plus-end
directed (i.e. to the plus-end of microtubule), but the intrinsic motion direction of minus-end motor is
minus-end directed (i.e. to the minus-end of microtubule). By assuming that all motors from the same
motor species share the load equally, we only need to discuss the simplest cases in which the cargo is
transported by only one plus-end motor and one minus-end motor. For example, if there are k plus-end
motors, the total external load is Fc , the forward and backward step rates of one single plus-end motor
are uc and wc , and the motor step size is lc . Then these k plus-end motors can be effectively replaced by
one single plus-end motor with load F = Fc /k, step rates u = kuc and w = kwc , and step size l0 = lc /k.
Since the experiments in [36] showed that, the number of motors moving the cargo is usually the same
in both directions, this study also assumes the step sizes of the plus-end motor and minus-end motor are
the same (note, the step size of single plus-end motor kinesin and step size of single minus-end motor
dynein are the same l0 ≈ 8 nm [2, 9, 12]).
This study will mainly discuss two special cases: (I) Cargo moves under constant external load. In
vitro, this constant load may be applied by one feedback optical trap, or In vivo, this constant load may
be from the viscous environment with invariable drag coefficient. (II) Cargo moves in one fixed optical
trap, this case is easy to be performed experimentally, and so the corresponding theoretical results are
easy to be verified.

Cargo Motion under constant load
For the sake of convenience, the cargo is said to be in plus-state n+ if it reached its present location
n by one forward step from location n − 1. Similarly, the cargo is said to be in minus-state n− if its
previous step is minus-end directed, see Fig. 1(a) for the schematic depiction. In plus-state, the forward
step rate is higher than backward step rate u > w, but in minus-state the forward step rate is lower than
backward step rate f < b. So in plus-state, the cargo is more likely to move forward, but in minus-state,
the cargo will be more likely to move backward. For example, for a cargo in location n, if its previous
step is plus-end directed, from either plus-state n+ − 1 or minus-state n− − 1 to location n, then in the
next step the cargo will be more likely to move to location n + 1 (plus-state n+ + 1), since the cargo is now
in plus-state n+ and its forward step rate u is higher than its backward step rate w. On the contrary,
if it got to its present location n from location n + 1 (either from plus-state n+ + 1 or from minus-state
n− + 1), then in the next step the cargo will be more likely to move to location n − 1 (minus-state n− − 1),
since the cargo is now in minus-state n− and its backward step rate b is higher than its forward step rate
f . This behavior means that the cargo can remember its motion direction of its last step.

Let p, ρ be probabilities of cargo in plus-state and minus-state respectively, then
dp/dt = f ρ − wp = −dρ/dt.

(1)

Using the normalization condition p + ρ = 1, its steady state solution can be obtained as follows
p = f /(f + w),

ρ = w/(f + w).

(2)

Let Uef f = up + f ρ, Wef f = wp + bρ, then the mean velocity of cargo can be obtained as follows
V = (Uef f − Wef f )l0 = [(u − w)p + (f − b)ρ]l0 = (uf − wb)l0 /(f + w),

(3)

where l0 is the step size of cargo. The probabilities that cargo steps forward and backward are then

Finally, the external load F dependence of rate u, w, f, b can be given by the following Bell approximation [37–40],
u = u0 e−ǫ0 F l0 /kB T ,

w = w0 e(1−ǫ0 )F l0 /kB T ,

f = f0 e−ǫ1 F l0 /kB T ,

b = b0 e(1−ǫ1 )F l0 /kB T .

(5)

Where ǫ0 and ǫ1 are load distribution factors for the plus-end motor and minus-end motor, respectively.
kB is Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

Cargo Motion in one fixed optical trap
This special case is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(b). For convenience, the center of optical trap
is assumed to be fixed at location 0. For this case, the potential of cargo depends on its location n.
The potential difference between location n and location n + 1 is ∆Gn = κ[(n + 1)l0 ]2 /2 − κ(nl0 )2 /2 =
κ(n + 1/2)l02. Similar as in [19], at location n, the forward and backward step rates un and wn of cargo
in plus-state, as well as the step rates fn and bn of cargo in minus-state, can be obtained as follows,
un = ue−ǫ0 ∆Gn/kB T ,

wn = we(1−ǫ0 )∆Gn−1 /kB T ,

fn = f e−ǫ1 ∆Gn /kB T ,

bn = be(1−ǫ1 )∆Gn−1 /kB T . (6)

Where u, w, f, b are cargo step rates when there is no optical trap and any other external load, which
satisfy u ≫ w, b ≫ f . For simplicity, this study assumes that ǫ0 , ǫ1 are independent of cargo location n.
Let pn , ρn be the probabilities of finding cargo in plus-state n+ and minus-state n− , respectively. One
can easily show pn , ρn are governed by the following equations
dpn /dt = un−1 pn−1 + fn−1 ρn−1 − (un + wn )pn ,

(7a)

dρn /dt = wn+1 pn+1 + bn+1 ρn+1 − (fn + bn )ρn .

Specially, for the symmetric cases u = b, w = f , i.e. the cargo is transported by two motors with the
same step rates but different intrinsic directionality, one can verify that ρn = p−n and consequently
ρ = p, hn− i = −hn+ i, hni = 0.
The external load dependence of rates un , wn , fn , bn [see Eq. (6)] means that, for a cargo towed by
two motors in one fixed optical trap there are two critical values of the cargo location n,

where ⌈x⌉ is the smallest integer number which is not less than x, ⌊x⌋ is the biggest integer number
which is not bigger than x. The step rates of plus-end motor satisfy un > wn for n < nc+ , and un ≤ wn
for n ≥ nc+ . Similarly, the step rates of minus-end motor satisfy bn > fn for n > nc− , and bn ≤ fn
for n ≤ nc− . The intrinsic directionality of plus-end motor (u ≫ w) implies nc+ > 0, and the intrinsic
directionality of minus-end motor (b ≫ f ) implies nc− < 0. Generally, the critical values nc+ and nc−
are different with the mean locations hn+ i and hn− i.
In the following of this section, various mean first passage time (MFPT) problems about the cargo
motion in fixed optical trap will be discussed.

cargo in fixed optical trap can be approximated as follows

Results
For cargo motion under no external load, Monte Carlo simulations show that, if the cargo is transported by two symmetric motors, i.e., the plus-end motor and the minus-end motor have the same step
rates, u = b, w = f , the cargo will oscillate [Fig. 2(a)]. While for the asymmetric cases, the cargo has
non-zero mean velocity [see Fig. 2(b)]. On the other hand, if the cargo is put into one fixed optical trap,
and transported by two symmetric motors, it will oscillate around the trap center with relatively high
frequency [Fig. 2(c)]. Meanwhile, if the trapped cargo is transported by two asymmetric motors, it will
also oscillate but its oscillation center may be different with the trap center [Fig. 2(d)]. Both Monte Carlo
simulations and theoretical calculations show that, for a cargo transported by two symmetric motors and
put in one optical trap, its oscillation period T decreases with trap stiffness κ, motor forward step rates
u = b, and motor backward step rates w = f [Fig. 3(a-c)]. Its oscillation amplitude increases with the
motor forward step rates u = b, but decreases with both the motor backward step rates u = b and the
trap stiffness κ, since high backward step rates and high trap stiffness will prohibit the cargo from moving
too far from the trap center [Fig. 3(d-f)].

Then p is the probability of finding cargo in plus-state, P+ is the probability that cargo location n > 0
(the center of optical trap is assumed to be at location 0). The meanings of ρ and P− are similar. Both
Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical calculations show that, for a cargo transported by two symmetric
motors, the ratios p/ρ and P+ /P− are always one, and they do not change with trap stiffness κ, forward
step rates u = b, and backward step rates w = f [Fig. S1].
Our results also show that, for cargo motion in optical trap by two asymmetric motors, its oscillation
period T decreases with trap stiffness κ and forward step rate u, but may not change monotonically with
backward step rate w [Figs. S2(a), S3(a), S4(a)]. But similar as the symmetric cases, cargo oscillation
amplitude of the asymmetric cases decreases with trap stiffness κ and backward step rate w, and increases
with the forward step rate u [Figs. S2(d), S3(d), S4(d)]. The results in Figs. S3(d), and S4(d) imply
that, the maximal location nmax that cargo might reach toward the plus-end of microtubule depends only
on the step rates u, w of the plus-end motor, and similarly the minimal location nmin that cargo might
reach towards the minus-end of the microtubule depends only on the step rates b, f of the minus-end
motor. From the results given in Figs. S2(b,c), S3(b,c), and S4(b,c) one can also see that, different from
the symmetric cases given in Fig. S1, both the ratio p/ρ and ratio P+ /P− depend on trap stiffness κ,
forward step rate u, and backward step rate w.
To show more details about the dependence of cargo oscillation on trap stiffness κ and motor step
rates, examples of probabilities pn , ρ, and their summation pn + ρn are plotted in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5.
For either symmetric cases or asymmetric cases, the probability profiles are flat for low trap stiffness κ,
indicating that the cargo can reach a farther location from the oscillation center (i.e., with large oscillation
amplitude)[Fig. S5]. Similar changes can also be found with the increase of motor forward step rates u
or f [Fig. 4(a, b, d)]. Meanwhile, with the increase of motor backward step rates w or f , the probability
profile will become more sharp [Fig. 4(c)]. For the asymmetric cases, the most likely location of cargo
may be different from the trap center [Fig. S5(c)]. One interesting phenomenon displayed in Fig. 4(b,
d) is that, for either the symmetric cases or the asymmetric cases, when motor forward step rates u, b
are high, the summation of probability pn + ρn may has two local maxima, indicating that cargo motion
in the positive location (n > 0) is mainly dominated by the plus motor, while its motion in the negative
location (n < 0) is mainly dominated by the minus motor.
Let Nmax pn , Nmax ρn , N(pn +ρn )max be the locations at which probabilities pn , ρn and their summation
pn + ρn reach their maxima, respectively. The results plotted in Fig. 5(a) show that, for symmetric
motion, Nmax ρn = −Nmax pn and their absolute values increase with the forward to backward step rate

8
ratio u/w = b/f . The results in Fig. 5(d) show that, for low step rate ratio u/w = b/f , the total
probability pn + ρn has only one maximum which lies at the trap center. However, with increase of these
ratios, N(pn +ρn )max has one symmetric bifurcation, and its absolute value (see Fig. 4) increases with these
step ratios. For asymmetric case [see Fig. 5(b)], Nmax pn increases with step rate ratio u/w, but Nmax ρn
is independent of it. Which means that, similar as the properties of nmax and nmin displayed in Figs.
S3 and S4, Nmax pn depends only on step rates of the plus-end motor, and Nmax ρn depends only on step
rates of the minus-end motor. For asymmetric cases, with the increase of rate ratio u/w, N(pn +ρn )max has
also one bifurcation, see Fig. 5(e). But one of the two values (the negative one) does not change with
u/w. Which means that, the negative one of N(pn +ρn )max depends only on properties of the minus-end
motor. Similarly, the positive one of N(pn +ρn )max depends only on properties of the plus-end motor. So
both the properties of amplitude nmax , nmin and the most likely locations Nmax pn , Nmax ρn , N(pn +ρn )max
indicate that, the plus-end directed motion of cargo is mainly determined by the plus-end motor, and
the minus-end directed motion is mainly determined by the minus-end motor, which is one of the main
differences with other tug-of-war models [14,18,19,21], and this result is consistent with the experimental
phenomena [15,16,36]. Finally, the results in Fig. 5(c) show that, the absolute values of Nmax pn , Nmax ρn
decrease with trap stiffness κ, and Fig. 5(f) shows N(pn +ρn )max does not change with stiffness κ. So trap
stiffness can change the oscillation amplitude and the oscillation period (see Figs. 3, S2, and S5), but
will not change the most likely location N(pn +ρn )max of the cargo. Further calculations of probabilities
p, ρ show that, for the symmetric cases both pmax = ρmin and (p + ρ)min decrease with step rate ratio
u/w = b/f , and increase with trap stiffness κ [see Figs. S6(a,d)]. Since with large rate ratio u/w = b/f
and small stiffness κ, the cargo will oscillate with large amplitude. For the asymmetric cases, pmax 6= ρmin ,
pmax decreases but ρmin increases with the step rate ratio u/w (i.e. with the increase of the directionality
of the plus-end motor). Since with large rate ratio u/w, the plus-end motor has high directionality, and
so the cargo moves fast in the plus-state, which means that the probability pn will be flat with large u/w.
The plots in Fig. S6(c) show that, although the total probability pn + ρn has two maxima, with the
change of rate ratio u/w, the most likely location of cargo may change from one side of the trap center
to another side.
Finally, several examples of MFPTs tln , τnl , t̄ln , τ̄nl are plotted in Fig. 6(a,b) and Figs. S7, S8(a,b),
S9-S12, and examples of MFPTs Tnl± are plotted in Fig. 6(c,d) and Fig. S8(c,d). If m < n < l, then

Concluding Remarks
Recent experimental observations by Leidel et al. [36] show that, in living cells cargo moves along
microtubule with memory, i.e., its motion direction depends on its previous motion trajectory. In this
study, such cargo transportation is theoretically studied by assuming that the cargo has the least memory,
i.e. its motion direction depends only on its behavior in its last step. The cargo will be more likely to step
forward/backward if it came to its present location by one forward/backward step. Two cases are mainly
discussed: (I) cargo moves under constant load, and (II) cargo moves in one fixed optical trap. For each
cases, two kinds of motion are addressed: (i) symmetric motion, in which cargo is transported by two
species of motor protein which have the same forward/backward step rates but with different intrinsic
directionality, (ii) asymmetric motion, in which cargo is transported by two species of motor protein with
different forward/backward step rates. For the symmetric motion (i) of case (I), the mean velocity of
cargo is zero. But, due to the existence of memory, cargo can move unidirectionally for a large distance
before switching its direction. One can easily understand that, for the asymmetric motion (ii) of (I),

9
the directionality of cargo with memory is better than that in the usual tug-of-war model by two different
motor species [14, 19, 21]. For the motion in one fixed optical trap, i.e. case (II), cargo will oscillate. For
the symmetric motion (i), the oscillation center is the same as the trap center, but for the asymmetric
motion (ii) , this oscillation center is generally different from the trap center. Usually the oscillation
period decreases with the trap stiffness κ and motor step rates. Meanwhile, the oscillation amplitude
decreases with trap stiffness κ and motor backward step rates w, f , but increases with motor forward step
rates u, b. The probability pn + ρn of finding cargo at location n may have only one maximum, which is
the same as the trap center for symmetric motion (i) but different with the trap center for asymmetric
motion (ii). Meanwhile, the probability pn + ρn may also have two maxima. For symmetric motion (i),
these two maxima are located symmetrically on the two side of the trap center, and their corresponding
values of probability pn + ρn are the same. However, for the asymmetric motion (ii), these two maxima
are generally not symmetrically located around the trap center, and their corresponding probabilities may
be greatly different. With the change of ratio of motor forward to backward step rates, the maximum
with the larger value of probability pn + ρn may transfer from one side of the trap center to another
side. This study will be helpful to understand the high directionality of cargo motion in living cells by
cooperation of two species of motor protein. Meanwhile, more generalized model can also be employed to
discuss this cargo transportation process, in which the cargo is assumed to have long memory, its forward
and backward step rates depend on how long it has kept moving in its present direction.

Figure 1. Schematic depiction of the model discussed in this study to explain the cargo motion with
memory. (a) is for cargo motion under constant load, and (b) is for cargo motion in one fixed optical
trap. At any location n, the cargo may be in two different states, plus-state n+ and minus-state n− .
Cargo in plus-state n+ means it reaches location n from location n − 1, while cargo in minus-state
means it is from location n + 1. For a cargo in plus-state n+ , its forward and backward step rates are u
and w respectively. But for a cargo in minus-state n− , it has different step rates f and b. For the
constant load cases (a), u > w and b > f mean that, if the cargo is in plus-state n+ it will be more likely
to move forward to location n + 1. Otherwise, it will be more likely to move backward to location n − 1.

as the ones of the minus motor, i.e. u = b, w = f ), the cargo will oscillate around its initial location (a).
While for the asymmetric cases, the cargo will have nonzero mean velocity (b). If the cargo is put in
one fixed optical trap and transported by two symmetric motors, it will oscillate around the trap center
(c). But for the asymmetric cases, the oscillation center may be different from the trap center. For

Figure 3. In fixed optical trap, the mean oscillation period T of cargo decreases with trap stiffness κ,
forward rates u = b, and backward rates w = f (in fact, log T decreases almost linearly with log κ,
log u = log b, and log w = log f ). The oscillation amplitude nmax − nmin decreases with stiffness κ and
backward rates w = f , but increases with forward rates u = b. Here nmax and nmin are the max and
min locations that cargo can reaches. The circles and squares are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.
In (a, b, c), the solid curves are obtained by formulation (31). The solid lines in (d) are obtained by
nc+ , nc− given in Eq. (11), and the solid lines in (e, f) are obtained by nc+ + 3, nc− − 3, respectively.
