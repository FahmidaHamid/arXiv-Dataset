Abstract
Heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV) has been proposed as a marker for depressive
symptoms and other aspects of mental health. However, the real correlation between them is
presently uncertain, as previous studies have generally been conducted on the basis of small
samples. In a sample of 113 adult male prisoners, we analyzed correlations between five
measures of HR/HRV and five psychological measures of mental health aspects (depression,
state and trait anxiety, and social relationships). We used Nadaraya-Watson non-parametric
regression in both directions and age-stratified Spearman correlation to detect possible
relations. Despite strong correlations among HR/HRV measures and among psychological
measures, correlations between HR/HRV and psychological measures were low and nonsignificant for the overall sample. However, we found an age dependency, suggesting some
correlations in younger people (HR with STAI-State, r = 0.39; with HADS-Anxiety, r = 0.52;
both p < .005). Overall, the general utility of HR/HRV as a marker for mental health across
populations remains unclear. Future research should address age and other potential
confounders more consistently.

i. Introduction
In evidence-based mental health care, it is important, but not always straightforward, to
choose the best measures to assess outcomes. Already selecting the right domain can be
challenging – for example, one has to choose between ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ outcome
domains (e.g., symptoms or functioning), and between proximal (direct) or distal
(downstream) outcomes, all to reflect best what the intervention can do and what clients and
providers need or request (1). In addition, choosing the right data source for a given domain is
more than a technicality. A relatively recent challenge in this context is the choice between
traditional psychological assessments (i.e., either self-report or assessor-based, often using
1

HRV and mental health
questionnaires) versus newer neurophysiological measures. Neurophysiological assessments
rely on technological tools for measuring some indicator of brain activity. If successful, such
measures may provide a more objective basis for judging someone’s mental health, as they
are less susceptible to purposeful distortions and biases than traditional psychological
assessments. In addition, they might also help to understand links between mental and somatic
processes. However, in contrast to questionnaire-based methods, physiological indicators are
usually ‘found’ rather than developed for the purpose. They are therefore reflective of a
variety of factors, including many that may be unrelated to the domain of interest and that will
complicate the use of these measures by acting as noise or confounding variables (2). For
example, a recent study showed almost no correlation between encephalographic markers for
depression/anxiety and psychological assessments of these domains (3). However, many
recent studies have used or suggested physiological indicators of mental health as outcomes,
either alongside or instead of psychological assessments (4-11).
Heart rate variability (HRV) is one such marker. As a potential biomarker, it is “important not
so much for what it tells us about the state of the heart as much as it is important for what it
tells us about the state of the brain” (12). HRV is influenced by various influences from the
brain, including both the sympathetic as well as the parasympathetic nervous system. Simply
put, sympathetic input increases the heart rate (in response to stressors, to facilitate ‘fight or
flight’ behaviors), and parasympathetic input decreases it (to enable relaxation, to facilitate
‘rest and digest’ behaviors). High HRV might therefore indicate that both systems work well
and are in balance; the individual is able to respond and adapt to stressful situations as well as
to relax. HRV has therefore been suggested as a potential biomarker for numerous aspects of
mental health: It could be a “marker of stress and health” (12), or of “stress and resilience” (p.
751). It has also been suggested to reflect the “link between emotional states and dispositions
such as depression, anxiety, anger and hostility, alexithymia, and physical health” (p. 751)
and even “post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia” (p. 750). Which of these it
should reflect most remains however unclear. It may be a non-specific indicator of mental
health rather than specific to certain disorders. Average heart rate (HR), an older and simpler
measure than HRV, may also indicate aspects of mental (as well as physical) health (13, 14).
The potential link of HRV with depression has been studied most extensively. A recent metaanalysis examined the association between HRV and depression in people without
cardiovascular disease (15). Based on four included studies (total n=200), a moderately strong
correlation between HRV and depression severity was found (r = -0.35, p < 0.001). However,
the included studies were small. A larger study with negative findings was excluded from the
meta-analysis (16), partly because it was unpublished (17). Publication bias – the selective
publication of studies with positive results – may be an issue (18). In addition, given that
several measures of HRV exist, selective reporting of positive measures within studies may
also be associated with overestimating the true association (18). It remains therefore unclear
how well HRV really performs as a potential biomarker of depression. Furthermore, it has
been suggested that associations between HRV and mental health may be non-linear (15, 17),
but previous studies have relied on linear correlation analysis. Finally, correlations with other
aspects of mental health have not been examined systematically. A recent meta-analysis
suggested categorical differences in HRV between people with and without anxiety disorders,
but did not examine correlations with the severity of anxiety symptoms (19). One study
suggested that social relationships may also be related to HRV (20).
HRV may also be relevant in prisoners. Some prisoners have alleviated levels of depression
and anxiety (21). Several studies have investigated possible links between antisocial behavior

2

HRV and mental health
and HR (22) or between psychopathy and anxiety (23), but these links are not yet clearly
understood.
The present study aimed at examining linear and non-linear associations between various
aspects of mental health – standardised measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of social
relationships – and different measures of HR/HRV, in male adult prisoners. Specifically, we
hypothesized that HRV would be positively correlated to positive aspects of mental health
(social relationships) and negatively to its negative aspects (depression and anxiety), and vice
versa for HR.
ii. Material and Methods
2.1 Participants
We used an existing sample of 113 adult male prisoners originally recruited for an
intervention study (21) (trial registration: ISRCTN22518605). Ethical approval was granted
by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics Western Norway (REK
Vest). Prisoners have on average higher levels of mental health problems than the general
population and are a high-risk group for mental disorders (24, 25). All inmates at Bjørgvin
prison, Norway, who had sufficient command of the Norwegian language and consented to
participate in the study were eligible. They were given verbal and written information about
the project and were included if they decided to sign an informed consent statement.
Participants were between 18 and 64 years of age (M = 31.38, see Table 1). Expected stay at
the prison ranged widely from 4 to 840 days, with a median of 42 days. (This variable is
reported purely for descriptive purposes and was not used in the analysis.) Levels of selfreported anxiety and depression were somewhat alleviated in the sample; 45% had clinically
relevant levels of anxiety and 29% had clinically relevant depression (Table 1). These cutoffs
were defined by previous research (26) and correspond to criteria for generalized anxiety
disorder or major depressive episode, respectively.
2.2 Psychological measures
We used well-established psychological measures of anxiety, depression, and social
relationships, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (27, 28) with subdomains state
anxiety (STAI-State) and trait anxiety (STAI-Trait); the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (26, 29, 30) with subdomains anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D); and the
Social Relationships scale of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire,
Q-LES-Q (31). Internal consistency of these measures in the present sample was high
(ranging from 0.77 for HADS-D to 0.94 for STAI-State).
2.3 Physiological measures
HR and HRV was registered using the Actiheart System (32), a compact lightweight device
that records physical activity, HR, and variability of cardiac inter-beat interval. The Actiheart
clips onto a single ECG electrode (Cleartrode, Disposable Pregelled Electrodes, 150, Standard
Silver) with a short ECG lead to another electrode that picks up the ECG signal. The electrode
was placed on the upper chest. Resting (baseline) psychophysiological activity was registered
for five minutes while the participants were seated in a comfortable chair. The inter-beatinterval data was manually cleaned. A start and an end point were selected, and the area was
replaced with the previous 15 seconds. As measures of HRV, we extracted root mean of the
squared successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz; absolute
values), low frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz; absolute values), and ratio of low and high
frequency power (LF divided by HF: LF/HF), as well as HR. The HF and LF power were
derived by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analysis.

2.4 Data preparation
All physiological measures except HR showed a skewed distribution and were logtransformed to remove this skewness. Two outliers with extreme LF and HF values were
removed from all HRV variables.
2.5 Statistical analyses
The relations between psychological and physiological measures were investigated by
graphical and computational methods. We used scatterplots between all measures and added
bidirectionally non-parametrically smoothed curves (Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression (33),
Gaussian kernel, bandwidth: b=0.6SD). Here, stronger association should result in more
similar curves while a weak association should lead to orthogonal regression lines.
As main criterion for the association between the measures we chose the Spearman
correlation. The correlations were interpreted as small (0.10), medium (0.30), and large
(0.50), according to Cohen’s guidelines (34). They were computed both for the entire sample
and stratified for the younger and the older participants. Since there is no established age cutoff we first screened by a moving cut-off for age where both groups contained at least 10
participants. The relation between age cut-off and correlations was very difficult to interpret.
Therefore, to avoid over-interpretation of the data we decided to use a median cut-off at the
age of 28. This seemed to represent the data well and also guaranteed a sufficient size of both
groups, so that we base the reported results and the discussion on it. We tested for all
correlations if they were significantly different from 0.
The general significance level was set to 0.05. Due to large amount of test we had to take into
account multiple effects. The Bonferroni adjustment for all 45 pairwise tests would have been
too conservative because the tests were not independent. Thus, we based the adjustment on
the number of investigated variables, leading to a marginal significance level of 0.005
(Bonferroni for 10 tests).
Additionally, we estimated linear models with the psychological measures as outcome and the
physiological measures as predictor. Here, we computed a fully adjusted model containing all
physiological measures as well as unadjusted models for each physiological measure. All
models were controlled for age (continuous). Although age was confirmed to be an important
confounding variable, keeping age as a continuous confounder in the regression models did
not improve the results compared to the correlation analyses. Consequently, we decided to
present the analysis stratified by age, as described above. All computation was done by
Matlab 7.10 (Mathworks Inc.).
iii. Results
A descriptive overview of the measured variables is seen in Table 1 and the results of the
graphical and the correlation analysis for all participants in Figure 1. Considering the entire
sample we can clearly distinguish two blocks of variables. The first block is represented by
the lower left square of 5x5 correlations between psychological and physiological measures,
those that were of the main interest in this study. These correlations are all between zero and
the small range; their low values are also indicated by nearly black color. None of these
correlations is significant (not even with the unadjusted significance level 0.05). The other
block includes all correlations outside this square, those within measure type. Here, all
correlations within the psychological and almost all within the physiological measures are in

4

HRV and mental health
the medium or large range and significant even at the adjusted significance level. As the only
exception, LF/HF was not significantly correlated to HR and LF (correlation values zero to
small).
The results of the graphical and the correlation analyses for the younger participants are seen
in Figure 2 and for the older ones in Figure 3.
Comparing the psychological with the physiological measures we observed overall a weak
pattern for the younger group. Two significant positive correlations of HR with STAI-Trait
(r=0.39, p=0.0042) and HADS-A (r=0.52, p=0.0002) were in the medium to large range.
STAI-State and HADS-D were not significantly correlated with HR but show the same
tendencies (with estimates in the medium range). Even if not significant with respect to the
adjusted level, we observed weak tendencies for a similar behaviour of the STAI- and the
HADS-variables, i.e. negative correlation to RMSSD, LF and HF and positive correlations to
LF/HF for the younger group (in the small to medium range). Q-LES-Q had for the younger
group a weak tendency to correlate positively to RMSSD , LF and HF (medium range) and
not to HR or LF/HF (below the small range). For the older group we could not see tendencies
of a correlation between physiological and psychological variables (all in the small range or
below). The regression analysis did not lead to different results such that we abstain from
reporting the details.
iv. Discussion
4.1 Findings
Overall, this study did not find convincing evidence of a clear general relationship between
HR/HRV and depression or other aspects of mental health in adult male prisoners. This was in
spite of avoiding some of the main limitations of previous studies: Most importantly, the
present study had a larger sample size and therefore higher test power than the individual
studies combined in the previous meta-analysis (15). Further innovative aspects of this study
were that it used advanced statistical methods that could detect non-linear relations, and that it
analyzed several measures of both HRV and mental health. However, it would be premature
to conclude that there is no relationship, even in this specific population of male prisoners.
The relationship is apparently dependent on different conditions.
First, we observed and partially described an age dependency: In younger participants, HR
correlated significantly with trait anxiety and general anxiety; tendencies were also found for
state anxiety and depression symptoms. These correlations were positive, suggesting that
higher HR indicates higher levels of anxiety and possibly depression symptoms. In contrast to
HR, none of the HRV correlated significantly with any of the psychological measures,
although some tendencies were observed among younger participants. These tendencies
concerned RMSSD, HF, and LF/HF but not LF. These correlations suggest that lower HRV
may indicate higher anxiety and depression symptoms as well as poorer quality social
relationships in young adults. Thus, for younger adults the results are in line with previous
research investigation the relationship between HRV and aspects of mental health (15, 19,
20). However, in older adults, neither HR nor HRV seemed to be a useful indicator of mental
health, at least in this study. Generally, “it is likely that any relationship between HR, HRV
and mood and anxiety is small to moderate at most” (Andrew Kemp, personal
correspondence, July 2014). Figure 4 illustrates the correlations in the present study in direct
comparison to previous meta-analytic findings (15) for depression symptoms, the variable
studied most extensively. The estimate from the previous meta-analysis (first row in the
figure) summarizes the correlation of any HRV measure with depression symptoms. The

5

HRV and mental health
present study found correlations in similar size for RMSSD, LF, and HF among younger
participants, and also for HR (with opposite sign, as hypothesized), but not for LF/HF and not
for older participants.
Second, our sample was different from previous samples in that the present sample included a
range of severity levels as not all of our participants were at clinical levels (21). However,
clear correlations within the two blocks of physiological and psychological measures suggest
that our negative findings were not due to limited variation within our sample. This may
indicate that the range of the measures has an impact on the relationship between the
investigated psychological and HR/HRV-measures.
Third, potential confounding factors that were not available in the present study may have
masked existing associations. Numerous confounding variables have been suggested,
including but not limited to cardiovascular disease (16, 17), drug abuse (21), medication,
physical fitness, body mass index, respiration, restrictions prior to ECG recording, and many
others (35). Some of these may be especially relevant in an older cohort (cardiovascular
disease, but also hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia), perhaps particularly in a prisoner
population. In relation to the latter, the present study did not control for antisocial behavior or
psychopathy. Prisoners are very often associated with antisocial behavior, and the relationship
between antisocial behavior and HRV is complicated and not clearly understood (36).
Antisocial behavior might be associated with both low resting HR (22) as well as high level of
anxiety (23). However, the relationship between antisocial behavior and HRV reactivity to
stress-situations may be different (e.g. increased HR in response to stress compared to
controls (37). One reason for these limitations is that the data for this study were not
specifically collected with a view to investigating the relationship between measures of
mental health and HR/HRV; however, it should be noted that it will always be possible to find
potential confounders post hoc (and the zeal to find them may be especially high when
findings are negative). Thus, we are not able to give any final answers, but we have presented
arguments for the need of a proper study to understand this relationship. Such a study should
consider to control for age and possibly other confounding variables.
Consequently, the findings from this study are less positive than those of previous studies.
Interestingly, HR appeared to be a better indicator of mental health than HRV, but more
clearly so in younger participants. Given that HRV as a more sophisticated measure has
attracted much more attention in the research literature than HR, publication bias should be
considered as one possible explanation. Bias can occur on two levels: selective publication of
positive studies, and selective publication of positive measures within studies. In spite of
initiatives to encourage publication of negative findings, reviewers, editors and even authors
themselves tend to be more critical of study methods if findings were negative (38).
4.2 Technical remarks
One issue of studies with multiple dependent tests is the selection of the significance level. In
Appendix A.1 we report the implications of our chosen marginal level (0.005) on the
familywise error rates. Conversely, an adjustment of the significance level always leads to a
reduction of power. In Appendix A.2 we show that we had sufficient power using the adjusted
level.
4.3 Implications for research and use of biomarkers
Like other potential biomarkers for mental health (3), much basic research remains to be done
before application in clinical trials can seriously commence. Even as a surrogate outcome, the

6

HRV and mental health
relation of the biomarker candidate with the clinical outcome needs to be confirmed with
greater certainty than is presently the case. There are numerous hypotheses about the role of
HRV in describing mental health (12, 15, 19, 20), which are interesting, but our findings
suggest, in line with others (35), that caution is needed when using HRV across a range of
participants with different characteristics. There seems to be no simple relation between
HR/HRV and specific aspects of mental health; rather, the relation between them may be
unspecific and complicated by a large number of confounders (of which our study has
confirmed one). In addition, the issue of publication bias may deserve increased attention also
in correlational studies of biomarkers. Prospective registration of studies, which has become a
requirement in clinical trials (18), may also serve to improve trust in research findings in this
area (39).
Due to the remaining uncertainties around the validity of HRV as a biomarker of mental
health across populations and age groups, clinical trials of intervention effects should continue
to use traditional clinical measures, such as questionnaires and clinical assessments, as
primary outcomes (3). Physiological measures of mental health can serve as additional
surrogate outcomes but their correlation with clinical outcomes should be carefully examined.
More generally, the link between physical and mental health remains a challenge. As new
potential biomarkers continue to be proposed and developed, these will again create a need for
thorough and critical evaluation of their actual value in clinical applications. Future research
might bring more satisfying answers to the ability of HRV and other physiological measures
to indicate aspects of mental health.

The elements of the matrix plot are: (i) Subplots in the diagonal: Histograms of each variable.
(ii) Upper right triangle: Bivariate scatter plots with regression lines (Nadaraya-Watson kernel
regression, Gaussian kernel, bandwidth: b=0.6SD). The red lines are the regression line for
the y-axis depending on the x-axis; the green lines are regression lines for the x-axis
depending on the y-axis. (iii) Lower left triangle: Spearman correlations between variables as
numbers and coded as colours with the corresponding p-values for the test if they equal 0.

A. Appendix
A.1 Determination of the marginal significance level
If one does a number of tests, the probability to obtain a type I error in at least one of them
increases with each additional test (using the same significance level). This probability is
called familywise error rate (FWER). With a level of 0.05 and independent tests, one can
expect that about 5% of the tests will be wrongly rejected. One approach to handle that
problem is to adjust the marginal significance level (level for each single test) such that the
FWER is equal or less than 0.05. The most common approach to do that is the Bonferroni
adjustment. This adjustment is an approximation, i.e. it drops below the 0.05-limit of FWER –
the more tests the lower is the FWER, e.g. for 10 independent test the Bonferroni-adjustment
leads to a FWER of 0.049. Thus, the Bonferroni adjustment is very conservative and becomes
more conservative with increasing number of tests.
Dependencies between the tests reduce the multiple effects, i.e. the Bonferroni adjustments
are even more conservative. In this case it is often difficult to describe the dependencies to
determine the correct appearance of multiple effects. We did a simulation study where we
tested the pairwise correlations of 10 independent variables (i.e. under null hypothesis) with
10,000 repetitions for 100 participants. We computed the relation between marginal
significance level and the FWER and obtained the following results:
Marginal level
0.0011
0.0024
0.0050

FWER
0.025
0.050
0.100

Type
Bonferroni for 45 tests
Optimal level for FWER=0.05
Level used in this study

These results show that the Bonferroni level is far too conservative while the optimal level is
lower than the one we used. The level we used leads to FWER of 0.1 – this matches exactly
the 0.1 level if one assumes one-sided tests (adjusted for correct multiple effects). One-sided
tests may be justified because previous studies did indicate likely directions of the correlations
we examined.
This simulation study applies to independent variables. However, there were correlated
variables in the data, e.g. between the psychological measures, which reduced the effects of
multiple testing. That is, the marginal level should be higher than the optimal level for
independent variables (0.0024).
Overall, the results of this simulation show that the marginal level used in this study provides
a reasonable compromise between possible over-adjustment and under-adjustment.
A.2 Power of the tests
With the sample size of 113, the marginal level of 0.005 translates for a single test to 80%
power for correlations of at least 0.34. Using the nominal 5% significance level, the same test
power of 80% would be reached for correlations of at least 0.26. The loss of power due to the
adjustment for multiplicity was therefore relatively modest. Test power was sufficient to
detect medium or larger correlations.
