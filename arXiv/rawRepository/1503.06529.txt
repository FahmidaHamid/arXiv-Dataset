Abstract. Molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments mostly work collectively
under opposing forces. This opposing force may be due to cargo carried by motors,
or resistance coming from cell membrane pressing against the cytoskeletal filaments.
Certain recent studies have shown that the collective maximum force (stall force)
generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or molecular motors may not always be
just a simple sum of stall force for individual filaments or motors. To understand
this phenomena of excess or deficit collective force generation, we study a broad class
of models of both cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors. We argue that the
stall force generated by a group of filaments or motors is additive, i.e., the stall
force of N filaments(motors) is N times the stall force of one filament (motor), when

the system is in equilibrium at stall. Consequently, we show that this additivity
typically does not hold when the system departs from equilibrium at stall. We thus
present a novel and unified understanding of existing models exhibiting such nonaddivity, and generalize our arguments by developing new models that demonstrate
this phenomena. We also propose a quantity similar to thermodynamic efficiency to
provide a simple understanding of deviation from stall-force additivity for filament and
motor collectives.

1. Introduction
Molecular motors, such as kinesin, dynein and myosin, and cytoskeletal filaments, such
as actin and microtubule, are abundantly present inside the cell [1]. Cytoskeletal
filaments give structural stability to the cell and act as tracks along which molecular
motors move and perform intra-cellular transport. Many researchers have studied
the dynamics of single filaments and motors in great details using experimental,
theoretical and computational tools [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. However, molecular motors
and cytoskeletal filaments mostly work collectively to perform their biological tasks.
For instance, dynamics of multiple actin filaments is responsible for lamellipodial
dynamics during crawling of cells [1, 8]. Similarly, microtubules work collectively to
bring about segregation of chromosomes during mitosis [9]. Also, many dynein motors
attach to molecular cargo and generate force for the purpose of cellular transportation,
whereas myosin motors work collectively to generate force in stress fibers and muscle
tissues [1, 10]. Hence, study of such systems, which are involved in a wide range of
biological processes, requires understanding of collective force generation by cytoskeletal
filaments and motors [7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
A well known technique to investigate the dynamics of cytoskeletal filaments is
to observe their growth and shrinkage kinetics against a resisting force [2]. One of
the important quantities, that is typically of interest to researchers, is the maximum
force generated by these filaments—the force at which the mean growth velocity of
the filaments is zero—and is referred in the literature as the stall force [11, 12]. It
had commonly been believed in the literature that the stall force of multiple, noninteracting, filaments, always scales linearly with the number of filaments [11, 12, 14, 19].
However, in recent studies, it has been demonstrated that, in many cases, there is
either enhanced or reduced co-operativity in the maximum force generated by multiple
growing filaments, i.e., the stall forces need not always scale with the number of growing
filaments. For example, recent theoretical studies [15, 20] on collective dynamics of
cytoskeletal filaments under a constant applied force have established that, the stall
forces of individual filaments are non-additive in general. This implies that the collective
(N )
stall force produced by N cytoskeletal filaments (denoted by fs ) is not a simple sum
(N )
(1)
of individual stall forces of single filaments, i.e., fs 6= Nfs .
Similar studies have also been done for molecular motors. The technique that is
mostly used to study molecular motor involves micro size dielectric particle and optical
tweezers [21]. A resisting force applied via this technique measures the force velocity
(N )
(1)
response of the motor. Interestingly, the non-additivity of stall forces (fs 6= Nfs )
has been shown by Campàs et al [16] for multiple processive motors, in the presence
of attractive/repulsive interactions. However, in absence of such interactions the stall
forces in this model are simply additive. In another paper on collective motor dynamics,
Casademunt and coworkers [17] have investigated the two state model [22] for multiple
motors with soft interactions, and also demonstrated that the motors can produce
enhanced co-operativity in stall force generation. Thus, for systems like multiple

Sufficient conditions for the additivity of stall forces

filaments or motors pushing against an obstacle, except under some special conditions
obeyed by the kinetic rate constants, stall forces are now known to be non-additive in
general. Hence, it would be both interesting and important to understand these special
conditions for which stall forces become simply additive, and consequently get better
insight into the circumstances under which the simple additivity is lost.
Although, many researchers have shown enhanced/reduced co-operativity in
stall force generation by multiple motors and filaments, all the studies are highly
context/model specific. In this paper, we develop a general framework to understand
why/how enhanced/reduced co-operativity in collective force generation occurs in
systems of multiple cytoskeletal filaments or motors—we investigate this question by
studying various models for these systems. From our case studies we conclude, quite
generally, that the violation of force-additivity at stall stems from the violation of the
condition of detailed balance, i.e. departure from equilibrium.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we present theoretical
(N )
(1)
arguments to show that the force-additivity fs = Nfs holds for simplest models for
motors and filaments, which necessarily exhibit equilibrium at stall. We then proceed to
investigate several non-equilibrium models of multiple filaments and motors in section 3,
(N )
(1)
and explicitly show that the relationship fs 6= Nfs is generally true when the system
at stall is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. We further demonstrate that simple
ideas from thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical mechanics can be utilized to get
insights into this co-operative behavior, without the necessity to perform a detailed
non-equilibrium calculation. In fact, we develop a thermodynamic and experimentally
tractable quantity α, that is very similar to commonly used thermodynamic efficiency
parameter, to predict the co-operative behavior of multiple filaments/motors. The main
ideas and conclusions are rounded up in the final section 4. We argue that the nonequilibrium state of a single filament (motor) at stall is reflected in the non-additivity of
stall forces when many such filaments (motors) work together. The main contribution
of this paper is to investigate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a variety
of models of multiple filament and motor dynamics, and recognise the hitherto invisible
thread of thermodynamic equilibrium linking their collective behavior at stall.
2. Collective stall force for multiple cytoskeletal filaments and motors :
stall forces are additive for equilibrium dynamics
Inspired by the growth of cytoskeletal filaments against cell membrane during cell
migration, many researchers have studied models of cytoskeletal filament growth and
shrinkage through addition/removal of monomers against a constant applied load
[11, 12, 15, 23, 24, 25]. Similar to the filaments, molecular motors also work against
load and have been modelled by many researchers [16, 17, 18, 26, 27]. Many of these
filament and motor models are mathematically very similar. However, a key difference
between filaments and motors is that the motors move on a one-dimensional track and
therefore cannot overtake each other (Fig. 1b), while in an assembly of multiple parallel

Sufficient conditions for the additivity of stall forces

5

filaments, the filament tips do overtake each other (Fig. 1a). In other words, the motors
follow sequential motion while the filaments follow parallel motion. Yet, we may discuss
the two problems of filaments and motors using a common simple picture as follows.
Single filament grows/shrinks by addition/removal of subunits of size d with rates u(f )
and w(f ), respectively (see Fig. 1a), under a constant applied force f . Similarly, a
motor moves forward/backward by a single step on a one-dimensional track of lattice
constant d, against a force f acting upon it (see Fig. 1b). The forward and backward
hopping rates of the motor under force are u(f ) and w(f ), respectively. Note that in
this paper we measure force in the units of kB T /d, where kB is the Boltzmann constant,
T is the temperature, and d is the subunit (lattice) size for filament (motor), which can
be taken as unity without losing generality. Motors follow mutual exclusion, i.e., the
occupancy of any lattice site, at any instant, can be either 1 or 0. On the other hand, in
the case of filaments, any number of filaments can be of the same length. Let us denote
the polymerization-rate (forward-hopping-rate) and depolymerization-rate (backwardhopping-rate) for filaments (motors) to be u and w, respectively, in the absence of any
force (u > w in general). In the presence of a constant force f , the polymerization rates
(forward-hopping-rate) decreases, and depolymerization-rate (backward-hopping-rate)
increases according to the following rules: u(f ) = ue−f δ and w(f ) = wef (1−δ) . Here,
the parameter δ ∈ [0, 1] is commonly known as force distribution factor [12]. Note that
polymerization and depolymerization (or forward and backward hopping) can be viewed
as barrier crossing processes from a valley to an adjacent one on a free energy landscape
(see Fig. 2). In such a representation, δ represents the position of the free energy barrier
with respect to the free energy minima.
By applying tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics, we first show that the stall
forces should be additive for multiple filaments in the simplest model, where only
polymerization and depolymerization processes are involved (see Fig. 1c). Let us first
consider a single filament at stall condition. By definition, the stall force is an applied
force, for which the average velocity of a single filament (motor) or a system of filaments
(or motors) becomes zero [12, 15, 16]. The stall force fsN of N filaments can also be
interpreted as the maximum force generated by the filaments, and consequently fsN d
is the maximum work that can be extracted from the filaments per subunit addition.
(1)
Now, consider the dynamics of a single filament under the stall force f = fs applied
via a rigid wall (Fig. 2a). Let the wall position be x in terms of the subunit size (see Fig.
2a). Since, the external force equals the stall force, the mean velocity of the filament is
zero. It is also immediately clear that the overall subunit flux in and out of the system
is also zero. Since both the velocity and the particle flux for the filament is zero, it
is logical to believe that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at stall. Hence,
using equilibrium statistical mechanics we can write the probability distribution of the
wall-position P (x) as follows

at any position x. As per Eq. 1, this implies that fs = ǫ = ln(u/w); same answer that
is obtained from a detailed kinetic calculation [12]. Next, consider a two-filament system
(2)
subjected to their stall force fs as shown in Fig. 2a. Since the system is at stall, the
mean velocity of the wall is zero, and, consequently, the mean subunit flux in and out
of the system is also zero—the system is thus is thermodynamic equilibrium. Let the
tip-position of the trailing filament be x1 , which is between 0 and the wall position x.
The probability distribution of the wall-position, since the system is in thermodynamic
equilibrium, is:

The factor of 2 appears on the right hand side, since there could be two equally likely
situations–either the top-filament or the bottom-filament can be the leader (see Fig.
2). As for a single filament at stall, P (x) is expected not to depend on x, implying
(2)
(1)
that fs = 2ǫ = 2fs . This argument can be easily extended to N > 2, and thus
(N )
(1)
fs = Nfs for this simple model. Arguments, based on detailed balance criterion,
(N )
have also been given in Refs. [11] and [13] to show similar result of fs ∝ N for their
respective models on cytoskeletal filaments. However, such a simple calculation for stall
force, based on elementary statistical mechanics, for an essentially kinetic process, is
provided for the first time for such models, to the best of our knowledge. As we will see
in the subsequent sections, this simple argument leads to major ramifications when the
system is not in equilibrium at stall.
We can also develop similar arguments to show the additivity of stall forces for
multiple motors. The forward/backward hopping processes for motors can be viewed as
random walk on a tilted free-energy landscape (see Fig.2b). In this case, x and x1 should
be interpreted as the positions of the leading and the trailing motors, respectively. The
free energy “released” per unit step by going downhill on the free-energy landscape is
ǫ (equivalent to the polymerization energy). For a single motor under stall force, we
can write a similar equation as before (Eq. 1) for the probability distribution of the
leading motor’s position, P (x), by recognizing the system to be in equilibrium at stall.
However, for two motors at stall, the probability distribution of the leader’s position is
somewhat different from the previous case of the filaments, as there is no overtaking in
the case of motors—the distribution is:

If we again use the logic that P (x) should be independent of x, we get back the

force additivity : fs = 2ǫ = 2fs . This argument hinges on the recognition that,
the stall condition for this simple model is equivalent to thermodynamic equilibrium,
which may not be true in many biological situations. As shown in the next sections,

the breakdown of thermodynamic equilibrium at stall for more complex models have
interesting implications.
3. Stall forces are non-additive for biologically relevant non-equilibrium
models
In this section, we present several case studies to show that the force inequality
(N )
(1)
(fs
6= Nfs ) is true in general for stall dynamics departing from equilibrium—
(N )
(1)
however, for certain combination of kinetic rates the relationship fs = Nfs indeed
holds. We begin by analyzing various models of cytoskeletal filaments.
3.1. Random hydrolysis model for multiple cytoskeletal filaments
In cytoskeletal filaments (such as, microtubules and actin filaments), subunits are
typically bound to ATP/GTP molecules. When they are connected to form cytoskeletal
filaments, these molecules release phosphate and convert their ATP/GTP to ADP/GDP
in a process is known as ATP/GTP hydrolysis [10, 1]. The ADP/GDP-bound monomers
have much higher depolymerization rates compared to ATP/GTP-bond monomers. Due
to this heterogeneity the cytoskeletal filaments exhibit interesting dynamical properties.
In literature, the dynamics of the cytoskeletal filaments have been theoretically studied
by many researchers using the “random hydrolysis” model [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Here,
we focus on the model discussed in Refs. [15, 30]. In Fig. 3, we show multiple
filaments undergoing random hydrolysis and growing against a wall held by a constant
opposing force f . In the model, each monomer can be in two states: T (ATP/GTPbound), and D (ADP/GDP-bound). Only T monomers bind to the filaments with a rate
u(f ) = uef (next to the wall) or u (away from the wall). The rate u is proportional to the
concentration (c) of T monomers, and can be written as u = k0 c. The depolymerization
occurs with a rate wT if the tip-monomer is T, and wD if it is D. For simplicity we
assume that there is no force dependence on the off-rates wT and wD (i.e. δ = 1).
Hydrolysis (T to D conversion) happens on any T subunit randomly in space with a
rate r. Note that the conversion T→D is irreversible, as it is not balanced by a reverse
conversion, which makes the dynamics inherently non-equilibrium. The exact analytical
(N )
result for the stall force fs is not known for such a detailed model even for N = 1. We
instead exactly simulate the model by kinetic Monte-Carlo using experimentally known
rates [10, 33, 34] for microtubules and actin filaments.
Before proceeding to discuss the issue of stall force additivity, let us first define a
parameter, the “force deviation”:
∆(N ) = fs(N ) − N fs(1)

(4)

This parameter represents the amount of excess/deficit of force generated by N filaments
collectively, compared to N times of force generated by a single filament. So the
(N )
(1)
deviation ∆(N ) 6= 0 would imply any violation of the force equality fs
= Nfs .

(1)

Infact, it is recently demonstrated in Ref. [15] that the relationship fs 6= Nfs holds,
in general, for the random hydrolysis model.
We note that, the random hydrolysis model is a non-equilibrium system by
construction. To understand the implications of this non-equilibrium nature, we
first look at the energetics associated with the polymerization/depolymerization
processes. A growing filament clearly performs work against an applied load f through
polymerization. The work done for addition of one subunit to the filament is simply
f d, where we can take subunit-size d = 1 without losing any generality. At the stall
(1)
force f = fs (i.e. when the average filament velocity v = 0), the filament delivers
(1)
max
the maximum work Wpoly
= fs . The free energy input to the filament in order to
do this work is provided by polymerisation and can be written as Fpoly = ln(u/wT ),
per subunit addition. Note that D monomers do not polymerize, and hence there is no
contribution in Fpoly due to D monomers. Finally we define the following quantity for
a single filament
max
α = Fpoly − Wpoly
= ln(u/wT ) − fs(1)

(5)

The quantity α signifies how different is the work produced per filament as compared
to the free energy input. Hence, α is analogous to the thermodynamic efficiency of the
system [35]. In Fig. 4a we plot the deviation ∆(2) for two microtubules, and α against the
dissociation rate wD of D monomers. Other parameters are taken from the experimental
literature [10, 34] (see the caption of Fig. 4). First of all, quite interestingly, ∆(2) and
α are correlated in sign. This gives us a hint that the violation of force additivity
has something to do with the imbalance between the work produced and free-energy
input (i.e. the departure from equilibrium). However, to appreciate the interconnection
between ∆(2) and α we first proceed to investigate the particle fluxes of the T and D
monomers.
We calculate the particle fluxes when the N-filament system is at stall (i.e. at
(N )
f = fs , when average wall velocity is zero). We perform this calculation for the

parameter values which give α > 0. In our simulations we separately keep track of the
numbers of T and D monomers binding (or unbinding) at a filament-tip in a N-filament
system. The flux JT for T monomers is then calculated over a time window. The flux
per filament is defined as the net change of T monomer numbers at any one filament-tip
divided by the size of the time window. Similarly, we calculate the flux (per filament) JD
for D monomers. In Fig. 4b we show these fluxes at stall. It can be seen that although
JT + JD = 0 (which is expected at stall), individually the JT and JD fluxes per filament
are non-zero signifying the non-equilibrium nature of the dynamics. Another important
point to note is that, the fluxes per filament, at stall, decreases with filament number
N and tend to saturate. The dependence of particle flux (JT or JD ) per filament with
N shows a trend that is very similar to that exhibited by the deviation parameter ∆(N ) .
From this observation, we are tempted to make a hypothesis that a non-equilibrium
system with large number of filaments is closer to “equilibrium” in comparison to a
(N )
single-filament system, and as the number of filament increases the value fs get closer
to “equilibrium” value of ln(u/wT ).
With the above hypothesis in hand, we now attempt to explain the sign correlation
between ∆(2) and α (Fig. 4a). First consider the case α > 0, when the single filament
system performs less work than the free-energy provided by the polymerization (for the
definition of α in this case, see Eq. 5), i.e., some energy is dissipated by the filament
due to the internal T→D transitions. However, as per our hypothesis, the two-filament
system is closer to equilibrium as compared to a single-filament. As a result, the twofilament system can extract more work by increasing the stall force per filament (see
Fig. 4c, data shown for α > 0)—in Fig. 4c, we clearly see that the stall force per
(N )
(N )
(1)
filament fs /N indeed increases with N for α > 0 (i.e. fs /N > fs
∀ N > 1 ),
and saturates near the net free-energy input (see the horizontal line corresponding to

11

(2)

(1)

ln(u/wT ) in Fig. 4c). This increase in stall force per filament makes fs /2 > fs and
in return gives positive ∆(2) . Thus, the α > 0 case correlates with ∆(2) > 0. Similar
arguments can be given for the other case of α < 0 (see Fig. 4c), where the single
filament system performs more work than the energy provided by polymerization. To
bring the system closer to equilibrium, two-filament system decreases the stall force per
(N )
(1)
filament (fs /N < fs ). Hence, ∆(2) is negative if α < 0.
An interesting point to note in Fig. 4a is that both ∆(2) and α are zero exactly
at wT = wD . This shows that T→D switching (hydrolysis) is necessary to produce the
phenomenon of non-additivity of stall forces. Note that the hydrolysis process is always
non-equilibrium in nature as it is unidirectional; T→D conversion is never balanced by
a reverse conversion. However, the condition wT = wD effectively corresponds to lack
of switching, since dynamically there remains no distinction between T and D subunits.
The filaments cannot “sense” their distinct presence as far as the force generation is
concerned. Yet, the condition wT = wD does not imply a true equilibrium until we
set the T→D switching rate to zero. Another way to possibly achieve equilibrium
at stall is to incorporate the reverse switching (D→T) and allow polymerization of D
subunits. Although these additions are biologically unrealistic, we nevertheless study
such a model in the next section to explore the relevance of non-equilibrium dynamics
for non-additivity of the stall forces.
3.2. A generalized random hydrolysis model
We make the random hydrolysis model (discussed in the last section 3.1) more general
and symmetric by allowing (i) D → T conversion, and (ii) addition of both D and T
monomers. In the model (see Fig. 5a) both T and D subunits can bind with constant
rates uT and uD , respectively. When the filaments come in contact with the wall (see
Fig. 5a), the polymerization rates modify to uT (f ) = uT e−f and uD (f ) = uD e−f in
the presence of force f (using the load distribution factor δ = 1 for simplicity). The
depolymerization occurs with a rate wT if the tip-monomer is T, or wD if it is D. Any
randomly chosen subunit inside a filament can convert either from T to D (with rate
kT D ), or from D to T (with rate kDT ).
Within the general version of the random hydrolysis model, we now proceed to show
that the two-way switching (T → D, and D → T) in general produces non-equilibrium
dynamics that is embodied in the violation of the condition of detailed balance for
the kinetic rates. For a single filament, as shown in Fig. 5b, we consider a loop of
dynamically connected configurations. The product of clockwise and anticlockwise rates
are uT kT D wD and uD kDT wT , respectively. For the condition of detailed balance, i.e.,
equilibrium, to be reached at steady state, the two products must be equal according to
the Kolmogorov’s criterion [36, 37] (or the Wegschieder condition [38]), which leads to

6). Though this criteria is written in terms of force-free rates, it is clear that using
the modified rates in the presence of resisting force would not change the Kolmogorov
(2)
(1)
criterion for these rates. We now plot the deviation ∆(2) = fs − 2fs versus uT in
Fig. 6–see the red curve (data from stochastic simulation). The plot quite interestingly
shows that ∆(2) = 0 only at uT = 8s−1 ; otherwise it is nonzero. This clearly indicates
that the phenomenon of non-additivity of stall forces is tied to the departure of the
system from equilibrium. This can be compared with the arguments given in section
2, where it is shown that for cytoskeletal filament models involving no switching, and
(N )
(1)
which always exhibit equilibrium at stall, the relationship fs = Nfs holds without
any restriction.

We now relate the non-equilibrium effect of the force non-additivity with the
imbalance between the free energy input and maximum work output (see section 3.1).

Since, in this case, at any instant filament can grow by addition of any of D or
T monomer, the free energy input of the system should depend on both T and D
polymerization energy. Partition function of the model is eǫT + eǫD (using kB T =
1), where ǫT and ǫd are polymerization energies provided by T and D monomers,
respectively. Hence, the free energy input to the filament is Fpoly = ln[eǫT + eǫT ] =
(1)
ln[(uT /wT ) + (uD /wD )]; the maximum work done by the filament is simply fs (using
subunit size d = 1). As derived in the previous section 3.1, we now define the following
efficiency-like parameter for this model:
max
α = Fpoly − Wpoly
= ln[(uT /wT ) + (uD /wD )] − fs(1)

(7)

We see from Fig. 6 that both α and ∆(2) are correlated in sign, and they are nonzero every where except for a single point where the system is in equilibrium at stall
(according to Eq. 6). With this understanding of the relationship between the nonequilibrium dynamics and non-additivity of stall forces, we now proceed to discuss
another model from literature which is studied [15] in the context of collective force
generation.
3.3. A toy model for cytoskeletal filaments
In this subsection we analyze a toy model introduced in Ref. [15]. In this model (Fig.7a),
each filament can switch between two chemical states 1 and 2, with switching rates
k12 (from 1 to 2), and k21 (from 2 to 1). In the states 1 and 2, the filament has
distinct depolymerization rates w1 and w2 , respectively, and polymerization rates of u1
and u2 , respectively (see Fig. 7a). As an aside, we point out that this generalized
model for a single filament is very similar to the switching model for microtubule
dynamics introduced in Ref. [4]. If a filament bears the load (i.e. touches the wall), its
polymerization rate is modified to ui (f ) = ui e−f (i = 1, 2). For simplicity, we assume
that the depolymerization rates are force independent.
Within the general version of the toy model, we first explicitly show that the stall
dynamics is indeed non-equilibrium. For a single filament, as shown in Fig. 7b, we
again consider a loop of connected configurations characterized by its length and state.
In this case, Kolmogorov’s criterion reduces to

Following the procedure involving microscopic Master equations, as described in Ref.

[15], we analytically get the single-filament and two-filament stall forces (fs , fs )
In Fig. 8, we plot ∆(2) against u2 (red curve) with fixed w1 = 0.1s−1 , u1 = 1s−1 ,
and w2 = 0.8s−1 —we find that ∆(2) 6= 0 for all u2 , except for u2 = 8s−1 (the value
corresponding to the equality in Eq. 8). This shows that the phenomenon of nonadditivity of stall forces is indeed tied to the departure from equilibrium.
In the toy model, ln(ui /wi ) is the polymerization free energy in state i = (1, 2).
Hence, if Pi is the probability of finding a filament in state i, then at any instant the

amount of free energy that is transferred from the bath of monomers to the filament
upon addition of monomer type 1 or 2 is given by Fpoly = P1 ln(u1 /w1 ) + P2 ln(u2 /w2 ).
On the other hand, the maximum amount of work done by a filament against the applied
(1)
force is W max = fs (assuming monomer size d = 1). Hence, as defined in the previous
sections, we can again define an efficiency parameter as:
α = Fpoly − W max = [P1 ln(u1 /w1) + P2 ln(u2 /w2 )] − fs(1) ,

(9)

where, P1 = k21 /(k12 + k21 ) and P2 = k12 /(k12 + k21 ) — this follows from the fact that
the detailed balance relation P1 k12 = P2 k21 holds at the steady state for the singlefilament toy model as shown in [15] (also intuitively evident from Fig. 7a), along with
the normalization condition P1 + P2 = 1. In Fig. 8, we plot α versus u2 (blue curve).
We see that ∆(2) is closely coupled to α in numerical sign, and both are nonzero expect
at the point where equilibrium condition (Eq. 8) is satisfied.
The phenomenon of non-additivity of stall forces is not specific to cytoskeletal

filaments, even the system of multiple molecular motors can show such behavior [16].
As we describe below, the connection of this phenomenon with the non-equilibrium
dynamics can also be established in systems of motors.
3.4. Model of interacting motors by Campàs et al.
A model of multiple interacting motors pushing against a load has been proposed by
Campàs et al. [16] (Fig. 9a). In the model, motors walk along a 1-dimensional lattice
(lattice spacing d = 1) and move by a single step forward (rate u) or backward (rate w).
There is hard core interaction between the motors. The leading motor alone bears the
load, and hence its hopping rates are modified to u(f ) = ue−fδ , and w(f ) = wef(1−δ) ,
where δ is the force distribution factor. The hopping rates change due to nearestneighbor interactions — if a motor is adjacent to another one, its forward and backward
hopping rates become ū and w̄, respectively (see Fig. 9a).

(b) Schematic depiction of a closed loop of dynamically connected configurations for the

From analytical calculations and numerical simulations, the authors found that the
stall forces are not necessarily additive. We show here that the non-additivity is a
manifestation of the non-equilibrium nature of the dynamics. To show this we again
apply the Kolmogorov criterion, by making a closed loop of connected configurations as
shown in Fig. 9b. By equating the clockwise and counter-clockwise products of rates
along the loop, we have

This corroborates our hypothesis that the additivity of stall forces is closely linked with
the underlying equilibrium of the system, a point not recognized in Ref. [16].

Figure 11: Motors walking on a free-energy landscape [16]. The effect of nearest neighbor
interactions is shown schematically.
We can also obtain the condition of equilibrium (Eq. 10) from a simple equilibrium
thermodynamic argument by considering the hopping processes of the motors on a freeenergy landscape (see Fig. 11). Due to the nearest neighbor interactions, the shape
of the free energy landscape alters when the motors are adjacent to each other. An
attractive interaction deepens the energy wells by an amount eint (dotted blue curve
in Fig. 11), and makes it harder for the particles to leave the position. This reduces
the forward and backward hopping rates. On the other hand, the repulsive interaction
makes the potential wells shallower (dotted red curve in Fig. 11), which makes it easy for
the particles to hop forward or backward. In this case, hopping rates increase from the
original values. Following Fig. 11, we write following equations for the hopping rates,

3.5. A motor model with multiple step-sizes
Recently, it is shown in Refs. [6, 21] that dynein motors on a microtubule can take
multiple step sizes – predominantly 24-nm and 32-nm steps. This inspired us to cast a
new model of motors walking with two step sizes (see Fig. 12a). The motors walk along
a 1-dimensional lattice (lattice spacing d = 1). A motor at a lattice site i can hop to
any of the sites i + 1 (with rate u1 ), i + 2 (with rate u2 ), i − 1 (with rate w1 ), and i − 2
(with rate w2 ). The leading motor alone bears the applied force f and its forward rates
are modified to u1 (f ) = u1 e−f and u2 (f ) = u2 e−2f , while backward rates are assumed
to be force-independent (load distribution factor δ = 1). Unlike in the previous case
(Section 3.4) there is no explicit attractive or repulsive interaction between the motors.
Proceeding in a similar way as described in the previous sections 3.2 and 3.3, we
first of all derive the condition for equilibrium, by considering a closed loop of connected
configurations as shown in Fig. 12b. Following Kolmogorov criterion we get

If we take u1 = 80s−1 , w1 = 8s−1 , and w2 = 1s−1 , then u2 = 100s−1 is the value
corresponding to the equilibrium (see Eq. 14). In Fig. 13, ∆(2) versus u2 is plotted
(the red curve) from our simulation results, where we indeed see that ∆(2) = 0 only for

for the motor-model with two step sizes. The parameters are u1 = 80s−1 , w1 = 8s−1 ,
and w2 = 1s−1 .
We would now show that the effect of force-additivity for motors is related to the
underlying energetic imbalance, like the models of cytoskeletal filaments discussed in
the previous sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. The motor model with multiple step-size model
looks conceptually similar to generalized random hydrolysis model—at any instant, a
filament can grow by addition of T or D monomer in generalized random hydrolysis
model, whereas in motor with multiple step-size model a motor can move forward by
taking step of size d or 2d. However, in the current model, taking a step of size d or 2d
involves change in work done by motor, unlike the generalized random hydrolysis model
(1)
where addition of D or T monomer leads to extraction of the same work (fs d). Hence,
for α (thermodynamic efficiency) definition, we only take into account energy imbalance
that results by the motor taking step of size d. For a step of unit lattice size, we can
write the free-energy supplied by ATP molecules as F = ln(u1 /w1 ) and the maximum
(1)
work done as W max = fs (considering the lattice size d = 1). Thus, we may define an
efficiency-like quantity
α = F − W max = ln(u1 /w1 ) − fs(1) .

(15)

We do not claim that this is a unique α which can be defined for this system. One may
certainly come up with some other definition for α, for example,
u2
1
− 2fs(1) ),
(16)
α = (ln
2
w2
to quantify excess/deficit energy supplied to the system per step—both these definition
of α (Eqs. 15 and 16) essentially capture the energy imbalance per unit step.
We plot α (from Eq. 15) and ∆(2) versus u2 in Fig. 13, and we see that both α and
∆(2) are indeed correlated in sign—both are zero only for the equilibrium condition (Eq.
14). The same finding can be obtained by using Eq. 16 for α instead of Eq. 15 (data

not shown). This further strengthens our point that the phenomenon of non-additivity
of stall forces is a manifestation of underlying non-equilibrium stall dynamics.
4. Discussion and conclusion
Collective force generation by filaments/motors has theoretically been studied by many
researchers for various models in specific contexts [11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20]. However,
a broad picture explaining the cooperative effects in stall force generation is still missing.
In this paper, we have addressed this problem in a more general manner. We have
provided a theoretical frame-work to understand and predict the co-operative effect in
the maximum force generation by multiple motors or filaments for a broad class of
models. It is now known [15, 16] that the stall force of individual cytoskeletal filaments
or molecular motors, when they push together against some obstacle, is not additive
in general. In this paper, we have established the fact that the non-additivity of the
(N )
(1)
stall forces (fs 6= Nfs ) is a manifestation of the underlying non-equilibrium nature
of the stall dynamics. We have first shown theoretically that the individual stall forces
are expected to be additive for equilibrium dynamics. We have then compared this
with various models of multiple filaments and motors, that depart from equilibrium
(captured in the violation of the detailed balance condition). By using the Kolmogorov
criterion [36, 37], we have systematically derived the conditions that must be obeyed
by the kinetic rates if the systems are expected to be in equilibrium at stall. We have
shown that when these conditions are violated, one usually gets the force inequality
(N )
(1)
(N )
(1)
fs 6= Nfs . On the other hand, one gets fs = Nfs , when the balance conditions
are satisfied.
Our study suggests that if the Kolmogrov criteria for kinetic rates is satisfied
then one does not need a detailed non-equilibrium calculation to obtain the stall
force of multiple filaments/motors. The same result can be established using a simple
equilibrium statistical mechanics calculation. Moreover, even if the Kolmogrov criterion
for kinetic rates is not satisfied for a problem, our thermodynamic quantity α, at
least qualitatively, predicts if the co-operative effects in the stall force for multiple
motors/filaments is either enhanced or decreased as one increases the number of the
filaments/motors. For a class of models discussed in this paper, we clearly see a
correlation between the numerical signs of α and the deviation ∆(2) . Although we
do not have a rigorous understanding of why lack of equilibrium by-and-large leads
to non-additivity of stall forces. However, we provide an intuitive argument based
on our calculation of monomer flux per filament as a function of total number of
filaments (see section 3.1). We have seen from our simulations that this flux per
filament, which is a signature of the lack of equilibrium, decreases with the number
of filaments. Hence, we make a hypothesis that the system is “pulled” towards
“statistical equilibrium” as the number of filaments increase. In addition to doing
detailed case studies, we provide understanding of existing results on co-operativity of
multiple motors and filaments [16, 15]. To give a concrete example from the existing

20

(N )

(1)

literature, the results of Ref. [16] on two state motor model [17, 22] show fs 6= Nfs .
Our analysis clearly indicates the same without the need for any detailed simulation
or theoretical calculations. We note that, the violation of detailed balance in the
transition rates between states-1 and 2, is a requirement for spontaneous motion in
this two state Brownian ratchet model(see Fig. 14(a)). As a result, even for a single
motor at stall, although the mean velocity flux of the motor is zero, the individual
velocity fluxes in states-1 and 2 (with potentials U1 and U2 , respectively) for the motor
are not independently zero. This non-equilibrium condition at stall for one motor is

manifested in the form of non-additivity of stall force in the presence of multiple, self(N )
(1)
excluding motors, i.e., fs 6= Nfs . Interestingly, the discrete version of this two state
model [39, 40], shows perfect additivity of stall forces for multiple motors with only
self-inclusion interactions (see Fig. 14(b)). This results from the fact that the discrete
model for a single motor can easily be mapped to a biased random walk with only one
track, which implies that at stall the motor can be interpreted to be in “equilibrium.” As
an interesting aside, we note that a recent experiment [41] on molecular motor dynein
presumes stall force force additivity to infer the number of motors on the cargo. Our
analysis, not only suggests that one has to exhibit appropriate caution due to the possible
non-additivity of stall forces, but can also serve as a reasonable guide for preliminary
interpretation of such experimental data before performing additional detailed analysis.
The main thesis of our paper is that if a system of molecular motors or filaments
is not in equilibrium at stall we can expect co-operativity in the force generation,
even in the absence of any “attractive” or “repulsive” interactions between individual
components. This essentially is a new understanding, yet unreported in the literature.
To establish this with reasonable certainty, we have analyzed, multiple, seemingly

Sufficient conditions for the additivity of stall forces

21

disparate models which, nevertheless, exhibit a common theme of non-equilibrium stall
dynamics that leads to this co-operativity.
