Abstract:Because of permanent use-dependent brain plasticity, all lifelong individuals’
experiences are believed to influence the cognitive aging quality. In older individuals, both
former and current musical practices have been associated with better verbal skills, visual
memory, processing speed, and planning function. This work sought for an interaction
between musical practice and cognitive aging by comparing musician and nonmusician
individuals for two lifetimeperiods (middle and late adulthood). Long-term memory, auditoryverbal short-term memory, processing speed, nonverbal reasoning, and verbal fluencies were
assessed. In Study 1, measures of processing speed and auditory-verbal short-term
memoryweresignificantly better performedby musicians compared with controls, but both
groups displayed the same age-related differences. For verbal fluencies, musiciansscored
higherthan controls and displayeddifferent age effects.In Study2, wefoundthat lifetime period
at training onset (childhood vs.adulthood) was associated with phonemic, but not semantic,
fluencyperformances (musicians who had started to practice in adulthood did not perform
better on phonemic fluency than nonmusicians). Current frequency of training did not account
for musicians’ scores on either of these two measures. These patterns of results are discussed
by settingthe hypothesis of a transformative effect of musical practiceagainst a noncausal
explanation.
Keywords:cognitive aging, brain reserve, musical practice, cognitive transfer, verbal
functions
1. Introduction
Normal brainand cognitive aging are challenging to study, as advancing age is often
associated with various pathologies that compromise cognition. However, there are
accumulating evidences suggesting that, even in pathology-free conditions, normal aging is
associated with changes in the neural basis of cognition (Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004;
Kalpouzos et al., 2009). Cognitive functions are disproportionally impacted by aging, the
earliest and most concerned are processing speed, working memory, spatial ability, reasoning,
and long-term memory (Salthouse, 2010; Hedden and Gabrieli, 2004). By contrast, measures
of semantic knowledge and verbal abilities are relatively stable across the lifespan (Park,
2002).
Studies have reported that the brain retains its dynamic properties in aging, with structural and
functional rearrangements allowing for new learning and skills improvements (Draganski and
May, 2008). It has been suggested that all lifelong environmental features and demands
contribute to the establishment of a cognitive reserve,thereby partly counteractingthe agerelatedcognitive decline (Foubert-Samier et al., 2010). Therefore, besides genetic dispositions,
both former and current individuals’ experiences mayinfluence the quality of cognitive aging
(Hultsch et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2005; Stern, 2012), raising hopes for therapeutic
interventions and/or daily lifestyle recommendations (Green and Bavelier,
2008).Epidemiological works have shown that, in addition to education (Evans et al., 1993)
and occupational activity (Adam et al., 2013), the degree of individuals’ engagement in
leisure activities covaries with cognitive functioning in old age (Wang et al., 2012). For
instance, Christensen and Mackinnon (1993) found a positive statistical link between mental,
social, and physical activities and the cognitive performances of a large sample of participants
aged 70-89 years. Longitudinal studies have confirmed that practicing leisure activities in
later life is linked to increases in cognitive reserve (Schooler and Mulatu, 2001).
Regarding musical practice,cross-sectional worksin children and young adults have reported
an association with better performances across a wide range of cognitive domains.Individuals

who practice music in their spare time have been found to significantly outperformmatched
nonmusicianson verbal memory (Chan et al., 1998; Brandler and Rammsayer, 2003; Ho et al.,
2003; Franklin et al., 2008; Jakobson et al., 2008), vocabulary (Forgeard et al., 2008), spatial
ability (Brochard et al., 2004), nonverbal reasoning (Forgeard et al., 2008), short-term
memory (Huntsinger and Jose, 1991; Tierney et al., 2008), and working memory (Franklin et
al., 2008).
It has been hypothesized that music traininghas transformative effects on specific cognitive
functions because they sharemechanisms (e.g. auditory processes involved both in music and
in language; Patel and Iversen, 1997; Fauvel et al., 2013). Another claim is that music lessons,
being scholar-like activities, instead of leading to specific cognitive improvements, result in a
small general gain in Intelligent Quotient (IQ; Schellenberg, 2004), possiblythrough the
potentiation of executive functions (Hannon and Trainor, 2007; Schellenberg and Peretz,
2008; but see Schellenberg, 2011).
However,environmental factors influencing human cognition are challenging to study as well,
and previous positive results from quasi-experimental studies should be interpreted with
caution regarding the direction of the causality (e.g.high-functioning people are more likely to
takemusic lessons; Schellenberg, 2011). Moreover, a recent well-controlled (random
assignment) longitudinal study observed that visual art or music preschool instruction did not
influence children’s cognitive development (Mehr et al., 2013).
In seeking for potential factors that could promote successful cognitive aging, crosssectionalstudies have revealed that both past and recent musical training are associated with
better cognitive performances in later life (Hanna-Pladdy and MacKay, 2011; Hanna-Pladdy
and Gajewski, 2012). Astudy conducted in older musicians (60-83 years) with two levels of
expertise (high activity (>10 years) versus low activity(<10 years) found that they scored
higher than nonmusicians on the delayed recall of a geometric shape (visual long-term
memory), a verbal naming task, and Parts A and B of the Trail Making Test (TMT A and B),
which measures processing speed (Hanna-Pladdy and MacKay, 2011).Although the
performances of the low-activity musicians were halfway between those of the controlsand
high-activity musicians, suggesting a causal explanation,the differences were not significant.
Moreover,those musicians who were still actively engaged in music at the time of the study
did not perform better than those who had ceased.
In another study (Hanna-Pladdy and Gajewski, 2012) where general lifestyle activities were
controlled for, findings were replicated for visuospatial judgment, verbal memory, verbal
working memory, planning functions (nonmusicians made more rule violations in an
executive function-related task), and phonemic fluency. Statistical analyses revealed that the
musicians’ visuospatial abilitywas predicted by recent musical engagement, whereas auditoryverbal memory seemed to be influenced by the early age of musical acquisition. The authors
suggested that it could reflect differences in use-dependent adaptation periods depending on
cognitive domain.

2. Issues
In their investigation of the association between musical practice and late-life cognition,
already published workshave focused on musicians who started their training around 10 years
old, whilequasi-experimentally manipulating the current engagement (active vs.inactive), and
by implication, the total duration of training (more or less than 10 years; Hanna-Pladdy and

MacKay, 2011; Hanna-Pladdy and Gajewski, 2012). Therefore, the question of whether old
musicianswho started practicing musicin adulthood also display better cognitive performances
remains unanswered.
Moreover, any differences uncovered by comparing musicians and nonmusiciansat a single
point in time are of a quantitative nature, and do not inform about the cognitive aging quality
of these two populations (i.e., is musical practice associated with better performances in old
ageandweaker cognitive decline).
The first aim of the present work was to confirm that individuals practicing music since
childhood display better cognitive performances thannonmusicians. Then, we wantedto
explore whether these two populationsdiffer in terms of aging-related performances evolution.
Finally, we looked at whether two different characteristics of practice (age at training onset
and current frequency of training) account for older musicians.
Indeed, in the perspectivethat musical training influences the aging of cognitive abilities by
stimulating them, we hypothesized that:
(i)
Some tests’ results would be higher in musically-trained participantsanddisplay
weaker age-related differences between middle-aged and older participants
compared with nonmusicians.
(ii)
For cognitive functions displaying this pattern, at least one of the two
characteristics of musical practice (age at onset and/or current frequency of
training) would be associated with the musicians’ performances.
Therefore, in Study1, we assessed several cognitive functions in middle-aged and older
musicians(all having started in childhood), and compared their cognitive
performances,together with the age-dependent differences, with those of middle-aged and
older nonmusicians (cf. Fig. 1).
In Study 2, we wanted to explore whether two variables of practice (i.e. lifetime period at
training onset and current frequency of training) could explain the oldermusicians’higher
scores. We thereforeincluded a sample of older individuals who had started musiclater in life
(meanage at training onset =42.7 years,SD=11), andmeasured their cognitive performances on
tests having revealed significant interactions in Study1. In addition, we rana
correlationanalysis between these test scores and all the older musicians’ current frequency of
training.

3. Study 1:Material and methods
3.1. Participants
This study was made according to the ethical recommendations of Helsinki agreements for
human researches and cognitive investigations. Sixty-eight individuals were included.All
were informed about the study’s details and gave their consent for participation.
Thirty-four were amateur musicians recruited from several French conservatories or music
schools (no self-educated musicians were included). They were required to have an
uninterrupted time of practice of at least 4 years at the time of the study, and for a frequency
of training of more than 2 hours a week during the last 6 months. To make sure that the
musicians had an “active” practice, rather than a routinized one, a further inclusion
requirement was that they had tohave learned at least two new music pieces in the course of
the previous year. They played various musical instruments (piano, guitar, trumpet,

etc.).Overall, the mean training duration was 38.12 years (SD=17.7), with a mean age at
training onset of 9.54 years (SD=4.14), and a frequency of current training of 12.6 hours per
week (SD=10.7) (cf. Table 1). This sample was divided into a middle-aged group(19
participants, meanage =40.7 years,SD=9.6, min.=21, max.=55) and an oldergroup (15
participants, meanage =67.1 years,SD=5.2, min.=60, max.=78).
The 34 control participants were recruited from the general population. This sample was also
divided into a middle-aged group (14 participants, meanage =38.86 years,SD=15.9, min.=22,
max.=55) and an oldergroup (20 participants, meanage = 67 years,SD=4.4, min.=60,
max.=79) (cf. Table 1).
The cut-off ages (middle-aged≤55-60≤older) were chosen because of works showing that
cognitive performances fall significantly below the mean of the general population at around
this age (Salthouse, 2010).
All participants were given a semi-structured questionnaire that had been specially designed
for the study in order to rate demographic data (gender, age, education and occupation) (cf.
Table 1). The stimulating quality of the participants' occupations was rated as follows: a value
of 1 was attributed for jobless individuals; 2 for manual workers; 3 for office workers, publicsector workers, tradespeople, and storekeepers;4 for the self-employed, executive managers,
and students; and 5 for physicians and company directors. The musicians were also asked to
evaluate their age at training onset, and its average frequency for the last 6 months. Based on
this questionnaire, the groups of participants were matched on gender, age, education, and
occupational level. Moreover, middle-aged and older musician groups differed only
marginally on age at training onset as well as frequency of practice (cf. Table 1).

3.2. Neuropsychological assessment
The neuropsychological assessment was made of 8 tests that are classically used in a clinical
context (cf. Table 2). The entire test battery was administered in a single session which lasted
about 90 minutes, and took place in a quiet room conducive to concentration. As the whole
recruitment extended through 3 years and was shared between master’s degree students in
psychology, eight different experimenters were trained to run the tests in the most possible
standardized form. In line with previous studies in the field, we focused on 6 cognitive
domains(cf. Table 2).
We probed the verbal component of long-term memory using the delayed free recall of the 12
words from the Signoret BEM-144 (Signoret, 1991) (1). This testistaken from the French
Batterie d’Efficience Mnésique, and requires participants to recall verbal information after a
delay of approximately 7 min. Long-term memory’s visual component was assessed by
combining the two versions of Baddeley’s Doors test (Baddeley et al., 1994), and with the
delayed recall of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (Rey, 1959) (2). These two tests asked
respectively to recognize 12 previously encoded pictures of doors, and to redraw an abstract
geometrical shape copied approximately 3 min earlier. They are both standardized tests of
visual memory with good face validity and available normative data. Auditory-verbal shortterm memory was evaluated using the size of the forward digit span (Godefroy et al., 2008)

(3),which requires participants toimmediately recall the highest number of digits in the order
they were presented. This task is also part of the Wechsler Adult IntelligenceScale-Third
Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 2000). Processing speed was measured with the digit-symbol
coding subtest of the WAIS-III (Wechsler, 2000), and withthe number of items processed in
the d2 test (Brickenkamp, 1981) (4). In these two tests, the subject is asked to associate or to
discriminate visual stimuli as quickly as possible.The digit-symbol codingis part of the
WAIS-III (Wechsler, 2000), and the d2 test is a valid measure of attention and processing
speed based on German and American normative samples. The d2 is a time-restricted penciland-paper test that asks participants to cross out as many letter “d”s with two marks above or
below them, in any order. The surrounding distractors are relatively similar to the target
stimulus (a “p” with two marks or a “d” with one or three marks).We administered the
nonverbal Raven’s progressive matrices test (Wechsler, 2000)to estimateparticipants’
nonverbal reasoning skills. This test is also a good proxy forSpearman’s general intelligence
(g) factor (5).In this test, participants are presented with an unfinished matrix of drawings, and
have to choose which of the proposed answers logically completes the
matrix.Finally(6),phonemic and semantic verbal fluency tasks (Cardebat et al. 1990) were
administered to assess participants’ verbal functions. These time-restricted tasks ask to recite
as many wordsbeginning with a given letter (phonemic) or belonging to a given semantic
category (semantic) as possible. They are frequently used to assess cognition after
neurological damage (Henry and Phillips, 2006). Performances on these tests can be improved
by applyingstrategies(clustering by- and switching between- phonemic or semantic word
categories).

All the statistical analyses were performed with STATISTICA software
(StatSoft,(2011).STATISTICA (data analyses software), 10th version www.statsoft.fr).The
weakest significance threshold was set at p=.05,uncorrected for multiple comparisons.
Twochi-squaretests of independence were run to attest that the musician and nonmusician
groups did not differ significantly in gender frequencies. The first compared all four groups
(middle-aged controls, middle-aged musicians, older controls, and older musicians), and the
second tested themusician and nonmusician groups, collapsed across age (cf. Table 1).
Twoanalyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to attest that the four groups did not
differ significantly on education and occupation level (cf. Table 1). For these variables, we
also ran two ttests, where themusician and nonmusician groups were collapsed across age.
Moreover, two-sample ttests were run to confirm that there was no statistical difference in age
between the middle-aged musicians and nonmusicians, and the older musicians and
nonmusicians. Finally, two-sample ttests were run on the middle-aged and older musicians’
age at training onset and frequency of training (cf. Table 1).
For informative purposes, a correlation analysis was performed between all the outcome
measures (cognitive scores) of all the participants (cf. Table 3).
To seek for between-group differences regarding cognitive performances, we designed twoway ANOVAs specifying each cognitive score as the dependent variable, and age (middleaged vs.older) and group (musiciansvs.nonmusicians) as independent factors. Each time, the
two-way ANOVAs tested for the main effects of group and age, as well as for the Age*Group
interaction effect (cf. Table 4).

4. Study 1: Results
4.1. Demographic matching
Thetwo chi-squaretests of independence showed that the four groups did not differ on gender
frequencies(χ² (3,N=68) =2.15,p=.54), and nor didthe musician and nonmusician groups
collapsed across age,(χ²(1, N= 68) =2.15,p=.14).
No significant difference was revealed by the ANOVAs run on the meanyears of education (F
(3, 64)=1.29,p=.28), and professional occupation stimulating quality (F (3, 64)=2.19,p=.1).
There was also no significant difference when comparing the musician and nonmusician
groups (collapsed across age) on professional occupations(t (66)=1.26,p=.21), but the
musicians tendedto be more highly educated than the nonmusicians (t (66)=1.76,p=.08).
Ttests confirmed that there was no difference in age between musicians and nonmusicians, be
theymiddle-aged (t (31)=.48,p=.63), or older(t (33)=-.09,p=.93).
Finally,ttests comparing the middle-aged and older musicianson frequency of training (t
(32)=1.71,p=.1), and age at onset of practice (t(32)=-1.84,p=.07),revealedtrendstoward
significance, as the middle-aged musicians tended to have started musical training earlier and
to have practiced more frequently than the older musicians (p≤.1).

4.2. Between-group differences in the age effect on cognition
To explore whether musical practice interacted with the age effect, each cognitive score was
entered in a two-way ANOVA, with group and age as explanatory variables (cf. Table 4).

4.2.1. Verbal long-term memory
The delayed recall of the 12 words taken from the BEM-144 yielded no main effect of either
group, (F(1, 64)=.69,p=.41), or age, (F(1, 64)=.005,p=.94), and no interaction effect (F(1,

interaction(F(1, 64)=2.2,p=.14).

4.2.5.Processing speed
Performances on the digit-symbol codingtest showed no significant group effect (F(1,
64)=1.98,p=.16); a significant “age” effect (F(1, 64)=30.3; p<.001); and no significant
interaction (F(1, 64)=.88,p=.35).
Regarding the d2 test, analysis revealed significant effects of group, (F(1, 64)=6.7,p<.05), and
age (F(1, 64)=4.1,p< .05), but no significant interaction effect (F(1, 64)=1.93,p=.17).
4.2.6. Verbal fluencies

The number of words provided duringthe phonemic fluency task showed a significant effect
of group (F(1, 64)=17.9,p<.001), no age effect (F(1, 64)=1.83,p=.18), and a significant
interaction effect (F(1, 64)=4,p<.05).
Posthoc analysis showed that the middle-aged and older controls had very similar
performances (p=.5), whereas theolder musicians performed significantly better than the
middle-aged musicians (p<.05). It resulted in a difference in performances between the older
musicians and nonmusicians(p<.001). The performances of the middle-aged musicians and
nonmusicians were the same (p=.18) (cf. Fig. 2).
Regarding semantic fluency, the two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of group
(F(1, 64)=4.19,p<.05), no effect of age (F(1, 64)=.18,p=.67), and a significant interaction
(F(1, 64)=4.67,p<.05).
Posthoc analysis revealed that the older controls tended to perform worse than their middleaged counterparts (p=.07), but there was no difference betweenthe older and middle-aged
musicians (p=.22). Again, there was a significant difference between older controls and older
musicians (p<.01); and no difference between middle-aged controls and musicians (p=.93)
(cf. Fig. 2).

5. Study 1: Discussion
In order to explore whether regular engagement in musical activitiesis associated with a
decreasein the age effect on some cognitive functions, we studied the cognitive performances
of middle-aged and older musicians in comparison with control participants. In line with the
literature, results were as follows:

5.1. No main effect of musical practice
We found no musical practice-related difference on the verbal and visual modalities of longterm memory. Hanna-Pladdy and MacKay (2011) hadpreviously found that musical
engagement in older individuals was linked to better performances in visual memory.This
finding was not replicated here,despite using a virtually identicaltest(delayed visual figure
reproduction).
We also found that musical practice was not associated with better performances on Raven’s
progressive matrices, suggesting that there is no linkbetween engagement in musical activities
and nonverbal reasoning skills. Correlational studies regarding musical training and nonverbal
reasoning skills (assessed using virtually similar tests) have sometimes reported positive
findings (e.g., Forgeard et al., 2008; Bailey and Penhune, 2012), but not always (e.g., Franklin
et al., 2008; Schellenberg and Moreno, 2010). The null finding of the present study adds to
the uncertainty about the association between musical training and nonverbal reasoning skills.
In the same vein, digit-symbol codingwas not performed better by musician participants of
our sample. Individualized music lessons (learning to playthe piano) given to 16 older

nonmusicians were shown to increase performances on this measure (Bugos et al., 2007).
Here, we found that older musicians who had been practicing music since childhood were no
better at this test.

5.2.An effect of musical practice that does not interact with age
For processing speed,as assessed with the d2 test, we found significantly better performances
for musician individuals compared with nonmusicians, but differences between middle-aged
and olderparticipants were the same for both groups. The literatureinvestigating musical
practice during old age had already reporteda trendtoward significancefordifferenceon the
TMTA(Hanna-Pladdy and MacKay, 2011). This finding was replicated here with a different
test, and with the precision that age-related differences were the same for both musicians and
nonmusicians.
Regarding the size of the digit span, we found that musicians performed significantly better
than their nonmusician counterparts. This result goes againstHanna-Pladdy et al.’s two crosssectional studies (2011, 2012),which did not report such findings even though they used the
same test. In addition, we showed a trend toward significance for the interaction with age, but
which was not significant. That meant, again, that the age-related differences in performances
were not significantly different between the groups.
These patterns of results did not match our first hypothesis, and were likely to reflect a
predisposition in musicians for learning/practicing music, rather than a stimulation of
learning/practicing music. Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that features of musical practice
(e.g., score reading, typing, and auditory attention) lead to an increase in neural resources for
processing speed and auditory-verbal short-term memory, endowing musicians with an
advantage of a quantitative nature,with no further particular change.

5.3.An effect of musical practice that interacts with age
For the two verbal fluency tests (phonemic and semantic), results showed that musicians
produced significantly more correct words than nonmusicians. This was only partially in
agreement with Hanna-Pladdy and Gajewski (2012), as they found the same effect for
phonemic, but not semantic fluency. Therefore, we confirmed that older individuals who
practice music score higher on a test measuring verbal skills.
In addition,significant interactions with age indicated that performances were relatively
similar between middle-aged and older individuals of the control groups (with a trend toward
reduced semantic fluency for older participants), but increased significantlyin musicians for
phonemic fluency.
The semantic and phonemic fluency tasks were therefore the only measures that confirmed
our hypothesis of different age-related changes for musicians compared with nonmusicians.
However, we did not findsignificant effect of age on these measures, makingthem less
interesting in the framework of cognitive reserve. Moreover, it is important to point outthat
for these two tests, no difference was found between musicians and nonmusicians of the
middle-age groups. This did not really suggest a transformative effect of musical practice,

because in the case of an actual stimulation, one would have expected musicians to
outperform nonmusicians from middle age onwards.

6. Study 2: Material and methods
6.1. Study 2: Participants
In this second step, we sought for a link between the characteristics of the musicians’ practice
and their performances on tests having revealed significant interactions in Study 1 (i.e.
phonemic and semantic fluencies). To probe the age at training onset effect, we added a
sample of older musicians who had started music in adulthood (called “short-term
musicians”), and compared their performances with those of the age-matched participants of
Study 1(the older“long-term musicians” and older controls). We also questioned the influence
of a characteristic of currentpractice by running a correlation analysis between the
oldermusicians’ frequency of training and their performances.
Twelve older amateur musicians (mean age= 70.04 years,SD=7.7, min.=61, max.=83) who
had started music at a mean age of 42.7 years (SD=11) were recruited fromFrench
conservatories or music schools. As for Study 1, no self-educated musicians were included,
they had learned at least 2 new pieces during the last year, and they had an uninterrupted time
of practice of at least 4 years at the time of the study (meantraining duration=25.8
years,SD=12.38, min.=6, max.=40), with at least 4 hours’ practicing a week (meanfrequency
=8.08 hours,SD=7.24, min.=4, max.=30) (cf. Table 5).

6.2.Study 2: neuropsychological assessment
Study 2’s neuropsychological battery was exactly the same as the one used in Study1. It
comprised the same tests and was administered in an identical way by the same
experimenters. Zscore values were computed based on the entire Study 2’s sample.

6.3.Study 2: statistical analyses
A Chi-Square test of independence was run on the between-group gender frequencies to attest
that the male/female ratios did not differ significantly. Three ANOVAs were conducted on the
meansfor age, education, and occupation, to attest that the three groups of participants were
similar on these measures.
To locate the short-term musician group’s performances relative to the long-term musician
and the control groups, we conducted ANOVAs on the cognitive scores having revealed
interaction effects inStudy 1 (i.e. the two verbal fluency tasks). Then, if the ANOVAs led to a
significant effect of group, we ran posthoc analyses (Least Square DeviationLSD) for
pairwise comparisons.
Finally, to see whether the musicians’ frequency of training explained their number of
recalled words, we conducted a nonparametric correlation analysis (Spearman’s rho)between
these variables for all the musicians of the Study 2’s sample.

7. Study 2: results
7.1. Demographic matching
The chi-squaretest of independence showed no between-group difference for gender
frequencies (χ²(2, N = 47)=1.7, p=.43). The one-way ANOVAs ran on age (F(2, 44)=1.3,
p=.28), education (F(2, 44)=1.71, p=.19) and occupation (F(2, 44)=.36, p=.7),confirmed that
thegroups did not differ on these measures (cf. Table 5).
The two-samplettestscomparing the practice characteristics of the two musician groups
revealed significantly differentages at training onset (t(25)=-10.26, p<.001), but similar
training frequencies (t(25)=.41, p=.74) (cf. Table 5).
7.2. Between-group differencesfor phonemic fluency
Phonemic fluency scores showed a significant main effect of group (F(2, 44)=7.51, p<.05).
Posthoc analysis revealed that the long-term musicians scored significantly higher than the
short-term musicians (p<.05),the latter being no different from control participants (p=.46)
(cf. Fig. 3).

7.3. Between-group differencesfor semantic fluency
Semantic fluency scores revealed a significant effect of group (F(2, 44)=6.43, p<.01). Posthoc
analysis indicated that there was no difference in the performances of the two groups of
musicians (p=.23), and that the short-term musician groupalsoperformed better than control
participants (p<.05) (cf. Fig. 3).

7.4.Correlation analysis

scores and their frequency of training revealed no significant relation (cf. Table 6).

8. Study 2: Discussion
To seek for a link between practice characteristics and older musicians’ superior
performances, we conducted a second study (Study 2),in which we includeda sample of
different older musicians (they had begun practicing music 30 years later on average than the
musicians in Study 1). Results indicatedthat there was no link between frequency of training
and verbal fluency performances. Moreover, because the two musician groups (long-term and
short-term) had identical performances on the semantic version, we concluded that the older
musicians’betterabilityinthis test was not explained by their practice, and probablyconstituted
a confounding factor.
For phonemic fluency, results showedanother pattern, indicating that musicians who had
startedtheir musical training during adulthood did not differ from controls.This could be in
line with works showing that practice-related brain or cognitive differences are more
pronounced when training starts at an early age (Elbert et al., 1995; Schlaug et al., 1995;
Amunts et al., 1997; Steele et al., 2013). As verbal fluency assesses mainly verbal functions,
our resultsalso corroborated studies reporting better performances across a wide variety of
language-related tests for children who have learned to play music (e.g. vocabulary; Forgeard

et al., 2008; Moreno et al., 2009). In line with a previous investigation (Hanna-Pladdy and
Gajewski, 2012), the present study showed that musical training in childhood is also
associated with better literacy in old age, regardless of current musical engagement. The longterm influence of early environmental factors on brain and cognition has already been attested
in animal studies (Fernández-Teruel et al., 1997). Moreover, in humans, educational
attainment is known to be a major factor in determining individuals’ cognitive reserve later in
life (Stern, 2012), even when occupation is controlled for. In the field of music, Gooding et al.
(2013) found that the amountof musical engagement from childhood until adulthood
explained older individuals’ verbal fluency and long-term memory performances. Therefore,
it could be that the cognitive advantage we observed in the older musicianswas linkedto
themusical education they had received during the sensitive period of childhood. From this
perspective, music lessons would act as an environmental enrichment whichendows people
who benefit it with better verbal skills in later life. Then again, given that our two studies had
a cross-sectional design, our resultsmay also indicate that individualswhose verbal skills are
particularly good in old age are also those who were most likelyto come to music early, and to
continue their musical training lately.

9. General discussion
To sum up, our cognitive investigationof musiciansyielded little evidence ofreducedagerelated changesowing to musicaltraining. In line with this work’s hypotheses, phonemic
fluency was the only cognitive variable that potentially exemplified a positive use-dependent
effect inaging. Hanna-Pladdy and Gajewski (2012.) had previously reported better phonemic
fluency performances inolder individuals who had practiced music in childhood, and the
current status of training (active vs.inactive) was not linkedwith performances (Hanna-Pladdy
and Mackay, 2011). This is in agreement with the absence of an associationwith frequency of
training in the present study. In addition, we showed that the period at training onset seems to
matter, as older musicians who had started musical practice in adulthood were no different
from controls. This could be because there is a sensitive period for brain and cognitive
plasticity (Penhune, 2011). The possibility that musicalinstruction in childhood could have a
long-lasting influence on cognition in later life fits in with the definition of reserve, andthe
notion that “sensitive periods are epochs in development where specific experiences have
enhanced and long-lasting effects on behavior and the brain” (Knudsen, 2004).
We found that only a verbal domain-related task fulfilled our criteria to be qualified as
« stimulated by musical practice in aging ». This could be viewed as anadditional argument in
favor ofthe existence of a special link between musical practice and verbal skills (Chan et al.,
1998; Ho et al., 2003;Forgeard et al., 2008). Explanations for this presumeduse-dependent
enhancement of speech fluency include the processing of commonauditory features in music
and language (Patel and Iversen, 2007), and the strengthening of the auditory-motor neural
couplingthat serves both in music and in language production and perception(Bangert et al.,
2006).
However, as already stated, phonemic fluency was not better performed by musicians
compared with nonmusicians for the middle-aged period of life. This is not really what we
would expect in the case of actual stimulation. Moreover, in this work, many factors that are
known to be associated with cognitive functioning and musical engagement were not
controlled for, including the early sociocultural environment (family income, parental first
language, parental education, etc.; Elpus, 2013). The first step of the present study

investigated older people who had an ongoing musical training since childhood untillate-life.
Ecologically, such individuals are scarce, and they probably have particular personality traits
that prompt them not only to play music, but also toengage in other behaviors that may help
them to developa cognitive reserve (healthy diet, moderate smoking/drinking, and other
physical, social, and intellectual activities). Even more important, in this study, none of the IQ
scores (verbal or performance) was assessed, but they are important determinants of
individuals’ cognitive reserve and thelikelihoodof their taking upmusic lessons (Schellenberg,
2011). Indeed, if music lessons do lead to improvements in IQ (Schellenberg, 2004), a
comprehensive work has rigorously highlighted that children with a high IQ are more inclined
than children with a lower IQ to attend music lessons (Schellenberg, 2011).
In the present study, a proxy forperformance IQ (Raven’s matrices test) showed no betweengroups difference, but we found that the semantic fluency task was performedbetter by
musicians, regardless the life period at training onset and the current frequency of training.
This result could reflect a tendency of high verbal IQ people (or with a large vocabulary) to
come up with- and pursue- music training later in life. However, only the musicians since
childhood displayed better performances on phonemic fluency. Therefore, as in Hanna-Pladdy
and Gajewski’s study (2012), it could suggest that old musician individuals who started
practicing music in theirchildhood display better verbal functions beyond what could be
explained by their initially higher verbal IQ.
To conclude, the quality of people’s cognitive reserve depends on many intricate factors. It is
highly conceivable that people who keep good cognitive functioning in old age are also those
who are likely to pursue or expand their daily-life activities. In turn, maintaining these
activities may certainly help to keep their cognition young. However, inour work (N=79/5),
which did not control for such selection bias-related confounding factors, we found that
highly trained and active musicians (mean training duration = 38 years; mean frequency of
training = 10.86 hours/week) did not perform any better than control participants on long-term
memory (verbal and visual), nonverbal reasoning, and visual scanning (digit-symbol coding).
For processing speed and auditory-verbal short-term memory, musicians scored higher but
displayed no weaker age-related difference, thus ruling out a protective effect of practice
(although both processing speed and auditory short-term memory are highly solicited in
musicians). Playing music, as speaking,areauditory-motorbehaviors, and there are reports that
some individuals own predisposing functional brain organization to learn faster in these
abilities (Zatorre, 2013). It is therefore conceivable that some peoplekeep disposing neural
substratesthat prompt them to pursue music later in life.
Only for phonemic fluencywas musical practice associated with a different age-related change
in performances, depending on the period at training onset (musicians who started in
adulthood performed identically to controls). Therefore, according to us, this test was the
solely potential candidate for a use-dependent adaptation interacting with musicians’
cognitive aging.
Acquiring an expertise through deliberate practice leads to automation and to strategic
processes that allow performances to be improved in a cost-effective way (neural efficiency;
Kelly and Garavan, 2005). Other styles of behavior, such as exposure to novelty, may be more
efficient in increasing old individuals’ cognitive reserve.
