Abstract
Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that crystallization and glass-like solidification are useful analogies for understanding cell ordering in confluent biological tissues. It remains
unexplored how cellular ordering contributes to pattern formation during morphogenesis. With
a computational model we show that a system of elongated, cohering biological cells can get dynamically arrested in a network pattern. Our model provides a new explanation for the formation
of cellular networks in culture systems that exclude intercellular interaction via chemotaxis or
mechanical traction.

INTRODUCTION

By aligning locally with one another, cells of elongated shape form ordered, crystalline
configurations in cell cultures of, e.g. fibroblasts [1, 2], mesenchymal stem cells [2], and
endothelial cells [3]. Initially the cells form small clusters of aligned cells; the clusters then
grow and the range over which cells align increases with time [2, 4]. To study the emergence
of such crystalline cellular ordering, it is useful to make an analogy with liquid crystals
[2]. For example, a “cellular temperature” can be defined to describe the cell-type specific
persistence (low cellular temperature) or randomness (high cellular temperature) of cell
motility, where cells of high cellular temperature (e.g., fibroblasts) are less likely to form
crystalline configurations than cells of low temperature (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells) [2]. It
was similarly proposed that collective cell motion in crowded cell sheets can be understood as
system approaching a glass transition [5, 6]. Although these studies provide useful insights
into the ordering of cells in confluent cell layers, it remains unexplored how crystallization
and glass-like dynamics contribute to the formation of more complex shapes and patterns
during biological morphogenesis.
Cells’ organizing into network-like structures, as it occurs for example during blood vessel
development, is a suitable system to study how cellular ordering participates in pattern
formation. In cell cultures after stimulation by growth factors (VEGFs, FGFs), endothelial
cells elongate and form vascular-like network structures [7–9]. The mechanisms that drive
the aggregation of endothelial cells and their subsequent organization into network is a
subject of debate. Most models assume an attractive force between cells, either due to
chemotaxis [10–18] or due to mechanical traction via the extracellular matrix [19–24]. In
vitro experiments show that astroglia-related rat C6 cells and muscle-related C212 cells can
form network-like structures on a rigid culture substrate [25], which excludes formation of
mechanical or chemical attraction between cells. Therefore a second class of explanations
proposed that cells form networks by adhering better to locally elongated configurations of
cells [25] or elongated cells [26]. Here we show that, in absence of mechanical or chemical
fields such mechanisms are unnecessary: elongated cells organize into network structures
if they move and rotate randomly, and adhere to adjacent cells. As the cells align locally
with one another, a network pattern appears. Additional, long-range cell-cell attraction
mechanisms, e.g., chemotaxis or mechanotaxis, act to stabilize the pattern and fix its wave

MODEL DESCRIPTION

To model the collective movement of elongated cells, we use the cellular Potts method
(CPM), aka the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg model [27, 28], a lattice-based, Monte-Carlo model
that has been used to model developmental mechanisms including somitogenesis [29, 30],
convergent extension [31] and fruit fly retinal patterning [32]. The CPM represents cells as
connected patches of lattice sites with identical spin σ ∈ N; lattice sites with spin σ = 0
represent the extracellular matrix (ECM). To simulate stochastic cell motility, the CPM
iteratively displaces cell-cell and cell-ECM boundaries by attempting to copy the spin of
a randomly selected site into a randomly selected adjacent lattice site ~x, monitoring the
resulting change ∆H of a Hamiltonian,

H=

A copy attempt will always be accepted if ∆H ≤ 0, if ∆H > 0 a copy attempt is accepted
with the Boltzmann probability P (∆H) = exp(−∆H/µ(σ)), with µ(σ) a “cellular temperature” to simulate cell-autonomous random motility. For simplicity, we here assume that
all cells have identical temperature. The time unit is a Monte Carlo step (MCS), which
corresponds with as many copy attempts as there are lattice sites.
The first term of Eq. 1 defines an adhesion energy, with the Kronecker delta returning a
value of 1 for site pairs at cell-cell and cell-ECM interfaces, or zero otherwise. In the model
two contact energies are defined: Jcell,cell for σ > 0 at both lattice sites, and Jcell,ECM for
σ = 0 at one lattice site. The second and third term are shape constraints that penalize
deviations from a target shape, with A and L a target area and length, and a(σ) and l(σ)
the current area and length of the cell; λA and λL are shape parameters. We efficiently
estimate l(σ) by keeping track of a cellular inertia tensor as previously described [14].
In a subset of simulations, we further assume that cells secrete a diffusing chemoattractant
c, which we describe with a partial differential equation:
∂c(~x, t)
= D∇2 c(~x, t) + s(1 − δ(σ(~x), 0)) − ǫ δ(σ(~x), 0)),
∂t

(2)

with diffusion constant D, secretion rate s and decay rate ǫ. After each MCS, a forward
Euler method solves Eq. 2 for 15 steps with ∆t = 2 s with zero boundary conditions. To
model the cells’ chemotaxis up concentration gradients of the chemoattractant, during each
copy attempt from ~x to x~′ we increase ∆H with a ∆Hchemotaxis = λc (c(~x) − c(~x′ )), with λc
a chemotactic strength [33]. One lattice unit (l.u.) corresponds with 2 µm. We use the
following parameter settings, unless specified otherwise: µ = 1; Jcell,cell = .5; Jcell,ECM = .35;
λA = 1; λL = .1; λc = 10; A = 100 l.u.2 ; L = 60 l.u.; D = 10−13 m2 s−1 ; ǫ = 1.8 · 10−4 s−1 ;
s = 1.8·10−4 s−1 . Unless stated otherwise, a simulation is initialized with 175 cells randomly
distributed on a 220x220 area at the center of a 400x400 lattice.

RESULTS

As Fig. 1 shows, and in agreement with previous reports [14], if we allow for chemotaxis,
rounded cells accumulate into rounded clusters (Fig. 1A) and elongated cells aggregate into
networks (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, however, chemotaxis is not required for network formation:
cell-cell adhesion between elongated cells suffices for forming networks (Fig. 1B). Movies

standard deviation).
corresponding with Fig. 1B and C [41] suggest that the gradual alignment of cells with
their neighbors is key to network formation and network evolution. To characterize this cell
alignment, we define θ(~x, r) as the angle between the direction of the long axis ~v (σ(~x)) of
the cell at ~x, and a local director ~n(~x, r), a weighted local average of cell orientations defined
at radius r around ~x: ~n(~x, r) = h~v (σ(~y ))i{~y∈Z2 :|~x−~y|<r} . Figure 2A and B depict the value
of θ(~x, 3) for simulations without chemotaxis (Fig. 2A) and with chemotaxis (Fig. 2B),
with dark gray values indicating values of θ(~x, 3) → π/2. Network branches are separated
by large values of θ(~x, 3), indicating that within branches cells are aligned, whereas branch
points are “lattice defects” in which cells with different orientations meet.
Supplemental Movies S3 and S4 [42] show how the cells align gradually over time in the

[34] with X(σ)
the center of mass of cell σ. S ranges from 0 for randomly oriented cells to
1 for cells oriented in parallel.
Figure 2C shows the evolution of the global orientational order parameter limr→∞ S(r)
and of the local orientational order parameters S(20) and S(40). Both with chemotaxis
(dashed lines) and without (solid lines), S(20) grows more quickly and reaches higher ordering than S(40). The reason for this is that in cells of length 50 −60 l.u., S(20) (covering cells
up to a radius r = 20 from the cell’s center of mass) only detects lateral alignment of cells,
whereas a radius S(40) also detects linear line-up of cells. Thus cell-cell adhesion of long
cells quickly aligns cells with the left and right neighbors, while it aligns them more slowly
with those in front and behind. This results in networks with short branches of aligned cells.
Interestingly, chemotaxis aligns cells more rapidly, both along the short and long sides of
cells, resulting in networks with much longer branches than with adhesion alone.

FIG. 3: Relation between cluster size and cell displacement. Clusters are calculated for
each morphology between 500 and 25,0000 MCS (100 simulation repeats), with an interval
of 500 MCS; see text for details. The error bars represent the standard error of the linear
fits used to estimate diffusion coefficients.
Next we analyze the mechanisms that drive the orientational ordering in the cell networks.
Visual inspection of the simulation movies suggests that single cells move and rotate much
more rapidly than locally aligned clusters of cells. A network of locally aligned cells forms
6

rapidly from initially dispersed cells. Merging of branches seems to be a much slower process,
and potentially prevents a further evolution to global nematic order. To quantify these
observations we measured the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of cells as
a function of the size of the network branch to which it belongs. We loosely define a
network branch, or cluster of aligned cells as a connected set of at least two cells with
relative orientations < 5◦ , i.e., in Fig. 2A and B dark gray values separate the clusters.
To detect clusters computationally, we first identify the connected sets for which θ(~x, 3) ≤
5◦ , which are surrounded by lattice sites of σ = 0 or sites with θ(~x, 3) > 5◦ . We then
eliminate connected sets of fewer than fifty lattice sites. The CPM cells sharing at least
50% of their lattice sites with one of the remaining sets form a cluster. The translational
diffusion coefficient, Dt , derives from the mean square displacement (MSD) of a set of cells:

D

~
~
|X(σ, t) − X(σ, 0)|
= 4Dt t. Similarly, the rotational diffusion coefficient, Dr , derives
σ

from the mean square rotation (MSR) of a set of cells: h(α(σ, t) − α(σ, 0))2 iσ = 2Dr t, with
α(σ, t)−α(σ, 0) the angular displacement of a cell between time 0 and t. During a simulation,
cells may move between clusters, and clusters can merge. Therefore, to calculate Dt and
Dr of cells as a function of cluster size, for 100 simulations of 250,000 MCS we measured
trajectories of each individual cell with one data point per 500 MCS, and kept track of the
size of the cluster it was classified into at each time point. We defined cluster size bins, with
the first bin collecting all clusters consisting of two to five cells, and the next bins running
from 6 to 10, 11 to 15, etc. We split up the trajectories into chunks of 10 consecutive data
points, during which the cells stayed within clusters belonging to one bin. To calculate Dt
and Dr we performed a least square fitting on the binned MSD and MSR values for these
trajectory chunks.
The translational diffusion, Dt , increases slightly with cluster size (Fig. 3A). This may
reflect that the probability of hopping between small clusters will be larger than the probability of hopping between larger clusters, resulting in an overrepresentation of slow cells in
the small clusters. Interestingly, the rotational diffusion Dr drops with the cluster size (Fig.
3B), indicating that cells in large clusters rotate more slowly. These results suggest that the
rotation of cells in big clusters is limited, which reduces the probability that two clusters
rotate and merge into a single larger cluster. Therefore, if the size of clusters increases,
their rotation speeds drop as does the probability of cluster fusion. Thus, although further
alignment of clusters would reduce the pattern energy H (Eq. 1), the pattern evolution
7

essentially freezes.
To corroborate our hypothesis that network patterns are transient patterns that increasingly slowly evolve towards nematic order, we looked for model parameters that could speed
up pattern evolution. Fig. 4A shows the effect of surface tension (γcell,ECM ) on the ability
of cells to form networks after 100,000 MCS, as expressed by the configuration’s compactness C =

Acells
,
Ahull

where Ahull is the area of the convex hull of the largest connected group

of cells, and Acells is the summed area of the cells inside the hull. A value of C → 1
indicates a spheroid of cells, where for networks C would tend to zero. For values of
γcell,ECM = Jcell,ECM −

Jcell,cell
2

> 0, the equilibrium pattern should minimize its surface area

with the ECM. Indeed at increased surface tensions the cells settle down in spheroids or
networks with only few meshes, although they initially still form network-like patterns (see
Movie S5 [43]). To confirm that also for γcell,ECM = 0.1 (i.e., the values used in Figs. 13) spheroids are stable configurations, we initialized our model with a spheroid (Fig. 4B).
Although initially some cells sprout (Fig. 4C) from the spheroid due to their elongation,
they then align gradually and the cell cluster remains spherical. No network formation was
detected in simulations of 100,000 MCS (Fig. 4D), suggesting that spheroids represent the
global minimum of the Hamiltonian. Interestingly, in presence of chemotaxis networks form
for a wide range of surface tensions (inset Fig. 4A and [14]).

DISCUSSION

Our analysis suggests that in the cellular Potts model elongated, adhesive cells can form
networks in a parameter regime where a spheroid pattern is the minimal energy state. The
cells initially align with nearby cells, thus forming the branches of the network. In order
for the pattern to evolve further towards the minimal-energy spheroid pattern, the locally
aligned clusters of cells must join adjacent branches, for which they must move and rotate.
Our analysis of the rotational and translational diffusion of cells in Fig. 3 shows that this
becomes more difficult for cells belonging to larger clusters. Thus the networks evolve
ever more slowly to the minimal energy state, and gets dynamically arrested in a networklike configuration, a phenomenon reminiscent of the glass transition, as e.g. observed in
attractive colloid systems [35], collective cell migration of biological cells in vitro [5, 6], and
colloid rod suspensions [36] in which gels can form from clusters of parallel rods [37–39].

FIG. 4: A Relation between compactness and surface tension, with and without
chemotaxis. The compactness was calculated at 100,000 MCS and averaged over 100
simulations (error bars represent standard deviation). Simulations were initialized with 350
cells on 260x260 path on the center of a 420x420 lattice. B-D evolution of a simulation
initialized with 128 cell blob 9on the center of a 420x420 grid.

Fig. 4A suggests that the cellular Potts simulations undergo a glass transition as the
surface tension drops: for high surface tension the system evolves towards equilibrium,
for lower surface tensions the system becomes jammed in a network-like state. Thus our
model provides a new explanation for the formation of vascular networks in absence of
chemical or mechanical, long-range, intercellular attraction [25]. Interestingly, intercellular
attraction via chemotaxis stabilizes the formation of networks in our simulations [14] and can
drive sprouting from spheroids (not shown). This suggests that networks are an equilibrium
pattern of our system in presence of intercellular attraction. Nevertheless the present analysis
of arrested dynamics provides new insight into the system with intercellular attraction:
chemotaxis reinforces local ordering over a distance proportional to the diffusion length of
the chemoattractant producing networks of a scale independent of surface tension [14].
