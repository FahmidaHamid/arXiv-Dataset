In silico prediction of protein-protein interactions
in human macrophages

Abstract
Background: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses are highly valuable in deciphering and
understanding the intricate organisation of cellular functions. Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein
interaction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the spatial, temporal or physiological conditions in
which the interactions may occur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages.
Results: We integrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer (APID) with different meta-data
to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific interactome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained
interactome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins involved in macrophage-related biological
processes (i.e. immune response activation, regulation of apoptosis). As a case study, we used the contextualized
interactome to highlight the cellular processes induced upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
Conclusion: Our work confirms that contextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of bioinformatic
analyses. More specifically, studying such inferred network rather than focusing at the gene expression level only, is
informative on the processes involved in the host response. Indeed, important immune features such as apoptosis are
solely highlighted when the spotlight is on the protein interaction level.

Background
Nowadays, infectious respiratory diseases such as
tuberculosis (TB) are no longer a major concern for
third world countries only. According to the WHO,
one third of the worldwide population is infected
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in a latent
(Latent form Tuberculosis; LTB) and about ten million
cases of Active Tuberculosis (ATB) occur annually [1].
The HIV-TB co-infection also plays a major role in the
increase of active tuberculosis cases around the world [1].
Although TB is curable by an adequate antibiotic
treatment, patient compliance is often problematic
and many clinical cases show multi-drug resistance [2].
These cumulated observations underscore the importance
of continued investigation into the mechanisms used
by the infectious agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

to persist and overturn inside the host cell. The TB
infection mostly occurs by aerosols and MTB infects
alveolar macrophages, which then provide an environment
for replication and persistence of bacilli. To do so,
the bacterium uses several host cellular pathways such
as the PI(3)kinase network around PKB/AKT1 [3] to
subvert the immune response and to persist into the
macrophage. In response, the host activates the same
pathway to trigger the elimination of the pathogen
[4]. The intricacy of these mechanisms on one hand,
and the potential utility of protein-protein interaction
(PPI) network analyses to understand the various cellular
mechanisms on the other hand, led us to hypothesise that
identifying the PPI network in infected macrophages,
would provide new insights concerning the infection and
the persistence of the pathogen within its host cell.
Indeed, PPI are key elements in the organisation of
cellular functions [5]. In the post-genomic era, most
of these interactions have been identified by either of
two high-throughput methods: the yeast two-hybrid
(Y2H) system [6] and affinity purification followed by

mass spectrometry (AP-MS) [7]. Numerous methods
aiming at inferring interactions have also been proposed,
based on sequence signatures and similarities, domain
profiling or bayesian predictions [8-11]. Overall, the
assembly of all these PPI added to those identified by
small-scale experiments, form large networks called
‘interactomes’ [12]. Bioinformatic analyses of these networks have led to numerous functional insights such as
function prediction for uncharacterised proteins [13-18],
evolution of the function of the duplicated genes [19-21]
and the organisation of the signalling pathways [22,23].
However, it is important to note that these interactomes
are devoid of spatio-temporal information. Indeed, interactions identified by the Y2H techniques are biophysically
possible but physiologically context-less. They therefore
remain hypothetical until their characterisation in
particular conditions in vivo [24]. In this context, the
reconstruction of contextualised macrophage interactome
is a crucial methodological step towards a comprehensive
study of MTB infection. To support and strengthen the
potential occurrence of the interactions discovered using
high-throughput and bioinformatic inference methods in
particular physiological contexts, additional functional
features such as co-expression correlations, genetic interactions, and functional protein annotations have been routinely
used as secondary meta-data to contextualize interactomes
[25-27] particularly in a bayesian framework [28].

In this work, we propose a contextualised macrophage PPI network resulting from the combination of
PPIs with functional annotations and expression data.
To achieve this, we used as an initial step, statistical
and functional criteria to select a Confidence Subset
(CS) of interactions containing those likely occurring
in vivo in the human macrophage. After showing the
reliability of the CS, we used it as a cornerstone to
infer the most likely macrophage interactome. The
summary of the complete pipeline is illustrated in
Figure 1.
We then verified the specificity of the contextualized
macrophage interactome composed of 30,182 interactions
by showing that it is enriched in proteins related to
the immune response, expressed in macrophages
according to the Human Protein Atlas [29] and HPRD
[30] and belonging to the host regulatory network
during MTB infection [31] as well as in interactions
reported to occur in macrophages according to InnateDB
[32]. As a last step, aiming at pointing towards the
modifications of the macrophage interactome induced
by MTB exposure, we used the contextualized interactome to highlight the cellular processes at work
upon MTB infection. Interestingly, we showed that
considering protein interactions rather than differentially expressed genes provides complementary functional
information.

Figure 1 From an initial heterogeneous context-less dataset (FS). We extracted a confidence subset (CS) of interactions with high potential
to occur within a human macrophage. This subset was statistically and functionally assessed. Using a metric we identified a subset of interactions
having close characteristics to the confidence subset called contextualised interactome (CI).

Results
Contextualizing the interactome
Integrating data to constitute a full dataset

We extracted the human interaction dataset from the APID
database [33]. Additional information was integrated to
describe each interaction. The following qualitative
and quantitative descriptors were used: independent
methodological proofs and reports of the interaction, gene
co-expression in macrophage, functional co-annotation
and sub-cellular co-localisation of the interaction partners
(see Material & Methods for the detailed processing of the
descriptors). For the sake of clarity, the full dataset
composed of the values taken by the descriptors of
each interaction was named the Full Set (FS).
Defining a confidence subset (CS) of macrophage
interactions

From the FS composed of 38,832 interactions involving
9,813 proteins, we extracted a Confidence Subset (CS)
composed of interactions that likely occur in macrophages,
using functional and statistical parameters. For this,
we used principal component analysis (PCA) that
allows assembling parameters showing similar behaviours
(see Material & Methods for details). According to the
correlations obtained, the number of reports and
evidences are correlated as well as the number of
common Gene Ontology terms describing the cellular

components and biological processes in which protein
pairs are involved (Figure 2). These statistical observations
are used to discriminate the CS interactions.
Considering that gene co-expression is routinely used
as a parameter in contextualization attempts [25,26], we
included only interactions between the products of genes
co-expressed in macrophages in the CS. Ultimately,
considering that proteins composed of known interacting
domains have higher confidence in the PPI network, we
selected only interactions between partners sharing
interacting domains according to PFAM annotations.
Overall, each interaction belonging to the CS obeys the
following criteria (Figure 3, Material & Methods for details):
1) the genes encoding the interacting proteins must be
co-expressed in normal, uninfected macrophages;
2) the protein partners must share interacting domains
according to PFAM;
3) protein partners must share functional Gene
Ontology annotations;
4) the interaction must have been identified several
times by independent experiments.
In this way, a CS composed of 530 interactions involving
594 proteins was obtained. The analysis of the Gene
Ontology terms annotating those proteins showed
that the CS is enriched in terms related to immune

cumulative filters. The 1st filter box excludes interaction in which protein partners are not co-detected in untreated macrophage. The 2nd filter
holds only interactions which partners are known to share interactiong domain according to iPFAM. The 3rd filter maintains interactions with
satisfying annotation parameters (GO Biological process, GO cellular component). The 4th parameter checks the reproducibility of the interaction
with different experimental evidences or in different Pubmed publications.

I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade (FC = 5.1, p-value =
5.7 × 10−11) (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Aiming to further gain confidence in the CS, we
compared our empirical filtering process to clusters
obtained upon applying an unsupervised clustering
method to the FS. Interestingly, the Self Organizing Map
(SOM) [34] analysis showed that 64% of the interactions
contained in the CS are grouped in a single cluster, the
remaining interactions being located in 5 out of 16 clusters
(Figure 4). This shows that the interactions grouped into
the CS according to the criterion empirically chosen
(described above) are in agreement with clusters obtained
mathematically using an unsupervised algorithm.
In conclusion, the functional enrichment of relevant
groups of genes and the satisfactory comparison to unsupervised clustering reinforce the hypothesis that the interactions composing the CS likely occurring in the macrophage.
Delineating the macrophage protein interaction network

To identify the most likely macrophage PPI network, the
interactions most resembling those of the CS were selected

by computing a similarity distance. To this end, the CS interactions barycentre was first identified and compared to
the descriptor values of the FS interactions. In this case, the
barycentre is computed as the centre of mass of all the CS
interactions. In other words, considering that CS interactions represents a cloud of points in a multidimensional
space with an axis for each of the variables (descriptors),
the barycentre of these interactions is defined by the mean
of each variable. The barycentre is identified for CS elements as a centroid point whose coordinates represent a

where CSdi represents the confidence subset descriptor
index.
Second, we computed and compared the distributions of the Euclidean distance values between the
barycentre and the CS interactions on one hand, and
the FS interactions on the other hand (Figure 5). We
then considered as possible in a macrophage, all the
FS interactions showing a distance value to the barycentre
less than 4.2, i.e. the value corresponding to 95% of the
surface of the CS distribution. In other words, this cut-off
was used to select a CS-like behaviour among the FS
interactions.

Figure 4 Self Organizing Map: The grid (4 4) resulting of the SOM method, applied to the inferred dataset formed by 30182
interactions, shows that the confidence subset is mainly (85% of the CS elements) distributed on 2 neighbor clusters: the node (1, 4)
contains 339 elements, the node (1, 3) contains 109 interactions.

The resulting Contextualized Interactome (= CI) is
composed of 30,182 interactions involving 8,633 proteins, corresponding to 75% of the initial FS. This
ratio can be taken to mean that nearly 75% of the
interactions composing an interactome are possible
in a given tissue [35].

Validating the macrophage protein interaction network

In order to increase our confidence in the contextualisation process, we verified the functional enrichment of the CI compared to the FS. We found that
interactions involved in regulation of apoptosis (FC = 1.05,
p-value = 1.05 × 10−7) and cellular death mechanisms

are enriched, underlining the over-representation of
pathways involved in the immune response to pathogenic
exposures in the CI.
Although the CI corresponds to three quarters of
the FS, its functional terms are more significantly
enriched compared to those of the FS (See Figure 6 and
Additional file 3: Table S5). Similarly, the CI observed functional annotations terms are more significantly enriched
compared to those obtained from randomized interactomes
(Additional file 4: Figure S2).
To further assess, statistically, the resulting CI, we
compared the host regulatory network following an
exposure to MTB [31] with the CI and with randomly
obtained interaction sets. Interestingly, the CI is significantly enriched (p-value < 2.2 × 10−16; t-test) in interactions reported in the MTB regulatory network compared
to random interaction sets. Likewise, the CI is statistically
enriched in interactions experimentally identified in

devoted to innate immunity (t-test p-value < 2.2 × 10-16,
see Materiel & Methods for details).
To complement our analysis, we computed the
overlap of CI with interactomes contextualised using
other sources: the macrophage proteome from Protein
Atlas [29] and HPRD [30] (see the Materiel &
Methods for details). The CI overlaps satisfactorily with
the HPRD macrophage interactome (p-value = 0.022) and
more significantly with the Protein Atlas macrophage
interactome (p-value = 3.56 × 10−22) (see Figure 7).
Altogether, these comparisons summarised in Figure 7
emphasize the “macrophagic” specificity of the contextualized interactome (CI).

The expression signatures of macrophages infected
with MTB have been characterized in three independent
studies [31,36,37]. By combining these data, we obtained
two lists of down-regulated and up-regulated genes
upon MTB infection. Based on the SAM algorithm
(Additional file 5: Figure S1), we have ultimately
cumulated 3,724 under-expressed genes and 1,651
over-expressed genes from the three transcriptomic
experiments. We focused on these genes, knowing
that MTB infection regulates the activity of particular
host genes and cellular processes to its own benefits.
To evaluate the insights brought by a PPI level
analysis versus a classical differential gene expression
approach, we extended the list of genes revealed by
SAM to their first interactors in the CI, thus defining
two sub-networks of 2,966 and 1,435 interactions
anchored respectively on the 3,724 under-expressed
and the 1,651 genes over-expressed upon infection
(note that not all the modulated genes have interactions in
the CI). We then compared the functional enrichments of
the modulated gene lists and their resulting sub-networks.
As shown in Additional file 6: Table S3, whereas the GO
terms ‘response to oxygen levels’, ‘cell substrate adhesion’,
‘cell matrix adhesion’, ‘positive T cell selection’ are the
most enriched terms when only under-expressed
genes are considered, ‘regulation of programmed cell
death’, ‘negative and positive regulation of apoptosis’
or ‘response to wounding’ are found to be overrepresented when the interactors are taken into account. Similarly, considering the up-regulated genes

and their associated sub-network led to the same
finding (see Additional file 7: Table S4).
Therefore, focusing on the interactions involving
the products of the regulated genes rather than only
on the expression of the genes favours the emergence
of functional aspects caused by MTB infection.
Among these aspects, the regulation of the apoptosis
is known to be highly targeted and controlled by the
pathogen during the different phase of infection and
persistence in the macrophage, as is nicely discussed
by Lee and colleagues [38]. Notably, although these
regulatory aspects are crucial for the outcome of
infection, they are more significantly and extensively
revealed at the systemic scale by focusing on the PPI.
These findings highlight the need to consider infection of the host by a pathogen at the level of the
functional module, defined as a group of interacting
proteins involved in the same pathway or biological
process, instead of focusing solely on genes or their
products.
Moreover, considering the interactome revealed that
the products of the down-regulated genes after infection,
are closer to each other in the network than the rest of
the CI proteins. This supports the hypothesis that MTB
targets proteins participating to the same pathways.
Indeed, the shortest path values between the downregulated genes are significantly lower than the shortest
path between the CI proteins (Mean paths for CI and
down-regulated genes within the CI are respectively 3.3
and 4.5 (p-values 0.002557; t-test)).

Souiai et al. BMC Research Notes 2014, 7:157

Overall, these results suggest that the bacillus acts
upon key proteins, which are closely connected within
the network to regulate the host response.

Discussion and conclusions
Interactomes are undoubtedly a remarkable means to
investigate infectious diseases. By multiplying data types
and sources, we are able to increase the pertinence of the
downstream conclusions.
In this study, we proposed a method to contextualise
the interactome of a particular cell type by integrating
diverse information. In the data integration process, the
expression correlation is subject of debate. Even though
this parameter has been taken into account to propose
contextualised interactomes [25], this hypothesis has to
be considered carefully. Indeed high mRNA expression
levels do not necessarily imply a correlated protein
expression level and moreover, do not imply the
interaction between partner proteins [39].
An interaction requires the presence of both interacting
proteins for its accomplishment. This condition is
necessary but not sufficient. In the competitive cellular
environment, the occurrence of a particular interaction
rather than another possible interaction depends on
physico-chemical factors (temperature, pH, covalent
modifications such as phosphorylation) [40]. These
observations have to be taken into consideration to
improve the contextualisation process. Nevertheless,
although integrating tissue and cell type information
into interaction network is certainly a desirable goal
(see discussion of [41]), few attempts have been
reported. Interestingly, only a few types of data were
integrated at one time: Bossi and Lehner [25] proposed tissue specific interactomes by integrating gene
expression and PPI showing that most ‘housekeeping’
proteins have important tissue-specific interactions;
similarly, Rachlin and colleagues [27] provided networks
dedicated to particular biological processes by contextualizing them with Gene Ontology terms. The
multiplicity of the integrated data sources was also
brought together in a bayesian framework, aiming at
proposing functional maps to help the user to build
functional hypothesis [28] and in the analysis of a
diverse collection of genome-wide data sets (gene
expression, protein interactions, growth phenotype
data, and transcription factor binding) to decipher the
yeast system modular organisation [42]. Our approach
relies on the fact that we used multiple sources of
data in order to be able to propose a tissue-specific
network of high confidence. The use of multiple data
descriptors offers a global view and aims at minimizing
the biases for interactome contextualisation.
Second, we used a learning approach based on the
constitution of a statistically and functionally reliable CS

Page 8 of 11

in order to select the interactions likely to occur in a
macrophage. Contextualising networks and defining
dense sub-networks and functional modules governing
the host response to infection offers a complementary
approach to classical analysis for the investigation of
infectious diseases. Moreover, considering the modular
composition of the host interactomes allows inclusion in
the analyses of major actors of the immune response
and maintenance of cell fate that would not have
been tractable if considering gene or protein data
alone. Overall, our work suggests that contextualizing
interactomes improves the biological significance of
bioinformatics analyses.

Methods
Human interactome descriptors

From APID we extracted an interactome dataset composed
of 38832 interactions involving 9831 proteins. Features
were added to compose a dataset of interactions described
by functional and quantitative descriptors:
1. # methods: This information is extracted from APID
and corresponds to the number of experimental
validations describing the interaction according to
the molecular interaction controlled vocabulary
PSI-MI [43]. Only leaves of the PSI-MI experimental
validation tree were selected.
2. # publications: extracted from APID. Corresponds
to the number of articles indexed in PubMed and
reporting the interaction.
3. iPFAM value: extracted from APID. Identifies
whether the interactors pair contains domains
known as interacting according to the Pfam
database [44].
4. GO-proxy: this program is part of the GOToolBox
suite [45]. It computes a similarity index between
the interactors on the basis of the GO annotation
terms they share. The similarity index corresponds
to Czekanowski-Dice formula [13,46].
5. # of common GO biological process terms:
represents the number of common GO biological
processes shared by the interacting proteins. For
sake of precision, we only consider terms found at
level 3 in the ontology tree.
6. # of common GO cellular component terms:
corresponds to the number of common GO cellular
components shared by interactors.
7. # of common KEGG pathways: corresponds to the
number of KEGG pathways shared by the
interactors.
8. Co-expression value: macrophage expression data
from Chaussabel and colleagues [36], downloaded
from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO)
[47]. Each probe set corresponds to a mRNA and

Souiai et al. BMC Research Notes 2014, 7:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/157

was categorized either by Present, Absent or Marginal.
The Presence/Absence call of the mRNA was
calculated according to the MAS5.0 algorithm [48].
To evaluate the occurrence of the interaction considering
the Presence/Absence status of the mRNA, we assumed
the following hypotheses:
i. the presence of the mRNA implies the presence of
the corresponding protein: the mRNA is detected as
present according to the SAM algorithm [49];
ii. for a couple of proteins interacting in vitro, if both
proteins are considered as present within a targeted
cell according to the hypothesis (i), we assume that
the interaction is bio-physically possible in that
condition.

Enrichment/depletion analysis parameters
The functional analysis webtool from DAVID (http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) [50] was used to statistically investigate
the terms over-/under-represented in the set of proteins
belonging to the CS and the CI. The human genome
was used as reference to compare the FS and the CI
enrichments (Additional file 3: Table S5).
The set of proteins composing the FS interactions was
used as reference to compute the enrichment of the CS
(Additional file 1: Table S1) and the enrichment of the
CI (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The set of proteins composing the CI interactions
was used as reference to compute the enrichment of
the sub-networks of down-regulated genes and their
first interactors (Additional file 6: Table S3) and the
enrichment of the sub-networks of up-regulated genes
and their first interactors (Additional file 7: Table S4).
The p-values were calculated using a hyper-geometric
law and corrected for multi-testing with the Benjamini
and Hochberg correction.
Confidence subset statistical relevance

The CS relevance was assessed by using two distinct
clustering algorithms.
Self organizing Map (SOM)

We used an unsupervised neural network method, the
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [34] for clustering and
visualising the high-dimensional complex inferred data
on a single map. We applied a Euclidean SOM to the
APID original dataset composed of 38832 interactions,
with the following parameters: map size 5 × 10, Gaussian
as neighbour, linear initialisation and rectangular
topology. The subset composed of 530 interactions
was distributed on three neighbouring clusters. The
first one contains 437 interactions, the second contains 83

Principal component analysis (PCA)

The R graphical library Rcmdr was used to import and
normalise the FS.
This PCA allowed summarising 81% of the global
information.
Contextualised interactomes: We compared the CI
to other contextualised macrophage interactome from
various data sources:
Protein atlas contextualised interactomes: We queried
Protein Atlas [29] (http://www.proteinatlas.org/), to extract
a list of proteins having a strong expression in macrophages
(1990). To generate a contextualized interactome, we
retained only the interactions of the FS between proteins
pairs having a macrophage protein expression.
HPRD macrophage interactome: From HPRD database
(HPRD_Release9_041310), we selected a subset of proteins
localised in the macrophage. We finally obtained 201 interactions between interacting partners both localised in the
macrophage based on the tissular expression field of the
database.

subset (CI) and the FS as reference using the genome as reference.
Additional file 4: Figure S2. Top 50 comparison enrichment terms
p-values between CI and five randomised CI(s): The CI enrichments
p-values (black line) are more enriched than the observed randomised
CI enrichments p-values (p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5). T-test comparisons were
performed between the CI and each randomised set of interactions
(p1 to p5). The difference remains significant in each case with t-test
p-values varying from 4.166e-05(p2) to 0.03316(p1).
Additional file 5: Figure S1. Constitution of down-regulated and
up-regulated gene sets. These genes were identified through SAM
analysis (Significance analysis of microarray) with respect to median false
discovery rate of 1%. Red points correspond to up-regulated genes and
green points correspond to down-regulated genes. Top analysis [37];
Medium analysis [31]; Bottom analysis [36]. Ultimately these analyses
allowed respectively the constitution of respectively 3724 and 1651
up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets.
