Abstract
Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze mechanically induced dissociation and unfolding of the protein complex
CD48-2B4. This heterodimer is an indispensable component of the immunological system: 2B4 is a receptor on natural killer cells whereas
CD48 is expressed on surfaces of various immune cells. So far, its
mechanostability has not been assessed either experimentally or theoretically. We find that the dissociation processes strongly depend on
the direction of pulling and may take place in several pathways. Interestingly, the CD48-2B4 interface can be divided into three distinct
patches that act as units when resisting the pulling forces. At experimentally accessible pulling speeds, the characteristic mechanostability
forces are in the range between 100 and 200 pN, depending on the
pulling direction. These characteristic forces need not be associated
with tensile forces involved in the act of separation of the complex because prior shear-involving unraveling within individual proteins may
give rise to a higher force peak.

Introduction

A variety of processes in biological cells are performed and controlled by large
protein complexes rather than single proteins. Examples include replication,
transcription, translation, signaling, protein transport and degradation, and
cell adhesion [1]. Contemporary structural biology and molecular biophysics
are thus concerned with understanding of ever larger and more dynamically
complex molecular assemblies.
Force spectroscopy is a powerful method to study mechanical properties of
single biopolymers and biomolecular assemblies. A typical force spectroscopy
experiment uses atomic force microscope (AFM), or optical tweezers, to measure the response of a biomolecular system to stretching, squeezing, or torsional manipulation [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These experiments have provided a variety of information on transport and force generation in cells, DNA replication
and transcription [10], DNA unknotting and unwinding [8], ATP synthesis
in mitochondria [9], mechanical behavior of virus capsids under squeezing
[11, 12], and other biologically relevant problems.
There is a growing recent interest in theoretical and experimental assessments of mechanical stability of protein complexes. If there are no covalent
bonds between individual proteins then stretching by the AFM tip may result in dissociation of the complex, unraveling of the constituent proteins,
or both. The outcome reﬂects the strength of the binding forces and the
structural organization of the complex. Examples of the systems considered
so far include the titin Z1Z2-telethonin [13, 14], dimeric tubulin [15], the
3D domain-swapped cystatin [16, 17], oligomeric ﬁbrinogen [18], covalently
and non-covalently linked homo-dimeric systems with the cystine knot motif
[20, 21], and the homo-trimeric capsomers of the CCMV virus capsid [22].
In particular, Dima and Joshi [15] have identiﬁed a viscoelastic behavior in
3

unraveling of the intermeric couplings of tubulin chains. In distinction to the
ﬁbrous systems [18], there is no physiologically motivated direction of pulling
in the cystine knot, capsomer, and cystatine complexes [20, 21, 22, 16, 17].
In these systems, the response to stretching has been found to be strongly
anisotropic: It depends on which site the tip is attached to and which site
serves as an anchor. This is a signiﬁcant extension of the anisotropy phenomena that have been observed in monomeric proteins [19].
In this paper, we direct our attention to the anisotropic eﬀects arising
in mechanical manipulation of heterodimers. As an illustration we consider
a cell adhesion complex in which mechanical manipulation may lead either
to unfolding, or to dissociation, or to both eﬀects combined, depending on
the geometry of pulling. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the murine CD48-2B4
complex [23] with the Protein Data Bank structure code of 2PTT. Protein
2B4 is a heterophilic receptor present at the surface of natural killer cells.
The antigenic CD48 proteins are expressed on surfaces of various immune
cells. Interactions of CD48 with 2B4 regulate the activity of the natural
killer cells, which are components of the innate immunity against tumors
and virally infected cells. Even though the CD48-2B4 complex appears not
to have been studied through the single molecule manipulation techniques
yet, it serves as a convenient system for theoretical epxlorations.
The crystal structure of the CD48-2B4 complex that we use in this study
comprises two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains: the C2-type domain of CD48 (shown in blue in Fig. 1), and the CD48-binding domain of 2B4
(shown in red in Fig. 1). These domains comprise 110 and 112 amino acid
residues, respectively, which means that the CD48-2B4 system is too large
for a thorough all-atom molecular dynamics study on relevant time scales.
Here, we use a coarse-grained structure-based model to study the response

4

of the CD48-2B4 complex to stretching at constant speed. For simplicity,
we consider stretching only by the terminal sites. Some ways of choosing
them may result in partial or complete unfolding of the constituent proteins,
and other may lead to splitting of the complex into separate parts. We explore the roles of the inter- and intra-protein interactions in the competing
processes of unfolding and dissociation of the CD48-2B4 complex.
The 2B4 receptor binds to CD48 with a modest strength, with the equilibrium dissociation constant in the low micromolar range and very fast on
and oﬀ rates [23]. In the native state, 19 residues of 2B4 are in contact with
16 residues of CD48, and most of the contacting residues belong to loops and
turns in CD48 and in 2B4. The CD48-2B4 interface involves only 36 contacts, as determined by atomic overlaps (see the Methods section), and one
of our focal points is quantitative analysis of how and when these contacts
break during the dissociation process.
We ﬁnd that the dissociation scenarios as well as the force-displacement
patterns depend sensitively on the choice of the termini that are used to
implement stretching. In some cases, the proteins separate without any noticeable deformations or structural changes; in other cases, CD48 unfolds
partially before the proteins dissociate. However, the inter-protein contacts
always break in groups rather than sequentially. The 36 contacts between
CD48 and 2B4 can be divided into three distinct patches, which are denoted
here as a, b, and c, as shown in Fig. 1. We ﬁnd that the three interface
patches cooperate as units in resisting the stretching forces.
We also ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant resistance to stretching arises due to two
types of mechanical clamps, which involve shear and tensile forces, respectively. In shearing, two β-strands slide by, see the left-hand panel of Fig. 2. In
tensile strain, the separation between two residues in contact increases along

5

the line connecting them, as illustrated in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2.
Some choices of the pulling termini generate merely tensile eﬀects, followed
by separation of the protein complex. Other choices involve both types of
mechanical clamps, in which case several force peaks arise on the path to
separation. The largest of the force peaks needs not be tensile in origin,
and its height is not necessarily related to the binding strength of the complex. This observation is relevant for the interpretation of force spectroscopy
experiments on protein complexes.
Since there is no force spectroscopy data on the CD48-2B4 complex that
we could compare with our simulation results, we also simulate stretching of
synaptotagmin 1, which is a membrane-traﬃcking multidomain protein that
has been studied thoroughly in single-molecule pulling experiments [2, 24,
25]. Synaptotagmin 1 facilitates fusion of synaptic vesicles. Its cytoplasmic
part is composed of two domains, C2A and C2B, which together form the
C2AB complex. Our simulation results agree with experimental ﬁndings. In
particular, we ﬁnd that C2AB is signiﬁcantly less stable than the I27 domain
of titin, and that the C2A domain in the complex is less stable mechanically
than its C2B partner.

2.1

Methods
Coarse-grained model

We use our coarse-grained structure-based model [26, 27, 28, 29], in which
each amino acid residue is represented by a single bead centered on its Cα
position. The beads are tethered together into chains by strong harmonic
potentials with the spring constant kbond = 100 ǫ/Å2 , where ǫ is the depth
of the potential well associated with the native contacts, which serves as the
6

basic energy scale in our model. The native contacts are identiﬁed using
an overlap criterion [30] applied to the coordinates of all heavy atoms in
the native structure. However, the amino acid pairs that are very close
sequentially, (i, i + 1) and (i, i + 2), are excluded from the contact map [28].
It should be noted than our scheme to identify native contacts is diﬀerent
than in, for example, self-organized polymer model [15, 18] where a uniform
length cutoﬀ is used.
The interactions within the native contacts are described by the LennardJones potential
V NAT (rij ) = 4ǫ

(1)

Here, rij is the distance between residues i and j in the contact, and the
parameters σij are chosen so that each contact in the native structure is stabilized at the minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential. The value of ǫ is
approximately given by (110 ± 30) pN Å, as has been determined by comparing simulational results to the experimental ones on a set of 38 proteins
[29]. The contacts between the proteins are treated in the same manner as
the contacts within the proteins as both sets are dominated by hydrogen
bonds. The interactions in the non-native contacts are purely repulsive and
given by the truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones potential corresponding
√
to σij = r0 / 6 2 with r0 = 4 Å. The energy function comprises also harmonic
terms that favor the native values of local chiralities in each amino acid chain
[31]. A harmonic potential with the same force constant kbond as the Cα -Cα
pseudo-bonds is used to model the disulﬁde bond between Cys 3 and Cys 100
in the 2B4 receptor (chain B in the PDB structure 2PPT).
The solvent is implicit and the system evolves in time according to the
Langevin dynamics. The overall force acting on a particular bead i is a sum
7

of three terms: (i) the direct force F~i that derives from all the potential terms,
(ii) the damping force that is proportional to the velocity of the bead, and
(iii) the random force, ~Γi , that represents thermal noise. The corresponding
equations of motion

are solved by the ﬁfth order predictor-corrector algorithm with the time step
of 0.005 τ . Here, γ is the damping coeﬃcient and all beads are assumed to
√
have the same mass m. The dispersion of the noise is given by 2γkB T ,
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T denotes the temperature. All
simulations were performed at kB T = 0.3 ǫ which is near-optimal in folding
kinetics and is of order of the room temperature. The damping coeﬃcient is
set to γ = 2m/τ . This value corresponds to the overdamped case – practically
Brownian dynamics – and the characteristic time scale, τ , is of order 1 ns,
as argued in Refs. [32, 33].
The native contacts can break during the time evolution. Our criterion
for this to happen is that the distance between residues i and j in a contact
exceeds 1.5 σij .

2.2

Pulling simulations

Stretching of the CD48-2B4 complex is implemented by attaching harmonic
springs to two terminal amino acids. One of the springs is ﬁxed in space
and the other one is moved with a constant speed, vp , so that the distance it
travels in time t is d = vp t. The force constant of the pulling springs is taken
as K = 0.12ǫ/Å2 , which corresponds to about 1 pN/nm and is close to the
elasticity of typical AFM cantilevers [29].
In our simulations, the response force, F , acting on the pulling spring
is measured and averaged over time periods that correspond to the spring
8

displacements of 0.5 Å [29]. The F -d curves (see the top panels in Fig. 3 and
and several later ﬁgures) may come with several peaks, and the height of the
largest of them will be denoted by Fmax . We perform simulations for a range
of speeds with the trajectories evolving for up to 4 ms. Speciﬁc examples of
the F -d patterns will be shown for vp = 0.002 Å/τ .
All of the pulling simulations start from the native state. In the course of
the simulations, the breaking and re-formation of native contacts is followed
in time. The native contact between residues i and j is considered broken if
the inter-residue distance rij exceeds a cutoﬀ length, as deﬁned in section 2.1.
Due to thermal ﬂuctuations, the broken contacts may get re-established. To
characterize the unfolding and dissociation pattern of the events, we record
the spring displacements at which the native contacts break for the last time.
In the corresponding scenario diagrams (see the bottom panels in Fig. 3 and
several later ﬁgures), native contacts are labeled by the sequential distance
|j−i| between the residues involved. Here, we use the convention in which the
index i runs from 1 to 216 so that the values between 1 and 106 correspond
to CD48 and between 107 and 216 – to 2B4. Positions of ﬁve amino acids
are not available in the structure ﬁle (residues 1, 2 and 3 in chain A, and
residues 1 and 110 in chain B) and hence the eﬀective sequential size of the
system is smaller than the nominal 106 plus 110. The inter-protein contacts in
patches a, b, and c (shown in Fig. 1 in orange, purple and green, respectively)
correspond to i around 30 and j around 145, i around 40 and j around 195,
and ﬁnally to i around 90 and j around 150, respectively.
Our model is based on the knowledge of the native structure of the protein complex. Both CD48 and 2B4 are β-proteins, see Fig. 1. Protein 2B4
comprises two apposing β-sheets. One of them is formed by ﬁve β-strands
(β1 , β8 , β7 , β3 and β4 ) and the other one by three β-strands (β2 , β6 and

9

β5 ). Here, the β-strands are labeled from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.
2B4 also contains two short helices: α1 located between β4 and β5 , and α2
between β7 and β8 . There are also two β-sheets in CD48: the ﬁrst one is
formed by β1 , β9 , β8 , β3 , β4 and β5 , whereas the second one is composed of
β2 , β7 and β6 . Protein CD48 contains also a short α-helix, denoted here by
α1 , which is located between β7 and β8 in the apposing β-sheets.

Results and Discussion

For any heterodimer, there are six distinct ways to choose a pair of termini,
and each choice may lead to more than one response pathway in stretching.
Here and below, the termini in CD48 will be denoted by N and C whereas
those in 2B4 by N′ and C′ , see Fig. 1.
Stretching is applied along the line connecting the two chosen termini.
To describe the shift in the orientation of stretching in the protocols discussed below, we introduce an angle θ between the C-C′ direction and other
directions of stretching. We obtain θ(N-N′ )=68◦ , θ(N-C′ )=16◦, θ(C-N′ )=23◦ ,
θ(N-C)=28◦ , and θ(N′ -C′ )=38◦ .

3.1

Dissociation

We ﬁrst discuss situations in which the two termini deﬁning the pulling direction belong to diﬀerent protein chains. This way of pulling results in
mechanically induced dissociation of the two proteins.
3.1.1

N-N′ protocol

It is useful to ﬁrst consider the N-N′ protocol, in which the pulling springs
are attached to the N-termini of CD48 and 2B4. We observe existence of two
10

kinds of dissociation pathways, as illustrated in Fig.3. In both of them, there
is no breaking of contacts within 2B4 because the disulﬁde bond between
Cys 3 and Cys 100 holds the chain in a sturdy manner.
On the ﬁrst pathway, protein CD48 unfolds partially through unzipping
giving rise to a minor force peak at the spring displacement d of about 55 Å.
This force peak is associated with breaking of contacts between the β1 -β2
and the β7 -α1 loops, and between the β1 -β2 loop and the C-terminal tail of
CD48. The unzipping process stops at d of about 100 Å, when strands β1
and β2 in CD48 get fully unraveled. At d between about 100 Å and 120 Å,
the protein complex re-orients itself so that a tensile clamp between the two
proteins is formed, see the right-hand panel of Fig. 2. Then, at d of about
125 Å, all of the interface contacts break almost simultaneously, which yields
large response forces with Fmax of 2.2 ǫ/Å, which is comparable to that of the
I27 domain of titin [29].
On the second pathway, there is no appreciable unfolding within neither
of the two units. Instead, the two force peaks that are observed are due to
rupturing of the interface contacts. The contacts in patch b rupture at d of
about 55 Å, which is reﬂected in moderate response forces with Fmax of about
1.3 ǫ/Å. Then the contacts in patches a and c rupture almost simultaneously
at d of about 70 Å with a smaller force. In both rupturing events, we observe
tensile mechanical clamps. What prevents unraveling of CD48 on the second
pathway are the contacts between β1 and β9 ; these contacts break early
on the ﬁrst pathway but they never do on the second pathway. The ﬁrst
pathway occures more often but the level of dominance varies with the speed
of pulling, as shown in the top panel of Fig. S1 in Supporting Information
(SI).

11

3.1.2

N-C′ protocol

Pulling in the N-C′ protocol also results in two pathways that lead to separation of the protein complex, see Fig. 4. The two pathways are very similar
initially, at d < 80 Å, when β1 and β2 unravel. However, in the ﬁrst pathway,
Fmax of about 1.6 ǫ/Å arising at d ≈ 80 Å is due to shear between β2 and
β9 , and between β2 and β7 in CD48, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 4. The
inter-protein patches break later: ﬁrst patches a and c at d ≈ 100 Å and
then patch b at d of about 120 Å. The associated force peaks are smaller.
In the second pathway, unraveling of β1 and β2 gives rise only to a minor
force peak at d ≈ 80 Å. The next peak at d of about 110 Å is due to
rupturing of contacts in patch a. However, Fmax of about 1.8 ǫ/Å arises
when the contacts in patch b and those between β3 and β8 in CD48 break
simultaneously. These events occur at d of about 130 Å and are immediately
followed by the breakage of contacts in patch c at d ≈ 140 Å. The ﬁrst
pathway dominates and its statistical weight increases with decreasing speed
vp , see the middle panel of Fig. S1 in SI. In fact, the second pathway is never
observed at small pulling speeds (vp < 0.001 Å/τ ).
3.1.3

C-N′ and C-C′ protocols

In protocols C-N′ and C-C′ we observe only tensile eﬀects and no multiple
dissociation pathways. The corresponding F -d patterns and dissociation scenarios are shown in Fig. 5. For both protocols, no intra-protein contacts are
ruptured before the two units break loose. In the C-N′ protocol, the contacts
in patch b get broken at d of about 30 Å, which yields Fmax of about 1.3 ǫ/Å,
and then the contacts in patches a and c break simultaneously at d of about
45 Å with smaller forces. In the C-C′ protocol, the three patches break
simultaneously at d of about 35 Å, and Fmax increases to about 1.9 ǫ/Å.
12

3.2

Unfolding: N-C and N′ -C′ protocols

We now consider situations in which the two termini deﬁning the pulling
direction belong to the same protein chain. Pulling in the N′ -C′ protocol
results in a monotonic growth of F with d because of the tethering eﬀect
exerted by the disulﬁde bond between Cys 3 and Cys 100 in 2B4, see the
dashed line in Fig. 5. On the other hand, pulling in the N-C protocol results in
full unraveling of CD48 that can proceed along two pathways. The maximum
force arises either as the ﬁrst (pathway 1) or the third (pathway 2) peak in
the F -d curves, as indicated by arrows in the top panels in Fig. 6. The
values of Fmax are 1.7 ǫ/Å and 1.9 ǫ/Å, respectively. In the ﬁrst pathway,
the mechanical clamp is due to shearing between β1 and β9 in CD48, as
illustrated in the left-hand panel of Fig. 2. The shearing between β1 and β9
occures at d of about 30 Å. In the second pathway, the mechanical clamp
is due to shearing between β8 and β9 , and between β3 and β8 , which takes
place at d ≈ 140 Å.
Interestingly, the larger the sequential distance |i − j| of a contact, the
earlier its rupture takes place. The contacts in the inter-protein patches
get broken only after the tertiary structure in CD48 is destroyed. Each
of the patches acts coherently, but unlike what happens in the dissociative
protocols, individual patches get aﬀected at diﬀerent times.
We observe the same two pathways of CD48 unraveling in the presence
and absence of the partner protein 2B4, as indicated by the solid and dashed
lines in Fig. 6, respectively. Interestingly, as shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. S1, the ﬁrst pathway is statistically more relevant at intermediate pulling
speeds (0.0002 Å/τ < vp < 0.005 Å/τ ), and the second pathway dominates
at low and high pulling speeds.

13

3.3

Shear and tensile mechanical clamps

As discussed before, Fmax arises either as a result of shear between β-strands
in CD48 or due to the tensile clamps between CD48 and 2B4, depending on
the pulling protocol and pathway. The distinction between the two kinds of
mechanical clamps sits in the directionality of the movements of the residues
involved, as illustrated by the simulation snapshots in Fig. 2. However, it
also shows in the time dependence of the distances between the residues in
contacts that form the clamp. The left-hand panel of Fig. 7 shows three
such distances as a function of d in pathway 1 in the N-C protocol. These
distances correspond to three native contacts between β1 and β9 in CD48.
For d < 32 Å, the inter-residue distances rij ﬂuctuate around their native
values. At a critical distance of about 32 Å, shearing between the two βstrands leads to the simultaneous breaking of the three contacts, which is
reﬂected in the fast increase in the inter-residue distances rij from about
5 Å to about 35 Å. In the right-hand panel of Fig. 7, the three distances
rij correspond to contacts between CD48 and 2B4 in patches a, b and c,
respectively. The situation considered here relates to pathway 1 in the N-N′
protocol. For d < 125 Å, the inter-residue distances rij ﬂuctuate around their
native values. At a critical distance d ≈ 125 Å, the contacts in patches a, b
and c break simultaneously, which leads to a sudden increase in the distances
rij from about 10 Å to about 70 Å. The diﬀerence between the two clamps is
in the steepness and magnitude of the increase of the inter-residue distances
– from 5 to 35 Å, and from 10 to 70 Å in the case of shear and tensile clamps,
respectively. The simulation snapshots in Fig. 2 correspond, left-to-right, to
the panels of Fig. 7.

3.4

The velocity dependence

Our discussion so far has been focused mainly on trajectories obtained at
one particular speed of pulling, vp = 0.002 Å/τ . We now discuss how Fmax
varies with vp , see Fig. 8. We performed simulations at seven diﬀerent speeds
of pulling ranging from 10−4 Å/τ to 10−2 Å/τ , which corresponds to the experimental speeds between 10 nm/ms and 1 nm/µs. At each of the pulling
speeds we ran at least 60 trajectories. We separated the simulation data
into pathways, if any, and averaged over the trajectories. We ﬁnd an efective
logarithmic dependence [34, 35]
Fmax = p ln (vp /v0 ) + q

(3)

in the range of the speeds studied. Here, the unit of speed is v0 =1 Å/τ . The
ﬁtting parameters p and q are summarized in Table I. The parameter p describes how fast Fmax changes with vp . The range of variations in p is seen to
be within a factor of 1.5, which reﬂects anisotropy eﬀects. Interestingly, the
two pathways of the N-C protocol exhibit almost identical values of the parameter p. The slowest dependence is observed for the C-N′ protocol whereas
the most rapid one is seen for the second pathway of the N-N′ protocol.
Assuming the Bell-Evans model [34, 35] in which

 ‡

(4)

one can extract the intrinsic oﬀ-rates of the interacting proteins, k0 , and
the location of the free-energy barriers conﬁning the proteins in their bound
state, x‡ , from the ﬁtting parameters p and q. Comparison of Eqs. (3) and
(4) gives x‡ = kB T /p and k0 = e−q/p Kv0 /p. The resulting values of k0 and
x‡ are summarized in Table I. In case of deviations from the logarithmic
dependence (4), one can use more sophisticated theories [36] that permit to
extract also the height of the free-energy barriers ∆G‡ .
15

It is interesting to observe that the smallest oﬀ-rates in Table I correspond
to either complete (protocol N-C) or partial (N-N′ pathway 1) unfolding of
CD48. The oﬀ-rates that correspond merely to dissociation (protocols C-C′ ,
C-N′ , and N-N′ pathway 2) are orders of magnitude larger. Nevertheless,
some values of k0 as given in Table I seem unreasonably small. They have
been obtained at T = 0.3 ǫ/kB . Higher temperatures should lead to their
substantial increase. Note that the room temperature is more likely to correspond to about 0.35 ǫ/kB (notice that the value of ǫ itself comes with about
25 % uncertainty [29]) and the physiological temperatures are still higher.
We note that when the pulling sites are the N- and C′ -termini, the second
pathway occurs only at the pulling speeds vp ≥ 0.001 Å/τ , which is indicated
by the absence of data points at small speeds vp < 0.001 Å/τ . To further
investigate this observation, we calculated the frequency of occurrence of
the ﬁrst pathway in protocols N-N′ , N-C′ and N-C. At a particular speed of
pulling, the frequency ν1 is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of trajectories
at which the ﬁrst pathway has occured to the total number of trajectories.
The occurrence frequency ν1 as a function of the pulling speed vp is shown in
Fig. S1. In the N-N′ protocol, the frequency ν1 varies between 0.6 and 0.95,
and attains the maximum value at vp = 10−3 Å/τ . In the N-C′ protocol, ν1
increases from 0.65 at vp = 10−2 Å/τ to 1 at vp = 10−3 Å/τ , and remains
constant, ν1 = 1, in the interval between vp = 10−3 Å/τ and vp = 10−4 Å/τ .
In the N-C protocol, the frequency ν1 increases with the speed vp in the
interval between vp = 10−4 Å/τ and vp = 10−3 Å/τ , and decreases with vp in
the interval from vp = 10−3 Å/τ to vp = 10−2 Å/τ , with the maximal value
of 0.7 at vp = 10−3 Å/τ . The error bars in Fig. S1 indicate the standard
deviation of the Bernoulli process.
We now turn our attention to the process of CD48-2B4 separation. The

16

separation event takes place at the moment when no contacts are present
between CD48 and 2B4 for the ﬁrst time on the trajectory. The corresponding spring displacement at which separation takes place will be denoted by
ds . Fig. S2 in SI shows that ds decreases with vp in a way that depends on
the protocol and the pathway. Its most signiﬁcant dependence is observed
for pathway 2 in protocal N-C′ , which is the pathway that ﬁnds no continuation at small speeds. The decrease in ds reﬂects the greater role of thermal
ﬂuctuations at lower speeds since ﬂuctuations foster separation.
The spring displacement d does not directly relate to the end-to-end distance, L, between the pulling termini. In fact, L reﬂects transformations in
the structure in a more direct manner. Fig. S3 in SI shows that Ls – i.e. the
value of L corresponding to separation – also depends on vp , although usually
less sensitively. For instance, there is much less variation in Ls compared to
ds in the C-C′ protocol. On the other hand, they are about the same for
both pathways in the N-C′ protocol.

3.5

Stretching of the multidomain synaptotagmin 1

To our knowledge, there have been no single-molecule pulling experiments
performed on the CD48-2B4 complex. Thus the assumptions underlying
the construction of our model, especially about the relative strength of the
inter-protein contacts remain untested. To establish connections to force
spectroscopy experiments on membrane-associated multidomain proteins, we
performed pulling simulations of synaptotagmin 1. The latter protein is
involved in remodeling the plasma membrane during neurotransmitter release
at the synapse. The cytoplasmic region of synaptotagmin 1 contains two
domains, C2A and C2B, which together form the C2AB module. These
two domains are quite similar structurally but have been found to exhibit
17

diﬀerent mechanical stabilities within the C2AB module [24, 37].
The issue which is analogous to that pertaining to the CD48-2B4 complex
is whether it is indeed sensible to assume that the inter-domain contact
energy, which we denote here by ǫ′ , is about the same as the contact energy ǫ
within each domain. Fig. 9 shows a typical F -d curve and the corresponding
scenario diagram for ǫ′ = ǫ and vp = 0.002 Å/τ . The highest force peak
(labelled as B in Fig. 9) is associated with rupturing the core of the C2B
domain. The second highest peak (labeled as A in Fig. 9) arises when β1
and β2 of the C2A domain unravel. This event is followed by breaking the
C2AB interface, which results in a minor force peak (labeled by I in Fig. 9).
A typical simulation conﬁguration at this stage is depicted in the lower right
corner of Fig. 9. It is similar to the relevant conﬁguration obtained in steered
molecular dynamics simulations performed at a pulling speed that is three
orders of magnitude larger than used here [24].
After extrapolation to the experimental pulling speed, see Fig. 9, we
obtain the values of Fmax to be equal to (100 ± 30) pN and (70 ± 20) pN for
the force peaks B and A, respectively. These values are consistent with the
experimental results of about 100 pN and 50 pN (with the statistical error
of about 20 pN) for the C2B and C2A domains [24].
We now consider the situation in which ǫ′ is distinct from ǫ. We ﬁnd that
if ǫ′ = 2ǫ then the C2A domain becomes much more stable than the C2B
domain, which disagrees with experimental ﬁndings. On the other hand, if
ǫ′ = ǫ/2 then the second highest force peak becomes associated with rupturing the core of the C2A domain rather than with unraveling of β1 and β2 ,
see Fig. S4 in SI. However, the characteristic forces (1.6 ǫ/Å and 1.75 ǫ/Å
for C2A and C2B, respectively, at vp = 0.002 Å/τ ) are very close to those
A
B
presented in Fig. 9 (Fmax
= 1.6 ǫ/Å and Fmax
= 1.8 ǫ/Å) at the same speed

18

of pulling. Nevertheless, the appearance of the whole F -d pattern is much
closer to the experimental one when ǫ′ = ǫ than when ǫ′ is reduced. We
therefore conclude that assuming the equality of ǫ′ and ǫ is consistent with
the experimental results and with the similarity of the physical nature of the
interdomain contacts.

Conclusions

The mechanical stability of adhesion proteins and their complexes is necessary to sustain interactions and signaling between cells. To investigate the
mechanical stability of the adhesion protein complex CD48-2B4, we have performed pulling simulations using our coarse-grained structure-based model.
We ﬁnd that the force peaks arise either as a result of shear between β-strands
in CD48 or due to tensile mechanical clamps between CD48 and 2B4, depending on the mode of pulling and dissociation pathway. If there are several
force peaks in a given F (d) curve then, in general, the maximal one may be
associated with shear or with the tensile separation. In the former case, the
measurement of Fmax would not provide an estimate of the adhesion forces.
Table 10 provides a summary of our ﬁndings regarding the values of Fmax
for various protocols of stretching. For a given vp , the table is symmetric. We
present it in a way which gives values of Fmax for two pulling speeds: above
the diagonal the data correspond to vp of 5×10−3 Å/τ – the standard used in
our surveys of mechanostability [29] – and below the diagonal they correspond
to 6 × 10−6 Å/τ , which is in the lower range of speeds used in proteinrelated AFM experiments [29]. The highlighted diagonal blocks in the table
correspond to same-chain pulling which results either in structure unfolding
(N-C) or just deformation (N′ -C′ ). The oﬀ-diagonal blocks correspond to

19

pulling of diﬀerent chains which results in dissociation. The vp dependencies
are seen to be comparable in these two classes of pullings, and dissociation
may come either with a smaller or larger Fmax than unraveling.
We observe existence of strong anisotropies. For dissociation, Fmax varies
between 0.9 and 1.7 ǫ/Å at the extrapolated experimental speed. For unraveling – between 1.35 and 1.55 ǫ/Å. In the N-C protocol, and also on the ﬁrst
pathway of the N-C′ protocol, Fmax is caused by shear between β-strands in
CD48. In other pulling protocols, Fmax is due to tensile mechanical clamps
between CD48 and 2B4. It is important to note that the largest force signal
during dissociation may actually come from shearing and not tensile separation.
Both CD48 and 2B4 are anchored in membranes through the C-terminal
ends [23]. The forces acting on the CD48-2B4 complex during cell adhesion
are thus applied in the C-C′ direction (although membrane ﬂuctuations on
nanometer scales may alter this direction to some extent [38]). Interestingly,
we ﬁnd that in the C-C′ pulling simulations neither CD48 nor 2B4 unravels
(both proteins maintain their structure) and the entire CD48-2B4 interface
acts as a whole to resist external forces with Fmax = 1.4 ǫ/Å at the experimental speed of pulling. The latter value corresponds to about 150 pN. These
results suggest that the CD48-2B4 complex is adapted to resist signiﬁcant
forces while maintaining the structure of individual proteins. In particular,
the disulﬁde bond between Cys 3 and Cys 100 prevents the rupturing of
contacts within 2B4.
