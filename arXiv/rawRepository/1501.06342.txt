Abstract
Evolutionary dynamics has been classically studied for homogeneous
populations, but now there is a growing interest in the non-homogenous
case. One of the most important models has been proposed in [11], adapting
to a weighted directed graph the process described in [12]. The Markov
chain associated with the graph can be modified by erasing all non-trivial
loops in its state space, obtaining the so-called Embedded Markov chain
(EMC). The fixation probability remains unchanged, but the expected time
to absorption (fixation or extinction) is reduced. In this paper, we shall
use this idea to compute asymptotically the average fixation probability
for complete bipartite graphs Kn,m . To this end, we firstly review some
recent results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs trying to clarify some
points. We also revisit the ‘Star Theorem’ proved in [11] for the star
graphs K1,m . Theoretically, EMC techniques allow fast computation of
the fixation probability, but in practice this is not always true. Thus, in
the last part of the paper, we compare this algorithm with the standard
Monte Carlo method for some kind of complex networks.
Keywords: Evolutionary dynamics, Markov chain, Monte Carlo methods, fixation probability, expected fixation time, star and bipartite graphs.

Introduction and motivation

Population genetics studies the genetic composition of biological populations,
and the changes in this composition that result from the action of four different
processes: natural selection, random drift, mutation and migration. The modern
evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin’s thesis on natural selection and Mendel’s
theory of inheritance. According to this synthesis, the central object of study
in evolutionary dynamics is the frequency distribution of the alternative forms
1

(allele) that a hereditary unit (gene) can take in a population evolving under
these forces.
Many mathematical models have been proposed to understand evolutionary
process. Introduced in [12], the Moran model describes the change of gene
frequency by random drift on a population of finite fixed size. This model has
many variants, but we assume for simplicity that involved organisms are haploids
with only two possible alleles a and A for a given locus. Suppose there is a
single individual with a copy of the allele A. At each unit of time, one individual
is chosen at random for reproduction and its clonal offspring replaces another
individual chosen at random to die. To model natural selection, individuals with
the advantageous allele A are assumed to have relative fitness r > 1 as compared
with those with allele a of fitness 1.
Evolutionary dynamics has been classically studied for homogeneous populations, but it is a natural question to ask how non-homogeneous structures affect
this dynamics. In [11], a generalisation of the Moran process was introduced
by arranging the population on a directed graph, see also [13], [18] and [19].
In this model, each vertex represents an individual in the population, and the
offspring of each individual only replace direct successors, i.e. end-points of
edges with origin in this vertex. The fitness of an individual represents again its
reproductive rate which determines how often offspring takes over its neighbour
vertices, although these vertices do not have to be replaced in an equiprobable
way. The evolutionary process is described by the choice of stochastic matrix
W = (wij ) where wij denotes the probability that individual i places its offspring
into vertex j. In fact, further generalisations can be considered assuming that
the probability above is proportional to the product of a weight wij and the
fitness of the individual i. In this case, W does not need to be stochastic, but
non-negative. The fixation probability of the single individual i is the probability
that the progeny of i takes over the whole population. Several interesting and
important results are shown in [11]:
• Different graph structures support different dynamical behaviours amplifying
or suppressing the reproductive advantage of mutant individuals (with the
advantageous allele A) over the resident individuals (with the disadvantageous
allele a).
• An evolutionary process on a weighted directed graph (G, W ) is equivalent
to a Moran process (i.e. there is a fixation probability well-defined for any
individual, which coincides with the fixation probability in a homogeneous
population) if and only if (G, W ) is weight-balanced, i.e. for any vertex i the
PN
sum of the weights of entering edges w− (i) = j=1 wji and that of leaving
PN
edges w+ (i) = j=1 wij are equal. This is called the Circulation Theorem
in [11] and [13].
As in the classical setting, mutant individuals will either become extinct or take
over the whole population, reaching one of the two absorption states (extinction
or fixation), when a finite population is arranged on an undirected graph or
on a strongly connected directed graph (where two different vertices are always
connected by an edge-path). Even in the first case, the fixation probability
depends usually on the starting position of the mutant. The effect of this initial
placement on mutant spread has been discussed in [4, 5].

2

In the present paper, we start by summarising some fundamental ideas
and results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs. In this context, most work
involves computing the (average) fixation probability, but doing so in general
requires solving a system of 2N linear equations. In the example of the star
graph described in [11], like for other examples described in [3], [7] and [11], a
high degree of symmetry reduces the size of the linear system to a set of 2N
equations, which becomes asymptotically equivalent to a linear system with N
equations. We revisit this example that will be useful in addressing the study of
complete bipartite graphs. Another research direction has been to use Monte
Carlo techniques to implement numerical simulations, but often limited to small
graphs [4], small random modification of regular graphs [16] or graphs evolving
under random drift [17].
Our aim is to show how to modify the stochastic process associated with a
weighted directed graph to simplify the evolutionary process both analytically
and numerically. Recall that an evolutionary process on a weighted directed
graph (G, W ) with N vertices is a Markov chain with 2N states representing
the vertex sets inhabited by mutant individuals and transition matrix P derived
from W . The non-zero entries of P can be used to see the state space as a
(weighted) directed graph. We call loop-erasing the loop suppression in this
graph S, avoiding to remain in the same state in two consecutive steps and
providing the Embedded Markov chain (EMC) associated to the process. This
technique is used here to compute asymptotically the average fixation probability
for complete bipartite graphs, generalising the Star Theorem of [11], see also [1],
[9] and [21]. Expected time to absorption (fixation or extinction) of this EMC
has been studied for circular, complete and star graphs in [7]. Here we compare
numerically the expected absorption time of both chains on some kinds of
complex networks. This method can be combined with other approximation
methods (like the FPRAS method described in [6] for undirected graphs) to
obtain a fast approximation scheme.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review the Moran model
for homogeneous and non-homogeneous populations. In Section 3, we revisit the
Star Theorem giving an alternative proof of it. In Section 4, we briefly explain
the machinery of the loop-erasing method and we use this idea to describe the
asymptotic behaviour of the fixation probability on the complete bipartite graphs
family. At the end, in Section 5, we include some numerical experiments to
evaluate the performance of the Monte Carlo method on both the standard and
the loop-erased chains for different complex networks.

Review of Moran process

The Moran process models random drift and natural selection for finite homogeneous populations [12]. As indicated before, we consider a haploid population
of N individuals having only two possible alleles a and A for a given locus. At
the beginning, all individuals have the allele a. Then one resident individual is
chosen at random and replaced by a mutant having the neutral or advantageous
allele A. At successive steps, one randomly chosen individual replicates with
probability proportional to the fitness r ≥ 1 and its offspring replaces one individual randomly chosen to be eliminated, see Figure 1. Since the future state
depends only on the present state, the Moran process is a Markov chain Xn

Figure 1: Classical Moran process
with state space S = {0, . . . , N } representing the number of mutant individuals
with the allele A at the time step n. This is a stationary process because the
probability Pi,j = P[Xn+1 = j|Xn = i] to pass from i to j mutant individuals
does not depend on the time n. In fact, the number of mutant individuals can
change at most by one at each step and hence the transition matrix P = (Pi,j )
is a tridiagonal matrix where Pi,j = 0 if j 6= i − 1, i, i + 1. As P0,0 = PN,N = 1,
the states i = 0 and i = N are absorbing, whereas the other states are transient.
The fixation probability of i mutant individuals
Φi = Φi (r) = P[∃n ≥ 0 : Xn = N |X0 = i]
is the solution of the system of linear equations:
Φ0 = 0
Φi = Pi,i−1 Φi−1 + Pi,i Φi + Pi,i+1 Φi+1

(1)

ΦN = 1
where Pi,i = 1−Pi,i−1 −Pi,i+1 . In particular, the probability of a single mutant to
reach fixation Φ1 = Φ1 (r) is usually referred to as the fixation probability in short.
PN
To solve (1), we define yi = Φi −Φi−1 which verifies i=1 yi = ΦN −Φ0 = 1. Then,
dividing each side of (1) by Pi,i+1 , we have yi+1 = γi yi where γi = Pi,i−1 /Pi,i+1
Qi−1
is the death-birth rate. It follows yi = Φ1 j=1 γj , and hence the fixation
probability is

See [10], [22] and [14].
If neither of alleles a and A is advantageous reproductively, the random
drift phenomenon is modelled by the Moran process with fitness r = 1, and (2)
becomes Φ1 = 1/N . On the contrary, if mutant individuals with the allele A
have fitness r 6= 1 according to the hypothesis of natural selection, then γi = 1/r

Moran process on graphs
The Moran process for non-homogenous populations represented by graphs was
introduced in [11]. Like for finite homogenous populations, the first natural
4

question is to determine the chance that the offspring of a mutant individual
having an advantageous allele spreads through the graph reaching any vertex.
But this chance depends obviously on the initial position of the individual
(see [4, 5]) and the global graph structure may significantly modify the balance
between random drift and natural selection observed in homogeneous populations
as proved in [11].
Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph, where V = {1, . . . , N } is the set of
vertices and E is the set of edges. We assume that G is finite, connected
and simple graph (without loops or multiple edges). Thus E is a subset of
{(i, j) ∈ V × V | i 6= j}. An evolutionary process on G is again a Markov chain,
but each state is now described by a set of vertices S ∈ S = P(V ) inhabited by
mutant individuals having a neutral or advantageous allele A. This reproductive
advantage is measured by the fitness r ≥ 1. The transition probabilities of
this Markov chain are defined from a non-negative matrix W = (wij ) satisfying
wij = 0 ⇔ (i, j) ∈
/ E. More precisely, the transition probability between two
states S, S 0 ∈ S is given by

weights of the mutant and resident individuals, equal to r|S| + N − |S| =
N + (r − 1)|S| when the matrix W is stochastic. Note that S is the vertex set
of a directed graph G where two states S and S 0 are joined by an edge if and
only if PS,S 0 6= 0. Thus, the Moran process on a weighted directed graph (G, W )
is the random walk on G defined by the 2N × 2N stochastic matrix P = (PS,S 0 ).
The fixation probability of any set S inhabited by mutant individuals
ΦS = ΦS (G, W, r) = P[∃n ≥ 0 : Xn = V |X0 = S]
is still obtained as the solution of the linear equation
P Φ = Φ,

(5)

which is analogous to (1) for the classical Moran process. As in this case, S = ∅
and S = V are absorbing states, but there may be other states of this type,
as well as other recurrent states, so the probability that resident or mutant
individuals reach fixation can be strictly less than 1. However, it is well-known
(see [23, Sec. III.7]) that (5) has a unique solution if the only recurrent states
are ∅ and V . Thus, the population will still reach one of the two absorbing
states: extinction or fixation of mutant individuals. If there are other recurrent
states, absorbing or not, (5) will have further solutions if no other restrictions
are imposed, see the two-sources digraph below. But the probability of reaching

V from those states is 0, so adding these boundary conditions, the uniqueness of

In this context, the fixation probability depends on the starting position of
the mutant in the graph. This justifies the following definition: for any weighted

Complete graph Let KN be the complete graph with vertex set V =
{1, . . . , N } and edge set E = {(i, j) ∈ V × V | i =
6 j}. The classical Moran
process is the Moran process on G = KN defined by the stochastic matrix
W = (wij ) where wij = N 1−1 if i =
6 j, see Figure 2. Since G is symmetric
(i.e. the automorphism group Aut(G) acts transitively on V and E) and W is
preserved by the action of Aut(G), Φ{i} = Φ{j} for all i 6= j, and then ΦA = Φ{i}
for all i.
Weight-balanced graph Assume that (G, W ) is weight-balanced so that the
PN
sum of the weights of entering edges w− (i) = j=1 wji and that of leaving edges
PN
w+ (i) = j=1 wij are equal for any vertex i ∈ V . According to the Circulation
Theorem of [11], the number of elements of each state of the Moran process
on (G, W ) ‘performs’ a biased random walk on the integer interval [0, N ] with
forward bias r > 1 and absorbing states 0 and N , see Figure 3. Reciprocally, if the
Moran process on (G, W ) reduces to this process, then (G, W ) is weight-balanced.

Two-sources digraph Let G be a directed graph consisting of two vertices
(labelled 1 and 2) having leaving degree 1 and one vertex (labelled 3) having
entering degree 2, see Figure 4(a). There are four recurrent states {1}, {2}, {1, 3}
and {2, 3}, the average extinction probability is equal to 1/3, and the average
fixation probability is equal to 0. Nonetheless, there is another state {1, 2}
having fixation probability equal to 1, see Figure 4(b).

Star graphs revisited

Lieberman et al. showed in [11] there are some graph structures, for example
star structures, acting as evolutionary amplifiers favouring advantageous alleles.
The evolutionary dynamics on stars graphs has been also studied in [3]. We
revisit here this example that is useful to understand the role of symmetry for
computing fixation probabilities. A star graph G consists of N = m + 1 vertices
labelled 0, 1, . . . , m where only the centre 0 is connected with the peripheral
vertices 1, . . . , m, see Figure 5. Since Aut(G) acts transitively on the peripheral
vertices, the state space reduces to a set of 2N ordered pairs. The fixation
probability of the state (i, ε) is denoted by
Φi,ε = P[∃n ≥ 0 : Xn = (m, 1)|X0 = (i, ε)],
where i is the number of peripheral vertices inhabited by mutant individuals and
ε ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether or not there is a mutant individual at the centre.

Loop-erasing on complete bipartite graphs

Let us consider a Moran process on a weighted directed graph (G, W ). This is a
random walk on the directed graph G whose vertex set is S and whose transition
matrix P = (PS,S 0 ) is given by (4). Two states S, S 0 ∈ S are connected by an
edge in G if and only if PS,S 0 6= 0. Let Ĝ be the directed graph obtained by
suppressing any loop in G that connects a non-absorbing state S to itself. For
any pair S, S 0 ∈ S such that S is non-absorbing, the transition probability PS,S 0
is replaced by

The biased random walk described in Figure 3 arises by loop-erasing in any

Assuming that ∅ and V are the only recurrent states in G, we know the
population will reach one of these two absorbing states, fixation or extinction,
from any other subset S ⊂ V inhabited by mutant individuals. Moreover, the
transition matrix P admits a box decomposition

where (Id − Q̂)−1 = n≥0 Q̂n . The vector τ̂S represents the expected number
of state transitions until absorption when the Moran process starts from a set
S. This quantity has been studied in [7] for circular, complete and star graphs.
Since transition may not happen at every step, the following result is clear:
Proposition 4.1. Let τ be the expected absorption time for the Moran process
on a weighted directed graph (G, W ). Let τ̂ be the expected absorption time for
the process obtained by applying the loop-erasing method. Then for each transient
state S ∈ ST , we have τ̂S ≤ τS .
For unweighted and undirected graphs, Dı́az et al. show in [6] that, with high
probability, the expected absorption time is bounded by a polynomial in N of
order 3, 4 and 6 when r < 1, r > 1 and r = 1. They have also constructed a fully
polynomial randomised approximation scheme for the probability of fixation
and extinction. The loop-erasing method can be used to reduce the expected
absorption time making the approximation of the fixation probability faster. We
explore this path in Section 5.

Complete bipartite graph
Now, we use the loop-erasing method to calculate the asymptotic fixation
probability of any complete bipartite graph. Recall that a complete bipartite

11

graph is a graph Km1 ,m2 whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets
V1 = {1, . . . , m1 } and V2 = {1, . . . , m2 } such that every edge connects a vertex
in V1 to one in V2 . In particular, a star graph is a bipartite graph Km,1 . The
fixation probability for these graphs has been also studied in [9] and [21].
According to the Circulation Theorem, as any vertex has the same number
of connections, the evolutionary process on the complete bipartite graph Km,m
is equivalent to the Moran process, so they have the same fixation probability,
see Figures 8(b) and 10(b).
For a bipartite graph Km1 ,m2 with m1 6= m2 , like for star graphs, the state
space reduces to the product S = {0, 1, . . . , m1 } × {0, 1, . . . , m2 } where each
ordered pair (i, j) ∈ S indicates that there are i vertices in V1 and j vertices in
V2 inhabited by mutant individuals. The evolutionary dynamics is described by
the system of linear equations

Figure 9: State space of a bipartite graph
Figure 9. But neither this reduced process (random walk on G), nor the process
obtained by loop-erasing (random walk on the directed graph Ĝ obtained by
suppressing every loop connecting a non-absorbing state with itself) admit global
symmetries. Note that states (i, m2 ) in the last row are never related to states
(i, j) with 1 ≤ j < m2 by automorphisms of the weighted directed graphs G
and Ĝ. Nevertheless, we prove that the map sending the state (i, j) to the state
(i, j − 1) with 1 < j ≤ m2 becomes more and more close to a symmetry of the
Embedded Markov chain when m1 → +∞. Using the previous calculation of
the asymptotic fixation probability for a star graph, we obtain the following
theorem, that is also illustrated numerically in Figure 10.
Theorem 4.2. Let ΦA (Km1 ,m2 , r) be the average fixation probability of a single
mutant individual having a neutral or advantageous allele A with fitness r ≥ 1
in a Moran process on a complete bipartite graph Km1 ,m2 . Then

Numerical experiments in complex networks

Proposition 4.1 says that the expected number of steps until absorption in the
loop-erased Markov chain is smaller or equal than that in the standard one.
15

Figure 11: Average computation times (in seconds) for Moran processes on
small-world networks (Watts-Strogatz β-model) using EMC and SMC methods
for all r going from 0 to 10 with step size of 0.25.
At first glance, this seems to imply that Monte Carlo method on the EMC
(EMC method from now on) will stop before Monte Carlo on the standard chain,
(Standard Monte Carlo or SMC method from now on), but there is a subtle
difference between what the method does theoretically and what the computer
actually does.
First of all, we need to construct a weighted directed graph G having 2n states.
It is almost always unfeasible when n is relatively large, but it is easier for highly
symmetric graphs. So simulations reproduce how individuals randomly spawn
and die. In the SMC method, at each step, the chance of selecting a mutant
individual for reproduction is proportional to the fitness r ≥ 1. This uniformity
allows us to update the new transition probabilities in constant time. However,
in the EMC method the probability of choosing each individual for reproduction
depends not only on its fitness but also on the fitness of its neighbours. More
precisely, the probability that a particular mutant individual v leaves offspring
at a particular time is proportional to the number of resident neighbours of v
at that time. Similarly, if v is a resident individual, the probability of choosing
it for reproduction is proportional to the number of mutant neighbours. Thus,
if w is the neighbour of v chosen to die, the EMC method needs to update the
transition probabilities of each neighbour of w. On some graphs, this may lead
to longer computation times.
We compared the amount of time it takes to end the simulations for the
two methods in a series of well-known complex network models. All simulations
were done on a computer running MacOS X 10.9.3 with a quad-core i5 at
2.5GHz and 8Gb of RAM. Graph construction and manipulation was done in
Sage/NetworkX [8, 20], but the simulation routines were written in C.

Small-world networks
Small-world networks were introduced in [24] as a family of random graphs with
some properties of real networks. The construction is as follows: consider a
circular graph of order n and connect the k nearest neighbours. Now, each edge

16

Figure 12: Average computation times (in seconds) for Moran processes on
scale-free networks (Barabási-Albert preferential attachment model) using EMC
and SMC methods for r going from 0 to 10 with step size of 0.25.
uv in the previous graph can be replaced with another edge uw with probability
p. The resulting graph may be disconnected.
We did the following experiment to test the speed of the two methods: Fixed
k = 4, for any n ∈ {10, 20, . . . , 100} and p ∈ {0, 0.05, . . . , 1},
• we construct 10 random graphs with parameters n and p;
• for each of these graphs, we compute the average fixation probability using
both methods 3 times with 1000 trials for every fitness r varying from 0 to 10
with step size of 0.25.
Averaging the 30 running times of each method we get an average computation
time for both algorithms on the family of small-world networks with the prescribed parameters. The results are shown in Figure 11. As can be seen, the
EMC method performs better than the SMC method on this family of networks.

Scale-free networks
The previous family of graphs lacked a fairly common property of real networks,
namely a power-law degree distribution. In [2] the preferential attachment model
was developed to solve the shortcomings of previous models. Start with m
vertices connected in no way. Then one single vertex is added and connected to
the initial vertices to obtain a star. At successive steps, another single vertex is
added and connected to m of the previous vertices with probability ‘proportional’
to the degree. After n − m steps, the graph has n vertices and (n − m)m edges.
In the real world, one expect to have small m compared to n as the global
population is large and people known just a very small portion of the population.
We ran a similar experiment as for small-world networks, using both methods
3 times for 10 random graphs with 1000 trials for every fitness r varying from 0 to
10 in 40 evenly disposed steps, but new relevant parameters are now the order of
the graph n ∈ {100, 200, . . . , 1000} and the ratio m/n ∈ {0.005, 0.01, . . . , 0.05}.
Thus, a point (n, m/n) in the plot corresponds to the average computation time

on the random family with parameters n and m = bn · m/nc. The size of the
population n has been multiplied by 10 with respect to the size of the small-world
networks in the previous sample because we need to consider a population with
n ≤ 100 individuals if m/n = 0.01 and n ≥ 200 individuals if m/n = 0.005. The
result of the simulation can be seen in Figure 12. The SMC method performance
is specially bad on graphs obtained by Barabási-Albert preferential attachment
with m = 1, whereas EMC method performs badly on the models with ‘large’
m where high degree vertices appear. Star graphs can be interpreted as graphs
obtained by Barabási-Albert preferential attachment in a single step. According
to this interpretation, SMC method should improve the average computation
times obtained by the EMC method. In Table 1, we compare these times on
some star and complete bipartite graphs with the same number of trials and
values of the fitness r.

Hierarchical networks
In [15], a deterministic network was introduced as a heuristic model of metabolic
networks (it can be seen in Figure 13(a)). The graph has a power law distribution
of the degree (scale-free topology) and mean clustering coefficient non-decreasing
with size.
The network is constructed inductively. In the first step, we define the
network R0 as the complete graph of order four K4 . Fix one vertex as the central
vertex. The rest of the vertices are external vertices. Now, take three copies of
R0 and join their external vertices with the central one of the original R0 and
their central vertices together making a big triangle. The central vertex of the
resulting graph R1 is the central vertex of the original R0 . The external vertices
of R1 are the vertices of the other copies of R0 . You can repeat the process as
many times as needed, obtaining graphs Rn of order 4n+1 .

We computed the average fixation probability and the average computation
time on this family for the same values of fitness and trials as before. The results
can be seen in Figure 13(b) and Table 2. As one can see, the EMC method
outperforms the SMC method by an increasing factor on the order n of the
network.

Conclusion

In this paper, we review some fundamental ideas and results on evolutionary
dynamics as introduced in [11] generalising the classic process described in [12].
But we also give insights on one of the major problems in this theory, to estimate
the average fixation probability of a mutant with relative fitness r on a given
graph. Exact solutions have only been computed for a few families of graphs [3]
as, generally, one should solve a linear equation systems of 2N equations, where
N is the order of the graph. Even asymptotic behaviour is tricky to compute.
The erasing of loops in the state space is the geometrical counterpart of a well
known device in Markov chains, which is the basis behind embedded processes

19

and which consists of forcing the processes to evolve in each iteration. It is
rather obvious and well known that the expected fixation time is reduced and the
fixation probability is unchanged by this procedure. In this paper, we use this
idea to compute asymptotically the fixation probability for the class of complete
bipartite graphs, generalising the result of [11] for the star graph. In this case,
the high degree symmetry reduces the problem to a set of 2N equations, which
is asymptotically equivalent to a simpler linear system of N equations. For
complete bipartite graphs, after erasing all non-trivial loops, partial symmetries
arise asymptotically in the Moran process and reduce the Moran process to the
particular case of a star graph. This is an important step since it shed some new
light on the asymptotic behaviour of the fixation on bipartite graphs, which has
recently been dealt with from other points of view in [9] and [21].
In practice, the Monte Carlo on the Embedded Markov chain (EMC method)
may need to make more computations than the Monte Carlo method on the
standard chain (SMC method), as it needs to keep track of different probabilities
(one per vertex) that should be computed at runtime. We tested the speed of the
new method in some celebrated families of graphs: the small world networks [24],
preferential attachment networks [2] and hierarchical networks [15]. These tests
show the EMC method defeats the SMC method on large families of graphs, but
not in all examples, as transition probabilities on the loop-erased chain depends
heavily on the actual state. At first, the appearance of high degree vertices
might look like culprit for this problem, but this is not the case: the hierarchical
network of [15] has extremely large degree on some vertices. Although it is still
unknown what makes EMC method become slower, we believe this method could
be applied successfully to real networks.
Globally, we think the present paper represents substantial progress towards
understanding the complexity behind evolutionary dynamics on graphs.
