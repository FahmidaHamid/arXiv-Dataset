We show that for two identical neuronal oscillators with strictly postive phase restting curve,
isochronous synchrony is an unstable attractor and arbitrarily weak noise can destroy entraiment
and generate intemittent phase slips. Small inhomogeneity–mismatch in the intrinsic firing rate of
the neurons– can stabilize the phase locking and lead to more precise relative spike timing of the two
neurons. The results can explain how for a class of neuronal models, including leaky itegrate-fire
model, inhomogeneity can increase correlation of spike trains when the neurons are synaptically
connected.

Synchronization observed frequently in the vast variety
of physical, chemical, industrial, and biological complex
systems, from coupled pendulum clocks to neuronal populations in the nervous system [1–10]. In these systems,
ability to exhibit synchronous or phase locked oscillations, is the foundation of the emergent behaviors which
is the basis for the functionality of the system. While the
existence of robust synchronization is important in real
systems with different sources of noise and uncertainties
in parameters, stability of this behavior has a central
importance [4]. Recordings of multi-neuron spike trains
have revealed significant interdependencies between the
firing of different neurons in a population [11–16]. Synchronous oscillations are found in many brain regions and
excessive synchrony is a hallmark of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease [17]. Functional role of the correlation in neural coding has been
debated in recent years [18–23]. Synchrony itself may
encode information directly [10, 14, 16, 24–27]. Synchronous firing of the neurons in one region serves to reliably transmit signals to upstream regions [28–30], while
synchrony between different regions can prepare dynamic
channels for communication [31–33] and also undelies feature binding [34]. Beyond the functional role, it is also
important to understand how correlation and synchrony
depend on biophysical parameters of the neurons and the
network.
Correlation between spike trains of neurons can arise
from shared input they receive from other neurons [35–
39], or from presence of direct synaptic connections between neurons [40–43]. In both cases the collective state
of the system depends on the parameter of neurons,
e.g., firing rate and the type of the excitability of neurons [44], and the parameters of the connections such
as delay [45]. Physiological heterogeneity can destabilize
both coupling-induced and correlation-induced synchronization [46–48]. In the classical models of synchronization, collective state of a system of coupled oscillators is
determined by outcome of rivalry between synchronizing
effect of connections and desynchronizing effect of inho-

mogeneity [3], but there are examples of the systems in
which synchrony is enhanced by inhomogeneity [49, 50].
Recently we have shown that small inhomogeneity can
increase correlation between spike trains of two coupled
neurons [51]. In this sudy we give a general framework for
the correlation of coupled phase oscillators with a given
phase sensitivity. We show that for identical pulse coupled type-I oscillators, synchronized state is an unstable
attractor and arbitrarily weak noise can destabilize this
state and the spiking of two neurons exhibit intermittent
phase slips between epochs of locking. Small inhomogeneity in firing rates can stabilize the system by providing an asymmetric basin of attraction around the stable
phase-locked state. This in turn results in a sharper PDF
for the time difference between spikes of the two neurons in presence of noise. We have also shown that while
for the model neurons with biologically realistic phase
response curve (PRC), the time difference between the
spikes of two neurons in the stable state increases with
inhomogeneity, in the case of LIF neurons, they lock in
almost zero phase lag for sufficiently small values of inhomogeneity. By solving Fokker-Planck equation we also
find the most probable phase difference between spike
times of the two neurons and will show that it does not
coincide with the stable point of the deterministic equations.
Our model comprises two bidirectionally coupld neuronal oscillators recieving suprathreshold constant currents (I1 and I2 with mismatch ∆I) as well as independent stochastic inputs. The evolution of the state vector
of the oscillators Xi , i = 1, 2 can be descibed by
Ẋ1 = F (X1 ) + ǫg12 G12 (X1 , X2 ) + I1 + σξ1 (t) (1)
Ẋ2 = F (X2 ) + ǫg21 G21 (X2 , X1 ) + I2 + σξ2 (t), (2)
where F governs the internal dynamics of the neurons, G
detemines the synaptic connections, ξ is Gaussian white
noise with zero mean and unit variance, and ǫ and σ are
small values which scale strength of the couplings and the
stochatic inputs, respectively. We assume the each of the
unperturbed systems Ẋi = F (Xi ) has an asymptotically

We restrict the study to type-I oscillators and first discuss on the deterministic version of Eq. 4 with D = 0.
If H is an even function of φ, e.g. for QIF oscillators, the effective coupling term would be ∆gH(φ) with
∆g = g21 −g12 . In this case the most effective connection
is a unidirectional one and the symmetric connection has
no effect on the relative dynamics of the oscillators. Note
that for the oscillators with an oblique PRC, e.g. the LIF
oscillators, the coupling term can be non-zero for symmetric connections (see suplementary material Fig. S1).
The fixed point of Eq. 4 with D = 0 is the solution of ∆ω = g12 H (φ) − g21 H (−φ). For QIF oscillators Z (φ) = 1 − cos (φ) with asymmetric connections

are used to model diverse systems such as populations
of flashing fireflies and plate tectonics in earthquakes,
as well as networks of spiking neurons in the brain [56–
61]. It is assumed that the mismatch, coupling and noise
terms are of the same order, sufficiently weak such that
the intrinsic dynamics of isolated identical phase oscillators is dominant.
Using the method of averaging [62] we derive the the

FIG. 1. (A,B) Representative examples of the evolution of
the phase difference of two neurons for three different values
of mismatch in intrinsic frequencies. Larger values of mismatch have led to fewer phase slips. In A neurons are phase
oscillators with canonical type-I phase sensitivity and in B the
results are presented for LIF neurons. (C) The mean scape
time is plotted against frequency mismatch. Increasing effective coupling constant ∆g = g1 − g2 the maximum scape
time is seen in largar values of frequency mismatch. In (D)
the ratio of the firing rates of the coupled neurons is plotted.
For large values of mismatch the fixed point of 1 : 1 locking
vanishes.

zero-lag synchrony φ = 0 is an unstable attractor and
in the absence of noise, the oscillators can synchronize
isochronously. But a waek noise can destroy synchrony
and lead to phase slips. Mismatch in the intrinsic firing
rates of the neurons, stabilizes the fixed point through a
saddle-node bifurcation while moves the fixed point away
from zero. For small mismatch, this provides an asymmatric basin of attraction which is vulnerable to sufficiently large perturbations in one direction around the
fixed point. In the presence of noise the system shows
epochs of intermittent locking between which the relative phase of the oscillators slips by one cycle, while the
mean scape time from locked states increases with frequency mismatch (see Figs. 1A and B). The maximum
mean scape time from the locked state, is seen in a certain
value of mismatch (Fig. 1C) and for larger mismatches
∆ω > M ax{g12 H (φ) − g21 H (−φ)}, the fixed point corresponding to 1 : 1 locked state will disappear through
another saddle-node bifuracation (Fig. 3). To give more
concrete results on the impact of the inhomogeneity on
the correlation of the spike trains of the neuronal oscillators in presence of noise, we derive the Fokker-Planck
equation for the distribution of the phase difference of
two neurons, described by Eq. 4. We rewrite Eq. 4 in a

Figure 2A shows the steady state phase difference distribution for different values of the frequency mismatch
for QIF neuronal oscillators. It can be seen that the
distribution becomes narrower (with a more pronounced
peak) with increasing frequency mismatch while the neurons remain in 1 : 1 locked state, i.e. for the mismatch in
2
the range 0 ≤ ∆ω
∆g ≤ T . This reflects a larger basin of attraction for the locked state when mismatch is increased
from zero. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the basin of
attraction causes the distribution of the phase differences
not to peak in the fixed point of the deterministic equation, determined by Γ (φ∗ ) = 0. In turn, in presence of
noise the location of maximum phase difference satisfies,

which is derived by taking the derivative of ρ (φ) with
respect to φ, equal to zero. The location of the most
probable phase difference as a function of mismatch, detrermined by Eq. 8, is plotted in Fig. 2C for different
values of noise amplitude as well as for noiseless system
which shows the location of the fixed point. Presence of
noise inclines the distribution to larger phase differences
for small values of frequency mismatch. The maximum
difference between the location of most probable phase
difference between noiseless state and noisy state is seen
2
near ∆ω
∆g = 0 or T which reflects the most asymmetric
basin of attraction for the locked state and in turn the
locations coincide when φ∗ = π/2 where the basin of attraction is symmetric.

They don’t concide with the location of fixed point of the
deterministic equations (black curve).

Pfeuty et al. (2005) have introduced a variable Si (t)
which is equal to 1/δ when a neuron has fired a spike in a
time bin of size δ about time t and is equal to 0 otherwise
[64]. For sufficiently small δ the time average of Si is
the average firing rate of neuron i. It is shown that the
normalized cross-corellogram (CC) of this variable which
is the density of probability that neuron 2 to fire a spike
in a time bin of size δ a delay τ after a spike of neuron 1,
is related to the phase difference probability distribution

where h...i indicates averaging over time. A peak in CC
at a time lag τ shows phase locking of the activity of the
neurons. The sharper CC is indicator of a tighter locking.
To illustrate this effect we provide an expression for the
maximum value of the distribution fuction (or CC) as a

FIG. 3. The cross-correlogram of spike trains of two LIF
neurons C (τ ) shows that in presence of the mismatch cross
correlation is increased. The level of maximum correlation is
shown in the inset to highlight the increase due to the inhomogeneity.

The above equation
  is the same as Eq. 8 by substituting
∗
ρ (φ ) with C ∆ω
∆g . Figure 2B shows maximum value of
cross-correlation versus frequency mismatch for different
values of noise to coupling ratio which is resulted from
direct integration of Eq. 8. The result shows that the
maximum cross-correlation of the spike trains of the oscillators would be also maximum when the neurons are
not identical. This is a consequence of more precise relative spike timing of the two neurons in presence of inhomogeneity.
In this study we have shown that for two synaptically connected neuronal oscillators, more precise relative
spike timing can be achieved when the neurons receive
different levels of inputs and have different intrinsic firing rates. Consequently, cross-correlation of spike trains
of the neurons increases in presence of mismatch in intrinsic firing rates of neurons. While the results are presented for neuronal oscillators, they can find application
in general context of coupled limit cycle oscillators.

where Z (θ) is the infinitesimal phase response curve (PRC). We assumed that neurons natural frequencies have small
difference, ε∆ω = ω2 − ω1 , where ε confirms that the mismatch is of the order O (ε). Assuming Xi (t) ≃ X0 (θi (t))
and by the change of variable θi (t) = ωt + φi (t), the equations for the evolution of the relative phase of the oscillators
read:

FIG. S1. Examples of T × F function, F (φ) = g12 H (φ) − g21 H (−φ), for QIF oscillator (left) and LIF oscillator (right) for
different values of difference of the synaptic strengths. For the LIF oscillators with an uneven PRC the coupling term can be
non-zero for symmetric connections whereas for QIF oscillators with an even PRC the effective coupling is determined by the
difference of two reciprocal synaptic constants.

where ω = 2π/[logI − log(I − 1)]. First we focus on the deterministic case of Eq. S19 with D = 0. For QIF oscillator,
Z (φ) = 1 − cos (φ) is an even function of φ. Therefore it reduces to

where ∆g = g21 −g12 is the effective coupling constant. In this case the most effective coupling is that which maximizes
∆g. i.e., a unidirectional one and the symmetric connection leads to zero effective coupling ∆g = 0. But for LIF
neurons with uneven PRC Eq. S19 takes the form

Note that for the oscillators with an oblique PRC, e.g. the LIF oscillators, the effective coupling term can be non-zero
for symmetric connections (see Fig. S1). The fix points of general equation S19 with D = 0 are the cross points of
horizontal line T ∆ω and the curve described by F (φ) = g12 Z(φ) − g21 Z(−φ).
For type-I phase oscillators we rewrite Langevin Eq. S19 as

In Figure 2A we have shown the result of analytic solution for steady-stat phase difference distributions S28 and
that of direct numerical integration of of phase differential equations S7. For solving Eq. S28, we have used double int
function of MATLAB. In simulation, we integrate Eqs. S7 with Euler method and save spike times of each neuron.
Then we have used hist function in MATLAB to plot ρ.
It has been shown that in the weak coupling and weak noise limit, the cross-crologram (CC) and the phase difference
probability distribution function, ρ(φ), are related by
