In cells, most of cargos are transported by motor proteins along microtubule. Biophysically,
unidirectional motion of large number of motor proteins along a single track can be described by
totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). From which many meaningful properties,
such as the appearance of domain wall (defined as the borderline of high density and low density of
motor protein along motion track) and boundary layers, can be obtained. However, it is biologically
obvious that a single track may be occupied by different motor species. So previous studies based
on TASEP of one particle species are not reasonable enough to find more detailed properties of
the motion of motors along a single track. To address this problem, TASEP with two particle
species is discussed in this study. Theoretical methods to get densities of each particle species are
provided. Using these methods, phase transition related properties of particle densities are obtained.
Our analysis show that domain wall and boundary layer of single species densities always appear
simultaneously with those of the total particle density. The height of domain wall of total particle
density is equal to the summation of those of single species. Phase diagrams for typical model
parameters are also presented. The methods presented in this study can be generalized to analyze
TASEP with more particle species.

Many driven diffusion systems have been developed
to model intracellular motility [1, 2]. Among which,
one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is usually employed to describe the unidirectional motion of large number of motor proteins
along microtubule, the transcription process of RNA
polymerases along DNA, and the translation process of
ribosomes along messenger RNA transcript [3–5]. In
TASEP, motion track of particles is simplified to be a
one-dimensional lattice with length N + 1, particles enter the track at first/initiation site 0 provided site 0 is not
occupied, and leave track from last/termination site N .
If lattice site i + 1 is not occupied, the particle at lattice
site i will hop forward to site i+1 with given rate. Generally, particles may also detach into environment and end
their unidirectional motion from bulk lattice sites, and
new particles may attach to any one of unoccupied bulk
sites. In last decades, TASEP has been studied extensively, especially for phase transition related properties,
i.e., the appearance of domain wall (DW) and boundary layer (BL), which are usually driven by boundary
conditions [6–12]. However, in most of previous studies, the self-propelled particles are usually assumed to be
from the same species. But in cells, one protofilament
of microtubule may be occupied by motor proteins from
different species [13]. So, to know more detailed properties about the motion of motor proteins in real cells, the
usual TASEP should be generalized to include particles
from different species [14–17].

The simplest generalization is two-species ASEP,
which has been discussed in recent studies [18–21]. However, in almost all previous studies, no particle attachment/detachment is allowed to/from bulk sites of the
track, i.e. the site i for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. They usually assumed that one species enters track at site 0 and
leaves from site N , while the other species enters at site N
and leaves from site 0. Meanwhile, it is also assumed that
two-species pair (P1 )i (P2 )i+1 can change to (P2 )i (P1 )i+1 ,
i.e. forward hopping of one species is not blocked by the
other species. Here (Pk )i means there is a particle Pk
at site i. For convenience, the two particle species are
denoted by P1 and P2 respectively.
The TASEP discussed in this study also includes two
particle species. But both of them enter track at initiation site 0 and leave from termination site N , i.e.
they not only travel along the same track, but also
move to the same direction. Previous studies about
one species TASEP have shown that nontrivial attachment/detachment is one of the key driven factors to
the appearance of DW in particle density along track
[4, 7, 11, 22–24]. So, in this study, both of the two species
are allowed to attach to (and detach from) bulk sites of
the track. The same as in one species cases, we also called
this process “TASEP-LK” process [7].
Let ni and mi be occupation numbers of species P1 and
P2 at site i, respectively. Specifically ni = 1 means site
i is occupied by a particle P1 , while ni = 0 means site i
is not occupied by particle P1 . Because of the hard-core
exclusion, ni + mi = 0 or 1. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N − 1, the
time evolution of ni and mi are governed by following

2
equations
dni /dt = ni−1 (1 − ni − mi ) − ni (1 − ni+1 − mi+1 )
+ω1,A (1 − ni − mi ) − ω1,D ni ,
(1)
dmi /dt = qmi−1 (1 − ni − mi ) − qmi (1 − ni+1 − mi+1 )
+ω2,A (1 − ni − mi ) − ω2,D mi .
(2)
Where, for convenience, forward hopping rate of species
P1 is normalized to be unit, and forward hopping rate of
species P2 is assumed to be q ≤ 1. The attachment rate
of species Pk to any unoccupied bulk site i is denoted by
ωk,A , and the detachment rate of species Pk from bulk
sites is denoted by ωk,D . At initiation site i = 0 (left
boundary),
dn0 /dt = α1 (1 − n0 − m0 ) − n0 (1 − n1 − m1 ), (3)
dm0 /dt = α2 (1 − n0 − m0 ) − qm0 (1 − n1 − m1 ). (4)
Where αk is the entry rate of particle Pk from environment. While at termination site i = N (right boundary),
dnN /dt = nN −1 (1 − nN − mN ) − β1 nN ,
dmN /dt = qmN −1 (1 − nN − mN ) − β2 mN ,

(5)
(6)

with βk the leaving rate of particle Pk to environment.
In cells, hopping rate of particles is usually determined by their biochemical properties. For example, forward hopping of motor proteins, such as conventional
kinesin, is mechanochemically coupled with ATP hydrolysis. Each forward mechanical step is tightly coupled
with one ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, hopping rate is
determined by the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Meanwhile,
leaving rate of particles from motion track is also determined by their biochemical properties, or even the rate
of ATP hydrolysis. Therefore it is biophysically reasonable to assume that the ratio of leaving rate of the two
species β1 : β2 is equal to ratio of their forward hopping rate 1 : q. Meanwhile, experiments found that, if
the two heads of motor protein kinesin are both in ADP
binding state, then it will soon detach from microtubule.
This means that detachment rate of motor proteins are
also determined by their biochemical properties and the
rate of ATP hydrolysis. So, for convenience of theoretical
analysis, this study also assumes that ω1,D : ω2,D = 1 : q.
However, except their biochemical properties, entry rate
αk and attachment rate ωk,A of species Pk are also influenced by environmental conditions, especially their concentrations. So, the corresponding rate ratios may be
different from the ratio 1 : q of forward hopping rate.
Defining ρ1 (i) = hni i and ρ2 (i) = hmi i. By mean-field
approximation, for large track length N limit, equations
for steady state values of densities ρ1 and ρ2 can be obtained from Eqs. (1,2),
∂x Jk = q 1−k Ωk,A (1 − ρ1 − ρ2 ) − Ωρk ,

k = 1, 2. (7)

Where Jk = ρk (1−ρ1 −ρ2 ), Ωk,A = N ωk,A , Ω = N ω1,D =
N ω2,D /q =: N/ω, and 0 < x < 1. Note, this study
assumes that hni mi+1 i = ρ1 (i)ρ2 (i + 1), and in MFA

analysis the track length is normalized to be 1. From Eq.
(7), one can show that total particle density ρ = ρ1 + ρ2
satisfies
∂x J = KΩ(1 − ρ) − Ωρ,

(8)

where K = K1 + K2 = [ω1,A + ω2,A /q]/ω, and J = ρ(1 −
ρ). From Eqs. (3-6), one can show that at boundaries
x = 0, 1, particle densities ρ1 , ρ2 and ρ satisfy ρ1 (0) =
α1 , ρ2 (0) = α2 /q, and ρ(1) = ρ1 (1) + ρ2 (1) = 1 − β with
β = β1 = β2 /q.
Eq. (8) implies that the governing equation for total
density ρ is the same as the one in one-species “TASEPLK” process [26]. But with effective detachment rate
ΩD = Ω, effective attachment rate ΩA = KΩ, initiation
(entry) rate α = α1 + α2 /q, and termination (leaving)
rate β = β1 = β2 /q (see Fig.1). So total density ρ can be
obtained by the same method as in one-species “TASEPLK” process. But the main difficulty for two-species cases
is how to get single species densities ρ1 and ρ2 . Actually,
no reasonable boundary conditions at x = 1, i.e., values
of ρ1 (1) and ρ2 (1), can be derived from Eqs. (5,6). Meanwhile, properties of densities ρ1 and ρ2 are different from
the ones in one-species cases. For example, in one-species
“TASEP-LK” process, particle densities before and after
+
DW location xw satisfies ρ(x−
w ) + ρ(xw ) = 1. This is
because that across location xw , current J = ρ(1 − ρ) is
conserved. But for two-species process, particle densities
ρ1 , ρ2 do not satisfy this relation. Instead, conservation
of current Jk = ρk (1 − ρ) gives that across DW location,
density ratio ρ1 /ρ2 is not changed (see Fig.1). The plots
in Fig.1 imply that DWs of density ρ, ρ1 , ρ2 appear at
the same location. Further numerical calculations show
that their BLs also appear simultaneously, see Fig. S4 in
[25].

FIG. 1: (Color online) Mean density profiles obtained from
Eqs. (1-6)(black dotted line), and their mean-field approximations obtained from Eqs. (7,8) (cyan solid lines for ρ, red
dashdot lines for ρ1 , and blue dashed line for ρ2 ). Parameter
values used in calculations are (a) Ω1,A = 0.01, Ω2,A = 0.14,
α1 = 0.2, α2 = 0.09, and (b) Ω1,A = 0.1, Ω2,A = 0.05,
α1 = 0.1, α2 = 0.18. Other parameter values are N = 103 ,
q = 0.9, Ω1,D = Ω2,D /q = 0.1, β1 = β2 /q = 0.3. Total particle density ρ in both (a) and (b) is the same as the one in
usual “TASEP-LK” process with α = β = 0.3, and ΩD = 0.1,
ΩA = 0.15. Locations of domain wall for total density ρ and
single species densities ρ1 , ρ2 are the same. Across domain
wall location, current J = ρ(1 − ρ) and current Jk = ρk (1 − ρ)
for k = 1, 2 are all conserved.

3
Along motion track, density currents J, J1 , J2 always change continuously, even if corresponding densities ρ, ρ1 , ρ2 are discontinuous. At any location x
of the track, ρ(x− )[1 − ρ(x− )] = J(x− ) = J(x+ ) =
ρ(x+ )[1 − ρ(x+ )], and ρk (x− )[1 − ρ(x− )] = Jk (x− ) =
Jk (x+ ) = ρk (x+ )[1 − ρ(x+ )]. Through simple analysis, we obtained ρk (x− )/ρ(x− ) = ρk (x+ )/ρ(x+ ) or
ρ1 (x− )/ρ2 (x− ) = ρ1 (x+ )/ρ2 (x+ ). This relation also
holds at DW location xw .
As we have mentioned before, total density ρ can
be obtained from Eq. (8) with boundary conditions
ρ(0) = ρ1 (0) + ρ2 (0) = α1 + α2 /q and ρ(1) = 1 − β.
But, if DW exists between boundaries x = 0 and x = 1,
then without boundary value ρk (1), density ρk cannot be
directly determined by Eq. (7). Actually, with boundary value ρk (0), only the value of density ρk before DW
location xw can be directly obtained by Eq. (7). One of
the main aims of this study to find methods to get single
species density ρk along the whole track from Eq. (7),
but with only boundary values at x = 0.

and ∆ > 0 iff ∆k > 0. Therefore, DWs of total density
ρ and single species densities ρ1 and ρ2 always appear at
the same location, which is consistent with the finding in
numerical calculations (see Fig. 1).

can be obtained from Eq. (7). Note, the above method
to get single species density ρk is also applicable for the
cases where there exists BL in density ρ. BLs of single
species densities ρ1 , ρ2 and total density ρ are also appear
simultaneously.
If K = 1, Eq. (8) reduces to
(∂x ρ − Ω)(2ρ − 1) = 0,

(9)

which yields two solutions. The constant solution ρ ≡
1/2 coincides with the density ρl = K/(K + 1) given by
Langmuir kinetics (LK), and corresponds to the maximal
current (MC). The other solution which matches left or
right boundary condition is ρα (x) = Ωx + α or ρβ (x) =
Ωx+1−β −Ω. Using these three solution candidates and
based on the continuity of currents J, J1 , J2 , total density
ρ and single species densities ρ1 , ρ2 can be obtained [25].
Typical examples of ρ, ρ1 , ρ2 for K = 1 are plotted in Fig.
2, including the cases of low density (LD) phase (ρ <
1/2), high density (HD) phase (ρ > 1/2), the maximal
current (MC) phase (ρ = 1/2), as well as left and right
BLs. Where thick dotted lines are obtained by numerical
iterations of Eqs. (1-6), and others are obtained from
Eqs. (7,8) using the method presented here [25]. Fig. 2
shows that for large initiation rate α = α1 + α2 > 0.5,
left BL exists in both total density ρ and single species
densities ρ1 and ρ2 . Meanwhile, right BL may appear

for either large or small values of termination rate β.
Again, DW of single species density ρk occurs at the same
location as that of total density ρ. Which satisfies ∆k =
−
[ρk (x−
w )/ρ(xw )]∆ and ∆ = ∆1 + ∆2 .

The same line types as in Fig. 1 are used. (a) LD-BL phase
with α < 0.5 and β < 0.5; (b) BL-HD phase with α > 0.5 and
β < 0.5; (c) LD-DM-HD phase with α < 0.5 and β < 0.5;
(d) LD-MC-BL phase with α < 0.5 and β > 0.5; (e) BLMC-HD phase with α > 0.5 and β < 0.5; (f ) BL-MC-BL
phase with α > 0.5 and β > 0.5. Where α = α1 + α2 /q,
and β = β1 = β2 /q. Unless explicitly presented, in all the
following calculations q = 0.9 is used.

For special cases K = 1, phases of single species densities ρ1 and ρ2 may not be the same as that of total
density ρ. If ρ is in LD phase, then both ρ1 and ρ2 will
be in LD phase, see Fig. 2(a). However, when ρ is in HD
phase, one of the single species densities, or even both of
them, may still remain in LD phase, see Fig. 2(b,e). For
special cases K = 1, if initiation rate α and termination
rate β satisfy [25].
α > 1/2−Ω,

β > 1/2−Ω,

and

α+β > 1−Ω, (10)

then density ρ may be in maximal current phase (MC)
near right boundary x = 1, in which ρ ≡ 1/2 and current J = J1 + J2 = 1/4. Depends on rates αk and Ωk,A ,
single species density ρk may not be constant, and they
may increase or decrease along motion track. This is different from the cases in which density ρ is in LD or HD
phase. For those cases both ρ1 and ρ2 increase with x,
and with slops Ω1,A and Ω2,A /q, respectively, see Eqs.
(S7,S7) in [25]. It can be shown that when ρ ≡ 1/2,
slopes of ρ1 and ρ2 have same absolute value, but opposite signs. If Ω1,A α2 − Ω2,A α1 > 0 then ρ1 has positive slope, i.e. increases along the motion track, while
ρ2 has negative slope. Both ρ1 , ρ2 are also constants iff
Ω1,A α2 − Ω2,A α1 = 0, see Fig. S2 in [25].
Based on current continuity, and using expressions of
ρα and ρβ , which satisfy Eq. (7) with boundary conditions ρα (0) = α and ρβ (1) = β respectively, we found
that for K = 1, DW appears iff |α − β| < Ω and
α+β +Ω < 1 [25]. The DW lies at xw = (Ω+β −α)/(2Ω)

4
with height ∆ = 1 − α− β − Ω. The DW height of density
−
ρk can then be obtained by ∆k = [ρk (x−
w )/ρ(xw )]∆, see
Eqs. (S4,S5,S7,S8) in [25].
Using similar method as in [26], typical examples of
phase diagram of density ρ, for special cases K = 1, are
given in Fig. 3. Generally, density ρ may be in any one of
the seven possible phases, which include all combinations
of LD, MC, and HD. The lines in Figs. 3(b,c,e,f ) are
obtained by α2 = q(α − α1 ), since density ρ depends only
on the summation α = α1 + α2 /q.

FIG. 3: (Color online) Phase diagrams of total density ρ =
ρ1 + ρ2 obtained from stationary mean-field Eq.(8) with K =
1, Ω = 0.3 in (a,b,c), and Ω = 0.5 in (d,e,f ). (b,c) and
(e,f ) are phase diagrams in (α1 , α2 ) plane, which correspond
to β = 0.4 and β = 0.6, respectively (see the horizontal dotted
and dashed lines in (a,d)).

As mentioned in [7], due to particle-hole symmetry we
only need to discuss the “TASEP-LK” process for K ≥ 1.
For K > 1, the idea used in the special cases K = 1 can
also be employed to get single special density ρk [25].
Roughly speaking, total density ρ, as well as its locations of DW and BL, can be obtained from Eq. (8)
with boundary conditions ρ(0) = α = α1 + α2 /q and
ρ(1) = 1 − β = 1 − β1 = 1 − β2 /q. Then single species
density ρk in interval [0, xw ) can be obtain from Eq. (7)
with left boundary condition α1 or α2 /q. Finally, density ρk in interval (xw , 1] can be obtained from Eq. (7)
with left boundary condition ρk (x+
w ), which is given by
−
ρk (x+
w ) = ρk (xw ) + ∆k . The main difference from that in
special cases K = 1 is that Lambert function [27] should
be employed to help to get densities ρ and ρk [25].
For K > 1, properties of total density ρ are similar
as the ones of the one-species “TASEP-LK” process [7,
11], i.e. there may exist left or right boundary layer,
domain wall, or “Meissner” (M) phase, see Fig. 4. Here
“Meissner” phase means that density ρ satisfies 1/2 <
ρ < ρl = K/(K + 1), and is independent of initiation
rate α and termination rate β, see Fig. 4(f ). Properties
of single species density ρk may be different from ρ. For
example, if ρ lies in [0, 1/2] or [ρl , 1], it will increase along
the track. Otherwise, ρ decreases along the track. This is
because that ∂ρ = (K+1)Ω(ρ−ρl )/(2ρ−1), see Eq. (S20)

in [25]. Therefore, if there exists DW in (0, 1) and the
termination rate 1 − ρl < β < 1, then after DW location
xw , density ρ decreases monotonically. Otherwise, if 0 <
β < 1 − ρl , ρ will increase after xw . However, the results
in Fig. 4(b,c) show that, after DW location xw , the
monotonicity of ρk may be different from ρ.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Typical examples of density ρ for Ω =
0.1 and K = 1.5, i.e. ρl = K/(K + 1) = 0.6. (a) LD-DW-HD
phase, with α < 0.5 and β > 0.5; (b) LD-DW-HD phase, with
α < 0.5 and 1 − ρl < β < 0.5; (c) LD-DW-HD phase, with
α < 0.5 and 0 < β < 1 − ρl ; (d) HD phase, with α < 0.5 and
β < 1 − ρl ; (e) LD phase, with α < 0.5 and 1 − ρl < β < 0.5;
(f ) “Meissner” phase, with α ≥ 0.5 and β ≥ 0.5. Line types
are the same as in Fig. 1.

Previous analysis about special cases K = 1 has shown
that, if total density ρ is in MC phase, i.e. ρ ≡ 1/2, then
single species density ρk may not be constant. Similar
results hold for the general K > 1 cases. If β = 1 − ρl ,
then ρ ≡ ρl = K/(K + 1) is constant near right boundary
x = 1. The plots in Fig. S5 show that the corresponding
single species densities ρk may not be constant. Theoretical analysis gives that the monotonicity of ρk , when
ρ ≡ ρl is constant, is also determined by the sign of
Ω1,A α2 − Ω2,A α1 . With positive values of it, ρ1 increases,
while ρ2 decreases, along motion track. Both densities ρ1
and ρ2 will be constant iff Ω1,A α2 − Ω2,A α1 = 0, see [25]
for detailed analysis.
Examples of phase diagram of total density ρ in (α, β)
plane, for general cases K > 1, are plotted in Fig.
5(a,b,c). Similar as in the one-species “TASEP-LK”, BL
may appear at one or both of the two boundaries. DW
may appear in interval (0, 1), and density ρ may be in LD
phase (ρ < 1/2) or HD phase (ρ > 1/2). To show more
details about the “TASEP-LK” process, in Fig. 5 the
HD phase is divided into two different cases, HD1 phase
(1/2 < ρ < ρl = K/(k + 1)) and HD2 phase (ρ > ρl ).
From the phase diagram in (α, β) plane, phase diagrams
in any planes of parameter pair (σ1 , σ2 ) can be easily obtained. Where σk = α1 , α2 , β1 , β2 . Examples of phase
diagram in (α1 , α2 ) plane are plotted in Fig. 5(d,e,f ),
which are corresponding to the dotted horizontal lines in
Fig. 5(a,b,c) respectively. The above discussion about
the relationship between total density ρ and single species

5
density ρk implies that phase diagrams of density ρk are
the same as those of the total density ρ.
In summary, “TASEP-LK” process with two particle
species is discussed in this study. Different from previous studies about two-species TASEP, particle attachment/detachment to/from bulk sites of motion track is
allowed, both of the two particle species enter into the
track from the same boundary, and move unidirectionally to the same direction. The two particle species do
not change to each other, and do not change their locations even if they are adjacent to each other [18–21].
This study found that, domain walls and boundary layers of total particle density and single species densities
always appear simultaneously. The height of domain wall
of total density is equal to the summation of those of the
two single species. Based on these properties, theoretical
methods to obtain steady state densities of the two particle species are presented. Our results show that properties of single species densities may be different from
that of the total particle density. In this study, phase
diagrams of particle density in typical parameter planes
are also presented. The methods presented in this study
are also available to the analysis of “TASEP-LK” process
including more than two particle species. The results of
this study are helpful to further understandings of the
biophysical process of cargo transportation in living cells,
where one single protofilament of microtubule is actually
occupied by various kinds of cargos and motor proteins
[13, 28].

FIG. 5: (Color online) Phase diagrams of total density ρ obtained by stationary mean-field Eq.(8) for K > 1. Parameter
values used in calculations are Ω = 0.1, K = 1.5 for (a,d);

r , i.e., ρ is in LD phase, and it decreases sharply
at right boundary. (3) III:=LD-DW-HD1 , near left boundary
density ρ is in low density phase, while near right boundary ρ
is in high density phase, and there exists DW between these
two phases. Here “HD1 ” means ρ > ρl , i.e., β < 1 − ρl .
(4) IV:=LD-DW-HD2, where HD2 means that density ρ is

ρl but its value is independent of right boundary condition,
therefore right BL appears. Mr can be regarded as the right
half part of “Meissner” phase. For this phase, β > 0.5. (6)
