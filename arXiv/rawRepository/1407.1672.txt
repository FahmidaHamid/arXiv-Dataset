We study the effect of transmembrane proteins on the shape, composition and thermodynamic
stability of the surrounding membrane. When the coupling between membrane composition and
curvature is strong enough the nearby membrane composition and shape both undergo a transition
from over-damped to under-damped spatial variation, well before the membrane becomes unstable
in the bulk. This transition is associated with a change in the sign of the thermodynamic energy
and hence favors the early stages of coat assembly necessary for vesiculation (budding) and may
suppress the activity of mechanosensitive membrane channels and transporters. Our results suggest
an approach to obtain physical parameters of the membrane that are otherwise difficult to measure.

Biological membranes are crucial to the structure and
function of living cells [1]. Transmembrane proteins essential for transport, adhesion and signalling are embedded in membranes [2, 3] consisting of a mixture of lipids
and other amphipathic components. The interaction
with the adjacent lipid molecules is known to regulate
the function of membrane proteins [4–7]. Here, we are
primarily interested in the non-specific lipid-protein interactions that arise from the coupling of their hydrophobic regions [8–14], although we can also allow for selective
enrichment of membrane component(s) near the protein.
We employ a continuum theory in which small deformations of the lipid environment near a rigid inclusion can
be described by a number of local field variables, such as
the profile of the mid-plane of the bilayer, its composition and membrane thickness [15–36]. Furthermore, the
free-energy cost associated with thickness deformation is
completely decoupled at lowest order [21], and it can be
independently analyzed although we do not do so here.
We allow for selective enrichment/depletion of curvature sensitive inclusions in the vicinity of a membrane
protein or, equivalently, lipid asymmetry between leaflets
that is characterized by a local spontaneous curvature,
the preferred mean curvature in the absence of any mechanical stresses on the membrane [33–41]. This local
variation may be relatively large near a membrane protein if its geometry is such that it bends or deforms the
surrounding membrane (see Fig 1). Our approach leads
to a real-space description of the membrane around an
inclusion of arbitrary symmetry.

FIG. 1. (color on-line) Sketch of a membrane inclusion showing the mid-plane of the bilayer (blue line) at height u(r, θ).
The surface variation of the rigid inclusion in the ẑ direction is coarse-grained out so that the geometry is defined by
its radius r0 and two functions describing the height U(θ)
and contact angle U 0 (θ) of the hydrophobic belt. These parameterize the protein-membrane interface (red line), where
u(r0 , θ) = U(θ) and n̂ · ∇u(r0 , θ) = U 0 (θ), with n̂ as the inward unit normal vector. We require both the normal force
and the torque on the inclusion to vanish. The latter can lead
to an equilibrium tilt angle ψ about the axis labeled by ε.

We consider a two-component membrane in which the
local compositional asymmetry between the different layers and/or the density of curvature-sensitive inclusions is
phenomenologically coupled to the local mean curvature
of the membrane [33, 34]. When the compositional variation is weak and the membrane displacement is small,
the free-energy can be written as a Landau-Ginzburg ex-

pansion [33–35, 42–44],

where only the lowest-order terms are retained and a, b
and c are phenomenological constants. The scalar fields
ϕ(r) and u(r) are the local composition difference (as an

area fraction) and bilayer mid-plane height, respectively,
see Fig 1. Both deformation fields are described within a
Monge representation, which allows us to write the freeenergy associated with mid-plane deformation as

where σ and κ are the surface tension and bending rigidity of the membrane, respectively [45].
We now seek the ground state of the membrane and
neglect fluctuations throughout. The membrane shape
u(r) and its compositional field ϕ(r) can then be computed exactly by minimizing the free-energy functional,
F = Fu + Fϕ , leading to the Euler-Lagrange equations:
∇2 u = (∇2 − β 2 ) φ,

By separation of variables, a solution to equation (5) that
vanishes in the far-field limit can be found to be
φ(r, θ) = φ+ (r, θ) + φ− (r, θ),

FIG. 2. (color on-line) Membrane profiles induced by an
asymmetrical inclusion, where the contact angle is given by
U 0 (θ) = 15◦ if |θ| < w/2 and 0 otherwise, with θ measured
from the x−axis (see text). The membrane parameters are
here α r0 = 0.1, β r0 = 1.0 and γ r0 = 0.5, with r0 the radius
of the inclusion (not depicted). The compositional asymmetry φ(r) is shown as the color-map of the surface plots.

(11)

The angular functions Vn± (θ) and Wn (θ) are determined by the boundary conditions at the interface ∂M,
located at a distance r0 from the symmetry axis. These
are specified by the height U(θ) and contact angle U 0 (θ)
at which the mid-plane of the bilayer meets the inclusion (see Fig 1). This choice is motivated by assuming a
strong coupling between the transmembrane domain of
the inclusion and the membrane hydrophobic core. Also,
the normal derivative of φ is chosen to vanish on ∂M,
which is used to obtain an unique solution [48].
This methodology allows us to compute exactly the
lowest order estimates to the membrane profile, its local
phase behavior, and the total deformation energy, given
an arbitrary model for the shape of the inclusion, through
U(θ) and U 0 (θ), i.e. a general solution to the problem.
This makes contact with experiments that might measure membrane shape (cryo TEM [49] or perhaps TIRF
microscopy) and composition (NMR [50] or FRET [51]).
First, we consider a simple illustrative example in which
the height, U(θ), is chosen to be a constant z0 , while the
contact angle has a non-zero value only within an angular
interval w, see Fig 2. This corresponds to a rigid inclusion
that induces a local mid-plane deformation only within
a specific region along its hydrophobic belt, with the re-

3
maining part preferring a flat membrane. The Connolly
surface of a leucine transporter, LeuT, exhibits similar
features [52, 53]. The height z0 is not entirely arbitrary,
being set by the overall balance of normal forces. Similarly, the condition of torque balance leads to a tilt of
the inclusion (see [47] for details), as illustrated in Fig 1.
Typical solutions due to such an asymmetrically-shaped
inclusion that exerts no net torque are shown in Fig 2
for physiologically reasonable values of α, β, and γ [54].
The induced φ(r) shows a rich variation as the angle w is
varied between 0 and 2π, which correspond to inclusions
with a cylindrical and a conical shape, respectively.
To better understand the role of the coupling constant
γ, we consider symmetric conical inclusions (w = 2π)
in what follows, noting that the transition from over- to
under-damped variation also appears for rigid inclusions
with other (or no) symmetry. For values of γ less than
γd = |α − β|, the solutions are found to be monotonically
decaying, see Fig 3(b). However, as γ is increased above
this point, the solutions show an underdamped behavior, with the membrane displacement decaying to zero
for large distances. The magnitude of this amplitude becomes large as γ approaches γc = α + β, suggesting the
2
<0
presence of an instability. In fact γ > γc , where k±
as shown in Fig 3(a), corresponds to Leibler’s criterion
for curvature-induced instabilities in (bulk) membranes
[33, 34]. The point γ = γd instead corresponds to a critically damped system, separating the real and complex
domain of k± . The solutions are thermodynamically stable on either side of this boundary. When γd < γ < γc ,
the decay rate λ of the membrane undulations and its
wave number ω can be determined by approximating
−1/2
Kn (ρ) ≈ e−ρ (πρ / 2)
for ρ  n in Eq (9) [55], i.e.
e−λ(r−r0 )
cos [ ω (r − r0 ) + ϑ ] ,

FIG. 3. (color on-line) (a) Plot of k±
from Eq (6) against the
coupling constant γ, with α r0 = 0.1, β r0 = 1.0 and r0 the
inclusion radius. This illustrates that both k+ (red line) and
k− (blue line) are real for γ < |α − β|, and purely imaginary
when γ > α + β. The grey shaded area illustrates the region
2
where k±
are complex, while the green line shows the real
part only. The domain given by γ > α + β corresponds to
Leibler’s unstable regime [33, 34]. (b) Radial profiles of the
bilayer mid-plane u(r) and the compositional asymmetry φ(r)

α and β have the same values as those in panel (a).

(12)

where ϑ is a phase angle that only depends on α, β
and γ. Here, λ and ω are given by the real and imaginary parts of (6), respectively. Thus, we find that the
wavelength of the pre-critical undulations diverges as
we approach γ = γd , and the decay length diverges
for γ = γc , which signals the presence of a bulk membrane instability. Physically and mathematically distinct
underdamped solutions have also been found in studies
of membrane thickness mismatch without any compositional field that couples to mid-plane curvature [17].
While α can be measured through various experimental techniques [56–59], the parameters β and γ are more
elusive [48]. Our analysis suggests a possible method to
measure them, e.g. by tuning the system to lie near the
instability threshold γ . γc . Here, the amplitude of the
undulations are large and long-ranged, and γ and β can
be inferred by comparison with (9) or (12). This tuning might be achieved by controlling the surface tension,
e.g. using a micropipette aspiration technique [56], so as

to approach the critical tension σc = κ(γ − β)2 , although
the presence of thermal fluctuations may mean that some
averaging will be required to resolve the ground state,
particularly far away from the membrane inclusion. This
illustrates the predictive power of our model.
Mechanosensitive membrane channels have been
widely studied and reveal the interplay between the biological function of transmembrane proteins and the adjacent membrane structure and composition. Through
conformational changes from a closed to an open state
that allows the passage of solvent through the membrane,
they can equilibrate an osmotic imbalance between the
interior and exterior of cells [62–64]. Although many examples of these channels are found in nature, the bacterial mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL) and small
conductance (MscS) are prototypes of such proteins. Experimental studies have have shown that the channel
opening probability is related to the membrane tension
and the size of the open pore [60–67]. One possibility

4
tributes to a change in the free energy of the channelmembrane system. Here, for simplicity, we consider the
angle at the channel wall δ to be non-zero in a conical
closed state and δ = 0 in the open state. We explore
the thermodynamic effect of this gating-by-tilt by comparing the deformation energy F of the membrane to the
experimental estimate of the energy required to open the
channels at zero tension, inferred by assuming purely dilational opening. Fig 4(a) shows that the even modest
changes in the boundary angle at the face of the channel could give rise to a significant thermodynamic energy
under gating-by-tilt. Moreover, a regime is identified in
which the membrane can act to close, rather than open,
the channel, characterized by a negative total energy F
relative to the open state, although a similar result was
previously identified in a model that neglects spatial variation of coupling to curvature [23, 24]. Our results indicate that lipid composition variation, and its coupling
to mean curvature, could play a role in regulating the
function of mechanosensitive membrane channels.

FIG. 4. (color on-line) (a) The top sketches, with the bilayer membrane represented by a thick green line, show two
idealized schemes for channel gating: the gating-by-tilt model
(left); and the dilational gating model (right). The figures below this show the angle for gating-by tilt that would account
for the absolute value of the entire conformational energy
change F measured for MscL and MscS [60, 61]. The dashed
line indicates F = 0 separating two domains where the membrane acts to open (F > 0), or close (F < 0), the gating channel. The uncolored region is not shown as it corresponds to
angles greater than 60◦ , which are probably unphysical and
where our perturbative approach anyway breaks down. (b)
The top sketch shows a membrane deformed by the assembly
of a protein coat such as clathrin or a viral coat protein. The
graphs below this show the radial compositional field φ(r)
when the coat is of size r0 = 10 nm (left) and the change
in membrane energy-per-area of coat monomers ∆fc due to
coupling to the composition field against the coat radius r0
(right). In both cases we assume a typical intrinsic coat curvature with Rc = 50 nm, β = 1.0 nm−1 and γ = 1.1 nm−1 .
In the underdamped regime the energy change ∆fc can exhibit an initial decrease, which may drive coat assembly. In
both figures (a) and (b) we use κ = 20 kB T .

is that the channel simply dilates open at high tension
but the transition between the closed and open states
might also involve, e.g. a change in slope at the proteinmembrane interface (here, δ) [68]. In a two-component
membrane such a change in boundary conditions between
the closed and open states couples to both the shape and
asymmetry field in the nearby membrane and hence con-

Finally, the presence of a negative deformation energy
in the underdamped regime motivated us to study the
thermodynamics of protein coat formation on a membrane. Such coats are important in regulation, e.g. membrane trafficking using clathrin coats, or in infection,
where viral coats assemble at the plasma membrane [1].
Fig 4(b) shows both the compositional field φ around a
protein coat of size r0 = 10 nm and the variation with
r0 of ∆fc , i.e. the change in membrane energy due to
coupling to φ only, scaled by the coat area. Thus, ∆fc
renormalizes the chemical potential for binding of early
coat monomers to the membrane, and it is computed
by adding both the contribution from the membrane inside (under) and outside the coat [47]. Two striking features are observed in the underdamped regime. Firstly,
this free-energy change can support an initial decrease
with coat size. In this case the deformation of the membrane (with its associated composition) is energetically
favorable. This is true (even) for membranes that remain thermodynamically stable, i.e. in the absence of
bulk instability. This may represent a new mechanism
for driving (controlling) coat formation in cells. This
might be tested by tracking coat assembly at different α
(tension), e.g. controlled by micropipette aspiration [56]:
We predict a dramatic increase in the rate of assembly
near the critical tension σc . Secondly, the existence of a
minimum in ∆fc corresponds to a characteristic coat size
with metastable character; we note that partially formed
coats are often observed [69].

[46] The sign choice of γ is simply a convention. The fields u
and φ are invariant under a sign change in γ, itself related
to the convention of a direction for “up” and whether one
refers to the enrichment of a component that couples to
positive curvature (depending on one’s choice for “up”)
or the depletion of one that couples to negative curvature.

[54] Typically the membrane correlation length might be
α−1 ∼ 10 r0 [73]. Eq. (1) can be associated with a typical interfacial p
width for a strongly segregated system of
a fewpnm, say b/|a| ∼ r0 , and a line tension of about a
pN ( b|a| ∼ pN) [74], which combine to give b ∼ kB T .
Sorting of strongly curvature-coupling components into
membrane tubes gives an upper bound of c ∼ κ/(2.5 r0 )
and hence a value for γ ∼ 2/r0 [75], indicating that the all
regimes discussed in the main text are accessible. While
the use of a phase separated system to estimate the parameters a and b is questionable, given that they are
motivated within a model in which the system remains
essentially one phase, with φ very small, we are reassured
that the primary limit on the accessibility of the underdamped regime is that β is not too large. Given that
spontaneous phase separation is often seen on biological
membranes there would seem to be no lower limit on a
reasonable magnitude for a and hence β.
