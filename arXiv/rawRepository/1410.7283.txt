Taylor’s Law

Abstract
Taylor’s Law (TL) describes the scaling relationship between the mean and variance of
populations as a power-law. TL is widely observed in ecological systems across space and time
with exponents varying largely between 1 and 2. Many ecological explanations have been
proposed for TL but it is also commonly observed outside ecology. We propose that TL arises
from the constraining influence of two primary variables: the number of individuals and the
number of censuses or sites. We show that most possible configurations of individuals among
censuses or sites produce the power-law form of TL with exponents between 1 and 2. This
“feasible set” approach suggests that TL is a statistical pattern driven by two constraints,
providing an a priori explanation for this ubiquitous pattern. However, the exact form of any
specific mean-variance relationship cannot be predicted in this way, i.e., this approach does a
poor job of predicting variation in the exponent, suggesting that TL may still contain ecological
information.

Introduction
One of the most basic goals of ecology is to understand how ecological systems change
across scales. Scaling relationships such as Kleiber’s Law (Kleiber 1932; Brown et al. 2004) and
the species-area relationship (Rosenzweig 1995) have been intensively studied for decades and
serve as both useful tools for extrapolation and empirical targets for ecological theories. One of
the most general scaling relationships is Taylor’s Law (TL; Taylor 1961). TL proposes that the
relationship between the variance (s2) and the mean density (m) of populations is a power-law,
which can be expressed mathematically as s2 ~ amb where a and b are constants. TL has been
confirmed as an adequate description of population fluctuations both spatially (Taylor 1961;
Taylor and Taylor 1977; Taylor et al. 1978; He and Gaston 2003; Kaltz et al. 2012) and
temporally (Taylor and Woiwod 1980; Perry 1994; Kerkhoff and Ballantyne 2003). Spatial TLs
describe how populations vary in spatial aggregation as a function of their average size, with the
points being the mean and the variance of a set of spatially distinct locations within a population.
Temporal TLs describe the relationship between the level of temporal fluctuation of populations
and their mean densities, with each point being the mean and variance of a single population
time-series. The exponent b, which characterizes the curvature of the relationship, is generally
bounded between 1 and 2 for both types of relationships (Taylor and Woiwod 1982). These
patterns have been observed across thousands of studies from a diverse array of taxonomic
groups (Taylor et al. 1978; Taylor and Woiwod 1980; Taylor et al. 1983), making Taylor’s Law
one of the most widely-documented patterns in ecology.
A number of different models based on distinct ecological processes have been proposed
to explain Taylor’s Law. Explanations for the spatial TL include density-dependent population
growth (Perry 1994), density-independent population growth (Cohen et al. 2013), random walks

of individuals in space (Hanski 1980), and simultaneous attraction and repulsion among
conspecific individuals (Taylor 1981a; Taylor 1981b). Similarly, the temporal TL has been
argued to arise from environmental and demographic stochasticity (Ballantyne 2005; Ballantyne
and Kerkhoff 2007), interspecific competition (Kilpatrick and Ives 2003), and even sampling
error (Kalyuzhny et al. 2014). However, similar power-law mean-variance relationships with
exponents between 1 and 2 have recently been documented in a number of non-ecological
systems, ranging from the distribution of genes on a chromosome (Kendal 2003) and the number
of cells in individuals (Azevedo and Leroi 2001) to fluctuations in the stock market (Eisler and
Kertész 2006) and traffic flow (de Menezes and Barabási 2004) (see Eisler et al. 2008 for a
review). This suggests that the mechanism underlying the pattern may not be specific to
ecological systems but may instead be purely statistical.
An alternative explanation to process-based models is that TL describes the meanvariance scaling relationship of most possible states of a system where individuals are divided
among groups (such as censuses or plots). This constraint-based view has been explored for
another common pattern, the species-abundance distribution, using the set of all possible
configurations of the pattern given some constraints (the feasible set; Locey and White 2013) to
determine if the general shape of the pattern simply reflects that of the majority of possible
outcomes. This kind of reasoning would suggest that TL is not generated by any particular set of
processes, but emerges because many different combinations of processes result in the same
general pattern (Harte 2011; White et al. 2012; Frank 2014).
To investigate this possibility for TL, we begin by recognizing that the form of TL is
necessarily influenced by two values: the total number (quantity) of individuals (Q), and the
number of groups (N; e.g., plots in spatial TL, censuses in temporal TL) among which those

individuals are distributed, for each point in the mean-variance relationship. Given these
constraints we ask whether most possible mean-variance relationships take a roughly power-law
form. We adopt the concept of the feasible set (Haegeman and Loreau 2008; Locey and White
2013), which provides a general context under which the observed patterns can be examined. By
comparing the empirical TLs to mean-variance relationships created from randomly sampling the
set of all possible relationships constrained by Q and N, we find that both the form of the powerlaw and the exponent b between 1 and 2 are expected to occur for most possible arrangements of
the system; though the exact shape of each individual relationship cannot be accurately
characterized without additional information.
Methods
1. The feasible set approach
The feasible set is the set of all possible configurations of a system (Haegeman and
Loreau 2008; Locey and White 2013). This concept can be applied with different sets of
constraints and configurations (e.g. ordered or unordered vectors of labeled individuals, ordered
or unordered vectors of abundances, etc.). Since each mean-variance pair (mi, si2) in a TL
relationship results from the variation of abundances among Ni groups, the sum of which is Qi
and the mean of which is mi = Qi / Ni, we adopted (Qi, Ni) as a minimal set of constraints. The
value of the unbiased sample variance si2 depends on how the abundances vary among the
groups, with a minimal value of 0 (assuming that Qi can be equally divided among Ni groups)
and a maximal value of Qi2 / Ni (where the abundance is Ni in one group and zero everywhere
else).
We used two types of combinatorial objects, integer partitions and integer compositions,
as configurations for feasible sets that may give rise to TL. Integer partitions are lists of

unordered non-negative integers, usually written in non-increasing order. In contrast, integer
compositions are ordered vectors of non-negative integers (Bona 2006; Severs and White 2010).
For example, the feasible set of integer partitions for Qi = 4 and Ni = 2 is: (4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2). In
this way, differently ordered configurations with the same integer values, e.g., (4, 0) and (0, 4),
represent the same integer partition (4, 0) but different compositions. The difference between
partitions and compositions is analogous to the difference between two well-known
combinatorial objects, combinations and permutations, where combinations are unordered sets of
numbers or objects that can be reordered into potentially many permutations. See Table 1 for
definitions of technical terms.
The feasible set for TL may greatly differ depending on whether the order of the groups
is considered (compositions) or not (partitions). Using integer compositions as configurations to
explore TL is equivalent to shifting the weights of the partitions, i.e., making some
configurations more likely to arise due to the differences in the number of compositions each
partition has. In the above example of Qi = 4 and Ni = 2, the partition (4, 0) has the same
frequency as (2, 2) in the feasible set of partitions, but twice the frequency in the feasible set of
compositions because there is no other way to reorder (2, 2). In fact, for a given (Qi, Ni) pair, a
partition with all unique numbers will always be associated with more compositions than a
partition with repeated numbers, and hence greater representation in the feasible set of
compositions. We examined the application of both partitions and compositions to TL because
there is no a priori reason to favor one over the other, and because using both would provide a
more complete context for understanding the constraining influence of Qi and Ni.
2. Data
To explore whether the feasible set could generate realistic empirical patterns, we

compiled TL relationships from the literature by surveying all papers that cited Taylor (1961) on
Google Scholar to which we had access. We collected all empirical relationships that directly
reported the values of (mi, si2) and (Qi, Ni) pairs, or contained enough information for these
values to be calculated. Due to the limited number of available non-ecological TL relationships,
we focused exclusively on ecological TLs describing spatial or temporal fluctuations of
population abundances. This approach to data compilation resulted in an imbalance between the
spatial and the temporal TLs, with 90 spatial relationships and only 4 temporal ones. To offset
this imbalance, we added a compilation of community-level time-series data (Yenni 2013) to our
analysis, increasing the number of temporal TLs to 113.
All relationships were put through additional screening before analysis. We removed (mi,
si2) pairs where the corresponding Ni was less than 3 to ensure that the variance si2 was properly
defined among at least 3 numbers, as well as pairs where the corresponding Qi was less than 5 so
that the shape of TL would not be distorted by these zero-inflated, over-constrained
configurations (Taylor and Woiwod 1982). We then excluded those relationships with less than 5
pairs of (mi, si2) remaining, leaving 73 spatial TLs and 106 temporal TLs. Due to the
computationally intensive nature of the algorithm of generating partitions (Locey and White
2013), we further dropped TL relationships that contained any (Qi, Ni) pairs that individually
would take 2 hours or more to analyze (see 3. Analyses below). Overall our study encompassed
115 TL relationships, where 45 were spatial and 70 were temporal (see Appendix A for a full list
of empirical relationships and their characteristics).
3. Analyses
In order to examine whether most possible mean-variance relationships exhibit TL-like
behavior, we need to define a range of scenarios to explore. To avoid selecting arbitrary, and

potentially unrealistic, values of Qi and Ni (and the distributions of those values within individual
datasets), we followed Xiao et al. (2011) and used empirical data to define the range of values
explored. For each empirical mean-variance relationship, we generated its artificial counterparts
from the feasible set using the following the steps:
1. We constructed the feasible set of partitions and the feasible set of compositions for each
pair of (Qi, Ni) in the empirical relationship. Given the large size of the feasible set for
large values of (Qi, Ni) (Locey and White 2013), we drew 1000 random configurations
from the feasible set for each (Qi, Ni) using the algorithms from Locey and McGlinn
(2013). We confirmed that 1000 samples were sufficient in this context by testing sample
sizes of 4000, which yielded equivalent results (Appendix B, Fig. B2).
2. We computed sij2 for each sampled configuration, with j ranging from 1 to 1000, leading
to 1000 sij2’s for each empirically observed si2.
3. We built artificial mean-variance relationships by replacing si2’s in the empirical
relationship with sij2’s that we obtained from the feasible set. Thus the first artificial
relationship consisted of pairs of (mi, si12), the second relationship consisted of pairs of
(mi, si22), etc., resulting in 1000 simulated mean-variance relationships, or 1000
arrangements of (mi, sij2) pairs, for each empirical relationship.
We examined the 95% (2.5% to 97.5%) quantiles of the 1000 sij2’s for each (Qi, Ni) pair to
see if the variance for configurations within the feasible set was aggregated with most
configurations having similar variance values, and if the corresponding empirical si2 took a
similar value. We then compared the mean-variance relationships obtained from sampling the
feasible set to the empirical TL relationships with the same vectors of Qi and Ni. We fit powerlaw relationships to each empirical relationship and its 1000 corresponding simulated

relationships using OLS regression on log-transformed data, which is the standard approach to
assessing TL relationships. We compared the empirical and the simulated relationships based on
the values of their slopes (an estimate of the exponent b), statistical significance, goodness-of-fit
of the regression line (quantified with R2), and deviation from the power-law (quantified as
curvature on logarithmic scale, or the significance of a quadratic term fit to the relationship). All
comparative analyses were conducted separately for samples from the feasible set of partitions
and those from the feasible set of compositions.
Results
Fig. 1 depicts three empirical mean-variance relationships from our compilation together
with simulated relationships from the feasible sets of partitions and of compositions to visually
illustrate how the power-law allometries can be recovered by randomly sampling the feasible
sets. Consistent with results from previous studies (e.g., Taylor and Woiwod 1982), most of the
empirical datasets in our compilation have a significant power-law relationship between the
mean and the variance, with little curvature, high R2, and b largely between 1 and 2 (Table 2).
Mean-variance relationships simulated from the feasible set are well characterized by powerlaws as well, with an average R2 of 0.88 for relationships from the feasible set of partitions and
0.93 for those from the feasible set of compositions, though the latter show significant curvature
(i.e., significant quadratic terms) in a non-negligible proportion of cases (27.8%, Table 2). The
exponent b estimated for the simulated relationships also largely falls between 1 and 2 (85.1%
for partitions, 75.0% for compositions). Comparison between empirical TLs and those
constructed from the feasible sets shows general agreement both in fit (p-values and R2) and in
the values of b (Table 2, Fig. 2). Specifically, relationships constructed from the feasible set of
partitions provide a surprisingly good match to empirical observations in the distribution of all

statistics, while those from the feasible set of compositions exhibit deviations with higher
proportions of significant curvature and exponents shifted towards higher values (Fig. 2).
On the other hand, comparison between individual empirical si2’s and those calculated for
random configurations in the feasible sets show that a high percentage of si2’s fall outside of the
95% quantiles of the feasible set values for both spatial TLs (43.3% for partitions, 73.0% for
compositions) and temporal TLs (26.5% for partitions, 41.9% for compositions) (Fig. 3, top
panels). Examination of sij2’s for individual (Qi, Ni) pairs shows that considerable variation exist
for at least some combinations of Qi and Ni, leading to distributions of sij2’s that are dispersed
without a sharp peak where most configurations are aggregated (Appendix B, Fig. B1). This is
particularly true for partitions. Consequently, the exponent b estimated for individual empirical
TLs falls outside of the 95% quantile of those generated from the feasible set in 40.0% of spatial
TLs and 28.6% of temporal TLs for partitions (73.3% and 60.0% for compositions; Fig. 3,
bottom panels), and the feasible set values of the exponent do not provide good predictions for
the empirical values (coefficient of determination = -0.035 for partitions, -0.61 for
compositions). These results suggest that neither feasible set approach is able to accurately
characterize the variance of individual observations, or the exact shape of individual meanvariance relationships. While most possible mean-variance relationships are well characterized
by power-laws, the precise form of the power-law for a particular set of (Qi, Ni) is not strongly
constrained by the feasible set.
Discussion
Taylor’s Law, or the power-law relationship between the mean and the variance of one or
more populations, is a general pattern that has been widely observed in both ecological and nonecological systems (Eisler et al. 2008). While numerous processes have been proposed as

explanations for this pattern (e.g., Taylor 1981a; Kilpatrick and Ives 2003; Ballantyne and
Kerkhoff 2007; Cohen et al. 2013), our study shows that TL can arise from numerical constraints
on the system without explicitly or implicitly invoking processes. By sampling the set of all
possible mean-variance scaling relationships we find that the form of the power-law relationship
is exceptionally robust (Table 2, Fig. 2) with distributions of the exponent b closely matching
those estimated from the empirical relationships (Fig. 2D), despite the relatively high observable
variation for variance values among the configurations (Fig 3, Fig. B1). Thus the feasible set
provides a general explanation for the ubiquity of TL in nature and helps explain why the pattern
can be produced by models based on different underlying processes.
Our study is not the first to suggest that TL may be statistical in nature. By applying the
Maximum Entropy Principle, Fronczak and Fronczak (2010) proposed that TL is the most likely
macrostate associated with the largest number of microstates. However, their approach was later
criticized for its reliance on physical quantities such as free energy and an external field, which
lack analogues in biological systems (Kendal and Jørgensen 2011). Kendal and Jørgensen (2011)
suggested instead that TL is associated with the Tweedie distribution family (Tweedie 1984),
which by definition are characterized by a strict power-law relationship between the variance and
the mean. While it has been argued that many statistical systems converge to distributions in the
Tweedie family as limiting cases (Tweedie convergence theorem; Jørgensen et al. 1994), it is not
clear how such convergence is achieved in nature.
Our approach shows that most of the possible configurations for dividing a given total
among a number of groups will result in a mean-variance scaling relationship consistent with
Taylor’s Law. This approach is unique in that it is built upon the concept of the feasible set,
which can be unambiguously defined and applied to any system. With the feasible set approach,

Locey and White (2013) showed that the majority of the configurations constrained by total
abundance N and total species richness S conform to a hollow-curve similar in shape to
empirically observed species-abundance distributions (SAD). Our study shows similar results for
a second general pattern, TL, illustrating again that patterns can arise simply as the aggregated
central tendency within a feasible set. This further emphasizes the importance of examining
empirical patterns in the context of the forms that the pattern is capable of taking.
The feasible set approach is part of a more general framework to understanding
macroecological patterns that has been emerging over the last decade. These approaches, which
also include applications of the Maximum Entropy Principle, propose that some empirical
patterns are emergent statistical properties constrained by numerical inputs (state variables),
while the processes operate only indirectly through their effects on constraints formed by the
state variables (Harte 2011; Supp et al. 2012; Locey and White 2013; Frank 2014). The
constraints, which are usually descriptive statistics of the system (i.e., state variables or moments
of the distributions), either strictly limit the possible configurations that a system can take
(“hard” constraints; e.g., there are a limited number of ways to allocate 100 individuals into 5
groups) or limit the expected characteristics of the system (“soft” constraints”; e.g., 20
individuals are expected on average for each group but the observed values may vary; see
Haegeman and Etienne 2010). In our study the system is hard-constrained by the total number of
individuals observed (Qi) and the number of groups they belong to (Ni), which forces the mean of
configurations in the feasible set to match the mean of empirical data. The power-law
relationship between the mean and the variance then arises for most possible arrangements of
(mi, si2) pairs generated by randomly sampling the feasible set.
While the application of the feasible set approach is independent of assumptions about

processes, the distribution of possible states of the system (in our case, variance) may shift with
different definitions of what constitutes a unique configuration. This can be seen by the
differences between the feasible set of partitions and the feasible set of compositions (Figs 2, 3).
Partitions describe how a total can be divided among groups with no information on the identity
of either the individuals or the groups. Applied to ecological populations, it is equivalent to
simultaneously assigning quantities of individuals at random to a number of plots or censuses,
focusing exclusively on the possible forms of the pattern. This deliberately ignores how the
relative likelihood of a particular pattern could vary depending on specific null modeling
decisions related to the identity of the individuals or the plots or censuses that they belong to. As
such, this is not a null model in the traditional sense, where inference is drawn for a specific
process by comparing the empirical data with the null which does not include the process.
Instead, this approach tells us about the possible patterns that can occur, and therefore provides
context for whether it will be possible to associate any specific process with the pattern in
question (Locey and White 2013).
While partitions were the only configuration used for understanding the possible forms of
the species-abundance distribution (Locey and White 2013), we also considered integer
compositions in this study. This configuration is the same as simultaneously choosing quantities
of individuals at random to be assigned to specific sites or surveys. Unlike partitions, there may
be several compositions that result in the same state of the pattern, i.e., multiple compositions
can be associated with the same partition and thus have the same value of variance.
Compositions are also closer to a classic null modeling approach because it is possible to
envision population level processes, such as competition, that are being excluded in this
approach to distributing populations of individuals. There are two other configurations that we

did not consider, both of which focus on the distribution of individual organisms. One is the
equivalent of randomly selecting the location of each of a set of known individuals among sites
or censuses (known as surjections in combinatorics); e.g., the composition (1, 1) can be
expanded into two configurations (A, B) and (B, A), where A and B represent labeled
individuals. This is how most traditional null modeling is conducted in ecology. The other is the
case where elements of the configuration are labeled but the identities of their bins are not
accounted for; e.g., knowing that individuals A and B are in the same plot but not which plot
they are located in. These two configurations are excluded because we are interested in patterns
that are related to how entire populations of individuals are distributed across space and through
time, not the specific location of individual organisms.
While there is a reasonable justification for choosing to focus on how populations are
distributed rather than how individuals are distributed, both partition- and composition-based
approaches satisfy this consideration. In equivalent discussions on how to set up maximum
entropy based models, it has been argued that these choices must be made on the basis of
comparisons to empirical data (Haegeman and Etienne 2010). Our study shows that the feasible
set of partitions provides a more adequate characterization for our compilation of ecological TL
relationships both in the fit of the power-law form (Table 2) and in the distribution of the
exponents (Fig. 2D), however it remains to be seen if this statement holds more broadly,
especially in non-ecological systems.
Our broad-stroke explanation for Taylor’s Law based on the majority of possible
outcomes from the feasible set does not preclude the influence of other processes and constraints.
In fact, our research shows that the exponent b for a particular relationship cannot be accurately
estimated by merely examining the central tendency of the feasible sets defined by (Qi, Ni) alone

(Fig. 3). Many previous studies have shown that b is often characteristic of a given system which
may reflect underlying ecological properties. In spatial TLs b is strongly tied to spatial
aggregation (He and Gaston 2003), while different values of b in temporal TLs have been
attributed to the interplay between synchronized versus independent reproduction (Ballantyne
and Kerkhoff 2007), binomial versus proportional sampling error (Kalyuzhny et al. 2014), and
the strength of interspecific competition (Kilpatrick and Ives 2003). While our results suggest
that both the power-law form of the relationships and the general bound on their exponents are
likely to be statistical, failure of the feasible set in pinning down the specific values of b for
individual relationships implies that the ecological significance of these relationships may lie in
their detailed shapes, which can only be understood with more information of the systems that go
beyond the constraints Qi and Ni.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Three empirical mean-variance relationships (one in each column) versus one
realization of their corresponding simulated relationships from the feasible set of partitions (top
row) or compositions (bottom row). The fitted lines are obtained with OLS regression. The inset
in each subplot represents the density distribution of the exponent b estimated from all 1000
simulated relationships (green or magenta curve), versus b for the empirical relationship (black
vertical line). Note that the simulated relationships largely retain the power-law allometry;
however their b values can span a relatively broad range, the mean of which may or may not
match the empirical b.
Figure 2. Density distribution of (A) p-values for the exponent b, (B) p-values for the quadratic
term, (C) R2 of the power-law relationship on logarithmic scale, and (D) values of the exponent
b. Empirical results from the spatial TLs and the temporal TLs are not qualitatively different and
are thus pooled. The dashed vertical lines in (A) and (B) represent the significance level of 0.05.
Figure 3. Comparison between the empirical values and their counterparts from the feasible sets
of partitions (left) and compositions (right). Top panels show the results for variance (s2), while
bottom panels show the results for b. Vertical bars represent the 95% quantile for each point. For
visualization purposes, values obtained from the feasible sets are standardized with respect to
empirical values, either by division (for s2) or by substraction (for b). Each subplot is divided
into three sections by vertical dashed lines – points where the 95% quantile from the feasible set
is below the empirical value (left), where it covers the empirical value (middle), and where it is
above the empirical value (right). The horizontal line is where the mean value from the feasible
set equals the empirical value. Results from spatial and temporal relationships are lumped.

Figure B1. Examples showing the distribution of the variance calculated for configurations
sampled from the feasible sets. The black vertical line in each subplot represents the empirical
variance of the data from which the feasible sets are constructed.

Figure B2. The equivalent of Fig. 2 in the main body of the paper, with the analyses conducted
using 4000 (instead of 1000) simulated configurations for each (Qi, Ni) pair. The two figures are
almost identical, which implies that 1000 is a sufficient sample size to capture the variation
within the feasible sets.
