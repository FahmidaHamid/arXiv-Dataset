An epidemiological model which incorporates synergistic effects that allow the infectivity and/or
susceptibility of hosts to be dependent on the number of infected neighbours is proposed. Constructive synergy induces an exploitative behaviour which results in a rapid invasion that infects a large
number of hosts. Interfering synergy leads to a slower and sparser explorative foraging strategy
that traverses larger distances by infecting fewer hosts. The model can be mapped to a dynamical
bond-percolation with spatial correlations that affect the mechanism of spread but do not influence
the critical behaviour of epidemics.

The identification of criteria to predict whether or
not a spreading agent such as an infectious pathogen,
rumour or opinion will invade a population is of great
relevance both in biology and social sciences1–3,13 .
Numerous models have been proposed to gauge the
invasiveness of spreading agents and assess the effectiveness of control in preventing invasion of epidemics1,2,9,10,13,17–21 . Within the context of infectious
diseases, much theoretical work has been done for wellmixed populations but invasion in stochastic, spatiallystructured, individual-based models4–8,41 closer to real
epidemics23–26 has also been considered. These models do not deal with synergistic effects in transmission
of infection thus assuming independent and identical
action between hosts. This would suggest that multiple challenges to a susceptible host from one, two
or more neighbouring infected hosts are independent
and not influenced by the local environment. However, there is evidence for the existence of such effects
in systems subject to colonisation by fungal and bacterial pathogens10,11 , as well as in tumour growth9,12 .
Synergistic effects have also been experimentally reported in studies of opinion dynamics13 , spread of behaviour3, and animal invasion2,27 . The model presented in Ref. 19 incorporates some temporal synergistic effects but it deals with well-mixed populations and
spatial synergistic effects are not considered. Models
for opinion dynamics and animal invasion have considered some constructive synergistic spatial effects (e.g.
population pressure2 and social impact13,28 ). However,
these effects are too simple to capture, for instance,
possible changes in the foraging strategies of spreading
agents that can significantly affect important features
of invasions such as their size and time scales. Here,
we present a model for spread of infection in spatiallystructured populations and show that synergistic effects in transmission of infection have non-trivial and
significant consequences on epidemics.
We consider an epidemic spreading through a population of susceptible hosts placed on the sites/nodes
of a square lattice of size L × L. The infection transmission rate between any donor-recipient (d-r) pair of

Dark (red online) and lighter (green online) circles correspond to infected and susceptible hosts, respectively. Arrows indicate possible events for transmission of infection.
For r-synergy, the susceptibility of a recipient susceptible
r is enhanced (constructive synergy) or diminished
host 
(interfering synergy) in response to multiple simultaneous
challenges from two or more neighbouring infected hosts
r depends on the number
(donors). The susceptibility of 
nr of neighbours simultaneously challenging it (nr = 3 in
this example). For d-synergy, the infectivity of a donor host
d depends upon the number nd of connections of this host

to other infectious hosts that can share resources with the
donor host. In this example, nd = 1 (connection indicated
by an edge).

hosts depends on the number of infected hosts in the
neighbourhood of the d-r pair. We focus on two particular cases of the model denoted as r-synergy and
d-synergy (Fig. 1).
The model is an extension of a basic spatial model
for the SIR epidemic process in which hosts (sites) can
be in one of the three states5 : susceptible (S), infected
(I) or removed and fully immune to further infection
(R). Once a host is infected, it stays in such a state for
a fixed unit of time, τ = 1 and can pass infection during this infectious period to other S-neighbours, and
then it is removed/recovered (I → R transition). The
infection process (S → I transition) occurs through the

2
pathogen being transmitted randomly with rate λd-r (t)
from one of the I-neighbours (donor) of the S-host (recipient). Synergistic effects make the rate λd-r (t) dependent on the state of hosts in the neighbourhood of
the particular d-r pair. By definition, λd-r (t), is zero
before the time of infection of the donor. Once the
donor is infected, λd-r (t) becomes positive but, in contrast to the basic SIR model5,14 , it can vary during the
whole infectious period τ due to possible changes in the
neighbourhood of the d-r pair. The transmission rate
can be conveniently split into two contributions,
λd-r (t) = max{0, α + βd-r (t)} ,

where α ≥ 0 is the elementary rate of infection for
an isolated d-r pair exhibiting no synergistic effects. It
does not vary over the infectious period and is assumed
to be the same for all d-r pairs. The rate βd-r (t) quantifies the degree of synergy present and is βd-r (t) = 0
in the absence of synergistic effects when the model reduces to the simple SIR process. The expression for
βd-r (t) depends on the type of synergy. For r-synergy
(Fig. 1(a)), we assume that βd-r (t) = β(nr (t) − 1),
where nr (t) is the number of neighbours challenging
a recipient host. The rate β gives an effective measure of the strength of synergy which is constructive
for β > 0 and interfering if β < 0. Such a form of
βd-r (t) ensures that λd-r = α for non-synergistic transmissions with nr = 1. For d-synergy (Fig. 1(b)), we
assume that βd-r (t) = βnd (t), where nd (t) is the number of infected neighbours connected to a donor at time
t so that λd-r = α for an isolated infectious host with
nd = 0.
Fig. 2 shows the phase diagram for epidemics starting from a single infected host placed in the centre
of the lattice. The spread of infection has been numerically simulated by a continuous-time algorithm
which is an extension of the n-fold way algorithm29 .
The threshold for invasion defines a line of critical
points αc (β) separating the non-invasive regime where
the probability of invasion is Pinv = 0 (in an infinite system) from the invasive regime characterised by
Pinv > 0? . The phase boundaries shown in Fig. 2
correspond to the values of αc (β) for L → ∞. The
finite-size effects were accounted for and eliminated by
means of finite-size scaling (see Appendices A and B).
For both types of synergy, αc is a non-increasing
function of β, as expected from the monotonic dependence of λd-r on β [Eq. (1)]. In the absence of synergy,
the invasion thresholds for both types of synergy coincide with αc (β = 0) = τ −1 ln 2 (cf. Fig. 2 and Appendix A). The larger deviations of αc (β) from αc (0)
for a given β observed for d-synergy are due to the fact
that, except for the initially infected host, d-synergy is
present in every transmission event with β 6= 0 because
nd ≥ 1 for at least some time. In contrast, for r-synergy
to be operative in a transmission event, there must be
nr ≥ 2 attacking neighbours which is not necessarily
the case in every transmission event.
For r-synergy with large positive values of β, the
critical line αc (β) tends towards the limiting value

FIG. 2. Phase diagram for synergistic epidemics. The exact phase boundaries are marked by squares for r-synergy
and by circles for d-synergy. Epidemics are invasive if the
parameters (α, β) are on the right of the phase boundary.
The arrow indicates the limiting value of αc ≃ 0.2 reached
asymptotically by the phase boundary for r-synergy in the
limit of large β (not shown on the scale of the graph). The
approximate phase boundaries obtained analytically by neglecting correlations in transmission of infection (cf. Appendix F) are shown for both r- (solid line) and d-synergy
(dashed line).

αc (∞) ≃ 0.2 (Fig. 2). In this situation, λd-r = α < ∞
for nr = 1 but λd-r = ∞ if nr > 1, meaning that
hosts being simultaneously attacked by more than one
neighbour are infected immediately. In cases with large
interference in transmission (i.e. very negative β), the
invasion threshold is located at αc = 0.86 ± 0.01 independently of the value of β. In this regime, λd-r does
not depend on β and corresponds to the limiting situation with λd-r = α for nr = 1 and λd-r = 0 for any
nr > 1.
For d-synergy and values of β & 0.8, invasion is possible for any positive α. The condition α > 0 is necessary in order for the epidemic to start from a single
inoculated site. Once the pathogen is transmitted to
one of the neighbours of the initially inoculated host,
nd = 1 for the newly infected host. The combination
of nd = 1 and synergy is sufficient to make invasion
possible, irrespective of the value of α.
Systems with constructive synergy are characterised
by dense patterns of invasion (Fig. 3(a)). In contrast,
the invaded region is more sparse for interfering synergy (Fig. 3(b)). This scenario applies to both d- and
r-synergy. Despite the fact that patterns for interfering
synergy are more sparse, it is striking that epidemics
with interfering synergy can nevertheless be as invasive as epidemics with constructive synergy in terms
of the spatial extent of infection. For instance, all the
patterns shown in Fig. 3 have the same probability of
invasion, Pinv = 0.5. In terms of the mean spatial density of invasion defined as the relative number of hosts
infected by the pathogen before invasion occurs with a
given probability, we conclude that the larger the inter-

ference in transmission of the pathogen, the less damaging the invasion is (Appendix C). This result can be
qualitatively understood as follows. Interfering synergy
favours transmission of infection to hosts with few infected neighbours and disfavours transmission to hosts
with several previously infected neighbours. Therefore,
infection has a tendency to evolve towards poorly infected regions rather than infecting as many hosts as
possible. These mechanisms are qualitatively similar
for both types of synergy but the density of infection
is larger for d-synergy than for r-synergy for any β 6= 0
(see Appendix C for more detail).
For constructive synergy, the patterns of invasion are
not very much influenced by the particular type of synergy. For interfering synergy, the degree of branching of
the paths followed by the pathogen is clearly smaller for
d-synergy than for r-synergy (cf. panels in Fig. 3(b)).
Branching is always possible for r-synergy. In contrast,
the patterns of invasion for d-synergy display a branching transition for a value of α = αb (β) = −β: branching occurs for α > αb (β) but it is absent for α ≤ αb (β)
(Fig. 4(a)). In the later case, the trajectories of invasion are of the type followed by a growing self-avoiding
walk (SAW)15,16 with an example shown in Fig. 4(b).
As expected for growing SAWs, the pathogen can display self-trapping, meaning that the epidemic stops if
the infection reaches a host surrounded by hosts that
have already been infected (Fig. 4(b)). For values of
α > αb (β) (Fig. 3(b), lower panel), λd-r = α + β is
positive for nd = 1 and branching is possible.
As a measure of the temporal efficiency for invasion,
we consider the time, tinv , it takes for the pathogen
to invade the system. Numerical simulations (see Appendix D) show that for any given value of Pinv , the
time tinv decreases with increasing β (for both types of
synergy). Therefore, systems with interfering synergy
are less time-efficient than those with constructive synergy. The largest deviations of tinv from its value without synergy are obtained for epidemics with d-synergy
that operates in every transmission event.
The analysis presented above demonstrates that synergy in transmission of infection has significant and
sometimes paradoxical and unexpected effects on epidemics. Despite the simple assumptions of the model
(such as, e.g., short-range synergy and linear dependence of the rate of infection on the number of infected nearest neighbours), it reproduces explorative
and exploitative foraging strategies that are typically
observed in bacterial, fungal, and tumour growth9–11 .
The explorative/exploitative behaviour in our model is
linked to interfering/constructive synergy. The foraging strategy adopted by fungi, bacteria or ants is known
to be explorative/exploitative when resources are limited/abundant.
Changes in the foraging strategy are ultimately due
to the spatial correlations in transmission rates emerging as a consequence of synergy. Spatial correlations
in λd-r appear because the neighbourhood of sufficiently close pairs of hosts have common nodes and
thus the rates for each pair are not mutually indepen-

FIG. 3. Patterns of infection. Illustration of the effect
of (a) constructive and (b) interfering synergy on the patterns of infection spreading from the central host (marked
by solid circle) in systems of linear size L = 31. The synergy
rates are β = 5 and β = −5 for patterns with constructive
and interfering synergy, respectively. All snapshots correspond to the final state of the epidemic with only R and S
hosts remaining. Solid lines indicate those edges between
d-r pairs that have transmitted the pathogen at some time
during the course of the epidemic. The value of α has been
chosen in each case such that the probability of invasion
is Pinv = 0.5 for all snapshots: (a) α = 0.47 for r-synergy
and α = 0.18 for d-synergy. (b) α = 0.81 for r-synergy and
α = 5.22 for d-synergy.

dent. Synergistic epidemics can then be regarded as
a correlated dynamical percolation analogous to the
well-known mapping of the non-synergistic SIR process to uncorrelated dynamical percolation (see 5,6,14,41
and details on the mapping to correlated dynamical percolation in Appendix E). In most situations,
spatial correlations in transmission are short-ranged
and the critical behaviour of epidemics at αc belongs
to the dynamical uncorrelated bond-percolation universality class5,14 . However, for large interfering dsynergies with α < αb (β) (region under continuous
line in Fig. 4(a)) correlations become effectively longranged and epidemics are growing SAWs whose critical
properties belong to the universality class of the standard SAW15,16 . Although the SAW behaviour affects
the local properties of epidemics with α & αb (β), the
large-scale behaviour at αc is not affected (i.e. the
critical exponents at invasion are the same as those for
uncorrelated bond percolation, as shown in detail in
Appendix B). This is a consequence of the fact that
the probability that a growing SAW invades a large
system is known to be zero due to the self-trapping
phenomenon15,16 . This implies that αc > αb for any
value of β (cf. Fig. 4(a)).

FIG. 4. Branching and invasion transitions for d-synergy.
(a) Diagram showing the branching transition line αb (β) =
−β together with the phase boundary for invasion/noninvasion transition, αc (β). Branching is forbidden in the
region under the continuous line where α < αc (β). Invasive epidemics can occur in the region above the dashed
line corresponding to α > αc (β) where branching is present.
The intermediate region between the continuous and dashed
lines with αb < α < αc corresponds to epidemics that display branching but are not invasive. (b) Example of path
for infection with d-synergy in the regime without branching (α ≤ αb ). Infection starts from the host marked by a
solid circle and evolves along the path indicated by arrows.
Arrow numbers define schematically a sequence of infection
events. For the first infected host (solid circle), nd = 0 and
infection can be transmitted to any of its neighbours at a
rate λd-r = α. However, nd = 1 as soon as the pathogen
is transmitted to one of the neighbours (arrow 1) and thus
λd-r = 0 because α ≤ −β. At this moment, transmission
of infection is arrested until the initially infected host recovers. After this recovery, nd = 0 for the newly infected
host and infection can be transmitted to one of its nearest
neighbours at rate α. Iteration of this process over time
gives growing SAWs. The state after the event marked by
arrow 10 illustrates the phenomenon of self-trapping.

The proposed model becomes analytically tractable
if spatial correlations in transmission are assumed to be
negligible. The analytic solutions provide a good qualitative description of the main features of the phase
diagram for both r- and d-synergy. Correlations in the
exact model prevent the approximate description from
being quantitative (cf. Appendix F for a complete description).
In summary, the presented work shows that synergistic effects at the individual level play an important role
in invasion at the population level. The analysis has
been restricted to the spread of epidemics in 2D regular networks relevant for, e.g., populations of plants in
a field. The extension of our work to synergistic effects
for spreading processes in higher-dimensional lattices
or more complex networks is not only conceptually appealing but also important for problems in multiple disciplines30 . Although such an extension is technically
straightforward, understanding the interplay between
synergistic effects and topological properties for different types of networks is a challenging task for future
work.

APPENDICES
Appendix A: Probability of invasion

In this section, we discuss the dependence of the
probability of invasion, Pinv , on the rates α and β. The
probability of invasion is defined as the relative number of invasive events out of many (in our simulations,
& 5000) stochastic realizations of epidemics. Although
we will deal with systems of finite size, the trends of
Pinv (see Fig. 5) are in qualitative agreement with those
expected from the phase diagram for epidemics in infinite systems shown in the main text (Fig. 2). For both
r- and d-synergy, the invasion curves (Pinv vs α) approach zero for small transition rates α thus describing
the non-invasive regime for epidemics. For large values
of α, the invasion probability is finite so that it describes the invasive regime. The invasion curves start
to deviate from zero at progressively lower values of α
as β increases. This illustrates the non-increasing character of αc (β) for increasing β discussed in the main
text. The tendencies of Pinv in extreme situations require further explanations that are different for r- and
d-synergy.
a. r-synergy Fig. 5(a) shows the probability of
invasion for epidemics with r-synergy in systems of linear size L = 31 as a function of α (invasion curves) for
several values of β. For large positive values of β, the
invasion curves tend to a single (master) curve which
can be described by a limiting function of α that does
not depend significantly on β. This is illustrated in
Fig. 5(a) by two curves for β = 50 and β = 100 coinciding within numerical error. Consequently, on the phase
diagram, the critical line αc (β) tends towards the limiting value αc (∞) ≃ 0.2 (shown by the arrow in Fig. 2,
main text). In cases with large interference in transmission (corresponding to very negative β), the curves
for Pinv (α) again collapse on a limiting curve shown in
Fig. 5(a) for β = −1.5 and β = −2.0. The corresponding invasion threshold in the thermodynamic limit is
located at αc = 0.86 ± 0.01 independently of the value
of β.
b. d-synergy For d-synergy and values of β &
0.8, invasion is possible for any positive value of α. In
this regime, the invasion curves collapse on a master
curve that does not depend on the value of β (cf. curves
in Fig. 5(b) for β = 5 and β = 50). For negative values
of β, the invasion curves do not approach a limiting
function as β decreases (Fig. 5(b)). As a result, αc
increases monotonically with decreasing β (see Fig. 2,
main text).

Appendix B: Critical behaviour and finite-size
effects

In this section, we give details about the methods
used for obtaining the phase diagram for invasion in the
limit L → ∞ (see Fig. 2 in the main text). In addition,
we give numerical support for the statements made in
the main text about the critical behaviour displayed
by epidemics with d-synergy in the different regions
presented in Fig. 4(a) of the main text.
The data points for the phase boundary, αc (β),
in the phase diagram for invasion were obtained by
analysing both the probability of invasion, Pinv , and
the average relative number, N1 , of epidemics spanning
the system in one and only one direction (1D-spanning
epidemics). The analysis of N1 presented here is similar to that performed for avalanches in spin models
with quenched disorder31,32 .
Below we show that, for epidemics with constructive
or weakly interfering synergy, the method based on the
analysis of 1D-spanning clusters gives more accurate
estimates for αc (β) than those obtained by using Pinv .
In particular, our estimates for the invasion threshold
for non-synergistic epidemics based on N1 are in excellent agreement with the value αc (0) = τ −1 ln 2 expected from the mapping to bond-percolation valid for
β = 0? . In contrast, for epidemics with large interfering d-synergy, the estimation of αc (β) based on Pinv is
more accurate than that achieved by using N1 .

1.

Epidemics with constructive or weakly
interfering synergy

For epidemics with constructive or weakly interfering
synergy, the quantity N1 has a peak when plotted as a
function of α for a fixed value of β. This is the case for
both r- and d-synergy. Fig. 6 shows a representative
example corresponding to constructive d-synergy with
β = 0.3. The position of the peak for N1 is related to
the critical value of the parameter α separating invasive

and non-invasive regimes. Indeed, in the non-invasive
regime, N1 ≃ 0 because the clusters of removed hosts
are of small size and thus they have a negligible probability to touch the boundaries of a finite system. On
the other hand, N1 is expected to be close to zero in the
invasive regime as well because the pathogen spreads
in two directions rather than along one only. As a
result, N1 can be finite at the invasion threshold or,
due to finite-size effects, in a certain region around the
threshold. The critical value αc (β) in the limit L → ∞
is obtained using the scaling properties of N1 (α, L) in
the vicinity of the invasion threshold. Due to the absence of characteristic length scales at criticality, the
dependence of N1 on α and L is expected to obey the
following scaling law31,32 :
N1 (α, L) = Lθ Ñ1 ((α − αc )L1/ν ) ,

(B1)

where θ and ν are critical exponents and Ñ1 is a scaling
function which depends on α and L through the product (α − αc )L1/ν only. The values of θ, ν, and αc can
be determined by scaling collapse for N1 (α, L). Technically, this can be achieved by plotting the quantity
L−θ N1 vs (α − αc )L1/ν and requiring that the scaling hypothesis (B1) is satisfied (i.e. curves for different L collapse on a single master curve corresponding
to Ñ1 ). Fig. 6(b) shows an example of such scaling
collapse for d-synergy with β = 0.3. In this case,
the collapse gives the values αc = 0.445 ± 0.005 and
θ = −0.10 ± 0.05. Bearing in mind the mapping of SIR
epidemics to dynamical uncorrelated bond-percolation
holding for β = 05 , the value of ν has been fixed to
ν = 4/3 corresponding to uncorrelated percolation33 .
The good quality of the collapse suggests that, despite
the existence of correlations in transmission of infection for β 6= 0, the critical behaviour at αc (β) falls into
the universality class for the uncorrelated percolation.
This is the expected behaviour when correlations are
short-ranged34.
The above statement is also supported by the behaviour of Pinv in the vicinity of the invasion threshold

shown in Fig. 7(a) for several system sizes. The collapse in Fig. 7(b) has been obtained by setting αc to
the value αc = 0.445 obtained from the collapse of N1 .
The quality of this collapse is remarkably good despite
the fact that no free parameters have been used (i.e.
the value of ν, β, and αc has been considered as being
fixed).
If instead of fixing αc , we try to estimate its value
from the collapse of Pinv , the sigmoidal shape of Pinv
prevents the estimate from being as accurate as the
one obtained from the collapse of N1 (α, L) which are
peak-shaped.

Epidemics with large interfering d-synergy

In the main text, we have shown that epidemics with
interfering d-synergy behave as growing self-avoiding
walks (SAWs) for α ≤ αb = −β (cf. Fig. 4(a), main
text). Fig. 8(a) shows N1 vs α for epidemics with
β = −10 spreading in systems of different size. As can
be seen, growing SAWs give a constant contribution to
N1 for α ≤ 10 = αb (β). The probability that a growing SAW spans the system in one dimension decreases
with the system size, L, and thus the contribution of
such objects to N1 tends to zero as L → ∞. In our simulations, the systems are finite and contribution of the
1D SAWs to N1 is not negligible. As a consequence,
the scaling collapses of N1 based on the hypothesis by
Eq. (B1) are of low quality and not very useful for the
estimation of αc (β) for some negative values of β.
In this situation, the estimates of the critical values of the rate α are more conveniently obtained by

analysing the probability of invasion, Pinv . This quantity is less affected by the growing SAW epidemics because invasion requires reaching all the four edges of the
system. Fig. 9(a) shows the dependence of Pinv on α for
β = −10. Fig. 9(b) demonstrates the scaling collapse
of the curves displayed in panel (a) with the exponents
ν = 4/3 and β = 5/36 corresponding to uncorrelated
percolation and αc = 10.15 ± 0.03. The quality of the
collapse suggests that, despite the proximity of αc to
αb , the behaviour at large scales corresponds to that of
dynamical uncorrelated percolation. Use of the same
value of the critical rate, αc = 10.15, for N1 (α, L) results in a collapse of much poor quality (see Fig. 8). As
expected, the quality of the collapse is reasonable only
for relatively large values of (α − αc )L1/ν for which the
influence of growing SAWs is negligible.

Appendix C: Mean spatial density of invasion

In this section, we give further quantitative support
to the results discussed in the main text concerning
the effect of synergy on the spatial density of invasion.
The mean spatial density of invasion is defined as the
relative number of hosts, nR , that are in the removed
state (R) by the end of an invasive epidemic (i.e. the
relative number of hosts that have been infected during the course of the epidemic and are removed by the
end). Due to stochasticity in the transmission of infection, different realisations of invasive epidemics characterised by the same parameters α and β have a different
random value for nR . The probability density function
for the density of infection, ρ(nR ), has a single peak for
any values of the parameters α and β (see the inset in
Fig. 10). Therefore, nR has a well-defined scale that,
due to the small degree of asymmetry of ρ(nR ), can be
properly represented by the mean hns i with dispersion

Appendix D: Temporal efficiency

given by the standard deviation. Fig. 10 shows the
dependence of the spatial efficiency on β for invasive
epidemics with value of α chosen in each case so that
Pinv = 0.5. As stated in the main text, the mean density of invasion exhibits a global tendency to increase
with increasing β both for r- and d-synergy.
As expected, nR is identical for the two types of synergy if β = 0. For any non-zero value of β, the density
of infection for d-synergy, nR,d , is larger than that for
r-synergy, nR,r . In cases with constructive synergy, it
is likely that nR,d ≥ nR,r because, as argued in the
main text, synergistic effects are more prominent for
d-synergy (they operate in every transmission event).
A plausible explanation for the origin of the inequality
nR,d > nR,r for β < 0 can be given by recalling that
branching is more frequent in paths of infection for rsynergy than for d-synergy. Due to the higher degree of
branching for r-synergy, it is more probable that hosts
become effectively isolated from infection for this type
of synergy if they are simultaneously challenged by several neighbours which interfere and do not transmit
infection. As an extreme case, consider a situation in
which a host is simultaneously challenged by its all four
neighbours. It is clear that the challenged host will become inaccessible forever if infection is not transmitted
by any of the four challenging neighbours. In contrast,
the lower degree of branching for d-synergy makes the
existence of effectively isolated hosts less likely. As a
consequence, more hosts can be infected for d-synergy
during the course of epidemics.

This section complements the part of the main text
devoted to the time to invasion, tinv . Due to stochasticity in the transmission of infection, tinv is a random
variable described by a probability density function,
ρ(tinv ), which has a single peak for any values of the
parameters α and β (see the inset in Fig. 11). We can
then proceed in an analogous manner as we have done
above for the mean density of infection and describe
tinv by its mean htinv i and dispersion given by the standard deviation. Fig. 11 shows that for both types of
synergy htinv i decreases with increasing β. The dispersion of ρ(tinv ) also decreases with increasing β, as
indicated by the error bars in Fig. 11.
By definition, the time to invasion is identical for the
two types of synergy if β = 0. For β 6= 0, the largest deviations of tinv from its value without synergy (β = 0)
(cf. circles and squares in Fig. 11) are for epidemics exhibiting d-synergy. This is mostly due to the fact that
d-synergy operates in every transmission event. In average, this makes transmission events slower/quicker
for interfering/constructive d-synergy. In addition to
this factor, it is likely that the higher degree of branching in the foraging strategy for infection with interfering r-synergy also contributes to making tinv smaller
for r-synergy with β < 0.

Appendix E: Invasion as a correlated dynamical
bond-percolation problem

The aim of this section is twofold. First, we give detailed definitions for the transmissibility in synergistic
epidemics and related quantities such as its probabil-

9
ity density function (p.d.f.) and mean value. Second,
the effect of correlations on the probability of invasion
summarised in the main text is analysed here in more
detail.
1.

Transmissibility

In the presence of synergistic effects, the transmission of infection can be described as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with the time-dependent
infection rate λd-r (t) defined by Eq. (1) in the main
text. The probability that the infection has not been
transmitted in a d-r (donor-recipient) pair by time t
defines the survival probability Sd-r (t). For a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, Sd-r (t) satisfies the following differential equation35,36 :
dSd-r
= −λd-r (t)Sd-r (t) .
dt
The solution of this equation with initial condition
S(t = 0) = 1 (such a condition ensures that the
pathogen is not transmitted instantaneously when the
donor is infected) is


Zt
Sd-r (t) = exp − λd-r (t) dt .
(E1)
0

The transmissibility Td-r is defined as the probability
that the pathogen is transmitted from the donor to
the recipient over the infectious period of the donor, τ .
Therefore, it can be expressed in terms of the survival
probability as follows:
Td-r = 1 − Sd-r (τ ) .

(E2)

Substitution of the expression for Sd-r given by
Eq. (E1) into Eq. (E2) results in the following expression for Td-r :

 Z τ
λd-r (t) dt .
(E3)
Td-r = 1 − exp −
0

In the absence of synergistic effects, the rate
λd-r (t) = α remains constant over the infectious period τ and is the same for all d-r pairs. In this case,
the transmissibility reduces to the homogeneous value,
Td-r = 1−e−τ α , that plays a central role in the mapping
of SIR epidemics to the well-known uncorrelated dynamical percolation5,14 . In this mapping, Td-r is identified with the bond probability and Pinv from an initially inoculated site is identified with the probability
P∞ that such site belongs to the infinite cluster of connected sites in the dynamical percolation problem33 .
For SIR epidemics, Pinv is fully parameterised by Td-r .
This is analogous to the fact that P∞ is fully parameterised by the bond probability in dynamical percolation.
When synergy is present, the transmissibility Td-r is
a functional that depends on the time evolution of the

rate λd-r (t) which, in turn, depends on the infection
history of the neighbouring hosts to the d-r pair. Each
d-r pair involved in an epidemic is in general characterised by a different dependence of the rate λd-r (t)
on time. As a consequence, the field of transmissibilities is spatially heterogeneous. In addition, the dependence of Td-r on the neighbourhood of the d-r pair
introduces non-trivial correlations in transmission and
thus in transmissibilities.
In order to study the role of synergy-induced correlated heterogeneity at the host level on Pinv we proceed
in a way inspired from previous works dealing with heterogeneous SIR epidemics7,37? –40 . The simplest situation with heterogeneity in transmission corresponds
to epidemics where Td-r are independent random variables for all d-r pairs. In this case, Pinv only depends
on the mean transmissibility, hT i6,41 . In more complicated situations, the transmissibilities for different
d-r pairs are not independent and Pinv is a function of
the whole set of transmissibilities, {Td-r }, that cannot
be completely parametrised by hT i7,37? –40 . An exact
mapping of such SIR epidemics to uncorrelated percolation is not possible in general. However, the use
of hT i can still be useful to analyse the consequences
that heterogeneity in local transmission has on Pinv .
For instance, a considerable progress has been made
in understanding the role of correlations in epidemics
where heterogeneity in transmission is associated with
heterogeneity in recovery times of infected hosts. In
this case, the following important result has been rigorously derived37–39 : for a given value of hT i, the resilience to invasion increases with increasing degree of
het
hom
heterogeneity (more precisely, Pinv
(hT i) ≤ Pinv
(hT i),
het
hom
where Pinv and Pinv are the probabilities of invasion
for heterogeneously and homogeneously distributed removal times, respectively). Here, we show that the
dependence of Pinv on hT i for synergistic epidemics is
more complicated (see Fig. 12). In spite of that, in
subsections E 2 and E 3 we show that analysing the dependence of Pinv on the degree of synergy for given hT i
is still informative.
For synergistic epidemics we define the mean transmissibility in terms of two averages: spatial average in
each realisation of epidemics and stochastic over different epidemic realisations. The spatial average for
transmissibility, T r , is calculated for a particular r-th
realisation of the epidemic in the following manner,
Tr =

1 X
Td-r ,
Nd-r
d-r

where the sum extends over the number Nd-r of d-r
pairs in the final state of the epidemic, i.e. over all d-r
pairs challenged by the infection. The value of Td-r in
the above equation for each d-r pair is calculated using
Eq. (E3) with the transmission rate λd-r (t) measured
numerically for the r-th realisation of epidemic. The
direct numerical evaluation of the transmissibility for
synergistic epidemics as a frequency of successful transmission of infection between donor and recipient in the
d-r pair would require reproduction of time-dependent

The analysis of ρ(Td-r ) is important for understanding
the dependence of Pinv on the degree of synergy and
hT i, as we show below for r- and d-synergy.

where the value of T r is averaged over R different stochastic realisations of the epidemic. Note
that averaging over stochastic realisations is necessary
to account for the fact that different realisations of
epidemics lead to different spatial configurations for
{Td-r }.
Bearing in mind that the population of hosts is homogeneous (i.e. α and β do not depend on the d-r pair
location) the values of transmissibilities for any d-r pair
given by Eq. (E3) are independent random variables
characterized by a p.d.f., ρ(Td-r ). Once ρ(Td-r ) is available, e.g. numerically, the mean transmissibility can
equivalently be calculated as
hT i =

R τ rates giving exactly the same integral over
time, − 0 λd-r (t)dt (i.e. all possible rates λd-r (t) giving the same value of Td-r in Eq. (E3)). This imposes
a very restrictive condition on the time of infection of
the nodes in the neighbourhood of the d-r pair and
thus evaluation of Td-r as a frequency can be hardly a
feasible computational task. The mean transmissibility, hT i, is obtained by stochastic averaging of T r for
R different realisations of the epidemic:

r-synergy

Fig. 12 shows the dependence of Pinv on hT i for
several values of β. For any fixed value of hT i, the
probability of invasion with interfering synergy (see the
curves corresponding to β < 0 and marked by open and
solid circles and open squares in Fig. 12) is systematically greater than for non-synergistic epidemics (see
the curve for β = 0 marked by solid circles in Fig. 12),
i.e. the populations exhibiting interfering r-synergy
are more vulnerable to invasion than those without
synergy. For constructive r-synergy, it is possible to
distinguish between two different regimes. The first
regime corresponds to epidemics with moderate synergy (curves for β = 0.8 and 2 in Fig. 12) that are less
invasive than non-synergistic epidemics for all values of
hT i, i.e. the curves marked by the solid diamonds and
stars are always below the curve marked by the solid
squares. The second regime corresponds to larger values of β (e.g. β = 50 and 100 in Fig. 12). In this case,
there is a range of hT i where the curves marked by
open triangles and crosses are above the curve marked
by the solid squares. In this interval for hT i, the epidemics with constructive r-synergy are more invasive
than those without synergy.

FIG. 12. Probability of invasion as a function of the mean
transmissibility for r-synergy in systems of linear size L =
31. Different curves correspond to different values of β as
marked in the figure.

These features can be qualitatively illustrated by
analysing the evolution of the distribution of transmissibilities, ρ(Td-r ), with the strength of synergy.
Without synergy, ρ(Td-r ) has a δ-functional shape,
ρ(Td-r ) = δ(Td-r − T1 ), where T1 = 1 − e−ατ is the
non-synergistic transmissibility. The epidemic is invasive (non-invasive) if T1 > Tc = 1/2 (T1 ≤ Tc )5 . Once
r-synergy is introduced, the shape of ρ(Td-r ) changes.
The δ-functional peak is still present and it describes
recipients with a single infected neighbour, nr = 1.
In addition, new contributions to ρ(Td-r ) appear for
Td-r < T1 (Td-r > T1 ) in case of negative (positive)
values of β (see the lower panel in Fig. 13 where the
δ-functional peak at Td-r = T1 is marked by ⋄). Such
contributions come from recipients surrounded by more
than one infected neighbour, i.e. nr > 1. The number of infected neighbours varies in discrete manner
and this brings a non-smooth functional dependence
to ρ(Td-r ) consisting of cusps associated with the discrete changes in nr (t) and smooth components between
cusps originated from the continuity of time. In other
words, nr (t) is a piece-wise function of time the integral
of which produces a continuous set of transmissibilities
according to Eq. (E3).
For interfering synergy, the average transmissibility is hT i < T1 , due to the contribution to ρ(Td-r )
of Td-r < T1 described above. If the heterogeneous
transmissions associated with synergy were uncorrelated, the probability of invasion for synergistic epidemics with the elementary rate α would be smaller
than that corresponding to epidemics with the same
value of α but without synergy. This is a consequence
of the fact that the probability of invasion for systems
with heterogeneous but uncorrelated transmissions depends on hT i only6,38,41 . However, this is not the case
for epidemics with interfering synergy which are more
invasive than epidemics without synergy. This is due to
correlations between synergistic transmissibilities. Indeed, the d-r pairs that passed the infection in an epi-

demic (mostly those with non-synergistic transmissibility T1 ) are arranged in a spatially correlated finger-like
manner (as shown in Fig. 3(b) in the main text) that
makes invasion possible. Therefore, the synergistic epidemics can be mapped onto the correlated dynamical
bond-percolation problem in which the bond probabilities are associated with transmissibilities.

likely. Moreover, these pairs are placed in a spatially
correlated manner which also favours the invasion for
hT i < Tc .

For constructive synergy with moderate values of β
(corresponding to the first regime mentioned above),
most of the d-r pairs in the system have transmissibility
T1 < Tc = 1/2 (cf. the position of the peak marked by ⋄
with the rest of the distribution in the panel for β = 0.2
in Fig. 13). Most of the synergistic d-r pairs have Td-r >
Tc as can be seen from the comparison of the areas
under the curve for p.d.f. for Td-r < Tc (excluding nonsynergistic transmissibilities under the peak marked by
⋄) and Td-r > Tc . However, the abundance and value
of the transmissibilities for such synergistic pairs does
not seem to be high enough as to allow for invasion
unless hT i is clearly larger than Tc .

The p.d.f. ρ(Td-r ) for epidemics with d-synergy is
shown in Fig. 14 for several values of β. At first sight,
the effects of d-synergy on ρ(Td-r ) are qualitatively similar to those of r-synergy. However, for d-synergy, the
δ-functional peak for the non-synergistic transmissibility T0 marked by ⋄ corresponds to realisations of the
epidemic when the pathogen has not been transmitted from the initially infected host to any of its neighbours (i.e. the epidemic has not started spreading).
Only in this case nd = 0 over the whole infectious period of the initially inoculated host and Td-r = T0 . In
contrast, Td-r 6= T0 for every d-r pair if the epidemic
starts, meaning that there is no contribution to the
δ-functional peak from these epidemics.
The scenario for epidemics with interfering d-synergy
is similar to that for r-synergy, meaning that invasion
can occur for values of hT i < Tc (cf. the curves for

For larger values of β, invasion is possible for hT i <
Tc because, as shown in Fig. 13 for β = 5, the relative
number of synergistic pairs is large enough and they
have T ≃ 1 so that the transmission of infection is very

β < 0 and β = 0 in Fig. 15). For any fixed negative
value of β, the shift (to the left) of the invasion curve
from the synergy-free one, Pinv (hT i) with β = 0, is
greater for d-synergy than for r-synergy. Correlations
in transmission seem to play a very prominent role for
d-synergy since invasion can occur even for very low
values of hT i. The fact that d-synergy induces larger
shifts for the Pinv (hT i) curve towards smaller values of
hT i than r-synergy is due to the greater abundance of
synergistic connections for d-synergy, as argued in the
main text. This is clear from the comparison of the
p.d.f. ρ(Td-r ) for β < 0 corresponding to the two types
of synergy shown in Figs. 13 and 14. The relative number of non-synergistic d-r pairs with non-synergistic
transmissibility T0 is always smaller for d-synergy.
For constructive d-synergy, there are two regimes
that are qualitatively similar to those discussed for constructive r-synergy above. The regime where invasion
is only possible for hT i > Tc exists for very weak constructive synergy (0 < β . 0.1). Figs. 15 and 14 illustrate the behaviour in this regime for β = 0.1. For
greater values of β, invasion is possible for hT i < Tc =
1/2 (see the curves for β ≥ 0.4 in Fig. 15). This is
due to the presence of a large number of synergistic

transmissions with Td-r > Tc , as illustrated in Fig. 14
for β = 0.8. As argued above, the peak at T0 is due
to epidemics that do not start spreading. The rest of
contributions to ρ(Td-r ) corresponds to those cases in
which the pathogen is transmitted from the initially
infected host to at least one of its neighbours. The
values of the transmissibilities for such epidemics are
larger and thus Pinv is also larger. In this case, invasion is possible for any positive value of hT i because
the epidemic is invasive with high probability provided
it starts spreading. In other words, many epidemics do
not start spreading for very low value of α (and thus
low transmissibility). However, the probability that
the epidemic starts spreading is larger than zero for
any α > 0. Once it starts, invasion almost certainly
occurs. Therefore, invasion is possible for any positive
value of α, no matter how small the value of α is.

We start analysis of the simplified model for synergistic SIR process on a square lattice (for concreteness)
with the case of d-synergy. Let us consider an infected
node (other than the initially infected host) which attempts to transmit infection (create a bond) to one of
its susceptible neighbours during its infectious period
τ = 1. This process can occur with different probability depending on the number of infected nodes linked
to the infecting one (donor). Applying assumptions
(i)-(ii) that transmissibilities are uncorrelated and a
certain random neighbourhood does not change over
the infectious period of the donor, we can calculate the
mean transmissibility in the following way,

FIG. 15. Probability of invasion as a function of the mean
transmissibility for d-synergy in systems of linear size L =
31. Different curves correspond to different values of β as
marked in the figure.

The phase transition from non-invasive to invasive
SIR regime in heterogeneous systems with uncorrelated
transmissibilities occurs when
hT i = Tc ,

(F1)

where Tc is a critical topology-dependent bondpercolation probability (Tc = 1/2 for a square lattice)
and hT i is the mean transmissibility6,41 . For a synergistic SIR process, the transmissibilities are heterogeneous
due to variable neighbourhood during infection (bond
creating) process and correlated as it follows from our
analysis of probability of invasion vs mean transmissibilities (see Sec. E). Such correlations make exact
analytical treatment for synergistic SIR process hardly
possible. However, if the correlations between transmissibilities are ignored then a simplified model for
synergistic SIR process can be introduced and solved
analytically for the boundaries in the phase diagram.
The simplified assumptions of the model are the following:
(i) there are no correlations in transmissibilities;
(ii) the neighbourhood of a r-d pair does not change
over the infectious period of the donor;
(iii) the probabilities of various neighbourhoods of a
d-r do not depend on the rates α and β;
Under these assumptions, the analytical expressions
for the phase boundaries reproducing qualitatively all
the features found numerically can be derived and analysed.

for square lattice.
The locus of critical points for d-synergy given by
Eqs (F6) and (F7) is shown in Fig. 16 (dot-dashed
line). The intersections of the critical line with the
straight lines, β = −α/n (n = 1, 2, 3), correspond
to the changes in the regimes for the infection rates
in Eqs. (F6) and (F7) and thus lead to appearance
of the kinks (discontinuities in the derivatives) on the
critical line. Within our approximations, the values
of pn for square lattice are such that there is only
one kink on the phase boundary for simple analytical model (corresponding to the crossing point of the
phase boundary with β = −α/3) and in the asymptotic
regime, β → −∞, the phase boundary approaches linear asymptote, β ≃ β0′ − α/2 (with positive constant
β0′ > 0).
Kinks are also expected on the phase boundary for
the exact model. In order to check this, we have
analysed the behaviour of the exact phase boundary
obtained numerically around the point of intersection
with the line β = −α/2 (cf. Fig. 16). We have tested
the presence of a kink by fitting a linear dependence
β = a + bα to the data above and below the intersection. This procedure reveals a significant difference in
the slope which takes values b = −0.97 and b = −1.26
above and below the intersection, respectively.
The locus of critical points in α − β parameter space
derived within the simple analytical model (dot-dashed
line in Fig. 16) is similar in shape to that obtained numerically (dashed line marked by the circles in Fig. 16).
However, due to simplifying approximations (i)-(iii),
the analytical model does not capture the asymptotic
behaviour, β ≃ β0 − α (with positive constant β0 > 0),
obtained numerically for β → ∞. This could be due

to the fact that the actual probabilities pn (possibly
depending on α and β might be quite different from
those used in the analytical model (see Eqs. (F4)). The
difference in gradients in the small-β limit between analytically and numerically found phase boundaries can
be due to similar reasons.

r-synergy

For r-synergy, the transmission of infection from a
donor to a recipient can occur in the presence of different number of infected neighbours (in addition to the
donor) of the recipient (for concreteness, we consider
a square lattice for which n = 1, 2, 3). Under assumptions (i) and (ii), the mean transmissibility for the d-r
pair is,
hT i =

3
X

qn Tn ,

(F11)

n=0

where qn is the probability that the recipient has n infected neighbours (in addition to the donor) and synergistic transmissibilities are given by Eq. (F3) where
n = 0, 1, 2, 3. The probabilities qn of different neighbourhoods of the recipient can be defined through the
probability, t (parameter of the model), that a nearest neighbour of the recipient host (different from the
donor) is in the infected state,
qn = Cn3 tn (1 − t)3−n ,

(F12)

where we used the assumption about the independence
of infection events for different neighbours of recipient.
Given assumption (iii), from Eq. (F1) written in the
form,
Tc =

The value of αc (∞) can be both positive and negative.

q0 = (1 − t)3 > 1 − Tc ,

by tuning t (see the curve for t = 0.152), then the gradient at small |β| and position of the vertical border
are significantly off the numerical values. Such deviations area consequence of approximations (i)-(iii) used
in the analytical model.
Overall, comparing the two types of synergy within
the simple analytical model we can conclude that the
main differences between them come from the presence
of non-synergistic transmission events that are possible
for r-synergy with any value of β when the recipient is
challenged by a single infected neighbour. Such transmission events with transmissibility ∝ 1 − e−α are responsible for the appearance of the asymptotic value
αc (∞) and vertical border α∗ for r-synergy.

where hni is the mean value of infected neighbours (excluding the donor) of the recipient.
In the limiting case, β → −∞, the behaviour of the
analytical critical line depends on the value of t. In
particular, if q0 = (1 − t)3 > Tc then the critical line
intersects the straight lines β = −α/n (resulting in
kinks on the critical line) for all values of n = 1, 2, 3
and becomes a vertical border at α = α∗ for β ≤ −α∗ .
Numerical data support such a scenario with the vertical border. The positions of both asymptotic value
of αc (∞) and vertical border α∗ vary with the value of
t. In Fig. 17, the analytical critical lines are shown for
two values of the node occupation probability t. For
t = 0.047, the behavior around small values of β and
position of the vertical border found numerically are
reproduced quite well by the analytical model. However, the analytical curve strongly deviates from the
numerical one for β ≫ 1 and fails to reproduce the
value of αc (∞). If we try to mimic the value of αc (∞)
