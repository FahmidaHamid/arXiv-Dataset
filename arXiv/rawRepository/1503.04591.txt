Despite the routine prescription of rate control therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF), clinical evidence demonstrating a heart rate target is lacking. Aim of the present study was to run a
mathematical model simulating AF episodes with a different heart rate (HR) to predict hemodynamic parameters for each situation.

Methods
The lumped model, representing the pumping heart together with systemic and pulmonary
circuits, was run to simulate AF with HR of 50, 70, 90, 110 and 130 bpm, respectively.

Results

Published: March 12, 2015

Left ventricular pressure increased by 57%, from 33.92±37.56 mmHg to 53.15±47.56
mmHg, and mean systemic arterial pressure increased by 27%, from 82.66±14.04 mmHg to
105.3±7.6 mmHg, at the 50 and 130 bpm simulations, respectively. Stroke volume (from
77.45±8.50 to 39.09±8.08 mL), ejection fraction (from 61.10±4.40 to 39.32±5.42%) and
stroke work (SW, from 0.88±0.04 to 0.58±0.09 J) decreased by 50, 36 and 34%, at the 50
and 130 bpm simulations, respectively. In addition, oxygen consumption indexes (rate pressure product – RPP, tension time index per minute – TTI/min, and pressure volume area per
minute – PVA/min) increased from the 50 to the 130 bpm simulation, respectively, by 186%
(from 5598±1939 to 15995±3219 mmHg/min), 56% (from 2094±265 to 3257±301 mmHg s/
min) and 102% (from 57.99±17.90 to 117.4±26.0 J/min). In fact, left ventricular efficiency
(SW/PVA) decreased from 80.91±2.91% at 50 bpm to 66.43±3.72% at the 130 bpm
HR simulation.

A Mathematical Model for AF Rate Control

Conclusion
Awaiting compulsory direct clinical evidences, the present mathematical model suggests
that lower HRs during permanent AF relates to improved hemodynamic parameters, cardiac
efficiency, and lower oxygen consumption.

Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained tachyarrhythmia, affects 1% to 2% of the
general population [1]. In case the arrhythmia progresses to permanent [2], on top of oral anticoagulants, rate control is recommended to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life [3].
Despite the routine prescription of AF rate control therapy [4], clinical evidence demonstrating
a heart rate target is lacking. Only the RACE II clinical trial [5, 6] suggested that lenient and
strict rate control strategies may not differ in terms of mid-term cardiovascular outcomes.
Awaiting further clinical evidences, the use of a novel mathematical model [7], validated
through systematic comparison with directly measured parameters and able to simulate the response of the cardiovascular system in sinus rhythm and AF, holds the potential to theoretically suggest an optimal heart rate to target.
Aim of the present study was to run the mathematical model during simulated AF episodes
with heart rate ranging from 50 to 130 bpm and predict hemodynamic parameters for
each situation.

Materials and Methods
Mathematical model
The present lumped model, consisting of a network of compliances, resistances, and inductances, simulates the pumping heart together with the systemic and pulmonary circuits [7].
The resultant differential system is composed, for each cardiac chamber or vascular section, by
an equation for the mass conservation, an equation of motion, and a linear state equation, and
is expressed in terms of pressure, P, volume, V, and flow rate, Q. The differential equations are
numerically solved through a multistep adaptative solver for stiff problems, based on the
ode15s Matlab function [8]. All hemodynamic parameters and plots are computed and implemented in Matlab, as well. The model has been compared with more than thirty different clinical state of the art studies, providing an overall good agreement in predicting the impact of AF
[7].
Both atria are maintained passive to mimic the loss of atrial kick, while RR values are extracted from an exponentially modified Gaussian distribution [7], which is the most common
RR distribution recorded during AF [9]. By varying the HR from 50 to 130 bpm, each distribution is built keeping the coefficient of variation, cv = σ/μ (03C3: standard deviation, μ: mean of
the RR distribution), equal to 0.24, which is the typical value observed during AF beating [10].
The resulting probability distribution functions for 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130 bpm, are shown in
Fig. 1.
For every HR, 5000 cardiac cycles are computed, which allows the statistical stationarity of
the modeling results. Therefore, all the variables of the present work are intended as averaged
over 5000 periods.

Definitions of variables
In terms of pressure and volume, by evaluating also end-systolic (es) and end-diastolic (ed) values, as well as left ventricular pressure peak values (maximum and minimum), the following
parameters are computed: left atrial pressure (Pla, Plaed, Plaes), left atrial volume (Vla, Vlaed,
Vlaes), left ventricular pressure (Plv, Plved, Plves, Plv,max, Plv,min), left ventricular volume (Vlv,
Vlved, Vlves), systemic arterial pressure (Psas, Psas,syst, Psas,dias), pulmonary arterial (Ppas, Ppas,syst,
Ppas,dias) and venous (Ppvn) pressures. End-systolic values refer to the instant defined by the closure of the aortic valve, while end-diastolic values correspond to the closure of the mitral valve.
Concerning left ventricle performance the following parameters are also computed: stroke
volume, SV = Vlved—Vlves, ejection fraction, EF = SV/Vlved x 100, stroke work, SW, evaluated as
the area within the left ventricle pressure-volume loop, and cardiac output, CO = SV x HR. To
estimate the oxygen consumption, the following indirect measurements were computed [11]:
rate pressure product, RPP = Psas,syst x HR, tension time index per minute [12], TTI/min = Plv,
mean x RR x HR, and pressure volume area per minute [13], PVA/min = (PE + SW) x HR,
where PE = Plves x (Vlves – Vlv,un)/2—Plved x (Vlved—Vlv,un)/4 is the elastic potential energy (Vlv,
un = 5 ml is the unstressed left ventricle volume), while SW is the stroke work. The left ventricular efficiency is defined by the ratio SW/PVA.

Results
The mathematical model was run to simulate AF with heart rate (HR) of 50, 70, 90, 110 and
130 bpm, respectively. All computed parameters, stratified by HR, are listed in Table 1. Left

ventricular efficiency (SW/PVA) decreased from 80.91±2.91% at 50 bpm to 66.43±3.72% at
the 130 bpm HR simulation.

Discussion
Based on the presented mathematical simulations a slower (50 bpm), compared to higher (130
bpm), HR during AF relates to improved ventricular pressure, systemic pressure and left ventricular efficiency (e.g. SW/PVA).
Given several clinical trial (AFFIRM [14, 15], RACE [16]) proving, within patients with persistent AF, that rate is not inferior to rhythm control in terms of mortality from cardiovascular
causes, AF rate control therapy is widely prescribed. Despite this, clinical evidence demonstrating a clear heart rate target is lacking. A randomized multicenter non-inferiority clinical trial,
the RACE II [5, 6], suggested that, in patients with permanent AF, lenient rate control (target
resting HR below 110 bpm) is not inferior to strict (target resting HR below 80 and during
moderate exercise below 110 bpm) in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, substudies

of this trial also underlined that stringency of rate control does not influence neither cardiac remodeling [17] nor quality of life [18].
However, as previously highlighted [19], the RACE II study presented several limitations.
First, the modest difference in average heart rates achieved in the lenient and strict control
groups (85 and 75 bpm, respectively) and the limited sample size of the study (about 300 patients per group). In addition, the number of patients who met the primary outcome of the
study (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke,
systemic embolism, major bleeding, arrhythmic events, cardiac arrest, life-threatening adverse
effects of rate-control drugs and implantation of a pacemaker or cardioverter–defibrillator)
was small, most probably due to the low-risk population enrolled (e.g. patients with previous
stroke were excluded).
Awaiting mandatory further clinical evidences, the present study aims at investigating, with
a model-based approach, the global response of the cardiovascular system during episodes of
AF at different ventricular rates. The present mathematical model has previously been thoroughly validated and showed strong concordance of the computed parameters with several
data directly measured in vivo [7]. However, two considerations should be kept in mind: first,
the model predicts hemodynamic effects of AF in absence of other associated conditions or pathologies, e.g. hypertension [20], that could themselves affect cardiovascular parameters; second, the model does not consider the impact that rate control drugs (e.g. digoxin, beta
blockers, non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers) could exert on the cardiovascular system. As a consequence, the reported parameters differ among each simulation strictly depending on ventricular rate.
Left ventricular pressure greatly increased at faster ventricular rates (as shown in Fig. 2).
The relative shortening of diastolic time at the fastest HR simulations, in our opinion, mainly
drives this finding. In fact, the increase in mean Plved values (below 4 mmHg) does not balance
the dramatic absolute and relative increase of the mean Plv (nearly 20 mmHg). Moreover, Plves
and both pressure peak values do not significantly vary (minimum pressure peaks remain even
constant as HR increases).
Contextually, it is important to underline that the reduction in Vlv is mainly founded on the
decrease of Vlved. In general, ventricular filling is known to be reduced during AF, due to loss of
the atrial kick, however, the contribution of this cardiac phase is highly dependent on heart
rate, becoming fundamental in case it is increased (e.g. physical exercise [21]), due to the fact
that passive ventricular filling in early diastole is reduced concomitantly to a shortened diastolic time. The same mechanisms may, in fact, explain the greater Vlved reduction in AF simulations with a faster ventricular rate. In addition higher HRs lead also to a quite strong rise of
Psas, most probably related to an increase in diastolic pressure accounting for a greater afterload
for the left heart to overcome.
Based on the model’s predictions, lower HRs during AF relate to improved mechanic and
energetic indexes. First, the reduction of SV and SW seen with the progressively higher HRs
translates into a left ventricle’s EF decrease by far greater than the physiological reduction expected [22]. Furthermore, the increase in oxygen consumption indexes is relevant with the progressively higher HRs simulations. In fact, RPP triplicates and PVA/min doubles their mean
values from the lowest (50 bpm) to the highest (130 bpm) HR simulation, extensively supporting that faster ventricular rates relate to a rise in cardiac energetic expense not associated with a
concomitant increase in mechanical performance (e.g. CO). Finally, left ventricle efficiency
(SW/PVA) proved to significantly decrease at progressively higher HRs simulated during the
AF episodes, well synthesizing how mechanic and energetic indexes of the heart present an improved profile at slower HRs that allow the fibrillating heart to better convert energy into
external work.

A Mathematical Model for AF Rate Control

Eventually, although the present model currently does not present the ability to predict such
setting, during exertion (a situation in which inotropism and chronotropism increase due to
sympathetic stimulation) the reduction in left ventricle efficiency caused by faster HR may become even more limiting, perhaps, at least partially, accounting for the lower resistance to effort common in subjects with AF.

Limitations
In addition to what previously discussed, the following limitations must be taken in account.
First, the present mathematical model simulates a denervated heart; the effects of the autonomic nervous system on cardiac performance are therefore not included. Second, due to difficulties in the mathematical modelling of the coronary arteries dynamics, in the present model the
coronary circle is not taken in account. Third, the present model-based approach predicts the
global response of the cardiovascular system during episodes of AF at different HRs. For the
purpose of the present study we considered “relevant” variations (maximum % variation),
within the different HR simulations, above 15%. Concerning parameters not reaching this
limit, such as left atrial parameters (Pla and Vla) or pulmonary pressures (Ppas and Ppvn) it cannot be concluded if either different HRs do not significantly affect their values, or the present
model may not be able to detect variations.

Conclusion
In conclusion, awaiting compulsory direct clinical evidences, the present mathematical model
suggests that lower HRs during permanent AF relates to improved hemodynamic parameters
and cardiac efficiency, resulting in lower oxygen consumption for a given cardiac work.
