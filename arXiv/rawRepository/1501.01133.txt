Abstract. Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data provides a quantitative measure of blood
perfusion, that can be correlated to neuronal activation. In contrast to
BOLD measure, it is a direct measure of cerebral blood flow. However,
ASL data has a lower SNR and resolution so that the recovery of the perfusion response of interest suffers from the contamination by a stronger
hemodynamic component in the ASL signal. In this work we consider a
model of both hemodynamic and perfusion components within the ASL
signal. A physiological link between these two components is analyzed
and used for a more accurate estimation of the perfusion response function in particular in the usual ASL low SNR conditions.

Introduction

Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) [1] provides a direct measure of cerebral blood
flow (CBF), overcoming one of the most important limitations of Blood Oxygen
Level Dependent (BOLD) signal [2]: BOLD contrast cannot quantify cerebral
perfusion. In contrast to BOLD, ASL is able to provide a measure of baseline
CBF as well as quantitative CBF signal changes in response to stimuli presented to any volunteer in the scanner during an experimental paradigm. Hence,
ASL enables the comparison of CBF changes between experiments and subjects
(healthy vs patients) making its application to clinics feasible. In addition, ASL
signal localization is closer to neural activity. ASL has already been used in clinics in steady-state for instance for probing CBF discrepancy in pathologies like
Alzheimer’s disease and stroke, but its use in the functional MRI context has
been limited so far. Despite ASL advantages, its main limitation lies in its low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), which, together with its low temporal and spatial
resolutions, makes the analysis of such data more challenging.
According to [3,4], ASL signal has been typically analyzed with a general
linear model (GLM) approach, accounting for a BOLD component mixed with
the perfusion component. In such a setting both the hemodynamic response
function (HRF or BRF for BOLD response function) and perfusion response
function (PRF) are assumed to be the same and to fit the canonical BRF shape.
In contrast, an adaptation of the Joint-Detection estimation (JDE) framework [5]

2

A. Frau-Pascual et al.

to ASL data has been proposed in [6,7] to separately estimate BRF and PRF
shapes, and implicitly consider the control/label effect which, as stated in [4],
increases the sensitivity of the analysis compared to differencing approaches. Although this JDE extension provides a good estimate of the BRF, the PRF estimation remains much more difficult because of the noisier nature of the perfusion
component within the ASL signal. In the past decade, physiological models have
been described to explain the physiological changes caused by neural activity.
In [8,9], neural coupling, which maps neural activity to ensuing CBF, and the
Balloon model, which relates CBF to BOLD signal, have been introduced. These
models describe the process from neural activation to the BOLD measure, and
the impact of neural activation on other physiological parameters.
Here, we propose to rely on these physiological models to derive a tractable
linear link between perfusion and BOLD components within the ASL signal and
to exploit this link as a prior knowledge for the accurate and reliable recovery of
the PRF shape in functional ASL data analysis. This way, we refine the separate
estimation of the response functions in [6,7] by taking physiological information
into consideration. The structure of this paper goes as follows: the physiological
model and its linearization to find the PRF/BRF link are presented in section 2.
Starting then from the ASL JDE model described in section 3, we extend the
estimation framework to account for the physiological link in section 4. Finally,
results on artificial and real data are presented and discussed in sections 5-7.

A physiologically informed ASL/BOLD link

Our goal is to derive an approximate physiologically informed relationship between the perfusion and hemodynamic response functions so as to improve their
estimation in a JDE framework [6,7]. We show in this section that, although
this relationship is an imperfect link resulting from a linearization, it provides
a good approximation and allows to capture important features such as a shift
in time-to-peak from one response to another. For a physiologically validated
model, we use the extended balloon model described below.
2.1

The extended Balloon model

The Balloon model was first proposed in [10] to link neuronal and vascular processes by considering the capillary as a balloon that dilates under the effect of
blood flow variations. More specifically, the model describes how, after some
stimulation, the local blood flow fin ptq increases and leads to the subsequent
augmentation of the local capillary volume νptq. This incoming blood is strongly
oxygenated but only part of the oxygen is consumed. It follows a local decrease of
the deoxyhemoglobin concentration ξptq and therefore a BOLD signal variation.
The Balloon model was then extended in [8] to include the effect of the neuronal
activity uptq on the variation of some auto-regulated flow inducing signal ψptq
so as to eventually link neuronal to hemodynamic activity. The global physiological model corresponds then to a non-linear system with four state variables

is used for normalized functions by convention. The system depends on 5 hemodynamic parameters: τψ , τf and τm are time constants respectively for signal
decay/elimination, auto-regulatory feedback from blood flow and mean transit
time, w̃ reflects the ability of the vein to eject blood, and E0 is the oxygen extraction fraction. Another parameter η is the neuronal efficacy weighting term
that models neuronal efficacy variability.
Once the solution of the previous system is found, Buxton et al [10] proposed
the following expression that links the BOLD response hptq to the physiological
quantities considering intra-vascular and extra-vascular components:
hptq “ V0 rk1 p1 ´ ξptqq ` k2 p1 ´

strength of 1.5T and echo time T E “ 40ms.

[8]: V0 “ 0.02, τψ “ 1.25, τf “ 2.5, τm “ 1, w̃ “ 0.2, E0 “ 0.8 and η “ 0.5.

model are shown in Fig. 1 under the label “Friston 00” (dashed line). The rest

of the curves show the effect of changing the physiological parameters: η is a
scaling factor and causes non-linearities above a certain value; τψ controls the
signal decay, which is more or less smooth; the auto-regulatory feedback τf
regulates the undershoot; the transit time τm expands or contracts the signal
in time; the windkessel parameter w̃ models the initial dip and the response
magnitude; the oxygen extraction E0 impacts the response scale. After analysing
the behaviour of the model when varying the parameters values, the impact of
each parameter was investigated and we concluded that the values proposed in
[8] seemed reasonable.
2.2

Physiological linear relationship between response functions

From the system of equations previously defined, we derive an approximate
relationship between the PRF, namely gptq, and the BRF, which is given by
hptq when uptq is an impulse function. Both BRF and PRF are percent signal
changes, and we consider gptq “ fin ptq ´ 1, as fin ptq is the normalized perfusion,
with initial value 1. Therefore the state variables are tψ, g, 1 ´ ν, 1 ´ ξu.
In the following we will drop the time index t and consider functions h, ψ, etc.
in their discretized vector form. We can obtain a simple relationship between h
and g by linearizing the system of equations. Equation (2) can first be linearized
into:
h “ V0 rpk1 ` k2 qp1 ´ ξq ` pk3 ´ k2 qp1 ´ νqs .

(3)

We then linearize the system (1) around the resting point tψ, g, 1 ´ ν, 1 ´ ξu “
t0, 0, 0, 0u as in [11]. From this linearization, denoting by D the first order differential operator and I the identity matrix, we get:

functions, computed by using the physiological model differential equations. Note
that, although time-to-peak (TTP) values are not exact, the linear operator
maintains the shape of the functions and satisfyingly captures the main features
of the two responses. We considered a finer temporal resolution than TR for Ω
and, besides this, there is no direct dependence on the TR.
The derivation of this linear operator gives us a new tool for analyzing the
ASL signal, although this link is subject to caution as linearity assumption is
strong and this linearization induces approximation error.

Bayesian hierarchical model for ASL data analysis

The ASL JDE model described in [6,7] assumes a partitioned brain into several
functional homogeneous parcels each of which gathers signals which share the
same response shapes. In a given parcel P, the generative model for ASL time
series, measured at times ptn qn“1:N where tn “ nTR, N is the number of scans

The signal is decomposed into (a) task-related BOLD and (b) perfusion components given by the first two terms respectively; (c) a drift component P `j already
considered in the BOLD JDE [5]; (d) a perfusion baseline term αj w which completes the modelling of the perfusion component; and (e) a noise term.
ASL fMRI data consists in the consecutive and alternated acquisitions of
control and magnetically tagged images. The tagged image embodies a perfusion
component besides the BOLD one, which is present in the control image too.

The BOLD component is noisier compared to standard BOLD fMRI acquisition.
The control/tag effect is implicit in the ASL JDE model with the use of matrix

follow prior Gaussian distributions h ∼ N p0, vh Σ h q and g ∼ N p0, vg Σ g q, with
covariance matrices Σ h and Σ g encoding a constraint on the second order derivative so as to account for temporal smoothness. The BOLD (BRLs) and perfusion
(PRLs) response levels (resp. a and c) are assumed to follow different spatial
Gaussian mixture models but governed by common binary hidden Markov random fields tqjm , j P Pu encoding voxels’ activation (qjm “ 1, 0 for activated, resp.
non-activated) states for each experimental condition m. This way, BRLs and
PRLs are independent conditionally to q: ppa, c | qq. An Ising model on q introduces spatial correlation as in [6,7]. For further interest please refer to [5].
Univariate Gamma/Gaussian mixtures were used instead in [12] at the expense

A physiologically informed 2-steps inference procedure

The BOLD component is known to have a higher SNR than the perfusion component in the ASL signal, and can be estimated with a higher confidence. The
link g “ Ωh that we derived between both components can then be used to
inform the PRF from the BRF. Using this link the other way around may not
be satisfying as it may result in a contamination of h by a noisier g.
This effect has been noticed in the implementation of a physiologically informed Bayesian procedure, considering the generative model (7), and the following priors for the PRF and BRF h „ N p0, vh Σ h q and g|h „ N pΩh, vg Σ g q,
with Σ h “ Σ g “ p∆tq4 pD2t D2 q´1 . D2 is the truncated second order finite difference matrix of size pF ´ 1q ˆ pF ´ 1q that introduces temporal smoothness, as
in [6,7], and vh and vg are scalars that we set manually. As seen in Fig. 4[Middle], this approach does not yield satisfying results, not only for the perfusion
component, but also for the BOLD one, compared to the model presented in
[6,7].
We therefore propose to exploit the described physiological link in a two-step
procedure, in which we first identify hemodynamics properties (ĥ, âm
j ), and then
use the linear operator Ω and the previously estimated hemodynamic properties to recover the perfusion component (ĝ, ĉm
j ). This way, we avoid an arising
contaminating effect of g on the estimation of h, as in the one-step approach in
Fig. 4[Middle]. Each step is based on a Gibbs sampling procedure as in [6,7].

4.1

Hemodynamics estimation step M1

In a first step M1 , our goal is to extract the hemodynamic components and the
drift term from the ASL data. In the JDE framework (7), it amounts to initially
considering the perfusion component as a generalized perfusion term, including
perfusion baseline and event-related perfusion response. The generative model
(7) for ASL time series can be equivalently written, by grouping the perfusion
terms involving W “ diagpwq, as

BRF h and the drift term `j can be estimated first, by segregating them from a

considered in the residuals, so as to properly estimate its different contributions

The significance of the 2-step approach is to first preprocess the data to
subtract the hemodynamic component within the ASL signal, as well as the
drift effect, and to focus in a second step on the analysis of the smaller perfusion
effect. In [4], differencing methods were used to subtract components with no
interest in the perfusion analysis and directly analyse the perfusion effect in the
time series. In contrast to these methods, we expect to disentangle perfusion from
BOLD components by identifying all the components contained in the signal,
and to recover them more accurately.

Simulation results

The generative model for ASL time series in section 3 has been used to generate artificial ASL data. A low SNR has been considered, with T R “ 1 s,
mean ISI “ 5.03 s, duration 25 s, N “ 325 scans and two experimental conditions (M “ 2) represented with 20 ˆ 20-voxel binary activation label maps
corresponding to BRL and PRL maps shown in Fig. 3. For both conditions:

j |qj “ 1q „ N p2.2, 0.3q and pcj |qj “ 1q „ N p0.48, 0.1q. Parameters were chosen to simulate a typical low SNR ASL scenario, in which the perfusion component is much lower than the hemodynamics component. A drift `j „ N p0, 10I4 q
and noise variance vb “ 7 were considered. BRF and PRF shapes were simulated
with the physiological model, using the physiological parameters used in [8].
In a low SNR context, the PRF estimate retrieved by the former approach
developed in [6,7] is not physilogically relevant as shown in Fig. 4[(c), Top]. In
the case of a physiologically informed Bayesian approach, considering a singlestep solution as in Fig. 4[Middle], the perfusion component estimation is worse

owing to the influence of the noisier perfusion component during the sampling.
In contrast, the 2-steps method proposed here delivers a PRF estimate very close
to the simulated ground truth (see Fig. 4[(c), Bottom] with a BRF which is well
estimated too.
In Fig. 5, the robustness of both approaches with respect to the noise variance
is studied, in terms of BRF and PRF recovery. The relative root-mean-squareerror (rRMSE) is computed for the PRF and BRF estimates, i.e. rRMSEφ “

performance in the BRF estimation, we achieved a much better recovery of the

of the physiological link between BRF and PRF, we have improved the PRF
estimation.

Real data results

Real ASL data were recorded during an experiment designed to map auditory
and visual brain functions, which consisted of N “ 291 scans lasting T R “ 3 s,

with T E “ 18 ms, FoV 192 mm, each yielding a 3-D volume composed of
64 ˆ 64 ˆ 22 voxels (resolution of 3 ˆ 3 ˆ 3.5 mm3 ). The tagging scheme used
was PICORE Q2T, with T I1 “ 700 ms, T I2 “ 1700 ms. The paradigm was
a fast event-related design (mean ISI “ 5.1 s) comprising sixty auditory and
visual stimuli. Two regions of interest in the right temporal lobe, for the auditory
cortex, and left occipital lobe, for the visual cortex, were defined manually.
Fig. 6(b-c) depicts the response estimates superimposed to the canonical
shape which is in accordance with the BRF estimates for both methods. Indeed,
we consider here an auditory region where the canonical version has been fitted. Accordingly, the BRL maps (Fig. 6(a)) also look alike for both methods.
However, PRF estimates significantly differ and the effect of the physiologicallyinspired regularization yields a more plausible PRF shape for the 2-steps approach compared with the non-physiological JDE version. Results on PRL maps
(Fig. 6(d)) confirm the improved sensitivity of detection for the proposed approach. In the same way, in the visual cortex, Fig. 6(f-g) shows the BRF and
PRF estimates, giving a more plausible PRF shape for the 2-steps approach, too.
For the detection results (Fig. 6(h)), the 2-steps approach seems also to provide
a much better sensitivity of detection.

Discussion and conclusion

Starting from non-linear systems of differential equations induced by physiological models of the neuro-vascular coupling, we derived a tractable linear operator linking the perfusion and BOLD responses. This operator showed good
approximation performance and demonstrated its ability to capture both realistic perfusion and BOLD components. In addition, this derived linear operator
was easily incorporated in a JDE framework at no additional cost and with a
significant improvement in PRF estimation, especially in critical low SNR situations. As shown on simulated data, the PRF estimation has been improved
while maintaining accurate BRF estimation. Real data results seem to confirm

the better performance of the proposed physiological approach compared to its
competing alternative. In terms of validation, future work will be devoted to
intensive validation on whole brain analysis and multiple subjects.
