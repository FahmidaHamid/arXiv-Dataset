Microarray analysis to monitor expression activities in thousands
of genes simultaneously has become routine in biomedical research
during the past decade. A tremendous amount of expression profiles
are generated and stored in the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes
has become popular to obtain increased statistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed p-value evidence
have been widely used in genomic settings, among which Fisher’s and
Stouffer’s methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw data
and p-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies
that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a certain p-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with p-value < 0.001)
are reported in journal publications. The truncated p-value information makes the aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to apply a less efficient vote counting
method or naı̈vely drop the studies with incomplete information. The
purpose of this paper is to develop effective meta-analysis methods
for such situations with partially censored p-values. We developed
and compared three imputation methods—mean imputation, single
random imputation and multiple imputation—for a general class of
evidence aggregation methods of which Fisher’s and Stouffer’s methods are special examples. The null distribution of each method was
analytically derived and subsequent inference and genomic analysis
frameworks were established. Simulations were performed to investigate the type I error, power and the control of false discovery rate
(FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data. The proposed methods
were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal cancer, pain

The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing
naı̈ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed the best and are recommended for future applications.

1. Introduction and motivation. Microarray analysis to monitor expression activities in thousands of genes simultaneously has become routine
in biomedical research during the past decade. The rapid development in
biological high-throughput technology results in a tremendous amount of
experimental data and many data sets are available from public domains
such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress. Since most
microarray studies have relatively small sample sizes and limited statistical power, integrating information from multiple transcriptomic studies using meta-analysis techniques is becoming popular. Microarray meta-analysis
usually refers to combining multiple transcriptomic studies for detecting
differentially expressed (DE) genes (or candidate markers). DE gene analysis identifies genes differentially expressed across two or more conditions
(e.g., cases and controls) with statistical significance and/or biological significance (e.g., fold change). Microarray meta-analysis in many situations
refers to performing traditional meta-analysis techniques on each gene repeatedly and then controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) to adjust pvalues for multiple comparison [Borovecki et al. (2005); Cardoso et al. (2007);
Pirooznia, Nagarajan and Deng (2007); Segal et al. (2004)]. Fisher’s method
[Fisher (1925)] was the first meta-analysis technique introduced in microarray data analysis in 2002 [Rhodes et al. (2002)], followed by Tippett’s minimum p-value method in 2003 [Moreau et al. (2003)]. Subsequently, many
meta-analysis approaches have been used in this field, including extensions
of existing meta-analysis techniques and novel methods to encompass the
challenges presented in the genomic setting [Choi et al. (2003), Choi et al.
(2007), Moerau et al. (2003), Owen (2009), Li and Tseng (2011), and see a
review paper by Tseng, Ghosh and Feingold (2012)].
To combine findings from multiple research studies, one needs to know
either the effect size or the p-value for each study. Since the differences
in data structures and statistical hypotheses across multiple studies may
make the direct combination of effect sizes impossible or the result suspicious, combining p-values from multiple studies is often more appealing.
Popular p-value combination methods [see review and comparative papers
Tseng, Ghosh and Feingold (2012) and Chang et al. (2013)] can be split into
two major categories of evidence aggregation methods (including Fisher’s,
Stouffer’s and logit methods) and order statistic methods [such as minimum p-value, maximum p-value and rth ordered p-value by Song and
Tseng (2014)]. Evidence aggregation methods utilize summation of certain
transformations of p-values as their test statistics to aggregate differential

expression evidence across studies. Among evidence aggregation methods,
Fisher’s method is the
most well known, in which the test statistic is dePK
Fisher
fined as T
= −2 k=1 log(pk ), where K is the number of independent
studies that are to be combined and pk is the p-value of individual study
k, 1 ≤ k ≤ K. Under the null hypothesis of no effect size in all studies and
assuming that studies are independent and models for assessing p-values
are correctly specified, T Fisher follows a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom 2K. Fisher’s method has been popular due to its simplicity and some theoretical properties, including admissibility under Gaussian
assumption [Birnbaum (1954, 1955)] and asymptotically Bahadur optimality (ABO) under equal nonzero effect sizes across studies [Littel and Folk
(1971, 1973)]. Some variations of Fisher’s methods were proposed by using unequal weights or a trimmed version of Fisher’s test statistic [Olkin
and Saner (2001)]. Another widely used evidence aggregation method is the
Stouffer’s method [Stouffer (1949)], in which the test statistic is defined as
P
−1
−1
T Stouffer = K
k=1 Φ (pk ), where Φ (·) is the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of standard normal distribution.
In order to combine p-values, all p-values across studies should be known.
In genomic applications, however, raw data and thus p-values are often not
available and usually only a list of statistically significant DE genes (p-value
less than a threshold) is provided in the publication [Griffith, Jones and
Wiseman (2006)]. Although many journals and funding agencies have encouraged or enforced data sharing policies, the situation has only improved
moderately. Many researchers are still concerned about data ownership, and
researchers whose studies are sponsored by private funding are not obligated
to share data in the public domain. For example, in Chan et al. (2008),
publications of 23 colorectal cancer versus normal gene expression profiling
studies were collected to perform meta-analysis to identify consistently reported candidate disease-associated genes. However, only one raw data set
is available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/, GSE3294) and most other papers only provided a list of
DE genes (and their p-values) under a prespecified p-value threshold. A second motivating example comes from a microarray meta-analysis study for
pain research [LaCroix-Fralish et al. (2011)], in which 19 microarray studies
of pain models were collected to detect the gene signature and patterns of
pain conditions. Among the 19 studies, only one raw data set was available
on the author’s website and all the other papers reported the DE gene lists
under different thresholds.
In these two motivating examples (details to be shown in Sections 4.1 and
4.2), the incomplete data forced researchers to either drop studies with incomplete p-values or apply the convenient vote counting method [Hedges and
Olkin (1980)]. Dropping studies with incomplete information greatly reduces

4

S. TANG ET AL.

the statistical power and is obviously not applicable in the two motivating
examples since the complete data was available in only one study. The conventional vote counting procedure is well known as flawed and low-powered
[McCarley et al. (2001)]. Ioannidis et al. (2009) attempted to reproduce 18
microarray studies published in Nature Genetics during 2005–2006. Interestingly, only two were “in principle” replicated, six “partially” replicated
and ten could not be reproduced. This result illustrates well the widespread
difficulty of obtaining raw data or reproducing published results in the field.
Therefore, developing methods to efficiently combine studies with truncated
p-value information is an important problem in microarray meta-analysis.
In this paper, we assume that K = K1 + K2 studies are combined. In K1
studies, the raw gene expression data matrix and sample annotations are
available and the complete p-values pgi (1 ≤ g ≤ G for genes and 1 ≤ i ≤ K1 )
can be reproduced for meta-analysis. For the remaining K2 studies, either
the raw data or annotation is not available. Only incomplete information of
a DE gene list (under p-value threshold αi for study i) is provided in the
journal publication. In this situation, the available information is an indicator function 1{pgi <αi } to represent whether the p-value of gene g in study i
is smaller than αi or not. We outline the paper structure as the following.
In Section 2 a general class of evidence aggregation meta-analysis methods
under a univariate scenario was investigated for the mean imputation, the
single random imputation and the multiple imputation methods, respectively, in which the exact or approximate null distributions were derived
under the null hypotheses and the results are shown for the Fisher and the
Stouffer methods. In Section 3.1 simulations of the expression profile were
performed to compare performance of different methods. Simulations were
further performed in Section 3.2 using 8 major depressive disorder (MDD)
and 7 prostate cancer studies where raw data were completely available and
the true best performance (complete case) could be obtained. In Section 4
the proposed methods were applied to the two motivating examples. In Section 4.1 the methods were applied to 7 colorectal cancer studies, where the
raw data were available only in 3 studies. In Section 4.2 the proposed methods were applied to 11 microarray studies of pain conditions, where no raw
data were available. In Section 4.3 we developed an unconventional application of the proposed methods to facilitate the large computational and
data storage needs in a liquid association meta-analysis. Discussions and
conclusions are included in Section 5 and all proofs are left in the Appendix.
2. Methods and inferences.
2.1. Evidence aggregation meta-analysis methods. Here we consider a
general class of univariate evidence aggregation meta-analysis methods (for
gene g fixed), in which the test statistics are defined as the sum of selected

transformations of p-values for each individual study. Without loss of generality, assuming that FX (·) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of a continuous random variable X, the test statistic T is defined as
(2.1)

T=

K
X
i=1

Tk :=

K
X

FX−1 (pk ),

k=1

where pk is the p-value from the kth study. Theoretically, X can be any
continuous random variable. However, in practice, X is usually selected such
that the test statistic T follows a simple distribution. For instance, when
X ∼ χ22 , it holds T ∼ χ22K (Fisher’s method) and T ∼ N(0, K) holds, provided
X ∼ N(0, 1) (Souffer’s method).
The hypothesis that corresponds to testing the homogeneous effect sizes
of K studies by evidence aggregation methods is a union-intersection test
(UIT) [Roy (1953)]:

In this paper, we focus on two popular special cases:
1. Fisher’s method [Fisher (1925)]: When X ∼ χ22 , Tk = FX−1 (pk ) =
−2 log(pk ).
2. Stouffer’s method [Stouffer (1949)]: When X ∼ N(0, 1), Tk = FX−1 (pk ) =
−1
Φ (pk ).
Another example is the logit method [Hedges and Olkin (1985)], where
pk
Tk = − log( 1−p
). But since this method is rarely used in practice, we will not

examine it further in this paper. To apply the evidence aggregation metaanalysis methods mentioned above, all the p-values should be observed. However, in genomic applications, it often happens that p-values of some studies
are truncated and only their ranges are reported. Two naı̈ve methods are
commonly used to overcome this situation: the vote counting method or the
available-case method which only combines studies with observed p-values.
The available-case method discards rich information contained in the studies with truncated p-values and, therefore, the statistical power is reduced.
Hedges and Olkin (1980) showed that the power of vote counting converges
to 0 when many studies of moderate effect sizes are combined and, therefore, the vote counting method should be avoided whenever possible. In this
section, three imputation methods—mean imputation, single random imputation and multiple imputation method—are proposed and investigated to
combine studies with truncated p-values and the corresponding null distributions are derived analytically, respectively. We first define some notation.
Assume that K independent studies are to be combined and p1 , . . . , pK are
the corresponding p-values. Without loss of generality, assume that all the

6

S. TANG ET AL.

p-values are available in the first K1 studies and only the indicator function
of DE evidence is reported in the other K2 studies.
Define a pair (ci , xi ), i = 1, . . . , K for each study, in which ci is the “censoring” indicator satisfying

0,
if pi is observed (i.e., 1 ≤ i ≤ K1 ),
ci :=
(2.3)
1,
if pi is censored (i.e., K1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ K),
and xi is the final observed values which is defined as

pi ,
if ci = 0,
(2.4)
xi :=
1{pi <αi } ,
if ci = 1,

where αi is the p-value threshold for study i (K1 + 1 ≤ i ≤ K1 + K2 = K).
For each i = 1, 2, . . . , K, one can impute the missing value by p̃i :
p̃i = pi · 1{ci =0} + [qi · 1{xi =1} + ri · 1{xi =0} ] · 1{ci =1}

with qi ∈ (0, αi ), and ri ∈ [αi , 1). Sections 2.2–2.4 develop three imputation
methods for selection of qi and ri .
2.2. Mean imputation method. The simplest imputation method is the
i
mean imputation method, in which qi = α2i and ri = 1+α
2 . Then the test
statistic T̃ for truncated data satisfies

The results can be summarized into the following theorem (proof left to

Note that there are 2K2 terms summation in the right-hand side of equation (2.8), which may cause severe computing problem when K2 is large.

Therefore, the summation is reduced from 2K2 terms to rl=1 (nl + 1) terms.
From the above theorem one concludes that T̃ is a biased estimator of the
original T . This motivates the following two stochastic imputation methods.
2.3. Single random imputation method. It is well known that the mean
2
imputation method will underestimate the variance of {pK1 +j }K
j=1 [Little
and Rubin (2002)]. Furthermore, Theorem 1 indicates that the test statistic
T̃ from the mean imputation method is a biased estimator of the original T .
To avoid this problem, one can replace the mean by randomly simulating qi
and ri from Uniform(0, αi ) and Uniform(αi , 1), respectively.
Recall that for j = 1, . . . , K2 , Bj = FX−1 (p̃K1 +j ). The next theorem (proof
left to Appendix B.2) states that Bj ∼ X holds under the null hypothesis,
that is, Bj and X follow the same distribution.
Theorem 2.
(2.11)

For j = 1, 2, . . . , K2 , it holds
Bj ∼ X.

The following corollary is a simple consequence of the above theorem.
Corollary. For the single random imputation method, the following
facts hold for T̃ :
1. For Fisher’s method, it holds Bj ∼ χ22 and therefore T̃ ∼ χ22K .
2. For Stouffer method, it holds Bj ∼ N(0, 1) and therefore T̃ ∼ N(0, K).
Therefore, in this case, T̃ is an unbiased estimator of T defined in equation (2.1).
2.4. Multiple imputation method. Although the single random imputation method allows the use of standard complete-data meta-analysis methods, it cannot reflect the sampling variability from one random sample. The

9

multiple imputation method (MI) overcomes this disadvantage [Little and
Rubin (2002)]. In MI, each missing value is imputed D times. Therefore,
{T̃ l }D
l=1 is a sequence of test statistics which are defined as

3. Simulation results.
3.1. Simulated expression profiles. To evaluate performance of the proposed imputation methods in the genomic setting, we simulated expression
profiles with correlated gene structure and variable effect sizes as follows:
Simulate gene correlation structure for G = 10,000 genes, N = 100 samples in each study and K = 10 studies. In each study, 4000 of the 10,000
genes belong to C = 200 independent clusters.
Step 1. Randomly sample gene cluster labels of 10,000 genes (Cg ∈ {0, 1,
2, . . . , C} and 1 ≤ g P
≤ G), such that C = 200 clusters each containing 20
genes are generated [ g 1(Cg = c) = 20, ∀1 ≤ c ≤ C = 200] and the remaining
P
6000 genes are unclustered genes [ g 1(Cg = 0) = 6000].
Step 2. For any cluster c(1 ≤ c ≤ C) in study k(1 ≤ k ≤ K), sample Σ′ck ∼
−1
W (Ψ, 60), where Ψ = 0.5I20×20 + 0.5J20×20 , W −1 denotes the inverse
Wishart distribution, I is the identity matrix and J is the matrix with
all the entries being 1. Set vector σck as the square roots of the diagonal
T = Σ′ .
elements in Σ′ck . Calculate Σck such that σck Σck σck

Step 3. Denote g1 , . . . , g20 as the indices for genes in cluster c. In other
words, Cg(c) = c, where 1 ≤ c ≤ 200 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 20. Sample the expression

Simulate differential expression pattern.

Step 4. Sample effect sizes µgk from Unif(0.1, 0.5) for 1 ≤ g ≤ 1000 as DE
genes and set µgk = 0 for 1001 ≤ g ≤ G as non-DE genes.

Step 5. For the first 50 control samples, Xgnk = Xgnk
(1 ≤ g ≤ G, 1 ≤ n ≤

N/2 = 50, 1 ≤ k ≤ K). For cases, Ygnk = Xg(n+50)k + µgk (1 ≤ g ≤ G, 1 ≤ n ≤
N/2 = 50, 1 ≤ k ≤ K).
In the simulated data sets, K = 10 studies with G = 10,000 genes simulated.
Within each study, there were N2 = 50 cases and 50 controls. The first 1000
genes were DE in all 10 studies with effect sizes randomly simulated from
a uniform distribution on (0.1, 0.5), respectively, and the remaining 9000
were non-DE genes. We chose this effect size range to produce an averaged
√ = 0.1414 so that the DE analysis generates
standardized effect size at 1·0.3
50
∼500–600 candidate DE genes (Table 1), a commonly seen range in real
applications. In each study, 200 gene clusters existed, each containing 20
genes. The correlation structure within each cluster was simulated from an
inverse Wishart distribution.
In the simulations, we performed a two sample t-test for each gene in
each study and then combined the p-values using the imputation methods
proposed in this paper. For simplicity, we viewed the p-values from the last 5
studies as truncated with thresholds (α1 , . . . , α5 ) = (0.001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.01,
0.05), respectively. In most genomic meta-analysis, researchers often use
conventional permutation analysis by permuting sample labels to compute
the p-values to preserve gene correlation structure. However, such a nonparametric approach is not applicable in our situation, since raw data are
not available in some studies. In order to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), we examined the Benjamini–Hochberg (B–H) method [Benjamini
and Hochberg (1995)] and the Benjamini–Yekutieli (B–Y) method [Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)] separately. The number of DE genes detected
at nominal FDR rate 5% were recorded and the true FDR rates were computed for each meta-analysis method by

of DE genes controlled by B–H and B–Y methods and their true FDR are
reported in Table 1. The results showed that the FDRs were controlled
well for B–H correction but rather conservative for B–Y correction (the
true FDR of B–Y is only 1/10 of B–H at nominal FDR = 5%). This is
consistent with the previous observation that the B–Y adjustment tends to
be over-conservative since it guards against any type of correlation structure
[Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)]. As a result, the B–H correction will be used
for all applications hereafter. The simulation results showed consistently
that imputation methods had higher statistical power than the availablecase method, and the mean imputation and multiple imputation methods
outperform the single random imputation method with similar performance.
Surprisingly, the ratio of detected DE genes compared to the complete case
increased from 41.6% in the available case (263.5/632.9) to 80.4% in mean
imputation (508.6/632.9) using Fisher’s method. The improvement is even
more significant using Stouffer’s method (from 41.8% to 86.7%), while at the
same time the true FDRs were controlled at a similar level for all methods.
The result shows that imputation methods successfully utilize the incomplete
p-value information to greatly recover the detection power.
We further examined the situation when gene dependence structure does
′
not exist [i.e., steps 1–3 were skipped and Xgnk
∼ N(0, 1)]. Table 2 shows the
true type I error control under nominal significance level 5% (i.e., true type

I error = g=1001
). The result shows

adequate type I error control and confirms the validity of the closed form or
approximated formula of different imputation methods in Section 2.
To investigate the impact of D on the performance of the multiple imputation method, simulations were performed for D ∈ {20, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200,

robust for different number of imputation D. We use D = 50 throughout
this paper.
3.2. Simulation from complete real data sets. In this subsection the proposed methods were applied to two real microarray data sets, including 7
prostate cancer studies [Gorlov et al. (2009)] and 8 major depressive disorder
(MDD) studies [Wang et al. (2012)]. The details are summarized in Supplement Table 1 [Tang et al. (2014)]. For each data set, about half of the studies
(four for MDD and three for prostate cancer) were randomly selected with
p-value truncation threshold 0.05. Five methods including complete data,
available-case, single random imputation, mean imputation and multiple
imputation methods were applied to the data sets with the simulated incomplete data to impute by Stouffer’s and Fisher’s methods, respectively.
The generated p-values were corrected by the B–H method and the simulation was repeated for 50 times. Figure 1 shows boxplots of the numbers of
differentially expressed (DE) genes at FDR = 1% for different methods in
MDD and FDR = 0.5% for prostate cancer data. Figure 1 indicates similar
conclusions that the multiple imputation and the mean imputation methods
detect more DE genes than the available-case method and single random imputation method. In the MDD example, very few DE genes (average of 16
and 83 for Fisher and Stouffer, resp.) were detected using the available-case
method if half of the studies have truncated p-values. The mean and multiple imputation methods greatly improved the detection sensitivity. About
95.2% (Fisher) and 96.3% (Stouffer) of DE genes detected by the mean
imputation method overlapped with DE genes detected by complete data
analysis in MDD and about 94.7% (Fisher) and 88.1% (Stouffer) of DE
genes detected by the mean imputation method overlapped with DE genes
detected by complete data analysis in prostate cancer, showing the ability
of imputation methods to recover DE gene detection power.

4. Applications.
4.1. Application to colorectal cancer. In the first motivating example,
we followed Chan et al. (2008) and attempted to collect 23 colorectal cancer
versus normal gene expression profiling studies. Raw data were available in
only one study [Bianchini et al. (2006)] and 4 of the other 22 studies containing more than 100 DE genes at different p-value thresholds were included in
our analysis. We searched the GEO database and identified two additional
new studies [Jiang et al. (2008) and Bellot et al. (2012)]. The seven studies
under analysis were summarized in Table 3. After gene-matching, 6361 genes
overlapped in all three studies with raw data. The available-case method,
the mean imputation method, the single random imputation method and
the multiple imputation method were applied for the seven studies for the
Fisher and Stouffer methods, respectively, and the results were reported in
Table 4. For the single random imputation method and the multiple imputation method, the analyses were repeated 50 times and the mean and

standard error of the number of DE genes detected were reported under
FDR control by the B–H method. The results demonstrate that for various
FDR thresholds, the mean imputation method and the multiple imputation
method detected more DE genes than the available-case method and the
single random imputation method, which was consistent with previous findings in simulations. Under FDR = 0.01% control, the Fisher and Stouffer
mean imputation detected 2.07 (1183/571) and 10.35 (383/37) times of DE
genes than those by the available-case method, respectively.
4.2. Application to pain research. The second motivating example comes
from the meta-analysis of 20 microarray studies of pain to detect the patterns
of pain [LaCroix-Fralish et al. (2011)]. The original meta-analysis utilized
DE gene lists from each study under different threshold criteria from p-value,
FDR or fold change and identified 79 “statistically significant” genes that
appeared in the DE gene lists of four or more studies. The vote counting
method essentially lost a tremendous amount of information with flawed
statistical inference. When we attempted to repeat the meta-analysis, raw
data of only one of the 20 studies (Barr 2005) could be found. The old platform used in that study, however, contained only 792 genes and had to be

excluded from further meta-analysis. In the remaining 19 studies, 11 studies
contained DE gene lists under various p-value thresholds (marked bold in
Supplement Table 2 [Tang et al. (2014)]) and were included in our application. In other words, this example contained exclusively only studies with
truncated p-values. Table 5 shows the results of three imputation methods.
Fisher and Stouffer identified 280 and 45 genes under 5% FDR control, respectively. Note that the original meta-analysis tested the 79 genes using
an overall binomial test and the statistical significance was controlled at an
overall p-value level, not at a gene-specific FDR level. As a result, DE gene
lists from the new imputation methods are theoretically more powerful and
accurate.
To validate the finding, we used the Gene Functional Annotation tool
from the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources website (http://david.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov). DAVID applied a modified Fisher’s exact test to evaluate the
association between the DE gene lists and pathways. Functional annotation
of the 280 DE genes from the Fisher’s mean imputation method identified
208 pathways at FDR = 5%, among which selected important pain-related
pathways were grouped into five major biological categories and displayed in
Table 6. In contrast, the 79 genes from vote counting identified only 14 pathways, of which the expected pain-related pathways under the categories of
inflammation and of differentiation, development and projection are missing
(see Table 6). The pathway enrichment q-values after multiple comparison
control of the “280 gene list” were very significant, while those of the “79
gene list” were not. Since the p-value calculation from Fisher’s exact test
can be impacted by the DE gene size, we further compared the enrichment
odd-ratios of genes in the pathway versus in the DE gene list. Still the enrichment odds-ratios of the “280 gene list” were generally much higher than
those for the “79 gene list,” showing stronger pain functional association
from the Fisher’s mean imputation method.
4.3. Application to a three-way association method (liquid association).
So far the proposed imputation methods were applied successfully to two
real microarray data sets of colorectal cancer and pain research in which the
actual p-values of some genes were not reported in a subset of studies. In

this section we show that the proposed imputation methods can be useful
in the meta-analysis of “big data” such as GWAS or eQTL, where the main
computational problem is often the data storage.
In the literature it has long been argued that positively correlated expression profiles are likely to encode functionally related proteins. Liquid
association (LA) analysis [Li (2002)] is an advanced three-way co-expression
analysis beyond the traditional pairwise correlations. For any triplet of genes
X, Y and Z, the LA score LA(X, Y |Z) measures the effect that expression
of Z to control on and off of the co-expression between X and Y . For example, high expression of Z turns on positive correlation between X and
Y , while when expression of Z is low, X and Y are negatively or noncorrelated. Theory in Li (2002) simplified calculation of the LA score to a linear
order of sample size and made the genome-wide computation barely feasible.
Supposing we want to combine K studies of the liquid association, liquid
association p-values of all triplets in all K = 10 studies have to be stored for
meta-analysis. When the number of genes G = 1000, the number of p-values
to be stored is G·C2G−1 ·K = 4.985 GB. For a reasonable G = 20,000 genomewide analysis, storage size for all p-values quickly increases to 39.994 TB.
One may argue that univariate (i.e., triplet by triplet) meta-analysis may be
applied repeatedly to avoid the need of storing all p-value results. There are
many other genomic meta-analysis situations when this may not be feasible.
For example, in GWAS meta-analysis under a consortium collaboration, raw
genotyping data cannot be shared for privacy reasons and only the derived
statistics or p-values can be transferred for meta-analysis. Below we describe
how imputation methods can help circumvent the tremendous data storage
problem.
We performed a small scale of analysis on 566 DE genes previously reported from the meta-analysis of the eight MDD studies used in Section 3.2
[Wang et al. (2012)]. The total number of possible triplets (X, Y |Z) was
90,180,780. By setting up a p-value threshold at 0.001, we only needed to
store exact p-values for 2,094,123 (∼2.32%) triplets and the remaining were
truncated as considered in this paper. Since we also needed to store the truncation index information, we only needed to store 2 × 2.32% = 4.64% of the
information and the compression ratio was 95.36%. To investigate the loss
of information by the truncation, Figure 2 shows meta-analysis p-values [at
− log(p) scale] from Fisher’s method using full data and the Fisher mean imputation method using truncated data. The result shows high concordance in
the top significant triplets, which are the major targets of this exploratory
analysis. Among the top 1000 triplets detected by Fisher’s method using
complete p-value information, 83.7% of them were also identified by the top
1000 by Fisher mean imputation. The remaining 163 triplets were still in
top ranks (rank between 1199 and 4763) using truncated data in the result of Fisher mean imputation. This result suggests a good potential of

applying data truncation to preserve the most informative information and
performing imputation to approximate the finding of the top targets when
meta-analysis of “big data” is needed. The compression ratio may further
increase by a more stringent truncation threshold, but the performance may
somewhat decline as a trade-off.
5. Discussion and conclusion. When combining multiple genomic studies by p-value combination methods, the raw data are often not available
and only the ranges of p-values are reported for some studies in genomic applications. This is especially true for microarray meta-analysis since owners
of many microarray studies tend not to publish their data in the public domain. This incomplete data issue is often encountered when one attempts to
perform a large-scale microarray meta-analysis. If raw data are not available,
two naı̈ve methods—vote counting method and available-case method—are
commonly used. Since these two methods completely or largely neglect the
information contained in the truncated p-values, their statistical power is
generally low. In this paper, we proposed three imputation methods for a
general class of evidence aggregation meta-analysis methods to combine independent studies with truncated p-values: mean imputation, single random

imputation and multiple imputation methods. For each proposed imputation method, the null distribution was derived analytically for the Fisher and
Stouffer methods. Theoretical results showed that the test statistics from
the single random imputation and the multiple imputation methods were
unbiased, while those for mean imputation methods were biased. Simulations were performed for the imputed Fisher method and imputed Stouffer
method. The simulation results showed that type I errors were well controlled for all methods, which was consistent with our theoretical derivation.
Compared to the naive available-case method, all the imputation methods
achieved higher statistical powers, and the mean imputation and the multiple imputation methods recovered much of the power that the complete
cases method achieved even when half of the studies had truncated p-values.
Furthermore, Figure 3 in Appendix A showed that the power of the multiple
imputation method was robust to the number of imputation D. Although
small to moderate D provided good results, we recommend choosing D being larger than 50 to guarantee that the central limit theorem can approximate well. Applications to two motivating examples in colorectal cancer and
pain conditions showed that both mean imputation and multiple imputation
performed among the best in terms of detection sensitivity and biological
validation by pathway analysis.
In regression-type missing-data imputation methods, the null distribution
of the error term is unknown and is assumed to be normally distributed with
equal variance, a setting in which the multiple imputation method usually
outperforms the mean imputation in practice and in theory [Little and Rubin (2002)], particularly because mean imputation underestimates the true
variance. However, our simulation results demonstrated that the power of
the two methods were quite similar. Two reasons may contribute to this
result. First, although the test statistic from the mean imputation method
is biased and neglects the variation of truncated p-values, its p-value can
be computed accurately when the null distribution is derived analytically.
Second and more importantly, we find that the test statistic of mean imputation is in fact FX−1 (E(p)), while for sufficiently large D, the test statistic
of multiple imputation converges to E(FX−1 (p)) in distribution. It is easy to
show that these two quantities are very close to each other for a small range
of p, provided FX−1 (·) is smooth. Since FX−1 (·) is infinitely differentiable for
the Fisher and Stouffer methods, and the small p-value range in (0, α) is
particularly of interest to us, it is not surprising that the mean imputation method and multiple imputation method perform similarly. Since the
mean imputation method achieved almost the same power as the multiple
imputation method with less computational complexity, it is more appealing and is recommended for microarray meta-analysis, where the imputed
meta-analysis method is performed repeatedly for thousands of genes. In this

IMPUTATION IN MICROARRAY META-ANALYSIS

21

paper only the evidence aggregation meta-analysis methods are investigated
and further work will be needed to extend these results to order statistic
based methods such as minP and maxP.
Note that although the truncated p-value issue discussed in this paper
may appear similar to the problem of “publication bias,” it is fundamentally different. Publication bias refers to the fact that a study with a large
positive treatment effect is more likely to be published than a study with a
relatively small treatment effect, resulting in bias if one only considers published studies. Denote by p1 , p2 , . . . , pN the p-values of all conducted studies
that should have been collected. Only a subset of likely more significant
p-values p1 , p2 , . . . , pn are observed. Under this setting, N is unknown and
pn+1 , . . . , pN are unknown as well. Since the number of missing publications is unknown, Duval and Tweedie proposed the “Trim and Fill” method
to identify and correct for funnel plot asymmetry arising from publication
bias [Duval and Tweedie (2000a) and (2000b)], in which an estimate of the
number of missing studies is provided and an adjusted treatment effect is
estimated by performing a meta-analysis including the imputed studies. For
the truncated p-value problem we consider here, the total number of studies,
the number of studies with truncated p-values and the p-value truncation
thresholds are all known. Therefore, investigation of the imputation of truncated p-values in meta-analysis is different from the traditional “publication
bias” problem and has not been studied in the meta-analysis literature, to
the best of our knowledge.
In this paper the methods we developed mainly target on microarray
meta-analysis, but the issue can happen frequently in other types of genomic
meta-analysis [e.g., GWAS; Begurn et al. (2012)]. In Section 4.3 we demonstrated an unconventional application of our methods to meta-analysis of
liquid association. Due to the large number of triplets tested in the threeway association, the needed p-value storage is huge. By preserving only the
most informative data by truncation, the storage burden is greatly alleviated and our imputation methods help approximate and recover the top
meta-analysis targets with little power loss. In an ongoing project, we also
attempt to combine multiple genome-wide eQTL results via meta-analysis.
In eQTL, regression analysis is used to investigate the association of a SNP
genotyping and a gene expression. It is impractical to store all genome-wide
eQTL p-values, as the storage space required is too large (25,000 genes ×
2,000,000 SNPS = 5 × 1010 p-values). A practical solution is to record only
the eQTL p-values smaller than a threshold (say, 10−4 ) for meta-analysis,
which leads to the same statistical setting as discussed in this paper. In
another project we combine results from multiple ChIP-seq peak calling algorithms to develop a meta-caller. Since each peak caller algorithm can only
report the top peaks with p-values smaller than a certain p-value threshold,

22

we again encounter the same truncated p-value problem in meta-analysis.
As more and more complex genomic data are generated and the need for
meta-analysis increases, we expect the imputation methods we propose in
this paper will find even more applications in the future.
