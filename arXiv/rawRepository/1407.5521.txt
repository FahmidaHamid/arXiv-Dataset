When a population is engaged in successive prisoner’s dilemmas, indirect reciprocity through reputation fosters cooperation through the emergence of moral and action rules. A simplified model has
recently been proposed where individuals choose between helping or not others, and are judged good
or bad for it by the rest of the population. The reputation so acquired will condition future actions.
In this model, eight strategies (referred to as ‘leading eight’) enforce a high level of cooperation,
generate high payoffs and are therefore resistant to invasions by other strategies. Here we show
that, by assigning each individual one out of two labels that peers can distinguish (e.g., political
ideas, religion, skin colour...) and allowing moral and action rules to depend on the label, intolerant
behaviours can emerge within minorities under sufficient economic stress. We analyse the sets of
conditions where this can happen and also discuss the circumstances under which tolerance can
be restored. Our results agree with empirical observations that correlate intolerance and economic
stress, and predict a correlation between the degree of tolerance of a population and its composition
and ethical stance.

INTRODUCTION

Different kinds of discriminatory behaviour based on
membership to different groups—identified, for example, by visible tags [1]—has been reported both in human [2–5] and in animal societies [6–10]. They can
be broadly classified into two main types: in-group favoritism and out-group hostility [11–13]. Recent studies
of in-group and out-group cooperation show that in-group
favouritism can emerge in the framework of indirect reciprocity [14–16].
The concept of indirect reciprocity [17, 18] has been
introduced to explain the emergence of cooperation in society, where many interactions between the same individuals have low chances to be repeated. Contrary to direct
reciprocity [19], indirect reciprocity implies that individuals receive the consequences of their actions, not directly
from their opponents, but indirectly through society. Indirect reciprocity—and its related reputation concept—
has proven to be an important mechanism for the emergence and sustainment of cooperation in small-scale human [20–24] and non-human [25] societies. It also plays
an important role in communication networks [26, 27]. In
these reputation-based models, individuals have an opinion about every interaction they witness and assign a reputation to the individuals involved accordingly [21, 28–
31]. The nature of their future interactions with those individuals will be determined by the reputation they have
assigned to them.
In a stylised model of indirect reciprocity Ohtsuki and
Iwasa [29] and Brandt and Sigmund [30] classified the
strategies involved in these games attending to action and
assessment modules. The action module prescribes what
to do—whether cooperate or not—given the reputations
of the individuals involved. The assessment module assigns reputation to the interacting individuals according
to a moral code. To do it three elements can be judged:
the nature of the interaction, the reputation of the recipient, and the reputation of the donor. Strategies are
thus classified as first, second, or third order depending

on whether the first, the first and the second, or all the
three elements are taken into account to assign a reputation to the donor. Ohtsuki and Iwasa [29] studied the evolutionarily stability of third order strategies which share
the same moral assessment module, and later MartinezVaquero and Cuesta [32] extended the study confronting
strategies with different moral codes. Among the evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) found, there are eight
strategies—the so-called Leading Eight —that are considerably more efficient (get very high payoff) and coherent
(in terms of consistency between their moral and action
modules) than the rest of them. All these strategies foster
cooperation through indirect reciprocity.
This simple model of indirect reciprocity can be readily extended to study the emergence of discriminatory
behaviours by introducing different groups of individuals
identified by external signs (these may include physical
or cultural traits). Our goal in this work is to analyse under which conditions an intolerant strategy (understood
as out-group hostility) can invade a tolerant population
that follows one of the Leading Eight strategies. Whenever intolerance spreads, we are also interested in whether
tolerance can be restored by introducing some kind of external incentives. Our hope is that this study sheds some
light into the causes for the emergence of intolerance in
societies and the mechanisms to alleviate this social burden.
The paper is structured as follows. In section II we introduce the model, which is mathematically implemented
in section III. Our results are shown in section IV and discussed in section V.

II.

MODEL

Our model is an extension of that used in a previous
work [32]—itself a modification of the indirect reciprocity
model based on reputation introduced by Brandt and Sigmund [30] and later investigated by Ohtsuki and Iwasa
[29, 33].

2
We consider an infinite, well-mixed population, where
every individual is aware of every action performed and
produces a moral judgment—which leads to a reputation
assignment—on it. Each time step a pair of individuals is
randomly drawn—with equal probability—from the population. One of them plays as donor and the other one
as recipient. The donor can decide to pay a cost c > 0
to help (C) the recipient or not (D). Any helped recipient gains a payoff b > c; otherwise there is no payoff
whatsoever.
This action is observed by every individual in the population (including themselves). Thus everyone makes a private judgment of the donor for this action. The observer’s
moral assessment will decide the reputation—good (G)
or bad (B)—she assigns to the donor. Accordingly, everybody has a private opinion of every other individual—
even of herself.
By repeating this process the population eventually
reaches a steady state. The average payoff of this repeated game is then computed for every individual. By
assuming a very large population we effectively neglect
direct reciprocity—the probability that two individuals
meet again is very small.
Strategies are defined by two modules: the action rules,
which tells the donor how to interact with the recipient,
and the moral rules, which prescribe a reputation for the
donor of every witnessed action. As in our previous paper
[32], we will consider third order strategies.
The action rules determine what the donor must do
(either help or refuse to help) given the reputation of
both players. Specifically, aαβ = 1 (C) if a strategist
with reputation α helps an individual with reputation β
and 0 (D) otherwise.
The moral assessments tell the individual if the action
just witnessed should be judged good or bad, hence revising the donor’s reputation. Specifically, mαβ (a) = 1
(G) if the observer assigns good reputation to a donor
she previously judged α, who performs an action a on an
recipient she previously judged β, and is 0 (B) otherwise.
Thus each strategy is defined by 12 numbers: 4 for the
action module and 8 for the moral module. This amounts
to 4096 different strategies in total.
Besides, we will assume that players sometimes make
errors when trying to help another individual [29, 34–37].
Thus, with a probability ǫ a donor defects regardless of
her action rules and with 1−ǫ she performs the action she
planned to. One possible source of this error—which will
be important in interpreting the results of this work—is
scarcity of resources. Despite her willingness to help, an
individual may fail to do it because she cannot afford the
cost c. Errors due to misjudgements are excluded (see
[32] for a justification).
Discrimination requires at least two different subpopulations that can be clearly identified by everybody. Thus
we divide our population into two classes, A and B. The
fraction of A individuals will be denoted y. A tolerant
player will act disregarding the individuals’ class when
deciding her action or judgement. An intolerant individual acts and judges like a tolerant one with the following
exceptions:
1. Individuals of the other class are never helped.
2. Donors of the other class are judged bad under any
circumstance.

3. Individuals of her own class who do not help individuals of the other class are always judged good.
4. Individuals of her own class who do help individuals
of the other class are always judged bad.
III.

IMPLEMENTATION

Our goal is to determine, with the assumptions of the
model, under which conditions a small population of intolerant (tolerant) mutants M can invade a tolerant (intolerant) resident population R made of A-type and Btype individuals in fractions y and 1−y respectively. This
fraction y will be kept constant and is therefore a parameter of the model. We will only consider scenarios where all
individuals of the same class in R show the same kind of
behavior—either tolerant or intolerant—toward the other
class. Likewise, we will limit ourselves to determine when
the resident population can resist the invasion of mutants.
Determining the final composition of the population if the
invasion succeeds is a more complex problem that we will
tackle in this paper.
Without loss of generality, in the following calculations
mutants will be assumed to belong to class A. Likewise,
we will only need to consider whether A-residents imitate
the mutant or not. If a B-resident imitates the A-mutant
(its tolerant or intolerant character) this can be treated
as an invasion of B-residents by a B-mutant separately—
the reason being that mutants are present in so small a
fraction that the probability that two mutants interact is
negligible.
Accordingly the different invasion scenarios will be denoted tM |tA tB , where tX can be either T (tolerant individuals) or I (intolerant individuals), M denotes A-type
mutants, and A and B the two subpopulations. The four
possible scenarios are:
I|TT: intolerant A-mutants try to invade a tolerant population;
T|IT: tolerant A-mutants try to invade a population
made of intolerant A-residents and tolerant Bresidents;
I|TI: intolerant A-mutants try to invade a population
made of tolerant A-residents and intolerant Bresidents;
T|II: tolerant A-mutants try to invade an intolerant population.
The condition for A-residents to resist the invasion of
A-mutants is W (A|R) > W (M |R), where W (A|R) and
W (M |R) are the average payoffs received by A-type residents and by mutants, respectively. They can be obtained
as
W (A|R) = b ΘR,A − c ΘA,R ,
W (M |R) = b ΘR,M − c ΘM,R ,
ΘR,A = y θA,A + (1 − y) θB,A ,
ΘA,R = y θA,A + (1 − y) θA,B ,
ΘR,M = y θA,M + (1 − y) θB,M ,
ΘM,R = y θM,A + (1 − y) θM,B ,

(1)

where θi,j is the probability that an i-strategist helps a jstrategist. If i-strategists are intolerant and j-strategists

3
belong to a different class θi,j = 0; otherwise these probabilities can be obtained as
X
θi,j = (1 − ǫ)

αβ

where gij is the fraction of i-strategists that are considered good by the j-strategists. We have introduced the
auxiliary function
χγ (x) = γx + (1 − γ)(1 − x).

(3)

Thus if x represent the fraction of good individuals, then
χ1 (x) = x and χ0 (x) = 1 − x are the fraction of ‘good’
and ‘bad’ individuals, respectively.
In order to calculate the fractions gij we first need to

Nevertheless, for the different scenarios that we will consider, some simplifications can be made. The details are

RESULTS

We focus our analysis on the leading eight strategies introduced by Ohtsuki and Iwasa [29]. In a previous paper
[32] we proved that, for reasonable values of benefit-tocost and error rates, these eight strategies are evolutionarily stable against the invasion of any other strategy.
On the other hand, Ohtsuki and Iwasa [29] classified the
leading eight in three groups (Table IV), according to
their stability against invasions by fully defective action
rules (AllD). Neglecting errors in the moral assessment,
Groups I and II can be invaded by AllD provided
b
1
< 1 + ǫ + ǫ2 + · · · =
,
c
1−ǫ

(13)

in other words, if the error in the action ǫ > (b − c)/b.
Invading Group III requires b < c though.
Therefore, for a given b > c, if ǫ is sufficiently large, any
Group I or Group II strategy can be invaded by defectors, whereas Group III strategies always resist invasions.
As we will show below, these are the same conditions under which intolerance can spread, but intolerant strategies obtain a higher payoff than AllD because they are
indistinguishable from the strategy used by residents of
their same group. Accordingly, when two distinguishable
groups coexist in a population, intolerant strategies are
preferred over AllD.
In what follows we will consider the different invasion
scenarios for which there exists a parameter region where
invasion occurs. These regions are determined numerically, and represented in Figs. 1–8 as colored areas in a
ǫ–y plane, where y represents the fraction of A-residents
in the community. For the sake of clarity of the representations, we will sometimes assume that the invader is
of type A, and sometimes of type B. Consistent with the
previous section, we will denote tM |tA tB —tX = T,I being
the tolerant/intolerant character of type X individuals—
whenever the mutant is of type A, and tA tB |tM whenever the mutant is of type B. (Notice, however, that y
will always represent the fraction of A-residents, which
will coincide with the type of mutants in the former case,
but not in the latter.) Changing the type of mutant will
make analyzing successive invasions I|T T and IT |I —
which would turn a fully tolerant population into a fully
intolerant one— much easier.

In all invasion scenarios that we will consider, we will
just determine the stability of the resident population
against invasion by mutants, but not the final equilibrium
(hence we do not determine whether there is a turnover of
the invaded population or a final coexistence is reached).
Figures 1–6 correspond to Group I and Group II strategies, whereas Figs. 7–8 correspond to Group III strategies.
The different scenarios are as follows: I|T T , T |IT ,
IT |I, and T |II. Overlaps of these regions are colored
by a mixed color.
First of all, Figures 1–6 show that tolerant communities that follow Group I and Group II strategies can
be invaded by intolerant individuals (I|T T ) if ǫ is sufficiently high and/or b/c sufficiently low. Minorities are
more prone to undergo such a spread of intolerance. Second, if one of the two resident types is intolerant and
the other one is tolerant, intolerant residents can be invaded by tolerant mutants (T |IT ) provided they are a
minority (in all cases that we have analysed y < 0.5).
However, this T |IT region never overlaps with the I|T T
one, so after a spread of intolerance the “economic conditions” must change for tolerance to be restored. Third,
if in a community with tolerant and intolerant residents
the latter are the majority, then this strategy can spread
also among the tolerant residents (IT |I), thus dividing
the community into two separate groups that dislike and
never help each other. And finally, a fully intolerant community resists invasion by tolerant individuals for any
combination of parameters. Hence, there is no way to restore tolerance in a fully intolerant community by tuning
the parameters of the model (but see Section IV A).

If we associate low b/c ratios and high ǫ with strait
conditions, the interpretation emerging from these results
is that economic stress favors the spread of intolerance
within minorities. Once it has invaded a group, tolerance cannot be restored unless the economic conditions
improve. And if intolerance has eventually split the community, not even that can restore tolerance again.

Group III strategies are quite different (Figs. 7–8). A
tolerant population following any of these strategies always resists the invasions of intolerant mutants regardless
of the parameter setting (i.e., invasion I|T T never happens). Furthermore, if one type is tolerant and the other
one intolerant in the resident population, tolerant mutants can invade the intolerant residents (T |IT ). Intolerant mutants can also invade the tolerant residents (IT |I),
but this occurs in a much narrower region of the diagram
compared to what happens for Group I and Group II
strategies. As a matter of fact, intolerant mutants only
succeed if they try to invade a minority of tolerant residents when the rest of the community is intolerant. Furthermore if we start from a society where both subpopulations are intolerant, tolerant mutants have a chance
to invade the minority and spread their strategy (II|T )
—and perhaps eventually turn the community into tolerant individuals in the brown region, overlap between II|T
and T |IT invasion regions. Overall, Group III strategies
prove more stable against intolerance.

A.

Incentives to restore tolerance

As shown in the previous section, if a tolerant
community—or one of the two subpopulations within it—
following a Group I or a Group II strategy eventually
becomes intolerant, there is no way to restore tolerance
again by spreading it among the intolerant individuals.
The only way to achieve this is by “improving the economic conditions” (i.e., decreasing ǫ and/or increasing
b/c). An alternative way to generate the same effect could
be introducing an exogenous incentive. We have implemented one such policy through a reduction of the cost of
helping others. In other words, we assume the presence
of a super-agent who partly subsidises the cost of helping
individuals of a subpopulation. This is done by lowering
the cost of helping B-strategists. By assuming this cost
c′ < c, Eqs. (1) turn into
W ′ (A|R) = b ΘR,A − Θ′A,R ,
W ′ (M |R) = b ΘR,M − Θ′M,R ,

(14)

where
Θ′A,R = c θA,A + c′ θA,B ,
Θ′M,R = c θM,A + c′ θM,B .

(15)

The new scenarios where individuals of a class are given
incentives to help the other class are I|T ′ T , T ′ |IT , I|T ′ I,
and T ′ |II, where primes mark individuals who pay the
lower cost c′ for helping the opposite class. Equations (14) must be used for these individuals, whereas
non-primed individuals follow Eqs. (1), as usual. Intolerant individuals are never marked since they never never
help the opposite class anyway.
From now on we focus only in Groups I and Group II
strategies because tolerant populations following Group
III strategies are intolerance-proof. The most effective
incentive is reached for c′ = 0 (i.e., helping the opposite
class is free). Since strategies belonging to the same group
have a very similar behaviour, we show only one example
for each group in Figs. 9-10.
Starting from a fully intolerant population, we represent in Fig. 9 the region where incentives are able to
promote tolerance in one of the subpopulation (T ′ |II).
Wherever this invasion succeeds, the situation cannot be

reverted, i.e., invasions I|T ′ I never occur for the same parameter values (I|T ′ I and regions T ′ |II do not overlap).
But on the other hand, intolerant residents in a T ′ I population cannot be invaded by tolerant mutants (T ′ I|T )
for the same parameter values (again, T ′ I|T and T ′ |II
regions do not overlap). In other words, if incentives promote tolerance in one subpopulation of fully intolerant
individuals, the other subpopulation will still resist invasions by tolerant mutants. Incentives are thus not enough
to make a fully tolerant community.
On the other hand, Figure 10 shows that the region
of T ′ I|T ′ invasions does overlap with the region of T ′ |II
invasions. Thus, by providing incentives to both A and B
groups, there are chances to transform a fully intolerant
community into a fully tolerant one. The latter is also
stable because the region where T ′ T ′ |I invasions succeed
does not overlap with the T ′ I|T ′ region.
Figure 10 also shows that if an II community has been
formed through a sequence of invasions T T → IT → II
from an original T T community, the values of ǫ and y
where this happens are compatible with those for which
full tolerance might be restored through (extreme, i.e.,
c′ = 0) incentives. The extreme case c′ = 0 is not very
realistic, so in general one will have 0 < c′ < c, and the
overlap regions are presumably smaller. But worse than
that is the fact that, as soon as incentives are removed,
the scenarios of Figs. 1–6 are restored and intolerance
takes over again. So the effect of incentives is not permanent.

V.

DISCUSSION

We have studied under which conditions intolerance
can invade a tolerant community made of two distinguishable subgroups. Our results show differences between two
sets of the stable and coherent strategies known in the literature of indirect reciprocity as leading eight strategies.
In the first set (Groups I and II) intolerance can invade
a tolerant subpopulation if the action error (which might
associate to lack of resources) is high enough and/or the
benefit-to-cost ratio is low. This invasion is more likely
to occur if the invaded subpopulation is a minority. Once
one of the two subpopulation becomes intolerant, there
is no way to restore tolerance under the same economic

conditions. Moreover, if the intolerant minority is large
enough, intolerance can also invade the tolerant minority. A completely intolerant population cannot return to
tolerance even if economic conditions improve.
If one subpopulation is provided incentives to help the
other, tolerance can be restored for a limited region of
parameters, but the other subpopulation does not turn
to tolerance by invasion. To transform a fully intolerant
community into a fully tolerant one both subpopulations
must be stimulated to help the other. Nonetheless, as
soon as these incentives are removed, intolerance can invade again. Thus, incentives have no permanent effect
unless the economic conditions are simultaneously improved. Incentives may provide a temporary mean to
achieve the goal, but improving the economic conditions
is key to make the effect perdurable.
In the second set of strategies (Group III), a fully tolerant population is intolerance-proof. As a matter of fact,
if we start off from a fully intolerant community, tolerant
mutants can invade it much easier than for the first set of
strategies (Groups I and II). The difference between the
second set and the first set—hence the reason why they
resist intolerance—is that the only way for an individual
with bad reputation to achieve a good reputation is if
she helps to another individual with good reputation. In
other words, these strategies are less prone to forgive.
A way to interpret errors in actions is as a measure of
global poverty of the society. If resources are scarce, it
may happen that an individual is forced to deny help that
would otherwise provide. But there may exist alternative
interpretations, e.g., it can also stand as the probability
that an individual is discovered when she secretly tries
to cheat (defect). In this case, the results suggest that
intolerance spreads easier in a society with a high proportion of known fraud. Note that in our model players do
not know the reasons that may drive someone to defect,
i.e., they do not know if a player defects on purpose or
because she lacks the resources for it. The knowledge of
these inner motivations would involve much higher cognitive processes than the simple direct observation that
we are considering here.
In contrast to Nakamura and Masuda [15], we did not
need to make any mean-field approximation since reputations in our model come directly from the observation of
every interaction. The model we introduced is a simpli-

fied description of very complex behaviours in real world.
In particular, our model considers that the whole society
can be split into two classes whose differentiation is based
only on one set of traits. However many different sets of
traits can differentiate individuals in real life, and different people may classify individuals according to different
criteria. Even the relative importance of some of these
traits may change in time [38]. In complex scenarios with
more classes of individuals and different ways to classify
them the results will presumably be different.
The study we have conducted has further limitations.
Apart from the obvious fact that using an indirect reciprocity model with binary reputation and complete information certainly oversimplifies the problem (see [39]
and [32] for a discussion of these issues), the main one
is that we have considered only the onset of invasion by
a small fraction of mutants, but not the existence or absence of mixed equilibria (as can be done, e.g., in direct
reciprocity models [40]). In other words, this study does
not address the more difficult question whether there is a
turn over of the population or a coexistence of strategies.
And definitely simultaneous invasions by different type
of mutants are excluded. There is the implicit assumption that mutants emerge at a rate slower than the time
needed to reach an equilibrium. The existence of mixed
equilibria thus remains an open problem.
These limitations notwithstanding, our study provides
some simple clues that associate the emergence of intolerant attitudes with economic stress and the relative
weight of the subgroups. Remarkably, given the simplicity of the model, economic stress is recognised as one of
the main predictors for the emergence of intolerance [41].
As a matter of fact, this is a typical prediction of social ‘scapegoat’ theories [42], examples of which are the
research on the increased lynching of American blacks
during times of economic distress [43, 44] and the rise
of fascism and anti-Semitism in Germay during the interwar years [45, 46]. Our study also makes some predictions
that are amenable to be tested in real situations, like the
fact that intolerance emerges predominantly within minorities, or—perhaps more importantly—that societies
with a stricter ethics are more resistant to intolerance
than those indulging a relaxed attitude towards defective behavior of their members. We hope that this work
stimulates empirical studies in these directions.

In this scenario a small fraction of tolerant individuals
tries to invade a population where individuals of their
own class are intolerant (θA,B = 0), whereas those of the
other class are tolerant. Since mutants and B-residents
are both tolerant, they will judge every player equally.

Appendix B: Equilibria for the different scenarios

We must obtain the equilibrium solutions of Eqs. (5)–
(8) in order to compute the probabilities θi,j , which depend on xiΛA ΛB ΛM . The set of Eqs. (8) is decoupled from
A ∗ΛM
Eqs. (5)–(7), hence xΛ
can be calculated analytiM
cally from Eq. (8) after solving Eqs. (5)–(7). Thus one
M
can readily obtain gM
and reduce Eq. (8) to a linear system of two equations in two unknowns (for example, xG∗G
M
and xB∗B
M ). In what follows, we describe the processes to
complete our calculations for each different scenario.

PAΛA ΛM (αβ) = δ (ΛM , mαβ (D)) δ (ΛA , 1) .

(B8)

Summing Eqs. (5) over ΛM at equilibrium we obtain

gA

tries to invade a population where individuals of their

are intolerant. Hence θB,A = θB,M = θM,B = 0.
