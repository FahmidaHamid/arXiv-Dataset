Abstract
The motor part of a crawling eukaryotic cell can be represented schematically as an active continuum layer. The main
active processes in this layer are protrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers, contraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active bonding of trans-membrane proteins to a
substrate. All three active mechanisms are regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical feedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In this situation, it is instructive to take a
reverse engineering approach and study a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements inside
a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this paper we assume that (in the range of interest)
the energetic cost of self-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion, the maximization of
the overall velocity. We then choose a prototypical setting, formulate the corresponding variational problem and obtain
a set of bounds suggesting that radically different spatial distributions of adhesive complexes would be optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of self-propulsion. Thus, for contraction-dominated motility, adhesion
has to cooperate with ’pullers’ which localize at the trailing edge of the cell, while for protrusion-dominated motility
it must conspire with ’pushers’ concentrating at the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms were
observed experimentally.

1. Introduction
Eukariotic cells are spatially extended active bodies that can steadily self-propel in viscous environments at low
Reynolds numbers [1, 2]. It has been understood [3, 4, 5] that in these conditions a combination of stationarity
and linearity of friction leads to kinematic reversibility and that a symmetric (under time reversal) stroke cannot
produce self-propulsion. For Stokes swimmers, a variety of non-symmetric motility strategies have been proposed
and optimized using various efficiency criteria [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; similar models for crawlers advancing on a
frictional background were considered in [13, 14, 15]. Most of the self-propulsion mechanisms proposed in these
papers are fully kinematic in the sense that the time dependence of the shape of a swimmer/crawler is prescribed. This
implies that appropriately chosen actuators can always perform the required internal movements. In cells the role of
such actuators is played by active agents and in this paper we focus on the fact that their dynamics, while being driven
biochemically, must be compatible with the fundamental balances of mass and momentum.
In the context of eukaryotic cell motility, a prototypical scheme of self-propulsion includes protrusion through
polymerization of actin filaments which is accompanied by dynamic assembly of focal adhesions; myosin-driven
contraction of the actin network which allows the motor part to advance a cargo, and, finally, detachment of adhesive
contacts with a simultaneous depolymerization of actin fibers [16]. It is usually assumed that active polymerization
ensuring protrusion can be described as the work of spatially distributed pushers, generating positive force couples,
while active contraction can be viewed as an outcome of the mechanical action of distributed pullers, responsible
for negative force couples [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The role of ATP in reversible adhesion of adhesive patches (focal
adhesions) is understood rather poorly and they are usually treated as passive viscous binders whose spatial distribution
may be regulated actively [22] .

Since our knowledge of the mechanism controlling the transport and the intensity of active agents performing
protrusion, contraction and adhesion is rather limited, we adopt in this paper a semi-kinematic approach and treat the
corresponding distributions as functional control parameters constrained by the fundamental mechanical balances. We
then pose a variational problem of finding the optimal temporal and spatial distributions of these parameters inside a
crawling continuum body. In view of some successful attempts to justify such reverse engineering approach [23], we
anticipate that our optimal solutions will be eventually backed by an appropriate constitutive theory.
While the real organisms are expected to optimize some measure of a trade-off between the velocity of selfpropulsion and the corresponding energy expenditure, in this paper we make a simplifying assumption that the energetic cost of self-propulsion is fixed and use as optimality criterion the maximization of the overall velocity. We
are interested in steady translocation and assume that the internal distributions of mechanical parameters are compatible with the traveling wave ansatz. This simplifying assumption allows us to replace the optimization of the
crawling stroke in space and time by a purely spatial optimization of the internal distribution of active elements in
the co-moving coordinate system. In the interest of analytic transparency we use the simplest 1D model of actively
contracting continuum (subjected to viscous frictional forces) that has been used repeatedly in the cell motility studies
[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 16, 31]. In a setting similar to ours the dependence of cell velocity on the distribution of
active stresses and adhesion properties was studied in [18] where both contraction and protrusion were represented by
active couples. Given that protrusion is usually localized at the leading edge of the cell, we model the effect of active
polymerization differently by using Stefan type boundary conditions on the edges of a crawling segment that fix the
influx and the outflow of actin, see also [32, 33, 21]. For the given strength of protrusion, we prescribe the average
level of contractile activity, and then search for the optimal internal distribution of contractile and adhesive units.
Our analysis of the ensuing variational problem demonstrates that radically different distributions of focal adhesions are optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of self-propulsion. Thus, for contractiondominated motility, focal adhesions have to cooperate with pullers which end up localizing at the trailing edge of
the cell while for protrusion-dominated motility they must conspire with pushers which concentrate in our model at
the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms have been observed experimentally.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formulate the model. A simple analytically tractable case of
contraction dominated motility is treated in Section 3. In Section 4 we obtain analytically upper and low bounds for
the self-propulsion velocity in the general case. The same optimization problem was studied numerically in Section
5. In Section 6 we present some evidence that our lower bound may in fact coincide with the optimal solution. The
last Section 7 contains the discussion of our results.
2. The model
Following [29, 32], we consider a one-dimensional segment of viscous active gel representing the cell lamellipodium on a frictional substrate. The segment has two free boundaries which we identify as the trailing edge l− (t)
and the leading edge l+ (t). The force balance can be written in the form
∂ x σ = ξv

(1)

where σ(x, t) is the stress and v(x, t) is the velocity. We assume that the frictional coefficient mimicking the distribution
of focal adhesions [33, 34, 32, 35, 36, 37] is space and time dependent ξ(x, t) ≥ 0. The constitutive behavior of the
gel is modeled by the equation [29, 32]
σ = η∂ x v + χ,
(2)
where the active pre-stress χ(x, t) ≥ 0 accounting for the presence of myosin molecular motors [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]
is also assumed to be a function of space and time. For simplicity we assume that the bulk viscosity coefficient
η > 0 is constant. The assumption of infinite compressibility in (2) allows us to decouple the transport of (actin)
density ρ(x, t) from force balance making the mechanical problem ’statically determinate’. The mass balance equation
∂t ρ + ∂ x (ρv) = 0 can then be solved independently after the velocity field is determined [43, 44].
We further assume that some internal mechanism (stiffness of the cell cortex [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50], osmotic
pressure actively controlled by the channels and pumps on the cell membrane [51, 52], etc.) maintains a given size
L0 = l+ − l− of the cell. Therefore the stress at the edges must be the same σ(l− (t), t) = σ(l+ (t), t) = σ0 , where σ0 (t)
is then an unknown function. To model active protrusion we impose two kinematic Stefan type boundary conditions
2

characterizing the rate of actin polymerization v+ > 0 and depolymerization v− > 0 on the boundaries of the moving
segment [29, 34, 32, 33, 43]
l˙± = v± + v(l± (t), t).
(3)
For consistency, the overall mass balance must be also respected on the moving boundaries and we set ρ(l− (t), t)v− =
ρ(l+ (t), t)v+ , which implies an instantaneous recycling of depolymerized actin from the trailing edge to the leading
edge, see [21, 43] for more detail on such closure of the treadmilling cycle. While there is considerable experimental
evidence that active polymerization is indeed localized at the leading edge of a crawling cell, the de-polymerization
may be spread along the length of the lamellipodium [33, 32]. However, in the interest of analytic transparency, such
spreading will be ignored in this study, see though [43].
The two functions χ and ξ can be interpreted as infinite dimensional controls parameters and found through an
optimization procedure. Even in the absence of a detailed microscopic model governing the rearrangement of these
agents we still need to subject them to integral constraints prescribing the average number of adhesion complexes [42]

where χ∗ > 0 is another given constant representing the average number of contractile motors [53] . It is clear from
(4,5) that since we prescribe the density of active agents, the performance of the self-propulsion machinery will be
proportional to the length of the active segment, so the appropriate velocity functional may be also normalized by the
total length.
To simplify the analysis we further assume that the motion of the active segment is steady [32, 33] with unknown
velocity V = l˙− = l˙+ and that the unknown functions σ, v and the unknown controls ξ, χ depend exclusively on the
appropriately chosen
p co-moving coordinate u = (x − x0 − Vt)/L0 ∈ [−1/2, 1/2] . Then in dimensionless variables

Now, if we assume that the two parameters (Vm , ∆V), characterizing actin treadmilling, are fixed we can pose the
optimization problem of finding the controls g1 (u), g2 (u) ensuring the maximization of the normalized velocity V.
This problem is nontrivial because the functional V{g1 , g2 } is prescribed implicitly through the unknown solution
of the boundary value problem (6,8). To our advantage though this linear elliptic problem is classical and is well
understood, e.g. [54].
We observe that parameter Vm enters the expression for the velocity (9) in an additive way and does not affect
the solution of the optimization problem. The reason is that Vm characterizes a propulsion mode associated with
simple accretion of the material at the front and its simultaneous removal at the rear; when Vm , 0 an a priori polarity
is imposed and the problem of motility initiation disappears. In view of the complete decoupling of this mode of
self-propulsion from our controls, in what follows we assume without loss of generality that Vm = 0.
The second parameter ∆V, also characterizing the protrusion strength, does not induce polarity. As we clarify
in the next Section, this parameter represents the mechanical action of pushers and the dependence of the crawling
velocity on ∆V, which is now sensitive to both controls, is much more subtle than in the case of Vm .
3. Pushers and pullers

Here the term in the left hand side characterizes the total moment due to external (frictional) forces. The first term in
the the right hand side
T = ∆V
R 1/2
is due to active protrusion, while the second term −1/2 g2 (u)du = 1 is due to active contraction. The last term σ0
corresponds to passive reaction forces resulting from the prescription of the length of the segment.
Our assumption that ∆V > 0 means that the protrusion couple has a negative sign showing that the corresponding
force dipoles act on the surrounding medium by pushing outward and creating negative stress. Instead, the contraction
couple has a positive sign because the contractile forces pull inward and the induced stresses are positive. We can
therefore associate protrusion with the presence of pushers and contraction with the activity of pullers [18, 21]. We
can also (tentatively) argue that motility is protrusion-dominated when T > 1 and it is contraction-dominated when
0 < T < 1. This assertion will be confirmed later in the paper by rigorous analysis.
To illustrate the different roles played in our motility mechanism by pushers and pullers, we present below an
analysis of a toy model which anticipates the main conclusions of the paper. We temporarily set ∆V = 0 and describe
the distribution of pushers and pullers by the same function g2 (u) allowing it now to be both positive and negative.
Our goal is to show that for protrusion-dominated motility driven by pushers, it is beneficial to create strong adhesion
at the leading edge while for contraction-dominated motility driven by pullers, it is the trailing edge that has to adhere
most strongly.
Consider a special choices of control functions,
g1 (u) = qδ(u − u1 ) + (1 − q)δ(u − u2 ), g2 (u) = pδ(u − u3 ) − (1 − p)δ(u − u4 ),

(11)

where δ is the Dirac distribution, 0 ≤ q, p ≤ 1 and −1/2 ≤ u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 ≤ 1/2. The control function g1 (u) represents
two adhesion sites u = u1 and u = u2 whose locations and intensities must be optimized in relation to the prescribed
position of a single puller placed at u = u3 and characterized by a positive dipole moment p and a single pusher located
at u = u4 and characterized by a negative dipole moment p − 1. The parameter p measures the relative importance of
contraction comparing to protrusion.
Suppose that
u3 < u1 , u2 < u4
(12)

which ensures that our active segment moves from left to right and that in the segment the adhesion sites are always
outside the location of the active agents. By using (11) we can express the velocity of the segment as

1 + q(1 − q)(u2 − u1 )L2

Suppose for simplicity that our two adhesive complexes are placed symmetrically with respect to the center of the
segment u1 = 1 − u2 . We can then use a single parameter ∆u = u1 + 1/2 = 1/2 − u2 to obtain,

(13)

Because of the imposed inequalities (12), we must necessarily have in this configuration u3 = −1/2 and u4 = 1/2
meaning that pushers and pullers must also localize at the edges. Notice however that inequalities u3 < u1 and u2 < u4
are necessary for formula (13) to hold so the apparent conclusion that u3 = u1 = 1/2 and u4 = u2 = −1/2 is a result
of an abuse of notation. In a theory where, pushers, pullers and adhesion complexes have a characteristic size of
dispersion, the adhesion clusters will be slightly ahead of pullers and slightly behind the pushers so that active agents
take advantage of the firm attachment to either push or pull (see more on this subject below).
From our simple analysis it follows that if pullers dominate (p > 1/2), the optimal way to tune adhesion is to set
q = 1 and concentrate adhesive complexes at the trailing edge of the moving segment achieving maximum velocity
V = 1 when p = 1. If, instead, pushers dominate (p < 1/2), the optimal way to tune adhesion is to set q = 0 and
concentrate adhesive complexes at the leading edge. In this case, the maximal velocity is again V = 1 given that
p = 0. In other words, to be effective, pullers have to concentrate on the trailing edge and ensure strong adhesion on
the leading edge: in this way pullers can inflict contraction that displaces the trailing edge which due to the length
constraint also propels the leading edge. On the contrary, pushers can take advantage of the firm attachment at the
trailing edge to push against it and propel the leading edge which in turn pulls the trailing edge due to the length
constraint.
4. Contraction driven motility
We now return to the study of the optimization problem in the original formulation. The simplest analytically
transparent case is when protrusion is disabled ∆V = 0 and motility is fully contraction-driven.
Suppose first that g1 ≡ 1 which means that the adhesion complexes are distributed uniformly. Then the velocity
of the active segment can be expressed as a quadrature
V=−

(14)

−1/2

One can see that if the function g2 (u) is even, then V = 0. This result can be interpreted as an analogue of the famous
Purcell’s theorem about the necessity of non-symmetric strokes in Stokes swimming [4, 2]. If the distribution g2 (u) is
non-symmetric and, for instance, more motors are placed at the rear of the segment, the velocity will become positive.
Using the fact g2 (u) ≥ 0 we can also conclude from (14) that V ≤ 1/2. This upper bound is reached when all the
motors are fully localized at the rear and g2 (u) = δ(u + 1/2).

Now, consider the general case when the focal adhesions are distributed inhomogeneously. Since (6) is a SturmLiouville problem, its solution can be written as

(16)

(17)

In (16), C = (h f 0 − f h0 )/g1 is a constant involving the Wronskian of the two auxiliary functions h(u) and f (u) and 1
is the indicator function. We can now write
Z
1 1/2
V=

where we introduced a new measure of inhomogeneity of contraction:
R 1/2
h(u)g2 (u)du
−1/2
.
ĝ2 = R 1/2
h(u)du
−1/2
If both functions g1,2 (u) are even, then f (u) is odd and, since the integral of a product of an odd and an even functions
is equal to zero, we obtain that V = 0. The same result follows if we assume that contraction is homogeneous
g2 (u) = ĝ2 = 1 while the adhesion distribution g1 (u) is arbitrary. Therefore, to ensure motility at ∆V = 0, contraction
must be inhomogeneous while adhesion may still be uniform provided contraction is not even.
To find the optimal distributions g1 (u), g2 (u) we proceed in two steps. We first show that V ≤ 1 and then find a
configuration of controls allowing the cell to reach this bound.
Notice that we can rewrite (18) in the form

Observe that in the case of a homogeneous distribution of adhesive clusters, the velocity could reach only one half of
this maximal value.
We now show that the maximal velocity V = 1 can be reached if both controls g1 (u) and g2 (u) are fully localized.
Take θ > 0 and consider a regularized distribution
g1 (u; θ) =

For this choice of g1 (u) the auxiliary functions h(u) and f (u) can be written explicitly in term of Legendre polynomials.
In the limit θ → 0 and limθ→0 g1 (u; θ) = δ(u − u1 ) we obtain
(
1 if u ≤ u1
h(u) = 1 and f (u) =

It is now clear that the velocity reaches its maximal value as u1 → −1/2 while u2 < u1 . We can then formally write
u2 = u1 = −1/2 and obtain the controls g2 (u) = g1 (u) = δ(u + 1/2) saturating the bound V = 1. Notice, however, that
if we assume directly u1 = u2 → −1/2 in (20), we obtain V = 1/2. This is in agreement with the physical intuition
that the anchorage point must be located to the right of the pulling force dipole: in this case the pulling forces advance
the rear edge of the segment with minimal slipping. Mathematically, we encounter here the case of non-commutation
of the limiting procedures u2 → −1/2 and u1 → −1/2 giving V = 1 only if the limits are taken in the above order.
To summarize, the optimization of the distribution of focal adhesions allows the contraction-dominated mechanism of cell motility to reach the value of velocity which is twice as large as when the adhesion is uniform. This
means that in order to improve the motility performance the adhesion machinery must conspire with the contraction
machinery making sure that both the motors and the adhesive centers are localized at the trailing edge. Interestingly,
exactly this type of correlation between the stresses created by contraction and the distribution of focal adhesions was
observed in experiments and numerical simulations [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 22]. The localization of adhesion complexes
close to cell edges, where contraction is the strongest, has been also reported outside the motility context [60, 61, 62].
5. Upper and lower bounds for velocity in the general case
We now turn to the general case where both contraction and protrusion are active. In particular, the protrusive
power will be characterized by the parameter ∆V = T > 0 which was assumed to be equal to zero in the previous
Section. We can then write

As we see, the first term in the right hand side is associated with protrusion-based (or filament-driven [63]) motility
while, as we have already seen, the second term is the contribution due to contraction-based (or motor-driven [63] )
motility. We notice that if g1 (u) is even, then f (u) is odd and h(u) is even, leading to

Consider first the case of protrusion-driven motility by assuming that contraction is homogeneous g2 (u) ≡ 1 and
therefore does not contribute to the overall velocity. By using again the maximum principle we obtain inequalities

(22)

The maximum of the protrusive contribution to velocity is reached when, g1 (u) = δ(u − 12 ), because in this case h = 1
and f = 1 almost everywhere. Observe, that the optimal solution in the case of protrusion-driven motility is in some
sense opposite to the solution g1 (u) = δ(u + 1/2) obtained in the case of the contraction-driven motility.
Based on (19) and (22) we can now argue that in the case when both treadmilling and contraction are present, an
upper bound for velocity is
T
V ≤ + 1,
2
however, as we have just seen, in view of the incompatibility of the corresponding optimal controls, this bound cannot
be reached. The optimal strategy for focal adhesions would then involve a compromise between the necessity to
localize adhesion at the trailing edge in order to assist the contraction mechanism and the competing trend to localize
adhesion at the leading edge in order to improve the protrusion power of the cell.
To obtain a lower bound for V we now consider a particular test function representing a weighted sum of our
competing optimal controls, g1 (u) = qδ(u + 1/2) + (1 − q)δ(u − 1/2). We also chose g2 (u) = δ(u − u0 ), where q ∈ [0, 1]
and u0 ∈ [−1/2, 1/2] are two parameters to be optimized. Then, by solving (17) we obtain,

The optimization with respect to u0 gives u0 = −1/2 and
V=

− q(T − 1).

Finally, optimizing in q we obtain that if T < 1, we need to take q = 0 and if T > 1, we get q = 1. This result, illustrated
in Fig 1, suggests that there is a switch at T = 1 between the contraction-centered optimization strategy (q = 0) and
the protrusion-centered optimization strategy (q = 1). Notice that the switch takes place exactly when the negative
protrusion generated couple T becomes equal to the positive contractile couple equal to 1. At an interesting state T =
1, the two active mechanisms neutralize each other and activity-related dipoles become invisible behind the passive
contributions in Eq. (10): in this case the optimal position of active and adhesive agents becomes indeterminate.

Figure 1: Solid lines: Lower bound on the optimal velocity of self-propulsion V as a function of the measure of the (relative) protrusive strength
T . The optimal strategy depends on whether contraction (T < 1 ) or protrusion (T > 1) dominates. The dashed line represents the upper bound
obtained by formally summing the incompatible upper bounds for the protrusion and contraction based strategies. The dotted line represents a
sub-optimal strategy obtained under the assumption that adhesion is homogeneous. Insets illustrate the associated configurations of controls g1 (u)
and g2 (u).

6. Numerical solution of the optimization problem
To show that the low bound obtained in the previous Section is rather close to being optimal, here we solve the
optimization problem numerically. A finite dimensional reduction of the original variational problem is constructed
by selecting N + 2 points ui = i/(N + 1) − 1/2 that subdivide the segment [-1/2,1/2]. We then localize adhesion and
contraction in these points by choosing the control functions in the form
g1 (u) =

N
X

gi1 δ(u − ui ), g2 (u) =

i=1

N+1
X

gi2 δ(u − ui ),

i=0

where i=0 gi2 = i=1 gi1 = 1 and gi1 ≥ 0, gi2 ≥ 0. In this way we also mimic the discrete nature of real adhesive
clusters and real myosin motors, so in some respects the discrete problem is even more realistic than the continuum
one.
By solving the auxiliary linear elliptic problems for this choice of controls we obtain that the functions h(u) and
PN
PN
f (u) are piece-wise constant h(u) = i=0
Ai 1[ui ,ui+1 [ (u) and f (u) = i=0
Ci 1[ui ,ui+1 [ (u). The coefficients with i ∈ [2, N]
satisfy the equations

The boundary conditions give
A0 = 1, AN = 1, C0 = 1, C N = −1.
We use the conventions A−1 = A0 , AN+1 = AN , C−1 = C0 and C N+1 = C N to express the velocity V in the form

The function (23) was optimized numerically with respect to parameters gi1 and gi2 subjected to the appropriate equality
and inequality type constraints. To find the global minimum we used the method of simulated annealing with initial
guesses corresponding to homogeneous configurations. In Fig.2, illustrating our results for N = 100, one can see that
for T < 1 both optimal functions g1 (u) and g2 (u) are localized at the trailing edge. Instead, for T > 1 we observe
that g1 (u) localizes at the leading edge while g2 (u) localizes at the trailing edge. The value of the maximal velocity,
obtained numerically, is the same as in the bound up to an error proportional to the mesh size. Notice also that the
optimally spaced adhesion points are shifted from the locations of force dipoles by a mesh size. Thus, the solution
of the numerical (regularized) problem in the contraction-dominated regime (with T = 0.9), shown in Fig. 2, clearly
distinguishes the optimal functions g1 (u) and g2 (u) that are both localized at the size of the mesh. The function
g1 (u) remains different from zero at one mesh size beyond the point where we already have g2 (u) = 0 (for positive
velocity). In the protrusion-dominated regime (at T = 1.1) shown in Fig. 2, the mesh size again prevents localization
of the function g1 (u) exactly at the leading edge while g2 (u) localizes exactly at the trailing edge. These observations
confirm that the regularized numerical solution is more realistic than its singular analytic prototype. Overall, our
numerical results are in full agreement with the analytic bounds which suggests that that these bounds are (nearly)
sharp.

7. Local stability analysis
In this Section we use a perturbation analysis to provide additional evidence that our lower bounds are close to
being optimal.
In what follows we use the superscript ◦ to indicate the unperturbed state and superscript ? to mark parameters
characterizing the perturbed configuration. We assume that for all functions φ(u) the following expansion holds in the
first order
φ(u) = φ◦ (u) + φ? (u),
where  is a small parameter. Keeping only the first order term in the expression for V, we obtain

Suppose now that we perturb the ’optimal’ controls g◦1 (u) = g◦2 (u) = δ(u + 1/2) delivering the lower bound for
velocity at T < 1. We can again formally set

h (u) ≡ 1 and f (u) =

From (26) we see that if T ≤ 1, a perturbation of the controls g◦1 (u) = g◦2 (u) = δ(u + 1/2) leads to the decrease of the

we obtain a perturbation with V > 0. These observations suggest that beyond the threshold T = 1 the control
function g1 (u) should be no longer localized at the trailing edge edge. We also see that the most ’efficient’ way to
make the velocity larger at T > 1 is to localize the function r(u) at the leading edge of the segment (at u = 1/2).
Consider now a perturbation of the set of controls g◦1 (u) = δ(u − 1/2) and g◦2 (u) = δ(u + 1/2) delivering our lower
bound for T > 1. With the same abuse of notations as before we can write

where again r(u) ≥ 0 and l(u) ≥ 0 and therefore also q ≥ 0 and p ≥ 0. The ensuing perturbation of velocity is

It is now clear that if T ≥ 1, then V ≤ 0, showing that the perturbations of controls are sub-optimal. This gives
another evidence that the test function providing the lower bound for velocity at T ≥ 1 are at least close to being
optimal.
Based on this analysis we conjecture that the function V(T ), representing the optimal velocity, is piece-wise linear
with a kink at T = 1. The presence of a threshold indicates a switch from contraction-dominated motility pattern
to protrusion-dominated motility pattern. As the relative power of protrusion, epitomized by T , increases beyond
this threshold, the focal adhesions, maintaining the optimality of the self-propulsion velocity, must migrate from the
trailing to the leading edge of the active segment. The dynamic migration of adhesion proteins to the edges has been
observed in experiments [60]. In real cells, however, both edges are usually populated by adhesion complexes and we
can speculate that in this way cells can adjust smoothly to transitions from one driving mode to another.
11

8. Discussion
In this paper we used a simple analytically tractable model of cell motility to study the optimal strategies allowing
cells to move faster by actively coordinating spatial distributions of contractile and adhesive agents. Our study reveals
that if adhesion complexes can detect the dominating mechanism of self propulsion, they can self-organize to ensure
the best performance.
We made specific predictions regarding the advantageous correlations between the distributions of adhesive and
force producing agents and showed that the dependence of the maximal velocity of self-propulsion on the relative
strength of contraction and protrusion may be non-monotone. In particular, our model predicts that a limited activation
of protrusion will necessarily lower the maximal velocity achieved in a purely contractile mode of self-propulsion.
However, as the protrusion strength increases, protrusion can overtake contraction and the velocity of self-propulsion
will increase beyond the level achieved in the contraction-dominated case.
Previously we have shown that contraction-driven motility mechanism may be sufficient by itself to explain cell
polarization, motility initiation, motility arrest and the symmetrization of a cell before mitosis [31, 44]. From the
analysis presented in this paper it becomes evident that, if the speed of self propulsion is an issue, cells should
mostly rely on protrusion. More specifically, to maximize its velocity performance after motility initiation a cell must
switch from contraction-dominated to protrusion-dominated motility mechanism by increasing the protrusive power
and appropriately rearranging the distribution of adhesive complexes. It was shown in [43] that similar transitions
between contraction and protrusion mechanisms can be used by a cell to accommodate different types of cargos.
To compare our predictions with experiments we can use numerical values of parameters for keratocyte fragments
[29, 34, 32]. We obtain the following rough estimates: χ∗ = 103 Pa, ξ∗ = 3 × 1016 Pa · m−2 · s, η = 3 × 104 Pa · s,
L0 = 10µm, Vm = 8µm · min−1 and ∆V = 0.6µm · min−1 . Our first quantitative prediction concerns the case when
active treadmilling of actin is knocked down and adhesion is homogeneous. As we have shown, the largest velocity
in this case is reached when all myosin motors are localized at the trailing edge as observed in most eukariotic cells
[64, 65, 66, 67]. In dimensional form, the predicted maximal velocity is V = L0 χ∗ /(2η) ≈ 10µm · min−1 , which is low
in view of the data on keratocyte fragments suggesting that velocity should be in the interval 30 − 40µm · min−1 [68].
This is not surprising because according to our results only half of the total amount of motors is ”used” in this case
which implies that adhesion homogeneity is highly sub-optimal.
If the adhesion inhomogeneity is allowed, the configuration becomes optimal when both myosins and integrins are
localized at the trailing edge. Such highly correlated distributions have been observed in experiments and generated
in microscale-based numerical models [60, 56, 61, 62, 57, 58, 59, 69]. In this case, as a result of the cooperative
response, a cell can be more efficient achieving the velocity that is two times larger than in the case of homogeneous
adhesion: V = L0 χ∗ /η ≈ 20µm · min−1 .
To be even closer to reality we need to take active treadmilling into consideration and our estimates suggest that
T ≈ 0.1  1. This means that we are in the contraction-dominated motility regime for which our velocity bound
gives more realistic value V = Vm + L0 χ∗ /η ≈ 28µm · min−1 . Notice, however, that reducing the value χ∗ by one order
of magnitude, which is within the existing error bounds, we may easily reach the regime where T > 1 and where
it would becomes more beneficial for adhesion clusters to localize at the leading edge conspiring with protrusive
elements. A spatial correlation of this type between adhesion and protrusion has been recorded in both experiments
and comprehensive numerical models, see for instance the data in [70, 71] on nematode spermatozoa.
The proposed model can be also tested indirectly. For instance, we know that the location of adhesion complexes
in a moving cell can be identified by measuring the distribution of traction forces in the elastic environment [72, 73].
If the adhesive complexes are found to be shifted towards the leading edge, we would argue that the cell relies for its
advance mostly on actin treadmilling. If instead the adhesive complexes are preferentially positioned at the trailing
edge, our model suggests that motility is mostly driven by contraction. Both predictions can be tested by independent
measurements.
An interesting possibility would be if cells could alternate the location of maximum adhesion between the trailing
edge and the leading edge in response to oscillations in the level of activity of pullers and pushers. The evidence of
such switching may be that both location are populated with adhesive complexes. We may also recall that the classical
mechanism of crawling for eukaryotic cells involves two phases [24, 74, 26, 75]: one of them is associated with the
creation of protrusions that push at the front while relying on the stabilization of the trailing edge and another one
involves pulling of the rear (of the cargo) which requires fixation at the front. The switching between these two phases
12

takes place almost periodically and the associated reorganization of adhesion clusters from the leading to the trailing
edge has been well documented [76, 72]. To capture such non-steady motility pattern in the framework of our model,
the simplifying traveling wave assumption would have to be replaced by a more complex ansatz.
In conclusion, we emphasize that our interpretations are based on the study of a variational problem whose analysis
revealed some interesting correlations between the spatial arrangement of adhesion and contraction agents and has
led us to quantitative predictions that are in agreement with experiment. The prototypical nature of the proposed
model, however, conceals considerable complexity of the actual cell motility phenomenon which involves intricate
bio-chemical feedback loops, geometrically complex mechanical flows and highly nontrivial rheological behavior. In
particular, the singular nature of the obtained solutions can be at least partially linked to the fact that treadmilling
is modeled schematically, with polymerization and depolymerization processes localized at the edges: at least one
additional control function describing the distribution of pushers is needed to regularize the problem in this respect.
The situation is complicated further by the fact that the dominant trade-off condition, controlling the self-organization
of active agents, is still unknown notwithstanding some recent results in this direction [23]. However, even in the
absence of the definitive optimization criterion and with minimal assumptions about the inner working of the motility
machinery, our study reveals that depending on the task and the available resources a cell may have to modify its mode
of operation rather drastically to ensure the best possible performance.
