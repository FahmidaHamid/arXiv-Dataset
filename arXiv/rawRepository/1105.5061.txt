Abstract
Background
Dielectric spectra of human blood reveal a rich variety of dynamic processes. Achieving a better characterization and understanding of these processes not only is of academic interest but also of high relevance for medical applications as, e.g., the determination
of absorption rates of electromagnetic radiation by the human body.
Methods
The dielectric properties of human blood are studied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, systematically investigating the
dependence on temperature and hematocrit value. By covering a frequency range from 1 Hz to 40 GHz, information on all the
typical dispersion regions of biological matter is obtained.
Results and conclusions
We find no evidence for a low-frequency relaxation (”α-relaxation”) caused, e.g., by counterion diffusion effects as reported
for some types of biological matter. The analysis of a strong Maxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the polarization of the cell
membranes in the 1-100 MHz region (”β-relaxation”) allows for the test of model predictions and the determination of various
intrinsic cell properties. In the microwave region beyond 1 GHz, the reorientational motion of water molecules in the blood
plasma leads to another relaxation feature (”γ-relaxation”). Between β- and γ-relaxation, significant dispersion is observed, which,
however, can be explained by a superposition of these relaxation processes and is not due to an additional ”δ-relaxation” often
found in biological matter.
General significance
Our measurements provide dielectric data on human blood of so far unsurpassed precision for a broad parameter range. All data
are provided in electronic form to serve as basis for the calculation of the absorption rate of electromagnetic radiation and other
medical purposes. Moreover, by investigating an exceptionally broad frequency range, valuable new information on the dynamic
processes in blood is obtained.

1. Introduction
Blood is a highly functional body fluid, it delivers oxygen
to the vital parts, it transports nutrients, vitamins, and metabolites and it also is a fundamental part of the immune system.
Therefore the precise knowledge of its constituents, its physical, biological, and chemical properties and its dynamics is of
great importance. Especially its dielectric parameters are of relevance for various medical applications [1], like cell separation
(e.g., cancer cells from normal blood cells [2]), checking the
deterioration of preserved blood [3], and dielectric coagulometry [4]. In addition, the precise knowledge of the dielectric
properties of blood is prerequisite for fixing limiting values for

electromagnetic pollution (via the conductivity in the specific
absorption rate (SAR))[5, 6, 7, 8].
Early measurements of the electrical properties of blood contributed significantly to unravel the constitution of red blood
cells (RBC). For example, the results by Höber [9] provided
the first indications of a dispersion (i.e. frequency dependence),
caused by the membrane of RBCs, in the radio frequency (RF)
spectrum of the dielectric properties of blood. This relaxation
process is nowadays identified as being of Maxwell-Wagner
type [10, 11] and termed β-relaxation in biophysical literature
[12, 13].
Various early works [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] were followed by measurements at very high frequencies [22, 23, 24,
25]. Some of them revealed an additional dispersion with a relaxation rate near 18 GHz, which can be assigned to the reorientation of water molecules and which is named γ-dispersion.
Furthermore, a third relaxation, termed α-relaxation and loMarch 11, 2015

cated in the low-frequency regime, ν < 100 kHz was detected in some biological materials [26, 27]. However, interestingly, an α-relaxation seems to be absent in whole blood
[28] and only is found in hemolyzed blood cells [27]. This
was speculated to be due to a higher ion permeability of the
membranes in the latter case, shifting the relaxation spectrum
into the experimental frequency window [27]. The origin of
the α-relaxation is a matter of controversy; most commonly it
is assumed to arise from counterion diffusion effects [13, 29].
Finally, a dispersion with low dipolar strength located in the
frequency regime between the β- and γ-dispersion was identified by Schwan [12]. The origin of the δ-dispersion and the
possible role of bound water in its generation is controversially
discussed [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].
Taking together all these results, it is clear that there are
three main dispersion regions in the dielectric frequency spectrum of blood between some Hz and 50 GHz, termed β, γ, and
δ [12, 13]. This nomenclature should not be confused with
that used in the investigation of glassy matter like supercooled
liquids or polymers. Within the glass-physics community the
terms α-, β-relaxation, etc. are commonly applied to completely different phenomena than those considered above (see,
e.g., refs 39 and 40). In the present work we follow the biophysical nomenclature.
A lot of additional research has been done until the early
1980s [1, 41, 42, 43, 44] and a detailed review was given in
1983 by Schwan [13]. Later on, in the course of the upcoming
debates about electromagnetic pollution, dielectric properties of
body tissues and fluids received renewed interest as they determine the SAR, a measure for the absorption of electromagnetic
fields by biological tissue [8, 45, 46, 47, 48]. But also various
other important medical questions can be addressed by dielectric spectroscopy [1, 2, 3, 4, 49]. In the last two decades, a
number of papers on dielectric spectroscopy on blood and erythrocyte solutions were published [35, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,
56, 57], most of them treating special aspects only.
On the theoretical side, a number of models for the description of cell suspensions have been proposed. Most models focus on the β-relaxation [12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 58, 59, 60, 61,
62, 63, 64], including the often employed Pauly-Schwan model
[12, 58], discussed below. Some of them also account for the
non-spherical shape of cells [14, 15, 16, 17, 61]. It seems clear
that diluted solutions and whole blood with a hematocrit value
of 86% have to be treated differently. The Bruggeman-Hanai
model [20, 59] was specially developed for highly concentrated
suspensions. A recent summary of various models can be found
in ref. [61].
Concluding this introduction, it has to be stressed that, after more than one century of research, many aspects of the
dielectric properties of blood (e.g., the presence and origins
of α- and δ-dispersion) are still unclear. It should be noted
that, in addition to the three main dispersion effects, from a
theoretical viewpoint a number of further relaxation features
may show up in blood. For example, it is well known that
RBC’s are far from being of spherical shape and in principle
for shelled ellipsoidal particles up to six relaxations can be expected [61]. Furthermore, the hemoglobin molecules within the

RBC’s should show all the typical complex dynamics as found
in other proteins. Based on the available literature data (e.g.,
[13]), it seems that most, if not all, of these additional processes do not or only weakly contribute to the experimentally
observed spectra. However, one should carefully check for possible deviations from the simple three-relaxation scenario mentioned above, which may well be ascribed to these additional
processes.
Maybe the best and most cited broadband spectra of blood
covering several dispersion regions are those by Gabriel et al
[46], taken at 37 C, which are commonly used for SAR calculations and for medical purposes. However, even these data
are hampered by considerable scatter and they are composed
from data collected by different groups on different samples.
Clearly, high-quality spectra covering a broad frequency range
measured on identical samples are missing. A systematic investigation of the hematocrit and temperature dependence is
essential to achieve a better understanding of the different dispersion contributions of blood. The present work provides the
dielectric constant ε′ , the loss ε′′ , and the conductivity σ′ of
human blood in a broad frequency range (1 Hz to 40 GHz), by
using a combination of different techniques of dielectric spectroscopy applied to identical samples. In addition, the temperature (280 K - 330 K) and hematocrit value (0 - 86%) dependence
is thoroughly investigated.
2. Models and Data Analysis
Dielectric spectroscopy is sensitive to dynamical processes
that involve the reorientation of dipolar entities or displacement of charged entities, which can cause a dispersive behavior of the dielectric constant and loss. However, also nonintrinsic Maxwell-Wagner effects caused by interfacial polarization in heterogeneous samples can lead to considerable dispersion [10, 11, 65]. As mentioned above, biological matter shows various dispersions in the frequency regime 1 Hz to
40 GHz, which have different microscopic and mesoscopic origins and therefore have to be described differently.
2.1. Intrinsic Relaxations
Intrinsic processes like, e.g., the cooperative reorientation of
dipolar molecules are often described by the Debye formula
[66]:
ε∗ (ν) = ε∞ +

∆ε
1 + i2πντ

(1)

The relaxation strength is given by ∆ε = εs − ε∞ . εs and ε∞
are the limiting values of the real part of the dielectric constant
for frequencies well below and above the relaxation frequency
νrelax = 1/(2πτ), respectively. This frequency is characterized
by an inflection point in the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and a peak in the dielectric loss. If taking into
account an additional dc-conductivity contribution, the conductivity shows a steplike increase close to νrelax . The Debye theory
assumes that all entities do relax with the same relaxation time
τ. In reality, a distribution of relaxation times often leads to
2

a considerable smearing out of the spectral features [67, 68].
Those can be described, e.g., by the Havriliak-Negami formula,
which is an empirical extension of the Debye formula by the
additional parameters α and β [69, 70]:

ε∗ (ν) = ε∞ + 

equation or its extensions (Eqs. 1 and 2). A variety of models
have been developed to connect the obtained fitting parameters
with the intrinsic dielectric properties of the different regions
of the samples (see section 2.5) and a lot of modeling work of
experimental data was performed [12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 57,
58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79].

2.3. Electrode Polarization

Special cases of this formula are the Cole-Cole formula [71]
with 0 ≤ α < 1 and β = 1 and the Cole-Davidson formula
[72, 73] with α = 0 and 0 < β ≤ 1.
In most materials with intrinsic relaxations, the inevitable dc
conductivity σdc arising from ionic or electronic charge transport cannot be neglected. Usually it leads to a 1/ν divergence in
the loss at frequencies below the loss peak and can be taken into
account by including a further additive term ε′′dc = σdc /(ε0 ω) in
Eq. 2 (ε0 denotes the permittivity of free space, ω is the circular
frequency).

Blood exhibits strong ionic conductivity. At low frequencies
the ions arrive at the metallic electrodes and accumulate in thin
layers immediately below the sample surface [80, 81, 82, 83].
The frequency, below which this effect sets in, critically depends on electrode distance and ionic mobility and in biological matter typically is located in the kHz - MHz region. These
insulating layers represent large capacitors leading to an apparent increase of ε′ (ν) and decrease of σ′ (ν) at low frequencies,
quite similar to the Maxwell-Wagner effects discussed above.
These non-intrinsic contributions can hamper the unequivocal
detection of the parameters of the β-relaxation. Various experimental techniques have been applied to avoid the influence of
electrode polarization (see, e.g., refs. 28, 50, 81). An alternative way is the exact modeling of these non-intrinsic contributions. The most common models are a parallel RC circuit or
a so-called constant-phase element, both connected in series to
the bulk sample [81, 82, 83].
A parallel RC circuit corresponds to an additional impedance

2.2. Maxwell-Wagner Relaxations
The β-dispersion in biological matter is commonly accepted
to be of Maxwell-Wagner type [12, 13, 44, 47, 48]. As shown
by Maxwell and Wagner [10, 11], strong dispersive effects
mimicking those of intrinsic dipolar relaxations can arise in
samples composed of two or more regions with different electrical properties (e.g., plasma, cytoplasma, and cell membranes
in the case of RBCs). It should be noted that this dispersion
can be completely understood from the heterogeneity of the investigated samples without invoking any frequency-dependent
microscopic processes within the involved dielectric materials.
If one of the regions in the sample is of interfacial type and relatively insulating, e.g., an insulating surface layer [65] or the
membranes of biological cells [12, 13], very high apparent values of the dielectric constant are detected at low frequencies.
A straightforward approach for understanding the dielectric behavior of heterogeneous systems is an equivalent-circuit analysis. Here any interfacial layer can be modeled by a parallel
RC element with the resistance R and capacitance C of the interfacial element much higher than the corresponding bulk values [65]. This leads to a relaxation spectrum where the lowfrequency capacitance and conductance are dominated by the
interface. For the calculation of ε′ (ν) from the measured capacitance, usually the overall geometry of the sample is used
instead of that of the thin interfacial layer (i.e., the assumed C0
is much smaller than that of the layer). Thus, an artificially high
dielectric constant is detected at low frequencies. At high frequencies, the interface capacitor becomes shorted and the bulk
properties are detected. This leads to the steplike decrease of
ε′ (ν) and increase of σ′ (ν) with increasing frequency, typical
for relaxational behavior. The increase of σ′ (ν) arises from the
fact that the bulk conductance usually is much higher than the
interface conductance (the cell membrane in the case of RBCs),
the latter being shorted by the interface capacitor at high frequencies.
Instead of an equivalent-circuit analysis [65], for biological
matter it is common practice to treat the β-relaxation analogous
to an intrinsic relaxation process, i.e., to fit it with the Debye

which has to be added to the bulk impedance. RRC and CRC are
the resistance and capacitance of the insulating layers, respectively. From the resulting total impedance, the total capacitance
and conductance (and thus ε′ (ν) and σ′ (ν)) can be calculated
resulting in a behavior equivalent to a Debye-relaxation (this
scenario corresponds to a conventional Maxwell-Wagner relaxation). Alternatively a ”constant phase element”, which is an
empirical impedance function, given by ZCPE = A(iω)−α (refs
82, 83), can be used. When defining τRC = RRCCRC , Eq. 3
formally has the same mathematical structure as Eq. 1. Thus,
in analogy to Eq. 2 a distributed RC-circuit can be introduced
by writing

(4)

We want to emphasize, that in contrast to Eq. 3, which leads to
a frequency dependence identical to that of a Debye relaxation,
an equivalent-circuit evaluation using Eq. 4 does not lead to
fit curves identical to those of a Havriliak-Negami relaxation:
For the latter case, the relaxation time τ in Eq. 1 is assumed to
be distributed. In the equivalent-circuit case, the corresponding
quantity, determining, e.g., the loss peak position, is τ = RbCRC
with Rb the bulk resistance [65]. However, the distributed quantity in the equivalent-circuit case is τRC = RRC CRC , thus leading
to different curve shapes.

2.4. Temperature Dependence
The fitting of relaxation spectra directly provides the relaxation times (τ), the width parameters (α and β), the relaxation
strengths (∆ε), the dielectric constant for ν −→ ∞ (ε∞ ), and
the dc conductivity (σdc ) (see section 2.1). For the temperature
dependence of τ and σdc , thermally activated behavior

can be assumed. σ0 is a prefactor. Eτ and Eσ denote the hindering barriers for the relaxational process and the diffusion of the
charge carriers (i.e., dissolved ions of the plasma in the present
case), respectively. τ0 is an inverse attempt frequency, often assumed to be of the order of a typical phonon frequency. Equation 6, with the extra 1/T term, is derived by considering the
difference of the forward and backward hopping probabilities
of an ion between two sites in a potential that becomes asymmetric due to the external field [84]. Here the field drives the
ionic motion. In contrast, for dielectric relaxations, within the
framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem it is assumed
that the dielectric measurement is sensitive to reorientational
fluctuations, which are present even without field. Thus, τ in
Eq. 5 is proportional to the inverse of the reorientation probability of a molecule experiencing a hindering barrier, which is
just given by the exponential term.
The temperature dependence of the dielectric strength of
dipolar relaxation mechanisms often can be characterized by
the Curie law [85, 86]:

σa τβ (2 + p) − (1 − p)rCm

(11)

An alternative access to σi is provided by the following relation
[58]:
σi =

2σ2a (1 − p) − σa σ∞β (2 + p)
σ∞β (1 − p) − σa (1 + 2p)

(12)

Here σ∞β denotes the high-frequency plateau of the step in
σ′ (ν). Also the dielectric constant of the cytoplasma, εi , can
be determined [58]:
εi =

(7)

2ε2a (1 − p) − εa ε∞β (2 + p)
ε∞β (1 − p) − εa (1 + 2p)

(13)

ε∞β is the limiting high-frequency dielectric constant of the βrelaxation (cf. ε∞ in Eq. 1) and εa is the dielectric constant of
the suspending medium (plasma).
The Pauly-Schwan model includes correction factors for high
concentrations (e.g., the 1 + p/2 factor in eq. 8) and is claimed
to be valid for all values of p (see, e.g., ref. [48]). Another
model, especially developed for highly concentrated suspensions, is the one by Bruggemann [20] and Hanai [59, 62, 63]
taking into account the polarization of particles in the presence
of neighboring ones. The model leads to the equations

2.5. Cell Models
Two commonly employed models for the description of the
β-dispersion of cell suspensions and tissue will be introduced
now and applied to the experimental data in section 4.3.2. Both
models are claimed to be applicable to high cell concentrations
and thus are especially suited for the samples of the present
work. Based on the Maxwell-Wagner model [10, 11], the Pauly
and Schwan takes into account the membranes of cells [58, 48].
Using appropriate approximations (e.g., a negligible membrane
conductance) some simple relations are derived:

one can approximate the conductivity of the cell interior (cytoplasma), σi by

Deviations from the Curie law are usually thought to signify
dipole-dipole interactions.
For most dielectric materials, the broadening of the loss peak
diminishes with increasing temperature, i.e., α → 0 and β → 1
for high temperatures. This finding can be ascribed to the fast
thermal fluctuations, which cause every relaxing entity ”seeing”
the same environment [39], thus leading to an identical relaxation time for each entity, which implies Debye-like behavior.

∆εβ =

Equation 8 allows the calculation of the membrane capacitance per area unit, Cm , from the relaxation strength of the βdispersion, ∆εβ , and the volume fraction p and radius r of the
suspended particles. Via Eq. 9, the conductivity of the suspending medium (plasma in the case of blood), σa , can be determined from the volume fraction and the measured dc conductivity of the suspension, i.e. the limiting low frequency conductivity of the β-dispersion, σdcβ .

be mentioned that this model assumes homogeneous particles

One should note that the exact solution of the dielectric theory of suspensions of ellipsoidal particles leads to the prediction
of six separate relaxation processes, namely two per ellipsoid
axis, arising from the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation of the shell
and of the particle interior [61]. For spheroids, i.e. ellipsoids
with two equal semi-diameters, which may be a good approximation of RBCs, still four relaxations are expected. Usually in
the application of the Maxwell-Wagner model to cell suspensions, including the above treated models, various reasonable
approximations are made (e.g., that the membrane thickness is
much smaller than the cell radius) that lead to the prediction of
a single relaxation only.

with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). The influence of
different coagulation inhibitors on the dielectric properties were
tested and found to be insignificant. Besides the whole blood,
which was measured as taken from the body, four other samples
with different hematocrit values (Hct) were prepared. Hct is
given by the ratio of volume fraction of the corpuscles (erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes) of the blood and the total
volume. The whole blood used in the present work was found to
have Hct = 0.39. After centrifugation of the whole blood, the
corpuscular parts could be separated from the plasma by pipetting. By remixing with the plasma obtained in this way, four
additional samples were prepared: plasma (Hct < 5) and blood
with Hct = 0.23, 0.57, and 0.86. The exact Hct values were determined by taking hemograms with a Beckman-Coulter Hematology Analyzer at the hospital. For each measurement run with
the different devices fresh blood samples were used.
One may suspect that sedimentation of RBCs and other cells
during the temperature-dependent measurement runs could influence the measurements. Covering the whole investigated
temperature range with the different measurement devices did
take about 2-3 hour only. In the high-frequency measurements with the ”open-end” coaxial technique, where relatively
large amounts of material (about 25 ml) held in transparent test
tubes were used, visible inspection revealed no indications of
sedimentation even after much longer time. Nevertheless the
sample material was thoroughly stirred before each frequency
sweep at the different temperatures. The results did well match
those at lower frequencies, where small sample amounts of
about 0.01 ml contained in a platinum capacitor were used.
With this capacitor, up to three separate temperature-dependent
measurement runs were performed, using different devices and
partly using different thermal histories. All the results did
match very well. Finally, the measurements usually were done
by first cooling the sample from room temperature and subsequently heating it up to the highest temperatures. The results
from the cooling and heating runs, which were done at differently aged samples, did always agree within experimental resolution.
The integrity of the erythrocytes was retained during most of
the dielectric measurements, which was checked by a comparison of the room temperature results before and after cooling or
heating. However, as expected this was no longer the case when
the samples were subjected to the highest temperatures investigated, extending up to 330 K. Therefore these measurements
were performed at the end of each temperature-dependent measurement run.
If not otherwise indicated, the experimental data points
shown in the plots of the present work have errors that are not
exceeding the size of the symbols.

3. Materials and methods
To determine the complex dielectric permittivity and conductivity in a broad frequency range (from 1 Hz to 40 GHz),
different measurement techniques were combined [87]. In the
frequency range 1 Hz - 10 MHz, high precision measurements
were performed by means of a Novocontrol Alpha-A Analyzer.
This frequency response analyzer directly measures the sample voltage and the sample current by the use of lock-in technique. The ac voltage is applied to a parallel-plate capacitor made of platinum containing the sample material (diameter 5 mm, plate distance 0.6 mm). In our earlier measurements
of various materials, platinum was found to minimize contributions from dissolved ionic impurities arising from the electrode material. The capacitor is mounted into a N2 -gas cryostat (Novocontrol Quatro) for temperature-dependent measurements. For the measurements in the frequency range 1 MHz 3 GHz a coaxial reflection method was used employing the Agilent Impedance/Material Analyzer E4991A. Here the sample,
again placed in the same parallel-plate capacitor, is connected
to the end of a specially designed coaxial line, thereby bridging inner and outer conductor [88]. For additional measurements between 40 Hz-110 MHz, the autobalance bridge Agilent 4294A was used. Its measurement range overlaps with that
of the other devices. In all the measurements described above,
the applied ac voltage was 0.1 V. The Agilent ”Dielectric Probe
Kit” 85070E using the so called ”performance probe” with an
E8363B PNA Series Network Analyzer covered the high frequency range from 100 MHz to 40 GHz. It uses a so-called
open-end coaxial reflection technique, where the end of a coaxial line is immersed into the sample liquid. The applied ac voltage was 32 mV. Calibration was performed with the standards
Open, Short, and Water. As any contributions from parasitic
elements are excluded by this technique, the obtained absolute
values were used to correct the results obtained with the lowfrequency techniques, discussed above, for contributions from
stray capacitance.
Blood samples from a healthy person were taken at the hospital ”Klinikum Augsburg”. All blood samples were taken from
the same person and various vital parameters of the blood samples were checked. All samples were taken before a meal, at
the same time of the day. We did not find any significant difference in the measurement results obtained on samples taken
at different days. To avoid clotting, the samples were prepared

up, the well-known β-dispersion, located at about 1 - 100 MHz
in ε′ (ν). It is caused by the Maxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the heterogeneity of the solute/cell system (see section
2.2). It is evidenced by a steplike decrease in the dielectric constant at about 1 - 100 MHz, an s-shaped bend in the decrease of
the dielectric loss around 1 MHz, and a steplike increase in the
conductivity around 1 MHz. Comparing the different samples,
it becomes evident that the absolute values of ε′ (ν), ε′′ (ν), and
σ′ (ν) decrease with increasing hematocrit value over almost the
whole frequency range. A detailed analysis of the β-dispersion
will be provided in section 4.3. The δ-dispersion, which is supposed to be located in the frequency range between the β- and
γ-relaxation cannot be detected on this scale and will be treated
in section 4.5 below.
In the present work the complete broadband spectra are
fitted by combining several relaxational dispersions and the
electrode-polarization contribution. In addition, the dc conductivity has to be included in the fitting routine, since the blood
plasma contains free ions that contribute to the conductivity.
The lines shown in Fig. 1 are fits with the sum of two relaxational dispersions described by Eq. 2 (with β = 1) and the
dc-conductivity, which are assumed to be connected in series
to the electrode impedance given by Eq. 4 (with β = 1). The
fits were simultaneously performed for real and imaginary part
of the permittivity. A qualitative inspection of Fig. 1 reveals
that an excellent match of the experimental spectra could be
achieved in this way, which also is the case for the other temperatures investigated. In the following sections, we discuss
the different contributions to the spectra and the resulting relevant fit parameters in detail. To serve for SAR calculations and
medical purposes, the fit curves for all temperatures and hematocrit values investigated in the present work are provided in
electronic form.

circuit to account for the electrodes and, for samples with Hct ≥ 0.23, two
Cole-Cole functions for the β- and γ-relaxation. For the plasma data, a single
Cole-Cole function was used instead.

4.2. Electrode polarization and α-Dispersion
To examine the contributions from electrode polarization to
the spectra in more detail, as an example in Fig. 2 the spectra
of whole blood at 310 K are shown in the low frequency range,
1 Hz - 200 kHz. As demonstrated by the dash-dotted magenta
line, the observed relaxationlike feature cannot be satisfactorily
fitted by assuming a simple RC equivalent circuit (Eq. 3) in series to the bulk sample, which leads to a symmetric loss peak
just like an intrinsic Debye relaxation (see section 2.3). The deviations are strongest in ε′′ below the peak frequency, where the
measured ε′′ (ν) obviously varies far too weakly with frequency
to be describable by the strongly increasing fit curve. Using a
Debye relaxation function (Eq. 1) with an additional conductivity contribution σ′dc , which leads to a minimum in ε′′ (ν) below
the peak frequency, also cannot account for the experimental
data (dotted blue line). Replacing the Debye by a Cole-Cole
function (Eq. 2 with β = 1; green line) only leads to a marginal
improvement of the fits. Instead, a distributed RC equivalent
circuit as described by Eq. 4 with β = 1 but α , 0 (Cole-Cole
case) was found to provide very accurate fits of the measured
spectra (solid red line). The same can be said for the other
blood samples with different hematocrit values investigated in
the present work. A constant phase element in series with the

The dielectric constant of the blood plasma (Fig. 1(a), orange circles) reveals a low-frequency plateau between 1 and
100 Hz, followed by a steplike decrease towards higher frequencies that passes into another plateau between about 1 MHz
and 10 GHz. The behavior below about 1 MHz can be ascribed to electrode polarization (see section 4.2 for a detailed
discussion). At frequencies beyond about 1 GHz a further decrease of ε′ (ν) indicates the beginning γ-dispersion arising from
the reorientational motion of the water molecules (see section
4.4). ε′′ (ν) shows a plateau at low frequencies, followed by a
strong decrease above about 300 Hz and the γ-relaxation peak
at ca. 20 GHz. Accordingly, the conductivity σ′ (ν) exhibits a
strong increase at low frequencies, followed by a plateau between 1 kHz and 1 GHz. At ν > 1 GHz another strong increase
at the end of the measured spectrum shows up, again corresponding to the γ-relaxation.
Just as the plasma, the dielectric spectra of the other samples
also show a γ-relaxation and a electrode-polarization contribution, the latter leading to a strong increase of ε′ (ν) below about
10 - 100 kHz and decrease of σ′ (ν) below about 1 - 10 kHz.
However, between these two features, a further process shows

the distributed RC circuit instead because its parameters seem
to have more physical signification than those of the constant

Figure 2: ε′ (ν) (a), ε′′ (ν) (b), and σ′ (ν) (c) of whole blood (Hct = 0.39) at
310 K and low frequencies (circles). The lines are fits using different functions:
RC equivalent circuit (Eq. 3; dash dotted magenta line), distributed RC equivalent circuit (Eq. 4; red line), Debye function with additional dc-conductivity
contribution (dotted blue line), Cole-Cole function, also with dc contribution
(green line), and constant phase element (black dashed line).

The fits reveal a width parameter α close to 0.15 and nearly
independent of temperature and hematocrit value (not shown),
except for Hct = 0.86, where α ≈ 0.20 is found, slightly increasing with temperature. α characterizes the distribution of
relaxation times of the RC equivalent circuit that describes the
electrode polarization (see section 2.3). The deviations from
Debye behavior may be explained, e.g., by the surface roughness of the electrodes [89, 90, 91]. The fits reveal electrode
capacitances CRC of the order of 10 µF. CRC is found to be only
weakly temperature dependent and it shows a tendency to decrease with increasing hematocrit value. This can be ascribed to
the mentioned reduction of the ionic mobility leading to a less
effective formation of the insulating electrode layers. The fits
do not reveal reliable information on the electrode resistance as
no clear low-frequency plateau in σ′ (ν) is seen (cf. Fig. 1 and
Fig. 3).
From the presented results, it is clear that the electrode polarization is the dominant effect in the low frequency spectrum
of blood. The equivalent-circuit description in terms of a distributed RC circuit provides nearly perfect fits of the experimental data. The typical deviations between fit and measured
data are around 10% or less, which is negligible compared to
the many decades the dielectric quantities vary with frequency.

Good fits with this approach can also be achieved for the results obtained at different temperatures. As an example, Fig. 3
shows the dielectric quantities of whole blood in the frequency
range, dominated by electrode polarization, for selected temperatures. The lines represent the fits of the complete broadband spectra (cf. Fig. 1) where a distributed RC circuit, Eq. 4,
was used for the description of the low-frequency data. In all
cases the agreement of fits and experimental curves are excellent. The onset of the electrode effects, i.e. the increase of ε′
and the decrease of σ′ when lowering the frequency, is found
to shift to lower frequencies with decreasing temperature. This
can be ascribed to the reduced mobility of the ionic charge carriers at low temperatures, which thus arrive at the electrodes for
smaller frequencies only. As revealed by Fig. 1, for increasing hematocrit value the onset of the electrode effects shifts to
lower frequencies, too. This is in accord with the well-known
increase of the viscosity of blood with increasing hematocrit
7

Thus the presence of an additional contribution from a possible
α-relaxation seems unlikely but due to the mentioned deviations, a weak α-relaxation cannot be fully excluded. However,
it should be noted that in earlier investigations also no indications for an α-relaxation in blood were found [28].

4.3. β-Dispersion
4.3.1. Phenomenological Evaluation
Figure 4 shows the spectra of whole blood in the frequency
range of the β-dispersion (10 kHz to 200 MHz) at different temperatures. Except for the plasma, not containing any RBC’s
that would cause a β-process, all samples show a similar relaxational behavior and temperature dependence in this frequency
regime (see Fig. 1). Just as for intrinsic relaxations, the permittivity curves in the β-dispersion regime shift to higher frequencies with increasing temperature. The lines in Fig. 4 again
represent the fits of the complete broadband spectra (cf. Fig.
1) using a Cole-Cole function (Eq. 2 with β = 1) for the βrelaxation. As discussed in detail in section 2.2, the β-relaxation
is generated by the heterogeneity of the sample material, which
is composed of plasma and RBC’s. ε′ (ν) exhibits the typical
steplike decrease with increasing frequency (Fig. 4(a)). Its
additional increase towards the lowest frequencies observed in
Fig. 4(a) corresponds to the onset of the electrode-polarization
effects (cf. Fig. 3), well taken into account in the fits by the
distributed RC equivalent circuit (see section 4.2). In ε′′ (ν) a
loss peak is expected but only its high-frequency flank can be
seen (Fig. 4(b)). Its low-frequency part is superimposed by
the strong ionic dc conductivity, which leads to a contribution
ε′′dc = σdc /(ε0 ω). Thus, instead of a loss peak, only a slight
shoulder at about 3 MHz is revealed.
The dc conductivity also leads to the low-frequency plateau
in σ′ (ν) (Fig. 4(c)) while the shoulders observed around 3 MHz
arise from the relaxation. Via the relation σ′ = ε0 ε′′ ω,
the nearly Debye-like behavior of the β-relaxation (implying
ε′′ (ν) ∼ ν−1 on the high frequency side of the peaks) leads to
the nearly frequency independent σ′ (ν) at ν > 10 MHz. The
low- and high-frequency plateaus of σ′ are labeled as σdcβ and
σ∞β , respectively. The steplike increase of σ′ (ν) from σdcβ to
σ∞β can be qualitatively understood assuming a shorting of the
cell membrane capacitances at high frequencies. Thus, at high
frequencies the RBC’s no longer obstruct the current path and
an enhanced conductivity is detected. Therefore σ∞β can be regarded as good approximation of the intrinsic conductivity of
the plasma, denoted as σa in section 2.5 (in fact it is a mixture
of plasma and cytoplasma conductivity, which we here assume
to be of not too different magnitude). This is nicely corroborated by the approximate agreement of this plateau value with
the conductivity of the pure plasma as seen in Fig. 1(c) for all
Hct values (the small deviations for higher Hct values are due
to the larger volume fraction of cytoplasma having somewhat
lower conductivity; see section 4.3.2). The absolute values of
both conductivity plateaus revealed in Fig. 4(c) increase with
increasing temperature, mirroring the thermally activated ionic
charge transport in the plasma.
As mentioned above, the best fitting results of the βrelaxation were achieved by using a Cole-Cole function. Only

Figure 4: ε′ (ν) (a), ε′′ (ν) (b), and σ′ (ν) (c) of whole blood (Hct = 0.39) in the
β-dispersion region for selected temperatures. The lines represent fit curves as
in Fig. 1 using the Cole-Cole function for the description of the β-relaxation.

for the highest hematocrit values, significant deviations of fits
and experimental data were observed, which will be treated in
section 4.5. The temperature dependence of the width parameter αβ , the relaxation strength ∆εβ , and the relaxation time τβ
obtained from the fits are shown in Fig. 5. The present fitting
of the complete broadband spectra, including the contributions
from electrode polarization and the γ-relaxation, minimizes the
influence of any additional processes on the obtained fit parameters.
The width parameter α (Fig. 5(a)), which for intrinsic relaxations usually is assumed to arise from a distribution of relaxation times [67, 68], is almost temperature independent. As
α assumes rather small values between 0.07 and 0.11, the β
process shows nearly Debye-like behavior. The width parameter increases with increasing RBC content, i.e., the deviations
from the Debye case become stronger. According to the PaulySchwan model (see section 2.5, Eq. 10) the relaxation time τβ
depends on the conductivity outside (σa ) and inside of the cell
(σi ) and on the membrane capacitance (Cm ). It is unlikely that
the cell parameters σi or Cm should be influenced by the hematocrit value and thus a distribution of the outer plasma conductivity seems the most likely cause of the non-Debye behavior.
But also an alternative explanation seems possible: α , 0 implies a shallower high-frequency flank of the β-peak. This flank
is essentially determined by the intrinsic plasma conductivity
8

the highest RBC content (black triangles in Fig. 5(b)) remains
unaffected. Possibly, cell-cell interactions prevent hemolysis at
high Hct.
Figure 5(b) also reveals a decrease of the relaxation strength
with increasing content of erythrocytes. This is a rather surprising result and cannot be explained within the proposed theories. Especially, it contradicts the increase of ∆εβ with p predicted by Eq. 8. In literature, suspensions of erythrocytes and
other cells using non-plasma solvents, like phosphate buffered
saline, quite generally show a continuous increase of ∆εβ with
Hct [50, 57, 96, 97, 98]. However, blood samples (i.e. with the
suspending medium being plasma) can show more complex behavior, especially for higher Hct values [56, 99] and as shown in
ref 54, substitution of plasma by some other solute can strongly
influence ∆εβ . In the framework of a simple equivalent-circuit
picture, ∆εβ is determined by a complex superposition of the
membrane capacitances of all RBCs. Increasing the number of
RBCs could lead to an increase or decrease of ∆εβ depending on
whether parallel or series connections of the cell capacitances
(relative to the field direction) are prevailing. The latter seems
to be the case in our blood samples. The reason is unclear but
cell aggregation as, e.g., rouleaux formation may play a role
here [54, 99, 100, 101].
According to Eq. 10, the β-relaxation time should depend on
σi , σa , and Cm . It was shown above that the membrane capacitance is nearly temperature independent. Thus, the conductivities should dominate the temperature dependence of τβ . Indeed
the Arrhenius representation of Fig. 5(c) reveals that τβ (T ) is
in accord with the expected thermally activated behavior, typical for ionic conductivity. The hindering barriers Eτ , calculated from the slopes in Fig. 5(c) (cf. Eq. 5), seem to slightly
increase with growing Hct and barriers varying between 0.11
and 0.15 eV were obtained. However, due to the rather small
temperature region that could be covered in these biological
samples (compared, e.g., to supercooled liquids [39, 40]), the
significance of these values should not be overemphasized. In
addition, Fig. 5(c) reveals a decrease of the relaxation times
with increasing hematocrit value. In principle, such a behavior
seems to be consistent with Eq. 10 but the observed variation by
about a factor of three is stronger than expected. However, one
should be aware that the relaxation time is directly proportional
to Cm (Eq. 10) while Cm itself is proportional to ∆εβ (Eq. 8).
Thus it is clear that the observed rather strong Hct-dependent
variation of τβ is directly connected to that of ∆εβ revealed by
Fig. 5(b).
To compare the results on the β-relaxation parameters presented above with earlier publications only partly is possible,
because (to the best knowledge of the authors) no such systematic (temperature and hematocrit dependent) and broadband
research on human blood has been done before. Moreover,
the available literature values deviate quite strongly from each
other. For various erythrocyte suspensions, the reported values
of the relaxation time τβ are, for example, 254 ns (Hct = 0.07,
room temperature) [50], 29 ns (Hct = 0.30, T = 298 K) [102],
or 230 ns (Hct = 0.47, T = 310 K) [52, 103]. In blood the
following values were found: τβ = 133 ns (sheep blood, T =
310 K) [46], τβ = 89 − 65 ns (human blood, T = 288 − 308 K,

and corresponds to the high-frequency plateaus seen in Fig.
4(c). Thus α , 0 implies an increase of σ′ (ν) with frequency,
which is typical for hopping conductivity as commonly found
for ionic charge transport [92, 93, 94, 95]. Finally, it has to be
mentioned that additional relaxations arising from the other cell
types in blood could also influence the observed β-relaxation.
As RBCs are by far the dominating cell species (e.g., volume
fraction about 45% vs. ∼ 1% of white blood cells), these contributions can be expected to be small. Nevertheless, it cannot
be excluded that they may contribute to the observed deviations
from Debye behavior.
As revealed by Fig. 5(b), the relaxation strength of the βrelaxation is nearly temperature independent. Thus, according
to Eq. 8, the membrane capacity also can be assumed to be temperature independent. The strong drop of ∆εβ at T > 320 K, observed for all samples except for Hct = 0.86, is most likely due
to the hemolysis of the RBC’s at high temperatures. This assumption is supported by the fact that no such deviations can be
found for the γ-relaxation (see section 4.4), which is independent of the RBC’s. However, it is not clear why the sample with

Hct = 0.43) [25], and τβ = 53.1 ns (bovine blood, room temperature, Hct = 0.50) [13]. The values in the present work
vary between 35.9 ns (Hct = 0.86, T = 330 K) and 274.1 ns
(Hct = 0.23, T = 280 K). The literature results for the relaxation strength also show rather strong variation. In ref 52,
literature values between 1100 and 5000 were reported. Fricke
found, dependent on Hct, εs ≈ ∆ε = 900 − 4000 for dog, rabbit,
and sheep blood [96]. For human blood, Pfützner published values between approximately 2000 and 6000 (Hct = 0.10 − 0.90)
[99]. In the present work we have obtained ∆ε ≈ 3300 − 13800
(for Hct = 0.86, T = 330 K and Hct = 0.23, T = 320 K, respectively). Even less data are available for the width parameter
αβ , because often other fitting functions were used. But mostly
they are around 0.1 [46, 52, 104], similar to the values in the
present work.

Via Eq. 11, the conductivity of the cell interior σi can be
calculated from σa , Cm , and the measured β-relaxation times.
However, as Cm determined from Eq. 8 shows an unphysical Hct dependence (Table 1), also an unreasonable Hct dependence of σa would result. An alternative determination of
σi is provided by Eq. 12. Using the experimentally determined σa and σ∞β at 310 K we arrive at the values for σi
listed in Table 1. Literature results are distributed around 0.6 ×
10−2 (±0.1) Ω−1 cm−1 [41, 42, 54, 56, 57, 98, 105, 106, 107].
Deviating results were reported by Cook [24, 25] (ca. 1.0 ×
10−2 Ω−1 cm−1 ) and Asami [108] (ca. 0.32 × 10−2 Ω−1 cm−1 ).
Our values for σi are by about a factor 2-3 smaller than the
measured conductivity of the plasma, σa ≈ 1.7×10−2 Ω−1 cm−1 .
It seems reasonable that the conductivity of the cytoplasma
should be lowered by the presence of the large hemoglobin
molecules and their bound water shells within the RBCs (about
37% volume fraction [41]), if compared to the conductivity of
the outer plasma (see following discussion of Fig. 6 for a quantitative treatment). Indeed such behavior was found previously
[42, 54, 56]. The reported ratios between about 1.5 and 2.7
are consistent with our findings. Obviously, Eq. 12 is able to
provide reasonable estimates for σi . It is based on the determination of σ∞β , which is read off at high frequencies, where
the cell membranes are shorted and thus cell aggregation has no
effect on the results.

4.3.2. Application of Cell Models
As mentioned in section 2.5, by using appropriate models it
should be possible to determine intrinsic cell parameters as the
membrane capacitance or the conductivity of the cytoplasma
from the parameters of the β-relaxation. Using the fitting parameter ∆εβ and Eq. 8, the membrane capacitance Cm can be
calculated. As discussed in the previous section, the experimentally determined dielectric strength decreases with increasing Hct, in contrast to the increase predicted by Eq. 8. The
use of Eq. 8 therefore would imply a strongly Hct-dependent
membrane capacitance (see Table 1 for the results at 310 K).
This can hardly be interpreted in a physical way. Literature
values vary between 0.17 µF/cm2 (ref 102) and 3 µF/cm2 (ref
54). However, most authors assume a membrane capacity of
about 1 µF/cm2 [52, 96, 97, 105, 106], whereas some report
Hct-dependent membrane capacities [51, 56]. Possible reasons
for the unexpected behavior of ∆εβ (Hct) and thus of Cm (Hct)
were discussed in the previous section. It seems that Eq. 8 is
not able to account for the observations in ”real” blood samples,
in contrast to suspensions of erythrocytes in common solvents.

Using Eq. 9 should allow for the calculation of the conductivity of the suspending medium σa from the dc conductivity
σdcβ of the blood samples. σa also can be directly determined
from the dc conductivity of the plasma, measured in the present
work (1.7 × 10−2 Ω−1 cm−1 at 310 K). The calculated values are
provided in Table 1. While being nearly Hct-independent as
expected, they differ from the directly measured value by a factor of about two. Again cell aggregation causing a lowering of
the experimentally observed σdcβ may explain this finding.

Figure 6: Temperature dependent conductivity (Arrhenius plot) (a) and dielectric constant (b) of the cell interior calculated from Eqs. 12 and 13, respectively. For comparison, in (a) also data for pure plasma are provided. The solid
line in (a) indicates approximately linear behavior implying thermally activated
charge transport (Eq. 6). The dashed line shows an approximate description of
the blood data (except for Hct = 0.39) using the same energy barrier as for the
plasma.

In Fig. 6(a) the temperature dependence of σi is shown in
10

the fits of the spectra of pure plasma (see Fig. 1 for 310 K). This
difference is reasonable because the main contribution to the ε′
of the plasma arises from the highly dipolar water molecules
(εs of water ≈ 74 at 310 K (ref 109)) and the additional constituents of the cytoplasma (mainly hemoglobin) should lower
its permittivity. In literature, εi values ranging around 40-70
were reported [41, 106, 107, 108]. The calculation of εi by Eq.
13 should provide the same results for each hematocrit value.
However, as revealed by Table 1 and Fig. 6(b), the calculated
εi increases by about 20% with increasing Hct, pointing out the
limits of the model. Similar behavior was also reported in ref
107. The decrease of εi with increasing temperature revealed
by Fig. 6(b) is consistent with Curie behavior (Eq. 7) expected
for the dielectric strength (and thus approximately also for the
static dielectric constant) of dipolar materials. Here one should
be aware that εi represents the static dielectric constant of a γlike relaxation of the cell interior that will take place at higher
frequencies and in fact this relaxation contributes to the actually observed γ-relaxation of blood (see section 4.4). The uncertainty of the data in Fig. 6(b) is too large to allow for a quantitative evaluation in terms of Eq. 7. Overall, Eq. 13 seems to
lead to reasonable values of the dielectric constant of the cytoplasma. It is based on the determination of the plasma dielectric
constant (experimentally determined) and ε∞β , which is not influenced by possible cell aggregation effects.
An alternative determination of the dielectric properties of
the RBCs is provided by the Hanai-Bruggemann model, Eqs.
14 and 15, which was especially proposed for highly concentrated suspensions. From Eq. 15 the cell conductivity was
calculated, leading, however, to negative values. Using Eq.
14, the dielectric constant εp of the cell is found to vary between 34 (Hct = 0.57) and 42 (Hct = 0.39) at room temperature. Those values are slightly smaller than the ones calculated
from the Pauly-Schwan theory. This is a reasonable result since
the Hanai-Bruggemann model does not account for the shelled
structure of the cells and thus the obtained values represent the
average of cell membrane and interior. The dielectric constant
of the membrane can be expected to be much lower than that of
the cytoplasma (in contrast to its capacitance, which is high due
to its small thickness), which leads to the reduced values of the
total dielectric constant.

the Arrhenius type of presentation (log(σi T ) vs 1000/T ) commonly used for ionic conductivity (cf Eq. 6). For comparison,
also the dc conductivity determined from fits of the spectra of
pure blood plasma (cf. Fig. 1) is included. In the determination of σi (T ) via Eq. 12, for σa the plasma dc conductivity
was used and σ∞β was calculated from the fit parameters of the
β-relaxation shown in Fig. 5. As the β-relaxation shows slight
deviations from Debye behavior, σ′ (ν) exhibits a slight increase
in the region of its high-frequency plateau (see, e.g., Fig. 4(c)).
As an estimate of σ∞β , we used the value of σ′ (ν) at a frequency
1.5 decades above the peak frequency. Except for whole blood,
the temperature dependence of σi is nearly independent of Hct
and seems to follow thermally activated behavior (dashed line
in Fig. 6(a)). The deviations at the two highest temperatures
are directly related to similar problems in the β-relaxation parameters (Fig. 5). As discussed in section 4.3, this may arise
from an onset of hemolysis of the RBCs. Interestingly, the energy barrier of 0.17 eV, deduced from the slope of the linear fit
curve of the plasma data (solid line) is in good accord with the
results on the blood samples (dashed line). Nevertheless, the
absolute values of the conductivity of the cytoplasma are about
a factor of 2-3 lower than those of the plasma. As mentioned in
the previous paragraph, this can be explained by the presence
of the hemoglobin molecules within the cell. For a quantitative
estimate one can use Maxwell’s mixture equation for the effective conductivity σeff of a suspension of particles with volume
concentration p [10]:
σp − σs
σeff − σs
=p
σeff + 2σs
σp + 2σs

(16)

Here σs and σp are the conductivity of the solute and the particle, respectively. If we regard the hemoglobin molecules as
insulating particles (i.e., σp = 0) suspended in plasma with the
same conductivity as the extracellular plasma, we arrive at the
following ratio of solute conductivity (σs = σa ) and effective
conductivity (σeff = σi ) [41]:
σa 1 + p/2
=
σi
1− p

(17)

Using p = 0.37 (ref 41), a ratio of about two is obtained, which
is in quite reasonable agreement with the findings of Fig. 6(a).
The energy barrier of 0.17 eV for charge transport within the
intra- and extracellular plasma is of the same order of magnitude as the one deduced from τβ (T ) (0.11 - 0.15 eV, see previous
section). This seems reasonable as the temperature dependence
of τβ should be mainly governed by the conductivity of inner
and outer plasma (Eq. 10). In any case one should bear in mind
that the absolute values of the energy barriers have rather high
uncertainty due to the restricted temperature range.
The dielectric constant of the cell interior εi was calculated
using Eq. 13. The results for 310 K are listed in Table 1 and the
temperature dependence is shown in Fig. 6(b). One should be
aware that εi is the dielectric constant at frequencies below the
onset of the γ-relaxation. As expected, the obtained values are
smaller than the dielectric constant of the suspending medium
(εa ≈ 73 - 67 for T = 290 - 310 K, respectively), deduced from

4.4. γ-Dispersion
The dielectric spectra of bulk water exhibit a strong relaxation feature near 18 GHz (at room temperature) [110], which
is also observed in electrolytic solutions [111]. It is commonly
ascribed to the reorientational dynamics of the dipolar water
molecules (but also alternative scenarios are discussed; see,
e.g., ref 112) and denoted as α-relaxation within the nomenclature of dipolar liquids and glass formers. The same relaxational
process also arises from the free water molecules in blood samples. Figure 7 shows real and imaginary part of the permittivity
(a, b) and the real part of the conductivity (c) of whole blood in
the frequency range 1 to 40 GHz at different temperatures. The
lines represent fits of the broadband spectra as shown in Fig. 1,
using a Cole-Cole function for the γ-relaxation. In ε′ (ν) (Fig.
7(a)), the onset of the typical relaxation steps is seen but their

εs (T )) [109]. The solid lines in (b) are fits with a Curie-law, Eq. 7. The line

.

high frequency plateaus, ε∞γ , are located beyond the investigated frequency range. Thus, exact values for ε∞γ could not be
determined and in the fitting procedure a lower limit of 2.5 was
used leading to values between 2.5 and 6. The low-frequency
plateau εsγ of the γ-dispersion decreases with increasing temperature. The relaxation steps and loss peaks (Fig. 7(b)) show a
strong temperature-dependent frequency shift due to the slowing down of the molecular dynamics with decreasing temperature. We find the Cole-Cole formula (Eq. 2 with β = 1) to provide the best fits of the γ-relaxation. Figure 7(c) shows the conductivity spectra with the corresponding rise and the onset of
the high frequency plateau. The low-frequency plateau of σ′ (ν)
corresponds to the combined conductivity of plasma and cytoplasma as discussed in section 4.3.2. The γ-dispersion shows
similar behavior for the other investigated samples.

be explained by the growing thermal fluctuations of the environment of the water dipoles. At very high temperatures, each
dipole ”sees” the time average of the quickly fluctuating environment, which is the same for every dipole, leading to Debye
behavior [39].
The hematocrit dependence of the relaxation strength (Fig.
8(b)) shows the expected tendency: Increasing Hct values cause
a decrease of the volume fraction of plasma and thus of water in the sample, causing the reduction of the γ-relaxation
strength. The temperature dependence of ∆εγ can be well parameterized by a Curie-law, Eq. 7, (solid lines) with some deviations for Hct = 0.23 only. The obtained Curie constant, C,
increases smoothly from 13400 to 19800 with decreasing Hct.
The dashed line in Fig. 8(b) corresponds to ∆ε(T ) of pure water, calculated from the I.U.P.A.C. (International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemistry) standard values for the static permittivity εs of bulk water [109] (see also [114]) via ∆ε = εs − ε∞
assuming ε∞ = 4 [115, 116]. The relaxation strength of water
matches the general trend revealed by the other curves in Fig.

The fitting parameters of the γ-relaxation, αγ , ∆εγ , and τγ ,
are provided in Fig. 8. The width parameter (a) shows a tendency to increase with increasing Hct. This seems reasonable
as a higher number of RBC’s should lead to stronger disorder
in the system and therefore the distribution of relaxation times
should broaden. The observed decline of αγ with increasing
temperature, corresponding to an approach of Debye behavior,
is a common phenomenon in dipolar liquids [39, 113]. It can
12

8(b). However, obviously it shows a somewhat stronger temperature dependence. This may indicate weaker interactions
between the water molecules in blood than in pure water, which
can be rationalized by the presence of the other constituents of
blood (e.g., proteins or salt ions).
Figure 8(c) shows the temperature dependence of the relaxation times τγ in an Arrhenius plot. The observed linear increase is in accord with thermally activated behavior, Eq. 5.
As an example, a linear fit of the data at Hct = 0.39 is shown
(solid line). From its slope an energy barrier of 0.19 eV is obtained. There seems to be a slight increase of energy barriers
with growing Hct value (from 0.18 to 0.20 eV). However, this
variation is too small to be considered significant, especially
when taking into account the rather small temperature range
that could be investigated in the present experiments due to
the restricted robustness of blood to stronger temperature variations. The present results agree reasonably with those reported
by Cook [24] who found values for τγ of whole blood varying
between 11.9 and 7.0 ps at three temperatures between 298 and
308 K. Gabriel et al.[46] reported 8.4 ps at 310 K, about 30%
higher than our result of 6.5 ps. The dashed line in Fig. 8(c)
represents τ(T ) of pure water as measured by Kaatze [110].
Obviously the γ-relaxations in the investigated blood samples
exhibit nearly identical dynamics as the main relaxation of pure
water. Water shows some small deviations from Arrhenius behavior, which seem to be absent in blood but these differences
are of limited significance. However, one may speculate that
the non-Arrhenius behavior of water arises from increasing cooperativity of the molecular motions at low temperatures as often invoked to explain corresponding findings in glass forming
liquids [117, 118]. In blood, its other constituents can be expected to lead to a reduction of the direct interactions between
the water molecules and thus to less cooperativity. In addition,
there are speculations of a first-order phase transition in supercooled water [119], which may lead to critical power-law behavior even in the normal liquid state, thus also explaining the
deviation from Arrhenius behavior in Fig. 8(c). Both scenarios are consistent with the different temperature dependence of
∆ε(T ) of water and blood discussed in the previous paragraph.

two Cole-Cole functions for the β-relaxation. The two separate relaxation steps
are indicated by the dashed lines. The inset shows a magnified view of the
high-frequency region.

in Fig. 9(b) additional data extending from 100 kHz to 50 MHz
obtained with a different apparatus (autobalance bridge Agilent
4294A) are shown, which exactly reproduce the two other data
sets. Thus, a fit using the sum of two separate relaxation contributions was performed (solid line in Fig. 9(b)). It provides an
excellent description of the spectrum revealing relaxation times
of 16 ns and 146 ns. A very similar fit using two Cole-Cole
functions was shown by Asami and Yamaguchi [74] to provide
a good description of data on human erythrocyte suspensions.
In blood there are various possibilities for additional relaxational processes, in addition to those considered for the explanation of the α-, β-, and γ-relaxation: (i) the reorientation of protein-bound water molecules, (ii) the hemoglobin βrelaxation (i.e., the tumbling motion of the protein molecules),
(iii) the motion of polar protein subgroups, (iv) the MaxwellWagner relaxation of the cell interior, or (v) the additional
Maxwell-Wagner relaxations due to the non-spherical cell
shape, to name just the most likely ones. Most of them
can be simply excluded based on the very large amplitude of
∆εs ≈ 1000 of the additional relaxation suggested by the fit
shown in Fig. 9(b): (i) Bound water cannot have a larger ∆ε
than free water. (ii) The hemoglobin β-relaxation in aqueous solution was found to have a ∆ε of the order of 100
[12, 13, 33]. It seems unreasonable that it should be higher
in the hemoglobin/cytoplasma solution of the cell interior. (iii)
Polar protein subgroups can be expected to have smaller relaxation strength that the main tumbling relaxation. (iv) In princi-

4.5. Further Dispersions
In section 4.3 it was shown that fits using the Cole-Cole function provide a reasonable description of the β-relaxation region.
However, there are some minor deviations of fits and experimental data especially for the higher hematocrit values. This is
demonstrated in Fig. 9(a) where dielectric-constant data for the
blood samples with the highest and lowest hematocrit values are
shown. In contrast to the 23% sample, the fit of the spectrum
of the highly concentrated sample clearly is of inferior quality.
Similar deviations were previously also observed in Cole-Cole
fits of data on disc-shaped rabbit-erythrocyte suspensions [57].
A close inspection of the spectrum at Hct = 0.86 (Fig. 9(b))
seems to indicate that it may be composed of two separate relaxation steps. However, one could suspect an experimental
artifact because in the β-dispersion region the spectrum is composed of results from two different experimental methods with
the transition close to 10 MHz (see section 3). To exclude this,
13

ple, the capacitance of the cell interior should also be shorted
at high frequencies and, indeed, the Maxwell-Wagner model
of shelled particles predicts a corresponding relaxation [61].
However, for any reasonable choice of parameters this capacitance is too small to lead to any considerable contribution to ε′
and this additional relaxation usually is considered negligible
[12, 13, 33]. Thus, the non-spherical shape of the RBCs seems
to be the most likely cause of the additional relaxation observed
in Fig. 9(b). Already in ref 12 deviations from simple relaxation
behavior of erythrocyte suspensions were ascribed to the nonspherical form of RBCs and also Asami and Yamaguchi [74]
explained their results in this way. As mentioned in section 2.5,
the Maxwell-Wagner model for suspensions of spheroid particles predicts up to four relaxations [61] (two of them arise from
the cell interior and can be neglected). However, the found
relaxation-time ratio of the order of 10 is too high to be explainable by this model, at least if assuming a reasonable ratio
of the two semi-diameters of the spheroids [61, 120]. The spectra on rabbit erythrocytes, mentioned above, also could not be
described by the Maxwell-Wagner model for spheroid particles
[57]. However, one should be aware that RBCs only roughly
can be approximated by spheroids and most likely their biconcave shape plays a role in the found discrepancies.
An additional δ-dispersion between β- and γ-relaxation is
often invoked to explain a slow continuous decrease of ε′ (T ),
observed in the region from several 10 MHz to about 3 GHz
in various biological materials, including protein solutions
[12, 30, 33, 121, 122] and blood [12]. It has been ascribed
to various mechanisms as the dynamics of protein-bound water
molecules or polar subgroups of proteins. Indeed such a dispersion is also found in our present results on blood and becomes
most pronounced for the high hematocrit values (see inset of
Fig. 9 for an example). However, it can be completely described by the broadband fits promoted in the previous sections
(line in inset), especially if including a second relaxation in the
β-relaxation region as shown in Fig. 9(b). Thus in our blood
samples the apparent dispersion in this region arises from the
superposition of β- and γ-relaxation and we find no evidence for
a δ-relaxation. However, the presence of a small δ-relaxation is
not completely excluded by this finding.

we can satisfactorily describe our low-frequency data without
invoking such a relaxation. This finding agrees with earlier results stating the absence of an α-relaxation in blood [28]. The
analysis of the β-relaxation using standard cell models partly
leads to unreasonable results for the intrinsic dielectric properties. This most likely can be ascribed to cell aggregation playing an important role in ”real” blood samples, in contrast to
suspensions of erythrocytes prepared by standard solutes, often reported in literature. Cell aggregation seems to be important especially for the dielectric behavior at the low-frequency
side of the β-relaxation. In contrast, using only parameters determined at frequencies beyond the β-peak frequency, leads to
reasonable estimates of the conductivity and dielectric constant
of the cell interior. In addition, we find strong hints that the
β-relaxation is in fact composed of two separate relaxation processes, which we ascribe to the marked deviations of the RBCs
from spherical geometry.
We observe clear dispersion effects in the region between the
β- and γ-relaxation, which often is ascribed to a so-called δrelaxation. However, our analysis of the broadband spectra including electrode polarization, β-dispersion, and γ-relaxation
leads to excellent fits in this region, which thus is revealed to
be a superposition of different contributions and not due to a
separate relaxation process. Thus, while there clearly is dispersion in blood between the β- and γ-relaxation, there is no
evidence for a δ-relaxation. Finally, detailed information on the
γ-relaxation in blood is provided. Its properties closely resemble those of the relaxation caused by reorientational molecular
motions in pure water. However, some minor differences arise,
which seem to indicate less cooperative motions of the water
molecules in blood samples.
Overall, the dielectric spectra of blood are of astonishing
simplicity if considering the complexity of blood, being composed of a variety of different constituents. In fact we have
described our broadband spectra without assuming any intrinsic frequency dependence in the complete range from 1 Hz up
to about 1 GHz and only the γ-dispersion arising from the tumbling motion of the water molecules is of intrinsic nature. Of
course, there is the strong β-relaxation, which may be regarded
as quasi-intrinsic but as it is of Maxwell-Wagner type, in a narrower sense it should be considered as artificial. However, of
course for many applications (e.g., the calculation of SAR values) the overall dielectric properties and not only the intrinsic
ones are of essential importance and we hope our work will
serve for these purposes in the future.

5. Summary and Conclusions
In the present work, we have provided dielectric spectra of
human blood for an exceptionally broad frequency range and at
different temperatures and hematocrit values. A combination of
models for the different dispersion regions enabled nearly perfect fits of the broadband spectra. The obtained fit curves represent an excellent estimate of the dielectric properties of blood
for a wide range of parameters. They are provided for electronic
download in the supporting information and can be employed
for SAR calculations and other application purposes. The different dispersion regions have been analyzed in detail. The observed electrode-polarization effects are accounted for by an
equivalent circuit model assuming a distribution of relaxation
times. While our analysis of the low-frequency region cannot
completely rule out the presence of an α-dispersion in blood,
