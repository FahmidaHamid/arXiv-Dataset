Abstract
We analyze an interacting particle system with a Markov evolution of
birth-and-death type. We have shown that a local competition mechanism
(realized via a density dependent mortality) leads to a globally regular
behavior of the population in course of the stochastic evolution.

Introduction

Complex systems theory is a quickly growing interdisciplinary area with a very broad
spectrum of motivations and applications. Having in mind biological applications,
S. Levin (see [26]) characterized complex adaptive systems by such properties as diversity and individuality of components, localized interactions among components, and
the outcomes of interactions used for replication or enhancement of components. In
the study of these systems, proper language and techniques are delivered by the interacting particle models which form a rich and powerful direction in modern stochastic
and infinite dimensional analysis. Interacting particle systems have a wide use as
models in condensed matter physics, chemical kinetics, population biology, ecology
(individual based models), sociology and economics (agent based models).
In this paper we consider an individual based model (IBM) in spatial ecology
introduced by Bolker and Pacala [4, 5], Dieckmann and Law [6] (BDLP model). A
population in this model is represented by a configuration of motionless organisms

(plants) located in an infinite habit (an Euclidean space in our considerations). The
habit is considered to be a continuous space as opposed to discrete spatial lattices
used in the most of mathematical models of interacting particle systems. We need
the infinite habit to avoid boundary effects in the population evolution and the latter
moment is quite similar to the necessity to work in the thermodynamic limit for models
of statistical physics. Let us also mention a recent paper [2] in which a modification
of the BDLP model for the case of moving organisms (e.g., branching diffusion of the
plankton) was considered.
A general IBM in the plant ecology is a stochastic Markov process in the configuration space with events comprising birth and death of the configuration points, i.e.,
we are dealing with a birth-and-death process in the continuum. In the particular case
of the BDLP model, each plant produces seeds independently of others and then these
seeds are distributed in the space accordingly to a dispersion kernel a+ . This part of
the process may be considered as a kind of the spatial branching. In the same time,
the model includes also a mortality mechanism. The mortality intensity consists of
two parts. The first one corresponds to a constant intrinsic mortality value m > 0 s.t.
any plant dies independently of others after a random time (exponentially distributed
with parameter m). The second part in the mortality rate is density dependent. The
latter is expressed in terms of a competition kernel a− which describes an additional
mortality rate for any given point of the configuration coming from the rest of the
population, see Section 3 for the precise description of the model, in particular, (3.6).
The latter formula gives the heuristic form of the Markov generator in the BDLP
model.
Assuming the existence of the corresponding Markov process, we derive in Section
(n)
5 an evolution equation for correlation functions kt , n ≥ 1, of the considered model.
In [4, 5], [6] this system was called the system of spatial moment equations for plant
competition and, actually, this system itself was taking as a definition of the dynamics
in the BDLP model. The mathematical structure of the correlation functions evolution
equation is close to other well-known hierarchical systems in mathematical physics,
e.g., BBGKY hierarchy for the Hamiltonian dynamics (see, e.g. [3]) or the diffusion
hierarchy for the gradient stochastic dynamic in the continuum (see e.g. [21]). As in
all hierarchical chains of equations, we can not expect the explicit form of the solution,
and even more, the existence problem for these equations is a highly delicate question.
There is an approximative approach to produce an information about the behavior
of the solutions to the hierarchical chains. This approach is called the closure procedure
and consists of the following steps. The first step is to cut all correlation functions of
the higher orders and the second one is to subscribe the rest correlation functions by
the properly factorized correlation functions of the lower orders. As result, one obtains
a finite system of non-linear equations instead of the original linear but infinite system
of a hierarchical type. This closure procedure is essentially non-unique, see [7].
The aim of this paper is to study the moment equations for the BDLP model by
methods of functional analysis and analysis on the configuration spaces developed in
[13], [14], [15] and already applied to the non-equilibrium birth-and-death type continuous space stochastic dynamics in [16], [18]. We obtain some rigorous results concerning
the existence and properties of the solution for different classes of initial conditions.
One of the main question we clarify in the paper concerns the role of the competition
mechanism in the regulation of the spatial structure of an evolving population. More
precisely, considering the model without competition, i.e., the case a− ≡ 0, we arrive
in the situation of the so-called continuous contact model [9], [17], [22]. In the ecological framework, this model describes free growth of a plant population with the given

constant mortality. We note that (independently on the value of the mortality m > 0)
the considered contact model exhibits very strong clustering that is reflected in the
bound (3.5) on the correlation functions at any moment of time t > 0. Note that this
effect on the level of the computer simulation was discovered already in [2] and now it
has the rigorous mathematical formulation and clarification. A direct consequence of
the competition in the model is the suppression of such clustering. Namely, assuming
the strong enough competition and the big intrinsic mortality m, we prove the subPoissonian bound for the solution to the moment equations provided such bound was
true for the initial state. Moreover, we clarify specific influences of the constant and
the density dependent mortality intensities separately. More precisely, the big enough
intrinsic mortality m gives a uniform in time bound for each correlation function and
the strong competition results ensure the regular spatial distribution of the typical
configuration for any moment of time that is reflected in the sub-Poissonian bound.
Joint influence of the intrinsic mortality and the competition leads to the existence
of the unique invariant measure for our model which is just Dirac measure concentrated on the empty configuration. The latter means that the corresponding stochastic
evolution of the population is asymptotically exhausting.
We would like to mention also the work [10] in which the BDLP model was studied
in the case of the bounded habit in the stochastic analysis framework. The latter case
differs essentially from the model we consider in the present paper as well as main
problems studied in [10], which are related to the scaling limits for the considered
processes.

We will use the following classes of functions: L0ls (Γ0 ) is the set of all measurable
functions on Γ0 which have a local support, i.e. G ∈ L0ls (Γ0 ) if there exists Λ ∈ Bb (Rd )
such that G ↾Γ0 \ΓΛ = 0; Bbs (Γ0 ) is the set of bounded measurable functions with

These functions are characterized by the following relation: F (γ) = F ↾ΓΛ (γΛ ).
The following mapping between functions on Γ0 , e.g. L0ls (Γ0 ), and functions on Γ,

A measure ρ on Γ0 , B(Γ0 ) is called locally finite iff ρ(A) < ∞ for all bounded sets A

Description of the model

In the present paper we study the special case of the general birth-and-death processes in continuum. The spatial birth-and-death processes describe evolution of configurations in Rd , in which points of configurations (particles, individuals, elements)
randomly appear (born) and disappear (die) in the space. Among all birth-and-death
processes we will distinguish those in which new particles appear only from existing
ones. These processes correspond to the models of the spatial ecology.
The simplest example of such processes is the so-called “free growth” dynamics.
During this stochastic evolution the points of configuration independently create new
ones distributed in the space according to a dispersion probability kernel 0 ≤ a+ ∈
L1 (Rd ) which is an even function. Any existing point has an infinite life time, i. e.
they do not die. Heuristically, the Markov pre-generator of this birth process has the
following form:
XZ
a+ (x − y)Dx+ F (γ)dx,
(L+ F )(γ) = κ +
y∈γ

Rd

where
Dx+ F (γ) = F (γ ∪ x) − F (γ),
and κ + > 0 is some positive constant.
The existence of the process associated with L+ can be shown using the same
technique as in [9], [22]. Let µt be the corresponding evolution of measures in time
(n)
on M1fm (Γ). By kt , n ≥ 0 we denote the dynamics of the corresponding n-th order
correlation functions (provided they exist). Note, that each of such functions describes
the density of the system at the moment t.
Then, using (2.3), for any continuous ϕ on Rd with bounded support, we obtain

(3.1)

One of the possibilities to prevent the density growth of the system is to include
the death mechanism. The simplest one is described by the independent death rate
(mortality) m > 0. This means that any element of a population has an independent
exponentially distributed with parameter m random life time. The independent death
together with the independent creation of new particles by already existing ones describe the so-called contact model in the continuum, see e.g. [22]. The pre-generator
of such model is given by the following expression:
(LCM F )(γ) = m

where
Dx− F (γ) = F (γ \ x) − F (γ).
The Markov process associated with the generator LCM was constructed in [22].
This construction was generalized in [9] for more general classes of functions a+ . Let
us note, that the contact model in the continuum may be used in the epidemiology
to model the infection spreading process. The values of this process represent the
states of the infected population. This is analog of the contact process on a lattice. Of
course, such interpretation is not in the spatial ecology concept. On the other hand,
contact process is a spatial branching process with a given mortality rate.
The dynamics of correlation functions in the contact model was considered in [17].
Namely, taking m = 1 for correctness, we have for any n ≥ 1, t > 0 the correlation

that for any n ≥ 0 and (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ (Rd )n

then for any t ≥ 0 and almost all (a.a.) (x1 , . . . , xn ) ∈ (Rd )n (w.r.t. Lebesgue measure)

(3.4)
Therefore, for κ + < 1 the density will exponentially decrease to 0 (as t → ∞), for
κ + > 1 the density will exponentially increase to ∞, and for κ + = 1 the density will
be a constant. One can easily see from the estimate (3.3) that, in the case κ + < 1,
the correlation functions of all orders decrease to 0 as t → ∞. On the other hand,
(n)
for fixed t, the estimate (3.3) implies factorial bound in n for kt . As result, we may
expect the clustering of our system. To show clustering we start from the Poisson
distribution of particles and obtain an estimate from below for the time evolutions of
correlations between particles in a small region.

As it was mentioned before, the later bound shows the clustering in the contact model.
All previous consideration may be extended for the case m 6= 1: we should only replace
1 by m in the previous calculations.
As a conclusion we have: the presence of mortality (m > κ + ) in the free growth
model prevents the growth of density, i. e. the correlation functions of all orders decay
in time. But it doesn’t influence on the clustering in the system. One of the possibilities
to prevent such clustering is to consider the so-called density dependent death rate.
Namely, let us consider the following pre-generator:

Here 0 ≤ a− ∈ L1 (Rd ) is an arbitrary, even function such that
Z

a− (x)dx = 1

Rd

(in other words, a− is a probability density) and κ − > 0 is some positive constant. It
is easy to see that the operator L is well-defined, for example, on FL0 (Γ).
The generator (3.6) describes the Bolker—Dieckmann—Law—Pacala (BDLP) model,
which was introduced in [4, 5, 6]. During the corresponding stochastic evolution the
birth of individuals occurs independently and the death is ruled not only by the global
regulation (mortality) but also by the local regulation with the kernel κ − a− . This
regulation may be described as a competition (e.g., for resources) between individuals
in the population.
The main result of this article is presented in Section 5, Theorem 5.1. It may be
informally stated in the following way:
If the mortality m and the competition kernel κ − a− are large enough, then the
dynamics of correlation functions associated with the pre-generator (3.6) preserves
(sub-)Poissonian bound for correlation functions for all times.
In particular, it prevents clustering in the model.
In the next sections we explain how to prove this fact. In the last section of the
present paper we discuss the necessity to consider ”large enough” death.

Semigroup for the symbol of the generator

The problem of the construction of the corresponding process in Γ concerns the possibility to construct the semigroup associated with L. This semigroup determines the
solution to the Kolmogorov equation, which formally (only in the sense of action of
operator) has the following form:
˛
dFt
= LFt ,
Ft ˛t=0 = F0 .
(4.1)
dt
To show that L is a generator of a semigroup in some reasonable functional spaces
on Γ seems to be a difficult problem. This difficulty is hidden in the complex structure
of the non-linear infinite dimensional space Γ.
In various applications the evolution of the corresponding correlation functions (or
measures) helps already to understand the behavior of the process and gives candidates
for invariant states. The evolution of correlation functions of the process is related
heuristically to the evolution of states of our IPS. The latter evolution is formally given
as a solution to the dual Kolmogorov equation (Fokker—Planck equation):
dµt
= L∗ µt ,
dt

˛
µt ˛t=0 = µ0 ,

(4.2)

where L∗ is the adjoint operator to L on M1fm (Γ), provided, of course, that it exists.
In the recent paper [16], the authors proposed the analytic approach for the construction of a non-equilibrium process on Γ, which uses deeply the harmonic analysis
technique. In the present paper we follow the scheme proposed in [16] in order to construct the evolution of correlation functions. The existence problem for the evolution
of states in M1fm (Γ) and, as a result, of the corresponding process on Γ is not realized
in this paper. It seems to be a very technical question and remains open.
Following the general scheme, first we should construct the evolution of functions
which corresponds to the symbol (K-image) L̂ = K −1 LK of the operator L in L1 space on Γ0 w.r.t. the weighted Lebesgue—Poisson measure. This weight is crucial
for the corresponding evolution of correlation functions. It determines the growth of
correlation functions in time and space. Below we start the detailed realization of the
discussed scheme.

For the proof see [8].
With the help of Proposition 4.1, we derive the evolution equation for quasiobservables (functions on Γ0 ) corresponding to the Kolmogorov equation (4.1). It

The precise form of the adjoint operator L̂∗ will be given in Section 5. It is very
important to emphasize that in the papers [4, 5] the equation (4.4) was obtained from
quit heuristic arguments and, moreover, it was considered as the definition for the
evolution of the BDLP model.

Let H(ω, θ), θ ∈ R denotes the set of all operators of the form T = T0 + θ with

Remark 4.1. It is well-known (see e.g., [12]), that any T ∈ H(ω, θ) is a generator of
a semigroup U (t) which is holomorphic in the sector | arg t| < ω. The function U (t)
is not necessarily uniformly bounded, but it is quasi-bounded, i.e.
||U (t)|| ≤ const|eθt |
in any sector of the form | arg t| ≤ ω − ε.

In particular, if θ = 0 and b = 0, then T + A ∈ H(ω − ε, 0)
Following the proof of this theorem (see, e.g. [12]) and taking into account the
fact that L0 ∈ H(ω, 0) for any ω ∈ (0, π2 ), one can conclude in our case that δ can be
chosen equal to 12 . This is exactly the reason of appearing multiplicand 2 at the l.h.s.

Evolution of correlation functions

The main questions which we would like to study now are the existence and properties
of the solution to the hierarchical system of equations (4.4). The answers to these
questions are given in the following theorem
Theorem 5.1. Suppose that all assumptions of Theorem 4.6 are fulfilled. Then for
any initial function k0 from the class
n
o
KC := k : Γ0 → R | k · C −|η| ∈ L∞ (Γ0 , λ)

the corresponding solution kt to (4.4) exists and will be again the function from KC
for any moment of time t ≥ 0.

Proof. Following the scheme proposed in [16], we construct the corresponding
evolution of the locally finite measures on Γ0 . In order to realize this construction
we consider the dual space KC to the Banach space LC . The duality is given by the
following expression
Z
hhG, kii :=

G · k dλ,

G ∈ LC .

(5.1)

Γ0

It is clear that KC is the Banach space with the norm
||k|| := ||C −|·| k(·)||L∞ (Γ0 ,λ) .
Note also, that k · C −|·| ∈ L∞ (Γ0 , λ) means that the function k satisfies the bound
|k(η)| ≤ constC |η|

for λ-a.a. η ∈ Γ0 .

IBM Model with Competition in Spatial Ecology

15

The evolution on KC , which corresponds to Ût , t≥0 constructed in Theorem 4.6, may
be determined in the following way:
DD
EE
hhG, kt ii := Ût G, k0 .

We denote

Ût∗ k0 := kt .

Using the same arguments as in [16], it becomes clear that kt = Ût∗ k0 is the solution
to (4.4) in the Banach space KC .

It is important to emphasize that in the case of a− ≡ 0 and κ + < m
(n)

kt

t → 0,

for

any

n ≥ 1,

see e. g. [17]. Therefore, we may expect that the correlation functions of our model
satisfy this property as well.

Remark 6.1. For any C > 1 one may chose κ − > 0 and m > 0 such that (6.2) is

with the stationary state δ∅ (dγ) (the Dirac measure concentrated on the empty configuration ∅). In other words, the population evolving due to the BDLP dynamics is
asymptotically degenerated.

Further developments

In Theorem 5.1 we have shown that functions kt is bounded by C n for all t > 0,
provided that k0 satisfies initially the bound of the same type. Using approximation
arguments (see e.g. [16], [18]) one may prove that the corresponding time evolution of
the correlation function will be also correlation function for some probability measure

IBM Model with Competition in Spatial Ecology

on Γ. We suppose to discuss this problem as well as other probabilistic aspects of
the BDLP model in a forthcoming paper. The main aim of the present paper is to
analyze evolution of correlation functions. Namely, we have shown that dynamics of
correlation functions stays in the space KC . This property seems to be very strong. To
show that system of correlation functions evolving in time stays in the same space is
already difficult even for the contact model. Namely, (3.3) implies that the evolution
of correlation functions at some moment of time t may leave the space
n
o
k : Γ0 → R | k · C −|η| · |η|! ∈ L∞ (Γ0 , λ) .
The reason is that C may depend on t, which is true at least for the case κ + ≥ 1
(m = 1 at the moment). Hence, we may expect that the dynamics of correlation
functions for the contact process lives in some bigger space. Of course, this is possible
only for κ + ≤ 1 since for κ + > 1 density tends to infinity. Hence, let us consider the
case κ + = 1. One candidate for such bigger space is
n
o
RC := k : Γ0 → R | k · C −|η| · (|η|!)2 ∈ L∞ (Γ0 , λ) .

Note, that the invariant measure of the contact process belongs to this space (see [17,
Theorem 4.2]), provided that d ≥ 3, a+ has finite second moment w.r.t. the Lebesgue
measure and the Fourier transform of a+ is integrable on Rd . Below we show that the
evolution of correlation functions at any moment of time t is a function from RC .
Indeed, let κ + = 1 and suppose that there exists C > 0 such that for any n ≥ 1

As result, kt ∈ RC for all t ≥ 0.
Therefore, the dynamics of correlation functions for the contact model stays in
RC , hence, this dynamics is really very clustering for κ + = m = 1. As before, we may
extend our consideration on the case m 6= 1.
Summarizing previous results in this section we claim that the presence of the big
mortality and the big competition kernel prevents clustering in the system making
it sub-Poissonian distributed. But, is it really necessary to add “big” mortality and
competition kernel? Below we discuss this problem.
