We introduce a one-parametric family of tree growth models, in which branching probabilities
decrease with branch age τ as τ −α . Depending on the exponent α, the scaling of tree depth with
tree size n displays a transition between the logarithmic scaling of random trees and an algebraic
growth. At the transition (α = 1) tree depth grows as (log n)2 . This anomalous scaling is in good
agreement with the trend observed in evolution of biological species, thus providing a theoretical
support for age-dependent speciation and associating it to the occurrence of a critical point.

INTRODUCTION

Tree structures appear in a variety of contexts ranging
from river networks [1] and blood vessels [2] to directed
polymers [3, 4] or computer file systems [5–7]. Evolutionary histories and genealogies are naturally represented as
trees. Each branching point represents an ancestral relationship in a population or an event of diversification
on sets of languages [8], species [9–13] or socio-cultural
innovations [14]. Based on genetic information, modern
computational biology has inferred thousands of trees, socalled phylogenies [15], depicting the evolutionary relationships between sets of species, from bacteria to mammals [16]. The shapes of the collected phylogenies and of
related evolutionary trees [17] share statistical properties
not observed in trees generated by standard branching
models [18–20]. It has been a long-standing and fundamental question in evolutionary biology to identify which
processes accurately describe the observed tree shapes
and thus may serve as models of biological evolution
[21, 22].
A suitable starting point and null hypothesis is the
Equal Rate Markov (ERM) process, which assumes that
species speciate at a constant homogeneous rate, independently of previous events and of other species present.
More specifically, starting from a single tip (root), at each
discrete time step a tip i is chosen uniformly at random
and two new tips are attached to i, increasing the number
of tips by 1. The procedure has a direct interpretation
for macroevolution as a sequence of speciation events,
where the chosen species i is the latest common ancestor of two new species. The resulting topology of the
growing tree, which is equivalent to the one produced
by the Yule model [23], tends to generate compact and
nearly balanced tree shapes. Balance refers to an even
distribution of the number of nodes in the subtrees arising from the branches created at each speciation point.

However, when comparing with the shape of large collections of observed phylogenetic trees available nowadays
(e.g. [16, 17, 24]), the ERM hypothesis can be rejected,
as most real phylogenetic trees are significantly less balanced than those generated by the ERM and Yule models
[11, 21, 22, 24].

TREE SHAPE AND DEPTH

Several indices for imbalance measurement have been
proposed, used and compared, see Ref. [24–27] for detailed discussion. Here we study how the depth [28] of a
tree with n tips
d = n−1

n
X

di

i=1

scales with n. For each tip i, di denotes the number
of edges separating i from the root. The role of the
depth in capturing tree imbalance is apparent by the
two extreme cases. For the (fully balanced) complete
binary tree, d = log2 n since all n = 2k tips are at
distance k from root. On the other extreme of full imbalance, a comb (or pectinate) tree has n tips attached
to a path
Pn of n − 1 nodes starting at the root. Here
nd =
i=1 di = 1 + 2 + · · · + (n − 2) + 2(n − 1), resulting in asymptotically linear scaling d ∼ n. For the
ERM model, the small random imbalances introduced in
the process are not enough to affect the dominant scaling
behavior of the balanced tree and one finds hdi ∼ log n
(the average is over realizations of the random process).
This logarithmic scaling is a robust outcome related to
the exponential growth of tips occurring in time for virtually any model of growing supercritical trees [18], as
far as branches split independently and without memory, or if these correlations and memory are sufficiently

in good approximation. Although alternative scaling
laws have been proposed [11, 29], the (log n)2 form is
more accurate for large tree sizes [12, 30]. Similar behavior is observed in virus phylogenies where the scaling for individual phylogenies was reported to follow the
behavior (log n)γ with γ varying from 1 to 3 [24]. The
important point is the departure from the log n scaling of
the ERM class. Thus strong correlations are important
in the evolutionary processes represented in the phylogenetic databases.

short-ranged. Therefore we denote the logarithmic scaling of depth with tree size as normal. Deviating scaling
is called anomalous.
We have calculated [11, 12] the depth d for all trees
(and subtrees) in the phylogenetic databases TreeBASE
(containing species phylogenies [16]) and PANDIT (protein phylogenies [17]). The result in Figure 1(a) suggests

STATISTICAL ENSEMBLES OF TREES

A direct approach to capturing the imbalance of phylogenetic trees is by defining a probability π(l|n) of placing
exactly l out of n given tips in one of the two subtrees.
This stochastic splitting is first applied at the root and
then iterated at the roots of its two subtrees, at their
subtrees’ roots and so forth, until arriving at the tips. A
statistical ensemble of trees is constructed by considering
all possible binary trees up to a given size, and assigning
a probability to each of them as just the product of the
splitting probabilities of all the inner nodes.
Choosing uniform probabilities independently of l,
πERM (l|n) = 1/(n − 1) , 1 ≤ l ≤ n − 1, leads to the ERM.
Aldous’ Branching (AB) model [31] is the specific choice
πAB (l|n) ∝ l−1 (n − l)−1 , placing more probability mass
on the less balanced splits close to l = 1 and l = n − 1.
The AB model is a specific case of the one-parametric
(with parameter β) family of beta-splitting models [31].
Statistical quantities computed from the AB ensemble
(parameter value β = −1) have been identified as giving a good fit to real data [21, 22, 32]. The expected
depth scales as (log n)2 [31]. It is interesting to note that
the AB case β = −1 is precisely the critical point separating two qualitatively distinct scaling behaviors in the
general beta-splitting model: standard logarithmic scaling for β > −1, and power-law scaling hdi ∼ n−β−1 for
β < −1 [31].
The AB model, beta-splitting, and other models [33]
introduced to account for tree imbalance, however, assign
probabilities to tree shapes in a way which is not based
on any evolutionary mechanism. While they can statistically reproduce features of the trees in the databases,
this does not hint at any biological explanation of these
features, as Ref. [21] remarks.

THE AGE MODEL

We introduce the age model, which describes the
growth of a binary tree by iterative stochastic addition

where the normalization constant cα (t) is chosen such
that probabilities from all tips sum up to 1; (ii) a new
branch j is split from i with creation time tj = t while tip
i remains; (iii) time t is increased by ∆t and the process
resumes at (i). Each branching represents a new species
evolutionarily splitting from the original one. This is coherent with a scenario of peripatric speciation, in which
a small part of an ancestral population becomes isolated
and starts an independent evolution process, whereas the
main part of the population continues its previous dynamics. We focus on ∆t = 1 first and discuss the case
of ∆t = 1/n later, in section IV C. There we also regard a variation that treats both new descendants of the
split branch as new, starting at age zero. In terms of
biological evolution, the symmetric splitting is allopatric
speciation.
This defines a family of models parameterized by α.
We note that cα (n) (and pi (n)) depends only on the values of n and α (and i). These quantities are independent
of the details of the previous branching history, which
is a stochastic process. The ERM model, in which at
each step one tip is uniformly (independently of its age)
chosen for speciation, is recovered for α = 0. Negative
α enhances branching probability of the oldest tips, so
that trees more balanced than random ones are expected.
We will see that for sufficiently large positive α (in fact
α ≥ 1) the excess branching probability given to the
youngest tips strongly breaks balance and modifies the
ERM logarithmic depth scaling.
Figure 1(b) shows the dependence of mean depth on
tree size for the age model for several choices of the exponent α. At α = 1.0, we obtain hdi ∼ (log n)2 , both for
time increments ∆t = 1 and ∆t = 1/n (see below). The
parameters of the fitted curves agree well between model
and data (Figure 1(a); see the figure caption for details).
For comparison, the size-dependence of depth in the AB
model is also shown.
Going beyond averages and considering also fluctuations, a closer comparison between models and data is
made in Fig. 2 by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic. For a set of real trees T , the cumulative depth distribution q(d) is the fraction of trees in T having depth
less than d. For each tree in T , we generate with the
rules of the model being tested 100 trees of the same
size, obtaining a collection T 0 of 100 × |T | model trees
having the same size distribution as T and a cumulative
depth distribution q 0 (d). The KS statistic is the maxi-

of tips, one at each time step. Each tip i is assigned an
age τi (t) being the time that passed from the birth of
the tip, ti , to the present time t, i.e. τi (t) = t − ti . At
time t = 0 the tree consists of a single tip (the root),
labeled with the index i = 1, representing an ancestral
species. The growth proceeds by iterating the following
three steps. (i) A tip i is chosen with probability pi (t)
inversely proportional to a power of its age

panels show the maximum deviation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistic) between the cumulative distribution of depth in each
model and the real trees. Subsets T of the databases are chosen the same as the bins in Figure 1(a). See the main text
for further details. The inset shows, for one subset of TreeBase (trees of size 76 ≤ n ≤ 102), the cumulative distributions of the real trees (thick curve without symbols) and the
three models, leading to the KS statistic values marked by
the dashed rectangle.

mum deviation κ = maxd∈R |q(d) − q 0 (d)| between data
and model distributions, with κ = 0 if and only if the
distributions are identical. Except for the smallest trees
(n < 20), we find (Fig. 2) that the depth distributions of
the real trees in both databases are systematically closer
to the age model with α = 1.0 than to the AB model.

Analytic calculations for the age model and
finite-size corrections

At time step n (and taking ∆t = 1), the tree has n
tips with ages τ1 = n, τ2 = n − 1, . . . , τi = n − i + 1,. . . ,
τn = 1. Thus the normalization constant is

This shows that the chosen age becomes progressively
younger as α increases. Older branches become less likely
to branch and imbalance is enhanced. Note that τ (n) ∼
n/2 for the ERM model (α = 0).
A heuristic argument to obtain hd(n)i uses ∆n/τ (n) as
an estimate of the mean number of branching events in
a time interval of length ∆n centered at n. Thus we can
count the mean number of branching events as a function
of n by the integral:

Prefactors have not been included since our crude argument is not expected to give them exactly. li(n) is the
logarithmic integral function.
Equation (7) gives the n-dependence of the depth hdi
in leading order for large tree size n. Finite size corrections to scaling, found numerically, are significant only
close to the transition. Figure 3 shows finite size corrections to this leading order. As usual, the corrections
become large close to a transition point, in this case close
to α = 1 (Figure 3(a)). Likewise, α above but close to
1.0 leads to large corrections from the scaling with nα−1
(Figure 3(c)). For α = 1.0, the function hdi/(ln n)2 is
only weakly dependent on n, falling monotonically from
0.85 to 0.48 over 5 orders of magnitude in n (filled triangles in Figure 3(b)).
The predicted behavior (7) is consistent with our numerical findings. Thus the age model with α = 1 leads to
the asymptotic square-logarithmic scaling that appears
to describe the real phylogenies rather well. Interestingly, this particular scaling appears at the critical transition between purely logarithmic and power-law scaling,
in much the same way as for the beta-splitting model [31].
This may indicate a kind of universality in tree-shape
transitions, and associated universality classes. Another
transition, to the comb tree scaling, occurs at α = 2.

C.

Extensions

The definition of the age model so far describes peripatric speciation. A more symmetric allopatric speciation mechanism would imply a more similar role for the
species arising in a branching event, for example a resetting to zero of the age of the two species emerging from
the branching, so that both are considered to be new
and not just one of them. The analytic evaluations become more delicate, since cα (t) is now a random variable,
but heuristics confirms that the asymptotic scaling of the
expected age τ (n) and depth scaling hd(n)i in the symmetric model is the same as for the corresponding asymmetric one given by Eqs. (6) and (7). Numerically we
find the mean depth obtained from the allopatric version

to coincide with that of the original peripatric version
of the model at α = 1: Relative deviations between hdi
estimates are below 1% and become smaller for growing
n.
Another important extension corresponds to the case
in which the age of the tips is not measured in number
of speciation events τ , but in a different but related time
unit. It is biologically reasonable (as assumed also in the
Yule model) that speciation rate is proportional to the
number of species present, so that the instants of times
assigned to successive speciation events tn and tn+1 are
related to the numbering of speciation events n and n + 1
by ∆t ≡ tn+1 − tn = 1/n. This implies tn ∼ log n at
large n. This new time-age an (τ ) of a tip that has an
event-age τ is thus an (τ ) = tn − tn−τ ∼ log n − log(n −
τ ) = − log(1 − τ /n) for large n. For a version of the
age model with speciation probabilities proportional to
1/aα
n , we can recalculate the expected value of the eventage τ (n) chosen at instant n or tn :
Pn
τ an (τ )−α
τ (n) = Pτn=1
.
(8)
−α
τ =1 an (τ )
To further analyze this expression, we approximate the
sums by integrals, and introduce the change of variable
s = τ /n. After this it is clear that the integrals for large
n are dominated by the singularities arising as s → 0 (say
within the interval s ∈ [1/n, ], with  small), which allow
us to use the small s expansion: an (τ ) ≈ − log(1−s) ≈ s:
R
−α
+ . . .) ds
1 ns (s
.
(9)
τ (n) ≈ nR  −α
+ . . .) ds
1 (s
n

Now, these integrals become identical to the ones corresponding to the asymptotic evaluation of the sums in
the original age model, so the asymptotic behavior of the
depth will be the same. This points out, once again, that
the important ingredient needed to alter the standard
logarithmic ERM depth scaling is the excess of branching probability assigned to young branches (small τ ) by
the τ −α factor. Continuous-time branching processes in
which different branches split independently with some
waiting time distribution of the renewal type [18] can be
also considered. They would have instantaneous branching rates decaying as t−1 at long times when the waitingtime density decays as a power law at these long times.
But as Eq. (9) reveals this long-time behavior is not the
relevant one, but the presence of a short-time singularity. Singularity with the required strength can not be
achieved with normalizable continuous-time waiting-time
densities. This is why we have always found the normal
depth scaling as log n in simulations of this type of processes, even when the waiting time distribution had fat
tails. Another ingredient in the age model is that the
normalization constant in the denominator of Eq. (3) involves the age of all branches. This provides an interaction among all branches, which is absent in models of
independent branching.

scaling of Equation (7) were absent, the three lower curves (α < 1.0) would be flat in panel (a). In panel (b) this would be
the case exactly for α = 1.0 (filled triangles). In panel (c), the three curves for α > 1.0 would be flat. Each data point is an
average over 100 independent trees.

DISCUSSION

Motivated by observations of anomalous scaling in evolutionary trees [11, 12, 21, 22, 24], the proposed age model
introduces time-correlations and branch interactions such
that a variety of depth scalings can be reached beyond
the standard logarithmic one. Remarkably, for the case
α = 1, corresponding to the critical point between two
qualitatively different phases, the model agrees with observed phylogenetic trees better than previous models. In
addition, it describes the tree generation process assuming that lineages which have not speciated for a long time
display in the future a still more reduced speciation rate.
This kind of phenomenon is discussed in the framework
of evolution and heritability of evolvability and robustness in the biological literature [34], and of phenotypic
entrapment in genotype networks [35]. In a broader picture, dynamics on possibly rugged fitness landscapes [36]
provides evolution at the microscopic level. It could serve
as a mechanistic explanation of the assumptions of the
age-dependent model.
Future work should consider the inclusion of extinc-

tion processes into the model. This is a realistic element that would open the possibility of an additional
critical behavior (the transition between growth and extinction) known to alter tree topology [18, 37–40]. Why
evolution should be poised at the critical point deserves
further investigation [41, 42]. Analyses and comparison
of branch length distributions are worth pursuing. Although branch length data of phylogenies are not as reliable as their topological structure [43], improvements are
rapidly accumulating (see e.g. Ref. [44]).
