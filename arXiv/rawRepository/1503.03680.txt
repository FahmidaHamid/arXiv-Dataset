Abstract—An analysis of breast cancer incidences in women
and the relationship between ethnicity and survival rate has been
an ongoing study with recorded incidences of missing values
in the secondary data. In this paper, we study and report the
results of breast cancer survival rate by ethnicity, age and income
groups from the dataset collected for 53593 patients in South
East England between the years 1998 and 2003. In addition to
this, we also predict the missing values for the ethnic groups in
the dataset. The principle findings in our study suggest that: 1)
women of white ethnicity in South East England have a highest
percentage of survival rate when compared to the black ethnicity,
2) High income groups have higher survival rates to that of lower
income groups and 3) Age groups between 80-95 and 20-35 have
lower percentage of survival rate.

I NTRODUCTION

A. Motivation for imputation
Surveys often contain missing values and the process of
replacing these missing values with substituted values is called
as imputation [7] [8]. These missing values might induce
more useful information in predicting the trends and statistics.
For conveniences of analysis, statisticians normally discard
observations containing the missing values. This results in the
reduction of the sample size for the analysis and interesting
information might get lost. This can be a serious hindrance not
only by misleading the results [9] but also by producing overly
simplified conclusions. Hence, there is a need for imputation
when dealing with the data analysis especially in the health
care domain.
From the literature the missing value problem can be
categorised into two main types: 1) missing values at random
and 2) missing values not at random [10]. Missing values
not at random can again be of two types 1) for discrete
values (group membership) [11] and 2) for continues values.
Methods such as: 1) mean substitution, 2) median substitution could be utilises for computing the missing values at
random [12] [10]. Other method including, maximum votes
and nearest neighbours techniques can also be employed for
this purpose. Regression based substitution can be employed
for continuous missing values that are not at random. The
aforementioned methods fail when imputing the values for
group membership (refer to [13] for computing missing values
for group memberships). When dealing with missing values for
group memberships, methods such as: 1) analysis of variance
(AnoVa) [14], 2) analysis of mean and 3) classification based
methods [15] could be employed. In the earlier methods, the
variance and mean for each group is calculated and mean

square error is computed between the observations of group
and the new group that contains missing values. The group
member with minimum mean square error is assigned to the
missing value. In the classification based approach, the missing
values are considered as the unknown class labels and a
classifier model is built on the existing observations. Using
the classifier model the missing values are then computed.
In this process, the classifier must be cross validated for the
performance.
Using traditional statistical methods sometimes might give
us overly simplified solutions, hence there is a need for statistical machine learning algorithms which are a combination of
both probability and statistics [15]. Therefore, we in this study
use classification based method to impute the missing values
for group membership, i.e ethnicity group.

B. Motivation underlying the current study
Breast cancer is a malignant tumour that originates from
the cells of the breast and grows into surrounding and distant
tissues [1]. It is the second most common cancer in women
which makes this study important. The relationship between
ethnicity, survival percentage, and breast cancer is complex.
Studies carried out in the past have shown that women of
different ethnicity have different rates of survival from breast
cancer after diagnosis [2]. Many comparisons and links have
been made between ethnicity, income and survival rates in
women diagnosed with breast cancer [3] [4] [5]. According
to a study carried out by the Cancer Research UK 1 , after
grouping women into ethnicity groups aged between 15 and
64 years, the percentage of survival from breast cancer of
those of white ethnicity is relatively higher at 91.4% than
women of black ethnicity with survival percentage of 85.0%.
The National Cancer Intelligence Network 2 have produced a
report [6] on ‘Cancer Incidence and Survival by Major Ethnic
Groups in England between 2002 and 2006’. This report shows
that the survival rates of women with breast cancer categories
into four major ethnicity groups namely: White, Asian, Black
and Unknown, white women had a higher rate of survival
compared to those of black ethnicity. Bradley et al. in [5],
showed that low socioeconomic status was associated with
late-stage breast cancer at diagnosis and mostly in death.

C. Objectives and contribution
The main objectives of this study are two-fold. On one
hand, from the computational perspective, we would like
to examine the feasibility of using machine learning based
classifier (e.g, Naive Bayes) in filling up the missing values in
the data. On the other hand, from the scientific perspective, we
would like understand whether the insights from breast cancer
analytics correspond to what clinicians would expect. For
example to answer the following questions that are exploratory
in nature.
•

Does survival rate get affected by the age and ethnic
group of the patient? for instance, are black and older
women more likely to die if they have breast cancer.

•

Does financial status of the patient have any effect
on the survival rate? i.e, do wealthier have lower
possibility of dying from the breast cancer.

Our contribution in this paper is to show how a machine
learning based classifier can be utilised to impute the missing
values in the health care data and obtain insights. When there
are many classification methods available in the literature, it is
difficult to choose which one to use. In such a case simplicity,
reputation of the method and experience of its usage can
influence the selection process. Therefore, in this study, we
have chosen Naive Bayes classifier to compute the missing
values because of its simplicity and inexpensiveness.

DATA PREPROCESSING

The dataset is collected for 53593 breast cancer incidences
in women taken in South East England between the years
1998 and 2003. The initial dataset consists of 13 features
however some of these features are simply an alternative way
of representing the existing ones. Therefore these features are
removed from the dataset. Features such as ’Year of Diagnosis’
and ’Year of Death or Censored’ are removed as this data was
available to us within the ’Survival’ feature. We also have
removed the single year ’Age at diagnosis’ feature as we
already have this information within the ’Age’ feature. This
left us with a final dataset of 9 features as shown in Table I
along with its Data format.

The most common cancer treatment taken by women of
white ethnicity is radiotherapy as seen in Figure 2. However
this seems to be the least common treatment for women of
black African ethnicity.
Figure 3 shows that the women from the white ethnic group
are quite evenly distributed in terms of their socioeconomic
deprivation.
Looking at the average of survival days across the ethnic
groups shows that women of Chinese ethnicity have the highest
days of survival from breast cancer (see, Figure 4). It also
highlights that although the proportion of women of white
ethnicity is significantly higher than any other groups, an
average count gives a better indication of the caner survival
rate across the ethnicity. Figure 7 shows that the proportion
of breast cancer survival compared to death is much higher
within the white ethnic group and similar in black Caribbean
and Indian ethnicity.

The Naive Bayes classifier involves two stages. The first
stage is training, where the probabilities of every features’
parameter given each class as well as the probability of
each class are estimated. These are known as the Likelihood
P (X|C) and Class Prior probability P (C) respectively. The
second stage is prediction, where the posterior probability
algorithm (Eq. 1) calculates the probability of each class given
the parameters of each feature in the new data. Finally it
predicts the class with the highest posterior probability as the
result. As the features of our dataset are also assumed to be
independent of each other and the class we believe that using
the Naive Bayes algorithm will give us the best output.

M ETHODOLOGY

A. Naive Bayes for imputation
In order to fill up the ethnicity of the records with unknown
ethnicity group, we decided to take a supervised-learning
approach. The supervised-learning (machine learning) uses
known set of input data and response to the data to build a
predictor model that will generate predictions for the response
to the new set of data. Since our dataset mainly consisted of
binary and nominal data values we determined that this was
a classification problem and chose Naive Bayes classification
algorithm to model our predictor. The Naive Bayes algorithm
seemed to be the optimal choice despite it having a low
predictive accuracy because it handles categorical predictors
very well and its speed and memory usage are good for
simple distributions. More importantly this algorithm is easy to
interpret because it is based on finding the posterior probability

P (C|X) =

P (X|C)P (C)
.
P (X)

(1)

B. Parameter tuning
The Naive Bayes Classifier supports a number of probability distribution estimates. Based on theory the Multivariate
Multinomial Distribution is the ideal distribution for us to
choose as our dataset consists of categorical features; however
we decided to conduct a set of parameter tuning experiments
with the different distribution options available in Matlab to
observe the legitimacy of the theory. We chose: 1)Normal
(Gaussian), 2) Kernel, 3) Multinomial and 4) Multivariate
Multinomial and set the class prior probability as uniform for
all cases so that the probabilities are equal for all classes. subsequently, we decided to choose the best distribution depending
on the highest value for accuracy after cross validations.
C. Cross validation
In order to run the cross validation we first extracted the
records of unknown ethnic group from the original dataset
and created the training data with the remaining records. We
decided to use the K Fold Cross validation process in order

to enhance the accuracy of the results and a value of 10
for K seemed ideal for such a large dataset. The 10 fold
cross validation involved dividing our training data into 10
sets, then setting aside one set for validation we used the
remaining 9 sets to train the Bayesian classifier. Then we cross
validated the results with the validation set and calculated its
accuracy using unbiased F-measure [16]. This cross validation
was computed 10 times where every time a different set was
used for validation and then an average of the F-measure
percentages are calculated. After running this for each of the
distribution parameters we chose to use the distribution with
the highest accuracy. We ran the prediction model for the four
distributions we considered.

A. Cross validation
Table IV indicates that fitting the Bayesian model with
a ’Kernel’ distribution with uniform prior and ’Gaussian’
distribution with no prior as parameters give the most accurate
94.10% and 94.01% results respectively when compared to the
other distributions. Therefore, we consider predictions based
on kernel distribution for the imputation.

D. Performance evaluation
The F-measure is a good way to calculate the performance
of a prediction model by checking the predicted results against
the actual results. The process involves finding the total number
of True Positives (tp), True Negatives (tn), False Positives (fp)
and False Negatives (fn) from the result comparison. Then
finding the Precision and Recall using the equations in Table III
where Precision is the ratio of number of correct results to the
number of all returned results and Recall is the ratio of the
number of correct results to the number of results that should
have been returned [11]. Finally the unbiased F-measure is
then calculated by finding the harmonic mean of the Precision
and Recall rates.

B. Ethnic groups vs survival rates
1) Before imputation: Figure 5 shows the distribution of
ethnicity within our original dataset. According to that, the
majority of our samples are white women (58%). A high
percentage (35%) of the samples are from unknown ethnic
groups. Other ethnic groups exist in small percentages with
Bangladesh being the lowest. The high number of white
women is due to socio-demographic reasons. The data was collected in Southwest of England where most of the population
is of white ethnic group. This is justified by the data produced
by the Office for National Statistics census data, UK [17]. The
population in South East England by ethnic group in 2009
contains 90.7% of white ethnicity.

E. Imputation
Once the dataset was finally ready to be classified by the
Bayesian model we assigned the previously extracted records
of the unknown ethnic group as our testing dataset and keeping
all of the remaining data records for training and the Ethnic
group feature was assigned as the class label. The testing
dataset consisted of 18595 records which is around 35% of
the original records. This actually gives a close 30:70 ratio
between the testing and training which is optimal as previously mentioned. Once the predicted results were obtained we
integrated the unknown records back into the original dataset
and replaced the unknown values with the predicted ethnic
groups.

The distribution of data affects our results due to the
unequal number of samples between the ethnic groups. In order
to avoid that, we convert the existing numbers to percentages
so as to make results more reliable.
The results for the mortality rate according to ethnicity
show that the highest number of people that died of breast
cancer is in white ethnic group (Figure 5). This does not
necessarily mean that this group is more probable to die from

breast cancer. In order to get the possibility of each ethnic
group facing cancer we translate our results in percentages
within each group.

2) After imputation: Figure 8 shows the predicted values
for the unknown ethnicity records and indicates that the
majority of them belong to the white ethnic group.
Figure 9 depicts, ‘For women aged between 15-64, the
percentage of survival from Breast Cancer of those of white
ethnicity is likely to be higher than those of black ethnicity’
as the white women are shown to have a 84% survival rate
compared to a 77% survival rate for the women belonging to
the Black ethnic group.

tively where all unknown records are classified into the existing
ethnic groups based on the predicted percentages obtained for
each ethnicity, as shown in Figure 8. Similarly the comparison
of numerals before and after imputation is shown in Table V.
C. Age vs survival rates
Similarly, we produce the results for the relationship between ages and mortality.
Figure 11 depicts that ages from 50 to 60 had the lowest
possibility of dying from breast cancer. The highest death
possibilities are detected in the ages between 80 and 95.
Another interesting information is that high death possibilities
are detected in the earlier ages of 20-35. This might be because
younger people are not properly informed or do not visit their
doctors in a frequent basis in comparison to older women.

D. Income vs survival rate
The final objective that we are interested is know whether
the financial status effects the death rate. Income feature indicates the financial status of patients and values from 1(richest)
to 5(poorer) are used. In Figure 12, we see that wealthier
patients have lower death rates. This is probably because they
can afford better treatment facilities.

Comparing our results with previous statistical research
in [18] and [5], we can confirm that our scientific objectives are
consistent with their findings. In fact, referring to [6]and [18]

approves that white women have higher survival percentage than black women with 91.4% and 85%, respectively.
Similarly, older woman and lower income groups have high
mortality rates.
There always exists some limitations with the data collection. In fact, by examining the breast cancer dataset, we
can notice a clear imbalanced number of participants between
the different ethnic groups where white females were representing more than half of the population versus very few
numbers amongst all other ethnicity. This limitation might
have certainly misled our prediction results which may explain
the low F-measure percentages obtained on other distributions
excluding kernel and Gaussian.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

C ONCLUSIONS AND D ISCUSSIONS

After obtaining and appraising our results, we affirm that
the type of dataset to be classified plays a role in selecting
the appropriate distribution type for the Bayesian classifier.
Based on our results, kernel distribution has the best F-measure
percentage amongst all other distributions.
