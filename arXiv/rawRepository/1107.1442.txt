ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes (CRE) are bio-molecular motors in eukaryotic
cells. These are driven by a chemical fuel, namely, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CREs actively
participate in many cellular processes that require accessibility of specific segments of DNA which
are packaged as chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is a nucleosome where 146 bp ∼ 50 nm of a
double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is wrapped around a spool formed by histone proteins. The helical
path of histone-DNA contact on a nucleosome is also called “footprint”. We investigate the mechanism of footprint traversal by a CRE that translocates along the dsDNA. Our two-state model of a
CRE captures effectively two distinct chemical (or conformational) states in the mechano-chemical
cycle of each ATP-dependent CRE. We calculate the mean time of traversal. Our predictions on
the ATP-dependence of the mean traversal time can be tested by carrying out in-vitro experiments
on mono-nucleosomes.

INTRODUCTION

A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule is a linear
heteropolymer whose monomeric subunits, called nucleotides, are denoted by the four letters A, T, C and
G. The sequence of these nucleotides in a DNA molecule
chemically encodes genetic informations. In the nucleus
of an eukaryotic cell, DNA is stored in a hierarchically
organized structure called chromatin [1–4]. The primary
repeating unit of chromatin at the lowest level of the hierarchical structure is a nucleosome [5]. The cylindrically
shaped core of each nucleosome consists of an octamer of
histone proteins around which 146 base pairs (i.e.,∼ 50
nm) of the the double stranded DNA is wrapped about
two turns (more precisely, 1.7 helical turns); the arrangement is reminiscent of wrapping of a thread around a
spool. There are 14 equispaced sites, at intervals of 10
base pairs (bp), on the surface of the cylindrical spool.
Electrostatic attraction between these binding sites on
the histone spool and the oppositely charged DNA seems
to dominate the histone-DNA interactions which stabilize the nucleosomes. Throughout this paper, the helical
curve formed by the histone-DNA overlap will be called
the “footprint”.
The DNA stores the genetic blueprint of an organism.
If nucleosomes were static, segments of DNA buried in
nucleosomes would not be accessible for various functions
involving the corresponding gene [6–8]. However, in reality, nucleosomes are dynamic. Spontaneous dynamics of
nucleosomes are usually consequences of thermal fluctuations whereas the active dynamic processes are driven by
special purpose molecular machines called chromatin remodeling enzymes (CRE) fuelled by ATP [9–14]. Various
aspects of chromatin dynamics has received some atten-

tion of theoretical modelers, including physicists, over the
last few years [15–27].
In general, “Chromatin remodelling” refers to a range
of enzyme mediated structural transitions that occur during gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. To make DNA,
which is wrapped around histone octamer, accessible for
various DNA-dependent processes, it is always necessary
to rearrange or mobilize the nucleosomes. In principle,
there are at least four different ways in which a CRE can
affect the nucleosomes [28]: (i) sliding the histone octamer, i.e., repositioning of the entire histone spool, on
the dsDNA; (ii) exchange of one or more of the histone
subunits of the spool with those in the surrounding solution (also called replacement of histones) (iii) removal of
one or more of the histone subunits of the spool, leaving
the remaining subunits intact, and (iv) complete ejection
of the whole histone octamer without replacement. Our
theoretical work here is closely related to sliding.
In the next section we describe a scenario in which
either a CRE motor (or, other ATP-dependent motors
that translocate along dsDNA) traverse the “footprint”.
Because of the stochasticity of the underlying mechanochemical kinetics, the footprint traversal time (FTT) is a
fluctuating random variable. Extending an earlier model
developed by Chou [29], we analytically calculate the
mean FTT (MFTT) of the CRE motor.
To our surprise, we found that the ATP-dependence of
the various ATP-driven activities of CREs have not been
studied systematically in the published literature. In particular, we address the question: how does the MFTT of
a CRE motor vary with the variation of the concentration of ATP? This rate is not necessarily directly proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the CRE because the mechanical sliding of the nucleosome need not
be tightly coupled with the hydrolysis of ATP by the
CRE. Therefore, we develope here an analytical theory
predicting the ATP-dependence of the ATP-dependent
footprint-traversal by CRE. We hope our result will stim-

2
ulate systematic experimental investigations on the ATPdependence of ATP-dependent CREs.

II. CRE: PHENOMENOLOGY AND
MOTIVATION FOR THIS WORK

Chromatin is not a frozen static aggregate of DNA and
proteins. Spontaneous thermal fluctuations can cause a
transient unwrapping and rewrapping of the nucleosomal
DNA from one end of the nucleosome spool; the corresponding rates for an isolated single nucleosome are,
typically, 4s−1 and 20 − 90s−1, respectively [30]. In other
words, once wrapped fully, the nucleosomal DNA remains
in that state for about 250ms before unwrapping again
spontaneously; however, it waits in the unwrapped state
only for about 10 − 50ms before rewrapping again spontaneously. Surprisingly, the accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA is only modestly affected if instead of a single
nucleosome the experiment is repeated with an array of
homogeneously distributed nucleosomes [31, 32]. Moreover, folding of an array of nucleosomes makes the linker
DNA about 50 times less accessible [31, 32]. Furthermore, on the nucleosomal DNA, the farther is a site from
the entry and exit points, the longer one has to wait to
access it by the rarer spontaneous fluctuation of sufficiently large size [33]. Thus, nucleosomal DNA far from
both the entry and exit sites is practically inaccessible by
spontaneous thermal fluctuations.
Can a nucleosome slide spontaneously by thermal fluctuations thereby exposing the nucleosomal DNA? Interestingly, spontaneous repositioning of nucleosome on
DNA strands is a well known phenomenon [34]. How can
one reconcile accessibility of nucleosomal DNA by such
repositioning [34] with the difficulty of access by unwrapping from either end of the spool [33]? If the DNA were to
move unidirectionally along its own superhelical contour
on the surface of the histone, at every step it would have
to first transiently detach simultaneously from all the 14
binding sites and then reattach at the same sites after
its contour gets shifted by 10 bp (or multiples of 10 bp).
But, the energy cost of the simultaneous detachment of
the DNA from all the 14 binding sites is prohibitively
large because the total energy of binding at the 14 sites
is about 75kB T [17, 18, 21].
But, why can’t the cylindrical spool simply roll on the
wrapped nucleosomal DNA thereby repositioning itself?
If the nucleosome rolls by detaching DNA from one end
of the spool, cannot it compensate this loss of binding
energy by simulataneous attachment with a binding at
the other end? If such an energy compensation were
possible, detachment from only one binding site would be
required at a time. But, the cylindrical spool has a finite
size on which only a finite number (14) of binding sites
for DNA are accomodated. Therefore, by rolling over
the DNA the spool would not offer any vacant binding
site to the DNA with which it can bind. This rolling
mechanism would successfully lead to spontaneous sliding

of the nucleosome only if the histone spool were infinite
with an infinite sequence of binding sites for DNA on its
surface [21].
We now describe a plausible mechanism for spontaneous sliding of a nucleosome [16–18]. In the process of
normal “breathing”, most often the spontaneously unwrapped flap rewraps exactly to its original position on
the histone surface. However, if the rewrapping of a unwrapped flap takes place at a slightly displaced location
on the histone spool a small bulge (or loop) of DNA forms
on the surface of the histones. Since the successive binding sites are separated by 10bp, the length of the loop
is quantized in the multiples of 10bp [16]. Such a spontaneously created DNA loop, can diffuse in an unbiased
manner on the surface of the histone spool. In the beginning of each step DNA from one end of the loop detaches
from the histone spool, but the consequent energy loss is
made up by the attachment of DNA at the other end of
the loop to the histone spool before the step is completed.
Consequently, by this diffusive dynamics, the DNA loop
can traverse the entire length of the 14 binding sites on
the histone spool of a nucleosome which will manifest as
sliding of the nucleosome by a length that is exactly equal
to the length of DNA in the loop. The diffusing DNA
bulge can be formed by a “twist”, rather than bending,
of DNA [35–37]. Spontaneous sliding of a nucleosome,
however, is too slow to support intranuclear processes
which need access to nucleosomal DNA.
It is now widely agreed that ATP-dependent active remodeling of nucleosome can account for the fast sliding
of nucleosomes. Nevertheless, bulging DNA loop is expected to play a key role in the remodeling process [27].
Our model describes how a CRE motor can wedge itself
at the fork between the histone spool and a transiently
detached segment of dsDNA and, by exploiting the spontaneously diffusing loop by an ATP-dependent ratcheting, traverse the footprint in a directed manner. Because
of the intrinsic stochasticity of the mechano-chemistry
of the CRE and that of the diffusive motion of the DNA
loop, the overall motion of the CRE is noisy and the time
it takes to traverse the footprint is random.
The main question we address in this paper is the following: if < T > is the MFTT, what is the dependence of
< T > on the concentration of ATP in the surrounding
aqueous medium? To our knowledge, in the published
literature neither systematic experiments nor any analytical theory has addressed this question. In this paper,
by extending Chou’s model [29] of CRE, we capture the
role of ATP explicitly and derive an analytical expression for the dependence of < T > on the concentration
of ATP.
A CRE may be regarded as a molecular motor where
input energy is derived from ATP hydrolysis and the
output is mechanical work. The directed movement of
the CRE may be caused either by a power stroke or by
a Brownian ratchet mechanism [2]. The kinetics of the
ATP-dependent CRE motor is formulated in our model
in terms of a set of master equations. The kinetic scheme

3
can be interpreted in terms of both power stroke and
Brownian ratchet mechanisms.
One interesting question [28] in the context of CRE is
whether the CRE translocates along the DNA by moving around the nucleosome, or whether the CRE anchors
on the histone octamer and “pumps” DNA by pulling
around the octamer. From the perspective of physicists,
these two alternative scenarios can be viewed as merely a
change of frame of reference- one is fixed with respect to
the DNA whereas the other is fixed with respect to the
CRE. Therefore, we describe the operation of the CRE
with respect to a reference frame with respect to which
the CRE translocates along the DNA; but, the model can
be reformulated by a coordinate transformation so as to
capture the alternative scenario where the CRE pumps
the DNA.

We model a mono nucleosome where a dsDNA is
wrapped one-and-three-fourth turn around a disc-shaped
spool made of histone proteins (see Fig.1(a)). Following Chou [29], we consider the scenario where the CRE
“wedges itself underneath the histone”.
The sites of histone-DNA contact along the DNA chain
is represented as a one-dimensional lattice. Therefore,
the lattice constant is, typically, 10 bp ((see Fig.1(b)).
The total number n of lattice sites is equal to the total
number of histone-DNA contact in a single nucleosome.

A.

Flap, loop and diffusive sliding of histone spool

In this subsection we present a summary of Chou’s
ideas [29] which we need in the next subsection where
we extend Chou’s model. Here we consider the simple
situation when no CRE is present and the kinetics of the
system is governed solely by spontaneous thermal fluctuations. Because of these fluctuations, from either end of
the histone-DNA contact region, small segments of DNA

momentarily unwrap from the histone spool at a rate ku .
For energetic reasons, the most likely length of such a
segment would be one lattice spacing, i.e., about 10bp.
Following Chou [29], we call such unwrapped segments a
“flap”. The rate of the reverse transition, in which rebinding of the DNA flap with the histone, takes place at
a rate kb .
A flap need not re-make the original histone-DNA contact. Instead, by pulling in an extra segment of the DNA,
its next segment can bind with the last binding site on
the histone spool, with rate α thereby forming what Chou
[29] referred to as a “loop’. While located at either end
of the lattice, a loop can revert to a flap at a rate β. The
rates α and β are well approximated by [29]
α ∼ kb e−Ebend /(kB T ) , and β ∼ ku

where Ebend is the energy cost of bending the DNA into
the shape of the loop.
A loop can step forward or backward. In the absence
of any CRE, the rates of the forward and backward steppings of the loop are equal (denoted by k), provided the
size of the loop Lloop remains unaltered (see Fig.2); in
each forward step it unwraps one segment of DNA from
the histone in the direction of its hop and re-wraps another equally long segment behind it. Therefore, one can
approximate k by [29]


kb
k ∼ ku
(2)
(kb + ku )
When a loop, after entering the lattice from one end,
makes an eventual exit from the other end, it completes
the “sliding” of the histone spool by a distance Lloop
along the DNA in the opposite direction. Therefore, from
the perspective of the sliding histone spool, its effective
rate of hopping by a step of size Lloop along the dsDNA
strand is the same as the rate pn at which a DNA loop of
length Lloop traverses the lattice of n sites from one end
to the other.
Suppose Pj (t) denotes the probability that the loop is
located at j (0 ≤ j ≤ 1). Following Chou’s arguments,
based on master equations for Pj (t), one gets [29]
pn =

αkku
(n − 1)βkb + k(α + 2kb )

(3)

In the absence of a CRE, the traversal of a DNA loop of
length Lloop from left to right is as likely as that from
right to left. Therefore, the histone spool can slide forward or backward, with equal rate pn , by a step of size

4
Lloop . As we’ll see in the next subsection, peeling off of
the DNA from the histone spool by a CRE motor keeps
decreasing the effective value of n which, in turn, increases the effective sliding rate pn .

B.

Kinetics of CRE-driven directed sliding of
histone spool

Next, we consider the effect of DNA loop diffusion on
the ATP-dependent translocation kinetics of a CRE. The
model and results presented in this subsection are extensions of Chou’s work [29] by incorporating explicitly a
Brownian ratchet mechanism for CRE motors.
As in ref.[29], we assume that the step size of the CRE
motor is identical to the length of the thermally generated
DNA loop. Therefore, the mechanical movements of the
CRE motor can be described as that of a “particle” on
the one-dimensional lattice on which the equi-spaced sites
denote the histone-DNA contact points. We denote the
position of the CRE motor on this lattice by the integers
m. We now extend Chou’s model [29] by exploiting a superficial similarity with the Garai-Chowdhury-Betterton
(GCB) model [38] for the Brownian ratchet mechanism
of monomeric helicase motors.
A DNA helicase unwinds a dsDNA and translocates
along one of two strands. At any arbitrary instant of
time, the configuration of the system looks very similar
to that shown in Fig.1(b) except that the surface of the
DNA spool and the dsDNA would be replaced by the
two strands of the dsDNA itself. The lattice constant is
1bp in the case of a helicase whereas it is about 10 bp in
Fig.1(b). In the Brownian ratchet mechanism, momentary local unwinding of a segment, typically, 1 bp long,
takes place at the fork by spontaneous thermal fluctuation; the opportunistic advance of the helicase merely
prevents closure of the segment. Similarly, in the Brownian ratchet mechanism of the CRE, the CRE is assumed
to “wedge” itself just in front of the DNA-histone fork.
The CRE motor can move forward only if the segment in
front of it is unwrapped by thermal fluctuation.

FIG. 5: A schematic representation of the Brownian ratchet
mechanism.

The mechano-chemical cycle of the CRE is captured
in our model exactly the same way in which that of the
helicase was formulated in the GCB model [38]. We assume that sequence of states in each mechano-chemical
cycle of a CRE can be combined into two distinct groups
which we label by the integers 1 and 2 (see Fig.3). The
allowed transitions and the corresponding rate constants
are shown in Fig.4.
The physical processes captured by these rate constants can be motivated by a comparison with the abstract Brownian ratchet mechanism, illustrated in Fig.5.
ATP hydrolysis by the CRE drives its transition from the
state 1 to the state 2 at a rate ω21 . Let us assume that the
motor experiences two different types of potentials in the
states 1 and 2. Let us further assume that initially the periodic potential, with asymmetric sawtooth-like period, is
kept on for sometime and during this time the motor settles at a position that coincides with one of the minima of
this potential. Now if this potential is switched off then
the probability distribution of the position of the motor
will spread as a symmetric Gaussian. After sometime
this Gaussian profile is broad enough to overlap with the
next well (shadded region in the Fig.5), in addition to
the original well. Now if the sawtooth potential is again
switched on then, with a non-zero probability (that is
proportional to the area of the shaded region) the motor
will find itself in the next well. Our model accounts for
this possibility with the transition associated with the
f
rate constant ω12
. There is also a finite probability that
the particle stays back in its original well; this is captured
by the transition with the rate constant ω12 .

is reduced from the free hopping rate ω12
by a factor that
depends on both ku and kb .
When a diffusing loop reaches in front of the motor it
momentarily creates a flap of two bond segments. Three
different transitions are now possible (see Fig.6): (i) the
motor’s position remains unaltered while the two open
segments close, (ii) the motor moves forward by one step
while one segment of the flap closes; (iii) the motor moves
forward by two steps and the flap cannot close. The rate
for the process (i) is kb /2 irrespective of the “chemical”
state of the motor. However, the rates of the processes
(ii) and (iii) depend on whether the motor was in the
“chemical” state 1 or 2. If the motor is in the state 2, the

rate of the process (ii) is given by ((ω12

f −1
that of the process (iii) is given by ((ω12 ) + (ω21 )−1 +

We define the survival probability Sµ,n (t) to be the
probability that the CRE has not yet reached the far
end of the footprint till time t, given that initially (at
t = 0) there were n intact contacts between the histone
spool and the DNA on the footprint in front of the CRE
motor. Obviously, Sµ,n (t) is the solution of the equations

The master equations (29)-(30) together, effectively, correspond to the kinetic scheme shown in the Fig. 7. Using
this scheme, the MFTT for the single CRE motor can
be calculated analytically by extending the theoretical
framework developed in ref.[39] for calculating the mean
first-passage time of random walks.
Following Pury and Caceres [39], the MFTT is given

by

Tµ,n =

Sµ,n (t)dt

(31)

Since Sµ,n (∞) = 0 and Sµ,n (0) = 1, integrating the equa-

8
tions (29) and (30) with respect to t, we get

Using (43) in (44) we, finally, get

Defining
∆µ,n = Tµ,n+1 − Tµ,n ,
δn = T2,n − T1,n

(34)

equations (32) and (33) can be expressed as

Now, in the special case

(37)

equations (35) and (36) become

+
Bn = {rn b+

Since it is not easy to get an intuitive feeling for the
implications of the expression (45), we anaylyze its special simpler forms in some limiting cases. In the limit
f
of extremely slow motor, i.e., ω12
→ 0, as expected, the
expression (45) for the MFTT td diverges.
For ensuring high-speed of the CRE motor, we need
f
/kb >> 1 and w21 /kb >> 1. If, for
simultaneously w12
f
simplicity, we make the additional assumption that w12
f
is the slower of the two, i.e., ω21 >> ω12
, we have f0 =
f1 = g0 = g1 ≃ 0 and f2 ≃ 1, and g2 ≃ 1. Hence, in this
limit, Bn = 0 for n ≤ N and, therefore,
N
X
Cn
≃ N/ku
td =

n=1 n

(46)

which is identical to the corresponding limiting value of
td reported in ref.[29]. This is a consequence of the fact
that in the limit of extremely fast motor, because of the
assumption of very large value of ω21 , the 2-state model
reduces to an effectively 1-state model. We make a numerical estimate of td in this limit by computing an approximate value of ku . Defining
K = kb /ku

(39)

Next, multiplying equation (38) by (sn + Fn ) and Eq.
(39) by rn , and then adding the resulting equations, we
get

∆n−1 =

td =

(47)

as the flap binding constant, we can rewrite the equation
(46) as
td =

NK
kb

(48)

Range of typical values of K has been used earlier by
Chou [29]. Using this range of values for K, one can
estimate ku , provided a typical value of kb is known.
Therefore, we now estimate the typical numerical values of kb following Schiessel and coworkers [16–18]. Suppose, L0 (≃ 50 nm) be the length of the DNA that wraps
′
around the histone spool. Let L + dL be the contour
length of the loop induced by′ spontaneous thermal fluctuations where (see Fig. 8) L is the exposed arc length
on the histone spool that was covered by the DNA segment prior to the loop formation and dL is a small segment of the linker dsDNA that has been pulled into the
loop.
We assume that the life time of a loop (τ ) is much
shorter than the average time required to form a loop.
Following Schiessel et al. [16–18] we write down the rate
of loop formation as
α≃

L0 exp(−Ebend /(kB T ))
τ L′

Comparing Eqs. (1) and (49) we obtain

FIG. 8: Top view of the histone octamer bound with DNA.
Loop formation involving length dL of linker chain being incorporated into the nucleosome, with length L′ of the exposed
surface. (adapted from Fig. 2 of ref. [16]).

Since τ −1 = k characterizes the rate of unbiased diffusion
L2
of the loop around the histone spool [16] τ ≃ D0 where
D is the corresponding diffusion constant. From
Stokes′
Einstein relation D = kB T /ζ, where ζ ≃ ηL [16] and η is
the effective viscosity of the aqueous medium. Combining
all the results and substituting these into Eq. (50) we
finally obtain
kb =

kB T
ηL0 (L′ )2

(51)

The
estimation can be completed only if an estimate of
′
L is available. Following ref. [16] (Eq. (2a) of [16]), we
get
′

L ≃(

20π 4 κ 1/6
) (dL/R0 )1/3 R0 ,
λR02

(52)

where κ is the bending elastic constant of the semiflexiable DNA chain, λ is the adsorption energy per unit
length and R0 is the radius of the histone spool. Using the reasonable values quoted in ref.[16–18], namely,
R0 = 5nm, κ = 207.10pN − nm2 , dL =′ 3.40nm and
λ = 5.92pN we obtain from Eq. (52) L = 16.43nm.
′
using this estimate of L , together with 1kB T = 4.142
pN-nm, L0 = 500Å, and η = 1 Centipoise, we obtain
from Eq. (51) kb = 306877.4s−1.
With the above estimated value of kb , and N = 15
from Eq. (48) we get the estimates td = 0.000024s for
K = 0.5 and td = 0.0005s for K = 10. Such small
values of td , estimated from Eq.46, arise from the fact
that the approximate form (46) is valid only in the limit
of extremely fast motor. Therefore, this limiting formula
provides only a lower bound and does not correspond to
real CRE motors under physiological conditions.
In Fig.9 we plot the normalized MFTT td α/N as
f
a function of the normalized motor speed ω12
/α for
ω12 /α = ω21 /α = 0.5 and a few fixed values of the parameter K. For any fixed value of K, the normalized
MFTT decreases monotonically with the increase of the
normalized motor speed and saturates to the value given

FIG. 9: Normalized MFTT αN −1 td plotted against the norf
malized motor speed ω12
/α for different values of K with
ω12 /α = ω21 /α = 0.5.

f
by equation (46) in the limit ω12
/α → ∞. Moreover, for
f
a given value of ω12 /α, as the flap binding constant K
increases the MFTT increases.
f
In Fig.10, td is plotted against ω12
/α for (a) K = 10,
ω12 /α = 0.8, and (b) K = 10, ω12 /α = 0.1, each for a
few distinct values of ω21 /α. The MFTT decreases as
ω21 /α increases. This is a consequence of the fact that
ω21 depends on the ATP concentration. For small ω12 /α
reduces the amplitude of peeling time.
In Fig.11 we demonstrate that for large value of ω21 /α,
which effectively speeds up the motor, reduces the magnitude of the MFTT.
Although the qualitative trends of variations of td with
f
ω12
/α in our model is similar to that in Chou’s model
[29], wide range of variation of td is possible in our model
by controlling ω21 which, in turn, can be controlled by
the ATP concentration.
In order to explore the dependence of td on the concentration of ATP, we first assume that
0
ω21 = ω21
[AT P ]

(53)

0
Assuming a typical value ω21
= 106 M −1 s−1 , we have
plotted the normalized MFTT against the ATP concentration for two different normalized values of the unhindreed motor speed keeping the other parameters fixed.
With the increase of ATP concentration, the MFTT decreases and, gradulally saturates. When ATP concentration is sufficiently high, the step with rate constant ω21
is no longer rate-limiting. We also find that, for a given
f
ATP concentration, the higher is the value of ω12
/α the
shorter is the MFTT td .
The linear dependence of ω21 on ATP concentration,
as envisaged in (53), may be valid only at sufficiently
low concentration of ATP. In general, ω21 may follow
the usual Michaelis-Menten equation for the rate of enzymatic reactions (because ω21 represents the rate of ATP
hydrolysis catalyzed by the CRE motor) [40]. In that
case ω21 itself would saturate with the increase of ATP
concentration, instead of increasing linearly with [ATP].

In this paper we have studied the process of ATPdependent chromatin remodeling. For simplicity, we have
considered only a single nucleosome consisting of a dsDNA strand wrapped one and three-fourth turns around
a cylindrical spool made of histone proteins. We have
extended Chou’s model [29] by assigning two distinct
“chemical” states to the CRE and postulating a minimal
mechano-chemical kinetic scheme for capturing the effects of ATP hydrolysis explicitly. Our theoretical framework has been developed exploiting a close analogy with
the unzipping of a double-stranded DNA by a helicase
[38]. We have written down the master equations for
the postulated kinetic scheme. This model of footprint
traversal by ATP-dependent CRE can be easily interpreted as an implementation of a Brownian ratchet mechanism. From an analytical treatment of this stochastic
kinetic model, we have derived analytical expression for
the MFTT of the ATP-dependent CRE. We make explicit
analytical predictions on the dependence of the MFTT on
(i) the unhindred speed of the CRE, as well as on (ii) the
