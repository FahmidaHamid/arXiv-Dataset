Abstract

13

The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) is a unified theory of biodiversity that

14

predicts a large number of macroecological patterns using only information on the species

15

richness, total abundance, and total metabolic rate of the community. We evaluated four major

16

predictions of METE simultaneously at an unprecedented scale using data from 60 globally

17

distributed forest communities including over 300,000 individuals and nearly 2000 species.

18

METE successfully captured 96% and 89% of the variation in the species abundance distribution

19

and the individual size distribution, but performed poorly when characterizing the size-density

20

relationship and intraspecific distribution of individual size. Specifically, METE predicted a

21

negative correlation between size and species abundance, which is weak in natural communities.

22

By evaluating multiple predictions with large quantities of data, our study not only identifies a

23

mismatch between abundance and body size in METE, but also demonstrates the importance of

24

conducting strong tests of ecological theories.

Introduction
The structure of ecological communities can be quantified using a variety of

27

relationships, including many of the most well-studied patterns in ecology such as the

28

distribution of individuals among species (the species abundance distribution or SAD), the

29

increase of species richness with area (the species area relationship or SAR), and the

30

distributions of energy consumption and body size (Brown 1995; Rosenzweig 1995; McGill et

31

al. 2007; White et al. 2007). With the increasing consensus that these patterns are not fully

32

independent, a growing number of unified theories have been proposed to identify links between

33

the patterns and unite them under a single framework (e.g., Hanski and Gyllenberg 1997;

34

Hubbell 2001; Harte 2011; see McGill 2010 for a review). Among these unified theories there

35

are generally two different approaches, one based on processes and the other based on

36

constraints. With the process-based approach, characteristics of the community are captured by

37

explicitly modeling a few key ecological processes (e.g., Hanski and Gyllenberg 1997; Hubbell

38

2001). While this approach has the potential to directly establish connection between patterns

39

and processes, it has been found that the same empirical patterns can result from different

40

processes (Cohen 1968; Pielou 1975), and process-specific parameters are often hard to obtain

41

(Hubbell 2001; Jones and Muller-Landau 2008). Alternatively, the constraint-based approach

42

suggests that many macroecological patterns are emergent statistical properties arising from

43

general constraints on the system, while processes are only indirectly incorporated through their

44

effect on the constraints (e.g., Harte 2011; Locey and White 2013). This approach attempts to

45

provide a general explanation of the observed patterns that does not rely on specific processes,

46

which allows predictions to be made with little detailed information about the system.

47

One of the newest and most parsimonious constraint-based approaches is the Maximum

48

Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE; Harte et al. 2008; Harte et al. 2009; Harte 2011). METE

49

adopts the Maximum Entropy Principle from information theory, which identifies the most likely

50

(least biased) state of a system given a set of constraints (Jaynes 2003). Assuming that the

51

allocation of individuals and energy consumption within a community is constrained by three

52

state variables (total species richness, total number of individuals, and total energy

53

consumption), METE makes predictions for the SAD as well as multiple patterns related to

54

energy use. Spatial patterns such as the SAR and the endemics area relationship can also be

55

predicted with an additional constraint on the area sampled (Harte et al. 2008; Harte et al. 2009;

56

Harte 2011). METE is one of the growing number of theoretical approaches that attempt to

57

synthesize traditionally distinct areas of macroecology dealing with the distributions of

58

individuals and the distributions of energy and biomass (Dewar and Porté 2008; Morlon et al.

59

2009; O’Dwyer et al. 2009), and thus provides a very general characterization of the structure of

60

ecological systems. With no tunable parameters and no specific assumptions about biological

61

processes, it can potentially be applied to any community where the values of the state variables

62

can be obtained.

63

Previous studies have evaluated the performance of METE with separate datasets for

64

different patterns and have shown that METE generally provides good characterizations of these

65

patterns across geographical locations and taxonomic groups (Harte et al. 2008; Harte et al.

66

2009; Harte 2011; White et al. 2012a; McGlinn et al. 2013). However, these tests are relatively

67

weak as they focus on one pattern at a time (McGill 2003). As a unified theory with multiple

68

predictions, METE allows stronger tests to be made by testing the ability of the theory to

69

characterize multiple patterns simultaneously for the same data (McGill 2003; McGill et al.

70

2006). In this study, we conduct a strong test of the non-spatial predictions of METE using data

71

from 60 globally distributed forest communities to simultaneously evaluate four predictions of

72

the theory (Fig. 1) including the SAD (the distribution of individuals among species) and

73

energetic analogs of the individual size distribution (ISD; the distribution of body size among

74

individuals regardless of their species identity) (Enquist and Niklas 2001; Muller-Landau et al.

75

2006), the size-density relationship (SDR; the correlation between species abundance and

76

average individual size within species) (Cotgreave 1993), and the intraspecific individual size

77

distribution (iISD; the distribution of body size among individuals within a species) (Gouws et

78

al. 2011). Our analysis shows mixed support for METE across its four predictions, with METE

79

successfully capturing the variation in two patterns while failing for the other two. We discuss

80

the ecological implications of our findings, as well as the importance of conducting strong multi-

81

pattern tests in the evaluation of ecological theories.

82

Methods

83

1. Predicted patterns of METE

84

METE assumes that allocation of individuals and energy consumption within a

85

community is constrained by three state variables: species richness (S0), total number of

86

individuals (N0), and total metabolic rate summed over all individuals in the community (E0)

87

(Harte et al. 2008; Harte et al. 2009; Harte 2011). Define R(n, ε) as the joint probability that a

88

species randomly picked from the community has abundance n and an individual randomly

89

picked from such a species has metabolic rate between (ε, ε +∆ε), two constraints are then

90

established on the ratio between the state variables:

which represents the average total metabolic rate per species. Note that the lower limit of

95

individual metabolic rate is set to be 1, and all measures of metabolic rate are rescaled

96

accordingly.
The forms of the four macroecological patterns that METE predicts can then be derived

97
98

from R(n, ε) (see Harte 2011 and Appendix A for detailed derivation) and are given by the

which is an upper-truncated Fisher’s log-series distribution. Here λ1 and λ2 are Lagrange

102

multipliers obtained by applying the Maximum Entropy Principle with respect to the constraints,

103

and C is the proper normalization constant. The Individual-level Energy Distribution (which is

104

the energetic equivalent of the ISD) takes the form

115

METE predicts the iISD to be an exponential distribution (Eqn 5; also see Fig. 1D) where

116

the smallest size class is the most abundant, regardless of species identity or abundance.

117

However, most animal species exhibit interior modes of adult body size (e.g., Koons et al. 2009;

118

Gouws et al. 2011; but see Harte 2011) and large variation in minimum (and maximum) body

119

size among species associated with these modal values (Gouws et al. 2011). In other words, the

120

body sizes of conspecifics are clustered around some intermediate value, while individuals that

121

are much larger or smaller are rare. Consequently, assembling all individuals across species in

122

such communities often yields multimodal ISD (Thibault et al. 2011), as opposed to

123

monotonically decreasing predicted by METE (Eqn 4; also see Fig. 1B). As such animal

124

communities are expected a priori to violate two of the predictions of METE. Therefore, to

125

ensure that the performance of METE was not trivially rejected because of the life history trait of

126

determinate growth, in our analysis we focused exclusively on trees, which are known to have

127

iISDs (Condit et al. 1998) and ISDs (Enquist and Niklas 2001; Muller-Landau et al. 2006) that

128

are well characterized by monotonically declining distributions and which arguably have the

129

greatest prevalence of high quality individual level size data among indeterminately growing

130

taxonomic groups.

131

We compiled forest plot data from previous publications, publicly available databases,

132

and data obtained through personal communication (Table 1). All plots have been fully surveyed

133

with size measurement for all individuals above plot-specific minimum thresholds. For those

134

plots where surveys have been conducted multiple times, we adopted data from the most recent

135

one unless otherwise specified (see Table 1). Individuals that were dead, not identified to

136

species/morphospecies, and/or missing size measurements were excluded. Individuals with size

137

measurements below or equal to the designated minimum thresholds were excluded as well,

138

because it is unclear whether these size classes were thoroughly surveyed. Overall our analysis

139

encompassed 60 plots that were at least 1 ha in size and had a richness of at least 14 (Table 1),

140

with 1943 species/morphospecies and 379022 individuals in total.

141

3. Analyses

142

The scaling relationship between diameter and metabolic rate can be described with good

143

approximation by metabolic theory as 4 5 61 ·  /89 , where B is metabolic rate, D is diameter,

144

T is temperature, E is the activation energy, and k is the Boltzmann’s constant (West et al. 1999;

145

Gillooly et al. 2001). Assuming that E is constant across species and T is constant within a

146

community, the temperature-dependent term e-E/kT is constant within a community, and can be

147

dropped when the metabolic rate of individuals are rescaled. We thus used (D/Dmin)2 as the

148

surrogate for individual metabolic rate, where Dmin is the diameter of the smallest individual in

149

the community, which sets the minimal individual metabolic rate to be 1 following METE’s

150

assumption (see Eqn 2). Applying alternative models that more accurately capture nonlinearities

151

between diameter, mass and metabolic rate did not have any qualitative effect on our results

152

(Appendix B). For individuals with multiple stems, we adopted the pipe model to combine the

153

records, i.e., 6  :∑ ;1 , where di’s were diameter of individual stems (Ernest et al. 2009). Since

154

metabolic rate scales as D2, the pipe model preserves the total area as well as the total metabolic

155

rate for all stems combined.

156

We obtained the Lagrange multipliers λ1 and λ2 in each community with inputs S0, N0,

157

and E0 (i.e., the sum over the rescaled individual metabolic rates) (see Appendix A). Predictions

158

for the four ecological patterns were obtained from Eqns 3-6 and further transformed to facilitate

159

comparison with observations. For the SAD and the ISD, we converted the predicted probability

160

distributions (Eqns 3 & 4) to rank distributions of abundance (i.e., abundance at each rank from

161

the most abundant species to the least abundant species) and size (i.e., scaled metabolic rate at

162

each rank from the largest individual to the smallest individual across all species) (Harte et al.

163

2008; Harte 2011; White et al. 2012a), which were compared with the empirical rank

164

distributions of abundance and size. For the SDR, predicted average metabolic rate was obtained

165

from Eqn 6 for species with abundance n, which was compared to the observed average

166

metabolic rate for that species. For the iISD, we converted the predicted exponential distribution

167

(Eqn 5) into a rank distribution of individual size for each species, and compared the scaled

168

metabolic rate predicted at each rank to the observed value. Alternative analyses for the two

169

continuous distributions, the ISD and the iISD, did not change our results (Appendix C).

170
171
172

The explanatory power of METE for each pattern was quantified using the coefficient of
determination R2, which was calculated as

(7)

173

where obsi and predi were the ith observed value and METE’s prediction, respectively. Both

174

observed and predicted values were log-transformed for homoscedasticity. Note that R2 measures

175

the proportion of variation in the observation explained by the prediction; it is based on the 1:1

176

line when the observed values are plotted against the predicted values, not the regression line.

177

Thus it is possible for R2 to be negative, which is an indication that the prediction is worse than

178

taking the average of the observation.

179

Results

180

The results for all forest plots combined are summarized in Fig.2, with observations

181

plotted against predictions for each macroecological pattern. METE provides excellent

182

predictions for the SAD (R2 = 0.96) and the ISD (R2 = 0.89), though the largest size classes

183

deviate slightly but consistently in the ISD. However, the SDR (R2 = -2.24) and the iISD (R2 =

184

0.15) are not well characterized by the theory.

185

Further examination of the four macroecological patterns within each community

186

(Appendix D, Fig. A4; also see insets in Fig. 2) confirms METE’s ability to consistently

187

characterize the SAD (all R2 values > 0.60, 59/60 R2 values > 0.8) and the ISD (all R2 values >

188

0.48, 49/60 R2 values > 0.8), as well as its inadequacy in characterizing the SDR (all R2 values

189

below zero) and the iISD (maximal R2 = 0.30, 49/60 R2 values < 0).

190

Discussion

191

Macroecological theories increasingly attempt to make predictions across numerous

192

ecological patterns (McGill 2010), by either directly modeling ecological processes or imposing

193

constraints on the system. Among the constraint-based theories, METE is unique in that it makes

194

simultaneous predictions for two distinct sets of ecological patterns, synthesizing traditionally

195

separate areas of macroecology dealing with distributions of individuals and distributions related

196

to body size and energy use (see also Dewar and Porté 2008; Morlon et al. 2009; O’Dwyer et al.

197

2009). Using only information on the species richness, total abundance, and total energy use as

198

inputs, METE attempts to characterize various aspects of community structure without tunable

199

parameters or additional assumptions, making it one of the most parsimonious of the current

200

unified theories.

201

Our analysis shows that METE accurately captures the general form of the SAD

202

(allocation of individuals among species) and ISD (allocation of energy/biomass among

203

individuals) within and among 60 forest communities (Fig. 2A, B; Fig. A4). The SAD and the

204

ISD are among the most well-studied patterns in ecology, and numerous models exist for both

205

patterns. For instance, with metabolic theory and demographic equilibrium models, Muller-

206

Landau et al. (2006) identified four possible predictions for the ISD under different assumptions

207

of growth and mortality rates. For the SAD more than twenty models have been proposed

208

(Marquet et al. 2003; McGill et al. 2007), ranging from purely statistical to mechanistic.

209

Our study demonstrates METE’s high predictive power for these two patterns, but it does

210

not imply that it is the best model when each pattern is considered independently. Indeed, our

211

results reveal a slight but consistent departure of individuals in the largest size class from the ISD

212

predicted by METE, which may result from mortality unrelated to energy use (Muller-Landau et

213

al. 2006). Moreover, while METE does generally outperform the most common model of the

214

species abundance distribution (White et al. 2012a), model comparisons for the ISD using AIC

215

suggest that the maximum likelihood Weibull distribution (one of the distributions for tree

216

diameter in Muller-Landau et al. 2006) almost always outperforms METE (though METE’s

217

performance is comparable to that of the other two distributions, the exponential and the Pareto;

218

see Appendix E). Quantitatively comparing theories that make multiple predictions is

219

challenging and there is no general approach for properly comparing models that make different

220

numbers of predictions. When comparing general theories to single prediction models with

221

tunable parameters it is not surprising that theories such as METE fail to provide the best

222

quantitative fit (White et al. 2012b). However, as a constraint-based unified theory, METE’s

223

strength lies in its ability to link together ecological phenomena that were previously considered

224

distinct, and to make predictions based on first principles with minimal inputs. The agreement

225

between METE’s predictions and the observed SAD and ISD supports the notion that the

226

majority of variation in these macroecological patterns can be characterized by variation in the

227

state variables S0, N0, and E0 alone (Harte 2011; Supp et al. 2012; White et al. 2012a).

While METE performs well in characterizing the SAD and ISD, it performs poorly when

228
229

predicting the distribution of energy at the species level (Fig. 2C, D; Fig. A4). These deviations

230

from the predictions reveal a mismatch between the predicted metabolic rate of individuals and

231

their species’ abundances. METE predicts a monotonically decreasing relationship between

232

species abundance and average intraspecific metabolic rate, i.e., species with higher abundance

233

are also smaller in size on average and are more likely to contain smaller individuals (Eqns 5, 6,

234

Fig. 1C). Evaluating the total (instead of average) intraspecific metabolic rate, this relationship

235

translates roughly into Damuth’s energetic equivalence rule (Damuth 1981), where the total

236

energy consumption within a species does not depend on species identity or abundance (Harte et

237

al. 2008; Harte 2011). While Damuth’s rule has been argued to apply at global scales (Damuth

238

1981; White et al. 2007), our results indicate that it does not hold locally, in concordance with a

239

number of previous studies (Brown and Maurer 1987; Blackburn and Gaston 1997; White et al.

240

2007).

241

The consistency of our results across 60 forest communities (as well as confirmative

242

evidence from a concurrent study of a single herbaceous plant community; Newman et al. in

243

review) provides strong evidence for METE’s mixed performance among the four

244

macroecological patterns. However, several limitations of the study are worth noting. First, we

245

only analyzed a single taxonomic group (trees). This was in part because individual level size

246

data collected in standardized ways is available for a large number of tree communities, and in

247

part based on a prior knowledge that the form of the ISD and the iISD (Condit et al. 1998;

248

Enquist and Niklas 2001; Muller-Landau et al. 2006) had a reasonable chance of being well

249

characterized by the theory (see Methods). While we know that the SAD predictions of the

250

theory perform well in general (White et al. 2012a), further tests are necessary to determine if the

251

simultaneous good fit of the ISD predictions is supported in other taxonomic groups. There is

252

some evidence that this result holds in invertebrate communities (Harte 2011). Second, we

253

estimated the metabolic rate of individuals based on predictions of metabolic theory rather than

254

direct measurement. While our results were not sensitive to the use of other equations used for

255

estimating metabolic rate (Appendix B), it is possible that directly measured metabolic rates

256

could result in different fits to the theory (but see Newman et al. in review, which adopts a

257

different method to obtain metabolic rate yet reaches similar conclusions).

258

Models and theories can be evaluated at multiple levels which yield different strengths of

259

inference (McGill 2003; McGill et al. 2006), progressing from matching theory to empirical

260

observations on a single pattern, to testing against a null hypothesis, to evaluating multiple a

261

priori predictions, to eventually comparing between multiple competing models. With

262

quantitative predictions on various ecological patterns, METE and other unified theories allow

263

for simultaneous examination of multiple predictions, which provides a much stronger test

264

compared to curve-fitting for a single pattern and can often reveal important insight into theories

265

that are otherwise overlooked by single pattern tests (e.g., Adler 2004). As a comprehensive

266

analysis on the performance of METE in predicting abundance and energy distributions in the

267

same datasets, our study demonstrates the importance of moving towards stronger tests in

268

ecology, especially when multiple intercorrelated predictions are available; while previous

269

studies have shown that METE does an impressive job characterizing a single pattern (White et

270

al. 2012a; McGlinn et al. 2013), concurrently evaluating all predictions of the theory identifies a

271

mismatch between species’ abundance and individual size that consistently deviates from

272

empirical patterns.

273

The fact that METE fails to provide good characterization of all four patterns of

274

community structure and performs more poorly than alternative models in some cases can be

275

interpreted in two ways. First, the aspects of community structure that are poorly characterized

276

by the theory may be more adequately characterized by explicitly modeling ecological processes.

277

For example, O’Dwyer et al. (2009) has developed a model that incorporates individual

278

demographic rates of birth, death, and growth, which likewise yields predictions of abundance

279

and body size distributions. It is worth noting, however, that the process-based approach and the

280

constraint-based approach do not have to be mutually exclusive. While O’Dwyer et al. (2009)

281

suggested that size-related patterns may reflect ecological processes, the agreement between their

282

model and METE in the predicted SAD (both log-series), as well as METE’s excellent

283

performance for the ISD, support the idea that information in the underlying processes can be

284

summarized in constraints alone for some macroecological patterns. Alternatively, the constraint-

285

based approach may be sufficient in characterizing patterns of abundance and of body size, but

286

the current form of METE may be incorrect. Specifically, its limitations revealed in our analyses

287

may be remedied by either relaxing the current constraints to remove the association between

288

species level body size and abundance from the theory, or by adding additional constraints to the

289

system so that energetic equivalence among species no longer holds (J. Harte, pers. comm.).

290

While the success of METE in characterizing the SAD and the ISD adds to the growing support

291

for the constraint-based approach for studying macroecological patterns, further work is clearly

292

needed to develop unified theories for community structure whether they are based on specific

293

biological processes or emergent statistical properties.

One plot has a more recent survey in 1998, however it lacks species ID.
We chose Census 2 because information for multiple stems is not available in Census 3, and the unit of diameter is
unclear in Census 4.

We chose survey individually for each plot based on expert opinion to minimize the effect of hurricane

Appendix B. Alternative Scaling Relationship between Diameter and Metabolic Rate
While we converted diameter (D) to metabolic rate (B) with @ A B+ in our analyses,

49
50

alternative relationships between diameter and metabolic rate have been proposed. Specifically,

51

it has been suggested that the aboveground biomass of tropical trees is a function of diameter,

52

wood density, and forest type (Chave et al. 2005), while the relationship between aboveground

53

biomass and metabolic rate is a biphasic, mixed-power function (Mori et al. 2010). Here we

54

demonstrate that adopting this alternative scaling relationship does not quantitatively change our

55

results.

56

We compiled species-specific wood density (wood specific gravity; WSG) from previous

57

publications (Reyes et al. 1992; Chave et al. 2009; Zanne et al. 2009; Wright et al. 2010;

58

Swenson et al. 2012). Since WSG information is not available for every species, we included

59

only communities of tropical forest where no less than 70% of individuals belonged to species

60

with known WSG to ensure the accuracy of our analysis. This criterion was met by five

61

communities (BCI, Cocoli, Plots 4 and 5 in LaSelva, and Luquillo) out of all 60 that we

62

examined. Individuals in these communities for which WSG information were not available were

63

assigned average WSG value across all species in the WSG compilation.

64

We obtained metabolic rate of each individual using the alternative scaling relationships

65

specified in Chave et al. (2005) and Mori et al. (2010). METE was then applied to each

66

community following the steps described in Methods in the main text, and its predictions were

67

compared to the observed values for the ISD, the SDR, and the iISD (Fig. B1). Though the

68

patterns differ slightly in shape with metabolic rates obtained from the alternative method, the

69

explanatory power of METE for each pattern does not change qualitatively, i.e., METE

70

characterizes the ISD with high accuracy but is unable to explain much variation in the SDR or

71

the iISD, regardless of the method used to calculate metabolic rate (compare Fig. B1 with

72

corresponding communities in Fig. D1).

73

Figure B1. METE’s predictions are plotted against observed values for A) SAD (which remains

74

unchanged), B) ISD, C) SDR, and D) iISD for each of the five communities individually. Here

75

the metabolic rate was obtained with alternative scaling method, which slightly changes the

76

shape of the ISD, the size-density relationship, and the iISD, without significant impact on the

77

explanatory power of METE. (See Pages 42 – 46)

78
79

Appendix C. Alternative Analyses for the ISD and the iISD
In our analyses in the main text, we converted all three probability distributions (SAD,

80

ISD, and iISD) into distributions of rank, and compared the predicted values at each rank against

81

the observed values. While this approach has been widely adopted (Harte et al. 2008; Harte

82

2011; White et al. 2012), it may not be entirely adequate for continuous distributions such as the

83

ISD and the iISD, where empirical measurements are usually rounded off to decimals and thus

84

may not be directly comparable to the truly continuous values obtained from the predicted

85

distributions of rank. Here we conduct additional analyses for the ISD and the iISD with

86

alternative approaches directly applied on the probability distributions without converting them

87

to distributions of rank to demonstrate the robustness of our results.

88

For the ISD, we grouped the scaled individual metabolic rates into log(1.7) bins (i.e., 1-

89

1.7, 1.7-2.89, 2.89-4.913, etc.), which resulted in 10 to 21 bins for each forest community. The

90

predicted frequency for each bin was then calculated from the cumulative distribution of Ψ(ε)

91

(Eqn 4 in the main text) and compared with the observed frequency. The predictive power of

92

METE for the ISD does not change qualitatively when the ISD is analyzed as frequencies (R2 =

93

0.93; Fig. C1) instead of as ranked metabolic rates (R2 = 0.89; Fig. 2B in the main text).

94
95

nst empirical observations across 60 communities for

96

97

points are color-coded
coded to reflect the density of neighbouring points, with warm (red) colors

98

representing higher
gher densities and cold (blue) colors representing lower densities. The inset in the

99

lower right corner shows the distribution of R2 among individual communities from below zero

100

(left) to 1 (right).

101
102

The iISDs for most species contain too few individuals for the above analysis with binned

103

frequencies. Instead, we directly looked at the shape of the distribution. METE predicts that the

104

iISD for each species within a community follows an exponential distribution left-truncated
left
at 1,

105

with the parameter of thee distribution proportional to the abundance of the species (see Eqn 5 in

106

main text). Deviation from METE’s prediction can occur in one or both of two ways: 1. The

107

observed iISDs are not well characterized by exponential distributions; 2. Assuming that the

108

iISDs can be characterized by exponential distributions (which may or may not be true), the

109

parameter of the distributions that best capture the observed iISDs differ from those predicted by

110

METE (Eqn 5 in main text). Here we show that METE’s prediction for iISD fails in both aspects,

111

which is consistent with our results in the main text (Fig. 2D).

112

1. Characterizing iISDs with exponential distributions

113

In each community, we fitted an exponential distribution left-truncated at 1 (the minimal

114

rescaled metabolic rate within each community) to rescaled individual metabolic rates for each

115

species with at least 5 individuals, and obtained the maximum likelihood (MLE) parameter of the

116

distribution. For each species, 5,000 independent samples were drawn from a left-truncated

117

exponential distribution with the MLE parameter, where the sample size was equal to the

118

abundance of the species. The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was then applied to

119

evaluate if the empirical iISD differ significantly from each sample drawn from the left-truncated

120

exponential distribution. If the proportion of tests (among all 5,000) where the empirical iISD

121

and the randomly generated sample differ in distribution is higher than the significance level (α)

122

of the tests, the empirical iISD for the focal species does not conform to a left-truncated

123

exponential distribution.

124

Fig. C2 shows a histogram of proportions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests that are

125

significant at α = 0.05 among species (with abundance >= 5) across all 60 communities. Overall

126

the iISDs for more than half of the species are deemed to be significantly different from the left-

127

truncated exponential distribution, which implies that the form of iISD predicted by METE does

128

not hold.

132

Species for which the proportion of tests (among 5,000) with significant results is higher than

133

0.05 have iISDs that differ significantly from the left
left-truncated
truncated exponential distribution.

134

2. Comparing MLE parameter with METE’s predicted parameter

135

We further compared the MLE parameter of left
left-truncated
truncated exponential distribution for

136

each species to the parameter predicted by METE ((λ2n; see Eqn 5 in main text) (Fig.
Fig. C3). Note

137

that this analysis is biased in favor of METE, as we have already shown that left-truncated

138

exponential distribution does not provide a good characterization of empirical iISD for most

139

species (Fig. C2).
). The fact that the R2 for the iISD is below zero even when METE is evaluated

140

with this biased analysis further strengthens our co
conclusion
nclusion that METE is unable to meaningfully

141

capture any variation in the iISD.

154

155

average metabolic rate in the community. The magenta curves in subplots A), B), and C)

156

represent the relationships predicted by METE. In D), the size for each individual within a

157

species predicted by METE is plotted against its observed size, while the diagonal line is the 1:1

158

Appendix E. Model Comparison for ISD

159
160

Muller-Landau et al. (2006) proposed four possible distributions (exponential, Pareto,

161

Weibull, and quasi-Weibull) for diameter in old-growth forests, under different assumptions of

162

growth and mortality. Here we compare the fit of three of the four distributions (exponential,

163

Pareto, and Weibull) to the fit of the ISD predicted by METE (Eqn 8) using data from the 60

164

forest communities. The quasi-Weibull distribution, which has been shown to provide the best fit

165

for the majority of communities (Muller-Landau et al. 2006), is not evaluated due to the

166

difficulty in obtaining its maximum likelihood parameters when it is left-truncated.

167

All distributions are left-truncated to account for the fact that individuals below the

168

minimal threshold in each community where excluded from the datasets. With the minimal size

169

rescaled as 1 across communities (see Methods), the left-truncated exponential distribution takes

170

Parameters in Eqns E1, E2 and E3 were obtained with maximum likelihood method

179

E2, MLE solutions for parameters in Eqn E3 can only be obtained numerically. The three

180

distributions of D were then transformed into distributions of D2 (surrogate for metabolic rate;

181

see Methods) to be consistent with METE’s prediction (Eqn 8) as:

185

The fit of the ISD predicted by METE and the other three distributions was evaluated

186

with Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC; Burnham and Anderson 2002). AICc, a second-order

187

variant of AIC which corrects for finite sample size, was computed for each distribution as

(Burnham and Anderson 2002). Within a community, the distribution with a lower AICc value

192

provides a better fit.

193

Our results show that overall the Weibull distribution provides the best fit for the ISD,

194

which outperforms the other three distributions (i.e., has the smallest AICc value) in 50 out of 60

195

communities. While METE is exceeded by the Weibull distribution in all except 3 communities,

196

its performance is comparable to that of the other two distributions, with METE outperforming

197

the exponential distribution in 24 communities and the Pareto distribution in 33 (Table E1).
