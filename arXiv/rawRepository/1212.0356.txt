Abstract Invasion waves are a fundamental building block of theoretical ecology. In this study we
aim to take the first steps to link propagation failure and fast acceleration of traveling waves to critical transitions (or tipping points). The approach
is based upon a detailed numerical study of various versions of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-PetrovskiiPiscounov (FKPP) equation. The main motivation
of this work is to contribute to the following question: how much information do statistics, collected
by a stationary observer, contain about the speed
and bifurcations of traveling waves? We suggest warning signs based upon closeness to carrying capacity, second-order moments and transients of localized
initial invasions.
Keywords: Critical transitions, invasion waves,
propagation failure, Fisher-KPP, FKPP, SPDE.

1 Introduction
The propagation of waves has been a central topic in
spatial ecology for a long time. A primary motivation
arises from fronts where a new species is introduced
into an environment or an existing species considerably extends its habit. A classical example is the
spread of muskrats in central Europe [77]. Other documented examples are butterflies and bush crickets
in the UK [79] and the cane toad invasion in AusC. Kuehn

tralia [63]. Also bacterial growth [54,26] shows very
similar spreading and wave phenomena. The references in [31,76] contain even more examples.
From a theoretical perspective a first groundbreaking result is the modelling of invasion waves via
reaction-diffusion equations by [22] and Kolmogorov,
Petrovskii, Piscounov [43] (FKPP) who studied the
partial differential equation (PDE)

There are many different aspects that could be included in a reaction-diffusion model which are very
interesting to match theory and experiment; see [31,
33,20,53]. Nevertheless, the basic guiding principles
obtained from simple models are still highly relevant. Here we shall restrict ourselves to the study of
the following stochastic partial differential equation
(SPDE)
∂2u

+ f (u) + ’noise’.

For now, the reader may just think of the classical
FKPP nonlinearity f (u) = u(1 − u) and some noise
process that vanishes at zero-population level; for
more technical details see Sections 3-4. The detailed
choices are discussed later.
The main theme of this paper is the interplay
between invasion waves and so-called critical transitions [71,45]. Basically, critical transitions (or tipping points) are drastic sudden changes in dynamical
systems; for some background and details see Section
2. The first major question is whether (1)-(2) can undergo a ’critical transition’. We discuss this question
from a more technical perspective in Section 2. On a

2

heuristic level, one may just consider a parameter in
(2) that is slowly varying. Suppose that there exists
a wave with positive speed for some parameter range
while the wave is stationary (or reverses direction)
for another parameter range. Whether an invasion
reaches a new habitat or not can have drastically
different consequences so one probably would like to
refer to this situation as a critical transition.
Another case we shall consider in this paper is
the situation where the wave speed becomes infinite
at a special parameter value. Hence, a small parameter variation can cause a dramatically accelerating
invasion wave.
The next step is to check whether early-warning
signs for a critical transition exist. In this context,
changes in vegetation patterns have been the main
motivation recently [41,34]. There are only a few
studies on early-warning signs for spatial systems
[14,13]. In fact, early-warning signs for noisy waves
generated by SPDEs have not been considered yet.
This paper makes a first step in this direction. We
focus on transitions for the wave speed (e.g. propagation failure) as it controls when and where an
invasion front appears. Although some detailed measurements of waves are available [35,51] it is very difficult to obtain precise global empirical information
[31, p.92] about a wave. Here we restrict ourselves
to a single spatial observation location i.e. records
by a single stationary ’ecological observer’ over a
fixed time interval. The general idea that one may
obtain spatial conclusions from local observations is
not new [21]. However, our detailed comparative numerical study of several different variants of (2) with
a focus on local early-warning signs seems to be a
completely new direction; for more details on the numerical methods see Section 5. The main themes and
results from the numerical studies are the following:
(a) A description of the statistics for early-warning
signs in SPDEs with wave propagation failure
based upon closeness to carrying capacity and
second-order moments.
(b) A comparative study of (a) for different noise
types (white, space-time white) and different multiplicative noise nonlinearities (parametric, finitesystem size, etc.).
(c) Investigation of statistics near continuous wave
speed transitions (and their unpredictability) for
Allee effect nonlinearities in the deterministic part
of the FKPP SPDE.

(d) Suggestion of transient minima to analyze wave
propagation failure and wave speed blow-up.
Beyond the technical contributions we also try to
link different methodologies. We combine approaches
from biological invasions, critical transitions, FisherKPP (and Nagumo) waves, SPDEs and numerical
methods. This approach should also be helpful to
link several, mostly distinct, communities such as
theoretical ecology, waves in theoretical physics and
mathematical methods for SPDEs.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2-5
we give brief reviews of the essential facts required
for the remaining part of the paper. Due to the interdisciplinary aspects, the brief reviews seem necessary. Readers familiar with all the background may
forward to Section 6 where the multiplicative noise
case for the FKPP SPDE and statistical warning
signs are studied. The nonlinear noise case is considered in Section 7 and the Allee effect in Section 8.
Section 9 on transient phenomena and the influence
of initial conditions concludes the main part of the
paper. In Section 10 a number of generalizations and
open problems are listed.
2 Background - Critical Transitions
A primary motivation to study critical transitions
(or tipping points) arose from ecology, e.g. due to
the theoretical work of Scheffer and co-workers [73,
72,74]. Then it became clear from many distinct applied problems [71] as well as from abstract mathematical considerations [45,46] that many features for
early-warning signs are generic across many dynamical systems. Recent studies of laboratory [16,82] and
full ecosystem [9] experiments re-inforced this viewpoint.
Here we recall a few aspects of critical transitions
for finite-dimensional systems relevant for this paper. Consider the pitchfork bifurcation normal form
[47, p.282]
dw
= w′ = µw + w3 ,
for w ∈ R, µ ∈ R.
(3)
dt
The homogeneous trivial branch {w = 0} consists of
stable equilibria for µ < 0 and unstable equilibria
for µ > 0 since the linearized system around w = 0
is W ′ = µW with solution W (t) = W (0)eµt . The
bifurcation at µ = 0 is sub-critical with two unstable
√
branches {w = ± −µ} for µ < 0.
Consider a slow parameter variation µ′ = ǫ with
0 < ǫ ≪ 1 and µ(0) < 0. Orbits near the homogeneous branch will reach a neighborhood of (w, µ) =

Warning Signs for Wave Speed Transitions of Noisy Fisher-KPP Invasion Fronts

(0, 0) and then jump away quickly indicating a critical transition [45, Fig.3(c)]. Before the jump the system is slow to recover from perturbations (’slowing
down’) for µ < 0 since W (0)eµt → W (0) as µ → 0
for fixed t. For a deterministic system, it is impossible to measure the slowing-down effect once it starts
tracking the homogeneous branch {w = 0} i.e. it is
exponentially close to w = 0. However, for a stochastic version of (3) given by

s > 0 and s = 0. This illustrates again that global
definitions are intricate [46, Sec.8].
For this paper we simply rely on the intuitive
notion that the transition to a standing wave and
also the transition to wave speed blow-up are important in the context of critical transitions and earlywarning signs.

If the invasion wave spreads towards x = ∞ (s > 0)
and saturates at the carrying capacity u ≡ 1 then
there exists a finite time Ti such that for all T ≥ Ti
we have I(u, T ) = 1. If a slow parameter variation
causes the wave to become stationary (s = 0) then
I(u, T ) = 0 for all T ≥ 0. Although this indicates
how one may define one possible critical transition

since for fixed T > 0 one may have I(u, T ) = 0 for

Initially, the FKPP equation (6) modeled the spread
of genes in a population but it has since become a
paradigmatic model for populations dispersing under the influence of diffusion [59, p.439-444]. Using

4

Christian Kuehn

straightforward [59, p.441-442] to check that heteroclinic orbits from (1, 0) to (0, 0) with u ≥ 0, which
correspond to non-negative traveling waves, can only
exist in the stable node case for wave speeds c ≥ 2.
Since the orbit is directed from u = 1 to u = 0 one
also refers to this situation as the stable state u ≡ 1
invading the unstable state u ≡ 0; see Figure 1(a).
Remark: Wave speeds c > 0 correspond to waves
traveling to the right. However, the FKPP equation
(6) is invariant under the symmetry x → −x so that
a localized initial condition near x = 0 triggers a pair
of fronts, one traveling to the left one to the right.
It is known that the traveling wave solutions to
(6) form the important solution set [30, Thm 1.41.5]. The minimal wave speed c∗F KP P = 2 is the
asymptotic speed of propagation for the FKPP nonlinearity [4]. Since the wave speed is determined by
the linearized problem

(8)

at the leading edge near (u, v) = (0, 0) as detailed
in [81, p.38-42] one also refers to the traveling wave
with c∗F KP P = 2 as a pulled front. For a more general
nonlinearity f (u; µ) pushed fronts can exist where
the asymptotic wave speed c is larger than the linear
spreading speed c∗ [81, p.56]. The wave speed for
both types is asymptotic and only achieved after a
transient period. For pulled fronts the asymptotic
expansion yields [81, p.78]

with explicitly computable positive constants k1,2 >
0. Hence, the wave speed is approached from below
by a power law for pulled fronts. For pushed fronts
the convergence to the asymptotic speed is exponentially fast [81, p.74]. Another correction occurs when
a cutoff for the reaction term is introduced [7] which
leads to a logarithmic correction term. Furthermore,
if an initial condition does not decay fast enough
as |x| → ∞ then faster speeds than c∗ occur [81,
p.46]. In particular, for an initial condition decaying like O(e−α|x| ) for α > 0 the speed increases as
c(α) = O(1/α) as α → 0 [70].
The results for invasion fronts of the FKPP equation already indicate that the variety of scaling behaviors could be ideal to determine early-warnings.
In fact, wave spreading in the stochastic case is even
more intricate [48,49].

As a stochastic generalization of (5) the intuitive
idea is to consider the equation
∂2u
∂u
= D 2 + µf (u) + g(u)η(x, t)
∂t
∂x

(9)

where η(x, t) formally represents the ’noise’. Here we
consider two choices for the term η(x, t). The simplest is to consider a real-valued (1D) Brownian motion B(t) [17, Chapter 8] with mean E[B(t)] = 0 and
covariance E[B(t)B(s)] = min(t, s) for 0 ≤ s ≤ t.
Then white noise can be defined via η(x, t) = η(t) =
Ḃ where the derivative is with respect to time and
interpreted in the generalized sense [3, p.52-53]. The
covariance is E[η(t)η(s)] = δ(t−s) and one may then
write (9) in two equivalent forms

The existence and regularity theory of (10) is well
understood [23]. If the noise should depend on space
and time the theory is substantially more involved.
One possibility is to consider a Hilbert space U
(e.g. L2 (R)) and a symmetric non-negative linear
operator Q acting on U and define a U -valued QWiener process W (t). If T r(Q) < +∞ there exists a
complete orthonormal system {fk }∞
k=1 such that
Qfk = λk fk ,

for k ∈ N

where {λk }∞
k=1 is a nonnegative bounded sequence.
Then one may use the convergent sequence
W (t) =

(11)

Bk (t) as a definition [66, p.86-89]. As expected one
has E[W (t)] = 0 and E[W (t)W (s)] = min(t, s)Q so
that Q can be viewed as the covariance operator. In
this case one may formally write (9) as looking for
u = u(·, t) in the form

(12)

which can be interpreted in a precise integral form
[66, Section 5.1]. A well-developed existence theory
for (12) is available [66, Thm 7.4, Thm 7.6].
One is tempted to take Q = Id to mirror the
finite-dimensional case to obtain a ’white noise’ process. However, Q = Id is not of trace-class (since

Warning Signs for Wave Speed Transitions of Noisy Fisher-KPP Invasion Fronts

T r(Q) = +∞) and the series (11) does not converge.
However, one may construct a cylindrical Wiener
process for Q = Id [66, p.96-99] and characterize
space-time white noise as Ẇ = η(x, t) which has
covariance E[η(x, t)η(y, s)] = δ(x − y)δ(t − s). The
existence and regularity theory for space-time white
noise is slightly more involved and already leads to
problems if x ∈ R2 [10, p.54]. Since we exclusively
restrict to x ∈ R these problems do not arise here
and the existence theory works [29, Section 6.1].
Remark: Instead of viewing the equation on function spaces one may also consider an approach [84]
where the solution u = u(x, t) is a real-valued random field which is a basically equivalent [39] approach. In this case, one has E[W (x, t)W (y, s)] =
min(t, s) min(x, y) and that space-time white noise

is ∂x∂t
5 Background - Numerical SPDEs
First, we briefly review basic methods to solve the
SPDE (12) numerically for space-time white noise.
The case (10) will follow as a special case. A natural
first step is to start with a spatial discretization [37].
Consider a finite interval [x1 , xN ] ⊂ R for some N >
1 and augment (12) with zero, reflective or periodic
boundary conditions. Define (∆x) := (xN − x1 )/N
and consider the numerical solution Uj (t) ≈ u(x1 +
(j − 1)(∆x), t). Then the space-discrete version of
(12) is a system of stochastic ordinary differential
equations (SODEs)

for j = 1, 2, . . . , N where {Bj }N
k=1 are independent
one-dimensional Brownian motions and the N × N
matrix L depends on the boundary conditions. For
reflection conditions [24] it follows that Ljj = −2 if
j ∈ {2, 3, . . . , N − 1}, L11 = −1 = LN N , Lij = 1
if |i − j| = 1 and Lij = 0 otherwise. For periodic
conditions [24] one uses Ljj = −2 for all j, L1N =
1 = LN 1 , Lij = 1 if |i−j| = 1 and Lij = 0 otherwise.

obeys Ljj = −2 for j ∈ {2, 3, . . . , N − 1}, Lij = 1 if
|i − j| = 1 and Lij = 0 otherwise. For the simpler
case (10) one has a single Brownian √
motion so that
Bj = B for all j and the factor 1/ ∆x in (13) is
removed [24].
It remains to solve the SODE (13) which can be
more compactly written as
dU = F (U )dt + G(U )dB

(14)

where we view F (U ) = (F1 (U ), . . . , FN (U ))T , B =
(dB1 , . . . , dBN )T as (column) vectors and G(U ) is
a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries Gjj (U ). As
a numerical scheme we shall always use either use
the Euler-Maruyama method [32] or the the Milstein
method in its explicit [42, p.345-351] or implicit [42,
p.399-404] form stated below.
Remark: The Milstein method is usually good
as an exploratory tool due to its robustness. It has
strong order-one convergence [42, Thm 10.3.5]. It
is relatively straightforward to implement the Milstein method as no multiple stochastic integral evaluations occur since x ∈ R [42, Chapter 10-11][38,
p.2]. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that
it nicely extends to multiplicative trace-class noise
[38]. Hence, the Milstein method provides a quite
remarkable compromise between theoretical error estimates and practical implementation issues; see also
[32] for a computational introduction with test codes
for scalar problems. The Euler-Maruyama method is
faster but not as robust so it complements Milsteinmethods nicely if many sample paths have to be calculated for a well-understood parameter regime.
To state both schemes consider t ∈ [0, T ] and define (∆t) := T /K for some fixed K ∈ N. Denote
the numerical solution by U k ≈ U (k(∆t)) where k ∈
{0, 1, 2, . . . , K} and let (∆B k ) = B((k + 1)(∆t)) −
B(k(∆t)) denote a vector of N (0, ∆t) normally distributed independent increments used at the k-th
time step. The explicit Euler-Maruyama method is
given by
Ujk+1 = Ujk + ∆t Fj (U k ) + Gjj (U k ) (∆B k )j

(15)

for each component j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }. The explicit
Milstein scheme for (14) - with diagonal noise matrix
G - is given by [42, p.348,(3.12)]
Ujk+1 = Ujk + ∆t Fj (U k ) + Gjj (U k ) (∆B k )j


∂G
+ 21 Gjj (U k ) ∂Ujjj (U k ) (∆B k )2j − ∆t .

(16)

For non-diagonal noise satisfying a suitable commutativity condition the scheme is still quite simple [42,

6

p.348,(3.16)] while for more general cases one has to
be careful [38]. The implicit version of the Milstein
scheme for our problem is [42, p.400]
Ujk+1 = Ujk + ∆t Fj (U k+1 ) + Gjj () (∆B k )j


(17)
∂G
+ 12 Gjj () ∂Ujjj () (∆B k )2j − ∆t

where we have the choice to make the scheme fullyimplicit with  = U k+1 or semi-implicit with  =
U k . Since the deterministic drift term F causes the
stability problems if D(∆t) > (∆x)2 [24, p.64,67] it
makes sense to chose the semi-implicit version. The
algebraic problem to solve for U k+1 in (17) can be
solved using standard techniques such as Newton’s
method.
It should be noted that the convergence and error estimate of the numerical scheme do not immediately yield error estimates for quantitative properties or scaling laws of traveling waves for the FKPP
equation. For example, it has been demonstrated [18,
p.71] that for pulled fronts of a discretized deterministic FKPP (D = 1 = µ) the speed given to leadingorder by

1
(∆x)2 + · · · .
(18)
12
A similar effect is expected for the stochastic FKPP
equation and properties such as the diffusion properties of the wave speed. Therefore, we have to view numerical scaling laws as approximations which carry
some information about the discretization step sizes
∆x and ∆t. To minimize this effect, the formula (18),
the stability requirement ∆t < (∆x)2 and the goal to
minimize computation time indicate that we should
choose ∆t only slightly smaller than (∆x)2 .
We are not interested in computing the exact
wave speed, only its trend under parameter variation
will be relevant here. A simple method to compute
an upper bound ĉ on the wave speed for the initial
condition u(0, 0) = 1 and u(x, 0) = 0 for a stochastic
wave is to collect the set of points (j ∆x, k ∆t) such
that u(j ∆x, k ∆t) is less and u((j − 1) ∆x, k ∆t) is
bigger than a threshold (usually we pick the threshold as 0.05). For each point one computes the estimate c ≈ ∆x/∆t and obtains ĉ as the maximum.
c∗ = 2 − 2(∆t) +

6 Linear Multiplicative Noise
The first stochastic version of the FKPP equation we
consider was studied by Elworthy, Zhao and Gaines
[19,24] and is given by

(19)

with one-dimensional time-dependent white noise Ḃ,
a small parameter 0 < µ ≪ 1 and noise strength
ǫ̂ > 0. The multiplicative noise can be motivated
e.g. by the interaction of a population u with the
environment [78] or by parameter noise in the deterministic part [68, p.8] such as a fluctuating growth
rate [83]. A multiplicative noise term of the form
g(u) = u has also been used in a model for plankton spreading [52, eq.(4b)]. For further mathematical
background on SPDEs of the form (19) we refer to
Section 4.
It is proven in [19] that there are three major
regimes for (19) depending upon the noise strength
parameter ǫ̂. For some κ = O(1) as µ → 0, the cases
ǫ̂ ∼ κ/µ2 , ǫ̂ ∼ κ/µ and ǫ̂ ∼ κ are identified as the
strong, mild and weak noise regimes respectively.
Elworthy, Zhao and Gaines prove and numerically
demonstrate that for weak noise the wave propagation of the pulled front is basically unaffected while
the wave fails to propagate in the strong noise regime
[19, Thms 8.1-8.3]. In the
√ mild noise regime the wave
speed is decreased as 2 − κ [24, p.65]. It is important to note that the spontaneous collapse of newlyintroduced alien populations, which can occur in a
strong noise regime, has been considered from an
applied perspective in [76].
Using the scaling law of Brownian motion and
the transformation

as discussed in Section 3, in the SPDE (19) yields

(20)

This gives the quite natural view that ǫ ≫ 1, ǫ ∼ 1
and ǫ ≪ 1 are the strong, mild and weak noise
regimes. Figure 1 shows typical solutions for the three
regimes; for details on the numerical methods see
Section 5. The initial condition is taken as the introduction of a species at a particular fixed location so
that

It is understood that the numerical initial condition
is obtained by choosing a mesh having a mesh point
x = 0 with u(0, 0) = 1.
Now consider the situation of the ’ecological observer’ who can only measure the invasion wave at
one particular point in space. Based on the results by

Elworthy, Zhao and Gaines [19,24] on propagation
failure of the wave with increasing noise strength it
is intuitive that the local statistics recorded at a fixed
point carry information about the traveling front.
For convenience we pick the point as x = 0. Consider a single sample path u(0, t). Let T denote the

Figure 2 shows an average of ū over 200 sample paths
which we denote by Ū . From the results it is becoming clear, once one compares the Ū plot with the
ĉ plot, that a decreasing mean population size does
provide the expected early-warning sign for a decreased invasion front speed. We also simulated the
same case shown in Figure 2 for space-time white
noise Ẇ in (20). The results are qualitatively similar with a slight quantitative shift towards faster
waves at comparable noise strength.
In both cases a relevant new result is that also
the local fluctuations captured by the variance show
a quite interesting behavior. Consider the scenario
where the actual carrying capacity for the population is unknown. In this case, the population level
ū is insufficient to determine how far we are from
propagation failure of the wave. Naively, one may
interpret small population fluctuations as an indicator for a fast propagating wave but Figure 2 shows
that it could equally well be a very slow propagating
wave for a low population level. Hence one has to
increase or decrease the noise strength to probe to
which part of Figure 2 the observations match.

7 Nonlinear Multiplicative Noise
As pointed out at the beginning of Section 6, the
noise terms ǫuḂ and ǫuẆ could be interpreted as

parametric or environmental noise. Another possible
source of noise is ’individual-based’ or ’finite-systemsize’ which we shall focus on in this section. Müller

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the population
level, its fluctuations and the wave speed on the parameter ǫ. The results are very similar to Figure 2
with propagation failure for higher noise level as expected from (23). In particular, the conclusions from
Section 6 about inferring wave propagation properties from local data still apply. One may conjecture
that the conclusions might apply to even more general versions of the FKPP equation with a noise term
ǫg(u)Ẇ (or ǫg(u)Ḃ) as long as g(0) = 0.
However, the SPDEs (20) and (24) have noise
terms that increase monotonically with the population level. This may not be realistic in all situations as one expects the noise to change as u approaches the carrying capacity. This is one motivation to study the SPDE

Hence propagation failure of waves can occur like in
the situation with noise term uẆ . Using the map√

arises as a limit of a contact process on a lattice
originally studied in [5] as a model for long-range
offspring displacement; traveling wave solutions to
(22) exist for suitable parameter values [80]. However, Müller and Tribe also studied the behavior of
√
(22) with a scaled noise term u Ẇ varying the parameter µ and proved [56, Thm 1] that there exists
a critical value µc , independent of u(x, 0), such that
P(u(x, t) survives) = 0 if µ < µc ,
P(u(x, t) survives) = 1 if µ > µc .

(25)

This model was studied by several groups. In [55]
it was proved for sufficiently small noise that compactly supported initial data remain within a timedependent interval and that a well-defined front as
well as an asymptotic wave speed exist; interestingly,
the shape and asymptotic form of waves has been

of interest by an independent group for a discrete
stochastic model [50].
Detailed numerical studies of the wave speed for
(25) have been carried out [62,8] focusing on the
small noise regime and the fluctuation properties of
the front. Due to the special structure of the FKPP
equation one may also exploit a duality argument
of (25) to a particle system [15,75]. Doering, Müller
and Smereka conjecture [15, eq (55)] from the duality relation that the asymptotic wave speed in the
strong noise regime is given by c ∼ 2/ǫ2 as ǫ → ∞.
Although it is unclear whether this conjecture is correct it is evident from numerical simulations [15, Fig
2] that the wave speed decreases upon increasing the
noise.
Figure 4 shows the mean, standard deviation and
wave speed calculated for (25). There are some minor differences between this case and g(u) = u and
√
g(u) = u shown in Figures 2 and 3. There is a
larger plateau for small noise and it takes larger
noise strengths to reach the vicinity of propagation
failure. However, the main warning-signs from local
data still remain as it is still possible to conclude
from large population levels and low fluctuations a

fast wave while increasing fluctuations lead to slower
speeds and low population levels with smaller fluctuations indicate closeness to propagation failure.
Another different form of the noise term given by
g(u) = u(1 − u) was considered in [68, eq (39)-(41)]
but we shall not consider it here as the results are
similar.
In summary, one should always measure the closeness to carrying capacity and the size of the fluctuations (standard deviation, variance). If system parameters change slowly one may determine from Figures 2-4 whether the distance to propagation failure
has increased or decreased.

8 Transitions for the Allee Effect
Although propagation failure is extremely interesting from the viewpoint of critical transitions, it is
certainly not the only invasion wave phenomenon
where local early-warning signs are desirable. As already discussed in Section 3 there can also be pushed
fronts if the nonlinearity f (u) is chosen differently.
A reasonable prototypical model to study is the fol-

There are three interesting special points. For µ =
1/2 the front speed vanishes and the front reverses
direction if µ > 1/2. The regime for µ ∈ (0, 1/2)
is called bistable and changes to a pushed front at
µ = 0; see [65, Sec 1] and references therein for
details. The pushed front regime applies for µ ∈
(−1/2, 0) and at µ = −1/2 there is a pushed-topulled front transition [68, Sec V]. The wave speed
√
for the pulled front is c∗ = 2 −µ [64, Sec 3.3][81,
p.38-42]. Therefore, it is interesting to try to find
early-warning signs for approaching the three special points µ = −1/2, 0, 1/2 cases. The front reversal case µ = 1/2 is clearly important as a direction
change for an invasion front could be regarded as a
critical transition but the other two cases could be
of interest as well.
For the SPDE (26) we shall choose the simple
multiplicative noise g(u) = u. We consider the pushedto-pulled transition first and try to apply our approach from Sections 6-7. Figure 5 shows the analog
of the top parts of Figures 2-4. We observe that it
is impossible to detect a trend or infer the speed of
the wave. Hence, for the pushed-to-pulled transition
with space-time white noise the classical variancebased early-warning signs cannot be applied for local
data perturbed by a fixed noise level and observed
at the center of the wave. Therefore, one should also
think of new early-warning sign techniques in the
context of wave propagation.

Fig. 5 Dependence of the time average Ū on the noise
strength ǫ averaged over 200 sample paths. The SPDE (26)
for g(u) = u has been numerically solved (using EulerMaruyama (15)) with K = 100, T = 15, N = 103 on the
interval [−50, 50] with Neumann boundary conditions and
initial condition u(x, 0) = 1 if x ∈ [−1, 1] and u(x, 0) = 0
otherwise. Ū (circles) has been calculated as the mean of
the time series u(0, t) recorded by an ecological observer at
the origin for t ∈ [7.5, 15]. The dots indicate ±1 standard
deviation Σ for the time series; the curves are associated
interpolations forming a confidence neighborhood.

Note carefully that we always used in our computations in Figures 2-5 the regime for u(0, t) when the
wave is already fully formed with t ∈ [T0 , T ] for some
T0 ≫ 1. However, the transient regime starting from
the localized initial condition may also contain important information. Figure 6 shows three numerical
simulations for µ = −0.3, 0.2, 0.4.
The computation suggests that the initial transient spreading of the wave u(0, t) for t ∈ [0, T0 ] is
interesting. A simple measure to consider is
um := min {u(0, t) : for a given u(x, 0)}.
t∈[0,T0 ]

(28)

Clearly, the result depends upon the choice of T0
and the initial condition u(x, 0). However, if both
are fixed then we may compare the results. Figure
7(a) shows the results for a parametric study of µ ∈
[−0.75, 0.5]. The insets (b)-(c) show a finer mesh
resolution near the pushed-to-pulled transition at
µ = −1/2 and near propagation failure which is
slightly shifted from the theoretical value at µ = 1/2
as the small finite-width initial condition and the
noise both seem to contribute to reach the absorbing state u ≡ 0 for parameter values µ smaller than
1/2. In fact, due to these effects, the transition is
more drastic than the formula (27) predicts.
From Figure 7(b) it is apparent that the pushedto-pulled transition is probably unpredictable from
local data collected at x = 0. Since the wave speed
transition is continuous one should probably not classify the pushed-to-pulled transition as a ’critical transition’. Therefore, it is not crucial to predict it but

the result shows the limitation of the ecological observer at x = 0. The same conclusion applies to the
change from the pushed to the bistable regime at
µ = 0. For the propagation failure scenario Figure
7(c) shows a scaling law for the decrease of um and a
slightly increasing variance may help us to anticipate
the upcoming critical transition. This should not be
surprising since we already considered similar propagation failure cases in Sections 6-7. The difference
is that we used a completely different indicator in
Figure 7(c).
As for the classical FKPP equation one should remark for the Allee effect situation that different noise
terms certainly do make sense, e.g. g(u) = u(1 − u)
considered in [2, eq.(2)]. Based on the observations
for varying the noise terms for the classical FKPP
equation, and obtaining similar results for several
choices, we shall not consider these generalizations
for (26).

9 Noncompact Initial Invasions
Based on the results in Section 8 we have observed
that the initial transient regime, starting from a localized invasion wave, can be useful. It remains to
consider the case when the initial condition is not
localized. In particular, we consider the FKPP equation

u(x, 0) = e−α|x| ,

for α > 0.

(30)

Recall from Section 3 that the wave speed scales as
c(α) = O(1/α) for α → 0.
Figure 8(a) shows the dependence of the initial
transient observed at x = 0 on the complete initial data. Therefore, small minimum values indicate
comparatively slower waves and no response to the
initial condition (um ≈ 1) signals a very fast wave.

Figure 8(b) shows an upper bound to the wave speed
and raises the interesting question whether we should,
or should not, view a blow-up point for the wave
speed as a critical transition.
There are two main conclusions from the results
for (29)-(30) and from Section 8. Firstly, one definitely should try to measure an invasion wave immediately once the first occurrence of a new population in a new environment has been observed. Secondly, knowing the basic structure of the initial condition can be crucial for prediction, e.g. in Figure 7
0 ≪ um < 1 still indicates a well-defined asymptotic
wave speed in the pushed regime while for Figure
8 the condition 0 ≪ um < 1 indicates closeness to
a wave speed blow-up point. Hence, it is crucial to
know, on a qualitative level, whether the initial invasion is really localized or whether it really consists
of a full front.

10 Outlook
Since early-warning signs and stochastic scaling laws
for noisy traveling waves are still a relatively new direction, we have only been able to cover a few aspects
here. Many open problems arose which we summarize here.
The restrictions to one spatial dimension x ∈ R
and one population component u have to removed in
the future. There are many interesting cases e.g. multicomponent systems such as reaction-diffusion models with predation [61], FKPP-type plankton dynamics [6] or Nagumo (Allee effect)-type equations [27].
Multiple spatial dimensions can lead to more complicated bifurcation structures [40]. One may also remove all restrictions which can generate interesting
life-death transitions for multi-component, 2D and

12

3D systems [58]. Another highly relevant generalization are heterogeneous [69] and random [85] environments. Furthermore, the structure of the FKPP
equation may be too restrictive which suggests to
add transport/advection terms and active boundaries in which case discontinuous wave speed transitions have been reported [11]. Also the assumption of
time-white or space-time-white noise is too restrictive and one should extend the view to spatiallycolored noise [25] and trace-class covariance operators. Another issue that looked interesting is the
relevance of fluctuations (’front diffusion’) [1,67] for
early-warning signs.
In all cases, our main driving question in this
paper seems to be open: How much information do
local statistics of an SPDE, collected at one (or multiple) locations, carry about the speed and bifurcations of traveling waves? It is seems plausible to obtain basic answers to these questions using numerical simulations. To develop a mathematical theory
for quantitative scaling laws of SPDEs and their application to critical transitions is expected to be a
challenging problem for a long time.
