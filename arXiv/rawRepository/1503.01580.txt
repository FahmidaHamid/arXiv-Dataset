Anaerobic digestion enables the water industry to treat wastewater as a resource for generating
energy and recovering valuable by-products. The complexity of the anaerobic digestion process
has motivated the development of complex models. However, this complexity makes it intractable
to pin-point stability and emergent behaviour. Here, the widely used Anaerobic Digestion Model
No. 1 (ADM1) has been reduced to its very backbone, a syntrophic two-tiered microbial ‘food
chain’ and a slightly more complex three-tiered microbial ‘food web’, with their stability analysed
as function of the inflowing substrate concentration and dilution rate. Parameterised for phenol and
chlorophenol degradation, steady-states were always stable and non-oscillatory. Low input concentrations of chlorophenol were sufficient to maintain chlorophenol- and phenol-degrading populations
but resulted in poor conversion and a hydrogen flux that was too low to sustain hydrogenotrophic
methanogens. The addition of hydrogen and phenol boosted the populations of all three organisms,
resulting in the counterintuitive phenomena that (i) the phenol degraders were stimulated by adding
hydrogen, even though hydrogen inhibits phenol degradation, and (ii) the dechlorinators indirectly
benefitted from measures that stimulated their hydrogenotrophic competitors; both phenomena hint
at emergent behaviour.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Microbial degradation of organic compounds in
methanogenic environments is a sequential process catalysed by a series of different micro-organisms. Syntrophy
plays a pivotal role in these feeding webs: degradation
of compounds like propionate and phenol is only sustainable if their degradation products, hydrogen and acetate,
are removed by methanogens. The thermodynamic rational behind syntrophy is well understood, but its kinetic framework is less established. This raises questions
about the stability of these feeding chains and the factors that govern them. As a first step towards answering
these questions a simple mathematical model was previously developed describing the interactions in a twotiered feeding chain, populated with a set of parameters
that apply to propionate degraders and hydrogenotrophic
methanogens [1]. Mathematical analysis of the model indicated that the system was always stable: there were no
conditions where the populations of the two organisms
oscillate or show other forms of emergent behaviour.
The objective of the present paper is to introduce an
additional organism into a similar feeding chain and evaluate its effect on stability and potential emergent be-

haviour of the resulting ‘food web’. The organism of
choice is a chlorophenol-dechlorinating bacterium. The
other two organisms are a phenol degrader and a hydrogenotrophic methanogen. The complete removal of
phenolic compounds from the system is hereby referred
to as chlorophenol mineralisation. The salient feature of
the chlorophenol degrader here is that production of phenol is coupled to consumption of hydrogen by hydrogen
cycling. Thus, as a hydrogen consumer, the dechlorinator competes with the methanogen for hydrogen [2, 3].
The working hypotheses are (i) that the dechlorinator
can (partially) replace the methanogen as the syntroph
in a phenol-degrading consortium, and (ii) that introduction of this organism can potentially lead to unexpected
emergent behaviour related to the intricacies of the multispecies relationships.
It has been shown that deterministic modelling of biological systems, typically through a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), provides important
understanding of these often complex processes, specifically in determining changes to the system behaviour
given perturbations in the inputs. For anaerobic digestion, higher dimensional models are useful for capturing
the phenomenological behaviour of the multi-step processes and are often the de-facto method for understanding plant operation [4]. On the other hand, simplified or
reduced models have received more attention in process

2
monitoring, control design [5, 6], and optimisation [7].
Simplified models have also been applied to determine
the global [8, 9] or local [10] stability of the system under investigation. Typically, these are two-species models, whereas here we present a case considering a threespecies food web.
Whilst a strictly analytical approach is not possible
given the dimensions of the ensuing model, the approach
taken here derives analytic expressions for all steadystates, supported by numerical simulations to determine
the regions of local stability within sensible operating
conditions. As such, it is possible to gain a formal understanding of the emergent properties of all states.

MODEL AND METHOD

Mechanistic model of a three-tiered food web

The model developed here is based on Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) [4]. The general model here
has six components, three substrate and three biomass
variables, from which a sub-model describing phenol
degradation and the extension of the full model to include addition of extraneous substrates, are formed and
described in the relevant sections. The chlorophenol
degrader utilises both chlorophenol and hydrogen for
growth, producing phenol as a product. Phenol is consumed by the phenol degrader forming hydrogen, which
also is inhibitory to its growth. The methanogen scavenges this hydrogen and acts as the primary syntroph.
The time-dependent substrate and biomass concentrations are denoted S(t) and X(t), respectively, with subscripts ch , ph and H2 referring to chlorophenol, phenol and
hydrogen components, respectively. The growth functions are of Monod form with the inclusion of a product
inhibition term, KI,H2 . Chlorophenol, phenol and hydrogen are introduced with an input concentration Sch,in ,
Sph,in , SH2 ,in , respectively, and a dilution rate D. The
inhibition of hydrogen on the phenol degrader is defined
as

where KS,H2 ,c and KS,H2 are the half-saturation constants for hydrogen in the chlorophenol degrader and
hydrogenotrophic methanogen, respectively. The values
used for the various parameters are listed in Table I, and
their derivation is presented A. The value 224/208 represents the fraction of chlorophenol chemical oxygen demand (COD) converted to phenol, 32/224 is the fraction
of phenol converted to hydrogen, and 16/208 is the fraction of hydrogen COD consumed by Xch .

Dimensionless form

It is beneficial to scale unit-dependent equations to a
dimensionless form; this significantly reduces the number
of parameters describing the dynamics, thereby simplifying the subsequent analyses. Using the notation of Xu
et al. [1], after Baltzis and Fredrickson [11], the following
dimensionless terms are defined

Steady-states

The steady-states of this system of ODEs are obtained
by setting gi = 0 (for i = 1, . . . , 6) and solving simultaneously. This predicts eight possible steady-states:
SS1:: The trivial steady-state where all three populations are washed out (x0 = x1 = x2 = 0).
SS2:: Only the methanogen population is maintained
(x0 = x1 = 0, x2 6= 0).

are maintained (x0 6= 0, x1 6= 0, x2 = 0).
SS5:: Only the phenol degraders are washed out (x0 6=
0, x1 = 0, x2 6= 0).
SS6:: All three populations are present (x0 6= 0, x1 6=
0, x2 6= 0).
SS7:: Only the phenol degraders are present (x0 =
0, x1 6= 0, x2 = 0).
SS8:: The phenol degraders and methanogens are maintained in the system (x0 = 0, x1 6= 0, x2 6= 0).
For full chlorophenol mineralisation and, as such, the
only desired operating condition, SS6 must be stable.

Stability analysis

The challenge of analytically characterising dynamical systems of ODEs is well understood. Typically, for

4
systems of high dimensions, it is intractable to finding
explicit solutions and one must resort to obtaining solutions numerically. For example, the Routh-Hurwitz
theorem allows for an explicit analysis of the stability
of steady-states, but is intractable beyond five dimensions [12] and is excluded here. Relying on numerical
solutions, however, is problematic as the extent and resolution of the results are limited by the choice of model
parameters and the computational resources. Nevertheless, here analytical expressions may be found for some
of the steady-states that can inform general rules about
their viability. To present the results of the stability analysis coherently, all steady-states are solved numerically
for a realistic range of operational and kinetic parameters
with a suitable resolution of 5000×5000 solution points.
A brief discussion of the numerical methods used in this
analysis is provided in B.
In order that a steady-state be meaningful, all variable concentrations must be non-negative, while Eq. (5)
also gives the condition that Sch < Sch,in , (or s0 < uf in
dimensionless form). For model extensions with phenol
and hydrogen addition, the conditions that Sph < Sph,in
(s1 < ug ) and SH2 < SH2 ,in (s2 < uh ) are also necessary.
It is well established that the stability of a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be
determined by investigating the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrix [13]. The Jacobian for the
system of Equations (11-16) corresponds to the 6×6 matrix

Note that for the two-tier model, for which Xch =
Sch = 0, the Jacobian reduces to a 4×4 matrix. The
Jacobian is then evaluated at a given steady-state, denoted JSSi (i=1,...,8), and its eigenvalues calculated. If
the real parts of all the eigenvalues obtained from the
Jacobian are negative, then the state is stable. If one or
more of the eigenvalues have a positive real part then the
steady-state is unstable.
In Section III, a thorough investigation is carried out
in order to determine when each steady-state is viable.
Firstly, a two-tier model describing only phenol degradation is considered, where x0 = s0 = 0, reducing the
system of ODEs to four equations. Subsequently, the
full model for chlorophenol mineralisation is studied.

RESULTS

Two-tier phenol model

An initial analysis was performed on the two-species
model feeding on phenol. As expected from the model
structure, the results are similar to those shown for a
propionate-degrading bi-culture with a maintenance term
(kdec ) [1], where three stable steady-states emerge: SS1,
SS7 and SS8. Figure 1 shows the steady-state diagram
for the phenol model, demonstrating that the system has
three mutually exclusive stable steady-states under the
range of parameters and operating conditions chosen.
Numerical simulations under conditions producing SS7
(not shown) indicated that the concentration of phenol
degraders are comparatively low (compared to SS8 populations), resulting in low hydrogen production. This
in turn results in the washout of the methanogen, whilst
the phenol degraders, under significant phenol concentrations, can be maintained up to dilution rates equivalent
to their theoretical maximum growth rate minus the decay constant, µmax,ph −kdec,ph = 1.02d−1 . Although numerical analysis of the steady-states was performed here,
it is possible to get explicit quadratic functions of the parameter pair (Sph,in , D) for the steady-state partitions.
Using the method described in Xu et al. [1], the functions
for the partitions are (in non-dimensionless form)

A full analysis of the stability for each steady-state

Numerical simulation of the model was performed using the parameters listed in Table I, over a range of operating conditions (α,uf ). The stable steady-state regions
are shown in Fig. 2. As determined from the stability
analysis, SS1 is meaningful under all operating conditions
and bistable steady-states with SS4 and SS6 are found in
specific regions within the numerical limits of the simulation, depending on the initial conditions. An interesting
phenomenon not observed in previous two-tiered models
is the existence of SS1 at low dilution rates but increasing
chlorophenol input. It is likely that the condition uf > s0
is not satisfied in this region and suggests that the system
does not produce enough metabolites to sustain the syntrophic populations at such low substrate concentrations
and flow rates.

is dependent on both uf and uh . The first condition dictates that at higher uf , a greater amount
of uh is also required to maintain stability, whereas
the second condition indicates that at a fixed uf ,
increasing uh will increase the dilution rate under
which SS3 is stable up to a boundary described by
a function f (uf , µmax,H2 −kC ).
SS4:: Meaningful given the roots of the cubic function
(Eq. (C11)) for s0 are positive and the conditions
α < (s0 /(1+s0 ))−kA , α < (φ1 /(1+KI s2 ))−kB ,
uh > ω1 s1 +s2 and x1 > 0 are met. Stability
is assured when α > µ2 −kC and for R(λi ) < 0
(i = 2, . . . , 6). As uh affects s0 through the highly
non-linear cubic expression, it is difficult to draw
any conclusion about its effect on stability by analytical means.

chlorophenol mineralisation by allowing the establishment of a methanogenic population that can be maintained given the availability of hydrogen in high enough
concentrations.
When hydrogen addition is included, the hydrogen input term, SH2 ,in > 0 in Eq. (7), and the dimensionless
form, uh > 0 in Eq. (16). A further three steady-states
are defined with this model; SS2, SS3 and SS5.
Following the same approach as for the three-tier
chlorophenol model, six Jacobian matrices were derived
for each steady-state, and their eigenvalues λi (where
i = 1, . . . , 6) found. In this case, the conditions for stability for each steady-state are as follows
SS1:: Meaningful and stable providing
uf

φ2 uh
−kA < α;
−kC < α.

Given that, in this model, kA = kC , then for
φ2 > 1, the second condition becomes the prevailing factor in determining stability, and can be
reduced to µmax,H2 −kC < α, where µmax,H2 =
km,H2 YH2 /km,ch Ych .

SS5:: Meaningful when the conditions φ2 > α+kC ,
s2 > (KP +s2 )(α+kA ), uf > s0 and uh > s2 +
ω2 +(ω2 kA x0 /α) are met. Stability of this steadystate is assured when α > µ1 −kB and R(λi ) < 0
(i = 3, . . . , 6).
SS6:: Meaningful when α

φ2 −kC , α
<
(φ1 /(1+KI s2 ))−kB , α < (φ1 /(KP +s2 ))−kA ,
uf > s0 , α < ω0 kA x0 /(s1 −ω0 x0 ) and x2 > 0.
SS6 is stable when R(λi ) < 0 (i = 1, . . . , 6). The
analysis shows that SS6 stability is affected by
hydrogen addition.
The results from the stability analysis are visualised in
Fig. 3 for different concentrations of hydrogen addition.
As can be seen, four steady-states (SS3-6) are affected by
increasing concentrations of hydrogen. At very low hydrogen concentration addition (Fig. 3 (a)), SS3 is stable
in the region between (0,0) and SS2 (SS1 is not shown as
it remains fixed at D = Mmax,H2 −kdec = 2.08d−1 , where
Mmax is the non-dimensionless form of µmax ). Moreover,
at lower dilution rates, the system has two observable
bistable conditions: 1) between SS3 and SS6 at the lowest dilution rates; and 2) between SS3 and SS4, before
SS3 becomes the single stable steady-state at higher dilution rates. This can be rationalised as follows:

SS2:: Meaningful when α < φ2 −kC and uh >
s2 and stable when KP (uf +1)(φ2 −kC )+kC −uf +
kC uf /(KP −1)(uf +1) < α. Here it can be noted
that the stability of SS2 does not depend on uh ,
and as such will remain fixed for any hydrogen input concentration.

• The chlorophenol degrader can outcompete the
methanogen for the additional hydrogen in the system. Depending on the initial biomass concentrations, this can result in complete washout of the
phenol degrader and methanogen at low dilution
rates. However, at higher chlorophenol concentrations, the system can be in stable equilibrium with
all organisms present;

SS3:: Meaningful given the roots of the quadratic function (Eq. (C3)) for s0 are positive, uf > s0 and
uh > ω2 (uf −s0 ). For steady-state stability, it is
necessary that α > µ1 −kB , α > µ2 −kC and for
R(λi ) < 0 (i = 4, 5, 6). Here, the stability of SS3

• As the dilution rate increases, the methanogen is
washed from the system as the chlorophenol degrader outcompetes it to become the sole hydrogen
scavenger, as seen in Fig. 2;

• Eventually at higher dilution rates, the phenol degrader is washed out and full chlorophenol mineralisation is no longer possible. Nevertheless, beyond
the theoretical Mmax,ch , the methanogen is able to
grow again (SS2), as there is a constant supply of
substrate without an active competitor.
With increasing hydrogen addition interesting phenomena are observed (Fig. 3 (b)-(d)). Firstly, the bistability between SS3 and SS6 is replaced by a single steadystate, in which all organisms are present. Similarly, the
SS3-SS4 bistability is replaced by only SS4, although
this requires greater hydrogen concentrations at higher
chlorophenol input. A new steady-state also begins to
emerge (SS5), starting at low chlorophenol input, which
eventually subsumes the other two varying steady-states
(SS3 and SS4) at high hydrogen concentrations. The understanding from this is that at dilution rates higher than
the upper boundary of SS6 and below the lower bound-

ary of SS2, the phenol degrader is naturally washed out,
but the presence of increasing amounts of hydrogen allows the methanogen to exist whilst in competition with
the chlorophenol degrader.
Most importantly, the extent of SS6 is also observed to
increase below a specific Sch,in , with the additional hydrogen resource stabilising the methanogen population
at higher dilution rates, limited now only by its maximum growth rate (Mmax,H2 ). Above this dilution rate,
as with the three-tiered model, the production of phenol
is limited by the stoichiometry of chlorophenol degradation. This restriction results in a limited supply of
phenol under these operating conditions, which cannot
produce enough growth in the phenol degrader to sustain its population. However, the increasing abundance
of additional hydrogen leads to the establishment of a
two-species trophic level with no intermediary organism
(SS5). Nevertheless, the ability to extend the stable re-

8
gion of SS6 with addition of hydrogen is of note, particularly for practitioners.

It has been shown that the inclusion of hydrogen addition in the three-tiered system can lead to an increase in
the stable region for full chlorophenol mineralisation with
regard to standard operating parameters. However, this
is limited to a defined operating range. At lower Sch,in
there is washout of phenol degraders and establishment
of methanogens at increasing hydrogen concentrations.
It appears that a form of competitive exclusion occurs at
certain (D, Sch,in ). However, unlike the classical case,
here the exclusion principle dictates that consumer A
(Xch ) is never excluded and either consumer B (XH2 )
or producer A (Xph ) are washed from the system. This
can be seen in the system simulation shown in Fig. 4,
which considers a single operational point (D = 0.36d−1 ,
Sch,in = 0.30kgCOD/m3 ), with increasing SH2 ,in .

At low hydrogen addition, the concentration is
not enough to sustain the methanogen population
whilst a small population of dechlorinators are present
(6×10−5 kgCOD/m3 ). The hydrogen not utilised by the
chlorophenol degrader reaches an equilibrium that inhibits the phenol degraders and they are washed out of
the system and, thus, SS3 is the dominant steady-state
under these conditions for the initial conditions tested.
As hydrogen addition is increased, an interesting property of the system emerges. Again, the chlorophenol degrader is able to utilise the extra hydrogen to produce
more biomass and more phenol. However, the concentrations of additional hydrogen are not enough to sustain
the methanogen population and the equilibrium concentration returns to a value approximate to the previous
case. Whilst this exerts an inhibitory effect on the phenol
degraders, the additional phenol substrate availability is
enough to maintain a population in the system (steadystate not shown in Fig. 4), which switches the system to
SS4. In the final case, hydrogen addition is further increased, allowing chlorophenol degraders to utilise most
of the available chlorophenol and reach close to its maximum growth. As this growth is asymptotic, and because
of the surplus hydrogen available, the methanogens are
now able to utilise the remaining concentrations to maintain their population in the system. This results in an
increased hydrogen equilibrium that exerts a greater inhibition on the phenol degraders, to such an extent that
the additional phenol availability is not enough to avoid
washout and the system moves to SS5.

It can be seen that this situation is fairly complex and
is dependent on a number of factors. Principally, the
equilibrium concentration of hydrogen is determined by
the dilution rate, which in turn limits the growth of either
producer A or consumer B.

D.

Three-tier chlorophenol model with phenol
addition

For such a non-linear system the addition of hydrogen
could lead to deleterious and potentially unexpected behaviour, especially given its inhibitory effect on the phenol degraders. It is therefore useful to examine the effect
of adding phenol to the system, both as a sole exogenous substrate, but also in combination with hydrogen
addition. In this way, it may be determined under what
conditions, if any, full chlorophenol mineralisation can be
extended in relation to the two operational parameters
(D and Sch,in ).
When phenol is added to the system the phenol inflow
term, Sph,in from Eq. (6) and ug from the dimensionless
Eq. (15), become positive. An additional two steadystates are defined with this model, SS7 and SS8.
The conditions for stability in each steady-state, determined in the same manner as previously described, are
as follows:
SS1:: Stable for φ1 ug /(1+ug )−kB < α. For high concentrations of phenol, this is equivalent to µmax,ph −
kB < α, where µmax,ph = km,ph Yph /km,ch Ych .
However, at lower phenol concentrations, the effect
of phenol lowers the minimum dilution rate under
which SS1 is stable.
SS2:: Never stable as a contradiction occurs in the
terms describing s2 and x2 . For these variables
to be meaningful, the conditions α−kC < φ2 and
α−kC > φ2 must be satisfied, which is invalid (see
Eqs. (C1) and (C2)).
SS3:: Never stable as a contradiction occurs in the terms
describing s2 and x0 . With uh = 0, s0 > uf for
s2 to be positive. This condition, however, results
in x0 always being negative and meaningless (see
Eqs. (C4) and (C5)).
SS4:: Meaningful given the roots of the cubic function
(Eq. (C11)) for s0 are positive and the conditions
α < (s0 /(1+s0 ))−kA , α < (φ1 /(1+KI s2 ))−kB ,
x0 > 0 and x1 > 0 are met. Stability is assured
when α > µ2 −kC and the roots of the characteristic polynomial (Eq. (C31)) have negative real parts.
In the special case that hydrogen is also added to
the system, it should be noted that if ug < s1 , then
the condition uh > s2 must be strictly observed.
Similarly, if uh < s2 , then ug must be greater than
s1 .
SS5:: Never stable as without uh then x2 can never be
positive (see Eq. (C29)).
SS6:: Meaningful when α
<
φ2 −kC , α
<
(φ1 /(1+KI s2 ))−kB , α < (φ1 /(KP +s2 ))−kA ,
uf > s0 , x0 > 0 and α < (ω1 x1 −ω2 x0 )/s2 . With
these conditions met, stability of SS6 is guaranteed
when the roots of the characteristic polynomial

SH2 ,in = 1×10−1 (red), SH2 ,in = 2.67 (blue). Initial conditions: Xch = 10−3 , Xph = 6.5×10−5 , XH2 = 10−3 , Sch = 10−2 ,
Sph = 5×10−2 , SH2 = 10−3 (all kgCOD/m3 ).

(Eq. (C42)) have negative real parts. In this case,
it can be shown that SS6 is influenced by ug .
SS7:: Meaningful given the roots of the quadratic function for s1 (Eq. (C50)) are positive and, subsequently, φ1 s1 /(1+s1 )KI (α+kB ) > 1/KI , and
ug > s1 . Therefore, stability is assured when
α > µ0 −kA , α > µ2 −kC and the roots of the characteristic polynomial (Eq. (C53)) have negative real
parts. It can be seen that the stability of SS7 relies
on ug , but is also influenced by hydrogen if added
to the system.
SS8:: Stable when the following conditions are satisfied. Firstly, s2 is meaningful given φ2 > α−kc .
Stability is assured when s2 is meaningful, α >
µ0 −kA , and the roots of the characteristic polynomial (Eq. (C62)) have negative real parts. In
general, for SS8 to be stable, α must be smaller
than µmax,H2 and, therefore, uf should be small.
Again, the operational parameter plots are used to visualise the outputs from the stability analysis, as shown
in Figs 5 (a)-(c). At low phenol addition, emergent
steady-states (SS6-SS8) are observed at low dilution
rates, with the bistability present in the standard threetiered model comprising the rest of the system below

the boundary for SS1. As phenol is increased, the two
bistable regions disappear to be replaced by a single stable steady-state (SS4 and SS6). Both SS7 and SS8 also
appear across a greater range of dilutions, although SS8
is confined to low chlorophenol addition, whilst SS8 eventually covers a region contained by the upper bounds of
SS7 (low Sch,in ) and SS4 (high Sch,in ), and the boundary
of SS1. Of greater interest is the observation that the extent of the desired condition, SS6, is greater for Sch,in between approximately 0 and 1kgCOD/m3 , replacing both
SS4 and part of SS7.

E.

Three-tier chlorophenol model with bi-substrate
addition

Figure 5 (d) shows an example when both hydrogen
and phenol are added to the system. Here it can be
seen that the two additional substrates each contribute
to distinct emergent properties. The hydrogen addition allows for the maintenance of a methanogen population at higher dilution rates, whilst the phenol addition
maintains the phenol degraders at lower dilution rates.
Both additional substrates provide the conditions necessary for full chlorophenol mineralisation within a specific
operational parameter space previously associated with

methanogen washout.
An extension of this analysis was undertaken by examining the effect of the two supplementary substrate
additions on the maintenance of SS6 at higher dilution
rates than observed in the standard three-tiered model.
Figure 6 shows the steady-state plot for varying concentrations of hydrogen and phenol addition for two distinct
operating conditions observed previously to give rise to
SS6 with addition of an extraneous substrate. Figure 6
(a) demonstrates that both hydrogen and phenol addition can transform the system from undesirable bistability to a stable process with all three organisms present.
Indeed, it is shown here that addition of either substrate
can lead to SS6 under relatively high chlorophenol input
conditions.
An alternative situation under low chlorophenol addition is shown in Figure 6 (b). Here, it is clear that
phenol addition at concentrations above 0.65kgCOD/m3

provides the necessary conditions for full chlorophenol
mineralisation, irregardless of hydrogen addition. Although it can also be seen that hydrogen addition does
have some effect within a very small range of phenol concentration between about 0.63 and 0.65kgCOD/m3 , allowing for stability of the methanogenic population and
moving the steady-state from SS4 to SS6, it is relatively
negligible given the influence of phenol with these operating parameters.

IV.

BISTABILITY ANALYSIS

Throughout Section III, numerous regions of bistability were observed between SS3-SS4 (Fig. 3 (a), (b) and
(c)), SS3-SS6 (Fig. 3 (a) and (b)) and SS1-SS6 (Fig. 1).
In this Section, these bistable regions are investigated in
order to provide a more in-depth description and under-

conditions XH2 = 0, Sch = 0.14, Sph = 0.11 and SH2 = 5.5×

standing. Through analysis of these results, the steadystate having the larger basin of attraction is determined,
i.e. the most likely outcome for a range of initial conditions. Note that the other four steady-states, even when
meaningless or unstable, are still present mathematically
and can impact on the overall dynamics of the system.
Firstly, the region of bistability between SS3 and SS4
was considered. Figure 7 shows the final stable steadystates (SS3 or SS4) achieved for a range of initial conditions. Note that for SS3 or SS4, XH2 = 0 and does
not deviate from this value throughout, which simplifies
the analysis required here. When Xch is small, the system is likely to head towards SS3 where washout of Xph
occurs. Otherwise, the system achieves SS4. Very similar results were obtained for biologically meaningful substrate initial conditions between 1.3×10−2 and 1.5×10−1
for Sch , 9.0×10−2 and 4.9×10−1 for Sph and 2.2×10−12
and 4.7×10−12 for SH2 (kgCOD/m3 ). These results suggest that as long as sufficient dechlorinating biomass is

present in the system, the most likely outcome is for both
Xch and Xph to be present over time. Thus, the basin of
attraction for SS4 is larger than that for SS3. In addition,
changing the dilution rate D, Sch,in , or SH2 ,in within the
bistable region once again leads to similar results.
A similar analysis of the bistable regions for SS3-SS6
and SS1-SS6 give a more dramatic outcome. If any of the
three organisms, Xph , Xch or XH2 , are initially zero, SS6
is not obtained. If all of these are present, even in tiny
quantities, SS6 will be reached. It is known that SS1 is
always meaningful, thus a steady-state always occurs at
the origin, be it stable or unstable. In the case of bistability, SS3-SS4 or SS3-SS6, the unstable steady-state is
closer to SS3 rather than SS4 or SS6, respectively. This
instability thus forces the dynamics away from the total
washout and towards the state with the least washout.
This analysis highlights how not only the main parameters of the system can impact the final stable state, but
also the importance of initial conditions.

V.

DISCUSSION

In this work, a mathematical analysis of a three-tiered
‘food web’ comprising three organisms with hydrogen
addition and inhibition has been presented. Although
mechanistic models of microbial interactions are somewhat ubiquitous, analytical approaches have been limited
to simple two-species systems [1, 14, 15]. More recently,
attempts at analysing more complete systems, such as the
anaerobic digestion process, have been performed with
some degree of rigour [16, 17], however the practicality
of these approaches is limited by the need for generalisation and increasing numbers of assumptions to allow for

12
mathematical tractability.
Although the three-tiered system is considered only
a sub-process of anaerobic digestion and the analysis
limited to a specific compound, the approach is general
enough to provide information about the characteristics
of such a process and allows for the possibility of extending the work to other systems and other compounds.
Indeed the results shown here point to the fact that biological knowledge can inform mathematical approaches,
whilst mathematical models can indicate or confirm biological properties of a system, succinctly and rationally.
Here, four models were analysed by a combination of
analytical and numerical techniques to obtain information regarding the extent and characteristics of system
stability in a three-organism process anaerobically degrading chlorophenol. In this case, only the hydrogen
part of the pathway was considered, with acetate being excluded from the analysis. The simple two-tiered
food chain considering only phenol degradation with two
species was shown to have the same characteristics observed as a previously studied system investigating propionate [1]; three steady-states and always stable. A second
model introduced chlorophenol as the primary substrate
and a dechlorinating organism forming a tri-culture that
resulted in the emergence of bistable conditions between
the complete washout steady-state and the two other viable states. Analysis of these bistabilities has shown that
the desired operating condition (SS6) has the strongest
basin of attraction such that complete washout can only
occur when the initial condition for one of the biomass
concentrations is zero.
Although it is interesting to see the extent under
which full chlorophenol mineralisation can occur using
this standard model, of greater interest from an engineering perspective is the possibility of driving the system towards its limits of operational viability without
compromising its function. With this in mind, the inclusion of additional input terms for hydrogen and phenol was undertaken, and corresponding stability analysis performed. In the case of hydrogen addition, it
was expected that this would lead to a wider region
of stability for the methanogen and, thus, extend the
operational domain for SS6. Indeed, this was the case
under relatively high concentrations of chlorophenol input, under which the methanogen population was maintained up to a theoretical maximum, dictated by its maximum growth rate. However at low chlorophenol input
(< 0.5kgCOD/m3 ), the nature of the resource competition between the dechlorinator and methanogen is such
that a switching of behaviour occurs in localities not conducive to stability of all three organisms.
Under the standard three-tiered chlorophenol model,
resource competition dictates that the dechlorinator is
able to utilise the available hydrogen for growth more
readily than the methanogen and under SS4 a competitive exclusion principle occurs and the latter is washed
out. With hydrogen addition, however, an abundance
of this resource allows the methanogen to access enough

hydrogen to maintain a population at steady-state. However, below a threshold concentration and under specific
dilution rates, an excess of hydrogen leads to inhibition
of the phenol degrader and washout. In effect, the addition of hydrogen at this threshold results in a switching between SS4 and SS5, rather than a stabilisation at
SS6. The addition of phenol, however, under specific operational conditions can result in the emergence of SS6
under low chlorophenol input conditions. Here, a specific form of competition between the dechlorinator and
methanogen occurs (as with SS6 in the standard model),
by which both organisms benefit from the production
of hydrogen by the intermediate phenol degrader, whilst
the phenol degrader is stabilised by the syntrophic hydrogen removal. In other words, the presence of the
chlorophenol degrader allows for the production of phenol, which benefits both the phenol degrader and, indirectly, the methanogen. The presence of the methanogen
reduces the inhibition on the phenol degrader, thus allowing the hydrogen resource to be maintained for both
hydrogenotrophic populations. This can be seen as a
form of mutualism rather than competition. The phenol
addition plays a significant role under conditions where
the chlorophenol degrader cannot produce enough phenol
to maintain the phenol degraders, and under such conditions it is possible to achieve full chlorophenol mineralisation beyond the standard model system. A schematic of
these models and their interactions for the low chlorophenol input condition is shown in Fig. 8.
Although higher dimensional systems are analytically
restricted and lack generality, the work reported here for
a three-tiered ’food web’ underlines the potential for applying localised stability analysis within meaningful operating and parameter ranges, to identify properties of
the system that both increase fundamental understanding of the behaviour of such microbial systems, but also
guide thought on ways to manipulate or control them
for potential process improvement. Further work will include a thermodynamic rather than a kinetic inhibition
term for the effect of hydrogen on the syntroph, and the
extension of the model to polychlorinated phenols.

Appendix A: Parameter estimation

The parameters of the model are based on the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to be in consensus with
the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 [4]. However, only those related to hydrogen can be found in

13
using a conversion factor of 1.2×10−14 g/cell [19], or 1.2×
10−4 g/L.
Therefore, the particulate CODX can be calculated by
CODX = 2 gCOD/(g biomass)×1.2×10−4 (g biomass)/L
= 2.4×10−4 gCOD/L.
The COD of the substrate per COD of biomass (km,ch )
was then calculated using released chlor ions up to
35µM/Ld, which corresponds to COD consumed by
biomass of
µmol[Cl− ]/Ld
35
= 0.14mol[Cl− ]/gCODX d.

the ADM1 (for high-rate mesophilic processes). Subsequently, the parameters for chlorophenol and phenol were
chosen based on a combination of literature data and deduction based on their chemical oxidation reaction.
a. Parameters for chlorophenol Adrian et al. used
the Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain CBDB1 to completely convert 2,3-dichlorophenol, all six trichlorophenols, all three tetrachlorophenols, and pentachlorophenol
to lower chlorinated phenols [18], and their results are
used partially here, with some deductive reasoning. The
observed dechlorination rates in batch cultures with cell
numbers of 107 mL−1 was found to be 35 µMd−1 . The
COD of the CBDB1 strain was first estimated using the
empirical formula for bacterial cell C5 H7 O2 N, with cell
numbers of 107 mL−1 .
The oxidation reaction for C5 H7 O2 N is
C5 H7 O2 N+5O2 → 5CO2 +NH3 +2H2 O.

(A1)

From this equation, it is easy to show that 1 mole
of C5 H7 O2 N requires 5 mole of O2 , or 160gCOD. The
molar mass of C5 H7 O2 N is 113g/mol. Therefore, the
proportion of C5 H7 O2 N is 160/113 = 1.42g. By applying
this to general organic matter, a factor of 2 is used. This
means that each gram of biomass (e.g. strain CBDB1
here) requires 2g of oxygen for growth. Subsequently, the
cell number should be converted to grams (dry weight)

It should be noted that this result does not include
monochlorophenol, which have to be deduced. For
monochlorophenol, the COD must be converted from the
COD of Cl− . By considering the stoichiometry of its oxygenation,
C6 H5 OCl+6.5O2 → 6CO2 +2H2 O+2H+ +2Cl− , (A2)
the COD of monochlorophenol can be calculated as 6.5×
32 = 208gCOD/mol. From this, the maximum specific
uptake rate for monochlorophenol degraders can be estimated as km,ch = 0.14×208 = 29.12gCODS /gCODX d,
where CODS is the substrate COD.
For the half-saturation constant, KS,ch , no data was
found detailing empirical studies for monochlorophenol
degradation. However, from a recent study on the anaerobic microbial dechlorination of pentachlorophenol, some
values were cited for dechlorinating bacteria using cosubstrates of the 5-CP with other carbon sources [20]. A
KS value of 0.25µM, which converts to 0.053kgCOD/m3
following the oxidation of monochlorophenol, was selected as a rough estimate for the chlorophenol degrader
in this model.
The yield constant, Ych was calculated using information about the growth yield of the Dehalococcoides
mccartyi strain CBDB1 on 2,3-dichlorophenol (DCP), in
which 7.6×1013 cells per mole of Cl− were produced [18].
Since yield is the ratio of CODX to CODS , it can be
calculated by determining these components from their
stoichiometry;
: For 7.6×1013 cells, the dry weight is calculated
as 7.6×1013 ×1.2×10−14 g/cell = 0.912g.
Knowing that 2gCOD/gbiomass, stated earlier, then the
CODX = 1.824g.
CODS : One mole of Cl− released should be converted
to COD that DCP consumed. It is known that: DCP→
2Cl− . That means one mole of Cl− comes from 0.5 mole
of DCP. The oxidation equation of DCP is given by

14

C6 H4 OCl2 +6O2 → 6CO2 +H2 O+2H+ +2Cl− .

(A3)

Therefore, 1 mole of DCP consumes 6 mole of oxygen,
giving 6×32 = 192gCOD, which corresponds to 0.5 mole
of DCP using 96gCOD.
Subsequently, the yield of the chlorophenol degrader
can now be calculated as
Ych = 1.824gCOD/96gCOD = 0.019gCODX /gCODS .
The assumed half-saturation constant describing the
affinity of the dechlorinator for hydrogen, KS,H2 ,c was
arbitrarily set to 1×10−6 in the absence of supportable
empirical data. The value was based on the known constant for the methanogen, and chosen to be an order of
magnitude lower, accordingly.
b. Parameters for phenol There is very limited data
available on the kinetics of phenol degradation in anaerobic environments. The parameters selected for the phenol
degrader here are approximate values based on available
literature and deduction from analogous substrate reactions.
For example, the reaction of phenol is similar to that
for propionate, but consumes twice as much oxygen. The
oxidation equations for the two chemicals are written as
Propionate : C3 H6 O2 +3.5O2 → 3CO2 +3H2 O
Phenol : C6 H5 OH+7O2 → 6CO2 +3H2 O.
Hence, the activity of phenol is assumed to be double the activity of propionate. From the ADM1 [4],
the maximum specific activity for propionate (km,pro )
is 13gCODS /gCODX , so km,ph is assumed to be
26gCODS /gCODX .
The half-saturation constant for phenol was taken from
a study by Eismann et al. [21] using a modified Haldane kinetic model from Edwards [22], which considers the inhibitory effect of high substrate loading, for
data fitting. At 35◦ C, the KS,ph determined by the authors was 127mgPhenol/l, which converts to a value of
0.302kgCOD/m3 used in this model.
In the absence of compelling literature data, the yield
parameter for the phenol degraders, Yph , was taken to be
equivalent to that for another acetogenic bacteria, the
propionate degrader described in previous work [1] and
having a value of 0.04gCODS /gCODX .
Appendix B: Numerical Methods

Although it is possible to simplify the system and obtain analytical expressions for characteristic polynomials
for all of the steady-states solved in C, it is impossible to
gather the necessary information from these to determine
the regions where each steady-state is meaningful and/or

stable. Therefore, by considering sets of parameters (D,
Sch,in , Sph,in and SH2 ,in ) in turn on each steady-state,
and through the use of Matlab, the complex polynomials
for each steady-state in turn can be solved to determine
which are meaningful and stable. Repeating this method
with numerous sets of parameters leads to results showing where each steady-state is stable.
In addition, some cases (SS3 or SS4) do not allow straightforward expressions for the steady-state
(quadratic and cubic equations for s0 are obtained, respectively). In these situations, the above procedure
is followed for all possible values of s0 at these steadystates.
Appendix C: Stability analysis for the three-tier
chlorophenol model with substrate addition

Here, the expressions used for each steady-states in
turn when hydrogen and phenol addition are included in
the model are given. To obtain similar expressions when
hydrogen and/or phenol addition is not present in the
model, simply set uh = 0 and/or up = 0, respectively.
For the two-tier phenol model, consider s0 = x0 = 0 and
solve accordingly.
SS1 (x0 = x1 = x2 = 0)

Equations (14), (15) and (16) result in s0 = uf , s1 =
ug and s2 = uh , such that the steady-state is always
meaningful.

For stability it is required that λ1,2 < 0 and all three
roots from Eq. (C7) have negative real parts. These are
checked following the procedure described in B.

SS4 (x0 > 0, x1 > 0, x2 = 0)

By solving Eqs. (11) to (16) for x0 , x1 , s1 and s2 , and
substituting these into equation (14), the following cubic
expression for s0 is obtained
p3 s30 +p2 s20 +p1 s0 +p0 = 0
