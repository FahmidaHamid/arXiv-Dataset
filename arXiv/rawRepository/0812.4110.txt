Abstract
This paper considers a stochastic SIR (susceptible→infective→removed)
epidemic model in which individuals may make infectious contacts in
two ways, both within ‘households’ (which for ease of exposition are
assumed to have equal size) and along the edges of a random graph
describing additional social contacts. Heuristically-motivated branching process approximations are described, which lead to a threshold
parameter for the model and methods for calculating the probability of a major outbreak, given few initial infectives, and the expected
proportion of the population who are ultimately infected by such a
major outbreak. These approximate results are shown to be exact as
the number of households tends to infinity by proving associated limit
theorems. Moreover, simulation studies indicate that these asymptotic
results provide good approximations for modestly-sized finite populations. The extension to unequal sized households is discussed briefly.

Introduction

Epidemic models which include some element of realistic population structure
have been the subject of a considerable amount of recent study in recognition of the fact that the classical homogeneously-mixing models are quite
unrealistic for all but the smallest of populations.
One approach to this has been to allow local contacts of some kind, modelling contacts which occur on a regular basis in addition to maintaining
the ‘well-mixed’ global contacts to model chance interactions with random
members of the population. A common form for these local contacts to
take arises by partitioning the population into households, where these local
contacts can occur only between individuals who are in the same household
(see, for example, Becker and Dietz (1995) and Ball et al. (1997)). This can
be extended to the overlapping groups model where the population may be
partitioned in more than one way (for example, by household and by workplace), with local interactions taking place at (possibly) different rates within
groups of the different partitions, see Ball and Neal (2002). Another mode of
local interactions is described by the so-called great circle model (Ball et al.,
1997; Ball and Neal, 2002, 2003), where the population is spread around a
circle and individuals have local contact with only their nearest neighbours.
This model is closely related to ‘small-world’ models (Watts and Strogatz,
1998), which have received considerable attention, particularly in the physics
literature.
Another way of accounting for the inhomogeneous nature of interactions
is by using random graphs to model social networks (see, for example, Andersson (1997, 1998, 1999), Newman (2002), Durrett (2006), Kenah and Robins
(2007) and Britton et al. (2008)). Perhaps the most important aspect of
these random graph models is that they incorporate a specified degree distribution, the degree of a node in the graph corresponding to the number of
other members in the population an individual can possibly make infectious
contact with. These models have been extended to also incorporate ‘casual
contacts’ by way of the classical homogeneous mixing effects, see Kiss et al.
(2006) and Ball and Neal (2008).

In this paper we investigate a model for an SIR (susceptible→infective→removed)
epidemic in a closed finite population, which draws together the main aspects
of the generalisations of the standard homogeneously mixing model described
above. We consider a population grouped into households, with infectious
contacts at a given per-pair rate, where individuals also make global contacts along the edges of a random graph over the whole population. We use
branching process approximations to derive (i) a threshold parameter, which
determines whether a disease with just a few initial infectives can become
established and infect a non-negligible proportion of the population (an event
we call a major outbreak ); (ii) the probability that a major outbreak occurs;
and (iii) the expected proportion of the population that is infected by a major
outbreak. These results are approximations that become exact in the limit
as the size of the population becomes large in an appropriate way.
A feature of our model is that there is clustering present in the network of
possible contacts, roughly meaning that there are significant numbers of triangles (and other short cycles) present in the network. This is an important
aspect as the presence of triangles captures the phenomenon of people having mutual friends. The effect of such clustering in random networks in an
epidemiological setting has been considered, in different models, by Trapman
(2007) and Britton et al. (2008).
In the remainder of the paper we firstly describe, in Section 2, the full
detail of our model. Then in Section 3 we give the ideas behind the abovementioned branching process approximations. In Section 4 we derive explicit
formulae which allow us to calculate the quantities of interest for two important special cases, then give some brief numerical examples in Section 5,
including demonstrating that our asymptotic results give good approximations for even moderately-sized finite populations. In Section 6 we rigorously
establish the branching process approximations by proving related limit theorems as the population size tends to infinity. The paper concludes with a
brief discussion in Section 7.

Model

We consider a closed population of m households, each of n individuals,
and construct the network of possible global contacts using the ‘configuration model’ (as in Durrett (2006, Chapter 3)) as follows. Firstly assign to each individual a number of half-edges, these numbers being independent realisations of a random variable D (the degree distribution) with
P(D = k) = pk , k = 0, 1, . . .. Conditional on the total number of half-edges
being even we then pair these half-edges with each other uniformly at ran3

dom, whence each such pair of half-edges forms an edge in the (random)
2
graph describing the possible global contacts. We denote by µD and σD
the
mean and variance of the distribution D and assume that both of these quantities are finite. We also note for later reference that if we follow an edge
from one vertex to another then the degree distribution of the second vertex
is the size-biased distribution D̃, where P(D̃ = k) = kpk /µD , k = 1, 2, . . ..
This is because in the construction of the graph the half-edges are paired
uniformly at random, so it is k times more likely that following an edge leads
one to a vertex of degree k than to a vertex of degree 1. By the degree of an
individual we mean the number of individuals adjacent to it in the network
of global contacts, not counting those in its own household.
Note that there may be some imperfections in the graph, in the form of
2
parallel edges and self-loops. However, our assumption that σD
< ∞ ensures
that as m → ∞, the number of these imperfections in the network of global
contacts converges in distribution to a Poisson random variable whose mean
2
is a function of (µD , σD
) (Durrett, 2006, Theorem 3.1.2). By treating the
households as macro-individuals, with degree distribution given by the sum
of n independent copies of D, it follows that the numbers of parallel edges
between households and household self-loops also converge in distribution
to Poisson random variables as m → ∞. Thus the probability that these
imperfections are absent in the graph is bounded away from zero as m → ∞,
and consequently (cf. Janson (2009)) our asymptotic results continue to hold
if the graph is conditioned on having no such imperfections.
When an infective individual makes infectious contact with a susceptible
individual, the susceptible becomes infective and remains so for a random
period of time distributed according to a non-negative real-valued random
variable I, which we specify by its Laplace transform φ(θ) = E[e−θI ], θ ≥
0, and call the infectious period. An infective individual makes infectious
contact with each other member of his/her household at the points of a
Poisson process with rate λL and similarly with each individual he is adjacent
to in the network of global contacts at rate λG . To be emphatic, both λL and
λG are per-pair rates, so an infectious individual of degree k makes infectious
contacts at overall rate λL (n − 1) + λG k. As usual, all Poisson processes and
infectious periods are assumed to be mutually independent.
For ease of presentation, we assume that an epidemic is initiated by a
single infective individual within the population, either a given specific individual or an individual chosen uniformly at random from the population.
Our assumption that all households are of the same size is also made for ease
of presentation although, as indicated in Section 7, our results generalise
easily to incorporate unequal household sizes.

Heuristics and description of main results

We now give informal descriptions of the branching process approximations
we use, firstly to approximate the early stages of an outbreak, leading to a
threshold parameter and a method of calculating the probability of a major
outbreak and, secondly, to approximate the expected relative final size of
(i.e. the proportion of the population infected by) a major outbreak. These
approximations become exact in the limit as the number of households m →
∞, with the household size n held fixed.

3.1

Forward processes

The branching process we use to analyse the early stages of the epidemic
approximates the number of households which become infected in the course
of the epidemic. Because we are interested only in the final outcome of the
epidemic and not its precise time evolution we can think of the epidemic as
evolving in the following way (see, for example, Pellis et al. (2008)). We first
consider the epidemic spreading only within the household containing the
initial infective (the local epidemic that it initiates) and then consider the
number of individuals infected via global infectious contacts made by those
infected by the local epidemic. Because of the way the network is constructed,
in the early stages of the epidemic it is highly likely that these globally
contacted individuals are all in distinct households (this being critical for
the branching process approximation). We then consider each newly infected
household in the same manner: local epidemic followed by global infections.
Again in the early stages it is highly likely that those infected by such global
infectious contacts are in distinct households and furthermore that they are in
previously uninfected households. We can view this as a branching process if
we consider the households infected by a local epidemic initiated by a single
infective within a typical household to be the children (offspring) of that
household.
Note that the offspring distribution of the above branching process is
different for the initial (i.e. zeroth) generation than for subsequent generations, since in subsequent generations the initial infective in a household
has been infected by one of its global neighbours, so the number of uninfected global neighbours of this individual is equal in distribution to D̃ − 1,
whilst in the zeroth generation the initial infective is the initial infective in
the whole population, and the degree distribution of this individual is either
distributed as D or is a fixed constant, according as the initial infective is
chosen (uniformly) at random or a specific individual in the population is
chosen to be the initial infective. We therefore define the random variable
5

C to be the number of global neighbours infected by members of the initial
infective’s household and C̃ to be the number infected by the household of a
single infective that was infected by a global neighbour. Our branching process approximation is then defined by it having a single ancestor (since the
epidemic starts with one initial infective) and offspring distribution C in the
initial generation and C̃ in subsequent generations. Throughout the paper,
we denote a branching process of this type by BP(1, C, C̃), or by BP(1, c, c̃),
where c = (c0 , c1 , . . .) and c̃ = (c̃0 , c̃1 , . . .) are the mass functions of C and
C̃, respectively.
The above branching process approximation of the epidemic is made fully
rigorous in Section 6.4.1, where it is shown that, as m → ∞, the total
number of households infected by the epidemic converges in distribution to
the total progeny of the branching process (see Theorem 1). Thus, whether or
not the epidemic can ‘take off’ and lead to a major outbreak is determined
by whether or not the branching process is supercritical (i.e. whether or
not R∗ = E[C̃] > 1). Further, by standard branching process theory, the
probability of such a major outbreak is given by 1 − fC (σ), where σ is the
smallest solution of fC̃ (s) = s in [0, 1], and fC (s) = E[sC ] and fC̃ (s) = E[sC̃ ]
(for s ∈ [0, 1]) denote the probability generating functions (PGFs) of C and
C̃, respectively. (Here and henceforth we denote by fX (·) the PGF of the
random variable X.) Calculation of R∗ , fC (s) and fC̃ (s) is considered in
Section 4.1.

3.2

Backward processes

We now consider the expected final size of a major outbreak. Again our
analysis is of the m → ∞ limiting epidemic process, for which we find
the probability that a given individual is infected in the event of a major
outbreak. By an exchangeability argument this probability is equal to the
asymptotic mean proportion of the population (individuals, not households)
that are ultimately infected by a major outbreak. This quantity serves as
our approximation of the expected proportion infected in a major outbreak
in a finite population. We determine the probability that a given individual
is infected by considering its susceptibility set (cf. Ball and Lyne (2001) and
Ball and Neal (2002)).
The idea behind susceptibility sets is that for each individual in the population we can, by sampling from the infectious period distribution and then
the relevant Poisson processes, make a (random) list of other individuals it
would infect were it to be infected itself. We then construct a digraph (directed graph) based on these lists, in which the vertices represent individuals
in the population and we put a directed arc from i to j when, were i to
6

become infected, it would make infectious contact with j, i.e. if j is in i’s list.
The susceptibility set of individual i consists of those individuals from which
there exists a path to i in the digraph (including i itself). Note that an individual will become infected by an epidemic if and only if the initial infective is
in its susceptibility set. We also need the concept of a local susceptibility set,
constructed in the same way but considering only local (within-household)
infectious contacts.
We approximate the size of the susceptibility set of an individual chosen
uniformly at random from the population by the total progeny of an appropriate branching process. To construct this branching process we break up
the susceptibility set into ‘generations’ in much the same way as we look at
the spread of infection in the early stages of the epidemic. Starting with an
individual i, consider those individuals j, not in i’s household, who are in
i’s susceptibility set by virtue of an arc leading from j to an individual in
i’s local susceptibility set. These individuals are all in different households
with high probability as m → ∞ and the households they are in comprise
the first ‘generation’ of the susceptibility set. Repeating this process for each
of these individuals j (i.e. looking at the individuals who make infectious
global contact with a member of j’s local susceptibility set) gives the second
‘generation’; and by continuing this process we can construct the whole of i’s
susceptibility set. Because each individual j that joins the susceptibility set
by virtue of a global contact is in a household not previously associated with
the susceptibility set with high probability, the number of households in each
generation is approximated well by the branching process BP(1, B, B̃), where
B and B̃ denote the offspring random variables for the initial and subsequent
generations, which again are typically different.
We show in Section 6.5.2 that, as m → ∞, the conditional probability that
a typical initial susceptible (i say) is infected, given that a major outbreak
occurs, is given by the probability that the branching process BP(1, B, B̃)
avoids extinction (see Theorem 2). An intuitive explanation of this result
is as follows. As m → ∞, (i) the number of households in i’s susceptibility
set converges in distribution to the total progeny of BP(1, B, B̃); and (ii) a
major outbreak necessarily infects at least log m households (cf. Lemma 6).
Thus, as m → ∞, the probability that i’s susceptibility set intersects one of
these log m households is 0 if BP(1, B, B̃) goes extinct and 1 otherwise. The
latter result follows because if BP(1, B, B̃) does not go extinct then the size
of i’s susceptibility set is of exact order m as m → ∞.
The above claim and standard branching process theory imply that the
expected relative final size of a major outbreak in a large finite population
is approximately 1 − fB (ξ), where ξ is the smallest solution of fB̃ (s) = s in
[0, 1]. Calculation of fB (s) and fB̃ (s) is considered in Section 4.2.

Calculations
Forward process

Consider first the threshold parameter R∗ = E[C̃]. Label the individuals in
a household 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, with individual 0 the initial infective, and define
χi to be the indicator of the event that individual i is infected in the local
(i.e. single-household) epidemic and Ci to be the number of global neighbours
with which i makes infectious contact, if i were to become infected. Then
C̃ = C0 +

n−1

χi Ci

(4.1)

i=1

and it follows, since C1 and χ1 are independent and (C1 , χ1 ), (C2 , χ2 ), . . . , (Cn−1, χn−1 )
are identically distributed, that
R∗ = E[C0 ] + E[T ] E[C1 ],

(4.2)

where T is the final size of the within-household epidemic (not counting the
initial infective). Denote by Ii and Ki the infectious period and number
of global neighbours, not including its infector, of individual i (this only
affects the initial infective within the household). Now, since infectious contacts between different pairs of individuals are independent, Ci | Ki , Ii ∼
Bin(Ki , 1 − e−λG Ii ). Thus E[Ci | Ki , Ii ] = Ki (1 − e−λG Ii ), whence, by the
independence of Ki and Ii ,
E[Ci ] = E[Ki ](1 − φ(λG )).

(4.3)

Now, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n−1, Ki has the same distribution as D, the prescribed
degree distribution, so E[Ki ] = µD for such i. However, for the reasons
noted in the first paragraph of Section 2, since the initial infective in the
household was infected by a global infection its degree has the size-biased
distribution D̃, and because one of these neighbours (the one that infected it)
has already been infected, K0 has the same distribution as D̃ − 1, so E[K0 ] =
E[D̃]−1. It follows from the definition of D̃ that E[D̃] = E[D]+Var D/ E[D].
Substituting these into (4.3) and then (4.2), and letting µT = E[T ], yields

The mean µT may be evaluated (typically numerically) by using equations (2.25)
and (2.26) of Ball (1986), thus enabling R∗ to be calculated.

Calculation of the PGFs fC (s) and fC̃ (s) is more difficult because the
number of global infections caused by a particular individual is dependent
on that individual’s infectious period, which also influences whether or not
other individuals in the household become infective and thus the number of
global contacts they might make. It is possible to use the notion of ‘final state
random variables’ introduced by Ball and O’Neill (1999) to find fC and fC̃ ,
but it is not straightforward, so we do not present it here. This methodology
will be discussed in a forthcoming paper concentrating on the more applied
aspects of our model. However, there are two special cases where the above
dependencies do not exist and the analysis is much simpler. These are when
the infectious period is fixed (i.e. almost surely equal to a given constant)
and when the infectious period can be only zero or infinity.
Trapman (2007) describes (using results of Kuulasmaa (1982)) how these
special cases lead to bounds on quantities of interest for a very general class of
epidemic models. Trapman’s arguments hold for any epidemic model where
there is only one ‘kind’ of infectious contact rather than the two (local and
global) that we are concerned with, but the methods can be easily adapted.
In addition, a fixed infectious period is often a reasonable assumption to make
in practice and it is commonly used because it leads to simplifications of the
kind shown shortly (see, for example, Britton et al. (2007) and Britton et al.
(2008)). We therefore proceed to calculate the PGFs fC and fC̃ in these two
special cases as they can be used to calculate the above-mentioned bounds
and they also may give insight into the importance of and interplay between
the parameters of our model. The role of the infectious period distribution
will be discussed in the above-mentioned applied paper.
4.1.1

Zero or infinite infectious period.

Suppose that P(I = ∞) = 1 − P(I = 0) = p for some p ∈ [0, 1]. For
the moment we ignore the differences between the initial and subsequent
generations and denote the generic offspring random variable by unadorned
C. Here we have
(
0,
with probability 1 − p,
C=
Pn−1
C0 + i=1 Ci , with probability p,
where Ci is the number of global neighbours infected by an infectious inD
D
dividual i. Thus C0 = K0 (where = denotes equality in distribution) and
C1 , C2 , . . . , Cn−1 are independent and identically distributed with
(
0,
with probability 1 − p,
Ci =
Ki , with probability p.
9

Also note that the number, N say, of the n − 1 Ci ’s which take the value
Ki (i.e. the number of initially susceptible individuals in the household with
I = ∞) is binomially distributed, with parameters n − 1 and p. We therefore
have
fC (s) = E[sC ] = (1 − p)s0 + p E[sC0 +

= 1 − p + pfK0 (s)(1 − p + pfD (s))n−1 ,
where K0 is D or d in the initial generation and D̃ − 1 in subsequent generations (in which case the PGF is fC̃ rather than fC ).
4.1.2

Fixed infectious period.

Now suppose that P(I = c) = 1 for some c > 0. Again we temporarily
ignore the differences between the initial and subsequent generations, label the individuals 0, 1, . . . , n − 1 and denote by Ci the number of global
neighbours infected by an infectious individual i. Then, letting TPdenote
the final size of the within-household epidemic, we have C = C0 + Ti=1 Ci
and, conditional on the final size, C1 , C2 , . . . , CT are mutually independent.
Now Ci | Ki ∼ Bin(Ki , 1 − e−cλG ), so fCi (s) = fKi (1 − pG + spG ), where
pG = 1 − e−cλG . Thus, by the usual formula for the PGF of a random sum,
fC (s) = fC0 (s)fT (fC1 (s)) = fK0 (1 − pG + spG )fT (fD (1 − pG + spG )), (4.5)
where again K0 is D or d in the initial generation and D̃ − 1 in subsequent
generations. The PGF fT is easily calculated using Theorem 2.6 of Ball
(1986).

4.2

Backward process

Now consider the branching process approximation of the growth (as described in Section 3.2) of the susceptibility set of an individual, i∗ say, chosen
uniformly at random from the population. The offspring distribution of this
process has the same distribution as the number of individuals that make
global contact with the local susceptibility set of a single individual, say individual i. Again we have a distinction between the initial and subsequent
generations but we ignore this for now and denote the random variable of
interest by B. Firstly we write
B = B0 +

M
X
j=1

10

Bj ,

where Bj is the number of contacts made with individual j (again labelling
the individuals within the household 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, with 0 corresponding
to the primary individual i) and M is the size of i’s local susceptibility set,
not counting i itself. (If M = 0 then i’s local susceptibility set consists
of only i itself and the sum is empty.) Now Bj | Kj ∼ Bin(Kj , pG ), where
Kj is the number of global neighbours of j excluding, in the case of the
initial individual, the individual it made contact with in order to join the
susceptibility set and pG = 1 − φ(λG ) is the probability that an infective
individual makes infectious contact with a given global neighbour. We do
not need to condition on the infectious period of individual j because the
contacts we are considering come from other individuals; the independence
of the infectious periods of these individuals implies that they make contacts
with j independently of each other. For a similar reason, B0 , B1 , . . . , BM are
independent. Arguing as in the the derivation of (4.5) yields that
fB (s) = fK0 (1 − pG + spG )fM (fD (1 − pG + spG )),

(4.6)

where now K0 is D in the initial generation (because of how i∗ was chosen)
and D̃ − 1 in subsequent generations.
In order to determine fM we use equation (3.5) of Ball and Neal (2002),
which gives a triangular system of linear equations whose solution is the mass
function of M, from which one can easily calculate the PGF. Note that (4.6)
holds for any choice of infectious period distribution. It is easily verified that
D
in the fixed infectious period case T = M, so fB̃ (s) = fC̃ (s) and, if the initial
infective is chosen uniformly at random from the population, fB (s) = fC (s);
and in the zero or infinite infectious period case M ∼ Bin(n − 1, p), where
p = P(I = ∞), whence fM (s) = (1 − p + ps)n−1 .

Numerical results

We now explore, numerically, some of the features of our model and investigate how they depend on some of its parameters. As a way of examining how
the household size n affects the model, Figure 1 shows the critical values of
the per-pair global contact rate λG and the per-individual local contact rate
λL (n − 1), above which the epidemic is supercritical, for several household
sizes, with the degree distribution and infectious period distribution fixed.
Note that the expected total rate of global contacts per individual remains
constant over these plots since D is held fixed. Note also that if λL = 0 then
n is immaterial, as is λL when n = 1. In these situations there is no local
contact, so we recover the standard network model and the critical value of
λG is at the point the plotted lines converge to as λL → 0. The plot reflects

the fact that, even as the per-individual total contact rate remains constant,
increasing the household size spreads the potential infectious contacts over a
larger number of neighbours, thus avoiding repeated contacts with the same
individual and increasing the spread of the disease. We also observe that,
fixing D and letting λL → ∞, the critical value of λG tends to that for the
standard network P
model with the same infectious period distribution and degree distribution ni=1 Di , where the Di are independent copies of D. This
is because, in this limit, once an individual is infected the whole household
that it is in necessarily becomes infected, and is easily verified using (4.4).
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this model to explore is the dependence of its behaviour on the distribution of D, the number of global
neighbours of a typical individual. Considerable research, conjecture and
discussion has gone into trying to determine distributions which capture the
features of many real life contact networks—Section III.C of Newman (2003)
has an extensive list of references. In Figure 2 we investigate the probability of a major outbreak in our epidemic model for various distributions D
with different properties, in particular different tail behaviours. We use the
standard Poisson and geometric (with support including 0) distributions, as
12

well as an almost surely constant degree and two variants of heavy-tailed
distributions. The first has mass function
(
k∗−a , for k = 1, 2, . . . , k∗ ,
pk ∝
k −a , for k = k∗ + 1, k∗ + 2, . . .,
and the second, with mass function pk ∝ k −a e−k/κ (k = 1, 2, . . .), is a
power law with exponential cut-off which has gained much attention in recent physics literature. We denote these distributions by Pow(k∗ , a) and
PowC(κ, a), respectively. The behaviour of these plots for relatively small

is PowC(κ, 3/2), for κ ∈ [10, 485] (smaller values of k∗ or κ yield subcritical
epidemics). The other parameters of the model are n = 3, I ≡ 1, λL = 1 and
λG = 1/10.
values of µD (where the model is close to critical) is largely determined by
the probability of D taking very large values, i.e. the tail of the distribution,
as this dictates what opportunity the disease might have to really ‘take hold’;
however when µD is large the behaviour of D at small values is more important, as the epidemic can usually move quite freely and this determines the
chance that it might be contained by the network structure.
13

We also briefly investigate whether our asymptotic methods give reasonable approximations to the quantities of interest in finite populations. We
estimate the probability and expected relative final size of a major outbreak
in finite populations from simulations and compare these to the results we
get from our asymptotic analysis. Each simulation consists of generating
a random network and running one epidemic on it. Figure 3 shows estimates of these quantities of interest for increasing numbers m of households
together with the theoretical (m = ∞) values for two choices of degree distribution. The estimates of the major outbreak probability are based on
10,000 simulations for each parameter combination and those that result
in a major outbreak are then used to estimate the expected relative final
size. We have plotted point estimates of the quantities of interest, together
with error bounds based on ±2 standard errors (SE) of the estimator. For
the probability of a major outbreak, estimated as p̂, SE = [p̂(1 − p̂)/n0 ]1/2 ,
where n0 = 10, 000 is the number of simulations. For the relative final size,
−1/2
SE = σ̂n1 , where σ̂ 2 is the sample variance of the relative final sizes and
n1 is the number of simulations that resulted in a major outbreak.
Note that in small finite populations the determination of a cutoff for
whether a particular final size constitutes a major outbreak is practically
impossible; only once the population size is sufficiently large (for m larger
than about 100 in our simulations) does the distinction become clear. In
our calculations we have used a cutoff of 0.15 of the population size, this
being determined by inspecting histograms of the relative final size of the
simulations. Also note that the vertical scale of plots (a) and (c) is different
from that of plots (b) and (d). Figure 3 shows that our asymptotic results
give good approximations for these quantities of interest for populations of
only a few hundred households. Though the asymptotic values of both the
major outbreak probability and the expected relative final size seem to consistently overestimate these values for the finite populations (as one would
expect since the approximating branching process treats each global infection
as an infection of a previously uninfected household, thus overestimating disease spread), even for populations of only 100 households the relative error
is much less than 5%. It also seems that having a heavy-tailed degree distribution may make the convergence to the asymptotic value a little slower
(compare plots (b) and (d) at around 200–500 households), but the effect
seems to be only very slight. Another interesting observation is that the
relative final size seems to be appreciably more efficiently estimated by our
simulation methods than the probability of a major outbreak. This is owing
(at least in part) to the fact that from each simulation we simply observe the
occurrence or otherwise of a major outbreak—one observation of the forward
process—whereas when a major outbreak does occur, the proportion infected

Proofs
Overview

In this section we provide a fully rigorous justification of the results discussed in Section 3 concerning the threshold behaviour of the epidemic model
and its final outcome in the event of a major outbreak. This subsection
gives a brief outline of our methods of proof. The starting point is a sequence D = (D1 , D2 , . . .) of independent copies of D. For m = 1, 2, . . .,
(D1 , D2 , . . . , Dmn ) is used to give the degrees of the mn individuals in a
population of m households. We then define a realisation of the epidemic,
E (m) say, viewed on a generation basis, and a realisation of an approximating
(m)
branching process, say Y (m) = (Yk , k = 0, 1, . . .) (see Section 6.2). In E (m)
the network is formed, i.e. the half-edges are paired up, as the epidemic progresses. The branching process Y (m) is similar to the branching process, Y
say, described in Section 3.1, except the empirical distribution of the degrees
D1 , D2 , . . . , Dmn is used in place of the degree distribution D. The epidemic
E (m) and approximating branching process Y (m) are coupled so that they
coincide until a random number, τ (m) + 1, of households have been infected
in E (m) . It is shown that P(τ (m) > k) → 1 as m → ∞ for all k ∈ Z+ , so
Ẑ (m) , the number of households infected in E (m) , and Ŷ (m) , the total progeny
of Y (m) , have the same limiting distribution as m → ∞. (We use Z+ to denote the positive integers including 0 and N to denote the strictly positive
integers.) Now, Y (m) converges in distribution to Y as m → ∞, so Ẑ (m) is
asymptotically distributed as Ŷ , the total progeny of Y (see Theorem 1),
thus providing a formal justification of the threshold behaviour described in
Section 3.1.
Suppose now that R∗ > 1, so that major outbreaks are possible. Let tm =
⌊2 log log m/ log R∗ ⌋, where, for x ∈ R, ⌊x⌋ denotes the greatest integer ≤ x.
We show (cf. Lemma 7) that there exists β > 1 such that limm→∞ P(log m <
(m)
(m)
Ztm < (log m)β ) = P(Ŷ = ∞), where Ztm is the number of infectious
households in generation tm of E (m) . It follows that, with probability tending
to 1 as m → ∞, a major outbreak has at least log m and at most (log m)β
infectious households in generation tm .
We next consider the probability that a typical individual, i∗ say, that
is susceptible at time tm in E (m) ultimately becomes infected. We do this
(m)
by stopping the construction of E (m) at time tm , leaving the Ztm infectious
16

(‘live’) half-edges unconnected, and constructing the susceptibility set, S (m)
say, of i∗ in ‘generations’ as described in Section 3.2, pairing up the half-edges
as we construct the susceptibility set. If at any point in the construction of
(m)
S (m) a half-edge is paired up with one of the Ztm live half-edges from the
epidemic then i∗ is ultimately infected, otherwise i∗ is not infected by the
epidemic. Note that for any individual, i say, in S (m) we need to explore
all of i’s global neighbours (and not just those that join S (m) ), since if any
(m)
half-edge emanating from i is paired with one of the Ztm live half-edges then
i∗ is ultimately infected. Thus we need to construct simultaneously A(m) , the
set of global neighbours of S (m) , also on a generation basis.
(m)
(m)
Let (S (m) , A(m) ) = ((Sk , Ak ), k = 0, 1, . . .) describe the number of
households in successive generations of (S (m) , A(m) ). In Section 6.2, we construct realisations of (S (m) , A(m) ) and an approximating two-type branching
(m)
(m)
(m)
process (X (m) , XA ) = ((Xk , XAk ), k = 0, 1, . . .). The process X (m) is a
single-type branching process that is similar to the branching process, X say,
described in Section 3.2, except, as with Y (m) , the empirical distribution of
D1 , D2 , . . . , Dmn is used instead of the degree distribution D. The process
(m)
XA corresponds to global neighbours of S (m) who are not in S (m) ; individu(m)
(m)
als in XA have no offspring. The processes (S (m) , A(m) ) and (X (m) , XA ) are
coupled so that they coincide until τ̄ (m) +1 households have joined S (m) ∪A(m) ,
(m)
where P(τ̄ (m) > k) → 1 as m → ∞ for all k ∈ Z+ . Let Ŵ (m) and ŴA denote the number of households in S (m) and A(m) , respectively, and let X̂ (m)
and X̂ denote the total progenies of X (m) and X, respectively. As with E (m) ,
Ŵ (m) and X̂ (m) have the same limiting distribution as m → ∞, which, since
X (m) converges in distribution to X as m → ∞, is given by the distribution
(m)
of X̂. Now, for any k ∈ N, if Ŵ (m) + ŴA ≤ k then the probability that S (m)
(m)
intersects with one of the Ztm live half-edges tends to 0 as m → ∞ (since a
major outbreak has at most (log m)β infectious households at generation tm
of the forward process), so the limiting (as m → ∞) probability that i∗ is
ultimately infected by a major outbreak is at most P(X̂ = ∞). (Note that
(m)
(X (m) , XA ) goes extinct if and only if X (m) goes extinct.)
We also construct, for all sufficiently small ε ∈ (0, 1), a branching process
(m)
, which is a lower bound for S (m) as long as Ŵ (m) ≤ εm; whence
εX
(m)
P(Ŵ
> εm) ≥ P(ε X̂ (m) = ∞), where ε X̂ (m) denotes the total progeny of
(m)
. As m → ∞, ε X̂ (m) converges in distribution to ε X̂, the total progeny
εX
of a branching process ε X say. Moreover, for any ε > 0, if Ŵ (m) > εm the
(m)
probability that S (m) intersects one of the Ztm live half-edges tends to 1 as
m → ∞ (since a major outbreak has at least log m infectious households
at generation tm of the forward process), so the limiting probability that i∗
is ultimately infected is at least P(ε X̂ = ∞). Furthermore, P(ε X̂ = ∞) →
17

P(X̂ = ∞) as ε ↓ 0, which, combined with the result described at the end
of the previous paragraph, shows that the probability that i∗ is ultimately
infected by a major outbreak tends to P(X̂ = ∞) as m → ∞ (see Theorem 2).
It follows that the expected proportion of the population that are infected
by a major outbreak also tends to P(X̂ = ∞) as m → ∞ (see Corollary 2).
Our results are proved by conditioning on the degree sequence D and
showing that they hold for P-almost all D. The unconditional results then
follow using the dominated convergence theorem. As remarked above, the
network of global contacts is now constructed as the epidemic/susceptibility
set evolves, not a priori as in our model description in Section 2. This
implicitly
Pmnmeans that, rather than conditioning on the total number of halfedges
i=1 Di being
Pmn even, we simply ignore the single left-over half-edge
in the event of i=1 Di being odd. This small change does not affect the
asymptotic results as m → ∞ (cf. van der Hofstad et al. (2007, Section 1.1)).
The remainder of this section is organised as follows. The main constructions are described in Section 6.2, with the epidemics E (m) and their
approximating branching processes being described in Section 6.2.1 and the
susceptibility set processes and their approximating branching processes being described in Section 6.2.2. Some notation concerning the offspring distributions of various branching processes is given in Section 6.2.3. Section 6.3
contains some preliminary results, and the main results are given in Sections 6.4 and 6.5, which analyse the epidemics E (m) and the susceptibility
set processes (S (m) , A(m) ), respectively.

6.2

Construction of approximating branching processes

Let (Ω1 , F1, P1 ) be a probability space, on which is defined a sequence D =
(D1 , D2 , . . .) of independent random variables, each distributed according to
the degree distribution D. Also let (Ω2 , F2 , P2 ) be a probability space, on
which are defined the following mutually independent random quantities:
(i) for every (d, j) = ((d1 , d2, . . . , dn ), j) ∈ Zn+ × {1, 2, . . . , n}, a sequence
(d,j)
(d,j)
of random variables Φ1 , Φ2 , . . ., which are independent copies of
the random variable Φ(d,j) defined below.
(ii) for every (d, j) ∈ Zn+ × {1, 2, . . . , n}, a sequence of random variables
(d,j)
(d,j)
(d,j)
(d,j)
(Ψ1 , ΨA1 ), (Ψ2 , ΨA2 ), . . ., which are independent copies of the
(d,j)
random variable (Ψ(d,j), ΨA ) also defined below.
We also require other random variables defined on (Ω2 , F2, P2 ), but these are
described only informally because the detail is unnecessary for our proofs.
18

The random variable Φ(d,j) describes the number of global neighbours
with which infectious contact is made by members of a household of individuals with degrees given by d = (d1 , d2 , . . . , dn ) in which individual j is
initially infected and is defined as follows. Let G be the random directed
graph on the vertices V = {1, 2, . . . , n} obtained as follows. For each vertex
i we take an independent realisation, Ii say, of the infectious period distribution I and then put an arc from i to each other vertex in V independently
with probability 1 − e−λL Ii . Given G, let C1 , C2 , . . . , Cn be independent random variables with Ci | I1 , I2 , . . . , In P
∼ Bin(d′i , 1 − eλG Ii ), where d′i = di if
i 6= j and d′j = dj − 1. Then Φ(d,j) = ni=1 1{j❀i} Ci , where j ❀ i denotes the
event that there is a path from vertex j to vertex i in G (with the convention
that i ❀ i).
(d,j)
In a similar manner, the two components of the random variable (Ψ(d,j) , ΨA )
describe the number of global neighbours of the local susceptibility set of individual j in a household of individuals with degrees given by d = (d1 , d2 , . . . , dn )
that do and do not make global infectious contact with their neighbour in that
susceptibility set. To this end, let G be the random graph described above
and, conditional on G, let B1 , B2 , . . . , Bn be independent random variables
with Bi ∼ Bin(d′i , pG ), where d′1 , d′2 , . . . , d′n are as above and pG = 1 − φ(λG ).
P
(d,j)
We then have (Ψ(d,j) , ΨA ) = ni=1 1{i❀j} (Bi , d′i − Bi ).
We now introduce some further notation. For k = 1, 2, . . ., let D k =
(Dk1 , Dk2 , . . . , Dkn ), where, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, Dki = D(k−1)n+i
is the degree
Pn
of the ith individual in the kth household. Let Hk = i=1 Dki denote the
P
(m)
total degree of the kth household. Lastly, denote by µH = m1 m
i=1 Hi
the (empirical) mean number of edges emanating from each of the first m
households.
The epidemic, susceptibility sets and approximating branching processes
are defined on the probability space (Ω, F , P) = (Ω1 , F1, P1 ) × (Ω2 , F2 , P2 ).
Our construction and most of our calculations will henceforth be conditional
on the degree sequence D. To this end, we denote P(· | D) by PD (·) and
similarly E[· | D] by ED [·]. Conditional on this degree sequence and for every m = 1, 2, . . ., we now describe the construction of a branching process,
Y (m) , which approximates the early stages of the spread of the epidemic
amongst households 1, 2, . . . , m; then another (two-type) branching process,
(m)
(X (m) , XA ), which approximates the ‘early growth’ of the susceptibility set
(and its global neighbours) of a typical initially susceptible individual in that
population.

19

6.2.1

The forward processes.
(m)

We first describe the branching process Y (m) . Set Y0 = 1 and choose an
individual uniformly at random from 1, 2, . . . , mn. Suppose it is individual
(D ∆ +eι ,ι)
(m)
ι ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} of household ∆0 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}. Then Y1 = Φ1 0
,
where ei is the unit n-vector with a 1 in the ith position. For subsequent
generations k ≥ 2, we continue the construction as follows. For each j =
(m)
(m)
1, 2, . . . , Yk−1 , sample a half-edge uniformly at random from the mµH halfedges in the population and, supposing it emanates from individual ι of
(m)
(D ∆ ,ι)
household ∆, set Ykj = Φν(∆,ι)+1
, where ν(∆, ι) is the number of times we
(D ∆ ,ι)

have sampled previously from the sequence Φ1

The branching process Y (m) and the epidemic process E (m) can be coupled by using the same D, Φ’s and uniformly random samples. However,
the coupling breaks down as soon as a half-edge is sampled that emanates
from a household that either has been used previously in the epidemic or
is a neighbour of such a previously used household. If a previously used
half-edge is sampled then in E (m) another half-edge needs to be sampled.
If an unused half-edge that emanates from a previously used household is
sampled then in E (m) the spread of the epidemic within that household is
different from in Y (m) since there are fewer susceptibles. Finally, if a halfedge emanating from a household neighbouring a household previously used
in E (m) is sampled then the spread of the epidemic from that household is in
general different from that in Y (m) , since the (effective) degree distribution
of individuals in that household may be different from that assumed in Y (m) .
(When constructing E (m) one needs also to pair up non-infectious half-edges
from infectious individuals.) In all of these cases the construction of E (m) can
be continued appropriately but the detail is not important for our purposes.
However, we do need a bound on the size of, and number of half-edges that
emanate from, the ‘bad set’ of households that must be avoided in order that
Y (m) and E (m) remain coupled. To that end we describe another branching
(m)
process T (m) = (Tk , k = 1, 2, . . .), which provides such a bound.
(m)
(m)
Let T0 be the total degree of the initial household in Y (m) , so T0 =
(m)
H∆0 , where ∆0 is as above. For k = 1, 2, . . ., Tk is determined as follows.
(m)
For each j = 1, 2, . . . , Tk−1 , a half-edge is sampled uniformly at random from
(m)
the mµH half-edges in the population, say this half-edge emanates from
(m)
PTk−1
(m)
(m)
(m)
household ∆j , and then put Tkj = H∆j − 1. Finally, set Tk = j=1
Tkj .
20

The processes Y (m) , E (m) and T (m) can be coupled in an P
obvious fashion
(m)
(m)
(k =
so that their sampled half-edges correspond. Let T̂k = kl=0 Tl
(m)
(m)
0, 1, . . .) be the total progeny of T
up to generation k. Then 2T̂k+1 provides
an upper bound for the number of half-edges that emanate from (and hence
also for the size) of the bad set of households in generation k of E (m) . The
index k + 1 arises because the bad set consists of not just all households
infected up to generation k of E (m) but also their neighbouring households.
The factor 2 arises because T (m) does not count the receiving half-edge when
the half-edges are paired up.
The above construction of Y (m) (and implicitly E (m) ) is continued for a
fixed number of generations, tm , and T (m) is continued for tm + 1 generations.
(Of course, some or all of these processes may die out beforehand.)
6.2.2

The backward processes.
(m)

The two-type branching process (X (m) , XA ) is defined analogously to Y (m)
(d,j)
(d,j)
(d,j)
except the random variables (Ψi , ΨAi ) are used instead of Φi
(recall
(m)
(m)
that there are no offspring in XA ). The process X
approximates the
growth, described by generations as in Section 3.2, of the susceptibility set of
an individual chosen uniformly at random from all susceptible individuals at
(m)
time tm in the epidemic process E (m) and XA approximates the number of
global neighbours of this susceptibility set, also on a generation basis. The
(m)
processes (X (m) , XA ) and (S (m) , A(m) ) can be coupled in a similar fashion
to that used for Y (m) and E (m) , though note that now the coupling breaks
down if a sampled half-edge emanates from either (i) a household previously
used in the susceptibility set, (ii) a household neighbouring such a household,
or (iii) a household or neighbour of a household used in the forward process
up to time tm . Also note that this coupling may break down at generation
0 (if the initial individual is in a household that is either infected in E (m) or
a neighbour of a household infected in E (m) ). As with the epidemic process
E (m) , the construction of (S (m) , A(m) ) can be continued appropriately after
the coupling breaks down but we do not require such detail.

Let Y = (Y0 , Y1 , . . .), X = (X0 , X1 , . . .) and T = (T0 , T1 , . . .) be the
branching processes BP(1, c, c̃), BP(1, b, b̃) and, in an obvious notation,
BP(r, r̃, r̃), respectively. Note that the branching processes Y and X are
those described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Note especially that,
in the notation of Section 3.1, this implies that µ̃c = R∗ . We also require a
(m)
two-type branching process (X, A), defined analagously to (X (m) , XA ) but
again using pd and p̃d in defining the offspring distribution instead of the
(m)
(m)
empirical versions pd and p̃d .

Preliminary results

In this section we collect some results required in the analysis of the forward
and backward processes. Recall that we have made the assumption that
2
σD
= Var D is finite (although some results only require µD < ∞).

Here and henceforth, convergence of a sequence of sequences is interpreted
(m)
elementwise, so, for example, limm→∞ c(m) = c means that limm→∞ ck = ck
for each k = 0, 1, . . ..
Proof. By the strong law of large numbers, there exists A2 ∈ F1 with P1 (A2 ) =

It follows that limm→∞ µ̃c (ω1 ) = µ̃c for all ω1 ∈ A2 ∩ A4 . Similar arguments
hold for the other means in (iv) and the lemma is thus proved.
Remark. Throughout the remainder of the paper, A1 refers to a set that
satisfies the statement of Lemma 1.
The following result concerns the convergence of certain quantities associated with a sequence of branching processes when their offspring distributions
converge in distribution.
Lemma 2. Suppose that a, ã, a(m) and ã(m) (m = 1, 2, . . .) are probability
distributions satisfying a(m) → a and ã(m) → ã as m → ∞. Let Y (m) ∼
BP(1, a(m) , ã(m) ) (m = 1, 2, . . .) and Y ∼ BP(1, a, ã). Then, denoting by
Ŷ (m) (respectively Ŷ ) the total progeny of Y (m) (respectively Y ),
24

(i) lim P(Ŷ (m) = k) = P(Ŷ = k) (k = 1, 2, . . .);
m→∞

(ii) lim P(Ŷ (m) = ∞) = P(Ŷ = ∞), provided ã1 6= 1.
m→∞

Proof. Part (i) follows immediately by considering the sum of the probabilities of the finite number of sample paths of Y (m) with Ŷ (m) = k. Part (ii) is
a simple extension of Lemma 4.1 of Britton et al. (2007).
Remarks.
1. The condition in part (ii) of the lemma is in practice only a technical
condition which will always hold true. As pointed out by Britton et
al. (2007), although the case ã1 = 1 really can be an exception (for
(m)
(m)
example if ã0 = 1 − ã1 = 1/m), such a scenario is, from an applied
viewpoint, decidedly pathological.
2. We sometimes use a slight variant of Lemma 2, where the branching
processes are indexed by ε ∈ (0, 1) and their offspring distributions
converge as ε ↓ 0. Of course, the analogous results hold, and the proof
is exactly the same.
Lastly, we have a result concerning the probability of picking a ‘bad’
half-edge in our constructions of the forward and backward processes.
Lemma 3. Suppose that, for each m = 1, 2, . . ., we draw elements uniformly
(m)
at random, with replacement, from the set J (m) = {1, 2, . . . , mµH }. Suppose
(m)
also that, for each m, there is an increasing sequence of (random) sets J1 ⊂
(m)
J2 ⊂ · · · ⊂ J (m) and at the ith pick we wish to avoid picking a member of
(m)
(m)
(m)
(m)
Ji . Denote the ith pick by χi and let τ (m) = min{i : χi ∈ Ji } − 1
be the number of picks we make before making a pick from a set we wish
to avoid. Suppose further that there exist strictly positive integers g(m) and
h(m) (m = 1, 2, . . .) satisfying limm→∞ g(m)h(m)m−1 = 0 and
(m)

lim PD(ω1 ) (Jg(m) ≤ h(m)) = 1

m→∞
(m)

for all ω1 ∈ A1 , where Ji

Analysis of forward process
Threshold theorem for the epidemic E (m) .

In order to prove a threshold theorem for the epidemic we first establish a
bound for the size of the bad set of half-edges after k generations of the
epidemic E (m) . Recall (from the discussion at the end of Section 6.2.1) that
(m)
the number of half-edges in this set is bounded by 2T̂k+1 .
Lemma 4. For all ω1 ∈ A1 ,
(m)

lim PD(ω1 ) (T̂k

(k = 1, 2, . . .).
(m)

(m)

Proof. Fix ω1 ∈ A1 . Then note that ED(ω1 ) [T̂k ] = µr (ω1 ){1 + µ̃r (ω1 ) +
(m)
(m)
(m)
(m)
(µ̃r (ω1 ))2 + · · · + (µ̃r (ω1 ))k } and also that µr (ω1 ) ≤ µ̃r (ω1 ) + 1. Thus
(m)
(m)
ED(ω1 ) [T̂k ] ≤ (k + 1)(µ̃r (ω1 ) + 1)k+1 and, by Markov’s inequality,
(m)

PD(ω1 ) (T̂k (ω1 ) > log m) ≤

k + 1 (m)
(µ̃r (ω1 ) + 1)k+1 .
log m

(m)

The lemma now follows, since µ̃r (ω1 ) → µ̃r as m → ∞ for all ω1 ∈ A1 , by
Lemma 1(iv).
For m = 1, 2, . . ., let Ẑ (m) denote the total number of households infected
in the epidemic E (m) , including the initial household, and let Ŷ (m) and Ŷ be
the total progeny, including the initial individual, of the branching processes
Y (m) and Y , respectively. We now show that the total number of households
infected in E (m) converges in distribution to the total progeny of Y .

Theorem 1. For k = 1, 2, . . .,
(i) for all ω1 ∈ A1 , lim PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) = k) = P(Ŷ = k);
m→∞

(ii) lim P(Ẑ (m) = k) = P(Ŷ = k).
m→∞

Proof. Fix ω1 ∈ A1 and let τ (m) be the number of households infected by
E (m) before a bad half-edge is chosen. Fix k ∈ N. Then
PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) = k) = PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) = k , τ (m) ≤ k)+PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) = k , τ (m) > k).

so

as m → ∞, by Lemma 4. Thus, using Lemma 3 with g(m) = k and h(m) =
2 log m, limm→∞ PD(ω1 ) (τ (m) > k) = 1. Therefore, limm→∞ PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) =
k , τ (m) ≤ k) = 0 and, recalling (6.6),

using the dominated convergence theorem, proving assertion (ii).

6.4.2

Early behaviour of major outbreaks.

Theorem 1 shows that the total number of households infected in E (m) converges in distribution as m → ∞ to the total progeny of Y , so if µ̃c ≤ 1 only
minor outbreaks can occur in the limit as m → ∞ (recall that R∗ = µ̃c ).
We now assume that µ̃c > 1 and study the early behaviour of E (m) when a
major outbreak occurs. For m = 1, 2, . . ., let
tm = ⌊2 log log m/ log µ̃c ⌋ .
27

We obtain a bound on the size of the ‘bad set’ of half-edges at time tm and
show that, with probability tending to 1 as m → ∞, in a major outbreak
there are at least log m infected households after tm generations of the epidemic process.
Lemma 5. There exists β ∈ (1, ∞) such that, for all ω1 ∈ A1 ,
(m)

lim PD(ω1 ) (T̂tm +1 ≥ (log m)β ) = 0.

m→∞

Proof. Fix ω1 ∈ A1 and note that, for all sufficiently large m,
(m)

ED(ω1 ) [T̂tm +1 ] = µr(m) (ω1 )(1 + µ̃r(m) (ω1 ) + · · · + (µ̃r(m) (ω1 ))tm +1 )
≤

(m)

Thus, by Markov’s inequality, for such m,

(6.7)

It is readily shown, by considering its logarithm and using Lemma 1(iv),
that, for all sufficiently large β, the right hand side of (6.7) tends to 0 as
m → ∞, and the lemma follows.
Lemma 6. For all ω1 ∈ A1 ,
(m)

lim PD(ω1 ) (Ytm > log m) = P(Ŷ = ∞).

m→∞

Proof. Note that either (i) c and c̃ both have infinite support, or (ii) c and
c̃ are supported on {0, 1, . . . , ndmax } and {0, 1, . . . , ndmax − 1} (or subsets
thereof) respectively, where dmax = max{k : pk > 0}.

so ε < ε and ε̃ < ε. Note that k0 and k̃0 are well-defined whenever
ε < 1 − (c0 ∨ c̃0 ) (where a ∨ b = max(a, b)), and also that both k0 and
k̃0 tend to ∞ as ε ↓ 0. Now let Y ε = (Ykε , k = 0, 1, . . .) ∼ BP(1, cε , c̃ε ),
′
where cε has elements cεi = ci + k0ε+1 for i = 0, 1, . . . , k0 and cεi = 0 for i > k0 ,
and c̃ε = (c̃εi , i = 0, 1, . . .) is defined similarly
but with ci , ε′ andPk0 replaced

by c̃i , ε̃′ and k̃0 , respectively. Also let µε = k=1 kcεk and µ̃ε = ∞

Now, note that i=0 ci < i=0 ci (k = 0, 1, . . .), so µε < µc . We also

have µε = ki=1
ici ≥ i=1 ici → µc as ε ↓ 0, so µε → µc as ε ↓ 0. Similarly,
28

µ̃ε → µ̃c as ε ↓ 0. Now fix ω1 ∈ A1 . Then, by Lemma 1(iii), c(m) (ω1 ) → c
and c̃(m) (ω1 ) → c̃ as m → ∞, so there exists M(ε, ω1 ) such that, for all
(m)

Now, note that ∞

by the well known result concerning the exponential growth of branching

a random variable W ε , which

Recalling that µ̃ε → µ̃c as ε → 0 we see that, for sufficiently small ε,

follows from (6.8) that, for such ε,
(m)

lim inf PD(ω1 ) (Ytm > log m) ≥ P(W ε > 0) = P(Ŷ ε = ∞).
m→∞

(6.9)

Now, cε → c and c̃ε → c̃ as ε ↓ 0, so letting ε ↓ 0 in (6.9) and using
Lemma 2(ii) yields
(m)

lim inf PD(ω1 ) (Ytm > log m) ≥ P(Ŷ = ∞).

Now, for k = 1, 2, . . .,

(m)

lim sup PD(ω1 ) (Ytm > log m) ≤ P(Ŷ = ∞),

which, together with (6.10), establishes the lemma.
In case (ii), a suitable lower bounding branching process is obtained by
setting, for ε < cndmax ∧ c̃ndmax −1 (where a ∧ b = min(a, b)), cεi = ci + ε/(ndmax)
(i = 0, 1, . . . , ndmax − 1), cεndmax = cdmax − ε, c̃εi = c̃i + ε/(ndmax − 1) (i =

(using Lemmas 5 and 7),

and assertion (i) follows. Assertion (ii) then follows using the dominated

30

Note that Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 imply that if (hm ) is any sequence of
real numbers satisfying hm → ∞ as m → ∞ and hm < log m for all m, then
limm→∞ PD(ω1 ) (Ẑ (m) ∈ [hm , log m)) = 0 for all ω1 ∈ A1 and limm→∞ P(Ẑ (m) ∈
[hm , log m)) = 0. Thus, for m = 1, 2, . . ., it is natural to define a major
outbreak as one which infects at least log m households, i.e. as one in which
the event Ḡ(m) = {ω ∈ Ω : Ẑ (m) (ω) > log m} occurs. Let G(m) = {ω ∈ Ω :
(m)
(m)
Ztm > log m , T̂tm +1 < (log m)β }, where β is as in Lemma 5. Clearly G(m) ⊆
Ḡ(m) , and Lemma 5 and Corollary 1 imply limm→∞ PD(ω1 ) (Ḡ(m) \ G(m) ) = 0
for all ω1 ∈ A1 and limm→∞ P(Ḡ(m) \ G(m) ) = 0, so we can take G(m) as our
working definition of a major outbreak.

Analysis of backward process
Lower bounding branching processes.

We now analyse the ‘backward’ process, which describes the generation-wise
growth of the susceptibility set (and its neighbours) of a typical individual
that is susceptible at time tm in the forward process, in order to find the
asymptotic probability that such an individual is ultimately infected, given
(m)
(m)
that a major outbreak occurs (i.e. Ztm > log m and T̂tm +1 < (log m)β , where
β is as in Lemma 5). To this end, it is fruitful to have, for all sufficiently
small ε > 0, a branching process ε X (m) which asymptotically bounds S (m)
from below until the susceptibility set covers a proportion ε of the households
in the population (cf. Whittle (1955)). In order to do this, we need an almost
sure bound, η̄(ε), for the proportion of households that are neighbours of the
susceptibility set when the size (in terms of households) of the susceptibility
set is at most εm, which we now obtain.
Suppose that D has infinite support. Recall the definitions of pH (·) and
p̃H (·) from Section 6.2.3. Let k1 = min{k : pH (k) > P
0} and ε0 = 1−pH (k1 )−
pH (k1 +1). Then, for ε ∈ (0, ε0 ), let κ(ε) = max{k :P ki=k1 pH (i) ∈ (0, 1−ε)},
κ∗ (ε) = max{k < κ(ε) : pH (k) > 0} and η(ε) = ∞
i=κ∗ (ε) p̃H (i). (The definition of κ∗ (ε) requires κ(ε) > k1 , which in turn requires ε < ε0 .) Note
that η(ε) ↓ 0 as ε ↓ 0. Let η̄(ε) = 2nµD η(ε) and, for m = 1, 2, . . .,

as m → ∞, using (6.14) and Lemma 1(i). Assertion (6.12) follows upon
recalling the definition of κ∗ (ε). The second assertion (6.13) follows from
the first assertion after applying Lemma 1(i) and recalling the definition of
η̄(ε).
Remarks.
1. If dmax < ∞ (i.e. D has finite support) then it is readily seen that
Lemma 8 holds with η(ε) = 2dmax ε/µD and η̄(ε) = ndmax ε.
2. For ω1 ∈ A1 , Lemma 8 provides, for all sufficiently large m, a bound
for the number of half-edges that emanate from households in a susceptibility set (and hence also for the number of households neighbouring
a susceptibility set), if the susceptibility set contains no more than εm
households. The number of such half-edges, H (m) (ε) say, is given by
the sum of the degrees of the households in the susceptibility set, which
is bounded by the sum of the degrees of the [εm] households of highest
degree. Thus, by (6.13), H (m) (ε) ≤ mη̄(ε) for all sufficiently large m.
Recall from Section 6.2.2 that the coupling of the susceptibility set process
S (m) and its approximating branching process X (m) breaks down when a halfedge is sampled that emanates from an appropriate ‘bad’ set of households.
This can happen in two fundamentally different ways. First, a half-edge
through which we try to extend the susceptibility set may be paired up with
another half-edge through which we want to extend the susceptibility set in
the same generation. Note that in this case, neither of the two half-edges concerned actually extends the susceptibility set. Second, the half-edge may be
paired with a bad half-edge which is not one through which we wish to extend
the susceptibility set in the current generation, in which case the susceptibility set may still be extended, though the offspring distribution is different
to that in the branching process. We treat these two cases
Pk sequentially.

that a half-edge is paired with another half-edge through which we want to
extend the susceptibility set in the same generation is no more than η(ε).
(m)
For such m, suppose that at some generation k there are Xk−1 = i ‘live’ halfedges through which we attempt to extend the susceptibility set. Denote by

YL the number of these half-edges that do not pair up with another of these
p
st
i live half-edges and let Y̌L ∼ Bin(i, 1 − η(ε)). We now show that YL ≥ Y̌L .
First, define another random variable ŶL as follows. Take a live half-edge,
then with probability η(ε) pair it up with another live half-edge, otherwise
it ‘survives’ to be connected with a non-live half-edge. Repeat this process
until all live half-edges have been either paired up or designated to survive.
Note that if there is a single live half-edge left at the end of this procedure,
it must survive. Let ŶL be the number of surviving half-edges under this
regime. Since the proportion of half-edges that are actually live is less than
st

st

η(ε), YL ≥ ŶL . We now show that ŶL ≥ Y̌L by describing these two random
variables as the number of renewals of a discrete-time renewal process by
time i and showing that the corresponding lifetime distributions, T̂ and Ť
st

say, satisfy T̂ ≤ Ť . This we achieve by taking a lifetime in the renewal process
as being the number of half-edges examined to find a surviving half-edge. It
k−1
1
is immediate that P(Ť = k) = (1 − η(ε) 2 )η(ε) 2 , k = 1, 2, . . .. Now, since
pairing one live half-edge with another obviously uses up two half-edges, T̂
cannot take even values and P(T̂ = 2k + 1) = (1 − η(ε))η(ε)k , k = 0, 1, . . ..
Elementary calculation shows that P(T̂ ≥ k) ≤ P(Ť ≥ k), k = 1, 2, . . ., so
st

st

Ť ≥ T̂ , whence ŶL ≥ Y̌L .
The above argument shows that, in a given generation, the number of
half-edges that survive to be paired with non-live half-edges is stochastically
p
larger than if they survive independently with probability 1 − η(ε). Now
consider a live half-edge that survives this first stage and thus is paired with
a half-edge chosen uniformly at random from all the non-live half-edges. The
probability that it avoids being paired with a half-edge from the bad set is
therefore larger than if it were paired with a half-edge chosen uniformly at
(m)
random from all of the half-edges. Recall that p̃d is the probability that
(m)
a half-edge chosen at random from all mµH half-edges in the population
emanates from a household of type d. Further, for ω1 ∈ A1 and m sufficiently
(m)
large, conditional on choosing a household of type d, if Ŵk ≤ εm and
(m)
Ytm < (log m)β then the probability of choosing a bad household is bounded
above by
(log m)β + εm + η̄(ε)m
(m)
γ̃d (ε) =
∧ 1.
(m)
mp̃d
This bound is obtained by noting that, under the stated conditions, there are
fewer than (log m)β bad households from the forward process, fewer than εm
households in the susceptibility set and fewer than η̄(ε)m households that
are neighbours of the susceptibility set; and then assuming that all of these
34

bad households are of type d.
(m)
It follows from this discussion that, for m sufficiently large and if Ytm <
(m)
(log m)β , then while Ŵk ≤ εm the susceptibility set process S (m) is stochastically larger than a branching process, ε X (m) say, in which eachppotential
birth (live half-edge) is aborted independently with probability η(ε) and
the potential offspring (live half-edges) of an unaborted birth are obtained
(m)
(m)
by first sampling d according to p̃d , then with probability γ̃d (ε) this unaborted birth is aborted at this stage and otherwise its potential offspring is
distributed according to the random variable Ψ̃d defined at the end of the
paragraph following (6.3).
(m)
The number, X̄1 say, of potential births that emanate from the initial
individual in the susceptibility set may be found as follows. First a household
is chosen uniformly at random from the households not infected by time tm
in the forward process. Suppose that this household is of type d. Then, if
(m)
this household is not a neighbour of a household in the forward process, X̄1
is distributed according to the random variable Ψd , also defined in the paragraph immediately following (6.3). If the sampled household is a neighbour
(m)
of a household in the forward process then X̄1 has a different distribution.
(m)
Suppose that T̂tm +1 < (log m)β . Then the number of households that are
neighbours of the forward process is less than 2(log m)β and it follows that

shows that, for all ω1 ∈ A1 , the offspring laws of (X (m) , XA ) converge to

immediately from Lemmas 10 and 2.
6.5.2

Relative final size of a major outbreak.

For m = 1, 2, . . ., let B (m) be the event that an individual chosen uniformly
at random from all individuals that are susceptible at time tm in the forward
process is ultimately infected by the epidemic E (m) . Thus, if A(m) denotes
the set of global neighbours of S (m) then B (m) occurs if and only if one of the
(m)
Ztm ‘live’ half-edges from the forward process is paired in the construction of
S (m) ∪ A(m) . Recall the working definition of a major outbreak, viz. G(m) =
(m)
(m)
{Ztm > log m , T̂tm +1 < (log m)β }, where β is as in Lemma 5.
Theorem 2. For all ω1 ∈ A1 ,
lim PD(ω1 ) (B (m) | G(m) ) = P(X̂ = ∞).

m→∞

(m)

Proof. For m = 1, 2, . . ., let TP be the number of half-edge pairings made
(m)
in the construction of S (m) ∪ A(m) until one of the Ztm live half-edges from
(m)
the forward process is chosen. In determining TP it is assumed that, if
(m)
necessary, the pairings continue after S (m) ∪ A(m) goes extinct and that TP
includes the pairing when the first live half-edge is chosen.
Fix ω1 ∈ A1 . First we obtain an upper bound for PD(ω1 ) (B (m) | G(m) ). For
all fixed k ∈ N,

(6.16)
where τ̄ (m) is the number of households in the construction of S (m) ∪ A(m)
when the first bad half-edge is chosen. Note that τ̄ (m) = 1 if the initial
(m)
individual in (X (m) , XA ) belongs to the set of bad households at time tm in
the forward process. Given G(m) , the number of such bad households is less
than (log m)β , so PD(ω1 ) (τ̄ (m) = 1 | G(m) ) → 0 as m → ∞. Arguing as in the
proof of Theorem 1 then shows that, for all k ∈ N,
lim PD(ω1 ) (τ̄ (m) > k | G(m) ) = 1.

Let Q(m) denote the number of half-edges used up to time tm in the

lim inf PD(ω1 ) (B (m) | G(m) ) ≥ P(X̂ = ∞),

which together with (6.20) establishes the assertion of the theorem.

Finally, note from the discussion at the end of Section 6.4.2 that Corollary 2 holds with G(m) replaced by Ḡ(m) , where Ḡ(m) is the event that the
epidemic E (m) infects at least log m households.

Concluding comments

We have analysed the spread of an SIR epidemic within a population structure that features some significant departures from traditional homogeneous
mixing; specifying both a local household structure and using random networks with an arbitrary degree distribution (with finite variance) to model
potential ‘global’ contacts. Rigorous limit theorems were obtained, valid as
the number of households m → ∞, from which one can determine the probability of a major outbreak and the expected relative final size of such an
outbreak. The potential usefulness of these results was verified by showing,
numerically, that these asymptotic results provide good approximations for
the behaviour of moderately sized finite populations.

40

As stated in Section 2, our results easily generalise to allow for unequal
household sizes. For example,
decompose R∗ in a variable household
P∞ we can
(n)
size framework as R∗ = n=1 ρ̃n R∗ , where ρ̃n is the size-biased proportion
(n)
of households of size n and R∗ is the threshold parameter R∗ in the case of
a fixed household size n. (The size-bias of ρ̃n arises because if a proportion
ρn of households are of size n then an individual chosen uniformly at random is in aP
household of size n with probability proportional to nρn ; thus
we require ∞
n=1 nρn < ∞.) Full details of this generalisation will appear
in a forthcoming paper, which will discuss our model from a more applied
viewpoint.
2
Another condition that we have required is that the variance, σD
, of the
degree distribution is finite. Whilst this is necessary for all of our proofs,
the PGFs of C, C̃, B and B̃ are all well-defined so long as µD < ∞ and numerical studies (along the lines of those encompassed by Figure 3) indicate
2
that our methods at least give good approximations when σD
= ∞. This is
particularly relevant in light of several of the studies cited by Newman (2003,
Section III.C), which suggest that degree distributions which asymptotically
follow some power law are appropriate models in some real-world situations.
2
= ∞ it is not known (to our knowledge)
We note, however, that when σD
whether self-loops and parallel edges remain sufficiently sparse in the network, so the argument that our results continue to hold if we condition on
there being no such imperfections (second paragraph of Section 2) may not
be valid.
Of course there are other features of our model that in many circumstances will be unrealistic. In particular, the method of construction of
the random graph—pairing the half-edges uniformly at random—ensures
not only that there are (asymptotically) very few 1-cycles (self-loops) and
2-cycles (parallel edges) in the resulting multigraph, but also that there are
very few 3-cycles (triangles). Thus, in the asymptotic model that we analyse,
individuals have no mutual acquaintances outside their household, which is
unrealistic. Similarly the random graph model has very few edges which
join individuals in the same pair of households, i.e. the acquaintances of two
individuals are, with probability close to 1, all in distinct households. That
this is the case stems from the construction of the random graph: although
there is heterogeneity amongst the individuals (through differing degrees),
the uniformly at random pairing of half-edges means that the mixing is still
homogeneous—this being critical for the branching process approximations.
In this sense it seems fair to say that our model incorporates some heterogeneity of both the individuals in the population (via the differing degrees of
individuals and varying household sizes) and their mixing (having both local

41

and global infection).
Nevertheless, our model does capture some important heterogeneities
which are present in real populations and which doubtless have a significant
effect on the spread of disease through these populations. Some additional
features, such as having the degree distribution D or the infection rates λL
and λG depend on household size or incorporating correlation between the
degrees of individuals within the same household can in principle be included
in our model relatively simply, though the calculations quickly become very
cumbersome.
The usual approach for obtaining fully rigorous results concerning the
final size of a major epidemic on a random network is via the existence and
uniqueness of a giant component in an associated bond percolation model
(see e.g. Britton et al. (2007) and the discussion in Section 4 of Britton et
al. (2008)). This requires that the infectious period is constant (though see
Kenah and Robins (2007)) and fully rigorous results concerning the component structure of the percolation model, which may not be easy to prove.
We have developed a different approach, which does not require a constant
infectious period. Although not the focus of the paper, it seems plausible
that our methods can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of a giant
component for our random network (and indeed for other network models)
and that they might also be applicable to epidemics on other random graph
models, such as the random intersection graph considered by Britton et al.
(2008).
Further study of this model will include an analysis of the effect of vaccination on epidemic spread (work ongoing) and it seems likely that a central
limit theorem for the final size of a major outbreak might be derived using
methods similar to those of Ball and Neal (2008).
