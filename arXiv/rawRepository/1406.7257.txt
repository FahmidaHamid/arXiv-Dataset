Abstract
We propose an analytical approach to solving the
diffusion-convection equations governing oxygen transport in the human placenta. We show that only two
geometrical characteristics of a placental cross-section,
villi density and the effective villi radius, are needed to
predict fetal oxygen uptake. We also identify two combinations of physiological parameters that determine oxygen uptake in a given placenta: (i) the maximal oxygen
inflow of a placentone if there were no tissue blocking
the flow, and (ii) the ratio of transit time of maternal
blood through the intervillous space to oxygen extraction
time. We derive analytical formulas for fast and simple
calculation of oxygen uptake and provide two diagrams
of efficiency of oxygen transport in an arbitrary placental cross-section. We finally show that artificial perfusion experiments with no-hemoglobin blood tend to give
a two-orders-of-magnitude underestimation of the in vivo
oxygen uptake and that the optimal geometry for such
setup alters significantly. The theory allows one to adjust
the results of artificial placenta perfusion experiments to
account for oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation. Combined
with image analysis techniques, the presented model can
give an easy-to-use tool for prediction of the human placenta efficiency.

Introduction

The human placenta consists of maternal and fetal
parts (Fig. 1a). The maternal part is a blood basin
which is supplied by spiral arteries and drained by maternal veins (Benirschke et al., 2006). The fetal part is
a villous tree, inside which fetal blood goes from umbilical arteries to the umbilical vein through fetal capillaries. Maternal blood percolates through the same arboreous structure on the outside. Maternal blood and fetal
blood do not mix, so the gas and nutrient exchange takes
place at the surface of the villous tree, sections of which
can be observed in a typical histological 2D placental
slide (Fig. 1b). Modeling and understanding the relation
between the geometrical structure of the exchange surface of the villous tree and the efficiency of the transport
function of the placenta constitutes the central object of
our study.
Placenta models have been proposed previously (see
discussions in Aifantis, 1978, Battaglia and Meschia,
1986, Chernyavsky et al., 2010, Gill et al., 2011). 1D
models dealt with oxygen transport at the scale of either one single villus or the whole placenta, in both
cases imposing a flat exchange surface between maternal and fetal blood (Bartels et al., 1962, Shapiro et al.,
1967, Kirschbaum and Shapiro, 1969, Hill et al., 1972,
1973, Longo et al., 1972a,b, Power et al., 1972a,b, Lardner, 1975, Wilbur et al., 1978, Groome, 1991); some 2D
models were used to study the co-orientation of maternal and fetal flows (Bartels et al., 1962, Metcalfe et al.,
1964, Shapiro et al., 1967, Faber, 1969, Kirschbaum
and Shapiro, 1969, Guilbeau et al., 1970, Moll, 1972,
Schröder, 1982, Battaglia and Meschia, 1986); other models represented the placenta as a porous medium (Erian
et al., 1977, Schröder, 1982, Chernyavsky et al., 2010).
A lumped element model was also proposed to calculate 1D placental diffusing capacity and to relate morphometric data to the efficiency of gas transport (see Mayhew et al., 1984, 1986 and references therein). To our

knowledge, the only 3D placenta model was introduced
by Chernyavsky et al. (2010) to study how the position
of venous outlets and the existence of a central cavity
influences oxygen transport in a hemispherical porousmedium placentone model.
However, none of these models uses fine geometrical structure of experimentally obtained placental
slides (Fig. 1b) as direct input. In a recent paper
we introduced a stream-tube placenta model (STPM;
Fig. 2b), which is built upon histological placental crosssections (Serov et al., 2015a) in contrast to previous placenta models. In this model, cross-sections of stream
tubes of maternal blood flow (MBF) in the intervillous
space of the human placenta were reconstructed from
placental cross-sections (Fig. 1b) and virtually extended
along the third dimension. Although successive crosssections of a stream tube obviously vary in the placenta,
this variation cannot be reproduced from a single crosssection and was ignored in this model. Relevant physiological and geometrical parameters of the model were
estimated from available experimental data. Numerical
simulations of oxygen transport for identical circular villi
were then performed and showed that the model exhibits
an optimal villi density yielding maximal oxygen uptake.
Deviations from these optimal characteristics with variations of model parameters were estimated. The obtained optimal villi density (0.47 ± 0.06) corresponds to
that experimentally obtained in healthy human placentas (0.46 ± 0.06).
The present manuscript relies on the same STPM, but
provides the first approximate analytical theory of oxygen uptake in the human placenta based on histological
cross-sections. The present work significantly develops
the results of the previous study by:

• demonstrating explicit dependence of oxygen uptake
on model parameters and their interrelation, which
could not be obtained numerically;
• introducing two uptake efficiency indicators for
which analytical formulas and diagrams are provided;
• showing that accounting for oxygen–hemoglobin reaction is important for interpretation of artificial
perfusion experiments (with no-Hb blood) and providing a method of recalculation of the results of
such experiments to account for oxygen–hemoglobin
reaction.
In the following, the construction of the analytical theory is preceded by a full description of the geometrical
model, physical assumptions and parameters describing
the human placenta.

2.1

The model
Model assumptions

Maternal blood arrives into the intervillous space of the
human placenta by spiral arteries (Fig.2a). It then percolates through the branching structure of a tree of fetal
villi and leaves the intervillous space by decidual veins.
The total pattern of the MBF can be virtually subdivided
into small regions (stream tubes), each following the flow
and extending from the central cavity to a decidual vein.

Figure 2. (a) Scheme of placental blood flow and location of stream tubes in the placenta. The dashed line schematically
outlines the central cavity. Curved arrows in the right part show maternal blood losing oxygen while going from the central
cavity to decidual veins percolating through the villous tree (shaded region). Curved lines on the left schematically show stream
tubes of blood flow. Our model corresponds to one such stream tube unfolded; small straight arrows show the entrance points
of the model. The exchange is not modeled in the central cavity, but only after it, in the MBF pathway. The concept that
spiral arteries open into the IVS near the central cavity corresponds to current physiological views (Benirschke et al., 2006,
Chernyavsky et al., 2010). (b) Our geometrical model of one unfolded stream tube of maternal blood in a human placentone.
The cross-section of the stream tube as well as that of the fetal villi inside can be either determined from 2D histological slides
or chosen arbitrary. Red arrows show the flow of maternal blood

5. In a cross-section perpendicular to the MBF, oxygen
is only redistributed by diffusion.

Each stream tube comes into contact with numerous fetal villi, at the surface of which mass exchange between
maternal and fetal blood takes place.
We model one such stream tube unfolded as a cylinder
of an arbitrary cross-section containing multiple parallel
cylinders of arbitrary cross-sections and sizes, which represent fetal villi (Fig. 2b). The shapes and locations of
the villi can be taken from a histological slide. Since we
aim to base the STPM on histological slides (Fig. 1b)
which provide only one stream-tube section without
any information about the change of this section along
the MBF, we further postulate that the same shapes and
locations of villi are conserved along the stream tube.
This is obviously an oversimplification of the irregular 3D
structure of the placenta, but it is the most straightforward assumption given the lack of complete 3D geometrical data spatially resolving all villi.
The model relies on several other assumptions:

6. Erythrocytes are uniformly distributed in the maternal blood.
7. Oxygen bound to hemoglobin does not diffuse; only
oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma does.
8. Oxygen uptake is stationary.
The validity of these assumptions is thoroughly discussed
in Serov et al. (2015a). The model also includes geometrical and biological parameters, which are listed in Table 1.
It will further be shown that fetal oxygen uptake is determined by two parameter combinations which naturally
appear in the development of the theory.

Mathematical formulation

1. Fetal blood is considered as a perfect oxygen sink.

3.1

2. MBF is considered to be laminar with slip conditions
at all boundaries (no liquid-wall friction), so that the
velocity profile in any cross-section is flat.

We identify three different physical transport processes
in the placenta, each of which operates on a characteristic time scale: hydrodynamic blood flow through
the IVS characterized by an average velocity u and
transit time τtr ; diffusion of oxygen with characteristic time τD ; and equilibration between oxygen bound to
hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma
with characteristic time τp . This last thermodynamic
equilibrium is described as equal partial pressure of oxygen in both states. The three times can be estimated as
follows:

3. The oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve is linearized in the physiological range of partial pressure
of oxygen (0–60 mmHg) observed in the human placenta.
4. Oxygen uptake occurs at the feto-maternal interface,
i.e. at the boundaries of the small cylinders, and is
directly proportional to the interface permeability
and to oxygen concentration on the maternal side of
the interface.

Time scales of the system

• τtr , the transit time of blood through the IVS, is
of the order of 27 s from the results of angiographic

where ρbl ≈ 1000 kg/m3 is the density of blood and the
coefficient khn can be estimated from the fact that a concentration cpl ≈ 0.13 mol/m3 of the dissolved oxygen corresponds to oxygen content of 3 ml O2 /l blood or partial
pressure of 13 kPa at normal conditions (Law and Bukwirwa, 1999), yielding khn ∼ 7.5 · 105 mmHg · kg/mol for

• τD , reflecting oxygen diffusion over a length δ in
the IVS is τD ∼ δ 2 /D, where D is oxygen diffusivity in the blood plasma (Table 1). Either from
calculations (Mayhew and Jairam, 2000), or directly
from normal placental sections (Fig. 1b), the mean
width of an IVS pore can be estimated as δ ∼ 80 µm,
yielding τD ∼ 4 s.

Hemoglobin-bound oxygen. The partial pressure of
the hemoglobin-bound oxygen depends on its concentration through Hill equation:

• τp , an equilibration time scale, which includes
characteristic diffusion time for oxygen to reach
Hb molecules inside a red blood cell (∼ 10 ms, see
Foucquier et al., 2013) and typical time of oxygen–
hemoglobin dissociation (∼ 20 ms for the slowest
process, see Yamaguchi et al., 1985). Together these
times sum up to τp ∼ 30 ms.

(2)

These three characteristic times are related as follows: τp  τD . τtr . This relation suggests that oxygenhemoglobin dissociation can be considered instantaneous
as compared to diffusion and convection; the latter two,
by contrast, should be treated simultaneously.

where cmax is the oxygen content of maternal blood at
full saturation; khl ≈ 0.04 mmHg−1 and α ≈ 2.65 are coefficients of Hill equation, obtained by fitting the experimental curve of Severinghaus (1979, see Fig. 3).

Equilibrium between bound and dissolved oxygen

Diffusive-convective transport of oxygen is governed by
the mass conservation law for the total concentration of
oxygen in a volume of blood:

The very fast oxygen–hemoglobin reaction can be accounted for by assuming that the concentration of oxygen
dissolved in the blood plasma (cpl ) and that of oxygen
bound to hemoglobin (cbnd ) instantaneously mirror each
other’s changes. Mathematically both concentrations can
be related by equating oxygen partial pressures in these
two forms.

We further suppose that this partial pressure is the maximal value in the IVS and hence delimits the range of the
needed linear approximation. Fitting the experimental
curve of Severinghaus (1979) in the region 0–60 mmHg

Boundary conditions

Boundary conditions should be imposed on Eq. (8):
• the boundary of the large cylinder represents the
outer boundary of a stream tube. Assuming there
is no exchange of oxygen between different stream
tubes, we consider zero flux on its wall:
∂cpl
= 0,

This equation is non-linear as cpl appears also in the argument of the derivative of Hill saturation function S 0 .
In a first approximation, S can be linearized by assuming S 0 to be constant in the range of partial pressures of
oxygen encountered in the human placenta.

Finally the partial differential equation (6) becomes

S 0 (pO2 ) = β60 ≈ 0.017 mmHg−1 ,

where ∂/∂n is the normal derivative directed outside
the IVS;
• uptake at the effective feto-maternal interface is proportional to the concentration of oxygen dissolved in
the maternal blood plasma:

Linearization of Hill equation

The idea of linearization is simple: to replace the sigmoid
saturation function (2) with a linear function of pO2 . Although it is natural to make the line pass through the
origin, the slope of the line may be chosen differently depending on the range of partial pressures in which we
approximate the curve (Fig. 3). Data found in the literature indicate that maternal blood in the IVS of the human placenta has pO2 of about 60 mmHg (Rodesch et al.,

where the definition of {aj } has been used. This is an
exact expression for oxygen uptake, into which the geometrical structure of the placental cross-section enters
through the spectral characteristics {µj } and {aj }. Our
goal now is to simplify this expression and to identify the
most relevant geometrical and physiological parameters
that determine oxygen uptake.

To solve Eq. (8), we separate the coordinate z along the

A quick analysis of Eq. (15) shows that F (L) is a smooth
monotonous curve which is linear at small lengths and exponentially saturates at large lengths. In a first approximation, Eq. (15) can then be replaced by an expression
which has the same behavior at these limits:

Note that the flow in Eq. (17) includes two contributions: convective flow (the first term) and diffusive flow

second term is much smaller than the first one, so that
Eq. (17) can be simplified by omitting the diffusive term:

Eigenvalues {µj }, eigenfunctions {vj (x, y)} and

Approximate analytical solution

General expression for oxygen uptake
F∞ ≈ A = c0 uBSIVS .

According to the mass conservation law, oxygen uptake
up to length L is equal to the difference between oxygen
flow coming into the system at z = 0 and oxygen flow
leaving the system at z = L. Using Eqs (7) and (9) one
can derive an explicit dependence of oxygen uptake on
the stream-tube length:

This approximation is justified by the following arguments:
1. Relative roles of convection and diffusion in a hydrodynamic problem are described by the Péclet
number, which is the ratio of characteristic times of
diffusive and convective transport to the same distance δ: Pe = uδ/D. Large Péclet numbers (Pe  1)
indicate predominant convective transport, whilst
small values signify prevalence of the diffusive transport.

of the stream tube is L0 ∼ 1.6 cm  10 µm, we
conclude that diffusion along the stream tube can
be omitted as compared to convection. At the same
time, diffusion in the cross-section cannot be ignored
as it is the only in-plane mechanism of oxygen transport.

the IVS.
In the first approximation, the coefficient wP/(DSIVS )
in Eq. (22) describes the dependence of Λj on the crosssectional geometry. Introducing qj and the dimensionless

Mathematically, the simplification we have used can be
written as
µj  uB/D,

so that Eq. (14) becomes µj ≈ Λj D/(uB). It should be
noted that statement (19) does not contradict with the
fact that {µj } grow to infinity with eigenvalue number j.
In fact, each µj contributes to the final expression with
a weight aj , which diminishes with j. Eq. (19) should
be then understood as only valid for all eigenvalues that
have significant contributions aj .

can be determined from Fig. 4b. For the average streamtube length (L0 = 1.6 cm, Table 1), κ ≈ 0.35. Using
Eqs (18) and (23), the approximate oxygen uptake (16)

In this formula, α depends explicitly on L and implicitly
on the cross-sectional geometry. Our goal now is to extract the main part of this implicit dependence. For this
purpose, we integrate Eq. (10) over the IVS in the crosssection (SIVS ). We further apply the divergence theorem (Arfken et al., 2005) to transform the integral over
the IVS to an integral over its boundary (Ptot , which includes the perimeter P of the absorbing boundary of the
villi and that of the outer boundary of the stream tube

Dimensionless geometrical parameters

In Eq. (24), both geometrical parameters P and SIVS
depend on the size of the analyzed region. To facilitate physical analysis of the approximate solution and
its comparison to experimental data, we identify two geometrical characteristics of a placental cross-section that
are independent of the size of the region:

Figure 4. Dependence of κ(L) on the stream-tube cross-sectional geometry for circular villi in a circular stream tube (Fig. 8).
(a): Dependence of κ(L) on villi density φ ≡ Svil /Stot in a large range of stream-tube lengths. Here Svil is the area of the crosssection occupied by fetal villi, Stot is the total area of a cross-section, and L0 is the average stream-tube length (see Table 1).
One can see that in the first approximation, κ(L) may be assumed independent of villi configuration. (b): Dependence of κ(L)
averaged over φ on the stream-tube length L. Dashed vertical line denotes the average stream-tube length L0

• The fraction of the cross-section occupied by fetal
villi, which we define as the ratio of the total area of
villi in a cross-section to the total area of the crosssection: φ ≡ Svil /Stot .

• for any fixed value of γ, there exists some intermediate value of φ: 0 < φopt (γ) < 1 that maximizes
oxygen uptake. This optimal value φopt (γ) tends to
diminish with γ.

• The effective villi radius, which we define as re ≡
2Svil /P ≡ 2φSIVS /(P (1 − φ)). In morphometric
studies, the inverse parameter 2/re = P/Svil is
known as “villi surface density”. For circular villi
of radius r, re ≡ r. The mean value of re for the
human placenta can be found in Table 1.

Note that from the definition (26) it follows that in terms
of cross-sectional geometrical parameters, an increase
of γ corresponds to a decrease of the effective radius re .
Figure 5a can then be interpreted in the following way:
it is more efficient to have many small villi than fewer
big villi occupying the same area. This prediction can be
understood if one considers the fact that small villi have
more absorbing surface per unit of cross-sectional area.
However, in the human placenta, re cannot be infinitely
small (and hence γ infinitely large). Indeed, villi possess
an internal structure (e.g., fetal blood vessels) to transport the absorbed oxygen to the fetus. The decrease of re
below some value is likely making the villi less efficient
in transporting the already absorbed oxygen. This argument is supported by an experimental observation that
in the terminal and mature intermediate villi of the human placenta (the smallest villi), blood vessels normally
occupy the main part of the internal volume. The mean
radius of these smallest villi is r ≈ 25–30 µm (see Table 28.7 in Benirschke et al., 2006) and is not reported
to significantly vary within the same placenta or between
different placentas (Benirschke et al., 2006). At the same
time, villi density may exhibit significant spatial fluctuations within the same placenta as well as between different placentas (Bacon et al., 1986).
It is then reasonable to reformulate the initial question of optimization of the cross-sectional geometry as
which villi density provides the highest oxygen uptake
for a given effective villi radius re . Mathematically, it is
the question of finding the maximum of F against φ for
a fixed γ(re ).

Substitution of these definitions into Eq. (24) gives

The physical meaning of F0 follows from its definition: it
is the maximal oxygen flow entering a stream tube that
would be achieved if no villi obstructed the IVS of the
stream-tube. The incoming flow in the presence of villi
is F∞ ≡ F0 (1 − φ). Note that γ includes information on
the average villus shape through the parameter re , and
that F0 is independent of the cross-sectional geometry.
Normalized oxygen uptake ζ(γ, φ) ≡ F ap /F0 (which we
will call oxygen extraction efficiency) is plotted in Fig. 5a.
The physical meaning of γ is discussed later.

Optimal cross-sectional geometry

Looking at Fig. 5a and expression (25) for oxygen uptake,
it is natural to ask what are the “optimal” values of the
parameters φ and γ that maximize oxygen uptake at a
given stream-tube length. Figure 5a clearly shows two
trends:

4.6

Optimal villi density

Under the constraint of fixed γ, Eq. (25) implies the existence of maximal uptake at a certain villi density. The
reasoning is the following:

• for any fixed value of φ, larger γ provides larger uptake;

• F > 0 for 0 < φ < 1, which corresponds to the fact
that the placenta transfers oxygen from mother to
fetus for intermediate villi densities. Hence, there
always exists a maximal oxygen uptake Fmax (L) at
a certain villi density 0 < φopt (L) < 1 for any γ(re ).

indicates the fraction of the maximal possible incoming
oxygen flow F0 that is absorbed by a given cross-sectional
geometry. The higher is the value of ζ, the higher is the
absolute value of fetal oxygen uptake. At the same time,
villi density efficiency η (Fig. 5b) shows how far the villi
density of a given cross-section is from its optimal value
for a fixed γ(re ). The higher is the value of η, the closer
is fetal oxygen uptake to the maximal value for the given
villi radius re .

Villi density efficiency

Basing on the optimal villi density and the maximal uptake introduced in the previous section, one can define
a quantitative measure of optimality of villi density in a
given (not optimal) geometry.
If the given geometry is characterized by the parameters (γ, φ), its villi density efficiency can be defined as
the ratio of oxygen uptake in this particular geometry
to the maximal value, which can be obtained with the
same γ (Fig. 6b):
η(γ, φ) ≡

Figure 7 shows that fetal oxygen uptake predicted by
the analytical Eq. (25) agrees well with numerically calculated results (Serov et al., 2015a) in wide ranges of
stream-tube lengths (L) and villi densities (φ). Figure 7a demonstrates the existence of maximal oxygen
uptake corresponding to an optimal villi density for each
stream-tube length. The value of κ(L) was determined
from Fig. 4b for each considered length L. These results
were calculated for the same geometries as in our earlier
numerical simulation (Fig. 8). We emphasize that numerical simulations with identical circular villi are shown
only for the purpose of validation. The proposed analytical theory, which uses only villi density and the effective
villi radius (re ) as geometrical information, is applicable
to villi of arbitrary shapes and sizes. The agreement of
analytical curves with numerical points shows that for
uniform villi distributions, knowing villi density and the
effective villi radius is enough to predict the oxygen uptake.
Variations of the parameter γ in analytical expressions for optimal villi density and maximal uptake (Eqs (28), (29)) can be interpreted in terms of
changes of individual parameters of the model, other parameters being fixed. For example, optimal villi density
and maximal uptake can be plotted as functions of MBF
velocity (Figs 9a, 9c) or stream-tube length (Figs 9b

Figure 7. Oxygen uptake of a single placentone as a function of geometrical parameters. Solid lines correspond to the
analytical approximation; symbols reproduce the results of numerical simulations of Serov et al. (2015a). (a) Oxygen uptake
as a function of villi density φ for three lengths L: L0 /3, 2L0 /3, and L0 . For each of these lengths, the corresponding value
of κ was determined from Fig. 4b: κ ≈ {0.46, 0.39, 0.35} for L = {L0 /3, 2L0 /3, L0 } respectively. MBF velocity u = 0.6 mm/s
was used. It can be observed that peak uptake moves to smaller villi densities for larger stream-tube lengths L. Note that in
the analytical theory oxygen uptake is calculated directly for the radius R, whereas in the numerical simulation oxygen uptake
2
is calculated for Rnum and then rescaled to the placentone radius R by multiplying by R2 /Rnum
. Note also that the numerical
curves do not go beyond the villi density φ ≈ 0.75 because there exists a maximal packing density of circles in a large circle, and
numerical results cannot be calculated beyond that density (see Specht, 2009). The analytical theory, on the contrary, does not
rely on particular shapes or distributions of villi, but operates only with villi density and the effective villi radius, thus allowing
the results to be calculated for villi densities beyond this limit (although in the region of φ > 0.75 villi cannot be circular, the
same re is maintained). (b) Oxygen uptake as a function of stream-tube length L for a fixed villi density φ. Small deviations
of the theory from the numerical results seen in the figure are explained by the fixed κ = κ(L0 ) ≈ 0.35 used for all lengths.
Various symbols represent villi densities of Fig. 8

average placenta extracts around 35 % of the maximal
possible incoming oxygen flow F0 (Fig. 5a), and that this
value is close to the maximal one for the given effective
villi radius (Fig. 5b). Although 35 % seems to be a low
value, note that oxygen extraction efficiency of 100 % is
never achievable since in the presence of villi only a part
of the flow unobstructed by villi (F0 ) can be transferred
to the fetus.
To have predictive power, γ and φ need to be measured for different healthy as well as pathological placentas over the whole exchange region. Such measurements
require development of image analysis techniques, which
could automatically determine these characteristics for
histological placental slides. Such measurements have
not yet been performed and present an important perspective to this study. At the same time, because of the
lack of experimental information about several other parameters (namely, u, w, L) in each studied placenta, correlations of changes of γ and φ with changes of fetal development characteristics (such as birth-weight, placenta
weight or their ratio) are expected to be of more practical use than absolute values of γ and φ. Note finally that
the optimal geometry and maximal uptake may change
for non-slip boundary conditions; further studies are required to clarify this point (for discussion see Serov et al.,
2015a).

and 9d). An agreement between the plotted curves and
numerical results of Serov et al. (2015a) can be observed.
All four plots in Fig. 9 feature a dashed black curve representing a fictitious case of blood having no hemoglobin
but transporting only oxygen dissolved in the blood
plasma.
Mathematically, this case is described by
oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation parameter B = 1, which
is about 100 times smaller than that for blood with Hb.
As predicted by Eq. (28), the no-Hb curves for optimal
villi density have the same shape but are shifted by two
orders of magnitude as compared to those for normal
blood.

Values

Taking πR2 as the total area of the cross-section, parameters from Table 1 and κ(L0 ) ≈ 0.35 for the average
stream-tube length L0 ≈ 1.6 cm (Fig. 4b), from Eq. (26)
one can estimate the values of γ and F0 which characterize a “healthy” regime of our placenta model: γ ≈ 1.4,
F0 ≈ 3 · 10−6 mol/s. The obtained average value of γ
together with the average villi density φ ≈ 0.46 (Serov
et al., 2015a) are marked by crosses in the diagrams in
Fig. 5. One can see that the theory predicts that an

6.1.2

Parameter γ

sary to predict oxygen uptake of a rather uniform
villi distribution in a placental cross-section (see
Figs 7, 9). These two parameters allow for a simple application of the theory to distributions of villi
of arbitrary shapes. The validity of the theory in
the case of strongly non-uniform villi distributions
remains to be investigated.

The two parameters γ and F0 play different roles. According to Eq. (27), γ alone determines the optimal villi
density, while F0 together with γ determines the maximal
oxygen uptake (Eq. (29)).
A clear physical interpretation of γ can be obtained by
rewriting (26) as

Finer details of villi distributions which produce differences between numerical and analytical results in
Figs 7 and 9, are “stored” in the coefficient κ. This
coefficient encompasses not only the details of villi
distributions, but also determines the strength of
their influence on oxygen uptake at a given length L.
In other words, it quantitatively describes the fact
that in each geometry, different regions of the IVS
are not equivalent due to random distribution of villi,
and that with length L, oxygen in some regions is
exhausted faster than in other regions. However, the
dependence of κ and α on L is rather weak as can
be seen in Fig. 7b, in which F ap (L) is plotted for all
lengths with the same κ = κ(L0 ) ≈ 0.35. In the first
approximation, κ can hence be considered independent of L.

where τtr ≡ L/u is the transit time of maternal
blood through the placenta (while it flows along a
stream tube of length L with an average velocity u)
and τe ≡ Bre /(2wκ) is oxygen extraction time of a
placental cross-section. As a consequence, γ can be
understood as a quantitative measure of balance between two oxygen transport mechanisms: the longitudinal convective flow and the transverse diffusion. In other
words, γ describes the level of adaptation of the geometry
of the cross-section and uptake parameters to the incoming MBF. Large values of γ (γ  1) mean that oxygen is
quickly transferred to the fetal circulation at the beginning of the stream-tube and is rapidly depleted, so that
poor in oxygen maternal blood flows through the remaining part. Thus, this remaining part does not function
efficiently. Small values of γ (γ  1) mean that maternal blood passes too quickly through the placenta as
compared to the oxygen extraction time, so that a considerable part of the incoming oxygen flow may not be
transferred. One can then speculate that transport of
oxygen is the most efficient in the placentas, for which γ
is of the order of 1. γ ≈ 1.4 calculated from the model
parameters suggests that a healthy placenta may indeed
function optimally.

3. The efficiency of oxygen transport in a given placental cross-section can be estimated by means of
oxygen extraction efficiency ζ and villi density efficiency η plotted in Fig. 5. For these two quantities,
simple analytical formulas and diagrams are provided, which allow for comparison of different placentas or placental regions once the parameters φ
and γ are calculated for them. To have predictive
power, the efficiency estimations provided by the
model need to be studied for correlations with independent indicators of placental exchange efficiency,
such as placenta shape, placenta weight, placentafetus birth-weight ratio (Misra et al., 2010, Hutcheon
et al., 2012) or pulsatility indices determined by
Doppler velocimetry in the umbilical cord or maternal vessels (Todros et al., 1999, Madazli et al., 2003),
which were demonstrated to vary between normal
and pre-eclamptic pregnancies or pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction.

The analytical theory

The advantages of the analytical solution over the numerical one are numerous:
1. Oxygen uptake can be estimated for a histological
cross-section of arbitrary geometry.
2. The villi density φ and the effective villi radius re are
shown to be the only geometrical parameters neces-

4. The analytical theory suggests that oxygen uptake

analytical results, while filled circles correspond to numerical simulations for circular villi (Fig. 8). Dashed curves show analytical
results in blood with no hemoglobin (B = 1, as in artificial perfusion experiments). Straight dashed lines indicate the expected
average MBF velocity u and stream-tube length L0 (Table 1). Step growth of numerical results seen in Figs (a), (b) is explained
by discrete changes of villi density in the numerical simulations due to discrete changes in the number of villi in the cross-section

in the human placenta is rather robust to changes of
villi density. Indeed, the diagram in Fig. 5a shows
that placental villi density can vary by about 10 %
around the optimal value with the villi density efficiency η staying in the 90–100 % interval. Far from
the optimal villi density, η tends to decrease faster.

for blood containing Hb: γ = γ
e/B and F0 = Fe0 B,
where B ≈ 94 (Table 1), and can be substituted into
Eq. (25) to give oxygen uptake F in the same placenta for blood containing Hb. One can see that oxygen uptake in a no-Hb perfusion experiment gives on
the average a hundred-times underestimation of the
real uptake. Finally, the values of γ and φ for the
given placenta can be compared with the diagram
in Fig. 5b to determine how far the geometry of the
region is from the optimal one. Note that this recalculation introduces a small error as in no-Hb case
the diffusive part of the total flow, which is omitted
in Eq. (17), becomes important;

5. One can analyze the consequences of neglecting
oxygen-hemoglobin reaction on the predictions of
oxygen uptake and the optimal villi density of a
placental region. Moreover, the theory gives a
method of recalculation of the results obtained for
no-Hb blood in artificial placenta perfusion experiments into those for normal blood. Imagine that
at the end of an artificial perfusion experiment
with no-Hb blood, one obtains the total oxygen inflow Fein into the placenta, fetal oxygen uptake Fe
and the average villi density φ from histomorphometry of the same placenta (note that Fein and Fe
differ from Fin and F which would have been obtained for normal blood). From these data one can
calculate Fe0 = Fein /(1 − φ) (see the discussion of
Eq. (26)) and then γ
e as a root of Eq. (25) (with F ap
e
replaced by F ). These values can be recalculated

6. The computation time is reduced since calculations
of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the diffusion
equation are not required. Note that due to long
computation time, numerical simulations of Serov
et al. (2015a) had to be performed on a smaller placentone radius Rnum and then rescaled to the ra2
dius R by multiplying oxygen uptake by R2 /Rnum
.
This constraint does not apply to the analytical theory. In particular, good agreement between both approaches justifies the rescaling of results performed

Figure 10. Illustration of the difference between the total villous perimeter and the effective absorbing villous perimeter. (a)
Example of an isolated group of villi. In the shaded villi group, some parts of absorbing villi boundaries are inefficient as they
are screened by other villi from the outside of the isolated group, where the main reservoir of oxygen is supposed to be. The
effective absorbing perimeter of the group is close to the perimeter outlined by the dashed line. This perimeter of the IVS
surrounding the villi can be several times smaller than the total perimeter of the villi in the shaded group. Note also that
adding a new villus into such group (the villus outside the shaded group) does not increase the effective absorbing perimeter
proportionally to the increase of the total villous perimeter. In the example in the figure, the new perimeter (the dotted contour)
has approximately the same length as the old one. (b) Illustration of the same concept in a histological slide of the human
placenta. Two dashed contours show the effective absorbing perimeters of two groups of villi, which are considerably smaller
than the total perimeters of villi in the groups. Discussion of similar screening concepts can be found in Sapoval et al. (2002),
Felici et al. (2005), Gill et al. (2011)

that for a rather uniform spatial distribution of villi in a
placental cross-section, only two geometrical characteristics, villi density φ and the effective villi radius re , are
needed to predict fetal oxygen uptake.
It was also demonstrated that all the parameters of the
model do not influence oxygen uptake independently, but
instead form two combinations: (i) the maximal oxygen
inflow of one placentone F0 , and (ii) the ratio γ of the
transit time of maternal blood through the IVS and the
oxygen extraction time. These two parameters together
with villi density determine oxygen uptake. Analytical
formulas and diagrams were obtained which allow for
oxygen uptake calculation and quantitative estimation
of the efficiency of oxygen transport of a given placental
region based on measurements of φ and re .
Finally, a fictitious case of blood containing no
hemoglobin was analyzed to study oxygen transport in
artificial placenta perfusion experiments. It was demonstrated that artificial perfusion experiments with no
hemoglobin tend to give a two-orders-of-magnitude underestimation of the in vivo oxygen uptake. A method
of recalculation of the results of artificial perfusion experiments to account for oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation
was proposed.
Once combined with image analysis techniques, the
proposed analytical theory can be the mathematical
ground for a future tool of fast diagnostics of placenta
efficiency based on histological placental slides.

in the numerical calculations.
Note finally that the derivation of Eq. (26) implies that,
strictly speaking, P is not the total perimeter of the villi,
but the effective absorbing perimeter of the villi (i.e. only
its part that is directly in contact with the IVS). In the
case of well-separated villi, there is no difference between
the two definitions. However, it is not always the case
in placental cross-sections. For instance, in Fig. 10b one
can see several isolated groups of villi, inside which villi
lie so close to each other, that there is virtually no IVS
left between them. Parts of the villous boundary which
are not in contact with large parts of the IVS are then
screened from participating in oxygen uptake, and hence
should not be accounted for in the effective absorbing
perimeter of the villi. This remark can be understood by
considering the fact that oxygen diffuses in the IVS, and
only parts of the villous boundary that are in contact
with the IVS will participate in the uptake. In the case
of well separated singular villi, the entire perimeter is
absorbing. A schematic description of this situation is
shown in Fig. 10a. Note finally that in our model the
screening effect is implicitly taken into account by the
diffusion equation (10).

Conclusions

In the present work, an analytical solution to the
diffusion-convection equation governing oxygen transport
in the human placenta has been developed. Oxygen uptake was calculated for an arbitrary cross-sectional geometry of the stream tubes of maternal blood. It was shown
