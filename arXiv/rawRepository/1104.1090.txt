The Narrow Escape problem in a flat cylindrical microdomain
with application to diffusion in the synaptic cleft
Jürgen Reingruber and David Holcman

∗

Abstract
The mean first passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to reach a small target in cellular
microdomains is a key parameter for chemical activation. Although asymptotic estimations of the
MFPT are available for various geometries, these formula cannot be applied to degenerated structures
where one dimension of is much smaller compared to the others. Here we study the narrow escape
time (NET) problem for a Brownian particle to reach a small target located on the surface of a
flat cylinder, where the cylinder height is comparable to the target size, and much smaller than the
cylinder radius. When the cylinder is sealed, we estimate the MFPT for a Brownian particle to hit
a small disk located centrally on the lower surface. For a laterally open cylinder, we estimate the
conditional probability and the conditional MFPT to reach the small disk before exiting through
the lateral opening. We apply our results to diffusion in the narrow synaptic cleft, and compute
the fraction and the mean time for neurotransmitters to find their specific receptors located on the
postsynaptic terminal. Finally, we confirm our formulas with Brownian simulations.

Introduction

The problem of computing the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to reach a small
target located on a surface of a microdomain, also referred to as the Narrow Escape Time (NET) [36, 14],
is ubiquitous in biophysics and cellular biology because it corresponds to determining the forward binding
rate of chemical reactions [39, 2, 38, 10]. Applications of the NET ranges from quantitative analysis for
the resident time of receptors in the postsynaptic density [14, 27, 35, 12], a fundamental microdomain
associated to synaptic transmission and plasticity [8], to scaling laws in physics [7], early steps of viral
infection [11, 19, 18], or the hydrolysis rate of activated phosphodiesterase in rod photoreceptors [23, 24].
Recent analytical approaches lead to asymptotic formula for the NET in a confined geometry [36, 37,
30, 29]. For example, in a three dimensional domain of volume V with isoperimetric ratio of order 1, and
with no bottlenecks, the overall NET to an absorbing circular hole of (dimensionless) radius a centered
at xs on the surface is [30]

where D is the diffusion constant, L(xs ) and N (xs ) are the principal curvatures at xs . In the case of
a sphere, a precise asymptotic expression with the first three terms was recently obtained in [6], where
the O(1) term depends on the regular part of the Green’s function. The NET computations were further
generalized to the case of several holes [15, 21, 6], and to stochastic dynamics with a potential well [28, 35].
However, the NET formula (1) cannot be directly applied to degenerated microdomains where one
dimension is much smaller than the others. This is for example the case for the synaptic cleft separating
pre- and post-synaptic neuronal terminals (Fig. 1a), which can be approximated as a flat cylinder with
height much smaller compared to its width [3]. Furthermore, in retinal rod photoreceptors sustaining

night vision, the outer segment contains thousands of piled flat cylinders that define the photoresponse
and the fidelity of the vision under dim light conditions [25, 13, 23].
The goal of this paper is to extend the NET analysis to degenerate domains. More specifically, we
study the NET of a Brownian particle in a flat cylinder, where the cylinder height h is much smaller
compared to the cylinder radius R (h ≪ R), with a small circular hole of radius a centered on the bottom
cylinder surface (Fig. 1b). In the first part, we will analyze the NET to exit the cylindrical domain when
the boundary is reflecting everywhere except at the small hole, where it is absorbing. Due to the radial
symmetry, the solution of the the mixed boundary value problem can be expanded in terms of Bessel
functions. For a flat cylinder with h ≪ R and R ≫ a, we find that the NET is given by

where the function a0 ha / 2 ∈ [0.07, 0.25] is depicted in Fig. 2a. Although we derive (2) for h ≪ R, we
expect that it remains a valid approximation until h ∼ R, in which case a0 ( ha ) ∼ 41 and the leading order
terms in (2) and (1) coincide. We note that the log-contribution in (1) comes from the local property of
the boundary at the hole, whereas in (2) it originates from the degenerated geometry.
In the second part of the paper, we study a cylinder that is open at lateral boundary, and we present
asymptotic estimates for the conditional probability p and the conditional mean time τc that a Brownian
particle reaches the small hole before leaving the domain through the lateral boundary. For example,
for a flat cylinder with h ∼ a and R ≫ a, when the particle starts at the upper boundary at position
(r = 0, z = h) opposite to the small hole, the conditional probability p(0, h) and the conditional mean
time τc (0, h) are ((40), (52) and (67))

where α = R/a ≫ 1, β = h/a ∼ 1 and τ (0, h) is the mean time to reach the small hole when the
cylinder is closed. These asymptotic expressions can be applied to study diffusion in the synaptic cleft,
where synaptic transmission depends on neurotransmitters that are released at the presynaptic terminal
from vesicles and activate receptors located on the opposite post-synaptic neuron (Fig. 1). The transmission efficiency depends crucially on the conditional probability for a diffusing neurotransmitter to hit
a functional receptor before leaving the synaptic cleft.

Mean time to find a small target in a bounded cylindrical
compartment

We shall now present our analysis to estimate the MFPT τ (x) for a Brownian molecule, initially located
at position x = (x1 , x2 , z), to escape a cylinder of radius R and height h (Fig.1) through a small circular
hole of radius a located centrally on the lower surface at z = 0. The cylindrical surface is reflecting,
except for the small
p hole where it is absorbing. Due to the radial symmetry, the MFPT is a function of
the radius r = x21 + x22 and the height z. Using the small hole radius a, we define the dimensionless
parameters and variables

Our goal is to obtain a solution for (5) and to clarify its dependency on the parameters α and β. To
study the shape of the boundary layer, we note that (5) corresponds to a heat equation where the total
amount of heat produced in Ω is one, independent of α and β. Furthermore, because the scaled radius
of the hole through which the heat dissipates is one, it follows that τ̂ (x, y) has a finite asymptotic limit
in the neighborhood of the hole for α → ∞ and β → ∞.

The time τ̂i is the average MFPT for particles starting uniformly distributed in the inner cylinder Ωi ,
and τ̂o is the average MFPT for particles starting uniformly distributed in the annulus Ωo . We shall now
derive asymptotic limits for τ̂i and τ̂o under various conditions.

2.3

Asymptotic expressions for a cylinder with R ≫ a, and a flat cylinder
with R ≫ a and h ≪ R

We will first derive asymptotic expressions for τ̂ for a cylinder with R ≫ a (α ≫ 1) and arbitrary height
h, and we will then focus on a flat cylinder with h ≪ R (β ≪ α). We show that a0 (α, β) is the leading
order contribution to τ̂ for α ≫ 1. For a flat cylinder with α ≫ 1 and β/α ≪ 1, we further have that
a0 (α, β) ≈ a0 (β). To derive a0 (β) as a function of β, we consider the limit α → ∞ while β stays bounded
(R → ∞ with finite h). We show that τ̂ (x, y) and τ̂ have finite asymptotic limits for α → ∞ that depend
only on β.
We start by considering the limit α ≫ 1. The function wi (x, y) in (18) is of the order |Ω|−1 ∼ α−2
and can be neglected, and we have
τ̂i (x, y) ≈

(31)

Because the average time τ̂i starting uniformly distributed in Ωi is similar to the the average time

Equations (33)-(34) show that a0 (α, β) is the leading term that determines the average MFPT for α ≫ 1.
To further evaluate τ , we shall now estimate a0 (α, β) for a flat cylinder with a small hole, when β ≪ α
and α ≫ 1, by considering the limit α → ∞ while β remains finite (R → ∞ with fixed h). For α → ∞,
the scaled times τ̂ (x, y) and τ̂ have have finite limits that depend on β, and only the dimensional times
τ (r, z) and τ diverge ∼ R2 . In this limit, the coefficients αn , βn and γn in (24) and (25) are given by

2.3.1

Behavior of a0 (β) as a function of β

To evaluate a0 (β) as a function of β, we solve numerically (36) by truncating
the series at sufficiently high
√
values n: in Fig. 2(a) we plot the analytic approach result for a0 (β)/ 2 and confirm that it agrees well
with results from Brownian simulations that were performed with α = 50. Interestingly, Fig. 2a shows
that the simulation result for β = 40 (when β is comparable to α = 50) still agrees very well with the
8

analytic result derived with the assumption α ≫ β, suggesting that a0 (β) remains a good approximation
until values β ∼ α (h ∼ R). As a consequence, √
this suggests that (38) is an acceptable approximation
for τ until values h ∼ R. Fig. 2a shows that a0 / 2 approaches the value 14 for large β, thus, from (34)
|V |
we recover the narrow escape formula τ ≈ 4aD
[36, 10, 31] derived for a volume with isoperimetric ratio
|V |
of order 1. Conversely, (32) shows that the validity of the narrow escape formula 4aD
is not limited to
the range where h ∼ R, but it is already a valid approximation when ln α ≪ β and β & 40 (Fig. 2a).
|V |
Hence, we conclude that τ = 4aD
is a good approximation even for an oblate volume with R ≫ h (and
√
h ≫ a). In the√opposite limit β → 0, we find that a0 (β)/ 2 does not converge towards zero (Fig. 2a), but
for a0 (β) for β → 0). In
limβ→0 a0 (β)/ 2 ≈ 0.071 (in appendix A we derive an analytical approximation
√
Fig. 2b we show the effect of the truncation level n on the value of a0 (β)/ 2: after n ∼ 100 the steady
state regime is achieved. Finally, in Fig. 2c-d, we compare the values of the coefficients a0 (β) and b0 (β),
where b0 (β) is obtained using (22). The graphs show that b0 (β) ≈ a0 (β) is a good approximation, and
we will use this in section 2.3.3.

Boundary layer analysis: particles starting near the absorbing hole

In the neighborhood of the small absorbing window (for x ∼ 1 and y ∼ 1), there is a boundary layer (BL)
where the behavior of τ̂ (x, y) is very different compared to large x and y. In Fig. 3 we study numerically
the shape of the BL using (37). The different panels depict τ̂ (x, y) in the neighborhood of the absorbing
window for various β. The plots show that a boundary layer starts to evolve around β ∼ 0.3, and the
evolution is almost finished for β ∼ 10 (there is no significant difference between the plots for β = 10 and
β = 50). Furthermore, the approximate extent of the boundary layer for large β is ∆x ∼ ∆y ∼ 10.
In Fig. 4a, we show τ̂ (x, β) for particles released on the upper surface at y = β as a function of
x and for various β. Such a situation is relevant at synapses where neurotransmitters are released at
the presynaptic terminal, located opposite to the surface with the postsynaptic density (PSD) where
receptors are clustered [20, 4]. The hole radius a would correspond to the radius of the PSD. Fig. 4(a)
shows that when the height of the synaptic cleft is comparable to the radius of the PSD (β ∼ 1), τ̂ (x, β)
changes considerably as a function of the radial release position x. In contrast, for β ≫ 1 the release site
is outside the boundary layer and the NET is almost independent of x and is well approximated by 1/4.

To evaluate the error induced by the truncation, we first compute the coefficients an and bn with high
precision (using a truncation level n ∼ 200), and then use these values in (39). In Fig. 5, we show the
effect of the truncations for various n and β: interestingly, the numerical analysis reveals that for β . 1,
truncating at n = 0 or n = 1 already provides a very good approximation. The accuracy of the truncation
depends on β, and n has to be increased for larger β in order to maintain a similar accuracy (Fig. 5c).
In Fig. 4a-c, we plot the effect of the truncation as a function of x for y = β (particles are released at the
upper surface), and in Fig. 4d-f, the starting position y is reduced to y = 0.7β, y = 0.4β and y = 0.1β.
Due to the truncation, at the patching boundary x = 1, (39) has a small discontinuity ∆(n) (y) =
(n) +
τ̂ (1 , y) − τ̂ (n) (1− , y). For example, for n = 0 and y = β (see Fig. 5a-c) we obtain ∆(0) (β) =
a0 (β)
√
− b0 (β) ≈ a0 (β)(1 − √22 ), where we used a0 (β) ≈ b0 (β) (see Fig. 2c-d).

Finally, for β . 1, when a Brownian particle is released at the center of the upper surface (x = 0, y =
β), using the truncation n = 0, we obtain from (39)

as a function of β by comparing it with τ̂ (0, β), computed with high accuracy (n ∼ 200). We find that
this approximation is valid until β ∼ 1.
2.3.4

Analogy with the electrified disk problem

For β ≫ 1 and α ≫ 1, an asymptotic solution for τ̂ (x, y) can be obtained by considering the analogy with
the electrified disk problem: the total outflux −1 through the hole leads to the electrified disk problem
with a disk charge Q = −1, and using the capacitance C = 4 of the unit disk [33, 32], we find that
the disk potential is Q/C = −1/4. Using the solution U (x, y) of the electrified disk problem with disk
potential −1/4 [33], we obtain the asymptotic correspondence
τ̂ (x, y) = U (x, y) +

Conditional probability to reach the small target before leaving a laterally open cylinder

When the cylinder is open at the lateral boundary, we shall now compute the conditional probability
p(x, y) that a Brownian particle, initially at position (x, y), reaches the small target disk before leaving
the cylinder through the lateral opening. Because the geometry of the synaptic cleft can be approximated
by a laterally open cylinder [1, 22, 34], we will use our computations to estimate the efficiency of receptor
activation at a synapse. Indeed, at the presynaptic site, vesicles release neurotransmitters into the
synaptic cleft, and the diffusing neurotransmitter either bind to and thereby activate receptors located
on postsynaptic terminal, or they leave the synaptic cleft without activating a receptor. We will first
derive a general expression for the conditional probability p(x, y) to hit the small target before exiting,
and then compute average values for uniform initial distributions. Finally, we will determine the leading
order behavior in a flat cylinder with R ≫ a and h ≪ R.
The conditional probability p(x, y) satisfies the Laplace equation [26, 16]

Asymptotic expressions for the conditional probability in a flat cylinder

Numerical evaluations

In Fig. 6a we plot p(1) = 1 − √02 as a function of α for various β (we numerically solve (44) with high
accuracy up to n ∼ 400). As α → 1, the probability p(1) tends to zero because the particles start close
to the lateral boundary. The asymptotic limit of p(1) for large α is one, as shown in (53). However, the
convergence is only logarithmical and therefore very slow. In Fig. 6b we display p(1) as a function of β
for various α: for a fixed value α > 1, the asymptotic limit of p(1) for β → 0 is one, and zero for β → ∞.
The limit for β → 0 is intuitive, because the particles start next to the target. To obtain the asymptotic
limit for β → ∞ we consider (44) for apn and (45): because the coefficients αpn (n ≥ 1) and βnp (n ≥ 0)

tend to zero for large β, the non-vanishing

√ part of (44) is α0 ξn0 a0 p= √
p
the asymptotic limit of a0 for large β is 2, and thus p(1) = 1 − a0 / 2 converges to zero in this limit.
Indeed, for fixed α and increasing β, it becomes less probable that a particle reaches the disk before the
lateral boundary.

and α = 100, and various β between 0.1 and 10, and in Fig. 7a we further show that our analytical
computations agree with results from Brownian simulations. In Fig. 7d we further depict the average
probability pβ (x0 ) when particles are released at the upper surface within an area of radius x0 for similar
values α and β as in panel (c). In general, Fig. 7 shows that p(x, β) is very sensitive to the cylinder
height β and the release position x. For very flat cylinders with β . 1, when the particles are released in

the area opposite to the hole (for x < 1), the probability is ∼ 1, whereas when they are released outside
this region (for x > 1), the probability that they reach the target before exiting decreases considerably
(Fig. 7a-c). For example, Fig. 7b, obtained for β = 0.5 and α = 5, shows that the conditional probability
is larger than 90% when the particles are released at the upper surface within the area x < 1, whereas it
decreases to around 60% when they are released at x ∼ 2. For cylinder with large α the impact of the
release position is much less pronounced (panel (d) with α = 100). In addition, Fig. 7 shows that the
conditional probability to reach the target is more sensitive to changes in the cylinder height β compared
to the radius α.

Impact of truncating the series for p(x, y) in (43)

We now proceed similarly to section 2.3.3 and estimate the error induced by truncating the series in (43)
at small n. We first compute the coefficients api and bpi using (44) with a high accuracy, and then use

truncations). Similarly as in section 2.3.3, we conclude that truncation at n = 1 or n = 2 already provides
a good approximation for β . 1.

Conditional mean time to reach a small target before escaping
a laterally open cylinder

After having estimated the conditional probability p(x, y), we are now in a position to study the conditional MFPT τ̂c (x, y) to reach a target before escaping through the lateral cylinder boundary. This
analysis will estimate the time scale of the synaptic response. For example, the conditional time τ̂c (0, β)
in (67) provides an estimate for the mean time until postsynaptic receptors become activated after transmitter release into the synaptic cleft at the upper cylinder surface. In a wide cylinder with α ≫ 1, (67)
shows that the conditional time τ̂c (0, β) is roughly by a factor 1/(ln α)2 faster than the mean time τ̂ (0, β)
for a laterally closed cylinder, because in a closed cylinder all trajectories that are reflected at the lateral
boundary contribute to the mean time, thereby increasing the mean compared to an open cylinder. Thus,
to obtain a realistic estimation of the synaptic activation time, we have to consider the conditional time
τc for an open cylinder.
To determine the mean conditional time τ̂c (x, y), we use the known conditional probability p(x, y) to
solve an equation for the function A(x, y) = τ̂c (x, y)p(x, y), and then we obtain τ̂c (x, y) from τ̂c (x, y) =

Discussion and conclusion

We generalized here the narrow escape problem to a degenerated geometry defined by a flat cylindrical
compartment of height h and radius R, where the absorbing hole is a small circular disk of radius a
located centrally on the lower surface. We analyzed the problem for a laterally closed and open cylinder.

Figure 9: Conditional MFPT τ̂c (x, β) to reach the hole in a laterally open cylinder for particles that are
released on the surface opposed to the hole. The numerical values for τ̂c (x, β) are calculated using (65)
and α = 50. The data points are the results of Brownian simulations with 10000 particles and α = 50.

Because a uniform analytic expansion of the solution in the whole domain is not possible, we derived two
different expansions in the two subregions Ωi and Ωo , and then matched them at the boundary between
the two subcompartments.
We first analyzed the narrow escape time (NET) τ (r, z) to reach the small hole in a laterally closed
cylinder. For a flat cylinder with h ≪ R and R ≫ a, we obtained that the NET (38) is given by

where the function a0 (β) ∈ [0.07, 0.25] (Fig. 2a). Although (68) was derived in the condition that h ≪ R,
our numerical results suggest that it remains valid until h ∼ R (section 2.3.1). In particular, for a

|V |
cylinder with h/a ≫ ln R
a we recover the well known NET approximation τ ≈ 4aD [36, 10, 14], which
was derived for non degenerated geometries (isoperimetric ratio of order 1 and no bottle neck). However,
|V |
is already a very good approximation for an oblate
our analysis for the cylinder revealed that τ = 4aD

volume with an isoperimetric ratio that can be very different from 1 (although h/a ≫ ln R
a , the ratio
h/R can still be small). Formula 68 can also be used to estimate the rate constant of a key chemical
reaction during the early stage of phototransduction, which is the rate for diffusing cGMP molecules to
reach the phosphodiesterase enzyme located on the surface of a narrow cylinder, located in the outer
segment of a rod photoreceptor [23, 24].
In a next step, we used our method to analyze the narrow escape problem for a flat and laterally open
cylinder, which is relevant for synaptic transmission. In many cases, the geometry of the synaptic cleft is
well approximated by a laterally open cylinder [1, 22, 34], where neurotransmitters are released into the
synaptic cleft from the presynaptic terminal, located on the upper surface. The neurotransmitters move
in the synaptic cleft (Fig. 1) by Brownian diffusion, and they either activate receptors clustered in the
postsynaptic density located on the postsynaptic terminal (corresponding to the lower cylinder surface),
or they leave the synaptic cleft through the lateral boundary without binding to a receptor.
We estimated the conditional probability p(r, z) that a particle starting at position (r, z) reaches the
small hole before leaving the cylinder. By identifying the small hole with the postsynaptic density where
receptors are clustered, we estimated the fraction of released neurotransmitters that reach the receptor
area before leaving the synaptic cleft. Using our analytic solution, we studied the impact of the synaptic
cleft geometry as well as the location of neurotransmitter release. In Fig. 7, we plotted the probability
to reach the postsynaptic density before leaving as a function of the release position for various cylinder
height, and we found that it is very sensitive to the release position and the width of the cylinder. We
conclude that, in order to achieve an efficient activation of postsynaptic receptors, the presynaptic and
postsynaptic densities should be properly aligned such that the neurotransmitters are released opposite
20

to the receptors. Finally, we computed the conditional mean time to reach the small hole before leaving
through the lateral boundary (see (65)). For a wide cylinder, we found that the conditional mean time
is roughly by a factor (2 ln α)2 faster compared to the NET in a closed cylinder (see (67)).
We shall now present some numerical estimates for neurotransmitters that need to activate receptors
clustered in the postsynaptic density with a radius a = 50nm, when the synaptic cleft has a height
h = 20nm and a total radius of R = 500nm, so that α = R/a = 10 and β = h/a = 0.4. When the
transmitter are released at distance r away from the center, the conditional probability is approximately
given by truncating (43) at n = 0

which is a very good approximation, as shown in Fig. 8. Using a diffusion constant D = 200µm2/s, we
obtain for the mean times τ (0, h) ≈ 17µs and τc (0, h) = 1µs.
The exact solution for the mean time and the conditional probability were obtained here by using
the patching eigenfunction expansion approach, and from these approximations, we derived in the limit
of large aspect ratio R/h ≫ 1 the asymptotic behavior. Our approach works well because of the radial
symmetry due to the absorbing trap that is is located at the center of the cylinder. This situation accounts
well for the postsynaptic density located at the center of the post-synaptic terminal. However, using our
method it would be difficult to treat the case of multiple non-concentric traps, and in this case a different
approach based on matching asymptotic analysis should be more appropriate [21, 6]. The analysis should
start with an explicit representation of the Green’s function for a cylinder. Once an inner solution is
determined near each trap, it should be matched to the outer solution [21]. This method should allow to
study the effect of the trap positions and trap clustering on the synaptic current, which was only partially
discussed in [34, 15].
