In the absence of synaptic coupling, two or more neural oscillators may become synchronized by
virtue of the statistical correlations in their noisy input streams. Recent work has shown that the
degree of correlation transfer from input currents to output spikes depends not only on intrinsic
oscillator dynamics, but also depends on the length of the observation window over which the
correlation is calculated. In this paper we use stochastic phase reduction and regular perturbations
to derive the correlation of the total phase elapsed over long time scales, a quantity which provides
a convenient proxy for the spike count correlation. Over short time scales, we derive the spike count
correlation directly using straightforward probabilistic reasoning applied to the density of the phase
difference. Our approximations show that output correlation scales with the autocorrelation of the
phase resetting curve over long time scales. We also find a concise expression for the influence of
the shape of the phase resetting curve on the initial slope of the output correlation over short time
scales. These analytic results together with numerical simulations provide new intuitions for the
recent counterintuitive finding that type I oscillators transfer correlations more faithfully than do
type II over long time scales, while the reverse holds true for the better understood case of short
time scales.

While the jury is still out on the functional role of
synchrony and correlations in neural firing, the ubiquity
of these phenomena in the nervous system is suggestive.
One long-standing hypothesis holds that correlated activity in the visual system underlies feature binding. Synchronous oscillations may also play a role in amplifying
signals [1], transmitting information from one layer to
another [2–4], or such oscillations may encode information directly [5–12]. On the other hand, correlations may
negatively impact the signal-to-noise ratio [13–16], and
excessive synchrony is a hallmark of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.
To understand the function of oscillatory correlations,
or one day achieve clinically relevant control over them,
we must first understand the underlying biophysical
mechanisms. While synchrony can arise as the result of
anatomical connectivity between neurons, much recent
work [17–22] has brought to light ways in which correlated activity develops from the inherent stochastisicity
of neural systems. Thus, in the absence of direct coupling, two or more neural oscillators may become synchronized by virtue of the statistical correlations in their
noisy input streams – a phenomenon we will refer to as
stochastic synchrony.
For our analysis of stochastic synchrony, we appeal to
the theory of weak coupling, which holds in the stochastic
context provided the amplitude of the noise is sufficiently
small. In particular, a number of groups [18–20, 23] have
proved that the phase reduction technique [24] can be
applied to oscillators receiving additive noise. Thus, we
reduce a noisily driven oscillator to a scalar differential
equation describing the evolution of the phase. This socalled phase equation depends only on the properties of
the noise and the oscillator’s phase resetting curve (PRC)
which characterizes how small perturbations influence
the oscillator’s subsequent timing or phase.
Neural oscillators can be classified into two types ac-

cording to the bifurcations that occur as the dynamical
system goes from a stable rest state to a stable limit
cycle. Furthermore, the oscillator’s bifurcation class has
been shown to determine the shape of it’s PRC and therefore it’s ability to synchronize. Type I oscillators undergo
the saddle-node-on-an-invariant-circle, or SNIC, bifurcation and the resulting PRC is strictly positive, indicating that perturbations can only advance the oscillator’s
phase. Type II cells undergo the Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, which produces a PRC with both negative and
positive regions; typically, inputs occurring early in the
cycle can delay the phase while later inputs advance it.
See Fig.(1).
An expanding body of work has demonstrated that
over short time scales of less than one period, type II
oscillators are more susceptible to stochastic synchrony
than type I. This has been shown via simulations and
in vivo [17, 25], by deriving the probability distribution
of the phase difference [26], by minimizing the Lyapunov
exponent of the phase difference [27], and most recently
by calculating the spike count correlation over a range
of time windows [28]. The latter study further reports
that this finding reverses over long timescales, namely
that type I oscillators transmit correlations more faithfully than type II when observed over lengths of time
much greater than one period.
In Section I we provide a brief introduction to the
phase reduction technique in a stochastic setting. Next
in Section II we use regular perturbations to give a novel
and straightforward analysis of correlation transfer over
long time scales. To facilitate our derivation, we use the
total elapsed phase as a proxy for the spike count. Note
that the total phase (modulo the period) and the spike
count differ by at most one, which is a negligible quantity
when many spikes have been observed over a long time
window. The expression we derive for the correlation coefficient of the total phase agrees both qualitatively and

FIG. 1. We use the parametrization ∆(θ) = − sin(θ + α) +

quantitatively with the results found in [28].
In Section III we consider short time scales less than
or equal to the period of the oscillation. In this case,
the total phase cannot be used to approximate the spike
count. We therefore derive the spike count correlation
directly, using simple probabilistic reasoning applied to
the density of the phase difference. Our analytic results
together with Monte Carlo simulations corroborate earlier work showing type II oscillators transfer correlations
more readily than type I over short time windows.

NOISY OSCILLATORS

Let us begin with a neural oscillator receiving additive
noise with equations of motion given by
dX = F (X)dt + σξ,
where X ∈ Rn and ξ is a white noise process. When σ =
0, we assume the noiseless system has an asymptotically
stable periodic solution X0 (t) = X0 (t + τ ) with period τ .
As in the deterministic case, we can reduce this highdimensional system to a scalar equation for the evolution
of the phase θ around the limit cycle. Let φ : Rn → S1
map a neighborhood of the limit cycle to the phase on
a circle. That is, θ = φ(X), with θ ∈ [0, 1). Then θ
satisfies
dθ
= 1 + σ∇X φ(X) · ξ,
dt
where we have normalized the unperturbed period to be
one. Next we can close the equation by assuming the
noise amplitude σ is sufficiently small, so that the system trajectory can be approximated by the noiseless limit
cycle X0 :
θ̇ ≈ 1 + σZ(θ) · ξ,

(1)

where Z(θ) = ∇X φ(X0 (θ)) is the adjoint, or phasedependent sensitivity of the trajectory to perturbation

along the limit cycle. In the case of a neural oscillator,
we assume the noisy perturbations arise as the result of
stochastic synaptic input, which influences only the voltage variable. Hence Z(θ) has only one nonzero component, which is proportional to the phase resetting curve
∆(θ).
Thus far, we have used the conventional change of variables to obtain Eq.(1), which therefore must be understood as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) in the
Stratonovich sense. In order to eliminate the correlation
between θ and ξ we must use the Itô change of variables,
which will introduce an additional drift term:
θ̇ = 1 + σ∆(θ)ξ +

σ2 0
∆ (θ)∆(θ).

Here 0 denotes differentiation with respect to θ. For a
detailed discussion of phase reduction in noisy oscillators
see [29].

CORRELATION TRANSFER OVER LONG
TIME SCALES

We now consider the transfer of correlations over time
scales much larger than the natural period of the oscillators. Given the level of correlation between the noisy
inputs, we wish to know what level of correlation remains
between the spike count of two oscillators after some
time. For analytic convenience, however, we will use
the total phase that has elapsed as a proxy for the spike
count. Since these quantities differ by at most one, the
discrepancy will be negligible for the large spike counts
that accrue over long time scales.
Our system will consist of two identical phase oscillators receiving weak, correlated, but not identical, additive white noise. Keeping only terms up to order σ, we
have
θ˙1 = 1 + σ∆(θ1 )ξ1 (t)
θ˙2 = 1 + σ∆(θ2 )ξ2 (t).
The noise takes the form
√
√
ξ1 = c ξ C + 1 − c ξ A
√
√
ξ2 = c ξ C + 1 − c ξ B ,

(2)

(3)

where ξA , ξB and ξC are mutually independent, zero
mean white noise processes, and c ∈ [0, 1] is the correlation between ξ1 and ξ2 , which we will refer to as the
input correlation.
Next let us rewrite Eq.(2) in the form of integral equations:
Z t
θ1 (t) = t + θ1 (0) + σ
∆(θ1 (s))ξ1 (s)ds
0
Z t
θ2 (t) = t + θ2 (0) + σ
∆(θ2 (s))ξ2 (s)ds.

FIG. 2. The steady state distribution P (φ) of phase differences φ is shown for type I (red) and type II (blue) as well as for
intermediate PRCs (dashed purple). Note that the unperturbed period of the oscillators is 2π. (A) Input correlation c = 0.4.
(B) Input correlation c = 0.8.

Let T be length of the window of time over which
we will observe the system. Throughout this discussion we will assume that our system has reached equilibrium, and that time has been reparametrized so that
our observation takes place on the interval t ∈ [0, T ].
In order to quantify the total phase traversed during
this time, we subtract the initial phases by defining
qi (T ) = θi (T ) − θi (0) for i = 1, 2. Thus the total phase
traversed over a time window of length T is given by:

ditions, say θ1 (0), to be distributed uniformly on the interval [0, 2π]. However, at equilibrium the phases obey
the steady state probability distribution P (φ) derived in
[26] and [30], which depends only on the phase difference
φ(t) = θ2 (t) − θ1 (t). Therefore, the average of Eq.(5) is
computed as

with qi (0) = 0 for i = 1, 2. Finally, since we assume σ
is small, let us simplify the integrands by expanding the
phase to lowest order:

When taking expectations of the quantities in Eq.(5),
we must keep in mind that there are four stochastic variables over which averaging must take place. In particular, we must average over the white noise signals ξ1 (t)
and ξ2 (t) and the initial conditions θ1 (0) and θ2 (0).
Assuming we begin observation after the system has
reached equilibrium, we can take one of the initial con-

where 2π is the unperturbed period of the oscillators,
P (φ) is the steady state probability distribution of the
phase difference, and x and y represent the initial conditions θ1 (0) and θ2 (0), respectively. The last line follows
because the white noises have zero mean.
Our goal is to compute the correlation of the total
phase traversed by the two oscillators:

Now let h(x) = 0 ∆(y)∆(y+x)dy be the autocorrelation of the PRC, and let φ(t) = θ2 (t)−θ1 (t) represent the
phase difference as before. Then we can rewrite Eq.(8)
as

FIG. 3. Output correlation for large time windows is shown
as a function of the PRC shape parameter α. Note that when
α = 0 the PRC is a pure sinusoid and therefore the oscillator
is type II; when α = π/2, the oscillator is type I (see Eq.(10)).
Theoretical curves (solid) are a good match for both the simulated total phase correlation (dotted) and the simulated spike
count correlation (starred). Colors indicate the level of input
correlation: 0.2 (blue), 0.4 (green), 0.6 (red), 0.8 (cyan), 0.99

where G(x) = 1 − c (h(x)/h(0)), and N is a normalizing

constant, N = 1/ 0 1/G(x)dx. Let us further define
the PRC to be
∆(θ; α) = − sin(θ + α) − sin(α),

(10)

where α is a parameter that allows us to vary the PRC
shape smoothly between type I (α = π/2) and type II
(α = 0). See Fig.(1). Using this, the phase distribution over long time scales becomes a function of input
correlation and the PRC shape parameter:

In particular, α = 0 for the type II PRC, and hence
cout = 0 to lowest order. Clearly, we have nonzero autocorrelation for nonzero α ≤ π2 , and hence PRCs that
deviate from pure type II will produce higher output correlation over the long timescales considered here.
Expanding the remaining terms in Eq.(14), we find the
approximated output correlation takes the form

(13)

(15)

In Fig.(4) we see that this approximation agrees with
Eq.(8) for c = 0.01 and 0.05 but diverges for c = 0.1.
Note that these curves would all lie below the lowest
curve plotted in Fig.(3) if shown on the same scale.
We verify the preceding analysis by simulating two
phase oscillators perturbed by additive white noise as
described in Eq.(2) and Eq.(3). The simulations used
noise amplitude σ = 0.05, and the input correlation took
the values c ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.99}.
We computed the correlation coefficient of both the
total phase and the spike count, using a range of observation windows T . As shown in Fig.(3), the total phase
correlation and the spike count correlation agree closely
both with each other and with the theoretical curves as
a function of the PRC shape parameter α.

III.

As in [28], we see in Fig.(3) that type I oscillators display greater output correlation than type II oscillators
for any fixed value of the input correlation c, a surprising
finding in light of earlier results that demonstrated the
opposite relationship over short windows of observation.

SHORT TIME SCALES

Now we will calculate the spike count correlation directly for observation windows T that are shorter than

FIG. 5. Joint spiking probability for two oscillators receiving

The subscripts ij indicate the probability that oscillator i or

occurs in [0, T ]. We say that oscillator i spikes when its
phase θi reaches 2π, which is to say θi (T ) ≥ 2π. Assuming as usual that the noise amplitude σ is small, we
expand the phase to lowest order as in Eq.(4), that is
θi (T ) = θi (0) + T + O(σ). Therefore the probability that
oscillator i spikes is simply
P[θi spikes] = P[θi + T ≥ 2π]
P[θi does not spike] = P[θi + T < 2π].
For two oscillators, there are four possibilities for the
joint spike count:

P[θ1 does not spike, θ2 does not spike]
= P[θ1 + T < 2π, θ2 + T < 2π]
P[θ1 spikes, θ2 does not spike]
= P[θ1 + T ≥ 2π, θ2 + T < 2π]
P[θ1 does not spike, θ2 spikes]
= P[θ1 + T < 2π, θ2 + T ≥ 2π]
P[θ1 spikes, θ2 spikes]
= P[θ1 + T ≥ 2π, θ2 + T ≥ 2π].

These probabilities can be obtained directly by integrating the density of the phase difference, Eq.(11),
over the appropriate domain. Note that this gives four
discrete joint probabilities for each observation window
T ∈ [0, 2π]. For convenience, let us define the following

Let X be the random variable such that X = 1 if θ1
spikes during the observation period T , and X = 0 if θ1
does not spike. Similarly, let Y represent the presence or
absence of a spike in oscillator θ2 . Then the covariance
is given by Cov[X, Y ] = E[XY ] − E[X]E[Y ]. In terms of
the functions defined above we have
E[X] = 0 · (f00 + f01 ) + 1 · (f10 + f11 )
= (f10 + f11 ) = E[X 2 ]
E[Y ] = 0 · (f00 + f10 ) + 1 · (f01 + f11 )
= (f01 + f11 ) = E[Y 2 ]
E[XY ] = 0 · 0 · f00 + 1 · 0 · f10 + 0 · 1 · f01 + 1 · 1 · f11
= f11 .
A few simplifications are possible. In particular, the
sum f10 (T ) + f11 (T ) is just the marginal probability that
θ1 spikes within time T . Since θ1 is uniformly distributed,
T
this probability is simply 2π
. Furthermore, we also have

Var[X]Var[Y ] = Var[X]. Therefore the spike count

type II output correlation rises three times faster than
the type I, to lowest order in c. See Fig.(6C,D).

FIG. 7. Output correlation is shown as a function of
intermediate-length observation windows T . Colors indicate
the level of input correlation: 0.2 (blue), 0.4 (green), 0.6 (red),
0.8 (cyan), 0.99 (purple). (A) Type II oscillators (solid) exhibit higher output correlations over short time scales than
do type I (dashed). (B) This result reverses over long time
scales. In all cases, noise amplitude σ = 0.2.

We have demonstrated a novel approach to approximating the spike count correlation of noisy neural oscillators over both long and short time scales. In the case
of long windows of observation T much greater than the
natural period of oscillation, we used the total elapsed
phase, modulo the period, as a proxy for the spike count.
The difference between these quantities is at most one
and hence is negligible for when many spikes are observed over large time windows T . In our perturbation
expansion to lowest order in the noise amplitude, σ, the
correlation between oscillators depends only on the PRC
and the stationary distribution of the phase difference. A
further approximation assuming small input correlation
c reveals that output correlation scales with the autocorrelation of the PRC, which is a nonnegative quantity that
equals zero precisely when the PRC is a pure sinusoid,
i.e., when the oscillator displays type II dynamics. This
observation sheds some light on the counterintuitive finding, first reported by Barreiro, et al. [28], whereby type
I oscillators transfer correlations more faithfully than do
type II over long time scales, although the reverse holds
true for the better understood case of short time scales.
Using straightforward probabilistic reasoning, we computed the spike count correlation directly for short time
scales. In the limit of small T and small c, we obtain
an expression for the initial slope of the output correlation, also known as the correlation susceptibility [8]. In
[8], de la Rocha, et al. use a phenomenological model to
explore the complex relationship between susceptibility,
firing rate and threshold nonlinearities. The present analysis illustrates the contribution of bifurcation structure
via phase resetting dynamics. In particular, the susceptibility is proportional to the peak of the stationary phase
difference distribution, P (φ)|φ=0 , which in turn depends
on the shape of the PRC.
Our analytic expressions in the limit of small noise
agree well with spike count correlations computed from
simulated oscillators. However, for tractability we included only terms of order one in the perturbation expansion of the phase given in Eq.(4). As a result, the
present analysis cannot account for the slow drift of the
correlation due to noise, which is visible for values of T
near 2π in Fig.(6), and is even more apparent for the intermediate values of T shown in Fig.(7). New analytic
methods capable of addressing non-extremal cases would
shed light on this and many other questions in mathematical biology.
