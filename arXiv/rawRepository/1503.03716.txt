In contrast to the well-known destabilization of globular proteins by high pressure, recent work has shown that pressure stabilizes the formation of isolated α-helices. However
all simulations to date have obtained a qualitatively opposite result within the experimental pressure range. We show that using a protein force field (Amber03w) parametrized
in conjunction with an accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) recovers the correct pressuredependence and an overall stability diagram for helix formation similar to that from experiment; on the other hand, we confirm that using TIP3P water results in a very weak pressure
destabilization of helices. By carefully analyzing the contributing factors, we show that
this is not merely a consequence of different peptide conformations sampled using TIP3P.
Rather, there is a critical role for the solvent itself in determining the dependence of total
system volume (peptide and solvent) on helix content. Helical peptide structures exclude a
smaller volume to water, relative to non-helical structures with both the water models, but
the total system volume for helical conformations is higher than non-helical conformations
with TIP3P water at low to intermediate pressures, in contrast to TIP4P/2005 water. Our
results further emphasize the importance of using an accurate water model to study protein
folding under conditions away from standard temperature and pressure.

INTRODUCTION
The dependence of protein folding equilibria on thermodynamic control variables can provide

important insights into the fundamental forces which stabilize folded structures36 . Variation of
temperature is the most commonly used approach due to the ease with which this can be achieved.
A detailed comparison of the temperature-dependence of protein stability with that of the hydrophobic effect, for example, strongly supports the role of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing
protein structure37,38 .
A variable which is less exploited is pressure, due to the greater demands of the experiments
required39,40 . However, it is well-known that high pressure tends to destabilize protein native
structures41,42 , indicative of a positive change of reaction volume for folding. A possible resolution
of this initially counterintuitive effect43 was proposed to be the existence of cavities within the
folded protein44,45 , with substantial support for this hypothesis coming from experiments on cavityforming mutants45,46 . It was also proposed that high pressures can lead to water penetration of
protein’s hydrophobic core due to reduced solvent-solute interfacial free energy47 .
However, the pressure-dependence of the folding equilibria for small, independently folding
elements of secondary structure such as hairpins and helices clearly cannot fit the same picture.
Since they contain no evident internal cavities or well-defined hydrophobic core, any pressure
dependence would have to come from other effects, which might be obscured when studying the
overall folding of a globular protein. Recent experimental work on the pressure dependence of the
helix-coil equilibrium, using either FTIR spectroscopy48,49 or triplet state quenching experiments50
has in fact found the opposite trend to that for protein folding: namely a negative reaction volume
for helix formation, resulting in pressure stabilization of helices for all positive pressures. The
origin of this effect is not clear, especially considering the small magnitude of the volume change
(≈ 0.2–1.0 cm3 .mol−1 per residue). Molecular simulation could potentially help to explain the
origin of this result; however, simulation studies of the pressure dependence of helix formation
have qualitatively contradicted experimental results, finding instead helix destabilization at low to
intermediate pressures, only turning over to stabilization at very high pressure51–53 .
Here, we investigate the pressure dependence of helix formation for a model 15-residue helixforming peptide using two different force field combinations: the Amber ff03* protein force
field54 together with explicit TIP3P water55 and the Amber ff03w protein force field56 with the
TIP4P/2005 water model57 . In agreement with earlier studies with TIP3P water on the effect of
2

pressure on helix formation, we find a positive reaction volume for helix formation at low to intermediate pressures. In contrast, a qualitatively correct result is obtained with TIP4P/2005, i.e.,
a negative reaction volume for helix formation. This difference, obtained for the same sequence
with almost identical protein force fields, suggests a key role for water. There are essentially two
ways in which water can be envisaged to influence the reaction volume: (i) it may alter the conformations sampled for a given total number of helical residues, particularly for the non-helical states
and (ii) different water models may be more or less closely coordinated with helical than with
non-helical structures. While there is no doubt that water influences the conformational sampling,
we show that in fact the different solvation of helical and non-helical states plays a key role in
determining the volume changes, and for both water models opposes the much larger decrease in
volume excluded to water associated with helix formation. The result obtained with TIP3P water
at low to intermediate pressures is qualitatively inconsistent with experiment, as the total system
volume is higher for helical structures than for non-helical structures. Our results highlight the
importance of using an accurate water model for capturing biomolecular equilibria at state points
away from standard conditions.

METHODS

A.

Simulation methods
Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations with gromacs 4.0.7 or 4.5.358 were

used to sample the folding of the blocked peptide Ac-(AAQAA)3 -NH2 with either (i) the Amber ff03* force field54 and TIP3P water model55 or (ii) the Amber ff03w force field56 and the
TIP4P/2005 water model57 . For ff03*, 42 replicas spanning a temperature range from 275 to 496
K were used, and for ff03w, 40 replicas spanning 250 to 452 K. Periodic boundary conditions
with a truncated octadron minimum image cell of initial edge 4.5 nm were used. Simulations were
maintained at a constant pressure with a Parrinello-Rahman barostat59 and temperature was controlled via Langevin dynamics with a friction coefficient of 0.2 ps−1 (ff03*) or 1.0 ps−1 (ff03w).
Note that the difference in friction coefficients will not alter the equilibrium properties considered
here, and both values are sufficient to maintain constant temperature. Simulations were run for
100-200 ns per replica. A seperate set of REMD runs was performed for each pressure, using 1
bar, 2 kbar, 4 kbar, 8 kbar and 12 kbar for Amber ff03* and 1 bar , 1 kbar, 4 kbar, 8 kbar for Amber
3

ff03w.
To determine the change of volume associated with helix formation, initial configurations were
obtained by random selection from the 298 K replica of the ff03* simulations. For each number of
helical residues (0, 3, 4, . . . 15), 20 configurations were chosen with that helix content. From each
of these configurations, 10 ns simulations were performed using position restraints to keep the
peptide close to its initial structure, with force constants of 1000 kJ.mol−1 .nm−2 on each cartesian
coordinate, and using both the ff03* and ff03w force fields. Average total system volumes were
computed from each of these runs.

B.

Helix formation
We define helical states using the backbone Ramachandran angles, in the spirit of the Lifson-

Roig theory. We define the helical region of the Ramachandran map as φ ∈ [−100◦ , −30◦ ] and
ψ ∈ [−67◦ , −7◦ ]. A helical segment is defined as three consecutive residues with their backbone

torsion angles lying in this range. Therefore the total number of helical residues in the blocked
15-residue peptide considered can take on values in {0, 3, 4, 5, . . . , 14, 15}. This method gives
results which are consistent with other definitions of helix54 .

C.

Helix-coil models
Simulation data on helix formation were initially described by a Lifson-Roig model60 , with nu-

cleation parameter v and elongation parameter w. These parameters were fitted by maximizing the
likelihood of the observed conformations, given the equilibrium probabilities generated from the
Lifson-Roig partition function, using a previously described procedure54 . Since the experimental
data had been fitted to the Zimm-Bragg model for helix formation61 , we also converted the fit
parameters to the Zimm-Bragg nucleation and elongation parameters σ and s respectively, using
the approximate relations62 :

Thermodynamic Model
The dependence of the helix elongation free energy, ∆Gel on pressure and temperature was

fitted to a thermodynamic model:
∆Gel (P, T ) = ∆H0 + ∆CP (T − T0 )
−T ∆S0 − T ∆CP ln(T /T0 )
∆β
(P − P0 )2
+∆V (P − P0 ) +
2
+∆α(T − T0 )(P − P0 ).

(2)

In this expression, ∆H0 , ∆S0 , and ∆V0 are the change of enthalpy, entropy and volume as a result
of helix elongation at reference conditions, taken to be T0 = 298 K and P0 = 1 bar pressure. In
addition, a constant change of heat capacity, ∆CP , change of linear expansion coefficient ∆α and
change of compressibility, ∆β were assumed. The data were fitted by non-linear least squares,
and errors were estimated by Monte Carlo bootstrapping.

RESULTS

In order to determine the effects controlling helix stability under pressure, we carefully selected
two protein force fields, Amber ff03* and Amber ff03w. These models are almost identical, being
originally based on the standard Amber ff03 force field63 . They only differ in that an additional
empirically determined Fourier term has been added to the ψ backbone torsion angle in each case,
in order to approximately match experimental helix propensities near 300 K54,56 . In the case of
ff03*, the calibration was done in conjunction with the TIP3P water model, while for ff03w it
was done with TIP4P/2005 water (below, it will be assumed when discussing Amber ff03* and
ff03w that the TIP3P and TIP4P/2005 water models were used, respectively). This allows us to
test specifically the effects of the water model using closely related protein force fields that have
very similar helical populations under standard conditions of temperature and pressure. We study
the 15-residue peptide Ac-(AAQAA)3 -NH2 , as a model system which is known to form helix at
low temperature64 , and which has been extensively characterized in previous simulations54,56,65 .
Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations were performed in order to sample
the temperature-dependent helix-coil equilibrium. The average fraction helix at each temperature
is shown in Figure 1, as determined using backbone dihedral angles. Very similar results are
5

obtained using the standard DSSP66 algorithm, which instead uses backbone hydrogen bonds (See
Fig. S167 ). As expected both Amber ff03* and ff03w populate 20 − 30 % helix at 300 K and 1

bar pressure, where they were parametrized against experimentally determined helix populations.
For Amber ff03w, all pressures used resulted in a stabilization of the peptide, even at 1 kbar.
On the other hand, over a wide range, from 1 bar to 8 kbar, pressure had very little effect on the
overall helix propensity for Amber ff03*: a slight decrease in helix fraction at temperatures greater
than ∼ 300K is observed. Only for a pressure of 12 kbar is a significant stabilization obtained.

Qualitatively, these results suggest a negative reaction volume for helix formation using Amber
ff03w, but a very small or positive reaction volume at low to intermediate pressure using Amber
ff03*.
We quantify the effect of pressure on the helix-coil equilibrium using a thermodynamic model.
However, helix-formation is not a simple two-state process, and involves a broad spectrum of populated intermediates. Therefore, we first fit a simple Ising-like statistical mechanics model which
can capture the helix-coil transition. The two classic partition functions for helix-coil formation
are those by Zimm and Bragg61 and by Lifson and Roig60 , which are approximately equivalent62 .
We have determined parameters for both models here. The data were initially fitted to the LifsonRoig model, using a previously described maximum likelihood method54 , yielding a nucleation
parameter v and an elongation parameter w. These parameters were then converted into the corresponding parameters for the Zimm-Bragg model, σ and s. Overall, all these parameters show
essentially similar trends to the global fraction of helix, but can be more justifiably fitted to a
thermodynamic two-state model since they describe the microscopic transitions involving the flipping of individual residues between helical and extended conformations. Below we focus on the
Zimm-Bragg model, as this has been used to characterize the experimental data49,50 . In particular, the elongation parameter s corresponds to the equilibrium constant for adding a single helical
hydrogen bond.
We fitted a thermodynamic model to the elongation free energy, here defined as ∆Gel (P, T ) =
−RT ln s(P, T ). The model includes changes of enthalpy ∆H0 , entropy ∆S0 and reaction volume
∆V0 under standard conditions, as well as constant differences in heat capacity ∆CP , isothermal

compressibility ∆β and linear thermal expansion coefficient ∆α to describe the temperature- and
pressure-dependence. The same model was fitted to the data for RT ln s(P, T ) reported by Imamura et al., based on FTIR measurements49 . The fits to the raw data are shown in Fig. S267 . In
Fig. 2 we show the stability diagram for each force field and for experiment; the fitted parameters
6

are listed in Table I.
Overall, the stability diagram obtained with the Amber ff03w force field is very similar to experiment, bearing in mind that the experiments were done on a different alanine-based peptide
(AK20) – we note that the stability diagrams for the AK16 peptide obtained by Hatch et al52 with
Amber ff03* and TIP3P are qualitatively very similar to those we obtain for Ac-(AAQAA)3 -NH2
with the same force field and water model. This is particularly true in the range of temperature
and pressure probed by the experiments, indicated by the broken lines in Fig. 2. In both cases,
increasing pressure clearly stabilizes helical states, as also reflected in the negative reaction volume of −0.8 cm3 .mol−1 for experiment and −1.5 cm3 .mol−1 for Amber ff03w (Table 1). It also
captures quite well the overall enthalpy and entropy changes for adding a helical residue, as previously noted56 . In contrast, the stability diagram for the ff03* force field differs in some important
respects. Application of low pressures will have little effect on, or slightly destabilize helical,
reflected in the small positive ∆V0 = 0.4 cm3 .mol−1 (Table 1) for helix formation. Additionally,
the changes in enthalpy and entropy are almost half the experimental estimates, indicative of too
low a cooperativity of helix melting54 . For experiment and both force fields, the changes in heat
capacity are small. This is in contrast to protein folding38 , and may indicate a limited role for the
hydrophobic effect in stabilizing helices. For both force fields, the difference in thermal linear
expansion coefficients, ∆α, is small and positive, ∼ 4 cm3 .mol−1 .K−1 . This implies a change

of reaction volume with temperature which will slightly increase the positive reaction volume for
Amber ff03*, but is insufficient to change the sign of the negative reaction volume using Amber
ff03w. Over the the range of temperature where liquid water is stable the effect is too small to
qualitatively change the pressure-dependence of the two models.
The differences in enthalpy and entropy between the two solvent models have been explained
in terms of the strength of solvent interactions with the peptide chain56 . These differences also
result in a more expanded unfolded state for ff03w relative to ff03*. How can the differences in
reaction volume be understood? The first explanation would be in terms of changes in the peptide
free energy surface – i.e. different conformations are preferred by each force field, particularly
for non-helical states. This is undoubtedly a contribution, since these free energy surfaces are
evidently different. In Fig. 3, we show representative two-dimensional free energy surfaces as a
function of the radius of gyration and the number of helical residues. As anticipated, the radius
of gyration of the helical states is similar, but the non-helical states are much more collapsed in
the case of ff03* compared to ff03w. If one supposes that a more collapsed unfolded state is
7

associated with a smaller volume, then this would be consistent with the observed differences in
reaction volume for helix formation for the two force fields.
In order to investigate the above hypothesis, we determined the approximate volume excluded
to water by each peptide conformation by using the Connolly volume: this is the volume which
is inaccessible to a sphere of radius 0.14 nm. This is the simplest way in which the volume of a
configuration can be estimated. The average Connolly volumes for configurations with the same
number of helical residues are shown in Fig. 4, for the replica at 298 K. The results clearly show
that more helical states have a smaller total volume for both ff03* and ff03w, which is qualitatively consistent with the negative change of volume for helix formation observed experimentally.
However, it does not explain why under low pressure conditions the reaction volume for TIP3P
may be positive, and the overall changes of 10-15 cm3 .mol−1 per helical residue are about an order
of magnitude larger than the volume changes estimated from the thermodynamic fits in Table I. It
also does not explain the reduction of reaction volume for ff03* with pressure, such that it becomes
negative at sufficiently high pressures. Although we find that helical states do have smaller Connolly volume above 4 kbar, in agreement with earlier findings based on the radius of gyration53 , we
also find an even greater reduction in volume for non-helical states so that the difference in volume
between non-helical and helical states would become more positive with increasing pressure, the
opposite trend to that observed for the total reaction volume of the system. Therefore, a simple
picture based only on properties of the peptide configurations does not tell the whole story.
Naturally, the surrounding solvent may also play a role in determining the dependence of system volume on peptide conformation, and previous studies have suggested that peptide solvation
changes with increasing pressure51,68 , and changes in water structure with increasing pressure are
known to alter the hydrophobic effect44 . We probed for this by randomly drawing configurations
from the 298 K replica from the 1 bar Amber ff03* REMD simulation, and then determining
for each of these the average system volume using different force fields and system pressures (1
bar and 4 bar). That is, we effectively remove the influence of different free energy surfaces with
different force fields by always considering the same set of peptide configurations. By running sufficiently long constant pressure simulations with each of these configurations, restrained to their
initial position, we can accurately determine the average system volume, as a function of the number of helical residues. The results of these simulations for the Amber ff03* and ff03w force fields
are summarized in Fig. 5. We find that this simple analysis captures the reaction volume effects
inferred from the thermodynamic fits. Namely, at 1 bar pressure, the reaction volume for helix
8

formation is positive with ff03* and negative with ff03w (Fig. 5A,C), while at 4 bar pressure the
change of volume upon helix formation becomes negative even for TIP3P (Fig. 5B,D). The large
scatter in the individual system volumes (black data points) indicates that other factors besides
helicity are important for determining system volume. Nonetheless, when the volume of a given
configuration with ff03w is subtracted from that with ff03*, these effects are largely eliminated,
leaving helicity as the main determinant of the difference between the two water models (Figure
5E-F). This result highlights the importance of solvation in determining the difference in apparent
volume between the helical and less helical states.
Although Amber ff03* with the TIP3P water model may fail to describe the correct qualitative
pressure-dependence of helix stability, it should be noted that the differences in reaction volume
under consideration are extremely tiny: a change of volume ∆V = 1 cm3 .mol−1 per residue, or
1.66 × 10−3 nm3 per molecule per residue can be related to a change of apparent helix radius ∆R

using a helix pitch of ∆L ∼ 0.15 nm and helix radius R ∼ 0.45 nm via ∆R ≈ ∆V /2πR∆L,
yielding a change of apparent radius ∆R ≈ 0.0039 nm. While this is a simplified model calculation, it serves to illustrate the subtlety of the effect that must be captured.

IV.

CONCLUSION
The dependence of globular protein stability on pressure has been found to be mainly deter-

mined by cavities in the folded structure, masking other possible effects of interest. In the case
of helix formation, in fact the opposite trend is found to that for protein folding, namely pressure stabilization of helices. We have shown here that simulations with an accurate water model,
TIP4P/2005, are capable of capturing the pressure dependence of helix formation. Further, in
agreement with earlier work, we find that using the TIP3P water model leads to pressure-induced
destabilization of helices, a qualitatively incorrect result. We further show here that this difference
is not merely due to the different peptide conformations sampled with that water model. Instead
there is a critical role for solvent structure in determining the reaction volume changes. Taken
together, our results emphasize the importance of using an accurate water model for capturing the
folding of peptides and proteins under different thermodynamic conditions.
The experimental results obtained for helix formation have proved to be a stringent test for
simulation models. In future, it would be very interesting to compare simulation results with experimental data for other model peptides such as β-hairpins, should such data become available.
9

Experimental kinetics results for the pressure-dependence of helix50 and protein folding69,70 kinetics are also a rich source of information for future detailed comparison with molecular simulation.
