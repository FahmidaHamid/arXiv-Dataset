Abstract
For a class of polynomial kinetic systems, this work examines connections between system parameters, and uniqueness and stability of the resulting equilibria. Such systems are
typically employed to describe nonlinear dynamics in chemical reaction networks, but over
the last years they proved useful in modeling a wide range of nonlinear dynamic systems
with applications in biology, process systems, economics or transportation problems.
In particular, a canonical representation of the set of all possible feasible equilibrium
solutions is developed. The characterization is made in terms of compartmental matrices
which by construction are strictly stable and define the so-called family of solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear in the log-transformed space of
complexes, and relate to the kernel of the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly interesting representation of these constraints can be established in terms of a class of monotonous
functions which turn out to be critical to conclude uniqueness of equilibrium points in a class
of deficiency one networks.
One main consequence of such representation is the possibility of a simple constructive
proof of the deficiency one theorem. It also allows a precise characterization of the parameter
space region of complex balance solutions we refer to as the Horn set. Future directions may
involve detection or design of networks having multiple equilibria, or the use of complex
balance condition to provide stabilization via feed-back control of open reaction systems .

Introduction

Deterministic reaction networks (also called kinetic systems) , obeying a mass action law (MAL)
kinetics form an important subclass of nonnegative systems which in spite of their apparent simplicity, are capable of a quite rich dynamic behavior that includes multiple equilibria conditions,
oscillations or even chaos [1, 2].
Such networks are typically employed to describe the dynamics of open or closed chemical
reaction systems, but over the last years they proved useful in modeling biological systems from
the level of cells up to the ecological dimension (i.e. including interaction between individuals),
including among other applications studies on disease propagation dynamics, etc. Reaction
networks belong to the class of nonnegative (or positive) systems the main characteristics of

2

which is that the non-negative orthant is invariant for the dynamics. The application field of
nonnegative systems extends far beyond (bio)chemistry and includes dynamical models whose
state variables are naturally nonnegative or can be transformed to be nonnegative, such as
certain process systems (heat exchangers, distillation columns, convection networks), economic,
transportation or stochastic models [3]. With an appropriate selection of coordinates, even many
classical mechanical and electrical models can be described in the nonnegative framework. The
main specialty of reaction networks within nonnegative polynomial models is the lack of socalled cross-effects that defines an additional constraint between the monomial coefficients and
exponents [1]. Still, the class of reaction network models is quite wide, and many non-chemical
models can be easily transformed to kinetic form using simple transformations[2, 4]. Widely
used examples of kinetic systems are Lotka-Volterra models into which most smooth nonlinear
ODEs can be embedded [5], and compartmental systems [6]. These facts clearly underline the
importance of reaction network models and motivate us to attempt to look at general dynamical
models through the glasses of kinetic systems.
The study of the relationships between chemical reaction structure and dynamic behaviour, is
the purpose of Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT), a program formally proposed and
developed by [7, 8, 9]. The subsequent works by [10, 11], collected in its most comprehensive
form in [12], exploring the dynamic properties of MAL complex chemical systems, contributed
to equip CRNT with a mathematical formalism that has prevail up to present.
One fundamental problem in chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is to decide from the
structure or parameters of the network, whether it can exhibit or not multiple equilibria. In
answering such a question, the concept of network deficiency, a number that relates network
structure with its dynamics, becomes central to characterize the network behavior.
Two essential results of CRNT are the so-called deficiency zero and deficiency one theorems
[12, 13] which establish conditions for networks to have just one possible equilibrium independently of parameter values (more precisely, as long as none of the reactions rate constants vanish
i.e. all rate coefficients remain strictly positive). Such conditions are valid despite of the constraints imposed by the chemical species conservation which define the reaction simplex [12]. In
particular, for networks with zero deficiency, positive equilibria for any set of positive network
parameters will be unique in each reaction simplex and stable. This suggests network robustness
with respect to parameter variability and underlines the importance of the kinetic system class
in general nonlinear systems theory.
CRNT has received renewed interest over the last years, particularly in the area of systems
biology because of its potential to explore and to analyse complex behavior and functionality
in biological systems (e.g. [14, 15, 16, 17]). Most efforts have been directed to investigate
the relationships between reaction network structure and the capacities of various kinds of

3

behaviour. In this regard, special mention should be made of the so-called injectivity property,
investigated as a condition that relates to the singularity or not of the determinant of the
Jacobian associated to the right hand side of the resulting dynamic system [18]. Algebraic
and graph theoretical methods have been devised to check injectivity and therefore uniqueness
of equilibria [18, 19]. In the same direction, extensions to cope with instabilities have been
developed in [15]. From different perspectives, a number of necessary and sufficient conditions
for a given network structure and stoichiometry to accommodate multiple equilibria have been
also recently proposed in [16, 17].
A particularly interesting class of chemical networks are the reversible ones either in the strict
thermodynamic sense, in which every elementary reaction step is reversible, or those which
integrate reversible as well as irreversible steps (weakly reversible networks). Reversibility leads
to a particular set of positive equilibria which is known as detailed balance if each reaction step
is equilibrated by a reverse one, or complex balance if the network is weakly reversible.
At this point, it must be remarked that equilibrium should be understood along the sequel in
the sense given in dynamic systems, irrespectively of whether it corresponds to thermodynamic
equilibrium or to a particular steady-state on a chemical reactor. Having said that, it must be
noted that, in agrement with thermodynamics, instabilities in the dynamics of reaction systems
when taking place on a homogeneous medium in isothermal conditions require the reaction
domain to be open to mass exchange with the environment.
Because of microreversibility, most chemical systems when closed to mass and energy exchanges
with the environment satisfy the principle of detailed balance, resulting into stable equilibria
[20]. As discussed in [21] and [22] irreversibility can be allowed within a reaction network,
as limit cases of reversible steps under a thermodynamic consistency condition, known as the
Wegscheider conditions, which necessarily assumes microreversibility.
The notion of complex balance (also known as cyclic balance o semi-detailed balance), on the
other hand, generalizes the detailed balance condition to any weakly reversible network. The
structure of complex balance systems has been explored in [23] and shown to be a toric variety
with unique and stable equilibrium points (see also [24]). Extensions to cope with more general
classes of kinetic systems have been investigated in [25, 26].
CRNT as its stands nowadays within the field of applied mathematics offers an extraordinary
potential in system’s theory for analysis and design of complex dynamic systems of polynomial
type what in turn may cover a wide spectrum of chemical and biological systems. Unfortunately,
many of its results remain at a large extent unexploited, when not unnoticed, in the fields of
process systems and engineering.
Reasons that hamper application are usually found within the traditionally obscure architec-

4

ture of their methods and proofs, and the inherent difficulties of graph theoretical methods in
which the theory emerged, to properly suit applications. Some practical questions that demand
attention relate to the link between dynamic behavior of a given mechanism and parameter
sets (reaction rate constants), or to the design of a chemical/biochemical network with some
pre-specified behaviour (e.g bistable, oscillatory, etc).
In order to contribute to fill the gap between theory and potential applications, we adopt in
this paper a geometric perspective in the line of the [27, 17, 28] to revisit the essential elements
of CRNT. To that purpose the notion of ‘family of solutions’ and feasibility will be employed.
Originally, both concepts have been derived in [27, 17] to study multiplicity phenomena as a
function of network parameters and to describe regions in the parameter space (Horn sets) [28]
complying with complex balance solutions [29].
In this contribution, feasible solutions will be characterized in terms of a class of stable Metzler
matrices [30] and a set of constraints which relate to the null space associated to the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly interesting representation of these constraints will be discussed
in Sections 4 and 5, and employed to conclude uniqueness for a class of positive deficiency networks. This result, we obtained by geometric methods, is equivalent to the one discussed in [31]
in the context of graph theory. Such representation will constitute the basis for a constructive
proof of the deficiency one theorem as well as to the characterization of the Horn set, namely
that which defines in the parameter space the region of complex balance solutions.
Since as we will see, complex balance ensures stability of the equilibrium, this property can be
useful to characterize stable operation regimes in open systems, where the principle of detailed
balance cannot hold. This may lead to the selection or manipulation of exchange fluxes so to
preserve stability of the resulting open to the environment reaction system, for instance via
appropriate process optimization and/or feed-back control. Future directions may involve, in
addition the detection or design of networks having multiple equilibria.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces a formal description of chemical reaction
networks. The graph structure underlying a reaction network an its algebraic counterpart will
be described in Section 3. The canonical representation of the equilibrium set including feasibility conditions will be presented in Section 4. Relationships between network structure and
monotonicity of feasibility conditions will be established in Section 5. This will constitute the
essential result needed to conclude in Section 6 uniqueness and stability of equilibria for complex
balance and some classes of deficiency 1 networks.

Preliminaries: Reaction Network Structure and Dynamics

Let m be the number of chemical species which are transformed among themselves by a set
of irreversible chemical reaction steps, and c ∈ Rm be the corresponding vector of species
concentrations, defined as number of molecules (e.g. mole numbers) per unit of volume. Each
reaction step transforms some set of chemicals, usually referred to as reactants, into a set
of reaction products. In CRNT, reactants and reaction products receive the name of reaction
complexes. Complexes and reaction steps describe a graph where complexes correspond to nodes
and reaction steps to edges.
Formally, the graph involving n complexes {C1 , . . . , Cn } linked by irreversible reaction steps can
be constructed by associating to each complex i a set Ii of integer elements with ordinality in
n, and a vector yi . The elements of the set Ii are the indices of the complexes that are directly
reachable (i.e. by one reaction step) from Ci in the reaction graph. Vector yi ∈ Rm has as entries
the (positive) stoichiometric coefficients of the molecular species that participate in complex i.
The graph structure is then built by linking every complex i to j ∈ Ii . This process results in
a number ℓ of connected components known in CRNT as linkage classes. For each linkage class
λ = 1, ..., ℓ, we define the set Lλ as that containing as elements the indices of the complexes that
belong to that linkage class1 . The complexes that belong to the network will be in the set
L=

[ℓ

λ=1

Lλ .

Complexes are connected within a linkage class by sequences of irreversible reaction steps defining
directed paths. Two complexes are strongly linked if they can be reached from each other by
directed paths (trivially every complex is strongly linked to itself). A maximal set of strongly
linked complexes defines a strong terminal linkage class if no other complex can be reached
from its elements. A linkage class Lλ is said to be weakly reversible if all its complexes are
strongly linked. Weakly reversible networks are those composed by weakly reversible linkage
classes. Clearly, a CRN is weakly reversible if and only if all components of the reaction graph
are strongly connected components.
A particular class of weakly reversible linkage class is a reversible linkage class if each reaction
step is itself reversible. Therefore, reversible networks require for every i and j ∈ Ii , to have
that i ∈ Ij .
1

To be precise, the set Lλ will be that containing as elements Lλ = {i1 , i2 , ..., iNλ }, with Nλ = N (Lλ ), being
ij the cardinality associated to complex Cij , and N (·) the operator which indicates the number of elements in the
set.

6

To each linkage class λ we associate an n-dimensional vector ωλ which is defined as follows:2
ωλ =

X

εi ,

(1)

i∈Lλ

where εi ∈ Nn denotes the ith standard unit vector employed to represent axes on a cartesian
coordinate system. Vectors ωλ (λ = 1, ..., ℓ) are orthogonal to each other since by construction,
sets Lλ are disjoint. The rate Rij at which a set of chemical species (reactants) representing
complex i is transformed into a set of products represented by complex j will be assumed to be
mass action, hence:
Rij = kij ψi (c), with ψi (c) =

m
Y

y

cj ji ≡ cyi ,

(2)

j=1

The reaction systems we consider in this work will take place under isothermal conditions what
makes any reaction rate parameter kij > 0 constant. Whenever c is a strictly positive vector
(meaning all components strictly positive), the following alternative representation for ψi (c) may
be more convenient:
ln ψi (c) = yiT ln c,

(3)

where the natural logarithm operator ln(·) will act on any vector element-wise. Let ψ(c) ∈ Rn
be the vector containing as entries the monomials described in (2), then previous expression can
be written in matrix form as:
ln ψ(c) = Y T ln c.

(4)

where Y ∈ Rm×n is the so-called molecularity matrix which collects as columns the stoichiometric
vectors yi associated to the complexes of the network.

2.1

The dynamics of reaction networks

The time evolution of species concentrations on a well-mixed reaction medium at constant
temperature can be described by a set of ordinary differential equations of the form [11]:
ċ = Y · Ak (ψ) ≡ Y ·

X

Aλk (ψ),

(5)

λ

with Aλk (ψ) being a linear operator that accepts the following equivalent factorizations:
Aλk (ψ) =

X

kij · (εj − εi )

j∈Ii

i∈Lλ

X

≡

φi (ψ)(εi − εjλ ),

i∈Lλ \jλ

Vector ωλ is referred in classical CRNT as the characteristic function of linkage class λ.

(6)

jλ ∈ Lλ in the above expression represents a reference complex selected from the corresponding
strongly terminal linkage class and φi represents the net reaction rate flux around complex i,
which is defined as:
X

φi (ψ) =

Rji −

X

Rij ,

(7)

j∈Ii

(j/i∈Lj )

where the first summation at the right hand side must be understood as that extended to all j
that reach i by a reaction step and is represented by (j/i ∈ Lj ). Since vectors εi are orthogonal,
λ
T λ
we have from (6) that φi (ψ) = εT
i Ak (ψ) for every i ∈ Lλ , and ωλ Ak (ψ) = 0. Therefore:

X

i∈Lλ



φi = 

X

i∈Lλ

T

εi  Aλk (ψ) = 0.

(8)

Fluxes φi as well as the operator Ak , are implicitly dependent on the set of reaction rate constants
kij of the network. By inspection of (6), it can be concluded that the image of Ak (ψ) lies within
the subspace ∆ defined as:
∆=

Sℓ

λ=1 ∆λ

with ∆λ = span{εi − εjλ | i ∈ Lλ \ jλ } .

(9)

Since vectors in {εi −εjλ | i ∈ Lλ \jλ } are linearly independent they form a basis for the subspace
∆λ , thus dim(∆λ ) = Nλ − 1. In addition, since the subspaces ∆λ are orthogonal:
dim(∆) =

X
(Nλ − 1) = n − ℓ.
λ

This implies that Ak (ψ) = 0 if and only if φi = 0 for all i ∈ L. Consequently, if a positive
concentration vector c exists compatible with a zero flux condition for every complex in the
network, that vector should be an equilibrium for system (5). Such equilibrium condition,
known as complex balance [29], is formally defined as follows:
Definition 2.1 (Complex Balance Equilibrium) For a weakly reversible network, any vector c∗ ≻ 0 such that ψ ∗ , being ln ψ ∗ = Y T ln c∗ (Eqn 4), makes zero every flux φi (ψ) in Eqn
(7) is known as a complex balance equilibrium solution.

A subclass of complex balance solution, particularly meaninful from a thermodynamic point of
view since it relates with microreversibility ([32, 20]) is the detailed balance condition, we define
next
Definition 2.2 (Detailed Balance Equilibrium) If in addition, the network is reversible so
that for every i and j ∈ Ii , we have that i ∈ Ij , any vector c∗ ≻ 0 such that Rij (c∗ ) = Rji (c∗ )
(where Rij is of the form (2)) is known as a detailed balance equilibrium solution.

2.2

The stoichiometric subspace

We define the stoichiometric subspace Σ as that spanned by the union over all linkage classes λ
of the vector sets:
Σλ = span{yi − yjλ | i ∈ Lλ \ jλ } and Σ =

Sℓ

λ=1 Σλ

.

(10)

In what follows it will be more convenient to collect the elements from each of the sets {yi −
yjλ | i ∈ Lλ \ jλ } and their union, column-wise in matrices Sλ ∈ Rm×(Nλ −1) and S ∈ Rm×(n−ℓ) ,
respectively. Let s = dim(Σ), which eventually coincides with the rank os S, then it follows
from the rank-nullity theorem that the dimension of the kernel (null space) of S will be:
δ = n − ℓ − s.

(11)

This number is known in CRNT as the deficiency of the network. In a similar way, we can define
the deficiency of each linkage class as the dimension of the kernel of Sλ so that δλ = Nλ − 1 − sλ ,
P
where sλ = dim(Σλ ). Since s ≤ λ sλ , it is not difficult to conclude that linkage class and
network deficiencies relate as:

δ≥

X

δλ .

(12)

λ

Let {gr | r = 1, . . . , δ} be a basis in the kernel of S, and express each vector gr in terms of ℓ
sub-vectors grλ ∈ RNλ −1 (one per linkage class), so that:
(gr )T = [ (gr1 )T

· · · (grλ )T

· · · (grℓ )T ].

Using the above description, equation Sgr = 0 can be re-written for every r = 1, . . . , δ as:
X
(13)
Sλ grλ = 0 for r = 1, . . . , δ.
λ

We will be particularly interested in solutions of system (5) on the convex region resulting from
the intersection of the positive orthant in the concentration space and a linear variety associated
to the stoichiometric subspace Σ (also known in CRNT as compatibility class). Such region can
be formally defined with respect to a reference concentration vector c0 as:
Ω(c0 ) = {c ∈ Rm | c  0, B T (c − c0 ) = 0},

(14)

where B ∈ Rm×(m−s) is a full rank matrix whose columns span the orthogonal complement Σ⊥ .
In passing it is noted that the vector function σ = B T c is constant along trajectories (5), since
by combining (6) and (5) we have that:
X X
ċ =
φi (ψ)(yi − yjλ ),

(15)

λ i∈Lλ \jλ

and the columns of B are orthogonal to S, hence σ̇ ≡ B T ċ = 0. In other words, σ is an invariant
of motion for system (5). From this observation it is not difficult to conclude that any trajectory
that starts in a compatibility class Ω(c0 ) will remain there.

Some examples of chemical reaction networks

A reversible chemical reaction network
Let us consider a reaction network involving m = 6 molecular species we label as M1 , ..., M6 ,
each of them constituted by a combination of three types of functional groups (or atoms) we
denote as A, B and C. The (reversible) chemical reactions steps that take place are:
A2 B + C ⇆ AC + AB
AB + 2C ⇆ AC2 B
AC2 B ⇆ AC + CB

(16)

Molecular species and functional groups are related as follows: M1 ≡ A2 B, M2 ≡ AC, M3 ≡ AB,
M4 ≡ C, M5 ≡ AC2 B, M6 ≡ CB. The network consists of n = 5 complexes:
{C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 } ≡ {M1 + M4 , M2 + M3 , M3 + 2M4 , M5 , M2 + M6 }
Making use of the formal description previously discussed, the sets Ii that indicate which complexes are reached from complex i become, for this example:
I1 = {2} I2 = {1} I3 = {4} I4 = {3, 5} I5 = {4}

(17)

The corresponding stoichiometric vectors yi associated to each complex are written as columns
in the molecularity matrix Y :

The corresponding graph representation is depicted in Figure 1. It comprises two linkage classes

Selecting j1 = 1 and j2 = 3 as reference complexes for linkage class λ = 1 and λ = 2, respectively,
the net reaction fluxes around each complex, as defined in (7), become:
φ2 = k12 ψ1 − k21 ψ2
φ4 = k34 ψ3 + k54 ψ5 − (k43 + k45 )ψ4
φ5 = k45 ψ4 − k54 ψ5

(19)

Note that by relation (8), the fluxes associated to the reference become:
φ1 = −φ2

φ3 = −(φ4 + φ5 )

and

The image of the operator Aλk defined in (6) lies in subspace ∆ (Eqn (9)) which results from the
union of the following subspaces:
∆1 = span{(ε2 − ε1 )}
.
∆2 = span{(ε4 − ε3 ), (ε5 − ε3 )}

(20)

Matrices Sλ employed in Section 2.2 to define column-wise the corresponding stoichiometric
subspace (10) are of the form:

The dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, i.e. the rank of matrix S =

S1 S2



is s = 3,

hence δ = 5 − 2 − 3 ≡ 0. Thus the network is zero deficiency which means that no vector gr
other than the zero vector exist such that Sgr = 0. In other words, the kernel of S contains
only the null vector.
Atoms or functional groups A-C are not modified by reactions (16). In fact, their numbers
remains constant provided that reactions take place on a closed domain (i.e. no mass exchanges
with the environment occur). Let [A]0 , [B]0 and [C]0 be the concentrations on a closed and homogeneous domain of A, B and C, respectively. Mole-number balances result into the following
set of linear relations:

[A]0 = 2[A2 B] + [AC] + [AB] + [AC2 B]
[B]0 = [A2 B] + [AB] + [AC2 B] + [CB]
[C]0 = [AC] + [C] + 2[AC2 B] + [CB]

where brackets indicate chemical species concentrations. Previous relations can be written in
matrix form as follows:
T
2 1 1 0 1 0
B T (c − c0 ) = 0 with B =  1 0 1 0 1 1 
0 1 0 1 2 1


where c is the vector of chemical species concentrations and B T c0 the (constant) concentration
of functional groups/atoms. It must be noted that the above expression is employed in (14) to

11

characterize the set of compatibility classes (each of them a reaction simplex). As discussed in
Section 2.2, the columns of B defines a basis for the orthogonal complement to the stoichiometric
subspace.
An irreversible network
Let us consider the following set of irreversible reactions:
S + I → 2I
I⇆R→S

(21)

This network can be interpreted as an extension of the SIR epidemic model [33] which describes
the effect of a disease on a large population. Individuals on the population are classified either
as those susceptible to the disease (S), infected (I) or those recovered from disease (I). In this
extension, individuals under recovering may evolve either to those that again susceptible to the
disease or directly infected again. In the CRNT formalism it would be said that the network
would comprises three species with concentrations [S], [I] and [R], and 5 complexes numbered
as:
{C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 } ≡ {2I, S + I, S, R, I}
Graph structure is depicted in Figure 2. Molecularity matrix Y for this network reads:


0 1 1 0 0
Y = 2 1 0 0 1 
0 0 0 1 0

(22)

Stoichiometric matrices Sλ become:

Because both matrices are full rank, the dimension of Σ1 and Σ2 is s1 = 1 and s2 = 2, respec
tively. Thus δ1 = N1 − 1 − s1 = 0 and δ2 = N2 − 1 − s2 = 0. However matrix S = S1 S2

is rank deficient since vector S1 is aligned to the vector that makes the second column of S2 .

Consequently s = 2, and δ = 5 − 2 − 2 ≡ 1, verifying inequality (12). A basis in the kernel of S,
i.e. a non-zero vector gr that solves (13), results to be g1 = ( 1 0 1 )T .

For this network, the basis that spans the orthogonal complement to the stoichiometric subspace
becomes B = ( 1 1 1 )T . A representation of a compatibility class for the reaction network
considered is presented in Figure 3, with c = ([S], [I], [R])T . The reaction polyhedron Ω(c0 )
defines the region of non-negative concentrations (c  0) satisfying:
[S] + [I] + [R] = B T c0
with c0  0 being a constant vector.

Linkage classes, Graphs and Compartmental Matrices

The nature and properties of equilibrium solutions in chemical reaction networks (e.g stability
or not of equilibrium solutions, or the possibility of multiple equilibria) is at a large extent
conditioned by the graph structure of each linkage class and the properties of some matrices
associated to it which are known as compartmental matrices [34].
In this section we describe a graph which under some conditions reduces to the graph description
of a linkage class. Related to that graph and its associated matrix, an auxiliary dynamic system
will be constructed and its equilibrium studied in order to extract relevant properties of the
corresponding compartmental matrix.
A directed graph G = {(V

S

vE ), E} is constructed by a set of n + 1 vertices and edges. The

first set of vertices V = {v1 , v2 , . . . , vn }, with indexes L = {1, . . . , n} will be referred to as nodes,

13

while the remaining vertex vE will represent the ‘environment’. To any directed edge vi → vj
for i, j ∈ L and i 6= j in G (i.e. (vi , vj ) ∈ E) there corresponds a scalar weight Vji > 0. In
addition, for every i ∈ L, such that (vi , vE ) ∈ E or (vE , vi ) ∈ E, we associate scalars bi > 0
and ai > 0, respectively, which will be collected in (non-negative) vectors a, b ∈ Rn . As in the
description of linkage classes (Section 2) we will say that two nodes are strongly linked if they
can be reached from each other by directed paths. The largest set of strongly linked nodes (not
passing through the environment) in L from which there are not outgoing edges to other nodes
will define a strong terminal set we will refer to as Lp . Some examples of directed graphs are
illustrated in Figure 4.
We will only consider graphs with one strong terminal set, and define the set of non-terminal
nodes as Lq = L \ Lp . Graphs where all nodes plus the environment constitute a strong terminal
set will be referred to as weakly reversible graphs.
(a)

(b)

Figure 4: Some typical examples of directed graphs. (a) Exchange with the environment takes
place in the strong terminal set through input a(2) (second coordinate of vector a) and output
b(1) (first coordinate of vector b). Node Env represents the environment. (b) Input from the
environment enters the system through a non-terminal node (coordinate a(4) of vector a) while
the output to the environment leaves from a terminal node (coordinate b(1) of vector b).
For each node i = 1, . . . , n we define a state xi and a (internal) flux:
φi =

X

Vij xj − xi

X

Vki

(23)

k∈Li

(j/i∈Lj )

where as in Section 2, indexes that are directly reached from node i are grouped in set Li , and
(j/i ∈ Lj ) refers to nodes with edges directed to i. Fluxes to and from the environment will be
expressed by vectors β = Bx (with B = diag(b)) and a, respectively.
We consider that each state will change in time as a function of the net flux through it. Hence
its dynamics by the action of fluxes can be described as:
ẋ =

n
X

φi (x)(εi − ε1 ) − Bx + a

i=1

14

(24)

where the states of the system are collected in vector x ∈ Rn . Equation (24) can be written in
the alternative form:
ẋ = W x + a

(25)

where matrix W = V − B, and V ∈ Rn×n contains as elements the coefficients in (23) and has
diagonal elements of the form:
Vii = −

n
X

Vji

j=1
j 6= i
Both matrices V and W are compartmental [34] 3 , and belong to the class of Metzler matrices
[30]. It is known from e.g. [35], that the eigenvalues of a compartmental matrix are either
zero or they have negative real parts. Such conclusion can be also reached in a straightforward
manner from the structure of compartmental matrices applying column-wise the Gershgorim
disc theorem [36].
Proposition 3.1 Consider system (25) with a  0 and nonnegative initial conditions x(0) =
x0  0. Then x(t)  0 for every t > 0
Proof: In order to prove the statement all we need is to show that the flow associated to
the differential system on the boundary of the positive orthant will be either aligned to the
boundary or oriented to the interior of the set. Before we compute the flow let us define the
set Hk = {x  0 | εT
k x = 0} which characterizes the k facet of the positive orthant. The inner
product between the flow induced by (24) (equivalently (25)) on any element x ∈ Hk , and the
vector orthogonal to Hk takes the form:
εT
k ẋ = φk − bk xk + ak ≡

X

Vki xi + ak ≥ 0

(26)

(i/k∈Li )

where the equivalence at the right hand side holds since xk = 0 in Hk . Thus at the Hk boundary,
the flow associated to the differential system will be either aligned to the boundary (εT
k ẋ = 0) or
oriented to the interior of the set (i.e. εT
k ẋ > 0). Repeating the argument for all k will complete
the proof.



We will now show that the dynamic system will eventually evolve to zero as the unique equilibrium solution, provided that a = 0 and the non-zero components of vector b will coincide with
nodes in the terminal set (i.e nodes that belong to Lp ).

Figure 5: Example of a graph with a, b = 0 partitioned into a terminal set Lp and nonterminal
sets Lq1 Lq2 . In this case set Lℓ comprises nodes 2 and 4.
Let Lℓ ⊂ Lq be the set collecting those nodes in the non-terminal set that are directly linked to
the terminal one (the different partitions are illustrated in Figure 5), and define σp = ωpT x and
σq = ωqT x, where:
ωp =

With these preliminaries we are in a position to prove the following result:
Proposition 3.2 Consider system (25) with a = 0 and at least one positive entry, i ∈ Lp for
vector b. Then, for any x(0)  0, x∗ = 0 is the only equilibrium solution of (25).

Proof: Since x(0)  0 and a = 0, by Proposition 3.1 we have that x(t)  0, which implies that
the state will remain in the positive orthant, and σp and σq will be larger or equal than zero so
that σ = σq + σp ≥ 0.
For i ∈ Lq we have from (28) that σ̇q < 0 as long as there exists some xi > 0, but since σq
cannot become negative, the only equilibrium state for every i ∈ Lq will be x∗i = 0. In addition,
P
because σ̇ = − i∈Lp bi xi , with at least one bi > 0 and σ cannot become negative, the only
possible equilibrium states will correspond with x∗i = 0 for all i ∈ Lp . In summary, the only

equilibrium equals x(t) = x∗ ≡ 0, what completes the proof.

16



Proposition 3.3 Consider system (25) associated to a weakly reversible graph (i.e. a, b  0,
excluding zero vectors). Then, for any x(0)  0, there is exactly one strictly positive equilibrium
solution x∗ ≻ 0 for (25).

Proof: According to (24) we can describe the dynamics around each node as ẋi = φi (x) − bi xi +
ai . Suppose that xi ≡ x∗i = 0, then we have from the above equation that:
ẋi =

X

Vij xj + ai .

(j/i∈Lj )

Thus the system is not at equilibrium since ẋi > 0, unless xj = 0 for all j ∈ L and ai = 0. Since
there is at least one entry such that ai > 0, and according to Proposition 3.1, x∗ must be in the
positive concentration orthant, any equilibrium solution must be strictly positve, namely x∗ ≻ 0

Definition 3.1 We say that the matrix W ∈ Rn×n , associated to a directed graph G = {(V
is C-Metzler if its entries are of the form:
Wij ≥ 0

S

vE ), E}

for i 6= j
,

Wii = −(bi +

P

(30)

j6=i Wji ) with bi ≥ 0 and Wii < 0

provided that at least one bi associated to a terminal set (i.e. i ∈ Lp ) is positive.
Lemma 3.1 Any C-Metzler matrix W is non-singular and stable, and its inverse W −1 is nonpositive. If the set of nodes in L constitute a strongly terminal set, the inverse will be strictly
negative.

Proof: C-Metzler are a class of compartmental matrices. As shown elsewhere (e.g [35], Theorem
6.4.6 ) their eigenvalues are either zero or they have negative real parts (i.e. purely imaginary
eigenvalues or eigenvalues with positive real part are not possible). Thus it only remains to
prove that no zero eigenvalue exists.
To that purpose, we have that W in system (25) is C-Metzer provided that at least a positive
bi exists in the terminal set. If a = 0, the only equilibrium solution W x∗ = 0, according to
Proposition 3.2, will be x∗ = 0. Thus no eigenvector with zero eigenvalue exists what implies
that all eigenvalues are negative and therefore W is stable and invertible. This proves the first
part of the statement.
In order to show that a C-Metzler matrix inverse (W −1 ) is non-positive, we first note that
any equilibrium solution of (25) in the positive orthant satisfies that W x∗ = −a. Since W is
invertible we have that:
x∗ = −N a, with N = W −1 .

17

Let us choose a = εi , so that x∗ = −(N )i , where (N )i represents the i-column of N matrix.
According to Proposition 3.1, x∗  0 for any a  0, so that that (N )i  0, which means that the
entries of the i-column are non-positive. Repeating the argument for i = 1, . . . , n, we conclude
that all entries of N are either zero or negative. In addition, if the nodes in L are strongly
linked, Proposition 3.3 holds for all a = εi with i ∈ L and the equilibria is strictly positive so
that N will be a strictly negative matrix.



Some general consequences on the structure of matrix N = W −1 can be drawn from the above
result. Let us consider a graph having just one strong terminal set Lp with p nodes, and q
non-terminal nodes. Numbering the nodes so that the first p are in Lp , we can partition N as:


Np Npq
N=
,
(31)
∅
Nq

where sub-matrix Np ∈ Rp×p is strictly negative, since the rows/columns correspond with nodes
in the strong terminal set, while Npq ∈ Rp×q and Nq ∈ Rq×q are non-positive matrices. In
addition, if aT = (aTp , 0Tq ), with ap ∈ Rp and at least one element positive, and 0q ∈ Rq the zero
vector, then the first p entries of the solution x∗ = −N a will be positive, and zero the rest.
Example: Graph in Figure 4 depicts two different scenarios. In Figure 4a, input a2 enters a
node in the strong terminal set thus forcing the states x∗i in that set to be strictly positive, while
leaving those that belong to the non-terminal set to reach zero. Figure 4b, describes the case in
which the input enters a non-terminal node that communicates with the rest (non-terminal and
terminal) thus forcing the states to reach a strictly positive value.
From these observations we can conclude that if W is the C-Metzler matrix associated to this
graph, the sign patterns for the first two columns (N )1 and (N )2 of its corresponding inverse N
should be of the form ( − − 0 0 )T (Figure 4a). In addition we should expect for the 3rd
and 4th columns (Figure 4b) a sign pattern ( − − − − )T . Consequently, the sign pattern
of the negative inverse will be as follows:

A Canonical Representation of the Equilibrium Set

Expression (15) which describes the time evolution of the concentration vector can be re-written
in terms of the stoichiometric matrices discussed in Section 2.2 so that:
X
ċ =
Sλ φλ (ψ λ ),
λ

18

(32)

where φλ is a column vector that for each linkage class collects the fluxes present in (15). ψ λ
represents the vector of monomials associated to the linkage class, which possibly after some reordering will take the form ψ λ = (ψjλ , ψλT )T . Element-wise, these relate to fluxes by expression
(7) which in matrix form reads:
φλ (ψjλ , ψλ ) = Mkλ ψ λ ,

(33)

where Mkλ ∈ RNλ ×Nλ is a compartmental matrix that includes as entries the corresponding
reaction constants, and φλ = (φjλ , φTλ )T . Note that because of (8), Mkλ is a column conservation
matrix, which we can re-write as:
Mkλ

=



−(1T aλ ) bTλ
aλ
Eλ



,

(34)

with bTλ = −1T E λ . By construction, the first row in Mkλ corresponds to the reference complex
jλ which has been chosen to be in the terminal linkage class. Vectors aλ , bλ ∈ RNλ −1 contain as
elements the rate constants for reaction steps leaving and entering, respectively, the reference
complex. Hence, vector bλ is non-zero, i.e. at least one of the off-diagonal elements of Mkλ corresponding to the first row must be positive, since there is at least one reaction step directed to the
reference complex. The remaining rate constants are collected in matrix E λ ∈ R(Nλ −1)×(Nλ −1) .
Inspection of the representation (32) suggests that equilibrium solutions, namely those that
make ċ = 0, correspond with complex balance conditions, which require all fluxes φi to be
zero. Alternatively, non-zero flux combinations can lead to equilibrium, if the corresponding
flux vector lies in the kernel of S. Provided that the network has positive deficiency, such fluxes
can be written as linear combinations of the basis {grλ | r = 1, . . . , δ} as follows:
φλ =

X

χr grλ ,

(35)

r

where χr are scalars. That (35) leads in fact to an equilibrium solution can be easily verified by
substituting it into (32) and making use of (13).

Since rank(S) = 3, the network has deficiency δ = 1. Thus equilibrium solutions would correspond with fluxes satisfying relation (35) where grλ defines a one-dimensional subspace which in
T
this case corresponds with g = 1 0 1 0
.

In order to compute the set of equilibrium solutions, we substitute (35) into (33) and make use
of the structure of Mkλ (34) and (8) to get:

X

χr (1T grλ )

(38)

r

E λ ψλ + ψjλ aλ =

X

χr grλ .

(39)

r

Since we are interested in positive equilibrium solutions, let ψjλ > 0, and multiply both sides of
Eqn (39) by 1/ψjλ , to get after some re-arrangement:
E λ fλ + aλ = xλ Gλ χ

(40)

where xλ ∈ R, and matrix Gλ and vector χ are, respectively:
Gλ = [g1λ · · · grλ · · · gδλ ] and χ = (χ1 , . . . , χr , . . . , χδ )T .
The strictly positive vector fλ in (40) relates to the reaction monomials by the expression:


1
ψλ .
(41)
fλ = exp ln
ψjλ
Note that, provided that c ≻ 0, ψ λ relates to species concentration by means of expressions (3)
so that for each complex i ∈ Lλ \ jλ , we have that ln(ψi /ψjλ ) = (yi − yjλ )T ln c. Hence the
logarithm at the right hand side of (41) can be expressed as:
ln

1
ψλ = SλT ln c.
ψjλ

(42)

Without loss of generality we can select χ ∈ Rδ to be in the unit sphere (kχk = 1), and xλ in a
interval X(χ) ⊂ R, such that fλ remains a strictly positive vector.

20

In addition, we can re-write (38) as:
bTλ fλ = 1T (aλ − xλ Gλ χ) .

(43)

Definition 4.1 (Family of Solutions [17]) The set of positive vectors fλ that solve (40) for a
given χ and xλ , for every λ = 1, ..., ℓ (therefore satisfying (43)) constitutes the so-called family
of solutions
Note that because E λ is C-Metzler and according to Lemma 3.1, invertible, the family of solutions always exist. Such solutions implicitly depend on the rate constants of the reaction
network. Since E λ is invertible, we can define new vectors f∗λ and hrλ (for r = 1, · · · , δ) of the
form:
f∗λ = −(E λ )−1 aλ and hrλ = (E λ )−1 grλ , for every λ and r.

(44)

In particular, since (E λ )−1 is non-positive (see Lemma 3.1), f∗λ  0 for aλ  0. The same
Lemma leads to f∗λ ≻ 0 (a strictly positive vector), provided that the underlying graph is weakly
reversible. Substituting the above relations into (40), we get the family of solutions in explicit
form as:
fλ (xλ ; χ) = f∗λ + xλ hλ (χ) where hλ (χ) =

δ
X

hrλ χr

(45)

r=1

It must be noted that not all positive vectors defined by (45) will necessarily comply with
condition (42) but only a particular subset we will refer to as the set of feasible solutions. This
set will be formally characterized in the next subsection.

4.1

The set of feasible equilibrium solutions

Among all positive vectors fλ of the form (45) for every λ, we concentrate on those that are
consistent with relation (42). This implies that all vectors of the form ln fλ must lie in the image
of SλT , so that:
ln fλ = SλT ξ for λ = 1, ..., ℓ,

(46)

for some ξ ∈ Rm (ξ ≡ ln c). Let f be the vector that collects as subvectors the solutions fλ of
(40). Vector ln f must be in the range of S T , but since such range is orthogonal to the kernel of
S, the following holds:
(ln f)T gr = 0 for every r = 1, ..., δ.
Expanding these expressions by linkage classes we get the equivalent relations:
X

(grλ )T ln fλ (xλ ; χ) = 0 for every r = 1, ..., δ.

λ

21

(47)

In order to provide a formal characterization of feasible solutions we consider a vector kT =
(k1T , · · · , kλT , . . . , kℓT ) which collects, by linkage class, all reaction constants of the network. Each
vector kλ determines Mkλ (34) with its corresponding matrix E λ , and vectors aλ and bλ . Given
this, together with Gλ (which is related to the stoichiometric subspace) we get f∗λ and hrλ for
r = 1, . . . , δ and every λ, via relations in (44). The family of solutions is then characterized for
each unit vector χ and every λ, on intervals Xλ (χ) ⊂ R by functions fλ (xλ ; χ) : Xλ (χ) ⊂ R →
(Nλ −1)

R+

, being of the form given by expression (45).

In passing it is worth noting that for weakly reversible networks the zero is contained in all
intervals Xλ (χ), for every vector χ. This is the case since f∗λ ≻ 0 (Lemma 3.1), thus fλ (0; χ) ≻ 0.
Next we introduce a class of functions we will refer to as feasibility functions, that will help to
formalize feasibility of equilibrium solutions:
Definition 4.2 (Feasibility functions) Let F(x; χ′ , χ) : X × Rδ × Rδ → R be defined as:
F(x; χ′ , χ) = gT (χ′ ) ln f(x; χ)

(48)

where χ, χ′ ∈ Rδ are unit vectors4 , g(χ′ ) = Gχ′ , with G ∈ R(n−1)×δ , and f(x; χ) : X(χ) ⊂ R →
(n−1)

R+

being of the form:
f(x; χ) = f∗ + xh(χ) with h(χ) = E −1 Gχ,

(49)

with E ∈ R(n−1)×(n−1) C-Metzler, and f∗  0.

Based on this definition, feasibility conditions (47) can be re-written in terms of functions (48)
as follows:
Definition 4.3 (Feasibility equilibrium solutions) For a given chemical reaction network
with a parameter vector k, feasible equilibrium solutions are those which correspond to χ ∈ Rδ
in the unit sphere (kχk = 1) and xλ ∈ Xλ (χ) for λ = 1, . . . , ℓ such that:
X
Fλ (xλ ; εr , χ) = 0 for all r = 1, ..., δ.

(50)

λ

where εr ∈ Rδ denotes the usual unit vector.
We note that if χ∗ and x∗λ satisfy (50) we also get that

turn implies the following necessary condition:

Fλ (x∗λ ; χ∗ ) = 0, where Fλ (xλ ; χ) = gTλ (χ) ln fλ (xλ ; χ).

(51)

λ

As we will see in the next sections, feasibility functions Fλ (x; χ) will prove to be fundamental
to characterize the structure of equilibrium and conclude uniqueness in some instances.

whenever χ = χ′ , the short form F(x; χ) will be employed

In the same way, for χ2 = (0 1)T , X(χ2 ) ≡ (−1/2, +1). Because the logarithm is defined for

be observed that each vector leads to a different domain X(χ). Nonetheless since f∗ is strictly

It must be noted that the functions depicted in the above example are monotonous decreasing in

matter how many linkage classes a reaction network might have, or whether the network would
be weakly reversible or irreversible, and despite any particular stoichiometry their complexes
may exhibit. Next section provides a formal proof of this fact which will turn out to be central
to explore the nature of equilibrium solutions.

Monotonicity of feasibility functions

Here we study the domain and properties of feasibility functions (48) of the form F(x; χ) =
gT (χ) ln f(x; χ). In particular it will be shown that such functions are monotonous decreasing
on their domain, namely in the interval X(χ) where f(x; χ) remains positive. In the first place,
and without loss of generality let us write (49) for a given χ in the unit sphere as:
f(x) = f∗ + xh.

(55)

Provided that f∗ ≻ 0, the values of the scalar x for which the vector function f(x) will remain
strictly positive will depend on the signs of the entries in h. For every of such entries j define
pj = hj /f∗j and introduce two index sets I + and I − so that:
j ∈ I + , if hj > 0, thus pj > 0
j ∈ I − , if hj < 0, thus pj < 0

(56)

It is straightforward to see that f(x) will be strictly positive for every x in the open interval
X = (L− , L+ ), where L− = maxj∈I + {−1/pj } and L+ = minj∈I − {−1/pj }. Note that because
f∗ ≻ 0, the interval X includes the zero.
Let us consider a weakly reversible linkage class, and assume without loss of generality that the
components of h in (55) are ordered so that:
h1 ≥ · · · ≥ hk ≥ · · · ≥ hm > 0 > hm+r+1 ≥ · · · ≥ hℓ ≥ · · · ≥ hn−1
hm+1 = · · · = hm+r = 0

(57)

Note that such order can always be induced by a suitable row and column permutation in
equations g = Eh and Ef∗ = −a. Making use of (56), we have that I + = {1, · · · , m}, I − =
{m + r + 1, · · · , n − 1}, and the domain X = (L− , L+ ) becomes:
L− = maxj∈I + {−f∗j /hj } and L+ = minj∈I − {−f∗j /hj }

(58)

Note that L− = −∞ (respectively L+ = +∞) provided that I + = ∅ (respectively I − = ∅).
Associated to f(x) we have the corresponding to function (48) for χ′ = χ, which can be written
as:
F(x) = gT ln f(x),

(59)

where g = Eh and E is a C-Metzler matrix with entries of the form (30). The main result on
monotonicity is now presented in the Theorem below.

25

Theorem 5.1 Consider the function F(x) : X ⊂ R 7→ R defined in (59). F(x) is monotonous
decreasing on the domain X. Moreover,
lim F (x) = −∞ and

x→L+

lim F (x) = +∞

x→L−

(60)

Proof: Function (59) is well defined in the domain X since f(x) is strictly positive, thus the first
part of the proof reduces to computing the first derivative with respect to x ∈ X and studying
its sign over the domain. We start by defining for every entry j of vectors h and f∗ a relation
pj = hj /f∗j , and re-writing h as:
h = D(f∗ )p,

(61)

where D represents a diagonal matrix with elements from f∗ in the diagonal. Let us also re-order
the pj elements so that:
p1 ≥ · · · ≥ pk ≥ · · · ≥ pm > 0 > pm+r+1 ≥ · · · ≥ pℓ ≥ · · · ≥ pn−1
pm+1 = · · · = pm+r = 0

(62)

where the number of positive, negative an zero elements must coincide with those in (57),
although not necessarily in the same order. For all nonzero pj define functions Qj (x) : X 7→ R:
Qj (x) =

pj
1 + xpj

(63)

For every pj > 0 and x ∈ X (see relations (56)), x > −(1/pj ), so that x + (1/pj ) > 0, thus:
Qj (x) ≡

1
>0
x + (1/pj )

Using the same argument for pj < 0 we have that Qj (x) < 0. In addition, for any pi ≥ pj , both
different from zero, we have that Qi (x) ≥ Qj (x). Consequently, from (62), for every x ∈ X we
get that:
Q1 (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qk (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qm (x) > 0 > Qm+r+1 (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qℓ (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qn−1 (x)
Qm+1 (x) = · · · = Qm+r (x) = 0

(64)

Keeping the order established in (62) for the indexes j, the first derivative can be written as:
′

F (x) =

n−1
X
j=1

gj hj
,
fj (x)

(65)

where gj is the j coordinate of vector g = Eh. The derivative is well defined on X since fj > 0
for every j and x ∈ X. Moreover, by dividing every term in the summation by f∗j and using
pj = hj /f∗j , we re-write (66) as:
′

F (x) =

n−1
X

gj Qj (x),

(66)

j=1

with functions Qj (x) as in (63). A matrix H ∈ R(n−1)×(n−1) is defined as:
H = ED(f∗ )

26

(67)

which by construction is C-Metzler. By means of H we re-write Ef∗ = −a and g = Eh,
respectively as:
H1 = −a and g = Hp

(68)

where (61) has been used. Because H is C-Metzler, and the relations (64) and (68) hold, we
are under the conditions of Lemmas A.1 and A.2 in Appendix A. In particular the right hand
side of (66) has the same structure as G(x) in Lemma A.2. Consequently, the first derivative is
strictly negative on the domain X and the result follows.
In order to show (60), we note that fj (x) ≡ f∗j (1 + xpj ), and re-write (59) as:
F(x) ≡

where Πj (x) = ln(1 + xpj ). The first term on the right hand side is constant while the second
term can be expanded as in (A.14) (proof of Lemma A.2) with Πj (x) instead of Qj (x). The
expression becomes:
F (x) =

where Πi − Πj ≡ ln [(1 + xpi )/(1 + xpj )]. Three possible scenarios are considered depending on
the signs of the p entries:
1. All entries are positive or zero, so that m + r = n. In this case the domain X = (−1/p1 , +∞)
and the following limits hold:
lim (Πk − Πk+1 ) = 0

x→+∞

lim (Πk − Πk+1 ) = constant if − 1/pk+1 ≤ −1/pk < −1/p1

2. All entries are negative or zero so that m = 0, the domain X = (−∞, −1/pn−1 ) and the
following limits hold:
lim (Πℓ − Πℓ+1 ) = 0

x→−∞

lim

(Πℓ − Πℓ+1 ) = constant if − 1/pn−1 < −1/pℓ+1 ≤ −1/pℓ

lim

Πr+1 = −∞ and

lim Πr+1 = +∞

x→−∞

3. There are both, positive, zero or negative entries so the domain becomes X = (−1/p1 , −1/pn−1 )
In all three scenarios, substitution of the corresponding limits and use of Lemma A.1 leads to

Irreversible networks

Previous results can be extended to irreversible linkage classes, provided that a positive equilibrium solution exits. The main difference however lies in that the interval X does not contain the
zero. The essential arguments behind can be found in Lemma 3.1, and the structure of inverses
of C-Metzler matrices.
Consider a linkage class with n complexes to be split into a strongly terminal linkage class Lp
with p complexes and a non-terminal set Lq with q complexes, so that L = Lp ∪ Lq . Without
loss of generality, assume that complexes in the linkage class are ordered so that the associated
C-Metzler matrix E will be written as:
E=



Ep Epq
∅
Eq



,

(71)

where Ep ∈ Rp×p , Eq ∈ Rq×q , and Epq ∈ Rp×q . As before, feasible solutions, f(x) : X ⊂ R 7→
(n−1)

R+

can be written as:
f(x) = f∗ + xh with f∗  0,

(72)

where f∗ = −E −1 a, and h = E −1 g. Because the reference complex belongs to Lp , the coordinates of vector a that correspond to non-terminal complexes are zero, what together with the
expression for the inverse of a C-Metzler matrix, and particularly with the expression (31) leads
to a vector f∗ with zero components at the location of non-terminal complexes. In fact we can
write f∗ T = [f∗p T , 0Tq ], where 0q denotes a q-dimensional column vector of zeros. Vector f∗p , which
corresponds to the terminal linkage class, is strictly positive. In addition, let hT = [hTp , hTq ], and
re-write (72) as:
fp (x) = f∗p + xhp
fq (x) = 0q + xhq

(73)

Since f∗p is strictly positive, there exists some domain Xp that includes the zero, for which
+
−
+
fp (x) ≻ 0. Let Xp = X−
p ∪ Xp ∪ {0}, where Xp and Xp contain all negative and positive values,

respectively. It is then straightforward to see from (73) that in order for fq (x) ≻ 0, hq must have
a definite sign (i.e. all components either positive or negative). If this is the case, i.e. if hq ≻ 0
−
(respectively ≺ 0), we can always find some x ∈ X+
p (respectively x ∈ Xp ), so that f(x) ≻ 0.

Otherwise, no positive solution will exist.

28

As we will show, the feasibility function (59) is still monotonous decreasing on its domain for
irreversible linkage classes, provided that a positive feasible solution exists. To show this, we first
notice that because f∗q = 0q and x ∈ X\{0}, the summation in (66), extended to non-terminal
complexes in Lq , becomes:
X

j∈Lq

1T gq
1 X
gj hj
gj =
,
≡
f∗j + xhj
x
x
j∈Lq

where gq = Eq hq . But the right hand side of the above expression is negative, since by con−
struction positive solutions require hq ≻ 0 (respectively ≺ 0) for x ∈ X+
p (respectively x ∈ Xp ).

Thus 1T Eq hq ≤ 0 (respectively ≥ 0). Consequently F′ (x) < 0 and Theorem 5.1 applies.
Example: Let us consider the irreversible network represented in Figure 9. For this network
matrix E and vectors a and b in (34) take the form:

Some network classes with unique equilibrium solutions

Chemical reaction network structure with its associated C-Metzler matrices shapes the set of
feasible equilibrium solutions, that we compute via the feasibility functions given in Definition
4.2. In this section we exploit monotonicity of such functions to conclude whether or not
equilibria is unique over compatibility classes.
In particular we will show that under a complex balance condition, no other equilibrium solution
is compatible with the complex balance one in each compatibility class. Complex balance solutions are only possible for a given set of reaction rate constants we will refer to as the Horn set,
following a previous contribution [28]. For the sake of completeness, a formal characterization
of the set will be given together with some remarks on uniqueness and stability of the resulting
equilibria. Finally, conditions for one particular class of non-complex balance equilibrium to be
unique will be discussed. Such conditions constitute the basis for an alternative proof of the
so-called deficiency one theorem [13].
Let us consider a weakly reversible network with ℓ linkage classes, a vector of reaction rate
constants k and deficiency δ. According to Definition 4.1, the family of solutions in each linkage
class λ reads as in (45), for every χ in the unit circle, with:
hλ (χ) = (E λ )−1 gλ (χ) and gλ (χ) = Gλ χ
Since each linkage class is weakly reversible, Proposition 3.3 and Lemma 3.1 applies and f∗λ ≻ 0
for every λ = 1, ..., ℓ. Furthermore, intervals Xλ (χ), which are constructed as shown in Section
5, contain the zero for every χ vector.
Vectors f∗λ and hλ in expression (45) are functions of the reaction rate constants. In fact,
let us suppose that for a vector k, there exists a complex balance solution, namely a feasible
fλ (0) = f∗λ (k) for every λ. This requires f∗T = ( f∗T
1

30

· · · f∗T
λ

· · · f∗T
ℓ ) to be in the range of

SλT , and motivates the definition of the Horn set as that which collects all possible reaction rate
constants that lead to complex balance solutions. Formally, the set is defined as:
H(k) = {k > 0 | ln f∗ (k) ∈ Range(S T )}.

(75)

Remark 6.1 If the network is non weakly reversible, some entries in each of the vectors f∗λ will
be zero, thus such networks cannot accept complex balance solutions.
Proposition 6.1 (Complex Balance Solutions) Any weakly reversible reaction network with
parameters in H(k) will only accept complex balance solutions. Complex balance solutions are
unique in each compatibility class, and stable.
Proof: We first prove that for any k ∈ H, the family of solutions fλ (0; χ) = f∗λ (k) for every λ is
feasible , i.e. they satisfy conditions of Definition 4.3. In that purpose we note that each term
in the summation (50) becomes of the form:
Fλ (0; εr , χ) ≡

gTλ (χ) ln f∗λ (k)

with gλ (χ) =

δ
X

χr grλ

r=1

By construction ln fλ (for every λ) is in the range of SλT so it is orthogonal to the kernel of Sλ .
Hence (ln f∗λ )T grλ = 0 for any r and λ, Fλ (0; εr , χ) = 0 and conditions (50) and (51) hold for
xλ = 0 and every vector χ and λ.
In addition, by Theorem 5.1 we have that each term Fλ (xλ , χ) in summation (51) is monotonous
decreasing in xλ , so that for each interval Xλ we have:
P

λ (χ) and λ = 1, . . . , ℓ

where X−
λ and Xλ are the negative and positive subintervals, respectively, so that Xλ = Xλ ∪

{0} ∪ X+
λ . Since this holds for every χ, no feasible solutions other than the complex balance can
be expected.
In order to prove uniqueness in each compatibility class, we note that by using (41) we can write
the complex balance solution as ln f∗ = S T ln c. Suppose that c1 and c2 are two concentration
vectors that are compatible with the same f∗ so that S T (ln c1 − ln c2 ) = 0. By Proposition B.1
both solutions cannot belong to the same compatibility class which proves uniqueness. Finally,
stability of complex balance solutions follows from Proposition B.2 in Appendix B.



The above result can be considered an alternative version of the one given by [29] on the existence
of complex balance solutions for weakly reversible reactions. In passing we remark that zero
deficiency reaction networks, if weakly reversible, will only accept a family of solutions satisfying

31

f∗ = S T ln c. Since δ = 0, the subspace defined by the columns of S T (Range(S T )) will span
all the complex space what in turn implies that any vector k will be an element of the Horn
set (75). In addition, it is straightforward to conclude from the arguments in the proof we
just presented that any solution will be unique (one per compatibility class) and stable. If the
network is irreversible positive solutions are not expected to be found. Such conclusions have
been presented in the form of a theorem known in CRNT as the zero deficiency theorem [12].
Example: The Horn set for a weakly reversible reaction Let us consider the example
presented in Section 4.2 of a deficiency δ = 2 network. The corresponding graph structure,
including stoichiometry and the set of possible parameters is depicted in Figure 7. For this
2-parameter network, and following expression (75) the Horn set is obtained by finding those
(ǫ, β) so that ln f∗ is orthogonal to g1 and g2 . This is equivalent to ln f∗ lying in Range(S T ),
which can be written as:




ǫ/β
1 0 −2
ln  1  = 0.
(76)
0 1 −3
ǫ/β
The above condition holds for parameters on the Horn set described as α = β. Then, by




construction ln f(0; χ) = 0 for every χ, so that F(0; χ) = 0. Since F(x; χ) is monotonous
decreasing, only complex balance solutions exist for parameters in the Horn set.

△

Remark 6.2 If the network is compatible with thermodynamics, meaning reversible with a detailed balance solution (note that this implicitly requires the system to be closed), any allowed
reaction constant for the network must be in H(k). In this way, the definition of the Horn
set can be considered as an alternative statement of the Wegsheider conditions (see [22] for a
classical statement of the conditions)
Next we present a result that can be interpreted as an alternative proof of the deficiency one theorem originally proposed by [13] and recently by [31], both employing diverse graph theoretical
formalisms. The conditions behind are simple and can be phrased as follows:
In order for the theorem to hold, a basis in the kernel of S must have at most one vector gr per
linage class. In addition, the only possible nonzero coordinates for each of those vectors must
be at the location of the complexes that correspond to the linkage class the vector is associated
to. Formally, this last condition can be expressed as:
(gi )T ωj = δij
where ωj are the characteristic functions of a linkage class (1), and δij the Kronecker delta. The
structure of the vectors is illustrated in Figure 10 for a network consisting of 3 linkage classes,
with the grey areas representing the non-zero vector coordinates.
As sketched in the same figure, such particular structure for the gr vectors makes the corresponding feasibility conditions (Definition 4.3) to be decoupled along linkage classes thus leading

32

to one particular x∗λ solution per linkage class.

Figure 10: The underlying condition behind the deficiency one theorem requires vectors grλ in
the basis of the kernel of S to be as depicted, where the grey areas indicate the only possible
non-zero coordinates. This structure decouples feasibility conditions (at most one per linkage
class). Monotonicity of Fλ (xλ ) schematically represented as discontinuous lines at the right of
the figure then leads to just one solution per linkage class.
Proposition 6.2 [Deficiency One Theorem] Let us consider a weakly reversible reaction netP
work with ℓ linkage classes such that δ = λ δλ , where δλ is either 0 or 1. Then there will be a
unique equilibrium in each compatibility class.

Proof: From the assumptions, in order for each linkage class to have at most deficiency one
δ ≤ ℓ, otherwise there will exists at least one linkage class with more than one vector grλ 6= 0.
Since each linkage class λ will contribute to the network deficiency with one vector gr at most,
we will have that grλ 6= 0 and grk = 0 for every k 6= λ (i.e. the remaining ℓ − 1 sub-vectors will
be zero) and r ≤ min(δ, ℓ) ≤ ℓ. For this particular set of vectors, equation (49) for any χ in the
unit circle becomes fλ (x; χ) = f∗λ + xλ hλ with hλ = (E λ )−1 grλ , and r ≤ min(δ, ℓ). On the other
hand, condition (50) reduces to just one term in each summation, so that:
Fλ (xλ ) = 0 for λ = 1, . . . , min(δ, ℓ) with Fλ (xλ ) = (gλr ))T ln fλ (xλ )
According to Theorem 5.1, each function Fλ (xλ ) is monotonous decreasing and because of (60),
it becomes zero at a point x̃λ ∈ Xλ . Moreover, there exists a unique feasible solution fλ (x̃λ ) for
each linkage class λ. Combining the solution for each linkage class and using Eqn (46), we get
that S T ξ = ln f̃, with ξ ≡ ln c. Uniqueness then follows by applying Proposition B.1



As a final remark, we note that this result allows us to conclude uniqueness (although not
stability) of equilibria for networks with deficiency other than zero under a quite particular
condition that we can express as follows:
The number of linkage classes in the network cannot exceed the deficiency of the network,

33

otherwise we would find at least two gr 6= 0 associated to the same linkage class, what would
preclude decoupling of the feasibility conditions (4.3) along linkage classes.

The dimension of the stoichiometric subspace, which coincides with the rank of matrix S =

The set of equilibrium concentrations is then computed by solving ln f = S T ln c. In particular
for this network we can express the first 6 chemical species in terms of species G what leads
to a straight line in the ln c-space, which intersects any compatibility class defined in (14) with

Conclusions

In this paper a canonical representation of the set of feasible equilibrium solutions for weakly
reversible reaction networks is given. The characterization is made in terms of a class of stable
Metzler matrices which are employed to define the family of solutions. Feasibility is imposed
by a set of constraints, that relate to the kernel of the stoichiometric subspace. A particularly
interesting class of monotonous functions can be linked to such constraints which turn out to
be critical to conclude uniqueness in a class of deficiency one networks. They are in fact central
for a constructive proof of the deficiency one theorem as well as to the characterization of the
set which defines in the parameter space, the region of complex balance solutions (Horn set).
Future directions may involve detection or design of networks having multiple equilibria.

Two Lemmas required to prove monotonicity

The following results relate directly to the properties of C-Metzler matrices.
Lemma A.1 Let H ∈ Rn×n be C-Metzler and such that
H1 = −a,

(A.1)

with a  0. Let p 6= 0 be a vector with components satisfying:
p1 ≥ · · · ≥ pk ≥ · · · ≥ pm > 0 > pm+r+1 ≥ · · · ≥ pℓ ≥ · · · ≥ pn
pm+1 = · · · = pm+r = 0

(A.2)

g = Hp

and

Then:

gj ≤ 0 for every

1≤k≤m

m+r+1≤ℓ≤n

(A.5)

and

n

gj ≥ 0 for every

j=ℓ

Moreover:

m

n
X

gj < 0 and

gj > 0

(A.6)

j=m+r+1

j=1

Proof: Multiplying both sides of (A.1) by the scalar pk > 0 and subtracting the result from
(A.3) we get:
H(p − pk 1) = g + pk a

(A.7)

Summing the first k elements and reordering terms results in:

gj =

i=1

j=1

i=1 j=k+1

(A.8)

j=1

The first term at the RHS is non-positive since by construction pi − pk ≥ 0 for i = 1, · · · , k − 1,
and H is C-Metzler. In addition, for any sub-matrix containing the first k rows and k columns
of H is also C-Metzler and for any 0 < k < n we have that:
k
X

Hji ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , k

j=1

The second and third terms respectively are also non-positive: since Hij ≥ 0 for every i 6= j and
pj − pk ≤ 0 for j = k + 1, · · · , n, and because a is a nonnegative vector. Thus, relation (A.4)
follows.

41

In a similar way we prove (A.5). Substituting pℓ < 0 for pk in (A.7), we get:
H(p − pℓ 1) = g + pℓ a.

(A.9)

Summing the elements of g from ℓ to n gives



j=ℓ

i=ℓ+1

i=ℓ j=1

j=ℓ

(A.10)

j=ℓ

The first term on the RHS of (A.10) is non-negative, since (pi − pℓ ) ≤ 0 for i = ℓ + 1, . . . , n.

Because of the C-Metzler property of H we have that:
n
X

Hji ≤ 0, for any i = ℓ + 1, . . . , n

j=ℓ

The second term in (A.9) is again non-negative, since the off-diagonal elements of H are nonnegative and (pj − pℓ ) ≥ 0 for j = 1, . . . , ℓ − 1. Finally, the last term in (A.10) is trivially
non-negative due to the negativity of pℓ and the non-negativity of a.
In order to prove inequalities (A.6) we note that H, which is invertible, must satisfy (A.1).
This requires a to be non-zero, otherwise 1 would be in the kernel of H what would lead to a
contradiction. Let us express H as:
H=



H11 H12
H21 H22



,

(A.11)

where H11 ∈ Rm×m and H22 ∈ R(n−m)×(n−m) have strictly negative diagonal elements, and
H12 ∈ Rm×(n−m) are H21 ∈ R(n−m)×m are non-negative (their elements are either positive or
zero).
Suppose that the first m coordinates of the vector a are zero, then in order for H to be C-Metzler
and satisfy (A.1), H12 must have at least one positive entry. We show this by noting that:
H11 1m + H12 1n−m = 0.
If H12 = 0 that would imply H11 1m = 0. In other words, H11 would be singular, since 1m would
be an eigenvector with zero eigenvalue.
On the other hand, because H is C-Metzler all its eigenvalues are negative, and the matrix lower
block diagonal, since H12 = 0. But this implies that none of the eigenvalues of H11 and H22
can be zero, what is in contradiction with H12 = 0. Therefore, at least one entry of H12 must
be positive, and this makes the second term on the right hand side of (A.8) for k = m, strictly
positive, i.e.:

m

gj < 0

The same argument extended to the negative case will prove that

Lemma A.2 Let us consider the function G(x) : X ⊂ R 7→ R defined as:
G(x) =

n
X

gi Qi (x)

(A.12)

i=1

where gi are the coordinates of the vector g = Hp with H and p as in Lemma A.1. For every
i = 1, · · · , n and x ∈ X let also have that:
Q1 (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qk (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qm (x) > 0 > Qm+r+1 (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qℓ (x) ≥ · · · ≥ Qn (x)
Qm+1 (x) = · · · = Qm+r (x) = 0.

(A.13)

Then G(x) < 0 for every x ∈ X.

Proof: First we note that (A.12) can be re-written as:
G(x) = (Q1 − Q2 )g1 + (Q2 − Q3 )(g1 + g2 ) + · · · + (Qk − Qk+1 )

k

j=1

(A.14)

j=ℓ

where implicitly each Qi is assumed to be a function of x. From (A.13) we have that Qi (x) −
Qj (x) ≥ 0 for every Qi (x) ≥ Qj (x) and x ∈ X, what implies that (Qk − Qk+1 ) ≥ 0 for every
k = 1, . . . , m − 1 and (Qℓ − Qℓ−1 ) ≤ 0 for every ℓ = m + r + 1, . . . , n. Thus from Lemma A.1 we
have that:
G(x) ≤ Qm (x)

m

The signs Qm (x) > 0, Qm+r+1 < 0 as well as inequalities (A.6) from Lemma A.1 make the RHS

Some convenient results on uniqueness and stability

Lemma B.1 ([37]) Let V (x) : X → R, with X ⊆ Rn its domain, a convex function with
continuous derivatives on X, and ν(x) : X → Rn be the gradient of V (x). Then the following
inequalities hold for every x ∈ X:

43

(i) ν T (x1 )(x − x1 ) ≤ V (x) − V (x1 ) for any x1 ∈ X.
(ii) [ν(x2 ) − ν(x1 )]T (x2 − x1 ) ≥ 0 for any x1 , x2 ∈ X.

inequalities are strict whenever x 6= x1 or x1 6= x2 in (i) and (ii), respectively.
Proof: In order to prove the first part choose any x1 ∈ X and construct a function B1 (x; x1 ) as
the difference between V (x) and its supporting hyperplane at x1 . The supporting hyperplane is
of the form:
H(x; x1 ) = V (x1 ) + ν T (x1 )(x − x1 ), and B1 (x; x1 ) = V (x) − H(x; x1 )
By construction the function is strictly positive, i.e. it is positive for all x ∈ X other than x1 , so
the result (i) follows in a straightforward manner since:
B1 (x; x1 ) ≡ V (x) − V (x1 ) − ν T (x1 )(x − x1 ) ≥ 0, so that V (x) − V (x1 ) ≥ ν T (x1 )(x − x1 )
To prove the second part, we note that B1 (x; x1 ) is itself a convex function since ∇x B1 =
ν(x) − ν(x1 ) so its hessian coincides with that of the convex function V (x). By using the same
supporting hyperplane argument we construct the following strictly positive definite function
around some x2 ∈ X:
B2 (x; x1 , x2 ) ≡ B1 (x; x1 ) − B1 (x2 ; x1 ) − [ν(x2 ) − ν(x1 )]T (x − x2 ) ≥ 0
where the inequality holds for any x ∈ X. In particular it holds for x = x1 , thus:
B1 (x2 ; x1 ) + [ν(x2 ) − ν(x1 )]T (x1 − x2 ) ≤ 0
which implies that B1 (x2 ; x1 ) ≤ [ν(x2 ) − ν(x1 )]T (x2 − x1 ), and the assertion is in this way
proved.

Proposition B.1 The set U (c0 ) = {c ∈ Rm | c, c0  0, S T (ln c − ln c0 ) = 0}, contains just
one element in each compatibility class.

Proof: Suppose that there are two elements U (c0 ) that belong to the same compatibility class.
Because c∗ , c∗∗ ∈ U (c0 ) we have that SλT (ln c∗ − ln c∗∗ ) = 0. This implies that (ln c∗ − ln c∗∗ ) is
orthogonal to the stoichiometric subspace Σ. On the other hand, since c∗ and c∗∗ are assumed
to be in the same compatibility class, c∗ − c∗∗ belong to the stoichiometric subspace Σ. Then
we have that:
(ln c∗ − ln c∗∗ )T (c∗ − c∗∗ ) = 0

But according to Lemma B.1, condition (ii) with a convex function candidate V (c) = cT (ln c−1),
for equality (B.1) to be satisfied c∗ = c∗∗ . Consequently there is only one element in each
compatibility class.

Proposition B.2 Complex balance solutions are locally asymptotically stable.

Proof: First of all, let us make use of (6) to write the right hand side of (5) as a summation
over λ of functions:
Rλ (c) =

X

ψi (c)

kij · (yj − yi )

i∈Lλ

Select some positive reference c∗ > 0 (its associated vector ψ ∗ is strictly positive) and re-write
the previous expression in the equivalent form:
Rλ (c) =

X

Tν

X

eyi

i∈Lλ

ψi∗ kij · (yj − yi )

(B.3)

j∈Ii

where ν = ln c − ln c∗ . The inner product between ν and Rλ (c) (B.3) results into the following
scalar function:
ν T Rλ (c) =

X

ezi

X

ψi∗ kij · (zj − zi )

(B.4)

j∈Ii

i∈Lλ

where zi = yiT ν. An upper bound for (B.4) can be established from Lemma B.1 with V (z) =
ez : R → R so that:
ezi (zj − zi ) ≤ ezj − ezi

(B.5)

For any scalars zi and zj . Strict convexity of V (z) ensures that the equality holds only if zi = zj .
We also have that:
ezj − ezi = (εj − εi )T

Where we recall once again that the equality holds if and only if zi = zj for every i, j ∈ Lλ . A
Lyapunov function candidate is constructed as in the proof of Lemma B.1:
B(c; c∗ ) = V (c) − V (c∗ ) − ν T (c∗ )(c − c∗ ) ≥ 0
where the convex function V (c) is of the form:
