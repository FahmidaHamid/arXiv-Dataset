Experimental evidences show that in gene transcription, RNA polymerase has the possibility to be
stalled at certain position of the transcription template. This may be due to the template damage,

or protein barriers. Once stalled, polymerase may backtrack along the template to the previous
nucleotide to wait for the repair of the damaged site, or simply bypass the barrier or damaged site
and consequently synthesize an incorrect messenger RNA, or degrade and detach from the template. Thus, the effective transcription rate (the rate to synthesize correct product mRNA) and the
transcription effectiveness (the ratio of the effective transcription rate to the effective transcription
initiation rate) are both influenced by polymerase stalling events. So far, no theoretical model has
been given to discuss the gene transcription process including polymerase stalling. In this study,
based on the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), the transcription process including polymerase stalling is analyzed theoretically. The dependence of the effective transcription rate,
effective transcription initiation rate, and transcription effectiveness on the transcription initiation
rate, termination rate, as well as the backtracking rate, bypass rate, and detachment (degradation)
rate when stalling, will be discussed in detail. The results showed that backtracking restart after
polymerase stalling is an ideal mechanism to increase both the effective transcription rate and transcription effectiveness. Without backtracking, detachment of stalled polymerase can also help to
increase the effective transcription rate and transcription effectiveness. Generally, the increase of
bypass rate of the stalled polymerase will lead to the decrease of the effective transcription rate and
transcription effectiveness. But when both detachment rate and backtracking rate of the stalled
polymerase vanish, the effective transcription rate may also be increased by the bypass mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

Replication, transcription, and translation are three basic processes in cells. Before cell division, a cell replicates
its DNA with the help of DNA polymerase. Using DNA as a template, messenger RNA (mRNA) is synthesized
by RNA polymerase (RNAP) during the so-called transcription process. Then using mRNA as a template, peptide
chain is synthesized by ribosome during the translation process, and proteins are then obtained by the folding of
peptide chains. Roughly speaking, each of the three processes includes three subprocesses, initiation, elongation, and
termination. The product is synthesized by polymerase during its forward motion along template in the elongation
process.

In the field of theoretical studies, transcription process is usually described by the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion processes (TASEP), see [1–6]. In which RNAP is regarded as a point particle, and the template DNA is
regarded as a one-dimensional lattice with lattice sites corresponding to the nucleotides in DNA. The transcription
initiation corresponds to the binding of RNAP to the first lattice site, where the first site can be regarded as a
combination of the promoter and the transcription start site. The transcription termination corresponds to the
leaving of particle from the last site of the lattice. The elongation of transcription is described by the forward hopping
of particle in the main body of the lattice. The totally asymmetric exclusion means that the polymerase at site
i can only hopping forward to site i + 1 provided the site i + 1 is not occupied. In TASEP, the forward hopping
rates of particle at any site i of the lattice are always assumed to be the same and simply normalized to be 1. It
implies that RNAP will move along DNA template with constant speed until the termination site. However, several
experimental observations found that the regular elongation procedure may be interrupted, with RNAP stalled at
certain nucleotide. The stalling of RNAP may be caused by several reasons. Structural aberrations of the template
can trigger a stalling of polymerase [7–9]. Polymerase may also be stalled from the depletion of building blocks NTP
[10], or from the template damage [11–16]. Meanwhile, the damage or incorrect assembling of polymerase itself may
also lead to stalling [17].
In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, there are several mechanisms which are usually employed by polymerase
to solve the stalling problem. If the stalling is caused by template damage, polymerase may backtrack along the
template to the previous site and wait for the repair of the damaged site [18–25]. The synthesis of mRNA is able
to restart after the repair. Alternatively, the stalled polymerase may simply bypass the damaged site and continue
the transcription process from the downstream site, and finally end the transcription at the termination site with an
incorrect product [16, 19–21, 26, 27]. Meanwhile, if a prolonged stalling occurs, the polymerase may be degraded
as a mechanism of last resort [28]. By the way, in translation process, recent experiments have also found that the
template (mRNA) can degrade when the translocation of ribosome is stalled [29–32].
The polymerase stalling as well as the possible mechanisms employed by the stalled polymerase will affect the
overall transcription rate and efficiency, and consequently have influence on the strength of gene expression. Thus,
the related properties of transcription are not only determined by the initiation rate and termination rate as implied
in the usual TASEP model, but also influenced by the polymerase stalling and corresponding mechanisms used to
overcome the stalling problem. Although there are various kinds of generalizations of TASEP model, no one can be
used directly to describe the gene transcription process with polymerase stalling.
In this study, a modified TASEP model is presented to describe the gene transcription process including polymerase
stalling. For simplicity, this study assumes that there is only one nucleotide in the transcription template at which
polymerase may be stalled, and the position of this nucleotide is unchanged for any polymerase. This nucleotide
may be damaged, or bound by protein complexes, or there is one special secondary structure around it. The stalled
polymerase may backtrack along template to the previous binding site to wait for the repair of the damaged site (or
clearance of the barrier), or simply bypass this nucleotide and synthesize an incorrect mRNA product, or degrade
and detach from the transcription template, see Fig. 1. The numerical calculations of our modified TASEP model
show that, the effective transcription rate may be enlarged by increasing the backtracking rate, detachment rate, and
bypass rate of the stalled polymerase. Even the transcription effectiveness may be increased with the backtracking
and detachment rates. Generally, backtracking is one ideal mechanism to solve the polymerase stalling problem.

FIG. 1:

(a) Modified TASEP model to describe gene transcription process with possible polymerase stalling at site l.

Transcription starts with polymerase binding to the first site 0 (with the rate denoted by α), and terminated at the last site
N with rate denoted by β. At site l, the forward translocation of polymerase may be stalled. There are three mechanisms for
a stalled polymerase to leave the damaged site l, backtracking to site l − 1 with rate kb , degrading and detaching from the
template with rate kd , or just bypassing the site l with rate kbp and continuing its translocation along the template (but the
mRNA synthesized by it is incorrect and will degrade soon). During transcription elongation period, the forward stepping rate
of polymerase is denoted by kE , which is assumed to be the same throughout the transcription, for polymerases in whatever
states (correct or incorrect). (b) Notations for probabilities of finding polymerase at corresponding states, with correctly
transcribed mRNA (pi ), incorrectly transcribed mRNA (qi ), and backtracked polymerase at site l − 1 (p′l−1 ). (c) Notations for
probabilities related to site l, which may be damaged with or without polymerase binding.

Without backtracking, detachment and bypass are also good mechanisms to increase the effective transcription rate.
This study is organized as follows. The modified TASEP model describing the transcription process including
polymerase stalling will be presented in the next section, and then the results obtained by this model will be given in
Section III. Finally, concluding remarks will be presented in the last section.

II.

MODIFIED TASEP MODEL FOR GENE TRANSCRIPTION WITH POLYMERASE STALLING

The model used in this study can be regarded as a modification of the usual TASEP, which is schematically depicted
in Fig. 1. Where the length of gene is assumed to be N +1, and each lattice site stands for one nucleotide or nucleotide
group (which means this model is obtained by coarse grain). The transcription begins with RNA polymerase binding
to lattice site 0 (corresponding to the promoter upstream the gene) with rate α, which depends on the concentration
of free polymerase in environment, the binding rate of transcription factors, and the nucleotide sequence of promoter
[33]. The transcription is ended by polymerase leaving from lattice site N , with corresponding rate denoted by β.

4
This study assumes that only lattice site l may be damaged (or occupied by a protein complex). The rate constant
that site l becomes damaged is denoted by kp̂d . If the damaged site l is not occupied by a polymerase, then it can be
repaired with rate kp̂r . See the following Eq. (3) for the dynamics of probability that site l is damaged. If the site l is
damaged, polymerase on it may bypass it directly (with no transcription) and continue its forward translocation along
template, and finally leave from the stop site N , but the product (i.e. mRNA) synthesized by it will be incorrect and
will degrade soon. In this study, the probability that there is a polymerase with a correct semi-finished product at
site i (for 0 ≤ i ≤ N ) is denoted by pi , and the probability that there is a polymerase with an incorrect semi-finished
product at site i (for l + 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) is denoted by qi . A polymerase at site i (for i 6= l) will move to site i + 1 with
rate kE provided site i + 1 is unoccupied.
If the site l is damaged, polymerase at this site will be stalled. Experiments found that there are three possible
mechanisms for the stalled polymerase to leave the damaged site l. (1) The polymerase may backtrack to the previous
site l − 1 with rate kb provided the site l − 1 is not occupied. After the repair of site l, the backtracked polymerase
will return to site l with rate kf . The probability of finding a backtracked polymerase at site l − 1 is denoted by
p′l−1 . See the following Eq. (5) for the dynamics of probability p′l−1 . (2) The polymerase may bypass the damaged
site l with rate kbp , and continue its transcription from the downstream site l + 1. (3) The polymerase may degrade
with rate kd and detach from the transcription template. Note that the genetic information coded in damaged site
l cannot be transcribed. Therefore, the mRNA synthesized by a polymerase which has bypassed the damaged site l
is nonfunctional and will degrade soon. Meanwhile, the damaged site l cannot be repaired if there is a polymerase
binding on it. Thus, if kb = 0, kbp = 0, and kd = 0, the polymerase will be stalled at the damaged site l forever. So
bypass, degradation, and backtracking are three important mechanisms for cells to continue the transcription process.
Otherwise, the template will be totally blocked and become useless, and should be degraded.
This study assumes that each site i can only be occupied by one polymerase. If there is one backtracked polymerase
at site l − 1, the site l will be unoccupied. This is because that the backtracked polymerase at site l − 1 is from site
l. In the following, the probability of finding a polymerase at damaged site l is denoted by ρ. For the model depicted
in Fig. 1, the probabilities pi are governed by the following equations
dp0 /dt

= α(1 − p0 ) − kE p0 (1 − p1 ),

dpi /dt

= kE pi−1 (1 − pi ) − kE pi (1 − pi+1 ),

for 1 ≤ i ≤ l − 3,

dpl−2 /dt = kE pl−3 (1 − pl−2 ) − kE pl−2 (1 − pl−1 − p′l−1 ),
dpl−1 /dt = kE pl−2 (1 − pl−1 − p′l−1 ) − kE pl−1 (1 − pl ),

dpi /dt

= kE pi−1 (1 − pi − qi ) − kE pi (1 − pi+1 − qi+1 ),

dpN /dt

= kE pN −1 (1 − pN − qN ) − βpN .

for l + 2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1,

Where the equations for 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 3 and l + 2 ≤ i ≤ N can be obtained similarly as in usual TASEP model. The
total probability of finding polymerase at site l − 1 is pl−1 + p′l−1 , where pl−1 is the probability of polymerase which
comes from site l − 2, and p′l−1 is the probability of polymerase which is backtracked to site l − 1 from the damaged
site l. The probability flux from site l − 2 to site l − 1, which is related to the governing equations of probabilities
pl−2 and pl−1 , is kE pl−2 (1 − pl−1 − p′l−1 ). In the governing equation of probability pl , the first term is the flux from

5
site l − 1 to site l. The second term is the flux from undamaged site l to site l + 1, where pl − ρ is the probability
that there is a polymerase at site l and the site l is not damaged. The third term is the return flux from site l − 1 to
site l of the backtracked polymerase, where 1 − p̂ is the probabilty that the damaged site l has been repaired. The
forth term is the backtraking flux. The fifth term is the bypass flux, and the final term is the detachment flux. The
governing equation for probability pl+1 can be obtained similarly.
Meanwhile, the probabilities qi satisfy (see Fig. 1(b) for the meanings of probabilities qi )
dql+1 /dt = kbp ρ(1 − pl+1 − ql+1 ) − kE ql+1 (1 − pl+2 − ql+2 ),
dqi /dt

= kE qi−1 (1 − pi − qi ) − kE qi (1 − pi+1 − qi+1 ),

dqN /dt

= kE qN −1 (1 − pN − qN ) − βqN .

for l + 2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1,

(2)

Where the probability p̂ that site l is damaged satisfies
dp̂/dt = kp̂d (1 − p̂) − kp̂r (p̂ − ρ).

(3)

In which, the second term is from the assumption that only the unoccupied site l can be repaired. The probability ρ
that there is a polymerase at the damaged site l can be obtained as follows
dρ/dt = kp̂d (pl − ρ) + kE pl−1 (p̂ − ρ) − kbp ρ(1 − ql+1 − pl+1 ) − kd ρ − kb ρ(1 − p′l−1 − pl−1 ).

(4)

Where the first term is the flux of probability that the occupied site l becomes damaged. The second term is the flux
of probability that a polymerase translocates from site l − 1 to the unoccupied but damaged site l. The last three
terms are bypass flux, detachment flux, and backtracking flux, respectively. Finally, the probability p′l−1 that there
is a backtracked polymerase at site l − 1 satisfies
dp′l−1 /dt = kb ρ(1 − pl−1 − p′l−1 ) − kf (1 − p̂)p′l−1 .

(5)

Where the first term is the backtracking probability flux of the stalled polymerase from the damaged site l to its
upstream site l − 1, and the second term is the return probability flux of the backtracked polymerase. For convenience,
meanings of probabilities pl , p̂, ρ are displayed in Fig. 1(c). The total probability of finding a polymerase at site i, no
matter whether it is with a correctly synthesized mRNA or an incorrect mRNA, is denoted by Pi , or mathematically,

RESULTS

All results of this study are based on the steady state solution of Eqs. (1-5), which are obtained by numerical
calculations performed in software MATLAB. To illustrate the properties of gene transcription with possible stalling
of polymerase at a given position, typical examples of related probabilities, obtained by the modified TASEP model,
are plotted in Fig. 2. Where Figs. 2(a-d) are for the cases where kb = kd = 0, i.e., the backtracking rate to the
upstream site l − 1 and detachment rate from site l for stalled polymerase at site l vanish. For these special cases, the
total probability Pi of finding polymerase at site i may have three different phases, low density phase (Figs. 2(a,c)),

high density phase (Figs. 2(b)), and maximal flux phase (Figs. 2(d)). Where the probability flux is defined by
Ji = KE Pi (1 − Pi ), which reaches its maximal value 1/4 when Pi ≡ 1/2. Meanwhile, boundary layers may exist
at one or both of the two boundaries, i = 0 and i = N . These properties are similar as the ones of usual TASEP
models, and the probability and corresponding flux are fully determined by the transcription initiation rate α and
the transcription termination rate β, see [3, 34]. For general cases with nonzero values of backtracking rate kb and
detachment rate kd , the plots in Figs. 2(e-h) show that, the probability Pi has a sharp change at the site l. For
the sake of comparison, except kb and kd , other parameter values used in (e)-(h) are the same as the ones used in
(a)-(d) respectively, see Table I. Since polymerase at damaged site l may degrade and detach from the transcription
template, different with the ones plotted in Figs. 2(a-d), the probability flux Ji = KE Pi (1 − Pi ) for the general cases
is not conversed along the template. Meanwhile, since polymerase can only detach or backtrack from the damaged
site l, the flux Ji is conversed both in the region between site i = 0 and site i = l − 1 and in the region between site
i = l + 1 and site i = N . Because of the detachment, the probability flux will be reduced after site l. It means that
for the cases of low density phase and maximal flux phase, the probability Pi will be reduced after site l (see Figs.
2(e,g,h)), while for the cases of high density phase, Pi will be increased (see Figs. 2(f )). Due to the backtracking of
polymerase from damaged site l, the total probability of finding polymerase at site l − 1, Pl−1 , may be higher than
those of other sites, see Figs. 2(g).
The plots in Figs. 2(a-d) imply that, without polymerase detachment, the total transcription rate may not be
reduced by the site damage. But the effective (or correct) transcription rate, i.e., the rate to synthesize correct
mRNA, will be reduced. Given the nonzero bypass rate kbp , some products are incorrect and will degrade rapidly.
With additional detachment of polymerase from the damaged site l, for general cases, the effective transcription rate
is less than the effective transcription initial rate, see Figs. 2(e-h). In this study, the effective transcription initial rate
is defined as αef f := α(1 − p0 ), the effective transcription rate is defined as βef f := βpN , and the bypass transcription
rate is defined as βbp := βqN . In the following, the parameter dependent properties of αef f , βef f , βbp , and the
ratio r := βef f /αef f will be discussed in detail. The ratio r is one reasonable index to describe the effectiveness of
transcription including polymerase stalling.
The plots in Fig. 3 show that with nonzero detachment rate kd , all the effective rates αef f , βef f , and βbp decrease
with the position l of damaged site, but the transcription effectiveness r increases with l (see the lines in Fig. 3 with
marker “◦”). Given that polymerase can only detach from the damaged site l, if the location l of damaged nucleotide

which are obtained from Eqs. (1-6) with gene length N = 100. (a-d) are for simplified cases where detachment and backtracking
of polymerase from damaged site l are not allowed, i.e. kb = kd = 0. While (e-h) are for cases with nonzero detachment rate
and backtracking rate. Except the values of kb and kd , other parameter values used in (a-d) are the same as the ones used in
(e-h) respectively, see Table I. (a,c,e,g) are examples of the low probability density case with probability less than 0.5, (b,f )
are examples of high density case with probability larger than 0.5, and (d,h) are examples of maximal flux case. The sharp
decrease of probability Pi after site l = 100 is due to the polymerase detachment from site l. For the meanings of probability
notations, see Fig. 1

is far from the initiation site 0, then the polymerase density between sites 0 and l will be high and consequently the
polymerase current along gene will be low. Thus, the effective transcription initiation rate αef f is decreased with l.
Except from the damaged site l, polymerase can not detach from the transcription template, therefore low effective
initiation rate will lead to low transcription rate. Thus, effective transcription rate βef f and bypass transcription rate
βbp also decrease with the damaged position l. The increase of transcription effectiveness r with damaged position
l implies that large values of damaged position l will be beneficial for cells to increase the transcription efficiency
and save energy molecules. On the other hand, for non-detachment cases, i.e., kd = 0 (see the lines in Fig. 3 with
marker “∗”), the effective initiation rate αef f is independent of damaged position l, but the effective transcription
rate βef f increases with l. Thus the transcription effectiveness r = βef f /αef f also increases with damaged position l.
Therefore, for any case (with or without detachment of polymerase from the damaged site), large values of damaged
position l will help to increase the transcription efficiency. The plots in Fig. 3 also show that except for the cases
where the damaged site of template is close to the transcription start site or termination site, αef f , βef f , βbp , and r
are not sensitive to the damaged position l.
Fig. 4(a) shows that the effective transcription initiation rate αef f increases with the initiation rate α, and tends to
approach one limit value. In the calculations of Fig. 4(a), the line with marker “∗” is obtained with large termination
rate β and nonzero detachment rate kd , the line with marker “◦” is obtained with small termination rate β and
nonzero detachment rate kd , and the thick solid line is obtained with small termination rate β and zero detachment
rate. Thus, the plots in Fig. 4(a) also imply that the initiation rate limit of the effective rate αef f increases with the
termination rate β and detachment rate kd . For large initiation rate α, the effective transcription rate βef f also has
one limit value, which increases with termination rate β and detachment rate kd , see Fig. 4(b). But, different with

the effective initiation rate αef f , βef f may not change monotonically with initiation rate α. The plots in Fig. 4(c)
show that the bypass transcription rate βbp increases with the initiation rate α, and tends to one limit value when
α is large enough. The limit value of βbp increases with termination rate β but decreases with detachment rate kd .
This is because, for large values of detachment rate kd , polymerase will have less chances to reach the stop site of the
template. Finally, the transcription effectiveness r decreases with initiation rate α, and its limit value increases with
both the termination rate β and detachment rate kd , see Fig. 4(d).
Except the bypass transcription rate βbp , both of the two rates αef f and βef f , and the effectiveness r, increase
monotonically with the termination rate β, and tend to approach corresponding limit values for large β, see Fig.
5. The backtracking of stalled polymerase at damaged site l can help to raise the transcription effectiveness r (see
the line with marker “◦” in Fig. 5(d)). For high termination rate β, β > 0.5, backtracking also helps to raise the
effective transcription rate βef f (see the plots in Fig. 5(b)). Therefore, high termination rate and backtracking
rate are beneficial to getting high effective transcription rate and to increasing the transcription effectiveness. With
backtracking but no detachment, the stalled polymerase at damaged site l will have additional chance to continue its
transcription.
Without detachment, i.e., kd = 0, there are only two mechanisms for the stalled polymerase to leave damaged site
l, backtracking to site l − 1 and waiting for the repair of site l or bypassing the damaged site l and continuing its
transcription from site l + 1. With the increase of backtracking rate kb , the translocation of polymerase along the

FIG. 5: The effective transcription initiation rate αef f (a), effective transcription rate βef f (b), bypass transcription rate βbp

zero detachment rate kd but nonzero backtracking rate kb , while the lines with marker ‘∗’ are obtained with nonzero detachment
rate kd but zero backtracking rate kb . In calculations, the termination rate β changes from 0.1 to 1 with an increment 0.1, for

template will be slowed down. Thus, the effective transcription initiation rate αef f decreases with backtracking rate
kb , see Fig. 6(a). Given that there are only two mechanisms for the stalled polymerase to leave damaged site l,
the increase of backtracking rate will lead to the decrease of the probability of bypass. This implies that, the bypass
transcription rate decreases with backtracking rate kb , see Fig. 6(c). Finally, the plots in Figs 6(b,d) show that, both
the effective transcription rate βef f and the transcription effectiveness r increase with backtracking rate kb . Thus,
backtracking is one of the ideal mechanisms for cells to solve the stalling problem.
If the stalled polymerase can only continue its translocation by the bypass mechanism, i.e. bypass the damaged
site l and continue its transcription from site l + 1, and cannot backtrack to site l + 1 or detach from the template,
then the effective transcription initiation rate αef f , the bypass transcription rate βbp , and the effective transcription
rate βef f will all increase with the bypass rate bbp , see Fig. 7(a-c). The increase of rate βef f with bypass rate bbp
is because, with large values of kbp , the polymerase with correctly synthesized mRNA will have less possibility to be
blocked during its transcription process. However, the plots in Fig. 7(d) indicate that transcription effectiveness r
decreases with bypass rate kbp . Besides the bypass mechanism, if the stalled polymerase can also backtrack to the
previous site l − 1 to wait for the repair of the damaged site l, then the rates αef f , βef f , and effectiveness r will be
increased (see the lines with markers “◦” and “∗” in Figs. 7(a,b,d)). The lines plotted in Figs. 7(c) with markers
“◦” and “∗” show that, with additional backtracking mechanism, i.e., kb 6= 0, the bypass transcription rate βbp will
be reduced. Meanwhile, all the solid lines and the lines with marker “◦” in Figs. 7(a-d) show that with additional
detachment mechanism, i.e., kd 6= 0, all the effective rates αef f , βef f , and βbp , and the transcription effectiveness r
will be reduced. This implies that the detachment of stalled polymerase may not be one good mechanism for cells

to solve the transcription stalling problem, and to increase their transcription rate and efficiency. The plots in Fig 7
also show that, for the special cases with either nonzero detachment rate or nonzero backtracking rate, the effective
rates αef f , βef f , βbp only change slightly with the bypass rate kbp .
The plots in Fig. 8(a) show that, generally, the effective initiation rate αef f increases with the detachment rate of
stalled polymerase at damaged site l. Because for large values of detachment rate, the polymerase density between site
0 and site l will be low. Therefore, the effective initiation rate αef f = α(1 − p0 ) will be large. But for the cases with
large termination rate β, αef f is almost independent of detachment rate kd , see the thick solid line in Fig. 8(a). This
is because, for large termination rate β, the polymerase density along transcription template is low enough, and the
influence of detachment of stalled polymerase can be neglected. In other words, detachment will not help to reduce
the polymerase density any longer. From the plots in Fig. 8(b), one can see that for low termination rate β, the
effective transcription rate βef f increases with detachment rate kd . The reason is that large detachment rate kd will be
helpful to reduce the polymerase density along the transcript template. Consequently, the mean translocation speed
of polymerase will be high. But for large values of termination rate β, βef f decreases with detachment rate kd (see
the thick solid line in Fig. 8(b)). Given large values of β, the polymerase density along template will be low enough
such that each polymerase can translocate forward freely. Thus, with large values of detachment rate kd , polymerase
will have less opportunity to complete its whole transcription process. This means that the effective transcription
rate βef f will be low for large detachment rate kd . Because there are altogether three possible mechanisms for stalled
polymerase to leave the damaged site l, i.e., backtracking, detachment, and bypass, the bypass transcription rate βbp
will be low for large detachment rate kd , see Fig. 8(c). The plots in Fig. 8(d) show that, for the cases with nonzero
backtracking rate kb , transcription effectiveness r decreases slightly with detachment rate kd . But for the cases with

FIG. 7: The effective transcription initiation rate αef f (a), effective transcription rate βef f (b), bypass transcription rate βbp
(c), and the transcription effectiveness r (d), as functions of the bypass rate kbp . In each figure, three typical examples are
plotted. Where the lines with marker ‘∗’ are obtained with kd = 0 and kb 6= 0, the thick solid lines are obtained with kd 6= 0
and kb = 0, and the lines with marker ‘◦’ are obtained with kd = kb = 0. The bypass rate kbp changes from 0 to 1 with an
increment 0.1. The values of other parameters are listed in Table II.

zero backtracking rate, effectiveness r increases with kd . This implies that when no backtracking, detachment is one
good mechanism to solve the polymerase stalling problem. But generally, backtracking may be better than detachment
at increasing the transcription efficiency.
Figs. 9(a-c) show that all the effective rates, αef f , βef f , and βbp increase with the return back rate kf of the
backtracked polymerase. Since large value of rate kf means that the backtracked polymerase at site l − 1 will return
back to site l quickly when the damaged site l has been repaired, and then restart its transcription. But the plots in
Fig. 9(d) show that for nonzero detachment rate kd and low termination rate β, transcription effectiveness decreases
with rate kf . Given low termination rate β, the polymerase density between sites l and N will be high, so the increase
of return back rate kf has little influence to increase the effective transcription rate βef f (see the line in Fig. 9(b)
with marker “∗”). But for nonzero detachment rate kd , the polymerase translocation between sites 0 and l may be
uncrowded, thus, the effective transcription initiation rate αef f increases with the return back rate kf (see the line in
Fig. 9(a) with marker “∗”). Therefore, from the definition of transcription effectiveness, r := βef f /αef f , for the cases
with low termination rate β but nonzero detachment rate kd , transcription effectiveness r decreases with the return
back rate kf . Therefore, large return back rate kf may not be helpful to increase the efficiency of transcription.
Finally, the plots in Figs. 10(b-d) show that the effective transcription rate βef f and transcription effectiveness r
decrease with the damage rate kp̂d of site l, while the bypass transcription rate βbp increases with kp̂d . For high damage
rate kp̂d , the polymerase is more likely to be stalled at the site l, and then the possibility of bypass will be high and
the synthesis speed of correct mRNA will be low. The plots in Fig. 10(a) imply that, for low termination rate β and
low backtracking rate kb , the effective initiation rate αef f increases with damage rate kp̂d . Given low termination rate

β, the polymerase density along transcription template will be high and the translocation speed of polymerase will
be low. With the increase of damage rate kp̂d , the stalled polymerase will have more possibility to detach from the
template. So the total leaving rate of polymerase from the transcription template, either from the stop site N or from
the damaged site l, will increase. Thus, the effective initiation rate αef f increases with the damage rate kp̂d . The line
with marker “◦” in Fig. 10(a) also show that, without detachment, the effective initiation rate αef f decreases with
damage rate kp̂d . This is because, for large damage rate, polymerase will be more likely to be stalled at the damaged
site l, and consequently, the translocation speed of polymerase along transcription template will be slowed down.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this study, a modified TASEP model is presented to describe gene transcription process including polymerase
stalling. Because of the detachment (or degradation) of polymerase from the damaged site, the polymerase density
along transcription template has a sharp change at the damaged site. As in usual TASEP models, the polymerase
density may have boundary layers at the transcription start site and termination site. In the main body of the
transcription template, the polymerase density may be in three phases, low density phase, high density phase, and
maximal flux phase. But the phases in different regions of the transcription template may be different. This study
showed that the effective transcription rate (the rate to synthesize mRNA correctly), and the transcription effectiveness
(the proportion of correct transcription) will be high if the damaged site of the transcription template is close to the
transcription termination site. The increase of transcription initiation rate will increase the effective transcription

15
rate, but decrease the transcription effectiveness. On the other hand, the increase of transcription termination rate
will increase the effective transcription rate and the transcription effectiveness, as well as the effective transcription
initiation rate.
Experiments found that there are three mechanisms for cells to solve the polymerase stalling problem, backtracking,
bypass and detachment. This study showed that the increase of backtracking rate will lead to the increase of effective
transcription rate and the transcription effectiveness, but lead to the decrease of the effective transcription initiation
rate. It implies that backtracking is one of the ideal mechanisms to increase the synthesizing rate of mRNA and the
transcription efficiency. Without backtracking and detachment, the increase of bypass rate will lead to the increase
of effective transcription rate. But for general cases, large values of bypass rate will lead to low values of effective
transcription rate and the transcription effectiveness. Similarly, without backtracking, detachment (or degradation) of
the stalled polymerase is one good mechanism to solve the stalling problem. But for nonzero backtracking rate cases,
the increase of detachment rate may lead to the decrease of effective transcription rate and transcription effectiveness.
As expected, the increase of damage rate of the transcription template will lead to the decrease of transcription
efficiency.
The results obtained in this study will be helpful to the understandings of gene transcription in living cells, and the
mechanisms used by cells to solve the polymerase stalling problem. The model presented in this study can be further
generalized to discuss more general cases of gene transcription process in which polymerase may be stalled at more
than one site of the transcription template. The model parameter values in real cells may be extracted through the
NET-seq approach presented in [35], and then the theoretical model given in this study can be used to do quantitative
analysis of the gene transcription process with polymerase stalling. Finally, combining this study with the recent
model presented by Choubey et al in [36], more details of the transcript process can be better understood.
