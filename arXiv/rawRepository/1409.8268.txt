We propose a network metric, edge proximity, Pe , which demonstrates the importance of specific
edges in a network, hitherto not captured by existing network metrics. The effects of removing edges
with high Pe might initially seem inconspicuous but are eventually shown to be very harmful for
networks. Compared to existing strategies, the removal of edges by Pe leads to a remarkable increase
in the diameter and average shortest path length in undirected real and random networks till the
first disconnection and well beyond. Pe can be consistently used to rupture the network into two
nearly equal parts, thus presenting a very potent strategy to greatly harm a network. Targeting by
Pe causes notable efficiency loss in U.S. and European power grid networks. Pe identifies proteins
with essential cellular functions in protein-protein interaction networks. It pinpoints regulatory
neural connections and important portions of the neural and brain networks, respectively. Energy
flow interactions identified by Pe form the backbone of long food web chains. Finally, we scrutinize
the potential of Pe in edge controllability dynamics of directed networks.

Considerable research has been done on the importance of various metrics in complex networks [1–4]. The
importance of nodes and remarkable effects of their targeted removal using various network metrics like betweenness and degree is now well known. In comparison, the role of edges has received less attention [5–7].
In this context, one may ask if it is possible to prognose situations where not even a single node is pruned
from the network for a long time and yet tremendous
damage is inflicted on it by selective targeting of specific
edges. Indeed, as we show here, such a process might initially appear inconspicuous or even deceptively innocuous. Using a simple metric, which we call edge proximity, we are able to identify specific edges whose removal
can slowly poison networks and silently wreak havoc in
them. Furthermore, we show that Pe can be used to design strategies to consistently rupture networks into two
nearly equal parts. Thus, this could eventually be far
more destructive than currently available strategies for
targeting network edges including those where rapid disconnection can be achieved due to detachment of small
subgraphs from the parent network.
The most well-known edge-based measure, edge betweenness, Be , attempts to capture the frequency of an
edge lying on the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a network [5, 6]. Edges with the highest Be are
most likely to lie between subgraphs, rather than inside
them. Thus, targeting by node or edge betweenness ensures rapid disconnection of networks by a small number
of deletions [8, 9].
Herein, we introduce a new edge-based network metric,
edge proximity, Pe . The Pe of an edge, e ∈ E, is the
inverse of the sum of its shortest distance d(e, f ), with
every other edge, f ∈ E, in a connected network, G(V, E).
Va\dE denote the set of nodes and edges, respectively, in

G. N = |V| and M = |E| are the total number of nodes
and edges in G, respectively. Pe lends clues as to how
close each edge is to every other edge in G through the
shortest paths between them. Thus, for e ∈ E,

The Average shortest path length, LG , is the average of
all the shortest path lengths between any pair of nodes
in G and is defined as,

The Diameter of G is defined as,
D = max(d(s, t)), ∀ s, t ∈ V; s 6= t;

(3)

d(s, t) being the shortest path from s to t. From the
definition of LG and D it is clear that LG and D become
infinite when G becomes disconnected.
When edges are targeted by Be , the damage done to the
network in the form of increases in LG and D might initially seem to be greater. However, we observe here that
Pe helps in identifying those crucial edges of undirected
networks whose deletion ensures the highest increase in
LG and D in G (or its largest connected component, G 0 )
compared to other methods of edge deletion. This appears to be true for both the first disconnection and well
beyond. In fact, when targeting by Pe no node is disconnected from the network for a very long time. Here,
we study the effect of various edge deletion strategies on
real-world undirected networks like the E.U. and U.S.
power grid network (PGNs) and the protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) of S. cerevisiae and E. coli
till the first disconnection. We also scrutinize the effect of these strategies, long after the first disconnection

(till only about 30% of the edges remain in G 0 ), on various models like the Erdös-Rényi (ER) [10], BarabasiAlbert (BA) [11], and small-world (SW) [12, 13] networks. We also study a variety of directed biological
networks, namely, the macaque brain network, the C. elegans neural network, and a number of food webs. We
find that in each case Pe successfully provides meaningful
biological information.
There have been lots of studies on disconnection of
networks by malicious targeting. However, it is obvious
that significant damage would be caused to the network
when each disconnection causes the network to rupture
into two nearly equal parts rather than having a small
chunk disconnected from it. We demonstrate that Pe
can be remarkably successful in consistently achieving
this, compared to other methods of edge removal.
An edge with higher Pe should possess the potential
to reach many other edges in directed networks. Of late,
there has been considerable research on node controllability in networks [14, 15]. Switchboard dynamics (SBD)
of edges has also been recently proposed to study edge
controllability of directed networks and to identify the
minimal set of driven edges [16]. We conclude by examining the natural potential that Pe possesses in the
context of controllability of directed networks.
Figure 1 uses a toy example to illustrate the construction of a line graph L(G) from G. The first step for creating L(G) is that every node in L(G) represents an edge
in the original graph G. An edge is drawn between any
two nodes in L(G) if the corresponding edges in G share
a common node. For directed graphs, an edge in L(G)
represents a directed path of length 2 in G. Each node
of L(G) is an edge of G. Thus, Pe , e ∈ E can be obtained
from closeness centrality of corresponding node in L(G).

elled with nodes involved in definition, as X1 (G), or without nodes as X2 (G). |X1 (G) ∼ X2 (G)| might not be very
significant, especially when G is large. The computation
time for X2 (G) might be slightly longer than that for
X1 (G).
We investigate a number of edge deletion strategies
which affect LG and D in G. The strategies adopted
here consist of independently deleting successive edges:
(i) with max(Pe ), (ii) with max(Be ), (iii) connected to
the node of the highest degree in G [max(Ke )], and, (iv)
purely at random (Re ). To illustrate further, we construct four identical copies of G(V, E); {Gi (Vi , Ei )}, i ∈
{1, 2, 3, 4}. We then remove the edge with max(Pe ),
max(Be ), max(Ke ), e ∈ Ei , i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, from G1 , G2 , G3 ,
respectively. In case there is more than one edge with
max(Pe ), max(Be ), and max(Ke ), we randomly choose
one among them. We recalculate the values of Pe , Be and
Ke , e ∈ Ei , i ∈ {1, 2, 3}; for G1 , G2 , and G3 , respectively.
For all real-world networks studied here, we repeat this
removal and recalculation process, until the first node is
disconnected. In G4 edges are always deleted randomly.
We test these strategies for PGNs of the European
Union [18] and United States [? ] by recording change in
LG and D till the first node disconnection. As shown in
Fig. 2, deletion of edges by Be has a strong effect on the
increase in D (and LG ), initially. Random edge deletion
does not lead a significant increase in D (and LG ) of the
PGNs. Similarly, targeting by max(Ke ) does not lead to
a significant increase in D (and LG ), at least for the U.S.
PGN. The most striking increase in D (and LG ) is, however, seen for successive deletions using max(Pe ). Thus
Pe identifies specific edges whose existence is crucial for
the network. Damage to these edges affects η, LG , and
D significantly in PGNs.
We also calculate the efficiency, η, which is the average
of the inverse of all shortest path lengths between any
pair of nodes in G [19]:

η=

from a directed graph, G, to calculate the value of Pe for all
edges. Edges in G (nodes in L(G)) shown in bold depict a
set of driven edges found by applying the maximum matching
algorithm in L(G).

As is well known, the computational complexity of
node closeness is O (|V| log |V| + |E|). The number of
nodes in L(G) is |E|. The number of two-path lengths in
G is the number of edges in L(G). Therefore the compu2
tational complexity for Pe is O (|E| log |E| + |E| ) and
can be computed easily. All networks were analyzed here
using NetworkX [17].
The very same edge-based metric, X (G), can be mod-

Both E.U. and U.S. PGNs become disconnected by a
small number of random edge deletions with insignificant loss of η, as shown in Fig. 3. Notably, connectedness is still maintained for both E.U. and U.S. PGNs
when targeted by max(Ke ). However, maximum loss of
η (and increase in D and LG ) is observed when edges are
targeted by max(Pe ). Of course, loss of η in the E.U.
PGN is comparable for max(Ke ) and max(Pe ) strategies. However, it is not comparable for the U.S. PGN.
Thus, in general, max(Pe ) edges could be very different
from max(Ke ) edges.
We keep deleting edges even after the first node disconnection, until G 0 contains only 30% of the edges of G,
as shown in Fig. 4 for BA, ER and SW networks. Further
edge deletions are not conducted because in very small
graphs Pe loses its meaning, as every edge is usually quite

close to most other edges. DS fluctuates most in ER networks due to the larger number of disconnections. Effects
due to Pe are higher in networks with higher clustering.
Thus Pe should be important for many real-world networks.
Great harm can be caused to a network if it can be
broken into two nearly equal parts at each disconnection rather than having a small part disconnected from
it. As demonstrated in Figure. 5, for BA, ER, and SW
networks, targeting by Pe can be a remarkably successful
way to consistently achieve this outcome.
For all biological networks studied here, we scrutinise
the biological significance of edges with the highest Pe

, Q ∈ {Pe , Be }.
σ(Q)

(5)

µ(Q) is the mean and, σ(Q), the standard deviation of
the Q distribution. For consistency, we restrict ourselves
to the top 2% of edges with Z(Q) ≥ 1.
First, we observe the effect of edge deletion in G 0 of
yeast [20] and E. coli [21] PPINs till first disconnection.
As shown in Figs. 2 (c) and (d), removal of interactions
by Pe increases LG and D of PPINs the most. In the
E. coli PPIN, an essential protein, 60kDa chaperonin is
consistently present at one end of Z(P e ) ≥ 1 edges. This
60kDa protein exhibits a specific stress dependent coexpression with its connected proteins via these Z(P e ) ≥
1 edges [22], alike date hubs [23].
Tropic interactions and energy flow directions in food
web networks (FWNs) are represented by directed edges
from prey to predators [24]. The cascade of extinction and role of keystone species are well documented
depending on the species- or node-based approach of
FWNs [25, 26]. Tropic interactions or the edge-based
approach might be beneficial for identifying important
interactions in the FWN. Herein, we analyze three coral
reef FWNs of Cayman Island, Cuba and Jamaica [27] and
four FWNs in South Florida ecosystems [28, 29]. Be and
Pe identify different sets of edges for these FWNs. The
root interactions of the dominator tree of corresponding FWNs [25, 30] are considered to be important interactions of primary consumers with producers or interactions with the outside environment. These are located at the initial positions in long food chains. Removal of these interactions may lead to secondary extinction of many species [25] or may stop the sending
of input energy into the FWN from the outer environment [28, 29]. Pe seems to identify these root interactions
correctly. Z(P e ) ≥ 1 edges include such interactions as
primary consumers interacting with planktonic bacteria,
phytoplanton, or macrophytes and the environmental input to primary producers and epiphytes. Be identifies
other interactions between keystone species such as Diadema, bivalves, vertebrate detritus, meso-invertebrates,
etc [6, 31–36], successfully. Thus, many food chains possess Z(B e ) ≥ 1 edges and their removal might hamper
many tropic interactions [31].
There has been significant research on detecting emergent behavioral patterns from networks of interconnected
neurons. Functional and structural aspects of neural networks are rather well studied in the case of the C. elegans network. The connectivity data have been obtained
from reconstruction of electron microscopy [37]. To detect functionally and structurally important synapses, we
analyze the network using Pe and Be . Z(B e ) ≥ 1 identifies RME, AIB, RIA, RIF, AIM, and AEV synapses.
These are ring motors and interneurons associated with
thermotaxis and backward movement [38–40]. However,
Z(P e ) ≥ 1 identifies various synapses of AVEL which

networks.

are solely associated with backward movement of C. elegans [38].
We also study the brain network of monkeys formed
from connectivity data on macaque brain (CoCoMac
data sets), where neural fibers connecting different portions of the brain are represented by directed edges [41].
Analyzing all neural connections by Be and Pe , we find
that two rather different types of edges in hierarchical
information processing pathways are identified by these
two metrics. Z(B e ) ≥ 1 identifies interactions which
are essentially localized in the intermediate regions of
the brain like the prefrontal cortex [42]. Interestingly,
Z(P e ) ≥ 1 corresponds to various connections from cortex to thalamus, frontal lobe and temporal lobe, which
are the starting interactions of longer information processing pathways from the cortex to other regions of the
brain [42].
Finally, under SBD of edge controllability, each node
is conceived as acting similarly to a small switchboardlike device [16]. Nodes map the input signals of the inbound edges to the outbound edges. Figure. 1 depicts

an example akin to Ref. [16]. The maximum matching
algorithm is used for the line graph, L(G), constructed
from the original network G = G(V, E) for identifying all

possible sets of driven edges, E = {Ei : i ∈ Z+ }, in G

in Fig. 1. Intuitively, edges with higher Pe could be

This

(2, 3), or (6, 4) is not a good driven edge because each
of these edges can only control itself. We observe that
Pe = 0 for them. This proof-of-concept example illustrates the potential utility of Pe to act as an index of
edge control centrality of individual edges under SBD.
Even though infrastructure and biological networks
have been examined in-depth in this paper, Pe would
play a prominent role in most real-world and random

5
networks, especially large ones. For very small networks,
Pe becomes irrelevant because almost all edges are then
mutually close. The slow poisoning effect due to Pe increases with clustering in undirected graphs. Therefore,
Pe would be important in a wide variety of real-world

networks. As with almost any other network metric, its
importance would be rather limited in very dense graphs.
