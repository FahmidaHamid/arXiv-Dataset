We undertake a systematic numerical exploration of self-organised states in a deterministic model
of interacting, self-propelled particles in 2D. In the process, we identify new types of collective
motion, namely disordered swarms, rings and droplets. We construct a “phase diagram”, which
summarizes our results as it delineates phase transitions (all discontinuous) between disordered
swarms and vortical flocks on one hand, and bound vortical flocks and expanding formations on
the other. One of transition lines is found to have a close analogy in the temperature-driven gasliquid transition in finite clusters with the same interparticle potential. Furthermore, we report on
a novel type of flocking which takes place in the presence of a uniform external driver. Altogether,
our results set a rather firm stage for experimental refinement and/or falsification of this class of
models.

Populations of self-propelled organisms tend to organize in remarkable aggregate formations [1]. Schools
of fish, flocks of birds, swarms of bees or locust are
among the more familiar examples. Less familiar perhaps, though equally prevalent, are the organized states
achieved by microscopic organisms: amoeba aggregates
[2], bacterial colonies [3, 4], and swarms of Daphnia [5].
Such striking self-organized collective phenomena stimulated natural extensions of trusted models and tools of
equilibrium statistical mechanics to systems of coupled
self propelled particles. Proposed models have varied
in degrees of idealization and complexity of the description of swarms, their environments and the interactions
between them. They can be broadly divided into continuous [6–9] and discrete self-propelled particle (SPP)
models [10–13], both coming in deterministic as well as
stochastic varieties. In these pioneering studies, models were mainly analyzed for their ability to display certain observed phenomena (transition from swarm to flock
[8, 10], vortical swarms [12, 14]), as well as the potential
universality of certain features (scaling behavior [11], individual distance [15]). More often than not, they were
not pushed to predictive risks that would at best qualify
and refine them, at worst falsify them. While these exercises are crucial to identify generic sufficient conditions
for the occurrence of observed states, they leave open the
question as to whether or not these conditions necessarily
obtain in the living system under investigation. In cases
where such systems are open to detailed experimental
investigation [4], it proves useful to explore the richness
of behavior sustained by classes of models, with a view
to proposing tracks for spatio-temporal evolution that
might result under (slow) changes in the experimental
setting. This is precisely the objective we had in mind as
we embarked on our explorations, and shall dedicate the
rest of this letter to describing the working model (dis-

crete, deterministic, SPP model), summarizing our extensive numerical experiments, and highlighting our significant, and eminently testable, results: a- novel types of
self-organisation namely the disk, ring, polarized vortex,
droplet and expansion states; b- a phase diagram which
distills, on a reduced parameter plane, the various states,
and the transitions between them; c- an intriguing route
to flocking, which obtains in the presence of an external,
uniform, force field.
Given the inherent complexity of our undertaking, we
opted for a simple, but fairly versatile, deterministic SPP
model, flavors of which have been examined by Levine et.
al. [12], in their quest for vortices, and Edelstein-Keshet
et.al [15] in a study of individual distances in swarms.
The particles in this model are identical in their mass,
and in the nature of the forces they feel and generate.
Their self-propulsion is mimicked with an acceleration
of constant magnitude, acting along the direction of motion. They are coupled via a double exponential potential
force field, which attracts at large distances, and repels
at small distances. Furthermore, they are subjected to
a drag force, which captures the reaction of the viscous
medium in which they move (and which is here assumed
linear in the velocity). Newton’s equation for the ith
particle reads
d~

= σ vˆi − γ v~i − ∇r~i φ

where m, r~i and v~i are the mass, position and velocity of
the ith particle, σ the magnitude of the self-propulsion
force, which acts along the direction of motion vˆi , and γ
the friction coefficient. The potential energy φ is given

where N is the population size, and Wr , Wa , lr and la
determine the strength and range of repulsive and attractive forces respectively. It proves useful to work with
the dimensionless variables r~′ = ~r/lr , v~′ = ~v /vt , and
t′ = t/τ , with vt = σγ (the “terminal velocity”), and
τ = lr /vt = lr γ/σ. In the primed variables, the equation

over self-propulsion) , Q = Wr /σlr (repulsion over selfpropulsion), and R = mσ/(lr γ 2 ) (a Reynolds-like number for the flow), which together with the population size
N , fully specify a swarm in our model.
In what follows, we are primarily concerned with the
behavior of 2D swarms. Initially (and except when otherwise specified), particles are uniformly distributed in a
square (its size being chosen so that the initial swarm is
bounded [16]), with randomly oriented initial velocities,
and speeds uniformly distributed between 0 and the terminal velocity. Populations ranging in size between 100
and 1000 members were considered. With these initial
conditions, and the help of a 4th order, adaptive, Rungekutta scheme [17], we thoroughly explored the parameter
space. Simulations were allowed to run till the system’s
energy (and wherever relevant, mean velocity and density) relaxed to near steady configurations, on which our
classification is based. Results are viewed in the center
of mass frame, the origin of which, though interesting in
its wanderings, is not a serious concern of this inquiry.
Broadly speaking, these random initial conditions converge, to a center manifold (think of it as the terminal
velocity manifold), on which the swarm relaxes to distinct regimes, which though not exhaustive of the rich
behavior allowed by this model, constitute the skeleton on which a complete description will be eventually
fleshed out. Before displaying, then analyzing, a typical
(two dimensional) space in which these regimes find there
proper home, we survey their main qualitative properties.
We draw our results from experiments with 1000 particles, while noting that the existence and main qualitative
properties of these regimes are independent of the size of
the population.
We start with the ring state, shown in Fig. 1(a), a
highly regimented configuration, in which particles rotate and counter-rotate on a perfect circle. Next in line,
is the polarized vortex, shown in Fig. 1(b), in which nearly
all particles travel in the same direction [18]. A hitherto unsuspected formation is the droplet state, Fig. 1(cd), in which the swarm breaks up into a necklace of
drop-like flocks. Droplets rotate clockwise and counter-

traveling in the opposite direction. Bona fide vortices,
on which particles are nearly split even between prograde and retrograde circulation, are shown in Fig. 1(e).
Fig. 1(f) shows an example of the disordered disk state,
in which particles move chaotically, while self-confined
within a disk like region. Lastly, the expansion state, in
which self-propulsion dominates over attractive forces to
promote the outward explosion of the swarm, is shown in
Fig. 1(g).
Perhaps more important than the identification of
novel self-organized states, is the realization that the

five dimensional parameter space (the four dimensionless model parameters, plus N ) reduces, once the dynamics settles on the terminal velocity manifold, to a
three dimensional space, in which the variety of relaxed, self-organized configurations, is itself organized
in a phase (morphology) diagram of sorts. This space
is spanned by λ = lr /la , α = Q/P = Wr /(λWa ), and
β = R/N P = mvt2 /(N λWa ). We verified, with extensive
numerical explorations, that models with the same (λ,
α, β) relax to qualitatively similar configurations, that a
steady configuration in the (λ, α, β) plane unfolds into a
hyper-surface of similar configurations in the five dimensional parameter space of the model.
It was noted [19] that the Morse potential (Eq. 2) with
parameter values resulting in self-organized states is not
H-stable in the language of statistical mechanics [20].
H-stability is related to the existence of a well-defined
thermodynamic limit with finite intensive local densities.
The system which is not H-stable is called catastrophic.
Indeed, the necessary criterion to ensure this stability is
that the integral over space of the pair interaction potential be non-negative. Since
Z

φ(r)d2 r = 2πWa la2 αλ3 − 1
the criterion is not satisfied and the system is catastrophic for α < λ−3 . In the catastrophic regime the
average potential energy per particle in large but finite
systems is proportional to N .
The reduced set of parameters has, therefore, simple
physical meaning: α and λ together define the shape
of the potential, and, in particular, the degree to which

the system is away from H-stability. As α increases towards the value of λ−3 the system approaches the normal, non-catastrophic regime. On the other hand, β has
the meaning of the ratio of the typical kinetic energy to
the potential energy per particle (which is dominated by
attraction and is of order N Wa ).
In this reduced parameter space, one could survey
steady states, and neighbouring configurations, by varying three of the model parameters (say Wa , la and γ
or σ) and keeping the others (Wr , lr , N and σ or γ)
fixed. Thousands of computing hours went into clarifying the salient features of the resulting phase diagram,
the invariant structures of the model. These features are
clearly delineated on constant λ slices, where the relaxed
dynamics typically splits into four regions, as apparent
in the particular instance in Fig. 2: a) a region occupied
by the disordered disk states, for smallish β (attraction
and viscosity dominated models); b) a region occupied
by unbound, expanding states, for largish β (propulsion
dominated models); c) an intermediate region where all
organized states live (i.e. rings, droplets, polarized vortices and regular vortices). This region is bounded below by the critical phase transition line (CPT1) between
disordered and ordered states, and above by the critical phase transition line (CPT2) between ordered and
expanding states. It is bounded to the left by the line
α = 1, or Wa /la = Wb /lb , a line of ring states, the radius
of which increases with increasing β, all else being held
fixed, till the point (past CPT2) where the dominant selfpropulsion fragments the ring into an expanding state; d)
a region of irregular, multi-cluster, and unsteady configurations, which is obtained in attraction dominated models (to the left of the ring line, and which we keep out of
our humble focus on coherent, relaxed swarms).
CPT1 and CPT2 meet at a crossroads between the
disordered disk, the polarized vortex and the expanding
state; CPT2 stretches beyond that meeting point into
regimes which are held together by viscosity’s countering
of the mutual repulsion of particles. For α > 1, and β just
above CPT1, polarized vortices are always observed. In
fact, just above CPT1, all particles are circulating in the
same direction. Increasing β, at constant α, the number
of counter rotating particles grows steadily till the polarized vortex is destabilized, in three possible ways, depending on the value of α: 1) The polarized vortex breaks
up into droplets (mostly two) rotating in the same direction, with a small fraction of particles moving erratically
in the opposite direction. Increasing β, the number of
droplets increases, with nearly as many droplets rotating
in one direction as the other. Looking at larger values
of β, the droplets can either go directly to the expansion
state or, and for a small α interval, they become more
elongated and pass through the vortex state before breaking up and expanding. 2) The polarized vortex morphs
directly into a regular vortex and then to an expanding state. 3) The polarized vortex transitions directly to

4
the expansion state; here, and very close to CPT2, we
find mixed states–that is states in which a small fraction of particles expands while the other forms a special
vortex [21]. Transitions among the organized states are
harder to identify numerically, better handled through a
careful stability analysis in a mean field approach to the
problem, and are only roughly determined in the current study [22]. On the other hand, transitions across
CPT1 and CPT2 are discontinuous, and reminiscent of
the first order phase transitions of equilibrium statistical
mechanics. To better clarify this character, we define an
order parameter L =< r|θ̇| >, the bracket indicating an
average over all the particles in a given steady state. L
is nearly equal to zero in the expanding state, tends to
2
π ≈ 0.636 for a completely random state, and 1 for vortex like dynamics. Following L with β, for fixed α, we
observe the system in Fig. 3 undergoing the two sharp
transitions, from random to organized, and from organized to expanding. For α > 2.7, the swarm transitions
directly from the disordered to the expansion state.

Axial symmetry was assumed, and self-consistent field
equations were solved numerically by an iterative procedure for various temperatures and interaction parameter α at fixed λ=2/3. In a fairly broad temperature
range two stable solutions exist: one with an almost uniform low density, corresponding to the gas phase, and the
other with a large density near the center and extremely
low density at the periphery, corresponding to the liquid
droplet phase. Intriguingly, stable droplet solutions exist
only within the catastrophic regime α < (3/2)3 .
In order to analyze thermodynamic stability we calculate the Helmholtz free energy for each solution (phase)

The order parameter < r|θ̇| > is plotted against β. The graph
was obtained for N = 1000, λ = 2/3, and α = 1.275.

To clarify the nature of some of the transitions observed, we undertake a study of a thermodynamic analogy of the self-propelling system.
It is clear from the phase diagram that one of the control parameters, β, has the meaning of the ratio of the
typical kinetic energy to the potential energy per particle. In the thermodynamic analogy,we consider a system
with exactly the same interaction, but the kinetic energy
is controlled by temperature instead of the self-propulsion
to viscosity ratio. Consider the canonical ensemble description of a system of N particles with pair interaction
specified by Eq. 2 enclosed in a circular box of radius
R and kept at temperature T . Thermodynamic properties are treated in the self-consistent field approximation.
According to the standard formulation of the variational
mean field theory [23] the density is related to the meanfield potential by

The velocity-related contribution is the same for both
phases and will not be considered explicitly. The solution with the lower free energy corresponds to thermodynamic equilibrium while the other solution can be associated with a metastable phase. Upon approaching certain
temperature, a solution may lose it iterative stability and
eventually disappear. In the language of thermodynamics, this would mean reaching the spinodal line. Temperature dependence of the two branches of the free energy
is shown in Fig. 4(a).
The fact that two branches of the free energy cross is
typical of classical first order transitions. However, in
contrast to standard situations simultaneous coexistence
of two phases is impossible. Each of the two solutions describes the system as a whole while, say, a 50-50 mixture
of uniform gas and liquid droplet is not a self-consistent
solution at all. This is why the transition temperature is
defined from the condition that the two phases have equal
total free energies rather than from equality of chemical
potentials. We recall that another distinction of the current situation is that a standard thermodynamic limit is
not very meaningful. However, from a pragmatic point
of view, first order transitions in finite systems can still
be defined if there are two distinct states with the free
energies that are large on the T scale and cross as functions of some control parameter. Phase transitions in
an isolated macromolecule are conceptually close to the
situation studied here, [24]
We make a connection with the dynamic system by
equating mvt 2 and T (Boltzmann constant is 1) since

(a)) to a constant, external force field. Such a polarized
flock does not emerge for any field strength. In fact, a
discontinuous transition, from random to polarized, occurs as the strength of the external field, f~ext , is increased
past a critical value (which naturally depends on the initial phase of the swarm (i.e. on the swarm’s λ, α, and
PN
β). The center of mass speed: ω = | i=1 v~i |/(N vmax )
(normalized by vmax , the maximum speed in the swarm),
is a suitable order parameter for the transition from disordered disk (ω = 0), to polarized flock (ω = 1), which is
clearly illustrated in Fig. 5(c).

the system is 2-dimensional, so that β = T /N λWa .
The transition line in the (α, Logβ) coordinates is presented in Fig. 4(b) together with two spinodal lines for
N =1000, λ=2/3, and R = 30la . Separate calculations
with a different number of particles N =500 confirm that
our choice of β and α as scaling parameters yield a universal N -independent phase diagram. There is a weak
(logarithmic) effect of the box radius R on the transition
temperature which is naturally related to the entropy of
the gas phase, but further elaboration of the thermodynamic model is the subject of future work.
It is clear that the gas-droplet transition line resembles
closely the CPT2 line separating the expanding and the
ordered states. This gives a strong support to the claim
that the transitions in the dynamic system are indeed a
direct analogy to phase transitions. Analysis of the dynamic analogy of the metastable thermodynamic states
would involve a study of the attractor basins in the phase
space and is beyond the scope of the present paper. The
thermodynamic system does not support dynamically organized states, nor do we observe a transition analogous
to the CPT1 line. A system of self-propelled particles
can be highly organized in the momentum space which is
impossible for a classical system of interacting particles
in the canonical ensemble where Maxwell’s distribution
is inavoidable. Note, however, that the current statements concerning the thermodynamic system are based
only on the results of the self-consistent field approximation, while the true ordering in the coordinate space may
be more intricate.
We conclude our discussion of critical phase transitions
with a brief mention of an interesting phenomenon, which
is analogous to the notorious swarm to flock transition,
and which, unlike the self-promoted transitions seen in
this and other instances in the literature, occurs in the
presence of an external, uniform, force field. Fig. 5 (b)
shows a polarized flock in which all particles are traveling
with the same velocity, a state which resulted by subjecting a disordered disk state of our model (seen in Fig. 5

In summary, we have succeeded in constructing a phase
diagram that captures, in one fell swoop, the global structure of steady 2D configurations, in a deterministic model
of coupled self-propelled particles. Through a systematic
numerical exploration of the model’s parameter space,
we have identified novel types of collective behavior such
as rings, droplets, special vortices, disordered disks, and
expanding states; we have shown that transitions from
disordered to ordered, then from ordered to expanding
state, have the structure of discontinuous, “first order”,
phase transitions (in line with the results of [25], which
attribute the continuous transitions reported by [10] to
finite-size effects); we have supported the phase transition analysis by studying a thermodynamic analogy
where a temperature-driven transition from a gas to a
condensed liquid droplet is observed and matches closely
the transition from ordered to expanded state; finally, we
have shown that a disordered swarm, when subjected to
an external uniform field, transitions to a polarized flock,
once again in a discontinuous manner. The genericity of
discontinuous phase transitions, the stability and evolution of organized states, the surface tension and shape
dynamics of swarms, are the subject of ongoing work. In
the mean time, the constructed phase diagram offers a
promising geography for experimental verification, and
refinement, or at worst, falsification of this class of models. In particular, the same bacteria which stimulated an

6
earlier investigation of model vortices [12], could perhaps
be stimulated into transitions from disordered motion, to
polarized vortex, to droplets, or vortex, by judicious selection and control of population size, medium resistance,
concentrations of chemo-attractants/repellents, external
drivers...etc. As evident in Fig. 2, an order of magnitude
increase in population size (decrease in β) is expected to
bring about the disintegration of a colony, initially organized in a polarized vortex, into a disordered disk, and
this over a range of interaction potentials (of αs); similar effects could result from a slowing down of particles
in the colony (through increased friction and/or reduced
self-propulsion); an increasing concentration of chemoattractants (a decreasing α) may push an initially vortical colony closer to a ring state [26]. We look forward
to exchanges with experimentalists around this model’s
phase diagram, in the hope that similar systematic (not
to say exhaustive) explorations of macroscopic phases of
collective motion in the lab, together with the model improvements that they will surely stimulate, may eventually pave the way to a refined characterization of the notoriously elusive (at times microscopic) mechanical properties of coupled, self-propelled living organisms.

initial conditions; here it arises naturally from random
initial conditions.

[21] All the states refered to here are steady states solutions
reached by starting from random initially conditions, and
not by following a relaxed state with slowly changing
parameters.
[22] The ring state (existence, radius, and stability) is nicely
handled in a mean-field approach, through which the dynamics reduces to that of coupled limit cycles (see [27] for
further details). These results along with, a more elaborate treatment of the dynamics of coupled limit cycles,
the organized states that are captured through it, and
their stability analysis, will constitute the subject of an
upcoming work [28].

[26] The experiments of [4] in which, interestingly enough,
bacterial colonies evolve from a disk into a ring state
when exposed to UV radiation, offer a promising setting
in which the evolution of phases of collective motion with
population size, medium resistance and chemoattractant
concentration, may be fruitfully studied.
