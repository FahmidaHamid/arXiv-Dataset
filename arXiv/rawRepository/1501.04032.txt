Mean Time-to-Fire for the Noisy LIF Neuron
A detailed derivation of the Siegert Formula

January 16, 2015

Abstract
When stimulated by a very large number of Poisson-like presynaptic current input spikes, the temporal
dynamics of the soma membrane potential V (t) of a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is typically modeled
in the diffusion limit and treated as a Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP). When the potential reaches a
threshold value θ, V (t) = θ, the LIF neuron fires and the membrane potential is reset to a resting value,
V0 < θ, and clamped to this value for a specified (non-stochastic) absolute refractory period Tr ≥ 0, after
which the cycle is repeated. The time between firings is given by the random variable Tf = Tr + T where T
is the random time which elapses between the “unpinning” of the membrane potential clamp and the next,
subsequent firing of the neuron. The mean time-to-fire, Tbf = E(Tf ) = Tr + E(T ) = Tr + Tb, provides a
measure ρ of the average firing rate of the neuron,
ρ = Tbf−1 =

Tr + Tb

.

This note briefly discusses some aspects of the OUP model and derives the Siegert formula giving the firing
rate, ρ = ρ(I0 ) as a function of an injected current, I0 . This is a well-known classical result and no claim to
originality is made. The derivation of the firing rate given in this report, which closely follows the derivation
outlined by Gardiner [6], minimizes the required mathematical background and is done in some pedagogic
detail to facilitate study by graduate students and others who are new to the subject. Knowledge of the
material presented in the first five chapters of Gardiner [6] should provide an adequate background for
following the derivation given in this note.

Background

Simple phenomenological models of the dynamical depolarization behavior of the membrane potential, V (t),
of a neuron often separate its behavior into two phases: (1) an analytically tractable “subthreshold” behavior,
which describes the behavior until a threshold membrane potential value, V (t) = θ, is attained. (2) At which
point an action potential spike is triggered, followed by an absolute refractory period after which the cycle
repeats itself.
In particular, the leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model assumes that the depolarization dynamics in the
subthreshold regime of the part of the soma responsible for spike generation behaves like a linear RC circuit,

This assumption is consistent with the fact that averaging over a length of a cylindrical neuron membrane
yields this behavior as a low-order approximation [20, 22]. For mammalian neurons a typical time-constant
value is τ ∼ 5–10 msec [20, 18]. The constant membrane reversal (aka, equilibrium) potential is denoted by
Vr .
Notwithstanding the gross simplification that occurs from the use of the LIF, additional significant
approximation issues occur due to the nature of the stochastic assumptions that are made on the afferent
currents which comprise the components of the membrane current I. Generally we can write,
I(t) = Ie (t) + Iint + Isyn ,
where Ie (t) is an externally injected current for experimental or control purposes, Iint represents internal or
internal noise which is generally neglected,1 while Isyn represents the summed effect of all of the afferent
“upstream” neurons which are sending spikes to the neuron across synaptic clefts. Ignoring the intrinsic
noise and treating the injected noise as constant on the time-scale of interest, I(t) = I0 , we have,
Nsyn

I(t) = I0 + Isyn = I0 +

X

ej Ij (t),

(2)

j=1

where j indexes one of the Nsun synapses, Ij (t) is a current induced at the j synapse by presynaptic
stimulation, and ej is the synaptic efficacy of the j synapse which is positive for input from an excitatory
presynaptic neuron and negative for an inhibitory presynaptic neuron. As many researchers have noted
[4, 8, 12, 21, 22, 2, 7, 11] at the finest time scale one cannot ignore the fact that each Ij (t) is effectively a
spike train.2 However it is much more difficult to analyze a spiking stimulus than one that has continuous
sample paths.
For this reason, as discussed in the aforementioned references, it is commonly argued that for neuronal
ensembles that operate in the limit of high impinging spiking rates (relative to the membrane time constant)
and small per-spike efficacies (relative to the magnitude of the spiking threshold magnitude) one can approximate a spiking point process which is assumed to have independent increments by a diffusive, continuous
sample path Wiener process (aka Brownian motion). And indeed, such arguments can at times be made
rigorous [4, 12, 6, 23]. The diffusion approximation is made by matching the mean and variance of a input
spike train to the drift (local mean) and intensity (local variance) of a Wiener process. In particular, if each
of the input current spike trains represented by Ij (t) is a stationary poisson renewal process with rate λj ,
we have (see, e.g., [21]),
X
X
e2j λj

ej λj and s2syn = Var {Isyn (t)} =
Ibsyn = E {Isyn (t)} =

The practical reasonableness of approximating Isyn (t) by a Wiener process with this (local) mean and variance
is discussed in [2, 11].

An additional problem arises because in order to model Isyn by a continuous sample path Wiener process, it should be an independent increment process. However, there are capacitive dynamics at work in the
synapses which induce correlations. To rigorously model such effects is onerous, so an additional approximation is usually made. In addition to assuming that the spike trains impinging on the soma are a Wiener
process, it is also assumed that the capacitive time constants at the synapses are fast compared to the time
constant of the soma membrane. This assumption can also be problematic (see the discussions in [11, 3]).
Suffice it to say, that in this note we do make the following huge simplifications for purposes of mathematical
tractability:
1 Internal, intrinsic noise is thermal noise (Johnson or Nyquist noise), “shot noise” (due to ions clumping up as they pass
through channels) and channel noise due to the stochastic natures of the opening and closing of large numbers of channel pores
on the neuronal membrane. Even taken collectively, such noise affects are usually (but not always) of low order compared to
the other terms.
2 The resulting model is known as the Stein Model [16, 17, 21, 22].

• We assume that we can model the firing behavior of a neuron by the simple LIF model given by Eq. (1).
• We assume that the collective effect of the presynaptic spike trains impinging on the neuron can be
model by an independent increment Wiener process.
• We assume that the capacitive effects of synaptic and dendritic accumulation and processing of the
spike trains are negligible.
To assemble the above pieces into the complete model which we will use in the sequel, define the zero
mean process and unit variance process,

To gain a further degree of abstraction, we set X = V and W = Iesyn (t) where W denotes the standard (zero
mean and unit intensity) Wiener process. More generally, β can also depend on the state X(t), β = β(X).
The model,
p
dX(t) = α(X(t)) + β(X(t)) dW (t),
(6)
is known as a stochastic differential equation [6, 23] and has to be interpreted according to the rules of a
stochastic calculus.3 Our particular model with an affine drift term

α1 = κ > 0,

(7)

and state-independent intensity,
β(X) = β0 = σ 2 > 0,

(8)

is known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP),
dX(t) = µ − κ X(t) + σ dW (t).

(9)

If in addition a firing threshold with reset (after a possible refractory period) is enforced, we obtain the OUP
Leaky integrate-and-fire model, which we also refer to as the OUP/LIF neuron.
The LIF neuron fires when V (t) = θ. The first-passage time to threshold, Tθ , beginning from a membrane
voltage reset value V (t0 ) = v0 at initial time t = 0 is defined by,

Tθ = Tθ (v0 ) = inf{t  V (t) = θ, V (t0 ) = v0 < θ}.
3 The standard ones being the Ito Calculus and the Stratonovic Calculus [6, 23]. This distinction vanishes for the OrnsteinUhlenbeck process (OUP), which is the situation under consideration. Because our analysis is based on the use of the FokkerPlanck diffusion equations, the stochastic calculus is not used in this note.

Note that under our model, T is a random variable. For the model under consideration in this note, i.e. the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), we desire to know if the neuron will fire in finite time with probability
one as well as the mean time to fire. Note that if there is a finite probability that the neuron will never fire in
finite time, then the mean time to fire must be infinite as T = ∞ will have a nonzero probability of occurring.
Thus, as noted by [21] one should always first ascertain that a neuron will fire (or not) in finite time with
probability one. As noted in the abstract (and discussed below) knowledge of the mean time-to-fire provides
a measure of the firing rate of the neuron.
Although we have indicated, and will continue to indicate, the dependence of the passage time T on the
threshold value θ and the initialization (i.e., the reset) voltage v0 , in fact we are interested in its dependence
on the injected current I0 which is our parameter of control to affect the firing behavior of the neuron, so
we will write variously T = Tθ (v0 ) = Tθ (v0 , I0 ) = T (I0 ), etc.
The goal of this note is to demonstrate that the OUP/LIF has a finite passage time with probability one,
so that the neuron is almost surely guaranteed to fire in a finite time, and to derive its mean first passage
as a function of the injected current I0 , the reset voltage V (t0 ) = v0 , and the threshold value θ which in
turn allows us to determine the mean firing rate as a function of these quantities and the absolute refractory
period Tr . At the price of some inelegance, the derivation is kept as simple has possible in order to be
accessible to a wider range of students and nonspecialists.4 An attempt has been made to be thorough and
detailed, and therefore many derivation steps are given which are often left out of the published literature
and textbooks.

2.1

SDEs, FPEs and the First-Passage Time
Stochastic Differential Equations and the Fokker-Planck Equation

As motivated in the prior discussion, we are interested in the dynamical behavior of the homogeneous
stochastic differential equation (SDE),
SDE :

dX(t) = α(X(t))dt +

p

β(X(t)) dW (t)

t≥0

(10)

where W is a standard Wiener process. With the assumption that the initial condition X(0) is (possibly
degenerate) gaussian and independent of W , this describes the behavior of a continuous sample path, homogeneous Markov process.5 Although we are primarily interested in the behavior of the OUP, we will keep
the development fairly general and only specialize to the OUP towards the end of the note.
Eq. (10) provides a local description of the behavior of a diffusion process. There are many global
solutions consistent with this local behavior, each one determined by the imposition of initial and boundary
conditions. The Markov process (10) takes continuous values and therefore, once appropriate initial and
boundary conditions have been imposed, has a behavior which is described by a transition probability
4 In particular we avoid, or minimize, the discussion of moment generating functions; Laplace transforms and complex
analysis; stochastic differential equations; the theory of the Sturm-Liouville problem; the theory of integral equations; and the
theory of diffusion process boundary conditions, all of which have utility in a rigorous analysis of the first passage time problem
[1, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Knowledge of the behavior of a first-order scalar stochastic dynamical system as described in the
first 5 chapters of the textbook by Gardiner should provide an adequate background for following the development given in this
note.
5 The process is homogeneous because the α(x) and β(x) are independent of the time, t.

and it is the imposition of initial conditions (at t = t0 ) and boundary conditions that determines which
particular solution is obtained. In particular, if consistent sets of initial and boundary conditions are correctly
chosen for the stochastic differential equation Eq. (10) and for the FPE Eq. (13), the solution to Eq. (13) will
correctly describe the stochastic behavior of Eq. (10) and satisfy the corresponding CKE (11). In particular

known as the (forward) diffusion equation, the forward Kolmogorov equation, and the Smoluchowski equation.
equivalence between Eq.s (10) and (12) holds in general under the rules of the Ito stochastic calculus. In general
the equivalence does not hold under the rules of the Stratonovich calculus. Although most authors and researchers work
primarily within the Ito formalism (e.g., [6, 23]) some adhere to the Stratonovich formalism (e.g. [8]), which can potentially
cause confusion when comparing results across various source texts and papers. However, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,
which is the model under consideration in this note, fortuitously has the same behavior under both the Ito and Stratonovich
interpretations [6].
9 It is possible to place alternative and/or additional conditions on the behavior of the solution f (x, t) at x = ±∞, depending
on the nature of the solution one is looking for [8, 6, 23].
10 Note that the normalization condition is sufficient for the previous boundary conditions at x = ±∞. One reason to decouple
the two conditions is that under some alternative boundary conditions reasonable solutions can satisfy

to the solution of the FPE (13) will result in a transition density p(x, tx0 , t0 ) that correctly describes the
stochastic behavior, X(t), t ≥ 0, of Eq. (10), provided the latter has been subjected to the initial condition
X(t0 ) = x0 with no other conditions imposed on X(t).11 On the other hand, if one applies the initial condition
f (x, t0 ) = p(x, t0 ), subject to the same boundary conditions, one obtains the solution f (x, t) = p(x, t). Below,
we will discuss other important solutions to the FPE, as well as to the backward FPE which is to be discussed
next.
Within the interior of an admissible open state space region of the SDE (10), the sample paths system
are all continuous, provided that α(·) and β(·) are reasonably well-behaved functions of their arguments.
This means that the solutions to the FPE, and its variants discussed below, will assumed to be continuous
functions of their space and time arguments within the interior of the state space. Of course, once the
state X(t) hits the threshold value θ, which is a boundary of the state space interior, there is a radical,
discontinuous reset of the state value,
X(θ) → X(t0 ) = x0 < θ.

2.2

The Homogeneous Backward and Mixed Fokker-Planck Equations

The density satisfying the CKE also satisfies the backward Fokker-Planck equation (BFPE),
BFPE :

−

∂
1
∂2
∂
p(x, t|x0 , t0 ) = α(x)
p(x, t|x0 , t0 ) + β(x) 2 p(x, t|x0 , t0 )
∂t0
∂x0
2
∂x0

(16)

In this equation x and t are fixed (i.e., the final state and time are treated as parameters) and x0 and t0
are treated independent variables subject to the constraint t0 ≤ t. If the SDE (10) is subject to the initial
condition X(t0 ) = x0 and is otherwise unrestricted, then its stochastic behavior is described by the solution
to (16) which satisfies the final condition (FC),
p(x, t|x0 , t) = δ(x0 − x).
This equation is often presented in a slightly different form in the homogeneous case which we are
considering in this note.12 Homogeneity means that for all τ ,
p(x, t′ + τ |x0 , t′0 + τ ) = p(x, t′ |x0 , t′0 ).
In particular, for τ = −t′0 , and elapsed time t = t′ − t′0 , we have,
p(x, t|x0 , 0) = p(x, 0|x0 , −t).
Taking making the assignments t0 = −t and t = 0 in the left-hand-side of Eq. (16), we have,
−

∂
∂
∂
∂
p(x, t|x0 , t0 ) → −
p(x, 0|x0 , −t) = p(x, 0|x0 , −t) = p(x, t|x0 , 0).
∂t0
∂(−t)
∂t
∂t

Thus if we define,
g(y, t) = p(x, t|y, 0),
the homogenous BFPE can be rewritten as the mixed Fokker-Planck equation (MFPE),
MFPE :

1
∂2
∂
g(y, t) = α(y) g(y, t) + β(y) 2 g(y, t)

(17)

11 This is called the unrestricted case as no limitations are placed on the values taken by the state X(t) for t > t . Note that
0
the general solution involves x0 and t0 as “free parameters.”
12 It should be noted that a stationary process is necessarily homogenous. (However, a homogenous process is not necessarily
stationary, unless special initial conditions have been chosen or the process is considered in the asymptotic limit t → ∞ given
certain stability assumptions.)

6

Note that in Eq. (17) t is the (“forward”) time which has elapsed since the initial time t0 = 0 and y is the
value at the (“backward”) initial time, X(0) = y.13 This variant of the BFPE can be found amply utilized
in references which primarily focus on the homogenous case (e.g., [15, 5, 8]) as well as in other sources (see,
e.g., Eq. (5.5.5) of [6]).
Because Eq. (17) has an independent parameter, t, that refers to the future (forward) time and an
independent parameter that refers to the current (or backward) initial condition y = X(0), we call Eq. (17)
the mixed Fokker-Planck equation (MFPE) in order to distinguish it from the (forward) FPE (13) and the
BFPE (16). It is important to recognize the distinct differences between these three equations.
Under the appropriately consistent initial and boundary conditions the solutions to the FPE, BFPE, and
MFPE are equal and describe the stochastic behavior of the SDE (10). In particular, we are interested in
the initial conditions for the FPEs which correspond to X(0) = y,14
ICs :

f (x, 0) = p(x, 0|y, 0) = g(y, 0) = δ(x − y)

(18)

As all three variants of the FPE yield the same solution for the transition density function, p(x, t|y, 0), we
are free to use the one which is of greatest convenience given the nature of α(·), β(·), and the boundary
conditions. Note that the solutions to the FPE’s obtained via the use of the ICs (18) have tacit dependencies;
specifically f (x, t) tacitly depends on y while g(y, t) tacitly depends on x. In the sequel it will be useful to
make these dependencies notationally overt via the definitions,
f (x, t) = fy (x, t) = f (x, t; y) and g(y, t) = gx (y, t) = g(y, t; x).

2.3

The First Passage Time

Consider the case where as long as X(t) ∈ S, for some open, connected subset of the reals, S ⊂ R, its
dynamical behavior is described by the SDE (10). If S = R, we say that the SDE is unrestricted, whereas if S
is a proper subset of the reals, we say that it is restricted. A standard choice is an open internal, Sa,θ = (a, θ).
Our primary interest is with the case when a → −∞,
S = Sθ = (−∞, θ).
Because the SDE (10) models a diffusion process, it has continuous sample paths, and thus the only way that
X(t) can exit the admissible state space S is to hit the upper limit θ at some passage time15 t′ , X(t′ ) = θ.
In the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron, as soon as (i.e., the first time that ) X(t) “escapes from”
the region S, the neuron fires (an impulse is generated and sent to downstream neurons) and the dynamics
represented by the SDE (10) is “turned off” for a (deterministic) duration, Tr chosen to model the absolute
refractory period of the neuron, after which the clock is reset to zero, t = t0 = 0, and the neuron is reset to
its initialization value, X(0) = x0 . The process repeats itself indefinitely.
Once the neuron is reset the dynamical behavior (10) is allowed to run in an unrestricted manner until
the threshold θ is reached. Thus one is interested in the first passage time. This is defined as,

	
T = TS (x0 ) = inf tX(t) 6∈ S, X(0) = x0 ∈ S
13 In

terms of the notation used in Eq. (12), Eq. (17) is

∂
∂
1
∂2
p(x, t|x0 , 0) = α(x0 )
p(x, t|x0 , 0) + β(x0 ) 2 p(x, t|x0 , 0).

∂x0
2
∂x0
14 Because of the assumption of homogeneity, henceforth, with no loss of generality, we take t = 0, and henceforth we will
0
always take t ≥ 0.
15 Also known as a hitting time, an exit time, an escape time, or a (gambler’s) ruin time.

7

For our situation of interest, we have

	
T = Tθ (x0 ) = inf tX(t) = θ, X(0) = x0 < θ .

The time between firings is given by the random variable Tf = Tr + T where T is the random time which
elapses between the “unpinning” of the membrane potential clamp and the next, subsequent firing of the
neuron, as just defined. The mean time-to-fire (MTF),
Tbf = E(Tf ) = Tr + E(T ) = Tr + Tb,

provides a measure ρ of the average firing rate (AFR) of the neuron,
ρ = Tbf−1 =

1
Tr + Tb

.

The primary goal of this note is to derive the mean passage time (MPT),
Tb = Tbθ (x0 ) = E{Tθ (x0 )},

for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP) in a greater degree of detail than is easily found in the literature.

2.4

The MFPE for the Restricted, Subthreshold Dynamics

Because until the state X(t) reaches the threshold value θ the local “subthreshold” dynamics are modeled
by the SDE (10), its local, stochastic behavior until it escapes from the set S is completely captured by the
FPEs. Indeed, it’s entire stochastic behavior within the the interior of the region S is captured by the FPEs.
What distinguishes the global solution to the FPEs for the restricted behavior (X(t) confined to S) from the
global solution for the unrestricted behavior (X(t) free to take any value in R) are not the FPE’s themselves
(they after all describe the same local motions within the the interior of the set S for both the restricted
and unrestricted cases) but rather the boundary conditions which are applied to the FPEs (because the
difference between the two cases arises when the restricted motion bumps up against the boundary).
To handle the “bumping up” against the boundary θ which turns off the dynamics, we imagine that the
SDE (10) describes the behavior of a brownian motion particle that is absorbed (“vanishes”) as soon as it
hits the position θ, never to return again.16 The theory of boundary conditions for Markov and diffusion
processes is discussed at length in many places (see, e.g., [8, 6]); suffice it to say that for our purposes it
is enough to know that the appropriate boundary conditions to enforce in the FPE (13) and the MFPE
(17) if one is interested in solving for the transition density function are the respective absorbing boundary
conditions,
ABCs :

f (θ, t) = p(θ, t|x0 , 0) = 0

and g(θ, t) = p(x, t|θ, 0) = 0

(19)

The first condition says that the probability of being at θ is zero (because once you step there, you vanish)
and the second condition says that once you’ve vanished, you never return to anywhere (because you’ve
vanished for good). Because a diffusion processes is continuous, these conditions imply that,

Prob X(t) ≥ θX(0) = x0 = 0 and Prob X(t)X(0) = x0 ≥ θ = 0.

As described in a variety of sources, the BFPE is particularly useful for solving passage time problems
[8, 12, 21, 23, 6], particularly in the guise of the MFPE variant given by Eq. (17) above [15, 5, 8, 6].17 In

is the probability distribution function for the restricted processes X(t). Because Eq. (21) describes the
behavior of a continuous sample path diffusion motion, the density function gx (y, t) and the distribution
function Gx (y, t) are continuous functions of x, y and t within the interior of the state space.

Moments of the First Passage Time

The development in this section closely follows that of Section 5.5.1 of [6]. However, as noted in [21] there
are some additional subtle points to be addressed in the derivation of the passage time moments.18
Note from the development in the previous section that,19

	
Prob T = Tθ (y) > t = Gθ (y, t) =

−∞

Thus the distribution function of T is given by,20

	

	
Qθ (y, t) = Prob T = Tθ (y) ≤ t = 1 − Prob T = Tθ (y) > t = 1 − Gθ (y, t).

Having obtained the passage time distribution function Qθ (y, t) we can compute the passage time probability
density function as,21,22
qθ (y, t) =

From the assumed continuity of Gx (y, t) and gx (y, t), Qθ (y, t) and qθ (y, t) are similarly continuous.
Note that the condition,
Qθ (y, ∞) = lim Qθ (y, t) = 1 ∀y ,
t→∞

(24)

18 Both [8] and [21] stress the importance of ascertaining that the probability of a finite passage time be one in order to claim
that a neuron will reliably fire when stimulated. In addition, a probability-one finite mean passage time provides a technical
justification for a seemingly minor, yet key, step made in the development given in [6].
19 Note that G (y, 0) = 1 for all y < θ and that G (y, t) = 0 for y ≥ θ. In particular, G (θ, t) = 0.

9

if it holds, means precisely that the first passage time is finite, and therefore neuron will fire in finite time,
with probability one regardless of the initialization state. Therefore we will spend some time to verify this
fact for the OUP neuron.
What does it mean if Qθ (y, ∞) < 1? It is a property of probability measures that they can be decomposed
into a continuous part (like Qθ (y, t)), represented by continuous probability density functions, like
qθ (y, t) =

∂
Qθ (y, t),
∂t

which have no jumps, and a discrete, “atomic” part that places nonzero probability mass on discrete points
[10].23 If Q(θ (y, ∞) = 1, then Q(θ (y, t) is a distribution which describes a completely continuous random
variable, T , that with probability one takes a finite value T = t, 0 < T < ∞. On the other hand, if
Qθ (y, ∞) < 1, then with probability,
Gθ (y, ∞) = 1 − Qθ (y, ∞),

the threshold θ will not be hit in any finite time, which means that there must be a discrete, atomic amount
(equal to 1 − Qθ (y, ∞)) of probability mass (conceptually) located at t = ∞. In this latter case there is a
nonzero probability that the neuron will never fire.24
We do assume that, for each y, limt→∞ Qθ (y, t) = Qθ (y, ∞) converges to a constant value that is independent of t.25 And if
Z ∞
qθ (y, t)dt
Qθ (y, ∞) =
0

converges, it must be the case that,26

qθ (y, ∞) = 0.

(25)

Note that Eq. (24) is true if and only if
Gθ (y, ∞) = lim Gθ (y, t) = 0,
t→∞

∀y .

(26)

Although condition (26) is often assumed to be true,27 as noted in [21] this is a key property28 that ideally
should be verified. Of course, (26) can always just be assumed to be true.29 Indeed, we will do just that by
(temporarily) assuming a stronger condition, namely that the convergence of Gθ (y, t) obeys,
lim tn Gθ (y, t) = 0 ,

t→∞

∀y ,

(27)

for specific values of n ≥ 0. When such assumptions are made, we will be very careful to note them.30
To demonstrate an application of the condition (27), we first define the moments of the first passage time
random variable T = Tθ (y) by

23 There is also a third, mathematically abstract,“singular” part which is not encountered when dealing with phenomena in
the physical world.
24 For an example of a model neuron that has a nonzero probability of never firing, see the example on page 142 of [21].
25 We prove later that Q (y, ∞) ≤ 1.
θ
26 Thus we have that q (y, 0) = q (y, ∞) = 0 for y < θ. We can have q (y, ∞) = 0 and yet have a nonzero probability mass at
θ
θ
θ
t = ∞ because qθ (y, t) represents the purely continuous part of the T -distribution. It is unfortunately the case that egregiously
using qθ (y, ∞) in place of the more accurate limt→∞ qθ (y, t) can be misleading: qθ (y, ∞) does not represent probability mass
at infinity, but rather the probability density on the way to infinity.
27 For example, see Equation (5.5.16) of [6].
28 Equivalent to the probability one finite passage time condition (24).
29 And then hopefully verified after the fact, thereby demonstrating that a self-consistent derivation has occurred.
30 Eventually we will replace the condition (27) with the finite moments condition (43).

10

Note, in particular, that the “zeroth moment”, m0 , has already been encountered,
m0 (θ, y) = Qθ (y, ∞) = 1 − Gθ (y, ∞),
and gives the total probability that the first passage time from the initial state y is finite. As we have noted,
m0 (θ, y) = 1 for all y

⇐⇒

Gθ (y, ∞) = 0 for all y.

To compute higher order moments, mn (θ, y) from Eq. (28), it is useful to note that,
∂ n
∂
t Gθ (y, t)dt = tn Gθ (y, t)dt + n tn−1 Gθ (y, t)dt
∂t
∂t
so that integrating the last integral on the far right hand side of (28) by parts yields

mn (θ, y) = n
t→∞

(29)

For n = 0, this yields,
m0 (θ, y) = Gθ (y, 0) − Gθ (y, ∞) = 1 − Gθ (y, ∞),

mn (θ, y) = n

m0 (θ, y) = Qθ (y, ∞) = 1 ⇐⇒ Gθ (y, ∞) = 0

(37)

for all y, and then with probability one the first passage time is finite. We will see below that this is true
for the OUP.33
Now assume that condition (27) holds for n = 1,
lim t Gθ (y, t) = 0,

∀y.

Then (31) holds for n = 1, yielding the following expression for the mean first passage time,

31 Differential equations that can be solved in this manner, i.e., via successive integrations, are said to be “solvable by

32 Note that the right hand side verifies (27) for n = 0.
33 That this holds for the OUP is also discussed on page 171 of [21].

The recursion (40) is straightforward to derive for n ≥ 1,35 assuming,Rfor now, that (27) holds for the desired

values of n. This is done by integrating all terms in Eq. (32) by −n 0 tn−1 ( · )dt, to obtain,

which from Eq. (28) and (31) immediately yields the moments recursion (40).
There is an alternative derivation of (40) that will allow us to replace the assumption that (27) holds
with the assumption of the existence of the passage time moments.36 Because,
qθ (y, t) = −

we have that Eq. (33) yields the first passage time diffusion equation (FPTDE) for the first passage time

34 This recursion is given as Eq. (6.5) in [5]. For now it assumes that condition (27) holds, though this will be slightly weakened
below and then replaced by the sufficient condition that the moments are assumed to exist.
35 The case n = 0 has been handled separately above.
36 The assumption of finite moments is the standard one encountered in the literature [5]. As mentioned previously assumption
(27) is used Rin [6].

(42)

a condition which should be compared to condition (27). Condition (42) is equivalent to the condition,

A sufficient condition for Eq. (42) to hold, is that the n-th first passage time moment exist,
Z ∞
tn qθ (y, t)dt < ∞.
mn (θ, y) =
0

We have thus demonstrated the standard sufficient condition for recursion (40):
Sufficient Condition for the Darling & Siegert Moments Recursion to hold [5]
Assume that m0 (θ, y) = 1. If all first passage time moments exist for n ≤ n0 ,
mn (θ, y) < ∞,

(43)

then the Darling & Siegert Moments Recursion (40) is valid for n ≤ n0 .
To actually verify condition (43) in an a priori manner is usually nontrivial. It involves analytical and/or
numerical knowledge of qθ (y, t) which is obtained from solving the diffusion equation (41). This is generally
a difficult task [1, 14]. Because of the difficulty in verifying (43), we will henceforth assume that all first
passage time n–th degree moments, n ≥ 1, of interest exist.
A necessary condition that moments exist for n ≥ 1 is that m0 (θ, y) = 1. This is because if m0 (θ, y) < 1,
there must be nonzero probability mass at infinity which would case all moments n ≥ 1 to be infinite.39 So
ideally, at the very least, one should verify that m0 (θ, y) = 1. We do this for the OUP model in the next
subsection.
38 It is weaker because for the moments recursion (40) to hold for the n-th moment on the right hand side, it is now sufficient
for (27) to hold for only n − 1.
39 This is discussed in [21].

14

We can solve Eq. (40) to obtain a recursive formula expressing the moment mn (θ, y) in terms of the lower
order moment mn−1 (θ, y). To do so let mn (y) = mn (θ, y) and define,
m′n (y) =

∂
mn (y),
∂y

a(y) = 2

α(y)
β(y)

and b(y) = −2n

mn−1 (y)
.
β(y)

Then (for fixed θ) Eq. (40) becomes,
d ′
m (y) + a(y)m′n (y) = b(y).
dy n

(44)

This is a linear, inhomogenous first-order differential equation that can be solved by the standard method of
variation of parameters. The general solution is the sum of a particular solution, ψp (y), and a homogeneous
solution, C0 ψ(y), where C0 is a constant to be determined. For the homogeneous case, we have,
d
ψ(y) + a(y)ψ(y) = 0,

to bring the parameter ℓ into the foreground in order to obtain sensible answers.

2.6

Mean First Passage Time for the OUP

We now use the theory developed in the previous section to show that the first passage time is finite with
probability one and to compute the mean first passage time for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process (OUP),
which is given by the SDE (10) with,
α(x) = µ − κx, κ > 0, and β(x) = σ 2 > 0,
so that,
dX = (µ − κx) dt + σ dW.

As mentioned earlier dealing with the limit y → −∞ is a touchy issue. For this reason we proceed by
setting the lower limits in the integrals of the Siegert formula which are at −∞ to the finite value ℓ and after
having formed the final quantities of interest we will take the limit ℓ → −∞.43 Thus we will proceed via the
steps,

41 The

quantity W(y) also has an important interpretation. it is often the case that C can be chosen so that W(y) is normalized
to be a probability density function. In this case it is not hard to show that W (x) is then the steady-state (t → ∞) probability
density function which is the stationary solution to the non-thresholded (forward) Fokker-Planck Equation (13),

W(x) = lim p(x, t|x0 , t0 ).

The derivation of W (x) as a solution to the steady-state Fokker-Planck equation is given in the Appendix.
42 This formula also appears to have been independently discovered by Johannesma (see Eq. (15) in [9]). Another early
reference to the Siegert formula in the context of neuronal modeling is given in [4] (see Eq. (5.1) in this latter reference).
43 The rigorous way to handle this case is to define the two boundary diffusion problem, ℓ < x < θ, with appropriate boundary
conditions at ℓ and θ. After the first passage time problem has been rigorously solve for this case, one can take ℓ → −∞
[8, 12, 23, 6]. Rather than have to devote time to discuss the somewhat subtle issue of diffusion boundary conditions, in this
note we have opted to work with improper integrals and evaluate expressions containing such integrals as appropriately defined
limiting cases.

where erf denotes the error function. This result is well known in the literature. Reference [14] refers to it
as the Siegert formula, despite its specialization to the case of the first moment, because it is readily derived
from the general Siegert formula (47) as we have done here.
Via use of the general Siegert formula (47) one can now proceed to derive the second moment of the first
passage time for the OUP, and hence the variance of the passage time from knowledge of both the first and
second moments. The form of the solutions (though not the details of the computations) can be found in
[19], though represented in term of the normal integral (which is closely related to the error function).

Mean Firing Rate for the OUP/LIF Neuron

Exploiting the fact that under the assumptions described in Section 1 the LIF subthreshold dynamics describe
an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (OUP), we have been able to derive the mean first passage time (MFPT) for
the neuron to hit the firing threshold after a reset at time t = 0. Specifically, MFPT as a function of the
threshold value θ and the membrane voltage reset value v0 is given by Eq. (51),
Tb = Tbθ (x0 ) = E{Tθ (x0 )} = m1 (θ, v0 ).

As discussed above, once the MFPT is at hand, the mean time-to-fire (MTF) of the OUP/LIF neuron,
Tbf = E(Tf ) = Tr + E(T ) = Tr + Tb,

is used to form the average firing rate (AFR) of the neuron,
ρ = Tbf−1 =

1

Tr + Tb

.

Recall from Eq. (5) that of all the parameters that define the OUP/LIF neuron, only

is generally under our immediate control. It is evident that the first two terms on the right-hand-side of this
equation can have a confounding effect that must be compensated for. Given the relationship between µ(I0 )
and the injected current (52), and recalling that,
µ = µ(I0 ) =

τ

we obtain the Siegert formula which shows how I0 affects the mean firing rate for the OUP/LIF Neuron
(LIF-MFR) in terms of the parameters defining the LIF-MFR neuron,

As mentioned in the first section of this note, the OUP-LIF is a tremendously simplified model of
neuronal dynamics. There is much research activity involved with relaxing the model assumptions. As one
can imagine, determining the mean first passage time for more complex is a highly nontrivial endeavor. A
low-order correction to the LIF-MFR (53) to partially account for synaptic capacitive effects is given in [3].
Further relevant modeling issues are discussed in the survey paper [11].

Appendix – Stationary Distribution of the Unrestricted FPE
The Markovian probabilistic behavior of the homogeneous stochastic differential equation (10) is described
by the transition probability density function, p(x, t|x0 , t0 ), which is a solution to the (forward) Fokker-Planck
Equation (13) subject to the initial condition (14) and the unrestricted boundary conditions (15). Under
reasonable conditions on the SDE (10), in the limit as t → ∞ the pdf p(x, t|x0 , t0 ) converges to a steady-state
density, W(x), which is independent of the time, t, and of the initial information (x0 , t0 ) [6, 23],
W(x) = lim p(x, t|x0 , t0 ).
t→∞

Since in the limit the steady-state density W(x) is independent of the initial condition (14), and
it must solve the steady-state (forward) Fokker-Planck equation,

Note the equivalence of equations (46) and (A.4). If we chose the constant C to ensure that W(x) is a
properly normalized probability density function, we obtain the following pdf as a steady-state solution to
