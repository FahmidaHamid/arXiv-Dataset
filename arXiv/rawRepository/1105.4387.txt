Abstract
Living organisms produce metabolites of many types via their metabolisms. Especially, flavonoids, a kind of secondary metabolites, of plant species are interesting
examples. Since plant species are believed to have specific flavonoids with respect
to diverse environment, elucidation of design principles of metabolite distributions
across plant species is important to understand metabolite diversity and plant evolution. In the previous work, we found heterogeneous connectivity in metabolite
distributions, and proposed a simple model to explain a possible origin of heterogeneous connectivity. In this paper, we show further structural properties in the
metabolite distribution among families inspired by analogy with plant-animal mutualistic networks: nested structure and modular structure. An earlier model represents that these structural properties in bipartite relationships are determined
based on traits of elements and external factors. However, we find that the architecture of metabolite distributions is described by simple evolution processes without
trait-based mechanisms by comparison between our model and the earlier model.
Our model can better predict nested structure and modular structure in addition
to heterogeneous connectivity both qualitatively and quantitatively. This finding
implies an alternative possible origin of these structural properties, and suggests
simpler formation mechanisms of metabolite distributions across plant species than
expected.

Introduction

How do metabolites distribute among species? Metabolite distributions across
species or comprehensive species-metabolite relationships (Shinbo et al., 2006)
are important to understand design principles for metabolism in addition to
metabolic networks (Barabási and Oltvai, 2004; Papp et al., 2007) because living organisms produce metabolic compounds of many types via their metabolisms,
which adaptively shape-shift with changing environment in a long evolutionary history. Especially, since living organisms have specific metabolite compositions due to metabolisms adaptively changing with respect to the environment, we can estimate environmental adaptation (adaptive evolution) using
metabolite distributions.
Toward this end, we used flavonoids to investigate structures of metabolite
distributions among plant species in the previous work (Takemoto and Arita,
2009a). Flavonoids are especially interesting examples when considering such
metabolite distributions. Plant species have secondary metabolites of many
types including flavonoids, alkanoids, terpenoids, phenolics, and other compounds. These metabolites are not essential for preserving life unlike basic metabolites such as bases, amino acids, and sugars; however, they play
additional roles aiding survival in diverse environments. Therefore, distributions of secondary metabolites are believed to be significantly different among
species due to environmental adaptation, implying high species specificity
(Gershenzon and Mabry, 1983). For this reason, secondary metabolites help
us to understand adaptation and evolution.
Metabolite distributions are represented as bipartite networks (or graphs) in
which nodes of two types correspond to plant species and flavonoids and links
denote species-flavonoid relationships. In the previous work, we found heterogeneous connectivity (degree distribution) in the flavonoid distributions: the
number of flavonoids in a plant species and the number of plant species sharing
a flavonoid follow power-law-like distributions. Moreover, a bipartite network
model was proposed by considering simple evolution processes in order to
explain a possible origin of the heterogeneous connectivity. We showed that
the model is in good agreement with real data with analytical and numerical
solutions.
Bipartite relationships such as the above metabolite distributions among species
are observed in other fields. A good example is plant-animal mutualistic networks, which occupy an important place in theoretical ecology and are important to understand cooperation dynamics and biodiversity. In networks of this
type, we can also observe the heterogeneous connectivity, or diversified patterns of interaction among species (both plants and animals) (Jordano et al.,
2003; Saavedra et al., 2009). In addition to this, non-random structural pat2

terns such as nested structure (Bascompte et al., 2003) and modular structure (Olesen et al., 2007) were found in the mutualistic networks. The nested
structure means that animals (pollinators or seed dispersers) of a certain
plant form a subset of those of another plant in a hierarchical fashion. Such
non-random patterns often strongly control dynamics of ecological systems
(Bascompte et al., 2009). The modular structure represents that the subsets
of species (modules), in which species are strongly interconnected, are weakly
connected. Thus, this structural property helps to understand coevolution of
two objects (i.e. plants and animals).
To reveal the origin of non-random patterns, Saavedra et al. (2009) proposed
the bipartite cooperation (BC) model inspired by food-web models based on
traits of species and external factors [reviewed in (Stouffer et al., 2005)]. Although it agrees well with real plant-animal mutualistic networks, the BC
model is a non-growth model in which the number of species (plants and pollinators) is fixed (i.e. this model is not an evolutionary model). The structure of
model-generated networks is determined by intrinsic parameters of three types
drawn from exponential or beta distributions: foraging traits (e.g. efficiency
and morphology), reward traits (e.g. quantity and quality) and external factors such as environmental context (e.g. geographic and temporal variation).
According to the above mechanism, the model network is generated with three
observable parameters: the numbers of nodes of two types (e.g. the number of
plants and the number of animals) and the number of interactions, and it is in
good agreement with real mutualistic networks. Furthermore, these structural
properties are also observed in manufacturer-contractor interactions, and the
BC model could reproduce them. Therefore, it is believed that the BC model
is a general model for bipartite relationships.
Taken together, several striking structural properties (i.e. heterogeneous connectivity, nested structure, and modular structure) are widely observed in
bipartite networks, and there are two models to explain design principles
for such bipartite networks: trait-based (non-evolutionary) model and evolutionary model. Due to this, we had the following questions: (i) Do metabolite distributions additionally show nested and modular structures in analogy
with ecological networks and organizational networks? (ii) Can our model
(Takemoto and Arita, 2009a) reproduce nested and modular structures in addition to heterogeneous connectivity? In other words, are these structural
properties acquired in evolutionary history? Rezende et al. (2007a,b) suggest
that the structure of mutualism between plants and animals is affected by not
only traits of species and external factors but also evolution processes. Thus,
it is expected that our model (i.e. evolutionary model) also can reproduce
such non-random patterns. (iii) Which is appropriate to our model (evolution
process) and the BC model (trait-based mechanism) to describe the formation
of metabolite distributions?
3

In this paper, we represent that metabolite distributions across species have
nested structure and modular structure, and numerically investigate whether
our model and the BC model can reproduce such non-random structures or
not. Furthermore, the prediction of network connectivity (degree distribution) is also evaluated between our model and the BC model. From these results, we show that formation mechanisms of metabolite distributions across
plant species are governed by simple evolution processes rather than traits of
metabolites and plant species and external factors.

Methods

2.1 Dataset

We utilized the data in (Takemoto and Arita, 2009a) in which a total of 14,378
species-flavonoid pairs were downloaded from Metabolomics.JP (Arita and Suwa,
2008) (http://metabolomics.jp/wiki/Category:FL). In this dataset, there are
4725 species and 6846 identified flavonoids. The taxonomy (family) of a species
was assigned according to The Taxonomicon (http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl).
The six largest families in terms of the number of reported flavonoids are considered: Fabaceae (bean family), Asteraceae (composite family), Lamiaceae
(Japanese basil family), Rutaceae (citrus family), Moraceae (mulberry family), and Rosaceae (rose family). We extracted species-flavonoid pairs from the
dataset based on these six families, and constructed the metabolite distribution of each family using bipartite networks.

2.2 The Model

We here review our model proposed in (Takemoto and Arita, 2009a). In this
model, a small initial metabolite distributions (Fig. 1 A) are first prepared,
and it evolves according to two simple evolutionary mechanisms as follows:
(i) Metabolite compositions of new species are inherited from those of existing
(ancestral) species. We assume that new species emerge due to mutation of
ancestral species. In our model, this event occurs with the probability p at time
t, and new species are born from randomly selected existing species. Flavonoid
compositions of new species are inherited from that of ancestral species because new species are similar to the ancestral species due to mutation (Fig.
1 B). By considering divergence, however, we model that each flavonoid is
inherited from that of ancestral species with the probability q (Fig. 1 C).
Independently of our model, in addition, a bipartite network model gener4

ated based on the above inheritance (or copy) mechanism was proposed in
(Nacher et al., 2009) to describe evolution of protein domain networks around
the same time.
(ii) New flavonoids are generated by variation of existing flavonoids. In evolutionary history, living organisms accordingly obtain new metabolic enzymes
via gene duplications (Dı́az-Mejı́a et al., 2007) and horizontal gene transfers
(Pál et al., 2005), and the metabolic enzymes synthesize new metabolites
through modification of existing flavonoids with substituent groups and functional groups. We model that this event occurs with the probability 1 − p at
time t and a species-flavonoid pair is selected at random (Fig. 1 D), and its
species obtains a new flavonoid (Fig. 1 E).

Our model have two parameters p and q. We can generate the model network
through the estimation of the parameters p and q using observable parameters
of real metabolite distributions: the number of plant species S, the number of
metabolites (flavonoid) F , and the number of interactions L.
The parameter p is estimated as
p=

S
S+F

(1)

because S = pt and F = (1 − p)t in our model.
5

To obtain the parameter q, we need to consider the time evolution of L. This
is derived as L ≈ (1 − p)t/(1 − q) (Takemoto and Arita, 2009a). Since F =
(1 − p)t, as above, the parameter q is estimated as
q = 1 − F/L.

(2)

Using Eq.s (1) and (2), we estimated the parameters p and q from real data,
and generated corresponding model networks for comparison with real ones.

Result

We first investigated the nestedness and the modularity of metabolite (flavonoid)
distributions. To measure the degrees of nested structure and modular structure (i.e. nestedness N and modularity Q) of metabolite distributions, we utilized the BINMATNEST program (Rodrı́guez-Gironés and Santamarı́a, 2006)
and the optimization algorithm proposed in (Guimerá and Amaral, 2005), respectively. The nestedness N ranges from perfect non-nestedness (N = 0)
to perfect nestedness (N = 1), and the high modularity Q means a strong
modular structure. We also calculated N and Q from randomized networks
generated by the null model 2 in (Bascompte et al., 2003) in order to show statistical significance of the structural properties. The statistically significance
is suitably evaluated because the null model 2 generates randomized networks
without bias of heterogeneous connectivity.
Figure 2 shows the comparison of nestedness N and modularity Q between
real data and the null model for each family. As shown in this figure, N and Q
of real data are significantly larger than that of the null model, indicating that
metabolite distributions also show nested structure and modular structure in
addition to heterogeneous connectivity as ecological networks and organizational networks. In addition, the nestedness and the modularity are different
structural properties because of no correlation between them (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.345 with P -value p = 0.503). The above result means
that metabolites in a plant species is a subset of that in other plant species,
and plant species are divided into several clusters based on their metabolite
compositions.
Next, the prediction of nestedness N and modularity Q by our model and the
BC model was mentioned. Figure 3 shows the comparison of N and Q between
models and real data. For comparison, we also computed N and Q calculated
from the null model.
We evaluated the prediction accuracy of our model and the BC model using the
Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) and the root mean square error (RMSE)

We finally considered the frequency of the number of interactions per nodes
(degree distribution). Figure 4 shows the degree distributions of metabolite
distributions (symbols) and the models (lines). The degree distributions of
the only three metabolite distributions as representative examples due to the
space limitation. We could observe degree distributions of two types [P (kS )
and P (kF ), where kS and kF denote the degrees of nodes corresponding to
plant species and metabolites (flavonoids), respectively] because metabolite
distributions are represented as bipartite graphs. In the both cases, the degree
distributions follow a power law with an exponential truncation, and modelgenerated degree distributions are in good agreement with real ones. However,
the BC model seems to have bad predictions in the case of P (kF ).
To quantitatively verify goodness of fits between models and real data, we
calculated the tail-weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov (wKS) statistics (distance)
(Clauset et al., 2009), defined as

the BC model. In the case of P (kS ) (i.e. wKSS ), the prediction accuracy (wKS
distance) is almost similar between our model and the BC model. In the case
of P (kF ), however, we can find the critical difference of the prediction between
our model and the BC model. Our model could more highly predict P (kF )
than the BC model.
Figure 5 B shows the correlation between the network size (i.e. S + F ) and
prediction accuracy, defined as wKSS +wKSF . As shown in this figure, the
prediction accuracy of our model tends to decrease with the network size
(r = −0.850 with p = 0.032), suggesting better predictions of our model
for degree distributions in the case of larger networks. However, there is no
correlation between the prediction accuracy and network size in the case of
the BC model (r = −0.436 with p = 0.387).

Discussions

In summary, metabolite distributions across plant species also show nested
structure and modular structure in addition to heterogeneous connectivity in
analogy with plant-animal mutualistic networks and organizational networks,
suggesting that such structural properties are universal among bipartite networks in wide-ranging fields. Moreover, we found that our model can also
reproduce these structural properties in addition to the BC model, indicating
an alternative way to obtain these structural properties. In other words, we
showed that there are two different ways to obtain the structural properties:
the trait-based way (the BC model) and the evolutionary way (our model).

Either one of these two way (i.e. the BC model or our model) might become
significant due to the types of bipartite relationship and observation condition.
In particular, metabolite distributions might be different from ecological networks and organizational networks in perspective of design principles despite
the same structural properties. As above, we showed that our model could
better reproduce such structural properties of metabolite distributions than
the BC model. This finding implies that these structural properties of metabolite distributions are acquired through evolution processes, considered in our
model, rather than trait-based mechanisms (i.e. the BC model), believed to
be a general formation mechanism of bipartite networks.
Compared to ecological networks and organizational networks, metabolite distributions might be hardly influenced by traits of elements (i.e. plant species
and metabolites) and external factors. This might because we can observe
comprehensive species-metabolite relationships. In the case of ecological net10

works and organizational networks, such observations might be difficult. For
example, we assume that a plant species can interact to pollinators A, B, C
and D in plant-animal mutualistic networks. However, these interactions are
limited because of several conditions such as geography and pollinators’ properties (e.g. environmental fitness). Supposing that the pollinator A only lives
in area I, and the rest (i.e. B–D) is in area II due to such conditions, we can find
the different mutualistic networks between areas I and II. Because of such restraints, ecological networks might be different from metabolite distributions.
However, we speculate that our model can be also applied to ecological networks of this type if plant-animal relationships are comprehensively obtained
under ideal conditions (e.g. environmentally homogeneous islands). In fact,
our model could reproduce the structure of plant-animal mutualistic networks
in a limited way (Takemoto and Arita, 2009b).
When we consider the global tendency of bipartite relationships such as nested
structure, modular structure, and heterogeneous connectivity, our model can
explain its origin more simply than the BC model. This is an advantage of our
model. In the case of the BC model, the formation mechanisms are relatively
complicated because we need to consider the interaction rule based on traits
between elements and external factors. However, we believe that elements’
traits and external factors are important. Especially such factors might play
crucial roles for the formation of local interaction patterns.
Using our model, the formation mechanisms of the structural properties in
metabolite distributions are described as follows.
The nested structure means that a plant’s flavonoid composition is a subset
of other plants’ flavonoid compositions, and its origin is explained using our
model as follows. In our model, metabolites of a new plant are inherited from
those of an ancestral plant because these plants tend to be similar due to
mutation. However, new plants obtain the part of metabolites by considering
divergence (elimination of interactions). As a result, metabolites of an offspring
plant become a subset of those of their parent plant, and produce nested
structure.
The modular structure implies that plant species are divided into several clusters in which they are strongly interconnected through common metabolites
and these clusters interact loosely. In short, the modular structure is obtained
by strong interconnections in clusters and weak interactions among these clusters. Emergence of weak and strong interactions is also described by inherence
and divergence of metabolite compositions. As above, metabolite compositions
are inherited from ancestral species in our model. Then, new species and ancestral species are connected because of common metabolites, and interactions
of this type correspond to strong interconnections. Due to divergence, on the
other hand, new species indirectly connect to the other species via metabolites
11

of ancestral species that were not inherited by new species, and this results
weak interactions.
Regarding the origin of heterogeneous connectivity, we have already discussed
in (Takemoto and Arita, 2009a). Easily speaking, the duplication mechanism
and the randomly selection of species-flavonoid pairs result preferential attachments (‘rich-gets-richer’ mechanisms) because nodes with many neighbors tend to obtain more neighbors when considering such mechanisms. These
are strongly related to the duplication-divergence model (Vázquez, 2003) and
the Dorogovtsev-Mendes-Samukhin model (Dorogovtsev et al., 2001), respectively.
In the case of metabolite distributions, as above, we believe that nested structure, modular structure, and heterogeneous connectivity are dominantly acquired in evolutionary history. Thus, these structural properties might provide
novel classification schemes of plant species based on metabolite compositions
such as chemotaxonomy. For example, we might be able to extract hierarchical organization of plant species based on their metabolite compositions from
nested structure. Moreover, modular structure might reveal classified characteristic species-metabolite relationships, and heterogeneous connectivity helps
to find useful metabolites (i.e. hub metabolites) for taxonomic classification
and characterization of plant species at higher levels (e.g. family and order).
As a result, these structural properties might provide insights into metabolite
diversity and plant evolution.
For simplicity, we did not consider a number of important evolution processes (especially deletions of nodes and interactions) at present. In particular, the degree distributions may become different due to such extinctions
(Enemark and Sneppen, 2007; Deng et al., 2007). However, such mechanisms
might contribute only negligible effects on the above structural properties (the
grobal tendency) according to our result. This might be because such mechanisms tend to be nonessential in plant evolution. In plant species, genome
doubling (polyploidity) is a major driving force for increasing genome size and
the number of genes (Adams and Wendel, 2005). Duplicated genes typically
diversify in their function, and some acquire the ability to synthesize new compounds. Indeed, plants acquire metabolites of many types (mostly secondary
metabolites) (De Luca and St Pierre, 2000), compared to a few thousand primary metabolites in higher animals. The population of flavonoids, a type of
secondary metabolites, is therefore expected to increase, indicating that we can
roughly dismiss the effect of node losses when we consider the global tendency
of metabolite distributions. However, this does not mean that the deletions of
nodes and interactions are unnecessary. Such evolutionary mechanisms might
play important roles to determine partial (or local) interaction patterns of
bipartite relationships. Thus, we need to focus on such evolution processes in
the future to fully understand the formation of metabolite distributions across
12

species.
