We study the effect of intracellular ion diffusion on ionic currents permeating through the cell
membrane. Ion flux across the cell membrane is mediated by special proteins forming specific channels. The structure of potassium channels have been widely studied in recent years with remarkable
results: very precise measurements of the true current across a single channel are now available.
Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the behavior of the channel is still lacking, though molecular dynamics and kinetic models have provided partial insights. In this paper we demonstrate, by
analyzing the KcsA current-voltage currents via a suitable lattice model, that intracellular diffusion
plays a crucial role in the permeation phenomenon. The interplay between the selectivity filter behavior and the ion diffusion in the intracellular side allows a full explanation of the current-voltage
curves.

INTRODUCTION

Potassium currents across nerve membranes have been
widely studied (see, e.g., [1–3] and the reviews [4–8]).
Ionic channels selecting potassium currents are present
in almost all types of cells in all organisms and they play
many important and different functional roles.
Different types of measurements [9, 10] provide a very
detailed description of the behavior of potassium channels. In general, less is known on their structure [6].
KcsA, a potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans,
is the first ion channel whose structure has been identified
via X–ray crystallography [11].
All ionic channels form selective pores in the cell membrane which open and close and, when in the open state,
allow permeation of a selected ionic species (potassium
in K+ –channels). Their ability to open and close, i.e.,
gating, and their ability to allow the flux of a particular
ionic species, i.e., selectivity, are not yet completely understood. A lot is known in the case of the KcsA channel
and, with some care, can be extrapolated to the whole
family of K+ channels.
In KcsA, see for instance the detailed description in
[6, 12], gating is realized via four crossing transmem-

brane helices on the intracellular side. When in the open
state, a spherical water–filled cavity of diameter about
10 Å widens on the intracellular side of the channel up
to the membrane plane. There a 10–15 Å long and
3 Å large channel containing the selectivity filter connects the cavity to the extracellular side.
When the channel flips to the open state a solution
with the cytoplasm concentration reaches the entrance
of the channel. Part of the ions permeates through the
channel leaving an ion depleted region close to the pore.
The typical time needed to restore the intracellular concentrations close to the pore will depend strongly on the
diffusion process of ions inside the cell. We can then
imagine that the current flowing through the channel will
depend both on the diffusion of ions in the cytoplasm and
on the behavior of the selectivity filter.
The problem of computing the permeation current in
the open state, namely, the so called true current, has
been approached theoretically by a large variety of methods. Molecular dynamics studies [13, 14] give a very detailed description, but they usually do not provide macroscopic currents estimates due to the too small involved
time scale. Kinetic models [15–20] give very useful information, since electro–physiological experiments are performed over time scales much longer than the atomic one,
with the drawback of the extreme simplification on the
structure of the channel.
In the recent literature it has been examined the possibility to validate these kinetic models by comparing the

2
predicted behaviors with those observed experimentally.
In particular the models have been tested against their
ability to predict the current–voltage behavior. In this respect very accurate experimental results have been published for different potassium channels, see [21], [22], and
[23] for the KcsA, MaxiK, and the Shaker channels, respectively.
Models such as those quoted above describe to some
extent the dynamics of ion permeation through the selectivity filter, the concentration of the ion in the cell is introduced in the model as a constant parameter. In other
words in those studies the diffusion of the ions inside the
cell is not taken into account. Our opinion is that diffusion, as explained above, must take an important part
in the permeation phenomenon. In [24], inspired by [20],
we introduced a model where the channel is lumped to
a two state stochastic point system and the interaction
between the dynamics of the ions inside the cell (diffusion) and that of the selectivity filter itself is taken into
account. The channel is then thought of as part of the
cell more than as an isolated structure. In that paper
both an analytical and Monte Carlo study showed the
possibility to achieve gating via selection.
In this paper we examine the possibility to predict the
behavior of the current–voltage curves (graph of the permeation current vs. the external potential difference applied to the membrane) on the basis of a similar model.
A modification is needed to take into account the effect of
an external voltage difference through the cell membrane.
The model is thus defined to mimic the three effects that
seem to be the most relevant in the process: (i) diffusion
of the ions inside the cell; (ii) dynamics of the selectivity
filter; (iii) dynamics of the ions inside the selectivity filter. We compare the current–voltage behavior predicted
by our model with experimental results from [21–23] and
find a very good agreement both for the dependence of
the current on the ion concentration and on the external
voltage.
Ion diffusion (item (i)) inside the cell is modeled as a
symmetric random walk on a finite line. We use a one dimensional system in order to compute all the interesting
quantities explicitly [24, Appendix B]. As we shall comment later the dimensionality of the system affects only
our estimate of the diffusion coefficients of ions inside the
cytoplasm. Corrections will be introduced to compute
the three–dimensional value of the diffusion coefficient.
We remark that point (i) is the real distinguishing feature of our model. As we shall discuss later, the introduc-

tion of ion diffusion in the intracellular region and hence
of the depletion phenomenon, will allow a full description
of the permeation current behavior with respect to both
external voltage and ion intracellular concentration.
One of the two boundary points of the finite line where
ions diffuse is reflecting, whereas the other mimics the
selectivity filter. The dynamics of the pore (item (ii))
is assumed to be stochastic. The pore jumps randomly
between two states, the low and the high–affinity one.
The dynamics of the pore is independent from that of
the ions inside the cell. The chances that an ion has to
enter the pore depend both on the ion species and on the
pore state; in this way selection is implemented in the
model.
This description is quite faithful to the real behavior
of the selectivity filter. Indeed, two possible states are
possible for the filter [25], the low and the high–affinity
one. When the filter is in the low–affinity state permeation is favored, but no ionic species is preferred. Thus,
in order to realize selectivity in an efficient way, the filter
has to jump between these two states. To our knowledge
the time fraction spent by the filter in the low affinity–
state is not known experimentally; the value predicted
by analyzing the current–voltage curves via our model
depends on the ionic concentration in cytosol and is of
order 10−3 . This result seems to be coherent with the
qualitative description given in [20, Figure 5].
The dynamics of the ions inside the filter (item (iii))
is not modeled in detail, we just assume that a particle
inside the pore can either exit the system or reenter the
cell with a fixed probability. This ejection probability is
chosen as a function of the voltage difference across the
cell membrane. Our modeling of the dynamics inside the
filter is, thus, reduced to the choice of this function. It is
worth noting that the model is able to reproduce accurately the experimental results with different choices of
this function, that is to say with different descriptions of
the dynamics of the ions inside the filter. More precisely
we shall see that it is possible to explain the experimental
results via different models for the dynamics of the ions
inside the filter; when a different functional behavior for
the ejection probability in terms of the external voltage is
chosen, a different value of the typical time spent by the
filter in the low–affinity state is found. In other words
different models of the dynamics of the ions inside the filter are allowed provided the low–affinity state probability
is changed suitably.
Indeed, we shall find very good results either by choos-

3
ing the ejection probability function according to very
well known and studied theories [17] or by assuming that
the ejection probability for a potassium ion trapped inside the filter is a power law function of the applied (suitably renormalized) voltage difference. In both cases our
model will predict curves fitting cleanly the experimental
result for the “true” ion current with reasonable values of
the intracellular diffusion coefficient; but different values
of the low–affinity state probability will be predicted. A
more precise knowledge of this probability would enable
us to discriminate among different mechanisms.
Moreover, we remark that our model will be also able
to explain the behavior of ionic species different from
potassium by choosing properly the physical parameters
appearing in the ejection probability function of the external voltage difference.
We finally note that some care has to be used when
the theoretical results are compared with experiments.
In the biological literature, see for instance [9], two different types of current are reported, the apparent and
the true one. This is connected with the peculiar behavior of ionic channels: two different states are observed,
closed and open channel. In the first state a zero current is observed, in the second one the outgoing current
fluctuates randomly on a very short time–scale and a not
zero average current, called true current, is measured.
The true current can be accessed experimentally only if
the time resolution of the instruments is good enough
to distinguish neatly between the open and the closed
time intervals. When this is not the case a different current, called apparent current, is measured. This current
is smaller than the true one since the instruments average
the current also on time intervals in which the channel is
closed.
The model we propose here is intended to mimic the
behavior of the ionic channel in the open state. The
average outgoing flux that will be computed has then to
be thought as a prediction for the true current.
In Section II we introduce the lattice model. Section III is devoted to the analysis of the experimental
data. Our results will be discussed in Section IV, where,
in particular, we shall comment on the physical meaning of the fitting parameters introduced previously. Our
conclusions are briefly summarized in Section V.

II.

THE MODEL

The intracellular region is modeled via a finite one–
dimensional lattice Λ ⊂ Z with L sites. Two sites of
Z are said to be nearest–neighbors if and only if their
mutual Euclidean distance is equal to one. The boundary ∂Λ of Λ is the collection of the two sites of Z not
belonging to Λ and neighboring one of the site of Λ. One
of the two points of the boundary of Λ is called pore, and
denoted by P .
One ionic species performs an independent symmetric
random walk on the lattice with reflectivity conditions on
the site of ∂Λ different from the pore. The particles on
the site neighboring the pore behave in a special way that
will be described below; due to the peculiarity of such a
rule the walkers will turn out to be not independent. The
number of walkers is denoted by N .
The fact that the walkers are independent on Λ means
that the position of a particle does not affect the motion
of the others, in particular no constraint to the number of
particles on each site is prescribed. The fact that the random walks are symmetric means that each jump between
two neighboring sites of Λ is performed with probability
1/2. Since we assumed that the boundary is reflecting,
particles in the site neighboring ∂Λ \ {P } can stay in the
same site with probability 1/2.
Two states are allowed for the pore: high–affinity and
low–affinity. The pore switches between the two states
randomly; the probability that the pore is in the low–
affinity state is denoted by p ∈ [0, 1]. Moreover the pore
can be either free or occupied by an ion. The behavior of
the particles on the site Q neighboring the pore depends
on the state of the pore itself as it is precisely stated
in figure 1. The idea is the following. If the pore is
occupied by a particle, no other ion can enter it. If the
pore is (free) in the low–affinity state, particles can enter
it; when they enter the pore they immediately dissociate
so that, with probability v ∈ [0, 1] they exit the system
while they reenter Λ with probability 1 − v. If the pore is
free and in the high–affinity state, one particle can enter
it, but, once entered, it remains there until the pore state
changes to the low–affinity one. When this happens the
ion dissociates with the same rule described above. As
noted above, due to the pore rule, the walkers are not
independent.
Whenever an ion exits the system another particle is
put at random with uniform probability 1/L on one of the
L sites in Λ so that the number of ions is kept constant.

4
The model described above is implemented with the
Markov Chain described in detail in the appendix A. An
iteration or sweep of the chain is the collection of the
steps that are performed at each time n.
As we have explained in the Introduction, the aim of
this paper is that of computing the outgoing ionic current. This quantity is related to the number of particles
that exit the system. We let M (n) be the number of particles which exited the system in the time interval [0, n].
Moreover, we let the flux at time n be M (n)/n. Since
we defined the stochastic process in such a way that the
number of ions keeps constant in the volume Λ, M (n)/n
approaches a constant value f for n → ∞. This quantity,
that we shall call the outgoing flux, is expected to be proportional to the “real” current measured experimentally.
The existence of this limiting flux can be deduced by
remarking that the chain is irreducible and that the space
state is finite. So we have that there exists a stationary
measure for the process and that, in the limit n → ∞,
the time dependent quantities tend to the corresponding
quantities averaged against the stationary measure.
By exploiting one–dimensionality, the model can be
solved analytically and the outgoing flux can be computed explicitly. In our model the pore is modeled in a
very simple fashion, indeed it is just a two state Bernoulli
process; the main difficulty is, obviously, the interaction
between the random walk inside the volume Λ and the
pore itself. We consider the stationary state reached by
a walker and denote by q the probability for the ion to
occupy the site Q of Λ neighboring the pore.
Particles that enter the pore in the low–affinity state
can exit the system with probability v. With the same
probability a particle trapped in the pore in the high–
affinity state can exit Λ when the pore switches to the
low–affinity state. We can write the outgoing flux as
f=

where we have denoted by r the probability that in the
stationary state the pore is occupied by a particle when
it switches from the high to the low–affinity state.

COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS

In [21] it has been demonstrated that the KcsA, a bacterial ion channel of Kir topology and very well known
structure (see, for instance, [6] and references therein), is
a potassium channel. In that paper very precise measurements of potassium (and some other ion species) currents
are reported. In this section we try to explain their results via our model.
Since the structure of the KcsA channel is well know,
in this section will be mainly concerned with the experimental measures in [21]. At the end a brief analysis of
the results in [22] and [23], concerning respectively the
MaxiK and the Shaker channel, will be given. Note that
the Shaker is a voltage–activated channel of Kv topology.

A.

Potassium current–voltage curves

In [21, Figure 2B] the potassium current–voltage curves
at different concentrations 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 mM
are shown. We text the reliability of our lattice model
by exhibiting neat fitting of those experimental data.
Let I be the measured current, V the voltage applied
across the cellular membrane and write
I = SI f

(4)

where f is given in (1) with
v = SV

eαδV − e−αδV e−α(1−2δ)V
1 + e−α(1−2δ)V

(5)

where SI , SV , δ are positive parameters and α is the constant α = e0 /Kb T = 0.039 mV−1 , with e0 = 1.6 ×
10−7 pC the charge of the potassium ion, Kb the Boltzmann constant, and T = 298.15 o K the temperature.
As we discussed in the Introduction, the choice of the
probability v as a function of the voltage V is the only ingredient of the model related to the dynamics of the ions
inside the filter. The choice (5) is inspired by the model
in [16–18] and dates back to the knock–on model in [26].

TABLE I. The parameters SI and p have been measured by fitting the experimental data in [21], [23] (data extracted from
figure 1B therein), and [22] via (4) and (5). By fitting the highest concentration set of data we also found SV = 1.2 × 10−3 ,
δ = 0.19, l = 5.5 nm, and L = 1.00 × 104 for the KcsA, SV = 5.45 × 10−3 , δ = 0.16, l = 5.3 nm, and L = 1.12 × 104 for the
Shaker and SV = 8.91 × 10−3 , δ = 0.16, l = 5.5 nm, and L = 1.00 × 104 for the MaxiK. The parameters s and D have been
computed via (8) and (9).

We remark that, as it will be made clear in Section III D,
the ability of our model to describe the experimental results does not depend strictly on this choice. See also the
comments there in this connection.
We fit the experimental data for concentration 800 mM
by using the above formula with N = 800. In this way
we fix the parameters
SI , SV , δ, L, and p800
where p800 is the low–affinity probability for concentration 800 mM.
We complete the analysis of the data set according to
the following scheme. The values of SI and p for the six
experimental series are supposed to change, that is to
say we assume that the probability that the filter is in
the low–affinity state and the constant SI (we will see in
Section IV that this constant is related to the diffusion
coefficient in the intracellular region) depend on the ionic
concentration. The five other experimental series, that is
to say those measured at concentrations 400, 200, 100, 50,
and 20 mM, are then fitted by the same equation by
keeping fixed SV , δ, α, and L and by using p and SI
as the sole fitting parameters. Results are plotted in
figure 2; the fitted parameters are reported in table I.
The physical meaning of the fitting parameters will be
discussed in Section IV.
This fitting scheme is based on a simple remark: we
assume that the channel behavior, that in our description is modeled by the function (5), does not depend
on the ion concentration. On the other hand we cannot
exclude that the ionic diffusion coefficient in the intracellular region [27] and the typical time spent by the pore
in the low–affinity state depend on the concentration of
the ionic species in the cell.
The soundness of the values that we found for the

fitting parameters will be discussed in Section IV. We
now mention only two facts: to our knowledge there exists no experimental measure of the time fraction spent
by the filter in the low–affinity state. So that we cannot say anything about the validity of our estimate for
p; we can just remark the qualitative agreement with
[20, Figure 5]. The estimated diffusion coefficient is several orders of magnitude larger than the real (experimental) value [27, 28]. This expected problem is due to the
one–dimensional character of the model. In Section IV
we shall compute the associated three–dimensional estimates that will result to be in very good agreement with
the experimental values.
Finally we note that with our fitting scheme we also
are able to reproduce with good accuracy the data in [22],
and [23] referring, respectively, to the MaxiK and Shaker
channel in [23] (see figure 3 and table I). Data in figure 3
have been reproduced with the authors’ permission. The
data related to the Shaker channel have been extracted
from figure 1B in [23].

B.

Potassium conductance curves

In [21] the permeation behavior of the pore has been
investigated also by means of the conductance g = I/V .
We compared the permeation data in [21] at fixed voltage
V = 200 mV and concentration varying from 5 mM to
1600 mM, with the results of our fit of potassium current–
voltage curves (see Section III A), as shown in figure 4 by
an Eadie–Hofstee plot. In the picture the symbols + and
 refer, respectively, to the experimental data and to the
theoretically computed values, whereas the dotted line is
an eye guide.
The matching is good in the whole region where full ex-

6
perimental data sets are known. This graph shows neatly
the ability to our model to capture also the dependence
of the permeation current on the ion intracellular concentration.
Even if we do not have any physical argument to support this choice, it is worth noting that the dotted line
in the picture, which is just an eye guide, has been indeed obtained by assuming a (slightly sub–linear) power
low dependence of the low–affinity state probability p on
the ion concentration and an Hill type behavior for the
diffusion coefficient.

C.

Other species current–voltage curves

We test our model against the experimental current–
voltage curves [21] for ions different from potassium.
+
More precisely we consider the curves for NH+
4 , Tl , and
Rb+ at ionic concentration 100 mM.
To fit these curves we fix the values of SI , L, and p to
the ones found previously for potassium at concentration
100 mM, and we use δ and SV as fitting parameters.
That is to say that we assume that the ionic diffusion
in the intracellular region and the probability of finding
the filter in the low–affinity state are independent on the
ionic species, but depend only on the ionic concentration.
This is suggested by the measured values of the diffusion
coefficient, see for instance [29, Table 2] for Tl+ and [30,
Table 1.1-1] for the other ions.
With this assumption we are implicitly saying that
the reduced, with respect to potassium, permeation rates
typical of the other selected ion species is due to the behavior of such ions inside the selectivity filter. Results are
plotted in figure 5; the fitted parameters are reported in
table II.
Deeper investigation on this point should be corroborated by additional data. As in the potassium case, data
sets corresponding to different values of the intracellular
concentrations are needed.

D.

Modeling the channel

In the discussion above the choice of the relation between
the ejection probability and the voltage across the membrane, see equation (5), has been inspired by the physical argument proposed in the kinetic model for single–file
ion channels in [16–18]. The function in (5) has the same
form of the channel permeation rate used in that model,

that is to say we are assuming that the inner part of the
channel behaves like a single file ion channel. One of the
key novelties in our work is the coupling between this
mechanism and the diffusion of the ions in the intracellular region.
It is worth noting that the analysis conducted in Subsections III A, III B, and III C can be repeated using a
simple power law (having no particular physical meaning)
for the ejection probability as a function of the external
voltage. In other words we can assume
 V γ
(6)
v=
CV
for modeling the relation between the ejection probability
and the voltage across the membrane.
In this case we get similarly good results, that is to
say we are able to reproduce the experimental data with
good precision. We do not show the graphs, which are
similar to those in figure 2, but report the whole set of
fitted parameters in table III.
This remark suggests that, in the framework of our
model, no particular modeling of the dynamics of ions
inside the channel is needed in order to get the correct
behavior of the current–voltage curves. But it is important to remark that different filter models produce different values for the time fraction spent by the selectivity
filter in the low–affinity state. Indeed, see tables I and
III, by using the models (5) and (6) for the dynamics inside the filter, similar values for the diffusion coefficient
are found, whereas the predictions for the time fraction
p spent by the selectivity filter in the low–affinity state
differ by an order of magnitude. This suggests that the
current–voltage curves could be a useful instrument to
predict the time fraction spent by the selectivity filter in
the low–affinity state once the dynamics of the ions in
the filter is known or vice–versa.

IV.

DISCUSSION

In the above section we have seen that the model proposed in this paper is able to explain in great detail the
experimental data for the current–voltage curves in the
KcsA ionic channel. We have shown that the theoretical predictions fit nicely the measured curves provided
the parameters defining the model are suitably chosen.
It is notable that our model explains the dependence of
the permeation current both on the external voltage (figures 2, 3, and 5) and on the ion concentration in the
intracellular region (figure 4).

TABLE III. The parameters SI and p have been measured by fitting the experimental data in [21] via (4) and (6). By fitting
the highest concentration set of data we also found CV = 6.31 × 104 , γ = 1.19, l = 5.5 nm and L = 1.00 × 104 . The parameters
s and D have been computed via (8) and (9).

In [17] the same experimental data [21] have been analyzed via a kinetic model formerly introduced by the same
author. In that model the selectivity filter is treated as an
isolated structure and the intracellular ion concentration
is an input constant of the model. Two different regimes
for the filter had to be assumed corresponding, respectively, to high (400 mM and 800 mM) and low (20 mM,
50 mM, and 100 mM) potassium concentrations. Two
different sets of the parameters carachterizing the filter
behavior (the analogue of SV and δ) were found.
In other words the model in [17] predicts that the behavior of the selectivity filter depends on the intracellular
ion concentration. In our model the selectivity filter is
coupled with the diffusion of ions in the intracellular region; this is indeed the key novelty and the distinguishing
feature of our approach. This allows to explain the experimental data referring to all the concentrations with the
same set of parameters, SV and δ, for the filter behavior.
To compare the way in which data are explained by
the model in [17] and by our model, we first note that
the electrical dissociation distance δ (see [16, Fig. 1]) that
we find is very close to that fitted there. Moreover, we
note that in [17] in the lower intracellular concentration
regime, the fitted parameters are such that an higher
effective concentration (c∗ in their notation) is seen. In
our model particle diffusion accounts for this effect.
We now discuss the reasonableness of the values we
found for these fitting parameters for the potassium current data for the KcsA ionic channel (see Section III A).
As a first step we have to give a continuum interpreta-

tion of the lattice modeling the cytosol. In other words we
have to associate with the unit length of the lattice model
a physically reasonable quantity. We imagine to associate with each lattice site a small cubic volume whose
side length is denoted by `. Recall that the experimental
concentration c is expressed in millimolar, that is as number of moles per cubic meter (i.e., number of millimoles
per liter). Recall, also, that N is the number of particles
in the lattice model and that L is the number of sites in
Λ. We then have the following identification
c=

N 1
NA `3 L

where NA = 6.022 × 1023 is the Avogadro number and `
has to be expressed in meter.
Since in our fitting procedure we have chosen N such
that c/N = 1 mM, we have that
`=

1
= 5.50 × 10−10 m = 0.55 nm
(NA L)1/3

(7)

where we have used that L has been fitted to 104 , see the
caption of table I. The above argument provides us with
a way to associate a length unit measure with our lattice
model. The result we found for ` is physically reasonable,
indeed we can assume that each cubic volume associated
with a site of the lattice can accommodate few (say one
or two) ions, so that its side length has to be of the order
of magnitude of the ionic diameter. This value we found
for ` is then reasonable, since potassium ion, atomic, and
van der Waals radius are respectively given by 0.13, 0.23,
and 0.27 nm.

8
As a second step we have to give a continuum interpretation of the discrete unit of time of the Markov Chain.
In other words we have to associate with the unit of time
a physically reasonable quantity s. We consider the evolution of our model up to the time n and note that the
true current measured in the experiments can be identified as
I=

e0
e0 × (number of particles which exited Λ)
=
f
s × (number of iterations)
s

where e0 = 1.6 × 10−7 pC is the charge of a potassium
ion and f is the theoretical model outgoing flux. We
then identify e0 /s with the parameter SI introduced in
equation (4); that is to say we write
s=

e0
SI

(8)

and we can use the estimated SI listed in the first row
of table I to compute the values of s listed in the same
table.
We have no direct clue to establish if these values for
s are reasonable or not. But starting from this values we
can estimate the diffusion coefficient of potassium ions
in the cytosol. Indeed, see Appendix B, the intracellular
ion diffusion coefficient is related to the other parameters
by the equation (B1), which yields
D=

`2
2s

side length L1/3 in order to ensure that the “real” volume associated with the three dimensional model is equal
to that associated with the one dimensional one. By a
classical argument similar to the one developed in the
Appendix B it is proven that the squared mean distance
walked up to time t is 6D3 t where D3 is the diffusion
coefficient. This implies that the typical time needed by
the walker, started at random in the lattice, to reach a
particular point of the boundary (say the pore) is of order
1
(mL1/3 )2
×
× 6(L1/3 )2
64
6D3
Indeed, the first term is the square of the average distance of a point inside a cube of side length mL1/3 from
the boundary of the cube itself and the third one is the
number of times the walker has to visit the boundary
before touching the pore (number of points on the lateral surface of the cube). Note that the product between
the first and the second term is an estimate for the time
needed to touch the boundary of the cube for a walker
started at random in the cube itself.
In our former analysis, in computing fluxes, we indeed evaluated this time in the framework of our one–
dimensional model. By repeating the same argument we
can say that this time was estimated as
1
1
(mL)2 ×
×2
16
2D1

(9)

By using this equation we compute the diffusion coefficient for the potassium. Results have been reported in
the last row of table I.
The order of magnitude we found for the diffusion coefficient of potassium ions is 10−2 cm2 /sec. This result
is several (say three) order of magnitude larger than the
real (experimental) value [28]. This problem was indeed
quite expected, since we modeled the diffusion of ions in
cytosol with a one–dimensional lattice. As we have already remarked, the one–dimensional choice is motivated
by the possibility to write explicitly the solution of the
probabilistic model. Explicit formulas are quite necessary to perform the extended analysis discussed in Section III. As a future work we are now planning a Monte
Carlo assisted analysis for the three–dimensional version
of our model.
In any case we prove, now, that the estimates we found
in this one–dimensional case for the diffusion coefficient
are quite reasonable. Consider a simple symmetric random walk with unitary time on a three-dimensional cubic lattice with L sites and spacing m. We consider the

By equating the two expressions found above we find
D3 =

1
D1 L−2/3 ≈ 0.00054 × D1
4

where we used L = 104 (see the caption of table I).
By the equation above it follows that to the diffusion
constant estimated via the one–dimensional model ranging in 3.62 – 15.8 × 10−2 cm2 /sec (see table I) it corresponds a “true” diffusion coefficient ranging in 1.95 –
8.53 × 10−5 cm2 /sec, which is very close to the experimental value for the potassium diffusion coefficient [28].

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied the effect of intracellular ion diffusion on ionic currents permeating through
the cell membrane ionic channels. Ion channels share
the following common properties: the ion flux is rapid,
the channel is selective, and its functions are regulated
by a gating mechanism. Although a formidable effort,
with absolutely remarkable results, has been performed

9
recently, a complete understanding of ionic channel behavior is still lacking.
Thanks to the patch clamp technique very precise measurements of the true current across a single channels are
available. In this paper we have proposed a model which
is able to provide a full explanation of the KscA current–
voltage experimental curves [21] by taking into account
the following three effects: ion diffusion in the intracellular region, dynamics of the filter, and dynamics of the
ions inside the filter.
In particular our model points out the role played by
intracellular diffusion on ion permeation in compensating the ion depletion in the region close to the pore.
The model is able to explain the dependence of the experimetal data referring to the true ionic currents both on
the external voltage and on the intracellular potassium
concentration.
Is is also notable that all the fitting parameters have
a clear qualitative and quantitative physical interpretation. Moreover, we noted that the estimate we got for
the typical time spent by the filter in the low–affinity
state is strictly related to the dynamics of ions inside the
filter. This suggests that our approach, corroborated by
new experimental data, should be able to shed some light
also on the dynamics of the ions inside the filter.

Appendix A: Detailed definition of the model

We consider an integer time variable n. We set n = 0
and choose at random with uniform probability 1/L the
position of the N particles. We then repeat the following
steps:
1. set n equal n + 1;
2. select at random the state of the pore: choose the
low–affinity state with probability p and the high–
affinity one with probability 1 − p;
(a) if the pore is in the low–affinity state and it is
occupied by a particle, the particle is released
with the following rule: it jumps with probability 1 − v to the site of Λ neighboring the
pore or, with probability v, it exits the system;
(b) if a particle exits the system, a particle of the
same species is put at random with uniform
probability 1/L on one of the L sites in Λ;
3. the position of each particle on the lattice is updated following the rules defined in Section II;
(a) if a particle enters the pore and the pore is in
the low–affinity state, the particle is immediately released by the pore with the following

rule: it jumps with probability 1−v to the site
of Λ neighboring the pore or, with probability
v, it exits the system;
(b) if a particle exits the system, a particle of the
same species is put at random with uniform
probability 1/L on one of the L sites in Λ.

Appendix B: Diffusion coefficient

Consider a one–dimensional walker on `Z and denote its
position at time t ∈ sZ+ by
St ∈ {. . . , −`, 0, +`, . . . }
The random variable St is the sum of t/s (note that t/s
is a positive integer) independent identically distributed
random variables Yi ∈ {−`, +`} such that
P(Yi = +`) = P(Yi = −`) =

1
2

A straightforward computation yields
E[Yi ] = 0 and E[(Yi − E[Yi ])2 ] = `2
for the average and the variance of the random variable
Yi respectively. By independence we also get
t
E[St/s ] = 0 and E[(St/s − E[St/s ])2 ] = `2
s
By the Central Limit Theorem (see, for instance, [31,
Theorem (4) in Section 5.10]) we have that for t large
the probability density of the random variable St/s is
very well approximated by the Gaussian
1
p

2π`2 (t/s)

exp{−x2 /[2`2 (t/s)]}

for x ∈ R. By comparing this result with the continuum
description given by a one–dimensional diffusion equation u̇ = Du00 with diffusion coefficient D we get the
identification
2Ds = `2

(B1)

allowing to compare lattice and continuum results.

FIG. 1. Rule for the site close to the pore. The black solid circle denotes the pore, the open circles denote sites of the lattice,
the black arrows denotes jumps that are performed with probability 1/2, the black lines denote jumps that cannot be performed
(probability zero). On the left the behavior of an ion close to the pore in the high–affinity state is depicted: if the pore is
free, the particle jumps with uniform probability 1/2 to one of the 2 nearest neighboring sites; if the pore is occupied, the
particle jumps with uniform probability 1/2 to the nearest neighboring site in the lattice (it cannot enter the pore) and with
probability 1/2 the particle does not leave the site. On the right the behavior of an ion close to the pore in the low–affinity
state is depicted: the particle jumps with uniform probability 1/2 to one of the 2 nearest neighboring sites; If the pore is in the
low–affinity state, the ions behave with the same rule as that for an ion faced to the free pore in the high–affinity state. It is
worth remarking that the pore in the low–affinity state cannot be occupied.
