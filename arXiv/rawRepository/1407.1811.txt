For a system strongly coupled to a heat bath, the quantum coherence of the system and the heat bath plays an important role in the system dynamics. This is
particularly true in the case of non-Markovian noise. We rigorously investigate the
influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced hierarchal equations of
motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in imaginary time, which represents
an inverse temperature. It is shown that the HEOM in real time obtained when we
include the system-bath coherence of the initial thermal equilibrium state possess
the same form as those obtained from a factorized initial state. We find that the
difference in behavior of systems treated in these two manners results from the difference in initial conditions of the HEOM elements, which are defined in path integral
form. We also derive HEOM along the imaginary time path to obtain the thermal
equilibrium state of a system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian bath. Then, we
show that the steady state hierarchy elements calculated from the real-time HEOM
can be expressed in terms of the hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginarytime HEOM. Moreover, we find that the imaginary-time HEOM allow us to evaluate
a number of thermodynamic variables, including the free energy, entropy, internal
energy, heat capacity, and susceptibility. The expectation values of the system energy and system-bath interaction energy in the thermal equilibrium state are also
evaluated.

INTRODUCTION
Quantum open systems have been a subject of fundamental interest for many years.

Problems in this category include those of understanding how the irreversibility of time appears in system dynamics, why macroscopic systems can be treated with classical mechanics
instead of quantum mechanics, how wave functions collapse as a result of measurements
done with macroscopic instruments, and why and how quantum systems approach a thermal equilibrium state through interaction with their environments.1–4 Theories of quantum
open systems have also been used to construct models of practical interest, in particular to
account for line shapes in EPR, NMR5,6 and laser spectra,7 to evaluate chemical reaction
rates8 and electron and charge transfer rates9,10 in chemical physics, and to explore the
lifetimes of quantum entanglement states in quantum information theory.11
The phenomena mentioned above arise from the unavoidable interaction of a system with
its environment. In the quantum mechanical case, dissipative systems are often modeled as
main systems coupled to heat-bath degrees of freedom at finite temperature. This coupling
gives rise to thermal fluctuations and dissipation that drive the systems toward the thermal
equilibrium state. The heat-bath degrees of freedom are then reduced using such methods
as the projection operator method and the path integral method.
The projection operator approach is effective if the interaction between the system and
the bath is weak. If one further assumes that the correlation time of the noise arising from the
interaction with the bath is very short (the Markovian assumption), equations of motion for
the density matrix elements can be derived, and these can be solved numerically. The most
commonly used equations of this kind are the quantum master equations3,4 and the Redfield
equation.5 It has been proven, however, that quantum master equations and the Redfield
equation do not satisfy the necessary positivity condition.12–15 Careful analyses addressing
this problem have been carried out by several researchers.16,17 As a method to preserve
positivity, the rotating wave approximation (RWA), which modifies the interaction between
the system and the heat bath, has been applied.18,19 However, this may alter the thermal
equilibrium state as well as the dynamics of the original total Hamiltonian. Then, building
on these results, it was shown that the violation of the positivity condition results from
the Markovian assumption. Specifically, it was found that even if the dissipation process
is Markovian, the fluctuation process may not be, because it must satisfy the fluctuation3

dissipation theorem.20
The time convolution-less (TCL) master equation has a wider range of applicability than
the quantum master equations and Redfield equation, because it allows the system-bath
interaction to be non-perturbative and fluctuation and dissipation to be non-Markovian.21,22
In order for a non-perturbative treatment to be possible, however, the system Hamiltonian
and the bath interactions of the TCL equation must commute.23,24 Thus, the TCL equation
cannot be used to treat many important problems involving molecules, atoms, and spins
driven by a time-dependent laser or magnetic field. In addition, because of the factorized
nature of the system-bath interaction, in the case of a non-commuting excitation, the TCL
equation cannot be used to calculate nonlinear response functions of the system operator
involved in the optical multidimensional spectrum.25,26
Path integral Monte Carlo simulations do not have the limitations of any of the approaches
discussed above, and for this reason, they are capable of incorporating imaginary path
integrals and unfactorized initial conditions more easily, but this approach is computationally
heavy, because the number of paths to be evaluated grows rapidly with time, while sampling
fails due to the phase cancellation of wave functions.27–29 Much effort has been made to
extend the applicability of this method.30–35 Because this approach can easily incorporate
the semi-classical approximation in the bath, it may have an advantage in the study of
polyatomic systems treated in multi-dimensional coordinates, but applications to this point
incorporating full quantum dynamics have been limited to relatively small systems.
Many of the above-mentioned limitations can be overcome with the hierarchal equations
of motion (HEOM) for the reduced density matrix, which are derived by differentiating
the reduced density matrix elements defined by path integrals.20 This approach was introduced to investigate the connection between the phenomenological stochastic Liouville
equation and the dynamical Hamiltonian theory, and was originally limited to the case in
which the spectral distribution function takes the Drude form (i.e., the Ohmic form with
a Lorentzian cutoff) and the bath temperature is high.36 However, with the inclusion of
low temperature corrections terms, this temperature limitation has been eliminated.37–40 In
addition, with the extension of the dimension of the hierarchy, this approach is capable of
treating a great variety of spectral distribution functions.41–48 This formalism is valuable
because it can treat not only strong system-bath coupling but also quantum coherence between the system and bath, which is essential to calculate nonlinear response functions. The
4

system-bath coherence becomes particularly important if the bath interaction is regarded as
non-Markovian, as was found from nonlinear optical measurements in the late 1980s, when
laser technology reached the femto-second time scale, which is much shorter than the noise
correlation time of environmental molecules.7 The HEOM approach has been used to study
such problems, which include multi-dimensional spectroscopy.49–60 Recently, it was shown
that system-bath coherence also plays an important role in calculations of quantum measures
involving concurrence11 and non-Markovianity61 under multiple external perturbations.62–64
Because the HEOM approach is computationally heavy, a variety of methods have been
developed to study dissipative dynamics in realistic situations.65–72 It has been applied
to the study of multi-dimensional vibrational spectroscopies,52–55 photosynthetic antenna
systems,58–60,73–76 fermion systems,77–79 quantum ratchets,80 resonant tunneling diodes,81,82
and dissociation of tightly bounded electron-hole pairs.83
While the applicability of the HEOM approach continues to expand, the basic nature
of the hierarchy elements has not been thoroughly explored.

The purpose of this pa-

per is to investigate the role of correlated initial equilibrium states in the HEOM formalism. Until this time, the HEOM have been derived by assuming a factorized initial state,
ρ̂tot = exp[−β ĤA ] exp[−β ĤB ], at inverse temperature β, where ĤA and ĤB are the system and bath Hamiltonians, respectively, while the true thermal equilibrium state of the
system is given by ρ̂tot = exp[−β(ĤA + ĤI + ĤB )], where ĤI is the system-bath interaction. The difference between the factorized and correlated initial states becomes large for
strong ĤI . Analysis based on an analytic solution of a Brownian oscillator system indicates
that even if we start from a factorized initial state, the system reaches the true equilibrium state, trB {exp[−β(ĤA + ĤI + ĤB )]}, through transient phenomena arising from the
factorized initial state, for example phenomena known as initial sweeping.84–86 With the
HEOM approach, we have run the HEOM program until all of the hierarchy elements reach
the steady state and then used these elements as the initial conditions of the correlated
thermal equilibrium state. The accuracy of this method has been confirmed by analyzing
multi-dimensional spectra obtained with it.53 Nevertheless, it would be interesting to derive
the HEOM starting from a correlated initial thermal state in order to obtain an analytically derived expression for the system-bath coherence in the HEOM formalism. Moreover,
with a simple generalization, we can also derive the HEOM in imaginary time, which corresponds to the inverse temperature. We show that the imaginary-time HEOM is convenient
5

for obtaining correlated thermal equilibrium states and the thermodynamic variables of the
reduced system.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we present a model Hamiltonian
and its influence functional with correlated initial states. In Sec. III, we derive the HEOM
from the density matrix elements using the influence functional formalism with the correlated initial states given in Sec. II. In Sec. IV, we derive the imaginary-time HEOM, which
is convenient for evaluating correlated thermal equilibrium states and the thermodynamic
quantities of the system. In Sec. V, to confirm the validity and numerical efficiency of our
approach, we report the results of numerical integrations of the HEOM carried out over real
time and imaginary time for a spin-boson system and compare their results. Thermodynamic variables and expectation values for the spin-boson system are also calculated as a
demonstration. Section VI is devoted to concluding remarks.

II.

INFLUENCE FUNCTIONAL WITH CORRELATED INITIAL STATES
We consider a situation in which the system interacts with a heat bath that gives rise to

dissipation and fluctuation in the system. To illustrate this, let us consider a Hamiltonian
expressed as
Ĥtot = ĤA + ĤI + ĤB ,

(1)

where ĤA ≡ HA (â+ , â− ) is the Hamiltonian of the system, denoted by A, defined by the
creation and annihilation operators â+ and â− . The bath degrees of freedom are treated as
an ensemble of harmonic oscillators,

with the momentum, position, mass, and frequency of the jth bath oscillator given by p̂j ,

where V̂ (â+ , â− ) is the system part of the interaction, and αj is the coupling constant
between the system and the jth oscillator.

The heat bath can be characterized by the spectral distribution function, defined by
J(ω) ≡

X ~αj2
δ(ω − ωj ),
2mj ωj
j

(4)

and the inverse temperature, β ≡ 1/kB T , where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Note that if
â+ and â− respectively represent the creation and annihilation operators of spin states, the
above Hamiltonian is the spin-boson Hamiltonian,2,3 which has been studied with various
approaches.5–7,27–29
Now, let us introduce the fermion coherent state |φi, which satisfies â− |φi = φ|φi and
hφ|â+ = φ† hφ|, where φ and φ† are Grassmann numbers (G-numbers).36–38 Note that here we
consider a two-level system, but extension to a multi-level system is also straightforward.42,43
In practice, we can treat a G-number system in the same manner as a c-number system, as
long as we maintain the time order of the operators in the integral. In the path integral
representation, the time propagator of the wave function (the Feynman propagator) for the
total system is expressed as

V × (t) ≡ V (t) − V ′ (t),
V ◦ (t) ≡ V (t) + V ′ (t).

(17)

The functionals V × (t) and V ◦ (t) represent the commutator and anticommutator of V̂ . This
form of the influence functional has been used to analytically study quantum Brownian
systems.85
The first term in Eq.(16) represents a commonly used influence functional derived from
P
the factorized initial conditions.1–3 The collective bath oscillator coordinate, X̂ ≡ j αj x̂j ,

is regarded as a driving force for the system through the interaction −V̂ X̂. The time-

dependent kernels are then represented by iL1 (t) ≡ h[X̂(t), X̂]i and L2 (t) ≡ hX̂(t)X̂ +
X̂ X̂(t)i/2, respectively, where X̂(t) is the Heisenberg representation of the operator X̂.20
The function L2 (t) is analogous to the classical correlation function of the bath induced
noise X(t) and corresponds to the fluctuations. The dissipation corresponding to C̄(t) =
R
− dtL1 (t) is related to L2 (t) through the quantum version of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem, L2 [ω] = ~ω coth(β~ω/2)C̄[ω]/2, which insures that the system evolves toward

the thermal equilibrium state for finite temperatures.4 The second term in Eq.(16) consists
of the cross-terms between the real-time and imaginary-time integrals that describe the
correlation between the initial equilibrium state and the dynamical state at time t. This
term represents the contribution of the correlated initial conditions and can be regarded as
the non-Markovian effects with respect to both real and imaginary times. The last term
describes the influence of the heat bath on the thermal equilibrium state of the system. In
the following sections, in order to derive the imaginary-time HOEM, we consider the full
†
equilibrium state of the system, ρeq [φ̄† , φ̄; β~], by including the last term in ρeq
0 [φ̄ , φ̄; β~].

Note that in the high temperature limit, β~γ ≪ 1, the noise correlation function reduces to

form of Gaussian Markovian noise.36

and we have ρeq [φ̄† , φ̄; β~] = ZB ρ̄[φ̄† , φ̄; β~]. This defines the correlated equilibrium initial
conditions of Eq.(40). In the next section, we derive the equations of motion to evaluate
these hierarchy elements.

REDUCED HIERARCHAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION IN

The thermal equilibrium state ρ̄[φ̄† , φ̄; τ ] at time t = 0 and inverse temperature τ can

hierarchy elements defined by Eq.(45) without the index k h for 0 ≤ h ≤ m. Note that any
exchange of suffixes k i and k j in Eq.(45) that merely results in the permutation of two cosine
factors or two sine factors leaves the total integral unchanged, while one that results in the
arguments of a sine and cosine being exchanged will generally cause the total integral to
change. To truncate the hierarchy equations, we choose some large value of K ′ ≡ m and set
15

the elements at (m + 1)th order to 0. We thus obtain a closed set of equations up to mth
order.
To illustrate the structure of the hierarchy given in Eq.(44), here we write out the equations up to second order. The hierarchy starts from the zeroth-order equation, which is that
for the thermal equilibrium state density matrix:

From the definition, the initial conditions are set as ρ̄ˆ[0:0] (0) = I, where I is the unit
[m:l]
operator, with all other hierarchy elements set to zero. The calculated elements ρ̄ˆk1 ,...,km (β~)

16

must be normalized after the integration over imaginary time is carried out by dividing
by ZA = trA {ρ̄ˆ[0:0] (β~)}. A significant difference between the real-time HEOM, given in
Eq.(40), and the above imaginary-time HEOM is that the former contain damping terms
proportional to γ and νk , whereas the latter contain sinusoidal terms. The imaginary-time
HEOM readily yield the desired quantities, as they are solved by integrating over the predetermined interval from τ = 0 to τ = β~, in contrast to the situation for the real-time
HEOM, in which the integration must be carried out until convergence to the steady state
is realized. Any equilibrium expectation value of the system can be easily evaluated from
ρ̄ˆ[0:0] (β~). Moreover, we can evaluate the imaginary-time correlation functions91 from Eq.
(44) in the same manner that the real-time correlation functions are evaluated from the
real-time HEOM.20
The correlated initial states for the real-time HEOM can be constructed from the hierarchy elements of the imaginary-time HEOM. The relations between the real-time and
imaginary-time HEOM elements are similar to the relations between the expectation value
of the collective bath oscillator coordinate and the real-time HEOM elements.92 Here, we
present the relations between the two sets of elements up to second order in the system-bath
interaction:

The elements ρ̂0,...,jk =2,0,...,0 (0) are obtained by setting k = k ′ in Eq.(56). In practice, in
order to evaluate the HEOM elements in the case of correlated initial conditions from the
imaginary-time HEOM, the cutoff, K ′ , must be comparable to the cutoff of used for the
real-time HEOM given in Eq.(40), K. If we only need the equilibrium distribution, Eq.(52),
however, we may choose K ′ even slightly smaller than K/2.
The equilibrium reduced density matrix has been evaluated from various approaches.93,94
Equation (44) allows us to calculate the same matrix elements using the reduced equation
of motion approach. Moreover, this approach allows us to evaluate the correlated initial
conditions of the real-time HEOM.

NUMERICAL RESULTS: CORRELATED INITIAL CONDITIONS,

THERMODYNAMIC VARIABLES, AND EXPECTATION VALUES
In this section, we report the results of numerical simulations that demonstrate the applicability and validity of the imaginary-time HEOM, given in Eq. (44), for the system
Hamiltonian

ĤA = ω0 σ̂z + ∆σ̂x .

(57)

We chose the system parameters as ω0 = 1 and ∆ = 0 or 1, and the bath parameters as
β = 0.5 ∼ 5, η = 0 ∼ 2, and γ = 0.5 for the system-bath interaction V̂ = σ̂x . We truncated
′

[K +1:l]
the hierarchy by setting ρ̄ˆk1 ,...,kK′ +1 (τ ) = 0 for K ′ = 6 in the imaginary-time HEOM, while
(n)

we truncated by setting ρ̂j1 ,...,jK (t) = 0 for N ≡ n + ΣK
k=1 jk = 10 with K = 7 in the realtime HEOM. The 4th-order Runge-Kutta method was used for both the imaginary-time and
real-time integrations with time steps of ∆τ = 1.0 × 10−4 and ∆t = 5.0 × 10−4 , respectively.
(0)

The real-time HEOM were integrated from the factorized initial conditions ρ0,...,0 (0) and
(n)

ρ̂j1 ,...,jK (0) = 0 at t = 0, and steady states were realized between t = 100 and t = 200.

A.

Correlated initial states
First, we verified the accuracy of the imaginary-time HEOM by comparing the equilibrium

state obtained from them with the steady state distributions obtained from the real-time
HEOM for the temperatures β = 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 with η = 1 and ∆ = 1. We found that the

TABLE I. Hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM and real-time HEOM
for several values of the inverse temperature, β.
(0)

steady-state calculated from the real-time HEOM, ρ̂0,...,0 (0), deviates from the equilibrium
state calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM, ρ̄ˆ [0:0] (β~)/ZA by less than 0.0001% of
difference at β = 0.5. The difference between the two results become larger for larger β and
for deeper hierarchy elements, because we solved the two kinds of HEOM using different
truncation schemes. Other than this difference, however, the imaginary-time HEOM results
are consistent with the real-time HEOM results. This also indicates that the steady-state
elements obtained from Eq. (40) indeed represent the correlated thermal equilibrium state
defined by Eq.(42).
Note that we must chose K ′ ≈ K in order to accurately calculate the real-time HEOM
elements for the correlated initial conditions from the imaginary-time HEOM. Then, in order
to obtain a better accuracy for deeper hierarchy elements in the imaginary-time HEOM, we
used a small time step in the numerical integrations. For this reason, the computational
costs for the real-time and imaginary-time HEOM were comparable. However, if we merely
needed the equilibrium distribution ρ̄ˆ [0:0] (β~) to one percent accuracy, we could use a smaller
cuttoff K ′ and/or a larger time step for the imaginary-time HEOM and thereby reduce the
computational costs to less than 1% of that for the results reported here.

B.

Partition functions and thermodynamic variables
Although with the real-time HEOM, we can calculate only the probability distribution,

with the imaginary-time HEOM we are able to calculate thermodynamic variables via the
19

partition function of the reduced system, ZA = trA {ρ̄ˆ[0:0] (β~)}. Note that the total partition
function can be expressed as Ztot = ZA ZB , where the partition function of the bath is given
by
ZB =

Y
j

2 sinh

1


β~ωj
2

.

(58)

Because we consider an infinite number of oscillators, however, the partition function of the
bath cannot be determined. For this reason, we consider the system part, ZA , only. We
calculated the Helmholtz free energy, FA = − ln(ZA )/β, the entropy, SA = kB β 2 ∂FA /∂β,
the internal energy, UA = −∂ ln(ZA )/∂β, the heat capacity, CA = −kB β 2 ∂UA /∂β, and the
susceptibility, χA = −(∂F/∂∆), from ZA for several values of β. To obtain these quantities,
we numerically integrated the imaginary-time HEOM for fixed η = 1 and ∆ = 0 to obtain
ZA for β satisfying 0.05 ≥ β ≥ 5 at steps of ∆β = 0.05. For the susceptibility, we also
calculated the free energy for ∆ = 0.05 in order to evaluate the derivative with respect to
∆ at ∆ = 0.025.
The quantities mentioned above obtained using the imaginary-time HEOM are compared in Fig.

1 with the corresponding quantities for a system characterized by the

canonical distribution, ZA0 = trA {exp[−β ĤA ]}, with the same Hamiltonian ĤA (with
∆ = 0) and inverse temperature β. This corresponds to the partition function of the
0
system in the case that the total partition function takes the factorized form Ztot
=

trA {exp[−β ĤA ]}trB {exp[−β ĤB ]}. The thermodynamic quantities are then given by ZA0 =

2 cosh(β~ω0 /2), FA0 = − ln(2 cosh(β~ω0 /2))/β, UA0 = − tanh(β~ω0 /2)/2, SA0 = −kB [(β~ω0/2) tanh(β~ω0 /2)
- ln(2 cosh(β~ω0 /2))], and CA0 = kB (β~ω0 )2 /4 cosh2 (β~ω0 /2). Also, note that the susceptii
h p
bility for finite ∆ is expressed as χ0A = ∆ tanh β~ ω02 + ∆2 )/2 /2. The superscript ”0” on

these quantities indicates that these are calculated using the conventional statistical physics
approach, which is equivalent to assuming a factorized thermal equilibrium state.

As seen in Fig. 2, in both cases of the spin-boson and factorized spin system, the entropy
and internal energy decrease with the inverse temperature, while the heat capacities of both
systems exhibit maxima at inverse temperatures near β = 2, where the thermal excitation
energy becomes comparable to the excitation energy. The entropy in the spin-boson case is
larger than that in the factorized case at lower temperatures because the spin-boson system
involves more degrees of freedom, due to the presence of the system-bath interaction. It is
also seen that the internal energy is systematically lower in the spin-boson case than in the
20

factorized case. This indicates that the bath absorbs some of the system energy through
the interaction. The degree to which the system energy is absorbed by the bath increases
as β approaches the thermal excitation energy of the system and, as a result, the heat
capacity of the spin-boson system becomes smaller than that of the factorized spin system
near the peak position at β = 2. Compared with the other thermodynamic variables, the
difference between the susceptibilities in the two cases is small. This is because the systembath interaction has the same form as the magnetic excitation, and the effects of ∆ are
suppressed by the strong system-bath interaction.
It is important to note here that those states regarded as the thermal equilibrium states
in the two cases compared above are different. In the conventional treatment, the thermal
equilibrium state of the system corresponds to the case of a factorized partition function,
while in the present treatment of the spin-boson system, we consider the thermal equilibrium
state of the total system. Although the difference between the equilibrium thermodynamic
quantities for the spin-boson system and the factorized spin system are rather minor in
the static case considered in Fig. 2, the difference becomes significant when we study the
dynamics of the system, because in this case, the positivity condition is often violated in
the conventional treatment. This may indicate that treatments based on the canonical
distribution are inherently incompatible with dynamical states.

C.

Auxiliary hierarchy elements and expectation values
By utilizing the hierarchy elements, we can calculate expectation values of the system

and bath. For example, the expectation value of the system energy, hĤA i, is obtained from
Eq. (52) as
(0)

FIG. 2. The entropy, S, internal energy, U , heat capacity, C, and susceptibility, χ, of a spin-boson
system (solid curves) and a factorized spin system (dashed curves) as functions of the inverse
temperature, β. The susceptibility, χ, is calculated at ∆ = δ ≪ ω0 , and is normalized by dividing
by δ.

In Fig. 2, we present the expectation values hĤA i and hĤI i and the internal energy of the
system, UA , as obtained by numerically integrating Eq. (44) for various coupling strengths,
η, at β = 1 and β = 3, with a step size of δη = 0.2. At those temperatures, the system part
of the energy increases linearly, while the interaction part decreases linearly as a function
of the coupling strength, η, but the rates of decrease and increase are smaller for lower
temperatures, because the thermal activity of the bath is lower in this regime. We should
mention that the internal energy, UA , contains the system part of the interaction energy but
not the bath part. The system part and bath part of the interaction energies are calculated
as (UA − hĤA i) and hĤI i − (UA − hĤA i), respectively. The internal energy decreases as a
function of η because the system part of the interaction energy also decreases as a function
of η. Both the bath and system parts of the interaction energy decrease as function of η,

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we derived the real-time and imaginary-time HEOM starting from the
influence functional formalism with a correlated thermal initial state. It was shown that the
thermal equilibrium state calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM is equivalent to the
steady state solution of the real-time HEOM. Because the imaginary-time HEOM is defined
in terms of integrals carried out over the definite time interval from τ ′ = 0 to τ ′ = β and
because the elements of the imaginary-time HEOM are real, we were able to calculate the
hierarchy elements more easily in this case than in the case of the real-time HEOM. Moreover,
using the imaginary-time HEOM, we were able to calculate the partition function, and from
this, we could directly obtain several thermodynamic quantities, namely, the free energy,
23

entropy, internal energy, heat capacity, and susceptibility of the system in the dissipative
environment. The expectation values of not only the system energy but also the systembath interaction energy were also evaluated from the hierarchy elements obtained from the
real- and imaginary-time HEOM. We found that for the purpose of studying equilibrium
properties, rather than dynamical behavior, the imaginary-time HEOM is more usueful than
the real-time HEOM.
In this paper, we derived the HEOM for a system in the energy eigenstate representation,
but extension to a system in the coordinate space representation (or the Wigner representation) is straightforward.80–83,95–98 This extension will be helpful for identifying the pure
quantum effects, because we can compare the quantum results with the classical results
obtained from the classical limit of the imaginary-time HEOM.55,80,96

From the definitions L(±t′ ) ≡ ±iL1 (t′ ) + L2 (t′ ) and Eqs.(A11) and (A19), we have the
relations L(iτ ′ ) = L̄(τ ′ ), L(±t′ + iβ~) = L(∓t′ ), and L(t′ + iτ ′ + iβ~) = L(−t′ − iτ ′ ). With
these, the influence phase can be expressed as Eq. (16).
