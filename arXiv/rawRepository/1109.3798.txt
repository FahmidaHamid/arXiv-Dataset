Abstract
In this paper, we study the optimal control of phase models for spiking neuron oscillators. We
focus on the design of minimum-power current stimuli that elicit spikes in neurons at desired times. We
furthermore take the charge-balanced constraint into account because in practice undesirable side effects
may occur due to the accumulation of electric charge resulting from external stimuli. Charge-balanced
minimum-power controls are derived for a general phase model using the maximum principle, where the
cases with unbounded and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of practical importance
since phase models are more accurate for weak forcing. The developed optimal control strategies are
then applied to both mathematically ideal and experimentally observed phase models to demonstrate
their applicability, including the phase model for the widely studied Hodgkin-Huxley equations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The electrical activity of a nervous system and its ability to respond to external electrical
signals have been long-standing subjects of active research. The resulting insights have led to
the innovation of therapeutic procedures for a wide variety of neurological disorders. Deep brain
stimulation is one such method applying electrical pulses to inhibit pathological synchrony among
the neurons [1] and is clinically approved in many countries for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease, essential tremor, and Dystonia [2], [3]. The cardiac pace maker is another example in

medical practices that employs electric pulses to stimulate nervous tissues in order to regulate
a patient’s heart rate [4], [5]. In these and many other neurological applications, the use of
low power electrical stimuli is desired because, for example, high power stimuli are harmful to
biological tissues and the reduction of power consumption in a neurological implant is essential
in order to reduce its sizes and lengthen its lifetime. In addition, it is of clinical importance to
ensure that any external inputs, e.g., currents, applied to stimulate neurons are charge-balanced.
That is, the net amount of the electric charge injected into a neuron over one oscillation cycle
should be kept zero, because high levels of the charge accumulation may trigger irreversible
electro-chemical reactions, resulting in damage of neural tissues and corrosion of electrodes [6].
Many mathematical models have been developed to capture the periodic activities of neuron
oscillators [7], [8], [9], [10] and a well established example is the phase response curve (PRC),
which quantifies the asymptotic phase shift of an oscillator due to an infinitesimal perturbation of
its state [11]. A phase model accurately approximates the behavior of the corresponding full statespace system in the neighborhood of its periodic orbit [12]. Due to their simplicity, phase models
are very popular for modeling and analyzing the dynamics of neuron oscillators. For example,
the patterns of synchrony resulting from the dynamics of an arbitrary network of oscillators
with weak coupling were analyzed using phase models [13], [14], and a chain of coupled phase
oscillators has been used to model the lamprey spinal generator for locomotion [15]. In these
studies, the inputs to the oscillatory systems were initially defined, and the dynamical responses
of neuron populations were analyzed in detail. Recently, as an alternative objective, control
and dynamical systems approaches have been used to manipulate neural activities in a desired
way. For instance, minimum-power controls for spiking neurons at specified time instances were
derived for some mathematically ideal phase models [16], [17] and charge-balanced controls
were calculated using a numerical shooting method [18]. Controllability of a network of neurons
described by phase models has also been investigated [19].
In this article, we consider a general phase model and derive charge-balanced minimum-power
controls for spiking a neuron oscillator at a desired time instance different from its natural spiking
time. Both cases of unbounded and bounded control amplitude are examined. The latter is of
fundamental and practical importance since there exist physical limitations on medical equipment
and safety margins for neural tissues and, more importantly, because phase models are valid under
weak forcing. We show that the bounded optimal control has switching characteristics synthesized

by the unbounded optimal control and the given control bound. The developed optimal control
strategies are then applied to both mathematically ideal, such as sinusoidal, and experimentally
observed, such as Hodgkin-Huxley, PRC’s to demonstrate their applicability. In addition, we
characterize the range of possible spiking times with respect to the given control amplitude for
several phase models. Moreover, we apply the optimal controls derived from the reduced phase
model to the corresponding full state-space model to verify the consistency of these models
through the reduction and the robustness of our optimal control techniques. Such an important
validation is missing in the literature.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present the optimal control problem of
spiking a general phase oscillator. We find the charge-balanced minimum-power control for a
prescribed spiking time with and without a constraint on the control amplitude by using the
maximum principle. In Section III, we apply the derived optimal control strategies to several
commonly-used phase models and present the optimal solutions and numerical simulations. In
particular, we calculate optimal controls for experimentally observed PRC’s including MorrisLecar and Hodgkin-Huxley PRCs. These optimal controls produced by the maximum principle
are verified by the Legendre pseudospectral computational method [20].
II. O PTIMAL

CHARGE - BALANCED CONTROLS FOR SPIKING NEURONS

In systems theory, a nonlinear oscillator is described by a set of ordinary differential equations
that has a stable periodic orbit. This system of equations can be reduced to a single first order
differential equation, which is valid while the state of the full system remains in a neighborhood
of its unforced periodic orbit [11]. This reduction allows us to represent the dynamics of a
weakly forced oscillator by a single phase variable that defines the evolution of the oscillation.
Consider a time-invariant system ẋ = f (x, I), where x(t) ∈ Rn is the state and I(t) ∈ R is the
control, which has an unforced stable attractive periodic orbit γ(t) = γ(t + T ) homeomorphic
to a circle, satisfying γ̇ = f (γ, 0). We can represent this system in a phase-reduced form as
θ̇ = f (θ) + g(θ)I(t),

(1)

where θ is the phase variable, f and g are real-valued functions, and I(t) ∈ R is the control
[11], [12]. One complete oscillation of the system corresponds to θ ∈ [0, 2π). The function f
gives system’s baseline dynamics and g is known as the phase response curve (PRC), which

describes the infinitesimal sensitivity of the phase to an external control input. In the case of
neural oscillators, I represents an external current stimulus and f is referred to the instantaneous
oscillation frequency in the absence of any external input, i.e., I = 0. Neuron spiking occurs
when the oscillator evolves through one complete cycle. As a convention, the occurrence of spikes
takes place at θ = 2nπ, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. We consider spiking a neuron at a prescribed time
with a minimum-power stimulus and, furthermore, intend to find a charge-balanced one in order
to minimize the side-effects cause by the accumulation of electric charge. The design of such
charge-balanced minimum-power current stimuli for spiking neurons gives rise to a constrained
optimal steering problem for a single-input nonlinear system of the form

Rt
p(t) = 0 I(σ)dσ, with boundary conditions p(0) = p(T ) = 0, is introduced to accommodate the

charge-balanced constraint. In the following, we first consider the case of an unbounded control,
namely, M = ∞, and then extend the result to the case when the control is bounded.
A. Charge-Balanced Minimum-Power Control with Unconstrained Amplitude
Relaxing the amplitude constraint by letting M = ∞, we apply the maximum principle to
characterize the extremal trajectories. The Hamiltonian of the optimal control problem (P) is
given by
H = λ0 I 2 + λ(f (θ) + g(θ)I) + µI,

(2)

where λ0 , λ, and µ are Lagrange multipliers associated with the Lagrangian, system dynamics,
and the charge-balanced constraint, respectively. Here we consider normal extremals which are
found by taking λ0 6= 0. Note that more specific abnormal extremals found by letting λ0 = 0 can

be analyzed according to the expressions and properties of the functions f and g. Our derivations
here are made for the general phase model, and therefore these extraordinary cases are omitted.
Abnormal extremals are in general uncommon in phase models, and none of the phase models
considered in this paper has an abnormal extremal (see Remark 2 in Section III-A). Therefore,
without loss of generality, we let λ0 = 1. The optimality condition from the maximum principle
demands that

∂H
∂I

= 0 along the optimal trajectory, which yields
I=−

λg(θ) + µ
.

(3)

The adjoint variables λ and µ are solutions to the time-varying differential equations λ̇ = − ∂H
∂θ

. Together with (3) these equations can be written as

which implies that µ is a constant. In addition, since the Hamiltonian is not explicitly dependent
on time, H is a constant along the optimal trajectory. Hence, we let H = c, ∀ t ∈ [0, T ]. This
can also be seen from the transversality condition of the maximum principle.
It follows that the optimal multiplier λ can be found from (2) by substituting (3) for I. Then,
solving for λ yields
p
−µg + 2f ± 2 f 2 − gµf − g 2 c
λ=

g2

(6)

Here we will choose the negative square root because the positive case corresponds to a backward
evaluation of the phase, which would invalidate the phase model. The phase velocity equation
along the optimal trajectory can then be found by using (6), (3), and (1), resulting in
p
θ̇ = f 2 − gµf − g 2 c.

(7)

In addition, substituting (6) into (3) gives rise to the optimal control I ∗ in terms of the two
constants µ and c,
I∗ =

For a given spiking time T , the constants c and µ can be determined from (7) by separation of

Now the optimal control is completely classified by (8), because the constants µ and c can be
found from (9) and (10) for any specified spiking time T .
Remark 1: In the absence of the charge-balanced constraint, corresponding to µ = 0, it is
sufficient to characterize the optimal control by (8) and (9).
B. Charge-Balanced Minimum-Power Control with Constrained Amplitude
In practice, the feasible amplitude of the stimulus is limited, and phase models are valid only
for weak forcing. Therefore, spiking neurons with controls of bounded amplitude is of practical
importance. In this case where we assume that |I| ≤ M, ∀ t ∈ [0, T ], the minimum and maximum
possible spiking times for a neuron system can be determined. It is easy to see that for a given
bound M > 0, the minimum spiking time is achieved by

 M,
g(θ) ≥ 0

(11)

which keeps the phase velocity at its maximum. The minimum spiking time for a given value

B = {θ| g(θ) < 0, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π} .

Symmetric to the minimum spiking time, the maximum spiking time, denoted Tmax

and it is given by Tmax

bound M ≥ min{| fg(θ)

It is obvious that if |I ∗ (θ)| ≤ M, ∀ θ ∈ [0, 2π), then the amplitude constraint is inactive and I ∗

as in (8) is the charge-balanced minimum-power control. While |I ∗ | > M for some θ ∈ [0, 2π),

7

it is sufficient to consider the case when I ∗ > M because the case I ∗ < −M is symmetric.

Suppose that I ∗ > M for θ ∈ (θ1 , θ2 ) ⊂ [0, 2π), we now show that the bang control I = M is
optimal for θ ∈ [θ1 , θ2 ]. Since the Hamiltonian (2) is a convex function of I, I = M is then the

minimizer when I ∗ > M for θ ∈ [θ1 , θ2 ]. In this case, we have, from (2), the Lagrange multiplier
λ=

c − M 2 − µM
,
f (θ) + Mg(θ)

(13)

which satisfies the adjoint equation (4), and hence I(θ) = M is optimal for θ ∈ [θ1 , θ2 ]. Similarly,

the same approach can be used to show that I = −M is optimal on the interval over which I ∗ <
−M. Therefore, the charge-balanced minimum-power control with limited control amplitude M
is of the form with switching characteristic

III. E XAMPLE
We now apply our optimal control strategies to several commonly-used phase models characterized by various PRC’s, including mathematically ideal models, such as sinusoidal PRC,
SNIPER PRC, and theta neuron PRC, as well as more realistic phase models such as HodgkinHuxley and Morris-Lecar PRC’s. These mathematically ideal phase models are approximations to
full state-space models at certain bifurcation points, whereas Hodgkin-Huxley and Morris-Lecar
phase models are obtained numerically by perturbing their periodic orbits using unit impulses.

A. Sinusoidal Phase Model
The sinusoidal phase model is characterized by a sinusoidal PRC [11],
θ̇ = ω + zd (sin θ)I,

(17)

where ω is the natural oscillation frequency of the system, zd is a model-dependent constant,
and I is the external stimulus. This is a type II PRC, with both positive and negative regions,
which results from a periodic orbit near the supercritical Hopf bifurcation [11], and occurs in
neuron models such as the abstracted FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model [21]. Neurons described
by this phase model spike periodically with the natural period T0 = 2π/ω in the absence of any
external input.
Observe from (8) that with f and g as defined above, I ∗ (θ) is anti-symmetric around θ = π,
namely, I ∗ (θ) = −I ∗ (θ + π) for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. Therefore, the charge-balanced constraint is
automatically fulfilled for the sinusoidal phase model. As a result, we let µ = 0.
1) Unbounded Control for Sinusoidal Phase Model: Substituting f = ω and g = zd sin θ with
µ = 0 into (8) and (9), the optimal control for spiking a sinusoidal neuron at time T is

A simple example is used to demonstrate these results. For a neuron with the natural oscillation
frequency ω = 1 and zd = 1, the optimal controls for the desired spiking times T = 4 and
T = 9, smaller and greater, respectively, than the natural spiking time T0 = 2π are shown in
Fig. 1(a). The corresponding optimal phase trajectories are depicted in Fig. 1(b).
Remark 2: Abnormal extremals in general do not exist in phase models. Consider the case
of abnormal extremals for the sinusoidal phase model, where the multiplier λ0 = 0. Then, the
Hamiltonian as in (2) is given by H = λω + λzd (sin θ)I + µI, and the optimality condition of
the maximum principle gives
∂H
= λzd sin θ + µ = 0.
∂I

(20)

Differentiating this equation with respect to time, we obtain
λzd (cos θ)θ̇ + λ̇zd sin θ + µ̇ = 0.

Substituting (17), (4), and (5) into (21) for θ̇, λ̇, and µ̇, respectively, yields
ωλzd cos θ = 0.

(22)

Abnormal extremals must satisfy (22), and it is clear that (22) holds only when λ ≡ 0. This
leads to µ ≡ 0 from (20), which, together with λ ≡ 0, violate the nontriviality condition of the
maximum principle.
2) Bounded Control for Sinusoidal Phase Model: As presented in Section II-B, with the
amplitude constraint |I(t)| ≤ M, ∀ t ∈ [0, T ], there exists a range of times at which a neuron
can be fired. According to (12) for zd > 0, the minimum possible spiking time is given by

Observe from (17) that when M ≥ ω/zd , arbitrarily large spiking times can be achieved by

making θ̇ arbitrary close to zero. Therefore, the maximum spiking time Tmax
is given by Tmin

if the amplitude of the unbounded optimal control satisfies |I ∗ | ≤ M for all t ∈ [0, T ], or

equivalently, ∀ θ ∈ [0, 2π), then the amplitude constraint is inactive and I ∗ will be the charge-

balanced minimum-power control for this bound M. There exists a shortest possible spiking

6(b), we show unbounded optimal controls in the absence and presence of the charge-balanced
constraint and the resulting trajectories of a SNIPER neuron with ω = 1 and zd = 1. Note that
the optimal controls without considering the charge-balanced constraint are obtained by taking
µ = 0. Fig. 7 illustrates bounded charge-balanced minimum-power controls for spiking the same
neuron system at various spiking times which are grater and smaller than its natural spiking
period T0 = 2π. We present controls driving the neuron from θ = 0 to θ = 2π at various times,

C. Theta Neuron Phase Model
The theta neuron phase model is defined by f (θ) = 1 + cos θ + (1 − cos θ)Ib and g(θ) =
(1 − cos θ), where Ib is known as the neuron baseline current [17]. If Ib > 0, then the neuron
√
spikes with the period T0 = π/ Ib in the absence of any external current I(t). When Ib ≤ 0,
the neuron does not spike autonomously but it can be fired by the use of an input I(t). Since
for Ib > 0 this neuron model can be transformed to the SNIPER phase model by a coordinate
transformation [17], we focus here on the case of Ib < 0. Similarly, the unbounded and bounded
charge-balanced minimum-power controls can be directly calculated by employing (8), (9), and
(10), or (14), (15), and (16) in Section II, respectively. Optimal controls for spiking a theta

The above phase models, though commonly used, are ideal mathematical models of neuron
oscillators. We now apply our optimal control strategies to models with experimentally observed
PRC’s, such as Hodgkin-Huxley and Morris-Lecar phase models, to demonstrate their applicability and generality.
D. Morris-Lecar Phase Model
The Morris-Lecar model was originally proposed to capture the oscillating voltage behavior
of giant barnacle muscle fibers (see Appendix B) [9]. Over the past years this model has been
extensively studied and used as a standard model for representing many different real neurons
that are experimentally observable. For example, it has been found that Morris-Lecar PRC is
extremely similar to the experimentally observed PRC’s of Aplysia motoneuron [23]. The phase
model of the Morris-Lecar neuron is given by
θ̇ = ω + Z(θ)I(t),

(26)

where ω is the natural oscillation frequency and Z(θ) represents the PRC which can be calculated
numerically from the ODE system in Appendix B by the software package XPP [24]. For the
set of parameter values given in Appendix B, the natural frequency ωM L = 0.283 rad/ms and
the PRC is depicted in Fig. 9(a). The charge-balanced minimum-power controls that elicit spikes

for this phase model at various times are shown in Fig. 9(b). We consider six different cases for
which the optimal controls have zero, two, and four switchings for spiking times that are longer
and shorter than the natural spiking time, T0 = 2π/ωM L = 22.202 ms.

E. Hodgkin-Huxley Phase Model
The Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model is a four dimensional system that describes the propagation
and initiation of the action potential in squid axon (see Appendix C) [7]. The phase model for
this neuron oscillator is also of the form as in (26). For the set of parameter values given in
Appendix C, the system has a natural frequency ωHH = 0.4292 rad/ms and its PRC is displayed
in Fig. 10(a). The charge-balanced minimum-power controls that elicit spikes at different time
instances are shown in Fig. 10(b).
Finally, we verified these optimal controls derived with the maximum principle by using the
Legendre pseudospectral method. This computational method is a direct and powerful method for
solving continuous-time optimal control problems. The basic principle is described in Appendix
D and those readers interested in this method can refer to the recent comprehensive work in
this area [25], [26], [27], [28]. The optimal controls generated by this pseudospectral method
are presented in Fig.11, which show excellent agreement with the theoretically calculated ones
given in Fig.10(b).
Phase models characterize the reduced dynamic behavior of the underlying oscillating systems,
where the phase, but not the full state, can be observed. There is a fundamental need to explore

because this important validation is largely lacking in the literature. The optimal controls for
phase models presented so far in this work change the spiking times of an oscillator during the
course of one oscillatory cycle, so that a desired spike train can be constructed by repeating the
control input. We now apply the optimal controls derived according to the scalar Hodgkin-Huxley
phase model to its full state-space model, which is a system of four differential equations as
shown in Appendix C. The spike train obtained by repeated application of the optimal control
producing an inter-spike time T = 16 ms, subject to the control amplitude bound M = 1 mA,
and the uncontrolled train spiking at the natural period, T0 = 2π/ωHH = 14.64 ms, are illustrated

IV. D ISCUSSION
In this paper, we considered the optimal control of phase models of neuron oscillators. We
derived charge-balanced minimum-power current stimuli that elicit spikes of neurons at desired
time instances for the cases of unbounded and bounded control amplitude. In particular, we
showed that for the bounded case the optimal control has switching characteristics synthesized
by the unbounded optimal control and the control bound. We implemented the resulting analytical
optimal controls to various commonly used phase models, including mathematically ideal and
experimentally observed models, to demonstrate their applicability. We then applied the optimal
controls derived according to the phase-reduced model of Morris-Lecar and Hodgkin-Huxley to
the corresponding full state-space system to validate the approximation of the phase model under
weak forcing. The theory presented in this work can be applied not only to neuron oscillators but
also to any oscillating systems that can be represented using similar model reduction techniques
such as biological, chemical, electrical, and mechanical oscillators.
The theoretical results presented in this paper characterize the fundamental limit of how the
dynamics of neurons can be perturbed by the use of external inputs. Alternatively, they provide
an insight into how the neuron dynamics determine the synaptic input necessary for eliciting
spikes, which facilitates the development of optimal stimuli for neurological treatments such as
deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease. The extension of this work to the optimal control
of networks of neuron oscillators is of fundamental and practical importance. Our recent work

September 20, 2011

has shown that a ensemble of uncoupled neurons is controllable, and that the minimum-power
controls that spike a network of heterogeneous neurons can be found by using a multidimensional
pseudospectral method [19]. We plan to extend this recent work to investigate controllability of
coupled neurons and related optimal control problems. Systems described by the Kuramoto
model will be considered.

Simple first and second order optimality conditions applied to (18) find that the maximum
value of I ∗ occurs at θ = π/2 for c < 0 and at θ = 3π/2 for c > 0 (see Fig.13(a) for c < 0).
According to (19), c = 0 corresponds to T = 2π/ω and c < 0 (c > 0) corresponds to T < 2π/ω
(T > 2π/ω). Therefore, the constant c for the shortest spiking time with the control I ∗ satisfying
|I ∗ (t)| ≤ M can be calculated by substituting I ∗ = M and θ = π/2 to (18), and then from (19)

we have |I ∗ | ≤ (ω − ω 2 − czd2 )/zd , which leads to |I ∗ | < ω/zd ≤ M for T > 2π/ω, provided

that M ≥ ω/zd . This implies that I ∗ is the minimum-power control for any desired spiking time

as in (23), I ∗ as described in (18) and (19) will be the optimal control for any

Then, from (13), the Lagrange multiplier is λ = (H − M 2 )/(ω + zd M sin θ). This multiplier
satisfies the adjoint equation (4), therefore I(θ) = M is optimal for θ ∈ [θ1 , θ2 ]. Similarly, by

PSEUDOSPECTRAL METHOD FOR OPTIMAL CONTROL OF PHASE - REDUCED
OSCILLATORS

The pseudospectral method is a spectral collocation method that was originally developed
to solve partial differential equations, and has recently been adapted to solve optimal control
problems [20], [26], [27], [28], [25], [29]. In this approach the differential equations that relate
the states and the controls are discretized at specific collocation nodes, which results in a discrete
optimization problem. All continuous-time functions are rescaled to the time domain of [-1,1]
and expanded by an orthogonal polynomial basis based on a set of selected quadrature nodes
