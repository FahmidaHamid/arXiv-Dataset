Any macroscopic deformation of a filamentous bundle is necessarily accompanied
by local sliding and/or stretching of the constituent filaments. Yet the nature of the sliding
friction between two aligned filaments interacting through multiple contacts remains
largely unexplored. Here, by directly measuring the sliding forces between two bundled Factin filaments, we show that these frictional forces are unexpectedly large, scale
logarithmically with sliding velocity as in solid-like friction, and exhibit complex
dependence on the filaments' overlap length. We also show that a reduction of the frictional
force by orders of magnitude, associated with a transition from solid-like friction to Stokes'
drag, can be induced by coating F-actin with polymeric brushes. Furthermore, we observe
similar transitions in filamentous microtubules and bacterial flagella. Our findings
demonstrate how altering a filament's elasticity, structure and interactions can be used to
engineer interfilament friction and thus tune the properties of fibrous composite materials.
Filamentous bundles are a ubiquitous structural motif used for assembly of diverse
synthetic, biomimetic and biological materials1-4. Any macroscopic deformation of such bundles
is necessarily accompanied by local sliding and/or stretching of the constituent filaments 4,5.
1

Consequently, the frictional forces that arise due to interfilament sliding are an essential
determinant of the overall mechanical properties of filamentous bundles. Here, we measure
frictional forces between filamentous actin (F-actin) which is an essential building block of
diverse biological and biomimetic materials. We bundle F-actin filaments by adding nonadsorbing polymer Poly(Ethylene Glycol) (PEG). As two filaments approach each other,
additional free-volume becomes available to PEG coils, leading to the effective attractions
interactions, known as the depletion interaction in physics and chemistry and macromolecular
crowding in biology ( Supplementary Fig. 1a)6. Besides radial interactions, the depletion
mechanism also leads to interactions along the filaments’ long axis. While the former have been
extensively studied using osmotic stress techniques7, little is known about equally important
sliding interactions.
To measure sliding interactions we bundle a pair of actin filaments. Each filament is
attached to a gelsolin coated micron-sized bead. Such beads bind exclusively to F-actin barbed
end, thus determining the attached filament polarity. Two filaments are held together by
attractive depletion forces; subsequently, bead 2 is pulled at a constant velocity with an optical
trap while force on bead 1 is simultaneously measured (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Movie S1). At
first, the force increases as the thermally induced filament slack is pulled out. Subsequently, the
force reaches a plateau and thereafter remains constant even as the interfilament overlap length
changes by many microns (Fig. 1c). Finally, as the overlap length becomes smaller than a
characteristic length scale, the frictional force decreases exponentially and vanishes as the two
filaments unbind. Increasing the sliding velocity yields a similar force profile, the only difference
being a slightly elevated plateau force Fmax. Repeating these experiments at different velocities
reveals that Fmax exhibits logarithmic dependence on the sliding velocity (Fig. 1d). The strength
2

and range of the attractive depletion potential is tuned by changing polymer concentration and
size respectively. This feature allows us to directly relate interfilament sliding friction to
cohesive interactions, by simply changing PEG concentration. Stronger cohesion leads to larger
plateau force, Fmax (Fig. 1d).
These experiments reveal several notable features of sliding friction between a pair of Factin filaments. First, even for the weakest cohesion strength required for assembly of stable
bundles, the frictional force is several pN’s, comparable to the force exerted by myosin motors.
Second, above a critical value, the frictional force is independent of the interfilament overlap
length. Third, the plateau force, Fmax, exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the sliding velocity.
These observations are in sharp contrast with models that approximate biopolymers as a
structureless filament interacting through excluded volume interactions. Frictional coupling
between such homogeneous filaments would be dominated by hydrodynamic interactions,
resulting in forces that are linearly dependent on both the pulling velocity and overlap length,
and orders of magnitude weaker than those measured. Since these features are not observed
experimentally we exclude hydrodynamic interactions as a dominant source of frictional
coupling and reconsider the basic physical processes at work.

filaments. (a) Schematic of the experimental setup. Actin filaments attached to gelsolin coated beads are
assembled into anti-parallel bundles using optical traps. Bead 2 is pulled at a constant velocity while
simultaneously measuring the force exerted on bead 1. (b) A sequence of images illustrates two filaments

indicates the pulling direction (Supplementary Movie S1). (c) Time dependence of the frictional force

force F/Fmax on the interfilament overlap length. Force profiles taken at different sliding velocities rescale
onto a universal curve (Eq. 1), defining a velocity independent frictional kink width . (f) Stronger
cohesion leads to smaller . For all experiments, the salt concentration is 200 mM KCl.

Certain aspects of the frictional interactions between actin filaments can be understood by
studying the sliding dynamics of two commensurate 1D lattices of beads and springs under shear
(Fig. 2a). The lattices do not slide past each other rigidly. Instead, the mechanism of sliding
involves the propagation of localized excitations called kinks that carry local compression of the
lattice (Fig. 2b). Every time a kink propagates across the filament the two intercalating lattices
slide by one lattice spacing. Sliding happens locally, yielding a frictional force that is controlled
by the kink width, , rather than the total overlap length, L, provided that L >> as is typically
the case in conventional friction. However, in our experiments the filament overlap can be
controlled from nanometers to many microns allowing us to examine the regime where L. In
this regime, a propagating kink cannot fully develop and the sliding force exhibits a dependence
on L.
These arguments can be quantitatively rationalized within the framework of the FrenkelKontorova model8,9. The sliding filament is modeled as a 1D lattice of length L comprising beads
connected by springs with stiffness constant, k. The lattice periodicity is given by the actin
monomer spacing, d. The interaction with the stationary filament is modeled by a commensurate
sinusoidal background potential of depth, U0, and periodicity d. In the continuum limit the bead
𝑢(𝑥)

displacement field, u(x) satisfies the Sine-Gordon equation, 𝜆2 𝑢𝑥𝑥 = sin (

𝑑

) , which admits a

𝑥

static kink solution of the form 𝑢𝑠 (𝑥) = 4𝑑 tan−1 (𝑒 −𝜆 ), where  is the kink width that
corresponds to the length of the lattice that is distorted (see Supplementary Methods). Kink
width is determined by the ratio of filament stiffness to the stiffness of the background potential:
𝜆2 = 𝑘𝑑 4 /𝑈0 . For very stiff filaments such as F-actin an imposed distortion will extend over
many lattice spacings.

Figure 2. 1D-Frenkel-Kontorova model accounts for the essential features of interfilament sliding
friction. (a) Schematic of a model in which a sliding filament is approximated as a periodic lattice of
points connected by stiff springs. A sinusoidal background potential models the interaction with the
stationary filament. (b) Schematic of how a filament slides by one lattice spacing in a response to an
applied pulling force (Supplementary Movie S2). For filaments with finite extensibility the applied force
decays over a characteristic lengthscale that is determined by the ratio of spring stiffness and the stiffness
of the background potential. The first bead hoping over the rightmost barrier is accompanied by soliton
formation that propagates leftwards. Once the soliton reaches the leftmost bead the entire filament is
translated by a lattice spacing d.

We first consider the case L  and assume that the finite size chain located from x=-L
to x=0 is gradually pulled out at x=0. The pulling force, F, displaces the right-most bead to the
maximum of the potential (i.e. u(0)=d/2) generating a strain field, ux(x), that decays
exponentially inside the sample with a characteristic length . Once the right-most bead hops
over the maximum in the potential, the whole lattice slides by d and every bead falls to the
bottom of the respective potential generating a state of vanishing strain and energy. Repeating
this process n times translates the left-most edge from –L to –L+nd. The work done by the
pulling force in the nth run, F(n) d, is the energy difference between the elastic energy stored in
the kink configuration us(x) and the uniform state u(x)=0, which has zero energy. Since the
6

elastic energy is proportional to Fmax d Sech2(x/) over the part of the chain still interacting with
the background potential (i.e. from x=L+nd to x=0), the resulting force reads:
𝐹(𝑛) = 𝐹𝑚𝑎𝑥 tanh (

𝐿−𝑛𝑑
𝜆

)

(Eq. 1),

where L-nd represents the remaining overlap length between the two filaments. If the overlap
length is larger than the kink width (L > , F(n) saturates at Fmax. In this limit a kink nucleated
at the right-most edge can fully develop and propagate down the chain, progressively shifting the
particles it leaves behind (see Supplementary Fig. 2. and Movie S2). As a result the force ceases
to depend on the overlap length. Instead it is set by the kink widthwhich remains equal to the
static value , unaffected by the kink dynamics in the overdamped regime (see Supplementary
Information).
Experiments reveal that Fmax scales logarithmically with the pulling speed, v (Fig. 1d).
The intuitive reason for this dependence is that as the lattice is pulled, the particles within the
kink undergo thermally assisted hopping through the periodic background potential. A classical
model,

predicts:
(Eq.2)

where T is the temperature and 1/fc is the relaxation time of a monomer in a potential energy
well10-13. Fitting Eq. 2 to the plateau value of the force-velocity curves reveals that the
periodicity of the background potential is ~5 nm (Supplementary Table S1), in quantitative
agreement with F-actin monomer spacing14. This result suggests that cohering F-actin monomers
intercalate with each other, and sliding interactions require monomers to either deform or hop
over each other.

7

Eq. 1 predicts that the force profiles taken at varying pulling speeds should fall onto a
master curve once rescaled by Fmax(v). This data collapse is demonstrated in Fig. 1e
(Supplementary Table S2). It yields experimental measurement of velocity-independent kink
𝑘𝑑4

width,  which we compare to the theoretical prediction 𝜆 = √ 𝑈 . We take the lattice
0

periodicity to be 5.5 nm14 and k to be ~7000 pN/nm15. To estimate Uo we measure the strength of
the depletion induced attraction by allowing an isolated filament to fold into a racquet-like
configuration (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d)16. The size of the racquet head is directly related to the
filament cohesion strength per unit length, Uo. Without any adjustable parameters our theoretical
model predicts values of which are of the same order of magnitude as those extracted from
experiments (Supplementary Table S3). Increasing depletant concentration increases Uo, leads to
a decrease in , which is again in agreement with the theoretical prediction. In summary, we
have demonstrated that the tunable kink width critically determines the dependence of frictional
force on the overlap length between the two intercalating nanofilaments. A lengthscale similar to
 arises in many other materials science contexts, such as shearing of double stranded DNA17,18.
Previous experiments have uncovered directionally dependent friction in both biological
and synthetic materials19-21. To investigate the directional dependence of interfilament sliding
friction between polar actin filaments we have altered the experimental configuration by
attaching beads to both ends of one filament (Supplementary Fig. 3). Using this configuration we
find that Fmax for sliding anti-parallel filaments is approximately twice as large compared to
filaments with parallel alignment (Fig. 3a, b). While Fmax is different, the scaling of frictional
force with velocity and filament overlap length is the same for both orientations indicating that
same physics describes sliding of both polar and anti-polar filaments. Furthermore, we also

8

investigate stress relaxation upon an application of a step strain (Fig. 3c). For parallel
configuration the applied stress quickly relaxes to a finite but small force. In contrast, for antiparallel orientation the applied stress relaxes on much longer time scales. These experiments
indicate that the axial interaction potential between sliding F-actin filaments is polar and thus
sliding actin filaments can act as molecular ratchets (Fig. 3d).

Figure 3. Interfilament sliding friction depends on relative filament polarity. (a) Two profiles describing
time dependent frictional force. The only difference is the relative filament polarity. (b) The plateau force,
Fmax, exhibits pronounced directional dependence. (c) Relaxation of a force upon application of a step
strain. For parallel filaments the force quickly relaxes to a small but finite value. For anti-parallel
filaments the force relaxes on much longer timescales. (d) Schematic representation of actin filaments
that account for the directional dependence of sliding friction. Anti-parallel and parallel arrangements
correspond to schemes I and II, respectively. We are not able to measure friction for configuration III. All
experiments were performed at salt concentration of 400 mM KCl.

Armed with a basic understanding of filament sliding friction we next devise practical methods
to tune its magnitude. One possible method to accomplish this is by changing filament structure.
We decorated F-actin with a covalently attached PEG brush. In this system, friction was
quantified by visualizing sliding dynamics of bundled filaments. Native F-actin bundles did not
exhibit any thermally driven sliding in agreement with our previous measurements (Fig. 4a). In
contrast, PEG coated F-actin formed bundles in which individual filaments freely slid past each
other due to thermal fluctuations (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Movie S3). To extract quantitative
data, we measure the mean square displacement (MSD) of the relative position of the short
filament with respect to the longer filament to which it is bound (Fig. 4c). The linear MSD
curves are consistent with hydrodynamic coupling between PEG coated filaments; the slope
yields the diffusion of a bound filament which is 5-fold smaller than that of an isolated
filament22. It follows, that the hydrodynamic friction coefficient of a bundled 5 m long filament
is ~ 10-4 pN s/nm. Pulling such a filament at 100 nm/sec would result in a 10 fN force, which is
three orders of magnitude smaller than the comparable forces measured for bare F-actin. This
demonstrates how simple structural modifications greatly alter the sliding filament friction. We
compare these results with those for another important biopolymer, a microtubule. Previous
study has shown that unlike F-actin sliding friction of microtubule is weak and dominated by
hydrodynamic interactions (Fig. 4d)23. Microtubule surfaces are coated with a charged
disordered amino-acid domain known as e-hooks24. We hypothesize that these domains might act
as an effective polyelectrolye brush, screening molecular interactions and thus lowering sliding
friction. To test this hypothesis we remove e-hooks with an appropriate protease. When treated in
such a way microtubule bundles do not exhibit any interfilament sliding indicating much higher

10

sliding friction (Fig. 4e,f). Such observations agree with previous studies which have shown that
brush-like surfaces can drastically lower friction coefficients25.

Figure 4. Filament surface structure controls the transition from solid to hydrodynamic friction. (a) A
sequence of images illustrates the relative diffusion of a bundled pair of unmodified F-actin filaments.
The brighter region, indicating the filament overlap area, is frozen at a specific location due to absence of
any thermally induced filament sliding. (b) F-actin filaments coated with a PEG polymer brush exhibit
thermally driven sliding, due to a significantly reduced frictional coupling (Supplementary Movie S3). (c)
For PEG-coated bundles, mean square displacement (MSD) of the short filament with respect to the
longer filament increases linearly with time, indicating a hydrodynamic coupling. Inset: Relative position

Untreated microtubule bundles exhibit diffusive sliding that is dominated by hydrodynamic coupling. (e)
Removing brush like e-hooks from microtubule surface leads to bundles that exhibit no sliding. (f) MSDs

Figure 5. Sliding dynamics of MTs and bacterial flagella. (a) Microtubule sliding dynamics depends on
the depletant concentration and suspension ionic strength. At low depletant concentration and ionic
strength filaments remain unbundled. To induce bundle formation it is necessary to either increase
depletant concentration or decrees electrostatic screening length. In this regime bundles exhibit sliding
dynamics. With increasing ionic strength or depletant concentration sliding filaments undergo a sharp
crossover into a state with no detectable sliding indicating a stronger frictional coupling. (b) Straight
bundled flagellar filaments exhibit sliding similar to that of microtubule bundles.

Alternatively frictional coupling can be tuned by engineering lateral interfilament
interactions. We examined how sliding dynamics of three different filaments (F-actin,
microtubules, bacterial flagella) depends on the strength of lateral filament attraction, which is
controlled by the depletant concentration, and average filament separation, which is tuned by the
ionic strength (Fig. 5). Microtubules and bacterial flagella exhibited two distinct dynamical
states. For low depletant concentration (weak attraction) and low ionic strength the filaments
have large lateral separation and freely slide past each other. Such dynamics indicates weak
frictional coupling that is dominated by hydrodynamic interactions. Increasing depletant
concentration or ionic strength above a critical threshold induces a sharp transition into a distinct
dynamical state that exhibits no measurable sliding even after tens of minutes of observation
time. The sliding dynamics of flagella and microtubules are remarkably similar to each other. In
comparison, native F-actin filaments only displayed a non-sliding state indicative of solid-like
friction, for all parameters explored. The observation of non-sliding dynamics in three
12

structurally diverse filaments suggests that solid-like frictional coupling is a common feature of
biological filaments.
To summarize, the mechanical properties of composite filamentous bundles are not only
determined by the rigidity of the constituent filaments but also by their inter-filament
interactions, such as the cohesion strength and sliding friction26. Therefore, quantitative models
of composite bundle mechanics must account for inter-filament sliding friction. We have
demonstrated an experimental technique that enables measurement of such forces. We directly
measured frictional forces between chemically identical F-actin filaments thus bridging the gap
between previous studied friction of sliding point-like contacts27,28 and 2D surface29-31.
Combining such measurements with simulations and theoretical modeling we have described
design principles required to engineer inter-filament friction and thus tune properties of
frictionally interacting composite filamentous materials.

Methods: Actin and Gelsolin were purified according to previously published protocols. Actin
filaments were polymerized in high salt buffer and subsequently stabilized with Alexa-488phalloidin. Gelsolin was covalently coupled to one micron carboxylic coated silica beads by 1Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride. All experiments were performed
in buffer suspension containing 20mM Phosphate at pH=7.5, 300mg/mL sucrose and either
200mM or 400mM KCl. Poly (Ethylene Glycol) (MW 20,000 Da) was used as a depletion agent
at concentrations ranging between 20-35 mg/mL as indicated in the manuscript. An optical trap
(1064 nm) was time shared between multiple positions using Acousto-optic Deflector. One bead
was translated at a constant velocity while the force exerted on the other bead was measured
using back focal plane interferometry technique. Simultaneously, images of sliding F-actin
filaments were acquired using fluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse Te2000-u
microscope equipped with Andor iKon-M CCD. Sliding dynamics was visualized by confining a
two-filament bundle into a quasi-2D microscope chamber thus ensuring that filaments stay in
focus. The surfaces were coated with poly-acrylamide brush, which suppresses adsorption of
filaments. Bacterial flagella were isolated from Salmonella typhimurium strain SJW 605. The
flagellin protein of these bacteria has a mutation that causes flagellar filaments to assume a
straight shape. Microtubules were isolated following standard protocols.
