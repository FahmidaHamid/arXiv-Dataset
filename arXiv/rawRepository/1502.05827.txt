Abstract
As part of a project to develop predictive ecosystem models of United Kingdom woodlands
we have collated data from two United Kingdom woodlands - Wytham Woods and Alice Holt.
Here we present data from 582 individual trees of eight taxa in the form of summary
variables relating to the allometric relationships between trunk diameter, height, crown
height, crown radius and trunk radial growth rate to the tree’s light environment and
diameter at breast height. In addition the raw data files containing the variables from which
the summary data were obtained. Large sample sizes with longitudinal data spanning 22
years make these datasets useful for future studies concerned with the way trees change in
size and shape over their life-span.

Background & Summary
Prediction is a basic, possibly defining, feature of scientific disciplines 1. To develop ecological
models that are capable of being projected into the future, possibly into novel conditions
outside the parameter space within which the data were collected, process-based models
are required. Such process-based models are extremely demanding of data, as there are
often many interacting processes each requiring parameterisation 2,3. For long-lived species,
such as trees, parameterisation is especially demanding as most processes occur slowly, and
so require long-term datasets to ensure that robust estimates of the relevant rates can be
obtained 4. It is rare that datasets exist for the purposes of creating such models, and so
data, the collection of which was originally motivated by some other purpose, usually need
to be identified and processed in a manner that makes them suitable for inclusion in such
1

models. At present in ecology, prediction is attempted relatively rarely 5,6 and for example
the recent United Kingdom National Ecosystem Assessment struggled to find suitable models
or empirical examples on which to base its scenarios of likely future states of ecosystems 7.
We are developing predictive ecosystem models initially with the intention of providing
projections of the future state of United Kingdom woodlands. As our underlying
computational model we have implemented SORTIE – an established forest model 8. We
chose SORTIE over the many competing models because it is conceptually simple (based on
trees competing for one resource, i.e. light), it is based on ecological information that can be
parameterised from field data, it has been extensively and successfully used in North
America 8-11 and New Zealand 12-14, and it is individual-based, which allows for us to plan for
coupling between trophic levels more easily than if individuals were aggregated. In SORTIE,
trees compete for light by intercepting incident sunlight and modifying the light environment
beneath their crown. Sapling growth depends on their light environment while adult growth
depends on their size. For adult trees, traits (height, crown height and radius) vary with
diameter at breast height (DBH); while for saplings, traits vary with diameter at 10cm above
ground level. We have parameterised these functions by collating three datasets, and by
collecting data specifically for this project where they did not previously exist. Here we make
available these data and the summary variables for the eight commonest tree taxa (Table 1).
This information is most obviously of utility for those, who like ourselves, are planning to use
individual-based models of trees, and who may be interested in the allometry and growth of
the taxa included here (Table 1). However, allometric relationships such as these are
extremely important in understanding the biology of the species concerned 15,16 and so will
be of interest to those with more fundamental ecological interests. Similarly practitioners,
e.g. foresters, may find these data of use if they wish to understand how timber production
changes as trees grow. DBH has long been the measurement of choice among foresters – for
good reason as it is both straightforward to measure and interpret in terms of timber volume
17
. The data presented here allow estimation of other aspects of tree size and shape from
DBH.
Since 1992 the Environmental Change Network has measured DBH and height of focal trees
at two woodland sites – Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire) and Alice Holt (Surrey) using standard
protocols 18. The DBH of an additional set of trees was also measured in Wytham Woods in
2008 and 2010 (by two of us – Malhi and Butt). We have collated these data and combined
them into a single dataset, which we have supplemented with data on the crown height and
crown radius of the adult trees, diameter at 10 cm above ground level, and on the local light
environment of saplings. The workflow used to generate the output is shown in Fig. 1.

Methods
Study sites
Data were collected from two United Kingdom woodlands – Wytham Woods and Alice Holt.
Wytham Woods (51˚46’N, 1˚20’W, UK National Grid: SP 46 08) has been a research site
(owned and managed by Oxford University) since the 1940s. It is approximately 400 Ha in
extent, ranging in height from 60-165 m above sea level. The site has been extensively
managed, mainly by coppicing, although this has not been conducted since the early 20th
Century. There are regions of ancient woodland, secondary woodland and plantation; only
the plantation areas are still managed today. Alice Holt (51˚10’N, 0˚50’W, UK National Grid:
SU80 42) is in northern Hampshire and managed by the Forest Commission. The entire site is
about 850 Ha, the majority planted with Corsican pine (Pinus nigra), but 140 Ha of oldgrowth oak (Quercus robur) woodland remain, in which the data used here were collected.
The site varies in altitude from 70-125 m. These two sites are the two woodland sites in the
Environmental Change Network (ECN) in the United Kingdom.

Data collection
Three datasets have been collated here:






Environmental Change Network (Wytham Woods) (ECN-W), the ECN has monitored
a fixed set of sites in Wytham Woods since 1992. In this dataset we have data on 250
individual trees in 41 plots that have had DBH measured on seven occasions (1993,
1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012), and height measured three times (1993, 2002,
2012)
Environmental Change Network (Alice Holt) (ECN-AH), the ECN has monitored a fixed
set of sites in Alice Holt since 1994. In this dataset we have data on 216 individual
trees in 51 plots that have DBH measured seven times (1994, 1997, 2000, 2002,
2005, 2008, 2011). Height was measured on the same trees on three occasions
(1994, 2002, 2011). Another set of 56 trees on nine plots had DBH measured five
times (2004, 2005, 2007, 2012 and 2013), and height measured twice (2004 and
2012)
Oxford University plot (OXF), two of the authors (Malhi and Butt) have established
an 18 Ha plot containing about 20,000 individual trees, which have had DBH
measured on two occasions (2008 and 2010)

Since 2011 three of the authors (Evans, Moustakas and Carey) have supplemented these
three datasets by:






Measuring diameter at 10 cm above ground level on all saplings (defined here as
trees with DBH < 10cm) in ECN-W, ECH-AH, and a sample of 88 from OXF
Measuring the light environment around all saplings in ECN-W, ECH-AH and a sample
of 88 from OXF
Measuring the height of a sample of 88 saplings from OXF
Measuring crown radius and crown height for all adults in ECN-W and ECH-AH
Measuring canopy openness for a sample of 165 trees in Wytham Woods

It would have been desirable to have estimates of the age of trees in the datasets.
Unfortunately none of trees in datasets have been cored to determine tree age. In a
separate publication we have estimated tree mortality for the same taxa as are included
here using the ECN-W dataset through the application of a Cormack Jolly Seber model 19.
Measurement methods
Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)
DBH is a measurement that is routinely included in the datasets collated here. The three
datasets ECN-W, ECN-AH and OXF include a measurement of DBH which is taken following
standardised methods, by measuring trunk circumference using a tape to the nearest 0.1 cm
at 1.3 m above ground level 18. To ensure that DBH was measured at the same point on
subsequent surveys trees were marked with paint at the point at which DBH was measured.
Growth
Mean growth rates of individual trees were estimated by taking a series of DBH
measurements and subtracting the measurement at time point t from the measurement at
t+1 to calculate the change in DBH between the two time points and then to divide this value
by the number of years between the two time points. If for any tree there were more than
two measurements, the values were averaged to produce a single value per tree.
Height (H)
Tree height is measured in the two ECN datasets, and was measured by Evans and
Moustakas for a number of further trees, as described above. Height is measured by ECN
3

using a hypsometer to the nearest 0.5 m at Wytham Woods following 18, and using a laser
Vertex (Haglof Vertex III, Långsele, Sweden) to the nearest 0.1 m at Alice Holt. Height
measurements taken by Evans and Moustakas used a Laser Range Meter (Hilti PD40, Hilti,
Schaan, Liechtenstein) to the nearest 0.1 m. The use of three different devices to assess
height is likely to have increased measurement error in this parameter, at least if one was
concerned with differences between the sites at which measurements were taken. A good
test to determine the extent of this error would have been directly to compare measures of
tree height taken using the three different instruments, unfortunately this was not possible.
However, if a single measure of tree height is taken for each tree there are no significant
difference in the measurements taken by the different instruments, once taxon and stage
(adult or sapling) were taken into account (F = 5.43, N = 465, with eight taxa and 2 stages, P =
0.98).
Diameter 10 cm above ground level (D10)
D10 was measured for saplings in all three datasets: two measurements were made on each
sapling using vernier callipers to the nearest 0.1 cm. The two measurements were taken, as
far as practically possible, perpendicular to one other and averaged to produce one
measurement per tree. A tape was not used to measure D10 as vegetation and debris at the
base of the trees made inserting a tape round the tree against its trunk extremely difficult to
achieve in a consistent manner. As D10 was not a repeated measure the point at which it was
measured was not permanently marked as was DBH. The measurements were taken at a
point that was determined to be 10cm above ground level (using vernier callipers).
Crown radius (CRad)
CRad was measured for adults in the ECN-W and ECN-AH datasets by visually projecting the
crown margin onto the ground and measuring the two longest perpendicular diameters to
the nearest cm using a measuring tape. The two measurements were halved and averaged to
produce a single measurement per tree 14,20.
Crown height (CH)
CH was established for adults in the ECN-W and ECN-AH datasets by measuring the distance
from the ground to the point where foliage occupied at least three of the four quadrants
round the trunk 20, using a Laser Range Meter (Hilti PD40) to the nearest 0.1 m. These data
were combined with height data for the same trees to estimate crown height (the distance
between the top of the tree and the base of the crown), by subtracting the distance from the
base of the crown from tree height 14,20.
Light environment
Light meter readings were taken on cloudy days (so that light arriving at the trees was as
scattered as possible) during September 2012 for saplings in the ECN-W dataset, July-August
2013 for saplings in the ECN-AH dataset and September 2014 for a sample of 90 saplings in
the OXF dataset 13. We measured the percentage of incident light at the canopy reaching
each tree (Lc) by measuring the light intensity beneath the canopy at three positions within 1
m of the trunk of each tree at a height of 1.3 m (Lcait – the ith measurement of absolute light
levels below the canopy taken at time t, where i = 1-3), and simultaneously in a large open
gap nearby (Loat – the absolute light levels in the open at time t). To measure light levels we
used two PAR Quantum sensors (SKP215, Skye Instruments Ltd, Llandrindod Wells, United
Kingdom) that were both calibrated against the same reference lamp. The sensor used to
measure light levels under the canopy was used in conjunction with a meter (SKP 200, Skye
Instruments Ltd, Llandrindod Wells, United Kingdom) recording to one decimal place; the
one measuring light levels in the open was used with a datalogger (SDL5050 DataHog 2, Skye
Instruments Ltd, Llandrindod Wells, United Kingdom). Measurements from the sensor in the
4

open gap were made every 10 s with the mean of these more frequent values recorded
every 10 min. We calculated three light intensity values for each tree, which are the
proportion of the available light that reached each tree’s position (Lci, where i = 1-3):
𝐿𝑐𝑖 = 𝐿𝑐𝑎𝑖𝑡 /𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑡

(1)

Lc1, Lc2 and Lc3 for each tree were averaged to produce a single value (Lc) for each individual
tree.
Canopy openness
This light transmission coefficient is estimated using fish-eye-lens photographs taken under
canopies that are dominated by a single taxon. The fish-eye-lens photographs are taken at
1.35 m above the ground and orientated to magnetic North. The percentage of canopy
openness was analysed for individual circular sections of canopy using Gap Light Analyzer
software (http://www.ecostudies.org/gla/), following the method described in 20. The gap
light analyser software allows the crown of a tree to be identified in the photograph by the
operator and then estimates the percentage of canopy openness for circular sections of the
crown. The degree of canopy openness depends on the structure of the crown and the size
and shape of the leaves, this variable is used in SORTIE to filter out light hitting the canopy
and so modify the light environment below the tree. Differences in canopy openness and
canopy dimensions between taxa create a patchy light environment in the forest.
Summary Variables
We generated the taxon-specific summary statistics relating to the allometry and growth
equations required by SORTIE 8. These are:
Allometry
Taxon-specific allometric functions describe the tree’s size and shape.
Saplings (trees with DBH<10 cm)
To describe the allometry of saplings, two relationships are used – a linear one between D10
(trunk diameter at 10 cm above ground level) and DBH, and a power function between D 10
and height (H).
𝐷𝐵𝐻 = 𝑎 + 𝑏𝐷10

(2)

𝑏
𝐻 = 𝑎𝐷10
or log 𝐻 = log 𝑎 + 𝑏 log 𝐷10

(3)

Adults (trees with DBH>10 cm)
To adequately describe the size and shape of adult trees requires three allometric
relationships to be parameterised, power relationships between crown radius (CRad) and
DBH, crown height (CH) and tree height; and an exponential relationship between height and
DBH, with an asymptote at maxH.
𝐶𝑅𝑎𝑑 = 𝑎𝐷𝐵𝐻 𝑏 , or log 𝐶𝑅𝑎𝑑 = log 𝑎 + 𝑏 log 𝐷𝐵𝐻

(4)

𝐶𝐻 = 𝑎𝐻 𝑏 , or log 𝐶𝐻 = log 𝑎 + 𝑏 log 𝐻

(5)

𝐻 = 1.35 + (𝑚𝑎𝑥𝐻 − 1.35)(1 − 𝑒 −𝑏𝐷𝐵𝐻 )

(6)

Growth
Saplings
Radial growth is assumed to be described by a Michaelis-Menten function that relates
growth in DBH (Gsap, in cm yr-1) to light availability (L, expressed as a percentage of daylight),
combined with a power function of the effect of size. Michaelis-Menten functions are
specific forms of dose-response curves where the rate of a response variable depends on the
5

concentration of a substrate. Here sapling growth is the response variable and the intensity
of light is the substrate on which growth depends 13.




𝜙
𝐺𝑠𝑎𝑝 = (𝛼𝐿 ∕ (𝐿 + (𝛼 ∕ 𝛽))) 𝐷10
(7)
 is the asymptotic growth a high light levels, is the slope of the growth function at zero
𝜙
light. 𝐷10 is the size effect to determine the most appropriate value of we fitted models
with  = 0 - 1, and report the best fitting model (as determined by the lowest residual
standard error) which was  = 0.845 (which gave a residual standard error of 0.005 with 116
degrees of freedom).
Adults
Adult radial growth rate was assumed to be related to maximum radial growth rate that a
taxon can attain devalued by a size effect, so that in general trees grow more slowly as they
get larger.
𝐺𝑎𝑑𝑢𝑙𝑡 = 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐺 × 𝑆𝐸

(8)

The size effect SE is given by:

𝑆𝐸 = 𝑒 −0.5(ln(𝐷𝐵𝐻/𝑥0 )∕𝑥𝑏 )

(9)

x0 and xb are estimated parameters.
Data analysis
As both the dependent and the independent variables were subject to sampling error,
ranged major axis (RMA) model II regression 21 was used to analyse the relationships
between sapling D10 and height (equation 3), sapling D10 and DBH (equation 2), adult CRad
and DBH (equation 4), and adult CH and height (equation 5). We used the lmodel2 procedure
in the lmodel2 library 22 implemented in R 2.15.2 (Ref. 23). As we had longitudinal data on
both adult height and DBH (equation 6) we used repeated measures ANOVA with DBH as the
independent variable and height as the dependent variable and individual code as a random
effect to avoid pseudo-replication of trees that had been measured more than once. For this
analysis we used the lmer procedure in the lme4 library 24 in R 2.15.2 (Ref. 23). To analyse the
relationship between sapling growth rates and light (equation 7) we used the MM2
procedure in the drc library 25 of R to fit a two parameter Michaelis-Menten function to the
relationship between the growth rate and the light environment of individual saplings.
Equation 9 is a two-parameter (x0 and xb) negative exponential distribution. In order to
estimate x0 and xb inverse modelling was employed (identifying the parameters of a
distribution from data). Maximum likelihood estimation was used for fitting the two
parameters of the negative exponential distribution 26 using data on adult tree growth rates
in ECN-W and ECN-AH.

Data Records
The data contained in this data descriptor have been deposited in Datadryad
(http://dx.doi:10.5061/dryad.2c1s7). All data include codes to identify the individual trees:
for ECN-W these are derived by adding (tree number) to (plot number x 100); for ECH-AH
they are derived by adding (cell identity code) to (plot identity code x 100); for OXF all trees
have individual coded tags and these numbers were used as the identity codes. Individual
codes can be used to identify individual trees within a given dataset but may be replicated
between datasets. Our study is primarily concerned with allometric relationships of saplings
and adult trees. We also provide the original data needed to derive these data. The majority
of the DBH and height data are publicly available: All ECN data used here (DBH and height

Technical Validation
Once we had compiled data into the collated files, data entries were completed and verified
using a number of techniques:
1. Any missing data were checked by examining the original data files obtained from
ECN or Malhi and Butt and field notebooks
2. Taxonomic codes were standardised and checked by counting the frequency with
which each code appeared, examining any which were represented by few entries,
and correcting any typographical errors that were revealed
3. Maxima, minima, means and variances were calculated for all variables and outliers,
and checked against original data records
4. Each file was created from the original data twice separated by at least one month,
the sequence of data in at least one column per dataset was used as an index
variable, and the order obtained in the two datasets compared against each other.
Any discrepancies were checked against the original datasets
5. We have plotted the summary parameters in data record 7, to determine whether
the predicted relationships are reasonable and in accordance with the most
complete set of similar relationships found in 14. These can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3,
and will be updated along with data record 7 and new versions posted at
www.predictivecology.com.
