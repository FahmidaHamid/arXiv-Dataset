Abstract
We report that Müller cells contain bundles of long specialized intermediate filaments,
each about 10 nm in diameter; most likely, these filaments are the channels providing
light transmission to photoreceptor cells in mammalian and avian retinas. We interpret
transmission of light in such channels using the notions of quantum confinement,
describing energy transport in structures with electro-conductive walls and diameter
much smaller than the wavelength of the respective photons. Model calculations produce
photon transmission efficiency in such channels exceeding 0.8, in optimized geometry.
We infer that protein molecules make up the channels, proposing a qualitative
mechanism of light transmission by such structures.

-2Novel nanoscale devices, such as quantum wells (QW) and quantum dots (QD), created
new possibilities for development of microelectronics and microoptics. One of the
promising approaches is based on photonic crystals allowing the control of dispersion and
propagation of light [1,2]. The best-known effects include transmission or rejection of
light in a given wavelength range and waveguiding light along linear and bent defects in
a periodic photonic crystal structure. A surface plasmon is a transverse magneticpolarized optical surface wave that propagates along a metal-dielectric interface. Surface
plasmons exhibit a range of interesting and useful properties, such as energy asymptotes
in the dispersion curves, resonances, field enhancement and localization, high surface and
bulk sensitivities, and subwavelength confinement. Because of these attributes, surface
plasmons have found applications in a variety of areas such as spectroscopy,
nanophotonics, imaging, biosensing and circuitry [3-10]. Plasmon theory was extensively
used to interpret phenomena of light focusing at nanoscale [11–34]. Technical
applications of optical nano-devices have also been widely discussed [35-74], with
several examples of natural nanostructures for light harvesting, transmission and
reflection described in plants and bacteria (Vukusic, Sambles, 2003; Damjanovich et al.,
2002) [75,76].
Interestingly, light transmission in vertebrate retina is restricted to specialized glial cells,
which have many other physiological functions. Franze et al. in their pioneering studies
demonstrated that Müller glial cells function as optical fibers (Franze et al., 2007)[77].
They demonstrated that Müller cells transmit visible-range photons from the retinal
surface to the photoreceptor cells, located deep under the surface (Franze et al., 2007)
[77]. In fact, the retina is inverted and the light projected onto it has to pass through

-3several layers of randomly oriented cells with intrinsic scatterers, before it reaches the
light-detecting photoreceptor cells (Hammer et al., 1995, Vos, Bouman 1964) [78,79].
However, the guinea pig retina contains a regular pattern of Müller cells arranged mostly
in parallel to each other, spanning the entire thickness of the retina (500-800 m).
Müller cells main cylindrical processes (Schultze, 1866) [80], that span the retina
resemble “optical fibers” because of their capacity to transmit light [77]. These cells
typically have several complex side branches with functions not related to light
transmission, with different morphology (Schultze, 1866; Reichenbach et al., 1989) [80,
81]. Thus, main processes of Müller cells create a way for the light to go through the
retina. Here we suggest that main processes of these cells may contain specialized
molecular structures functioning like optical waveguides. Therefore, it is important to
investigate the morphology of Müller cells main processes and develop a theoretical
model of light transmission by such cells.
Numerous materials form dielectric-conductive waveguides, including carbon-based
materials with high carrier mobility and conductivity (West et al., 2010) [82]. Presently,
we shall interpret light transmission by Müller cells [77] based on the model of light
transmission by a waveguide with conductive nanolayer coating. Plasmon theory applies
to a dielectric waveguide with metal nanolayer coating [1-10]. This theory uses the
quantum electronics approach to analyze the electro-magnetic field (EMF) energy
transmission by such a waveguide. A plasmon is understood as a conduction-band
electron oscillation along the waveguide surface at the external EMF frequency [3-8,1621,53-69]. Such oscillations are induced by the EMF at the input end of the waveguide,
and then the plasmon energy is transformed back into the EMF at the output end of the

-4waveguide [3-8,16-21,53-69]. Presently, we shall focus our attention on the role of
quantum confinement (QC) in light transmission by Müller cells (MC) and nanotubes
with conductive coating, where QC operates in the direction normal to the coating. We
will analyze the EMF-induced transitions between the discrete states created in the
conductive coatings, and the excitation transport from the input end of the waveguide to
its output end. We shall demonstrate that excitation transport should operate
simultaneously with the state-to-state transitions, as the ground and excited-state
wavefunctions span the entire surface of the nanocoating. We shall extend this approach
to the analysis of light transmission by the MCs, proposing a mechanism of light
transmission by such cells.

Experimental Methods and Materials

The presently used histological material had been collected in Russia in 1999 during the
study of the bifoveal retina of pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The eyeballs of
flycatcher chicks 27 days after hatching were fixed in 3% gluteraldehyde with 2%
paraformaldehyde in 0.15 M cacodilate buffer and postfixed with 1% OsO4 in the same
buffer. The eyeballs were oriented relatively to the position of the pecten and embedded
into Epon-812 epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections 60 nm thick were made on a LKB Bromma
Ultratome ultramicrotome (L.K.B. Instruments Ltd, Northampton, UK) and examined on
JEM 100B (JEOL Ltd, Japan) electron microscope as it was described before (Khokhlova
et al., 2000)[83].

Experimental Results

Müller cells in a Pied flycatcher eye span from the vitreous body, where the light is
entering the retina, through the entire retina to the photoreceptor cone cells, and thus the
cell structure resembles the one previously described in a guinea pig eye (Franze et al.,
2007) [77]. The Müller cell’s bodies are located in a specific layer inside the retina,
sending principal processes to both of its surfaces. Indeed, the electronic micrograms
show that the MC endfeet (inverted cone-shaped zone of MCs adjusted to the vitreous
body, see Fig.1, red arrows) form the inner surface lining called the inner limiting
membrane (ILM), covering the entire inner surface of the retina. Basal processes of the
MCs originating from the endfeet (Fig. 1A, green arrows) protract away from the inner
surface, normally to it and essentially parallel to each other (Fig.1A, green arrows) while
the processes are spreading around branches of other cells. We suggest that similarly to
what had been found in guinea pig (Franze et al., 2007) [77], the light incident from the
vitreous body is entering the endfeet (Fig.1A, red arrows) and then the excitation energy
flows from the basal process to the cell body and then to the apical processes, where it is
transferred to the cone photoreceptor outer segment, as shown on the scheme in Fig.1 C,
The diameter of the Müller cell main process in Pied flycatcher may be less than 1
micron (Fig.1 A), therefore these cells working as waveguides should be described as
natural nano-optical structures.
<Insert Fig. 1>
We also studied the cytoplasm of Müller cells in the apical and basal processes, and have
discovered parallel structures that span the cell cytoplasm all the way through from the

-6inner membrane to the photoreceptors. A higher-magnification insert of a part of basal
process of a Müller cell (Fig.1 B) shows this structure within the cytoplasm going within
the cell process and repeating all of its curves. This structure resembles the bundle of
parallel intermediate filaments with the outer diameter about 10 nm, with some smaller
microparticles organized around the filaments. Intermediate filaments in glia cytoplasm
are most often associated with globular particles of chaperone proteins (usually termed
crystallines) (Perng et al., 2008) [84] that stabilize long filaments or with nucleoprotein
particles (Traub et al., 1998) [85]. These filaments span the most part of 400-500 μm of
the Müller cell length, from the endfoot to the photoreceptor (outer membrane), thus
resembling the previous observations in other species (Reichenbach, Bringmann, 2010)
[86]. The filamentary structure was absent in the Müller cell endfeet. Unfortunately, the
precise ultrastructure of this intermediate filament construction in MC and the continuity
of filaments that may be important for understanding the mechanism of their operation
could not be resolved on the equipment used, and will be investigated additionally.
Usually intermediate filaments have external diameter varying at 8-13 nm, each filament
usually built of 8 protofibrils (Steven, 1990) [87]. Specific intermediate filaments in lens
fiber cells are apparently responsible for the optical transparency of these cells
(Matsushima et al., 1997; Alizadeh et al., 2003) [88;89]. In our opinion, bundles of
intermediate filaments in Müller cells of Pied flycatcher eye should be the structures
responsible for transmission of light energy to the photoreceptor cells, and deserve
attention of quantum physics.

Theoretical Models

A. Quasi-classical Approach
We already mentioned numerous studies [1-74] that developed the theory of plasmonic
quantum electronics and its applications to dielectric-conductive waveguides. Figure 2
presents this model schematically, where only the E|| component of the electric field may
produce plasmons, exciting electronic oscillations polarized along the surface of the
waveguide.
<Insert Fig. 2>
The efficiency of energy transmission by a waveguide is significantly dependent on the
profile of its input zone [3-18,64-74]. Presently, however, we shall not discuss the
plasmonic theory in detail, focusing our attention on the more exact quantum approach.
B. Quantum Confinement
Analyzing tubes with nanometer-thick conductive walls, we must take into account the
quantum confinement (QC) [82,90,91], appropriate for light transmission by tubes with
the diameter smaller than the wavelength of light .
<Insert Fig. 3>
As we already mentioned, the parallel electric field component E|| contributes to
plasmonic excitations, while the normal component E  contributes to exciting the
discrete states created by QC in the tube nanowalls. Thus, we shall consider the
interaction of these field components with the respective quasicontinuum and discrete
electronic states, followed by the EMF emission at the other end of the waveguide. The
theoretic analysis of the QC in the device shown in Figure 1 is very complex. Therefore,
we simplified the system by considering a cylinder with the internal diameter r0, wall

-8thickness , and length l. The cylinder is linked to a cone, with the wall thickness

Cos(), height h, and aperture 2α. Still, the problem admits numerical solutions only,
with the results that we shall discuss next. We shall assume that the wavefunction
amplitude is continuous at the surfaces of contact of the cylinder with the two cones (see
Fig. 3). Thus, we shall analyze the excitation at the input cone, excitation transport via
the cylinder, and the emission at the output cone, for the sake of symmetry.
To evaluate these phenomena qualitatively, we need to determine the quantum states in
the cylindrical part using cylindrical coordinates, and the quantum states in the conical
part using conical coordinates. It is impossible to solve the Schrödinger equation
analytically in a conical system, which we shall therefore analyze approximately. We
shall also assume an increased excited state population density in the output conical piece
(the right side of the scheme) as compared to the input conical piece (the left side of the
scheme). Thus, energy transport in the model system reproduces phenomena occurring in
nature, where the excitation ends up on the chromophore molecules contained in the cone
photoreceptor cells, with the high excited-state density in the chromophores modelled by
that in the output conical piece.

1. Cylindrical Coordinated
We shall solve the eigenstate problem for conductive nanolayers, using the Schrödinger
equation in cylindrical coordinates:

-9We shall use boundary conditions equivalent to an axial potential box with infinite
potential walls, an acceptable approximation for qualitative analysis. Generally, one
presents the Schrödinger equation in cylindrical coordinates as:

where

 r,  , z    r,   z 

(3)

and m is the effective electron mass. Thus, we rewrite (1) as:



 2  2 r, 

Equation (7) may be studied numerically in order to obtain the values of k and hence the
energies of the eigenstates. There is also states quantization in the axial direction,
although with L much larger than the diameter their energy spectrum is a
quasicontinuum:

We introduce  i Ei  , the quantum state widths, determining the excited state relaxation
dynamics, including radiative decay. Note that the E|| component causes transitions
within the quasicontinuum, while the E  component causes transitions within the radial
discrete spectrum. Note also that the eigenvalues for the general wavefunction (6) are:

Enn '   kk ' r,  , z  Hˆ  kk ' r,  , z  .

(8’)

Generally, an eigenstate wavefunction involves the entire system; however, we may still
evaluate the time evolution of the excited state as described next [91]. To calculate the
probability of the excited state prepared in the initial moment of time, we calculate the
square of the absolute value of the probability amplitude:

Pexc t   Aexc t 

(13)

The phenomenological parameters  r E r ,exc  and  z E z ,exc  are respectively dependent
on E r ,exc and E z ,exc , while  r E r   0 and  z E z   0 for the ground state. We shall
discuss transverse (in the radial direction) and longitudinal (parallel to the cylinder axis)
excited states. Provided the longitudinal excited state is completely relaxed, the
probability to find the system in the transverse excited state is:

- 13 -

Pexc t   e

(14)

Conversely, if the transverse excited state is completely relaxed, the probability to find
the system in the longitudinal excited state is:

Pexc t   e

  z E z ,exc t

(15)

We conclude that the conductive nanolayer contains the excitation energy immediately
after the excitation, whereupon the excitation decays according to (13) – (15). To analyze
the energy transport, we shall next consider absorption and emission at the input and
output cones, respectively.

2. Qualitative analysis of processes at the input and output cones
Making use of the axial symmetry of the system, we shall use cylindrical coordinates.
Appendix II presents the secular equation (SE) and the respective boundary conditions. It
is only possible to solve the SE numerically, although we may obtain some qualitative
results even without solving it. Next, we present numerical results for light transmission
by the device of Fig. 1.

In the input cone (Fig. 2), the electric field component interacts with the internal conical
surface, exciting both longitudinal and transverse states. The energy absorbed upon
excitation is proportional to

Here, we assume that the level density of the ground state is constant, while that of the
excited state is dependent on ;  g r, , z ,  exc r, , z  are the wavefunctions of the

ground and excited states and re  re , , z  is the vector of the electron location in the
conductive nanolayer. The absorbed energy is then transferred to the cylindrical part, here
the probability of the excited-state wavefunction transmission ( - the transmission
coefficient) and reflection ( - the reflection coefficient) depends on the angle . The
transmitted energy has a maximum in function of , and therefore may be optimized.
Similarly, we may describe the energy transmission to the output cone. The excited states
in the output cone will emit with the same spectrum as that of the excitation, as the
relaxation of the excited states is quite slow, compared to the excitation transfer in our
model (Figure 3). Generally, the transmission and reflection coefficients are,
respectively:

We shall obtain the numerical solution of the SE in cylindrical coordinates, due to the
axial symmetry of the system. To describe the interaction with the EMF, we present the
linear momentum as follows:

Here, the first term in the Hamiltonian determines the motion of the electron in the

perturbation to the steady-state problem, describing mixing of the ground state with the
excited states. Using the perturbation theory, we first obtain the states in absence of a

Note that we substituted the sum over the k e values in (30) by integration. We used (30)
in numerical calculations of the energy transmission efficiency by the device, by the
mechanism that involves absorption of a photon at the input cone, and its emission at the
output cone. We shall address the spectral selectivity of the device in a follow-up
publication.

Numerical Calculations
We obtained numerical solutions of the equations (26) and (30) for EMF = 400 nm, and
different parameter values:  = 10 nm; r0 = 5, 10, 15, and 20; L1 = n1; L2 = n2;

We obtained the numerical solution of (26) using the finite differences method [92]. We
used homemade FORTRAN code for the numerical analysis of this equation combined
with the relationships (30) and (32), with Fig. 5 showing the numerical results.

The efficiency of the light transmission varies with the geometry, with the maximum
values corresponding to the following parameter sets: (1) R = 2.23 m, with the
maximum cone radius Rd,max = 0.29 m; (2) R = 2.94 m, Rd,max = 0.28 m ; (3) R = 3.64

m, Rd,max = 0.29 m; (4) R = 4.73 m, Rd,max = 0.31 m.

4. Mechanism of Light Transmission by MC
We found that MC cells contain internal longitudinal channels, with the diameter around
10 nm, of unknown nature. As a hypothesis enabling the usage of the above light
transmission mechanism, we shall assume that such channels have electrically conductive

- 22 walls. Such walls could be built, similarly to carbon nanotubes (CNTs), using conjugated
double bonds between carbon and other atoms (N, O, P and S), with carbon being the
predominant constituent. Alternative building blocks for the conductive walls that seem
more viable biologically are protein molecules, which have high electronic conductivity
even in dry state, with values approaching those typical for molecular conductors. These
high values of electrical conductivity apparently result from the existence of conjugated
bonds in their structure, enabling high electronic mobility [93]. However, in a simplified
qualitative approach, we shall now consider the electronic states in a CNT.

Electronic State Structure of a CNT
We shall start with a graphene monolayer, which has a conjugated -system, with the
energy gap between bonding and antibonding/conductive zones asymptotically vanishing
with increasing system size [94]. Local symmetry at each carbon atom is D3h, while the
symmetry of graphene elementary cell is D6h. Macroscopic symmetry of the graphene
sheet depends on its geometry. Presently, we shall analyze the effects of the local D3h
symmetry around a C atom. On each C atom, there are three hybridized atomic orbitals

, their contribution increasing when the radius is

reduced. The respective perturbation creates

between

and

antibonding/conductive zones, with the energy gap between these zones increasing for
smaller values of the CNT radius [96]. Similarly, the presence of O, S, N, P, and other
heteroatoms affects the energy gap. The interaction with EMF causes transitions to an
excited state, with the excited-state wavefunction distributed over the entire CNT, which
will facilitate energy transport between the input and the output cones. Now we have no
experimental evidence favoring this mechanism, which could explain the earlier recorded
light transmission by Müller cells [77]. However, the Müller cell structure we have
described earlier [see. Experimental results] is apparently compatible with the proposed
mechanism, with CNTs substituted by protein fibers.
In the following section, we present the results of model calculations with  = 0.5 nm,
providing a better approximation to the geometry of the optical channels in Müller cells
(see Sections II and III).

Numerical calculations for the device with  = 0.5 nm
We carried out modeling analysis for the following parameter values:  = 0.5 nm; r0 =
5, 10, 15, and 20; L1 = n1; L2 = n2; L3  

n1  n2
; R = n3, where n1, n2 and n3
2

- 24 are the size multipliers. Note that this time the size multiplies have larger numeric values,
so that the total lengths are similar: n1 =20000, n2 = 19960 and n3 = 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600, 700, 700, 800, 900, and 1000. Fig. 6 shows the numerical results. Here, all of
the parameters , r0, L1, n1, L2, n2, L3 , R, and n3 were defined above earlier.

<Insert Fig. 6>

Once more, the EMF transmission efficiency has a maximum for each of the parameter
sets, corresponding to the following values: (1) R = 95.7 nm, Rd,max = 3.0 nm; (2) R =
125.6 nm, Rd,max = 5.4 nm; (3) R = 155.5 nm, Rd,max = 7.8 nm; (4) R = 213.5 nm, Rd,max =
10.2 nm. As it follows from the results, the optimal radius of the input and output
sections (Rd,max) of the optical channels increases in comparison to the radius of the
cylindrical section, while the difference Rd,max – r0 decreases, with increasing r0. In effect,
we obtain

Rd , max
r0

 1 << 1, with the overall geometry very similar to that of a cylindrical

tube. However, the most notable result is the high efficiency of the EMF transmission by
such small-diameter channels, as obtained in the calculations.

Discussion

We analyzed in detail the role of QC in the transmission of electromagnetic energy by
axisymmetric nanochannels with conductive walls, with channel diameter much smaller
than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation. Note that the transmission of the
EMF by such structures may be described by the well-developed and frequently applied
plasmon - polariton theory [1-37]. The presently developed approach amounts to an

- 25 extension of the plasmon - polariton theory in the QC limit [31,73]. Indeed, we describe
the quantum states in a waveguide built of nanostructured conductive materials. We
assume that the interaction of the EMF with the waveguide produces a transition into the
quantum excited state that is delocalized over the entire device, in agreement with the
standard plasmon-polariton theory approach, where the energy of the EMF is transported
within the waveguide in the form of excited-state electrons [1-8,42-72]. However, there
are some terminological differences; here the excited state may be described as an
exciton, whereas the plasmon - polariton theory describes such excited states as plasmons
or polaritons. We presume that these are different designations for the same physical
phenomena, resulting from different qualitative descriptions of the behavior of the
system.
Presently we analyzed a waveguide device with the same geometry of the input and the
output sections. In principle, the energy transfer efficiency may depend on the geometry
of each of these sections, thus allowing extra opportunities to optimize it. The optimum
size should also depend on the wavelength of the EMF, with a possibility for separate
optimization for each of the color-vision photoreceptors. We shall explore these issues in
a follow-up publication.
Our main goal was to develop an understanding of the mechanisms of light conductivity
by Müller cells; next, we shall discuss the possible chemical composition of the
waveguide structures. Note that protein molecules are universal structural units in animal
cells. Apparently, appropriate proteins may form the conductive walls of the
nanostructured waveguides, as proteins have high electronic conductivity even in dry
state, with values approaching those of typical molecular conductors. These high values

- 26 of protein electrical conductivity probably result from the existence of conjugated bonds
in their structure, enabling high electronic mobility [94]. We were unable to find any
publications describing the molecular composition of the waveguide structures in Müller
cells, therefore these ideas will remain a hypothesis requiring future testing.

VI.

Conclusion

In the present study we report that Müller cells have long channels (waveguide
structures), around 10 nm in diameter, spanning the larger part of the cell process, from
the apex of the basal endfoot to the photoreceptor cells. Following the idea that such
channels act as waveguides, we developed a QC model of light transmission by
waveguides much thinner than the wavelength of the light quanta. We used our model for
qualitative analysis of light transmission by such waveguides, with the calculations
showing that such devices transmit light with high efficiencies from their input to the
output section, already in a device with a much-simplified geometry. The mechanism was
extended to light transmission by the waveguides (specialized intermediate filaments) in
Müller cells, concluding that they may be built of biopolymers with enough electric
conductivity for the mechanism to be operational, due to the presence of conjugated
multiple bonds in their structure.

we can separate radial and angular coordinates, provided the wavefunction may be

Taking into account the boundary conditions, we conclude that the wavefunction is only

- 37 The latter equation can not be solved directly, although it is apparent that the energy of
the system states is a discrete function in the radial direction.

To solve the equation

d 2 r  1 d r   2 2 

  k  2  r   0

(AI.22)

we have to present the radial function as follows:

 k r   r   k r 

(AI.23)

thus, our equation becomes:

we obtain

(AI.27)

which is equivalent to the equation obtained above. Since

 k 1 

(AI.28)

we may write



1 d 

(AI.29)

or taking into account the solution for  k 0 r    k 0 r  , we obtain

 k  

(AI.30)

- 39 Taking into account

we can finally write

where r and z coordinates may be separated from  using the wavefunction written as:

Since the variables r and z do not separate in Equation (AII.3), the problem may be
solved only numerically using the boundary conditions (AII.4).
