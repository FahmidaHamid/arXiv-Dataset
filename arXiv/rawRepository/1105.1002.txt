In living cells, molecular motors convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Its thermodynamic
energy efficiency, i.e. the ratio of output mechanical work to input chemical energy, is usually high.
However, using two-state models, we found the motion of molecular motors is loosely coupled to
the chemical cycle. Only part of the input energy can be converted into mechanical work. Others is
dissipated into environment during substeps without contributions to the macro scale unidirectional
movement.

Introduction. In biological cells, molecular motors
are individual protein molecules that are responsible for
many of the biophysical functions of the cellular movement and mechanics [1]. They work in nanometer range
and convert chemical energy, stored in ATP molecules,
into mechanical work. Important examples of molecular
motors are kinesin, dynein [2] and mysion [3, 4]. Recent
experimental data indicate that the energy efficiency of
molecular motors is high.
In literatures, there are many theoretical models to
study molecular motors, such as Fokker-Planck equation [5], Langevin equation [6], lattice model [7], network model [8] and etc. All of the existing models can
be roughly classified into two categories: (1) There is
only one chemical state, or equivalently only one tilted
periodic potential in the model. (2) There are multiple
chemical states, i.e. there are several periodic potentials
in the model. To some extents, any one model of the second class is equivalent to one of the first class [9]. Usually
the first class models are simple, and can be used to get
explicit formulations of important biophysical quantities,
such as the mean velocity [10, 11], effective diffusion coefficient [12] and mean first passage time [13]. However,
due to the oversimplification, more reasonable biophysical properties of molecular motors can not be obtained
from them. On the other hand, though the second class
models seem more reasonable, it is too difficult to obtain
explicit results [14, 15]. The simplest model of class two
is the two-state model, it has been frequently employed
by many authors [16–19]. But most of their results are
based on numerical calculations and then difficult to do
further analysis. In this research, we will give some explicit results of the two-state model, including the mean
velocity and energy efficiency. The main conclusion that
we draw from the two-state model is that, the motion of
molecular motors is loosely coupled to the chemical cycle, its mean velocity might be zero even if there exists
nonzero input energy, which is in accordance with the

recent studies [20–23].
One-state models. The motor motion can be modeled by the Langevin equation
p
(1)
ξ ẋ(t) = −∂x Φ(x) + 2kB T ξf (t),

where f (t) is Gaussian white noise, ξ is viscous friction
coefficient, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the absolute
temperature, and Φ(x) is a tilted periodic potential, i.e.
Φ(x)−Φ(x+L) ≡ ∆Φ is constant (the step size L = 8 for
conventional kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, and L = 36
for Myosin V). Or equivalently, it can be modeled by the
following Fokker-Planck equation
∂t ρ = ∂x (∂x Φρ/ξ + D∂x ρ) ,

(2)

where D = kB T /ξ is free diffusion coefficient, ρ(x, t) is
the probability density of finding the motor at time t and
position x. Using either (1) or (2), the steady state mean
velocity can be obtained as follows
V = RL

with β = 1/kB T . Obviously V > 0 if and only if ∆Φ >
0. If there exists external load Fext , the potential Φ(x)
should be replaced with φ(x) = Φ(x) − Fext x.
Another popular one-state model is the onedimensional hopping model: in which the motor in
mechanochemical state j can jump forward to state j + 1
with rate uj , or backward to state j − 1 with rate wj .
After moving N states forward or backward the motor
comes to the same chemical state but spatially shifted
by a step size L. Using this one-dimensional hopping
model, the mean velocity of the molecular motors is

FIG. 1: Schematic depiction of the two-state lattice models:
(Up) general case, (Down) special case, in which ωai = ωdi =
0 for i 6= M, N .

Obviously VN > 0 if and only if ∆µ > 0. Actually, it can
be proved mathematically that limN →∞ VN = V and
∆µ = ∆Φ (∆µ = ∆φ if there exists external force, see
[24]). By (3) or (4), the stall force of molecular motor can
be easily obtained Fs = ∆Φ/L, and the thermodynamic
energy efficiency is η = Fext L/∆Φ, which increases with
the external load Fext , and η(Fs ) = 1. Therefore, the
one-state models are tightly mechanochemical coupled
models. The maximum of energy efficiency is 1, which is
attained at stall force Fs .
Two-state models. The general two-state continuous model is the following mechanochemical coupled
Fokker-Planck equations:

∂t P =D∂x (βΦ′1 P + ∂x P ) + ωd (x)ρ − ωa (x)P
(5)
∂t ρ =D∂x (βΦ′2 ρ + ∂x ρ) − ωd (x)ρ + ωa (x)P,
with 0 ≤ x ≤ L. Where P (x, t) and ρ(x, t) are the probability densities of finding motor at time t, position x and
in states 1 and 2 respectively. ωd (x), ωa (x) are transition rates between the two chemical states at position x.
The corresponding general two-state lattice model is as
follows (see Fig. 1)

with n = 1, 2, · · · , N , Pn and ρn are probabilities in states 1 and 2 respectively. All the rates,

following, we will only discuss the two-state lattice model
(6), but all the corresponding results also can be obtained
by the two-state continuous model (5) [25].
Although the steady state solutions of the general twostate lattice model (6) can be obtained explicitly, it will
be certainly easier for us to show our conclusions only
by employing one special case, in which ωai = ωdi = 0

for i 6= M, N . For the simplicity of notations, we denote
ωaN , ωdN by Ωa , Ωd and ωaM , ωdM by ωa , ωd respectively
(see Fig. 1). To this special case, one can calculate that

One can show that ∆µ = 0 if and only if RN = rN = 1
and Jc = 0. RN = rN = 1 means the potentials in states
1 and 2 are all periodic and so no input energy in either
of the two states. Jc = 0 means there is no input energy
during transitions between the two states.
In the following, we assume that, under no external
load the potentials in each states are all periodic since,
biophysically the input energy to molecular motors comes
from ATP molecules, which is hydrolyzed during transitions between different chemical states. So, under no
external load, the mean velocity of the motor is
V = JL = (SN /TN − sN /tN ) Jc LPN /W,

(9)

and the input energy in unit time is
∆µ = kB T Jc PN [ln(ωa Ωd RM /Ωa ωd rM )] /W.

(10)

Obviously, ∆µ = 0 implies V = 0, but V = 0 does
not give ∆µ = 0. The reason is that there might exist
nonzero circumfluence of probability (see Fig. 3), i.e. the
motors might make a forward substep in one state but
stepping back in another one. In these processes, free
energy is consumed but no effective steps are made.
under nonzero external load Fext , the transition

satisfy

+[(rN − 1)U/tN + Jc (tN − sN )/tN ] ln rN
+ Jc ln[(ωa Ωd RM )/(Ωa ωd rM )]} PN /V.
(11)
It can be verified that the input energy ∆µ(Fext ) =
∆G(Fext ) + Fext V . In which ∆G(Fext ) ≥ 0, and
∆G(Fext ) = 0 if and only if Jc = 0. Therefore,
∆G(Fext ) ≥ 0 if and only if ∆µ(Fext ) = 0, which means
Fext V ≤ ∆µ(Fext ) and the equality holds if and only if
Fext V = ∆µ(Fext ) = 0.
The velocity-force relation can be obtained by formulation (7) with the stall force Fs is attained when J = 0.
It should be pointed out that, under stall force, V = 0
but the input energy ∆µ(Fext ) 6= 0 if Jc 6= 0, which
only depends on the parameters Ωa , ωd , ωa , Ωd . In fact,
Jc = [ωa Ωd RM (0) − Ωa ωd rM (0)] exp(−δβFext L) with
j
(j = 1, 2). Therefore, the motion of
δ = δ0j + · · · + δM−1
molecular motors is loosely coupled to the chemical cycle, this is consistent with the recent experimental results
[20–23].
The flashing rachet model can be regarded as one of
the special cases of the above models: in which one of
the potentials (for example, in state 2) is constant, i.e.
fi (0) = bi (0) ≡ f (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ). To this much special
case, corresponding results can be derived easily.
Limit properties and energy efficiency. To
some molecular motors, it might be possible to
change the transition rates Ωa , ωd , ωa , Ωd , which
usually depend on temperature, ATP concentration
and potential profiles.
For simplicity, we suppose
(Ωa , ωd , ωa , Ωd )=λ(Ω0a , ωd0 , ωa0 , Ω0d ) and λ is a parameter
that can be changed experimentally.
One can easily show that the mean velocity V → 0
with λ → 0. But for λ → ∞, the mean velocity tends to

energy ∆µ tends to kB T Ψ1 ln(κ1 RM /κ2 rM )/Ξ. So, the
output power of molecular motor has a limit which only

(j = 1, 2). Depending on the parameters Ωa , ωd , ωa , Ωd ,
the motor might move to the right direction (V > 0)
or to the left direction (V < 0). In our discussion, we
always assume that the direction of the external load is
opposite to the motor motion direction, i.e. the external
load points to the left (Fext > 0) if V > 0 and points to
the right (Fext < 0) if V < 0. This assumption means
Fext V ≥ 0.

motor is its energy efficiency. By (7) (10), its thermodynamic energy efficiency η(Fext ) := F V /∆µ is

Obviously, η(0) = η(Fs ) = 0.
From the loose
mechanochemical coupling discussion in the above section, we can easily know η < 1. With Fext increases from
zero to Fs , the mean velocity decreases to zero monotonically. But for the efficiency η, there exists a maximum
value between 0 and Fs (see Fig. 2).
Discussions. The analysis of two-state models indicates the motor motion is loosely coupled to the chemical
cycle. The biophysical reason of this loose mechanochemical coupling is there exist forward and backward substeps, which had been found experimentally in [26, 27].
Free energy is consumed in each substeps, but only part
of them really contributes to the effective unidirectional

motion. In the two-state models, this corresponds to the
existence of probability circumfluence. Due to the temporal symmetry of states 1 and 2, there are altogether 9
different cases of the probability flux (see Fig. 3). Free
energy is consumed but without effective forward motion
in each circumfluence. To the general two-state lattice
models, there exist much more cases of the probability
circumfluence.
Using special cases of the two-state continuous
models (5), the same conclusion can be obtained. For

But the input energy is always positive. Therefore, the
fact of loose mechanochemical coupling also can be found
from this continuous models. As an example, the motion
of motor protein kinesin can be schematically described
by the special case of our two-state model (see Fig. 4).
In which the transition from state 1 to state 2 is due
to the neck linker docking of the microtubule bounded
head (leading head), the transition from state 2 to state
1 is due to ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release. Due
to the existence of substeps, which might have no any
contributions to the macroscopic unidirectional motion
of kinesin, the energy efficiency of kinesin is certainly
smaller than 1.
