ABSTRACT

January 5, 2015

This study surveyed ergonomic issues in 308 Native American flute players. It
also correlated the physical measurements of a subgroup of 33 participants with
the largest flute they found comfortable. The data was used to derive a predictive
formula for the largest comfortable flute based on physical measurements. The
median age of players was 63 years with a mean of 6.9 years playing Native
American flute. Females reported significantly less time playing the instrument (p
= .004), but significantly faster self-reported progress rates (p = .001). Physical
discomfort was experienced by 47–64% of players at least some of the time. Over
10% of players reported moderate discomfort on an average basis. Females report
significantly higher maximum and average physical discomfort than males (p <
.001 and p = .015, respectively). Height, arm span, hand span, and reported length
of time playing and experience level all correlated with the largest flute that the
player found comfortable. Multivariate coefficient analysis on those factors
yielded a formula with a strong correlation to the largest comfortable flute (r =
+.650). However, the formula does not have sufficient correlation to have value in
predicting flute design. Customization of Native American flutes with the goal of
improving ergonomics is proposed as a worthwhile goal.

Introduction
The ergonomic issues particular to playing musical
instruments have been widely studied. However, most
research studies have focused on orchestral instruments and
trained, experienced musicians (for example, [Lonsdale
2014] for Western concert flute, [Furuya 2006] and [BoyleRB 2010] for piano, and [Wade-MA 2008] for trumpet). The
bulk of the assistance and advice published for musicians and
music teachers is similarly focused on experienced musicians
and orchestral instruments (for example, [Norris 1993],
[Horvath 2010], [Guptill 2010], and [Musikerhalsan 2014]).
This exploratory pilot study focuses on the ergonomics of
playing the Native American flute, an ethnic wind instrument
with roots in indigenous North American cultures. In contrast
with orchestral instruments, the designs of Native American
flutes are highly variable, with a very wide range of pitches,
tunings, fingerings, temperament, and playing characteristics.
The community of players of the instrument has relatively
less training and experience than orchestral instrument

players, and the focus of music education tends to be on
improvisation and self-expression rather than precise
renditions of written music. These differences have
contributed to the recent popularity of the Native American
flute in community music settings.
Because of the relative freedom in design and
construction of the instrument, there is an opportunity to shift
the focus for ergonomically comfortable instruments from
the player (eg. exercises to increase reach and hand
flexibility) to the maker of the instrument, even to the point
of allowing individually customized instruments for a given
player.
The first goal of this study was to survey the
characteristics of players of Native American flutes,
especially those related to ergonomic issues, the prevalence
of discomfort, and the relationships to specific medical
conditions. The second goal was to investigate the feasibility
of using a system based on body measurements (in
particular, a systems amenable to self-measurement by the

would find comfortable.
This paper also provides
incidental statistics of a more
general nature regarding the
characteristics of the Native
American flute players who
participated in this study.

longer sound chamber.
The Native American flute is classified in the same
family as the recorder.1 It uses a duct or flue to direct the
player’s airstream, allowing the instrument to be played
without the need for players to learn to form an embouchure
with their lips. It is distinguished from the recorder by the
inclusion of a slow air chamber which precedes the flue,
providing an air reservoir that acts as a modest pressure
bladder, tending to smooth out changes in breath
pressure. Another distinguishing characteristic is its
limited pitch range – typically no more than 1.3
octaves from the lowest note on the instrument.

For those lower-pitched instruments, the best location of
finger holes from an acoustic perspective would cause
prohibitively large spread in the fingers of each hand, so
compromises between ergonomics and acoustics are often
made by the flute maker.

Compared with other woodwind instruments, the
sound chamber of most Native American flutes has
a larger diameter relative to its length. This allows
the instrument to maintain a full sound through a
relatively large range of breath pressures without
jumping registers (Brent Haines, personal
communication, September 12, 2014).
Figure 1 shows the typical elements used in the
design of a Native American flute. Since there are
no common design standards, contemporary
instrument makers take far more freedom in their
designs than makers of orchestral wind instruments.

Methods
A convenience sample of 308 participants was recruited
from two sources, comprising two subgroups in the
subsequent analysis:
 On-line subgroup: (n = 275) Members of on-line
social network groups related to playing Native
American flutes were recruited to complete an on-line
questionnaire.
 In-person subgroup: (n = 33) Participants of a
weeklong Native American flute workshop were
recruited to:
 complete a paper questionnaire,
 get photographed for measurement purposes, and
 play flutes of various sizes to locate flutes that were
the “largest comfortable” and “slightly larger than
comfortable” (i.e. “slightly uncomfortable”) and
complete a questionnaire on the specifics of comfort
issues playing those flutes.
All participants signed or otherwise affirmed via an online form participation in the study and receipt of an
informed consent. No coaching or recommendations
regarding ergonomics were provided to participants prior to
completion of their participation in the study.
Questionnaire
The information gathered in the
paper questionnaire and the on-line
questionnaire was substantially the
same. Completed questionnaires were
visually inspected to remove accidental
and duplicate submissions. One
participant indicating transitional
gender was retained, but eliminated
from all analysis dealing with gender.

participants juxtaposed against a measuring scale and
determining various physical dimensions from those
photographs at a later time. These additional measurements
comprised:
 Arm span between the tips of the longest fingers,
measured against a wall, with outstretched arms raised
parallel to the ground at shoulder height;
 Left and right forearm length, measured from the tip
of the longest finger to a solid block against which the
elbow and upper arm were placed; and
 Hand measurements, taken from photographs of each
hand pressed firmly against a printed scale developed
for this study (Figures 7 and 8 in the appendix).
The system of measurement based on photographs was
used so that additional measurements could be obtained
retrospectively as needed. All hand measurements were
obtained by measuring the physical distance between two
points on the photograph as it was displayed on a flat-screen
LCD display with a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio (Figure 4). The
physical distance measured on the display was scaled by a

questionnaire is shown in Figure 6 in

Body Measurement
Overall body height was gathered
from all participants by self-report on
the questionnaire.

 I–R: Index finger to ring finger, measured between the

Flute Measurements
This study provided an array of various sized flutes for
the in-person group to play, in order to find the “largest
comfortable flute”. Three measurements were taken on each
of those flutes (see Figure 5):
 Head-to-LowestFingerHole: The distance from the
extreme head end of the flute to the center of the finger
hole closest to the foot end of the flute.
 F1–F3: The maximum distance between the centers of
the finger holes typically used by the hand closest to
the head end of the flute.
 F4–F6: The maximum distance between the centers of
the finger holes typically used by the hand closest to
the foot end of the flute.
The metric MaxIntraHandSpread – the maximum
distance that the fingers on either hand were required to span
– was set to: max(F1–F3, F4–F6).
For measurements that terminate at the center of a finger
hole, two measurements were averaged: a measurement to
the furthest edge of the finger hole and a measurement to the
nearest edge of the finger hole.
Largest Comfortable Flute
Participants in the in-person subgroup worked with the
range of flutes that had been measured. Some participants
found even the largest flutes to be well within their comfort
range. However, 24 participants were able to locate flutes
that were right at their limit of comfort, and completed a
survey regarding that flute (Figure 9 in the appendix).

Results
Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel 2010.
All Student’s t-tests assume two-tailed distribution and two
heteroscedastic samples of unequal variance. Data analysis
examined a wide range of measures and possible outcomes.
Because multiple statistical inferences were considered
simultaneously, the statistical measures presented in this
study should be considered exploratory.
On-line vs. In-person subgroups
To identify potential differences between questionnaire
responses from the on-line subgroup and questionnaire
responses from the in-person subgroup, pairwise t-tests
across all questionnaire responses were performed. To
eliminate inherent gender differences, separate male and
female pairwise t-tests were performed for reported height,
arthritis, and osteoporosis. These pairwise t-tests did not
identify any significant differences between the on-line and
in-person subgroups (p > .200 in all cases).
Age and Height
Reported age ranged from 17 to 87 years with a mean of
61.97 ± 10.03 years and a median of 63 years. 300 of the 308
participants reported an age of 38 years or older. Males
reported significantly higher age than females: 62.81 vs.
60.44 (p = .044).
Mean reported height was 64.14″ ± 2.80″ for females and
70.21″ ± 2.92″ for males.

Time Playing and Experience
Reported time playing all wind instruments ranged from 0
to 65 years with a mean of 14.30 years.
Reported time playing Native American flute ranged from
0 to 42 years with a mean of 6.92 years. 182 participants
(59.2%) reported the same time for all wind instruments and
the Native American flute, implying that the Native
American flute was their first or only wind instrument.
The breakdown of participants by reported experience
level – Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, or Advanced – is
shown below in Table 1. Reported experience level has only
a moderate positive correlation with reported time playing
Native American flutes (r = +.460) and a weak positive
correlation with reported time playing all wind instruments
(r = +.360).
Males reported significantly more time playing Native
American flute than females: 7.57 vs. 5.72 years,
respectively (p = .004). However, there was no significant
gender-based difference in reported experience level.
To analyze this relationship further, a composite metric
called “progress rate” was developed. Progress rate is a
numeric version of experience level (Beginner = 0, Novice =
100, Intermediate = 200, Advanced = 300) divided by the
number of months playing Native American flute.
Females reported a significantly higher progress rate than
males: 4.61 vs. 2.91, respectively (p = .001).
Health Conditions
Some level of arthritis was reported by 176 participants
(57.5%), with 120 reporting “mild”, 45 reporting
“moderate”, and 11 reporting “severe” arthritis.
Osteoporosis was reported by 45 participants (14.9%), of
which 33 were female, resulting in a very significant
correlation between gender and osteoporosis (p < .001). The
degree of osteoporosis was reported as “mild” by 34
participants, “moderate” by 10 participants, and “severe” by
2 participants (who were both male).
Gout was reported by 21 participants (6.8%), with 15
reporting “mild” and 6 reporting “moderate” gout.
Reported maximum physical discomfort ranged as high as
10 on the modified NPRS scale and averaged 2.30 across all
participants. Average physical discomfort ranged up to 8
with an average of 1.06. Some physical discomfort was
reported on an average basis by 144 participants (46.7%),
with 27 participants reporting average physical discomfort in
the moderate range and 3 in the severe range.
Physical discomfort was reported at least some
percentage of the time by 198 participants (64.3%), with 32
participants reporting physical discomfort at least 50% of the

5

time and 5 reporting physical discomfort 100% of the time.
Reports of maximum and average levels of physical
discomfort, and percentage of time experiencing physical
discomfort all showed a moderate positive correlation with
the degree of arthritis (r = +.423 for average level of physical
discomfort).
Females reported significantly higher maximum physical
discomfort on the NPRS scale (3.03 vs. 1.90, p < .001) and
average physical discomfort (1.36 vs. 0.89, p = .015).
Beginners and novices, as a subgroup, reported higher
average physical discomfort than the subgroup of
intermediate and advanced players (1.29 vs. 0.91), a result
that approached significance (p = .053).
Physical Measurements
Based on measurements of the in-person subgroup,
measured arm span showed a very strong positive correlation
with reported height (r = +.938). The average ratio of
measured arm span to reported height was 98.34%.2
The correlation between reported height and measured
left and right forearm length were somewhat less strong (r =
+.854 and r = +.870, respectively). Left and right T–P
measurement correlations with reported height were weaker
(r = +.633 and r = +.634, respectively), as were left and right
I–R measurements (r = +.467 and r = +.465, respectively).
The in-person subgroup was divided into “longer-time
players” (participants with 5 years or more time playing
Native American flutes – the median for the in-person
subgroup) and “shorter-time players” (less than 5 years of
time playing Native American flutes).
Longer-time players had significantly higher T–P
(thumb–pinky) measurements than shorter-time players (p =
.007 for the left hand and p = .009 for the right hand). That
relationship persisted when the T–P were scaled by reported
height (p = .020 for the left hand and p = .026 for the right
hand).
The longer/shorter-time distinction was not a significant
predictor of I–R (index–ring fingers) measurement of the left
hand, either in absolute terms or as a percentage of reported
height (p = .302 and p = .626, respectively). However,
longer-time players did have significantly higher I–R
absolute measurements for the right hand (p = .049, and p =
.100 for I–R measurements scaled to reported height).

Largest Comfortable Flute
The metrics of Head-to-LowestFingerHole (H-LFH) and
MaxIntraHandSpread (IHSmax) of the largest comfortable
flute was moderately positively correlated with reported
height (r = +.470 and r = +.413, respectively). H-LFH and
IHSmax also showed a moderate positive correlation to time
playing Native American flutes (r = +.474 and r = +.509,
respectively) as well as reported experience level (r = +.539
for H-LFL and r = +.593 for IHSmax).
H-LFH and IHSmax showed various moderate positive
correlations with measured arm span, forearm lengths, and
various hand span measurements, but none were notably
stronger than the correlation of H-LFH and IHSmax with
reported height.
Arthritis showed virtually no correlation with H-LFH (r =
+.005) and IHSmax (r = +.006). Osteoporosis showed
similarly very weak correlations (r = –.046 for H-LFH and r
= +.021 for IHSmax) as did gout (r = +.169 for H-LFH and r
= +.086 for IHSmax).
Coefficient Analysis
Multivariate coefficient analysis was used to explore the
possibility of deriving a single formula that could reliably
predict the H-LFH and IHSmax based on the parameters
quantified by this study. Three coefficients were applied to
the three parameters with the highest correlation to H-LFH
and IHSmax: reported height, time playing Native American
flutes, and reported experience level.
The tuple of three coefficients that maximized the
correlation with H-LFH and (independently) IHSmax were
then determined. The analysis yielded strong correlations of
r = +.650 for H-LFH and r = +.662 for IHSmax.
The results of this formula were then compared with the
H-LFH and IHSmax reported by the participants of this
study. Although the formula shows strong correlations to
with H-LFH and IHSmax, the formula produced errors as
high as 5.95″ for H-LFH, demonstrating that it is not useful
as a predictive tool.

Discussion
Age and Height
The study participants reported themselves to be
substantially older than the general American population:
median age 63 years vs. 37.5 years [Census 2013], with a
mean reported age of 61.97 ± 10.03 years and the
predominance of participants (300 of 308) who reported
themselves to be older than the median American age. While
no authoritative references as to the age of musicians could

6

be located, it appears likely that the age profile of Native
American flute players is substantially different than the age
profile for players of orchestral instruments.
The mean reported height was taller than the average
measured height for U.S. adults over 19 years of age as
reported in [McDowell 2008] for both females (64.14″ vs.
63.86″) and males (70.21″ vs. 69.41″). One explanation is the
that self-reports of height are significantly greater than
measured heights – [Danubio 2008] reported a difference of
2.8 cm (1.10″) for females and 2.1 cm (0.83″) for males,
which exceed the differences found in this study in both
males and females.
Physical Discomfort
Participants reported average physical discomfort at the
low end of the mild range with maximum physical
discomfort averaging above the midpoint of the mild range
and some participants reporting average physical discomfort
in the severe range. By various metrics, 47–64% of players
experience physical discomfort at least some of the time,
with over 10% reporting at least moderate discomfort on an
average basis.
Putting these reports of physical discomfort in context is
difficult, given the lack of published data for comparable
situations. [Culf 1998] (according to [Mitchell-T 2007])
reported that 64–76% of symphony orchestra musicians
surveyed experienced repetitive strain injuries that affected
their performance, but this provides only a very weak
comparison due to dramatically different populations and
conditions.
The significant bias toward higher physical discomfort
reported by females vs. males may also be significant in light
of the significant less time reported by females vs. males for
playing Native American flutes. One explanation is that the
higher level of physical discomfort increases the “drop-out
rate” playing the instrument.
Physical Measurements
While physical measurements of arm span correlated
closely with reported height, the physical measurements of
hand span from the thumb to the pinky for both hands
showed a strong relationship to their time playing Native
American flutes. Taken by itself, this relationship could
indicate that time playing Native American flute causes a
wider hand span, or it could indicate that players with a
wider hand span (either in absolute terms or in relationship to
their height) are more apt to continue playing the instrument.
However, when we consider that:
 the corresponding relationship between the index and
ring fingers (significantly greater spread for in-person

Goss

Native American Flutes Ergonomics
participants with five or more years of playing Native
American flutes) holds for only the right hand and not
the left hand, and that

 the right hand is typically the hand used on the finger
holes closer to the foot of the flute and that those holes
tend to be further apart,
it follows that playing Native American flute increases
the ability to stretch the hand.
The methods used in this study to measure hand span
were chosen so that a flute player could photograph their
own hands against a common grid and flute makers could
then reliably evaluate hand span from those photographs.
However, while this approach produced useful comparative
measurement within the in-person subgroup of participants,
those hand measurements may not relate to the hand span
used by the player on the cylindrical body of the flute.

7

 Participants in the in-person subgroup had a relatively
short time playing the range of flutes available to
determine the largest comfortable flute. It may be that
the discomfort experienced by a player on a given flute
changes over days or weeks as experience is gained
playing that flute.
A number of difficulties were noted during the process of
measuring the hands, and can provide insight to future
studies using a similar strategy for measuring physical
characteristics:
 The direction given to participants to “fully spread your
hand” resulted in various degrees of effort in
stretching. The effort was not necessarily associated
with the amount of stretch used while playing.

Primary Questions Investigated in this Study
In light of the results of this study, no clear relationship
was found between a physical metric and the layout of finger
holes on the largest comfortable flute. It may be that the
limits of comfortable finger hole layout correlate with
physical parameters not quantified by this study, or that there
are other non-quantitative attributes of flute players that
affect comfort.

 Photographic parallax is an issue, since the
measurement point was above the surface of the graph
paper – closer to the camera. This would tend to
decrease the measurement of the underlying scale on
the graph paper relative to the quantity measured and
make all measurements higher than the actual
distances. This issue was further compounded by the
lack of a standard height for the camera. Future studies
could establish a standard height and make it at a
substantial distance from the hand and graph paper to
reduce the impact of photographic parallax.

This result was discussed with several experienced
makers of Native American flutes, who concurred with this
finding based on their own experience.3

 The presence of fingernails of various lengths created
some ambiguity in the correct endpoint for
measurements.

Limitations
Some general limitations in the design and execution of
this study include:
 The small number of participants in the in-person
subgroup (n = 33) may have limited the significance of
some the results and caused type II errors in statistical
testing of the hypotheses of this study.
 The use of a convenience sample rather than statistical
sampling may have skewed some results. The
participants may not have been a representative sample
of the population of Native American flute players.
 Only flutes with finger holes positioned along the
centerline of the instrument were used. Some Native
American flutes, especially lower-pitched instruments,
have finger holes offset from the centerline to improve
comfort and reachability.
3

One experienced flute maker, Brent Haines, commented that his
experience is that the size of flute that can be comfortably accommodated
is related more to the enthusiasm of the player than to physical
measurements.

 The presence of shadows made it difficult to precisely
locate the measurement endpoints in a few cases.
 Some participants rotated various fingers during the
measurement process, creating a lack of uniformity
across participants in the measurement process.
 In one case, the hand and paper were placed on a soft
surface rather than on a hard table top, creating a slight
undulation in the paper as the hand was pressed down.
Other limitations include:
 The use of self-reported rather than measured height
may have affected the results.
 The self-reporting of experience level is particularly
suspect. Some relatively objective evaluation of
playing level may be preferable.
 The different formats for the questionnaires completed
by the on-line subgroup and the in-person subgroup
(on-line Web form vs. paper form) could have affected
results, even though none were detected by the set of
pairwise t-tests.

Native American Flutes Ergonomics
Conclusions

This study was motivated by a lack of research in the area
of ergonomic issues in the community of Native American
flute players and the need for a straightforward system based
on physical measurements whereby flute makers could
construct custom flutes that would be unlikely to cause
physical discomfort.
The community of Native American players is
dramatically different from that of orchestral wind
instrument players. Players of orchestral instruments report
of a range of repetitive strain injuries and playing-related
musculoskeletal disorders, and a surprisingly high percentage
of musicians report playing in physical discomfort on an
ongoing basis. Orchestral instruments are relatively fixed in
design and effort is often placed on small modifications to
accommodate ergonomic issues without changing the
acoustic or mechanical properties of the instrument (e.g.
[Storm 2006]).

8

An informal survey of the marketing literature of flute
makers shows many who emphasize the woods used, the
precision of tuning, the tonal quality, and the spiritual aspects
associated with the traditional roots of the instrument. Few
mention the opportunity for an instrument (customized or
otherwise) that addresses playing comfort.
With regard to the goal of finding a system to assist flute
makers in creating such instruments based solely on physical
measurements, this study did not produce definitive results.
It may be that the process of designing an instrument that
will be comfortable for a player requires in-person
examination and consultation by a person experienced in
flute design and/or issues of ergonomics.
It appears that a greater focus on the design of
instruments that address ergonomic issues would benefit the
community of Native American flute players.

‘friendly’; rather, they are designed to achieve the
best fit with a highly skilled human physiology”
([Bernardini 2010])
In contrast, the community of Native American flute players
has:
 A relatively older population focused on music for
personal enjoyment and self-actualization;
 A focus on community music making rather than
performance;
 A culture of improvisation rather than playing written
music;
 Instruments that are relatively free in design;
 A large population of Native American flute instrument
makers, many of whom are ideally set up to craft
custom-designed instruments that could maximize
comfort.
In what seems like an ideal situation for minimizing
physical discomfort, this study has found that many players
still experience substantial physical discomfort. This may be
due to the expectation (as with orchestral musicians) that
physical discomfort is “normal” when playing any musical
instrument.
This study also established a link between the level of
physical discomfort and shorter time playing the instrument,
and provided evidence that physical discomfort may cause an
increase in the “drop-out” rate of players.
