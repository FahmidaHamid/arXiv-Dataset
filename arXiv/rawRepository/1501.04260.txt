Abstract— In this paper we study disease spread over a
randomly switched network, which is modeled by a stochastic switched differential equation based on the so called
N-intertwined model for disease spread over static networks.
Assuming that all the edges of the network are independently
switched, we present sufficient conditions for the convergence
of infection probability to zero. Though the stability theory
for switched linear systems can naively derive a necessary and
sufficient condition for the convergence, the condition cannot
be used for large-scale networks because, for a network with
n agents, it requires computing the maximum real eigenvalue
of a matrix of size exponential in n. On the other hand, our
conditions that are based also on the spectral theory of random
matrices can be checked by computing the maximum real
eigenvalue of a matrix of size exactly n.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Network epidemiology, a branch of mathematical epidemiology which aims to mathematically understand disease spread over networks, has been attracting ever-growing
attention [1]. One of the reasons comes from the finding
that the heterogeneous structure of real world networks,
such as an uneven distribution of the number of neighbors
of individuals, cannot be ignored to perform an accurate
prediction of epidemics [2]. Another reason comes from
recent advancements of the technologies for collecting a
massive amount of data from real human interactions, which
enable researchers to build accurate mathematical models of
human networks (see [3] and references therein). One of the
recent achievements of network epidemiology, for example,
is the effective prediction of the pandemic of H1N1 influenza
on 2009 [4].
In the last decade, the major emphasis of network epidemiology has been on the disease spread over static networks [1].
This time-invariance assumption enables us to model disease
spread as a time-homogeneous Markov process, for which an
effective approximation by a constant-coefficient differential
equation, called an N-intertwined model, is available [2],
[5]. For example it is known [2], [5] that the evolution of a
certain epidemic model over a static network is characterized
by only the maximum real part of the eigenvalues of the
adjacency matrix of the network.
However, recently, several simulation studies have reported that the dynamical nature of human interactions can
greatly affect the way epidemics evolve and that static
approximations of such dynamical networks may result in

inaccurate conclusions [6]. For example, Vazquez et al. [7]
observe that the speed of disease spread can be substantially
slowed down on randomly switched networks than on static
ones. The result by Volz and Meyers [8] suggests that the
frequency of the change of the topology of network structure
is an important factor for the emergence of endemic. In
[9], it is numerically confirmed that so-called memory effect
of networks can slow down disease spread. Despite those
simulation results, rigorous understanding of disease spread
over dynamical networks based on mathematical analysis is
very limited.
This paper gives an analysis of disease spread over
randomly switched networks with the stability theory for
switched linear systems called Markov jump linear systems [10] and the spectral theory of random graphs (see,
e.g., [11]). We provide sufficient conditions for epidemics
to eventually die out over randomly switched networks
having independent and Markovian edges. This paper can
be considered as a stochastic counter-part of the recently
submitted paper [12], where the authors study epidemics over
deterministically switched networks.
One of the major difficulties of the problem is in the
computational cost. The stability theory for Markov jump
linear systems in fact gives a necessary and sufficient condition for epidemics eventually dying out as we will see
later (Proposition 3.1). Unfortunately, checking the condition
requires finding the maximum real eigenvalue of a matrix
with size 2n(n−1)/2, where n denotes the number of the agents
in a network. On the other hand, the size of the matrix
appearing in the proposed conditions is equal to n, which
allows us to apply the conditions for large-scale networks.
This paper is organized as follows. After giving the
notation used in this paper, in Section II we give the model
of disease spread over randomly switched networks. Then
Section III gives sufficient conditions for epidemics dying out
over randomly switched networks having independent edges.
Examples are presented in Section IV. Finally in Section V
we extend the obtained results to the case when networks
are modeled by weighted graphs.
A. Mathematical Preliminaries
We let In denote the n × n identity matrix. The subscript n
will be omitted when it is obvious from the context. A real
vector v is said to be nonnegative, written v ≥ 0, if it has only
nonnegative entries. By 1n and 1n,m we denote the n-vector
and the n × m matrix whose entries are all one. A square
matrix is said to be Metzler if its off-diagonal entries are
nonnegative. We denote the Kronecker product of matrices A
and B by A ⊗ B.

The Euclidean norm of x ∈ Rn is denoted by kxk. Also we
define the 1-norm of x by kxk1 = ∑ni=1 |xi |. The maximum real
part of the eigenvalues of A is denoted by η (A). We say that
A is Hurwitz stable if η (A) < 0. The matrix measure [13]
of A ∈ Rn×n is defined by µ (A) = limh→0 (kI + Ahk − 1)/h,
where k·k denotes the maximum singular value. When A is
symmetric and thus has only real eigenvalues, its maximum
eigenvalue is denoted by λmax (A).
An undirected graph is a pair G = (V , E ), where V is
a finite and nonempty set and E is a set consisting of
distinct and unordered pairs (i, j) of i, j ∈ V . We call the
elements of V vertexes and those of E edges. The adjacency
matrix AG of G is defined as the square {0, 1}-matrix of
size |V | whose (i, j) entry is one if and only if (i, j) ∈ E .
Clearly the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is
symmetric and has zero diagonals. We say that j ∈ V is
a neighbor of i ∈ V (or i and j are adjacent) if (i, j) ∈ V .
The degree of i is defined as the number of the neighbors
of i.
The expectation of a random variable is denoted by E[·].
All the Markov processes appearing in this paper are assumed to have finite state spaces.

N ETWORKS
In this section we give a model for the spread of disease
over randomly switched networks using switched differential equations. The model is based on a model called Nintertwined model originally proposed for epidemics over
static networks [5]. Then we will review some results on the
stability of switched linear systems that will be used in this
paper.
A. N-intertwined Model for Static Networks
We first give an overview of the N-intertwined model [5]
for so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible types of disease. Let a population be modeled by an undirected graph G
over vertexes {1, . . . , n}. We regard each vertex as an agent
who can be infected and also can transmit disease to its
neighbors. In the model, at each time t ≥ 0, each vertex
can be in one of the two states: susceptible or infected. We
assume that, when a vertex i is infected, the transition to the
susceptible state occurs following a Poisson process with
rate δi , called curing rate. On the other hand, if i is in the
susceptible state and one if its neighbors is in the infected
state, then i will make a transition to the infected state by
following a Poisson process with rate β j , called infection
rate. All the Poisson processes are assumed to be independent. Throughout this paper we assume that population has
homogeneous infection rate β and curing rate δ , i.e., we
assume that β1 = · · · = βn = β and δ1 = · · · = δn = δ .
Let pi (t) denote the probability that the vertex i is infected.
Define p = [p1 · · · pn ]⊤ and P = diag(p1 , . . . , pn ). Then the
N-intertwined model [5] reads
dp
= (β AG − δ I)p − β PAG p,
dt

(1)

where p(0) = p0 ∈ [0, 1]n . We notice that clearly p(t) ≥ 0 for
every t ≥ 0.
B. Switched N-intertwined Model
Based on the N-intertwined model (1) we can readily
state our model of disease spread over randomly switched
networks. We assume that our randomly switched network is
modeled as Gσ := {Gσ (t) }t≥0 , where σ = {σ (t)}t≥0 is a timehomogeneous Markov process taking its values in {1, . . . , N}
and G1 , . . . , GN are undirected graphs over vertexes {1, . . . , n}.
Examples of such random switched graphs include the activity driven networks [14], graphs with edge swapping [8], and
temporal exponential random graphs [15]. Then we model
the disease spread over the randomly switched network Gσ
by the switched N-intertwined model
Σ:

dp
= (β AGσ (t) − δ I)p − β PAGσ (t) p,
dt

where p(0) = p0 ∈ [0, 1]n and σ (0) = σ0 ∈ {1, . . . , N} are
arbitrary constants.
The principal aim of this paper is to give conditions under
which the zero equilibrium of Σ is stable, i.e., the infection
probability p converges or stays close to the origin. We
introduce the following definitions.
Definition 2.1: We say that Σ is
1) mean stable if there exist C > 0 and ε > 0 such that, for
every p0 and σ0 , it holds that E[kp(t)k] ≤ Ce−ε t kp0 k;
2) almost surely stable if, for every p0 and σ0 , it holds
that P (limt→∞ kp(t)k = 0) = 1.
The following linearized model
Σ̄ :

d p̄
= (β AGσ (t) − δ I) p̄
dt

(2)

of Σ plays as an important role as the one for static
networks does in [16], [17], where the authors propose
the optimal vaccination strategy for the disease spread over
static networks. We let the initial conditions of Σ̄ given
by constants p̄(0) = p̄0 ∈ [0, 1]n and σ (0) = σ̄0 ∈ {1, . . . , N}.
The next lemma is easy to see but fundamental.
Lemma 2.2: If p0 = p̄0 and σ0 = σ̄0 , then we have
kp(t)k1 ≤ k p̄(t)k1 for every t ≥ 0 with probability one.
Proof: Let e(t) = p̄(t) − p(t). Then e(0) = 0 and also
de/dt = β PAGσ (t) p ≥ 0 because all of β , P, AGσ (t), and p are
nonnegative. Therefore p(t) ≤ p̄(t) entry-wise for every t ≥
0. Finally multiply 1⊤
n to the obtained inequality from the
left to obtain the desired inequality.
Therefore, the study of the stability of Σ can be reduced
to that of the switched linear system Σ̄, for which various
results from the theory of switched linear systems [10] are
available. We will review some of the results in the next
section.
C. Stability of Markov Jump Linear Systems
As in the previous section let σ = {σ (t)}t≥0 be a timehomogeneous Markov process taking its values in {1, . . . , N}

and let A1 , . . . , AN ∈ Rn×n . Consider the switched linear
system (called Markov jump linear system [10])
dx
= Aσ (t) x,
dt

(3)

where x(0) = x0 ∈ Rn and σ (0) = σ0 are arbitrary constants.
The stability of Markov jump linear systems is defined in
the following standard way.
Definition 2.3: We say that (3) is
1) mean stable if there exist C > 0 and ε > 0 such that
E[kx(t)k] ≤ Ce−ε t kx0 k for all x0 and σ0 ;
2) almost surely stable if, for all x0 and σ0 , there holds
P (limt→∞ kx(t)k = 0) = 1.
We say that the Markov jump linear system (3) is positive [18] if x0 ≥ 0 implies x(t) ≥ 0 for every t ≥ 0 with
probability one. For the system (3) to be positive, it is
necessary and sufficient that all the matrices A1 , . . . , AN are
Metzler. For example, Σ̄ defined in (2) is a positive Markov
jump linear system. The next stability condition is obtained
in [18].
Proposition 2.4: Assume that the Markov jump linear
system (3) is positive. Let Π ∈ RN×N be the infinitesimal
generator of σ . Then (3) is mean stable if and only if the
matrix
A = Π⊤ ⊗ In + diag(A1 , . . . , AN ) ∈ RnN×nN
is Hurwitz stable.
We also recall the next proposition, which gives a sufficient condition for the almost sure stability of not necessarily
positive Markov jump linear systems.
Proposition 2.5 ([19, Theorem 4.2]): Assume that σ has
the unique stationary distribution π . Then (3) is almost surely
stable if E[µ (Aπ )] < 0.
III. D ISEASE S PREAD OVER R ANDOMLY S WITCHED
N ETWORKS WITH I NDEPENDENT E DGES
The aim of this section is to give an easy to apply sufficient
condition for the stability of the switched N-intertwined
model Σ under the assumption that the underlying randomly
switched network has independent edges.
A. Computational Difficulty
Before presenting the main result we first observe the computational difficultly of the stability analysis. Theoretically,
the next proposition completely solves the problem by giving
a necessary and sufficient condition for mean stability via the
eigenvalues of a matrix.
Proposition 3.1: Let Π ∈ RN×N be the infinitesimal generator of the Markov process σ . Define
Aβ = Π⊤ ⊗ In + β diag(AG1 , . . . , AGN ).
Then, Σ is mean stable if and only if η (Aβ ) < δ .
Proof: The Markov jump linear system Σ̄ is positive because the matrix β AGi − δ I is Metzler for every i. Therefore,
using Proposition 2.4, one can see that η (Aβ ) < δ implies

that Σ̄ is mean stable. Thus, by Lemma 2.2, we can show
that Σ is also mean stable.
On the other hand, assume that Σ is mean stable. Here
we provide only a sketch of the proof. By Theorem 3.8
in [20], we can show that Σ admits Lyapunov functions.
Then it turns out that these Lyapunov functions also apply
to Σ̄ around a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin.
This is because, in such a neighborhood, the second order
term β PAGσ p of Σ can be ignored compared with its linear
term. Therefore we can conclude that Σ̄ is also mean stable.
Hence, again by Proposition 2.4, we obtain η (Aβ ) < δ .
Though Proposition 3.1 gives a practical characterization
of stability when the size n of a switched network is
effectively small, unfortunately, it cannot be easily used
for real world networks with a large n. The size of the
matrix Aβ equals nN, where N is the number of all the
possible configurations of the switched network. This N can
be very large when the network has many agents and can
have various
 patterns of topology. In the extreme case when
all the n2 = n(n − 1)/2 possible edges can be present or
not independently, N equals the rapidly growing exponential 2n(n−1)/2. By the same reason, Proposition 2.5 is often
not easy to use in practice when n is large because it involves
finding the matrix measure of a potentially huge number of
matrices. We also remark that, in such a situation, it would
be computationally too expensive to even estimate a stability
condition by simulation.
These difficulties motivate us to find easy to apply sufficient conditions for stability when the size of a network is
large.
B. Stability Condition for Switched Edge-independent Networks
One of the classical models of large-scale and random
but static networks is Erdős–Rényi graphs [21], in which
edges are assigned uniformly and independently for each
pair of vertexes. Based on the fact that the distributions of
the degrees of Erdős–Rényi graphs shows a large deviation
from those of real world networks, recently Chung [11]
proposed an improved version of the graphs by removing
the uniformity constraint.
Extending the above models, in this paper we study the
disease spread over edge-independent random dynamical
networks defined as follows.
Definition 3.2: For distinct i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n} we let
Ai j = {Ai j (t)}t≥0 denote the (i, j)-element of the matrixvalued stochastic process AGσ . We say that Gσ has independent edges if the processes {Ai j }i> j are stochastically
independent.
Then our assumption on the randomly switched network Gσ can be stated as follows.
Assumption 3.3: Gσ has independent edges and σ has a
unique stationary distribution.
Remark 3.4: The existence of a unique stationary distribution is not very restrictive because a Markov process in
general has a unique stationary distribution under a mild
assumption of irreducibility and recurrence property.

Let π denote the stationary distribution of σ . Then Gπ
is the random stationary graph with the random adjacency
matrix AGπ . Define Ā = E[AGπ ] and
 n

(4)
∆ = max ∑ Āi j (1 − Āi j ) .
1≤i≤n

j=1

Without loss of generality we assume ∆ > 0, because otherwise ∆ = 0 and therefore the graph process Gσ equals the
static network having the {0, 1}-matrix Ā as its adjacency
matrix. In this case Σ coincides with the N-intertwined
model (1) for static networks and therefore Σ is stable if
and only if λmax (Ā) < δ /β as found in [5].
The next theorem gives an easy-to-use alternative of
Proposition 3.1 and is the main result of this paper.
Theorem 3.5: Define the function f on [0, ∞) by

f (s) = s + 2n exp −
2s + 6∆
Then Σ is almost surely stable if

λmax (Ā) + min f (s) < δ /β .
s≥0

(6)

Remark 3.6: We can understand the quantity mins≥0 f (s)
as the measure of uncertainty because the quantity increases
with respect to ∆, which measures the variance of the
stationary random graph Gπ .
We note that the size of the matrix Ā in the condition (6)
is only n and is much smaller than that of Aβ in Proposition 3.1. Also Ā can be found as follows. Since Gσ has
independent edges, each scalar-valued stochastic process Ai j
is a {0, 1}-valued time-homogeneous Markov process. Then
its infinitesimal generator is of the form


−pi j pi j
qi j −qi j
for some pi j , qi j ≥ 0. The uniqueness of the stationary distribution of σ yields that pi j + qi j > 0. Then we can easily show
that the stationary distribution of Ai j , denoted by πi j , is given
by πi j ({0}) = qi j /(pi j + qi j ) and πi j ({1}) = pi j /(pi j + qi j ).
Therefore we obtain Āi j = pi j /(pi j + qi j ) when i 6= j and
Āii = 0 for every i.
Moreover, the next proposition shows that the minimum mins≥0 f (s) in (6) can be found by solving a convex
program.
Proposition 3.7: There exists 0 < s0 < 2∆ such that f is
convex on [s0 , ∞) and

C. Proofs
In this section we give the proofs of Theorem 3.5 and
Proposition 3.7. For the proof of Theorem 3.5 we state two
propositions.
Proposition 3.8: If E[λmax (AGπ )] < δ /β , then Σ is almost
surely stable.
Proof: Recall [13] that, if A is a real symmetric matrix,
then µ (A) = λmax (A). Thus we have µ (AGπ ) = λmax (AGπ )

with probability one. Now assume E[λmax (AGπ )] < δ /β .
Then E[µ (β AGπ − δ I)] = E[λmax (β AGπ − δ I)] < 0. Therefore, by Proposition 2.5, Σ̄ is almost surely stable; i.e.,
k p̄(t)k → 0 as t → ∞ with probability one. Therefore, by
using the equivalence of the norms k·k and k·k1 and also
Lemma 2.2, we can show the almost sure stability of Σ.
To evaluate E[λmax (AGπ )] we will need the following result
from the spectral theory of random graphs.
Proposition 3.9 ([22, p. 7]): Let G be a random undirected graph on the vertex set {1, . . . , n}, where two vertexes
are adjacent in G independently. Let Ā = E[AG ] and define
∆ by (4). Then, for every s ≥ 0,


3s2
P({λmax (A) > λmax (Ā) + s}) ≤ 2n exp −
. (8)
2s + 6∆
Now we prove Theorem 3.5.
Proof of Theorem 3.5: Notice that the function f is
well defined. Since Gσ has independent edges, any pair
of vertexes are adjacent independently with others in the
random graph Gπ . Therefore Proposition 3.9 applies to Gπ .
Let Ω denote the underlying probability space and define,
for each s ≥ 0,
Ωs = {ω ∈ Ω : λmax (AGπ ) > λmax (Ā) + s}.

If ω ∈ Ωcs , then λmax (AGπ ) ≤ λmax (Ā) + s. On the other hand,
if ω ∈ Ωs , then we have the trivial estimate λmax (AGπ ) < n.
Therefore, by (8) we obtain
E[λmax (AGπ )] < P(Ωcs )(λmax (Ā) + s) + P(Ωs)n


3s2
2
≤ λmax (Ā) + s + 2n exp −
2s + 6∆
= λmax (Ā) + f (s).

(9)

Since f is continuous and also f (s) diverges to +∞ as s → ∞,
the minimum mins≥0 f (s) exists. Therefore, taking the minimum with respect to s ≥ 0 on the most right hand side of
(9) proves E[λmax (AGπ )] ≤ λmax (Ā) + mins≥0 f (s). Hence, if
(6) holds, then Σ is almost surely stable by Proposition 3.8.
Then we give the proof of Proposition 3.7.
Proof of Proposition 3.7: Let us only prove the convexity part, as the equation (7) follows from a straightforward
argument. Throughout this proof we shall work with the
translation of f defined by g(s) = f (s − 3∆) (s ≥ 3∆). We
need to show that there exists 3∆ < s0 < 5∆ such that g is
convex on [s0 , ∞). Define h1 , h2 : [3∆, ∞) → R by
√
p
c1 (c2 s2 − c3 + 2c3 s)
, h2 (s) = c2 s2 − c3 − 2c3 s,
h1 (s) = 4
−1
s exp(c2 s + c3s )

where c1 = 2n2 e9∆ , c2 = 3/2, and c3 = 27∆2/2. Then we
can easily show that g′′ = h1 h2 . It is trivial to check that
h1 (s) ≥ 0. Also, since h2 (3∆) < 0 and h′2 (s) > 0, there exists
s0 > 3∆ such that h2 < √
0 on [3∆, s0 ) and
√ h2 > 0 on (s0 , ∞).
Since h(5∆) = 24∆2 − 3 15∆ > (24 − 3 15)∆2 > 0, we can
check s0 < 5∆. The above argument yields g′′ < 0 on [3∆, s0 ),
as desired. Then we can prove (7) by carefully investigating
the derivatives g′ and g′′ . The details are omitted.

IV. E XAMPLES
In this section we apply Theorem 3.5 to the following
important classes of dynamical graphs: randomly switched
graphs with communities [23] and expected degrees [11].
A. Switched Graphs with Community Structure
Let us consider a population grouped into the two communities V1 = {1, . . . , n1 } and V2 = {n1 + 1, . . . , n1 + n2 }.
We assume that, for any pair of vertexes (i, j), the edgeprocess Ai j has the stationary distribution µi j that depends
only on the communities to which i and j belong. Therefore,
there exist θ1 , θ2 , φ ∈ [0, 1] such that
(
θℓ i, j ∈ Vℓ , ℓ = 1, 2,
µi j ({1}) =
φ otherwise.
Then it follows that

θ 1
− θ1 In1
Ā = 1 n1 ,n1
φ 1n2 ,n1


φ 1n1 ,n2

θ2 1n2 ,n2 − θ2 In2

Therefore
∆ = max (n1 − 1)θ1 (1 − θ1 ) + n2φ (1 − φ ),


(n2 − 1)θ2 (1 − θ2 ) + n1φ (1 − φ ) .

Also we can show that

λmax (Ā) =

n1 θ1 + n2 θ2 +

p
(n1 θ1 − n2θ2 )2 + 4n1n2 φ 2
−ε
2

for some ε lying in between θ1 and θ2 .
For example let n1 = 104 , n2 = 105 , θ1 = 0.5, θ2 = 0.3,
and φ = 0.1. Then one can compute λmax (Ā) = 3.04 · 104 .
Also, by solving the convex program (7), we can easily find
maxs≥0 f (s) = 9.83 · 102 , which is effectively smaller than
λmax (Ā). Then, by Theorem 3.5, Σ is almost surely stable if
3.14 · 104 < δ /β . We remark that, in this case, it is almost
impossible to use Proposition 3.1 because the matrix Aβ has
the dimension more than 10109 .
B. Switched Graphs with Expected Degrees
In this section we study the special case when the expected
adjacency matrix Ā has the following structure.
Assumption 4.1: There exist α1 , . . . , αn ≥ 0 such that
Āi j = αi α j

for every distinct pair (i, j).
Epidemiologically, one can regard the constant αi as
the measure of the activity of the vertex i. Then we can
understand Assumption 4.1 as stating that the frequency
of the interaction between two agents i and j is solely
determined by those activity measure.
Also Assumption 4.1 can be supported by its connection
to one of the well known models of random graphs. Let
d ∈ Rn be nonzero and nonnegative and let ρ = 1/(∑ni=1 di ).
We say that an undirected random graph G has expected
degrees d [11] if edges are independently assigned to each
pair of vertexes (i, j) with probability ρ di d j . We can show
the next proposition under Assumptions 3.3 and 4.1. The
proof is straightforward and is hence omitted.

Proposition 4.2: For each i let di = αi ∑nj=1 α j . The stationary graph Gπ has expected degrees d.
The next theorem gives a sufficient condition for the
almost sure stability of Σ in terms of the expected degrees
of the stationary graph Gπ .
Theorem 4.3: Let
n

∑ ρ did j (ρ − did j )
1≤i≤n

d˜ = ρ ∑ di2 , ∆d = max
i=1

j=1

and define the function f by (5) with ∆ replaced by ∆d . Then
Σ is almost surely stable if
d˜ + min f (s) ≤ δ /β .
(10)
s≥0

Moreover mins≥0 f (s) satisfies (7).
Proof: It is straightforward to see that, for the random
graph Gπ , the quantity ∆ defined in (4) equals ∆d . Moreover,
since Ā = ρ dd ⊤ , we can show λmax (Ā) = d.˜ Thus the
sufficient condition (10) immediately follows from (6). The
proof of the latter claim is exactly the same as that of
Proposition 3.7.
Example 4.4: One of the well-used model of the degree
sequences is those with power law distributions [11], [22].
We say that a degree sequence d ∈ Rn has the power law
distribution with the power law exponent β > 2, maximum
degree ∆ > 0, and average degree d¯ > 0 if
di = c(i + i0 − 1)−1/(β −1)
for every i, where

For example let n = 107, β = 2.2, ∆ = 5 · 105, and d¯ = 103 .
Then we have d˜ = 3.15 · 104 . Also, by solving the convex
program (7) we obtain mins≥0 f (s) = 1.97·103. Therefore, by
Theorem 4.3, Σ is almost surely stable if 3.35 · 104 < δ /β .
We remark that the quantity mins≥0 f (s) measuring uncertainty is relatively small compared with λmax (Ā).
V. D ISEASE S PREAD OVER R ANDOMLY S WITCHED
N ETWORKS WITH W EIGHTS
In this section, we extend the result obtained in Section III
to the networks modeled by weighted graphs. We start by
giving necessary definitions.
Definition 5.1: Let V be a finite set and let E be the
set of all the distinct and unordered pairs of the elements
of V . Also let w : E → [0, ∞) : (i, j) 7→ w(i, j) be a function.
We call the pair (V , w) a weighted undirected graph. An
element of V (E ) is called a vertex (edge, respectively). For
an edge e ∈ E , We call w(e) the weight of e.
Let V = {1, . . . , n}. The adjacency matrix A(V ,w) ∈ Rn×n
of an weighted undirected graph (V , w) is defined by
[A(V ,w) ]i j = w(i, j) for i 6= j and [A(V ,w) ]ii = 0 for every i.
When no confusion arises we write A(V ,w) as Aw . We notice
that Aw is symmetric because (i, j) and ( j, i) are the same
unordered pairs. Then we call the differential equation
dp
= (β Aw − δ I)p − β PAw p
dt

the N-intertwined model of disease spread over (V , w).
Epidemiologically, the weight w(i, j) expresses the strength
of the communication between the agents i and j, in the
sense that instantaneous rate that disease transmits from i
to j (provided i is infected and j is not) equals the product β w(i, j). This in particular implies that, without loss of
generality, we can normalize w as
w(i, j) ≤ 1

(11)

by taking β sufficiently large.
Then, as in Section II-B, let us assume that the weight of
the given network of agents changes over time according to
a time-homogeneous Markov process, i.e., suppose that there
exists a time-homogeneous Markov process σ = {σ (t)}t≥0
such that the weight of the graph at time t ≥ 0 is given by the
function wσ (t) : E → [0, ∞) : (i, j) 7→ wσ (t) (i, j). Then we can
model the disease spread over time-varying, weighted, and
undirected graph Gσ := (V , wσ ) by the switched differential
equation
dp
= (β Awσ (t) − δ I)p − β PAwσ (t) p.

The almost sure stability of Σw is defined in the same
way as Definition 2.1. Also, extending Definition 3.2, We
say that Gσ has independent edges if the stochastic processes {wσ (·) (i, j)}(i, j)∈E are independent.
If σ has a stationary distribution π , then we let Var(Awπ )
be the n × n real matrix obtained by taking the variances of
the random matrix Awπ entry-wise. Since σ is assumed to
have finitely many states, each entry of Awπ is a distribution
having finite support so that it is straightforward to find
Var(Awπ ). The next theorem extends Theorem 3.5 to the
weighted and randomly switched networks.
Theorem 5.2: Assume that Gσ has independent edges and
σ has the unique stationary distribution π . Let Ā = E[Awπ ]
and also let ∆ be the maximum row sum of Var(Awπ ). Define
the function f by (5). If (6) holds, then Σw is almost surely
stable. Moreover the minimum mins≥0 f (s) can be found by
solving the convex program (7).
Proof: From [22] we can easily check that Proposition 3.9 holds for a weighted random graph as long as its
weights are all less than one with probability one and we
replace ∆ by the maximum row sum of Var(AG ). Therefore,
under the normalization (11), we can apply Proposition 3.9
to the stationary random graph Gπ and prove the theorem in
the same way as Theorem 3.5. The details of the proof are
omitted.

VI. C ONCLUSION
We studied the disease spread over randomly switched
networks having stochastically independent edges. The disease spread was modeled by a switched version of the
N-intertwined model for static networks. Using the stability
theory of Markov jump linear systems and the spectral theory
of random matrices, we gave sufficient conditions for epidemics dying out almost surely. We can check the proposed
conditions by finding the maximum real eigenvalue of a

matrix whose size equal the number of the agents and thus
is highly efficient compared with another condition based
solely on the stability theory. We also gave an extension to
the case when networks are modeled by weighted graphs.
