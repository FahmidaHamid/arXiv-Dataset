Abstract: Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles
during apoptosis, and we presume some of them may also protect the cell from
oxidative stress. We found that the absence of yeast caspase 1（Yca1）in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to a more intense burst of mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ROS). In addition, compared to wild type yeast cells, the ability of
yca1 mutant cells to maintain mitochondrial activity is significantly reduced after
either oxidative stress treatment or aging. During mitochondrial ROS burst, deletion
of the yca1 gene delayed structural damage of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)
reporter bound in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This work implies that yeast
caspase 1 is closely connected to the oxidative stress response. We speculate that
Yca1 can discriminate proteins damaged by oxidation and accelerate their hydrolysis
to attenuate the ROS burst.
Key words: yeast caspase 1; ROS burst; protein hydrolysis; ROS elimination

1. Introduction
The unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a useful model to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. S.
cerevisiae PCD shares many morphological and biochemical features with
mammalian apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA
fragmentation. One hallmark of apoptosis in mammalian cells is the induction of
caspases. Caspases are direct regulators of both cytokine-induced and stress-induced
cell apoptosis that act as proteases that initiate and execute cell death through the
degradation of cellular components (Nicholson 1999; Alenzi, Lotfy et al. 2010). Yeast

contains only one gene homolog of caspases, named YCA1, encoding the metacaspase
yeast caspase 1 (Madeo, Herker et al. 2002). This metacaspase adopts a caspase-like
fold, with active site loops arranged similarly to other caspases (Wong, Yan et al.
2012)，but with different substrate specificity than caspases (Wilkinson and Ramsdale
2011). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was the first identified
Yca1-specific substrate degraded during H2O2-induced programmed cell death (Silva,
Almeida et al. 2011). Recent work has indicated that some caspases may play roles in
other processes in addition to their death functions (Yi and Yuan 2009; Shrestha and
Megeney 2012). Many genes involved in stress response, instead of genes encoding
effectors or markers of apoptosis, exhibit a particular transcriptional response prior to
the initiation of apoptosis (Munoz, Wanichthanarak et al. 2012). The roles of Yca1 in
the mechanism of yeast PCD and in other stress response processes remain poorly
understood.
Both in yeast and in mammalian PCD, mitochondria play a major role in the final
determination of cell fate. The extent to which yeast PCD resembles and precedes
apoptotic death in multicellular organisms or is a distinct form of PCD remains
unknown. Some researchers have proposed that the programmed cell death in
unicellular yeast cells may serve to eliminate unwanted cells or to increase the health
and adaptation ability of the population (Herker et al., 2004), though the evolutionary
benefit of a cellular suicide program in unicellular organism remains poorly
understood.
In yeast, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production usually precedes caspase
activation (Madeo, Herker et al. 2004; Perrone, Tan et al. 2008). In our previous work,
we found that a concentration of 30 mM formic acid results in a rapid burst of
intracellular ROS in mitochondria. Interestingly, formic acid treatment of logarithmic
phase cells resulted in a higher level of ROS in yca1 mutant cells than that produced
in wild type cells, suggesting a role for Yca1 in anti-oxidation (Du, Su et al. 2008).

We propose that in S.cerevisiae, Yca1 may affect mitochondrial activity and attenuate
the generation or diffusion of ROS. In this work, we inhibit the activity of Yca1 and
then observe the effects of this inhibition on the burst of ROS. We hypothesize that
the aspartic enzyme activity of Yca1 promotes the fast degradation of oxidized
proteins during ROS burst (Du, Lu et al. 2009; Du 2010).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Yeast strains, plasmids and medium
We used the S. cerevisiae strain BY4741 and a derivative of BY4741 in which the
YCA1 gene was deleted. This strain contains no pigment to interfere in fluorescence
assays. Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 and the yca1 mutant strain were
kind gifts from Professor David Goldfarb of University of Rochester. Cells were
grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone and 2% glucose), or in
selective synthetic and complete media.
2.2 Fusion of GFP with mitochondrial protein
A pYES-mtGFP plasmid, provided by Westermann and Neupert (Westermann
and Neupert 2002), expressed a galactose-inducible, mitochondrial ATPase-targeted
green fluorescent protein (GFP). This plasmid was transformed into yeast BY4741
wild type and yca1 mutant cells using the LiAc protocol (Guthrie and Fink, 1991).
2.3 Observation of intracellular ROS with confocal microscopy
The cells were incubated with 5 μg/mL dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123,
Sigma-Aldrich) or 20 μM 2', 7’- dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA, Cayman
Co.) for 10 min at 37°C. After formic acid treatment, cells were placed on a slide.
Confocal microscopy (Leica TCS-SP2) was used to observe the cells using an
excitation wavelength of 488nm and an emission wavelength of 525nm.
2.4 Flow cytometry analysis of ROS level during mitochondrial ROS burst
Wild type BY4741 and the yca1 mutant were cultured for 6h (30°C, 200 r / min
shaking) to early logarithmic phase. 2μL of 10 mM DCFH-DA dissolved in DMSO

was added to 1 mL cell culture, for a final concentration of 20μM DCFH-DA. After
incubation in the dark for 5 min, samples were treated with 15 μM of broad-spectrum
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK（from Promega）and incubated in the dark for 10 min.
The same volume of DMSO was added to the control sample. Formic acid was
quickly added to each sample, and cells were again incubated in the dark. At different
time points after formic acid addition, 100μL of each sample was combined with
900μL chilled PBS, transferred to FACS tubes, and analyzed immediately by flow
cytometry. After analysis of all samples, re-analysis of samples was carried out in the
same sequence. The excitation wavelength of FACS was 488 nm and the emission
wavelength was 530 nm.
In order to detect superoxide anion, we used 10 mM of the fluorescence probe
Dihydroethidium (DHE, dissolved in DMSO). 0.5μL of this probe solution was added
to 1 mL cell culture; the final concentration of DHE was 5μM. Cells were incubated
in the dark for 15 min at 30 °C, treated with different concentrations of formic acid in
the dark, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The excitation wavelength was 535
nm, and the emission wavelength was 610 nm.
2.5 Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential
1μL of 1mM Rhodamine 123 (RH123) was added to 1mL yeast cell suspension
and observed with confocal microscopy or analyzed with flow cytometry immediately
to detect the potential change of the inner mitochondrial membrane (ΔΨm). The
excitation wavelength was 488 nm and the emission wavelength was 530 nm.

Results
YCA1 gene deletion does not affect the potential of mitochondrial membrane

or the mitochondrial production of superoxide anion in logarithmic phase cells
Formic acid has been shown to inhibit the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
(Liesivuori and Savolainen 1991). Our previous work showed that formic acid can

induce a rapid ROS burst in logarithmically-growing yeast cells, and that
mitochondria are the major producer of ROS (Du, Su et al. 2008). Here, we used
formic acid to induce intracellular ROS burst and determine the effect of Yca1 on the
process of ROS burst in cells.

Fig. 1 A. Mitochondrial membrane potential of wild type and yca1Δ S.cerevisiae cells in log growth
phase. The cells were stained by RH123 and analyzed with FACS.
B. The generation of superoxide anion induced by formic acid in wild type and yca1Δ cells of
S.cerevisiae. The cells were stained by DHE and analyzed with FL2 channel of FACS.

Because the generation of ROS is affected by mitochondrial activity,
mitochondrial activity of wild type and YCA1 mutant strains were first measured
before induction of ROS burst. The production of ROS by mitochondria results in
structural damage to the membrane, leading to a decline in mitochondrial membrane
potential (Zorov, Juhaszova et al. 2006). Thus, mitochondrial membrane potential
reflects the activity of mitochondria and is an indicator of ROS generation. In order to
remove the effect of mitochondria aging and cell aging, wild type and yca1 mutant
cells were cultured to logarithmic phase (6 hour). Next, the cells were labeled with

fluorescent dye RH123 to compare mitochondrial activities quantitatively. We found
that in logarithmic phase, the mitochondrial membrane potentials of wild type and
yca1 mutant cells are almost the same (Fig 1A).
One form of ROS generated from the mitochondrial electron transport chain is
superoxide anion (Simon, Haj-Yehia et al. 2000). In order to compare superoxide
anion production in wild type and yca1 mutant cells after formic acid treatment, the
superoxide anion fluorescent dye DHE was used. As shown in Fig 1B, there is no
significant difference between the superoxide anion positive percentages of wild type
and mutant cells (6.6% and 6.0%), suggesting that both type of cells have similar
ability to generate superoxide anion after formic acid treatment.
Therefore, whether measured by mitochondrial membrane potential or by the
ability to produce superoxide anion with formic acid treatment, the mitochondrial
activity of log phase yca1 mutant cells does not differ from that of wild type cells.

Inhibition of Yca1 activity or knockout of YCA1 gene intensifies the ROS burst in
cytoplasm
DHR123, which can be oxidized into fluorescent RH123, is widely used to detect
ROS. After labeling with DHR123 and treatment of 50mM formic acid for 40 min,
both wild type and yca1 mutant cells showed intense fluorescence, indicating a high
level of ROS (Fig 2A). The average fluorescence in wild type cells seemed stronger
than that in the yca1 mutant cells. However, the intensity of DHR123 fluorescence is
determined by two factors: the level of ROS and the membrane potential of
mitochondria. Therefore, a stronger fluorescent signal from DHR123 in the wild type
cells may not indicate a higher level of ROS. We speculate that this stronger
fluorescence is more likely due to the lower level of ROS, less mitochondrial damage,
and higher mitochondrial membrane potential in the wild type cells, such that the
higher mitochondrial membrane potential results in stronger fluorescence of DRH123.

Fig. 2 A. ROS production induced by formic acid in wild type and yca1Δ cells of S.cerevisiae. The
cells were treated with 50 mM formic acid and stained by 5μg/mL DHR123 and then analyzed by
confocal microscopy (Bar, 5μm) and FACS.
B. ROS level in cytoplasm with formic acid treatment in wild type and yca1Δ cells. The cells
were stained by DCFH-DA in PBS and treated with 50mM formic acid for approximately 40 min and
then analyzed with confocal microscopy (Bar, 10μm) and FACS. The experiment was performed at least
three times, with similar results.
C. ROS burst process induced by 50mM formic acid in wild type and yca1Δ cells stained by
DCFH-DA and incubated in medium. Samples were analyzed by FACS. The experiment was
performed at least three times, with similar results.

Unlike DHR123, DCFH-DA is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, so its
fluorescence intensity is a better indicator of ROS level in cells. yca1 mutant cells,
labeled by DCFH-DA and treated by 50mM formic acid for about 20 min, showed
stronger fluorescence of ROS than wild-type cells, indicating that Yca1 seemed to
affect the burst of ROS (Fig 2B).
Intracellular ROS levels change quickly during ROS burst, so we analyzed the
process of ROS burst in a time-dependent manner for wild type and yca1 null cells.
The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was used to inhibit the activity of
Yca1. After 50mM formic acid treatment, each sample showed rapid ROS production.
At the beginning of detection (5 min), the percentage of ROS positive cells in wildtype cells sample is higher than those in the other three samples (yca1 mutant cells,
wild type cells plus Z-VAD-FMK, and YCA1 gene mutant cells plus Z-VAD-FMK).
However, the proportion of ROS positive wild type cells did not increase significantly
with time, while in the other three samples the percentage of ROS positive cells
increased much faster. After 20 min, most cells in these samples were ROS positive
but the low level of positive cells in the wild type sample persisted. Thus, the
knockout of yeast caspase 1 gene, or the inhibition of Yca1 enzyme activity, increased
the ROS level in cytoplasm during ROS burst (Fig 2C). We compared the death rates
of the two strains and found that the death rate of yca1 mutant cells was also higher
than that of wild type cells (data not shown).

YCA1 gene deletion results in reduced mitochondrial activity during ROS burst
and cell aging
There are some similarities between ROS burst and the cell aging process, both of
which cause oxidative damage. We hypothesized that in aged cells, the deletion of
YCA1 gene would result in a faster reduction of mitochondrial activity. Thus, we
compared the mitochondrial activities of aged wild type cells and yca1 mutant cells.

mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with RH123 staining（Bar, 5μm.）
B. The activity of mitochondrial membrane potential of wild type and yca1Δ cells after ROS burst
or cell aging. The wild type and yca1Δ cells were treated with 60 mM formic acid for 40 min to induce
ROS burst. After cells were washed with PBS, mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with
RH123 staining and FACS analysis. The aging cells cultured for 72 hour were analyzed with the same
method.

Mitochondrial membrane potentials of wild type and yca1 mutant cell were
detected after formic acid treatment and RH123 staining. The experiment result shows
that, after 72h culture, the fluorescence of RH123, an indicator of mitochondrial
membrane potential and mitochondrial activity, is significantly higher in wild type
cells (Fig 3A). Quantitative analysis also showed that the decline of mitochondrial
activity in yca1 mutant cells was faster in the aging process (Fig 3B). Thus, YCA1
deletion decreases the ability of the cell to maintain mitochondrial activity.
Based on the above finding that ROS levels in the wild type cells are relatively
lower during ROS burst, we conclude that a lower level ROS results in less
mitochondrial damage. Therefore the mitochondrial activity of wild type cell is
relatively higher than that of the yca1 mutant. The result that yca1 mutant cells
possess less mitochondrial activity than wild type cells after logarithmic phase may

explain the finding that yca1 mutant cells in stationary phase are more resistant to
hydrogen peroxide than wild type cells (Madeo, Herker et al. 2002; Pereira, Silva et al.
2008). Additionally, we found that during stationary phase, ROS levels in yca1 mutant
cells were lower than in the wild type control after the same formic acid treatment
(data not shown).

Yeast caspase 1 promotes the damage of green fluorescent protein positioned in
the inner mitochondrial membrane during ROS burst

confocal microscope（Bar, 5μm.）,and analyzed with FACS (the PI fluorescence was detected by FL2
channel).
B. Comparison of superoxide anion induced by formic acid and detected with DHE in wild type
and yca1Δ ATPase-GFP cells. The experiment was performed at least three times, with similar results.

C. Effect of formic acid induced ROS burst on the fluorescence intensity of ATPase-GFP in wild
type and yca1Δ cells in stationary phase. The cells were treated for 30 min and 60 min separately, with
formic of 0mM, 20mM, 40mM, 60mM, and PI staining (FL2 channel). The experiment was performed
at least three times, with similar results.

We next investigated why the knockout of YCA1 gene or the inhibition of Yca1
activity intensified the ROS burst. As Yca1 is a protease, we speculated that Yca1
accelerated protein degradation and increased the intracellular concentration of
reductive small molecules to suppress ROS more effectively. In order to observe
hydrolysis by caspsase, we fused GFP to an ATPase located in the inner mitochondrial
membrane of the cell and used fluorescence as an indicator of GFP structural change.
GFP fluorescence in wild type and yca1 mutant cells showed the shape of the
mitochondria clearly (Fig 4A), indicating the specific binding of GFP to the
mitochondrial ATPase.
With the same concentration (60 mM) of formic acid treatment, the superoxide
anion levels (detected with DHE)are not obviously different between the
ATPase-GFP-containing yca1 cells compared to the ATPase-GFP-containing wild
type control (26% and 24 % ) (Fig 4B). Thus, GFP-labeled wild type and yca1 mutant
cells have a similar ability to produce superoxide anion after formic acid treatment.
Figure 4C shows quickly decreasing GFP fluorescence intensity during ROS burst.
We also found that the GFP fluorescence in wild type cells disappeared faster than in
yca1 mutant cells, indicating that GFP structure was damaged faster in the wild type
cells. Therefore, Yca1 promoted rapid GFP destruction or degradation.
Because the GFP is bound and destruction appears to occur rapidly, the GFP is
likely oxidized and degraded directly, rather than being degrading after misfolding or
aggregation.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
Madeo etc. first identified metacaspase Yca1 in S.cerevisiae (Madeo, Herker et al.
2002), also called Mca1 (Vercammen, Declercq et al. 2007). Recent evidence
suggested that yeast metacaspase is involved in some physiological processes in
addition to cell apoptosis: (1) Over-expression of metacaspase in the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe can promote cell growth and enhance resistance of cells
to hydrogen peroxide (Lim, Kim et al. 2007); (2) caspase inhibition improves cell
mortality and leads to generation of ROS (May and Madge 2007); and perhaps most
interesting, (3) the levels of oxidized proteins after H2O2 treatment are higher in a
YCA1 null strain than in a wild type control (Khan, Chock et al. 2005). Although this
result can be explained if the YCA1 null cell is able to endure more oxidative stress
without the process of apoptosis, resulting in more oxidized proteins, this finding
could also be considered as Yca1 playing a role in anti-oxidation.
There has been growing awareness of the physiological significance of Yca1
(Galluzzi, Joza et al. 2008), but a full understanding of its multiple roles in cell and
determining the meaning of apoptosis to single-cell organism has remained elusive.
We studied formic acid induced yeast apoptosis to advance our understanding of
yeast apoptosis and the physiological function of caspase. We found that formic acid
induced a rapid ROS burst, which was even faster in cells lacking Yca1 (Du, Su et al.
2008). Cells have multiple mechanisms to eliminate ROS, such as using SOD
enzymes and reductive substances such as glutathione to quench free radicals, but
these reductive substances are easily consumed while generation of ROS can be quite
robust (Macho, Hirsch et al. 1997; Buonocore, Perrone et al. 2010). Therefore, we
propose that when the intracellular level of ROS reaches a certain level, and strong
reduction components such as glutathione have been depleted, Yca1 is activated to
directly hydrolyze or indirectly promote the hydrolysis of protein, especially
surface-oxidized proteins. The amino acid residue specificity and cleavage point

specificity of this enzyme will allow formation of a hydrophilic double carboxyl
terminal. As a consequence, the structure of the oxidized protein may be destabilized
and more susceptible to further oxidation. These caspase-hydrolyzed proteins may be
then labeled by ubiquitin or disaggregated by HSP, and then completely hydrolyzed
by the proteasome. The hydrolysis product, amino acid or polypeptide, which is more
reductive than protein, can help to eliminate ROS faster. This activation of caspase
may lead to other protective processes, such as cell shrinkage and chromatin
condensation, which can also protect the cell from oxidative damage. This hypothesis
that caspase accelerates degradation of oxidized protein may also help to explain
some previously published findings. Both in human and yeast cells, Khan and
coworkers observed that caspase deletions caused increased levels of intracellular
oxidized protein after H2O2 treatments (Khan, Chock et al. 2005). More recently,
Yca1 was found to accelerate the clearance of insoluble protein aggregates and to
regulate the composition of the insoluble proteome (Lee, Brunette et al. 2010;
Shrestha, Puente et al. 2013).Cells of yca1 mutant cultured in an oxidative stress
condition had lower respiration activities than wild type cells (Lefevre, Sliwa et al.
2012). Finally, recent reports show that elevating YCA1 (MCA1) expression facilitates
the removal of unfolded protein, counteracts accumulation of protein aggregates, and
prolongs cellular life span in an Hsp104 disaggregase- and proteasome-dependent
manner (Hill, Hao et al. 2014; Kampinga 2014).
We tested the hypothesis that Yca1 accelerates the hydrolysis of oxidized protein
during ROS burst and found that formic acid induced an even faster ROS burst in
cells lacking YCA1 or inhibited for Yca1 enzyme activity. We also bound fluorescent
protein (GFP) to the inner mitochondrial membrane and observed its structural change
during ROS burst. GFP is very stable and resistant to hydrolysis (Roucou, Prescott et
al. 2000), but GFP fluorescence disappears rapidly during ROS burst, indicating rapid
changes to GFP structure. GFP fluorescence disappeared more slowly without Yca1

activity, indicating that Yca1 promotes the hydrolysis of GFP.
Oxidative stress is closely related to the maintenance of mitochondrial activity. If
Yca1 reduces oxidative damage, it should also contribute to the maintenance of
mitochondria activity. We found that mitochondrial activity of cells lacking the YCA1
gene did not significantly change during log phase. However, in aging cells, the
mitochondrial activity of yca1 mutant cells decreased faster, indicating Yca1 helped to
maintain mitochondrial activity. Because Yca1 can attenuate the burst of ROS, we
speculate that the cell aging process and burst of the ROS are similar processes of
oxidative damage and that Yca1, which slows the ROS burst, is also able to reduce
mitochondrial damage during aging.
Yca1 may affect mitochondria activity. Mitochondria are a central part of aerobic
metallization and also play an important role in cell apoptosis. In mice, caspase-2
gene deletion decreases the ability to remove oxidation proteins and has a significant
impact on cellular senescence (Zhang, Padalecki et al. 2007). Knockout of the YCA1
gene or inhibition of the corresponding enzyme prolongs the G1/S phase of cell cycle,
slowing down cell growth in fermentation conditions (Lee, Puente et al. 2008).
During the aging process, the fact that mitochondrial activity of the Yca1 mutant
cell is lower than the wild type cells may provide another explanation for the finding
that YCA1 knockout reduces the sensitivity of cells to the stresses of hydrogen
peroxide and acetic acid. (Madeo, Herker et al. 2002; Guaragnella, Pereira et al.
2006). A lower mitochondrial activity of yca1 mutant cells can slow metabolism and
nutrition consumption may explain why these cells survive longer but are unable to
grow as fast as wild type cells in a competitive condition (Herker, Jungwirth et al.
2004).
In addition toYca1, we speculate that other caspases may accelerate the
hydrolysis of oxidized proteins and decrease oxidative damage during ROS burst. The
anti-oxidation function of caspase we suggest here is consistent with the

mitochondrial origin of caspase (Kroemer 1997; Boyce, Degterev et al. 2004).
Caspase, an enzyme that may be an adaptive result of aerobic metabolism, originated
in aerobic bacteria, transferred to eukaryotic cells with mitochondria by symbiosis,
and then evolved as a component of apoptosis. Our results suggest that the primary
function of caspase may be closely linked to the response to oxidation stress in
aerobic metabolism.
