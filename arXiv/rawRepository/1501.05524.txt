Summary
1. Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the environment is fundamental for
understanding the eﬀect of habitat changes on ecosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem
have sought to unify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from available habitat quality,
and mechanistic movement models, where detailed movement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization distribution. Such models bias the animal’s movement towards patches that are easily available
and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability density at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that position. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch of the terrain tends
to be a function of the resource quality in both that patch and the surrounding habitat.
2. We propose a mechanistic model where this non-local eﬀect of resources naturally emerges from the local
movement processes, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat where the animal currently
resides and that of where it is moving. We give statistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data
and demonstrate application of these techniques to GPS location data of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland.
3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the model have complex patterns that cannot be
expressed simply as a function of the local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat are
used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat, whereas isolated patches are used less frequently. Both of these are real aspects of animal space use missing from previous mechanistic resource selection
models.
4. Whilst we focus on habitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any environmental covariates and therefore represents a uniﬁcation of mechanistic modelling and step selection approaches to
understanding animal space use.

Introduction
Uncovering how space use patterns emerge from animal movement is key to understanding a wide range of ecological phenomena, from disease spread (Kenkre et al. 2007; Giuggioli,
Perez-Becker & Sanders 2013) to predator–prey dynamics
(Lewis & Murray 1993), conservation biology (Beier 1993) to
population density (Grant & Kramer 1990). The desire for animals to ﬁnd the resources they need to survive and reproduce is
a fundamental driver of movement in a variety of animal populations (McIntyre & Wiens 1999; Fortin et al. 2003; Breed
et al. 2009; Houston, Higginson & McNamara 2011). Consequently, many theoretical eﬀorts to understand space use have

focused on how animals ﬁnd and select resources from those
available to them (B€
orger, Dalziel & Fryxell 2008).
Resource selection function (RSF) analysis (Manly et al.
2002) is one class of techniques that has been used to address
this problem, ever since the seminal paper of Manly (1974).
This approach posits that the probability of an animal relocating to a particular patch is a function of both the availability
and quality of the resources in the patch. More recently, the
studies of Fortin et al. (2005) and Rhodes et al. (2005) introduced the idea of integrating the RSF with the movement processes of animals, building on the work of Arthur et al. (1996).
Fortin et al. (2005) coined the notion of a step selection function (SSF), where the selection of resources, or other environmental features, directly aﬀects the distance and turning angle
of each step. Meanwhile, Rhodes et al. (2005) constructed a
function for the movement of an animal from one location to

the next based on an RSF. These approaches were uniﬁed and
extended by Forester, Im & Rathouz (2009), who constructed
a function for the movement of animals between successive
turns based on the previous two positions of the animal,
together with the various environmental covariates that aﬀect
its movement.
Parallel to these developments, mechanistic models have
been constructed that describe the detailed underlying movement processes of animals and derive from them the resulting
utilization distribution of animal locations (Moorcroft &
Lewis 2006). For many years, this approach developed more
or less independently from the RSF methods. However, the
study of Moorcroft & Barnett (2008) made inroads into unifying the two theories, by constructing a mechanistic movement
kernel based on an RSF and deriving from that the probability
distribution of the animal. This showed, for the ﬁrst time, how
RSF analysis could be used to link analytically the movement
processes of animals with the emergent features of its space
use.
In the model of Moorcroft & Barnett (2008), the probability
of an animal being in a particular location turns out to be a
function of the quality of resources at that location. Whilst this
is a sensible ﬁrst approximation, one of the consequences of
this model is that animals are just as likely to be found in small
isolated patches of good habitat than within large contiguous
areas of habitat of equal quality. In reality, both isolation and
size of patches are key drivers of space use in many animal populations (Andren 1994; Hill, Thomas & Lewis 1996; Bender,
Contreras & Fahrig 1998). Ideally, mechanistic models that
predict space use accurately should give rise to utilization distributions where occupation probability is positively correlated
with patch size and negatively correlated with isolation.
In this study, we describe a novel mechanistic model of animal movement where the resulting utilization distributions
include both of these features. We also demonstrate how to
parametrize the model from location data, using herds of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland as an example.
There are about 14 major caribou herds on Newfoundland
Island. Most herds exhibit semimigratory behaviour involving
philopatric movements, with females moving every year to traditional calving grounds during spring and summer (Mahoney
& Schaefer 2002). The data we use are of movement within
these calving grounds.
Our model is based on an SSF, from which we derive a
mechanistic master equation, allowing us to compute numerically the steady-state probability distribution of the animal
positions, thus relating quantitatively the movement processes to the emergent space use patterns. Relative intensity
of space use in a given place is a function of diﬀerent movement responses that involve both variation in mean displacements within habitats and preferential movement directions
towards preferred areas (Bastille-Rousseau, Fortin & Dussault 2010). Whilst resource selection analysis does not disentangle explicitly the mechanisms involved (Bastille-Rousseau,
Fortin & Dussault 2010), most mechanistic models do not
consider how animals move selectively from one speciﬁc
resource to another.

Our approach addresses this by modelling the movement
decision based not on the absolute quality of the habitat to
where the animal might move, but the relative quality of
this habitat compared with the habitat where the animal is
currently positioned. Studies of optimal foraging strategies
in mice (Morris & Davidson 2003) demonstrate that shortterm movement decisions of individuals are grounded in the
relative ﬁtness associated with the habitats between which
they are moving. Constructing mechanistic movement models that are based on behavioural decisions arising from
underlying evolutionary forces is important if we wish to
understand not just how space patterns form but why.
Though the results of Morris & Davidson (2003) are based
on mouse populations, their underpinning in the general
theory of natural selection suggests that these ideas may well
extend to other taxa. By grounding the SSF in ideas from
optimal foraging theory, one would expect the model outcomes to be closer to those observed in real ecological
systems.
Indeed, our simple change in the formulation of the step
selection mechanism causes dramatic changes in the utilization
distribution, as the eﬀect of resources on the resulting position
distribution of the animals propagates through the landscape
via their movement processes. In particular, the eﬀects of patch
size and isolation on animal utilization become apparent,
which are not present in previous mechanistic models. We
believe that this modelling framework will prove useful in
building simple yet accurate predictive models of the underlying determinants of complex space use patterns, that account
for both the non-local as well as the local eﬀects of environmental features.

Materials and methods
THE MASTER EQUATION

The master equation (ME) is the key building block in linking individual processes to population patterns. It is deﬁned to be an equation
built from individual movement decisions that gives the probability
density at some time t + Dt as a function of the probability density at
time t, where Dt is some ﬁxed time interval, for example the time
between animal location ﬁxes. As such, it is an example of a one-step
Markov process.
The ME for our model is based on a step selection framework introduced by Fortin et al. (2005) and extended by Forester, Im & Rathouz
(2009), which gives the probability of moving from one location to the
next in a given time interval (i.e. a step). Whilst we use a correlated random walk framework similar to Forester, Im & Rathouz (2009), we
ﬁnd it convenient to reformulate the step selection function (SSF) as
follows
fðxjy; h0 Þ ¼ R
X

Uðxjy; h0 ÞWðx; y; EÞ
;
dx0 Uðx0 jy; h0 ÞWðx0 ; y; EÞ

eqn 1

where f(x|y, h0) is the probability of ﬁnding an animal at position x,
having travelled from y in the previous step, given that it arrived at y on
a bearing of h0 (bearings are measured in an anti-clockwise direction
from the right-hand half of the horizontal axis), Φ(x|y, h0) is the probability of being at x in the absence of habitat selection, given that the animal was previously at y and had arrived there on a bearing of h0 and E

contains details about the environment that we wish to model. In terms
of classical resource selection, Φ(x|y, h0) can be thought of as a function
detailing how available x is to the animal. Typically, it will decay the
further x is away from y so that distant places are less available than
nearby areas.
For example, in Fortin et al. (2005), E contains the distribution of
forest types in the study area, information about predator positions,
snow abundance, topography and road locations. There, Wðx; y; EÞ is
a function of x, y and e that measures features such as the proportion
of the line segment from y to x containing conifer forest, the minimum
distance of this line segment to a road, and various other important
environmental aspects that aﬀect the animals’ movement (Fortin et al.
2005).
The area to which the animal is conﬁned is denoted by Ω. This may
be a geographical limitation of the movement, such a small island, or
conﬁnement to a home range or territory. For certain populations, the
latter may not be stationary over time (Potts, Harris & Giuggioli 2013),
requiring Ω to be replaced by a time-dependent function Ω(t). The size
and shape of Ω(t) may in turn depend upon the past positions of animals in neighbouring territories. However, for the purposes of this
study, we will assume Ω is constant.
The denominator in eqn (1) simply ensures that the function
f(x|y, h0) is a probability density function; that is, it integrates to 1 with
respect to x. The variable x′ is a dummy variable of integration, used to
distinguish positions in the domain of integration from x, the position
to which the animal is moving.
For this study, we divide Ω into habitat types Hi, 1 ≤ i ≤ M. The
set of all habitat types is denoted by H, so that Hi 2 H. We construct an SSF that is based on the habitat at both the beginning of
the step and the end of the step, with the ultimate aim to understand numerically how this aﬀects the resulting animal space use distribution. This is an aspect missing from current work on SSFs or
RSFs, with the exception of the simpler model in Moorcroft & Barnett (2008). We use the non-negative number W(Hi, Hj) to denote
the tendency for the animal to move from habitat Hj to Hi, depending on how preferable the habitat Hi is compared with Hj. If W
(Hi, Hj) > 1 then Hi is more preferable than Hj, whereas W
(Hi, Hj) < 1 means Hj is more preferable than Hi. We denote by H
(x) the habitat at position x. The functional form of our SSF is
then

X

Uðxjy; h0 ÞW½HðxÞ; HðyÞ

eqn 2

Notice that W[H(x), H(y)] can be written as Wðx; y; HÞ to put it in
the form given in eqn (1). However, we choose the former notation as
we believe it to be more instructive for our particular function.
Equation (2) gives rise to the following ME for the probability density function u(x, h, t + Dt) of the animal being at x at time t + Dt having travelled there on a bearing of h

where yh(s) describes the locus of points y upon which the animal could
approach x = (x1, x2) at bearing h, that is, yh(s) = (x1 + cos (h + p)s,
x2 + sin (h + p)s), with s denoting the distance between yh(s) and x.
Here, smax is the distance along this line from x to the boundary of Ω
and so gives the upper endpoint of integration. Though eqn (3) may
look formidable, in practice, it is simple to implement by discretizing
space (see Appendix S1).

DATA COLLECTION METHODS

Since 2006, more than 200 caribou were captured during winter and
ﬁtted with GPS collars that acquired locations every two hours. We
focus our study on 140 caribou followed between 2006 and 2012 and
limit analysis to six distinct herds, which had suﬃcient amounts of
individuals and monitoring. The other caribou were ignored since
there were only a small number per herd. We limit our movement
analysis to the critical, non-migratory period of calving and postcalving (May 1 to September 1), which gives us more than 300 000
position ﬁxes at two-hourly intervals. Every location is given a characterization based on the habitat it falls into, using a reclassiﬁed
Landsat TM imagery (Wulder et al. 2008). Collar equipment use and
capture methods are consistent with American Society of Mammalogists guidelines (Gannon & Sikes 2007). On rare occasions, a position
ﬁx failed to be recorded (0997% of ﬁxes). In each of these cases, we
split the data at that point, so that we only considered steps that were
two hours long. Data required for repeating this study are available
from the Dryad Digital Repository: http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.

MODELLING CARIBOU MOVEMENT

Variations in habitat type can aﬀect animal behaviour, in particular
their step length and turning angle distributions Φ(x|y, h0) (Moorcroft
& Lewis 2006). Therefore, to capture correctly the eﬀect of movement
processes on the space use distribution, it is necessary to split Φ(x|y, h0)
into a sum of functions, one for each habitat type, as follows
X
Iðy; hÞUh ðxjy; h0 Þ;
eqn 4
Uðxjy; h0 Þ ¼
h2H

where I(y, h) is an indicator function taking the value 1 if H(y) = h
and 0 otherwise, and H is the set of all habitat types available to the
animal. Notice that this only depends on the habitat where the
animal currently resides (position y) so that Φ(x|y, h0) is independent
of the selection of the next habitat the animal is to move to (at
position x).
Φ(x|y, h0) contains information about both the step length, that is,
the distance travelled in successive relocations and the turning angle
between successive steps. Whilst in general, the distribution of these
two aspects of movement may depend on one another, a linear–circular
correlation test between the step length and turning angle distributions
for the caribou data has R2 = 0027, suggesting the two distributions
are not tightly correlated. Therefore, we assume that they are independent, so that
Uh ðxjy; h0 Þ ¼ Vh ½wðx; y; h0 Þqh ðjx  yjÞ;

eqn 5

where Vh(φ) is the turning angle distribution for habitat h, w(x, y, h0)
calculates the turning angle for an animal that has just travelled to y on
a bearing of h0 and turns to move in a straight line towards x, and qh(r)
is the step length distribution for habitat h. For the step lengths, we
tried ﬁtting exponential and Weibull distributions and found the Weibull distribution to give the best ﬁt, using a likelihood ratio test. This
has the following form

For the turning angles, we tried ﬁtting both univariate and bivariate
von Mises distributions (McKenzie et al. 2012) using a likelihood ratio
test. The latter was tested because caribou may make use of linear features, such as paths, and it turned out to be the better of the two. It has
the following form

where I0(x) is the zeroth order modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind.
The ﬁrst summand in eqn (7) represents the tendency for the caribou to
continue in a similar direction. The second summand is due to a bias in
the data towards the caribou performing 180° turns between successive
steps. Part of the measured bias towards 180° turns can be due to errors
in GPS measurements (Hurford 2009), so to rule this cause out, we
removed locations where caribou moved <25 m, following the methods
detailed in Hurford (2009). This amounted to 198% of the ﬁxes.
Notice that we only removed such data for the analysis of turning
angles, not for the step lengths or the resource weighting function W
(Hi, Hj). We found that the bivariate von Mises distribution provides a
better ﬁt than the univariate von Mises distribution for the turning
angles.

PARAMETRIZING THE MASTER EQUATION FROM
LOCATION DATA

We estimated the parameters a, b, k1 and k2 for the function Φ(x|y, h0)
using the maximum-likelihood method, with the Nelder–Mead simplex
algorithm (Lagarias et al. 1998). To calculate the resource weighting
function W(Hi, Hj), we wish to capture the probability P(Hi|y, h0, wij)
of an animal moving into habitat type Hi, given its present position y,
trajectory h0 and weights wij = W(Hi, Hj) (see Fig. 1). In other words,
we aim to maximize the likelihood function

where Xi ¼ fx 2 XjHðxÞ ¼ Hi g.
Whilst it is, in principle, possible to calculate the maximum of the
likelihood function (eqn 8) by numerically evaluating the integrals in
eqn (9) for each data point, this is highly computationally intensive
if the data set is large, which is often the case with GPS telemetry
data. We instead choose a more eﬃcient method that makes use of
a Monte Carlo sampling procedure. For each n ∊ {2, 3, …, N},
where {x1, …, xN} is the set of animal locations, we sample
M = 100 times from Φ(x|xn1, hn1) to give a set Sn of possible next
animal positions, disregarding the biasing eﬀect that resources have
on the movement. The reason for using M = 100 is to reduce computational time for analysing our large data set (>300 000 steps),
and by examining a small subset of the data using M = 1000, we
obtain similar results to M = 100. We then use the approximation

Python maximize() function from the SciPy library (Jones, Oliphant & Peterson 2001). The likelihood function for the entire data set

is simply the product Lðwij Þ ¼ j¼1 Lj ðwij Þ, where jHj is the number

the set of steps 100 times and calculated the maximum likelihood
parameter values for each. Error bars are standard deviations of the
results.
NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE MODEL

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the movement model. The animal
represented here has moved to point y on the trajectory given by the
black lines in an environment with three resource types: A, B and C.
Suppose that C is the most preferable habitat for the animal, followed
by A, with B being resource poor. Three of the many possible next steps
for the animal are to x1, x2 or x3. In the absence of a resource response,
and assuming that the animal is a correlated walker with a step length
distribution that decays with increasing distance, the most likely move
would be to x2 in patch B. However, due to the poor quality of patch B,
the animal may instead decide to take a sharp left turn to stay in patch
A (represented by a move to x2) or even to take a sharp right turn and
move the longer distance in order to end in the highest-quality patch C
(represented by a move to x3).

To investigate the model, we constructed artiﬁcial resource landscapes
on a 50 by 50 square lattice, where the lattice spacing is 200 m. We used
the weighting function W(Hi, Hj), step length and turning angle distributions found by ﬁtting to the caribou data, as described in the previous subsection. We computed the steady-state position distribution
numerically on this lattice by iterating the master equation (eqn 3)
through time until |u(x, h, t + dh)  u(x, h, t)| < 108 for every value
of x and h.
To understand how patch size and isolation aﬀect the steady-state
probability distribution, we used artiﬁcial landscapes where the lefthand half is wetland habitat and all of the right-hand half is coniferous

Mechanistic step selection models
dense forest, except for a small square of wetland, which we call the
patch. The reason for having the left-hand half of the terrain as goodquality wetland habitat is that animals need to be given a choice
between a small patch and a large contiguous area of good habitat. If
the terrain contains just a single good patch on its own in the middle of
poor habitat, then the animals will choose the good patch with high
probability even if it is small and isolated, as it is the best option available. We also used the same step length and turning angle distribution
in both habitats, so as to isolate the eﬀect of the weighting function on
space use patterns.
To investigate the patch size eﬀect, we placed the patch 12 km to the
right of the centre of the landscape and halfway up. We varied the
patch size from 016 to 784 km2. To make sure that the overall amount
of wetland and forest was the same in each artiﬁcial landscape, we
replaced a strip of wetland on the left-hand side of the landscape with
coniferous dense forest, ensuring that the area of the strip was the same
as that of the patch. To examine the isolation eﬀect, the patch was
placed at diﬀering distances to the right of the landscape centre,
between 04 and 32 km, and the patch size was kept constant at
16 km2.

Results
We identiﬁed ﬁve diﬀerent habitat types within the landscape:
wetland (WL), barren (B), dense coniferous forest (CD), open
coniferous forest (CO) and other (O). The O category consists
of water and other non-abundant resources, such as byroids,
herbs and broadleaf. For all of these habitats, the bivariate von
Mises distribution for the turning angles and the Weibull distribution for the step lengths were good ﬁts to the data (Fig. 2,
Table 1).
The best-ﬁt parameters for the weighting function
W(Hi, Hj) are shown in Table 2. This table suggests that WL
should be the most favourable habitat type, since the weight
given to moving there from other habitats is always >1. B is
close behind, being preferable to all other habitats except wetland. CO is a middling habitat, with half the weights of moving
there being >1 and the other half less. CD appears to be notably less preferable to these ﬁrst three, with O being the least
favourable of all categories.

Parameter values for the caribou step length and turning angle distributions, given in eqns (6) and (7), respectively. There is one step length
distributions for each habitat type, depending on the habitat at the start
of the step. Each turning angle distribution depends upon the habitat at
the point where the animal makes the turn. The parameter b is measured in metres and the other parameters are dimensionless. To measure the turning angle distributions, we removed any steps of <25 m, as
recommended by Hurford (2009). This required removing 84%,
226%, 553%, 89% and 47% of the angles in the B, WL, CO, CD
and O habitats, respectively.

When a small WL patch is placed in the midst of an area of
CD, in the simulated environment described in the methods
section, the average space use per unit area increases with the
size of the patch but decreases with isolation (Fig. 3), showing
the eﬀect of the weighting function on the emergent space use
patterns. However, variations in step length and turning angle
distributions also play an important role. The further an animal moves between ﬁxes, the faster it is moving on average,
which aﬀects the animal’s space use distribution. Previous
mechanistic models (Moorcroft, Lewis & Crabtree 2006;
Moorcroft & Lewis 2006) have shown that some animals, for
example coyote (Canis latrans) (Laundre & Keller 1981), will
decrease their speed of movement in more favourable habitats
and that this causes them to be observed with higher probability in better habitats than worse ones. However, in certain circumstances, some species, for example elk (Cervus elaphus)
(Anderson, Forester & Turner 2008) and black bears (Ursus
americanus) (Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2011), do not appear to
slow down in preferred habitats.
Similar to these latter examples, the caribou in our study
move fastest in habitats B and WL (Table 1), most likely
because these habitats are open and oﬀer relatively few
obstructions to movement for a large and long-legged animal
such as caribou. However, B and WL appear from the resource
weightings (Table 2) to be preferable to the other three habitats. Since the faster movement in B and WL would cause the
caribou to spend relatively less time in these habitats than
would be expected if all the step length distributions were
equal, we have competing eﬀects between ﬁdelity to these habitats due to the tendency to move into these habitats from others and lower space use caused by faster moving within B and
WL.
To examine these competing eﬀects, we computed numerically the steady state of the ME (eqn 3) in an artiﬁcial landscape consisting of just WL and CD habitat types (Fig. 4a).
These are chosen because animals move fast in WL (Table 1)
but it is the most preferential habitat according to the weighting function (Table 2), whereas animals move slowly in CD
but do not choose this habitat preferentially over WL, B or
CO. When the step length distributions for both habitats are
the same (Fig. 4b), there is a clear preference for WL. In addition to this, the probability density is highest in the largest contiguous WL area, towards the bottom-left than in the other,
smaller patches. The smallest patches of WL, in the top-left
and top-right, show the lowest probability density of all the
WL patches. This is a feature of space use that does not emerge
in the mechanistic resource selection model of Moorcroft &
Barnett (2008). In that model, the space use at any point is a
function of the resource quality at that point, so that the probability density would be of the same magnitude in all the WL
patches. Here, the preference of animals for large, contiguous
patches of high-quality habitat emerges naturally from the
underlying movement processes.
When we solve the steady state of the ME (eqn 3) in the
same landscape, but this time with diﬀerent step length distributions in diﬀerent habitat types, as given in Table 1, very different space use patterns emerge (Fig. 4c). CD is much more

The weighting W(Hi, Hj) given to travelling from one habitat Hj to another Hi, calculated from the caribou data. W(Hi, Hj) > 1 means that Hi is
preferable to Hj, whereas movement from a more preferable habitat to less means W(Hi, Hj) < 1. Consequently, W(Hj, Hj) = 1 for any Hj. Columns
denote the habitat type to which the animal is moving and rows denote the habitat from where the animal came. Each of the non-diagonal entries

preferable in this scenario than that in Fig. 4b. Particularly,
the centre of the large contiguous area of CD in the top-right
has the highest probability density of the whole landscape.
Here, the animals are far away from any WL habitat, and moving slowly, so are less likely to choose preferentially to travel to
the WL habitat than stay in the same patch. The only other
place where the probability density is as high as in the centre of
the large CD area is the small WL patch at the top-right, which
is the only patch of WL near the centre of the CD habitat. Conversely, the isolated patch of CD in the bottom-left, surrounded by a large area of WL, is relatively under used, since
animals there are always close to the preferable WL habitat, so
will tend to move from the CD patch to the surrounding WL
area.
Another interesting feature of Fig. 4c occurs along the edge
of the large patch of wetland. The probability density at the
edge is higher than anywhere else in this wetland patch, owing
to the model animals tending to move there if they end up at
the neighbouring edge of the forest. A variety of species have
been observed to choose preferentially the edge of a good habitat over the interior, for example insects such as large white
butterﬂies (Pieris brassicae) (Bergerot et al. 2013), mammals
such as pygmy tarsiers (Tarsius pumilus) (Grow, Gursky &
Duma 2013) and reptiles such as black rat snakes (elaphe
obsoleta obsoleta) (Blouin-Demers & Weatherhead 2001). Our
model may go some way to explaining the mechanisms behind
this phenomenon.

Discussion
We have constructed a mechanistic movement model, based
on a step selection function (SSF), where the movement is governed by the relative habitat quality between the start and the
end of the step. Though simple in concept, this model has complex outcomes that mimic features of space use observed in
many animal populations and that are not present in simpler
mechanistic resource selection models (Moorcroft & Barnett
2008). As well as patch usage being correlated with local habitat quality, the size and isolation of the patch also aﬀect the
space use patterns that emerge from our model. Larger patches
of good habitat are more likely to be used than smaller ones of
equal quality. Additionally, isolated patches of good habitat
inside large areas of bad habitat are less used than patches of
similar size and quality that occur near bigger, good-quality
patches. Both of these features of space use have been observed
in a wide variety of animal populations (Andren 1994) so it is
important for mechanistic models to replicate them in order to
make accurate predictions.
We generalized the SSF for a correlated random walk from
the version in Forester, Im & Rathouz (2009). The latter is a
two-step Markov process, depending upon the position of the
animal at the previous two time steps. However, in order to
construct a master equation from the SSF (Moorcroft & Barnett 2008), it is convenient to use our one-step Markov process
formulation, which depends upon the position and bearing at
the previous time-step (eqn 1). We also extended the SSF from
Forester, Im & Rathouz (2009) to enable inclusion of

information about the whole step, as done in Fortin et al.
(2005), rather than just the end of the step. A strength of the
master equation approach is that it gives the full probability
distribution as it evolves over time by solving the equation just
once. Since it is not subject to random variation, as is the case
when performing stochastic simulations, this obviates the need
for simulating multiple realizations or having to determine
how many simulations are required to give a full and accurate
picture of the model behaviour.
We have explained how to parametrize our model from
location data, using herds of caribou in Newfoundland as our
test population. This advances the study of Moorcroft & Barnett (2008), which describes purely theoretical results in a
mathematically simpliﬁed one-dimensional world, and will
enable biologists to construct mechanistic step selection models appropriate for their study species. Whilst we have focused
on resources in the present paper, our model can be readily
extended to include other environmental covariates. Such
models could be used to test hypotheses about the mechanisms
that cause observed space use patterns to emerge in the population (Moorcroft, Lewis & Crabtree 2006).
Resource selection techniques have been successfully used to
uncover the driving factors behind movement decisions for a
large variety of populations (Manly et al. 2002). However,
they cannot, by themselves, relate movement decisions to
spatially explicit, population-level patterns of usage in a nonspeculative, analytic fashion. Mechanistic models, on the other
hand, were developed precisely for this reason: to derive the
space use distribution of animals from details of the underlying
causal processes (Moorcroft & Lewis 2006). They therefore
provide a quantitative link between individual-level and population-level descriptions. This is vital for accurately building
and parametrizing models that are often constructed on the
population-level, such as those of disease spread and predator–
prey dynamics, but whose underlying processes are driven by
individual-level movement and interaction events.
Whilst the recent development of SSFs (Fortin et al. 2005;
Rhodes et al. 2005; Forester, Im & Rathouz 2009) has gone a
considerable way towards framing resource selection in the
context of the animal’s movement mechanisms, previous studies have not used the SSF to determine the utilization distribution that the SSF would predict. Here, we demonstrate how to
frame an SSF, which can take into account features of the
whole step, in such a way as to derive this utilization distribution, via construction of a master equation. This gives a framework for studying how diﬀerent environmental covariates
aﬀect space use patterns. It would therefore be possible to use
our techniques to shed light on how the various covariates
described in previous step selection studies each aﬀect the way
animals use space, thus giving insights into why certain parts
of the landscape are used more than others and ultimately
helping predict the eﬀect of possible future landscape changes
on animal space use.
Behavioural processes such as habitat selection and movement strategies are key components of animal space use, which
are considered explicitly by mechanistic models. Notwithstanding the variety in determinants that have been tested in

the past, animal behaviour can be far more complex than current mechanistic models consider. Diﬀerent foraging strategies
can lead to an increased use of a given resource; animals can
increase time spent in a patch by reducing their rate of movement within a patch or by selectively moving between patch of
a speciﬁc type (Bastille-Rousseau, Fortin & Dussault 2010) as
predicted by optimal foraging theory (Morris & Davidson
2003). The resource weighting function added to our mechanistic model allows explicit representation of such behaviour and
may be used to enable researchers to have a better understanding of the foraging strategies animals use. Our resource weighting function also naturally gives rise to real aspects of animal
space use such as large areas of good resource being used more
intensively than smaller patches, which are important features
of animal space use. This occurs by ensuring that the relative
quality of the habitat between the start and end of each step is
considered, so that the eﬀect of resource quality at a point is
propagated through the landscape by the non-local movement
decisions of the animal.
However, the weighting function and movement parameters
assume that the preference for a given resource or habitat is
constant and will not change based on the spatial context that
animals are currently in. This assumption may not hold when
habitat selection is subject to a functional response; that is, that
the selection for a speciﬁc attribute is changing with the spatial
context (Mysterud & Ims 1998; Hebblewhite & Merrill 2008).
Animals living in an area with diﬀerent availability of resources
could display diﬀerent responses based on feature availability
at multiple scales, such as within home range or inter home
range (Moreau et al. 2012). It may therefore be necessary,
when applying our mechanistic step selection model to multiple individuals ranging large areas, to assess ﬁrst the presence
of variation between and within individual behaviour based on
habitat availability. Indeed, such an assessment could be made
using our modelling framework. To apply the framework to a
single animal requires no methodological changes, but simply
applying the same techniques to the movement data for a single animal, rather than pooled data as demonstrated here.
Based on the scale of the functional response, diﬀerent parameter estimates could then be obtained for individuals experiencing heterogeneous conditions or for speciﬁc areas of the
landscape.
The purpose of this paper is not speciﬁcally to study caribou behaviour. However, the fact that we have chosen data
on this particular species to parametrize our model has
opened up various questions about caribou space use that we
hope to answer in future work. For example, why do caribou
move faster in preferred habitats? It may also be interesting to
compare habitat choice over longer temporal scales than two
hours. If it can be shown that the choices tend to be made
over longer time periods, this would suggest that the animals
are using some sort of cognitive map of the environment to
determine their movement, rather than simply making choices
on a step-by-step basis. Furthermore, temporal diﬀerences,
such as variations in night-and day-time behaviour, may have
an impact on space use, which would be worth investigating
in future.

On the more theoretical side, the results of this paper suggest
that other choices of parameter may cause the formation of
further, qualitatively diﬀerent spatial patterns. Due to the
inherent computational intensiveness of numerical simulations, rigorous and exhaustive analysis of such patterns
requires development of an analytic theory of the type of SSFs
studied here. Such analysis would also help illuminate the reasons behind the phenomena unveiled by the numerical studies
of this paper. We hope to examine these ideas in future work.
The present study deals with the eﬀect of movement processes on space use. However, interactions between animals
also have an important eﬀect in many populations, either due
to collective grouping phenomena (Couzin et al. 2002;
Camazine et al. 2003) or territorial exclusion (Lewis & Murray
1993; Giuggioli, Potts & Harris 2011). In principle, the latter
can be factored in our mechanistic modelling framework by
including a term into our SSF (eqn 2) that excludes movement
by animals into places recently occupied by individuals from a
neighbouring group, ﬂock or pack. Simulation analysis of similar systems, which account for territorial behaviour but not
resource selection (Giuggioli, Potts & Harris 2011; Potts, Harris & Giuggioli 2012, 2013), shows that the resulting territories
are not ﬁxed in space. Therefore, including territorial interactions would require that the boundary, Ω, in the ME (eqn 3)
were replaced by one that varies in time. Whilst this is not necessary for the caribou population modelled here, as they do
not form territories, for many animals, this is an important
consideration in linking individual mechanisms to the population patterns. We hope to include this in future studies.
