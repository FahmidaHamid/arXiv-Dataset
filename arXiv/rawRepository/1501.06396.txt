Abstract
Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which assay more than a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals, have been widely used to identify genetic risk
variants for complex diseases. However, most of the variants that have been identified contribute relatively
small increments of risk and only explain a small portion of the genetic variation in complex diseases. This
is the so-called missing heritability problem. Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically related, meaning these diseases share common genetic risk variants. Therefore, exploring the genetic
correlations across multiple related studies could be a promising strategy for removing spurious associations
and identifying underlying genetic risk variants, and thereby uncovering the mystery of missing heritability
in complex diseases.
Results: We present a general and robust method to identify genetic patterns from multiple large-scale
genomic datasets. We treat the summary statistics as a matrix and demonstrate that genetic patterns will
form a low-rank matrix plus a sparse component. Hence, we formulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem, where we aim to discover risk variants shared by multiple diseases/traits and those for each
individual disease/trait. We propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an efficient algorithm
to solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our method using both synthesized datasets and
real datasets. The experimental results show that our method can successfully reconstruct both the shared
and the individual genetic patterns from summary statistics and achieve better performance compared with
alternative methods under a wide range of scenarios.

Introduction
Many common human diseases, such as type-1 and type-2 diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, and prostate

cancer, are influenced by several genetic and environmental factors. Scientists and public health officials have
great interests to find genetic patterns associated with complex diseases, not only to advance our understanding
of multi-gene disorders, but also to provide more insights into complex diseases. Disease association studies
have provided substantial evidence for supporting that complex diseases originate in disorders of multiple
genes [1, 2]. Nevertheless, until recently the full-coverage identification of the genetic variants contributing to
complex diseases has been staggering and difficult.
After the completion of the Human Genome Project [3, 4] and the initiation of the International HapMap
Project [5], interest has focused on genome-wide association studies (GWASs), in which the goal is to identify
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with complex diseases (such as diabetes) or traits
(such as human height). As of Dec. 2014, more than 15, 000 SNPs have been reported to be associated with at
least one disease/trait at the genome-wide significance level (P -value≤ 5 × 10−8 ) [6]. However, most of the
findings only explain a small portion of the genetic contributions to complex diseases. For example, all of the
18 SNPs identified in type 2 diabetes (T2D) only account for about 6% of the inherited risk [7]. There is still

2

a large portion of disease/trait heritability that remains unexplained. This is the so-called missing heritability
problem [7, 8], which is often used to denote the gap between the expected heritability of many common
diseases, as estimated by family and twin studies, and the overall additive heritability obtained by accumulating
the effects of all of the SNPs that have been found to be significantly associated with these conditions.
A recent study [9] has suggested that most of the heritability is not missing but can be explained by the
effects of many genetic variants, with each variant probably contributing a weak effect. However, finding
variants with small effects is very challenging in computation because the traditional single-locus based test
cannot identify such variants and the number of groups of multiple variants to be investigated in GWAS is
astronomical. In addition, in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings of GWAS, many irrelevant
variants tend to have high sample correlations due to randomness, which makes GWAS prone to false scientific
discoveries. To solve the missing heritability problem, the large sample size is required, but such a requirement
is usually beyond the capacity of a single GWAS, as the sample recruitment is expensive and time consuming.
Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically related [10, 11, 12, 13], meaning that
these diseases share common genetic risk variants. This suggests that an integrative analysis of related genomic
data could be a promising strategy for removing spurious associations and identifying risk genetic variants
with small effects, and thus finding the missing heritability of complex diseases. As high-throughput data
acquisition becomes popular in biomedical research, new computational methods for large-scale data analysis
become more and more important.
When analyzing genomic data from multiple related studies, the ideal scenario is for the individual-level
data to be available for all of the included studies, but this may be difficult to achieve due to restrictions on
sharing individual-level data. In fact, summary data (mostly P -values or z-scores) are more frequently shared.
To identify significant SNPs shared by all of the included studies, the commonly used statistical approach is
to combine P -values using Fisher’s method [14]. [15] generalized Fisher’s method to include weights when
combining P -values. [16] suggested using the inverse normal transformation and Mosteller and [17] further
generalized Stouffer’s method by including weight when combining z-scores. There are two issues in such
traditional statistical approaches. First, one small P -value can overwhelm many large P -values and dominate
the test statistic. In a high-dimensional and low-sample size settings, many irrelevant variants tend to have
high significance due to randomness, which may cause wrong statistical inferences. Second, the information
about genetic correlations between SNPs in the original data is completely lost after combining P -values.
This information is necessary for understanding the genetic architecture of complex diseases because common
complex diseases are associated with multiple genetic variants.
To identify shared genetic structures across multiple related studies, one feasible approach is to conduct a
biclustering analysis on a matrix of summary statistics, in which the rows represent studies and the columns
represent genetic variants, to simultaneously group studies and genetic variants. Many biclustering methods
have been proposed and some comprehensive reviews of biclustering methods can be found in [18], [19], and
[20]. However, the traditional biclustering methods do not perform well on genomic data because genomic data
3

is high dimensional and its most genetic variants are irrelevant. To obtain sparse and interpretable biclusters,
a novel statistical approach, sparseBC, is recently proposed, which adopts an l1 penalty to the means of the
biclusters [21]. A big drawback of sparseBC is that it does not allow for overlapping biclusters, which limits
its application in genomic data analysis because the shared genetic patterns in GWASs may be very complex.
Furthermore, in genomic data, besides the shared genetic structure, each disease/trait owns some distinct genetic
variants. The typical biclustering model may treat them as noises and discard them.
In this paper, we introduce a new method to identify genetic patterns in high dimensional genomic data.
Our method possesses several advantages over existing works. First, our method admits a single model to detect
both shared and individual genetic patterns among multiple studies. Second, our method employs two tuning
parameters that control the size of the shared genetic pattern and the numbers of individual signals. The choices
of these parameters have the solid theoretical support. Third, our method produces the unique global minimizer
to a convex problem, which means that the solution is always stable.
To demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct comparison experiments using both
synthesized datasets and real datasets. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing
methods in many settings. A large dataset containing 32 GWASs is also analyzed to demonstrate the advantage
of our method. Specifically, we propose the convex formulation, the algorithm, and the parameter selection in
Section 2. Simulation studies and real data analysis are presented in Section 3. We conclude the paper with
some discussions in Section 4.

2.1

Methods
Formulation
Mathematically, the summary statistics from multiple related studies can be expressed as a matrix D ∈

Rn×p , where each entry dij is a z-score (if only P -values are available, we can transform them into z-scores),
and n and p are the numbers of studies and SNPs, respectively. Our goal is to (1) detect shared genetic patterns
across studies, which can be represented as sparse biclusters in this matrix and (2) detect individual genetic
variants for each study, which we assume are randomly distributed and sparse. Since the sparsity of biclusters
in a matrix indicates a low-rank property (please see examples in simulation studies), the problem of identifying
these two types of genetic patterns can be treated as a problem of recovering a low-rank component X and a
sparse component E from the input data D. Our proposed approach is based on the assumed sparsity of genetic
patterns because in large-scale genomic data, most genetic variants are irrelevant.
We propose to use the following decomposition model to detect genetic patterns from noisy input:
D = X + E + ,

(1)

where X is a low-rank component, E is a sparse component, and  is a noise component. In GWAS data
analysis, the low-rank component corresponds to the causal SNPs that are shared by several diseases/traits. The
4

sparse component corresponds to the causal SNPs that affect one specific disease/trait. The noise component
corresponds to the measurement error, which is often modeled by i.i.d. Gaussian distribution with a zero mean.
Naturally, to achieve the decomposition, the following minimization problem is considered:
min

X,E,

1
kk2F + αrank (X) + βkEk0
2

s.t. D = X + E + ,
where kkF =

qP

2
i,j ij

(2)

is the Frobenious norm and kEk0 is the `0 -norm that counts the number of nonzero

values in E. The solution to Eq.(2) will give a penalized maximum likelihood estimate with respect to the
variables X, E, .
However, the proposed model in Eq.(2) is intractable and NP-hard. Thus, in order to effectively recover X
and E, we use the convex relaxation to replace the rank (·) by the nuclear norm and the `0 -norm by the `1 -norm.
P
Here, the nuclear norm is defined as kXk∗ = ri=1 σi , where σ1 , · · · , σr are the singular values of X. It is
the tightest convex surrogate to the rank operator [22] and has been widely used for low-rank matrix recovery
P
[23]. The `1 -norm is defined as kXk1 = i,j |Xij |. The `1 relaxation has proven to be a powerful technique
for sparse signal recovery [24].
Finally, instead of directly solving Eq.(2), we solve the following problem,
F(X, E) = min
X,E

1
kD − X − Ek2F + αkXk∗ + βkEk1 .

(3)

It is easy to prove that Eq.(3) is a convex problem and therefore, the global optimal solution is unique. We
will introduce the algorithm to solve this optimization problem in the next subsection.

Algorithm
The optimization problem of Eq.(3) can be solved by alternatively solving the following two sub-problems

until convergence:
X̂ ← arg min F(X, Ê)

The theoretical proof for the convergence can be found in [25].

which becomes a nuclear-norm regularized least-squares problem and has the following closed-form solution

2.3

Parameter selection
There are two parameters in our model, which can be estimated properly via the analysis of the size of the

input matrix (n, p) and the standard variation of the noise σ [23, 27].
The relative weight λ = β/α balances the two terms in αkXk∗ + βkEk1 and consequently controls the
√
rank of X and the sparsity of E. [23] has proved that λ = 1/ m gives a large probability of recovering X and
E under their assumed conditions and stated that this value can be adjusted slightly to obtain the best results
in specific applications. Here, m is the larger dimension of the input matrix. In our problem, m = p, i.e. the
number of SNPs. However, on real datasets, the shared SNPs rarely form a perfectly low-rank matrix, and we
√
use β = 2α/ p to keep sufficient variations in X.
The parameter α serves as a threshold in the SVT step in Eq.(8). It should be large enough to threshold out
√
√
the noise but not too large to over-shrink the signal [27]. A proper value is α = ( n + p)σ, which is the

6

expected `2 -norm of a n × p random matrix with entries sampled from N (0, σ 2 ). As SNPs are sparse in the
data, we can estimate σ from the data by the median-absolute-deviation estimator [28]
σ̂ = 1.48 median {|D − median(D)|} .

RESULTS

3.1

Simulation studies
We first compare the performance of our method under four simulation studies, with three existing bi-

clustering methods: sparseBC (sparse biclustering) [21], LAS [29] and SSVD [30]. Since biclustering methods
search for sample-variable associations in the form of distinguished submatrices of the data matrix, we consider
the entry (i, j) that belongs to one of the resulting biclusters which meet a predefined criterion as the reported
association. Specially, for sparse biclustering method, we use the parameters that have been mentioned in [21],
and the entries in the clusters which satisfy a preselected cutoff are recognized as the final result. For LAS, we
use the default settings. For SSVD that uses a variant of singular value decomposition to find biclusters, we
try different setting of parameters and report the best one as its result. LAS and SSVD can detect overlapping
biclusters but sometimes they report the entire matrix as one bicluster. Thus, for both LAS and SSVD, the
biclusters that contain the entire matrix are discarded. For our method, the parameters are selected as stated in
Section 2. Then we use a threshold T to determine whether the entries (i, j) of matrix is reported as the result
or not by comparing the value of X(i, j) and E(i, j) with T .
We evaluate each method in the term of F 1-score, which can be calculated as following:

precision =

recall =

tp
,
tp + f p

(12)

tp
,
tp + f n

F 1-score =

(13)

2 ∗ precision ∗ recall
,
precision + recall

(14)

where tp and f p denote the number of true positives and false positives, respectively, and f n denotes the
number of false negatives.
3.1.1

Simulation settings

We adopt four patterns (each in one simulation study) illustrated in Figure 1 to generate synthetic data.
• Pattern 1 adopts a case from [30], which generated a rank-1 true signal matrix. Let M = du1 v1T
be a 100 × 50 matrix with d = 50, vˆ1 = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, r(2, 17), r(0, 75)], uˆ1 = [10, −10, 8,
−8, 5, −5, r(−3, 5), r(0, 34)]T , u1 = uˆ1 /kuˆ1 k2 , and v1 = vˆ1 /kvˆ1 k2 , where r(a, b) denotes a vector of
length b with all entries equal a. This case simulates the shared causal SNPs among several studies.

Figure 1: Four scenarios in our simulation study. Pattern 1 contains a rank-1 component representing one
bicluster. Pattern 2 adds some sparse signals in Pattern 1. Pattern 3 contains a rank-2 component representing
two overlapped biclusters. Pattern 4 contains sparse signal in addition to overlapped biclusters.

8

• Pattern 2 extends Pattern 1 by adding some sparse signals. That is, we generate a sparse component E,
whose entries are independently distributed, each taking on value 0 with probability 1 − ps , and value 6
with probability ps = 0.01.
• Pattern 3 adopts the case from [21], which generated two overlapping biclusters. Let M = d(u1 v1T +
u2 v2T ) be a 100×50 matrix with d = 50, u1 and v1 as defined in simulation 1, uˆ2 = [r(0, 13), 10, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, r(2, 17), r(0, 62)], vˆ2 = [r(0, 9), 10, −9, 8, −7, 6, −5, r(4, 5), r(−3, 5), r(0, 25)]T , u2 = uˆ2 /kuˆ2 k2 ,
and v2 = vˆ2 /kvˆ2 k2 .
• Pattern 4 extends Pattern 3 by adding some sparse signals following the same way as Pattern 2.
3.1.2

Data generation

Given a specific pattern mentioned above, we first generate the data matrix. To simulate the real situation,
we randomly shuffle the rows and the columns. Next, we add Gaussian noise  ∼ N (0, 1) to each item. Figure
2 illustrates the groundtruth data and the generated data. For each generated data matrix, we also compute the
signal to noise ratio (SNR). To illustrate how the methods perform for the data with different SNRs, we further
scale down the ground true signal by dividing the original values by 1.2 and 1.5, respectively.
3.1.3

Simulation results

The results of four simulation studies are shown in Figure 3. We use ‘low-rank’ to represent our method as
our model is to find biclusters via a low-rank approximation. The details of the simulation results can be found
in the supplementary materials. In general, our proposed method achieves comparable performance in the first
and third simulation studies and performs better than other three methods in the second and fourth simulation
studies. This is because the classical biclustering methods suffer from several limitations, such as missing
some entries for overlapped biclusters and the inability to identify the disease/trait-specific entries. Figure 4
shows one result in the fourth pattern. Our proposed method can successfully recover a low-rank component
and a sparse component from raw data. In the first simulation, the F 1-scores of sparse biclustering method
and SSVD method almost get to 1. The reason why our method performs worse is that we use the default
parameters which are not best fit for this simulation set-up. When adjusting the parameters, our method can
also get a high F 1-score. Furthermore, we can observe from Figure 3 that our method always perform equally
well in terms of both precision and recall while the other three methods often favor precision against recall. In
the large-scale data analysis, the conservative method with high precision and low recall may not be suitable
for new discoveries because most signals are irrelevant. For such situations, our method has a clear advantage
over competitors.

• 7 inflammatory bowel disease data.

The details of the data sets including the references and the web link for downloading the data can be found
in the supplementary materials. Since each study reports different SNPs, we take the SNPs that are reported
by at least 28 diseases/traits and obtain their P -values and impute the missing ones. Finally, we get a P -value
matrix P ∈ R466423×32 for these 32 diseases/traits. Next, we convert the P -value matrix to the z-score matrix
Z ∈ R466423×32 . We analyze this data set using our method on a desktop PC with 2.40GHz CPU and 4GB
RAM. The running time of our method on 32 GWASs data sets is only 152.1s. The three alterative methods
investigated in this work cannot be applied due to the large size of the data.
The experiment results are given in Figure 5. The shared causal SNPs are presented in the low-rank component and individual-specific SNPs are shown in the sparse component. We take the first three right singular
vectors of the recovered low-rank matrix and use them as the coordinate of each study in Figure 6. From Figure
6, it is clear to see that 3 clusters are recovered from 32 diseases/traits:
• 2 social science studies (edu years and college);
• diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP);
• total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (TC and LDL).
The diseases/traits in each cluster are highly relevant with each other. We compare the identified causal
SNPs by our method on 32 GWAS data with some previous findings. For 3 pairs of diseases/traits that are
clustered together, we mainly investigate the shared SNPs that are identified by our method. For two social
science related data, our method has detected SNP rs3789044, SNP rs12046747, and SNP rs12853561, which
are mapped to genes LRRN2 and STK24, respectively. These were reported in the original article [31] because
they have significant P -values (the details are provided in the supplementary materials). However, besides
those SNPs with significant P -values, our method has also identified some locus with moderate P -values. SNP
rs2532269, whose original P -values are 1.01 × 10−4 in edu years data and 1.11 × 10−4 in college data, is
detected as a causal SNP by our method. This SNP was previously reported (P -value = 2 × 10−11 ) [32] and

mapped to the gene KIAA1267. This gene is highly connected with Koolen-De Vries syndrome. Koolen-De
Vries syndrome is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, friendly demeanor,
and highly distinctive facial features, including tall, broad forehead, long face, upslanting palpebral fissures,
epicanthal folds, tubular nose with bulbous nasal tip, and large ears [33].
For diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure, the identified SNPs in our experiment are also
connected with some previously published genes, such as ULK4, FGF5 and C10orf107 [34]. Similarly, some
additional locus are identified by the low-rank component. SNP rs4986172 (original P -values in SBP data and
DBP data are 3.09 × 10−5 and 0.0172, respectively), located in the gene ACBD4, is detected by the low-rank
component. This gene has been associated with high blood pressure in [35].
To illustrate the power of our method in identifying the causal SNPs that do not shared by several diseases/traits, we take the result of bipolar disorder as an example. The SNPs in the result of bipolar disorder
can be matched to ANK3, CACNA1C, SYNE1 and PBRM1, which have been confirmed to be associated with
bipolar disorder [36]. The detailed results of other diseases/traits can be found in the supplementary materials.
Clearly, the experiment results show that not only can our method recognize SNPs with small P -values, but
also detect those SNPs with moderate or weak P -values.

Discussion
Finding weak-effect variants to explain the missing heritability of complex diseases is a challenging task

and bottlenecked by the available sample size of GWAS. Based on the fact that related diseases/traits tend to
co-occur, discovering shared genetic components among related studies becomes a popular way to address this
issue. In the last few years, hundreds of GWASs have been carried out. Therefore, it is timely to systematically
investigate GWAS data sets to find those shared patterns for comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases/traits. In this work, we present a novel method for exploring the genetic patterns of
complex diseases. We assume that causal SNPs can be divided into two categories: SNPs shared by multiple
diseases/traits and SNPs for individual disease/trait. Thus, by modeling the problem as recovering a low-rank
component and a sparse component from a noise matrix, we formulate it as a convex optimization problem. To
demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct several simulation studies under different
settings. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms three alternative methods in many settings. In the real data studies, we collect 32 large-scale GWAS data sets. We have successively analyzed these
data sets via our proposed method and discovered some interesting shared genetic patterns. Many identified
variants have been confirmed by other works. To conclude, our proposed method not only possesses a better
power than related methods but also provides easily interpretable results for better understanding shared genetic
architectures of complex diseases/trais.

In this work, we mainly focus on the analysis of summary statistics. With the development of new technology, more and more supplementary information, such as functional annotation data, structural data, and
biochemical data, can be quickly obtained. In the future work, we will integrate these information in our
method to increase the statistical power.
