Abstract

miRNA and RNAi, up to a hundred nucleotides
for ribozymes, and to a few thousands for ribosomal RNA constituting the ribosome together with
proteins. In all their diversity these molecule share
the common feature of adopting a specific threedimensional structure to be functional, in the same
way proteins must adopt a well defined 3D shape
to be able to perform their biological activity, posing the question of RNA folding, that is understanding how an RNA linear molecule adopts its
characteristic 3D structure. RNA functionality depends crucially on their equilibrium structures and
their dynamical behavior, 1,2 with distinct active
conformations biologically active under different
conditions. 3
With most of the DNA identified as "noncoding", therefore possibly coding for RNA
molecules, being able to determine RNA structures from sequences is essential for our understanding of the cellular machinery. However,
obtaining high-resolution 3D structures through
X-ray crystallography and NMR is a challenging
task as it is proven by the small number of resolved structures in the Nucleic Acids Data Bank
(NDB) and by the scarcity of structures with substantially different architectures. Low-resolution
techniques, such as SAXS and Cryo-EM, allow for
easier access to the raw data, but require extensive
modelling to propose a well-resolved structure.
Computational methods have recently been de-

HiRE-RNA is a simplified, coarse-grained RNA
model for the prediction of equilibrium configurations, dynamics and thermodynamics. Using a
reduced set of particles and detailed interactions
accounting for base-pairing and stacking we show
that non-canonical and multiple base interactions
are necessary to capture the full physical behavior
of complex RNAs. In this paper we give a full account of the model and we present results on the
folding, stability and free energy surfaces of 16
systems with 12 to 76 nucleotides of increasingly
complex architectures, ranging from monomers to
dimers, using a total of 850µs simulation time.
RNA molecules are essential cellular machines
performing a wide variety of functions for which
a specific three-dimensional structure is required.
Aside for their well known roles of genetic information carrier (mRNA) and amino acid recruiter (tRNA), they play a wide range of functions, from regulating gene expression through
post-transcriptional process (miRNA) and gene silencing (RNAi), to catalytic activities (ribozymes).
Their sizes vary from a few dozen nucleotides for

veloped to complement experimental information
in the task of predicting 3D structures, following different strategies. Bioinformatic algorithms
based on sequence homology, fragment assembly and secondary structure predictions 4–9 are successful for systems similar to those already present
in structural databases. They provide a static view
of the structure and, sometimes, partial thermodynamical information based on secondary structure
predictions, but they are not suited for the study
of the dynamical and of the global thermodynamical properties of RNA in three dimensions. These
methods base much of their results on the prediction of a secondary structure first, through more or
less refined 2D prediction algorithms. 10–12 However, RNA structures are often intricate, giving
rise to complex pseudoknots, triple or quadruple
base pairings, non-canonical (non Watson-Crick)
pairings involving the base’s sugar and Hoogsteen
edges, 13 which are not accounted for in secondary
structure prediction methods, developed to address
nested structures (tree-like structures) or simple
pseudoknots.
Physical models, considering the interactions of
the system’s particles in three-dimensions, are better suited to study RNA structure in all of their
complexity. As opposed to secondary structure
prediction methods, physical models do not have
a specific term for pseudoknot formation. A pseudoknot results from the minimization of the free
energy and is not encoded as a separate term in the
potential energy: pseudoknots arise from a different organization of base pairings, but the interactions are the same that go into generating a hairpin
or any nested structure.
All-atom simulations have successfully folded
RNA of 12 nucleotides (nt), 14–16 but are limited
to small systems even when adopting an implicit
solvent representation. 17 Unfolding atomistic simulations have been performed on structures up to
about 40 nt. 18 To overcome the limitations imposed by the size of the molecule, and to be able
to follow the large scale rearrangements occurring in folding, one can resort to a simplification
of the system through coarse-graining. The challenge of this approach is to design a force-field
able to capture all the subtle interactions giving
rise to folding, while maintaining a sufficiently
simple description of the system for efficient simu-

lation. Interesting insights on folding mechanisms
of structures such as the 49 nt telomerase pseudoknot 19 were obtained using Go-like potentials,
allowing the formation of native interactions only.
These simulations were performed with a strong
bias toward the already known experimental structure, and even though they provide important information on the overall folding process, they are
not suited for the prediction of the structure associated to a given sequence, nor for the study
of the realm of possible states that the molecule
might explore in its life. Several ab initio coarsegrained models, with average interactions between
bases and chain connectivity are able to drive the
formation of small helical stems and helix, but
have limited success for more intricate 3D structures. 20–25 Any model aimed at predicting largescale 3D rearrangements needs to give an accurate
description of base-pairing and stacking, including
the formation of non-canonical pairs and simultaneous pairings of three or four bases. 26 However
designing a force field properly accounting for
these interactions is a challenging task as shown by
the difficulties of otherwise very successful models. For atomistic simulations Garcia had to reparameterize the AMBER force field to model correctly three tetraloops of 12 nucleotides. 14 The
3D ab initio FARFAR procedure, close in spirit
to the ROSETTA approach used for proteins, and
based on sampling using a coarse-grained model
followed by full-atom refinement, cannot reproduce any of the hydrogen bonds or stacking patterns within the UUGC tetraloop 27 and is of limited accuracy for RNAs of 12 to 20 nucleotides in
spite of including non-canonical pairings.
HiRE-RNA 28,29 is an effective theory developed to fold any RNA architecture and study
the structural dynamics and thermodynamics of
RNA molecules. Through the representation of
6 or 7 beads per nucleotide (figure 1), HiRERNA v3 force field, with specifically designed energy terms for stacking and base-pairing, including non-canonical and multiple pairs, points to
the essential physics involved in folding. Similar to other coarse-grained models, two previous
versions of HiRE-RNA, with a less sophisticated
force field in the treatment of the bases, were useful to describe small helical stems and duplexes,
but failed to capture the physics of more com2

plex molecules. The latest version of the model,
HiRE-RNA v3, allows folding of complex systems
such as multiple helices and pseudoknots, and provides realistic energy landscapes. In contrast to
other structure prediction methods such as iFoldRNA, 20 RNA2D3D 30 and MC-Fold/MC-Sym, 5
which are limited to the study of one single RNA
chain, HiRE-RNA can be used to study duplexes,
quadruplexes and any multiplexes.
We present here the completely redesigned force
field of HiRE-RNA v3 and results on 16 systems
spanning from 12 to 76 nucleotides in length, for a
total simulation time of 856 microseconds, including several pseudoknots and systems with complex topologies. For these molecules our model
allows to extract thermodynamic information and
folding pathways in agreement with experimental
data. Our work highlights the importance of an
accurate description of base-pairing in the physical theory, including the plurality of possible basepairs, in order to address all the fine structural details playing a key role in the folding process.

and G, and B1-CY-CA for bases C and U. Stacking occurs when two particles are close to an equilibrium distance rst , when the normal vectors are

Base-pairing occurs when two bases are side by

the hydrogen bonds. We define the base-pairing
potential, Ebp , as the product of Ebp−pl , assuring
planarity, and of Ebp−hb assuring the correct geometry of the interacting particles. Planarity is imposed by requiring that all particles of one base lie

of 22 interactions is rather arbitrary and can be
extended to any number of interactions as long
as they are sufficiently distinct in interaction centers. The pairs included in HiRE-RNA v3 have
been chosen based on their abundance in the NDB,
making sure to have at least two or three representative for each letter pair. For some letter pairs we
can account for two distinct interaction sites occurring between the same sides at different geometric
centers (see cWW A·C pairs). For any given letter pair we consider all possible base-pairs from
our list by adding over all possible Ehb terms. Because of the narrow distance dependence of Ehb
and of the excluded volumes of the beads, effectively, there can only be three interaction centers

the corresponding PDB structure, when this exists.
From this database, we have chosen one an equal
number of representative structures for each populated topology, to form a training set of 20 RNAs
used to optimize parameters through a genetic algorithm. 37 For each native structure we first generate an ensemble of decoys varying in RMSD
and number of native contact to cover the four
possible scenarios of low-RMSD/high native BP,
low-RMSD/low native BP, high-RMSD/high native BP and high-RMSD/low native BP. The algorithm then selects parameters maximizing the energy difference between native configurations and
decoys. Parameters obtained with this procedure
were then tested through long MD simulations on
systems of various sizes and showed a significant
improvement over the previous parameters calibrated by hand both on folding predictions and on
stability tests. The new parameters were validated
on several molecules not included in the training
set, in their ability to fold small hairpins and to
give the correct melting temperatures for duplexes.

Results

Table 1 reports the folding and stability results on
16 topologically different RNA molecules of 12
to 76 nts. For each system we performed either
Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations at 300 K,
Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD),
64 replicas with temperatures from 200 K to 400
K and 500-1200 ns per replica, or Simulated Tempering (ST) with temperatures from 300 K to 500
K, all with an integration time-step of 4 fs and
a Langevin thermostat. 38 For analysis, we monitored native base pairs and root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the native structure using all
particles.
With HiRE-RNA v3 we have been able to fold
13 structures from fully extended configurations
within a few RMSD from the experimental structure and reproducing most of the native basepairing network. To test the extent of the validity
of our force field, we also performed long MD stability simulations on three systems for which complete folding from fully extended states is at the

The model has geometric parameters whose

overall energetic parameters, representing the relative weights of the different interaction terms,
which are subject to an optimization procedure.
We used the concepts of RNA graphs to build
a structure database rich in different topologies
since this descriptor captures well the different overall organization of the molecule’s structure. 34,35 Through “dual graphs” (figure 3), the

structural ions or of modified bases which we can’t
account for in our model at this stage. We have analyzed G-quadruplexes, found on telomeres and of
importance for cancer regulations, bound to several intercalating ions, and two tRNAs with both
modified bases and structural ions. Despite the
absence of specific interactions for structural ions
and modified bases, the three systems do not depart significantly from their NMR structures over
several hundred nanoseconds, the quadruplex remaining at 4.0Å for over 3µs, and the two tRNA
of 73 and 76 nts remaining at 8.0Å, with the native
architecture preserved and most native base pairs
formed (figure 4).

to atomistic approaches, we first examined three

accuracy (1RNG: Garcia 3.1 Å vs. 2.7Å here,

cia 0.8 vs. 2.0 A here), but with a much smaller
computational cost (only 60 CPU hours per run,
for 3 microseconds of simulated time). Importantly for statistics, each ST simulation displays
many folding/unfolding events. The importance
of understanding tetraloop formation is reported in
a recent article by Wales’ group 17 where the discrete path sampling method was used to determine
the folding mechanisms and kinetics of three RNA
tetraloops.

ders the ground state more entropically accessible,
lowering the melting temperature. By shifting the
temperature of one of the two curves to superpose
the melting peaks we can observe that the low and
high temperature behavior of the two systems is
the same, but that the lowest peak for the WC-only
system is narrower and taller than the corresponding peak for the full base-pairing set, indicating a
stiffer transition when non-canonical parings are
turned off. The computed average energies at all
temperatures are the same within error bars, while
the fluctuation behavior of the two system is different, with the system including non-canonical pairs
subject to larger fluctuations than the system with
WC only interactions.
Despite the fact that our model is not explicitly optimized on thermodynamic data, the melting
temperatures of the pseudoknot of 2G1W (lower
temperature peak) estimated at 320K and 310K using WC-only and all pairs respectively, are in good
semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental
value of 329K at 50 mM NaCl. 39 Given our model
does not explicitly include ions nor water, we don’t
expect at this stage to have a precise quantitative correspondence between computed and experimental melting temperatures, but to be able to predict general features.
The presence of two peaks in the specific heat
curve is in good agreement with the experimental observations on the MMTV pseudoknot, 42 a
32-nt RNA with the same topology as 2G1W, and
seems to be a common feature of pseudoknot folding, where melting of two separate stems is involved. The specific heat curve of 1L2X also displays two peaks (figure 6). 1L2X is a pseudo-knot
composed of a longer stem (8 base pairs) and a
shorter stem (3 base pairs). The lower-temperature
peak at 330K (Tm1 ) corresponds to melting of the
shorter stem and the higher-temperature peak at
370K (Tm2 ) corresponds to complete unfolding.
As expected, Tm1 is higher than the corresponding
melting temperature of 2G1W (320 K) given the
higher number of base pairs breaking in the melting transition in 1L2X over 2G1W. The calculated
difference between Tm1 and Tm2 of 40 K is consistent with experimental observations for similar
pseudoknots for which differences Tm2 − Tm1 measured by UV absorbance was reported to be of 20
K, 24 K and 35 K (MMTV pseudoknot, wild-type

Small pseudoknots

Predicting small pseudoknots is particularly challenging because these molecules fold back on
themselves forming tight bends, stabilized extensively by stacking interactions beside basepairings. While our v1 and v2 models lacked
a detailed stacking term and could not predict
such structures, HiRE-RNA v3 can fold the 22 nt
2G1W 39 and 28 nt 1L2X 40 pseudoknots with the
experimental fold as the most stable structure at
300 K.
To study the impact of non-canonical base pairing on the system’s behavior, for 2G1W we also
performed simulations considering only base pairs
on the WC side of the base (red and green basepairs in figure 2). While the molecule is still
able to reach the native state, the absence of noncanonical pairs involving Hoogsteen and Sugar
edges alters the energy landscape (figure 5 B).
With the full set of base pairs more states are
populated as partial intermediates creating a continuous path from misfolded to folded state. Physically, this is an important difference as it allows
the molecule to more easily interconvert between
different states compared to when only WC base
pairs are considered. This aspect is crucial for
RNAs that are known to adopt alternative architectures at various stages of their biological activity. The importance of including non-canonical
pairs manifests also in thermodynamics. From our
REMD simulations, the estimated melting temperature of the model with all possible pairs is
lower than that of the model including only WC
base pairs (Figure 5 C). This is indeed expected as
the presence of non-canonical pairs opens to the
possibility of new folding pathways, absent when
only canonical base-pairs are considered, and ren7

considering the full set of base-pairs a plurality of partially folded/misfolded states is also present. C:

similar behavior, but melting temperatures are lower when non-canonical pairs are considered. Cv curves

WC helix and an A-rich dangling strand inserting into the WC helix groove and forming several
stacked triplets. Overall, 22 base pairs, canonical and non-canonical, stabilize the native structure. In the simulation we can distinguish a short
phase to form the WC helix, and a longer phase in

Triple helix pseudoknot

We then studied larger and more complex systems. Starting from fully extended conformations,
REMD simulations were able to fold the triple
helix of the pseudoknot of the human telomerase

which the other contacts form, generating the full
triple helix (figure 7). After 1.2µs REMD time,
a structure was reached with an RMSD of 4.3Å,
stabilized by 17 native base pairs (Figure 8: N).
To our knowledge this is the first time anyone has
folded an RNA of such complexity solely from the
sequence, an achievement possible only if the relevant physics is correctly taken into account by the
model.
Although individual ST and REMD individual
trajectories rapidly swap temperatures and the observed pathways may not be identical to the pathways observed at constant temperature, significant
insights can be obtained from the many unfolding/folding events we can observe in enhanced
sampling simulations. We have therefore further analyzed the folding path of the triple helix 2K96 (figure 8). In the NDB structure of
2K96, the paired regions are the following: 16 paired with 24-29 (H1), 15-23 paired with 3747 (H2) and 6-10 paired with 36-40 (H3). Notice that there is an overlap of two paired regions
with bases 37, 38, 39 and 40 forming triple contacts. In REMD simulations we observe three
separate folding steps corresponding to the successive formation of each one of the stems (H1red first, H2-green second, H3-light blue third),
with different time scales involved. The system
can remain trapped in misfolded states with structures exhibiting base-pairings different from native
(T1 and T2). Our folding path (H1 → H1+H2
→ N) is in agreement with experimental studies
on 2K96. 45 Based on UV melting curves, it was
proposed that the three melting transitions of increasing temperature correlate with the loss of tertiary structure, followed by melting of the AU rich
stem 2, and eventually loss of the structure in GC rich stem 1. Our results are also in agreement
with results obtained by Langevin simulations and
a coarse-grained model with Go-like properties
(TIS), where the formation of the stems and the
assembly mechanisms of RNA pseudoknots are
determined by the stabilities of constituent secondary structures: if the secondary structural elements have comparable stability, then there are
multiple routes to the native state, otherwise there
is one dominant path. 46 In the case of 2K96, H1
consists of G·C WC interactions, more stabilizing
than the A·U interactions of H2. Our predictions

on the folding pathway extend those of the Go-like
model study which did not take into account the
formation of non-canonical and triple pairings.
Given the challenges of folding a triple helix, for
2K96 we performed an extensive comparison of
our results with seven secondary structure prediction methods available on-line all allowing formation of pseudoknots. We tested the widely used

considered to be the best performing algorithms
thus far, pknot, 12 pKiss 50 and CyloFold. 51 As it
can be seen on figure 9 none of these methods predicts the triple helix. MCFold predicts two disjoint hairpins and all other methods, considering
the optimal solution or suboptimal solutions, predict the simple pseudoknot (pseudoknot H), when
explicitly instructed to look for a pseudoknot. In
principle, Vfold2D can predict structures including base triplets, but it does not give the correct
result for 2K96 despite the fact that it was shown
to be able to produce the correct 2D structure, including triple contacts, for a similar system. 52

Large systems

Despite the already substantial reduction in degrees of freedom of our theory, folding large structures remains challenging because of the long
times needed for accurate sampling. Folding times
can be reduced by adding partial experimental information such as a few base-pairs from NMR or
SHAPE. 53 This is the strategy we adopted for the
riboswitch 1Y26 of 76 nt starting from a fully extended state. 54 In its NMR state with an adenine
ligand, 1Y26 adopts a Y shape with the two upper stems binding through kissing loops. Imposing
three base pairs restraints (one WC pair on each
helix) taken from VFold2D predictions, both simple MD (at 300K) and REMD recover the overall
organization of the kissing loops, with an RMSD
of 7-8Å(Figure 10). The major discrepancy between our predicted and the NMR structures is at
the junction where the adenine ligand, absent in
our simulations, should sit. Our results for 1Y26
are comparable in quality to a prior prediction obtained with the automated 3DRNA program, based
on secondary structure reconstruction. 55 In this
program, the smallest secondary elements (SSEs)

are assembled into hairpins, hairpin loop, internal loop, bulge loop, pseudoknot loop and junction and then a network representation of the secondary structure is used to describe the locations
and connectivity of the SSEs. Using the whole
secondary structure extracted from the experimental structure, i.e. much more experimental infor-

mation than the 3 base-pairing constraints we impose with HiRE-RNA, the 3DRNA recovers the
structure of 1Y26 with a RMSD of 6.7 Å.

atomistic simulations, our model predicts the high
resolution structure of tetraloops, which are not
recovered by FARFAR/FARNA by fragment reconstructions including non-canonical pairs. On
larger structures, the prediction capabilities of
HiRE-RNA are comparable to those of the most
advanced methods currently used for RNA structure prediction. However, while we obtain most of
our results with no or minimal external information other than the sequence, these methods typically require a substantial input of experimental
evidence. As it was shown in the 2012 RNApuzzle competition, 57 the best performing prediction algorithms so far are those based on fragment
reconstruction, giving access to 3D structures, but
not giving information on other aspects such as the
folding pathways and energy landscapes. In the
competition, a riboswitch of 86 nt was predicted
by eight research groups with RMSDs ranging
from 7.2 to 23.0 Å . The model of lowest RMSD
(7.2Å) used a multi-scale approach based on 2D
structure prediction methods and self-assembly
of fragments selected from the NDB. 7 Coarsegrained ab initio methods performed much poorly
with the best RMSD at 11.5Å, even when relying
heavily on experimental constraints. 20 More recently, Xia with his coarse-grained model obtained
a structure at 7.6Å, using secondary structure prediction tools and 14 constraints. 58 As shown by
the folding of the triple helix, in the analysis of
folding pathways, our model goes beyond what
was done through Go-like models, 19,59 given we
do not introduce any bias toward the native structure and we account for multiple pairings.
A key feature of our model, distinguishing it
from most other methods, is the possibility of
forming non-canonical and multiple base-pairs.
Our results show the importance of considering
non-canonical base pairs. Indeed they are essential
to fold complex molecules and should not be neglected even for RNAs whose experimental structures contain only canonical pairs as they have a
significant impact on the free energy profile of the
system, on its thermodynamics, and possibly on
folding pathways. The presence of non-canonical
pairs gives rise to an increase of transition states
that can favor interconversion between different
configurations, a behavior that is observed for
many biologically active RNAs 60 and that has

Discussion

We have presented here an effective theory for
RNA folding, based on a detailed and new description of the two main driving forces, stacking
and base-pairing interactions, able to fold structurally diverse RNAs to their native states when
coupled to REMD or ST. As the need to properly consider base pairing and stacking is clear
to anyone working on RNA, how to actually define functions to describe these interactions in a
simplified representation, allowing to study largescale rearrangements, is less than straightforward.
The force field we define is nothing close to any
other existing coarse-grained model. HiRE-RNA
v3 force field shares with the previous v2 version
the particle description and the functional forms of
local interactions, but it is completely redesigned
for all other terms including new analytic energy
functions for base pairing and base stacking that
allow accurate prediction of equilibrium configurations and thermodynamics of 13 systems with
12 to 76 nucleotides starting from fully extended
states. The model makes use of a large number of
parameters which have now been optimized following a rigorous procedure, a particularly complex task when the possible interactions considered go beyond simple Watson-Crick pairing and
address a multitude of possible states including
non-canonical and multiple base-pairs. 56
In spite of its simplicity, similar to Garcia’s
11

been hypothesized for the switch within pseudoknot domain of human telomerase RNA between
the pseudoknot and hairpin conformations. 45 We
are currently investigating these aspects in more
detail through disconnectivity graphs 61 on several
pseudoknots.
As the current status of HiRE-RNA v3 already
represents a significant advancement in the study
of RNA molecules both in terms of prediction capabilities and in the possibility of addressing questions concerning dynamical and thermodynamical
behaviour, we are extending our work to include
other interaction terms such as the presence of ions
and ligands, in order to be closer to experimental conditions. Combined with the coarse-grained
OPEP force field, 38 HiRE-RNA should help understand the interplay between proteins and nucleic acids.
