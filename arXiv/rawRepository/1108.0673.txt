Abstract
In this work we address the question of how oscillations are arrested in the
mouse somitogenesis clock when the determination front reaches presomitic
cells. Based upon available experimental evidence we hypothesize that the
mechanism underlying such a phenomenon involves the interaction between
a limit cycle (originated by a delayed negative feedback loop) and a bistable
switch (originated by a positive feedback loop). With this hypothesis in mind
we construct the simplest possible model comprising both negative and positive feedback loops and show that (with a suitable choice of paremeters):
1) it can show an oscillatory behavior, 2) oscillations are arrested via an
infinite-period bifurcation whenever the different gene-expression regulatorinputs act together in an additive rather than in a multiplicative fashion,
and 3) this mechanism for oscillation arrest is compatible whit plentiful experimental observations.

1. Introduction
As elegantly reviewed by Campanelli and Gedeon [1], somitogenesis is the
process by which vertebrate embryos develop somites, which are transient,
repeated blocks of cells arising from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) that

differentiate further into vertebrae, ribs, musculature, and dorsal dermis.
The tail bud is a proliferative zone at the posterior end of the embryo where
immature cells are continually added to the posterior-most PSM. As the tail
bud grows away posteriorly, the oldest cells in the anterior PSM segment in
groups to form lateral pairs of somites along the midline. The process stops
when the anterior formation of somites has progressed posteriorly across the
entire PSM (reaching the arresting growth in the tail bud) [2–4].
The first model attempting to explain somitogenesis was due to Cooke
and Zeeman [5]. They postulated that the susceptibility of cells in the PSM
to form somites oscillates between susceptible and unsusceptible, while a
determination wavefront sweeps posteriorly across the PSM. The passing
wavefront triggers cells to form somites, but does so only when cells are
susceptible, i.e., when their clocks are in the correct phase of oscillation. Since
adjacent cells are in phase, cohorts of cells are recruited in succession to form
somites. Initially, the clock was thought to be closely linked to the cell cycle
[6]. However, Palmerim et al. [7] discovered a gene with oscillatory expression
in the PSM of the chick embryo, providing an alternative candidate for the
clock. Experimental work has since identified multiple oscillatory genes in
each of several model organisms, including mouse [8] and zebrafish [9].
In all of these organisms, the oscillatory gene expression in individual
cells is coordinated throughout the PSM in order to produce spatiotemporal
waves of mRNA and protein expression [10, 11], which we call the clock-wave
[7]. Synchronized, periodic expression is observed in the tail bud with a
frequency that matches the anterior formation of somites [4, 9]. Broad waves
of expression repeatedly initiate in the posterior-most PSM and narrow while
traveling anteriorly [3, 4, 7]. The waves slow considerably as they reach the
region of forming somites. Successive waves arriving at the anterior-most
PSM help sequentially establish stable bands of high-low gene expression in
several additional genes, indicating nascent somite boundaries and polarity
[3, 4].
Separate experiments have identified biochemical candidates for the wavefront [12–17]. These bio-molecules exhibit graded concentration profiles across
the PSM that shift posteriorly in synchrony with tail bud growth. A changing
gradient level triggers mesodermal cell differentiation and somite formation
[4, 9, 16, 18]. We call this the gradient-wavefront.
The precise mechanism in which the clock-wave interacts with the gradientwavefront, as well as their possible interactions with intercellular signaling
mechanisms, remains unknown [4, 9, 18, 19]. Many mathematical models of
2

the dynamics of somitogenesis have been proposed, with reviews and comparisons of several prominent models available in the literature [15, 18–27].
Previous works have suggested the presence of bistable switches arising
from positive feedback loops (formed by mutual interactions between genes
involved in the somitogenesis process) [15, 17]. In a recent work [24] we
suggested that the interaction between an oscillatory regime (originated by
a time-delayed negative-feedback loop) and a bistable domain (originated by
a positive feedback loop involving genes under different pathways) may be
responsible for the arrest of oscillations in presomitic cells in such a way that
cohorts of presomitic cells stop oscillating simultaneously. Nevertheless, such
a model falls short to explain the experimentally-observed oscillation-period
increase as PSM cells approach the somite-formation region [7, 28, 29].
In this paper we develop a biologically informed, yet minimally constructed, mathematical model which nonetheless is capable of explaining
most of the observed dynamic features of oscillation arrest, and provides
a plausible mechanism for this phenomenon; namely, an infinite period bifurcation.
2. Methods
2.1. Model Development
Several studies on mice have demonstrated that the expression of various
genes under the Notch regulatory pathway oscillates in presomitic cells [11,
30–32]. Other modeling studies have suggest that the underlying mechanism
is a simple negative feedback loop with relatively long time delays due to
transcription and translation of the corresponding genes [16, 18, 19, 25]. On
the other hand, the expression of genes under the Wnt and FGF signaling
pathways has also been experimentally demonstrated to oscillate [8, 12, 33–
35], with the same period as that of genes under the Notch pathway. There is
evidence that such oscillation synchronization is due to the mutual regulation
of genes under the different regulatory pathways [36–38]. The most complete
regulatory regulatory network involving genes known to participate in the
somitogenesis process in the mouse is reviewed in [4].
Based on the above discussed facts we proposed in a previous work [24]
a genetic circuit composed of a delayed negative feedback regulatory loop,
capable of generating an oscillatory behavior, and a positive feedback loop,
behaving as a bistable switch. We observed that the interaction of the switch
and the oscillator can explain the simultaneous arrest of oscillations in cohorts
3

of cells; a necessary condition for explaining somite formation. Nevertheless,
the model failed to explain the experimentally-observed increase of the oscillation period as presomitic cells get away from the tail bud [7, 28, 29]. Under
the consideration that such period increase is more than just an interesting
dynamic feature, we decided to investigate its origin in the present work.
The simplest possible gene network comprising a negative and a positive
feedback loops is that illustrated in Figure 1A. Notice that we have included
an open-loop regulatory input, k, to account for the wavefront signal. In the
previous paper we assumed that a negative and a positive regulatory signals
acting upon a given gene only allow its expression when the first is absent
and the second is present. In the present work we consider that the gene
can be expressed when either the negative signal is absent or the positive
signal is present. Given the above considerations, the equation governing the
dynamics of the gene circuit in Figure 1A is:

In the above equation f (x) ≤ 1 and g(x) ≤ 1 respectively stand for the
negative and positive feedback loops, xτ denotes variable x delayed a time
τ , a is the degradation rate for proteins x, b is the strength of the negative
loop as compared to the positive loop, and 0 ≤ k ≤ 1 is the strength of the
wavefront signal. Equation (1) has been parametrized in such a way that
all of the x input regulatory signals add up to one when they reach their
maximal values. This parametrization guaranties that x is a dimensionless
variable, and that x ≤ 1 at all times. To ensure that the sum of all regulatory
inputs is always less than one, we have further assumed that the strength
of both the negative and the positive loops decreases proportionally to k;
indeed, we have supposed that both of them decrease in the same amount.
Finally, we have assumed that functions f (x) and g(x) are Hill-type functions
of the form:
kn
(2)
f (x) = n 1 n ,
k1 + x
xn
g(x) = n
.
(3)
k2 + xn
Observe that f (x) is a monotonously decreasing function while g(x) is a
monotonously increasing function, in accordance with the fact that they
stand for negative and positive regulation, respectively.

Of all the parameters in the model we fix n = 4, which corresponds to a
biologically plausible level of cooperativity, and analyze the model dynamics
under variations of the rest of them. We start by studying the behavior of
the negative feedback loop by itself, and thus we set b = 1 and k = 0. As
previously reported, we found an oscillatory behavior for a vast set of a, k1
and τn values. Moreover, the smaller the value of τn , the larger the value of a
and the smaller the value of k1 , in order for the system to present sustained
5

oscillations. Finally, τn is the parameter that has, by far, the largest influence
on the oscillation period. Thus, we selected τn = 0.64 hrs = 38.4 min, a =
10 hrs−1 , and k1 = 0.24 to reproduce the 2 hrs oscillation period reported for
the mouse somitogenesis clock.

Figure 2: Snapshots, taken every 30 min, of the time evolution of 12 cells aligned along
the PSM, with a separation of 30 min between consecutive cells. The time span of the
whole simulation begins when all the cells are in the tail bud and finishes when the last
cell is arresting its oscillations. The simulation in A was computed with τp = 0 (the
height of each column is proportional to the value of x in the corresponding cell), while
the simulation in B was carried out considering τp = 20 min.

To analyze the interaction between the oscillator and the bistable switch
we study the model behavior under variations of parameters k and b. Parameter k plays the role of a bifurcation parameter since the oscillations of x are
6

invariably arrested as the value of k is increased beyond a given threshold.
In many cases, oscillation arrest occurs via a Hopf-like bifurcation. That is,
the oscillation amplitude decreases continuously as k increases, until it eventually becomes zero. However, for some values of parameters b and k2 the
oscillation arrest occurs via an infinite period bifurcation. After thoughtfully
browsing the parameter space we found that parameter b needs to take values
in the range [0.2, 0.4] in order to have an infinite period bifurcation. For values larger than 0.4, the oscillations are arrested via a Hopf-like bifurcation,
while for b < 0.4 no oscillatory behavior is observed whatsoever. Regarding
k2 the range of values this parameter can attain so we observe an infinite
period bifurcation depends on the value of b. For instance, when b = 0.2 an
infinite period bifurcation occurs whenever k2 ∈ [0.46, 0.49], when b = 0.3
the range of k2 values for which an infinite period bifurcation is observed
is [0.41, 0.52], and when b = 0.4 the condition for having an infinite period
bifurcation is that k2 ∈ [0.37, 0.43]. In all cases, the k bifurcation value is a
growing function of k2 . In Figure 1B we present the bifurcation diagram calculated with the following b and k2 parameter values: b = 0.3 and k2 = 0.48;
while in Figure 1C we plot the oscillation frequency as a function of k, for
the same parameter values. In this last plot we can see how the frequency
goes to zero (and so the period goes to infinity) as k reaches its bifurcation
value.
As the embryo grows the tail bud recedes and, while doing so, leaves
some cells behind. After a cell leaves the tail bud, the levels of the different
morphogenic substances (Fgf8, Wnt3a, and Retinoic Acid) start changing:
the Fgf8 and Wnt3a levels decrease, while the Retinoic Acid level increases
[17]. In our model we account for those changes by increasing the value
of parameter k. In Figure 1D we illustrate the behavior of an oscillatory
presomitic cell as the value of parameter k increases nonlinearly with time;
starting from zero and up to a value 4/3 times its bifurcation value. Notice
how the oscillation period increases together with k, and how, when k surpasses its bifurcation value, the system completes one further oscillation and
then reaches a steady state.
To better understand the process of oscillation arrest along the PSM we
simulate, following [24], the time evolution of 12 cells aligned along the PSM,
with a separation of 30 min between consecutive cells. If the tail bud recedes
at constant velocity and keeps leaving cell behind in a steady fashion, the
distance between two PSM cells is proportional to the difference of elapsed
times since their leaving the TB. Given that the oscillation period is 2 hrs,
7

the considered cell set spans a PSM region three periods long. To account for
the cell separation, we simply assumed in our simulations that the function
describing how parameter k decays in time is delayed in proportion to how
much later a given cell left the TB. In other words, if k(t) describes the time
evolution of parameter k for the first cell, k(t−(i−1)∆T ) is the corresponding
function for the i-th cell, with ∆T = 30 min.
The results of the simulations described in the previous paragraph are
plotted in Figure 2A. There, we present from top to bottom snapshots taken
every 30 min of the state of all 12 cells. In total, these snapshots account
for five cycles. Observe that at first all the cells oscillate synchronously.
This happens because k ' 0 for all of them, simulating their stay in the
tail bud. However, as time passes and the frontmost cells leave the tail bud,
their oscillation period decreases until they stop oscillating and the gene
expression remains at a high level. Another feature worth noticing is the
fact that the oscillation arrest takes place in cohorts of four cells. That is,
the first four cells complete three cycles before stopping, while the second
and third four-cell sets complete four and five oscillations, respectively. The
process described above can be more clearly visualized in the movie Mov1 of
the Supplementary Material.
The origin of the time delay τn has been attributed to the sum of the times
taken by transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA translocation, translation,
post-transductional modification, diffusion of transcription factors into the
nucleus, etc. Since all of these processes also take place in the positive
feedback regulation loop, a time delay must be also associated to it. Let us
denote such a time delay by τp . We investigated the influence of parameter τp
on the system behavior and found that it is qualitatively the same whenever
τp ≤ 20 min. In particular, the cyclic behavior disappears as k is increased
beyond a given value, via an infinite period bifurcation. Larger τp values
render a more complex behavior whose analysis is beyond the scope of the
present paper.
We calculated the behavior of the model with τp = 12 min when k increases nonlinearly with time; starting from zero and up to 0.2. This simulates a single presomitic cell from the time it is in the tail bud, until it stops
oscillating. The results are plotted In Figure 1E. Observe that the results
are qualitatively equivalent to those in Figure 1D. The most noticeable differences are that the oscillation amplitude is smaller when τp > 0, and that
the gene expression level increases after the oscillations are arrested.
To test the influence of the time delay τp on the process of oscillation
8

arrest along the PSM, we repeated the simulations in Figure 2A, but now
with τp = 12 min. The results are plotted in Figure 2B. A comparison of
Figures 2A and 2B reveals that the behavior of both models is qualitatively
equivalent. The only noticeable differences are that, in the model accounting
for a time delay in the positive feedback loop, the oscillation amplitude is
smaller, the increase of the gene expression level after the oscillations are
arrested is more notorious, and the cell cohorts are more clearly defined
when they stop cycling. The process described above can be more clearly
visualized in the movie Mov2 of the Supplementary Material.
4. Conclusions
Under the assumption that oscillation arrest in the somitigenesis clock
of the mouse takes place due to the interaction between the oscillator and
a bistable switch, we have constructed and analyzed the simplest possible
model that accounts for this interaction. Although the resulting model is so
simple that no quantitative predictions can be expected, we are convinced
that it captures enough detail of the interactions between some of the genes
involved in the somitogenesis processes to render general qualitative predictions.
The results of the model agree with the following experimental observations regarding oscillation arrest in presomitic cells:
1. All cells oscillate in synchrony while they are in the tail bud, but their
oscillation period increases with time after they leave the tail bud and
enter the presomitic mesoderm.
2. PSM cells stop oscillating in equally sized cohorts. These cohorts in
turn give rise to somites.
3. The expression levels of the genes under the Notch pathway increases
after they stop oscillating, and they reach a stationary state of high
expression [12, 32, 40].
To our consideration, the above enumerated results validate the model to
a level that makes feasible the derivation of biological conclusions out from it.
In particular, our model results suggest that oscillation arrest takes place via
an infinite period bifurcation, that a positive and a negative feedback loop
need to act together (in an additive, rather than in a multiplicative fashion)
upon a single gene in order for this bifurcation to occur. The model predictions regarding the existence of interacting positive and negative feedback
9

loops, and that regarding the additivity of both loops can be experimentally
tested in principle.
