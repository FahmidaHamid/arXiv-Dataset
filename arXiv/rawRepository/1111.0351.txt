Abstract
The toxins associated with infectious diseases are potential targets for inhibitors which
have the potential for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Many antibodies have been generated for this purpose, and the objective of this study was to develop a simple mathematical model that may be used to evaluate the potential protective effect of antibodies.
This model was used to evaluate the contributions of antibody affinity and concentration to reducing antibody-receptor complex formation and internalization. The model
also enables prediction of the antibody kinetic constants and concentration required to
provide a specified degree of protection. We hope that this model, once validated experimentally, will be a useful tool for in vitro selection of potentially protective antibodies
for progression to in vivo evaluation.

1. Introduction
Passive immunization using antibodies has been used successfully for treatment and
prophylaxis of infectious disease in humans [1] and there is increasing interest in the use
of antibodies for treatment of infectious diseases that may be used as terrorist weapons,
but for which the risk is not sufficiently high to justify preventive vaccination of a large

civilian population [2]. Toxins are an important potential target for designing therapies
against these threats and a broad range of approaches has been taken to develop inhibitors
that may be of prophylactic or therapeutic use [3].
Antibody engineering techniques allow affinity maturation of antibodies and these
techniques are being exploited to produce inhibitors for a number of toxins [4], [5]. The
emphasis of this approach is on producing reagents with high affinity, based on the
proposition that higher affinity will provide better protection.
However affinity, by itself, is a poor predictor of protective or therapeutic potential.
Antibodies with high in vitro affinity for toxins do not automatically confer protection
in vivo [6], [7] and may exacerbate the toxicity [8], [9]. The effects of using multiple
antibodies with high affinities may be additive [10] or synergistic [6] or without effect [7].
In addition, epitope specificity [11], antibody titre [12] - [16] and dissociation rate [17]
have been correlated with protection.
Toxins are produced by a number of plants, animals and microorganisms. Toxins may
act at the cell surface and either damage the cytoplasmic membrane or bind to a receptor
and act via transmembrane signalling subsequent to that binding [18]. Alternatively,
toxins may cross the cell membrane and act on intracellular targets [18]. For example:
anthrax lethal toxin, ricin and cholera toxin bind to a cell surface receptor and make use
of cellular membrane trafficking to enter the cell [19], [20].
The objective of this study is to develop a simple mathematical model that may be
used to predict the optimum antibody parameters (kinetic constants and concentration)
needed to inhibit the binding of the toxin to its receptor. These predictions may be
used to select candidate antibodies for progression to in vivo evaluation and to assess the
potential value of affinity enhancement.
This paper is an extension to our previous work [21]. In the model presented below
we explicitly take into account the process of toxin internalization and diffusive fluxes
around the cell.

2. Model
The kinetic model describing the interactions of toxins with cell receptors can be
formulated based on the well-known analytical framework for ligand-receptor binding.
2

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the model for receptor-toxin-antibody interaction.

The models of this process have been studied for many years and a vast amount of
literature has accumulated on this subject (see [22]– [26] and refs therein).
When a toxin diffuses in the extracellular environment and binds to the cell surface
receptors, the toxin concentration will vary both in space and time. Any rigorous description of this process would entail a system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE), which
couples extracellular diffusion with reaction kinetics of the cell surface. The resulting
system of PDE is nonlinear and too complex to be treated analytically. This complexity
makes unfeasible any comprehensive study of parameter optimization. From another
perspective, it is well known that under some rather broad conditions (see [22] - [26] and
refs) the reaction-diffusion system of the ligand-receptor binding can be well approximated by a system of Ordinary Differential Equations in which the spatial variability of
the process is simulated by different concentrations of species in initially predefined spatial domains (called compartments). Although, this compartment model is significantly
simpler than the initial reaction-diffusion system, it still allows a consistent description
of diffusion fluxes [23], [25], [26]. In the current paper we use the compartment-model
approach for our analytical study and numerical simulations.
3

To begin, we consider the following simple model. The toxin, T , binds reversibly to
cell surface receptors, R, with a forward rate k1 and a reverse rate k−1 to form the toxinreceptor complex CR which is then slowly internalized at a rate k3 . The neutralizing
antibody binds competitively to the toxin with on and off rates of k2 and k−2 respectively.
The antibody-toxin complex, CA , remains in the extracellular space (see Fig.1).
We can easily write an equation for the toxin-receptor binding (viz, without antibody
being present). For a spherical cell of radius a with the toxin binding to its surface [22][26]
dCR
= kfe RT + kre CR ,
dt

(1)

where CR is the concentration of the bound receptors (toxin-receptor complexes), R is
the concentration of receptors, T is the bulk toxin concentration (i.e. far from the cell
surface) and is assumed to be spatially uniform. The effective forward and reverse rate
coefficients are defined by [22] - [26]
kfe = γk1 , kre = γk−1 ,

(2)

where k1 , k−1 are intrinsic reaction rates, kD = 4πaD is the diffusion rate, D is the
diffusivity of toxin in the extracellular space, γ = 1/(1 + Rk1 /kD ) ≤ 1 [23],[24],[26].
The bulk concentration of toxin T is mainly driven by the binding to antibody. Therefore, in this case we can write an equation system similar to (1), but without any “diffusive” modification of the intrinsic rate constants:
dCA
= k2 AT + k−2 CA ,
dt

(3)

where CA is the concentration of toxin-antibody complexes, A is the concentration of
antibody.
The process of toxin internalization is phenomenologically introduced into our model
by the equation
dTi
= k3 CR ,
dt

(4)

where Ti is the concentration of internalized toxin. The corresponding term should be
included in (1), so we arrive at modified expression for kre
kre = γk−1 − k3 .
4

(5)

The system (1), (3), (4) should be supplemented with three conservation laws for
concentrations of R, T and A:
R0 = R + CR ,

(6)

A0 = A + CA ,

(7)

T0 = T + CT + CA + Ti ,

(8)

where R0 , T0 and A0 are the initial concentrations.
Eqs (1), (3), (4), (6) – (8) form a framework for our analysis. This is a system of
nonlinear ODE (because of conservation laws (6) – (8) and because of effective rates
kfe , kre are functions of the receptor concentration). It can be easily solved numerically
and also allows some analytical progress (see below). If parameter γ ≪ 1 (and this is the
case in many practical situations), then this model can be reduced to the “well-mixed”
kinetic model with constant kinetic rates [21].
It is worth emphasizing that the aim our analytical framework is to develop a simple,
but scientifically rigorous model that may be used to predict the optimum antibody kinetic properties and concentration required to achieve a desired protective effect, rather
than develop a detailed, biologically accurate model that captures all the detail of the
toxin internalization process. Therefore, the model does not take into account the pharmacokinetics of the toxin-antibody complex [9] or receptor internalization and recycling
[28], [29]. k3 is a lumped constant that describes all the processes that result in the appearance of the free toxin in the intracellular space [30]. Wiley and Cunningham [31] and
Shankaran et al. [32] have also developed mathematical models of this type of process.
We are particularly interested in the behaviour of the model under conditions most
likely to reflect the real biological situation i.e. toxin concentration much lower than the
concentration of receptors (T0 /R0 ≪ 1).
Testing of the model was carried out using COPASI (software application for simulation
and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics [33]) and the kinetic parameters
for the binding of ricin to its receptor and its internalization [34] and competition by the
monoclonal antibody 2B11 [6]. The kinetic parameters used are shown in Table 1. The
value of k3 used is that determined by Sandvig et al. [19] to be the rate of irreversible
binding of ricin to HeLa cells. For simplicity, the simulation was carried out using all

reactions taking place in the same compartment.
To illustrate the model we used toxin and receptor concentrations based on cell culture
studies carried out in our laboratory. These typically use a cell concentration of 1·104 cells
per 100 µl experiment and a ricin concentration of 10 pM . Assuming 3·107 receptors/cell
[34], the receptor concentration is approximately 5nM .
3. Analytical Results
3.1. Cell-Surface Binding
Initially we derive some analytical results for toxins that act at the cell surface and
are not internalized, i.e. we set k3 = 0 in Eq. (4). At equilibrium d/dt = 0 and from (1),
(3) we can write
CR = RT /K1 ,

CA = AT /K2 ,

(9)

where K1 = k1 /k−1 , K2 = k2 /k−2 are the association constants for the toxin binding to
the receptor and antibody respectively. It is worth noting that the parameter γ (diffusive
correction of the intrinsic reaction rates) disappears from Eqs.(9), so in this case the
analytical results are identical to ones derived using the “well-mixed” approximation
[21].
In order to simplify notations we denote by z and y the equilibrium concentrations
of the toxin-receptor and toxin-antibody complexes, i.e.
z = [CR ]eq , y = [CA ]eq .
6

(10)

From Eqs.(9) and conservation laws (6)–(8) the following closed equation for z can be
derived:
(R0 − z)(T0 − z − y) − K1 z = 0,
ǫz
y = A0
,
R0 − z(1 − ǫ)

(11)
(12)

where ǫ = K1 /K2 .
Eq.(11) can be written in a more conventional form of a cubic equation:
a3 z 3 + a2 z 2 + a1 z + a0 = 0,

(13)

where
a3 = ǫ − 1,
a2 = (1 − ǫ)C0 + ǫA0 + R0 , r
a1 = −R0 (C0 + A0 + (1 − ǫ)T0 ),
a0 = T0 R02 ,
and C0 = R0 + K1 .
It is well-known that Eq.(13) has a closed-form analytical solution (Cardano’s formula
[35]), which in our case provides a consistent way to derive exact solutions for the proposed model. Unfortunately these solutions still involve rather cumbersome expressions,
which require further simplifications in order to be used in practical situations. Below
we present another approach that explicitly employs the smallness of ratio T0 /R0 ≪ 1
and leads to a simple analytical expression for the protective properties of the antibody.
We observe that in the absence of antibody (i.e. A0 = 0), Eq.(11) is an elementary
quadratic equation that has two roots. If we impose the obvious constraint z → 0 as
T0 → 0 then there is only one solution, which we designate as z0 :

z0 =

(14)

Under the condition T0 /R0 ≪ 1, this can be simplified to
z0 ≈

R0 T0
, C0 = R0 + K1 .
C0
7

(15)

Let us now evaluate the effect of adding an antibody. From a mathematical point
of view this effect (i.e. change of z under condition A0 > 0) is captured entirely by the
term y in (11), so our aim is to provide a reasonable analytical estimation of this term.
From Eq.(12) and based on our initial assumption of low toxin concentration (T0 /R0 ≪
1) we can deduce the following simple estimate y ≈ ǫzA0 /R0 . This then leads to a modified form of Eq.(11)
(R0 − z)(T0 − z) − K∗ z = 0,

(16)

K∗ = K1 + ǫA0 .

(17)

where

We can see that this is the same form as the equation for z when A0 = 0, but now
with K1 replaced with K∗ . This also implies that the analytical solution (15) is still
valid, but only with the substitution K1 = K∗ .
In order to characterize the effect of an antibody on the binding of a toxin to its
receptor, we introduce the non-dimensional parameter Ψ, the relative reduction in CR
due to the introduction of an antibody
Ψ≡

z(A0 > 0)
.
z(A0 = 0)

(18)

The analytical results presented above enable us easily to derive a simple formula for the
antibody efficiency parameter Ψ. By using (10), 15, (17), (18) we can readily deduce
Ψ=

1
, ǫ = K1 /K2 , λ = A0 /C0 .
1 + ǫλ

(19)

This expression is the main result of the current paper and will be validated with numerical simulations.
To conclude this section let us briefly discuss some additional constraints for the
parameters of our model in order for the expression (19) to be valid. As mentioned
above the condition of low toxin concentration is always assumed in our study. Another
simple condition can be derived from the constraint CR + CA ≤ T0 and by using Eq.(15):
A0
R0 A0
R0
(1 + ǫ ) ≈ ǫ 2 ≤ 1,
C0

(20)

since R0 /C0 ≤ 1. This condition could be always checked retrospectively and always
hold in our numerical simulations.

3.2. Toxin Internalization
For toxins that are internalized, the effect of antibodies that prevent receptor binding
is to reduce the effective rate of internalization. To examine and evaluate this effect we
need to analyze the full system (1), (3), (4).
In order to characterize the effect of antibody concentration on the rate of toxin
internalization we introduce a new parameter:
G=

Ti (A0 > 0)
,
Ti (A0 = 0)

(21)

which is a function of time (i.e. G ≡ G(t)).
Our aim is to deduce function G based on the kinetic model (1), (3), (4). It is
evident that G ≤ 1 for t > 0 and G → 1 as t → ∞ (since in that case all toxin will be
internalized).
For the toxins of interest, while the receptor binding is rapid (time sale ∼ 1/(k1 C0 ))
[22], [23], the subsequent internalization is much slower (time scale ∼ 1/k3 ≫ 1/(k1 C0 )).
This coupling of slow and fast processes in our system allows us to develop a simplified
model of toxin internalization using the the well-known framework of Quasi-Steady-State
Approximation (QSSA), see [22]– [27] and refs therein.
When applied to our system QSSA elucidates the toxin internalization as a twostage process. After the initial rapid binding of the toxin to the receptor we can simply
set dCR /dt = 0 in (1). The further slow evolution of T (t) (viz, quasi-steady state) is
completely determined by the conservation law (8) and Eq.(4) and spans a time scale of
the order of the internalization time (∼ 1/k3 ). In addition, for solving (4) at the initial
stage of internalization, we can assume that Ti ≪ T0 and write
Ti (t) = k3 z0 t, t ≪ 1/k3 ,

(22)

where z0 is given by expressions (14) and (15). The evolution of Ti (t) for the late stage
of internalization can be readily derived from (4), (6) - (8) by assuming [T0 − Ti (t)] ≪ T0 :
Ti (t) = T0 [1 − exp(−k3 t)], t ≥ 1/k3 ,

(23)

so Ti (t) exponentially approaches its saturation limit. A simulation of this process is
shown in Fig.5 and the slow linear increase of Ti at the initial stage is clearly visible.
9

Now, consider the case where A0 > 0. According to (22) the main effect of the
introduction of an antibody is to reduce the value of z0 , as described in the previous
section. Then, based on (21), (22) and (18) we can conclude that, during the quasiequilibrium stage, the following approximation holds
G=

Ti (A0 > 0)
≈ Ψ,
Ti (A0 = 0)

(24)

where Ψ is given by expression (19).
The overall effect of introducing an antibody can be best describes in terms of the
internalization half-time, τi . Without antibody the later can be estimated from (23) and
condition Ti (τi ) = T0 /2. Thus from Eq.(22) we yield
τi ≈

C0
T0
=
.
2k3 z0
2k3 R0

(25)

For the internalization time with the presence of antibody we can apply reduced value
of z0 and write the following simple formula
τi
1
≈ ,
0
τi
Ψ

(26)

where τi0 is the internalization time in the absence of antibody (A0 = 0).
Eqs.(25) and (26) have a clear interpretation. As described in the previous section,
the introduction of an antibody results in a decrease, at t ≪ τi , in the equilibrium value
of CR (i.e. in z0 ). This can be related, in accordance with Eq.(22) and Eq.(25), to a
corresponding decrease in the concentration of internalized toxin Ti and a consequent
increase in the toxin internalization time (since it takes longer to achieve a give level of
Ti ). Since changes in z0 can be described comprehensively by means of the parameter Ψ,
it still remains the only parameter needed to characterize the influence of an antibody
on the concentration of internalized toxin (24), (26).
It is evident that the two main effects described above (reduction of the concentration
of internalized toxin at a given time, and increase in the time required for the internalized
toxin to reach a given concentration) are not independent of each other. The linear
relationships (24), (26) allow us to establish a general identity that relates these two
effects for any time t.
Let us assume that for A0 = 0, τ0 in is the time taken for the internalized toxin to
reach a concentration Ti0 (i.e τ 0 = Ti0 /(k3 z0 ), see (22)). The effect of introducing an
10

antibody is to reduce the internalized toxin concentration to a value Ti ≤ Ti0 . Then
from (24), (26) we can derive the following identity:
Ti τi = Ti0 τi0 ,

(27)

where τi is the time required for the internalized toxin to reach Ti0 when A0 > 0. The
identity (27) has no explicit dependency on antibody kinetic parameters or concentration
and provides an easy way to calculate any of the parameters (Ti , Ti0 , τi , τi0 ) if the other
three are known.

4. Numerical Results and Discussion
We have derived an analytical expression for the parameter Ψ, the relative ability of
an antibody to reduce the binding of a toxin to its receptor (19). Our derivation is based
on the following assumptions:
1. Toxin concentration is much lower than the receptor concentration
2. For toxins that are internalized, the internalization rate is much slower than
establishment of the receptor-toxin binding equilibrium.
Applying these assumptions we found that parameter Ψ is independent of the toxin
concentration (see (19)), i.e. it is determined by the ratio of antibody to receptor concentration and not by the ratio of antibody to toxin concentration as is commonly used.
For the low toxin/receptor ratios likely to occur in biological situations, the condition
(20) can be met by large range of antibody kinetic parameters. From this point of view
Eq.(19) should be valid for most practical applications.
The implications of our analytical findings are illustrated by simulation of the complete kinetic model (Eqs. (1),(3), (4), (6)– (8)) using the kinetic constants for ricin and
the anti-ricin antibody 2B11 (Table 1). Fig.2 is a simulation of the effect of the presence
of an antibody on the binding of the toxin to its receptor (formation of CR ). The antibody concentration is expressed as the dimensionless parameter λ = A0 /C0 . In this case,
since R0 and T0 ≪ K1 , the parameter C0 = R0 + K1 is dominated by K1 (1.08 · 10−7 ).
Fig.3 shows the effect of increasing antibody concentration on Ψ . There is a good
agreement between the values of Ψ determined from (19) and from (18) using the equilibrium values of CR determined from simulation of the complete kinetic model (Fig. 3).

For instance, the results predict that, for this toxin and antibody combination, the additional protection provided by increasing the antibody concentration diminishes rapidly
when λ exceeds 0.1.
Fig.4 shows the relationship (19) between Ψ, antibody concentration and the toxin/antibody
and the ratio of toxin/receptor dissociation constants (ǫ). This plot is valid for all combinations of toxin, receptor and antibody consistent with the assumptions used to derive
(19), principally T0 ≪ R0 . The antibody kinetic parameters and concentration required
to provide a specified degree of protection may be determined from this plot. For example, any combination of ǫ and λ falling below the dashed line will reduce either CR or Ti
by 80 %.
This, in turn, enables important judgements to be made about antibody selection.
For example, if an antibody concentration of 0.25C0 (λ = 0.25) is achievable, then an
antibody with an ǫ value of 50 will provide good protection (93% reduction in CR or Ti ).
If an antibody concentration of only 0.05C0 (λ = 0.05) is achievable, then an ǫ value of
250 is required to achieve the same level of protection. The structure of (19) is such that,
a given increase in protection (Ψ or Γ) may be achieved by either an x-fold increase in ǫ

or an x-fold increase in λ.
The effect of antibody on toxin internalization is simulated in Fig.5. Rapid equilibration of receptor and toxin is followed by slow accumulation of toxin within the cell.
Equation (24) predicts that Ψ is the only parameter needed to characterize the influence
of an antibody on toxin internalization. Fig.6 compares Γ calculated using (24), (19)
with Γ determined using values of Ti and Ti0 at t = 104 sec from this simulated data and
shows good agreement between the two values under the condition T0 ≪ R0 , although
the value of Γ is slightly greater than Ψ. The plot predicts the degree of protection
provided by a given concentration of antibody and enables assessment of the value of
increasing antibody concentration beyond a certain value. For example, to enhance the
reduction of Ti from 90% to 95% requires doubling of A0 .
The expression for Ψ, (19), assumes a quasi-equilibrium state in the system. In
practice, this state may take significant time to achieve. Fig. 7 shows a simulation of
the time taken by the ricin/receptor/2B11 system to reach the quasi-equilibrium state
for λ = 0.05. The value of Γ determined from the toxin internalization profiles (Fig.7)
parallels this process, i.e. experimental validation of Γ must allow sufficient time to

The relationship between the internalization time τi and Ψ described in Eq.(26) is
shown in Fig.8. Ψ was determined from simulated toxin internalization time courses
(Fig.5) as the time to internalize 5 · 10−14 M ricin. The slope of the fitted line is 1.07,
close to the predicted value of 1.0.
In summary, the protection provided by an antibody against toxins that act either
at the cell surface or after binding to the cell surface followed by internalization may be
predicted from a simple kinetic model. Protection parameter Ψ is a simple function of
antibody, receptor and toxin concentrations and the kinetic parameters governing the
binding of the toxin to the receptor and antibody:
Ψ=

(28)

The calculated value of Ψ matches closely the degree of protection determined from
numerical simulation of the binding and internalization reactions and provides a convenient method for predicting the optimum antibody parameters (concentration and
dissociation constant) needed to provide effective treatment or prophylaxis for toxins.
