ABSTRACT
It is a principal open question whether noninvasive imaging methods in humans can
decode information encoded at a spatial scale as fine as the basic functional unit of
cortex: cortical columns. We addressed this question in five magnetoencephalography
(MEG) experiments by investigating the encoding of a columnar-level encoded visual
feature: contrast edge orientation. We found that MEG signals contained orientationspecific information as early as ~50ms after stimulus onset even when controlling for
confounds, such as overrepresentation of particular orientations, stimulus edge
interactions, and global form-related signals. Theoretical modeling confirmed the
plausibility of this empirical result. An essential consequence of our results is that
information encoded in the human brain at the level of cortical columns should in general
be accessible by multivariate analysis of electrophysiological signals.

INTRODUCTION

The basic format in which the primary visual cortex (V1) represents the visual world is
the orientation of contrast edges (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959, 1968). Invasive research in
animals and ultrahigh-resolution fMRI in humans have shown that neurons tuned to a
particular edge orientation cluster in sub-millimeter size columns (Bartfeld and Grinvald,
1992; Vanduffel et al., 2002; Yacoub et al., 2008). Thus, the size of orientation columns
is smaller than the sampling resolution of standard fMRI (3mm) and
magnetoencephalography (MEG), seemingly raising a barrier to resolving orientations
from brain data obtained with standard noninvasive techniques. However, ten years ago
two studies claimed to have crossed this boundary using standard resolution fMRI
(Haynes and Rees, 2005; Kamitani and Tong, 2005), showing that grating orientation can
be decoded from fMRI activation patterns.

This claim has sparked a debate and has been challenged in at least two ways (Mannion
et al., 2009, 2010; Kriegeskorte et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2011, 2013; Alink et al.,
2013; Carlson, 2014; Carlson et al., 2014; Pratte et al., 2014). First, interpretation of
fMRI results is confounded by the complex relationship between neuronal activity, the
BOLD response, and the voxel-wise sampling of BOLD activity (Logothetis and
Wandell, 2004). For example, modeling voxels as compact kernels or complex
spatiotemporal filters greatly influences the sampling of columnar level activity
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2010), and thus complicates the interpretation of the spatial scale of
the underlying signal sources.

Second, it has been argued that orientation stimuli used to probe V1 activity might also
elicit orientation-specific coarse-scale activation patterns far above the size of orientation
columns. Such coarse-scale activation patterns might result from a relatively stronger
representation for particular orientations (Pettigrew et al., 1968; Maffei and Campbell,
1970; Mansfield, 1974; Rose and Blakemore, 1974; Kennedy and Orban, 1979;
Furmanski and Engel, 2000; Li et al., 2003; Sasaki et al., 2006; Mannion et al., 2009;
Freeman et al., 2011, 2013; Alink et al., 2013), boundary interaction effects between
background and stimulus (Carlson, 2014), and perceptual binding processes influenced
by the global form of the stimulus (Alink et al., 2013).

Here, we circumvent the first challenge by taking an alternative approach: we used MEG
instead of fMRI to resolve orientation from brain signals. MEG measures direct neuronal
activation without the complex convolution of the BOLD response, and its fine temporal
resolution enables us to dissociate the contribution of early first-pass visual responses
from late processing along the ventral visual pathway and other feedback signals. To
address the second challenge, we used multiple sets of controlled stimuli to investigate
alternative hypotheses of coarse-scale confounds in orientation decoding. Finally, we
conducted a modeling experiment to examine whether simulated activation patterns in V1
at the spatial scale of orientation columns are discriminable from modeled MEG signals.

We found that MEG signals contained orientation-specific information even when
controlling for known stimulus-induced coarse-scale activation confounds. Modeling
demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of discriminating cortical activation patterns that

4

differ at the spatial scale of cortical columns. Together, our results indicate that
orientation encoding in humans at the level of cortical columns is directly accessible to
experimental investigation using noninvasive electrophysiological methods. This
suggests that other information encoded in the human brain in fine-grained distributed
activation patterns is accessible by multivariate analysis of electrophysiological data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Participants
Experiments 1 to 5 included 12, 13, 16, 12, and 12 right-handed, healthy volunteers with
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, respectively. Some subjects participated in more
than one experiment, with the overall population being 20 males and 25 females, with
mean age ± s.d. = 23.68 ± 4.55. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

2.2 Stimulus material
The stimulus set comprised diverse visual stimuli differing in local orientation and
overlaid on a uniform gray background. Stimuli and background were of equal mean
luminance. All stimuli were created by in-house scripts using Matlab (2014a, The
MathWorks, Natwick, MA, USA).

We used two main categories of stimuli: Cartesian gratings (Figs. 1A, 2A) and
logarithmic spirals (Fig. 3A). These stimuli allowed us to address the influence of
different biases on orientation decoding. Cartesian gratings had frequency of 2 cycles per

5

degree visual angle and multiple orientations (0-150° in 30° steps, and +–45°, measured
with respect to the vertical line). Logarithmic spirals had 20 contrast cycles and were
construed such that their edges were at an angle +45° (turning direction clockwise) or 45° (turning direction anti-clockwise) relative to a line through the center of the stimulus
(the radial line) at any position in the stimulus, resulting in a local orientation disparity of
90° with each other. Both gratings and spirals were constructed in two phase exemplars
with a half cycle phase shift.

For experiments 1-3, gratings and spirals were presented in an annulus with an outer
radius of 10° and an inner radius of 1°.

For experiment 4, the annulus of the grating stimuli was deformed into ellipsoidal shapes.
In detail, we compressed the annulus in the orientation of the grating and elongated it in
the orthogonal direction. Deformations were 2, 5, 10 and 20% of the radius of the
annulus. Instead of 2 phase exemplars, we completely randomized phase because we
found no phase effect in experiments 1-3. A Matlab script encoding the perfect ice cube
model as in (Carlson, 2014), generating the deformed stimuli, and testing for effects of
cross-classification based on the ice cube model output is available upon request.

For experiment 5, we introduced patch-swapped variants for both gratings and spirals in
addition to the original intact stimuli. Patch-swapped stimuli preserved the 90° disparity
of the original stimuli, but were equated in global form (Fig. 5A,B) (Alink et al., 2013).
To achieve this, stimuli were subdivided in patches using a polar checkerboard array

6

defined by equi-length arcs in each of 4 concentric circles (1°, 2.5°, 5°, 10°). We created
patch-swapped stimuli by swapping half (non-adjacent) patches between opposing
stimuli (+45° vs. -45° gratings, or clockwise vs. counter-clockwise spirals). We repeated
this procedure for each phase separately. To control for the additional edges introduced
by patch-swapping, lines of background color covered the patch edges for all stimuli.

2.3 Experimental design
Visual stimuli were presented using Psychtoolbox (www.psychtoolbox.org) (Brainard,
1997). Stimuli appeared in random order for 0.1s, with an ISI of 0.9-1.1s. Participants
were instructed to fixate on a centrally presented red fixation cross, and press a button
and blink their eyes in response to a target image (displaying concentric circles) shown
every 3-5 trials, to maintain attention and avoid contamination of experimental conditions
with eye blink artifacts. Target image trials were not included in further analysis. The
order of stimulus conditions was randomized.

Experiment 1 had 4 conditions (grating stimuli +45°/-45°, in 2 exemplar phases).
Experiment 2 had 12 conditions (grating stimuli 0° to 150° in 30° steps, in 2 exemplar
phases). Experiment 3 had 4 conditions (logarithmic spirals clockwise/anti-clockwise, in
2 exemplar phases). Experiment 4 had 10 conditions (grating stimuli, +45°/-45°, one
original and 4 deformations to ellipsoidal shape) with each stimulus having randomized
phase per trial. Experiment 5 had 8 conditions (grating stimuli +45°/-45° and spiral
stimuli clockwise/anti-clockwise, original and patch-swapped versions).

7

In each experiment, participants completed 15 runs, each lasting 216, 255, 216, 208, and
307 s for experiments 1-5, respectively. Each experimental condition was presented 33
(Exp. 1, 2) or 13 (Exp. 3, 4, 5) times in each MEG run.

2.4 Human MEG recording
MEG signals were recorded from 306 channels (204 planar gradiometers, 102
magnetometers, Elekta Neuromag TRIUX, Elekta, Stockholm) at a sampling rate of
1000Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.03 and 330Hz. Raw data was pre-processed
with spatiotemporal filters using Maxfilter software (Elekta, Stockholm) and then
analyzed with Brainstorm (Tadel et al., 2011). We extracted peri-stimulus MEG data
from -100 to +900ms with respect to each stimulus onset, and for every trial we removed
the baseline (-100 to 0ms) mean of each channel, normalized with the baseline standard
deviation, and temporally smoothed with a 20ms sliding window.

2.5 Multivariate pattern classification on MEG data
To determine the time course with which MEG signals distinguish between experimental
conditions, data was subjected to multivariate pattern classification analyses using linear
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers (libsvm implementation,
www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm, Müller et al., 2001). All analyses shared a common
framework: For each time point t (from 100ms before to 900ms after image onset with
1ms step), single-trial MEG data were arranged in 306 dimensional pattern vectors,
representing the activity in the 306 MEG sensors. To reduce computational load and
improve SNR, single-trial MEG vectors were sub-averaged in groups of 40 with random
assignment, yielding M averaged trials per time point and condition (M varied per
experiment and type of decoding). We then measured the performance of the SVM
8

classifier to discriminate between every pair of conditions using a leave-one-out
approach: M - 1 vectors were randomly assigned to the training test, and the left-out
vector to the testing set to evaluate the classifier decoding accuracy. The above
procedures were repeated 100 times, each with random assignment of the raw pattern
vectors to M averaged pattern vectors, and the resulting decoding accuracy was averaged
over repetitions. This produced a single decoding accuracy value for each pair of
conditions and each time point t.

In detail, we conducted 5 different classification analyses.
Classification of orientation (same phase): Training and testing sets had trials with same
phase. First, the SVM classifier was trained to distinguish orientation based on trials of
one stimulus phase, and tested with left-out trials with the same stimulus phase. Then, the
analysis was repeated for the other phase and results were averaged.

Classification of orientation (different phase): Training and testing sets had trials with
different phase. First, the SVM classifier was trained to distinguish orientation with trials
associated with one stimulus phase, and tested for the other. Then, the analysis was
repeated for the opposite arrangement of phase and results were averaged. Training was
performed using the same M-1 trials as the same phase condition to allow a direct
comparison.

Classification of orientation (any phase): Training and testing sets had trials with any
phase. Trials with the same orientation but 2 phase exemplars were combined, resulting

9

in conditions with twice as many trials. The SVM classifier was trained to distinguish
orientation following the previously described M-1 leave-one-out approach, but with
twice greater M, and thus improved signal to noise ratio.

Classification of phase (same orientation): Similar to classification of orientation (same
phase), but with opposite role for the two stimuli properties.

Classification of orientation with different stimuli shapes: Training set had trials with
grating stimuli of circular shape. Testing set had trials with the same grating stimuli of
circular shape, or deformed grating stimuli of elliptical shape (with different amount of
deformation from a circle). The SVM classifier was trained to distinguish orientation
based on trials of the original grating stimuli, and tested for trials with the original or
deformed stimuli. Phase was randomized per trial for these stimuli and was irrelevant for
the classification procedure.

2.6 Modeling and classifying MEG signals resulting from V1 random
patterns at the spatial scale of cortical columns
To simulate columnar-level MEG signals in human, we extracted the V1 cortical surface
of a subject using Freesurfer automatic segmentation (Dale et al., 1999) (Fig. 6A). The
triangulated surface had an average node distance of 880 µm (std = 279 µm), comparable
to the diameter of orientation columns in human (Yacoub et al., 2008). Each node
represented the center of a cortical column and was assigned random electrical activity
sampled from a uniform distribution in the range of 0 and 1. The columnar-level

10

simulated V1 activity was then mapped to 306 MEG sensors using a single sphere head
model in Brainstorm (Tadel et al., 2011) (Fig. 6B).

To match the simulated MEG patterns in scale to an empirically realistic value of mean
peak-to-peak strength of 978 femtoTesla (fT) as observed in experiment 1 (across-subject
average of maximal trial-averaged evoked responses to grating stimuli), we scaled V1
pattern activity appropriately. This yielded V1 activation patterns in the range of 0 to 0.16
nano-Ampere-meter (nA-m) per simulated column. This is a physiologically plausible
value, below the maximum current dipole of 18 nA-m per orientation column the V1
cortex can support, as derived from empirical and modeling studies. In particular, the
basic unit of the neocortex is the minicolumn, with the primary visual cortex of macaque
monkey having a density of approximately 1270 microcolumns per mm2, and each
microcolumn containing approximately 142 pyramidal cells (Jones, 2000). An orientation
column in human, comprising several microcolumns, is about 800µm in diameter
(Yacoub et al., 2008), and assuming the same cell density as the macaque monkey, it
should contain approximately 90,000 pyramidal cells. Computational models (Murakami
and Okada, 2006) and CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neuron measurements (Kyuhou and
Okada, 1993) estimated the electrical activity of pyramidal neurons in the order of 0.2
pico-Ampere-meter per cell. This suggests a maximum current dipole of 18 nA-m per
orientation column if all neurons activated synchronously and had dendrites parallel one
another. Thus, the estimated maximum of 0.16nA-m per orientation columns is far below
the expected electrophysiological maximum and can account for asynchronous neuronal

11

firing, silent neurons, non-aligned dendrites, and other factors that would reduce the
current dipole strength.

We estimated empirical noise from single trial baseline MEG data from Experiment 1
(average s.d. across subjects: 243 fT for magnetometers, 56.65 fT/cm for gradiometers).
Adding noise at this level produced simulated MEG sensor patterns with signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of -4 dB. To further explore a wide range of noise conditions, we added noise
at different levels, ranging from -44 to 16 dB.

For every noise level, we evaluated whether simulated V1 activation patterns were
discriminated by noisy MEG sensor patterns. We ran a multivariate analysis equivalent to
the ‘any phase’ classification analysis of Experiment 1. For this, we simulated 500 pairs
of random V1 activation patterns. For every pair, we created 960 noisy trials of MEG
sensor level patterns for each V1 pattern. We sub-averaged simulated raw trials in groups
of 40, and classified V1 patterns from averaged simulated MEG patterns. We repeated
this process 100 times for random ascriptions of raw to averaged trials. Results (percent
decoding accuracy) were averaged across the 100 iterations and the 500 random V1
activation patterns, yielding one decoding accuracy value for each noise level.

2.7 Statistical analysis
We used permutation tests for cluster-size inference, and bootstrap tests to determine
confidence intervals for onset and peak latency of significant clusters (Nichols and
Holmes, 2002; Pantazis et al., 2005; Maris and Oostenveld, 2007). Permutation tests
exchanged the data labels (for example +45° vs. -45° grating orientation) randomly for

12

each participant to determine significant time points of classification accuracy (10000
permutation samples, cluster-definition threshold p<0.05, cluster threshold p<0.05).
Bootstrap tests sampled with replacement (1000 samples) the participant pool to estimate
the distribution of onset and peak latency of significant clusters and derive 95%
confidence intervals.

RESULTS

3.1 Experiment 1: Edge orientation in Cartesian gratings is decodable from
MEG signals

FIGURE 1: Orientation decoding of oblique gratings. A) The stimulus set comprised oblique gratings
tilted right or left (orientation +/–45°) with two phase exemplars having a half cycle phase shift. B) Time
course of orientation decoding in 3 cases: the classifier training and testing sets comprised grating stimuli
of the same phase, different phase, or any phase. Grating orientation was robustly decoded in all analyses
(also see Table 1A). There was no evidence for the representation of phase (classifier training and testing
sets had the same orientation). Gray vertical line indicates stimulus onset. Lines below plots indicate

13

significant time points, color-coded as in decoding curves. (N=12; p<0.05 cluster definition threshold,
p<0.05 cluster threshold).

The aim of experiment 1 was to establish whether edge orientation of Cartesian gratings
is discriminated by visual representations measured with MEG. Previous studies have
reported that cardinal orientations (i.e. 0 and 90°) were encoded differently from other
orientations, either by a larger cell population (Pettigrew et al., 1968; Maffei and
Campbell, 1970; Mansfield, 1974) or with sharper tuning curves (Rose and Blakemore,
1974; Kennedy and Orban, 1979). Thus, comparing brain responses to different cardinal
orientations, or orientations of unequal angular disparity from cardinal orientations, might
result in coarse-scale activation difference favoring cardinal orientations (cardinal bias).
To avoid the coarse-scale cardinal bias, we used oblique gratings (+/–45°) whose
orientation is equidistant from cardinal orientations (0/90°). We recorded MEG signals
from 306 channels while 12 participants viewed a sequence of static Cartesian gratings
(stimulus duration 100ms) in random succession (Fig. 1A). Gratings had two phase
exemplars with a half cycle phase shift.

We extracted and preprocessed peri-stimulus MEG data from -100 to +900ms (1ms
resolution) with respect to stimulus onset. We then used time-resolved multivariate
pattern classification to decode the orientation of grating stimuli from MEG activation
patterns. For each time point, MEG data were divided into training and testing sets, and
the classifier (a linear support vector machine) learned to infer the orientation of grating
stimuli from the training set. Decoding accuracy then quantified the performance of the
classifier to predict the orientation of grating stimuli in the testing set. We determined

14

statistical significance by non-parametric sign-permutation tests, and cluster-size
inference for multiple comparison corrections (cluster-definition threshold p<0.05, cluster
threshold p<0.05). Onset and peak latency of decoding time series are reported with 95%
confidence intervals in brackets.

Restricting the training and testing sets to include grating stimuli of same phase, we
found that MEG signals contained information about grating orientation starting at 53ms
after stimulus onset (95% confidence interval 50-61ms), with a peak at 103ms (91153ms). In contrast, an analogous decoding procedure for phase, with training and testing
sets comprising grating stimuli of same orientation, did not reveal any phase information
(Fig. 1B).

In the above analysis, grating stimuli that differed in orientation also consistently differed
in local luminance because the phase was kept the same. Thus, orientation decoding may
be due to local luminance differences rather than orientation. To determine whether
grating orientation can be discriminated by visual representations independent of local
luminance, we conducted a cross-classification analysis, forcing an assignment of
opposite (half a cycle different) phases to the training and testing sets. In this analysis
local luminance carries no information about orientation. We found that MEG signals
resolved grating orientation independent of phase starting at 51ms (46-55ms), with a peak
at 102ms (89-165ms), confirming that our results cannot be explained by local luminance
differences.

15

Finally, we dropped phase information and assigned all grating stimuli to training and
testing sets irrespective of phase. Such an approach affords higher signal-to-noise ratio by
doubling the number of available images for the training and testing sets. We found that
overall classification performance improved slightly, with an onset at 48ms (34-52ms)
and a peak at 102ms (92-157ms).

In sum, we found that grating orientation was linearly decodable close to ceiling
performance independent of phase for oblique (+/–45°) stimuli. We showed the time
course with which orientation information is encoded by the visual brain (Garcia et al.,
2013; Ramkumar et al., 2013), and excluded the coarse-scale effects of cardinal
orientations as a necessary condition for orientation decoding.

3.2 Experiment 2: Edge orientation is decodable from MEG signals equally
well for cardinal and oblique gratings

FIGURE 2: Orientation decoding of cardinal and oblique gratings. A) The stimulus set comprised
Cartesian gratings with orientation 0° to 150° in steps of 30°, and had two phase exemplars with a half

16

cycle phase shift (not shown), as in Experiment 1. Pair-wise classifications were grouped by 1) orientation
angle disparity Δθ (30°, 60° and 90°, color-coded in red, green and blue, respectively), and 2) the presence
of at least one cardinal (C) or only oblique (O) orientations. B) Time-resolved orientation decoding for each
Δθ (solid lines, left y-axis), and difference in orientation decoding between cardinal minus oblique cases for
each Δθ (dotted line, right y-axis). Orientation was robustly decoded for all angle disparities (also see Table
1B). There was no evidence for stronger decoding of cardinal over oblique orientations. Gray vertical line
and lines below plots same as in Figure 1(N=16, p<0.05 cluster definition threshold, p<0.05 cluster
threshold).

Experiment 1 showed that coarse-scale activation differences through stimuli of cardinal
orientations are not necessary for orientation decoding. However, it did not address the
potential contribution of coarse-scale effects when cardinal orientations are being
decoded. If cardinal orientations are encoded differently, this could result in MEG
patterns favoring classification of cardinal orientations.

In experiment 2, Cartesian gratings with two cardinal angles (horizontal 0° and vertical
90°) and four oblique angles (30°, 60°, 120°, and 150°) were presented to 16 participants.
We performed time-resolved orientation decoding across all possible pairs of gratings
(Fig. 2A).

We first determined whether MEG data allows discrimination of grating orientations
different by less than 90° for any phase. We found that orientation differences even as
low as 30° were decodable (solid lines in Fig 2b; onset and peak latency in Table 1B).
We then compared classification performance for the cases when decoding involved
oblique gratings only, versus at least one grating with cardinal orientation (denoted ‘o’

17

and ‘c’ in Fig. 2A respectively). By subtracting decoding accuracy of oblique from
cardinal cases, we found no evidence for differential encoding between oblique and
cardinal orientations (Fig. 2B, dotted lines, right y-axis). Note that equivalent results were
obtained in a cross-classification analysis by assigning opposite phases to the training and
testing sets (Table 1B).

In sum, the results of experiment 2 complemented the ones of experiment 1 in two ways.
First, they showed that MEG signals contain orientation information at least as low as
30°. Second, by failing to provide evidence for differential encoding of cardinal and
oblique orientations, they suggest that even for cardinal orientations the role of the
cardinal bias in decoding orientation is small, if any.

3.3 Experiment 3: Edge orientation in radially balanced logarithmic spirals
is decodable from MEG signals

18

FIGURE 3: Orientation decoding of radially balanced stimuli. A) The stimulus set comprised four
exponential spirals in two opposing directions and two phase exemplars having a half cycle phase shift in
phase. At any point, the stimuli of opposing directions were orthogonal to each other (90° disparity).
Importantly, at any point the disparity of spiral orientation to a radial line was 45 ° (+/– for the different
directions), thus balancing the radial component. B) Time course of orientation decoding in three cases: the
classifier training and testing sets comprised grating stimuli of the same phase, different phase, or any
phase. Spiral direction (orientation) was robustly decoded in all analyses (for details see Table 1C). There
was no evidence for the representation of phase (classifier training and testing sets had the same
orientation). Gray vertical line and lines below plots same as in Figure 1. (N=13, p<0.05 cluster definition
threshold, p<0.05 cluster threshold).

Experiment 3 was designed to address a second potential orientation-specific coarse-scale
bias: the radial bias. The radial bias is the differential representation of orientations
collinear with a line through the point of fixation (radial line) (Sasaki et al., 2006;
Mannion et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 2011; Alink et al., 2013). For example, in the above
experiments oblique +45° gratings might activate stronger cortical regions representing
the upper right and lower left rather than the upper left and lower right quadrants of the
visual field. Oblique -45° gratings would have an opposite bias.

To control for radial bias, we presented participants with radially balanced logarithmic
spirals (Mannion et al., 2009) turning in two opposing directions (Fig 3A). The stimuli
were designed such that at any point spirals of opposing direction are oriented orthogonal
to each other, just as Cartesian gratings of 90° disparity. Note that the disparity of
exponential spirals with respect to a radial line is exactly 45° (+ or – depending on the
turning direction), thus balancing the radial component of the stimulus.

19

We conducted multivariate pattern classification as in experiment 1, by restricting the
training and testing sets to have grating stimuli of same phase, different phase, or any
phase. Results were similar as above: robust decoding of orientation in all analyses, and
no evidence for decoding of phase (Fig. 3B; Table 1C).

In sum, experiment 3 showed that the orientation of radially balanced stimuli was
robustly discriminated by visual representations, excluding a coarse-scale retinotopic bias
as a likely source of orientation signals observed with MEG.

3.4 Experiment 4: Edge orientation is decodable from MEG signals
independent of grating shape and thus stimulus edge effects

FIGURE 4: Orientation decoding of gratings with different shape outlines. A) The stimulus set
comprised gratings +/–45° (here shown –45°). The type of stimulus shape outline (circle or ellipse) is
indicated with a sketch below each stimulus. B) Ice cube model output for the above experimental stimuli.
The ice cube model produced outputs with subtle edge artifacts: elongation in the direction of the grating,

20

and compression in the orthogonal direction. As a result, stimuli with a shape outline of a circle produced a
model output with a shape outline of an ellipse. C) Experimental approach to evaluate the influence of edge
artifacts on orientation decoding. A classifier is trained to distinguish orientation based on grating stimuli
of a circular outline shape (but ellipsoidal model outline shape), and tested on grating stimuli with an
ellipsoidal outline shape. If the model output is relevant in decoding (deformation by edge effects), the
classifier will have poor performance because the shape of model output conflicts with orientations. D)
Decoding results on ice-cube model output. We found that for shape deformations of 2% or more, the
classifier predicted orientation incorrectly. Thus, if the ice cube model is correct and if edge effects
determine empirical orientation decoding of gratings, classification of orientation from MEG data across
grating shapes should result in near 0 decoding accuracies. In contrast, high decoding accuracies would
indicate that local orientation is the relevant factor, and edge artifacts are unlikely to explain orientation
decoding from MEG data. E) Classification of MEG responses indicated neural representations robust even
to large changes in grating outline shape. Gray vertical line and lines above plots same as in Figure 1.
(N=12, p<0.05 cluster definition threshold, p<0.05 cluster threshold).

Grating stimuli are spatially limited with annulus boundaries that induce edge effects
dependent on the orientation of the stimulus. In particular, a perfect ice-cube model of
primary visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959, 1968) with no bias in the number of
neurons representing different orientations can still account for orientation decoding
(Carlson, 2014). This is because the representation of an exact circular grating is in fact
an ellipse elongated in the direction of the grating, and compressed in the orthogonal
direction. Thus, signals differentiating the orientation of stimuli might actually originate
from the differential location of those edge effects (see simulations in Matlab language in
Text S1). To evaluate the influence of such edge effects, we created a stimulus set of
Cartesian gratings shaped as ellipses elongated in the direction opposite to the one
predicted by the model (Fig 4A). If the model prediction is valid, training a classifier to

21

discriminate orientation in circular and testing on ellipsoidal gratings should significantly
compromise the classifier performance. If however the source of orientation signals in
MEG is independent of edge effects, the classifier should correctly predict the orientation
even for heavily distorted grating shapes.

Based on our modeling simulations (Fig. 4A-D), grating stimuli distorted above ~2%
should result in opposite orientation decoding if the model accurately predicts V1
decoding. Therefore, our stimulus set consisted of phase-randomized gratings of +/–45°
orientation in shapes ranging from perfect circles to ellipses of 2, 5, 10 and 20%
distortion (Fig 4A). We then trained a classifier to distinguish orientations for circular
gratings, and tested on ellipsoidal gratings (Fig. 4E, Table 1D). Training and testing on
circular gratings provided a baseline control. We observed that even very strong
deformations of the annulus by as much as 20% of the radius did not compromise robust
orientation classification, countering the prediction of the perfect ice-cube model.

These results indicate that coarse-scale edge effects as predicted by the ice-cube model
are not necessary for robust orientation decoding, and that orientation signals can be
robustly read out from MEG data independent of the overall shape of the stimulus.

3.5 Experiment 5: Edge orientation in stimuli with similar global form is
decodable from MEG signals

FIGURE 5: Influence of global form on orientation encoding. A,B) The stimulus set comprised oblique
gratings (same as experiment 1) and radially balanced exponential spirals (same as experiment 3) in both
intact and patch-swapped forms. Whereas intact stimuli differed both in local orientation and global form,
patch-swapped stimuli differed only in local orientation. C) Time course of orientation decoding for intact
and patch-swapped gratings and spirals. Orientation was discriminated by visual representations in all
conditions (for details see Table 1E). D) Comparison of classification between intact and patch-swapped
stimuli. Gray vertical lines and lines below plots same as in Figure 1. (N = 12, p<0.05 cluster definition
threshold, p<0.05 cluster threshold).

23

Gratings and spirals are coherent stimuli that differ not only in local orientation, but also
in global form. For example, an intact grating at +/–45° may look like a coherent object
rotated to the left or right, eliciting global form related signals at a coarse-scale level
(Alink et al., 2013). To dissociate local orientation from global form, it is necessary to
compare brain responses to stimuli that differ in local orientation but not global form.
Such stimuli can be created by patch-swapping intact stimuli (gratings or spirals) in nonadjacent regions defined by a polar checkerboard array, as in (Alink et al., 2013).

Experiment 5 presented intact and patch-swapped gratings and spirals to 12 participants
(Fig. 5A). Stimuli were the same as in Experiments 1 and 3, and their patch-swapped
variants. To control for the additional edges introduced by the swapping, lines of
background color covered the patch edges for all stimuli. Classifiers were trained to
discriminate orientation of all stimuli irrespective of phase (any phase, Fig. 5C).

Corroborating experiments 1-4, we found that MEG signals contained information about
orientation of intact gratings and spirals (Fig. 5C, black curves, solid for spirals, dotted
for gratings; for details on onsets of significance and peaks see Table 1E). Crucially,
MEG signals contained information about patch-swapped variants of spirals and gratings
as well (Fig. 5C, gray curves, solid for spirals, dotted for gratings). This indicates that
global form differences are not necessary for decoding of orientation from MEG signals.

Comparing decoding accuracy of patch-swapped with intact stimuli, we found a
significant decrease for gratings with an onset at 95ms (80-117ms) and a peak at 133ms

24

(116-141ms), but no difference for spirals (Fig. 5D, black curve for gratings, gray for
spirals; for details see Table1E).

In sum, these results indicate that global form influences orientation encoding in cortex,
but is not necessary for orientation decoding. They further reveal the time at which global
form first influences orientation encoding for grating stimuli.

3.6 Experiment 6: Simulated neuronal activation patterns at a spatial scale
comparable to orientation columns are decodable from modeled MEG
signals under realistic noise conditions

25

FIGURE 6: Decoding of simulated random patterns differing at columnar-level spatial scale in
human V1 from MEG sensor data. A) Refined triangulated mesh of V1 cortex with an average node
distance of 880 µm (s.d. = 279 µm) comparable to the diameter of orientation columns in human. B) Two
example random activation patterns of simulated columnar-level neuronal activity in V1 (top), and

topographies shown in B. D) Decoding random activity patterns of V1 activity at different SNR levels.
Decoding accuracy was 96.1% when SNR was equal to experimental data, and decayed gradually for lower
SNR levels.

We conducted a simulation experiment to test whether the physics of MEG can support
the conjecture that orientation information may originate from V1 cortical patterns at the
spatial scale of orientation columns. MEG has a coarse spatial resolution, which is highly
non-uniform and in the order of several millimeters on the visual cortex (Hämäläinen et
al., 1993; Darvas et al., 2004). The elemental model sources of MEG signals are current
dipoles oriented normally to the cortex and neighboring current dipoles are too close to
be resolved if they are parallel to one another. However, due to the highly convoluted
nature of the cortical manifold, neighboring current dipoles are rotated in space thus
producing distinct magnetic fields. Two activation patterns on cortex that differ on the
scale of orientation columns would therefore give rise to different magnetic field
topographies outside the head. Orientation information represented on the scale of
orientation columns might as a result be resolvable with multivariate MEG methods
given the complex folding pattern of cortex.

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated whether simulated random activation patterns in V1,
differing at the spatial scale of columns, could be discriminated by the corresponding

26

MEG sensor patterns when signal strength and noise were equated to empirically
measured data. The simulation was based on a triangulated surface of the V1 cortical
sheet with an average node distance of 880 µm (s.d. = 279 µm), comparable to the
diameter of orientation columns in human (Yacoub et al., 2008) (Fig. 6A). We generated
neuronal activation patterns on the V1 surface by assigning random activation values to
each node (Fig. 6B), and then computed the corresponding MEG sensor level signals by
forward modeling. These simulated MEG measurements had overall similar
topographies, but with weak differences (Fig. 6BC). The data was scaled to match the
range of measured data, and sensor-level Gaussian noise was then added at various
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

We used multivariate pattern classification to discriminate different V1 activation
patterns from the noisy instantiations of MEG sensor signals. We found that simulated
V1 patterns were discriminated with 96.1% accuracy from MEG sensor patterns when
adding sensor-level noise at the same SNR level as the experimental data (Figure 6D).
For lower SNR levels, decoding accuracy declined gradually.

These modeling results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of discriminating activation
patterns in V1, differing at the spatial scale of cortical columns, from MEG signals.

DISCUSSION

We investigated the bound on the spatial scale of neuronal activation patterns from which
information can be decoded from MEG signals. Our analysis focused on decoding of
contrast edge orientation, a visual feature known to be encoded in fine-scale neuronal

27

activation patterns in V1. In five empirical experiments we found that MEG signals
contained orientation information even when controlling for factors known to induce
coarse-scale activation in V1, such as overrepresentation of particular orientations,
boundary interaction effects between background and stimulus, and global form-related
signals. Theoretical modeling demonstrated the feasibility of discriminating signals at the
spatial scale of orientation columns from MEG data under realistic noise conditions.
Taken together, our results show that neural signals at the level of cortical orientation
columns are accessible by electrophysiological measurements in humans, and likely
subserve orientation decoding. This result has wide implications for the interpretation of
studies using MEG and multivariate pattern classification, suggesting that any type of
information encoded in the human brain at the level of cortical columns should be
accessible by MEG.

4.1 Non-invasive electrophysiological signals in humans carry information
about orientation
Most recent studies investigating orientation encoding in the human brain have used
fMRI (Haynes and Rees, 2005; Kamitani and Tong, 2005; Mannion et al., 2009, 2010;
Kriegeskorte et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2011, 2013; Alink et al., 2013; Carlson, 2014;
Carlson et al., 2014; Pratte et al., 2014), and only a few studies used non-invasive
electrophysiological methods (Campbell and Maffei, 1970; Duncan et al., 2010;
Koelewijn et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2013). However, using an electrophysiological
method such as MEG offers new insights not possible with fMRI. MEG is not
confounded by interpretative complications posed by the complex relationship between
neural activity, BOLD contrast, and voxel sampling (Haynes and Rees, 2005; Kamitani

28

and Tong, 2005; Mannion et al., 2009, 2010; Kriegeskorte et al., 2010; Freeman et al.,
2011, 2013; Alink et al., 2013; Carlson, 2014; Carlson et al., 2014; Pratte et al., 2014).
Importantly, it allows resolving the precise timing of orientation encoding in the order of
milliseconds, impossible with fMRI due to the sluggishness of the BOLD response. This
allows timing-based dissociation of first-pass responses in early visual regions from
possibly more distributed responses that may involve feedback information. Our study
decoded orientation directly from neural activity in millisecond resolution.

Previous electrophysiological studies investigating orientation decoding used adaptation
(Campbell and Maffei, 1970) or decoding in frequency space (Duncan et al., 2010;
Koelewijn et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2013), providing a temporal resolution of 25ms at
best. Recently, a study employed multivariate pattern classification to resolve the time
course of orientation encoding of Cartesian gratings in millisecond resolution (Ramkumar
et al., 2013). Our experiments build upon those studies by clarifying the nature of the
sources of orientation-selective signals in noninvasive electrophysiological methods. By
controlling for possible stimulus confounds that could induce coarse-scale activation
patterns in V1, our results indicate that orientation information in MEG signals originates
from the spatial scale of cortical columns.

Note that our analysis framework does not allow us to unequivocally localize signal
sources to V1 only, and not to other cortical areas such as V2 and V3 (Haynes and Rees,
2005; Kamitani and Tong, 2005) that have been shown to encode orientation or global
form (Ostwald et al., 2008; Seymour et al., 2010). However, we observed orientation-

29

selective MEG signals starting already ~50ms after stimulus onset. This short latency is
consistent with the latency of V1 spike time in monkeys (Schmolesky et al., 1998;
Bullier, 2001; Mormann et al., 2008) and the C1 component in the visual event-related
brain potential (Jeffreys and Axford, 1972; Clark et al., 1994; Russo et al., 2003), and
inconsistent with a large contribution of other cortical areas with longer spiking latencies,
as well as feedback processing. This suggests that the observed MEG signals, at least in
their early phase, likely originate in V1. Further studies that would localize MEG
components to V1 based on subject-specific cortical surfaces reconstructed from MRI
might yield corroborative evidence.

Complementing the experimental results, our modeling experiment demonstrated the
theoretical feasibility of discriminating activation patterns in V1 differing at the spatial
scale of cortical columns from MEG signals. Despite the low spatial resolution of MEG,
the highly folded V1 cortex around the calcarine fissure gave rise to distinct and
decodable magnetic fields outside the head. Conventional MEG modeling approaches
consider either a small number of focal cortical sources, or cortically distributed source
models with extended but similar activity in cortical patches (Baillet et al., 2001). Our
results show that distributed sources of high spatial structure are also resolvable with
MEG in folded areas of the cortex.

In total, our results indicate that MEG potentially can distinguish edge orientations based
on signals originating at the level of orientation columns. This sets the stage for a direct
investigation of edge orientation in the human brain, a fundamental visual property.

30

Further, our results have implications for the interpretation of MEG studies using
multivariate pattern classification in other visual contents, such as objects (Carlson et al.,
2013; Cichy et al., 2014; Isik et al., 2014). Although for complex objects coarse-scale
activation pattern differences are expected (Op de Beeck et al., 2008), a contribution of
signals at the level of cortical columns (Fujita et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1996) should also
be considered.

4.2 How strong is the cardinal and radial bias?
When stimuli are not balanced in their cardinal or radial components, how strong can this
influence orientation decoding from MEG data? Concerning the cardinal bias, experiment
2 unexpectedly did not reveal any differences in decoding for cardinal versus noncardinal orientations. This suggests that the cardinal bias has weak influence in
orientation decoding. Note however that existing studies on the neural basis of the
cardinal effect have been mixed. Using fMRI and MEG in humans, some studies reported
stronger (Zemon et al., 1983; Moskowitz and Sokol, 1985; Furmanski and Engel, 2000;
Yang et al., 2012), others reduced (Serences et al., 2009; Mannion et al., 2010; Swisher et
al., 2010) responses to cardinal orientations, or both depending on timing (Koelewijn et
al., 2011). While many studies have found or postulated larger population sizes for
neurons tuned to cardinal orientations (21–23, 45–49), others have indicated large
variability across subjects (Chapman and Bonhoeffer, 1998). Finally, the behavioral
effect itself is complex and dependent on factors, such as context of the oriented edges
and eccentricity (Essock et al., 2003, 2009; Westheimer, 2003, 2005; Hansen and Essock,
2004), suggesting that the neural effect may also be strongly dependent on particular
stimulus parameters.

31

Concerning the radial bias, findings from experiment 3 are consistent with a possible
contribution of coarse-scale radial bias signals to orientation decoding: classification
accuracy for gratings (radially unbalanced) was higher than for spirals (radially balanced)
in all experiments (Sasaki et al., 2006; Carlson et al., 2013). A direct comparison of
gratings and spirals however is not possible, as radial gratings change stripe width with
eccentricity, while Cartesian gratings do not. Differences in decoding accuracy might
instead reflect cortical differences in spatial frequency sensitivity varying with
eccentricity (Sasaki et al., 2006). Finally, a recent fMRI study observed coarse-scale
biases for spirals of different turning direction, questioning the validity of logarithmic
spirals as a proper control for coarse-scale activation biases (Freeman et al., 2013).
However, the reported results may be influenced by edge-related artefacts (Carlson,
2014), and may be crucially dependent on particular analysis choices (Pratte et al., 2014).
In general, future MEG studies that address any newly observed coarse-scale biases by
proper stimulus material will be necessary to test the relative contributions of fine- and
coarse-scale sources of orientation decoding.

4.3 Orientation signals in MEG are not explained by edge-related effects
Previous research has suggested that interaction effects at the boundary between
background and oriented grating stimuli might carry information about orientation
(Carlson, 2014). Controlling for these effects in experiment 4 did not abolish robust
orientation decoding from MEG signals. Thus, although edge related effects might have
biased previous studies, they are not necessary for orientation decoding from MEG
signals, and unlikely to produce large effects for commonly used stimulus configurations.

32

4.4 Global form influences orientation encoding, but is not necessary for
orientation decoding
What is the source of the global form effects on orientation encoding? An fMRI study
that found global form influences in orientation encoding in early visual cortex proposed
three possibilities (Alink et al., 2013): a) feedback from inferior temporal cortex, b)
attentional spread along Gestalt criteria, and c) contextual modulation effects. Our MEG
results can tentatively differentiate between those alternatives by timing: global form
effects can originate only from a neuronal process with an earlier onset, and should have
comparable peak latency. Intracranial recordings in inferior temporal cortex have shown
that global form modulates neural activity with short onset latency (~80ms), but with late
peak responses at ~200ms (Brincat and Connor, 2006), which is at odds with the earlier
peak latency observed here. Attentional spread along Gestalt criteria has been observed in
V1 with an onset latency of approximately 330ms (Wannig et al., 2011), strongly
inconsistent with the onset of global form effects. However, contextual modulation
effects in V1, which occur with an onset latency of 100ms and peak latencies of 150ms
(Lamme, 1995; Zipser et al., 1996), are consistent in timing with our findings.

4.5 Conclusions
We found that MEG signals allowed decoding of contrast edge orientation as early as
~50ms. Importantly, corroborating evidence from 5 experiments indicated that this
information originates from spatially fine patterns in orientation columns, since decoding
was possible even when controlling for multiple known confounds known to induce
coarse-scale activation in V1, such as overrepresentation of particular orientations,
boundary interaction effects between background and stimulus, and global form-related

33

signals. Our V1 modeling study further demonstrated the feasibility of decoding
information encoded at the spatial scale of cortical columns. Generalizing from this
evidence, any information encoded in the human brain at the level of cortical columns,
and not only contrast edge orientation, should in principle also be accessible by
multivariate analysis of electrophysiological signals.
