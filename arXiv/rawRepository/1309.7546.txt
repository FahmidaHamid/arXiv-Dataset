Abstract
A quantum model on the chemically and physically induced pluripotency in stem cells is proposed.
Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow variables (molecular torsions)
slaving fast ones the conversion from the differentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the
quantum transition between conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an
analytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the rate on the number of
torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate can be estimated by comparison with
protein folding. The reaction equations of the conformational change of the pluripotency genes in
chemical reprogramming are given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is
calculated and the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition rate on
physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape of the coherent domain
is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that by decreasing the coherence degree of some
pluripotency genes a more effective approach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.

Introduction
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were firstly generated by Yamanaka in 2006.
They isolated four key pluripotency genes Oct-3/4, SOX2, c-Myc and Klf4 essential
for the production of pluripotent stem cells and successfully transformed human
fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells with a retroviral system [1]. The genomic
integration of the transcription factors limits the utility of this approach because of the
risk of mutations being inserted into the target cell’s genome. However, recently Deng
et al reported in July 2013 that iPSC can be created chemically without any gene
modification [2]. They used a cocktail of seven small-molecule compounds to induce
the mouse somatic cells into stem cells (which they called Chemically iPSC or CiPSC)
with a higher efficiency up to 0.2%. On the other hand, Su et al reported iPSC can be
created directly through a physical approach [3][4]. They indicated that the sphere
morphology helps maintaining the stemness of stem cells and proved that, due to the
forced growth of cells on low attachment surface the neural progenitor cells can be
generated from fibroblasts directly without introducing exogenous reprogramming
factors (we call it Physically iPSC or PiPSC). The stimulus-triggered acquisition of
pluripotency was proposed tentatively and retracted soon [5,6]. More rigorous
experiments with larger statistics on the physical effects on stem cells and the
physically-induced pluripotency are awaited for. On the other hand, although many
achievements in stem cell experiments have been made, from the point of theory, the
mechanism for the chemically-physically iPSC is still one of the most puzzling and
confusing problems to be understand. We shall give a quantum theory regarding the

acquisition of pluripotency and make an estimate on the probability of the conversion
rate. The CiPSC reported in [2] will be quantitatively analyzed and calculated in more
detail. Based on the discussion of the factors influencing the conversion a new model
of physically-induced pluripotency will also be proposed .
The fundamental processes in CiPSC include small molecules CHIR, 616452,
and ESK interacting with key pluripotency-related genes Sall4 and Sox2 to enhance
their expression in the early phase to activate the chemical reprogramming, and then
small molecule DZNep (as a epigenetic modulator) interacting with gene Oct-4 to
enhance its expression in the late phase to switch the process[2]. It is reasonable to
suppose that when the small-molecule compounds are bound to the pluripotency gene
it causes a sudden change in the molecular conformation (or shape) of the gene,
namely a leap (quantum transition) from one of the torsional minima to the another of
the molecule [7]. The same story runs in PiPSC. In the PiPSC the three-dimensional
(3D) sphere formation is the only important factor to promote the reprogramming
without involvement of any exogenous genes, RNAs, proteins or even small
molecules. It was speculated that 3D sphere cultures may provide a microenvironment
to promote cell dedifferentiation or reprogramming [3]. The further studies indicated
the overexpression of gene Sox2 in 3D sphere culture plays a key role in the
reprogramming event [4]. So it is natural to assume that certain conformational
changes of Sox2 and other genes may have happened in the reprogramming.
Therefore, both CiPSC and PiPSC can be studied on the same foot by using the theory
of molecular conformational change recently proposed by us [7].

A quantum model on the induced pluripotency
Model Consider the CiPSC system including a key pluripotency-related gene
as a macromolecule and some small molecules interacting with it. The PiPSC can be
defined as well when the small molecules are switched off. Apart from 6 translational
and rotational degrees of freedom the bond lengths, bond angles, torsion (dihedral)
angles of the macromolecule and the coordinate of small molecules relative to the
gene and the frontier electrons form a complete set of microscopic variables to
describe the system. Among these variables the torsions are slow and others are fast.
Following Haken’s synergetics, the slow variables always slave the fast ones.
Torsion vibration energy is 0.03-0.003 ev, the lowest in all forms of biological
energies, even lower than the average thermal energy per atom at room temperature
(0.04 eV in 25°C); the torsion angles are easily changed even at physiological
temperature. Moreover, the torsion motion has two other important peculiarities. First,
due to the strong dependence of the Shannon information quantity on oscillator
frequency, the torsion vibration may play an important role in the transmission of
information in the biological macromolecular system. Second, different from
stretching and bending the torsion potential generally has several minima with respect
to angle coordinate that correspond to several stable conformations. We have proved
that the small asymmetry in potential (which does exist for a real macromolecule)
would cause the strong localization of wave functions and the localized quantum

conformational state can well be defined for a biological macromolecule. Therefore,
the molecular conformation is defined mainly by the torsion coordinate. After
conformation defined through torsion, the quantum transition between conformational
states can be calculated.
By the adiabatically elimination of fast variables we obtain the Hamiltonian H’
describing the conformational transition of the gene. The matrix element of H’
between quantum conformational states, namely between differentiation state k
k  | H  | k . Then the transition rate

and pluripotency state k ' , is denoted by
k | H  | k

where H N is the slow variable Hamiltonian and the slow variables include the

generally small and can be neglected), H F is the fast variable Hamiltonian and the
fast variables include the bond stretching / bending, the electronic variables and the
coordinates of the small molecule relative to the gene.

Because Eq (4) is not a rigorous eigenstate of Hamiltonian HS + HF, there exist
transitions between adiabatic states that result from the off–diagonal elements [9]

Eqs (7-9) give the rate of gene conformational transition in CiPSC. As the
small-molecule variables not appearing in Eq (1), the same equations deduced above
describes the rate of gene conformational transition in PiPSC.
Eqs (7-9) are introduced for calculating the transition from differentiate to
pluripotent state. In principle, it holds equally well for the reverse process, from
pluripotent to differentiate states. The rate of the reverse process is obtained by the
replacement of G by G and  ' (  ) by  (  ' ) in W (k  k ') .

We assume differentiation state k has lower conformational energy (in torsion
ground-state) while pluripotency state k’ has higher conformational energy (in torsion
excited-state). Therefore, due to G <0, the acquisition of pluripotency is a smallprobability event as seen from Eq(10).

More statistical analyses on protein folding and generalization to
pluripotency transition The rate formula Eqs(7)-(9) are deduced from very general
assumptions on molecular conformational change. They were tested on the protein
folding problem. The statistical analyses of 65 two-state protein folding given in [10]
shows these formula are in good accordance with experimental rates [11]. For a
two-state protein the torsion number N is calculated by the numeration of all
main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles on the polypeptide chain. Typically N
takes 100 – 300 for a typical two-state protein. To apply these formula on the
pluripotency conversion in stem cells one should study the conformational change of
the gene. For a pluripotency gene the DNA chain contains alternating links of
phosphoric and sugar (deoxyribose) and every sugar is attached to a nitrogen base.
Following IUB/IUPAC there are 7 torsion angles for each nucleotide, namely

 ( O 3' P O 5 ' C 5 ' ) ,
 ( P O 5' C 5C'
4 '),
 ( O 5' C 5C' 4 ' C 3 ' ) ,
 ( C 5' C 4 ' C3 ' O 3 ' ) ,
 (C 4 ' C 3 ' O3 ' P ) ,
 ( C 3' O 3 ' P O 5 ' )
and

 (O4' C1' N1  C2) (for Pyrimidine) or  (O4' C1' N9  C2) (for

Purine), of which many have more than one advantageous conformations (potential
minima). So DNA molecule contains more torsion degrees of angles than a protein.
Although it is no problem from the theoretical point that Eqs(7)-(9) can be used as
well for DNA, we should study the torsion number dependence of the
conformation-transition rate.
From Eqs(7)-(9) we find the main dependence factors of the rate is the free
energy decrease (per molecule between initial and final states) G and the
2

fast-variable factor a ( the square of the matrix element of the fast-variable
Hamiltonian operator H F changing with torsion angle averaged over M modes).
We shall study how these two factors depend on the torsion number N . For protein
folding or other macromolecular conformational change not involving chemical
reaction and electronic transition the fast variable includes only bond lengths and
bond angles of the macromolecule. In this case a simplified expression for the
'

fast-variable factor I E can be deduced. Consider the globular protein folding as a
typical example. Suppose the coherent transition area of the molecule is a rotational
ellipsoid with semi major axis a and semi minor axis b, and a ( x,  ) a constant in
the ellipsoid. The matrix element of the stretching-bending Hamiltonian is

Eqs (7) to (9) are the fundamental equations for quantum transition in CiPSC
and PiPSC. The key points in the above deduction lie in the definition of the
differentiate and pluripotent state in terms of conformational state and the
application of adiabatic approximation (slaving principle) to deduce the general
transition formula between them. Eq(18) can be used for the estimate of how the rate
changes with N in different processes. The important thing is: In spite of the various
complex pathways in the cell’s development both CiPSC and PiPSC have the same
quantum conformational transition as a key step in the reprogramming of stem cells.
Moreover, the stability of quantum state gives a natural explanation on the
maintenance of the stemness of stem cells.

Chemically induced pluripotency discussed in quantum model
Pluripotent stem cells were successfully induced from mouse somatic cells by
small-molecule compounds [2]. The schematic diagram (Fig 2) taken from [2]
illustrates the stepwise establishment of the pluripotency circuity during chemical
reprogramming. There are seven pluripotency genes, namely Oct4, Sox2, Nanog,
Sall4，Sox17, Gata4 and Gata6, involved in the circuitry.

Fig 2 The diagram is taken from literature [2]. The schematic diagram illustrates the
pluripotency circuity during chemical reprogramming. CHIR(C), FSK(F), 616452(6) and
DZNep(Z) are small molecules. Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Sall4，Sox17, Gata4 and Gata6 are seven
genes involved in the pluripotency circuitry establishment.

Assume only the torsion transition of single gene is considered. For gene
interaction A

B in Fig 2, we assume a conformational transition from

torsion-ground to torsion-exited state of gene A (or gene B) in companion of gene B
(gene A), namely,

A B

where star * after a gene means its torsion-excited state. Following Fig 2 the
reaction equations of the conformational change of seven genes are written below.
The first 3 equations describe the conformational transition of pluripotency genes
under the action of small molecules CHIR(C), FSK(F), 616452(6) and DZNep(Z).
The next 7 equations describe the conformational transition under gene interaction.

The pluripotency circuitry is divided into three sub-circuits: circuit a of
small-molecule reaction 1 to 3; circuit b, including reaction 4 to 8 from Sall4 to Gata 4
(Gata6,Sox17) to Nanog then in the reverse direction to Sall4 as seen from Fig 2; and

The relaxation times, Eq(22), depends not only on rate ki but also on concentration ci.
The characteristic time  a (28.1)

is in consistency with the experimental data

of pluripotent stem cells generated at a frequency up to 0.2% on day 30-40 [2] if we
notice that more time is needed for post-transitional steps after the quantum transition
to acquire the fully reprogrammed cell. On the other hand we notice that only after
switching to 2i-medium the transitions in cicuit b speed up and  b   a . As  b is
neglected the total pluripotency transition time  equals

   a b  c   a  c   a
consistent with experiment.
Remarks

(29)

1

The above calculation shows the pluripotency transition time is in the order of
several days to weeks, much longer than the protein folding time. The reason is
the coherence degree N in DNA torsion transition much larger than that in
protein folding.

2

The transition time  b is about 150  a in absence of 2i medium. The time
needed for full reprogramming would be too long if  b has been taken into

3

4

5

account. However, introduce of 2i medium in circuit b can effectively shorten
the total pluripotency transition time. Notice that the 2i medium introduced in
reaction step 8 only influences the single torsion transition of Nanog gene in
companion of Gata 4, Gata6 and Sox17, but has nothing to do with the same
transition of Nanog in companion of Oct4 and Sox2 in circuit c.
In circuit b and circuit c the single torsion transition is in double directions. The
reverse transition from torsion-excited to ground state is much faster (Eq 27) and
it provides a positive feedback mechanism to the network.
Work [2] introduced small-molecule interaction to activate the pluripotency
genes. It is expected that the pluripotency transition may be speeded up by
improving the small-molecule interaction. However, the present theory gives a

lower limit for the pluripotency transition in CiPSC, namely  limit   c 
153
Above points 1-4 are obtained irrespective of parameter choice. The only
adjustable parameters in the theory are cDNA and q but they occur in the
combination of cDNA-5.5lnq. The parameter q means the average number of
torsions in each nucleotide. The upper limit of q is 7 for a single chain, so the
choice of q=6 or 5 seems reasonable because a part of torsional potentials have
only one minimum. The parameter cDNA is related to the free energy G in the
transition. We have assumed cDNA  c prot  2 Apt which is in the correct range of

6

free energy change. Of course, one may use alternative parameter choices but
remains cDNA-5.5lnq unaltered to obtain a reasonable result.
We have discussed the rate of the acquisition of pluripotency from the quantum
transition theory. The transition rate calculated above is for single torsion
transition only. In reality the pluripotency can be acquired in multi-torsion
transitions, for example, by the equation of gene interaction

A B

A *  B * . However the rate of multi-torsion transitions is much

lower than the single ones and they can always be neglected.

Physically-induced pluripotency inferred from the quantum theory
We shall study the physical factors influencing the rate of the acquisition of
pluripotency from the quantum transition theory. The important dependence factors

of the rate inferred from the theory are:
1. Transition rate depends on temperature
Assuming the free energy decrease G in pluripotency genes is linearly
dependent of temperature T as in protein folding we obtain the temperature
dependence of the transition rate from Eq 7 to 9,

ln W (T ) 

S
1
 RT  ln T  const.
T
2

(30)

It means the non-Arrhenius behavior of the rate–temperature relationships. The
relation was proved in good agreement with the experimental data of protein folding
[7][11]. For a typical two-state protein the folding rate changes (increases or
decreases) 2- to 7-fold in a temperature range of 40 degrees. Now we predict the
same relation also holds for the reprogramming transition for the pluripotency gene. .
2.

Transition rate depends on PH
Following the biochemical principle the free energy change G of a reaction is
linearly dependent on the logarithm of ion concentration [H+]. One has

G ( G ) 0

 2.3 (7  PH)
k BT
k BT
where (G ) 0 is the standard free energy change at PH 7,

(31)

  O(1) . Inserting it

into Eq (7-9) we obtain
d
(32)
ln W (PH)  0 (for G  0)
dPH
When PH decreases from 7 to 6 (or to 5, to 4..) the logarithm rate increases a
quantity

 ln W  1.15 

2.3 G
(
)  1.15
 N k BT 0

(33)

(or  2.3, 3.45…) or the rate increases by a factor 3.16 (or 9.97, 31.5…). It
means one may observe the acidity-induced pluripotency by soaking the tissues in
acidic medium below PH 6.0.
3. Transition rate depends on volume and shape of the coherent domain
As seen from Eq (18) the transition rate is strongly dependent of the coherence
degree N of the gene. One may assume that the coherence degree is proportional to
the volume V of the coherent domain in the gene. Therefore, from Eq (18) one has
a
W (V ) fV 5 . 5 e x p (
)
(34)
V
(a>0 is a V-independent constant).

Eq (34) means W (V ) grows as V decreases (in

a
). To lower down the coherence volume of the pluripotency gene a
5.5
simple method is trituration of the sample under appropriate constraint.
the range V 

The protein folding rate is dependent of the shape of the protein. The folding rate
for a two-state protein having a quite oblong or oblate ellipsoid shape is several
tenfold higher than a spheroid shape [7][10]. This can be seen by the shape
parameter f appearing in Eq (13). The shape parameter is another important factor
to measure the coherence degree and influence the transition rate. As compared with
spheroid the sphere morphology will benefit taking a larger coherence degree N and
therefore a smaller transition rate. On the other hand, Le Chatelier’s principle states
that if a stress is applied to a reaction at equilibrium the equilibrium will be displaced
in the direction that relieves the stress. The shape of the cell as a stress applied to the
microenvironment of the pluripotency gene will influence the equilibrium of the cell
[3][4].
Based on the above analyses we propose a physically induced pluripotency
circuitry as shown in Fig 3. The main pluripotency circuitry is established through
the cycle of Oct4-Sox2-Nanog and the latter is connected to pluripotency genes X
and Y. The genes X and Y are activated through their torsion transitions under the
action of physical factors. The reaction equations are

(physical factor)+X→X* (rate kX）
(physical factor)+Y→Y* (rate kY）
Nanog+Sox2

Nanog*+Sox2（rate k8, k8’ ; companion Sox2 can be

replaced by Oct4 or their excited states, or Y*）
Oct4+Nanog

Oct4*+Nanog

(rate k9, k9’ ; companion Nanog can

be replaced by Sox2 or their excited states, or X* )
Sox2+ Nanog

Sox2*+ Nanog

(rate k10, k10’ ; companion Nanog can

be replaced by Oct4 or their excited states )
As an example, suppose X=Sall4 and Y=Sox17. Assume the volume and shape
of coherent domain of both genes are changed under physical action. As a result,
both the torsion numbers of Sall4 and Sox17 decrease a factor λ. The total
pluripotency transition time of the assumed circuitry is

 =  XY   c

(35.1)

where

 c is given by Eq(28.3) and

The smaller the factor λ is the larger the rates kX and kY will be. When

Fig 3 The schematic diagram illustrates the physically-induced pluripotency. The physical
factor lowers down the coherence degrees in the torsion transition of the gene X and Y and then
establishes the pluripotency conversion in the cycle of Oct4-Sox2-Nanog .

To conclude, we have shown the physical factors such as temperature and acidity
can change the rate of torsion transition. So, low PH exposure and heat shock may
have observable effect in the pluripotency conversion. However, we found the most
effective approach to increase the torsion transition rate is to lower down the
coherence degrees of the gene. Based on the proposed model the physically induced
pluripotency transition rate can, in principle, increase more than 150 times as
compared with that in the known small-molecule induction approach.
