The quantum network model with real variables is usually used to describe the excitation energy
transfer (EET) in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) complexes. In this paper we add the quantum
phase factors to the hopping terms and find that the quantum phase factors play an important role
in the EET. The quantum phase factors allow us to consider the space structure of the pigments. It
is found that phase coherence within the complexes would allow quantum interference to affect the
dynamics of the EET. There exist some optimal phase regions where the transfer efficiency takes its
maxima, which indicates that when the pigments are optimally spaced, the exciton can pass through
the FMO with perfect efficiency. Moreover, the optimal phase regions almost do not change with
the environments. In addition, we find that the phase factors are useful in the EET just in the case
of multiple-pathway. Therefore, we demonstrate that, the quantum phases may bring the other two
factors, the optimal space of the pigments and multiple-pathway, together to contribute the EET in
photosynthetic complexes with perfect efficiency.

INTRODUCTION

Photosynthesis provides chemical energy for almost all
life on Earth. The initial step of photosynthesis involves
absorption of light by the so-called light-harvesting
antennae complexes, and funneling of the resulting
electronic excitation to the photosynthetic reaction
center. Recent work has reported that quantum theory
governs the exciton transfer in some light-harvesting
complexes that harness the absorbed energy with almost
100% efficiency [1–7]. The experimental evidence [2–6]
showing long-lived quantum coherences in this energy
transport in several photosynthetic light harvesting complexes suggests that coherence may play an important
role in the function of these systems. These observations
have generated considerable interest in understanding
the possibly functional role of quantum coherence effects
in the remarkably efficient excitation energy transfer in
photosynthetic complexes.
The experimental achievements have motivated a number of theoretical works [8–30] that consider the photosynthetic complex as a quantum system, and try to
analyze the basic mechanisms that explain the phenomena observed in the experiments. A full quantum dynamic framework becomes necessary for studying coherent energy transfer. Typical quantum theories are,
the quantum network model [8–20], the hierarchic equation [21–24], the generalized Bloch-Redfield [25] equation, the renormalization group methods [26], and the
mixed quantum-classical method[30]. Some recent theories [31] can even successfully predict the long-lived quantum coherent phenomenon. However, all these models
cannot describe the space distribution of the pigments.

As we know, the space distribution of the pigments is
very important for exciton energy transfer and the experimental evidence also shows that the optimized space
distribution of the pigments is one factor for prefect energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes [2, 3]. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a quantum model in which
the space distribution of the pigments is considered.
In this paper, we set up a quantum network model
by adding the quantum phase factors to the two-body
interactions to describe the exciton (the energy carrier)
transfer in the FMO complex. The quantum phases are
determined by the spatial structure of the pigments in
photosynthetic complexes, such as the length of the pigment, the barriers and the distance between pigments.
The quantum network in the absence of the phase factors has been used to study the EET in the photosynthetic complexes[8–18]. Some interesting results, such as
noises may enhance the EET, and the EET in a quantum model may be larger than that of a classical model,
are obtained. Compared with those studies, we find that
the newly added quantum phase factors play a key role
in the EET and there exist optimized phases at which
the transfer efficiency is maximal. Furthermore, we find
that the phase factors affect the EET just in the form
of the phase difference in a closed loop. Although there
may be many phase factors in the coupling terms of the
system Hamiltonian, only Np − 1 are independent variables where Np is the number of pathways. This conclusion stems from the fundamental property of a quantum
phase: only a gauge invariant phase is observable, while
quantum phase accumulated in a closed path is such an
invariant. As for Np pathways, there exist Np − 1 closed
paths. So it is implied that multiple-pathway in FMO
complexes is a necessary condition for the enhancement
of the EET by the quantum phases. It provides a strong
evidence to support the statement that the multiple energy delivery pathway is also an acceptable contributing
factor for perfect energy transfer[2, 3]. Therefore, we

2
demonstrate that, the quantum phases may bring the
other two factors, the optimal space of the pigments and
multiple-pathway, together to contribute the EET in photosynthetic complexes with perfect efficiency.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we
present the complex quantum network we used to study
the EET in photosynthetic complexes. A particularly
simple and illustrative example with three sites of complex network is presented in Sec. III, where some main
conclusions, such as the phases may play an important
role in the EET and the optimized phases are insensitive to the environments, are demonstrated in this very
simple example. In Sec. IV, we present a symmetric complex quantum network with Np pathways to show that
the multi-pathway is also a contributing factor for the
perfect efficiency of the EET. In Sec. V, we investigate
the EET in FMO with our complex quantum network
model. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Sec. VI.

where σj+ and σj− are the raising and lowering operators
for site j. σj+ =|jih0| and σj− =|0ihj|, where |0i represents the zero exciton state of the system and |ji denotes
the excitation at site j. The site energy and two-body
coupling strength are given by the real numbers ǫj and
Vjl , respectively. The quantum network[32] described in
Eq.(1) has been used to study the EET in photosynthetic
complexes in much literature [8–17].
In this paper, we add a quantum phase factor e−iφjl
with φjl a real number to the hopping term between
sites j and l. The phase factor is determined by the
detailed structure of the quantum network. As for FMO,
the phases are related to the length of the pigments as
well as the intrinsic features of the barriers between the
adjacent pigments. In this case, the Hamiltonian (1) is
replaced by

is an excitation state which describes an excitation localized at site 1 (or several sites). We are interested in the
transfer rate that the excitation transfers from the input
state to the sink. The quantum evolution of the network

Compared with the quantum network with real variables
in Eq(1), this model can be named as a complex quantum
network model. We will show that the quantum phase
factors play the fundamental role in energy transfer of
the photosynthetic complexes.
As usual, we assume that all sites are susceptible simultaneously to two distinct types of noise processes. The
first one is a dissipative process that transfers the excitation energy in site j to the environment with rate Γj ,
which leads to energy loss. The second one is a pure dephasing process with rate γj which destroys the phase coherence of any superposition state in the system. The dissipative and the pure dephasing processes are described,
respectively, by the Lindblad super-operators [9–11],

BIPATHWAY QUANTUM NETWORK

2 is to study quantum transport in a system of three sites.
The exciton is transferred from site 1 to site 3 through
two pathways, and finally is trapped by the sink with
rate Γs . Sites 1, 2, and 3 are susceptible simultaneously
to the dissipative and the pure dephasing processes. The
dynamics of the system can be described by Eqs. (2-7).
If we choose ǫ1 = ǫ2 = ǫ3 = ǫ, V12 = V23 = V13 = V ,
Γ1 = Γ2 = Γ3 = Γ, γ1 = γ2 = γ3 = γ, the analytical
expression of Psink (in the Appendix) can be obtained

To study the role of the phase in quantum network, a
particularly simple and illustrative example shown in Fig.

Psink =

V 4 Γs [A2 V 4 sin2 φ − AV Γ(DB 2 + AV 2 ) sin φ + BD(DΓB 2 + ACV 2 )]
,
A2 V 6 (3Γ + Γs ) sin2 φ + G

where the phase difference φ = φ12 + φ23 − φ13 , G =
(DΓB 2 + ACV 2 )[DΓ(Γ + Γs )B 2 + C(2ΓΓs + γΓs +
3DΓ)V 2 ], A = 3Γ + Γs + 3γ, B = 2Γ + Γs + 2γ,
C = 3Γ + Γs + 2γ, and D = Γ + Γs . Note that the
corresponding analytical expression of Psink for the real
coupling rates is obtained in Ref. [8]. Although there
are three phase factors φ12 , φ23 , and φ13 in this threesite network, it is notable that only the phase difference
φ = φ12 + φ23 − φ13 is independent. It demonstrates the
fact that only the phase difference accumulated in the
two pathways ( pathway 1 → 2 → 3 and pathway 1 → 3
) affects the interference at site 3.

FIG. 2: (Color online) The schematic representation of a bipathway quantum network. The exciton is transferred from
site 1 to site 3 through two pathways, and finally is trapped
by the sink with the rate Γs .

From Eq. (8), we can easily find that Psink always
increases with V , while it always decreases with Γ. However, Psink is not a monotonic function of γ and Γs . We
plot the dependence of Psink on the different parameters
in Fig.3.
Figure 3(a) shows the relation between Psink and γ
for different values of φ. For φ = 0, there exists an optimal value of γ at which Psink is maximal, which indicates
that the dephasing from the noise may even facilitate the
EET. Note that the similar conclusion is extensively reported in the previous works [9, 10, 16]. When the phase

(8)

φ is considered, the phase can change the efficiency remarkably at low dephasing (purely quantum mechanical),
while the efficiency is not sensitive to the phase at large
dephasing (quantum coherent destroyed). Therefore, the
phase in EET plays a key role at low dephasing.
Figure 3(b) shows the dependence of the transfer efficiency Psink on the trapping rate Γs for different values of
φ. When Γs is very small, the system couples weakly to
the sink, few exciton can reach the sink and the efficiency
tends to zero. When Γs is too large, the trapping rate
Γs mismatches the transport rate of the exciton in the
quantum network, thus the efficiency also goes to zero.
Therefore, there exists an optimal value of Γs at which
the efficiency takes its maximal value.
Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show the efficiency Psink as a
function of the phase φ for different values of γ and Γ,
respectively. It is found that there are two optimal values (about π/2 and 3π/2) of φ at which Psink takes its
extremum value, especially, it reaches a maximum value
at 3π/2. The minimal value of Psink appears at φ ≈ 0 , π
and 2π. Obviously, the maximal values of Psink are due
to the constructive interference, while its minimal values
are due to the destructive interference. Interestingly, the
phases which correspond to the extremal values of Psink
almost do not change with γ and Γ.
Therefore, we can conclude that quantum phase in
the two-body couplings plays a key role in the EET, especially at low dephasing. Remarkably, the optimized
phases in the quantum network are almost independent
of the environments (γ and Γ).

.

For simplicity, we consider a symmetric complex quantum network including Np pathways shown in Fig. 4.
The exciton is transferred from site I to site F through
multiple pathways, and finally is trapped by the sink. Np
describes the number of pathways between the sites I and
F . The dynamics of the system can also be described by
Eqs. (2-7). From Eqs. (2-7), we can obtain the efficiency
Psink for different number Np of pathways.

Figure 5 shows the dependence of the transfer efficiency Psink on the phase φ for different number Np
of the pathways. For a symmetric network, we choose
ǫj = ǫ, VIj = VF j = V , Γj = Γ,γj = γ, j = 1, 2, 3...Np .
There are Np − 1 independent phases because of Np − 1
closed loops in the system. For simplicity, we only vary
φI1 (= φ) and the other phases are set to zero. For a
single pathway (Np = 1), the efficiency Psink is always
equal to 0.695, this is due to the fact that no quantum
interference can occur in a single pathway. For double
pathways (Np = 2), the quantum interference at site F
occurs and the phases take effect. Due to the destructive
interference, there exists a minimal value of the transfer efficiency at φ = π. The efficiency Psink takes its
maximal value at φ = 0 or 2π, where the constructive interference occurs. The efficiency of multiple pathways
at constructive interference has an enhancement compared with the single pathway. As the number of the

5
pathways increases, the effects of destructive interference
on the efficiency decrease. We here have assumed that
all other phases in Np > 3 pathways are zero. If we
further optimize those phases, the enhancement by the
multiple-pathway is clearer. It supports the conclusion
in the quantum scattering model[28] where the resonance
transport is enhanced in multiple-pathway. Therefore,
the multiple-pathway can reduce the destructive interference and facilitate EET in the quantum network. It
seems that most local minima or maxima occur at multiples of π/2, but the accumulated phases for local minima
or maxima are the multiples of π/2 only when all pathways are the same. The quantum interference at the
given site is determined by the accumulated phase in the
multiple pathways. When all pathways are the same, the
constructive interference and the destructive interference
occur at φ = 0, π, 2π, respectively. However, when the
pathways are not the same, the interference in the closed
pathways becomes complicated. The phase conditions
for the constructive interference and the destructive interference depend on the system parameters, such as the
site energy, the coupling strength, and the number of the
sites in each pathway.
Note that the similar findings are also found in Ref.[30].
They defined an effective hopping rate as the leading order picture and nonlocal kinetic couplings as the quantum correction and found that the optimized multiple



pathways can suppress the destructive interference in
nonlinear network configurations. Although the model
and the method are different from ours, the impact of
closed paths on the transport are the same in nature.

EXCITATION ENERGY TRANSFER IN FMO
COMPLEX

The architecture of antenna light-harvesting complexes
varies widely among photosynthetic organisms. A wellstudied example is the water-soluble FMO complex of
green sulfur bacteria. FMO complex essentially acts as
a molecular wire, transferring excitation energy from the
chlorosomes, which are the main light-harvesting antennae of green sulfur bacteria, to the membrane-embedded
reaction center. The FMO is a trimer made of three
identical subunits, each containing seven pigments[34].
Because the inter-subunit coupling is vanishingly small,
we only consider the dynamics of EET within one subunit. The subunit containing seven pigments shown in
Fig. 6(a) can be modeled as a network of seven sites
with site dependent coupling and site energies. We use
the experimental Hamiltonian of FMO given in [33], and
the matrix of the Hamiltonian takes the form

with units of cm−1 and a total offset of 12230cm−1 to
set the lowest site energy to zero for convenience (This
overall shift in energy does not affect the dynamics of
the system). In units with h̄ = 1, we note that the rate
1ps−1 ≡ 5.3 cm−1 . By neglecting the couplings weaker
than 15 cm−1 (only bold entries in the Hamiltonian are
considered) in this model Hamiltonian, the transport in
an individual monomer of FMO can be mapped to a
quantum network shown in Fig. 6(b).
However, the Hamiltonian in Eq.(9) may not be sufficient to describe the EET in the FMO. We here focus on the possible effects of the newly added phase
factors in the coupling terms. From Eq. (2) and Fig.
6(b) we can find that there are eight phases, φ12 , φ23 ,
φ34 , φ45 , φ47 , φ56 , φ67 , φ16 , but only two phase differences, φ1 = φ61 + φ12 + φ23 − φ67 − φ74 − φ43 and
φ2 = φ67 + φ74 − φ65 − φ54 , which are independent since

there are just two independent closed loops. Therefore,
without loss of the generality, we vary the phases φ12 and
φ67 and the other phases are set to zero in our numerical
simulations.
The initial state for our simulation is a superposition
state localized at pigments 1 and 6 which are close to
the chlorosome antenna (donor). It can be written as
|Ψ(0)i = α|1i + β|6i with |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Pigment 3
is the main excitation donor to the reaction center. The
energy trapping rate from pigment 3 to the center in the
literature [9–11] ranges from 1 ps−1 to 4 ps−1 . In our
calculations, we chose Γs = 20/1.88 cm−1 corresponding
to about 2ps−1 . The measured lifetime of excitons is of
the order of 1ns which determines a dissipative decay rate
of 0.5/188cm−1. Unless otherwise noted, we choose Γ =
0.5/188cm−1 and γ = 0.01Γ in this paper and assume
that Γ and γ are the same for each site. From Eqs. (2-

7), we can numerically obtain the efficiency Psink of the
EET in FMO complex for different cases.
Figure 7(a) and (b) shows the phase dependent efficiency for different dephasing
and dissipative rates with
√

φ67 = 0 and α = β = 2 . It is found that there exist
two optimal values of φ12 (e. g. φ12 ≈ π/2 or 3π/2)
at which the transfer efficiency Psink takes its maximal
value. When the dephasing rate γ or dissipative rate Γ
varies, the shape of the curve in Fig. 7 almost does not
change, which indicates an important feature that the optimized phases are not sensitive to the environment. The
phases denote the distance between the pigments and the
barriers between pigments, which are determined actually by the spatial distribution of seven pigments. When
the pigments are optimally spaced, the exciton can pass
through FMO with optimal efficiency. Therefore, the
phases from the two-body interactions play a key role
in energy transfer of the FMO complex.
Figure 8 shows the dependence of the transfer efficiency
Psink on the phases φ12 and φ67 for different initial states.

difference ∆P between the maximal efficiency Psink
and

∆P = 0.1432 for Fig. 8 (c) (α = 1, β = 0). Obviously,
the phase can cause a significant change in the efficiency
and the change just slightly depends on the initial states.
The role of the phase coherence is to overcome local energetic traps and aid efficient trapping exciton energy
by the pigments facing the reaction center. In this case
we can still find that there exist some optimal phase re-

gions where the transfer efficiency takes its maxima. The
optimal phase regions only slightly vary with the initial
states. Therefore, we demonstrate that the phase plays
a significant role in the EET and the optimal phase can
facilitate the energy transfer in THE FMO complex.
The experimental evidences [2, 3] show that besides
the optimal space distribution of the pigments, the multiple energy delivery pathway is another acceptable contributing factor for perfect energy transfer. Therefore,
it is necessary to study the role of the multiple pathways in our model. In Fig. 9, the efficiency of one
pathway is compared with that of the multiple pathways.
It is found that the transfer efficiency Psink gets a significant enhancement when the number of the pathways
increases. The efficiency is only 0.6425 for a single pathway, while it can reach 0.8 for multiple pathways. Remarkably, the efficiency in the full FMO (case III) even
at destructive interference is larger than that in a single
pathway (case I). This suggests that the dephasing noise
in the system destroys the destructive interference and
thus opens both paths for the transport [8, 10]. This
result supports the conclusion in the quantum scattering model[28] where the resonance transport is enhanced
in multiple-pathways. Therefore, we can conclude that
multiple pathways can also facilitate EET in the FMO
complex which agrees with the experimental statement
[2, 3].

can ensure that the quantum coherence occurs in the optimal spatial distribution. In addition, we also find that
multiple pathways can facilitate EET in the FMO complex. Therefore, we can conclude from the studies of the
complex quantum network model that, the optimal space
distribution of the pigments, the multitude of energy delivery pathways and the quantum effects, are combined
together to contribute to the perfect energy transport in
FMO complexes.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper, we have investigated the efficiency of the
EET in FMO complexes by adding the quantum phase
factors to the quantum network model. The phase describes the length of the pigments, the distance, and the
barriers between pigments and is then determined by the
space distribution of the pigments. We found that the
optimal distribution of the pigments can lead to the high
efficiency of the EET. Moreover, the optimal phase is
not sensitive to the environments. If the distribution of
the pigments is optimized, the efficiency always takes its
maximal value, which is indeed significant for high transfer efficiency. As we know, the biological system governed

In this paper we just add the phase factors phenomenally to the two-body couplings in the Hamiltonian (9).
Qualitatively, the quantum phases are determined by the
spatial structure of the pigments in photosynthetic complexes; however, how to determine them quantitatively
in a microscopic theory or from the experimental measurements is an important open question which deserves
further study.
Though we only have studied the transport process
through the FMO protein, the methods and conclusions
can be extended to other photosynthetic light-harvesting
complexes. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism
of efficient energy transfer in natural light-harvesting systems can help develop low-cost and highly efficient manmade solar energy apparatuses, including photovoltaic
devices and artificial photosynthesis.

Since the exciton is transferred from site 1 to site 3,
the initial conditions are

and the other density matrix elements ρij = 0.
The system of coupled differential equations can converted into a set of algebraic equations via the Laplace
transform. The above equations can be rewritten by the
following set of equations for the Laplace s-domain variables, for ρe11

[34] An additional (the eighth) pigment was recently discovered in each subunit. However, we ignore this pigment
since the eighth pigment is only loosely bound and it
usually detaches from the others when the system is isolated from its environment to perform experiments, see
Ref.[35]. In addition, the main conclusions obtained here
are essentially the same for both eight and seven pigments.
