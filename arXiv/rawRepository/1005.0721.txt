Abstract
Bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) are an essential component of all biological systems, forming a
functional barrier for cells and organelles from the surrounding environment. The lipid molecules
that form membranes contain both permanent and induced dipoles, and an electric field can induce
the formation of pores when the transverse field is sufficiently strong (electroporation). Here, a
phenomenological free energy is constructed to model the response of a BLM to a transverse static
electric field. The model contains a continuum description of the membrane dipoles and a coupling
between the headgroup dipoles and the membrane tilt. The membrane is found to become unstable
through buckling modes, which are weakly coupled to thickness fluctuations in the membrane. The
thickness fluctuations, along with the increase in interfacial area produced by membrane buckling,
increase the probability of localised membrane breakdown, which may lead to pore formation.
The instability is found to depend strongly on the strength of the coupling between the dipolar
headgroups and the membrane tilt as well as the degree of dipolar ordering in the membrane.

INTRODUCTION

When amphiphilic lipid molecules are dissolved in solution, the molecules can selfassemble into a bilayer structure with the hydrophilic headgroups of the molecule shielding
the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails from the surrounding water. Many biological processes
and components that occur in the cell depend on the membrane: membrane-bound proteins,
endo/exocytosis, lipid rafts and ion channels are just a few examples [1]. The many different
species of lipid found in a cell membrane share the same general structure: a polar headgroup
attached to a non-polar hydrocarbon tail region. When a bilayer lipid membrane (BLM)
forms, the non-polar tails make up the core of the membrane, with the dipolar headgroups
forming the membrane surface [2]. Both parts of the molecule react to electric fields. When a
strong electric field is applied transversely across a membrane, reversible electric breakdown
can occur. The breakdown is characterised by an increase in the measured conductivity
due to the rapid increase in the transit of ions across the membrane [3, 4]. This increase
in permeability is attributed to the development of transbilayer pores [5], which may close
upon removal of the electric field, allowing the membrane to recover. This phenomenon has
been termed electroporation [6, 7].
The theoretical work on electroporation and electrical breakdown can be viewed as belonging to two distinct branches: one approach uses the Smoluchowski equation to describe
the evolution of a distribution of pores with an assumed energy for pore formation [8–16]. A
density of pores are modelled drifting through radius space as function of time, generated by
a source term including the effect of the field. This method has been successful at predicting
pore radii, lifetimes and densities, but does not model the mechanism of pore formation [7].
A different approach is required to understand how pores form and what membrane properties inform this process. The simplest approach is to coarse-grain the BLM to a continuum
membrane driven unstable by an electric field. Early work by Crowley [17] modelled the
hydrocarbon core of the membrane as a dielectric slab with finite shear modulus and finite
elastic compressibility, but estimates a critical transmembrane voltage an order of magnitude
larger than experimental values [7]. The model of Lewis [18] also models the membrane as
a dielectric slab, but includes a Maxwell stress tensor which relates the dielectric constant
to strain in the membrane, however also finds a critical transmembrane voltage larger than
those experimentally reported [6], similar to Crowley.
2

These models neglect the fluid bilayer structure of the membrane, and thus neglect important mechanical properties such as a vanishing shear modulus and the bending rigidity.
The Helfrich-Canham Hamiltonian and its variants [2] are frequently used to model conformational changes to the membrane. Sens and Isambert [19] adapted these methods and
considered the minimisation of the difference between the stressed and unstressed areas of a
membrane in an electric field. The authors imposed a force from the electric field on an undulating membrane and calculated the unstable undulatory wavelength and corresponding
growth rate, although the model used neglects any thickness variation in the membrane. The
stochastic thermal undulations proposed as a mechanism for pore formation by Movileanu
et al. [20] are hindered by a large energy barrier (91kB T ) and neglect the effect of the field
on the membrane. Membranes are only nm in thickness and the process of membrane breakdown under electric fields occurs over short time scales, which makes experimental study of
pore formation difficult.
Molecular dynamics (MD) studies of membranes have been used extensively to study the
electrical behaviour of membranes [21–24]. These simulations provide molecular-level detail
on a picosecond time scale. However MD can only simulate a very small area of membrane
for a short time. The transbilayer pores opened during electroporation can last for up to
ms [6] before closing, which MD simulations cannot capture. Experimental studies range
from measurement of the transmembrane current [25, 26] to conductivity measurements
using salt-filled vesicles [27]. Recent developments in video microscopy and fluorescence
have enabled the direct visualisation of giant unilamellar vesicles exposed to an electric field
[28–30], in which pores can be directly observed.
In this work, we develop a comprehensive, mesoscopic analytical approach, which includes a mechanical coupling between the orientation of the dipole on the surface and the
membrane surface tilt. This should destabilise the membrane as the headgroups seek to
align with the field, rather than shield the hydrophobic core of the membrane from the surrounding fluid, which is their equilibrium position. As the headgroups tilt, the membrane
will tilt to try to restore the equilibrium position, which can introduce an instability in the
membrane not noted previously in the literature. We study this instability by performing a
linear stability analysis of the free energy. This perturbative approach will not capture the
inherently discontinuous process of pore formation, but will predict the onset of instability
in the membrane. The instability occurs through deformational modes involving thickness
3

fluctuations in the membrane, which increases the probability of localised breakdown and
therefore of pore formation. Applying a field to the membrane breaks the up/down symmetry of the membrane therefore it is important we include a description of the bilayer which
allows each monolayer to be independently deformable.
In Section II we construct the free energy including terms associated with mechanical
deformation and introduce the description of the dipolar headgroups. Section III presents
the qualitative analysis of the model, Section IV presents results from numerical calculations,
and we conclude the paper and discuss possible future work in Section V.

MODEL
A.

Geometry

We consider a planar bilayer lipid membrane suspended horizontally in water with an
electric field applied such that the field is perpendicular to the unperturbed membrane
surface. The membrane is modelled as a dielectric, fluid membrane at zero tension with
a non-zero area stretching modulus. The generalised three-dimensional (3D) free energy is
given in Appendix A, but to illustrate the basic principal and obtain analytically tractable
solutions we assume a one-dimensional modulation in the x direction (Figure 1).
Here h± denote the positions of the upper (+) and lower (-) membrane surfaces, t± is
the thickness of the upper and lower membrane leaflets, t0 is the unperturbed monolayer
thickness, and s is the displacement of the dividing surface between the monolayers.

Conventional free energy

We construct a phenomenological free energy per unit area. The first contribution is the
energy associated with mechanical deformation of the membrane;

Here κA is the area compressibility modulus, κb is the bending rigidity, γ is the surface

respect to the x direction. These terms are equivalent to those used by Huang in [31], and
4

FIG. 1: (a)An unperturbed bilayer, (b) the bilayer following a deformation.

have been adapted from the Helfrich-Canham Hamiltonian. The surface tension in our model
is not equivalent to a frame tension, which acts in the bilayer midplane. Instead, it restricts
variation in interfacial area of each leaflet separately and hence can describe peristaltic
deformations. The area compressibility term allows the two monolayers that form the bilayer
to be independently deformable [32]. This has a strong effect on the relaxational dynamics
of the membrane, but in the static case considered here these deformations will equilibrate
effectively instantaneously, meaning we can minimise over s at this stage without loss of
generality. [Note that the large bending modulus (κb ≈ 10 kbT ) precludes renormalisation
of these elastic constants [33].]
We also include the dielectric energy fd :

Here ǫ0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum, Em is the field in the membrane, and ǫm
and ǫw are the dielectric constants of the membrane and water respectively. E± is the field
at the upper (+) and lower (-) membrane surface. L is the upper and lower limit of the
system. The form of Eq. (2) implies the field will cause a uniform compressive force on
the membrane. This ‘electrostrictive’ force has been found to have a quadratic dependence
on the applied transmembrane voltage and has a small effect (∼ 1% fractional thickness
5

change) for the voltages used here [34–36].

C.

Dipolar Headgroups

The dipolar headgroups of the lipids are defined by a three dimensional vector p;
p = pz + m
= p cos (θ) êz + m,

(3)

where p = |p|, θ is the angle the dipole makes with the z direction, êz is the unit vector in
the z direction and m is a vector representing the in-plane dipole moment. The value used
for p is the effective magnitude of the headgroup dipole moment, calculated by Raudino and
Mauzerall [37], which includes the screened charges and conformation of the headgroup.
In an unperturbed bilayer lipid membrane, the headgroup of each phospholipid molecule
lies at an average angle of θ0 to the membrane normal, hinged about the uppermost carbon
atom [38]. This natural tilt of the headgroup arises from a balance between the dipole-dipole
interactions, the shape of the molecule and the need to shield the non-polar hydrocarbon
chains from the water. We perturb about the equilibrium position:
θ± = θ0± + δθ±
where
θ0+ = θ0
θ0− = π ± θ0

(A and B) .

The dipolar orientations between the two leaflets are weakly coupled by the Coulomb
interaction, which prefers antiparallel orientations. In principle this degree of freedom allows
for rich phase behaviour and dynamics. Since the dipole orientation is coupled to the applied
field, the relative orientation of the dipoles on the upper and lower membrane leaflets will
affect the membrane behaviour under an electric field. Here we consider only parallel and
antiparallel orientations. We refer to the case of the dipoles pointing in opposite directions as
antisymmetric (A), and the case where the dipoles point in the same direction as symmetric
(B), as shown in Figure 2.

Here κp is the dipole-membrane coupling modulus and êx is the unit vector in the x direction.
This term is inspired in part by the work of Lubensky, Chen and MacKintosh in [39–41],
and explicitly penalizes change in dipole orientation relative to the membrane surface tilt.
So far p and m have referred to a single dipole. To treat larger membrane areas, we
extend these to continuum variables: p becomes a dipole moment density pe (dipole moment

per unit area, with dimensions Cm−1 ). We coarse-grain m into m ≡ hmi, the average

orientation of dipoles within a small area. To distinguish between changes in orientation of
the dipoles and changes in alignment within the coarse-grained area, we separate m into
7

two components; a unit vector m
b = m/ |m|, representing the average orientation and an

amplitude m
e = |m|, which represents the degree with which dipoles within the given area

point along m.
b If all the dipoles within the area point along m,
b then m
e = 1. If m
e = 0

then the dipoles within the area are completely disordered. As we are considering a onedimensional modulation in the x direction we can set m
b = êx and allow m
e to vary. We write

m
e as an equilibrium value m
e 0 , and the deviation δ m
e ± , from this equilibrium value.
m
e± = m
e 0 + δm
e ±.

The equilibrium value m
e 0 arises from a competition between the dipole-dipole interactions
and their thermal fluctuations. We allow δ m
e ± to vary independently between the leaflets.

Changes in dipole alignment are penalised by a susceptibility χm , leading to the free

energy density

antisymmetric case (A)
(7)
symmetric case (B),

where we have assumed equal fields in the upper and lower water regions, E+ = E− = E.
Here we have also assumed that the field acting on the dipoles is equivalent to the field
at the membrane surface, not the field in the membrane core, which differs by two orders
of magnitude. The dipoles are in an aqueous environment which is very different from the
hydrocarbon core of the membrane [18]. The relative dielectric constant of bulk water is
8

≈ 80, whereas for the membrane interior it is ≈ 3. The field is assumed to only act between
the two membrane surfaces hence the effect of ionic screening can be neglected. Here θ±
refers to an average tilt angle within the region of coarse graining.
Now that the free energy has been constructed, it can be subjected to a linear stability
analysis. This will predict the onset of a static instability in the membrane. In an experimental system, the instability is complicated by the dynamics of the surrounding fluid
(likely to contain many ions, particularly near the membrane surface) and by the dynamics
of the bilayer itself, which behaves as a two-dimensional fluid. To capture the dynamical
behaviour of the instability predicted by our model, we would need to include both the
hydrodynamic flows of the fluid and membrane [32, 43] and the movement of charges in the
solution [44, 45]. These are both non-trivial extensions due to the explicit definition of the
dipoles in our model Eq. (4-7) and hence beyond the scope of this paper.

The system has six remaining degrees of freedom; δ m
e ± , ∆, Σ, u and h̄. We minimise f

over the dipolar tilts ∆ & Σ. The minimised values of these tilts are given in Appendix C.
To quadratic order, the resulting free energy for the symmetric and antisymmetric case is
identical. Figure 3 shows the dipole configurations for the bilayer & peristaltic modes. The
variables u and h̄ are expanded as small perturbations about the flat state;
u = u0 + δu

h̄ = h̄0 + δ h̄

(9)

where
∂x u0 = 0

∂x h̄0 = 0.

The equilibrium value of the peristaltic mode u0 includes the electrostrictive thinning implied
by Eq. (2).

The free energy will then consist of f0 u0 , h̄0 and the perturbation δf δu, δ h̄ . The

flat state f0 u0 , h̄0 describes the membrane after the application of an electric field in the

absence of undulations. We expand the perturbation to second order in δ h̄, δu and δm± .

The dimensionless parameters reference all energies to the membrane bending energy κb .
The dimensionless potential φ compares the strength of the field on the dipoles with the
membrane bending rigidity. For φ ≪ 1, we would therefore expect the system to be stable
as the bending rigidity will be much stronger than the field on the dipoles. We predict that
the system will only become unstable for φ ≈ O (1) where the strength of the field on the
dipoles can overcome the bending rigidity. The effect of the field through φ is regulated by
σp ; the two terms appear concurrently in Eq. (14). This is because σp controls the way the
membrane ‘feels’ the field through the dipole-membrane coupling Eq. (4).

The membrane is unstable when any of the eigenvalues become negative. The associated
eigenvectors êλ determine how much the bilayer (h̄q ), peristaltic (uq ) and dipole alignment
(δm±

Analytical Features

We can gain some qualitative information about the membrane stability by analysing
the fluctuation free energy, Eq. (14). The dimensionless parameters σA , σs , σp , σχ and σc
13

represent the effects of the area compressibility, surface tension, dipole-membrane coupling,
dipole alignment and dipole alignment-membrane coupling on the free energy, scaled by the
bending energy. The typical values for these ratios, calculated using the parameters given in
Table I, are given in Table II. Since σA > 1, the membrane is more susceptible to bending
than compression. The ratio σp controls how the membrane ‘feels’ the applied electric field
through the dipoles, as it contains both the dipole-membrane coupling modulus κp and the
average dipole alignment m
e 0 . Since this ratio σp is typically < 1, this effect is dominated
by membrane bending. The ratio containing the surface tension, σs , which using the values

of the parameters in Table I is < 1. This will cause the membrane to bend with surface

gradients rather than surface curvature.
The model should be stable (δfq ≥ 0) for a flat membrane (q̂ = 0). For zero field (φ = 0)
and in the limit q̂ → 0, the thickness variations (peristaltic modes uq ) are penalised by the
area compressibility σA , while the bilayer modes vanish. Since uq is stabilised against small

changes in q̂, we expect the instability to progress via bilayer h̄q modes. If we consider

only the bilayer modes, the instability occurs when the term proportional to q̂ 2 , which can

be considered to be an effective surface tension, changes sign:
φc = σp



1
1 + σp /σs

 12

.

(17)

The critical potential φc is therefore approximately proportional to the ratio σp [53]. The
ratio σp contains two important independent parameters: κp , the strength of the dipolemembrane coupling and the average dipole alignment m
e 0 . The membrane is stabilised upon

increasing either κp or m
e 0 . Increasing κp ‘stiffens’ the dipoles against movement away from
their equilibrium position, while increasing m
e 0 increases the proportion of dipoles within a
membrane patch that are aligned along the x axis and therefore constrained by Eq. (6). As
reducing m
e 0 lowers φc , we can infer that an instability is more likely to occur in a membrane
region in which the dipoles are disordered (i.e. m
e 0 is smaller). The generalised 3D version

of this term considers the orientation of the dipole in the complete plane, rather than just
the x-direction, which could describe two dimensional modulations. We expect this to be
energetically more costly at the onset of instability [39].
For the values used given in Table II (σs = 0.20, σp = 0.23), φc ≈ 0.15 which is equivalent
to a voltage drop of 0.22V across the membrane. This simple qualitative estimate gives

values for the critical potential that are close to the experimentally reported range of (0.214

1V) [6]. The inclusion of the coupling between the bilayer and peristaltic modes should
raise the critical potential by transferring energy from the bilayer modes into the peristaltic
modes.

NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS
Parameters

All the parameters used to obtain these results are given in Table I. The upper portion
of the table contains the parameters that have been obtained from experimental studies,
whereas those in the lower portion are not accessible by current experiments. Those parameters that cannot be experimentally measured have either been estimated from physical
reasoning (χm , γc and m
e 0 ) or extrapolated from simulation results (κp ). Of these constants,

we expect only κp to have a significant effect on the stability of the membrane due it being
present in Eq. 17. The estimate of κp comes from the distribution of dipole angles obtained
by Böckmann et al. [38]. The authors perform MD simulations of lipid bilayers and measure
the angles formed between the dipole of the lipid headgroup and the surface normal. This
result has been produced in other studies, using different simulation methodologies [46, 47].
We assume the width of this distribution is governed by one degree of freedom and then calculate the stiffness with which the dipole hinges around the equilibrium position, assuming
it bends as a Hookean spring.

B.

Eigenvalue stability

Figure 4 shows the eigenvalue associated with the bilayer modes h̄q . As the rescaled
potential φ is increased, the eigenvalue λbq decreases. For φ = 0.21 the eigenvalue has a
significant negative portion indicating that φ has passed through the point at which the
membrane first becomes unstable. For this unstable value of φ the instability begins at
q̂ = 0 and reaches a lowest value at q̂ = 0.6, which corresponds to peak to peak spacing
of 26nm. The eigenvalue associated with the peristaltic undulations uq behaves identically
to the eigenvalue for h̄q , but has a y-intercept of 2σA , hence this branch will never become
unstable for q̂ ∈ [0, 1]. The membrane can therefore become unstable only through the
bilayer modes of undulation, as suggested in the previous section. While this is not an

a

The dipole-membrane coupling modulus, κp , was generated from the distribution of headgroup angles

given in [38]. The width of this distribution was assumed to be to be governed by one degree of freedom.
This estimate is then multiplied by the number of lipids per unit area, nlip (∼ 1019 lipids/m2 ) [1].
b

The dipole alignment susceptibility, χm , was estimated as χm ∼ kb T nlip , due to the entropic cost of

constraining the dipole alignment
c
The functional form of σc compares the dipole alignment-membrane coupling strength γc with the bending
rigidity κb . As the effect that Eq. (6) regulates is not seen experimentally, we can assume that γc < κb .
However the range of γc is chosen in order to provide examples where γc > κb as well as the physically
expected range.

The range of the dipolar alignment m
e 0 used was judged to be a reasonable estimate of the degree of dipole

alignment in a membrane.

obvious route to transmembrane pore formation, bilayer modes have been observed to play
an important role in MD simulations of electroporation [23], as well as occurring in the
theoretical model of Sens and Isambert [19].
The locus of instability as a function of q̂ and φ is shown for two values of σp in Figure 5(a).
For σp = 0.23 the membrane becomes unstable at the critical potential of φc = 0.16. This
corresponds to a voltage drop across the membrane of roughly 0.24V, which is in the range of
values (0.2-1V) for the onset of electroporation seen in both experiments [28] and simulations

[22]. This is slightly higher than the qualitative estimate obtained in the previous section.
The instability in our model is likely to be relieved by a change of state of the membrane. The
formation of transmembrane pores can achieve this by allowing ions to permeate through
the system, reducing the electric field across the membrane.
Increasing the dipole-membrane coupling strength σp to 0.34 increases the critical potential to φc = 0.22 (0.34V). This is again slightly larger than the value predicted by Eq. (17)
(φc = 0.20), but is also smaller than predicted by a linear increase of φc with σp .

Dipole alignment-membrane coupling

The effect of the dipole alignment-membrane coupling σc on the membrane stability is
shown in Figure 5(b). Increasing σc does not affect the onset of the instability at long
undulatory wavelengths (q̂ = 0), where the cubic dependence on the wavelength (q̂ 3 ) of σc
in the free energy is outweighed by the quadratic dependence (q̂ 2 ) of the terms which cause
the instability. The variation of the dipole alignment-membrane coupling σc does affect the
shorter wavelength (q̂ → 1) structure of the instability, where the cubic and quadratic terms
become comparable. This will affect the behaviour of the membrane if a field larger than the
critical value is applied rapidly. Overall γc only weakly affects the stability of the membrane,
over the range γc = 0 − 1.5 κb .
Figure 5(b) shows the effect of the dipole alignment-membrane coupling σc on the stability
of the membrane and thus only the effect of σc on the bilayer modes. The variation of σc
affects the peristaltic (uq ) modes differently, as shown in Figure 6. The peristaltic modes are
stabilised at higher q̂ by an increase in the dipole alignment-membrane coupling σc , whereas
the bilayer modes are destabilised.
The dipole alignment-membrane coupling energy (Eq. 6) couples the membrane deformad
tion modes (h̄q and uq ) with the dipole alignment modes δm±
q . The eigenvalues λq , whose

eigenvectors are dominated by the dipole alignment modes δm±
q are shown in the lower section of Figure 6. The q̂ = 0 limit of these eigenvalues is governed by and proportional to
σχ , and the eigenvalues only deviate from this value at larger q̂. Significant change in the
eigenvalues can only be seen for values of σc > 1. These large values of σc are unlikely to be
physically realisable as they require γc ≈ O (κb ). The magnitude of γc cannot be measured
directly by current experiment. However as the degree of dipole alignment is observed to
have little correlation with membrane bending [47, 49] it is fair to assume γc ≪ κb .
For the δm+ - and δm− -dominated eigenvectors, the corresponding eigenvalues λdq are
degenerate at q̂ = 0 and then separate as q̂ increases. Increasing the strength of the dipole
alignment-membrane coupling σc increases the amount by which these eigenvalues deviate.
The corresponding eigenvectors are not associated with δm+ and δm− independently, but
rather with both modes equally; however the more stable eigenvalue has a slight contribution
from the bilayer mode h̄q , whereas the less stable eigenvalue has a slight contribution from
the peristaltic modes uq . The difference between these modes explains why the eigenvalues

D.

Fluctuation spectrum

Whereas the variation of σc has a small effect on the overall stability of the membrane, the
interaction of σp with the fluctuation modes provides a test of the model. The fluctuation
spectrum of the modes can be calculated using Eq. (16). As expected, the fluctuations of
the bilayer modes are much larger in magnitude than the peristaltic modes. This is because

FIG. 6: The eigenvalues for both the peristaltic and bilayer modes (upper panel) and the dipole
modes (lower panel) as functions of q̂. As σc is increased at constant φ (=0.21), the bilayer and
peristaltic modes react differently. The lower branch of the bilayer modes becomes stable for q̂ > 1.
The dipolar modes show little difference for field strengths above or below the critical field strength
(φc = 0.16), but respond strongly to changes in the dipole alignment-membrane coupling σp . As q̂
is increased, the dipolar modes deviate from their initial value, the direction determined by their
weak association with either the bilayer modes h̄q or the peristaltic modes uq .

the peristaltic modes are dominated by the strong stretching modulus, σA . For small σA the
fluctuations of the peristaltic modes grow to match the fluctuations of the bilayer modes.

displayed in Figure 7, for various values of the dipole-membrane coupling strength σp , showing that the application of a field increases the magnitude of the fluctuations. Conversely,
the dipole-membrane coupling σp ‘stiffens’ the membrane, and reduces the fluctuations as
reflected in Figure 7.

Eigenvector composition

Figure 8 shows the unstable eigenvalue and the associated normalised eigenvector. For
zero applied field, êλ · êh̄ = 1 and êλ · êu = 0, where êh̄ and êu are the unit vectors representing
the pure modes h̄q and uq respectively, hence the eigenvalue is associated only with the
bilayer modes. For φ > φc the amplitudes of the eigenvector components vary with q̂
and the contribution from the peristaltic mode êλ · êuq increases due to the coupling term
present in Eq. (14). This term has a similar field dependence to the effective surface tension
term present in Eq. (14) which induces the instability, so the eigenvector mixing increases
dramatically for φ > φc . The change in the eigenvector components is small compared with
the initial composition, therefore we can consider the eigenvalue as distinctly associated the
bilayer modes. This behaviour is mirrored in the eigenvalues of the pure peristaltic modes,

DISCUSSION & SUMMARY

We have constructed a model of a planar membrane in an electric field, which contains an
explicit coupling between the orientation of the dipolar lipid headgroups and the membrane
shape, thus coupling the application of the field to the membrane shape in a way not seen
previously in the literature. The phenomenological model contains only harmonic terms
which are subjected to a linear stability analysis. This model becomes unstable as the
applied field is increased, with a critical potential that matches those seen in experiment
and simulation [7]. A simple formula (Eq. (17)) has been found that gives a reasonable
estimate of the critical potential related to a minimal number of model parameters, which is
useful as decreasing the number of parameters used decreases possible sources of error. The
instability depends strongly on m
e 0 , the average alignment in a membrane patch, with the
23

instability occurring for smaller fields for disordered membranes of smaller m
e 0 . As dipole
alignment will vary dynamically in a physical system, the membrane is more likely to become

unstable in disordered patches. This means the model captures some of the stochastic nature
of membrane breakdown and pore formation. The instability also depends strongly on κp ,
the strength of the coupling between the dipolar headgroups and the membrane core. This
is likely dependent on the combination of lipids in the bilayer. Since variations in m
e 0 or κp

have a significant effect on the critical potential φc , these would be good parameters with
which to test the model.

Because the process of membrane breakdown requires a rupture to form in the membrane, it cannot be fully modelled by any continuum theory. Despite this, the instability
studied in this work can be linked with the formation of defects within the membrane and
therefore the formation of transmembrane pores. From Figure 8, the unstable eigenvector
shows that the instability is dominated by the bilayer modes but approximately 2.5% of the
instability involves the peristaltic modes. This induces a periodic thinning which destabilises
the membrane. Evans, Waugh and Melnick [50] found using micropipette aspiration that a
membrane can only support thickness changes of ∼ 4% before rupture. To induce a fractional thickness change of this magnitude using the peristaltic undulations produced by the
instability requires the bilayer modes to have an amplitude of 6nm. This is above the size
that would be produced spontaneously by thermal fluctuations, but after the application of
an electric field, the bilayer modes become unstable and this amplitude could be achieved.
A membrane defect is then more likely to form at the troughs of the peristaltic undulations,
where the membrane is thinnest. This defect could then go on to form a pore, or rupture the
entire bilayer. The most unstable undulation wavelength is 26nm (Figure 4), comparable
with the average pore-pore separation reported in [51], consistent with this hypothesis.
The parameters κp and γc , both unique to this model, provide opportunities to make
predictions and test this model. An obvious extension to the model would be to allow for
the full rotation of the dipole distribution, which could lead to non-trivial pattern formation
[39–41]. Our calculations only calculate the static instability. To fully model the dynamical
behaviour of the instability predicted in this work, we would need to include both the
hydrodynamic flows of the fluid and membrane [32, 43] and the movement of charges in the
solution [44, 45]. Coupling hydrodynamic flows to the movement of the membrane would
be expected to push the instability to smaller wavelengths (larger q̂) [52].

the limiting behaviour of φc with respect to σp is still preserved: φc → ∞ as σp → ∞, and
φc → 0 as σp → 0. The limiting case of φc = σp can only occur in the limit of infinite
surface tension (σs → ∞) which means the apparent singularity in Eq. (14) is always preempted by the membrane becoming unstable. In the limit of zero surface tension, (σs → 0)
the critical potential φc → 0 as there is nothing to resist the undulations introduced by the
dipole-membrane coupling (Eq. (6)).
