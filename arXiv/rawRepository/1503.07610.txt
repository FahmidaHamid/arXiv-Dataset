Abstract
Participants in an eye-movement experiment performed a modified version of the
Landolt-C paradigm (Williams & Pollatsek, 2007) in which they searched for target
squares embedded in linear arrays of spatially contiguous “words” (i.e., short
sequences of squares having missing segments of variable size and orientation).
Although the distributions of single- and first-of-multiple fixation locations replicated
previous patterns suggesting saccade targeting (e.g., Yan, Kliegl, Richter, Nuthmann,
& Shu, 2010), the distribution of all forward fixation locations was uniform,
suggesting the absence of specific saccade targets. Furthermore, properties of the
“words” (e.g., gap size) also influenced fixation durations and forward saccade length,
suggesting that on-going processing affects decisions about when and where (i.e., how
far) to move the eyes. The theoretical implications of these results for existing and
future accounts of eye-movement control are discussed.

Neural systems are extremely adept at exploiting the regularities that exist in the
environment for the purposes of making (near) optimal inferences to guide behavior
(Anderson, 1990). For example, the systems that mediate vision exploit regularities of
objects (e.g., the Gestalt principle of similarity) to represent those objects in a manner
that affords their invariant perception despite variability of both the objects and
viewing angle, partial occlusion of the objects, etc. (Smith, 1988). It should therefore
come as little surprise that complex visual tasks like reading also exploit regularity,
allowing the task to be performed in a (near) optimal manner (Liu & Reichle, 2010;
Liu, Reichle, & Gao, 2013; Reichle & Laurent, 2006; see also Bicknell & Levy,
2012). For example, because low-frequency words require more time to identify than
high-frequency words (Forster & Chambers, 1973; Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley,
1998), readers of alphabetic languages like English tend to spend more time fixating
the low- than high-frequency words (Inhoff & Rayner, 1986; Kliegl, Nuthmann, &
Engbert, 2006; Rayner, Ashby, Pollatsek, & Reichle, 2004). And in a similar manner,
because words can be identified most rapidly when they are fixated near their center
(O’Regan, 1981; Rayner, 1979; Rayner & Morrison, 1981), readers of alphabetic
languages use the blank spaces between words to direct their eyes to locations near
the center of words (McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, & Zola, 1988; Rayner, Sereno, &
Raney, 1996). Such eye-movement behavior takes advantage of the inherent
regularities of the text to support reading that is rapid, but that also maintains some
overall level of comprehension. What is less clear, however, is whether such
behaviors are universal, generalizing across languages and writing systems that
exhibit less—or perhaps different—patterns of regularity. One prime example that has
been the focus of much recent research is Chinese (for a review, see Zang, Liversedge,
Bai, & Yan, 2011).

The Chinese language and writing system has many properties that make it
different from the alphabetical languages that have most often been used in
experiments to understand reading. For example, in contrast to alphabetic writing
systems, Chinese words are not comprised of letters and are not spatially segregated
by blank spaces. Instead, Chinese words consist of 1-4 equally sized box-shaped
characters that are comprised of 1-36 “strokes” (i.e., line segments that originally
corresponding to the brush strokes used to write the characters), with the characters
being arranged in a spatially adjacent linear array (see Figure 1 for an example). The
fact that Chinese words are comprised of a variable number of characters and not
demarcated by blank spaces means that Chinese readers must use their knowledge of
their language to somehow segment character sequences into their corresponding
words (e.g., see Li, Rayner, & Cave, 2009). This task of segmenting characters into
words is intrinsically difficult because there is often ambiguity in how a character
sequences might be segmented, with a given sequence of four characters, for example,
possibly corresponding to two 2-character words or one 4-character word (Hoosain,
1991, 1992; Liu, Li, Lin, & Li, 2013).
----- Figure 1 ----Because of these properties of written Chinese words, there is some debate about
both the extent to which and how the eye movements of Chinese readers are
influenced by the lexical properties of words (as they clearly are in alphabetic
languages; see Rayner, 1998, 2009). For example, one theoretical “camp” has argued
that characters are more important than words during the reading of Chinese, and that
characters are the basic units that determine both when the eyes move (Chen, 1996;
Chen, Song, Lau, Wong, & Tang, 2003; Chen & Zhou, 1999; Feng, 2008; Hoosain,
1991, 1992) and where the eyes move (Tsai & McConkie, 2003; Yang & McConkie,

4

1999). In contrast, the other theoretical “camp” maintains that, because words have a
psychological reality in the minds of Chinese readers (Cheng, 1981; Li et al., 2009;
Li, Bicknell, Liu, Wei, & Rayner, 2014; Li & Logan, 2008; Li, Gu, Liu, & Rayner,
2013), they also play an important functional role in determining when the eyes move
during the reading of Chinese (Liversedge, Hyönä, & Rayner, 2013; Yan, Tian, Bai, &
Rayner, 2006). However, this second perspective further diverges in their accounts of
how readers of Chinese decide where to move their eyes. One contingent has argued
that the locations of initial fixations on words are a function of whether the words are
successfully segmented in the parafovea, with saccades towards segmented words
being directed towards their centers but saccades towards un-segmented words being
directed towards their beginnings (Yan et al., 2010). In contract, the other contingent
has proposed that there is no “default” saccade target within a word, but that the
length of the saccade moving the eyes into a word is instead influenced by the relative
difficulty of foveal and/or parafoveal processing, with easier processing resulting in
longer forward saccades (Liu, Reichle, & Li, 2014; Wei, Li, & Pollatsek, 2013). Given
these different theoretical perspectives on eye-movement control during the reading of
Chinese, it is clear that—in contrast to alphabetic languages—we still know very little
about the basic mechanisms that determine when and where the eyes move during the
reading of non-alphabetic languages, or more specifically, about if and, if so, how
lexical processing mediates eye-movement control during the reading of Chinese.
One strategy that has been used to examine the influence of lexical processing in
guiding eye movements during the reading of alphabetic languages has involved
comparisons of such eye movements to those that are observed during tasks that do
not require lexical processing but that do entail many of the same visual and
oculomotor constraints, such as the Landolt-C “reading” task (Corbic, Glover, &

5

Radach, 2007; Williams & Pollatsek, 2007; Vanyukov, Warren, Wheeler, & Reichle,
2012; see also Williams, Pollatsek, & Reichle, 2014). In experiments that have used
this task, participants were instructed to scan through linear arrays of Landolt Cs (i.e.,
ring-shaped stimuli having missing segments (i.e., gaps) of variable size and/or
orientations) to search for target stimuli—rings containing no missing gaps. Because
these linear arrays are comprised of Landolt-C stimuli arranged into sequences of
“words” (i.e., clusters of the stimuli separated by blank spaces between clusters), the
task has been used to study saccadic targeting under conditions that resemble those
experienced during the reading of alphabetic languages, minus all of the languagerelated behaviors that are normally engaged during word, sentence, and discourse
processing. The key findings from these experiments is that participants seem to treat
the Landolt-C clusters as “words”, directing their eyes towards their centers and
fixating the easier-to-process clusters (i.e., those with larger gaps sizes and/or that
occur more often during the course of the experiment) for shorter durations than the
more difficult-to-process clusters (i.e., those with smaller gap sizes and/or that occur
less often during the experiment).
In the experiment that is reported in this article, the Landolt-C task was modified
so that it more closely resembled the reading of Chinese (see Figure 2), thereby
providing a novel way to examine if the segmentation of “words” (i.e., spatially
adjacent stimuli having similarly sized and orientated gaps) affects fixation durations
and/or saccadic targeting1. That is, our participants were instructed to scan linear
arrays of Landolt-squares, or boxes with a missing segment of varying size and
orientation, and to indicate the number of targets (i.e., squares that do not contain
missing segments; e.g., □). The advantages of this method are that it provides a way
of precisely manipulating both word processing difficulty (i.e., gap size) and size (i.e.,

6

the number of identical spatially adjacent non-target squares) in the absence of
language processing.
The main goal of this experiment was therefore to determine if/how word
segmentation and identification affects eye movements in this task so as to better
inform our understanding of the word-based effects that have been observed during
the actual reading of Chinese text. More specifically, we focus on: (1) if/how fixation
durations on individual words are affected by their identification difficulty; and (2)
if/how saccadic targeting is affected by their segmentation difficulty. If easier-toidentify words are fixated for shorter durations but saccade targeting is unaffected by
the ease of word segmentation, then this pattern of results would lend further support
to the hypothesis that the processing associated with words influences both when and
where the eyes move during the reading of Chinese (e.g., Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al.,
2013), but that parafoveal word segmentation is not the primary determinant of where
the eyes are moved (cf., Yan et al., 2010).
Method
Participants
Twenty participants (12 males) recruited from Sun Yat-Sen University were paid
for their participation. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and
were naive to the purpose of the experiment.
Apparatus
Stimuli were displayed on a 23-in. LCD monitor (Samsung SyncMaster2233)
using SR-Research Experiment Builder software. The monitor had a resolution of
1,680 × 1,050 pixels and refresh rate of 120 Hz. Eye movements were recorded using

7

a SR-Research Eyelink 1000 eye tracker (Kanata, ON, Canada) with a spatial
resolution of 0.01° and sampling rate of 1,000 Hz.
Stimuli and Design
The materials were designed to be as similar to Chinese sentences as possible
(e.g., cf., Figures 1 vs. 2). Each “character” was a Landolt-Square (40 pixels × 40
pixels) with a gap that was 2, 4, 6, or 8 pixels in size and that occurred in the left,
right, top, or bottom of the character. Each cluster or “word” was composed of 1, 2, 3,
or 4 characters. Both the gap size and location were held constant within a given
word, but varied between words. The spaces between any two successive characters
were 6 pixels. Each array of words or “sentence” contained 10 randomly selected
words and ranged from 16 to 33 characters in length (M = 25 characters). The
combination of the number of characters per word and the gap size and orientation in
a given word gave 64 unique words. Each word was repeated 40 times across the
experiment. Each sentence had 0, 1, or 2 targets (i.e., characters without gaps) that
could appear with equal probability within any word except the first and last word
within a sentence. Participants were instructed to scan through each sentence and then
indicate via button presses how many targets occurred in the sentence, with one
sentence being displayed per trial. There were four blocks containing 64 trials each,
with the order of blocks being completely random.
----- Figure 2 ----Procedure
Upon arrival, participants were given task instructions and then seated 63 cm
from the video monitor. A chinrest was used to minimize head movements during the
experiment. Although viewing was binocular, eye-movement data were only collected

8

from right eye. The eye-tracker was calibrated and validated using a 9-dot procedure
at the beginning of each block of trials, with additional calibrations and validations
being conducted as necessary. After that, participants completed 8 practice trials (not
included in our analyses) and then completed the 4 blocks of experimental trials. A
drift-check procedure was performed before each trial; a sentence was displayed after
the participants successfully fixated the white box (1° × 1°) at the location of the first
character in the sentence. Participants were instructed to view a right-bottom region of
the screen to terminate a trial and to then press the number button on the keyboard
corresponding to the number of targets that appeared in the trial. Accuracy feedback
was randomly provided on half of the trials.
Results
Accuracy
The mean overall accuracy of the experiment was 91% (SD = 0.05).
Eye-Movement Results
Fixations on the first and last words in each sentence were removed from our
analyses because the former coincided with the abrupt appearance of the sentence and
the latter coincided with the termination of a trial. Fixations on words containing
targets and immediately preceding or following targets were also removed from our
analyses. Thus, fixations on 64.3% of the total number of words were included in our
analyses. From these data, saccades longer than 3 SDs above the mean for a given
participant were excluded (3.05% of the total saccades).
To determine if/how the processing of words affected eye movements during our
task, our analyses focused on the relationship between various eye-movement
dependent measures (related to when and where to move eyes) and properties of both

9

the fixated word (i.e., word N) and the two spatially adjacent words (i.e., words N-1
and N+1). To do this, we examined the first-pass fixation-location distributions
corresponding to: (1) first fixations; (2) single fixations; (3) first-of-multiple fixations;
and (4) all forward fixations. We also examined the following measures: (5) forwardsaccade length, or the distance between two consecutive forward fixations during
first-pass scanning; (6) first-fixation duration, or the duration of the first fixation on a
word during first-pass scanning; (7) gaze duration, or the sum of all first-pass fixation
durations on a word; and (8) total-viewing time, or the sum of all fixation durations on
a word. We then built linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) for each measure,
specifying participants, items, and random slopes of each predictor (e.g., word
properties) as the random effects so that our reported significance values reflect the
variability of participants, items, and the slopes of the predictors (see also Barr, Levy,
Scheepers, & Tily, 2013). Based on prior results and our priori hypotheses, we also
included practice (i.e., ordinal trial number) and the properties of words N-1, N, and
N+1 (i.e., gap size and number of characters) as fixed-effect factors in our LMMs.
The models were then fitted using the lme4 package (ver. 1.1-7; Bates, Maechler,
Bolker, & Walker, 2014; Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) and p-values were estimated using
lmerTest package (ver. 2.0-20; Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2013) in R
(ver. 3.1.2; R Development Core Team, 2015).
Fixation Locations
To determine if parafoveal word segmentation influences saccadic targeting, we
analyzed our various measures of fixation location during first-pass scanning. Figure
3 respectively shows the distributions of initial-, single-, first-of-multiple-, and all
forward fixation locations as a function of the number of characters with the words,
their gap sizes, and practice (i.e., ordinal block number). As shown, the locations of

10

initial fixations (panels a-b) and the first-of-multiple fixations (panels c-d) were more
likely to be near the beginnings of words, whereas single fixations (panels e-f) were
more likely to be located near the centers of words. However, the locations of all
forward fixations (panels g-h) were uniform (all values of χ2 ≤ 1.74, ps ≥ 0.755; also
see Table 1). All of these results are consistent with previous findings that have been
observed with Chinese reading (Li, Liu, & Rayner, 2011; Yan et al., 2010).
----- Figure 3 & Table 1 ----LMMs were further used to examine if practice and the properties of words N-1,
N, and N+1 affected all forward fixation locations on word N (measured from the left
edge of that word). Unsurprisingly, Table 2 shows that the mean fixation location
across all forward saccades moved further to the right of word N as its length
increased (b = 0.99, SE = 0.01, t = 97.27, p < 0.001). The fact that the mean fixation
location was not influenced by the gap size of word N, the properties of the spatially
adjacent words, or the amount of practice (all values of |t| ≤ 1.24, all ps ≥ 0.214)
indicates that the uniformity of distributions of forward fixation locations was robust,
which in turn suggests the absence of any (strongly) preferred viewing location on the
words in our task. Importantly, the “preferred viewing locations” which were
seemingly evident in the distributions of first and first-of-multiple fixations (i.e.,
located near the word beginnings) and of the single fixations (i.e., located near the
word centers) were specious because of the arbitrary way in which these fixations
were extracted from the uniform distribution of all forward fixations. We will say
more about this in the Discussion.
----- Table 2 ----Saccade Length

11

Although the results from fixation-location analyses indicated that properties of
neither the fixated word nor its spatially adjacent words influenced the distribution of
all of the forward fixation locations, it is possible that foveal and/or parafoveal
processing influenced the length of forward saccade. As Table 3 indicates, forward
saccade length increased with the lengths of word N-1 (b = 0.01, SE = 0.01, t = 2.43, p
= 0.015), word N (b = 0.10, SE = 0.01, t = 9.88, p < 0.001), and word N+1 (b = 0.04,
SE = 0.01, t = 5.05, p < 0.001). Forward saccade length also increased with the gap
size of word N-1 (b = 0.01, SE = 0.003, t = 1.72, p = 0.085), word N (b = 0.01, SE =
0.01, t = 2.23, p = 0.037), and word N+1 (b = 0.02, SE = 0.003, t = 5.58, p < 0.001).
These results were entirely consistent with those of previously reported experiments
involving Chinese reading which demonstrated that forward saccade length increases
with both the processing ease (frequency) and length of the fixated word (Li et al.,
2014; Liu et al., 2014; Liu, Li, &Pollatsek, submitted for review; Wei et al., 2013),
and with the processing ease (frequency) and length of upcoming (parafoveal) word
(Li et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., submitted for review).
----- Table 3 ----Fixation Durations
Our analyses have shown that properties of the fixated words and its spatially
adjacent words did not influence the uniformity of all forward fixation location
distributions, but that word properties did influence the length of forward saccades.
This suggests that ongoing processing influences saccade length rather than fixation
locations on words. It is therefore also necessary to examine how word properties and
practice affected ongoing processing.
As Table 4 shows, first-fixation durations decreased with the length of word N (b
= -1.35, SE = 0.67, t = -2.01, p = 0.051) and the gap size of word N (b = -1.16, SE =

12

0.33, t = -3.50, p = 0.002). Conversely, as Table 5 shows, gaze durations increased
with the length of word N (b = 135.70, SE = 10.91, t = 12.44, p < 0.001), but
decreased with the lengths of word N-1 (b = -4.03, SE = 1.21, t = -3.34, p < 0.001)
and word N+1 (b = -6.84, SE = 1.53, t = -4.46, p < 0.001). Similarly, gaze durations
also decreased with increasing gap size of word N (b = -9.75, SE = 0.72, t = -13.47, p
< 0.001).
----- Table 4 & 5 ----Finally, as Table 6 shows, total-viewing times (like gaze durations) increased with
the length of word N (b = 158.70, SE = 3.66, t = 43.37, p < 0.001), but decreased with
the lengths of word N-1 (b = -5.06, SE = 1.41, t = -3.59, p < 0.001) and word N+1 (b =
-6.53, SE = 1.41, t = -4.62, p < 0.001). And like first-fixation and gaze durations, the
total-viewing times deceased with increasing gap size of word N (b = -13.16, SE =
0.85, t = -15.44, p < 0.001).
----- Table 6 ----The results of the preceding analyses are consistent with other experimental
results showing that the properties of the fixated word and its spatially adjacent
neighbors can influence fixation durations during Chinese reading. For example,
several studies have demonstrated that fixation durations decrease with increasing
processing ease (e.g., frequency) of both the fixated word (Yan et al., 2006; Yang &
McConkie, 1999; Rayner, Li, Juhasz, & Yan, 2005) and the previously fixated word
(i.e., spillover effects; Li et al., 2014, see Table 1). Our results are also consistent with
evidence that gaze durations tend to increase as the length of the fixated word
increases and as the length of the previously fixated word decreases (Li et al., 2014,

13

see Table 1). The theoretical implications of these results for our understanding of
eye-movement control during the reading of Chinese will be discussed next.
General Discussion
The present experiment aimed to determine if and how “word” processing affects
eye movements in a Chinese-like visual search task so as to better inform our
understanding of the word-related effects that have been observed in the actual
reading of Chinese text. We replicated the well-established pattern of fixation
locations that has been reported in Chinese reading: Whereas the distribution of firstfixation locations peaked at the word beginnings when the words were fixated more
than once, the distribution of single-fixation locations peaked near the word centers
(Li et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2010). However, an examination of the distributions of all
of the forward fixation locations indicated that they were clearly uniform and not
influenced by word length, word-processing difficulty (i.e., gap size), or practice.
Finally, there were effects of word length and word-processing difficulty on the
various fixation-duration measures and forward saccade length, suggesting that
variables that influence that rate of on-going word processing also dynamically
influences both when and where the eyes move during our task and—as we will
argue, by extension—the reading of Chinese text (Liu et al., 2014). In the remainder
of this discussion, we indicate precisely why we maintain this position, and discuss in
more detail what we believe each of the preceding results says about how readers of
Chinese make “decisions” about when and where to move their eyes.
First, the finding that the distributions of all forward fixation locations were
uniform and invariant to both “word” properties and practice strongly suggests that
there is no preferred viewing location in our task; otherwise, the distributions would
have tended to be normal, peaked on whatever viewing location actually afforded

14

efficient performance of our task. We believe that the patterns of fixation-location
distributions observed for first-of-multiple and single fixations in our study and others
(e.g., Li et al., 2011) and that have been suggested as indicative of a preferred viewing
location that is conditional upon the successful segmentation of parafoveal words
(e.g., see Yan et al., 2010) is instead an artifact of the simple fact that words that are
fixated near their centers are less likely to be refixated than words that are fixated
nears their beginnings (Liu et al., submitted for review). Li et al. (2011) provide
convincing support for this conjecture by running simulations of eye movements
during Chinese reading that included the simple assumption that saccades are of
constant mean length but with some variability. These simulations reproduced the
findings that the distributions of single- and first-of-multiple fixation locations tend to
be near the centers and beginnings of words, respectively, thereby demonstrated
precisely how a pattern of results that might otherwise suggest a type of saccade
targeting that is conditional upon parafoveal word segmentation can emerge from
simple assumptions that involve no specific saccade targets (see also Ma, Li, &
Pollatsek, in press). These simulations, in conjunction with our findings, are therefore
consistent with the hypothesis that there are no specific saccade targets during the
reading of Chinese. In other words, a saccade target is not a true target per se, but is
instead the consequence of a saccade that is intended to move the eyes to an
informative viewing location.
Second, the finding that properties of words influenced the various fixationduration measures in our task is completely consistent with findings that lexical
properties of Chinese words also influence such measures during the reading of
Chinese (Li et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Liu et al., submitted for review; Yan et al.,
2006; Yang & McConkie, 1999; Rayner et al., 2005). These findings indicate the

15

validity of our method of using our version of the Landolt-C paradigm to examine
eye-movement control during Chinese reading by replicating key results showing that
the relative difficulty of “word” processing (Williams & Pollatsek, 2007; Williams et
al., 2014) can influence the time spent fixating (processing) a given “word”,
analogous to what is known to happen in actual reading (e.g., Schilling et al., 1998).
These findings are therefore important because they permits one to infer that whatever
perceptual (e.g., segmenting individual “words” based on character gap size and
orientation) and cognitive (e.g., discriminating non-targets from targets) are operative
in our task are likely to have analogs in Chinese reading (e.g., segmenting individual
words, identifying characters and words, etc.), and that, in both tasks, these processes
are likely to play causal roles in the patterns of eye movements that are observed. The
most transparent of these causal roles is undoubtedly related to the moment-bymoment “decisions” about when to move the eyes from one location to the next, but
as our experiment demonstrates, the causal influence is also likely to extend to
decisions about where to move the eyes.
This last conjecture is consistent with our third main finding that the properties of
“words” influences forward saccade length in our task. On some level, this finding
should not be too surprising if one considers the range on possible ways that readers
might in theory guide their eyes while reading Chinese. On one end of the continuum,
it is possible—thought not likely—that readers simply move their eyes randomly to
new locations, perhaps adopting some simple heuristic (e.g., the “fixed saccade
length” assumption used in the simulations reported by Li et al., 2011; also see Yan et
al., 2010). At the other end of the continuum, readers might use word boundary
information to move their eyes to the center of the next unidentified word, as posited
to occur in models that simulate the eye movements of people reading alphabetic

16

languages like English and German (e.g., E-Z Reader: Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, &
Rayner, 1998; Reichle, Warren, & McConnell, 2009; Reichle, 2011; SWIFT: Engbert,
Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Schad & Engbert, 2012). This second possibility
also seems unlikely given the empirical evidence against preferred viewing locations
in both this experiment and in experiments involving Chinese reading (e.g., Li et al.,
2011), and given the inherent difficulties associated with word segmentation in
Chinese reading (e.g., see Li et al., 2009). By the process of elimination, then, the fact
that these two extreme possible accounts of saccade targeting in Chinese are not very
feasible suggests a third possibility—that readers decide where to move their eyes
using some type of information other than word boundaries. What might this
information be?
One possibility that we believe is a viable candidate is whatever processing
difficulty is associated with the currently fixated word and/or the word(s) immediately
to the right of fixation. By this account, readers might use the foveal load, or the
difficulty associated with identifying the fixated word, as a metric to gauge how far to
move their eyes with the next saccade. The intuition behind this simple heuristic is
that, because difficult-to-process fixated words afford less parafoveal preview of the
upcoming word than do less difficult-to-process fixated words (Henderson & Ferriera,
1990; Kennison & Clifton, 1995), foveal load might provide the reader with a metric
of how much processing still remains to be done on the parafoveal word when it is
fixated, and thus a metric of how far the eyes should be moved into the word. (A
parafoveal word that has received little processing during preview is likely to require
a substantial amount of processing after it is fixated, making a more conservative
fixation near the beginning of the word, thereby allowing for the possibility of one or
more additional fixations on the word during the forward pass through the text.) And

17

for the same reason, information that becomes available about the parafoveal word
from the foveal word might also be expected to play an important role in modulating
the length of the saccade leaving the foveated word if the goal is to move the eyes just
past the location where the parafoveal characters and/or words have been sufficiently
processed for their identification to be imminent. Such a proposal has already been
suggested to account for experimental results showing that the saccade length leaving
a word is modulated by the difficulty (e.g., frequency) of that word during Chinese
reading (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2013), and as a general account of how people
decide where to move their eyes during the reading of Chinese (Liu et al., submitted
for review).
Thus, our variant Landolt-C paradigm has provided new information that is
consistent with prior research using this paradigm (e.g., Williams & Pollatsek, 2007;
Vanyukov et al., 2012) and with prior research on Chinese reading (e.g., Li et al.,
2014; Liversedge et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2006), lending further support to a
theoretical account of eye-movement control in Chinese reading—an account based
on local character- and word-based control of when the eyes move that in turn affects
where (or more precisely, how far) the eyes move (Liu et al., 2014, submitted for
review; Wei et al., 2013). This represents significant empirical and theoretical
progress in understanding eye-movement control during reading because it reveals the
limitations of existing accounts of eye-movement control (e.g., the computational
models cited earlier) that are based of years of research of alphabetic languages. It
goes without saying that this progress will be extremely useful for developing formal
accounts (i.e., computational models) of eye-movement control in non-alphabetic
languages like Chinese, and more generally for informing our understanding of how

18

differences among languages and writing systems influence the perceptual, cognitive,
and motoric processes that move the eyes during reading.

Footnote
1. For the purposes of brevity and to draw parallels between our paradigm and the
actual reading of Chinese text (which is of theoretical interest), we will refer to the
Landolt-squares used in our experiment as “characters” and to the clusters of such
characters as “words” throughout the remainder of this article. (Accordingly, we will
also drop the use of scare quotes.)

Figure 1. Examples of two Chinese sentences and their respective translations. In the
first, the sequence of four underlined characters correspond to two words. In the
second, the same characters correspond to a single word.
Figure 2. Examples of experimental materials, with the target (i.e., a square) and one
of the “word” clusters being rendered in gray for illustrative purposes.
Figure 3. The distribution of initial fixations on words that received one or more
fixations (panels a-b), of first-of-multiple fixations on words that received two or
more fixations (panels c-d), of single fixations on words that received only one
fixation (panels e-f), and of all forward fixations on words during first-pass scanning
(panels g-h). All of the panels show the fixation-location distributions as a function of
the number of characters within a word. Panels a, c, e, and g (left column) also show
the fixation-location distributions as a function of the gap size within a word, whereas
panels b, d, f, and g (right column) also show the fixation-location distributions as a
function of practice (ordinal block number). Error bars represented the standard errors
of the means.
