Abstract
Heritability is a central parameter in quantitative genetics, both from an evolutionary and a breeding perspective.
For plant traits heritability is traditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability. This
approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account for different genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markers there is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-sense heritability,
using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated from genetic markers. Such estimates have received
much attention in human genetics but are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that current methodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hence requiring genotypic means. An alternative
that we propose here, is to use mixed models at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments, simulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches, and how these affect genomic prediction with
G-BLUP and genome-wide association studies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very
large standard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models at individual plant or plot level
produced more realistic estimates, and for simulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomic
prediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49% increase in accuracy. For GWAS
on simulated traits, the use of individual plant data gave almost no increase in power. The new methodology is
applicable to any complex trait where multiple replicates of individual genotypes can be scored. This includes
important agronomic crops, as well as bacteria and fungi.

Introduction
Narrow-sense heritability is an important parameter in quantitative genetics, determining the response to selection
and representing the proportion of phenotypic variance that is due to additive genetic effects (JACQUARD (1983),
N YQUIST and BAKER (1991), H OLLAND et al. (2010), R ITLAND (1996), V ISSCHER et al. (2006), V ISSCHER
et al. (2008), SILLANPAA (2011)). This definition of heritability goes back to F ISHER (1918) and W RIGHT
(1920) almost a century ago. In plant species for which replicates of the same genotype are available (inbred
lines, doubled haploids, clones), a different form of heritability, broad sense heritability, is traditionally estimated
by the intra-class correlation coefficient for genotypic effects, using estimates for within and between genotype
variance. Broad sense heritability is also referred to as repeatability and gives the proportion of phenotypic variance
explained by heritable (additive) and non-heritable (dominance, epistasis) genetic variance.
With the arrival of high-density genotyping there is growing interest in marker-based estimation of narrowsense heritability (WTCCC (2007), YANG et al. (2010), YANG et al. (2011), S PEED et al. (2012), VATTIKUTI
1

et al. (2012), V ISSCHER and G ODDARD (2014)). These estimates are obtained from mixed models containing
random additive genetic effects, whose covariance structure is estimated from genetic markers. While markerbased heritability estimates have received much attention in human genetics, these are rarely reported for plant
traits, despite their relevance in evolutionary genetics, the dissection of complex traits, and in the ongoing debate
on missing heritability (M ANOLIO et al. (2009), E ICHLER et al. (2010), L EE et al. (2011), B RACHI et al. (2011),
Z UK et al. (2012)). Heritability estimates are also of great relevance to plant breeders, as they give a measure
for the breeding potential of a trait. In addition, state-of-the-art phenotyping platforms are making experiments
more reproducible, increasing the relevance of marker-based estimation of heritability, as well as comparison of
estimates from different experiments.
Although marker-based heritability estimation for plant traits can in principle be achieved within the same analytic framework that has been developed for human traits, there are important differences. First, heritability of
human traits is usually estimated using panels of unrelated individuals, in order to avoid confounding with geographical or environmental effects (B ROWNING and B ROWNING (2011)). For most plant species panels of unrelated individuals are not available, as plant genotypes will often share ancestry or adaptation inducing dependence
between genotypes. At the same time however, plant genotypes can be evaluated under the same experimental
conditions (e.g. common garden or growth chamber), and the usual assumption is that this eliminates genotypeenvironment correlations. Second, plant genotypes are often phenotyped in several genetically identical replicates.
This is the case for all so-called immortal populations (K EURENTJES et al. (2007), W IJNEN and K EURENTJES
(2014)). Mixed model analysis can then be performed either on the individual plant (or plot) data or on genotypic
means. In the literature on multi-environment trials (S MITH et al. (2001), S MITH et al. (2005), OAKEY et al.
(2006), P IEPHO and W ILLIAMS (2006), P IEPHO et al. (2006) V ERBYLA et al. (2007), B OER et al. (2007), S TICH
et al. (2008), M ÖHRING and P IEPHO (2009), VAN E EUWIJK et al. (2010), W ELHAM et al. (2010), P IEPHO et al.
(2012), M ALOSETTI et al. (2013)) these approaches are referred to as respectively one-stage and two-stage. These
works consider mostly populations for which a pedigree is available, typically experimental populations. In the
context of genomic prediction and GWAS for natural populations, mixed model analysis is usually performed
using a two-stage approach. The (usually tacit) assumption is that the genotypic means and kinship coefficients
contain all the relevant information for estimating the genetic and residual variance. Here we investigate the feasibility of marker-based estimation of heritability with one- and two-stage approaches, and look at how heritability
estimates affect genomic prediction with the best linear unbiased predictor (G-BLUP) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although our analysis of observed phenotypes focuses on the model plant A. thaliana, the
asymptotic variances of different heritability estimators were also computed for diverse panels of Z. mays (VAN
H EERWAARDEN et al. (2012), R IEDELSHEIMER et al. (2012)) and O. sativa (Z HAO et al. (2011)).
In both published data (ATWELL et al. (2010)) and new experiments, we found very large standard errors
and sometimes unrealistically high estimates of heritability, which could not be explained by varying linkage
disequilibrium (S PEED et al. (2012)). Much better heritability estimates were obtained when mixed model analysis
was performed at individual plant level. These estimates were based on kinship information as well as additional
information on within genotype variability, and in simulations they were found to be up to 13 times more accurate
than for heritability estimates based on genotypic means. In genomic prediction, correlation between simulated
and predicted genetic effects increased in some cases by as much as 49%. This is a substantial improvement which
shows the importance of accurate heritability estimates in plant breeding programs.
All reported heritability estimates can be obtained using our R-package heritability, which is freely
available from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heritability/index.html).
In contrast to existing packages such as emma (K ANG et al. (2008)), rrblup (E NDELMAN (2011)), and synbreed
(W IMMER et al. (2012)), it provides confidence intervals for heritability estimates. We also present software for
GWAS: our program scan_GLS can efficiently perform GWAS directly on the individual plant or plot-level data,
as well as on the means, incorporating a non-diagonal error covariance structure.

Materials and Methods
We assume a natural population of n genotypes, where for each genotype a quantitative trait is measured on a
number of genetically identical replicates of immortal lines. These replicates can refer to either individual plants
(e.g. Arabidopsis) or plots in a field trial (e.g. maize). For convenience we will use the terms ’replicate’ and
’individual plant data’ as synonyms throughout. In either case, the observations on replicates are not to be confused
with having multiple observations on the same individual. We focus on inbred lines, but apart from a few different
constants, all expressions are valid for any diploid species. We do not partition the environmental variance into
different contributing factors (see e.g. V ISSCHER et al. (2008)), hence the environmental variance just equals the
error variance. For simplicity we first present marker-based estimation of heritability for a completely randomized
design, in absence of additional covariates. The expressions for more general designs are given in Appendix A,
2

which also provides a brief overview of the existing methodology for marker-based heritability estimation. Details
on G-BLUP, GWAS and the phenotypic data are given in appendices C, D and E.

Genotypic data
We analyze simulated and real traits for sub-populations of the RegMap, which contains 1307 world-wide accessions of A. thaliana that have been genotyped at 214051 SNP-markers (H ORTON et al. (2012)). We considered
four sub-populations: 298 Swedish accessions (Swedish RegMap, H ORTON et al. (2012), L ONG et al. (2013)),
204 French accessions (French RegMap, H ORTON et al. (2012), B RACHI et al. (2013)), 350 accessions from the
HapMap-population (L I et al. (2010)), and a subset of 250 accessions which we will refer to as the structured
RegMap (accessions ID’s are given in Table S1). The structured RegMap accessions were chosen to have large differences in genetic relatedness (i.e. variation in kinship coefficients, across pairs of accessions). These differences
were hence largest in the structured RegMap, and smallest in the HapMap (Figures S1 and S2). For the asymptotic
distributions of heritability estimators given below, we also considered marker-based kinship matrices for three
populations of crop plants: the panel described in VAN H EERWAARDEN et al. (2012) (Z. mays, 400 accessions),
the panel described in R IEDELSHEIMER et al. (2012) (Z. mays, 280 accessions) and the panel from Z HAO et al.
(2011) (O. sativa, 413 accessions).

Phenotypic data
We estimated heritabilities for two traits from the literature and four traits from new experiments. Two flowering
traits from ATWELL et al. (2010) were analyzed: days to flowering time under long day and vernalization (LDV),
and days to flowering time under long day (LD). In two new experiments (Appendix E), leaf area 13 days after
sowing (LA) was measured for the Swedish RegMap and the HapMap, using the same automated phenotyping
platform. In the final experiment, the HapMap was phenotyped for bolting time (BT) and leaf width (LW). Trait
descriptions and abbreviations are given in Table 1. In all experiments the individual plants were grouped into
complete blocks, but due to non-germinating seeds and dead plants, there is some unbalance for all of the traits.

Marker-based estimation of heritability

(see e.g. PATTERSON et al. (2006) and G ODDARD et al. (2010)). The numbers xi,l ∈ {0, 2} denote the minor
allele count1 at marker l for genotype i, and fl ∈ [0, 1] is the minor allele frequency at marker l. The phenotypic
response of replicate j of genotype i is modeled as
Yi,j = µ + Gi + Ei,j

(i = 1, . . . , n,

where the subscripts m indicate that the estimates are based on genotypic means. We will omit the letters r and m
if either these are clear from the context, or when a statement holds for both model (2) and model (4). In human
association studies, r is usually one, and ĥ2m and ĥ2r are identical.

Repeatability and broad-sense heritability
Given a completely randomized design with r replicates, repeatability or intra-class correlation can be estimated
by
σ̂ 2
2
2
Ĥ 2 = 2 G 2 , with σ̂G
= (M S(G) − M S(Env))/r, σ̂Env
= M S(Env),
(6)
σ̂G + σ̂Env
where M S(G) and M S(Env) are the mean sums of squares for genotype and residual error, obtained from
2
analysis of variance (ANOVA). In case M S(G) < M S(Env), σ̂G
is set to zero. See S INGH et al. (1993) or
(in the context of sib-analysis) LYNCH and WALSH (1998) (p.563). Here we stick to the widely used notation
Ĥ 2 , although repeatability only equals broad-sense heritability (H 2 ) under the assumption that all differences
between genotypes are indeed genetic, and not due to e.g. genotype-environment correlation. In any case, no
additional information on the genetic structure is used here, hence the mean sums of squares for genotype contains
all genetic effects, not only the additive ones. Consequently, Ĥ 2 is an estimator of (an upper-bound on) broad-sense
heritability.
It is known to have a small bias (N YQUIST and BAKER (1991), S INGH et al. (1993)), which tends to zero when
the number of genotypes increases. Additional fixed effects can be included in the ANOVA, which may reduce
M S(Env) and give a higher heritability estimate. In case the genotypes have differing numbers of replicates,
2
genetic variance is estimated with σ̂G
= (M S(G) − M S(Env))/r̄, where

Confidence intervals
Confidence intervals for broad-sense heritability H 2 were obtained from classical theory (e.g. LYNCH and WALSH
2
2
(1998), p.563; for easy reference see File S1). Confidence intervals for h2 were constructed using σ̂A
and σ̂E
and
the inverse average-information (AI) matrix, obtained from the AI-REML algorithm (G ILMOUR et al. (1995)).

). The delta-method (see e.g. VAN DER

2

2
VAART (2000)) applied to the function (σ̂A , σ̂E ) → σ̂A /(σ̂A + σ̂E ) then gives the asymptotic distribution of ĥ2 ,
from which a confidence interval for h2 is calculated. In case the heritability is low or high, confidence intervals
may be partly outside [0, 1]. We set all negative values to zero and all values larger than one equal to one. An
2
2
2
2
alternative is application of the delta-method to the function (σ̂A
, σ̂E
) → log(σ̂A
/σ̂E
). This gives confidence
2
2
intervals for log(σA /σE ), which are then back-transformed to confidence intervals for heritability. The latter
intervals will be referred to as ’log-transformed’, and the other intervals as ’standard’.
When the likelihood as function of h2 is monotonically increasing, the confidence intervals can become numerically unstable, alternating between [0, 1] and [1, 1]. However we found that using the AI-matrix obtained by
setting h2 = 1 − , the interval was always very close to [0, 1], for any  > 0. We therefore defined the interval to
be [0, 1] in case of a monotonically increasing likelihood.

Simulations
Each simulated trait consists of r = 3 replicates for a subset of 200 accessions randomly drawn from subpopulation of the Arabidopsis RegMap (H ORTON et al. (2012)). We simulate according to model (2), except
that the genetic effects Gi are not purely polygenic, but a mixture of QTL-effects at a small number of markers
and a polygenic signal with genetic structure given by the kinship matrix defined in (1). More details are given
in Appendix B. Different genetic architectures were considered, but all simulated genetic effects were additive.

4

Hence, broad- and narrow-sense heritability were equal, and Ĥ 2 , ĥ2r and ĥ2m were in this case different estimators
of the (same) simulated heritability.
For the comparison of heritability estimates we simulated traits for the structured RegMap, the HapMap and the
Swedish- and French RegMap. For comparing one- and two-stage association mapping and genomic prediction
only the structured RegMap and the HapMap were considered. For genomic prediction and the comparison of
heritability estimates we simulated 3 levels of heritability, for each sub-population: low (0.2), medium (0.5) and
high (0.8). For each heritability level, 5000 traits were simulated. For the comparison of one- and two-stage
association mapping, 1000 traits were simulated with heritability 0.5. In all simulations, a completely randomized
design was assumed.

computed Var(ĥ2r ) and the ratio Var(ĥ2r )/ Var(ĥ2m ) of the two standard deviations, for several populations
in A. thaliana, Z. mays and O. sativa (Table 2), and three heritability levels (h2 = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8).
The use of individual plant data gave a substantial improvement q
in accuracy for all populations, which was

largest for the Arabidopsis HapMap (81% reduction with respect to Var(ĥ2m ), for r = 4 and h2 = 0.8) and
smallest for the structured RegMap, the rice population from Z HAO et al. (2011) and the maize population from
R IEDELSHEIMER et al. (2012) (13 − 15% reduction when r = 2 and h2 = 0.2). For the maize population from
VAN H EERWAARDEN et al. (2012) and the other Arabidopsis populations the improvements were similar. The
standard deviation of ĥ2r decreased with increasing heritability and increasing numbers of replicates. The ratio
of the standard deviations of ĥ2r over those of ĥ2m also decreased substantially with increasing heritability, but
remained similar when increasing the number of replicates beyond 2.
It should be emphasized that the ratios in Table 2 are asymptotic: although the expressions in (9) depend on
the kinship matrix K of a finite population, they may only be good approximations for (very) large populations
with population structure similar to that defined by K. Such populations could be modeled as a function of
population genetic processes such as drift and selection (ROUSSET (2002), F U et al. (2003)). However, for real
plant populations marker information is available for at most a few thousands of genotypes, and more often several
hundreds. To assess variance and bias of ĥ2r and ĥ2m in such populations we used simulated traits.
2 The number of replicates r is considered fixed here. The asymptotic arguments are all with respect to n, the number of genotypes. The
behavior of Var(ĥ2m ) as a function of n, h2 and K can also be derived from approximations recently proposed in V ISSCHER and G ODDARD
(2014), independently from the present work.

Heritability estimates for simulated data
We analyzed simulated traits for the 4 populations of A. thaliana, for different genetic architectures. We also used
the simulations to compare these marker-based estimators with the broad-sense heritability estimator Ĥ 2 , which
ignores genetic relatedness, and to investigate the quality of heritability confidence intervals.
Heritability estimates for the structured RegMap and HapMap are given in Figure 1 and Table 3. Apart from
ĥ2m in the HapMap, none of the estimators showed marked bias. In particular, Ĥ 2 had negligible bias, despite
the fact that it does not account for genetic relatedness. As in the asymptotic results, ĥ2r had lower variance than
ĥ2m , the difference being largest for the HapMap. The magnitude of the differences was larger than expected from
the asymptotic variances in Table 2, and in the HapMap standard errors were up to 13 times larger. As in the
asymptotic framework, differences were smallest for the structured RegMap and largest for the HapMap.
Remarkably, also Ĥ 2 was considerably more accurate than ĥ2m . The additional marker information appeared
to be less important here than the loss of information on within genotype variability. The estimator ĥ2r , which
includes both sources of information, outperformed Ĥ 2 . Differences were largest for the structured RegMap
(12.7% reduction when h2 = 0.2, 42.6% reduction when h2 = 0.8), where the large differences in relatedness
provide more information than in case of the HapMap (almost no difference when h2 = 0.2 and 7% reduction
when h2 = 0.8). Simulation results for the Swedish and French RegMap are given in Figure S3 and Table S2.
In terms of standard deviations of ĥ2r , ĥ2m and Ĥ 2 , these populations were somewhere in between the structured
RegMap and HapMap.
For a substantial proportion of the simulated traits in both the HapMap and structured RegMap, we observed
a phenomenon that was not apparent from the asymptotic arguments above: ĥ2m was close or equal to 1, in which
case the likelihood as function of h2 was monotonically increasing. This behavior is most likely to occur when
the genetic relatedness matrix is close to compound symmetry (i.e. all genotypes being equally related), in which
case the likelihood is constant in h2 (File S3). The small sample size can then lead to monotone likelihood profiles
(Figure S4). Indeed ĥ2m was equal to 1 most often for the HapMap: even for a simulated heritability of 0.5, ĥ2m was
larger than 0.99 for 882 of the 5000 traits (Figure 1). For the HapMap and simulated h2 = 0.2, we also observed
ĥ2m equal to zero.
The simulations were repeated for a genetic architecture where only ten percent of the genetic variance consists
of polygenic effects, and the remaining 90% is determined by a single QTL (File S4). Even in this extreme scenario,
ĥ2r still performed very well, having almost negligible bias. Also the improvement in standard error relative to ĥ2m
remained similar.

Confidence intervals
For all simulated traits we calculated both standard and log-transformed confidence intervals for narrow sense
heritability (h2 ), using genotypic means as well as individual plant data. Also confidence intervals for broad-sense
heritability (H 2 ) were calculated (We recall that only additive genetic effects were simulated, hence h2 = H 2 ).
Coverage and width of confidence intervals are given in Table 4, and Table S3 (Swedish and French RegMap).
The standard 95% intervals obtained from the individual observations (i.e. those associated with ĥ2r ) had around
95% coverage in the simulations, while coverage was below 95% for the intervals based on genotypic means. The
latter intervals also had larger width, which relates to the higher variance of ĥ2m in simulations. For the HapMap
average width was larger than 0.5, even at a simulated heritability of 0.2. For the simulated traits with ĥ2m = 1, the
corresponding confidence interval was [0, 1].
Differences between the log-transformed and the standard intervals were small for ĥ2r . For ĥ2m the use of the
log-transformed intervals gave bigger improvements, although coverage was still below 95%. Also the confidence
intervals for broad-sense heritability had insufficient coverage. This is due to model-misspecification: the analysis
of variance does not incorporate the genetic structure, and uncertainty in the estimates is therefore underestimated.
Coverage was still around 93% for the HapMap, whereas for the structured RegMap it decreased to 67.6% for
h2 = 0.8.

Heritability estimates for real data
The heritability estimates ĥ2r , ĥ2m and Ĥ 2 were calculated for the six traits. Genotypic means were calculated as
the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUEs) for the genetic effects, in a linear model containing fixed effects for
both genotype and additional design effects (Appendix A). In the calculation of ĥ2m the non-diagonal covariance
structure of the BLUEs was taken into account. In the case of ĥ2r and Ĥ 2 , design effects were directly included in
the mixed model.

For the flowering traits from ATWELL et al. (2010), our estimates of broad-sense heritability were 0.858 for
LDV and 0.966 for LD (Table 5). For several reasons (File S2), these values were lower than those reported in
Supplementary table 7 of ATWELL et al. (2010): 0.94 for LDV and 0.99 for LD. For both traits, marker-based
heritability estimates based on individual plant data (ĥ2r ) were substantially lower, but still high (0.80 for LDV and
0.93 for LD). Marker-based heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means (ĥ2m ) were very different: much
lower in case of LDV (0.51), and equal to 1 for LD. (Table 5 and Figure 2). In the latter case, the likelihood as a
function of h2 was monotonically increasing, just as we observed for some of the simulated traits. The estimate of
residual variance (not reported) was virtually zero in this case, and the confidence interval equal to the whole unit
interval. Also in the leaf area experiments there were substantial differences between ĥ2r and ĥ2m , especially for
the Swedish RegMap (ĥ2r = 0.21 versus ĥ2m =0.09). Heritability estimates were larger for the HapMap (ĥ2r = 0.38
versus ĥ2m =0.34), which has greater genetic diversity. Again, confidence intervals associated with ĥ2m were wider
than those associated with ĥ2r . In the final experiment, heritability estimates for BT were very similar to those for
LD: ĥ2m equalled 1, and ĥ2r and Ĥ 2 were close to 1. For LW we found ĥ2m = 0.16, much lower than ĥ2r = 0.55.
The latter was slightly larger than the broad-sense heritability estimate Ĥ 2 = 0.53, but the confidence intervals
largely overlap.

Genomic prediction with G-BLUP
The best linear unbiased predictor of the genetic effects (G-BLUP) depends on the estimated genetic- and residual
variance, and hence on the estimated heritability (H ENDERSON (1975), ROBINSON (1991)). Therefore genomic
prediction with G-BLUP could potentially be improved when individual plant data are used, instead of genotypic
means. We compared G-BLUP based on genotypic means and individual plant data using simulated traits, each
including a training set of n = 200 genotypes and a validation set of m = 50 genotypes, for which only marker
information was available. For both sets of genotypes, we obtained the G-BLUP (Ĝ) predicting the true (simulated)
genetic effects G, and calculated the prediction accuracy in terms of the correlation (r) between Ĝ and G.
For the training and validation sets, accuracy decreased when the estimated heritability was too far from the
simulated heritability (Figures 3 and 4, Table S5). For the validation sets there were larger differences in accuracy
across simulations, because of the additional randomness in the selection of the validation genotypes, creating
varying degrees of connectedness with the training-sets. When using individual plant data, heritability estimates
were never far from the simulated heritability, and prediction accuracy was close to a constant depending on the
simulated heritability. Using only genotypic means, heritability was often be severely over- or underestimated,
in which case accuracy decreased substantially. This decrease was largest when heritability was underestimated,
which follows from the mathematical expressions for G-BLUP (Materials and methods and File S5).
In the HapMap population with simulated heritability 0.8, the estimate ĥ2r was between 0.7 and 0.9 for 4998 of
the 5000 simulated traits, and accuracy (r) averaged over these simulations was 0.431 (Table 6). The heritability
estimate based on means (ĥ2m ) was however between 0.1 and 0.3 for 8.4% of the simulated traits, and for 2.6%
it was even smaller than 0.1. Averaged over the latter group of traits, accuracy was only 0.289. Consequently,
for these traits an improvement in accuracy of 49% could be realized by genomic prediction based on individual
plant data instead of genotypic means. Averaged over all simulated traits, the prediction accuracy obtained from
genotypic means was not much lower, because of the large ’safe zone’ where the approaches performed similarly:
accuracy was at least 0.4 once the estimated heritability was above 0.5. It is impossible however to determine
whether a given trait is within this zone using genotypic means only. When individual plant data are available the
heritability estimates ĥ2r and ĥ2m could be compared, and the G-BLUP based on genotypic means could be used if
ĥ2r and ĥ2m were similar.
Similar results were obtained for prediction accuracy observed in cross-validations on the 6 observed traits
(Figure 5). Averaged over 500 validation sets, prediction accuracies obtained with individual plant data and means
were almost the same for LDV, LD and BT (respectively 0.77, 0.82 and 0.67). For LA(S), LA(H) and LW,
average accuracy was respectively 0.22, 0.27 and 0.04 when using genotypic means, and 0.23, 0.28 and 0.11
when using individual plant data. For LDV, the heritability estimates obtained using genotypic means followed a
bimodal pattern, which was largely due to accession 8233, for which only a single observation was available, and
which genotypically is an outlier (Figure S6). Despite the fact that the standard errors and correlations among the
genotypic means were taken into account, training sets including this accession produced much lower heritability
estimates than in cases where it was assigned to the validation set. This however did not lead to lower prediction
accuracy. More generally, the relation between low prediction accuracy and underestimating heritability was less
clear than in Figure 4, which may be due to the additional uncertainty in the estimation of fixed effects, and the fact
that this concerns a sub-sampling of observed traits, rather than simulated traits. Nonetheless, genomic prediction
based on individual plant data again performed at least as good as the standard approach based on means, and
much better in case of LW.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
Many state-of-the-art methods for GWAS (K ANG et al. (2010), L IPPERT et al. (2011), Z HOU and S TEPHENS
(2012), L IPKA et al. (2012)) use the same mixed model as in marker-based estimation of heritability, apart from
the additional marker effect (Appendix D). When testing the significance of this marker effect, the estimated
genetic and residual variance (and hence the heritability) determine the correction for population structure or
2
genetic effects elsewhere on the genome. This suggests that poor estimation of the variance components σA
and
2
σE may also affect association mapping, especially when these are estimated in a model without marker effects and
then kept fixed when calculating generalized least squares (GLS) estimates of marker effects (K ANG et al. (2010)).
The GLS estimate of the fixed effects (including the marker effect) β̂ = (X t V −1 X)−1 X t V −1 Y is unbiased since
2
2
the expectation of Y is Xβ. Hence E(β̂) = β, even conditionally on a poor estimate of V = σ̂A
ZKZ t + σ̂E
IN .

However, p-values for the significance of marker effects will be more sensitive to poor estimates of (σA , σE
)
than the effect estimates themselves. We investigated this with GWAS on simulated traits for the HapMap and
RegMap populations, which was performed on genotypic means (two-stage) and individual plant data (one-stage).
Rank correlations between between one- and two-stage −log10 p-values were almost 1 when ĥ2m was close to
the simulated heritability, and decreased when ĥ2m under- or over-estimated heritability (Figure S7). However,
even then correlations were still high, and the resulting loss in power appeared to be limited (Figure 6). For
the RegMap (results not shown) differences between ROC curves were even smaller. In contrast to the accuracy
of genomic prediction, these differences remained small when restricting the set of simulated traits to those for
which ĥ2m underestimated the simulated heritability (curves not shown). This may be explained by the fact that the
2
2
correlation between β̂ and (σ̂A
, σ̂E
) tends to zero for large numbers of genotypes (C ASELLA and M C C ULLOCH
(2006)).

Software
In most of our analyses and simulations we used the commercial R-package asreml (B UTLER et al. (2009)),
which contains a fast implementation of the AI-algorithm. We also made our own implementation of the AIalgorithm, together with functions for estimating heritability. These are contained in the R-package heritability,
which is freely available online. In contrast to other packages such as emma and synbreed, it provides confidence intervals for heritability.
For GWAS on simulated traits we developed the command-line program scan_GLS, which is available on
request. scan_GLS performs generalized least squares calculations conditional on variance components estimated
in a model without markers, as proposed by K ANG et al. (2010), and can efficiently handle genetically identical
individuals. State-of-the-art association mapping software can only perform association mapping on genetically
identical individuals, when these are given different identifiers, i.e. as if they were different genotypes. This leads
to large genotypic data files and increases computation time. The generalized least squares (GLS) calculations
in scan_GLS are more efficient since they use the fact that ZKZ t and K have the same rank. This has been
proposed in L IPPERT et al. (2011) (supplement), but to our knowledge this has not been implemented in the FastLMM software. Although we did not find one-stage GWAS to be more powerful in the present study, the ability
to perform fast association mapping for genetically identical individuals is useful in the context of a compressed
kinship matrix (B RADBURY et al. (2007), Z HANG et al. (2010), L IPKA et al. (2012)). scan_GLS also includes a
function to perform GLS calculations with non-diagonal residual variance structure, allowing association mapping
with extra (possibly non-genetic) random effects.

Discussion
We have presented new methodology for marker-based estimation of heritability for plant traits, which accounts
for genetic relatedness and includes information on within genotype variability, available from replicates. Our
approach offers an alternative to mixed-model analysis based on genotypic means, which is the current practice in
GWAS and genomic prediction with G-BLUP. Although mixed models can indeed estimate heritability from only
kinship coefficients and genotypic means, we observed very large standard errors and sometimes unrealistic estimates of heritability, in both published data and new experiments. Using simulations and statistical arguments we
showed that marker-based estimation of heritability based on genotypic means has indeed severe limitations when
applied to commonly used association panels in A. thaliana. The main reason for this is the lack of information on
within genotype variability: heritability estimates are exclusively based on the (usually small) differences between
genotypes. This is feasible in human cohorts with many thousands of individuals, but gives insufficient information in plant populations with only several hundreds of different genotypes, even if standard errors of genotypic
means are taken into account. Much more accurate heritability estimates were obtained with mixed model analysis
8

at individual plant or plot level. The resulting heritability estimates had accuracies similar to those reported for
human diseases (see e.g. S PEED et al. (2012)). In our simulations with 200 genotypes, the difference in accuracy
relative to that of estimates obtained from genotypic means was larger than what was expected from the asymptotic variances. The reason for this larger difference appeared to be the monotone likelihood profile occurring in
a substantial part of the simulations, giving heritability estimates of zero or one. However even without this phenomenon, heritability estimation using individual plant data is more precise, and the asymptotic approximations
appear to provide a lower bound on the gain in accuracy.
Mixed model analysis at individual plant level can also improve accuracy of G-BLUP, in particular when the
actual heritability is underestimated. Too much shrinkage then leads to lower prediction accuracy. In GWAS,
where the interest is in the estimated marker effects rather than the variance components, inclusion of individual
plant gave almost no increase in power. However, the possibility to include covariates observed at individual plant
level may be an important practical advantage. While two-stage procedures are usually considered preferable in
complex multi-experiment settings (W ELHAM et al. (2010), P IEPHO et al. (2012)), a one-stage approach may give
a more convenient and less error-prone analysis of a single experiment with a simple design.
State-of-the-art phenotyping platforms can measure plant traits with increasing accuracy and throughput. Compared to human traits, the key advantages are that phenotyping is performed under experimental conditions and
can include different individuals of the same genotype. Our findings suggest that in order to fully exploit these
advantages, statistical analysis at individual plant level is necessary. Obviously, this requires the availability of
the individual plant data, as well as covariates. For many studies in the literature this information is however not
available, since most online resources only store genotypic means. More specifically, our results are relevant in the
light of the missing heritability debate. Although the aim here was not to propose specific explanations for missing
heritability, any such explanation clearly requires an accurate estimate of heritability in the first place. Standard
errors for heritability are commonly reported for human traits, but usually absent in the A. thaliana literature. We
demonstrated that these standard errors can be extremely large when using mixed models at genotypic means level.
Explaining missing heritability based on such estimates then becomes an unreasonable goal.
For two flowering traits, from both a published and a new experiment, ĥ2m was equal to 1. In these cases, also
2
ĥr and the broad-sense heritability estimates (Ĥ 2 ) were very high. This can partly be explained by the discrete
scale (in whole days) on which the traits were measured. Some genotypes therefore had exactly equal phenotypic
values in all or many of the replicates. The heritability estimates for LD were also affected by the fact that in the
ATWELL et al. (2010) data, all non-flowering plants were given a phenotypic value of 200. However, the estimates
ĥ2m being equal to 1 also occurred for some of our simulated (Gaussian) traits, and has a more fundamental reason:
the small number of genotypes (compared to human studies) leads to monotone likelihood profiles and very large
standard errors, making it hard to make any statement about heritability.
Recently, S PEED et al. (2012) showed that heritability estimates may become biased when linkage disequilibrium (LD) is not constant over the genome, and proposed LD-adjusted kinship (LDAK) matrices to correct for
this. To assess the effect on ĥ2r and ĥ2m we re-calculated these heritability estimates using an LD-adjusted kinship
matrix (Figure S5 and Table S4). For all traits the estimates ĥ2r were very close to the values obtained using the
unadjusted kinship matrix. The estimates ĥ2m on the other hand were quite different for several traits. Nevertheless,
the same problems occurred: very large confidence intervals, and estimates that appear biologically unrealistic. We
conclude that ĥ2m is more sensitive to the choice of kinship matrix than ĥ2r , and that the different behavior of ĥ2r
and ĥ2m cannot be explained by LD being different over the genome.
The mixed models analysis at individual plant level proposed here can be extended in several ways, for example by partitioning the genetic variance into different chromosomal contributions, as in YANG et al. (2011), or
by including epistatic effects. The latter has been proposed for experimental populations with known pedigrees
(OAKEY et al. (2007)), but marker-based estimation of epistatic effects for natural populations appears only possible with more advanced statistical methodology, for example semi-parametric mixed models and reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (G IANOLA and VAN K AAM (2008), H OWARD et al. (2014)). Another direction for future
research is the estimation of heritability in the presence of additional random effects, which would increase the
applicability to agricultural field trials (where the raw data are usually at plot rather than individual plant level).
Although our approach allows for missing values, it does assume that all design effects can be modeled as fixed.
Field trials are often laid out in incomplete blocks, containing only a small number of the genotypes under study.
Differences between such blocks are usually best modeled using random block effects. The definition of heritability in such contexts is however far from obvious: OAKEY et al. (2007) proposed generalized heritability, but for
natural populations this definition is not equivalent to the classical definition of heritability (OAKEY et al. (2007),
page 813). In this case the ratio of the estimated genetic variance over the total phenotypic variance could be used
as a lower bound on heritability. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that mixed model analysis at individual plant
or plot level offers important advantages over mixed models for genotypic means.

Appendix A

Marker-based estimation of heritability

We start with a brief summary of existing methodology and the required assumptions, and then define marker-based
heritability estimates given genetically identical replicates measured in an unbalanced design.

Marker-based estimation of heritability given a single observation per genotype
Phenotypic variance can be partitioned as
2
2
2
2
2
2
σPheno
= σG
+ σEnv
= σA
+ σD
+ σI2 + σEnv
,
2
where the genetic variance σG
is decomposed into additive, dominance and interaction effects (FALCONER and
M ACKAY (1996)), the dominance effect being absent for inbred lines. Heritability in the broad sense is defined as
2
2
2
2
H 2 = σG
/σPheno
, while the narrow-sense heritability h2 = σA
/σPheno
takes into account only the additive genetic
2
effects, which determine breeding values and the selection response. Defining the residual variance σE
to be the
2
2
2
sum of the environmental and non-additive genetic variance terms (σD + σI + σEnv ), we can write

h2 =

2
σA

2
σA
2 .
+ σE

(10)

Marker-based estimates of narrow-sense heritability can be obtained using mixed models with random genetic
effects. The covariances between these effects are modeled by a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) estimated from
markers, with elements given by (1). Given a single observation per genotype, the standard infinitesimal model is
Yi = µ + xi β + Gi + Ei

(i = 1, . . . , n),

(11)

2
K) distribution, and the errors Ei have independent normal
µ is the intercept, G = (G1 , . . . , Gn ) has a N (0, σA
(1)
(k)
2
. The optional term xi β = xi β1 + . . . + xi βk models the effect of k additional
distributions with variance σE
covariates. Under model (11), heritability can be estimated by

ĥ2 =

2
σ̂A

2
σ̂A
2 ,
+ σ̂E

(12)

2
2
where σ̂A
and σ̂E
are restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of additive genetic and residual variance
(YANG et al. (2011), S PEED et al. (2012)).
It has been noted (e.g. H AYES et al. (2009)) that using model (11) with genetic relatedness matrix (1) is
equivalent to assuming that the effects of the the standardized marker scores are drawn independently from Gaus2
/p. Consequently, the model can only account for additive genetic effects, and
sian distributions with variance σA
non-additive effects will get into the residual variance. This is why ĥ2 is an estimate of narrow-sense heritability.
The preceding argument also highlights the fact that ĥ2 is a marker based estimate, which requires the (frequently
made) assumptions that every causal locus is tagged by one of the markers, and that linkage-disequilibrium (LD)
is constant across the genome (S PEED et al. (2012)). For the case that LD is not constant over the genome, S PEED
et al. (2012) proposed LD-adjusted kinship matrices.
2
The parameter σA
can only be interpreted as additive genetic variance if K is scaled appropriately. For the
kinship matrix used here this is the case, but for different types of kinship matrix (e.g. identity by state), it
is necessary to divide each coefficient by tr(P KP )/(n − 1), for P = In − 110 /n. Under the condition that
tr(P KP ) = n − 1,

Marker-based estimation of heritability given genetically identical replicates, for unbalanced designs
When for each genotype a number of genetically identical individuals are observed, (11) generalizes to
Yi,j = µ + xi,j β + Gi + Ei,j

(i = 1, . . . , n,

14

j = 1, . . . , ri ),

(14)

where Yi,j is the phenotypic response of replicate j of genotype i, xi,j a vector of fixed effects, G = (G1 , . . . , Gn )
2
2
has a N (0, σA
K) distribution, and the errors Ei,j have independent normal distributions with variance σE
. The
last equation is similar to equation (2) apart from the additional covariates and the generally unbalanced design.
2
2
Analogous to the case of balanced designs, we use the estimator ĥ2r defined in (3), for REML estimates σ̂A
and σ̂E
obtained for model (14).
Heritability estimates based on genotypic means can be constructed as in equations (4)-(5), except that these
genotypic means are no longer equal to the arithmetic averages Ȳi . We fit the linear model
Y = XG g + XC β + E,

(15)

where Y = (Y1,1 , . . . , Y1,r1 , . . . , Yn,1 , . . . , Yn,rn )t is the vector of phenotypic observations, ri is the number of
replicates of genotype i, XC is the design matrix of the extra fixed effects, and E = (E1,1 , . . . , En,rn )t is the
2
vector of independent Gaussian errors with variance σE
. This model is identical to (14), apart from the factor
genotype now being fixed instead
of
random.
The
intercept
is included in the incidence matrix XG , which has
Pn
dimension N × n, for N = i=1 ri .
We obtain least squares estimates ĝ = (ĝ1 , . . . , ĝn )t for the genotypic effects in model (15), which form the
basis for the subsequent analysis. In mixed-model terminology, this is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE)
for g. In (15) the only random term is E, i.e. we consider an ordinary linear model, as the additional covariates are
all assumed to be fixed. The least-squares estimator (ĝ, β̂) is given by

The mixed-model (4), used for the estimation of heritability, now naturally generalizes to
Ȳi = µ + Gi + Ei ,

2
G ∼ N (0, σA
K),

2
E ∼ N (0, σE
R),

(18)

where, to avoid having twice the letter g in the same equation, we abused the notation by writing Ȳi instead of
2
2
ĝi . Hence the matrix r−1 In in (4) is replaced by R. Given REML estimates σ̂A
and σ̂E
for this model, we use
ĥ2m in (5) as heritability estimate. As in the case of a completely randomized design, ĥ2m is a so-called two-stage
estimator. The fact that genotype is taken as fixed effect in the first stage (15) and as random in the subsequent
mixed model analysis may appear inelegant, but is common in two-stage analyses, and necessary to avoid shrinking
twice.
Pni
In case of a completely randomized design with ri replicates without further covariates, ĝi = j=1
Yi,j /ni
and
t
R = (XG
XG )−1 = diag(r1−1 , . . . , rn−1 ).
Note that in contrast to the estimator of broad-sense heritability described below, it is not necessary to define
an average number of replicates. In case of a randomized complete block design with r replicates, XC is the
t
nr × (r − 1) design matrix for the factor block, and XG
XC (XCt XC )−1 XCt XG is the n × n matrix with elements
(r − 1)/n. Hence, R is not diagonal, even though the design is balanced. The off-diagonal elements are equal in
this case, and small (provided n is large sufficiently). With n = 200 and r = 3 for example, the diagonal elements
of R are 0.336667 and the off-diagonal elements are 0.003333. For unbalanced designs, some of the off-diagonal
elements may be larger and more influential.

For the purpose of genomic prediction, 50 additional genotypes were drawn randomly from the same subpopulation

Appendix C

Genomic prediction with G-BLUP

Genomic prediction with G-BLUP relies on the same models used for marker based estimation of heritability, and
can be based on individual plant data (one-stage) or genotypic means (two-stage). We now provide the expressions
for one- and two-stage G-BLUP, which are based on models (14) and (18) in Appendix A.

One- and two-stage G-BLUP for the training and validation set
First we consider the G-BLUP for the training-set, for which phenotypic observations are available. Including the
intercept in the design matrix, model (14) can be rewritten as
Y = Xβ + ZG + E,

(22)

where N is the total number of individuals and Z is the N ×n incidence matrix assigning individuals to genotypes.
The BLUP of G = (G1 , . . . , Gn )t and the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of β are given by
Ĝ = δ̂KZ t (δ̂ZKZ t + IN )−1 (Y − X β̂),

β̂ = (X t (δ̂ZKZ t + IN )−1 X)−1 X t (δ̂ZKZ t + IN )−1 Y,

(23)

where N is the total number of individuals, Z is the N ×n incidence matrix assigning individuals to genotypes, and
2
2
δ̂ = σ̂A
/σ̂E
. Numerically Ĝ and β̂ can be more conveniently obtained by solving the mixed model equations (see
e.g. H ENDERSON (1975) or ROBINSON (1991)). Similar expressions hold for predictions based on the genotypic
means following model (18):
Ĝ = δ̂K(δ̂K + R)−1 (Ȳ − 1n µ̂),

µ̂ = (1tn (δ̂K + R)−1 1n )−1 1tn (δ̂K + R)−1 Ȳ ,

16

(24)

where, as in (18), Ȳ denotes the vector of genotypic means obtained from preliminary linear model analysis (not
necessarily the arithmetic averages). Since we assume that all covariates have been accounted for already in this
preliminary analysis, the only fixed effect in (24) is an intercept, with design matrix X = 1n .
Assuming the one-stage model (22) and β̂ given by (32), the genetic effects Gpred = (Gn+1 , . . . , Gn+m )t of
m unobserved (but genotyped) genotypes can be predicted by the conditional means
(1)

Ĝpred := E[Gpred |Y ] = δ̂Kpred.obs Z t (δ̂ZKZ t + IN )−1 (Y − X β̂),

(25)

where Kpred.obs is the m×n matrix of kinship coefficients for the unobserved versus observed genotypes. Assuming
the two-stage model (18) and µ̂ given by (24), the predictor is given by
(2)

Ĝpred = δ̂Kpred.obs (δ̂K + R)−1 (Ȳ − 1n µ̂).

(26)

Prediction of new observations and cross-validation
For new observations Ypred at individual plant level, we have the one-stage predictor
(1)

(1)

Ŷpred = Xpred β̂ + Zpred Ĝpred ,

(27)

where Xpred and Zpred are the corresponding design matrices. For predictions with genotypic means, we replace
(1)
(2)
Ĝpred by Ĝpred , and β by the estimate obtained within the linear model (15) in the preliminary stage.

Appendix D

Genome-wide association studies

In mixed-model based GWAS (K ANG et al. (2010), L IPPERT et al. (2011), Z HOU and S TEPHENS (2012), L IPKA
et al. (2012)) the phenotype of genotype i is modeled as
Yi = µ + xi γ + Gi + Ei ,

(28)

where xi is the marker score, γ is the marker effect and the genotypic effects G = (G1 , . . . , Gn ) follow a
2
N (0, σA
K) distribution. This model assumes a single observation per genotype. If observations on genetically
identical individuals are available, the Yi ’s can be replaced by genotypic means ĝi , as in (16), (17) and (18). Model
(28) then generalizes to
ĝi = µ + xi γ + Gi + Ei ,

2
G ∼ N (0, σA
K),

2
E ∼ N (0, σE
R).

(29)

This amounts to a two-stage approach: first the genotypic means are calculated using (16), and next association
mapping is performed following (29). In practice GWAS is often performed on the arithmetic averages Ȳi , which
implicitly assumes a balanced completely randomized design, without any missing values or replicate effects. Here
we use the more general model (29). Apart from the additional marker effect, this is the same model we used in
(18) to construct the heritability estimate ĥ2m .
Alternatively, association mapping can be based on the one-stage model
Yi,j = µ + xi γ + (XC )i,j β + Gi + Ei,j ,

(30)

where the term (XC )i,j β models additional covariates, as in (15). In the two-stage GWAS, this information is
accounted for in the genotypic means ĝi . In models (29) and (30) we test the hypothesis γ = 0 using the F-test,
conditional on estimates of the variance components obtained from a model without markers (K ANG et al. (2010)).
When marker effects are small, these estimates are a good approximation of the exact estimates, obtained when
genetic- and residual variance are re-estimated for each marker.

Appendix E

Phenotypic data

Collection of phenotypic data For the two flowering traits from ATWELL et al. (2010) (LDV and LD), details
can be found in the original publication. In the case of LD, all plants that had not flowered by the end of the
experiment were given a phenotypic value of 200 days. The leaf area trait (LA(S)/LA(H)) was measured in two
separate experiments on the Swedish RegMap and the HapMap, using the same phenotyping platform. The plants
were imaged top down for projected leaf area every day. The images were taken using near infrared light (790nm)
so as not to influence the photoperiod during the night measurements. In our final experiment, Bolting time (BT)
17

and leaf width (LW) were measured for the HapMap. BT was noted as the number of days after vernalization on
which the plant started to bolt. LW was measured on photographs taken from the longest leaf two weeks after
flowering.
Plant growth conditions In the leaf-area experiments, seeds from the Arabidopsis Swedish RegMap (298
accessions) and Arabidopsis HapMap (350 accessions) were stratified at 4 ◦ C for 4 days, and sown on Rockwool
blocks which had been covered with black foamed PVC sheet to prevent algal growth and provide a uniform
background for automated image analysis. The growth conditions were a light intensity of 200 µ mol m−2 s−1 ,
10h SD, 20/18 ◦ C day/night cycle, 70% RH. In the experiment measuring BT and LW on the HapMap, seeds were
sown on filter paper with demi water and stratified at 4 ◦ C in dark conditions for 5 days. Following stratification,
seeds were transferred to a culture room (16h LD, 24 ◦ C) to induce seed germination for 42h. Germinating seeds
were then transplanted to wet Rockwool blocks of 4 x 4 cm in a climate chamber with a light intensity of 125
µ mol m−2 s−1 16h LD, 20/18 ◦ C day/ night cycle, 70% RH. All plants were watered every morning for 5 min at
9am with 1/1000 Hyponex solution (Hyponex, Osaka, Japan). 19 days after germination, all plants were vernalized
for 6 weeks in a cold room (12h L, 4 ◦ C). After the 6-weeks vernalization period plants were transferred back to
the same climate chamber in the same order, but given more space to grow.
Genotypic means All experiments were laid out as randomized complete block designs, apart from the final
HapMap experiment (BT and LW), where the same randomization was used within each replicate. In all experiments we included a replicate (complete block) effect. The numbers of replicates in the different experiments
were 6 (LD and LDV), 4 (LA(S)/LA(H)) and 3 (BT and LW). Due to non-germinating seeds and dead plants,
some accessions had lower numbers of replicates. For the leaf area experiments (LA(S)/LA(H)) we additionally
included a row and column effect to model the within image position of each plant (x = 1, 2, 3 and y = 1, 2, 3, 4).
These factors correct for technical artifacts, which are known to be consistent across replicates.

Figure 1: Heritability estimates for 5000 simulated traits for random samples of 200 accessions drawn from
the Structured RegMap (top panel) and the HapMap (bottom panel). 20 QTLs were simulated, which explained half of the genetic variance. The simulated heritability was 0.2 (left column), 0.5 (middle column) and 0.8
(right column). Within each panel, the first row shows the ANOVA-based estimates of broad-sense heritability, the
second row the mixed model based estimates based on the individual plant data, and the third row the mixed model
based estimates based on genotypic means.

Heritability
Figure 2: Heritability estimates and confidence intervals for two flowering traits from Atwell et al. 2010
(LDV and LD), and 4 traits from new experiments. Three estimators were used: the ANOVA-based estimator
of broad-sense heritability (Ĥ 2 , green), the marker-based estimator using individual plant data (ĥ2r , blue) and the
marker-based estimator using genotypic means (ĥ2m , brown). Traits from different experiments are separated by the
black horizontal lines. Trait abbreviations are given in Table 1. Confidence intervals associated with the markerbased estimates are constructed using the logarithmic transformation described in the Materials and Methods.

Figure 5: Prediction accuracy (r) of G-BLUP in 500 cross-validations, for 6 traits observed on A. thaliana.
In each cross-validation, the accessions are randomly partitioned into a training set of 80% and a validation set of
20% of the accessions. Predictions for the individual plant data for for the accessions in the validation set were
obtained from equation (27) in Appendix C. The genetic effects in (27) were estimated either using individual plant
data (blue) or using genotypic means (orange).

Figure 6: Receiver operating characteristic for the GWAS-simulations. 1000 traits were simulated, for random
samples of 200 accessions drawn from the HapMap. 10 QTLs were simulated, at randomly chosen SNP-positions
(see the simulation section in the Materials and Methods for more details). The QTLs explained 75% of the genetic
variance. The simulated heritability was 0.5. The curves were obtained by moving from a small (conservative)
significance threshold to a larger one. Simulated QTLs were counted as true positive if their p-value was below the
threshold; all other SNPs below the threshold were counted as false positive.

Table 2: Asymptotic distribution of marker-based heritability estimators: standard deviations of the estimators based on replicates, and between brackets the ratios of the standard deviations of the estimators based
on replicates over those based on means. Asymptotic variances were obtained using the expressions in equation
(9). Four populations of A. thaliana were considered (containing respectively 250, 350, 305 and 204 accessions),
two populations of Z. mays (Van Heerwaarden et al. 2012, 400 accessions; Riedelsheimer et al. 2012, 280 accessions) and one population of O. sativa (Zhao et al. 2011, 413 accessions). The second column gives the number of

Table 6: Prediction accuracy (r) of G-BLUP for 5000 simulated traits, for the HapMap population. Each
trait was simulated for a randomly drawn training (200 accessions) and validation set (50 accessions). Genetic
effects were predicted using G-BLUP, based on either a mixed model for the individual plants (replicates) or
for the genotypic means. The second and third column contain the percentage of the 5000 traits for which the
corresponding heritability estimates (ĥ2r and ĥ2m ) were contained in the intervals in the first column. The remaining
columns show the correlation (r) between simulated and predicted genetic effects, averaged over these traits. The
simulated heritability was 0.8; 20 QTLs were simulated, which explained 50 percent of the genetic variance.

File S1: confidence intervals for broad-sense heritability
Confidence intervals for the broad-sense heritability estimates obtain from the ANOVA mean sums of squares
are traditionally obtained from the ratio F = M S(G)/M S(E) and the quantiles of the F-distribution with the
corresponding degrees of freedom. Given n genotypes with r1 , . . . , rn replicates, the intervals are given by
F/Fdf1,df2,0.05 − 1
F/Fdf1,df2,0.95 − 1
< H2 <
,
F/Fdf1,df2,0.95 + r̄ − 1
F/Fdf1,df2,0.05 + r̄ − 1
P
P
P
P
where df1 = n − 1, df2 = (ri − 1) and r̄ = (n − 1)−1 ( ri − ( ri2 )/( ri )). In case of a balanced design
with ri = r replicates, this reduces to r̄ = r and df2 = n(r − 1). See LYNCH and WALSH (1998) (p.563) or
S INGH et al. (1993).

File S2: analysis of flowering traits of ATWELL et al. (2010)
Our broad-sense heritability estimates differ from those reported in Supplementary table 7 of ATWELL et al. (2010),
for the following three reasons. First, the broad-sense heritability estimates in ATWELL et al. (2010) were calculated using the formula
M S(G)
.
(31)
M S(G) + M S(E)
Although this quantity may be an adequate criterion to compare heritabilities of traits within the same experiment
(as long as they have the same number of replicates), this is a biased estimator of broad-sense-heritability. Since
2
2
the expectation of M S(G) is rσG
+ σE
, M S(G)/(M S(G) + M S(E)) will tend to overestimate heritability. The
usual estimator defined in the materials and methods section is also biased, but this bias is usually small, and (in
contrast to (31)) tends to zero when the number of genotypes increases (N YQUIST and BAKER (1991), S INGH
et al. (1993)).
Second, broad-sense heritability estimates in ATWELL et al. (2010) were based on more accessions: 189 for
LDV and 186 for LD. To allow a direct comparison with mixed model analysis we restricted our analysis to
genotyped accessions, excluding 21 accessions for LDV and for 19 LD. This had little impact on heritability
estimates.
Third, the analysis of variance in ATWELL et al. (2010) did not include a replicate effect. In our analysis, the
mean sums of squares for replicates removes some environmental variance, therefore giving higher estimates than
in an analysis without a replicate effect. This however did not compensate for the use of (31); hence our heritability
estimates are lower than those reported in ATWELL et al. (2010).

31

File S3: the likelihood is constant for a kinship matrix with compound
symmetry structure
Mixed model based estimation of heritability using genotypic means may become problematic when the sample
size is small and the kinship matrix is close to compound symmetry, i.e. the structure where all off-diagonal
elements are equal. Here we show that in the case the kinship matrix is exactly compound symmetry, the likelihood
2
2
2
2
is constant in η = σE
/σA
. We use the notation η to avoid confusion with δ = σA
/σE
, used in our results on
genomic prediction. We write 1n for the n × 1 column vector of ones, and In for the n-dimensional identity
matrix. Finally, let Jn be the n × n matrix of ones.
Suppose that K = In + aJn , for some a > 0. The key observation is that the covariance matrix of the data can
be written as
2

> 0. We can then directly apply
the results in section 3 of ?), with (in their notation) k = 1, d = 1 and X = 1n (we only include an intercept, and
2
2
2
2
no marker effect), and replacing σA
, σE
, η and K by respectively σ̃A
, σ̃E
, η̃ and K̃. In particular, we have the

Figure 7: Heritability estimates for 5000 simulated traits for random samples of 200 accessions drawn from
the Structured regmap (top panel) and the Hapmap (bottom panel). 1 QTL was simulated, which explained
90% of the genetic variance. The simulated heritability was 0.2 (left column), 0.5 (middle column) and 0.8 (right
column). Within each panel, the first row shows the ANOVA-based estimates of broad-sense heritability, the
second row the mixed model based estimates based on the individual data, and the third row the mixed model
based estimates based on genotypic means.

File S5: prediction error variance in the training- and validation set.
We assume a balanced and completely random design, with n genotypes and r replicates. Given the model yi,j =
µ + Gi + Ei,j , the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of G = (G1 , . . . , Gn )t and the best linear unbiased
estimator (BLUE) of µ are given by
Ĝ = δKZ t (δZKZ t + IN )−1 (y − µ̂1N ),

µ̂ =

1tN (δZKZ t + IN )−1 y
,
1tN (δZKZ t + IN )−1 1N

(32)

where δ = σA
/σE
is the shrinkage parameter, N is the total number of individuals and Z is the N × n incidence
matrix assigning individuals to genotypes. See e.g. H ENDERSON (1975) or ROBINSON (1991), or equation (23)
in the present work (Appendix C). The parameter δ = h2 /(1 − h2 ) is a function of the heritability, and determines
the extent to which the phenotypic data y are ’shrunk’ towards zero. When the heritability is high, δ is large, and
there is little shrinkage, i.e. Ĝ will be close to the observed phenotypic observations y. For low heritability, δ is
small, and y will be shrunk towards the vector of zeros. When BLUPs are based on the genotypic means the same
expressions hold, with N = n and Z = In , and Ĝ = δr K(δr K + In )−1 ((ȳ1 , . . . , ȳn )t − µ̂1n ). Since the noise
2
2
2
2
level is reduced from σE
to r−1 σE
, the shrinkage parameter δ becomes σA
/(r−1 σE
).
The preceding expressions assume the shrinkage parameter to be known, while it is usually estimated from the
data. As a consequence, the standard error of µ̂ and prediction error variance of Ĝ obtained by setting δ = δ̂ =
ĥ2 /(1 − ĥ2 ) in (32) are larger than what would be obtained when δ is known (?), ?)). Before we give examples
of too much or too little shrinkage (section E), we first give expressions for the prediction error variance for the
training and validation set, for the case when heritability is known (δ̂ = δ). These can be derived as a special case
of the more general expressions in e.g. H ENDERSON (1975) or ROBINSON (1991).

Prediction error variance when δ = δ̂
First we consider the genetic effects G = (G1 , . . . , Gn )t of the genotypes in the training sample. If we assume
2
K) (i.e. in equation (21) in the main text (Appendix B), γ and the QTL-effects αm are zero),
that G ∼ N (0, σA
the prediction error variance is given by the diagonal elements of
E(Ĝ − G)(Ĝ − G)t = (Z t Z + δ −1 K −1 − Jn )−1 ,

(33)

where Z is the N × n incidence matrix assigning plants to genotypes, and Jn is the n × n matrix with identical
elements 1/n. In case the phenotypic data consists of genotypic means, N = n. For efficient computation, see ?)
?).
The genetic effects Gpred = (Gn+1 , . . . , Gn+m )t of m unobserved (but genotyped) genotypes can be predicted
with the conditional mean
Ĝpred := E[Gpred |y] = δ̂Kpred.obs Z t (δ̂ZKZ t + IN )−1 (y − µ̂1N ),

(34)

where Kpred.obs is the m × n matrix of kinship coefficients for the unobserved versus observed genotypes. To give
expressions for the prediction error variance E(Ĝpred − Gpred )2i0 (i0 = 1, . . . , m) we assume again that γ = 0, all
genetic signal being polygenic. Writing Kpred.pred for the m × m kinship matrix of the unobserved genotypes, it is
assumed that the kinship matrix is the (n + m) × (n + m) block matrix with K and Kpred.pred on the diagonal and
t
off-diagonal blocks Kpred.obs and Kpred.obs
. Then the conditional distribution of Gpred |G is

2
t
Gpred |G ∼ N Kpred.obs K −1 G, σA
Kpred.pred − Kpred.obs K −1 Kpred.obs
.
Since Ĝpred = Kpred.obs K −1 Ĝ (by comparing (32) and (34)), it follows that
(Ĝpred − Gpred )|(Ĝ − G) = Kpred.obs K −1 (Ĝ − G) − Y,

2
t
where Y ∼ N 0, σA
(Kpred.pred − Kpred.obs K −1 Kpred.obs
) .
Consequently, the prediction error variances E(Ĝpred − Gpred )2i are the diagonal elements of
h
i
E(Ĝpred − Gpred )(Ĝpred − Gpred )t = E E(Ĝpred − Gpred )(Ĝpred − Gpred )t | (Ĝ − G)
h
i
t
= (Kpred.obs K −1 ) E(Ĝ − G)(Ĝ − G)t K −1 Kpred.obs

(35)

2
t
+ σA
(Kpred.pred − Kpred.obs K −1 Kpred.obs
).
2
2
Hence, the prediction error variance for the validation set contains a term depending on δ −1 = σE
/σA
(see (33)),
as well as a term which depends only on the genetic variance σA .

36

Prediction error variance with incorrect shrinkage (δ 6= δ̂)
2
2
For the case that the amount of shrinkage is not chosen correctly (δ̂ 6= δ = σA
/(r−1 σE
)), we now give an
expression for the prediction error variance for the training set based on genotypic means, under the additional
assumption that µ is known to be zero. The BLUP for G then simplifies to

Ĝ = δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 ȳ,

(36)

where we recall that we still assume a balanced and completely random design. Hence ȳi = Gi + Ēi , with Ēi ∼
2
2
2
2
N (0, r−1 σE
) and G = (G1 , . . . , Gn )t ∼ N (0, σA
K). Since ȳ = (ȳ1 , . . . , ȳn )t ∼ N (0, σA
K + r−1 σE
In ) =
2
−1
N (0, σE (δK + r In ), the variance-covariance matrix of Ĝ − G equals
2
2
2
Var(Ĝ − G) = σA
K − 2δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 σA
K + δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 (δK + r−1 In )(δ̂K + In )−1 δ̂KσE
,

where we used that (by the independence of G and E)
2
Cov(G, Ĝ) = Cov(G, δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 G) = δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 σA
K
2
and that (using ȳ ∼ N (0, σE
(δK + r−1 In ) and the symmetry of K and In )
2
Ĝ = δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 ȳ ∼ N (0, δ̂K(δ̂K + In )−1 (δK + r−1 In )(δ̂K + In )−1 δ̂KσE
).

In particular, when δ̂ = ∞ (i.e. ĥ2 = 1), there is no shrinkage, and Ĝ = ȳ. The prediction error variance is
then completely determined by the residual variance, since Ĝ − G = ȳ − G = Ē, and
2
E(Ĝ − G)(Ĝ − G)t = r−1 σE
In .

On the other hand, when δ̂ = 0 (i.e. ĥ2 = 0), there is ’total’ shrinkage towards zero, i.e. Ĝ = 0, and
2
E(Ĝ − G)(Ĝ − G)t = E(GGt ) = σA
K.

This explains the asymmetry in the observed accuracy in our simulations, in particular when h2 = 0.5: when the
number of replicates r is sufficiently large, overestimating the heritability will have less impact on the prediction
error variance (and hence accuracy) than underestimating it.

choose one of the 882 traits (17.6%) for which the heritability estimate based on means (ĥ2m ) was larger than 0.99.
For these traits, the heritability estimate based on replicates (ĥ2r ) was on average 0.502. For the trait shown here,

Figure S5 : Heritability estimates and confidence intervals for two flowering traits from ATWELL et al. (2010)
(LDV and LD), and 4 traits from new experiments. Three estimators were used: the ANOVA-based estimator
of broad-sense heritability (Ĥ 2 , green), the marker-based estimator using individual plant data (ĥ2r , blue) and the
marker-based estimator using genotypic means (ĥ2m , brown). Traits from different experiments are separated by
the black horizontal lines. Trait abbreviations are given in Table 1 of the main text. The LD-adjusted kinship matrix
was computed using version 2.0 of the LDAK-software S PEED et al. (2012).We used sections of 1000 SNPs, with a
buffer of 200. The maximum distance considered for LD was 250kb; the ’halflife’ parameter (modeling LD-decay)
was set to 20kb.

heritability estimate hm

Figure S7 : Rank correlation (Spearman ρ2 ) between effect-size estimates obtained with a one- and twostage approach, versus the heritability estimates obtained in the two-stage approach (ĥ2m ). 1000 traits were
simulated for the Structured RegMap (first row) and the HapMap (second row), with a simulated heritability of 0.5.
10 QTLs were simulated, which explained 75% of the genetic variance. Left column: rank correlation between
LOD-scores of all SNPs. Middle column: rank correlation between effect-size estimates for all SNPs. Right
column: rank correlation between effect-size estimates for the 10 simulated QTLs.

Table S1: ecotype-IDs of the structured regmap.
Accession information was taken from the Bergelson lab
(http://bergelson.uchicago.edu/Members/mhorton/resources/snps/accession_coordinates.xls).
The following table contains geographic information for 242 of the 250 accessions from our structured regmap.
Geographic information was not available for eight accessions: 6909, 8428, 5712, 6143, 5708, 5730, 5829 and
8254. Accessions were selected based on the variance of the off-diagonal kinship coefficients of each row: the
accessions corresponding to the rows with the 250 highest variances were chosen.

Three estimators were used: mixed model based on replicates (ĥ2r ), mixed model based on genotypic means (ĥ2m ),
and the usual ANOVA-based broad-sense heritability estimator (Ĥ 2 ). An LD-adjusted kinship matrix was used in
the mixed model for ĥ2r and ĥ2m .
The LD-adjusted kinship matrix was computed using version 2.0 of the LDAK-software S PEED et al. (2012),
available at http://dougspeed.com/ldak/. We used sections of 1000 SNPs, with a buffer of 200. The
maximum distance considered for LD was 250kb; the ’halflife’ parameter (modeling LD-decay) was set to 20kb.

Table S5
In the following tables, the second and third column contain the percentage of the 5000 traits for which the corresponding heritability estimates (ĥ2r and ĥ2m ) were contained in the intervals in the first column. The remaining
columns show the correlation (r) between simulated and predicted genetic effects, averaged over these traits. 20
QTLs were simulated, which explained 50 percent of the genetic variance. Each trait was simulated for a randomly
drawn training (200 accessions) and validation set (50 accessions). Genetic effects were predicted using G-BLUP,
based on either a mixed model for the individual plants (replicates) or for the genotypic means.
