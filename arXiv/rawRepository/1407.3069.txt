Abstract
We are interested in the impact of natural selection in a prey-predator community.
We introduce an individual-based model of the community that takes into account both
prey and predator phenotypes. Our aim is to understand the phenotypic coevolution of
prey and predators. The community evolves as a multi-type birth and death process with
mutations. We first consider the infinite particle approximation of the process without
mutation. In this limit, the process can be approximated by a system of differential
equations. We prove the existence of a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium
under specific conditions on the interaction among prey individuals. When mutations
are rare, the community evolves on the mutational scale according to a Markovian jump
process. This process describes the successive equilibria of the prey-predator community
and extends the Polymorphic Evolutionary Sequence to a coevolutionary framework. We
then assume that mutations have a small impact on phenotypes and consider the evolution
of monomorphic prey and predator populations. The limit of small mutation steps leads
to a system of two differential equations which is a version of the canonical equation of
adaptive dynamics for the prey-predator coevolution. We illustrate these different limits
with an example of prey-predator community that takes into account different prey defense
mechanisms. We observe through simulations how these various prey strategies impact
the community.

Introduction

The evolution of a population establishes a link between selected individual characteristics
and the environment in which the population lives. Quantifying how the impact of the environment varies along evolutionary trajectories is an important question. Here, we aim at
considering how other species interact with the population of interest. These different species
compose an ecological community in which each population has a specific role: parasites,
predators, resources, etc... The evolution of the different species then modifies the complete
interaction network, continuously redefining the selective environment acting on the considered population. The coevolution of different species therefore allows us to consider the
feedback loop that links phenotype distributions to environmental variations [33].
In the present paper, we focus on the case of prey-predator communities evolving on similar
time scales. As far as ecological dynamics are concerned, there exists an important literature
on such predator-prey interactions. In the 1920’s, Lotka [53] and Volterra [77] independently
proposed a dynamical system for the ecological dynamics of prey and predators which was
then extensively studied (see [72],[40],[63]). More recently Marrow, Dieckmann and Law
[26],[55],[54] tackled the question of how natural selection affected the dynamics of such interactions. In the adaptive dynamics framework introduced by Metz, Geritz & al. and Dieckman
and Law [60],[25], these authors developed heuristic tools to study the phenotypic coevolution
of monomorphic prey and predator populations and its impact on the network. The survival
of prey and predators is strongly conditioned on their respective abilities to defend and hunt.
As a result, the understanding of the variety of defense traits and of behavioral and morphological adaptation of predators to these defensive mechanisms has become an important
focus for evolutionary ecology (see among others [70],[62],[45],[22]). Considering such coevolutionary dynamics brings up new questions regarding the structure of ecological networks,
their stability and the consequences of evolution on their emergent properties (e.g. [46],[24]).
For instance, it has been shown that predator-prey coevolution may yield food-web architectures that resemble the ones observed in empirical datasets ([50],[67],[16],[28]). Coevolution
of predator-prey interactions may also erode the regulating role of predation [49] and change
the overall distribution of energy within the community [51]. Further models suggest that
evolution can select ecological dynamics that are inherently less stable [46],[32],[27] or more
stable [2],[3] than initial systems. It is important to note that the importance of coevolution for ecological network dynamics is not restricted to the realm of mathematical models.
Indeed, some of the implications of defense evolution in prey for the stability of ecological
dynamics have been reproduced experimentally [80],[61]. Evolutionary dynamics have also
been experimentally reproduced in plant-herbivore systems [5]. Because the importance of
eco-evolutionary dynamics of predator-prey interactions now relies on a strong theoretical
background and complementary empirical observations or experimental works, evolution is
nowadays largely used in terms of applications. To give just an example, the implications of
plant-enemy coevolution for the management of agricultural production has been stressed by
many [23],[74],[47].
In a mathematical setting, Durett and Mayberry [29] looked into a specific prey-predator community and considered the phenotypic evolution of prey in a fixed community of predators
and vice versa under the assumptions of adaptive dynamics (large population, rare and small
2

mutations). They consider a probabilistic microscopic model of the community, following the
rigourous approch developped by Champagnat, Ferrière and Méléard ([17],[18],[19]) for the
eco-evolutionary dynamics of a population with logistic competition.
In this article, we present a stochastic individual-based model for the predator-prey community that evolves as a multi-type birth and death process. The phenotype of an individual is
transmitted to its offspring after a potential mutation. The prey phenotypes constrain their
defense abilities and influence their reproduction, mortality rate and competition ability. We
also consider the evolution of predator phenotypes and model its impact on the predation intensity. We give an example of prey and predator phenotypes in Section 2.2 and we illustrate
our results with exact simulations of the individual-based process.
We study the stochastic prey-predator community process in different scalings corresponding
to the assumptions of adaptive dynamics: large population, rare mutations and mutations
of small impact. Since we assume that mutations are rare, it is important to understand
the behavior of the community between two mutations. Therefore we study the evolution
of a prey-predator community composed of d prey sub-populations and m predator subpopulations (Section 2). The main question is the composition of this community in a long
time scale corresponding to the scale where mutations occur. In the large population limit,
the dynamics of the prey-predator community is well approximated by a system of differential
equations. In Section 3, we study the long time behavior of this deterministic system. In particular, we introduce conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a globally asymptotically
stable equilibrium. These conditions rely on specific matrices for the interaction between the
species. We improve here a result of Goh, Takeuchi and Adachi (see [37],[72]) in our specific
setting. The existence of globally stable equilibria is related to optimization problems called
Linear complementarity problems. We consider a class of these problems related to the augmented problems (see Cottle et al.[21]) and extend existing results to our framework.
Then we prove in Section 4 that the individual-based stochastic process also converges to
this equilibrium in finite time and remains close to this equilibrium on a long time scale. In
particular we give a result on the exit time of an attractive domain which remains true even
for a perturbed process. Our result is obtained using the properties of the Lyapunov function
associated with the deterministic system as in the work of Champagnat, Jabin et Méléard
[20]. The interest is to highlight the time scale separation between competition phases and
mutation occurences. Between two mutations, we can thus characterize the resident preypredator community.
In Section 5, we study the impact of rare mutations on the community. The rare mutation
framework was first formalized by Champagnat [17] for the phenotypic evolution of a population with logistic competition. At each reproduction event, the phenotype of the newborn can
be altered by a mutation. We consider the successive invasions of mutants and characterize
the survival probability of a mutant trait in a given community. In the mutation scale, we
prove that the process jumps from a deterministic equilibrium to another one according to
the successive mutant invasions. This jump process extends the Polymorphic Evolutionary
Sequence to a co-evolutionary framework.
Finally, we consider the case where mutations have a small impact on phenotypes. Combining these three assumptions (large population, rare mutations and small mutation jumps),

3

we derive a couple of canonical equations describing the coevolution of the prey and predator
traits [19],[55],[54].

2.1

The model
The microscopic model

We consider an asexual prey-predator community in which each individual is characterized
by its phenotypic traits. At each reproduction event the trait of the parent is transmitted to
its offspring.
The interest of this work is the coevolution of prey and predator traits that affects the
predation. The phenotype x ∈ X of a prey individual describes its ability to defend itself
against predation. We assume that this trait has an effect on the predation intensity that the
prey individual undergoes, but also on its reproduction rate, intrinsic death rate, and ability
to compete with other prey individuals. Such costs may emerge because the energy allocated
to defense is diverted from other functions such as growth, maintenance or reproduction (e.g.
[39],[5],[45]). The phenotype y ∈ Y of a predator characterizes its prey consumption rate. This
trait affects the predation exerted on prey but also the death rate of the predator. Again,
such costs may be explained by differential allocation among life-history traits, but also by
behavioral constraints. For instance, increased consumption rate requiring a larger time investment in resource acquisition, it may decrease the vigilance of the predator against its own
enemies, creating a mortality cost (see [41],[76]). The trait spaces X and Y are assumed to
be compact subsets of Rp and RP respectively.
The community is composed of d prey types x1 , . . . , xd and m predator types y1 , . . . , ym . The
state of the community is described by the vector of the sub-population sizes. We introduce
a parameter K scaling these sub-population sizes (as in [34],[18]). To ease the distinction
between prey and predator populations we denote by NiK the number of prey individuals
with trait xi , for 1 ≤ i ≤ d, and by HlK the number of predators with trait yl , for 1 ≤ l ≤ m.
Finally the community is represented by the vector
ZK =

of the rescaled numbers of individuals holding the different traits.
The dynamics of the community follows a continuous time multi-type birth and death process.
We first describe the behavior of the prey population. Each prey individual with trait x gives
birth to an offspring at rate b(x). The newborn holds the same trait as its parent. The death
rate of a prey individual holding trait x is given by

where d(x) is the intrinsic death rate of a prey individual with trait x, c(x, x0 ) the competition
exerted by a prey individual with trait x0 on the prey individual with trait x and B(x, y) the

intensity of the predation exerted by a predator holding trait y on the prey individual with
trait x. In the absence of predators, the prey population evolves as a birth and death process
with logistic competition whose behavior was extensively studied by Champagnat, Ferrière
and Méléard [17],[18],[19].
For the predator population, each predator holding trait y gives birth to a new predator at

proportional to the predation pressure it exerts on the prey population. The parameter r can
be seen as the conversion efficiency of prey biomass into predator biomass. We assume in the
following that r < 1. In the absence of prey, the predators are unable to reproduce and their
population will become extinct rapidly. Each predator holding trait y dies at rate D(y). The
competition between different predators is taken into account through the prey consumption.
The interaction between prey and predators affects the prey death rate and the predator birth
rate. This interaction benefits predators but penalizes prey. It creates an asymmetry in the
community process and makes it difficult to study: comparisons between two processes whose
rates are close, are not possible on a long time scale. We will see in the following how to
circumvent this difficulty.

2.2

An example introducing two types of defenses

The diversity of defense strategies observed in nature is overwhelming and the maintenance
of such a diversity of strategies is an important focus of evolutionary ecology [30]. Just focusing on one type of consumption interaction, namely plant-herbivore interactions, strategies
of defense are morphological (e.g., through spines or trichomes/hair [81]), chemical (e.g., the
productions of phenols and tannins [11]) or through the attraction of enemies of herbivores
(”crying for help” [43]). Even when focusing on one defense mechanism, e.g. chemical, the
diversity of compounds that are used for defense is very high, not only in total, but even
within species [64]. Modelling such a diversity is challenging and a broad categorization is
necessary. Here, based on previous empirical or experimental works (see [70],[62]), we propose
to consider two major classes of defenses, based on their action mode and on the costs they
incur: quantitative defenses and qualitative defenses.
Quantitative defenses correspond to phenotypes that are efficient against a vast number of
enemies, but that incur a direct cost in terms of growth or reproduction [62]. Typical examples include structural defenses such as increased toughness [65], production of morphological
defenses (trichomes, spines) (e.g. [6],[56]) or production of digestibility reducing compounds
[10]. In the present work, we assume that the cost of quantitative defenses affects reproduction (cf. [62],[70],[45]).
Conversely, qualitative defenses correspond to phenotypes that alleviate consumption by some
of the enemies, but incur a cost through another ecological interaction (eg, increased consumption by other enemies or reduced benefits from mutualists [62] ; “ecological costs” sensu [70]).
For instance, alkaloid defenses in plants are efficient against generalist herbivores, but may
attract specialists that have evolved to tolerate them or even to use them against their own
predators [62]. Other chemical defenses (eg, nicotine) affect the quality of nectar, reducing
5

pollination opportunities [4]. Floral traits such as color or corolla size may reduce the attraction of herbivores, but at the expense of pollinator visitation [69]. In the present work,
qualitative defenses allow a reduction in the effect of one predator, but increase the vulnerability to another predator. Because such defense strategies largely impact the similarity of
prey niches regarding their enemies [66], we here make the hypothesis that individuals that
are closer in terms of qualitative defenses x have a stronger interference competition. Such
an hypothesis is justified by experimental observations [5], and coherent with the fact that
closely related or trait-similar species usually compete more strongly (see [1],[15]).
We take these two types of defenses into account by associating each prey with a twodimensional trait x = (qn , qa ) where qn ∈ R+ is the quantity of quantitative defense produced
by the prey and qa ∈ R represents its qualitative defense. The allocative trade-off induced by
the quantitative defense qn is represented by an exponential decrease of both the prey birth
rate and the predation intensity, at speed αn and βn respectively. In simulations, we chose a
weak allocative trade-off with αn = 1/10 and βn = 2: prey can increase their production of
defenses without being too penalized.
The predator ability to consume the different qualitative defenses of prey individuals is characterized by two parameters: their preferred qualitative defense ρ, and their degree of generalism
σ. Specialists predators have a small range σ and exert an important predation pressure on the
prey populations holding traits close to their preference, while generalist predators (σ large)
consume a large range of qualitative defenses but with less efficiency. Each predator is then
represented by the couple y = (ρ, σ) ∈ R×]0, +∞[. The predation intensity decreases with
the difference |ρ − qa | between the preference of predators and the prey qualitative defense.
Note that higher generalism incurs a cost in terms of interaction efficiency, as the maximal
predation rate is of order 1/σ.
In the simulations, we used the following rate functions: for (qn , qa ) ∈ [0, +∞[×R and
(ρ, σ) ∈ R×]0, +∞[:
b(qn , qa ) = b0 exp(−αn qn ), d(qa , qn ) = d0 ,

We illustrate this example with exact simulations of the birth and death process introduced
above. We are interested in the impact of predators on a prey population using two different
qualitative defenses and no quantitative defense: the different prey traits are x1 = (0, 0.8)
and x2 = (0, 1.7). We represent on Figure 1, the evolution through time of the respective
sizes of the prey sub-populations with trait x1 (in green ×), x2 (in red +) and of the predator
population holding a trait (ρ, 0.6) for different choices of ρ (in blue ∗).
When the predator preference differs too much from the prey defense, their population dies
out and the two prey populations coexist. In the sequel, we are interested in the cases where
the predator population survives. We observe three different behaviors. In Figure 1(a), the
preference of predators is ρ = 0.2. The three populations coexist on a long time scale. The
6

prey population holding trait x2 has more individuals than the prey population with trait
x1 since predation is less important on x2 . In Figure 1(b), the preference of predators is
ρ = 0.7: predators are well adapted to the trait x1 . The predation intensity is so strong on
prey holding trait x1 that their population die out. However both populations of predators
and prey with trait x2 survive. In Figure 1(c), the preference of predators is ρ = 1.26: they
consume both prey populations similarly. We observe that the three populations coexist and
that both prey sub-populations have similar small size.
As the parameter ρ increases further, we first observe the extinction of the prey population
holding trait x2 . This is the symmetrical case to (b). Then, we observe similarly to case (a)
that the three populations coexist.

Existence of the process and uniform bounds of the community size

The prey-predator community process ZK = K1 (N1K , · · · , NdK , H1K , · · · , HdK ) introduced above
is a Markov process on (N/K)d+m . Its transition rates (or jump rates) are given by the birth
and death rates of individuals.
A trajectory of the prey-predator community process can be constructed as solution of a
stochastic differential equation driven by Poisson point measures (see [34],[18]). This construction is given in Appendix A.
The community process is well defined up to the explosion of the number of individuals. We

of predators. The prey population size N K jumps of +1 each time a prey individual is born
and of −1 each time a prey individual dies; the predator population size evolves similarly.
In the sequel we make the following assumptions:
Assumption A. The rate functions b, d, c, B and D are continuous, positive and bounded
¯ c̄, B̄ and D̄. Moreover the functions c, B and D are bounded below by
respectively by b̄, d,

Limit in large population

In this section we study the behavior of the community in a large population limit (K → ∞).
We use the same scaling for both populations and establish that the stochastic process ZK
can be approximated by the solution of a deterministic system of differential equations.
For x = (x1 , . . . , xd ) ∈ X d and y = (y1 , . . . , ym ) ∈ Y m we denote by LV P (x, y) the differential

A solution of this system is a vector z = (n1 , . . . , nd , h1 , . . . , hm ).
Proposition 2.2. Under Assumptions A and B and assuming that the sequence of initial
conditions (ZK (0))K converges in probability toward a deterministic vector z(0) ∈ [0, ∞)d+m ,
then for every T > 0 the sequence of processes (ZK (t), t ∈ [0, T ])K converges in law in the
Skorohod space D([0, T ], (R+ )d+m ) toward the unique function (z(t), t ∈ [0, T ]) solution of the
system LV P (x, y) with initial condition z0 and satisfying sup ||z(t)|| < ∞.
t∈[0,T ]

The proof follows a classical compactness-uniqueness method developed by Fournier and
Méléard (2004) (Theorem 5.3). First we prove using Proposition 2.1(i) that the sequence
(ZK (t), t ∈ [0, T ])K is tight. Then we identify the limit as the unique solution of the system
of differential equations LV P (x, y).
Remark 2.3. The extinction of the predator population is not possible in finite time for the
solutions of the differential system LV P (x, y). Indeed, if there exists 1 ≤ l ≤ m such that
hl (0) > 0, then for every t ≥ 0,

hl (t) ≥ −D(yl )hl (t).

Thus hl (t) ≥ hl (0) exp(−D(yl )t) > 0.
Conversely, if there is no predator at time t = 0, i.e. z(0) = (n(0), 0), then the stochastic
process ZK converges toward the solution of a competitive Lotka-Volterra system (denoted by

Long time behavior of the solutions of the deterministic system LV P

In this section we study the long time behavior of the solutions to the LV P (x, y) system for
fixed x = (x1 , . . . , xd ) ∈ X d and y = (y1 , . . . , ym ) ∈ Y m . To simplify notation, we forget the
dependence on traits for the parameters and only use subscripts: for example Bil = B(xi , yl ).
We are interested in the equilibria of the dynamical system (3). Hofbauer et Sigmund proved
(Section 5.4, p.47 [40]) that the LV P (x, y) systems satisfy the competitive exclusion principle. This ecological principle states that m different species cannot survive on fewer than m
different resources (or in less than m different niches) (see [7]). An important consequence is
that every asymptotically stable equilibrium z∗ of the LV P (x, y) system contains no fewer
prey sub-populations than of predators:
#{1 ≤ i ≤ d, n∗i > 0} ≥ #{1 ≤ l ≤ m, h∗l > 0}.
Therefore the diversity among predators is limited by the diversity among prey.
In Subsection 3.1, we introduce conditions for an equilibrium to be globally asymptotically
stable, (i.e. every solution of the system with positive initial condition converges when t goes to
∞ toward this equilibrium). This strong notion of stability entails that such an equilibrium
is unique. Numerous authors, notably Goh ([37]), Takeuchi et Adachi ([72]) have already
studied this question. We develop here a different approach by improving the Lyapunov
function introduced by these authors. The interest of this approach is to obtain quantitative
information on the behavior of the stochastic process close to the deterministic equilibrium (see
Section 4). Then in Subsection 3.2, we study the existence of globally asymptotically stable
equilibria. This question is related to the existence of solutions to Linear Complementarity
Problems. Combining these two results, we derive conditions that ensure the existence of a
unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium for the LV P systems.

3.1

Condition for global asymptotic stability

We assume the existence of a non-negative equilibrium z∗ = (n∗1 , . . . n∗d , h∗1 , . . . , h∗m ) of the
LV P (x, y) system defined in (3). We seek conditions on this equilibrium to be globally
asymptotically stable. The global stability relies on the properties of the interaction matrix
of the system LV P :

where C = (cij )1≤i,j≤d and B = (Bil )1≤i≤d,1≤l≤m . We introduce two assumptions on the
differential system:
Assumption C.
C.1. For every d ∈ N and almost every (x1 , .., xd ) ∈ X d , the matrix of the competition among
prey C(x) = (c(xi , xj ))1≤i,j≤d satisfies that C(x) + C(x)T is positive definite.
C.2. Let d, m ∈ N, x = (x1 , ...xd ) ∈ X d , and y = (y1 , ..., ym ) ∈ Y m . Every subsystem of the
system LV P (x, y) is non degenerate.
Assumption C.1 allows us to define a Lyapunov function for the system LV P . As an example,
Assumption C.1 is satisfied for matrices C = (cij ) symmetric and strictly diagonally dominant
P
( |cii | > j6=i |cij |). Remark that the competition matrix is symmetric when the competition
among preys only depends on the distance between their phenotypes. This is often the case
when individuals pay a cost in phenotype matching [79],[15]. Strictly diagonally dominant
matrices arise when the competition within the sub-populations is more important than the
competition with the other sub-populations. This assumption reflects the impact of the similarity of niches of individuals with close phenotypes [66],[15].
Assumption C.2 allows to characterize the different equilibria of the LV P (x, y) system with
their null and positive components. This assumption reflects that every sub-population plays
a different role in the prey-predator community (and in any sub-commnity).
We associate with the equilibrium z∗ two subsets containing the subscripts of the traits
that disappear in the equilibrium for the prey and predator populations respectively:
P = {1 ≤ i ≤ d, n∗i = 0} and Q = {1 ≤ l ≤ m, h∗l = 0}.

(6)

The following proposition states conditions for the global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium.
Proposition 3.1. Let us assume Assumption C and the existence of an equilibrium z∗ of the
system LV P (x, y) such that

then this equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Moreover such an equilibrium is unique.

Existence of globally asymptotically stable equilibria for the system
LV P

The existence of equilibria of the system LV P (x, y) satisfying (7) is related to the existence of
solutions to specific optimization problems called Linear Complementarity Problems (LCP)
(see [71]).
Definition 3.2 (Cottle et al. [21]). Given M ∈ Ru×u and q ∈ Ru , the Linear Complementarity Problem associated with (M, q) (denoted by LCP (M, q)) seeks a vector z ∈ Ru satisfying
∀1 ≤ j ≤ u,

zj ≥ 0

and
T

(M z + q)j ≥ 0,

(M z + q) · z = 0.
12

(13)

Note that the last condition can be written (M z + q)j zj = 0, ∀1 ≤ j ≤ u.
Let us remark that every equilibrium z∗ ∈ (R+ )d+m of the system LV P (x, y) satisfying (7)
is a solution of LCP (I, R) where u = d + m, I is the interaction matrix introduced in (5)
and R = (−(b1 − d1 ), . . . , −(bd − dd ), D1 , . . . , Dm ))T is the vector of the growth rates of the
sub-populations. Actually, an equilibrium of the system LV P (x, y) satisfying (7) is also a

We therefore consider a specific range of LCP related to the shape of the interaction matrix

These conditions are similar to conditions (7) for the global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium, but contain large inequalities. Therefore to obtain the existence of globally asymptotically stable equilibria of the LV P systems we introduce an additional assumption that
prevents the quantities involved in conditions (7) and (16) from vanishing. These quantities
correspond to the growth rates of prey individuals holding trait xi and of predators holding
trait yl in a community described by the vector z∗ . In ecology these quantities are referred
to as invasion fitness. We denote the invasion fitness of a prey individual holding trait x in a
community z∗ by

Assumption D. For every (x, y) ∈ X d × Y m , and every vector (n, h) solution of LCP (I, R),
the sets {x0 ∈ X , s(x0 ; (n, h)) = 0} and {y 0 ∈ Y, F (y 0 ; (n, h)) = 0} have null Lebesgue measure.
In the following we prove that conditions for survival of a small population can be expressed
thanks to the fitness functions s and F (we will be interested in the survival of a mutant
population). More precisely if a population has a non positive fitness, then it becomes extinct
quickly. Otherwise, the population has a chance to invade the resident community. Therefore
these fitness functions measure the selective advantage of a trait value in a given community.
Assumption D is equivalent to assume that every possible trait has either an advantage or a
disadvantage in every stable equilibria of the LV P system.
Combining Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.3 we establish that
Theorem 3.4. Under Assumptions C and D, for almost every (x, y) ∈ X d × Y m there exists
a unique globally asymptotically stable LV P (x, y). Moreover this equilibrium satisfies (7).
In the sequel we denote by z∗ (x, y) = (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y)) the unique globally asymptotically
stable equilibrium of the LV P (x, y) system. Under the same assumptions we can also establish the existence of a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of the LV C system
introduced in (4). We denote by n̄(x) this equilibrium.

Consequence for the long time behavior of the stochastic
process

Let us fix x ∈ X d and y ∈ Y m and denote by z∗ = z∗ (x, y) the unique globally asymptotically
stable equilibrium of the system LV P (x, y). In this section we study the long time behavior
of the prey-predator community process ZK defined in (1). In Proposition 2.2, we compare
the stochastic process with its deterministic approximation on a finite time interval [0, T ],
however, on longer time scales the stochastic process may exit the neighbourhood of this
approximation. We first prove that ZK enters in finite time in a neighbourhood of z∗ . Then,
using a probabilistic argument of large deviation, we prove that the trajectory remains in
a neighbourhood of z∗ during a time of order exp(KV ) for V > 0. Finally we study the
extinction time of small populations which are not adapted in the community.
For every ε > 0, we denote by Bε the Rd+m sphere of radius ε centred in z∗ .
Proposition 4.1. Let us assume Assumptions A and B and that the sequence of initial
conditions ZK (0) converges in probability toward a deterministic vector z(0), then for every
ε > 0, there exists tε > 0 such that
lim P(ZK
tε ∈ Bε ) = 1.

K→∞

Proof. To prove this result we use classical techniques developed in [31] (Chapter 11, Theorem
2.1) to obtain the convergence in probability uniformly on a time interval of the process ZK :
∀T > 0, ∀ε > 0


lim P sup ||ZK (t) − z(t)|| > ε = 1,
K→∞

t∈[0,T ]

14

where z(t) is the solution of LV P (x, y). The difficulty relies in the fact that the birth and
death rates are only locally Lipschitz functions of the state of the process. However, as the
limit function z(t) takes values in a compact set of Rd+m , we overcome this difficulty by regularizing the birth and death rates outside a sufficient large compact set.
Moreover there exists a compact set C containing the sequence of initial conditions (ZK (0))K≥0
with probability converging to 1. We set for every initial condition z0 ∈ C the last time tε (z0 )
where the deterministic solution z(t) enters Bε . This time is finite according to Theorem 3.4.
Since the solutions of the LV P (x, y) system are continuous with respect to their initial condition, the time tε = supz0 ∈C tε (z0 ) is finite and satisfies that ∀t > tε , sup{z0 ∈C} ||z(t) − z ∗ || < ε.
Combining these two results, we conclude the proof of Proposition 4.1.
We then study the time spent by ZK in the neighbourhood of z∗ . The estimate of the exit
time of an attractive neighbourhood gives a good scaling for the introduction of rare mutations
in the next section. This result relies usually on the large deviation theory. However, classical
techniques cannot be applied in our setting since the birth and death rates of ZK are not
bounded uniformly away from zero. We introduce here a different method which allows to
extend the result to perturbations of the process ZK . In particular, we aim at considering small
mutant populations that interact with the process ZK or at modifying the birth and death
rates introduced in Section 2. Another interest in considering perturbations of the process is
the study of the stability or resilience of this prey-predator network (see the seminal work of
May [57] or [73],[42] for more recent references).

The results is obtained using the method developed by Champagnat, Jabin et Méléard (Proposition 4.2 [20]). We detail the proof in Appendix D and give hereby the main ideas in the non

We introduce the stopping time τεK = inf{t ≥ 0, ZK ∈

which represents the maximal time that the process ||ZK −z∗ ||2 can spend above the threshold
2C 000 κ before the time T ∧ τεK . The inequality (21) becomes for all t ≤ Sκ ∧ T ∧ τεK
||ZK (t) − z∗ ||2 ≤ CC 00 C 000 κTκ .
This equation connects the time spent by the process outside a ball, with the values taken by
||ZK − z∗ ||2 during this time interval. Therefore if we bound the values of Tκ , we control the
process ||ZK − z∗ ||2 and consequently the exit time τεK . To estimate Tκ we need to control
exponentially the values of the martingale MtK uniformly on a time interval. To this aim, we
use the following lemma.
Lemma 4.3 (Graham, Méléard - Proposition 4.1 [38]). For every α > 0 and T > 0 there
exists a constant Vα,T satisfying that for all K large enough:
P

With this result and (21) we study for ε00 < ε0 < ε, the number of back and forth, kε between
the balls Bε00 and Bε0 before the exit of Bε . With an appropriate choice of the parameters
ε0 and T , we establish that kε is smaller than a geometric random variable with parameter

exp(−KV ), thus
P(kε > exp(KV /2)) = 1 − (1 − exp(−KV ))exp(KV /2) −→ 1
K→∞

To conclude it remains to show, using (21) again, that these back and forth require a time of
order 1.
Finally we study the behavior of the process while it remains close to the equilibrium z∗ .
The equilibrium z∗ can have zero components and we establish that the associated stochastic
sub-populations become extinct in a time of order log K. We introduce the stopping time

Proof. Fix l ∈ Q. We prove the result for the predator population holding trait yl , and the
same reasoning can be applied to a prey population holding trait xi , for i ∈ P (see Theorem
4 in [17]).
Theorem 3.4 ensures that the fitness F (yl ; z∗ ) is negative. We define the constant Vε associated
by Theorem 4.2 to the exit time τεK of the ball Bε . For every t ≤ τεK , the number of predators
HlK (t) is bounded from below by a continuous time birth and death process H with birth rate

Evolution of the process in a rare mutation time scale

In this section, mutations happen during the prey and predator reproduction events. We
observe their impact on the dynamics of the community. The coevolution of the traits depends
on the occurrence of mutations and the invasion of the mutant population. We seek conditions
for the survival of a mutant population and study the consequences of the fixation of a
mutation for the prey-predator community.
The individual birth and death rates are defined as in Section 2. The mutation events are
added as follows
• when a prey individual with trait x gives birth, the trait of its offspring is affected by a
mutation with probability uK p(x). The newborn holds a trait x+l where l is distributed
according to π(x, l)dl. Otherwise (with probability 1 − uK p(x)) the newborn inherits
its parent trait x.
• Similarly for each predator holding a trait y. At each reproduction event, with probability uK P (y) the trait of the offspring is affected by a mutation: it holds the trait y + l
where l is distributed according to Π(y, l)dl. Otherwise the newborn inherits its parent
trait y.
The same parameter uK scales the mutation frequencies in both prey and predator populations. This assumption is consistent with the fact that the demographic dynamics of both
populations happens on the same time scale (Section 4). When the parameter uK is small,
the mutations are rare. We assume in the sequel that KuK → 0 as K → ∞. This assumption
measures the rarity of the mutations and is consistent with the theory of adaptive dynamics
([60],[25]).
In subsection 5.1 we illustrate the impact of mutations on the example introduced in section
2.2. In subsection 5.2 we consider the limit of the community process under the assumptions
of infinite population and rare mutations. We extend the results obtained by Champagnat
[17] to the prey-predator coevolution. Finally in subsection 5.3 we consider a limit when
the mutation steps are small. We prove that the coevolution of the prey and predator traits
can be described by the deterministic coupled system of differential equations introduced by
Dieckmann, Law and Marrow [54]. This system extends the canonical equation of adaptive
dynamics to the coevolution of a prey-predator interaction.

5.1

Simulations

Let us consider again the example introduced in section 2.2 in which prey individuals are
characterized by a trait x = (qn , qa ) where qn is the quantity of quantitative defenses they
produce and qa the type of qualitative defense they use. The predators are characterized
by y = (ρ, σ) where ρ reflects the qualitative value they prefer and σ is their range. The
mutations are distributed according to gaussian distributions, centred in the trait of the
parent with covariance matrices γ and Γ for prey and predators respectively.
We illustrate in different cases the impact of mutations on the community. We will observe
the convergence on the rare mutation scale toward a pure jump process taking values in the
set of couples of finite measures on the trait spaces X and Y respectively.
18

5.1.1

Co-evolution of the qualitative defense qA and the predator preference ρ

We first consider the coevolution of the prey trait qa and of the predator trait ρ. Both
traits are associated through the predation function B, and the defense trait qa influences the
competition among prey. In these simulations we assume that mutations do not affect the prey
trait qn and the predator trait σ. We consider three cases: first we assume that no mutation
occurs in the predator population (Figure 2), then the opposite case where mutations only
occur in the predator population (Figure 3), finally we study the coevolution of the traits
(Figure 4).
In the first case we assume that no mutation occurs in the predator population: P = 0.
The initial community is composed of K prey individuals holding trait x = (0.3, 0.4) and
K predators holding trait y = (0.2, 0.6). The mutation probability uK = 5 · 10−5 is small.
Figure 2(a) gives the different values of qa carried by prey and of ρ carried by predators for
all times. We observe that natural selection favours the values of qa far from ρ. The predator
population dies out when the defense qa gets to far away from their preference. The extinction
time is represented by a vertical line on the three graphs. As long as predators are present in
the community, we observe that the prey traits are concentrated in a single value: the prey
population remains monomorphic.
In the other graphs, we focus on the demographic dynamics. Figure 2(b) gives the dynamics
of the number of predators through time. On Figure 2(c) we represent the size of the prey
sub-populations with the following traits: the initial trait value (0.3, 0.4) in green, (0.3, 0.664)
in blue, and (0.3, 1.285) in pink (the same colors are used on Figure 2(a)). On these graphs
we observe the impact of the mutations on the community. The mutation (0.3, 0.664) is the
first to invade the initial community and to replace the resident prey holding trait (0.3, 0.4).
e observe that before the appearance of this mutation the respective numbers of predators
and prey (0.3, 0.4) remain stationary. Some mutations have appeared but their population
remained small (less than 10 individuals). This phenomenon illustrates the stationarity of
the prey and predator population sizes near the deterministic equilibria of the LV P system
stated in Theorem 4.2.
The invasion of the mutation (0.3, 0.664) is characterized by a fast extinction of the resident
prey population and a fast growth of the mutant population. Meanwhile, the number of
predators diminishes to another stationary value. The extinction speed of the resident population is given by Proposition 4.4.
The invasion of a mutant prey holding trait (0.3, 1.285) in the resident community composed
of prey holding trait (0.3, 0.664) and predators, drives the predators to extinction. The extinction of predators is a direct consequence of the prey phenotypic evolution: it is called an
evolutionary murder (see [24]). Afterwards both prey populations survive. Note that their
respective population sizes are similar: they have indeed the same natural birth and death
rates and similar ability for competition. In this simulation, the prey population remains
dimorphic after the predator extinction and both traits are driven apart by the competition.
This simulation is characteristic of the behavior of the process when the population is large
and mutations are rare. As introduced by Champagnat [17] there exist two phases: a long
phase where the sizes of the sub-populations remain stable, close to the equilibrium values of
the deterministic system; a short phase corresponding to the invasion of a mutant trait in the

through time. Figure (b) gives the dynamics of the number of predators on the time interval

(0.3, 0.4) in green, (0.3, 0.664) in blue and (0.3, 1.285) in pink (the same colors are associated
on Figure (a)). The vertical line corresponds to the extinction time of predators. The other

resident population. The successive mutant invasions induce jumps in the traits present in
the community as well as in respective sizes of each sub-population. We describe this jump
process in Section 5.2
We then consider the opposite case where mutations only affect the predator preference ρ and
not the prey population (see Figure 3). As before, Figure 3(a) represents the traits qa and
ρ in the population. Figure 3(b) corresponds to the rescaled number of predators holding
the traits (0.2, 0.6) in black, (0.339, 0.6) in green, (0.531, 0.6) in pink and (0.597, 0.6) in blue
(represented with the same colors on Figure (a)). The rescaled size of the prey population is
drawn on Figure 3(c). The initial population is composed of K prey individuals with trait
(0.3, 0.6) and K predators with trait (0.2, 0.6). We recall that the predator preference corresponds to the value of the qualitative defense that they can avoid or the prey type that
they are specifically able to consume (see [62, 22]). Predators whose preference ρ is closer
to the prey qualitative defense qa = 0.6 have an advantage in terms of relative fitness. We
observe that the predator population remains monomorphic and that the trait jumps closer to
qa accordingly to the successive invasions of mutants. At each invasion, the sizes of the prey
and predator populations jump to the stable equilibrium of the associated LV P system. The
last invasion phase is very slow (see Figure 3(b)). It is due to a very slow convergence toward
the equilibrium, of the solutions to the LV P system associated with the traits x = (0.3, 0.6),
y1 = (0.531, 0.6) and y2 = (0.597, 0.6). We observe in a general manner that the invasion
times of successive mutations increase as ρ comes closer to qa . This reflects the flatenning
of the fitness landscape for predators: through time, advantageous mutations become less
beneficial with respect to the resident population.
To observe coevolution, we introduce mutations in both the prey and the predator populations. The prey evolution is constrained by two forces: the intra-specific competition that
favours diversification and the predation pressure that drives prey phenotypes away from the

predator preferences. We investigate the effect of these two forces on the community when
the relative mutation speeds p and P vary. On Figure 4, we represent the traits qa (+) and
ρ (×) present in the community through time. On Figure 4(a) p = P , we observe that the
predator trait jumps close to the value of the defense of the prey population. Afterwards, the
prey population becomes polymorphic. This diversity is due to the competition interaction.
Finally, as predators do not adapt their preference fast enough, their population dies out.
In this case, the competitive force has more impact than the predation pressure and induces
a diversification of the prey phenotypes (see [52]). On Figure 4(b), we raise the mutation
probability of predators: P = 5p and choose smaller mutations steps. We observe two phases:
in the first one (for t ∈ [0 : 4000]) the distance between the prey qualitative defense and preference of predators decreases. After this time, both traits seem to evolve simultaneously. This
phenomenon recalls the Red Queen or Arm races observed by biologists (see [55, 2, 24, 11]),
which corresponds to a parallel variation of the traits of partner species in time.
5.1.2

Evolution of the quantitative defense

We now model the variations in the quantity qn of quantitative defense. Unlike the qualitative defenses considered above, quantitative defenses impact the prey birth rate and not their
competitive ability. In these simulations the mutations do not affect the prey trait qa and the
mutation probability of predators is null again. The initial community is composed of K prey
individuals holding trait (0, 0.6) and of K predators holding trait (0.2, 0.6). Figure 5(a) represents the traits qn borne by prey through time. Figure 5(b) gives the dynamics of the rescaled
sizes of the prey sub-populations associated with the initial trait (0, 0.6) in red, (0.189, 0.6) in
green, (0.311, 0.6) in blue, (0.703, 0.6) in pink and (0.260, 0.6) in light blue. These traits are
represented using the same colors on Figure 5(a). The remaining traits, in black on Figure
5(a), correspond to mutations which did not invade the community. The dynamics of the
rescaled number of predators is given on Figure 5(c). The vertical line corresponds to the
predator extinction.
Note that the quantity of defense produced by prey increases in the presence of predators

D = 0.5, r = 0.8, αn = 0.1, βn = 2.
and that the number of predators decreases when prey increase their defenses. When prey
holding trait (0.311, 0.6) and (0.703, 0.6) coexist, the number of predators decreases quickly.
We observe long time oscillations that correspond to the behavior of the dynamical systems
associated to these three populations. As the competition is constant in the prey population,
these simulations do not enter the mathematical framework we described (Assumption C.1).
These oscillations illustrate that evolution can induce instability in the interaction networks
(e.g. [46]). After the extinction of predators, prey producing many defenses are penalized
because their reproduction is weaker. The direction of natural selection changes with the
extinction of the predators. We observe here what is called apparent competition: the coexistence of two prey traits with predators relies on the fact that the predation pressure is
stronger on the most competitive prey population (see [7]).
This change in the direction of evolution illustrates a new difficulty induced by coevolution:
the same mutation will not have the same impact on the community depending on the presence or the absence of predators. It is thus necessary to consider the coevolution of both
populations.

5.2

Limit in the rare mutation time scale and jump process

We consider the limit of the community process in a large population scaling with rare mutations. The number of traits present in the community varies when mutations appear in the
community. We represent the community by a couple of empirical measures (ν K (t), η K (t)):

Figure 5: Figure (a) gives the values of qn borne by prey through time. On Figure (b)

green, (0.311, 0.6) in blue, (0.703, 0.6) in pink and (0.260, 0.6) in light blue. The dynamics
of the rescaled number of predators is given on Figure (c). Other parameters are given by
K = 1000, uK = 10−4 , p = 1, P = 0, π(qn , l) ∼ N (qn , 0.1) b0 = 2, d0 = 0, c0 = 1.5, D = 0.5,
r = 0.8, αn = 0.1, βn = 2.
such that KuK → 0. This assumption is consistent with the adaptive dynamics framework
in which mutations occur when the resident population is at equilibrium ([60],[25]). Further
assumptions will be given in Theorem 5.3 on the exact scaling of the mutation frequency.
The fact that the mutation frequency decreases with the population size is not unexpected,
considering population genetics arguments. Indeed, the genetic variation among a population increases with respect to the number of individuals. However, assuming that mutant
effects are distributed around 0 with a given variance, large numbers of mutations in large
populations eventually produce very similar mutants. Due to this redundancy, the amount of
variation produced by the mutation process saturates in large populations (see [35],[68],[44]).
This saturation can be interpreted as a decrease of the outcome of new mutants.
The next proposition states that mutations cannot occur in a bounded time interval.
Lemma 5.1. Let us assume Assumptions A, B and that the mutation densities satisfy:

The proof of this Lemma can be easily adapted from the proof of Corollary 2.2 in [20]. It is
based on a coupling of the community process before the first mutation time with a multitype birth and death process whose birth and death rates depend on uK . This process is
independent of the mutation events occurring in (ν K , η K ). As these mutations occur at a
rate proportional to KuK , the probability to observe a mutation in a time interval of length
ε/KuK is negligible.
23

We state the main result of this section. It describes the convergence of the community process
in the mutational scale toward a pure jump process. This process extends the Polymorphic
Evolutionary Sequence introduced by Champagnat and Méléard [19] to a prey-predator network.
As we have seen in the simulations, the limiting process takes values in the set of the stable
equilibria (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y)) of the deterministic system LV P (x, y) (introduced in (3) for
x ∈ X d and y ∈ Y m ) as long as predators survive. Remark that after the extinction of
predators, the behavior of the prey population is well known (see [17, 19]) and the limiting
process takes values in the set of equilibria n̄(x) of the LV C(x) system defined in (4).
The process describing the successive states of the community is a Markovian jump process

The dynamics of Λ depends on the arrivals of mutations in the prey and the predator populations. A successful mutant invasion modifies both the prey and the predator populations (see

This corresponds to the invasion of a mutant prey population with trait xj + u in the
community.

This corresponds to the invasion of a predator population holding the mutant trait

We recall that the fitness functions s and F are defined in (17) and (18) respectively.
Remark 5.2. As in Figures 2 and 5, the community jump process Λ can reach a state where
the predator population dies out. Since the invasion of mutant predators requires the positivity
of their invasion fitness (see Theorem 3.4), the predator extinction can only result from the
invasion of a mutant prey which diminishes the growth rate of the resident predator. The
behavior of the community after the predator extinction is described by the PES introduced in

This convergence takes place in the sense of convergence of the finite dimensional distributions
for the topology on MF (X × Y) induced by the total variation norm.
Assumption (24), introduced by Champagnat [17], reflects the separation between the
demographic and the mutational time scales (see Figure 2(b), 2(c), 3(b) and 3(c)). The
demographic time scale is of order log K. It corresponds to the evolution of the stochastic
process close to its deterministic approximation. The process ZK enters a neighbourhood of
the attractive deterministic equilibrium and the deleterious traits die out (Proposition 4.1 and
Proposition 4.4). The mean time between two mutations is of order 1/KuK , therefore the
resident population is close to the equilibrium of the associated LV P system when a mutant
appears in the community (Theorem 4.2).
The proof derives from the proof of Theorem 1 in [17] and from the results obtained in Section
4. The main idea is to study the invasion of a mutant trait in the community. Starting from

In the sequel we consider a mutant trait yk + v where v is distributed according to Π(yk , v)dv.

Theorem 4.2 the size of the mutant population with a continuous time birth and death process
25

with birth rate r di=1 B(xi , yk + v)n∗i (x, y) and death rate D(yk + v). Its growth rate is
then given by the invasion fitness F (yk + v; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y))) of the mutant trait in the
resident population. If the fitness is negative we prove that the mutant population goes extinct
similarly as in Lemma 4.4. Otherwise, the probability that the mutant population reaches
a positive density ε is close to the survival probability of the supercritical branching process
which is given by
F (yk + v; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y)))

P
r di=1 B(xi , yk + v)n∗i (x, y)
(see [8], p102). Moreover this phase lasts a time of order log K (see the proof of Lemma 3 in
[17]). Then using the large population approximation on a finite time interval (Proposition
2.2), we establish that the process Λ jumps to the equilibrium of the system LV P (x, (y, yk +
v)).

5.3

Small mutations: a canonical equations system for coevolution

In this subsection we consider a different scaling for the jump process Λ where the mutation
steps of both populations are of order ε (see [19, 20]). We study the limit of the sequence Λε in
a long time scale εt2 to observe global evolutionary dynamics. We establish that the limiting
behavior of the prey and predator traits satisfies a coupled system of differential equations.
These equations were heuristically introduced by Dieckmann, Law and Marrow (1996) [54].
They extend the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics to the coevolution of a prey and
predator interaction.
In the sequel we assume that every couple of a prey and a predator trait can coexist although
two prey traits cannot coexist.
Assumption E. a) For every (x, y) ∈ X ×Y, predators survive in the equilibrium of LV P (x, y):
b(x) − d(x)
D(y)
>
.
c(x, x)
rB(x, y)

(25)

b) Invasion implies fixation: For every (x, x0 ) ∈ X 2 and y ∈ Y, we have
s(x0 ; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y))) < 0,
or s(x0 ; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y))) > 0 and s(x; (n∗ (x0 , y), h∗ (x0 , y))) < 0.
c) The mutation densities π and Π are Lipschitz continuous on X × Rp and Y × RP .
d) The functions g and G defined for x, x0 ∈ X and y, y 0 ∈ Y by
s(x0 ; (x, y))

g(x0 ; (x, y)) = p(x)n∗ (x, y)b(x)

are continuous and C 1 with respect to their first variable.

26

(26)

Remark 5.4. Condition (25) compares the equilibrium sizes of the prey populations evolving
in the presence or the absence of predators. The predator survival requires that the prey
population size decreases in the presence of predators.
For every couple of traits (x, y), the equilibrium (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y)) of the system LV P (x, y)
given by Theorem 3.4 equals
n∗ (x, y) =

D(y)

and h∗ (x, y) =
b(x) − d(x) − c(x, x)

(27)

To ease notation, we denote in this section s(x0 ; (x, y)) = s(x0 ; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y))) and F (y 0 ; (x, y)) =
F (y 0 ; (n∗ (x, y), h∗ (x, y))).
Assumption E.b) and Theorem 3.4 entail that two prey types cannot coexist in the equilibrium of the deterministic system LV P . Together with the competitive exclusion principle
introduced in Section 3, this ensures that two predator populations cannot coexist either.
Therefore each mutant invasion (prey or predator) leads to the replacement of the resident
trait. The community is then always composed of a monomorphic prey population and a
monomorphic predator population:
Λ1ε (t) = n∗ (Xε (t), Yε (t))δXε (t) ,

Λ2ε (t) = h∗ (Xε (t), Yε (t))δYε (t) .

(28)

The following Theorem states the limiting behavior of the process (X(t/ε2 ), Y (t/ε2 )) as ε
goes to 0. The proof relies on a classical compactness-uniqueness argument that can be
immediately extended from [19] (Appendix C.).
Theorem 5.5. Let us assume Assumptions A, B, C, D, E and that the sequence of initial
conditions (Xε (0), Yε (0)) is bounded in L2 and converges in law toward a deterministic vector
(x0 , y0 ), then for every T > 0 the process (X(t/ε2 ), Y (t/ε2 )) converges in law in D([0, T ], X ×

Remark 5.6. In the large population limit with rare and small mutations, diversification
events of the population can be observed. These evolutionary branching are well understood
in the case of the evolution of a single population (see [19, 20]). They rely on the behavior of
the jump process Λ when coexistence of two traits occurs. The prey-predator coevolution make
the evolutionary branching properties of the trait processes complex to study. In particular, if
two prey traits coexist, the next mutation can lead to the coexistence of two predator traits as
well.
5.3.1

Application

We apply those results to the example introduced in Section 2.2 where prey individuals hold a
trait (qn , qa ) ∈ R × R+ and predators a trait (ρ, σ) ∈ R × R+ . We recall that the rate functions
are given in (2) and that the mutation measures are gaussian with respective variance γ and
Γ.
Derivating the fitness functions with respect to the mutant trait, we obtain

In particular ∇1 F ((ρ, σ); (qn , qa , ρ, σ)) = 0 if and only if ρ = qa and σ = |qa − ρ|.
We first study the coevolution of the traits qa and ρ, the values of σ and qn being fixed, as in
Figure 4. The system of differential equations governing the dynamics of qa and ρ is then

We deduce from the specific form of the system that for all t ≥ 0, h∗ (qa (t), qn (t)) > 0. Moreover there exist three cases depending on the respective values of the mutation probabilities
and variances and on the parameter r:
φ(qa , ρ) =

28

• If rΓΠ(ρ) > γπ(qa ), the difference |qa (t) − ρ(t)| decreases with time. This phenomena
was observed on Figure 4(b) on the first part of the graph.
• If rΓΠ(ρ) = γπ(qa ), both derivatives are equal for all times. The evolution then follows an arm race dynamics : both traits evolve continuously and |qa (t) − ρ(t)| remains
constant (see [55, 2, 24]).
• If rΓΠ(ρ) < γπ(qa ), prey escape the predator influence as the distance between qa and
ρ increases. When t → ∞, the solution converges toward a vector (qa∗ , ρ∗ ) that doesn’t
satisfy (25). However the extinction of the predator population is not possible in finite
time unlike in the process Λ (see Figure 4(a))
Then we consider, as in Figure 5, the prey strategies for the quantitative defense qn , when
the other traits are not affected by mutations:

In the case where αn ≥ βn , meaning that the allocative trade-off between producing a large

Then either qn∗ is negative and again qn (t) → 0 or qn∗ ≥ 0 and qn (t) converges to qn∗ when
t → ∞. With the parameters of Figure 5, qn∗ ≈ 0.58. We observed first an increase of qn and
then the extinction of predators. Thus, an important question is whether or not the predator
population dies out as t → ∞. An easy calculation gives that
h∗ (qn∗ ) > 0 ⇐⇒

βn
> 1,
β n − αn

which is always true if 0 < αn < βn . We deduce that the evolution of the quantitative defense
does not drive the predators to extinction. This prediction contradicts the extinction observed
in Figure 5. However, in this simulation Assumption E.b is not satisfied and the predator
extinction is due to the coexistence of two prey types.

Discussion

We introduced three different objects to describe the prey-predator community: a deterministic system LV P in (3), a stochastic jump process Λ in Section 5 and a couple of two canonical
equations in (29). These processes correspond to three different limits of the individual based
process introduced in Section 2.
The jump process Λ describes the dynamics of the community when mutations are rare.
It describes the successive equilibria of the community. In this sense, it justifies a simulation method developped in Ecology to study the phenotypic evolution of communities (see

29

[50, 48, 14]). In these articles, the community evolves as the solution of a system of differential equations. Each equation of the system describes the dynamics of a sub-population.
When a mutation occurs (at a very low rate), it increases the number of sub-populations and
thus a new equation is added to the system. Their method gives the successive equilibria of
the community similarly to the jump process Λ, however, it does not take into account the
demographic stochasticity as every mutant with a positive fitness invades the community.
Our model highlights the implications of coevolutionary dynamics for the ecological dynamics
of the community and its maintenance in time (see Section 5.1). Particularly, we show that
such consequences depend on the trait under scrutinity and on the costs that are associated
to these traits. For instance, the two categories of defenses have different implications in this
regard. If the evolution of qualitative defenses is fast enough, it can lead to the disappearance of the predators as in Figure 2 and 4, a phenomenon called ”evolutionary murders” (as
the evolution of a species in the community eventually kills another species). We note that
such evolutionary murders do not happen when one considers the evolution of quantitative
defenses. Likewise, the evolution of predators does not lead to the extinction of prey. Therefore, our study highlights how evolutionary murder phenomenons, already known in ecology
([13, 36, 24]) depend evolving species and types of traits that evolve. Even in the absence of
species extinction, we note that the coevolution also modifies the strength of the interactions
between species and can thus lead to the reinforcement of an interaction (see Figure 3). Or
as observed in Figure 2, evolution can induce the disappearance of an interaction (through
diminishing the competition between two plants). Interactions then progressively weaken and
become ”ghosts from the past”, as commonly observed in phylogenetic or evolutionary studies
(e.g. [75, 12]).
Such variations in interaction strength can have important consequences for the overall stability of the system. Indeed, in food webs, stability analyses suggest that distributions of
interaction strengths including weak interactions have a stabilizing effect on the dynamics of
the community [58] with important implications for the conservation of species and for the
delivery of ecosystem services. The question of the links between evolution and stability of
the network is therefore crucial. As shown in Figure 5, evolution can induce instability in
the network so that small perturbations of a population may lead to the extinction of one or
several populations (cf [46]).
The jump process contains the various behaviors present in ecological communities however
we only have little predictive information on the composition of the community at all times.
Therefore it can be interesting to consider the canonical system (29). This process represents
the dynamics of the traits present in the community under strong assumptions on the small
size of the mutation steps and on the non-coexistence of different traits of prey and predators.
The strong influence of prey on predators and vice versa can be well understood when we
consider the equilibria of this system. We only consider one-dimensional traits (p = P = 1).
If we consider the specific case of an equilibrium (x∗ , y ∗ ) such that
∂1 s(x∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ )) = 0 and ∂1 F (y ∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ )) = 0

(33)

This equilibrium corresponds to a two-dimensional version of the Evolutionary strategies introduced in [59] for the one-dimensional canonical equation. A natural question about this
30

equilibrium is a condition for its stability. The Jacobian matrix at a point (x, y) is given by:
!
n∗ (x, y)(∂11 s(x; (x, y)) + ∂12 s(x; (x, y)))
n∗ (x, y)(∂13 s(x; (x, y))
h∗ (x, y)∂12 F (y; (x, y))
h∗ (x, y)(∂11 F (y; (x, y))) + ∂13 F (y; (x, y)))
(34)
Note that the conditions
∂11 s(x∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ )) + ∂12 s(x∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ ) < 0,
and
∂11 F (y ∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ ))) + ∂13 F (y ∗ ; (x∗ , y ∗ )) < 0,
are not sufficient nor necessary to ensure the stability of the equilibrium (x∗ , y ∗ ). These
two conditions correspond to the local stability of the equilibrium x∗ when we consider the
evolution of the prey trait in the presence of a fixed predator trait y ∗ and conversely for the
evolution of the predator trait in the presence of prey individuals holding the fixed trait x∗
(see [19]).
The branching properties of the community are complex to study. Indeed, they rely on a
precise study of the jump process Λ after the first coexistence of two traits. As we have seen
in the simulations, the coexistence in the prey population can lead to extinction of predators
(see Figure 2 and 5), or to the coexistence of different trait of predators (see Figure 4(b)).
Throughout this work we considered the same time scales for both prey and predators.
Note that while this hypothesis of similar evolutionary time scales allows a first grasp on
the effects of coevolution on the ecological dynamics of such interactions, strong asymmetries
actually occur in nature. Taking again the example of plant-herbivore interactions, large
asymmetries of demographic and evolutionary time scales can arise when the two partners
have large differences in terms of body size and generation time (eg, tree-insect interactions
such as [66] or, at the other extreme, grass-large herbivore interactions [9]). We will consider
such asymmetries of time scales in a future work.

Construction of a trajectory of the prey-predator community process

We construct a trajectory of the prey-predator community process as solution of a system
stochastic differential equations driven by Poisson point measures (see [34],[18]). We introduce two families of independent Poisson point measures on (R+ )2 with intensity dsdθ:
(Rj )1≤j≤d+m for the prey and predators reproduction events and (Mj )1≤j≤d+m for the death
events. Then, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ d and ∀1 ≤ l ≤ m

Let us explain briefly these equations. We focus on the prey population NiK with trait
xi . A trajectory is constructed using two Poisson point measures Ri and Mi . The measure Ri handles the reproduction events and Mi the death events. A Poisson point measure R on (R+ )2 with intensity dsdθ charges a countable set of points Ω = {(su , θu ), u ∈
N} (with mass 1 on each point) (e.g. [78] Chapter I.8 for a complete definition). Then

population. The other integrals have similar interpretations.
The existence of solutions of (35) is justified by Proposition 2.1i). From this construction, we
deduce the expression of the prey and the predator population sizes:

The function Ψ is the sum of three terms that we handle separately. The first term gathers
together all the predation effects. The second term (sum of the second and third terms) only
depends on the prey population. The last term is related to the death of predators. We start
with the first term. To remove the dependence on the traits, we search for conditions on the
term between square brackets to be non positive. This is equivalent to consider the sign of

Proof of Theorem 3.3

The proof relies on the expression of Linear Complementarity Problems as variational inequality problems.
Definition C.1. The variational inequality problem associated with a function f : Ru → Ru
and a subset E ⊂ Ru seeks a vector z ∈ E such that
∀a ∈ E,

(a − z)T f (z) ≥ 0.

(46)

The existence of solutions is not true in a general setting but we are interested in a specific
framework where the subset E is compact and convex.
Theorem C.2. Let E be a non empty compact convex of Ru and f continuous function, then
the variational inequality problem associated to (f, E) admits a solution.
The proof of Theorem C.2 is rather classical and requires to express a solution as a fix
point of a projection of the subset E (see [21] Theorem 3.7.1). With this result we can prove
the Theorem 3.3.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. Let us recall that a solution to the Linear complementarity problem
f, qe) defined in (15) is a vector z = (n, h) ∈ Rd × Rm such that:
associated to the couple (M
for every 1 ≤ i ≤ d and 1 ≤ l ≤ m,
ni ≥ 0,

(q + M n + Bh)i ≥ 0,

(n)T (q + M n + Bh) = 0

(47)

(h)T (D − B T n) = 0

(48)

and
hl ≥ 0,

(D − B T n)l ≥ 0,

These conditions (47) entail that the vector n is a solution to LCP (M, q + Bh).
Note that if n ∈ Rd is solution to the restricted problem LCP (M, q) satisfying moreover
f, qe).
(−B T n + D)l ≥ 0 for all 1 ≤ l ≤ m, then the vector (n, 0) is solution to LCP (M
Similarly we seek a suitable vector n and adjust it thanks to the vector h.

36

We consider the variational inequality problem associated to the set
E = {n ∈ (R+ )d ,

∀1 ≤ l ≤ m (D − B T n)l ≥ 0},

and the continuous function f (n) = q + M n.
Since D is non negative, the set E is not empty. Moreover E is convex, closed and bounded
thus compact. Theorem C.2 ensures the existence of a solution n∗ to this problem. Note that
(46) can be written as
∀a ∈ E, aT f (n∗ ) ≥ (n∗ )T f (n∗ ).
Thus n∗ minimizes the function a → aT f (n∗ ) on E. Therefore
• either n∗ is in the interior of E and is therefore a global minimizer of the function
f, qe).
a → aT f (n∗ ) on Rd and (n∗ , 0) is a solution to LCP (M
• otherwise we can define the Lagrange multipliers for this problem. There exist d + m

which are predictable with respect to the filtration Ft generated by the processes ZK . Both
families are uniformly bounded by a parameter κ > 0.
The perturbation Z K is solution of the following system of stochastic differential equations
driven by the Poisson point measures Ri and Mi introduced in Appendix A.

The proof relies on the study of the stochastic process L(Z K ) where L is the Lyapunov
37

function for the system LV P (x, y) introduced in (10) with an appropriate choice of γ. The
function L is the sum of two functions V and W . V defined in (8) is linear in the coordinate
ni , i ∈ P and hl , l ∈ Q and strictly convex in the other coordinates. Moreover, its Hessian
matrix at z∗ is diagonal. W defined (11) is a quadratic form in (z − z∗ ). This justifies the
inequality (19):

This inequality is the main tool of the proof. It connects the time spent by the process above
a given threshold with the values it takes during this time interval.
We define Sκ = inf{t ≥ 0, ||Z K (t) − z∗ ||2 ≤ 2C 000 κ}. Then for every t ≤ Sκ ∧ T ∧ τεK :

||Z K (t) − z∗ ||2 ≤ C C 0 (||Z K (0) − z∗ ||P Q ) + sup |M K (t)| − C 00 C 000 κt .

As the l.h.s. is nonnegative we define
C 0 (||Z K (0) − z∗ ||P Q + sup[0,T ] |M K (t)|
Tκ =

C 00 C 000 κ

(53)

which can be seen as the maximal time spent by the process ||ZK (t)−z∗ ||2 above 2C 000 κ before
the time T ∧ τεK . Therefore for every t ≤ Sκ ∧ T ∧ τεK :
||Z K (t) − z∗ ||2 ≤ CC 00 C 000 κTκ .
To control the norm ||Z K (t) − z∗ ||2 it remains to control Tκ and thus the martingale M K . To
obtain the uniform bound, we use the exponential bound given by Lemma 4.3. On the event

then sup[0,Sκ ] (||Z K (t) − z∗ ||2 ) ≤ ε2 , and in particular Sκ ≤ τεK ∧ Tκ .
Moreover applying (52) on the same event we get

Thus if furthermore κ < ε2 /(2CC 00 C 000 T ) then τεK > T .
These results lead to the Theorem. Let ε0 > 0 such that ε00 < ε0 /2 < ε0 < ε.
We introduce a sequence of stopping times that describes the back and forth of the process
Z K between the balls Bε00 and Bε0 /2 (see Figure 6). Set τ0 = 0 and for every k ≥ 1 such that

We denote by kε the number of back and forths before the exit:
kε = inf{k ∈ N, τk = τεK }.
In the sequel we bound kε from below.
We consider an initial condition Z K (0) ∈ Bε0 . We set κ = (ε00 )2 /2C 000 and apply the previous
results. The time τ1 corresponds to the first return in Bε00 therefore it is equal to the time Sκ
introduced before. We deduce from the previous computations that on the event (54)

therefore we can bound kε from below by a random variable distributed according to a geometric law of parameter exp(−KV ). Then
lim P(kε > exp(KV /2)) = 1.

It remains to prove that these back and forths do not happen too fast. We establish that the
time intervals τk − τk−1 are of order 1 for k ≥ 2. To this aim we search for T 0 such that for
every k ≥ 2, P(τk0 − τk−1 > T 0 ) > 0. Using the strong Markov property again, it is sufficient
to prove that inf Z K (0)∈Bε00 P(τ10 > T 0 ) > 0:
