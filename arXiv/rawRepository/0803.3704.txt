A omplex two-parameter model resembling the lassial voter model is introdued to desribe
maroeologial properties of tropial tree ommunities. Monte-Carlo type omputer simulations are
performed on the model, investigating speies abundanes and the spatial distribution of individuals
and speies. Simulation results are ritially ompared with the experimental data obtained from
a tree ensus on a 50 hetares area of the Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. The model
parameters are optimized for reproduing quantitatively the experimental results from the BCI
dataset.

On long time salesevolutionary timethe partiular harateristis of speies evolve widely from birth to
extintion, while throughout eologial time most speies
persist sometimes for deades or even enturies [1, 2‚ÑÑ.
Their organization in omplex networks of loal ommunities and extended metaommunities is subjet to
abundant variations in terms of relative distributions.
Usually, speies maintain themselves with onstant abundane but, from time-to-time, proesses suh as invasion
or suession produe fast regrouping throughout a partiular site or region [3‚ÑÑ.
Maroeology [2, 4, 5‚ÑÑ studies the relationships be-

anisms from whih the biodiversity and the struture of
eologial ommunities originate [1, 2, 3‚ÑÑ.

The diul-

ties in explaining the biologial diversity of suh systems
originate from the very dierent spatial and temporal
sales, starting with the evolution and biogeographi distribution of speies and ending with individual births and
deaths in loal ommunities. Present approahes for desribing the dynamis of population genetis and eology

A simple spatially expliit model, whih was rst onsidered in [25‚ÑÑ, was extended here for explaining the statistial properties of individuals and speies in a tropial
tree ommunity. The model is dened on a square lattie
and it is inspired by the lassial voter model [28‚ÑÑ. It desribes in a realisti manner the spatiality of individuals,
