Abstract:
Astrophysical ionizing radiation events have been recognized as a potential threat
to life on Earth, primarily through depletion of stratospheric ozone and
subsequent increase in surface-level solar ultraviolet radiation. Simulations of the
atmospheric effects of a variety of events (such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts,
and solar proton events) have been previously published, along with estimates of
biological damage at Earth’s surface. In this work, we employed the TUV
radiative transfer model to expand and improve calculations of surface-level
irradiance and biological impacts following an ionizing radiation event. We

considered changes in surface-level UVB, UVA, and photosynthetically active
radiation (visible light) for clear-sky conditions and fixed aerosol parameter
values. We also considered a wide range of biological effects on organisms
ranging from humans to phytoplankton. We found that past work overestimated
UVB irradiance, but that relative estimates for increase in exposure to DNA
damaging radiation are still similar to our improved calculations. We also found
that the intensity of biologically damaging radiation varies widely with organism
and specific impact considered; these results have implications for biosphere-level
damage following astrophysical ionizing radiation events. When considering
changes in surface-level visible light irradiance, we found that, contrary to
previous assumptions, a decrease in irradiance is only present for a short time in
very limited geographical areas; instead we found a net increase for most of the
modeled time-space region. This result has implications for proposed climate
changes associated with ionizing radiation events.

1. Introduction

Astrophysical ionizing radiation events have been recognized as a potential threat
to life on Earth for decades. While there is the possibility for direct biological
damage from redistributed radiation (Martin et al., 2009, Peñate et al., 2010),
several studies have indicated that the greatest long term threat is from ozone
depletion and subsequent heightened solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Reid and
McAffee, 1978; Gehrels et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2005; Thomas, 2009; Atri et
al. 2014). Stratospheric ozone normally shields surface-dwelling life from
harmful UV, particularly the UVB band, 280-315 nm. Atmospheric ionization,
caused by high energy photons or cosmic ray particles, creates nitrogen oxides
(most importantly NO and NO2) which catalytically destroy ozone. Depending on
the event’s energy fluence and spectrum, this depletion can be severe and long
lived, leading to greatly increased surface irradiation by solar UV (Thomas et al.,
2005; Ejzak et al., 2007). It is known that organisms exposed to this irradiation
experience harmful effects such as sunburn and even direct damage to DNA,
proteins, or other cellular structures.

Simulations of the atmospheric effects of a variety of events have been
completed, including gamma-ray bursts (both long-soft and short-hard types),
supernovae (SNe), and solar proton events (SPEs). That work focused primarily

Page 3 of 63

on production of NOx (NO and NO2) and subsequent depletion of stratospheric O3
(Gehrels et al., 2003; Melott et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012,
2013; Ejzak et al., 2007). Estimates of biological damage following O3 depletion
have also been presented, using calculations of surface-level (solar) UVB
combined with a DNA damage weighting function (Setlow, 1976; Smith et al.,
1980).

Melott and Thomas (2011) reviewed a wide range of astrophysical events and
concluded that supernovae, short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SHGRBs), and longsoft gamma-ray bursts (LSGRBs) (respectively) are the most likely astrophysical
events to pose serious threats to life on Earth over a few100 million year time
scales. Determining these rates depends, in part, on estimates of the biological
damage of varying ozone depletion levels. Melott and Thomas (2011) assumed
that globally averaged depletion of 5% would have a noticeable biological impact,
based on the fact that today’s anthropogenic depletion is about this amount, while
globally averaged depletion of 35% is likely to have mass-extinction level effects,
based on results of previous modeling work.

A 35% global average decrease of O3 in Earth’s atmosphere is expected to have a
major effect on terrestrial and marine life that is exposed to solar UV radiation.
However, the calculations of UVB irradiance and use of relative DNA damage

Page 4 of 63

estimates in past work has inherent limitations; we would like to have both more
accurate and more varied measures of the biological damage associated with such
extreme O3 depletion. Such improved results should make possible better
estimates of the rates of threatening events.

The goal of this study, then, is to broaden and improve estimates of the biological
impact on Earth’s surface of astrophysical ionizing radiation events. To this end,
we employed full atmospheric radiative transfer modeling, utilizing results of
previously completed atmospheric modeling to produce surface-level spectral
irradiance values in the UV and visible for various cases. These results were then
used to compute biologically damaging exposure of a variety of impacts. We
limited our modeling to clear-sky conditions (no clouds) and fixed aerosol
parameter values.

While the atmospheric modeling utilized here represents realistic conditions, it
does not include changes to clouds or aerosols that could potentially affect some
chemistry that is of interest; we discuss this issue further in Section 2.1 below.
The assumptions employed in radiative transfer modeling of clear-sky conditions
and fixed aerosol parameters obviously limit our results to a simplified physical
situation, which will not match all realistic possibilities. However, this choice

Page 5 of 63

greatly simplifies interpretation of our most important results and in particular
allows us to focus on a “worst case” scenario.

2. Methods

2.1. Atmospheric modeling

Here, we use previously completed atmospheric modeling reported in Thomas et
al. (2005). That paper presents results of modeling the effects of a long-soft
gamma-ray burst with variation of many different parameters, including fluence,
time of year of event, and location of event in latitude. Modeling reported in that
work was performed by using the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center twodimensional (latitude, altitude) time-dependent atmospheric chemistry and
dynamics model (hereafter referred to as the “GSFC atmospheric model”). The
model contains 65 chemical species and computes atmospheric constituents in a
largely empirical background of solar radiation and galactic cosmic ray variations,
with photodissociation included. The model includes heterogeneous processes
(e.g., on polar stratospheric clouds), which are important for controlling ozone
depletion and winds and small scale mixing. The model does not include
dynamic feedback to the temperature fields and so cannot be used as a climate
model. Extensive detail about the atmospheric modeling, including a full

Page 6 of 63

discussion of all included reactions and processes, as well as discussion of
modeling uncertainties, can be found in the works of Thomas et al. (2005) and
Ejzak et al. (2007).

A correlation between cosmic ray flux and clouds in Earth’s atmosphere has been
described (see, for instance, Marsh and Svensmark, 2000). However, this
correlation has been called into question by Sloan and Wolfendale (2008) and
Erlykin and Wolfendale (2011). Further, the claim of a correlation between
climate change and spiral arm crossings (used to support the cosmic ray-cloud
connection) by Shaviv (2002) has been effectively ruled out based on updated
knowledge of Galactic dynamics (Overholt et al., 2009). The physical mechanism
itself, involving enhanced formation of aerosols and nucleation sites, (Tinsley,
2000; Svensmark et al., 2009), while plausible, is not established (Wagner et al.,
2001; Pierce and Adams, 2009). The CLOUD experiment at CERN has sought to
establish such a mechanism, with inconclusive results (Duplissy et al., 2010,
Kirkby et al., 2011).

While this possible effect on clouds and aerosols is relevant to our present study,
with the large uncertainty surrounding the issue and no well-established physical
mechanism, we could not accurately include such effects in atmospheric
chemistry modeling. Furthermore, with no quantitative connection between

Page 7 of 63

ionization and aerosol/cloud characteristics, there is no way to realistically
determine the appropriate parameter values for radiative transfer modeling. We
therefore ignore any changes in aerosols or clouds proceeding from ionizing
radiation in the atmosphere.

Ejzak et al. (2007) showed that O3 depletion depends on total energy and spectral
hardness, not duration of the event. For this study, changes in NO2 and O3 are the
parameters of interest; therefore, the exact astrophysical event chosen is not
important. Our results may be applied to any event with similar atmospheric
consequences, including SNe and both types of GRBs. Further, our
computational technique may be applied to any future modeling of events that
cause significant atmospheric ionization leading to formation of NO2 and
depletion of O3; the event parameters of relevance are energy fluence and spectral
hardness.

We chose to focus our analysis here on the results of one particular case: an
LSGRB with fluence 100 kJ m-2, occurring over Earth’s South Pole, in late June
(roughly the Southern Hemisphere winter solstice). This choice is motivated by
several factors. First, Melott and Thomas (2009) argued that a South-Polar burst
fits well with what is currently known about the late Ordovician mass-extinction.
Second, we wish to examine an extreme (but still realistic) event, with severe O3

Page 8 of 63

depletion; a polar burst isolates the ozone-depleting compounds to that
hemisphere, which tends to result in greater localized O3 depletion. Finally, the
June case is a middle-ground example of maximum depletion for a polar burst.
The maximum localized decrease in total vertical column density of O3 for this
case is about 70%, and the maximum globally averaged decrease in total vertical
column density is about 32%, roughly the level of depletion assumed to be massextinction level in previous work (e.g., Melott and Thomas, 2011).

Figure 1 shows the percent difference in column density O3 for runs with and
without GRB ionization input, as a function of latitude and time after the event.
Note that because the GRB was modeled as occurring over the South Pole, the O3
depletion is concentrated in that hemisphere; we will focus further analysis to
these Southern latitudes. The apparently anomalous “spikes” of increased O3 in
the extreme South-Polar region at roughly days 50-75 and 400-410 are caused by
abrupt photolysis of NO2 at the beginning of Polar spring, which generates large
quantities of atomic O that briefly generates O3. This feature is well understood,
and more details can be found in the work of Thomas et al. (2005). Our analysis
of biological effects will focus on mid-Southern-latitudes, and so we will not be
concerned with this complication of O3 production. Our focus on mid latitudes is
motivated by previous work (e.g., Thomas et al., 2005) showing that, for a range

Page 9 of 63

of GRB cases over different latitudes and times of year, DNA-damage weighted
irradiance is greatest at mid latitudes (about 20-50°).

Figure 2 shows the globally averaged percent difference in column density O3
over 10 years following the event. Note that full recovery takes just over 10
years, and globally averaged depletion greater than 20% persists for just over 4
years.

2.2. Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Modeling

The primary goal of this study was to improve estimates of the biological impact
of astrophysical ionizing radiation events. Results of the atmospheric modeling
described above are passed to a radiative transfer model, producing surface-level
spectral irradiance values between 280 nm and 700 nm (covering the UVB, UVA,
and visible wavebands). These results are then used to compute exposure
weighted for a variety of biological impacts, as described below. To simplify our
conclusions and focus on “worst case” outcomes, we performed radiative transfer
modeling assuming clear skies, with no clouds. We included realistic (but timeindependent) aerosol parameter values, as described below.

Page 10 of 63

Our primary tool for computing surface irradiance is version 5.0 of the publically
available Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) radiative transfer model,
downloaded from http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/ (Madronich and Flocke
1997). Calculations are performed for atmospheric conditions following
astrophysical ionizing radiation events, as described above. Several modifications
have been made to TUV to directly use the profiles produced by the GSFC
atmospheric model.

Previously published work (Thomas et al., 2005, 2007; Ejzak et al., 2007)
included computed estimates of the increase in surface UVB under an ozonedepleted atmosphere using a simplified Beer-Lambert approach that included only
absorption by a column of O3 and neglected scattering and effects of other
atmospheric constituents. We compared results from TUV to those using the
Beer-Lambert approach, and found that the latter overestimates the UVB
irradiance in every case considered by about a factor of 2 or less; the overestimate
increases with solar zenith angle. These results are not surprising; since the BeerLambert method neglects scattering, we would expect to see higher surface level
irradiance values.

It should be noted that results described by Thomas et al. (2005), Ejzak et al.
(2007), and authors of related works did not directly report surface-level UVB

Page 11 of 63

values. Instead, relative DNA damage values were given (computed using the
Setlow (1974) DNA damage weighting function). Therefore, past work did not
consider absolute UVB or DNA damaging (weighted) exposure, but reported
instead the normalized values to give a sense of the relative damage at any given
location and time. This approach has the advantage of removing effects of
uncertainties such as the simplified Beer-Lambert calculation. However, in the
present work we wish to more quantitatively define the damaging exposure
expected for marine phytoplankton and other biological impacts, and therefore
will look at absolute irradiance values combined with more appropriate weighting
functions. This requires the more accurate surface irradiance values produced by
a full radiative transfer model.

2.2.1. Treatment of Aerosols and Selection of Aerosol Parameter Values

A potentially important variable affecting surface irradiance in the real
atmosphere is the presence of aerosol particles. Our investigation focused on
irradiation over the open ocean, at mid latitudes, and we therefore sought
parameter values appropriate for this setting. As noted above, we restricted our
modeling to clear-sky conditions, so we set the cloud optical depth to zero in
TUV.

Page 12 of 63

TUV reads in a total aerosol optical depth (AOD) value, along with values for
single scattering albedo (SSA) and Angstrom coefficient (α). In addition, a
wavelength-independent asymmetry factor (g) is set by default to be 0.61. The
default aerosol profile in TUV is for continental conditions. We modified the
default TUV aerosol profile to match that used for clean marine conditions in
another widely used radiative transfer model, the System for Transfer of
Atmospheric Radiation (STAR) (Ruggaber et al., 1994). Figure 3 shows the
aerosol profile used.

We searched the literature to determine appropriate ranges for the aerosol
parameters in TUV, for clean air over the open ocean at mid latitude (“clean
marine” conditions). Default values in the model are for continental conditions,
with AOD = 0.235 (at a wavelength of 550 nm), SSA = 0.99, and α = 1.0. Most
measurements of optical depth are given at a wavelength of 500 nm. Kedia and
Ramachandran (2009) listed a range of values for a “maritime clean” model from
0.04 to 0.13. They also quoted measurements from the AERONET program,
which range from 0.07 to 0.14. We examined data from AERONET for sites at
Bermuda, Midway, Coconut Island, Tahiti, Guam, Azores, Prospect Hill, and
Ascension Island. Level 2.0 data was retrieved from the AERONET website
(http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/). For each location, we recorded the annual average

Page 13 of 63

for the year 2001 of the 500 nm AOD and 870-440 nm Angstrom parameter
values. The range in AOD values for the sites listed is from 0.063 to 0.187.
Mulcahy et al. (2009) gave an average “clean marine” AOD value of 0.14 ± 0.06.

Taking an average of the extreme range represented by the various ranges above
(from 0.04 to 0.20) gives 0.12, at 500 nm. TUV requires input of the optical
depth at 550 nm. The optical depth at a given wavelength is given by

τ1 = τ 2 ( λ2 / λ1 )α , where τi is the optical depth at wavelength λi and α is the
Angstrom coefficient. As discussed below, we take α = 0.4, which gives AOD =

€

0.116 at 550 nm.

Petters et al. (2003) and Kazantzidis et al. (2001) gave single scattering albedo
values of about 0.89. Hatzianastassiou et al. (2004) gave a value of 0.96.
Mulcahy et al. (2009) described clean marine conditions as being dominated by
“relatively large supermicron particles, such as sea salt,” which are highly
reflective. We therefore chose to leave SSA at its default value of 0.99.

For the Angstrom coefficient, Kedia and Ramachandran (2009) listed a range of
values for a “maritime clean” model from 0.2 to 0.93, for the wavelength range
440 to 870 nm. Data from AERONET for the sites listed above has a range from

Page 14 of 63

0.290 to 0.912. Mulcahy et al. (2009) gave an average “clean marine” value of
0.40 +- 0.29. We adopted this average value, setting a = 0.4 in TUV.

The asymmetry factor in TUV is by default set to 0.61 at all altitudes and
wavelengths. We have modified this to 0.75 (retaining altitude and wavelength
independence), based on values given by Hatzianastassiou et al. (2004) and
Papadimas et al. (2009) for clean marine conditions.

Overall, then, we take the following values as best for clean marine conditions in
TUV: AOD = 0.116 (at 550nm), SSA = 0.99, α = 0.4, g = 0.75.

We performed analyses to determine how sensitive modeling results are to
changes in aerosol parameters. While we do not report those details here, we note
some general conclusions. First, for any result of interest to us, a physically
realistic variation in the Angstrom coefficient has no significant effect. Single
scattering albedo shows a larger difference, but since we wish to restrict our
attention to clean marine conditions (without, for instance, large amounts of black
carbon), we believe that a fixed value of 0.99 is realistic. For total aerosol optical
depth, we see small variation in total irradiance for all wavebands (UVB, UVA,
and PAR) across the AOD range of interest. Since our primary interest is the
change in surface-level total irradiance and its biological impact, potential

Page 15 of 63

variability in AOD is not of great concern. Our choice of an average value should
suffice for general purposes and in particular for comparisons of the impact of
differing ozone column densities and other parameters, which is our primary
purpose. Finally, we note that modifying the default, continental aerosol profile
in TUV to a clean marine profile resulted in less than 1% difference in spectral
difference in spectral irradiance in the UV and visible.

We also checked the sensitivity of surface irradiance to surface albedo value. An
application of this work (evaluating water-column photosynthesis productivity of
phytoplankton, reported elsewhere) requires computations involving penetration
of light into ocean water. Ocean surface albedo varies depending on several
factors including solar zenith angle, total aerosol optical depth, wind speed, and
ocean chlorophyll concentration (Jin et al. 2004). Of these parameters, solar
zenith angle has the largest effect, with the albedo value ranging from about 0.03
to about 0.3, depending on specific values of the parameters considered. In TUV,
albedo is set to a single constant value by default. Leaving all other parameters
fixed, we compared results for albedo values of 0.02 and 0.44 (the extreme range
reported in Jin et al. 2004). We found a 22% difference in total UVB irradiance.
A 0.1 difference in albedo gives a 5% difference in total UVB.

Page 16 of 63

To improve the accuracy of our results, we modified TUV to incorporate a
dynamic surface albedo, utilizing the look-up table described by Jin et al. (2004).
Data and a read-in subroutine were obtained from
http://snowdog.larc.nasa.gov/jin/getocnlut.html. The read-in subroutine was used
as a template to modify the setalb subroutine in TUV. This modified subroutine
takes values from the main program for solar zenith angle, as well as total aerosol
optical depth. In addition, values are specified (manually) for wind speed and
ocean chlorophyll concentration; these values are not normally a part of the TUV
model. While there is of course variability in these values in nature, we have
chosen representative values of 7.8 m s-1 for wind speed (an annual global average
of values from SCOW, obtained from http://cioss.coas.oregonstate.edu/scow/) and
of 0.20 mg m-3 for chlorophyll concentration (a global average value, given in Jin
et al. 2004).

As noted in Section 1, out assumptions of clear-sky conditions and fixed aerosol
parameters do limit our results to a simplified physical situation. This allows us
to focus on our main results and present a “worst case” situation for an ionizing
radiation event. In addition, with no realistic way of knowing how aerosol
parameters may be affected by ionizing radiation in Earth’s atmosphere (see
Section 2.1), a fixed set of values seems most appropriate for this study; as noted

Page 17 of 63

above, realistic variations in the TUV aerosol parameters do not significantly
affect our primary results.

Finally, it should be noted that our main results (Section 3) are given as relative
values, comparing results in the GRB case versus results for a normal atmosphere
case. Both cases are run with exactly the same TUV settings, except for NO2 and
O3 number density profiles. Therefore, variations in quantities such as the aerosol
parameters should not be a significant factor in those relative values.

2.2.2. Adapting TUV for use with Atmospheric Modeling Results

Some modifications were made to TUV for easier use with results from the GSFC
atmospheric model. First, TUV was modified slightly to read in an altitude
profile of O3 number density from the ground to 90 km (with 46 levels). This
profile is an output of atmospheric modeling of a particular event when using the
GSFC model, and includes both altitude values and corresponding O3 number
density values. We have similarly modified TUV to read in an altitude profile of
NO2. This constituent has a strong absorption band centered around 400 nm and
is present in greatly enhanced quantities following an ionizing radiation event.
We are interested in considering the impact on primary productivity, and so
reductions in photosynthetically available radiation are important; in addition,

Page 18 of 63

change in UVA can be significant for photosynthesis inhibition. When O3 and
NO2 profiles are read in, the total column density is computed from the profile,
with the option to instead scale to an input value. We have further modified TUV
to output both direct and diffuse spectral irradiance across the range from 280 to
700 nm, with 1 nm resolution.

With changes in O3 concentration, changes in the temperature profile of the
atmosphere occur. These changes could potentially impact surface UV irradiance,
since O3 absorption is temperature dependent. The GSFC model does not include
dynamic feedback to temperatures, and so we cannot include these changes in the
radiative transfer modeling. However, previous studies (Thomas et al. 2005) have
indicated that temperature changes are likely to be small (around 10 K). We have
conducted tests with TUV with modified temperature profiles. The O3 profiles
associated with an ionizing radiation event show decreased concentrations in the
stratosphere, but increased concentrations in the upper troposphere. We therefore
modified the standard temperature profile with an increase of 10 K between 10
and 15 km altitude, and a decrease of 10 K between 20 and 30 km altitude.
Irradiance is changed by less than 1% in this case, over all wavelengths of
interest; a similar change of 50 K yields approximately 1% difference. We
therefore conclude that lack of temperature feedback is not a significant source of
error here.

2.3. Modeling of photobiological impacts

Most previous studies seeking to understand the impact of astrophysical ionizing
radiation events on life on Earth have relied on simple measures such as the
increase in UVB alone, or DNA damage due to enhanced UVB (Thomas et al.,
2005; Ejzak et al., 2007; Melott and Thomas, 2009, 2011; Martin et al. 2009),
though Peñate et al. (2010) also considered the impact of the short-term UV
“flash” from a GRB on oceanic photosynthesis. Computing changes in UVB or
DNA damaging exposure provides a simple way to evaluate the potential severity
of biological impacts of various events. It is also useful in exploring features such
as the spatial extent and duration of the most intense impacts. However, changes
in UVB irradiance or DNA damaging exposure alone is overly simplistic when
trying to evaluate just how damaging a particular event may be to Earth’s
biosphere as a whole. In the first place, UVB is not the only biologically active
waveband affected by atmospheric changes that follow an ionizing radiation
event; the UVA and PAR bands are also affected, as discussed above. Further,
these different forms of radiation can have complicated, and interacting, effects,
and those effects may be very different for different organisms. In particular,
DNA damaging exposure estimates overlook the fact that most organisms have

Page 20 of 63

protection and repair mechanisms, some of which are affected by UVA and PAR
irradiance (Williamson et al. 2001; Bancroft et al. 2007).

An important goal of this study was to use our improved surface-level irradiance
calculations to look much more broadly and accurately at the biological impacts
we may expect following an intense astrophysical ionizing radiation event. While
we focus here on one particular kind of radiation event, our results will be
applicable to a wide range of events (as discussed in Sections 1 and 2.1), and our
computational approach can be applied to any event of interest.

Many different photobiological impacts of UV radiation have been identified.
The most obvious for humans are sunburn (erythema) and skin cancer, which
have also been identified in other organisms, such as whales (Martinez-Levasseur
et al., 2011) and fish (Sweet et al., 2012). Other work has focused on aquatic life
of various types (e.g. Boucher and Prezelin 1996; Hader, 1997; Kouwenberg et
al., 1999; Hader et al., 2007; Bancroft et al., 2007), amphibians (Blaustein et al.,
1994; Blaustein and Kiesecker, 2002), terrestrial plants (e.g. Flint and Caldwell,
2003a,b; Wu et al. 2009; Kakani et al., 2003; Searles et al., 2001), and terrestrial
ecosystems as a whole (Ballare et al., 2011; Caldwell et al., 1998, Bjorn et al.,
1996).

Page 21 of 63

The TUV model includes a variety of built-in biological weighting functions
(BWFs) that may be used to compute effective exposure for impacts such as
direct DNA damage, sunburn and skin cancer in humans, cataracts in pig eyes (a
good model for human eyes), plant damage, and phytoplankton photosynthesis
inhibition. In Section 3.2, we present results of applying several BWFs to our
surface irradiance results.

3. Results

3.1. Surface-level irradiance

In Figure 4, we present ratios of irradiance in the GRB case versus that in a
normal background case for the first two years following the event. Note that
these figures are restricted to a latitude range from 5°N to 65°S; the motivation
for this range of focus is discussed in Section 2.1. The ratio is computed for noon
time irradiance at each location, under clear skies (no clouds). Figure 4 shows the
ratios of UVB (280-315 nm), UVA (315-400 nm), and photosynthetically active
radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm). In addition, Figure 5 shows spectral ratios from
295 nm to 700 nm, at 35°S for two specific days after the event. Several features
may be noted in these results. First, UVB is everywhere higher in the GRB case

Page 22 of 63

(seen in Figure 4 and the top panels of Figure 5), as may be expected due to the
depletion of O3. (Note in Figure 5 that the top panels show the log ratio of
irradiance in the UVB part of the spectrum.) Second, UVA is everywhere lower
in the GRB case (seen in Figure 4 and the bottom panels of Figure 5); this is due
to increased NO2 column density, which absorbs strongly between about 320 nm
and 480 nm. Finally, in the GRB case PAR is initially lower and then becomes
higher (seen in Figure 4 and the bottom panels of Figure 5).

This change in PAR is due to a competition between increased NO2 column
density and decreased O3 column density. NO2 absorbs in the short wavelength
(approximately 400-500 nm) end of the PAR region, while O3 has an absorption
band centered around 600 nm and extending across most of the PAR region.
These competing effects can be seen most clearly in the bottom panels of Figure
5. Initially, NO2 is greatly enhanced by the induced atmospheric ionization and
then slowly is reduced by conversion into other species such as NO3; the greatest
O3 depletion is somewhat delayed (see Figure 6), due primarily to seasonal effects
(see Section 2.1). Therefore, initially the absorption of PAR by NO2 dominates,
leading to a decrease in the total irradiance; later, decreased absorption by O3
leads to a net increase in PAR. It should also be noted that, while broad-band
PAR is initially decreased by NO2, there is still a small increase across part of the
PAR wavelength range. This is due to the reduced absorption by O3 that begins

Page 23 of 63

immediately following the event (which then worsens over the next few years
before recovering).

These results have implications for different biological impacts. UVB is
uniformly damaging for organisms. UVA can be damaging, but also plays a role
in photorepair of damage caused by UVB (Williamson et al. 2001; Bancroft et al.
2007). PAR is of course important in photosynthesis, but also can contribute to
photosynthesis inhibition. Therefore, the overall result is complicated – UVB will
cause damage, but increased PAR may help offset that. On the other hand, UVA
is important for photorepair mechanisms, and so reduced UVA may lead to
enhanced damage caused by UVB. We do not attempt to examine all of these
details here. Instead, we use BWFs that incorporate all relevant wavelengths and
then consider overall biological results for each BWF.

Other work on the terrestrial effects of a GRB has considered the possibility of a
reduction in PAR due to NO2 absorption, and speculated that this change could
cause a cooling in the climate (Melott et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2005; Martin et
al., 2010). As we have seen here, there is indeed a reduction in PAR initially.
Reductions up to 75% are seen in our results, but only at the most extreme
southern latitudes, lasting just a few months, varying seasonally. Figure 7 shows
the ratio of PAR in the GRB case versus the normal case at latitudes 75°S, 65°S,

Page 24 of 63

55°S, and 45°S. Combined with Figure 4, we can see that wide-spread reductions
in PAR are limited to a few percent over the first 250 days or so, with an increase
in PAR at most latitudes following that time, and an increase (or no change) at all
latitudes after about the first year. These results to do not allow us to draw firm
conclusions about climate change, since such changes must be evaluated in the
context of all atmospheric and irradiance changes associated with an astrophysical
ionizing radiation event. However, these results appear to make a global (or even
regional) cooling episode much less likely than was previously assumed.

3.2. Surface-level biological impacts

Our primary interest in this work is the impact of changes in surface-level
irradiance on the biosphere. To that end, we employed several built-in BWFs
included in the TUV model. These weighting functions quantify the effectiveness
of a range of wavelengths on certain biological processes, such as DNA damage,
photosynthesis, plant growth, or skin damage (erythema). All computations are
done for noon time irradiance at each location, under clear skies (no clouds).

The Setlow (1976) relative DNA damage weighting function is a commonly used
BWF; it was used in previous work discussed above (e.g., Thomas et al., 2005).
This BWF is included in TUV. The top panel of Figure 8 shows the ratio of

Page 25 of 63

irradiance weighted for DNA damage in the GRB case versus that in a normal
background case, for four years following the event, again restricted to a latitude
range from 5°N to 65°S. Note that there is more than a 5-fold increase compared
to a normal background level, across most of the latitude range of interest. The
value varies seasonally, as may also be seen in previous figures of, for instance,
UVB increase. This seasonal variation is due to seasonal changes in both O3
column density (see Figure 1) and solar zenith angle (with a smaller angle
resulting in greater irradiance).

Previous work in which this BWF was used presented results in terms of values
normalized by the annual global average under normal atmospheric conditions;
we present a similar result for this work in the middle panel of Figure 8. In
previous work (Thomas et al., 2005), the computed DNA damaging irradiance at
any given point was a maximum of about 15 times the global annual average; in
this work that maximum is about 11. A smaller value is not unexpected since
surface level UVB irradiance is somewhat smaller in this study (due to the more
complete radiative transfer modeling). Moreover, even this value is a
conservative maximum since it was calculated at noon for clear sky conditions.
Still, even with differences in computation technique and resulting differences in
surface level irradiance, the ratio of DNA damaging irradiance relative to the
global annual average in a normal atmosphere case is quite similar to previous

Page 26 of 63

results. This indicates a certain robustness in our previous results, despite the
simplified computational technique.

As in previous work, we again find that the greatest increase in DNA damaging
irradiance is located at mid-latitudes. However, one may note that the location in
latitude of the maximum increase does depend on which ratio we choose; the top
and middle panels of Figure 8 show the maximum values at somewhat different
latitudes, with the point-to-point ratio of the GRB case versus the normal case
showing a maximum at somewhat higher (Southern) latitudes than for the ratio of
the GRB case to the global annual average. As may be expected, we see recovery
occurring slowly over a few years, tracking the return of stratospheric O3 to
normal values (see Figure 1).

One quantity of interest to human populations when discussing ground-level UV
is the “UV Index” (WMO 1994). This index is intended to be a simple way to
communicate with the public the danger posed by UV radiation at any given time
and place. It is based primarily on a weighting function for damage to human
skin (erythema). The bottom panel of Figure 8 shows the UV Index as computed
by the TUV model for the GRB case. UV Index values of 11 and above indicate
“extreme risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure,” and people are
encouraged to take all precautions against sun exposure. As can be seen in the

Page 27 of 63

bottom panel of Figure 8, the UV Index values in our modeling reach up to 29 and
are indeed significantly greater than 11 for most of the region of interest. This
indicates a severe threat to human populations, in the form of sunburn and
increased risk of skin cancer, lasting several years (varying seasonally).

To quantify the risk to humans in more detail, we present in Figure 9 results for
irradiance weighted with BWFs for human erythema (Anders et al., 1995), skin
cancer (de Gruijl and van der Leun, 1994), non-melanoma skin cancer (CIE,
2006), and cataracts (using a pig model; Oriowo et al., 2001). This figure shows
the ratio of values for the GRB case to values for the normal atmosphere case.
Note first that each panel of this plot has a different maximum value; this allows
comparison of the time-space features of the increase in damage. Figure 10
shows ratio values at 45°S latitude, where most of the values shown are at a
maximum; this plot allows easier comparison of the range of ratio values for
different BWFs. Note that there is a rather wide range of ratio values, with the de
Gruijl and van der Leun (1994) skin cancer BWF yielding, at maximum, nearly an
order of magnitude greater increase in damaging exposure than that for nonmelanoma skin cancer and for cataracts.

One goal of this work was to evaluate the impact of ionizing radiation events on
primary productivity. This was motivated in part by an effort to understand how

Page 28 of 63

such events may have contributed to mass extinction events that are evident in the
fossil record (Melott et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2005; Melott and Thomas, 2009).
We presume that impacts on the base of the food chain would have major
consequences for overall biodiversity, potentially triggering, or at least
contributing to, extinction events. The TUV model includes several BWFs for
primary producers, including inhibition of carbon fixation in Antarctic
phytoplankton (Boucher et al., 1994), inhibition of photosynthesis in the diatom
Phaeodactylum sp. and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans (Cullen et al.,
1992), and inhibition of growth of higher plants (Flint and Caldwell, 2003a,b),
specifically oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Otana) seedlings. In Figure 11, we present
results of applying these BWFs, again as ratios of the computed result in the GRB
case to that under normal conditions; here again each panel has a different
maximum value allowing comparison of time-space features. Figure 12 shows
ratio values at 45°S latitude, where most of the values shown are at a maximum,
again allowing for easier comparison of the range of ratio values for different
BWFs. Here the range of ratio values is smaller than for the human-impact
results, with about a factor of 4 separating the maximum values for the most
different BWFs.

Some general features of these BWF results may be noted. We again find that the
greatest increase in damaging irradiance is located at mid-latitudes, with recovery

Page 29 of 63

occurring slowly over a few years, tracking the return of stratospheric O3 to
normal values. In the human-impact results, the greatest increase in damaging
irradiance is seen for the de Gruijl and van der Leun (1994) skin cancer BWF
with values ranging between approximately 3 and 12 times the normal
background values for the entire time period shown (about 4 years). Interestingly,
irradiance weighted non-melanoma skin cancer shows only a modest increase,
less than a factor of 2 at maximum.

In the primary productivity results there is a smaller difference between the
BWFs. The greatest increase in weighted irradiance occurs with the Boucher et
al. (1994) BWF for inhibition of carbon fixation in Antarctic phytoplankton, with
values ranging between about 2 and about 5 times the normal background values.
The smallest increase in weighted irradiance occurs for the two inhibition of
photosynthesis BWFs (Cullen et al., 1992), with greater increase for the diatom
Phaeodactylum sp., and a rather small (less than a factor of 2) increase for the
dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans. Interestingly, the second greatest increase in
weighted irradiance occurs for the Flint and Caldwell (2003a,b) BWF for
inhibition of growth in oat seedlings. This result is significant from the point of
view of human populations, since it indicates that a significant impact on food
crops is likely, lasting several seasons.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

We have presented results of improved and expanded modeling of the surfacelevel irradiance and subsequent biological impact of a GRB, which may also be
applied to other astrophysical ionizing radiation events. We find that previous
work overestimated the surface-level UVB irradiance by about a factor of 2;
however, values for the relative change in DNA damaging irradiance here are not
significantly smaller than those previously reported. This is an important result
that indicates previous studies are reliable, at least roughly, in evaluating the
potential biological impact of ionizing radiation events. The simpler approach
used in previous work is faster and easier to implement, so we conclude that it is
still useful, at least in giving a general sense of the magnitude of potential threats
to life on Earth (using relative DNA damage as a proxy).

Our surface-level irradiance results also have implications for suggestions in past
work (Melott et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2010) that the
climate could cool following the production of NO2 and accompanying reduction
in visible light. That work neglected the compensating effect of reduced O3,
which actually leads to a net increase in visible light (PAR) over the long term.
Net decreases in PAR are limited in area and duration, and hence it appears that

Page 31 of 63

climate cooling suggested in earlier work may be unlikely. We make no attempt
here to further examine potential climate changes, which are complicated and
affected by many factors related to atmospheric and irradiance changes. Any
conclusions about associated climate changes will require sophisticated modeling
that includes all atmospheric and irradiance changes following an ionizing
radiation event, which is well beyond the scope of this work.

Besides improving the modeling of surface-level irradiance, we also sought to
expand estimates of the biological consequences beyond simple DNA damage
estimates. The biologically weighted irradiance results presented in Section 3.2
show that the impact of O3 depletion following astrophysical ionizing radiation
events can be highly variable, even for similar biological measures (such as skin
cancer or productivity of marine phytoplankton), and significant increase in
weighted irradiance for one organism or for one particular type of biological
effect does not necessarily indicate a similar increase in weighted irradiance for
all biological effects. This complicates the question of whether a particular level
of O3 depletion will lead to widespread catastrophe for Earth’s biosphere. That
said, we may still conclude that biological damage would be widespread and
significant for many or most organisms. Extinction events always display a range
of impacts on different groups of organisms, with some being completely wiped

Page 32 of 63

out, others barely surviving, and still others emerging relatively unscathed
(Jablonski, 2005); our results exhibit this variability.

Importantly, our results also show that significant effects can occur at all levels of
organism-complexity; humans, higher plants, and phytoplankton all show a
significant increase in damage following O3 depletion. Previous work has
generally assumed that major O3 depletion would hit primary producers especially
hard, potentially leading to a collapse of the food web. These results support the
idea that primary producers would be significantly impacted, but that impact is
not uniform between various species. Additionally, we see significant impact on
higher-complexity organisms, indicating that a food-web collapse is not necessary
for there to be potential for extinction at higher trophic levels.

The variability of biological results motivates future use of yet more BWFs for
more organisms and other impacts. In addition, these results indicate that future
work should consider the broader ecological impact of irradiance changes. An
ecosystem is a complex network of interactions, and determining whether a mass
extinction would indeed result from a particular level of O3 depletion will require
examining biological damage in this context, as well as considering the
implications of potential climate change or other terrestrial changes following the
event.

Page 33 of 63

We are aware of two studies that sought to evaluate the potential ecosystem
impact of major ozone depletion events. Martin et al. (2010) considered
phytoplankton mortality following an increase of surface-level UV irradiance and
used the Comprehensive Aquatic Simulation Model (Amemiya et al., 2007) to
study the impact on a lake ecosystem. This study is limited, however, by
uncertainties and relative lack of data on the mortality caused by increased UV.
In addition, changes in PAR are not considered. A complication recognized by
Martin et al. (2010) is that the recovery of the atmosphere following an ionization
event involves deposition of nitrate. While there is some possibility for stress
caused by acidification, Melott et al. (2005) and Thomas and Honeyman (2008)
showed that the most likely result is actually an increase in primary productivity
due to the nitrate acting as a “fertilizer.” This complication has not been included
in any attempts to model ecosystem impacts.

Glassmeier et al. (2009) considered the effect of changes in surface-level UVB for
the case of increased cosmic ray flux (which also causes depletion of stratospheric
O3). They also used a model of aquatic phytoplankton population. Here, too,
changes in PAR are not considered; UVA changes are also omitted, and the
impact of UVB is based solely on whether the irradiance passes a threshold for
inhibition of photosynthesis.

Page 34 of 63

While both of these studies are limited, they represent a starting point for
evaluating the broader ecological impact of ionizing radiation events. A
conclusion of both studies is that attenuation of light in the water column,
especially due to the presence of dissolved organic matter, plays an important role
in the overall impact on a phytoplankton community. Results presented here are
all surface-level; future work will consider the transmission of light into the water
column and the integrated effect on primary productivity in the oceans for some
important phytoplankton species, providing further information on how the base
of the food web may be impacted.

Overall, our results confirm that major biological impacts would be associated
with severe O3 depletion following an astrophysical ionizing radiation event.
Importantly, we find that such impacts are variable across different organisms and
effects considered. In addition, we find that the entire UVB, UVA, and PAR
regions of the spectrum should be included in computing biological effects.
Future work in this area should include more measures of biological impacts, with
the ultimate goal of understanding the broader ecological impact.
