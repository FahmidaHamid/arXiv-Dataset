Transitions in the qualitative behavior of chemical reaction dynamics with a decrease in molecule
number have attracted much attention. Here, a method based on a Markov process with a tridiagonal
transition matrix is applied to the analysis of this transition in reaction dynamics. The transition to
bistability due to the small-number effect and the mean switching time between the bistable states
are analytically calculated in agreement with numerical simulations. In addition, a novel transition
involving the reversal of the chemical reaction flow is found in the model under an external flow,
and also in a three-component model. The generality of this transition and its correspondence to
biological phenomena are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Temporal changes in chemical concentrations are often analyzed by using the rate equation of the reaction kinetics in which a set of deterministic ordinary
differential equations is adopted. Fluctuation around
the average change in the concentration is neglected by
assuming that the total number of molecules is sufficiently large; however, stochasticity in the reaction due
to fluctuation in the number of reactants does exist,
and it is non-negligible, especially when the number of
molecules is small. Such stochasticity can introduce a
qualitative change in the behavior of the reaction dynamics. The fluctuation around the average behavior is
typically analyzed using the linear noise approximation
(LNA) [1], which is represented by the Langevin equation with additive noise or the corresponding Fokker–
Planck equation derived from van Kampen’s system-size
expansion [1, 2]. Recently, several theoretical studies
have reported “small-number effects” or “discretenessinduced transitions” that lead to a qualitative deviation
from the behavior expected by the LNA, due to the small
number of components; these effects have been reported
in catalytic reaction dynamics [3–11], reaction-diffusion
systems [12–14], gene regulatory circuits [15], and ecology [16, 17].
One remarkable example of a discreteness-induced
transition, the emergence of multi-stability, was reported
by Togashi and Kaneko [3]. In their investigation of a catalytic chemical reaction system composed of four chemical species, it was revealed that when the total number of
molecules is small, the system exhibits temporal switching between quasi-steady states in which only two chemical species are abundant and the others are extinct. The
model was then simplified into two components and has

been analyzed [4, 5, 17], but the small-number regime
requires further mathematical analysis.
In this paper, we apply a method based on a Markov
process with a tridiagonal transition matrix in order to
analyze the small-number effect in chemical reactions, as
well as investigate a novel type of discreteness-induced
transition in chemical current.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II,
we demonstrate the validity of the method in an analysis of the two-component Togashi–Kaneko (2TK) model,
and then, in Sec. III, introduce a 3-component model
that exhibits a novel discreteness-induced transition: the
current of the chemical reaction reverses when the total
number of molecules becomes small. By applying both
the method proposed here and the Fokker–Planck equation, the transition caused by a decrease in the number of
molecules is explained with quantitative agreement with
numerical simulations. In Sec. IV, we show that the
2-component Togashi-Kaneko model under external flow
also exhibits the reversal of chemical current. In Sec. V,
we give concluding remarks.
II. ANALYSIS OF TWO-COMPONENT
TOGASHI–KANEKO (2TK) MODEL

The 2TK model [4, 17] consists of the following four
chemical reactions involving the two chemicals A and B:
A+B −
→ 2A,

A+B −
→ 2B,
k

A ⇆ B,

(1)

u

where k, u, and v are the rate constants of the reactions.
Note that the total number of molecules, denoted by N ,
is conserved in this model. Without loss of generality, we
can set k = 1 by rescaling the time scale and set u/k → u
and v/k → v. By denoting the number of molecules of A
and B as i and N − i, respectively, the model can then be
defined in the state space i = 0, 1, . . . N . The transition
rates from state i to i + 1 and from i to i − 1 are given by
λi = i(N −i)/N +v(N −i) and µi = i(N −i)/N +ui, where

where δij is the Kronecker delta. Noting that the boundary conditions are µN = 0 and tN,j = 0 for j = 0, . . . N ,

the volume of the system is set to be N . Examples of the
time series of i/N for u = v = 0.01, obtained numerically
using the Gillespie algorithm [18], are shown in Fig. 1(a).
Although the result for large N (N = 2000), shown by
the black line, converges to the fixed-point concentration
i/N = v/(u + v) predicted by the rate equation, switching behavior between i/N = 0 and i/N = 1 emerges for
small N (N = 50), as shown by the blue line. Correspondingly, the steady state distribution of i/N shows a
transition from a unimodal distribution (N = 2000) to a
bimodal distribution (N = 50), as shown in Fig. 1-(b).
The emergence of this switching behavior is an example
of a discreteness-induced transition [3] or noise-induced
bistability [17]. Previous studies [5, 17] give an analytical
calculation of the steady state distribution and the critical value of N for the appearance of switching behavior
to be Nc ≃ 1/u for the case v = u. It is especially noteworthy that this model is similar to the two-allele Moran
model with mutation in population genetics; The Moran
process describes the neutral evolution of a population
under a fixed population size; an individual agent is randomly replaced by another in each generation. The 2TK
model is almost equivalent to the two-allele Moran model
with bidirectional mutation. The difference lies in the use
of continuous and discrete time. Indeed, with a decrease
in N , the Moran model is known to show a transition
from a state with two coexisting alleles to a state with
alternate fixation of only one of the two alleles [19, 20].
This corresponds to the switching behavior of the 2TK
model. In addition, both the critical value of N and
the steady-state distribution calculated using the Moran
model coincide with those of the 2TK model [4, 17].
Although an analysis based on the Fokker–Planck
equation is often adopted for chemical reaction systems,
in general, it is not applicable when N is small, the
case in which we are interested. When the system in
question is described by a single-variable Markov process with a tridiagonal transition matrix, one can analytically obtain basic characteristic quantities. To illustrate
this point, we estimate the mean switching time from
state i = 0 to state i = N . Similar treatments have
been adopted in population genetics [19], as well as in
physics [1]. Setting i = 0 as the initial condition and
i = N as the final absorbing state, the chemical reaction
system in Eq. (1) is described by the master equation:
Ṗi = λi−1 Pi−1 + µi+1 Pi+1 − (λi + µi )Pi with the boundary conditions µ0 = µN = 0 and λN = 0, where Pi
represents the probability of the state i at time t. We
consider the occupancy time tij , that is, the mean time
spent in state j starting from
R ∞ state i before absorption,
which is defined by tij ≡ 0 dtPi . By integrating the
master equation with respect to time t from t = 0 to ∞,
we obtain

N ≤ 1/u, where switching behavior appears. For the region
with N > 1/u, T0 increases drastically as N increases,
because i/N stays at around 0.5 for the majority of the time
(as shown in (a)) and, accordingly, a significantly longer
time period is required for i/N = 0 or 1 to be realized.

agree well with the results obtained from numerical simulations. Note that Biancalani et al. [17] calculated the
mean switching time using the Fokker–Planck equation
for large N and estimated the corresponding value for
small N in a heuristic manner. Our treatment, in contrast, gives a single expression, Eq. (3), that shows remarkable agreement for all N . It should be emphasized
here that the expressions in Eqs. (2) and (3) are not limited to this specific model but are generally applicable to
any λi and µi .

section. In both cases, the chemical current exists due
to breaking of the detailed balance and its reversal occurs as a novel discreteness-induced transition. On one
hand, these two examples demonstrate the general validity of our method while, on the other hand, they exhibit
novel transitions by the small-number effect, beyond the
emergence of the bistability discussed thus far.

net current J is given by the slope of this time series. Larger
fluctuation in the slope is observed for smaller N , which
indicates that the net current is reversed in a stochastic
manner.

III. THREE-COMPONENT MODEL AND
REVERSAL OF CHEMICAL CURRENT

Provided a given chemical reaction system is described
by a single-variable Markov process with a tridiagonal
transition matrix, we can rigorously apply the present
analytical formulation. The present formulation is also
applicable to a multi-variable Markov process as an
approximation, if one can properly project the multivariable case onto a single variable Markov process. Now,
we demonstrate that this approximation is indeed valid
when the number of molecules is small and discretenessinduced transition occurs. As examples, we introduce
here a 3-component model with autocatalytic reaction

(7)
where c = N − a − b, and Pst (a, b, c) is the probability
of state (a, b, c) in the steady state; Jb→c and Jc→a are
given in a similar fashion. The net current J for the rate
equation in Eq. (6) is calculated as J = kc /3 − u, where
Pst (a, b, c) is given by the δ-function at the fixed-point
solution x = y = z = 1/3.
Although the rate equation in Eq. (6) predicts a stationary clockwise current J > 0 for kc > 3u, the numerical simulation gives a counterclockwise current J < 0
when the total number of molecules N is small. As shown
in Fig. 2(b)-(e), the net current J decreases with decreasing N and becomes negative. Hence, the small-number
effect leads to a reversal of the net current of the chemical reaction. Fluctuation in the total current, shown in

where T(xy|x′y′ ) is obtained from Eq. (5) by letting x =

Myy = N −1 [(kc x + u)(1 − x) + 2y(1 − y)] ,
Mxy = N −1 [−uy − kc x(1 − x − y) − 2xy] .

(10)

Here, the stationary solution of Eq. (9) cannot be obtained analytically, since the transition rates do not
satisfy the detailed balance condition. As an analytical estimate, we approximate the stationary solution of
Eq. (9) by a Gaussian distribution of mean (mx , my )
and  variance-covariance
matrix Σ, as P0 (x, y) ∝

exp −vΣ−1 v/2 , where v = (x−mx , y−my ). Under this
approximation, mx , my , the variances Vx and Vy , and
the covariance Vxy are obtained as mx = my = 1/3, Vx =
Vy = −2Vxy = 2(2 + kc + 3u)/9(2 + kc + kc N + 3uN ).
Note that this Gaussian approximation is invalid when
Vx or Vy are large because the estimated probability
distribution Pst (x, y) then extends beyond the domain
Ω(x, y|0 ≤ x + y ≤ 1, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). Thus, Vx ≤ m2x
is a necessary condition for the validity of the Gaussian
approximation.

Fig. 2-(e), indicates that the net current becomes negative in a stochastic manner, which is analogous to the fact
that bimodal steady state distribution induced by the
small-number effect in 2TK model appears in a stochastic manner. Note that, although J = 0 is satisfied if the
detailed balance condition is satisfied, the opposite is not
true; the detailed balance is not necessarily satisfied at
the point J = 0, because J is defined by the average
value for all (a, b, c). We analyze this transition by using
both the Fokker–Planck equation derived from the master equation for large N and the proposed method for
small N . The master equation of this model is expressed
as

FIG. 3: Phase diagrams of the 3-component model in the
(a),(b) N -kc plane and (c),(d) N -u plane. White and shaded
regions represent positive and negative J (clockwise and
counterclockwise current), respectively, as determined by the
simulations. Thick red and blue lines indicate the theoretical
results from Eq. (11) and Eq. (13), respectively, while the
dotted lines indicate the results for which the validity
condition for the theoretical estimate is not satisfied.

The second term in this equation is a result of replacing the probability mass of P0 (x, y) outside of Ω with a
probability of states with (x, y) = (1, 0), (0, 1), or (0, 0).
Hence a negative current is predicted, especially when a
large amount probability mass is outside of the Ω domain
due to a large Vx and Vy . As shown in Fig. 2(b), (c), and
(d), the current J calculated using Eq. (11) agrees rather
well with the numerical results, as long as Vx ≤ m2x holds.
As is seen in Fig. 2 (b)-(d), the invalid region of Eq. (11)
also predicts a negative current. This is attributed to the
second term of Eq. (11); the probability mass of P0 (x, y)
outside Ω is regarded as the state (x, y) = (1, 0), (0, 1),
or (0, 0), and thus the current can be negative.
For small N , the variance is much larger, and so the
Fokker–Planck equation is no longer valid. The proposed
method, however, is applicable. In contrast to the case
with the 2TK model, the 3-component model has two degrees of freedom, and thus the relationship in Eq. (2) cannot be applied straightforwardly. Nevertheless, we can
apply Eq. (2) by focusing only on a relatively short time
scale within which the process can be approximated as
a single-variable Markov process. In the present model,
autocatalytic reactions (e.g., A + C → 2A/2C) tend to
push the system into a state in which only a single type
of molecule dominates, while the other reactions promote
the coexistence of the three molecular species. Therefore,
the model can be regarded as a molecule (e.g., A or C) extinction process if the autocatalytic reactions dominate.
Let us assume that only A molecules exist in the initial
condition and that the system transits from (a, b, c) =
(N, 0, 0) to (a, b, c) = (N − 1, 0, 1) by the reaction A → C
at t = 0. If u is sufficiently small, one can assume that

This estimate is valid only when the time until absorpPN −1
tion, TN −1 = j=1 tN −1,j , is smaller than 1/N u. The
current J, shown by the blue lines in Fig. 2(b), (c), and
(d), agrees rather well with the numerical results when
TN −1 < 1/N u holds.
Figure 3 shows phase diagrams of the regime for clockwise or counterclockwise currents. The phase boundary
is calculated based on J = 0. For small N , it is estimated
from the solution of the equation: 2α1−N + kc N − 2α =
0 [21], while for large N , the boundary is estimated from
Eq. (11) with J = 0. Both the estimated boundaries
agree well with the simulation. Figure 3 (c) and (d)
clearly show that the phase boundary is independent of
u provided TN −1 < 1/N u holds.
Here, we demonstrate that the discreteness in molecular number can induce a reversal of chemical current. In
contrast to the small-number effect in the steady state
distribution (e.g. emergence of bistability as shown in
Fig. 1-(b)), the reversal of chemical current is a characteristic small-number effect to a innately non-equilibrium
system. This phenomenon can emerge for a relatively
large N , as is seen in Fig. 2-(d), which does not require
an absolute small-number, such as 0, 1 or 2.

to approximate the behavior of the model by a singlevariable Markov process with the transition probabilities

2TK MODEL WITH EXTERNAL FLOW

Reversal of flow by smallness in molecule number in
the last section is a novel discovery, but a set of reactions

involved therein may be a bit complicated to be realized.
In this section, we show generality of such discretenessinduced reversal, by taking a two-component autocatalytic reaction system under external flow. To be specific,
we extend the 2TK model under external flow so that the
total number of molecules is not conserved, to demonstrate both the applicability of our analytic method and
generality of the reversal phenomena. As shown in Fig. 4(a), this model is composed of two chemicals, A and B,
and the following 8 reactions:

The major difference between the 2TK model with and
without external flow is that the former model has a
chemical reaction flow J from A to B as calculated by
J = (k1 − k2 )a∗ b∗ + u1 b∗ − u∗2 a, in which a∗ and b∗ represent the steady state solutions of the above equations,
while in the 2TK model without external flow, J is always zero.
Similar to the 3-component model that we proposed,
this 2TK model under external flow shows significant deviation from the chemical reaction current estimated by
the rate equation, when the system size V becomes small.
Specifically, a reversal of the chemical reaction flow is observed for small V , when (k1 − k2 )a∗ b∗ + u1 b∗ − u2 a∗ and
(u1 b∗ − u2 a∗ ) have different signs. Figure 4-(b) shows an
example of the reversal of J against the change in V .
The 2TK model under external flow satisfies neither
the requirement of conservation of the total number of
molecules nor cyclic symmetry, as is the case in the 3component model. Therefore, it is difficult to describe
the chemical reaction current as a successive fixation of
one of the chemical species, as was accepted for the 3component model analysis. Here, we apply an alternative approach to mapping from the two-variable Markov
process to a one-variable Markov process. Recalling that
the rate of change in transition probability following the
n+
)/Tnn+ ) is negapplication of n → n±1 (e.g., (Tnn+ −Tn±1
ligible when n is large, we assume that Pn±1,m ∼ Pn,m for
n > m and Pn,m±1 ∼ Pn,m for n ≤ m. We also assume
that d, the reaction rate for φ → A and φ → B, is sufficiently small. With these assumptions, the two-variable
master equation is reduced to a one-variable master equation, such that
Ṗn,m = λn−1 Pn−1,m+1 − λn Pn,m + µn+1 Pn+1,m−1 − µn P(18)

The reduced model given in Eq. (18) indicates that the
total number of molecules is conserved as N = n + m
and, thus, m can be expressed as m = N − n. By Ṗn,m =
0, the steady state distribution of Pn,m with boundary

where ρ(N ) is the probability of n + m = N . Equation.(16) indicates that the transition probability of N →

that ρ(N ) is the Poisson distribution ρ(N ) = e−Λ ΛN /N !,

and the estimated J is shown in Fig. 4-(b). Note, however, that this approximation is only valid for sufficiently
small d.
Here, we have shown that the change in chemical reaction flow due to the small-number effect generally occurs
in the presence of the reaction A + B → 2A/2B. For
some parameter values, the current of chemical reaction
B → A is even reversed with the decrease in molecule
number.

DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have investigated small-number effects in chemical reactions using a method based on a
single-variable Markov process. After analyzing the 2TK
model, we have analyzed the 3-component model and a
two component model under external flow in order to
demonstrate a novel type of small-number effect, i.e., the
reversal of the reaction current. This reversal is first
reported here and demonstrates a small-number effect
in a non-equilibrium system. The 3-component model
here consists of homogeneous cyclic reactions, but extensions to chain-like reactions and systems with inhomogeneous reaction coefficients [6] are straightforward. In the
case of chain-like reactions, the dominant molecule in the
steady state may change depending on N because the direction of the reaction current may change. Although the
proposed 3-component model includes relatively complex
chemical reactions, the reversal in reaction current is not
specific to this model. Indeed, in Sec.IV, we have shown
that a simple autocatalytic reaction set can also exhibit
the reversal of chemical current.
The emergence of multi-stability induced by the smallnumber effect in a real biological system has been found
and has attracted much interest [15, 22–24], with most of
the chemical reaction systems examined in those studies
having autocatalytic reactions. As autocatalytic reactions can potentially show the reversal in chemical current, the reversal (or, at least, change) in chemical current we proposed here will be observed in these biological systems also, and provides a novel mechanism of
controlling the reaction process based on the number of
molecules within the system, rather than their concentration.
