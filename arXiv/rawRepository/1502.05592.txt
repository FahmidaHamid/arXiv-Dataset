We present a dual optimization concept of predicting optimal sequences as well as optimal
folds of off-lattice protein models in the context of multi-scale modeling. We validate the utility
of the recently introduced hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization algorithm by finding
significantly lower energy folds for minimalist and detailed protein models than previously
reported. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest energy fold amongst all
sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture. In particular, for protein models with a
binary sequence, we show that the sequence-optimized folds form more compact cores than the
lowest energy folds of the historically fixed, Fibonacci-series sequences of chain lengths of 13, 21,
34, 55, and 89. We then extend our search algorithm to use UNRES, one of the leading unitedresidue protein force fields. Our combined fold and sequence optimization on three test proteins
reveal an inherent bias in UNRES favoring alpha helical structures even when secondary structure
prediction clearly suggests only beta sheets besides random coil, and virtually no helices. One test
in particular, a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain, demonstrates that by
permutations of its sequence UNRES re-folds this structure into a perfect alpha helix but, in fact,
the helix is just an artefact of the force field, the structure quickly unfolds in all-atom state-of-theart molecular dynamics simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
We recently introduced the hidden-force algorithm (HFA), a global Monte Carlo
optimization method and used it to predict low-energy binary Lennard-Jones (BLJ) cluster
configurations [1]. In this communication, we apply HFA to find the optimal fold of simple and
detailed protein models. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest energy
fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture. In particular, we study
protein AB (PAB) models [2, 3]. These have close similarity to BLJ models. Despite their
minimalism, PAB models mimic a basic feature of protein folding—the formation of a
hydrophobic core. Similar to BLJ models PAB models consist of only two types of residues,
denoted A and B. The interaction energy between two A residues (AA interaction) is twice as
strong as AB or BB interactions to promote core formation. The interaction potential has a pseudo
Lennard-Jones form and the total potential energy includes angle-bending and torsion terms to
account for local interactions. Historically, PAB models use a Fibonacci series sequence protein
with chain lengths of 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89 [4, 5]. At first, we revisit the Fibonacci sequences and
find that much lower energy folds exist than previously reported. Moreover, the new putative
global minima show topological features qualitatively different from real proteins. The new lowenergy folds are deeply knotted indicative of a flaw in the PAB model. Simplifying the local
interaction terms introduced to extend the PAB model to three dimensions [3], we obtain new
realistic low-energy folds without knots. Using this simplified potential we use HFA optimization
to find non-Fibonacci sequences that fold into still lower energy structures with more compact
cores comprised of A residues.
We then apply HFA optimization to six test proteins using UNRES, one of the leading
united-residue force fields [6, 7, 8] that has been highly successful in the past fifteen years of
CASP competition (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction [9]) [10]. First, as a
validation of HFA on this sophisticated two-bead model, we compare our global minima to those
found by UNRES/CSA [11] and for five out of the six proteins find lower energy folds. We also
find, however, that these new global minima all represent slightly unfolded structures, which is
indicative of a flaw in the force field and/or a flaw in the concept of locating the global minimum
of a potential energy function as a means to identify the global minimum free-energy
2

structure/fold. Furthermore, we probe the UNRES force field by once again applying sequence
optimization in order to find sequences that fold into still lower energy structures, and find that
UNRES has a strong tendency to fold sequences into alpha helices. One test in particular, a WW
domain (1E0L), which is the smallest monomeric triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein
domain, demonstrates that by permutations of its sequence HFA/UNRES re-folds this structure
into a perfect alpha helix.

II. MODEL AND ALGORITHMIC DETAILS
PAB models are one of the minimalist protein models [12]. We used the model by Irbäck
et. al [3], a well-studied three-dimensional extension of the original two-dimensional PAB model
by Stillinger et. al [2]. In this model proteins consist of two types of residues, A and B. Each
residue represents a Cα atom. The Cα–Cα bonds are set to unit length and the potential energy is:

Eq. 1

The first two sums represent local interactions as angle-bending or torsion energies,
involving three or four consecutive Cα atoms, respectively. The last double sum is a pseudo
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential representing long-range interactions. N is the number of residues, rij
is the distance between two residues, ε(σi, σj) is the residue pair-specific LJ well-minimum depth,
and κ1 and κ2 are empirical parameters determined by Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce
qualitatively Cα angle and torsion distributions of proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3].
We used κ1 = -1 and κ2 = 0.5. ε(σi, σj) favor the formation of a core of A residues analogous to the
hydrophobic core of real proteins: ε(A, A) = 1 and ε(A, B) = ε(B, B) = 0.5. LJ interactions between
adjacent residues are excluded. In lieu of constraints we add strong harmonic distance terms to
keep Cα–Cα bond lengths at unity and flat-bottom angle-bending terms to disallow near linear Cα–
Cα–Cα bond angles (within two degrees). Linear bond angles cause a catastrophic physical
divergence in the torsion term of the PAB model.
The UNRES model is a sophisticated two-bead representation of the polypeptide chain.
Each amino acid residue is represented by two interaction centers, one is the halfway point between
3

two consecutive Cα atoms (the Cα atoms themselves serve only as geometric reference points),
and the other interaction center is the center of mass of the side chain that is modeled as an ellipsoid
with two rotational degrees of freedom with respect to the backbone. Backbone flexibility itself is
allowed by varying virtual-bond angles and virtual-bond dihedral angles along three or four Cα
atoms, respectively. The UNRES force field includes numerous bonded and non-bonded terms as
well as implicit contributions from the interaction of the side chain with the solvent [6, 7, 8] and
has been parameterized utilizing the so-called hierarchical design of the potential-energy landscape
employing multiple training proteins simultaneously [13].
The hidden-force algorithm [1] exploits that, though the gradient components of an additive
potential sum to zero at a local minimum, each component’s magnitude is generally nonzero.
Disrupting this network of opposing forces (negative of the gradient) can result in the collective
rearrangement of cluster atoms. Using a tug-of-war analogy to describe the basic HFA move, some
players (atoms) simultaneously drop their ropes (drop their contributions to the potential). The
remaining players then rearrange due to their net nonzero tugging and reach a partial impasse.
Then the dropouts resume tugging until a new total impasse is achieved. There is no guarantee
that the resulting cluster configuration will be lower in energy than the starting configuration, but
we found HFA to be an exceptionally successful move set in a Monte Carlo cluster minimization.
HFA trial configurations are highly dependent on the starting configurations since the moves are
driven by forces already present—making the HFA Monte Carlo search non-Markovian.
Algorithmically, PAB models can be treated similar to BLJ clusters with slightly different
LJ terms and additional geometric constraints favoring protein like chains. We used the same
algorithm and software described in detail in [1] with two notable differences: (1) when the basic
HFA move is applied to a given local minimum-energy configuration, only the pseudo LJ terms
are dropped; the remaining terms stay in effect to preserve the chain geometry. (2) Single or
multiple mutations are utilized by swapping the types of randomly selected residues rather than
flipping the type of a single residue at a time, in order to keep the composition fixed while varying
the sequence. A BLJ cluster of fixed size is fully determined by its A/B composition, but PAB
models also depend on the sequence of the residues. Therefore, while swapping A and B particles
in a BLJ cluster will not change its identity, swapping A and B residues in a PAB protein will be
a mutation. Further, in [1], we found the optimal A/B composition of a BLJ cluster of fixed size
with lowest energy. For PAB models, the optimal A/B composition is trivial, a sequence of all A
4

residues (AA interactions are stronger than AB or BB interactions). The more interesting and
challenging mutation study we carry out keeps the A/B composition fixed and optimizes over
sequences to find the lowest energy fold.
Employment of the UNRES model requires further significant but straightforward changes
in the HFA algorithm with respect to how it is utilized with PAB models. (1) When the basic
HFA move is applied, instead of simply dropping the non-bonded interactions, the selected residue
is temporarily mutated into GLY, and it keeps all of its interactions. (2) Since UNRES is a twobead model, every local minimization step is combined with side chain optimization along the full
length of the polypeptide chain. Moreover, akin to the PAB studies we mutate the UNRES models
by swapping one or more pairs of residues keeping the overall residue composition fixed and
optimize over sequences to find the lowest energy fold. It should be noted, however, that while
such residue swaps readily allow direct comparison of the energies of different sequence mutants
in the minimal PAB model, this is not trivial with UNRES. Similar to all-atom molecular
mechanics force fields, UNRES energy is not absolute and, therefore, energies of two different
molecules are generally not comparable. Nonetheless, when comparing the energies of two
different peptides with the same residue composition, but subject to single or multiple residue
swaps and altogether having different residue sequences, is an exception. The energies of such
peptides (we shall call them permutation isomers) are indeed comparable in any molecular
mechanics force field including UNRES devoid of sequence dependent terms. UNRES does have
the built-in capability of employing sequence dependent terms, but the current parameterization
omits them.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To test HFA against existing optimization methods for PAB models, we run HFA searches
on Fibonacci sequences in Table I and compare our putative global minimum-energy folds with
those found in [4, 5]. Table I clearly demonstrates that HFA Monte Carlo search is efficient
searching the fold space of PAB models. The difference in energy does not carry information
about structural differences, though. Direct comparison was, unfortunately, not possible because
the coordinates of the structures reported in [4, 5] were not published. Nonetheless, based on the
visualizations in [4, 5], FIG. 1 clearly shows that our new minima belong to a different topological
5

class indicative of a flaw in PAB models. With the exception of S_13, which is simply too short
and S_21 that forms a simple trefoil knot (one end of the chain folding back through a loop), every
other fold is deeply knotted (coordinates are listed in the Supplementary Material). Knotted
protein structures occur naturally [14, 15], however, this level of knot formation cannot be found
in the PDB [16]. With κ1 = -1 and κ2 = 0.5 [3], the simple cosine terms favor a 180 degree bond
angle and a zero degree torsion angle. In real proteins, the bond angle distribution has a welldefined structure and bond angles strictly fall within the range of 85-145 degrees [3]. Torsion
angles, on the other hand, are more uniform; there are no disallowed values. Nevertheless, zero
degree torsion angles are rare. Eq. 1 represents an additive potential and even though the PAB
models will always be frustrated in three dimensions, we can expect that at or close to the global
minimum many individual energy terms will be close to their minimum values. This is exactly
what we can see in FIG. 1; numerous bond angles are close to 180 degrees (kept away from exact
linearity by the flat bottom angle-bending term) and numerous torsion angles are very close to zero
degrees. This is the geometrical basis for forming knots in the ground sate, never seen in real
proteins.

Ideally, more sophisticated potentials should be derived from the actual Cα bond angles
and torsion angles found in the PDB via, e.g., the Boltzmann inversion method [12]. Keeping with
the minimalist spirit of PAB models, however, we drop the angle-bending and torsion terms
altogether, but we add a flat-bottom harmonic angle term that disallows Cα–Cα–Cα angles outside
the 85-145 degree range. Using this potential we find that the Fibonacci sequences fold into
globular structures with no tendency to form knots, and with a “hydrophobic” core. We then
carried out sequence optimization using this potential. The left hand side of FIG. 2 shows the
putative global minima found for the five Fibonacci sequences and the right hand side shows the
lowest energy folds after sequence mutations were applied to the Fibonacci sequences (coordinates

model yields compact folds with a clear core and no knots. The cores are more compact in the
mutated sequences, which is quantified in Table II by the radius of gyration of the core (type A)
residues. Table II also lists the energy drop after sequence optimization with respect to the putative
global minimum energy of the Fibonacci sequence.

To further test HFA against UNRES’ native conformational space annealing (CSA) [11]
global-optimization method, we run HFA searches on six test proteins (1BDD, 1GAB, 1LQ7,
1CLB, 1E0G, and 1IGD) that were essential in parameterizing UNRES. Among the force field
options in UNRES we employ 4P (parameterized using four training proteins simultaneously) that
is most adequate for small proteins of any fold including alpha, beta, and alpha/beta [13, 17]. Table
III demonstrates that HFA Monte Carlo search is also efficient searching the fold space of
sophisticated UNRES models. Similar to the PAB study, the difference in energy itself does not
carry information about structural differences and direct comparison was, unfortunately, not
possible because the coordinates of the structures reported in [18] were not published with the
exception of 1IGD for which the complete CSA results are available in the UNRES download kit
[19]. Nevertheless, the results point to noteworthy anomalies. Similar energies and similar RMS
distances found with 1BDD, 1CLB, and 1E0G suggest that CSA and HFA searches located the
same ground state folds for these chains. Moreover one could even argue that since the HFA
ground state for 1GAB is significantly lower in energy than the lowest lying CSA structure and at
the same time the HFA fold is 0.3 Å closer to the experimental structure in C-alpha RMS distance
than the CSA minimum; lowering the energy might have the general effect of actually getting
closer to the native structure, and thereby providing strong support for the force field. However,
the two remaining proteins in Table III crush such hopes. HFA generated a fold for 1LQ7 that has
virtually the same energy as the CSA ground state, yet the HFA fold is more than 4 Å farther away
from the experimental structure than the quite accurate CSA minimum. 1IGD yields an even more
negative result where the HFA ground state is, again, over 4 Å farther away than the CSA
minimum, but the HFA fold has significantly (11 kcal/mol) lower energy. The C-alpha RMS
distance between the CSA and HFA folds is 8.8 Å and visual inspection clearly shows that in the
HFA ground state the alpha helix and both antiparallel beta strands start to unfold. The C-alpha

We conclude our UNRES tests with running HFA sequence optimization on three proteins
to learn more about the force field. We choose a pure alpha protein 1BDD, a mixed alpha/beta
protein 1IGD, and a pure beta mini protein 1E0L (28 residues), which is the smallest monomeric
triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain. We want to see if sequence optimization
can provide stable folds lower in energy than those of the native sequence/fold and whether we
can draw any general conclusions about UNRES in this regard as we do with the modified PAB
model above. Sequence optimization involves periodically swapping pairs of residues followed
by HFA fold search and thereby exploring the sequence space of permutation isomers. As noted
above, UNRES energy is not absolute but energies of permutation isomers are readily comparable.
11

FIG. 3, FIG. 4, and FIG. 5 give vivid visual insight and to put it bluntly; everything folds into a
helix. The left hand side of the figures show the HFA ground state structure of the native sequence
(rainbow colors from red N-terminus to purple C-terminus) superposed on the experimental
structure shown in gray and the right hand side presents the result of sequence optimization. The
figures also include the native sequence vs. optimized sequence and the associated energy drop.
The evident qualitative statement that can be drawn from the figures is that sequence optimization
re-folds all three native structures into helical structures with significant energy stabilization.
Moreover, as shown by explicit tube representation, PRO residues are either pushed out the termini
or break the alpha helices in the interior of the chain as generally seen in real protein structures,
and GLY residues tend to shift to flexible coil segments. One would of course be tempted to draw
physical conjectures based on the sequence optimization data, but further analysis makes it clear
that folding into these predominantly alpha helical structures is, in fact, just a serious artefact of
the UNRES force field. We provide two types of evidence.

First, secondary structure prediction performed on the optimized sequences by multiple
trusted web servers [20] provides no evidence for helical segments in either the 1IGD or the 1E0L
ground state permutation isomers; the predictions are all beta and random coils (except for a tiny
alpha contribution in 1IGD). Not surprisingly, however, 1BDD itself being an all-alpha protein,
retains its alpha character after sequence optimization. Second, the extreme case of 1E0L where
sequence optimization results in re-folding a pure triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet into a pure
alpha helical structure, pleads for more accurate calculations. Here we employ multi-scale
modeling by (i) generating the full backbone structure from the C-alpha coordinates [21], (ii)
applying highly accurate side chain prediction using SCWRL4 [22], and finally (iii) running allatom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with explicit solvent. We carry out the MD simulation
with Desmond [23] running on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 graphics processor and using a
simulation protocol that has proven highly successful in folding numerous small proteins [24].
The length of the MD simulation is 150 ns and the MPEG video file (70 MB) is available upon
request. The trajectory provides vivid graphical evidence that the all-alpha UNRES ground-state
sequence-permutation isomer of 1E0L is not stable at all, it entirely unfolds in less than 10 ns and
remains in a highly volatile, flexible and somewhat U-shaped random coil configuration for the
rest of the simulation.

IV. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVE
In this communication, we propose a dual concept for the global optimization of off-lattice
protein models predicting optimal sequences as well as optimal folds and embed our approach in
multi-scale modeling. Using hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization we find the optimal fold of
simple and detailed protein models. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the
lowest energy fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture. We then
generate an all-atom model and run state-of-the-art MD simulation. In particular, we find that with
a simplified potential, binary protein AB models fold into globular, compact structures with no
tendency to form knots, and with a “hydrophobic” core. Historically, these models use a Fibonacci
series sequence protein with chain lengths of 13, 21, 34, 55, and 89. We show that sequence
optimization yields non-Fibonacci sequences that fold into still lower energy structures with more
compact cores than the original Fibonacci sequences. We extend our investigation to study real
proteins using the sophisticated UNRES model and find via sequence optimization and all-atom
MD simulation that UNRES inherently favors helical structures.

14

We demonstrate that our methodology is applicable to detailed protein models, fits well
within multi-scale modeling, and ultimately may aid de novo protein design by yielding novel
folds. However, we also demonstrate that further improvements in force fields are needed before
sequence optimization could become a reliable tool for proteins in general, and for the moment
our research focus stays within the realm of all-alpha proteins, studying sequences that afford
stable folds—whether native or non-native.

The sequence is identified by the residue type A or B in the first
column. Energies are absolute energies in epsilon units. The first 5
models were computed with the potential in Eq. 1. The other 5 models were
computed with the simplified potential including the pseudo Lennard-Jones
potential, the bond length restraint and the flat-bottom angle bending
constraint to keep the Calpha-Calpha-Calpha bond angles within the 85-145
degree range. The UNRES protein models below are represented by their Calpha atoms listed in PDB format. The energy is UNRES/4P.
