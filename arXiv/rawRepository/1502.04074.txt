We extend the theory of quasipotentials in dynamical systems by calculating an exact potential
for the critical fluctuations of pitchfork bifurcations of period-doubling maps in the weak noise
limit. These far-from-equilibrium fluctuations are described by finite-size mean field theory, placing
their static properties in the same universality class as the Ising model on a complete graph. We
demonstrate that the effective system size of noisy period-doubling bifurcations exhibits universal
scaling behavior along period-doubling routes to chaos.

Period-doubling bifurcations have been observed in a
wide variety of natural systems spanning many areas
of science [1]. Univariate, discrete-time maps are the
simplest dynamical systems to exhibit a period-doubling
route to chaos [2, 3]. Applications range from the population dynamics of species with non-overlapping generations [4, 5] to the oscillators of rf-driven Josephson
junctions [6, 7]. The impact of noise on period-doubling
maps has been extensively studied in both ecology [8–11]
and physics [12–30], including the universal scaling of
the Lyapunov exponent along period-doubling routes to
chaos [31–36]. Connections between such noisy dynamical systems and the universality classes of equilibrium
statistical physics has been a subject of great fascination [37–48]. The theory of quasipotentials, providing
a formal link between equilibruim and nonequilibrium
physics, has been applied to many systems [49, 50]. In
particular, the theory of quasipotentials has been used
to estimate escape times from the attractors of noisy
period-doubling maps [51, 52] and to estimate the invariant probability distributions of their strange attractors
in the chaotic regime [51, 53]. Here, we investigate the
invariant probability distributions that characterize critical fluctuations in the pitchfork bifurcations of perioddoubling maps far from the chaotic threshold. In the
limit of weak noise, we find an exact correspondence between the static behavior of fluctuations at a pitchfork
bifurcation and the critical behavior of finite-size mean
field theory [54]. This correspondence places pitchfork
bifurcations in the same universality class as the Ising
model on a complete graph [55–59]. We also show that
the dynamic behavior of a pitchfork bifurcation is described by the mean-field limit of Model A [37]. Analytical estimates of critical exponents and amplitudes agree
well with the results of numerical simulations. We conclude with evidence of universal scaling behavior in the
effective system size of critical fluctuations along perioddoubling routes to chaos.
We start by considering a noisy, one-dimensional map

that can be written as
xt+1 = µ(r, xt ) + λσ(r, xt )ξt ,

(1)

where the xt are random variables, r is the control parameter, µ(r, xt ) is a deterministic period-doubling map,
λ is an overall constant factor setting the noise level,
σ(r, xt ) is a nonnegative function, and the ξt are independent, identically distributed standard normal random
variables. We restrict our attention to fluctuations arising from the effects of weak noise on supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. A pitchfork bifurcation in a perioddoubling sequence corresponds to a loss in stability of
the steady state fixed points, x∗ , with (rc , x∗c ) being the
critical point where [1, 61]
µ(rc , x∗c ) = x∗c ,
∂x µ(rc , x∗c ) = −1.

(2)

The first bifurcation breaks a Z2 time-translation symmetry: below rc , the stable attractor is a steady-state
fixed point, and trajectories on the attractor are invariant to all time-translations; above rc , the stable attractor
is a two-cycle and corresponding trajectories are only invariant to translations by an even-number of time steps.
We will investigate the critical fluctuations that emerge
from this Z2 symmetry breaking in the limit of weak noise
(λ → 0). Our results rely on the additional assumptions
that µ(r, xt ) is a C 3 map [60], i.e. three-times differentiable with respect to xt , and that the stable basin of
attraction of µ(r, xt ) is bounded on some finite interval.
Noisy maps in the form of Eq. 1 have been applied
to the study of stochastic fluctuations in ecological population densities [8, 10]. If µ(r, xt )=rxt (1 − xt ) and
σ(r, xt )=1, then Eq. 1 is the logistic map with extrinsic
additive noise. Non-constant choices for σ(r, xt ) model
intrinsic noise or a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
noise. When applied to population dynamics, common
choices might be σ(r, xt )=µ(r, xt ), modeling
multiplicap
tive environmental noise, or σ(r, xt )= µ(r, xt ), modeling demographic noise.

between the critical fluctuations of pitchfork bifurcations
and finite-size mean field theory.
We make the ansatz that critical fluctuations in the
pitchfork order parameter are described by the distribution of finite-size mean field theory
p(m) = exp (−N f (m)) ,

(5)

where N is the system size and the free energy (the largedeviation potential) at reduced temperature t̃ is
f (m) =

(6)

to leading order in N . Given the definition of m in Eq. 3,
the distribution of the order parameter, p(m), and the
distribution of x2T , h(x), are related by

FIG. 1. (Color online) Histogram of the order parameter,
m, at a noisy supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Blue points
and error bars are estimated from numerical simulations of
Eq. 1 at the first period-doubling transition of a logistic map,
µ(r, x)=rx(1 − x) and r=rc =3, with additive noise, λ=10−4
and σ(r, x)=1. The black line is a fit of a pure quartic distribution to the simulation results (chi-square per d.o.f. 1.6).
Fluctuations in the pitchfork order parameter described by
a quartic distribution suggest a correspondence between the
critical behavior of noisy pitchfork bifurcations and finite-size
mean field theory.

Over long enough time scales, a noisy trajectory, xt ,
will depart from the stable basin of attraction of µ(r, xt ).
However, for small enough λ and for initial conditions
on the interval bounding the stable attractor of µ(r, xt ),
a metastable probability distribution for xt will persist
over “intermediate” time periods that are much longer
than the duration of initial transients but exponentially
shorter than the characteristic time to depart from the
stable attractor.
This separation of time scales allows us to quantify
the critical fluctuations of pitchfork bifurcations. In both
the steady-state and two-cycle regimes that lie to either
side of the bifurcation, the metastable distribution of the
twice-iterated map, x2t , is approximately stationary at
any given intermediate time, T . We define the pitchfork
order parameter, hmi, as the expected value of
m ≡ a(x2T − x∗ ),

(3)

where a is a model-dependent scale factor and
x∗ ≡

1
hx2T + x2T −1 i .

(4)

Fig. 1 is a histogram of m based on numerical simulations of Eq. 1 for a logistic map with weak additive noise.
The distribution of the order parameter is highly symmetric and can be fit to a pure quartic. These numerical
results motivate us to seek an analytical correspondence

h(x) dx = p (a [x − x∗ (λ)]) a dx,

x∗ (λ) = x∗c + λZλ + (rc − r) Zt̃ ,

where

to leading order in λ and rc − r. The counter term Zλ
allows for corrections to x∗c at nonzero noise levels, while
Zt̃ allows for corrections away from the critical point.

and the “T-derivative”
T µ(rc , x∗c ) ≡ − ∂r ∂x µ(r, µ(r, x))|r=rc ,x=x∗c .

(15)

The Schwarzian derivative arises from a second-order stability analysis of the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation and is always negative for the supercritical pitchfork
bifurcations of C 3 maps [60]. The T-derivative arises in
our analysis due to the expansion in t̃ and is always negative for pitchfork bifurcations with a symmetric phase
below rc and a broken symmetry above, as can be seen
from a calculation using the normal form [61].
When r=rc , the ansatz of Eq. 7 is an exact solution of
the integral equation in Eq. 9 to leading order in λ. This
establishes the free energy in Eq. 6, with the effective reduced temperature and system size of Eq. 11, as an exact
potential for pitchfork bifurcations in the limit of weak
noise. Away from the bifurcation, Eq. 7 is a second-order
moment closure of Eq. 9. Note that the static behavior
of critical fluctuations at a pitchfork bifurcation are entirely determined by the value of the effective system-size
parameter, N . Consistent with previous calculations of
quasipotentials in noisy dynamical systems [49–53], the
expression in the exponent of Eq. 5 is inversely proportional to the variance of the noise, λ2 σ 2 (r, x∗c ).
In additional to mapping the static properties of pitchfork bifurcations onto finite-size mean field theory, we
find that the critical dynamics of noisy pitchfork bifurcation are the mean-field dynamics of Model A [37]. For
weak noise and intermediate time scales, the order parameter changes very little in a single time step, and the
difference equation for the twice-iterated map can be approximated as a differential equation

with ηdt being the Weiner process (white noise) and

(17)

Eq. 16 is the mean-field limit of Model A dynamics, a
Langevin equation in which the coefficients of the friction
and noise terms satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation.
We compare mean-field predictions of critical exponents and amplitudes to Monte Carlo simulations of the
first period-doubling bifurcation in a logistic map with
additive noise. Finite-size scaling and scaling collapse
are as predicted by finite-size mean field theory (see Supplemental Material for details). Because numerical estimates of the pitchfork order parameter based on Eq. 3

require a precision estimate of x∗ , we introduce an alternative estimator
a
m
b ≡ (x2t − x2t−1 ) .
(18)

In the finite-size scaling of integrated autocorrelation
times, the numerical results are consistent with the
mean-field
dynamical exponent z=2 and an amplitude of
p
Γ/2π. In the finite-size scaling of the order parameter,
the susceptibility, and the critical slope of the Binder cumulant, the numerical results are consistent with meanfield predictions for critical exponents and amplitudes.
In the scaling collapse of susceptibility, the peak value
defines the finite-size critical point
rc∗ (N ) = rc∗ +

N

(19)

The scaling collapse of Monte Carlo estimates of x∗ − x∗c
is consistent with the prediction of Eq. 8 precisely at
r=rc∗ (N ). A prediction of the scaling collapse away from
that point would require the introduction of higher-order
counter terms.
We now extend the above results to show that finitesize mean field theory describes the critical fluctuations
of all the pitchfork bifurcations of a period-doubling
map in the limit of weak noise. Let rn (dropping the
subscript “c” for convenience) denote the nth critical
point in a period-doubling sequence proceeding from a
q-cycle of a deterministic map. On rn−1 <r<rn , there
exist 2n−1 q stable fixed points of the n-times iterated
map, xt+1 =µn (r, xt ). At r=rn , stability is lost with
pitchfork bifurcations occurring at the points x∗n,p , where
p∈{1, . . . , 2n−1 q}. With the addition of weak noise, the
n-times iterated map is, to leading order in λ
xt+1 = µn (r, xt ) + λσn (r, xt )ξt ,

(20)

where σn (r, xt ) is given by a recursion relation [34]
2
σn+1
(r, x) =
2

σn (r, x)2 (∂x µn (r, µn (r, x))) + σn (r, µn (r, x))2 . (21)
Upon substituting Eq. 20 for Eq. 1 and expanding
around (rn , x∗n,p ) rather than (rc , x∗ ), the above results
for the critical fluctuations of the first pitchfork bifurcation in a period-doubling map apply to all the pitchfork
bifurcations in that map. Note that the conditions of
Eq. 2 apply to all supercritical bifurcations, and that if
Sµ(rc , x∗c )<0, then Sµn (rn , x∗n,p )<0 for all n and p [60].
We conclude with a numerical investigation of universal scaling behavior as the first sequence of perioddoubling bifurcations (q=1) approaches the chaotic
threshold at r=r∞ . First, in two different parameterizations of the logistic map, we find evidence (Fig. 2a)
that, for large n
− T µn (rn , x∗n,p ) ∝ (r∞ − rn )−1 ∝ δ n ,

with the intuition that the noise level, λ, must decrease
exponentially with n to maintain the same effective system size, Nn,p , at each pitchfork bifurcation.
We have shown that the critical fluctuations of noisy
pitchfork bifurcations are described by finite-size mean
field theory. This correspondence establishes an effective system size, N , for period-doubling bifurcations
that exhibits universal scaling behavior near the onset
of chaos. In applications to population dynamics with
demographic noise, the effective system size is directly
proportional to population size. Further work is needed

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

This supplement summarizes the predictions of finite-size mean field theory [54] and compares numerical estimates of
critical fluctuations near a noisy pitchfork bifurcation to mean-field predictions.

FINITE-SIZE MEAN FIELD THEORY

The finite-size scaling of mean field theory follow from the large-deviation function, Eq. 6, of the order parameter distribution, Eq. 5. We will compare numerical estimates for the finite-size scaling behavior of noisy pitchfork
bifurcations to mean-field predictions for the absolute value of the order parameter, h|m|i, the susceptibility, χ

(symbols and error bars) are based on samples of the order parameter, as defined in Eq. 18, along Monte Carlo trajectories for
the the first period-doubling pitchfork bifurcation of a logistic map with weak additive noise, i.e. Eq. 1 with µ(r, x)=rx(1 − x),
σ(r, x)=1, and r=rc =3. We find that numerical estimates of τint are
p consistent (chi-square per d.o.f. 2.8) with mean-field
predictions for the dynamical exponent, z=2, and an amplitude of Γ/2π. Numerical estimates of h|m|i, χ, and ∂t̃ U are
consistent (chi-square per d.o.f. of 0.35, 2.5, and 1.1, respectively) with the predictions of finite-size mean field theory (Eq. S3a,
S3b, and S3d, respectively) and N as defined by Eq. 11.

FIG. S4. Scaling collapse of (a) the integrated autocorrelation time, τint , (b) the absolute value of the pitchfork order parameter,
h|m|i, (c) the susceptibility, χ, and (d) the Binder cumulant, U . Numerical estimates (symbols and error bars) are based on
samples of the order parameter, as defined in Eq. 18, along Monte Carlo trajectories for the the first period-doubling pitchfork
bifurcation of a logistic map with weak additive noise, i.e. Eq. 1 with µ(r, x)=rx(1 − x), σ(r, x)=1, and r=rc =3. Numerical
estimates of h|m|i, χ, and U are consistent with the predictions of finite-size mean field theory (black lines). In panel (c), the
vertical grey line marks the peak value of scaled susceptibility, which defines the finite-size critical point, rc∗ (N ) (Eq. 19). In
panel (d), the grey lines indicate that numerical estimates of the critical value of the Binder cumulant are consistent with the
mean-field prediction (Eq. S3c).

FIG. S5. Scaling collapse of finite-size corrections to x∗ . Numerical estimates (symbols and error bars) are based on sampling
values of x∗ , as defined in Eq. 4, along Monte Carlo trajectories for the the first period-doubling pitchfork bifurcation of a
logistic map with weak additive noise, i.e. Eq. 1 with µ(r, x)=rx(1 − x), σ(r, x)=1, r=rc =3, and x∗c =2/3. Those numerical
estimates are consistent with the leading-order theoretical estimate (Eq. 8 with Eqs. 11 and 13, black line) at the finite-size
critical point, rc∗ (N ) (Eq. 19, gray line). Theoretical estimates for scaling collapse away from the finite-size critical point require
the introduction of higher-order counter terms to Eq. 8.
