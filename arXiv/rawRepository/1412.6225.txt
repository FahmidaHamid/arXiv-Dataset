We investigated the viscoelastic response of model interphase chromosomes by tracking the three-dimensional
motion of hundreds of dispersed Brownian particles of sizes ranging from the thickness of the chromatin
fiber up to slightly above the mesh size of the chromatin solution. In agreement with previous computational studies on polymer solutions and melts, we found that the large-time behaviour of diffusion coefficient
and the experienced viscosity of moving particles as functions of particle size deviate from the traditional
Stokes-Einstein relation, and agree with a recent scaling theory of diffusion of non-sticky particles in polymer
solutions. Interestingly, we found that at short times large particles are temporary “caged” by chromatin
spatial constraints, which thus form effective domains whose size match remarkably well recent experimental results for micro-tracers inside interphase nuclei. Finally, by employing a known mathematical relation
between the time mean-square displacement of tracked particles and the complex shear modulus of the surrounding solution, we calculated the elastic and viscous moduli of interphase chromosomes.

INTRODUCTION

In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus is a well recognizable
organelle, which plays the role of maintaining the genome
physically separated from the rest of the cell. Inside
the nucleus, the genome is organized into single bodies, the chromosomes, and each chromosome is constituted of a variably-long linear filament of DNA and protein complexes, known as the chromatin fiber1 . In human cells, the nucleus is approximately 10 micron wide
and the length of a chromatin filament associated to a
single chromosome is of the order of 1 millimeter, i.e.
≈ 100 times longer. Hence, chromatin fibers form an
intricated polymer-like network inside the nucleus of the
cell2 . In spite of this “intricacy” though, macromolecular
complexes and enzymes which need to run and bind to
specific target sequences along the genome are relatively
mobile inside the nucleus2 .
In order to study quantitatively the dynamic properties of macromolecular compounds inside the chromatin mesh, passive microrheology has been recently introduced3,4 . Artificially-designed beads of sub-micron
size are carefully injected inside the nucleus, and their
thermally-driven Brownian motion is tracked by fluorescence microscopy. From the analysis of the microscopic
passive dynamics of the beads inside the nuclear medium,
it is then possible4 to extract quantitative information on
the viscoelastic properties of the medium.
Compared to standard rheology, microrheology offers
several advantages. Specifically, because of the feasibility
to design trackable particles of sizes ranging from a few
nanometers5 to hundreds of nanometers3 and microns6
microrheology can probe very efficiently a remarkably
wide range of length- and time-scales. This offers an
unprecedented possibility to address specific questions in

complex materials which can not be answered by traditional bulk rheology. Nowadays, micro-rheology is extensively used to study biological materials because it offers
methods which, being minimally invasive, can be used
to perform experiments in vivo by employing very small
samples7 .
In this work, and along the lines of previous computational investigations aiming at measuring the viscoelastic
properties of polymer solutions and melts8,9 , we have employed molecular dynamics computer simulations in order to study the diffusive behavior of (sub-)micron sized,
non-sticky particles probing the rheological properties of
a coarse-grained polymer model of interphase chromosomes10–12 .
Our approach complements and extends in many different ways the above-mentioned experimental work.
First, passive non-sticky particles undergoing simple
Brownian motion represent the simplest minimallyinvasive tools whose microscopic dynamics can be directly linked to the viscoelastic properties of the surrounding medium. Contrarily, if particles become sticky
or they become actively driven as a consequence of some
cellular process, the corresponding link to the viscoelastic properties of the medium is much less transparent
and more interpretative tools are needed13 . Second, by
our computational approach we are able to single out the
nominal contribution of chromatin fibers to the whole nuclear viscoelasticity. We believe this also to be an important point, as the viscoelastic response obtained through
wet-lab experiments likely originates from the unavoidable coupling of chromatin fibers with any other organelle
present in the nucleus. Third, while the sizes of probing particles available in experiments appear to be limited3,5,6 , here we monitor systematically quite an extensive range of spatial scales, from the nominal chromatin
thickness up to just above the mesh (entanglement) size
of the chromatin solution.
In qualitative agreement with recent findings from a

2
computational study on entangled polymer melts8 , we
found that the diffusive behavior of probe particles as
a function of particle size deviates from the traditional
Stokes-Einstein picture. Our results can be well understood instead in terms of a recently proposed14 scaling
theory of diffusion of non-sticky particles in polymer solutions. We demonstrated further, that large particles
at short time scales are temporary “caged” by chromatin spatial constraints, and remain confined to domains whose size match remarkably well recent experimental results for micro-tracers inside interphase nuclei.
Finally, we calculated the elastic and viscous moduli of
interphase chromosomes and found that, in the available
frequency range, they are more liquid- than solid-like.
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we describe the technical details of the chromosome polymer
model, and the theoretical framework to study the viscoelastic properties of chromatin solution. In Sec. III, we
present our results. Finally, we conclude (Sec. IV) with
a brief discussion and possible perspectives about future
work.

Simulation protocol I. Force field

In this work, the monomers used in the coarse representation of the chromatin fiber building the model chromosome and the non-sticky micro-probes were modeled
as spherical particles, interacting through the following
force field.
The intra-polymer interaction energy is the same as
the one used in our previous works on the modeling of
interphase chromosomes10,11,15 . It consists of the following terms:

where ξp = 5.0σ = 150 nm is the nominal persistence

that this is equivalent to a Kuhn length, lK = 2ξp =

3) The excluded volume interaction between distinct
monomers (including consecutive ones) corresponds to a
purely repulsive Lennard-Jones potential:

Simulation protocol II. Molecular Dynamics simulations

As in our previous studies10,11,15 , polymer/particle dynamics was studied by using fixed-volume Molecular Dynamics simulations at fixed monomer density ρ = N/V =
0.1/σ 3 with periodic boundary conditions19 . V is the volume of the region of the box accessible to polymer i.e.
not occupied by the dispersed particles, hence the total
3
volume of the simulation box is Vbox = V + 4π
3 Np R .
With this choice: (1) polymer density matches the nominal nuclear DNA density of ≈ 0.012 bp/nm3 which was
used in our previous studies10,11,15 , and (2) the entanglement length Le = 1.2 µm = 1.2 × 105 bps and the corre-

q
sponding tube diameter (mesh size) dT = lK6Le ≈ 245
nm10–12 , of the polymer solution (which are functions of
fiber stiffness and density20 ) are not affected by particles
insertion. Interestingly, as reported by a recent study9
on microrheology of unentangled polymer melts, simulations at fixed V also guarantee that loss and storage
moduli are minimally perturbed by the insertion of dispersed particles.
The system dynamics was integrated by using
LAMMPS21 with Langevin thermostat in order to keep
fixed the temperature of the system to 1.0kB T . The
elementary integration time step is equal to tint =
0.012τMD , where τMD = σ(m/ǫ)1/2 is the Lennard-Jones
time, m = M = 1 are the chosen values22 for the mass
of monomers and particles, respectively. γ = 0.5/τMD is
the monomer/particle friction coefficient16 which takes
into account the corresponding interaction with a background implicit solvent. The total numerical effort corresponds to 2.52 × 107 τMD per single run, amounting to
≈ 104 hours on single typical CPU. The first 1.2 × 106
MD time steps have been discarded from the analysis of
results.

Simulation protocol III. Initial configuration

Construction of model chromosome conformation – In
spite of the complexity of the chromatin fiber and the nuclear medium, three-dimensional chromosome conformations are remarkably well described by generic polymer
models23–25 . In particular, it was suggested10,26 that the
experimentally observed27 crumpled chromosome structure can be understood as the consequence of slow equilibration of chromatin fibers due to mutual chain uncrossability during thermal motion. As a consequence,
chromosomes do not behave like equilibrated linear polymers in solution28,29 . Instead, they appear rather similar to unlinked and unknotted circular (ring) polymers
in entangled solution. In fact, under these conditions
ring polymers are known to spontaneously segregate and
form compact conformations12,24,26 , strikingly similar to
images of chromosomes in live cells obtained by fluorescence techniques30 .
Due to the typical large size of mammalian chro-

4
mosomes (∼ 108 basepairs of DNA), even minimalistic
computational models would require the simulation of
large polymer chains, with tens of thousands of beads
or so10,11,15 . For these reasons, in this work we resort
to our recent mixed Monte-Carlo/Molecular Dynamics
multi-scale algorithm12 , in order to design a single, equilibrated ring polymer conformation at the nominal polymer density of ρ = 0.1/σ 3 (Sec. II B). The ring is constituted by N = 39154 monomer particles, which correspond to the average linear size of a mammalian chromosome with ≈ 1.18 × 108 basepairs. By construction,
the adopted protocol guarantees that the polymer has
the nominal local features of the 30nm-chromatin fiber
(stiffness, density and topology conservation) that have
been already employed elsewhere10,11,15 . For the details
of the multi-scale protocol, we refer the reader to Ref.12 .
Insertion of probe particles – In order to place Np =
100 spherical particles of increasing radii inside the chromatin solution, we have proceeded as follows. First, we
have inserted particles of radius = 1.0σ = 30 nm at random positions inside the simulation box. We have carefully removed next unwanted overlaps with chromatin
monomers by a short MD run (≈ 100τMD ) with the
LAMMPS option NVE/LIMIT, which limits the maximum distance a particle can move in a single time-step,
see31 . At the end of this run, we have gently inflated the
simulation box so to reestablish the correct polymer density of ρ = 0.1/σ 3 . Initial configurations with particles
of larger radius are obtained from initial configurations
with particles with the immediately smaller radius, by
making use again of the NVE/LIMIT option in order to
gently remove possible overlaps, followed again by gentle
inflation of the simulation box.

Particle-tracking microrheology

Microrheology32 employs the diffusive thermal motion
of particles dispersed in a medium in order to derive the
complex shear modulus Ĝ(ω) = G′ (ω) + iG′′ (ω) of the
medium32 . Following Mason and Weitz32 , the motion
of each dispersed particle is described by a generalised
Langevin equation:
Z t
dv(t)
M
=−
γ(t − τ )v(τ )dτ + f (t),
(9)
dt
0
where M is the mass of the particle, v is its velocity,
f (t) represents the stochastic force acting on the particle consequent from its interaction with the surrounding
visco-elastic medium, and the function γ(t) represents
the (time-dependent) memory kernel. Eq. 9 is complemented by the fluctuation-dissipation relation:
′

′

hf (t) · f (t )i = 6 kB T γ(t − t ) .
33

By taking the Laplace transform

(10)

of Eq. 9 one gets:

M s ṽ(s) − M v(0) = −γ̃(s) ṽ(s) + f̃ (s),

(11)

or
ṽ(s) =

M v(0) + f̃ (s)
.
M s + γ̃(s)

(12)

Then, by multiplying Eq. 12 by v(0) and taking the thermal average we get:
M hv(0)2 i + hf̃ (s) · v(0)i
3kB T
=
,
M s + γ̃(s)
M s + γ̃(s)
(13)
where we have used the equipartition relation
M hv(0)2 i = 3kB T and the result hf̃ (s) · v(0)i = 09 .
The average thermal motion of the dispersed particle is defined through the time mean-square displacement, δx2 (τ ) ≡ h(x(t + τ ) − x(t))2 i, where
Rt
x(t) = 0 v(t′ ) dt′ + x(0) is particle position at time
Rτ
t.
Since δx2 (τ ) = 2 0 (τ − t)hv(t) · v(0)idt, or
δx̃2 (s) = s22 hṽ(s) · v(0)i, the Laplace transform of the
memory kernel γ̃(s) can be expressed as a function of
the Laplace transform of the mean-square displacement,
δx̃2 (s):
hṽ(s) · v(0)i =

γ̃(s) =

6kB T
− Ms .
s2 δx̃2 (s)

(14)

By assuming32 that γ̃(s) is proportional to the bulk
frequency-dependent viscosity of the fluid, η̃(s), we get
finally:
η̃(s) =

γ̃(s)
,
νπa

(15)

as in the case of a standard viscous fluid. The parameter ν depends on the boundary condition at the particle
surface34 : for sticky boundary condition ν = 3 and for
slip boundary condition ν = 2. The Laplace-transform
of the shear modulus G̃(s) = s η̃(s) is given by:

where the last expression is obtained by neglecting the
inertia term32 . Finally, the complex shear modulus Ĝ(ω)
as a function of frequency ω is obtained from G̃(s) by analytical continuation upon substitution of “s” with “iω”:
T
. Its real (G′ (ω)) and imaginary
Ĝ(ω) = −i νπa ω6δkx̃B2 (s=iω)

(G (ω)) parts correspond to the so-called storage and
loss moduli and are a measure of the elastic and viscous
properties of the solution29 , respectively.

particles, and (2) particles diffusion is exclusively influenced by particle-chromatin interaction and not by
particle-particle interactions. In order to test (1), as
a measure of chromosome conformation we considered
the average-square internal distances hR2 (L)i10 between
pairs of chromatin beads at genomic distance, L. Fig. 1A
shows plots of hR2 (L)i for all sizes of dispersed particles.
The almost perfect match between different curves shows
that, on average, the polymer maintains the same spatial
conformation. In order to test (2), we removed the chromosome and measured particle diffusion then. Fig. 1B
shows that particles diffuse normally with diffusion coefficients barely depending on particle size. Hence, even if
particle-particle collisions were not completely excluded
from our system, their effect is small, in particular it is
much smaller than the effect due to collisions between
particles and chromatin monomers (see Fig. 2 below).
Of course, the effect of particle-particle collisions can be
reduced even further by considering a larger polymer system at the same number of diffusing particles, Np .

After validation of our model, we proceeded to analyse the dynamics of dispersed particles in the presence
of the polymer and as a function of particle diameter, a.
We considered first the time mean-square displacement,
δx2 (τ ), of the particles, and the corresponding instantaneous diffusion coefficient and viscosity respectively de2
kB T
fined as D(τ ) = δx6 τ(τ ) and η(τ ) = 2π (a+σ)
D(τ ) , where
“a+σ” is the cross-diameter of the dispersed particle and
the slip boundary condition applies34 .
Table I and Fig. 2 summarize our results. We found
that, after a short ballistic time regime, small particles with a = 30 nm and a = 60 nm diffuse normally, δx2 (t) = 6D∞ t, with terminal diffusion coef2
ficients D∞ ≡ limτ →∞ δx6τ(τ ) ≈ 5 × 10−2 µm2 /s and
D∞ ≈ 3 × 10−2 µm2 /s, respectively, corresponding to
kB T
terminal viscosities η∞ ≡ 2π (a+σ)D
≈ 0.21 Pa·s and
∞
η∞ ≈ 0.25 Pa·s. As particle size was increased from
a = 120 to a = 300 nm, we observed: (1) the appearance of a small-time anomalous regime δx2 (τ ) ∼ τ α
with α slowly approaching 0.514 for large a, (2) a dramatic drop in the terminal diffusion coefficient down to
≈ 5 × 10−4 µm2 /s, and (3) an increase of the corresponding viscosity with particle size up to ≈ 4 Pa·s.
We interpreted our results at the light of the scaling argument discussed by Cai et al.14 . As in the case
of any general polymer solution, our model chromatin
mesh can be characterized by two fundamental quantities10,28,29 : (1) the fiber stiffness, measured in terms of
the Kuhn length lK = 300 nm = 3 × 104 basepairs, and
(2) the entanglement length, Le = 1.2 µm = 1.2 × 105
basepairs, which is a function of chromatin stiffness and
density10,20 and represents the characteristic chain contour length value above which polymers start to entangle. Kinetic properties of the chromatin solution are
affected by entanglements on length scales larger than
the so-called
qtube diameter (or mesh size) of the solution, dT = lK6Le ≈ 245 nm, and on time scales larger
than the entanglement time, τe ≈ 32 seconds10 . According to Cai et al.14 , since particle size is at most
only slightly larger than dT (see Table I), entanglements
are not expected to affect significantly particle diffusion. Under these conditions, particle dynamics is coupled to the “Rouse-like” relaxation modes of chromatin
segments with contour length shorter than Le , namely
made of nK (τ ) ∼ (τ /τK )1/2 Kuhn segments and having spatial size ∼ lK nK (τ )1/2 ∼ lK (τ /τK )1/4 . The
corresponding chromatin viscosity is given29 then by
η(τ ) ∼ ηK nK (τ ) ∼ ηK (τ /τK )1/2 where ηK and τK are
the viscosity and relaxation time of a Kuhn segment, respectively. The mean-square displacement of the particle

diameter, a. Power-laws correspond to theoretical predictions
by Cai et al.14 . In particular, deviation from the intermediate
power-law behavior ∼ a−3 for D∞ and ∼ a2 for η∞ arise
when particle size becomes comparable to the tube diameter
of chromatin solution, dT ≈ 245 nm10 .

Fig. 3 summarizes our results for D∞ and η∞ showing
good agreement with theoretical predictions. Nonetheless, we report some deviation from the predicted behavior when the particle size reaches the nominal tube
diameter dT ≈ 245 nm (rightmost symbols in Fig. 3).
In spite of the reported evidence that particle dynamics appears to be dominated by the relaxational
Rouse modes of chromatin linear sections < Le , we
found that entanglements play nonetheless a (although
quite more subtle) role: in fact, they lead to the formation of effective “domains” which cage the particles.
In order to show that, we computed the probability distribution functions, P (δx(τ )), of particle displacements
δx(τ ) ≡ x(t + τ ) − x(t) at lag-times τ . To fix the
ideas, we chose lag-times τ = 0.24, 2.4, 24, 240 s for all
particle sizes, see Fig. 4. Interesting features emerge

upon calculation of the corresponding scaling plots
p (insets) obtained by substitutions δx(τ ) → δx(τ )/ δx2 (τ )
and P (δx(τ )) → P (δx(τ )) δx2 (τ )3/2 . In particular, at
long lag-times and for all particle sizes, the distribution is described by a simple Gaussian, P (δx(τ )) =

lag-times, the Gaussian distribution holds for small particles only. In fact, at large particle sizes and small δx(τ ),
P (δx(τ )) shows significant deviations from the Gaussian
behavior which can be understood in terms of partial
trapping due to the emerging topological constraints8 .
This conclusion is further supported (see Fig. 5) by the
behaviour of the distribution function Q(θ
 τ ) of angles
)−x(t))·(x(t+2τ )−x(t+τ ))
between τ θτ ≡ cos−1 (x(t+τ
|x(t+τ )−x(t)| |x(t+2τ )−x(t+τ )|
lagged particle vector displacements taken consecutively
along the trajectory. At τ = 0.24 s, Q(θτ ) for small particles diameters of 30 and 60 nm match the random distribution Q(θτ ) = sin(θτ )/2 (black solid lines in Fig. 5). For
larger particle sizes, Q(θτ ) is constantly shifted towards
higher values of θτ , which is compatible with the picture where particles revert their motion frequently as the
consequence of trapping inside chromatin domains. Finally, at large τ where particle motion is diffusive for all
particle sizes, Q(θτ ) becomes compatible again with the
random distribution (see corresponding panels in Fig. 5),
as expected.
To complete our analysis, we calculated the storage
(G′ (ω)) and loss (G′′ (ω)) modulus of the chromatin solution from, respectively, the real and imaginary part of
the complex shear modulus Ĝ(ω) = −i π(a+σ)3ωkBδx̃T2 (s=iω) ,
see Sec. II D. For the generic case where particle motion is subdiffusive at short times and diffusive at large
times, the mean-square displacement can be phenomenologically described by δx2 (τ ) = 6Dα τ α + 6D∞ τ where
Dα is the (generalized) diffusion coefficient associated to
the anomalous time regime with exponent 0 < α < 1.
In this case, δx̃2 (s) = 6Dα Γ(α + 1) s−(α+1) + 6D∞ s−2 .
After some algebra, G′ (ω) and G′′ (ω) are given by the

In this limit, G′ (ω) and G′′ (ω) have the same power-law
behavior, with G′ (ω) smaller (resp., larger) than G′′ (ω)
for 1/2 < α < 1 (resp., 0 < α < 1/2). Our results for
the mean-square displacement δx2 (τ ) ∼ τ α with α & 0.5
(Fig. 2A) then predict that G′ (ω) < G′′ (ω) on the entire
frequency range considered here.
In order to derive the complex shear modulus Ĝ(ω)
of the chromatin solution, we resorted to the numerical method developed by Evans and coworkers35–37 .
The method allows a straightforward evaluation of the

Results are summarized in Fig. 6. For small frequencies, we confirm the predicted results G′ (ω) ∼ ω 1.5 ≪
G′′ (ω) ≈ η∞ ω, i.e. the polymer solution behaves as a
typical viscous medium. For large frequencies, deviation
from this behavior is particularly evident in the case of
large particles where G′ (ω) . G′′ (ω) ∼ ω 1/2 , and the
polymer solution behaves like a “power-law” liquid. Representative values for G′ (ω) and G′′ (ω) at ω = 0.1, 1 and

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The nucleus of eukaryotic cells is a highly crowded
medium dominated by the presence of chromatin fibers
which form an intricated polymer network. In this network, several protein complexes diffuse while targeting specific genome sequencing1 . In order to understand the mechanisms of macromolecular diffusion inside
the nucleus, the tracking of artificially-designed injected
micron-sized particles (microrheology) has been recently
introduced3,4 .
In this work, we investigated the diffusion of 100 tracer
particles inside a polymer environment modelling the
structure of interphase chromosomes in mammals. In

particular, we considered particle sizes ranging from 30
to 300 nm in order to explore the dynamic response on
polymer length-scales from the nominal chromatin diameter (30 nm) up to just slight above the so-called mesh
(entanglement) size of the chromatin solution, dT ≈ 245
nm10 .
In qualitative agreement with other computational
studies8,9 on the generic behaviour of micro-tracers in
model polymer melts, we found that small particles undergo normal diffusion at all times, while intermediatesize particle sub-diffuse at short times and diffuse normally later on, see Fig. 2. In particular, terminal diffusivities can be understood in terms of the scaling theory
proposed recently by Cai et al.14 , see Fig. 3. Of remarkable interest is the dynamic behaviour at times shorter
than the entanglement time, τe , in particular for big particles. In fact, the sub-diffusive behaviour appears here
to be associated to temporary trapping on scales compatible with the emerging of topological constraints in
the underlying chromatin solution, see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.
Interestingly, two independent experimental studies on
murine fibroblasts3 and human HeLa cells6 employing
micro-tracers of, respectively, 0.1 and 1.0 micron of diameter found particle trapping in nuclear domains of size
≈ 290 nm and ≈ 250 nm respectively, which is in good
quantitative agreement with the nominal mesh size of our
chromatin solution. We stress nonetheless, that here we

lines) with G′′ (ω) ≫ G′ (ω) ∼ ω 1.5 , i.e. the medium responds as a standard viscous fluid, see Eq. 18 with α = 0.5. For large
frequencies and large length-scales, the elastic modulus becomes comparable to the loss modulus G′ (ω) ≈ G′′ (ω) ≈ ω 1/2 as
expected, see Eq. 19 with α = 0.5. Numerical data for G′ and G′′ have been obtained from numerical calculation of δ x̃2 (s = iω),

reinterpret the experimentally observed caging as simply
being the consequence of the formation of entanglements
in the chromatin fiber, i.e. as a genuine polymer effect28,29 .
We compare then our predictions for the storage,
G′ (ω), and loss, G′′ (ω), moduli to corresponding results for fibroblasts and HeLa cells. For micro-tracers
of 0.1µm-diameter in fibroblasts, Tseng et al.3 found
that the nuclear medium responds elastically in the range
[1 − 10] Hz with a plateau modulus G′ (ω) ≈ 10 Pa and
G′′ (ω) in the range [3 − 10] Pa. This contrasts with our
findings in several respects: our predicted environment
is in general much softer (see Table II), and we do not
observe any plateau, for our simulated medium results
more liquid-like than solid-like. On the other hand, the
work by Hameed et al.6 on HeLa cells explored by 1µmsized particles suggests a much softer nuclear environment with G′ (ω) ≈ 0.1 Pa > G′′ (ω) ≈ 0.05 Pa at ω = 1
Hz. While still suggesting a nucleus which is more solidthan liquid-like, these results are quantitatively closer to
ours, although they were obtained with a quite larger
tracer bead than the ones used in our simulations.
Quantitative differences between these two experi-

ments can be due to the different cell lines used, while
differences between experiments and theory might be due
to the simplicity of the polymer model. In particular, we
would like to stress two important points which were neglected in our study.
First, a conspicuous number of experimental observations27,38,39 demonstrated that chromatin loci far along
the sequence frequently interact with each other because
of the presence of specific protein bridges. From a polymer physics perspective, this creates effective chromatinchromatin cross-links. It was suggested8 that permanent
cross-links in polymer solutions and melts might alter significantly the diffusive behavior of micro-particles when
their size becomes comparable to the polymer mesh size.
Therefore, as a possible avenue for further investigations,
it would be interesting to clarify to which extent crosslinks added to the system would alter the viscoelastic
behaviour reported here for non cross-linked chromatin
fibers.
Second, recent experimental studies6,40 demonstrated
that chromosomal activity and chromosomal loci dynamics is the result of a subtle interplay between passive thermal diffusion and active, ATP-dependent mo-

10
tion triggered by chromatin remodeling and transcription complexes. The mentioned work by Hameed et al.6
showed that the persistent, caged behavior of the microtracers can be altered by imposing an external force on
the tracers above a certain threshold which stimulates
frequent jumps between the cages. Remarkably, these
jumps become almost suppressed after ATP-depletion.
This observation seems then to point to the important
role played by active mechanisms during micro-tracers
dynamics. Later on in the paper, these mechanisms were
ascribed to dynamic remodeling of the chromatin fiber6 .
Consistent with that, Weber et al.40 showed that diffusion of chromosomal loci in bacteria and yeast is also
ATP-dependent. Taken together, these results suggest
that a picture where chromatin fibers are modeled as
just as passive polymer filaments is necessarily an approximation. To move beyond this approximation, recently Ganai et al.41 proposed a novel computational
approach where chromosomes were modeled as chains
of beads which were let evolving by a Langevin equation with a non-uniform, monomer-dependent temperature linking – at a phenomenological level – monomer
gene content to “out-of-equilibrium” activity: gene-rich
monomers are “hot/active” while gene-poor monomers
are “cold/passive”. Interestingly, the work comes to the
conclusion that quantitative understanding of the observed chromosomal arrangement inside the nucleus by
purely passive mechanisms is incomplete, namely active
mechanisms are also needed. For all these reasons, it
would be also interesting to explore in the near future to
which extent the viscoelastic properties of active-driven
chromatin fibers deviate from the theoretical predictions
presented in this work.

by reasons of pure convenience, as in the subsequent analysis
