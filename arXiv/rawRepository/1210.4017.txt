Fo F1 -ATP synthase is a factory for synthesizing ATP in virtually all cells. Its core machinery
is the subcomplex F1 -motor (F1 -ATPase) and performs the reversible mechanochemical coupling.
Isolated F1 -motor hydrolyzes ATP, which is accompanied by unidirectional rotation of its central
γ-shaft. When a strong opposing torque is imposed, the γ-shaft rotates in the opposite direction
and drives the F1 -motor to synthesize ATP. This mechanical-to-chemical free-energy transduction is
the final and central step of the multistep cellular ATP-synthetic pathway. Here, we determined the
amount of mechanical work exploited by the F1 -motor to synthesize an ATP molecule during forced
rotations using methodology combining a nonequilibrium theory and single molecule measurements
of responses to external torque. We found that the internal dissipation of the motor is negligible
even during rotations far from a quasistatic process.

Fo F1 -ATP synthase comprises an Fo -motor embedded in a membrane (inner membrane of the mitochondria in
the eukaryotic cells) and an F1 -motor protruding from the membrane (Fig. 1a). Proton translocation through the
Fo -motor driven by the transmembrane electrochemical potential unidirectionally rotates the c-ring of the Fo -motor.
Because the c-ring is connected to the γ-shaft of F1 -motor, the c-ring imposes torque on the γ-shaft causing it to
rotate. The forced rotation of the γ-shaft induces the F1 -motor’s stator α3 β3 ring to synthesize ATP from ADP and
Pi (inorganic phosphate). The F1 -motor converts the mechanical work transferred from the c-ring to the chemical
free energy of ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi , ∆µ [1, 2]. Approximately 95% of cellular ATP is synthesized by this
rotary mechanochemical transduction. In contrast, the isolated F1 -motor hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and phosphate
and rotates the γ-shaft by converting ∆µ to mechanical motion [3, 4]. However, the rotational direction is opposite to
that of the ATP-synthetic rotation. The γ-shaft rotates 120◦ per ATP hydrolysis [2, 4]. Thus, the F1 -motor reversibly
transduces free-energy between mechanical work and ∆µ [3–6].
The detailed kinetics and reaction scheme of the F1 -motor’s rotations have been studied intensively. In contrast,
knowledge regarding the energetics is limited [4, 7–11] due to the difficulty in studying the energetics of such nanosized
engines working at an energy scale comparable to thermal energy. An experimental methodology was recently established by combining measurements of single molecule responses with nonequilibrium theory [8–11]. Previous research
revealed the high efficiency of the ATP-hydrolytic rotations by the isolated F1 -motor as follows: (i) The maximum
work performed by the F1 -motor during a 120◦ rotation is equal to ∆µ within experimental error [9]. Specifically,
the F1 -motor achieves a unity thermodynamic efficiency at the stalled state where the mean rotational rate vanishes
because of a hindering external torque. (ii) The F1 -motor converts ∆µ to mechanical work with negligible internal

heat dissipation even during rotations far from quasistatic process [8]. (iii) The motor minimizes the internal heat
dissipation by switching its chemical state depending on the angular position of the γ-shaft [10].
However, the primary physiological role played by the F1 -motor is not hydrolysis but mechanochemical ATP
synthesis driven by the forced-rotations of the γ-shaft. This raises the fundamental unanswered question regarding
the free-energy transduction as follows: How much work is required to drive the F1 -motor to synthesize an ATP
molecule? To address this question, we improved available methodology [8] and investigated the energetics of the
forced ATP-synthetic rotations by the isolated F1 -motor.
Experiment

An isolated F1 -motor molecule was adhered to an upper glass surface (Fig. 1b) [3, 4]. A submicron particle was
attached to the γ-shaft with an elastic protein linker to probe the γ-shaft rotations by an optical microscope. We
imposed a torque on the probe using an electrorotation method [8, 9, 12–14]. The electrorotation method uses a
high-frequency alternating-current electric field generated by quadrupolar electrodes and imposes a torque with a
controlled magnitude (see Methods). Thus, we can measure the rotational response of a single motor molecule as a
function of external torque. This system mimics the mechanochemical transduction inside the Fo F1 -ATP synthase;
the upper glass surface, the probe, and the torque imposed correspond to the stator, the c-ring, and the proton-motive
force that drives the c-ring, respectively.
Consider the energetics of this system as follows (Fig. 1c): Under sufficiently strong torque in the ATP-synthetic
direction, the probe-shaft complex rotates in that direction [9]. The amount of the external torque multiplied by 120◦
with a sign depending on the rotational direction is the work, Wext , performed on the probe per ATP cycle. A portion
of Wext , W , is transferred to the motor by rotating the γ-shaft with the elastic linker and the remainder, Qprobe ,
dissipates through the viscous friction of the probe.
W = Wext − Qprobe .

(1)

The motor receives W , converts it to the chemical free energy change ∆µ by synthesizing an ATP molecule at its
α3 β3 ring. The remainder, Qmotor ≡ W − ∆µ, dissipates irreversibly from the motor.
The motor molecule itself is not accessible by experiments. Nevertheless, the heat dissipation from the nanosized
motor Qmotor can be estimated from the thermodynamic quantities regarding the probe Wext and Qprobe using
the energy balance (1). Wext is easily calculated as noted, whereas it is usually difficult to measure heat Qprobe in a
microscopic system subjected to thermal fluctuations. This is because, although heat can be defined as the microscopic
energy exchange with the solvent [15], the thermal fluctuating force is inaccessible using experimental manipulations.
However, a nonequilibrium equality derived by Harada and Sasa [16–18] enables us to calculate Qprobe from quantities
that can be derived experimentally: the fluctuation and the response to a small external torque perturbation of the
rotational rate (see Materials and Methods for details). Fluctuation and response are related by the fluctuation

3
response relation (FRR) around the equilibrium state [19]. The FRR is generally violated far from equilibrium.
Therefore, the extent of the FRR violation indicates how far the system is driven to nonequilibrium. The Harada and
Sasa’s relation relates the extent of the FRR violation to the heat dissipation at a nonequilibrium steady state. This
relation is valid in systems described by Langevin equations such as a colloidal particle in an aqueous solution.
In the following experiment, we evaluated Qprobe by Harada-Sasa relation, obtained W from [1], and compared it
with ∆µ to evaluate the energetics of mechanical-to-chemical free energy transduction. We also discuss the energetics
of the chemical-to-mechanical transduction in the ATP-hydrolytic rotations.
Results

Single-molecule response measurement and violation of the fluctuation-response relation. The γ-shaft’s rotations
were assessed using a large dimeric probe (diameter = 300 nm) at a relatively high ATP concentration (10 µM ATP,
10 µM ADP, 1 mM Pi ). Under this condition, the probe rotated smoothly without clear steps in the absence of
external torque (Fig. 2a). When we applied external torque to the probe using the electrorotation method in the
direction opposite to the rotations, the rotational rate decreased (Fig. 2a and b). At torques greater than ∆µ/120◦,
the rotation was reversed, and the γ-shaft rotated in the ATP-synthetic direction. This is consistent with a previous
result showing that the maximum work that the F1 -motor can exert per ATP cycle is similar to ∆µ [9]. Specifically,
the thermodynamic efficiency of the F1 -motor is nearly 1 at the stalled state where the mean rotational rate vanishes.
The FRR is violated at low frequencies (Fig. 2c) where the motor drives the probe to a nonequilibrium state [8],
whereas the FRR is held at high frequencies where the probe’s motion is expected to behave as a freely rotating
Brownian particle at equilibrium. The extent of the FRR violation, or twice that of the shaded area in Fig. 2c,
corresponds to the integral in Harada-Sasa relation (see Materials and Methods). When we increased the magnitude
of the load from zero, the extent of the FRR violation decreased in the ATP-hydrolytic rotations, nearly vanished at
the stalled state, and increased again in the ATP-synthetic rotations.
Energetics of mechanical-to-chemical free energy transduction. In Fig. 3a, Qprobe evaluated by Harada-Sasa equality
and Wext (= ±(torque) × 120◦) are shown. Qprobe linearly decreased as we increased the load and vanished around
the stalled state. This indicates that, at the stalled state, the probe behaved like a rotational Brownian motion at
equilibrium in a 120◦ -spacing periodic potential. In the ATP-synthetic rotations, the value of Qprobe increased as the
torque increased further, mainly because the rotational rate increased with torque.
In Fig. 3c, Qprobe is shown separately; the contribution from the steady motion Qs and that from nonequilibrium
fluctuations around the steady motion Qv , which correspond to the first and second terms of the rhs of the Harada and
Sasa’s relation (2), respectively. Qs dominated Qv in the present experimental condition. An interesting observation
is that Qv as well as Qs increases linearly as the torque increases. The fraction of Qs and Qv are similar independent
of the torque magnitude except around the stalling state. The fraction of Qs seems higher around the stalling state.

4
However, since Qs and Qv are small at this region, more precise measurement is necessary to test this dependency.
The difference W = Wext − Qprobe is the work received by the motor (Fig. 4a). In the ATP-synthetic rotations, we
found that W = ∆µ over a broad range of torque, where ∆µ is the thermodynamic limit for the work necessary to
synthesize an ATP molecule. This implies that the motor’s internal dissipation Qmotor = W − ∆µ is negligible and
the F1 -motor can convert most of W to ∆µ even during rotations at a high rotational rate such as 50Hz. Note that
the rate of the proton-driven rotations of the thermophilic Fo F1 -ATP synthase is 3-4 Hz at saturated ADP and Pi
concentrations at a room temperature [20].
When the motor rotates in the ATP-hydrolytic direction under weak external torque, −W corresponds to the work
performed by the motor transferred to the probe. A part of −W is used to increase the potential of the probe against
load −Wext , and the remainder, Qprobe , dissipates. In Fig. 4a, we show that W is similar to −∆µ in good agreement
with a previous result [8] that the motor can consume ∆µ in the rotational degree of freedom with negligible internal
irreversible heat production even during rotations. However, we observed a small deviation of W from −∆µ at a
small torque magnitude (Fig. 4a inset), which was not observed in the previous experiment. W increased with torque
and reached ∆µ around the stalled state.
We also measured W of a mutant F1 -motor molecule with mutations around the nucleotide binding site (βT165S
and βY341W) and the β-subunit’s hinge region (βG181A) [7] (Fig. 3b and 4b). This mutant produced a smaller
maximum work than the wild-type, supposedly caused by weak binding of ATP [9]. Figure 4b shows that |W | is
significantly less than |∆µ|; the mutant produces a finite amount of internal dissipation.
Discussion

Here we evaluated the energetics of the free-energy conversion by the F1 -motor during rotations far from a quasistatic process in mechanical-to-chemical and chemical-to-mechanical energy transduction. This was achieved by
combining a single molecule response measurement mimicking the mechanical coupling of Fo F1 -ATP synthase with
a nonequilibrium theory. Our main finding is that, in the ATP-synthetic rotations, the internal dissipation from the
motor is negligible even during rotations far from a quasistatic process. In the ATP-hydrolytic rotations, we observed
a finite amount of the internal dissipation from the motor, which was not observed in the previous experiment.
In case the probe and the γ-shaft are thermally insulated in that the heat transfer between them is negligible,
∆µ/W ≤ 1 in the ATP synthesis and W/∆µ ≤ 1 in the ATP hydrolysis because ∆µ is the thermodynamic limit for
the work necessary to synthesize an ATP molecule and the thermodynamic limit for the work extractable from an
ATP hydrolysis. If this is the case, the present results, ∆µ ≃ W in both the ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis, imply
that the F1 -motor is a highly efficient motor working at almost 100% efficiency even within finite-time. The thermal
insulation between the probe and the shaft is supposedly valid when the linker connecting the probe and the shaft is
sufficiently flexible and ∆µ and ATP concentration are not extremely small[21, 22] although detailed simulations with

5
explicit separation of the degrees of freedom of the motor and probe are necessary to deduce the exact conditions.
Otherwise, the probe and the γ-shaft move in tandem to some extent and the heat dissipated from the system cannot
be separated well into Qmotor and Qprobe ; for example, a part of the energy absorbed by the motor to overcome an
energy barrier for a chemical reaction may dissipate through the probe’s motion as a part of Qprobe . W evaluated by
(1) is no longer work that is transferred to the motor, and ∆µ/W can be greater than 1 [21–23]. The spring constant
of the linker is measured in ref[24] although their probe is different from this work. We expect that future detailed
simulation will reveal the implications of the intriguing balance ∆µ ≃ W obtained in this work.
In the present study, we assumed tight coupling between ATP synthesis/hydrolysis and the 120◦ rotation and
compared W with ∆µ to assess the efficiency. Although, the 120◦ rotational step and the ATP hydrolysis are tightly
coupled [2, 4], this has yet to be firmly established for ATP synthesis. The results of a pioneering experiment on the
forced rotations of the γ shaft that were induced using magnetic tweezers imply that less than one ATP molecule is
synthesized in each 120◦ synthetic-direction rotation [2]. In that study, the tweezers were rotated at a high rate of
10 Hz. Magnetic tweezers impose a trapping force, in contrast to the constant torque imposed by the electrorotation
method. At a high manipulation rate the angular positions of the probe and tweezers can be apart. Then, magnetic
tweezers can impose a very strong torque, which may induce slippage of the mechanochemical coupling. The results of
a more recent experiment using magnetic tweezers manipulated at a low rate of 0.05-0.8 Hz suggests that attachment
and detachment of nucleotides and the angular position of the γ shaft are tightly coupled [25]. Further, the previous
result showing that the maximum work of the F1 -motor is similar to ∆µ over a broad range of ∆µ, suggests tight
coupling [9]. The mutant’s finite internal dissipation implies that it fails to completely couple mechanical rotation and
ATP hydrolysis and synthesis. Some externally-forced mechanical steps may not accompany ATP-synthetic reactions,
and some ATP hydrolytic reactions may not accompany mechanical steps.
Macroscopic engines operated at a finite rate inevitably generates turbulence, and additional energy dissipates
through microscopic degrees of freedom as irreversible heat. In contrast, the F1 -motor is itself microscopic and
possibly utilizes thermal fluctuations. Therefore, some of the microscopic degrees of freedom might not be hidden and
are accessible to the F1 -motor. In the ATP-hydrolytic rotations, previous studies suggest that the F1 -motor shifts
the mechanical potentials discontinuously depending on the γ-shaft’s angular position [10, 26]. Only by nanosized
machines can perform such an operation to minimize irreversible heat within a finite-time. This highlights the
remarkable property of nanosized engines. Further studies will be required to elucidate the molecular mechanism of
the highly efficient mechanochemical couplings of ATP-synthetic rotations.
Materials and methods

Single molecule response measurement. The experimental setup is essentially the same as that in the previous
studies [8–10, 14]. F1 molecules derived from a thermophilic Bacillus PS3 with mutations for the rotation assay

6
(His6 -αC193S/W463F, His10 -β, γS107C/I210C, denoted as wild type) [2] or a mutant with βT165S, βY341W, and
βG181A[7] were adhered on a cover slip functionalized by Ni2+ -NTA. Rotations of the γ shaft were probed by
streptavidin-coated dimeric polystyrene particles (diameter = 300 nm, Seradyn) attached to the biotinylated γ shaft
in a buffer containing 5 mM MOPS/KOH, 10 µM MgATP, 10 µM MgADP, 1 mM Pi, and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 6.9).
Observation was performed on a phase-contrast upright microscope (Olympus) with a 100× objective and a high-speed
camera (Basler) at 2,000 Hz. The data including a long pause presumably due to the MgADP-inhibited state are
excluded from the analysis. We applied torque on the probe by using rotating electric field at 15 MHz generated with
the quadrupolar electrodes patterned on the glass surface of the chamber [8, 9, 12, 13, 27]. The torque magnitude was
controlled by controlling the electrodes voltage. In Fig. 3 and 4, 69 points of 19 wild-type molecules and 20 points of
9 mutant molecules are shown.
Fluctuation, response, and Harada-Sasa equality. Let C(t) = h[v(t) − vs ] [v(0) − vs ]i and R(t) be the fluctuation
and the response function against small external torque, respectively, of the probe’s rotational rate v(t) around the
R∞
mean rotational rate vs . R(t) is defined as hv(t) − vs iN = −∞ dsR(t − s)N (s), where h·iN is the ensemble average
under a sufficiently small probe torque N (t). Because of the causality, R(t) = 0 if t < 0. Around an equilibrium state,

C(t) and R(t) are related by the fluctuation response relation (FRR): C(t) = kB T R(t) [19]. The FRR is generally
violated far from equilibrium. The equality by Harada and Sasa relates the extent of the FRR violation to heat
dissipation at a nonequilibrium steady state [16–18]. In the frequency space, the equality is expressed as

where C̃(f ) and R̃(f ) are the Fourier transforms of C(t) and R(t), respectively, at frequency f , and R̃′ (f ) is the

steady rotations and that through nonequilibrium fluctuations in a 120◦ rotation. This relation is valid in the

systems described by Markovian Langevin equations. The FRR becomes C̃(f ) = 2kB T R̃′ (f ) in the frequency space,
Γ is the rotational frictional coefficient, and 3vs is the mean stepping rate that corresponds to the rate of ATP
hydrolysis or synthesis. C̃(f ) was calculated from the rotational trajectories by a fast Fourier transform method
and Wiener-Khintchine theorem. Γ was obtained by taking the average of C̃(f ) around 300 Hz since the FRR,
limf →∞ C̃(f ) = 2kB T /Γ, is supposed to hold in such a high frequency region [8, 9]. Γ was 0.075±0.012 kB T s/rad2
P
(mean±SD, N=70). For evaluating R̃(f ), we added a small torque N (t) = N0 i sin(2πfi t) , where fi = 1, 4, 10,
20, 40, 80, 160, 250, and 400 Hz, in addition to the constant load. N0 is unknown a priori. We measured hv(t)iN ,

performed a Fourier transform, and obtained R(fi ) N0 at multiple frequencies fi . Then, we obtained N0 by comparing
C̃(f ) and R̃(f )N0 around at high frequency regions because of the FRR [8, 9]. The frequency regions for calibration
were determined by eye (around 300Hz typically). Finally, we obtained R(fi ). N0 was 0.94±0.19 kB T/rad (mean±SD,
N=70). We calculated the integration in (2) between -400 Hz and 400 Hz. The contribution from the outside of this
region is supposed to be negligible because of the FRR at high frequencies. We omitted data without apparent

7
convergence of C̃(f ) and R̃′ (f ) at the high frequency region (8 out of 78). When torque multiplied by 120◦ was
greater than 80 kB T , the FRR was violated at high frequencies even around 300 Hz, where the torque magnitude was
calibrated according to the FRR.

multiplied by 120◦ with the sign depending on the rotational direction, that is, positive in the ATP synthetic rotations and
negative in the ATP hydrolytic rotations. 69 points of 19 wild-type molecules and 20 points of 9 mutant molecules are shown.
We excluded one aberrant point due to the vanishingly small rotational rate from the graphs displayed in a (torque × 120◦ and
Qprobe are 20.0 kB T and -40.5 kB T , respectively). c, Amount of heat dissipation of wild-type molecules was separately plotted
as the heat contributed by the steady rotations Qs and by the nonequlibrium fluctuations Qv , which correspond to the first
and second terms of the rhs of the Harada-sasa equation (2), respectively. d, Fraction of Qs and Qv of wild-type molecules.

FIG. 4: Work performed on the motor for the wild type (a) and mutant (b). W = Wext − Qprobe . The linear fits of the curves
are −16.7 − 0.082x in the hydrolytic rotations (dashed line in the inset of a) and 18.2 + 0.00286x in the synthetic rotations (not
shown), where x is the torque multiplied by 120◦ . The dashed line in b was fitted by eye. We excluded one aberrant point as
noted in the caption of fig. 3.
