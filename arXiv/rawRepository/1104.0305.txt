Abstract
Experimental data have revealed that neuronal connection efficacy exhibits two forms
of short-term plasticity, namely, short-term depression (STD) and short-term facilitation
(STF). They have time constants residing between fast neural signaling and rapid learning, and may serve as substrates for neural systems manipulating temporal information on
relevant time scales. The present study investigates the impact of STD and STF on the dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) and their potential roles in neural
information processing. We find that STD endows the network with slow-decaying plateau
behaviors—the network that is initially being stimulated to an active state decays to a silent
state very slowly on the time scale of STD rather than on the time scale of neural signaling.
This provides a mechanism for neural systems to hold sensory memory easily and shut off
persistent activities gracefully. With STF, we find that the network can hold a memory trace
of external inputs in the facilitated neuronal interactions, which provides a way to stabilize
the network response to noisy inputs, leading to improved accuracy in population decoding.
Furthermore, we find that STD increases the mobility of the network states. The increased
mobility enhances the tracking performance of the network in response to time-varying stimuli, leading to anticipative neural responses. In general, we find that STD and STP tend to
have opposite effects on network dynamics and complementary computational advantages,
suggesting that the brain may employ a strategy of weighting them differentially depending
on the computational purpose.

Introduction

Experimental data have consistently revealed that the neuronal connection weight, which models the efficacy of the firing of a pre-synaptic neuron in modulating the state of a post-synaptic
one, varies on short time scales, ranging from hundreds to thousands of milliseconds (see, e.g.,

(Stevens and Wang 1995; Markram and Tsodyks 1996; Dobrunz and Stevens 1997; Markram, Wang, and Tsodyks
This is called short-term plasticity (STP). Two types of STP, with opposite effects on the connection efficacy, have been observed. They are short-term depression (STD) and short-term
facilitation (STF). STD is caused by the depletion of available resources when neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal of the pre-synaptic neuron during signal transmission
(Stevens and Wang 1995; Markram and Tsodyks 1996; Dayan and Abbott 2001). On the other
hand, STF is caused by the influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal after spike generation,
which increases the probability of releasing neurotransmitters.
Computational studies on the impact of STP on network dynamics have strongly suggested
that STP can play many important roles in neural computation. For instance, cortical neurons
receive pre-synaptic signals with firing rates ranging from less than 1 to more than 200 Hertz. It
was suggested that STD provides a dynamic gain control mechanism that allows equal fractional
changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce post-synaptic responses, realizing Weber’s law (Tsodyks and Markram 1997; Abbott, Varela, Sen, and Nelson 1997). Besides, computations can be performed in recurrent networks by population spikes in response to external inputs, which are enabled through STD by recurrent connections (Tsodyks, Uziel, and Markram 2000;
Loebel and Tsodyks 2002).
Another role played by synaptic depression was proposed by Levina, Herrmann, and Giesel
(2007). In neuronal systems, critical avalanches are believed to bring about optimal computational capabilities, and are observed experimentally. Synaptic depression enables a feedback
mechanism so that the system can be maintained at a critical state, making the self-organized
critical behavior robust (Levina, Herrmann, and Giesel 2007). Herding, a computational algorithm reminiscent of the neuronal dynamics with synaptic depression, was recently found to have
a similar effect on the complexity of information processing (Welling 2009). STP was also recently thought to play a role in the way a neuron estimates the membrane potential information
of the pre-synaptic neuron based on the spikes it receives (Pfister, Dayan, and Lengyel 2010).
Concerning the computational significance of STF, a recent work proposed an interesting idea
for achieving working memory in the prefrontal cortex (Mongillo, Barak, and Tsodyks 2008).
2

The residual calcium of STF is used as a buffer to facilitate synaptic connections, so that inputs
in a subsequent delay period can be used to retrieve the information encoded by the facilitated
synaptic connections. The STF-based memory mechanism has the advantage of not having to
rely on persistent neural firing during the time the working memory is functioning, and hence
is energetically more efficient.
From the computational point of view, the time scale of STP resides between fast neural
signaling (in the order of milliseconds) and rapid learning (in the order of minutes or above),
which is the time scale of many important temporal processes occurring in our daily lives, such
as the passive holding of a temporal memory of objects coming into our visual field (the so-called
iconic sensory memory), or the active use of the memory trace of recent events for motion control.
Thus, STP may serve as a substrate for neural systems manipulating temporal information on
the relevant time scales. STP has been observed in many parts of the cortex, and also exhibits
large diversity in different cortical areas, suggesting that the brain may employ a strategy of
weighting STD and STF differently depending on the computational purpose.
In the present study, we explore the potential roles of STP in processing information derived from external stimuli, an issue of fundamental importance yet inadequately investigated
so far. For ease of exposition, we use continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) as our
working model, but our main results are qualitatively applicable to general cases. CANNs are
recurrent networks that can hold a continuous family of localized active states (Amari 1977).
Neutral stability is a key property of CANNs, which enables neural systems to update memory states easily and to track time-varying stimuli smoothly. CANNs have been successfully
applied to describe the generation of persistent neural activities (Wang 2001), the encoding of
continuous stimuli such as the orientation, the head direction and the spatial location of objects
(Ben-Yishai, Lev Bar-Or, and Sompolinsky 1995; Zhang 1996; Samsonovich and McNaughton 1997),
and a framework for implementing efficient population decoding (Deneve, Latham, and Pouget 1999).
When STP is included in a CANN, the dynamics of the network is governed by two time
scales. The time constant of STP is much slower than that of neural signaling (100-1000 ms vs.
1-10 ms). The interplay between the fast and the slow dynamics causes the network to exhibit
rich dynamical behaviors, laying the foundation for the neural system to implement complicated
functions.
In CANNs with STD, various intrinsic behaviors have been reported, including damped oscil-

lations (Tsodyks, Pawelzik, and Markram 1998), periodic and aperiodic dynamics (Tsodyks, Pawelzik, and Markra

state hopping with transient population spikes (Holcman and Tsodyks 2006), traveling fronts
and pulses (Pinto and Ermentrout 2001; Bressloff, Folias, Prat, and Li 2003; Folias and Bressloff 2004;
Kilpatrick and Bressloff 2010), breathers and pulse-emitting breathers (Bressloff, Folias, Prat, and Li 2003;
Folias and Bressloff 2004), spiral waves (Kilpatrick and Bressloff 2009), rotating bump states
(York and van Rossum 2009; Igarashi, Oizumi, Otsubo, Nagata, and Okada 2009), and self-sustained
non-periodic activities (Stratton and Wiles 2010). Here, we focus on those network states relevant to the processing of stimuli in CANNs, including static, moving and metastatic bumps
(Wu and Amari 2005; Fung, Wong, and Wu 2010). More significantly, we find that with STD,
the network state can display slow-decaying plateau behaviors, i.e., the network that is initially
being stimulated to an active state by a transient input decays to the silent state very slowly on
the time scale of STD relaxation, rather than on the time scale of neural signaling. This is a very
interesting property. It implies that STD can provide a way for the neural system to maintain
sensory memory for a duration unachievable by the signaling of single neurons, and shut off the
network activity of sensory memory naturally. The latter has once been a challenging technical issue in the study of theoretical neuroscience (Gutkin, Laing, Colby, Chow, and Ermentrout 2001).
With STF, neuronal connections become strengthened during the presence of an external
stimulus. This stimulus-specific facilitation lasts for a period on the time scale of STF, and provides a way for the neural system to hold a memory trace of external inputs (Mongillo, Barak, and Tsodyks 2008).
This information can be used by the neural system for various computational tasks. To demonstrate this idea, we consider CANNs as a framework for implementing population decoding
(Deneve, Latham, and Pouget 1999; Wu, Amari, and Nakahara 2002). In the presence of STF,
the network response is determined not only by the instant input value but also by the history
of external inputs (the latter being mediated by the facilitated neuronal interactions). Therefore, temporal fluctuations in external inputs can be largely averaged out, leading to improved
decoding results.

In general, STD and STF tend to have opposite effects on network dynamics (Torres, Cortes, Marro, and Kappen
The former increases the mobility of network states, whereas the latter increases their stability. Enhanced mobility and stability can contribute positively to different computational tasks.
Enhanced stability mediated by STF can improve the computational and behavioral stability of CANNs. To demonstrate that enhanced mobility does have a positive role in information processing, we investigate a computational task in which the network tracks time-varying
stimuli. We find that STD increases the tracking speed of a CANN. Interestingly, for strong

4

STD, the network state can even overtake the moving stimulus, reminiscent of the anticipative responses of head-direction and place cells (Blair and Sharp 1995; O’Keefe and Recce 1993;
Romani and Tsodyks 2011).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. After introducing the models and methods in
Section 2, we discuss the intrinsic properties of CANNs in the absence of external stimuli by
studying their phase diagram in Section 3. In Sections 4 to 6, we study the network behavior in
the presence of various stimuli. In Section 4, we consider the after-effects of a transient stimulus,
and find that sensory memories can persist for a desirable duration and then decay gracefully.
In Section 5, we consider the response of the network to a noisy stimulus, and find that the
accuracy in population decoding can be enhanced. In Section 6, we consider the response of
the network to a moving stimulus, and find that the tracking performance is improved by the
enhanced mobility of the network states. The paper ends with conclusions and discussions in
Section 7. Our preliminary results on the effects of STD have been reported in Fung, Wong,
Wang, and Wu (2010).

Models and Methods

We consider a one-dimensional continuous stimulus x encoded by an ensemble of neurons. For
example, the stimulus may represent a moving direction, an orientation or a general continuous
feature of objects extracted by the neural system. We consider the case where the range of
possible values of the stimulus is much larger than the range of neuronal interactions. We can
thus effectively take x ∈ (−∞, ∞) in our analysis. In simulations, however, we will set the
stimulus range to be −L/2 < x ≤ L/2, and have N neurons uniformly distributed in the range
obeying a periodic boundary condition.
Let u(x, t) be the current at time t in the neurons whose preferred stimulus is x. The
dynamics of u(x, t) is determined by the external input I ext (x, t), the network input from other
neurons, and its own relaxation. It is given by

where τs is the synaptic time constant, which is typically of the order of 2 to 5 ms, and ρ the
neural density. r(x, t) is the firing rate of neurons, which increases with the synaptic input, but
saturates in the presence of global activity-dependent inhibition. A solvable model that captures
these features is given by Deneve, Latham, and Pouget (1999) and Wu, Amari, and Nakahara

where k is a positive constant controlling the strength of global inhibition and Cr is a constant
whose dimension is r (x, t) u (x, t)−2 . This type of global inhibition can be achieved by shunting
inhibition (Heeger 1992; Hao, Wang, Dan, Poo, and Zhang 2009).
J(x, x′ ) is the baseline neural interaction from x′ to x when no STP exists. In our solvable
model, we choose J(x, x′ ) to be of the Gaussian form with an interaction range a, i.e.,


(3)

where J0 is a constant. J(x, x′ ) is translationally invariant, in the sense that it is a function of
x − x′ rather than x or x′ . This is the key to generating the neutral stability of CANNs.
The variable p(x, t) represents the pre-synaptic STD effect, which has the maximum value
of 1 and decreases with the firing rate of the neurons (Tsodyks, Pawelzik, and Markram 1998;
Zucker and Regehr 2002). Its dynamics is given by
τd

∂p(x, t)
= 1 − p(x, t) − τd βp(x, t)[1 + f (x, t)]r(x, t),
∂t

(4)

where τd is the time constant for synaptic depression, and the parameter β controls the depression
effect due to neuronal firing.
The variable f (x, t) represents the pre-synaptic STF effect, which increases with the firing
rate of the neurons but saturates at a maximum value fmax . Its dynamics is given by
τf

∂f (x, t)
= −f (x, t) + τf α [fmax − f (x, t)] r(x, t),
∂t

(5)

where τf is the time constant for synaptic facilitation, and the parameter α controls the facilitation effect due to neuronal firing.
The dynamical equations (4) and (5) are consistent with the phenomenological models of STD
and STF fitted to experimental data (Tsodyks, Pawelzik, and Markram 1998) (see Appendix A).
From Eqs.(4) and (5), we can calculate the steady state values of p and f , which are
p =
f

=

1
,
1 + τd β(1 + f )r
fmax τf αr
.
1 + τf αr

(6)
(7)

Hence, in the high frequency limit, τf αr ≫ 1, we have f ≈ fmax , which can be regarded as a
constant, and p = 1/ [1 + τd β(1 + fmax )r]. In this case, we only have to consider the effect of
6

STD. In the low frequency limit, τd β(1 + f )r ≪ 1, and so p ≈ 1 and we only need to consider the
effect of STF. Note, however, that the terms “high frequency limit” and “low frequency limit”
are used figuratively. The actual limits should depend on the other parameters mentioned above.
Our theoretical analysis of the network dynamics is based on the observations that: 1) the
stationary states of the network, as well as the profile of STP across all neurons, can be well
approximated as Gaussian-shaped bumps; and 2) the state change of the network, and hence the
profile of STP, can be well described by distortions of the Gaussian bump in various forms. We
can therefore use a perturbation approach developed by Fung, Wong, and Wu (2010) to solve
the network dynamics analytically.
It is instructive for us to first review the network dynamics when no STP is included. This
is done by setting β = 0 in Eq. (4) and α = 0 in Eq. (5), so that p(x, t) = 1 and f (x, t) = 0 for
all t. In this case, the network can support a continuous family of stationary states when the
global inhibition is not too strong. These steady states are

ρ (Cr J0 )2 /(8a 2π). These stationary states are translationally invariant among themselves and
have the Gaussian shape with a free parameter z representing the peak position of the Gaussian
bumps. They exist for 0 < k < kc , and kc is the critical inhibition strength above which only
silent states with u0 = 0 exist.
Because of the translational invariance of the neuronal interactions, the dynamics of CANNs
exhibits unique features. Fung, Wong, and Wu (2010) have shown that the wave functions of the
quantum harmonic oscillators can well describe the different distortion modes of a bump state.
For instance, during the process of tracking an external stimulus, the synaptic input u(x, t) can
be written as

can use a perturbation approach to solve the network dynamics effectively, with each distortion
mode characterized by an eigenvalue determining its rate of evolution in time. A key property of
CANNs is that the translational mode has a zero eigenvalue, and all other distortion modes have
negative eigenvalues for k < kc . This implies that the Gaussian bumps are able to track changes
in the position of the external stimuli by continuously shifting the position of the bumps, with
other distortion modes affecting the tracking process only in the transients. An example of the
tracking process is shown in Fig. 2, where we consider an external stimulus with a Gaussian
profile given by

(12)

The stimulus is initially centered at z = 0, pinning the center of a Gaussian neuronal response
at the same position. At time t = 0, the stimulus shifts its center from z0 = 0 to z0 = 3a
abruptly. The bump moves towards the new stimulus position, and catches up with the shift of
the stimulus after a certain time, referred to as the reaction time.
We can generalize the perturbation approach developed by Fung, Wong, and Wu (2010)
to study the dynamics of CANNs with dynamical synapses. We will only present the detailed
analysis to the case of STD. Extension to the case of STF is straightforward.
Similar to the synaptic input u(x, t), the profile of STD can be expanded in terms of the

Truncating the perturbation expansion at increasingly high orders corresponds to the inclusion of increasingly complex distortions, and hence provides increasingly accurate descriptions
of the network dynamics. As confirmed in the subsequent sections, the perturbative approach
is in excellent agreement with simulation results. The agreement is especially remarkable when
the STD strength is weak, and the lowest few orders are already sufficient to explain the dynamical features. The agreement is less satisfactory when STD is strong, and the perturbative
approach typically over-estimates the stability of the moving bump. This is probably due to the
considerable distortion of the Gaussian profile of the synaptic depression when STD is strong.

Phase Diagrams of CANNs with STP

We first study the impact of STP on the stationary states of CANNs when no external input is
applied. For the convenience of analysis, we will explore the effects of STD and STF separately.
This corresponds to the limits of high or low neuronal firing frequencies, or the cases where only
one type of STP dynamics is significant.

3.1

The Phase Diagram of CANNs with STD

We set α = 0 in Eq. (5) to turn off STF. In the presence of STD, CANNs exhibit new and
interesting dynamical behaviors. Apart from the static bump state, the network also supports
spontaneously moving bump states. Examining the steady state solutions of Eqs. (1) and (4),
we find that u0 has the same dimension as ρCr J0 u20 , and 1 − p(x, t) scales as τd βu20 . Hence we

introduce the dimensionless parameters k ≡ k/kc and β ≡ τd β/(ρ2 (Cr J0 )2 ). The phase diagram
obtained by numerical solutions to the network dynamics is shown in Fig. 3.

perturbation of the STD coefficient. Point P: the working point for Figs. 6 and 7. Parameters:
τd /τs = 50, a = 0.5/6, range of the network x ∈ [−π, π).
We first note that the synaptic depression and the global inhibition play the same role in
reducing the amplitude of the bump states. This can be seen from the steady state solution of

(16)

The third term in the denominator of the integrand arises from STD, and plays the role of a
local inhibition that is strongest where the neurons are most active. Hence we see that the silent
state with u(x, t) = 0 is the only stable state when either k or β is large.
When STD is weak, the network behaves similarly to CANNs without STD, that is, the
static bump state is present up to k near 1. However, when β increases, a state with the
bump spontaneously moving at a constant velocity comes into existence. Such moving states
have been predicted in CANNs (York and van Rossum 2009; Kilpatrick and Bressloff 2010),
and may be associated with the travelling wave behaviors widely observed in the neocortex (Wu, Huang, and Zhang 2008). At an intermediate range of β, the static and moving states
coexist, and the final state of the network depends on the initial condition. As β increases
further, static bumps disappear. In the limit of high β, only the silent state is present. Below,
we will use the perturbation approach to analyze the network dynamical behaviors.
3.1.1

Zeroth Order: The Static Bump

The zeroth order perturbation is applicable to the solution of the static bump, since the profile
of the bump remains effectively Gaussian in the presence of synaptic depression. Hence, when
STD is weak and for a ≪ L, we propose the following Gaussian approximations,

when p0 is the steady state solution of Eqs. (19) and (20). The boundary of this region is
shown as a dashed line in Fig. 3. Unfortunately, this line is not easily observed in numerical
solutions since the static bump is unstable against fluctuations that are asymmetric with respect
to its central position. Although the bump is stable against symmetric fluctuations, asymmetric
fluctuations can displace its position and eventually convert it to a moving bump. This will be
considered in the first-order perturbation in the next subsection.
3.1.2

First Order: The Moving Bump

When the network bump is moving, the profile of STD is lagging behind due to its slow dynamics,
and this induces an asymmetric distortion in the profile of STD. Fig. 4 illustrates this behavior.
Comparing the static and moving bumps shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), one can see that the profile
of a moving bump is characterized by the synaptic depression lagging behind the moving bump.
This is because neurons tend to be less active in the locations of low values of p(x, t), causing
the bump to move away from the locations of strong synaptic depression. In turn, the region of
synaptic depression tends to follow the bump. However, if the time scale of synaptic depression
is large, the recovery of the synaptic depressed region will be slowed down, and the region will
be unable to catch up with the bump motion. Thus, the bump will start moving spontaneously.
This is the same cause attributed to anticipative non-local events modeled in neural systems
(Blair and Sharp 1995; O’Keefe and Recce 1993; Romani and Tsodyks 2011).

To incorporate this asymmetry into the network dynamics, we consider the first-order per12

This means that we have restricted the bump profile to the zeroth order. Comparison with the
full first-order perturbation shows that the discrepancy is not significant. This is because the
synaptic interactions among the neurons effectively maintain the bump profile in a Gaussian
shape, whereas the STD profile is much more susceptible to asymmetric perturbations.
As described in Appendix D, we obtain four steady-state equations for u/B, p0 , p1 and vτs /a
in terms of the parameters βu2 /B and τs /τd , where B ≡ 1+ku2 /8 is the global inhibition factor.
It is easy to first check if the static bump obtained in Appendix D is also a valid solution by
setting v and p1 to 0. We can then study the stability of the static bump against asymmetric
fluctuations. This is done by introducing small values of p1 and vτs /a into the static bump
solution and considering how they evolve. As shown in Appendix D the static bump becomes
unstable when

where Q = 7 7/4, R = (7/4)[(5/2) 7/6 − 1], and S = (343/36)(1 − 6/7). This means
that in the region bounded by Eqs. (21) and (24), the static bump is unstable to asymmetric

fluctuations. It is stable (or more precisely, metastable) when it is static, but once it is pushed
to one side, it will continue to move along that direction. We call this behavior metastatic. As
we shall see, this metastatic behavior is the cause of the enhanced tracking performance.
Next, we consider solutions with non-vanishing p1 and v. We find that real solutions exist
only if condition (24) is satisfied. This means that as soon as the static bump becomes unstable,
the moving bump comes into existence. As shown in Fig. 3, the boundary of this region
effectively coincides with the numerical solution of the line separating the static and moving
phases. In the entire region bounded by Eqs. (21) and (24), the moving and (meta)static bumps
coexist.
We also find that when τd /τs increases, the moving phase expands at the expense of the
(pure) static phase. This is because the recovery of the synaptic depressed region becomes
increasingly slow, making it harder for the region to catch up with the changes in the bump
motion, hence sustaining the bump motion.

The Phase Diagram of CANNs with STF

We set β = 0 in Eq. (4) to turn off STD. Compared with STD, STF has qualitatively the opposite
effect on the network dynamics. When an external perturbation is applied, the dynamical
synapses will not push the neural bump away. Instead they will try to pull the bump back
to its original position. The phase diagram in the space of k and the rescaled STF parameter
α ≡ τf α/(ρ2 (Cr J0 )2 ) is shown in Fig. 5. When α increases, the range of inhibitory strength k
allowing for a bump state is enlarged. Note that since STF tends to stabilize the bump states
against asymmetric fluctuations, no moving bumps exist. The phase boundary of the static
bump is well predicted by the second-order perturbation.

Concerning the time scale of neural information processing, it should be noted that it takes
time of the order of τf for neuronal interactions to be fully facilitated. In the parameter range
of k > 1 where the facilitated neuronal interaction is necessary for holding a bump state, we
need to present an external input for a time up to the order of τf before a bump state can be
sustained.

Memories with Graceful Degradation in CANNs with STD

We consider the response of the network to a transient stimulus given by

I (x, t) = A (t) exp −

(25)

Here A (t) is non-zero for some duration before t = 0, so that a bump is rapidly formed, but
A (t) vanishes after t = 0.
The network dynamics displays a very interesting behavior in the marginally unstable region
of the static bump. In this regime, the static bump solution barely loses its stability. The
bump is stable if the level of synaptic depression is low, but unstable at high levels. Since
the STD time scale is much longer than the synaptic time scale, a bump can exist before the
synaptic depression becomes effective. This maintains the bump in the plateau state with a
slowly decaying amplitude, as shown in Fig. 6(a). After a time duration of the order of τd ,
the STD strength becomes sufficiently significant, as shown in Fig. 6(b), and the bump state
eventually decays to the silent state.

First Order: Trajectory Analysis

It is instructive to analyze the plateau behavior first by using the first-order perturbation. We
select a point in the marginally unstable regime of the silent phase, that is, in the vicinity of
the static phase. As shown in Fig. 7, the nullclines of u and p0 (du/dt = 0 and dp0 /dt = 0

15

respectively) do not have any intersections as they do in the static phase where the bump state
exists. Yet, they are still close enough to create a region with very slow dynamics near the apex
√
p
of the u-nullcline at (u, p0 ) = [(8/k)1/2 , 7/4(1 − k)]. Then, in Fig. 7, we plot the trajectories

of the dynamics starting from different initial conditions.

are data points spaced at time intervals of 2τs . Parameter: τd /τs = 50.

The most interesting family of trajectories is represented by B and C in Fig. 7. Due to the
much faster dynamics of u, trajectories starting from a wide range of initial conditions converge
rapidly, in a time of the order of τs , to a common trajectory in the vicinity of the u-nullcline.
Along this common trajectory, u is effectively the steady state solution of Eq. (19) at the
instantaneous value of p0 (t), which evolves with the much longer time scale of τd . This gives rise
to the plateau region of u which can survive for a duration of the order of τd . The plateau ends
after the trajectory has passed the slow region near the apex of the u-nullcline. This dynamics
is in clear contrast with trajectory D, in which the bump height decays to zero in a time of the
order of τs .
Trajectory A represents another family of trajectories having rather similar behaviors, although the lifetimes of their plateaus are not so long. These trajectories start from more depleted
initial conditions, and hence do not have the chance to get close to the u-nullcline. Nevertheless,
they converge rapidly, in a time of the order of τs , to the band u ≈ (8/k)1/2 , where the dynamics
of u is slow. The trajectories then rely mainly on the dynamics of p0 to carry them out of this

16

slow region, and hence plateaus with lifetimes of the order of τd are created.
Following similar arguments, the plateau behavior also exists in the stable region of the
static states. This happens when the initial condition of the network lies outside the basin of
attraction of the static states, but still in the vicinity of the basin boundary.

Figure 8: Contours of plateau lifetimes in the space of k and β. The lines are the two topmost
phase boundaries in Fig. 3. In the initial condition, A = 4.82843.

When one goes deeper into the silent phase, the region of slow dynamics between the u- and
p0 -nullclines broadens. Hence plateau lifetimes are longest near the phase boundary between
the bump and silent states, and become shorter when one goes deeper into the silent phase.
This is confirmed by the contours of plateau lifetimes in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 8
obtained numerically. The initial condition is uniformly set by introducing an external stimulus
I ext (x|z0 ) = A exp[−x2 /(4a2 )] to the right hand side of Eq. (1), where A is the stimulus
strength. After the network has reached a steady state, the stimulus is removed at t = 0,
leaving the network to relax. It is observed in Fig. 8 that the plateau behavior can be found in
an extensive region of the parameter space.

4.2

Second Order: Lifetime Analysis

As shown in Fig. 6, the first-order perturbation over-estimates the stability of the plateau state,
yielding lifetimes longer than the simulation results. The main reason is that the width of
the synaptic depression profile is constrained to be a constant in the first-order perturbation.
However, the synaptic depression profile is broader than the bump. This can be seen from Eq.

17

(4), rewritten as


∂p(x, t)
τd βr(x, t)
τd
= [1 + τd βr (x, t)] 1 − p(x, t) −
,
∂t
1 + τd βr(x, t)

(26)

This shows that the neurotransmitter loss, 1 − p(x, t), relaxes towards an expression consisting
of the Gaussian r(x, t), normalized by the factor 1 + τd βr(x, t). This normalization factor is
smaller where the firing rate is low, so that the profile of 1 − p(x, t) is broader than the firing
rate profile r(x, t).
To incorporate the effects of a broadened STD profile, we introduce the second-order perturbation. Dynamical equations are obtained by truncating the equations beyond the second order.
As shown in Fig. 6, the second-order perturbation yields a much more satisfactory agreement
with simulation results than do lower order perturbations.

Decoding with Enhanced Accuracy in CANNs with STF

CANNs have been interpreted as an efficient framework for neural systems implementing population decoding (Deneve, Latham, and Pouget 1999; Wu, Amari, and Nakahara 2002). Consider
the reading-out of an external feature z0 from noisy inputs by CANNs. For example, z0 may
represent the moving direction of an object. In the decoding paradigm, a CANN responds to
an external input I ext (x) with a bump state r(x|ẑ), where the peak position of the bump ẑ is
interpreted as the decoding result of the network.
In the presence of STF, neuronal connections are facilitated around the area where neurons
are most active. With this additional feature, the network decoding will be determined not only
by the instantaneous input, but also by the recent history of external inputs. Consequently,
temporal fluctuations in external inputs are largely averaged out, leading to improved decoding
accuracies.
We consider an external input given by
I

ext

#
(x − z0 − η(t)) 2

(27)

where z0 represents the true stimulus value, and η(t) white noise of zero mean and satisfies
hη(t)η(t′ )i = 2T a2 τs δ(t − t′ ) with T denoting the noise strength.
In the presence of weak noise, the position of the bump state is found to be centered at
z0 + s(t), where s(t) is the deviation of the center of mass of the bump from the position of
stimulus z0 , as derived in Appendix E. Hence, the decoding error of the network is measured by
18

the variance of the bump position over time, namely, hs(t)2 i. Fig. 9 shows the typical decoding
performance of the network with and without STF. We see that with STF, the fluctuation of the
bump position is reduced significantly. Fig. 10 compares the theoretical and measured decoding
errors in different noise strengths (see Appendix E).

Tracking with Enhanced Mobility in CANNs with STD

A key property of CANNs is their capacity to track time-varying stimuli, which lays the foundation for CANNs to implement spatial navigation, population decoding, and to update headdirection memory. To investigate the tracking performance of CANNs, we consider

where the stimulus position z0 (t) is time dependent.
We first investigate the impact of STD, and consider a tracking task in which the z0 (t)
abruptly changes from 0 at t = 0 to a new value at t = 0. Fig. 11 shows the network responses
during the tracking process. Compared with the case without STD, we find that the bump shifts
to the new position faster. When β is too strong, the bump may overshoot the target before
eventually approaching it. As remarked previously, this is due to the metastatic behavior of
the bumps, which enhances their readiness to move from the static state when a small push is
exerted.

We also study the tracking of an external stimulus moving with a constant velocity v, that is,
z0 (t) changes from 0 to vt at t = 0. As shown in Fig. 12(a), when STD is weak, the initial speed
of the bump is almost zero. Then, when the stimulus is moving away, the bump accelerates in
an attempt to catch up with the stimulus. After some time, the separation between the bump
and the stimulus converges to a constant. This tracking behavior is similar to the case without
STD. The tracking behavior in the case of strong STD is more interesting. As shown in Fig.
12(b), the bump position eventually overtakes the stimulus, displaying an anticipative behavior.
This can be attributed to the metastatic property of STD.
We further explore how STF affects the tracking performance of CANNs. In general, there is
a trade-off between the stability of network states and the capacity of the network to track timevarying stimuli. Since STD and STF have opposite effects on the mobility of the network states,
we expect that they will also have opposite impacts on the tracking performance of CANNs.
Indeed, STF degrades the tracking performance of CANNs (see Fig. 13). The larger the STF
strength, the slower the tracking speed of the network.

namics using successive orders of perturbation. The perturbation analysis works well when STD
is not too strong, although it over-estimates the stability of the bumps when STD is strong.
The zeroth order analysis accounts for the Gaussian shape of the bump, and hence can predict
the boundary of the static phase satisfactory. The first-order analysis includes the displacement
mode and asymmetry with respect to the bump peak, and hence can describe the onset of the
moving phase. Furthermore, it provides insights on the metastatic nature of the bumps and its
relation with the enhanced tracking performance. The second-order analysis further includes
the width distortions, and hence improves the prediction of the boundary of the moving phase,
as well as the lifetimes of the plateau states. Higher-order perturbations are required to yield
more accurate descriptions of results such as the overshooting in the tracking process. We anticipate that the perturbation analysis will also be useful in many other population decoding
problems, such as in quantifying the deformation of tuning curves due to neural adaptation
(Cortes, Marinazzo, Series, Oram, Sejnowski, and van Rossum 2011).
More importantly, our work reveals a number of interesting behaviors which may have farreaching implications in neural computation.
First, STD endows CANNs with slow-decaying behaviors. When a network is initially stimulated to an active state by an external input, it will decay to the silent state very slowly after

the input is removed. The duration of the plateau is of the time scale of STD rather than of
neural signaling. This provides a way for the network to hold the stimulus information for up
to hundreds of milliseconds, if the network operates in the parameter regime where the bumps
are marginally unstable. This property is, on the other hand, extremely difficult to implement
in attractor networks without STD. In a CANN without STD, an active state of the network
will either decay to the silent state exponentially fast or be retained forever, depending on the
initial activity level of the network. Indeed, how to shut off the activity of a CANN gracefully
has been a challenging issue that has received wide attention in theoretical neuroscience, with
researchers suggesting that a strong external input either in the form of inhibition or excitation
must be applied (see, e.g., Gutkin, Laing, Colby, Chow, and Ermentrout (2001)). Here, we have
shown that in certain circumstances, STD can provide a mechanism for closing down network
activities naturally and after a desirable duration. Taking into account the time scale of STD
(in the order of 100 ms) and the passive nature of its dynamics, the STD-based memory is most
likely associated with the sensory memory of the brain, e.g., the iconic and the echoic memories
(Baddeley 1999).
Second, with STD, CANNs can support both static and moving bumps. Static bumps exist
only when the synaptic depression is sufficiently weak. A consequence of synaptic depression is
that static bumps are placed in the metastatic state, so that its response to changing stimuli
is speeded up, enhancing its tracking performance. The states of moving bumps may be associated with the travelling wave behaviors widely observed in the neurocortex. We have also
observed that for strong STD, the network state can even overtake the moving stimulus, reminiscent of the anticipative responses of head-direction and place cells (Blair and Sharp 1995;

O’Keefe and Recce 1993). It is interesting to note that this occurs in the parameter range
where the network holds spontaneous moving bump solutions, suggesting that travelling wave
phenomena may be closely related to the predicting capacity of neural systems.
Third, STF improves the decoding accuracy of CANNs. When an external stimulus is
presented, STF strengthens the interactions among neurons which are tuned to the stimulus.
This stimulus-specific facilitation provides a mechanism for the network to hold a memory trace
of external inputs up to the time scale of STF, and this information can be used by the neural
system for executing various memory-based operations, such as operating the working memory.
We have tested this idea in a population decoding task, and found that the error is indeed
decreased. This is due to the determination of the network response by both the instantaneous
value and the history of external inputs, which effectively averages out temporal fluctuations.
These computational advantages of dynamical synapses lead to the following implications
for the modeling of neural systems. First, it sheds some light on the long-standing debate in
the field about the instability of CANNs in the presence of noise. Two aspects of instability have been identified (Wu and Amari 2005; Seung, Lee, Reis, and Tank 2000). One is the
structural instability, which refers to the argument that network components in reality, such
as the neuronal synapses, are unlikely to be as perfect as mathematically required in CANNs.
A small amount of discrepancy in the network structure can destroy the state space considerably, destabilizing the bump state after the stimulus is removed. The other instability refers to

23

the computational sensitivity of the network to input noises. Because of neutral stability, the
bump position is very susceptible to fluctuations in external inputs, rendering the network decoding unreliable. We have shown that STF can largely improve the computational robustness
of CANNs by averaging out the temporal fluctuations in inputs. Similarly, STF can overcome
the structural susceptibility of CANNs. With STF, the neuronal connections around the bump
area are strengthened temporally, which effectively stabilizes the bump on the time scale of
STF (Tsodyks and Hansel 2011). Another mechanism in a similar spirit is the reduction of the
inhibition strength around the bump area (Carter and Wang 2007).
Second, STD and STF should be dominant in different areas of the brain. We have investigated the impact of STD and STF on the tracking performance of CANNs. There is, in general,
a trade-off between the stability of bump states and the tracking performance of the network.
STD increases the mobility of bump states and hence the tracking speed of the network, whereas
STF has the opposite effect. These differences predict that in cortical areas where time-varying
stimuli, such as the head direction and the moving direction of objects, are encoded, STD should
have a stronger effect than STF. On the other hand, in cortical areas where the robustness of
bump states, i.e., the decoding accuracy of stimuli, is preferred, STF should have a stronger
effect.
Third, STD and STF consume different levels of energy and operate on different time scales.
We have shown that both STD and STF can generate temporal memories, but their ways of
achieving it are quite different. In STD, the memory is held in the prolonged neural activities,
whereas in STF, it is in the facilitated neuronal connections. Mongillo, Barak, and Tsodyks
(2008) proposed that with STF, neurons may not even have to be active after the stimulus is
removed. The facilitated neuronal connections, mediated by the elevated calcium residue, is
sufficient to carry out the memory retrieval. In our model, this is equivalent to setting the
network in the parameter regime without static bump solutions, or in the regime with static
bump solutions but with the external stimulus presented for such a short time that neuronal
interactions cannot be fully facilitated. Thus, taking into account the energy consumption associated with neural firing, the STF-based mechanism for short-term memory has the advantage
of being economically efficient. However, the STD-based one also has the desirable property of
enabling the stimulus information to be propagated to other cortical areas, since neural firing is
necessary for signal transmission, and this is critical in the early information pathways. Furthermore, the time durations required for eliciting STF- and STD-based memory are significantly

24

different. The former needs a stimulus to be presented for an amount of time up to τf to facilitate neuronal interactions sufficiently; whereas the latter simply requires a transient appearance
of a stimulus. This difference implies that the two memory mechanisms may have potentially
different applications in neural systems.
In summary, we have revealed that STP can play very valuable roles in neural information processing, including achieving temporal memory, improving decoding accuracy, enhancing
tracking performance and stabilizing CANNs. We have also shown that STD and STF tend
to have different impacts on the network dynamics. These results, together with the fact that
STP displays large diversity in the neural cortex, suggest that the brain may employ a strategy
of weighting STD and STF differentially depending on the computational task. In the present
study, for the simplicity of analysis, we have only explored the effects of STD and STP separately. In practice, a proper combination of STD and STP can make the network exhibit new
and interesting behaviors and implement new and computationally desirable properties. For
instance, a CANN with both STD and STF, and with the time scale of the former shorter than
that of the latter, can hold bump states for a period of time before shifting the memory to
facilitated neural connections. This enables the network to achieve both goals of conveying the
stimulus information to other cortical areas and holding the memory cheaply. Alternatively,
the network may have the time scale of STD longer than that of STF, so that the network
can produce improved encoding results for external stimuli and also close down bump activities
easily. We will explore these interesting issues in the future.

Appendix A: Consistency with the Model of Tsodyks et al
Our modeling of the dynamics of STP is consistent with the phenomenological model proposed
by Tsodyks, Pawelzik, and Markram (1998). They modeled STD by considering p as the fraction of utilizable neurotransmitters, and STF by introducing U0 as the release probability of
the neurotransmitters. The release probability U0 relaxes to a nonzero constant, urest , but is
enhanced at the arrival of a spike by an amount equal to u0 (1 − U0 ). Hence the dynamics of p
and U0 are given by

(A-3)

where U1 ≡ u0 + U0 (1 − u0 ) is the release probability of the neurotransmitters after the arrival
of a spike. The x and t dependence of u, p, r and U0 are omitted in the above equations for
convenience. Eliminating U0 , we obtain from Eq. (A-3)
∂U1
u0 + (1 − u0 ) urest − U1
=
+ u0 (1 − U1 ) r.
∂t
τf

(A-4)

Substituting α, β and f via α = u0 , β = u0 + (1 − u0 )urest , U1 = [u0 + (1 − u0 )urest ](1 + f ),
fmax = (1 − β)/β, we obtain Eqs. (4) and (5). Rescaling βJ to J, we obtain Eq. (1). α and β
are the STF and STD parameters respectively, subject to β ≥ α.

Appendix B: The Perturbation Approach for Solving the Dynamics of CANNs with STD
We use the perturbation approach to solve the network dynamics. Substituting Eqs. (10) and
(13) into Eq. (1), the right-hand side of Eq. (1) becomes

Below, we analyze the dynamics of the bump in successive orders of perturbation, where the
perturbation order is defined by the highest integer value of index k involved in the approximation. We start with the zeroth order perturbation to describe the behavior of the static bumps,
since their profile is effectively Gaussian. We then move on to the first-order perturbation, which
includes asymmetric distortions. Since spontaneous movements of the bumps are induced by
asymmetric profiles of the synaptic depression, we demonstrate that the first-order perturbation
is able to provide the solution of the moving bump. Proceeding to the second-order perturba28

tion, we allow for the flexibility of varying the width of the bump and demonstrate that this is
important in explaining the lifetime of the plateau state. Tracking behaviors are predicted by
the 11th order perturbation.

Therefore, for each fixed p0 , we can plot a parabolic curve in the space of β versus k. The dashed

region of existence of static bumps.

Stability of the Static Bump
To analyze the stability of the static bump, we consider the time evolution of ǫ = u (t) − u∗ and
δ = p0 (t) − p∗0 , where (u∗ , p∗0 ) is the fixed point solution of Eqs. (C-5) and (C-6). Then, we have

This upper bound is identical to the existence condition of (C-9), which is above the boundary
of non-oscillating solutions. This implies that all non-oscillating solutions are stable.
Above the boundary (C-13), the convergence to the steady state becomes oscillating, and
the stability condition reduces to T ≤ 0, yielding Eq. (21). This condition narrows the region
of static bump considerably, as shown in Fig. 15.

Hence the static bump remains stable when the coefficient of ǫ1 on the right-hand side is nonpositive. Using Eq. (D-4) to eliminate p0 and u/B, we recover the condition in Eq. (24). This
shows that the bump becomes a moving one as soon as it becomes unstable against asymmetric
fluctuations, as described in the main text.
Now we consider the stability of the moving bump. Eliminating ds/dt and summarizing the

Figure 16: The stable branches of the family of the curves with constant values of ξ at τd /τs = 50.
The dashed line is the phase boundary of the static bump.
where P0u = 2p0 τs /Buτd +vτs p1 /2au, P00 = vτs p1 /2ap0 −βu2 τs /Bp0 τd , and P1u = 2p1 τs /Buτd −
vτs p0 /au. For the moving bump to be stable, the real parts of the eigenvalues of the stability
matrix should be non-positive. The stable branches of the family of curves are shown in Fig. 16.
The results show that the boundary of stability of the moving bumps is almost indistinguishable
from the envelope of the family of curves. Higher-order perturbations produce phase boundaries
that agree more with simulation results, as shown in Fig. 3.
We compare the dynamical stability of the ansatz in Eqs. (22) and (23) with simulation
results. As shown in Fig. 17, the region of stability is over-estimated by the ansatz. The major
cause of this is that the width of the synaptic depression profile is restricted to be a. While
this provides a self-consistent solution when STD is weak, this is no longer valid when STD
is strong. Due to the slow recovery of synaptic depression, its profile leaves a long, partially
recovered tail behind the moving bump, thus reducing the stability of the bump. This requires
us to consider the second-order perturbation, which takes into account variation of the width of
the STD profile. As shown in Fig. 17, the second-order perturbation yields a phase boundary
much closer to the simulation results when STD is weak. However, as shown in the inset of Fig.
17, the discrepancy increases when STD is stronger, and higher-order corrections are required.

Appendix E: Decoding in CANNs with STF

Note that since the noise occurs in the position of the bump, we can neglect changes in the
height. Substituting Eqs. (E-1) and (E-1) into Eq. (1), and removing terms orthogonal to the
