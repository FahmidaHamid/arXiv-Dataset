Abstract Early brain connectivity development consists of
multiple stages: birth of neurons, their migration and the subsequent growth of axons and dendrites. Each stage occurs
within a certain period of time depending on types of neurons and cortical layers. Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons starting at similar times for
all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at different
time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and
spatial properties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore
the extreme cases of axon formation during early development, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i.e., maximally overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one neuron after another
(serial, i.e., no overlaps in time windows). For both cases,
the number of potential and established synapses remained
comparable. Topological and spatial properties, however, differed: Neurons that started axon growth early on in serial
growth achieved higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency
and longer axon lengths while neurons demonstrated more
homogeneous connectivity patterns for parallel growth. SecElectronic supplementary material The online version of this

ond, connection probability decreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than for serial
growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for parallel growth. Finally, we tested our predictions
with C. elegans data. Together, this indicates that time windows for axon growth influence the topological and spatial
properties of neuronal networks opening up the possibility
to a posteriori estimate developmental mechanisms based on
network properties of a developed network.

1 Introduction
The formation of synapses between neurons is influenced
by genetic, activity-dependent, molecular and mechanical
cues in combination and also in different temporal and spatial scales (Sperry 1963; Yamamoto et al. 2002; Yu et al.
2012; Franze 2013; Scheiffele et al. 2000; Dickson 2002). To
avoid abnormal functionality, finding specific target neurons
is important. Many guidance mechanisms ensure the correct specification between neurons to successfully establish
appropriate synapses. One of the important mechanisms for
global synaptic connectivity is chemotaxis. Diffusible and
membrane-bound chemical cues guide axons to find their
targets (van Ooyen 2011; Dickson 2002; Gotz et al. 1992).
Electrical activity also affects synaptogenesis and its reorganization (Butz et al. 2014; Butz and van Ooyen 2013).
These guidance cues, however, cannot fully explain certain
features of synaptic connectivity. In C. elegans, for example,
around 40 % of connection patterns cannot be accounted for
by differences in gene expression patterns (Kaufman et al.

123

Biol Cybern

2006; Baruch et al. 2008). Activity-dependent mechanisms
are crucial for the refinement of neuronal circuits (Van Ooyen
et al. 1995; Butz et al. 2009), but activity seems to have
a lower influence on the early connectivity in neural systems. For example, several patterns of connectivity are preserved in knockout studies with no neurotransmitter release
(Verhage et al. 2000). Short-range connectivity within less
than 700 µm, or interneuron connectivity (Packer et al. 2013;
Packer and Yuste 2011; Price et al. 2011) is difficult to be
explained by chemical affinity guidance cues unlike longrange connectivity at the global level (Kaiser et al. 2009).
Peters’ rule (Braitenberg and Schüz 1998) suggests that
synapse formation in brain circuitry mainly depends on the
overlap of geometrical locations of specific axons and dendrites in the absence of guidance cues (Binzegger et al. 2004;
van Pelt and van Ooyen 2013; McAssey et al. 2014; van
Ooyen et al. 2014). In particular, the specificity of early
synapse formation to develop functional neural circuits was
predicted by simple factors from the overlap of axons and
dendrites in hatchling frog tadpole (Li et al. 2007) and also in
neocortical microcircuits (Hill et al. 2012; Packer and Yuste
2011).
Another crucial factor is the developmental time window
of a neuron. Brain development occurs at different time periods depending on regions, cell types and types of development (Andersen 2003; Rakic 2002; Shaw et al. 2008).
Cells are born, differentiate, migrate to certain regions of
the brain and form synaptic connections influenced by the
aforementioned factors. Initial overproductions of neurons
and synapses are reduced after 1 year from birth, suggesting particular time periods for neurogenesis, programmed
apoptosis, early synaptic pruning and synaptogenesis (Rakic
et al. 1986; Purves and Lichtman 1980; Kelsch et al. 2010;
Huttenlocher 1984). Time windows of development for connections between brain regions influence the topology of cortical connectivity. Kaiser and Hilgetag (Kaiser and Hilgetag
2007) and Nisbach and Kaiser (Nisbach and Kaiser 2007)
showed that overlapping time windows of development could
generate clusters in brain networks by having more connections between neurons with overlapping time windows of
network development. Whereas these time windows operate on the population level, Varier and Kaiser (Varier and
Kaiser 2011) found that neurons having similar birth times
were more likely to be connected in C. elegans, indicating
preferential synaptic connections between neurons with overlapping time windows for axon growth. Some studies have
also reported preferential electrical coupling between neurons sharing genetic lineage that are likely to have similar
developmental time windows in mice neocortex (Yu et al.
2009, 2012). Furthermore, non-overlapping time windows
among neurons in CA3 resulted in selective synaptic connectivity forming sub-modules in hippocampus (Deguchi et al.
2011; Druckmann et al. 2014).

To investigate neuronal innervations, computational models (van Ooyen 2003, 2011) have been developed ranging
from abstract models with few assumptions (Kaiser et al.
2009; Willshaw and von der Malsburg 1976; Perin et al. 2013)
to more complex models simulating neurogenesis and synaptogenesis with realistic neuronal morphologies forming layers and large-scale neuronal networks in the brain (Koene
et al. 2009; Godfrey et al. 2009; Hennig et al. 2009; Zubler
and Douglas 2009). In previous models, however, while time
windows for neural migration and synapse formation were
included, it was not systematically studied how different time
windows of axon growth would affect the characteristics of
the brain network organization.
Here, we investigated how different time windows of axon
growth would affect morphological, topological and spatial properties of short-range brain connectivity during early
development. Whereas previous studies dealt with time windows that operate on the population level, our current study
observes the effect of the timing of axon growth for individual neurons within a neural population. We compared two
scenarios of non-overlapping (serial growth) and completely
overlapping time windows (parallel growth). To study the
role of time windows for axon growth in short-range connectivity, we used the approach of random axon outgrowth,
randomly picking a direction, growing in a straight line and
establishing a synapse when a target neuron is within certain
proximity along the growth direction.

2 Materials and methods
Most of the assumptions of the model were endowed from
the previous study (Kaiser et al. 2009).
2.1 Simulation
2.1.1 Placement of neurons
Neurons were placed randomly in 3D space of 34 by 34 by 34
units except a neuron located at the center, which was about
4 times as many as for 2D in order to have a comparable
chance for establishing a cell position without cell overlap
(Kaiser et al. 2009). The number of neurons varied in the
given space: 1,000, 1,400 and 1,800. The total volume of neurons relative to the embedding space ranged from 1 to 14 %
depending on the cell size and the number of neurons in the
simulation.
2.1.2 Sizes of neurons
A neuron was simplified as a sphere where the soma and
dendrites were included. The radius of a neuron varied from
0.5 to 0.9 (0.500, 0.604, 0.735, 0.900) to make the volume

Biol Cybern

of the sphere increase 1, 2, 4 and 8 times in each condition.
There is an upper limit for the number of incoming connections for a neuron as space around (Stepanyants et al. 2002)
or on the dendrite (Kaiser et al. 2009) as well as other factors (van Ooyen et al. 2001; van Ooyen 2001) constraints
the extent of synapse formation (see Sect. 2.1.5 below). The
maximum values of incoming connections were varied 1, 2, 4
and 8 according to volume of a neuron because the coverage
of dendritic ramifications would expand as the size of our
neuron sphere increased. The radius and the number of maximum incoming connection were fixed in each condition. We
assumed that the dendrites of a neuron did not grow as the
size of a neuron sphere was fixed during simulations. However, we could also confirm that dendritic outgrowth, changing the size of our neurons (including soma and dendritic
tree size) during development, did not affect our conclusions
(Figure A9); dendrites were assumed to grow radially away
from the soma based on the somatofugal growth of neurites
(Samsonovich and Ascoli 2003).
2.1.3 Growth direction
The direction of axonal outgrowth was randomly chosen uniformly in the 3D space, and an axon grew in a straight line
toward the given direction as growth direction of axons has
a propensity to grow in approximately straight lines unless
axons encounter obstructions or guidance cues (Sperry 1963;
Easter et al. 1985; Yamamoto et al. 2002).
2.1.4 Proximity rule for establishing synapses
A synapse was established when the growing axon encountered another neuron within the connectible range (less than
or equal to 1 unit length). The distance between a growth
cone and a neuron was computed considering the radius of a
neuron, or the shortest Euclidean distance between a growth
cone and the surface of a neuron (the boundary of dendrites);
thus, larger neurons increased their chances of establishing a
synapse. We assumed that only the growth cone can establish
a synapse.
2.1.5 Competition
Competition between neurons for synapse establishment was
realized by limiting the number of incoming connections.
A synapse was formed only when the neuron within vicinity could accommodate another synapse. All neurons keep
growing their axons until they hit the border of the embedding space, as the maximum number of outgoing connections
for a neuron was not limited assuming short-range connectivity within less than 700 µm.

2.1.6 Serial and parallel growth
For serial growth, each neuron takes turns to grow its
axon, which represented no overlap in the time windows
for axon growth; the first neuron grows out completely
and forms all possible connections and finishes its growth,
and only then the second neuron starts growing and makes
synapses along the way. For parallel growth, all neurons
start growing their axons simultaneously; thus, developmental time windows for all neurons coincided and maximally overlapped; all neurons start growing their axons
at the same time, however, when the growth cone of a
neuron hits the boundary of the space, that neuron stops
axonal outgrowth. Thus, the finishing times for neurons are
different (Fig. 1).
2.1.7 Developmental time windows
Different areas in the brain have shown dissimilar growth
trajectories over time having partially overlapping time windows (Rakic 2002; Shaw et al. 2008; Sur and Leamey
2001). For instance, cortical neurons in Brodmann area (BA)
24 migrate to upper layers faster than neurons in BA11,
BA46 and BA17; neurons in BA17 take the longest time
to reach their final position (Rakic 2002). Moreover, previous studies have shown that neurons are inclined to establish synapses with other neurons whose time windows of
growth overlapped (Kaiser and Hilgetag 2007; Nisbach and
Kaiser 2007; Deguchi et al. 2011; Druckmann et al. 2014;
Yu et al. 2009, 2012). Therefore, by comparing network features between serial and parallel growth, we could observe
the influence of time windows for neuronal network development. Additionally, we tested partially overlapping time
windows with a small partial overlap and a large partial
overlap; serial growth is the extreme case of small overlap, i.e., zero overlap and parallel growth is the opposite
end where time windows of axon growth are maximally
overlapped (see details in Online material A10 and Figures
A10–A12).
2.1.8 Data set
Positions of neurons and growth directions were generated
constructing a total of 50 data sets to compare serial and
parallel growth using equivalent positions of neurons and
growth directions.
2.2 Comparison of growth scenarios
Serial growth and parallel growth were compared in terms of
morphological, topological and spatial features. Morphological features included the number of established synapses,
the number of potential synapses and the ratio between the

123

Biol Cybern

two, or filling fraction (Stepanyants et al. 2002). In biological neuronal networks, not all potential synaptic locations are
realized due to competition between neurons (Kaiser et al.
2009; van Ooyen et al. 2001; van Ooyen 2001), plasticity
of connectivity or limitations in volume (Stepanyants et al.
2002). Next, topological properties such as out-degree, local
efficiency and the proportion of bidirectional connections
were investigated (Newman 2003; Brandes and Erlebach
2005; Costa et al. 2007). Out-degree of a neuron is the total
number of outgoing connections from the neuron or the total
number of outgoing synapses. Out-degrees of neurons were
averaged over 50 trials for each neuron and ordered according
to the sequence of serial growth. Then, this distribution was
fitted with exponential or polynomial curves to assess the difference in out-degree as a function of the sequence of start.
This shows whether earlier starters would have an advantage over later starters in establishing outgoing synapses.
The maximum number of incoming connections was limited and increased according to the volume of a neuron. As a
result, in-degree was constrained by the maximum number of
incoming connections. Global efficiency is the inverse of the
harmonic mean of the shortest path length between each pair
of nodes (Eq. 1) and local efficiency for a node is calculated
in the same way as global efficiency in the subgraph of the
node comprised of its immediate neighbors (Eq. 2) (Latora
and Marchiori 2001, 2003).
E global (G) =

(2)

where N stands for the number of nodes in the network, L i j
for the length of the shortest path between nodes i and j, G
for a graph and G i for the subgraph that consists of neighbors
of node i. The shortest path length of a pair of nodes is the
length of the lowest number of edges to go from one node to
the other node (Kaiser 2011).
Finally, we observed spatial properties of the grown neural
connectivity. Connection probability between two neurons
as a function of distance was calculated by dividing the
number of connected edges by the number of possible connections given a distance between two neurons, where the
distance between a pair of neurons was the Euclidean distance between the centers of the somata of neurons. Similarly, bidirectional connection probability as a function of
distance was calculated by dividing the existing number of
bidirectional connections by the number of all possible connections given a distance. The proportion of bidirectional
connection was the ratio of bidirectional connections to all
existing connections, and it was compared with that in the
rewired networks to examine whether the proportion of bidirectional connections was higher in our random outgrowth
model than that for random networks. We used rewired net-

123

works for benchmark random networks by randomizing or
rewiring the original networks while preserving degree distributions (Maslov and Sneppen 2002; Rubinov and Sporns
2010). The connection length between two connected neurons was the Euclidean distance between the centers of neurons assuming that the distance between the growth cone and
the target neuron was negligible. If a neuron made multiple
synapses until it hit the boundary of the given space, the locations where the intermediate synapses were established were
considered as synaptic boutons and consequently the axon
length for the neuron was defined as the distance between the
neuron and the neuron where the last synapse was formed.
Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov and Sporns 2010)
was used to calculate network measures: in- and out-degree,
local efficiency and the generation of random networks by
rewiring our directed networks while preserving degree distributions.
2.3 Validation of our model prediction with C. elegans
connectivity
We used data and information from previous studies based
on the Worm Atlas (Chen et al. 2006; Varshney et al. 2011;
Hall and Altun 2008) as we could make use of birth times of
neurons in C. elegans as a proxy for developmental time
windows (http://www.wormatlas.org/neuronalwiring.html#
NeuronalconnectivityII). Unfortunately, there is no data from
higher organisms since birth times or developmental time
windows for axon growth and synaptogenesis are currently
not available. For C. elegans, chemical synapses were considered, while electrical and neuromuscular junctions were
excluded in the connectivity matrix. Spatial locations of neurons were obtained from a previous study (Choe et al. 2004).
Based on birth times of neurons, we grouped neurons into
three groups using k-means clustering: neurons in group 1
and group 2 have similar birth times and were born early,
whereas neurons in group 3 were born much later compared
to groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 5a). As each time k-means clustering provides slightly different clusters, we perform 50 trials and classified neurons with the most stable or frequent
grouping. We assumed all neurons start to grow axons and
dendrites after a similar latency period; birth time + α is
the starting point of the time window of axon outgrowth.
Thus, birth time can be directly associated with the start of
the growth without losing generality since α is assumed to be
about the same for all neurons. Groups are compared in terms
of degrees, connection lengths and reciprocal connections.
We tested the three most pronounced differences between
serial and parallel growth: (1) whether earlier-born neurons
acquired higher degrees than later-born neurons (group 1 vs.
2 and group 1 and 2 vs. 3), (2) whether earlier-born neurons established longer connections and (3) whether reciprocal connections are more numerous in neurons in groups

Biol Cybern

1 and 2 than for neurons in 1 and 3 or 2 and 3. Long-range
connections were defined as connections where the length
was at least one standard deviation above the mean of all
connection lengths. Additionally, we examined local efficiency and connection probability as a function of distance
(A13).
2.4 Statistical analysis
Topological and spatial properties between serial and parallel growth such as out-degree, local efficiency, connection probability and bidirectional connectivity were averaged over 50 trials for each neuron then fitted with exponential or polynomial curves. When curves followed close to
a power law (connection probability and bidirectional connectivity), double-logarithmic axes were used and fitted with
linear models. Higher proportion of bidirectional connectivity for parallel growth than serial growth was tested by
paired t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test, two-tailed with
an alpha level 0.05 and corrected by Bonferroni for multiple comparisons. To group neurons based on their birth
times, we used k-means clustering using Euclidean distance. Degrees and long-range connection length were tested
with Kruskal–Wallis test, and post hoc multiple comparisons were performed using Mann–Whitney test and corrected by Bonferroni. Calculations and statistical tests were
performed with MATLAB R2012b (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Algorithms are available online at http://www.
dynamic-connectome.org/.

3 Results
3.1 Topological and spatial properties
3.1.1 Serial versus parallel growth with a limit on the
number of incoming connections
Out-degree distribution For serial growth, neurons that
started growing their axons earlier took priority to establish synapses over late starters, hence a decreasing trend of
out-degrees as the indices of order in development increased.
In contrast, for parallel growth where every neuron started
growing their axons simultaneously, out-degrees were independent of indices of neurons as the indices merely had nominal values in this case (Fig. 2a). The contrasting distributions of out-degrees for serial and parallel growth applied
to all conditions independent of the number of neurons and
the maximum number of incoming connections. However,
the decreasing rate of out-degree for serial growth slowed
down when allowing more incoming connections (less severe
competition). Note that the less contrasting patterns between
serial and parallel growth when larger numbers of incoming connections were allowed (e.g., the fourth column of
Figure A4) should be attributed to milder competition among
neurons rather than to higher neuronal density.
Local efficiency Neurons that started axon growth early on
were also characterized by higher local efficiency compared

d1 < d2, then θ1 > θ2. Therefore, if a target neuron is far from the
presynaptic neuron, it is less likely to form a connection, leading to
lower connection probability

there was no difference among neurons for parallel growth.
The effect was not as pronounced as the decreasing trend for
the out-degree distribution for serial growth; the decrease in
local efficiency was observed mostly in later starting neurons for serial growth. Similar to the out-degree distribution,
the disparate distributions of local efficiency for serial and
parallel growth applied to all conditions with different numbers of neurons and maximum numbers of incoming connections; thus, we show a representative example (Fig. 2b). The
decreasing rate of local efficiency for serial growth slowed
down when allowing more incoming connections (Figure
A5).

than for serial growth with distance between neurons, while
the number of established synapses was the same between
serial and parallel growth scenarios (Fig. 3a). The discrepancy of slopes for serial and parallel growth in the doubly
logarithmic plot became reduced as the maximum number
of incoming connections increased (Figure A6).
Figure 3b shows a schematic view of the relationship
between the distance between neurons and the connection
probability of the two neurons. When neurons are located
farther apart from each other, the connection probability
decreases since the range of growth directions toward which
it can successfully establish a synapse is more limited. In
other words, the connection probability between a pair of
neurons located a distance d apart is proportional to the range
of growth angles a neuron can take, that is the connection
probability given a distance d, P(d) ∝ θ . The growth angle
θ from the straight line between the centers of neurons can be

Connection probability Connection probability given a distance between two neurons decreased rapidly as the distance
increased following power-law tail behavior (Figure A3). The
connection probability decreased faster for parallel growth

where r represents the size or the radius of a neuron and d
stands for the distance between the centers of neurons and
inverse of sine can be approximated by its Maclaurin series
when 1 + r < d. Thus, Eq. 3 can be approximated as Eq. 4
taking only the first term of the series. The log–log plot of
distance and angle also showed straight lines since the connection probability is inversely proportional to the distance
d (Eq. 5) (Figure A3).
Bidirectional connections Two neurons located close to each
other are more likely to form synapses in general, and
consequently, there would be more reciprocal connections
between two neurons close to each other (Fig. 3b). However,
this higher connection probability for bidirectional connections for nearby neurons assumes that relevant neurons are
available for incoming connections. Synapses would not be
formed when the target neurons have reached its maximum
incoming limit even if neurons reside close to each other and
the growth directions are narrow enough to form synapses.
For serial growth even if both of them are within proximity
of the other neuron’s growth direction, one of them is more
likely to be occupied and no longer available for making
another synapse. Since they started at different time points,
thus one neuron took much longer to reach the other neuron unlike for parallel growth. Therefore, bidirectional connections would be more numerous for parallel growth than
for serial growth. As we expected, more frequent reciprocal connections were observed for parallel growth than for
the serial growth scenario (Fig. 4a). For example, for 1,000
neurons with one incoming connection per neuron allowed,

neurons formed about six times as many bidirectional connections for parallel growth as for serial growth (Wilcoxon
signed rank test, p < 10−7 corrected by Bonferroni). The
difference between serial and parallel growth disappeared as
neurons were allowed to have a large number of incoming
connections (Figure A7). The simulated bidirectional connection probability using inverse sine (Eq. 5) was calculated
by squaring the connection probability assuming independence among neurons for synapse establishment (Figure A3,
black).
We also investigated whether the bidirectional connectivity was higher than expected in random networks. Random networks were constructed by randomizing or rewiring
the original networks while preserving degree distributions
(Maslov and Sneppen 2002; Rubinov and Sporns 2010). For
smaller neuron sizes such as radii 0.5 and 0.604 concomitant with 1 and 2 maximum incoming connections allowed,
respectively, rewired networks did not have any bidirectional
connectivity even when considering larger numbers of neurons up to 1,800, or higher neuronal density. For larger neuron
sizes, thus having a larger reach and more incoming connections allowed, originally generated networks with random outgrowth showed 10–17 times larger bidirectional connection proportions for serial growth and from 11 to about
40 times larger proportions for parallel growth depending
on conditions. In summary, both serial and parallel growth
resulted in higher bidirectionality than that of the benchmark random network, indicating that random outgrowth
model with geometrical constraints can also reproduce more
densely connected clusters.
Connection length distribution and Axon length The connection length distribution for parallel growth was characterized by an exponential decrease in the frequency, having a
higher proportion of shorter connections, while the connection length distribution for serial growth demonstrated almost
linear and slower decrease in the frequency having a larger
number of longer connections than for parallel growth, while
the total number of connections was the same both for serial

group 1 and group 3 or group 2 and group 3 indicate small
overlapping time windows (or serial growth).Here, birth time
is used as an equivalent of the starting point of the time window for axon (and dendrite) outgrowth.1
We tested whether groups 1 and 2, with neurons born early
during development, achieved higher out-degrees than group
3. We found that neurons in groups 1 and 2 indeed obtained
larger numbers of connections (higher degrees) compared
to neurons in group 3 (Kruskal–Wallis test, p < 10−6 and

between groups 1 and 3, p < 10−4 ; between groups 2

3.2 Comparison of our model predictions with C.elegans
connectivity
To validate our model predictions, we made use C. elegans
data (Chen et al. 2006; Varshney et al. 2011; Hall and Altun
2008; Choe et al. 2004). Using only chemical synapses, we
tested our three major predictions from our model concerning degree, connection lengths and bidirectional connectivity. Groups 1, 2 and 3 represent three groups of neurons
clustered based on their birth times (Fig. 5a). While birth
times in groups 1 and 2 were, on average, 114.78 min apart,
the time difference between groups 2 and 3 was more than
1255.70 min. As birth times of group 1 and group 2 do not differ much, we can assume that group 1 and group 2 represent

Time windows for neurogenesis and synaptogenesis should be treated
differently; however, here we assumed time windows for synaptogenesis
in C. elegans started after equivalent time passes for all neurons for
simplicity.

1 and 3, p < 0.0057; between groups 2 and 3, p < 0.0002,
p values are corrected by Bonferroni, Fig. 5c) and more
bidirectional connections (Fig. 5d). As expected for parallel growth, group 1 versus group 2 did not display significantly higher degree, long-range connection lengths or bidirectional connectivity differences. Local efficiency and connection probability, however, were not consistent with the
model predictions indicating that there are factors excluded
in the model which influence these features (See Discussion
and A13).

4 Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that different time windows
for axon growth could lead to distinct topological and spatial characteristics by exploring two extreme cases of time
windows representing serial (heterogeneous) and parallel
(homogeneous) growth. We also tested our model predictions with C. elegans connectivity data. Overlapping and nonoverlapping time windows for axon growth resulted in different topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks,
although morphological properties such as the number of
potential synapses and established synapses were not different (A2). For serial growth, neurons that started axon growth
early on achieved higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency
and longer axon lengths than later starting neurons, while
no difference was observed for parallel growth. Bidirectional connections were more numerous for parallel growth.
Finally, axon lengths for serial growth were longer. Together,
time windows for axon growth seem to have a major influence
on network organization during neural development.
4.1 Non-overlapping versus overlapping time windows for
axon growth
Brain development shows region-specific time windows of
growth that partially overlap (Rakic 2002; Shaw et al. 2008;
Sur and Leamey 2001). Previous computational studies
(Kaiser and Hilgetag 2007; Nisbach and Kaiser 2007) as
well as the analysis of the C. elegans cell lineage (Varier and
Kaiser 2011) strongly suggest that neurons are inclined to
establish synapses with other neurons whose developmental
time windows overlap (Varier and Kaiser 2011; Deguchi et al.
2011; Druckmann et al. 2014). We investigated how developmental time windows for axon outgrowth affect network connectivity by analyzing non-overlapping (serial growth) and
maximally overlapping (parallel growth) time windows for
axon growth. For serial growth, a neuron is able to start growing its axon only after the previous neuron finishes developing its axon. Thus, time windows of axonal growth do not
overlap, whereas for parallel growth, all neurons have the

same time window onset, starting to grow axons simultaneously. Note, however, that the end point of the time window—
the time when a neuron left the embedding space—could differ between neurons. Biologically, neurons with highly overlapping time windows of development can be interpreted as
neurons whose birth times, lineage and cell types are homogeneous such as cortical neurons in the same layer or clone
sister neurons sharing genetic resemblance, both of which
were characterized with a higher propensity to establish
synapses between them (Li et al. 2009; Deguchi et al. 2011).
For serial growth, earlier development for axon growth
facilitated more numerous synapse establishments resulting
in higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency and longer axon
lengths, suggesting a possible mechanism for network hub
formation. These results are in line with experimental findings analyzing the neuronal network of C. elegans (Varier
and Kaiser 2011) and even with findings for the network of
fiber tracts between cortical regions in the macaque (Kaiser
and Varier 2011). As we expected, earlier-born neurons in
C. elegans established more connections than later-born neurons. This might allow us to predict the history of neural
development based on cell lineage and adult degree distribution. Local efficiency shows that how efficiently neighbor neurons of a neuron would communicate when the neuron is removed being linked to the fault tolerance of the
network (Latora and Marchiori 2001, 2003). Here, higher
local efficiency of early starter neurons indicates that the
local network comprised of the neuron’s immediate neighbor neurons has more efficient communication among neighbor neurons and also more resilience against the removal of
the early starter neuron. In line with these findings, an earlier study in C. elegans (Varier and Kaiser 2011) found that
most connected neurons were born at similar time points
and that the majority of long-distance connections appeared
early on. This suggests that overlapping developmental time
windows could contribute to increase the connection probability and early establishment of long-distance connectivity,
which could secure specifically targeted long-range connections. Starting early on is a mechanism for individual neurons to establish long-distance connections. However, serial growth also affected the neural population as a whole.
In our simulations, the sequential serial growth generated
significantly more long-distance connections than the more
homogeneous parallel growth (Fig. 4b); neurons that started
axon growth later often found that postsynaptic neurons were
already occupied, whereas earlier starters successfully established synapses to the same target neurons even if they were
distantly located.
The connection probability between a pair of neurons
decreased as the distance between them increased in line
with anatomical studies (Hellwig 2000; Schuz 2005; Kaiser
et al. 2009). The rate of decrease was steeper for parallel
growth indicating that neurons with the same time window

123

Biol Cybern

of axonal growth tend to prefer short-distance connections
rather than long-distance connections. In contrast, for serial growth, the distance was not the only factor to establish
connections since late starter neurons may not be able to
form certain synapses due to the limited number of incoming connections, thus having a slower decrease in connection
probability with distance.
Bidirectional connections were more numerous for parallel growth than for serial growth, which we confirmed with
C. elegans connectivity data; the discrepancy between neurons (or neuron groups) was negatively correlated to the
degree of overlap in the developmental time windows. In
other words, larger overlap of developmental time windows
(groups 1 and 2) reduced differences in degrees and connection length. More frequent reciprocal connections for parallel growth provide additional converging evidence that overlapping time windows during development would produce
more reciprocal connections between neurons (Kaiser and
Hilgetag 2007; Nisbach and Kaiser 2007; Varier and Kaiser
2011). The bidirectional connection probability decreased
more rapidly than the overall connection probability
(Figure A3), which is consistent with previous studies using
thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons in neonatal Wistar
rats (Perin et al. 2011, 2013). Previous studies have shown
overrepresented reciprocal connections in the rat relative to
random networks claiming that the synaptic connectivity is
preferential rather than random (Kelsch et al. 2010; Markram
et al. 1997). However, in this study, we observed a higher
proportion of bidirectional connections while still using a
random outgrowth mechanism for both serial and parallel
growth scenarios.
Earlier-born neurons in C. elegans acquired higher outdegree, longer axon lengths and higher reciprocal connectivity, which were consistent with the model predictions. However, local efficiency and connection probability as a function of distance between neurons showed discrepancy from
what the model predicted (A13). We believe that the model
predictions and the actual results from C. elegans were different because (1) differences in local efficiency between serial and parallel growth were less apparent for all conditions
(Figure A5) and (2) connection probability in our model
depends mainly on the geometrical arrangement of dendrites
(neuron spheres) and axons, whereas the connectivity of C.
elegans has additional constraints such as its elongated body
shape and a higher prevalence of long-distance connections
(Kaiser and Hilgetag 2006).

For models of specific tissue, the morphology of the dendritic tree and the number of spines would need to be taken
into account. Such parameters for many types of neurons
and many different species are available in the NeuroMorpho database (Samsonovich and Ascoli 2003; Ropireddy and
Ascoli 2011; Zawadzki et al. 2012). Another simplification is
the axon growth in a straight line. Even though growing in a
straight line is the default behavior, axons can branch or their
growth directions can be influenced by attractive or repulsive
signaling cues in the external environment (Yamamoto et al.
2002; Krottje and Van Ooyen 2007; Sakai and Kaprielian
2012). Finally, the embedding space of neurons for axon
growth and synaptogenesis of our model was fixed during
development, while internal volume changes through neurite growth and external mechanical factors could change the
location of neurons and influence their synapse formation
probabilities. For uniform expansion along all directions, this
would increase connection lengths, but differences between
serial and parallel growth would remain (See A14 for detailed
analysis and discussion).
4.3 Conclusion
In the current study, we showed that for serial growth
of axons, neurons with an early start of axonal growth
acquired higher out-degrees, higher local efficiency and
longer axon lengths, while overlapping time windows for parallel growth contributed to higher reciprocal connection and
faster decrease in overall connection probability and connection length distribution with an increased distance between
neurons. These predictions were confirmed when comparing our findings with the organization and development of
the neuronal network of C. elegans. In summary, we demonstrated that axon growth time windows—like time windows
for synaptogenesis and neuronal migration—modulate the
topological and spatial properties of neuronal networks. We
hope that these findings elucidate the origins of normal and
pathological network development.

This general study of axon growth uses simplifications both
for axon growth and neuron morphology. The size of the
neuron and the proximity rule can only be an estimate of the
average behavior of axons growing close to existing neurons.
