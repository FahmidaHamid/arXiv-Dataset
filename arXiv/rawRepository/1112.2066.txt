We introduce a class of weighted graphs whose properties are meant to mimic the topological
features of idiotypic networks, namely the interaction networks involving the B-core of the immune
system. Each node is endowed with a bit-string representing the idiotypic specificity of the corresponding B cell and a proper distance between any couple of bit-strings provides the coupling
strength between the two nodes. We show that a biased distribution of the entries in bit-strings
can yield fringes in the (weighted) degree distribution, small-worlds features, and scaling laws, in
agreement with experimental findings. We also investigate the role of ageing, thought of as a progressive increase in the degree of bias in bit-strings, and we show that it can possibly induce mild
percolation phenomena, which are investigated too.

INTRODUCTION

Network theories are becoming fundamental pillars of
modern approaches to describe reality in all fields of science, ranging from quantitative sociology [1–4] to systemic biology [5–8]. As for the latter, immunology is one
of the few fields of science where the importance of underlying networks of interactions were stressed directly
by a few immunologists as early as half a century ago
[9, 10]: The importance of refined models for the core
of B-cell interactions is fundamental in order to properly address a possible regulatory role of the idiotypic
network in ”systemic” outcomes of the immune system,
such as self-nonself discrimination [11–13, 15]. Furthermore, the recent goals obtained by monoclonal antibody
techniques in clinical therapies [16] encourage the development of a clear theoretical backbone to control, for
instance, the preparation and the effects of antibodies
functionally mirroring proper enzymes [17] or the preparation of proper vaccinations against autoimmune manifestations (e.g. SLA) [18].
All this information continues to fascinate physicists
and mathematicians who early started to develop theoretical models shaped to the increasing availability of
read data (see e.g. [14, 19]) and continue to update plausible frameworks for these B-cell interactions (see e.g.
[20–23] and references therein).
This paper presents a detailed study of the topological properties, and consequent structural implications,
of a model for the B-cell branch of adaptive immunity,
previously developed in [24, 25]. Here, inspired by recent biological findings [26], we introduce a tunable bias
among antibodies at the epitopal (idiotypic) level, which
aims to mimic the non purely random genesis of these
proteins. The inclusion of this feature has crucial consequences for the topology structure such as the emergence
of fringes (i.e., multimodularity) in the weighted degree

distribution; moreover, while with further increase in the
correlation, the network gets sparser and sparser (possibly reaching underpercolated regimes) [27], and proper
scaling laws can be detected, all in agreement (at least
qualitatively) with experimental results [12]. In particular, fringes in degree distribution were observed in the
first studies [12, 28] of antibody networks in mice and a
structural role of these fringes was speculated: antibodies
corresponding to nodes with a higher (weighted) coordination number would act as inhibitors to autoimmune
errors (self-attaching), while those with a lower coordination number would act as soldiers against pathogens.
Moreover, a relation between the overall similarity (i.e.,
the degree of bias) among antibody structures and the
average coordination number has also been extensively
reported [27–30], and it suggests the following speculation: the B-repertoire of an immune system of newborn
mice is essentially random (so as to be highly adaptable
to the outside reality), hence displaying a high connectivity. As infections are encountered, the network specializes its army, increasing antibody similarities [57] and, as
a consequence, the network connectivity decreases, consistent with experimental findings in adult mice.

In this paper, after a streamlined introduction on the
B-core of the immune system (Sec. II), we introduce a
class of weighted graphs meant to describe idiotypic networks (Sec. III). Then, such a model is investigated for
its global topology (Sec. IV), including degree distribution and clustering features, and as for the distribution of
weights associated witth its links (Sec. V). Next the ageing of the system by increasing the degree of bias among
bit strings; this process induces a progressive dilution
of the network and the resulting percolation is analyzed
(Sec. VI). Finally, we discuss our results and possible
perspectives (Sec. VII).

A GLANCE AT ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY

Mammalian immune system is a complex ensemble of
interacting cells and exchanging molecules, whose scope
is to prevent the host body from infection and damage by
pathogens, either external (e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses)
or internal (e.g. cancerous cells). To satisfy this task,
specific soldiers, each with specific weapons, were developed. The best known troop in this army is probably the
family of B-cells, whose weapons are the antibodies (also
known as immunoglobulin) they secrete.
In a nutshell, B-cells are divided into clones; each clone
is made of cells producing the same antibody, and its size
(the number of identical cells within the clone) varies over
several orders of magnitude as a function of external stimulation. Consequently, the ensemble of all clones mirrors
the repertoire of all possible antibodies, which, in order
to cover a wide range of responses, must be enormously
variegate [e.g. in humans it is O(1010 )]. In the following,
each antibody is thought of as a bit string of fixed length,
whose entries represent the presence (1) or absence (0)
of the corresponding idiotope/paratope, i.e., the specific
module devoted to the interaction and recognition of an
epitope, a piece of an antigen. The latter is, by definition, any molecule able to trigger an immune response
and can also be thought of as a bit-string of the same
length [24].
Now, following the pioneering investigation by Burnet [31–33] known as “clonal selection theory”, (and assuming for the sake of clarity a binary representation in
terms of bitstrings of information for both antigens and
antibodies [14] that is deepened later), when an antigen
(e.g. 01101100) is introduced into the body, the B-cell
expressing a high-matching antibody (e.g. 10010011), after exposure to the antigen itself, starts the replicative
process, increasing the size of the clone, and all its cells
secrete antibodies in a large quantity. The latter, being
soluble molecules, rapidly explore the body deleting the
pathogen. After the removal, the excess lymphocytes undergo apoptosis, shrinking the size of the clone to normal
values [58].
One step forward, following the idiotypic network representation by Jerne [10], the antibody produced at a
high concentration can itself be identified as a “stranger”
in the host body (as in the past it never appeared macroscopically, for otherwise, the pathogen could not affect
the host already vaccinated) and trigger a response by
another antibody with complementary entries to itself
(the anti-antibody, e.g., 10011100, namely, an external
reproduction of the pathogen, but devoid of dangerous
DNA/RNA), and so on, giving rise to the so-called ”antibody cascade” commonly seen in experiments (see e.g.,
[34, 35] and references therein). When an antibody is
considered an antigen, the portion of the combinatorial
site which is recognized by another antibody is called the
idiotope.
Another step forward, approaching the Varela theory
[11, 12], is to allow the same antibody to be recognized

by several clones, namely, the idea of “mirror of mirror” is enlarged into an affinity matrix, in such a way
that an antibody represented by a string, say (0110110),
is reactive not only with its mirror (1001001), but also
with (1001000), even though to a smaller extent. This
gives rise to a network whose nodes are B-cells and links
connect clones secreting well-matching immunoglobulins.
This network has been shown to posses a regulatory role
emerging from its non trivial topology and coupling distribution. Some of these features have already been evidenced in the context of unbiased antibody distributions,
e.g. low-dose tolerance [36], generation of memory cells
[25] and a unifying framework where the Burnet, Jerne,
and Varela theories synergistically co-operate [25, 36].
On the other hand, as we show here, some experimental
evidences can be captured by biasing the bit strings representing the epitopal expression of antibodies. Hence,
we address questions such as, What is the underlying
topology, if any? How does the topology affect the responses of the system? Does the network live above the
percolation threshold, or is it made of several independent clusters? How do these quantities evolve with time?
These are questions of crucial importance within a systemic approach to our understanding of immunological
reality.

It should be remarked that, given the huge amount
of antibodies making up the repertoire, and given the
high intrinsic component of randomness in their genesis
at the genetic level [38], a pure random, unbiased formation of antibodies can be justified in a first approximation. Nonetheless, this approach underlies some limits
which are now briefly summarized. First, we notice that
proteins (in a immunological context, antibodies) purely
randomly generated would not fold (or at least not all)
into stable and functional structures [37]. Moreover, during the ontogenesis, each new B cell generated (and consequently each new antibody) is tested against self: in
the bone marrow, newborn lymphocytes able to interact
strongly with self molecules are deleted so to avoid autoimmune reactions [38]. As a consequence of this learning process, the final repertoire is biased. A further bias
is due to the continuous antigenic stimulation and consequent production and reshape of optimal antibodies.
Therefore, antibody structures get biased both through
their genomic origin and as a result of the several external
stimuli (adaptation to evolution). The latter effect suggests that the ”effective degree of bias” can be considered
as a raw measure of aging in a mature system: as time
elapses and new external antigens are experienced, the
repertoire gets more and more specific and, accordingly,
more and more biased; correspondingly the average connectivity is expected to decrease. In fact, for instance, in
[29], the authors show that the high connectivity of newborn antibodies is lost in adult mitogen-reactive B-cell
repertoires.

3
III.

THE MODEL

In a healthy human body at rest, it is estimated that
the total number of clones generated from a single B-cell
(and therefore exhibiting the same idiotypicity) is about
102 to 104 and that the total number of B-cells amounts
to some 1012 − 1014 , hence, the distinct clones is about
108 − 1012 . As for antibodies, their number is about 1018
and the number of idiotopes/paratopes [59] from which
they are built, determining the idiotypicity of a given
antibody, is estimated to be relatively small, i.e., of the
order of 102 − 103 .
For our purposes, immunoglobulins (Igs) and antigens
can be described in the same way, namely, by means
of a binary string ξ encoding the particular sequence
of idiotopes/paratopes that characterize their structure.
Therefore, by comparing the strings ξi and ξj of two given
agents, labeled i and j, respectively, one can determine
their degree of affinity and state whether they are likely
to recognize each other and, if so, how strong the interaction is.
Now, the specificity encoded by ξi will characterize not
only antibodies but also the clone, labeled i, secreting
that kind of antibodies. In particular, our system is made
up of an ensemble of M × N lymphocytes, which can
occur in two states: quiescent, i.e., secreting a low dose of
Ig; and firing, i.e., secreting high doses of Ig. The status
of a given lymphocyte is therefore described by the binary
variable σiι = ±1, where i = 1, ..., N distinguishes the
idiotipicity, while ι = 1, ..., M , distinguishes lymphocytes
belonging to the same ith clone (in principle, M may
depend on the clone considered): σiι = +1 corresponds
to the firing state, while σiι = −1 corresponds to the
quiescent state.
In this way, if immunoglobulins ξi and ξj are affine
enough, the corresponding clones i and j can be thought
to be in “interaction”, because a firing state of clone
i, yielding a high concentration of immunoglobulin ξi ,
will be detected by lymphocytes belonging to clone j,
which will react properly. These facts can be envisaged
by means of a network of mutually interacting lymphocytes.
Let us now introduce the main definitions of the
model. Antibodies and antigens are modeled as binary strings representing the possible expression of L idiotopes/paratopes. The assumption that each antibody
can be thought of as a string of the same length L is
based on the observation that “all the gamma-globulins
have structural characteristic surprisingly similar” [39].
Hence, the L idiotopes
ξ 1 = (1, 0, 0, ..., 0),
ξ 2 = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0),
...
L
ξ = (0, 0, 0, ..., 1),
may act as a base in such a way that a generic antibody ξi
can be decomposed as a linear combination ξi = λ1i ξ 1 +

µ
L
λ2i ξ 2 + ... + λL
i ξ , with λi ∈ (0, 1) accounting for the
expression (1) of the µth idiotope on the ith antibody or
its absense (0).
We introduce biased strings by assuming that each entry µ of the ith string is extracted randomly according to
the distribution

P (ξiµ = 1) =

(1 + a)
(1 − a)
, P (ξiµ = 0) =
,
2

(1)

with a ∈ [−1, +1]. In this way, when a = 0, we recover
the previous unbiased model [24] and, in general, the
average similarity between a pair of strings can be tuned
via a as hξiµ ξjµ i ∼ (1 + a)2 /4. As we will see, Eq. (1)
provides a basic way to bias the repertoire, which allows
us to study the direct effects on the network performance;
more refined models can of course be obtained.
Given a couple of clones, say i and j, the µth entries of the corresponding strings are said to be complementary, iff ξiµ 6= ξjµ . Therefore, the number of
complementary entries χij ∈ [0, L] can be written as
PL
µ
µ
µ
µ
χij =
µ=1 [ξi (1 − ξj ) + ξj (1 − ξi )]. Of course, χij
strongly depends on the correlation parameter a and, in
turn, it directly affects the affinity between i and j. In
fact, the non-covalent forces acting among antibodies depend on the geometry, on the charge distribution and
on hydrophilic-hydrophobic effects which give rise to an
attractive (repulsive) interaction for any complementary
(non-complementary) match. In principle, once the protein folding problem is solved [37], the whole analysis
of this kind of network could be extremely simplified by
directly studying the VDJ genes and their reshuffling;
however, as this bridge among micro and meso biological
scenarios is lacking, we rely on ”effective descriptions.”
In particular, we assume that each complementary/noncomplementary entry yields an attractive/repulsive contribution [40, 41]; the ratio between their intensities is
denoted by the positive parameter α. Hence, we introduce the measure for the affinity between ξi and ξj ,
fa,α,L (ξi , ξj |a) ≡ [αχij − (L − χij )],

(2)

which ranges from −L (when ξi = ξj ) to αL (when all
entries are complementary, i.e. ξiµ ≡ 1 − ξjµ , µ = 1, ..., L).
Now, when the repulsive contribution prevails, that is,
fa,α,L ≤ 0, the two antibodies do not see each other
and the coupling among the corresponding lymphocytes
Jij (a, α, L) is set equal to 0; conversely, when fa,α,L > 0,
we take as Jij the exponential of the affinity. This choice
is the simplest trial able to mimic a key-lock mechanism
for a sharp pattern recognition. Thus, we have:
Jij (a, α, L) ≡ Θ(fa,α,L (ξi , ξj |a)) ·
· exp[fa,α,L (ξi , ξj |a)],

(3)

where Θ(x) is the discrete Heaviside function returning
1, if x > 0, and 0, if x ≤ 0 [60]. Indeed, the expression in Eq. (3) ensures that the coupling strength
among lymphocytes spans several orders of magnitude

4
(Jij ∈ [0, exp(αL)]), as expected from experimental results [43].
One could possibly introduce a proper normalization in
order to fix an average value for the coupling strength,
which in turn fixes a scale for the level of noise ruling
the thermodynamics of the system. This procedure is
allowed due to the fact that, as the system is a ferromagnet, the average coupling is positive definite and that,
for a given size N , couplings display an upper bound.
Nonetheless, the normalization is somehow arbitrary and
does not qualitatively affect the behavior of the system.
As for our current aims, we can neglect this and take
Eq. (3) as an effective definition for the coupling strength
between node i and node j.
We also stress that N and L are intrinsically connected
to each other. This can be easily seen in the case where
the match among antibodies had to be perfect for reciprocal recognition; then, in order to reproduce all possible
antibodies obtained by the L idiotopes/paratopes, the
immune system would need N = 2L lymphocytes. Here,
having relaxed the hypothesis of perfect match, only a
fraction of this quantity needs to be retained to manage
the whole repertoire, and we can introduce the following
scaling between the number of all possible idiotypically
different lymphocytes and the effective size of the repertoire:
L = γ log N,

(4)

where γ > 0.
In order to quantify immune responses one can introduce the set of observables

where the first term on the right hand side represents the
mutual interaction among lymphocytes, while the second term accounts for the interaction with an antigen k
present at concentration c and whose coupling with the
i-th clone is hki (see [24, 44] for further details). Interestingly, these two terms encode the Jerne and Burnet
theories, respectively.

given by |V | = N , that is the total amount of idiotypically different clones. The topological properties of G
are completely determined by the adjacency matrix A
defined as Aij = 1 if Jij 6= 0 and Aij = 0 if Jij = 0.
For instance, the degree P
of a node i (i.e. coordination
number) is given by zi = j∈V Aij . In the following, we
provide the main definitions and formula to describe the
topology of the emergent graph and later we will deepen
its global features.
First, let us introduce the probability that a string ξi

If we forget, for the moment, the weights of the couplings, the N different B clones, interacting pairwise, define a graph G = {V, Γ}, where V denotes the set of
nodes and Γ the set of links. The cardinality of V is

compatible with (ρi , ρj ) and such that fα,L (ξi , ξj ) > 0,
namely, recalling Eq. (8),

show a multimodal behavior as long as two consecutive
modes have disjoint supports.
In general we expect that, when a is close to 0, peaks
merge since, at low bias, the link probability weakly depends on ρ (see also FIg. IV), which is uniformity, while,
when a is close to 1, most of the modes are off and the
network is sparse. Therefore a very multimodal distribution is expected only for intermediate values of a. Indeed,
these arguments are corroborated by Fig. (3) which shows
different plots of P degree (z; a, α, L, N ) for different values
of a; also notice that numerical data are finely fitted by
the analytical calculation of Eq. (15).
Consistent with the remarks in Sec. I, an increase in
a basically encodes a set of ageing effects; in fact we can
envisage that, in the antenatal period, when lymphocytes
can not encounter antigens, a is close to 0, and the immune system is not specialized in any particular antigen response: There is no multi-modal behavior in the
degree distribution and the underlying B-cell network is
roughly uncorrelated. Then, after the birth, lymphocytes
start matching some antigens and undergo clonal expansion and, consequently, hypersomatic mutations: the system begins to specialize, and the connectivity starts to
decrease. The degree distribution starts to exhibit a
fine structure, where peaks correspond to specific subpopulations that have survived as a consequence of the
antigen encountered in the past.

(14)

As evidenced in the previous subsection, a crucially
affects the topology of the idiotypic network. We therefore investigate in more detail the global connectivity of
the system in terms of P link (a, α, L, N ). To compute this
quantity, one would plug Eq. (8) into Eq. (9) and (12).
However, since here we are interested in the large
√ L limit
and relative fluctuations in ρ decrease as 1/ L, we can
adopt a mean-field like approach and approximate Eq.
(7) as
P (ρ; a, L) ' PM F (ρ; a, L) = δ(ρ − ρ̄),

FIG. 3: (Color on line) Degree distribution for different values of a and fixed α = 1.2, N = 10000, γ = 10. From left to right:
a = 0.1 (uni-modal behavior; the mean degree is about 0.8N ), a = 0.3 (multimodal behavior; the mean degree is 0.5N ), and
a = 0.6 (there is no extensive network; the average degree is 0.03N ).

is easy to see that this is given by χ = L/2. Then, via
Stirling approximation, we get
log P link (a, α, L, N ) ∼ f (a)L,

(19)

where f (a) = (1 + a) log(1 + a) + (1 − a) log(1 − a) − (1 +
2a)/4 log(1 + 2a) − (1 − 2a)/4 log(1 − 2a) is a symmetrical
monotonically decreasing function from a = 0 to a =
±1/2 and roughly plays the role of an (compressed in
the interval [−1/2, +1/2]) entropy of the bit-strings, such
that, as in other biased approaches [42], a can be thought
of as the ”bit-string magnetization”.
Therefore, we can write
P link (a, α, L, N ) ∼ N γf (a) .

(20)

In this way, as the degree of bias a is increased, the graph
turns from highly connected (P link = O(1)) to diluted
(P link ∼ N −γc , with c = log(27/32)/2). Similar results
can be found for a different parameter range.
C.

Clustering Coefficient

The local clustering coefficient is defined as the number
of triangles stemming from a node i over the maximum
number of triplets centered on i itself (see, e.g., Refs.
[3, 45, 46]). Due to the “anti-transitive” nature of the
idyotipic network, triangles, i.e., 3-cycles, are expected
to be unlikely, while quadrilaterals, i.e. 4-cycles, are expected to be favored. Roughly speaking, an antibody
Ab1 elicits its anti-antibody Ab2, which in turn elicits
the anti-anti-antibody Ab3, whose structure should be
close to Ab1’s, so that a 4-cycle finally develops.
Indeed, this was partially shown in Ref. [24], where
an idiotypic network and an analogous Erdös-Rény (ER)

graph, namely, a purely random graph exhibiting the
same average degree z̄ were compared, obtaining that the
former displays on average a significantly smaller number of triangles. We now extend those results considering
also 4-cycles (devoid of diagonals). Given a node i with zi
nearest neighbors, the number of expected squares stemming from i, in the case where i belongs to a random ER
graph and in the case where it belongs to our idiotypic
network, are respectively
 
zi
QER (zi ) =
(N − 1 − zi )p2 (1 − p),
(21)
2
 
zi
Q(zi ) =
(N − 1 − zi )p02 (1 − p00 ),
(22)
2
where p = z̄/N , p0 is the probability that in G a neighbor
of i is linked to a node not belonging to the ith neighborhood, and p00 is the probability that two neighbors
are linked. The latter is just the clustering coefficient
for node i, which, as shown in Ref. [24], is smaller for
a graph where links are based on complementarity features, so that (1 − p) ≤ (1 − p00 ). Moreover, the idiotypic
and the ER graphs we are comparing display, by construction, the same coordination number. If we impose
this condition to be true also for the average degree of
any site j that is linked with i, we get
00

z¯j = 1 + p (zi − 1) + p0 (N − zi − 2)
= 1 + p(zi − 1) + p(N − zi − 2).

(23)

Therefore, as p > p00 , we get p < p0 and finally Q(zi ) >
QER (zi ). More generally, this suggests that in our idiotypic networks, as links are based on complementarity,
4-cycles are motifs while 3-cycles are anti-motifs [24, 47].

COUPLING AND WEIGHTED DEGREE
DISTRIBUTIONS

In Sec. IV we studied the bare topology of the network,
while here we focus on the properties related to the distribution of weights Jij associated with links (i, j). As
mentioned above, these features retain a strong biological
meaning. For instance, nodes displaying a high weighted
degree feel, under normal conditions, a larger (internal)
quiescent stimulus [36].

Coupling distribution

Given two nodes i and j with ρi and ρj non-null entries, respectively, recalling Eqs. (2) and (3), the coupling
distribution is
P (Jij |ρi , ρj ; α, L) =

log(Jij )+L
P (χij =
; ρi , ρj , L) if Jij > 1
α+1
, (24)
=
0
if Jij ≤ 1
where Jij can span over [1, eαL ].
To obtain the mean coupling probability one should
average Eq. (24), so P (χ; ρi , ρj ) of Eq. (8), over the
binomial distribution of ρi and ρj in Eq. (7). To give an
analytical estimate of this quantity, as in section IV B,
one can use a mean-field like approach, namely Eq. (17).

all lymphocytes in the neighborhood of i are quiescent,
PN
the local field acting on i is just ϕi = − j=1 Jij mj =
wi . This remark allows to establish a correlation between
weighted degree of node i and role of the i-th clone, i.e.
either self or non-self addressed [24].
In general, wi depends on the number of nearestneighbors zi and on the coupling with each of them. So
we define the weighted degree probability as follows:
P (wi |ρi , zi ; a, α, L) =
zi
X
X
P (Ji1 |ρi ) . . . P (Jizi |ρi ) δ(wi −
Jij ) . (29)
j=1

Ji1 ....Jizi

Now, averaging over all the possible numbers of
nearest-neighbor,
X
P (wi |ρi ; a, α, L) =
P (zi |ρi ; a, α, L)P (wi |ρi zi ; a, α, L)

several multimodal distributions are superposed, giving
rise to the complicated structure shown in Fig. 8. Otherwise stated, ρi may univocally determine a range for
the degree zi [leading to a multimodal Pdegree (z)], but
zi , in turn, does not univocally determine a range for wi .
The “reshuffling” between bare and weighted degrees can
be seen in the scatter plots in Fig. 8 and it is mirrored
by the non-trivial structure of P (w). As a result, nodes
that are lazier in reacting to antigenic stimulation are
not necessarily those with a large number of neighbors,
but, rather, those with a large weighted degree; the two
subsets cannot be trivially mapped into each other.
It is worth emphasizing that, as the weighted degree is
a sum of exponential factors, the support of P (w) covers
several orders of magnitude, in both the connected and
the disconnected regimes. This is consistent with the coexistence of agents highly (poorly) susceptible with respect to external stimuli, i.e. nodes with small (large) w.
This difference has been attributed to the self-addressed
or non-self-addressed attitude of lymphocytes [28, 30],
and, interestingly, it also survives in the underpercolated
regime.
In particular, we can introduce the relations
hwi ∼ N hJi ,
Var [w] ∼ N Var[J],

(32)

which hold as long as the couplings insisting on the same
nodes can be approximated as independent. The expressions in Eq. (32) have been used to fit the numerical data
in Fig. (9).
Finally, we stress that the support of P (w) remains
spread over several order of magnitude also in the region
of the parameter space where the network is underpercolated (see Sec. VI): This suggests that the existence
of an extensive Jerne-like network may not be strictly
necessary for self/non-self discrimination in a systemic
way.

and averaging over nodes we obtain the mean degree distribution

ρi

This is the theoretical description of the distributions in
Fig. 7 which were obtained by numerical simulations of
the network. The weighted degree distribution displays
a fine structure similarly to Pdegree (z) (see Sec. (IV A)),
and even a “hyperfine” structure. This is ultimately due
to the fact that Eq. (29), being a sum of terms that can
be localized in the w range, can, by itself, display a multimodal distribution. When summing over ρi in Eq. (31),

As explained before, an increase in the bias parameter
a corresponds to a progressive smoothing of the repertoire variability. A growth in a also results in a dilution
of the graph itself, eventually leading to percolation phenomena (see Fig. (11)).
In order to study this process, we compare its features
to those pertaining to an ER random graph GER (N, p),
where links are drawn independently with probability
p = z̄/N , in such a way that the average degree is the
same for both networks.
Therefore, the evolution of G(N, p) as p ranges from 0
to 1, eventually leading to a percolation transition (see,
e.g., [49, 50]) is compared to the evolution of our graph
G(a, L, α) as a ranges from 0 to 1.

In order to evaluate the impact of removing ties, we
measure the relative size of the largest connected component S as a function of the fraction of links left f .
In general, as a ranges from 0 to 1, S gets continuously
smaller: nodes with large ρ are those more likely to remain isolated or to form small clusters. Differently from
the ER case, beyond the giant component, clusters typically display a small size. As evidenced in Ref. [45], these
features give rise to a rather gentle percolation transition.
In order to clarify this point, we focus on the evolution
of the internal organization of clusters by measuring the
distribution N (a, s), representing the number of clusters
of size s present when the correlation parameter is a.
As shown in Fig. (10), as a grows, the typical clus-

value of ρ much lower than its average value are likely to
act as (local) hubs. This picture is confirmed by the fact
that k-stars with large k have a higher mean coupling
(see Fig. 12, right).
Moreover, in our simulations we never find isolated triangles (3-loop) or quadrangles (4-loop), which are instead
present in random graphs.

ter size shrinks from N (a unique giant component) to 1
(there are only isolated nodes). For instance, at α = 0.7,
when a = 0.46 there are a few isolated nodes and a giant component whose typical (normalized) size is around
0.8. On the other hand, when a = 0.60 most nodes are
isolated, S ≈ 0.39 and the typical size of the remaining
nodes is around 4.2. Beyond isolated nodes and the giant
component, the statistics of cluster size is rather uniform,
suggesting that minor disconnected clusters display small
sizes, i.e., s < 10.

B.

Emergence of small components

The difference between our idiotypic network and a
random graph is emphasized by the analysis of the emergence of motifs around the the percolation threshold. We
study the number of isolated k-loops, namely, unicycles
of length k, and isolated k-stars, namely, subgraphs made
of a central node connected to k nodes with unitary degree. In an ER graph these quantities follow

which are drawn for comparison in Fig. 12. In the
idiotypic network the above-mentioned components are
present in a smaller range of a, and the number of all
stars, except the dimers (1-star), is eventually larger than
ER predictions. This is due to the bias characterizing
strings, as it makes the percolation transition smoother in such a way that components not belonging to the giant
component hardly develop - and induces inhomogeneity
among nodes - in such a way that those associated with a

In this work we studied a class of weighted random
networks aimed to describe the mutual interactions between cells inside the B-branch of the immune system.
As in previous works [25, 36], the Burnet clonal expansion theory [31, 33] appears to be the standard one-body
response of the system described by the Hamiltonian of
Eq. (6), while the Jerne theory is ruled by the two-body
term, whose coupling encodes the Varela prescription.
The main novelty introduced is the existence of a biased repertoire: The parameter tuning the ”mean field
similarity” among the epitopes (the entries in the bitstrings encoding for antibodies) is a scalar a ranging from
0 (completely random) to 1 (completely deterministic).
From a biological viewpoint, the extension to a value
a 6= 0 is a step toard more realistic descriptions, since
antibodies are not completely random objects [51] and
since during ontogenesis in bone marrow, a part of the
strongly self-reacting repertoire is killed [38, 52]. General
findings [53, 54] and recent investigations (achieved in
the study of the zebra fish repertoire [55][26]) show that
the ensemble of the genetic heritage dedicated to antibody formation is used in a highly inhomogeneous (Zipflike) way, suggesting that some epitopes can be highly
over-expressed compared to others. Although this would
imply the use of an aµi (with the price of a highly untractable mathematics), we skipped the fine dependence
in favor of a simpler mean field choice aµi = a 6= 0 for
all the epitopes [61]. This introduction of bias indeed
gives rise to striking, at least qualitatively, effects: In a
broad range of a 6= 0, the degree distribution displays
a multi-modular structure which mirrors the history of
the system itself. Such fringes in the (weighted) degree
distribution were experimentally noted in the pioneering
investigations by Varela and coworkers and an immunological interpretation was provided in Refs. [28, 30, 48].
Although based on synthetic data, our analysis extends
these findings in some details, suggesting the existence
of a hyperfine structure, richer than the one obtained by
sampling over the experimentally available subset of the
repertoire. Furthermore, the reshuffling among modes of
the network raises the question of which should be the
physical observable to characterize the reaction attitude
of nodes: the bare degree (which is actually the standard
one checked in experiments) or, rather, the weighted connectivitys which we claim to be the most relevant; We
hope to report further investigation on this point soon.
Here, we just stress that, while the average degree varies

over a linear scale, the weighted degree displays a distribution with a log-normal like envelope, hence spanning
several order of magnitude. This spread is robust as it
holds also also for regimes of high dilution (corresponding
to large a): Interestingly, this implies that mechanisms
such as self/non-self discrimination may work despite a
truely over-percolated network of B-cells.
A progressive increase in a eventually leads to an
under-percolated network, where nodes not belonging to
the giant component typically form small-size clusters,
which mirrors the cascades of anti-antibodies commonly
seen in experiments (see e.g. [34]). Further, the local

topology displays squares as motifs and triangles as nonmotifs, as expected from a complementary-based network, which is in agreement with experiments on idiotypic networks too.
Moreover, we stress that the general picture in which
the network starts with a high connectivity, then specializing its responses lets the coordination number decrease
(and a grows in our model) describes here a ”thermodynamical growth process” as, once the network reaches the
percolation threshold, its entropy remains positive even
at a zero noise level: allowing a dynamics on a, that is
slower with regard to the σ, the evolution ”naturally”
shifts a to a nonzero value to maximize the entropy of
the system [62].
In future investigations, several experimental-based refinements and improvements are in order to achieve better predictive power. In particular, a change in the
idiotope/paratope distributions toward mathematically
challenging but biological more plausible choices [26]
should be analyzed, and a clear relation among the mature repertoire and the bias received during ontogenesis
[56] should be determined too.

an immune response. There, antibodies able to attack

strongly enough to the pathogen will undergo to somatic
rearrangement to increase further their specificity against
the enemy. As a consequence, as they will try to be the
same ”mirror” of the enemy, they will increase their correlation and decrease the reciprocal capability of binding.
At this level of description we skip ”details” as the development of memory cells or the isotopic switch of anticorpal subfamilies e.g. IgM,IgG,IgA.
We stress that we are dealing with a symmetric theory
and as in several other representations (e.g. [14] and reference therein) epitopes and paratopes are thought of as
equivalent such that we will use indiscriminately the term
idiotype for both of them.
The effect of the theta function is to remove those links
whose strength is mathematically different from zero,
but, from a practical point of view are so weak that whatever level of noise would clean them as well.
Clearly biasing the repertoire, both the networks gained
trough aµ
i or a share a reduction of the connectivity
because the over-expression of a particular epitope increases the probability of finding it in two randomly chosen strings and consequently lowers their binding affinity.
Below the percolation threshold, a positive entropy even
in the zero noise limit is clearly not a violation of Nernst
theorem because the system trivially factorizes in independent subsystems.
