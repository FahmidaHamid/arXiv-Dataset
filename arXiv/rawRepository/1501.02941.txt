In biological cells and novel diagnostic devices biochemical receptors need to be sensitive to
extremely small concentration changes of signaling molecules. The accuracy of such molecular
signaling is ultimately limited by the counting noise imposed by the thermal diffusion of molecules.
Many macromolecules and organelles transiently bind to molecular motors and are then actively
transported. We here show that a random albeit directed delivery of signaling molecules to within a
typical diffusion distance to the receptor reduces the correlation time of the counting noise, effecting
an improved sensing precision. The conditions for this active focusing are indeed compatible with
observations in living cells. Our results are relevant for a better understanding of molecular cellular
signaling and the design of novel diagnostic devices.

Cellular signaling relaying external or internal biochemical cues typically involves low copy numbers of messenger molecules, inevitably effecting appreciable fluctuations in the count of molecular binding events at specific
receptors [1–12]. A similar limitation by counting noise
is encountered in modern microscopic diagnostic devices
to which sensitivity is a key factor [13]. Modern microscopic techniques reveal molecular signaling events and
underline their inherent stochasticity in living cells [14–
17]. Nevertheless molecular signaling pathways in biological cells operate at remarkable precision [18, 19].
The first heuristic argument about noise limitation to
biological concentration measurements is due to Berg
and Purcell assuming biochemical receptors to count the
number N of specific molecules in a volume equal to
their linear dimension a [2]. N is then limited by Poissonian noise δN ∼ hN i1/2 . The time between two independent measurements is set by the time τD ∼ a2 /D
needed to clear the volume by diffusion, D being the
molecular diffusivity. Averaging over a time τm thus
allows to Nm ∼ τm /τD independent measurements, re1/2
ducing the noise by the factor Nm . The relative accuracy to measure a background concentration hci is thus
δc2 /hci2 ∼ (Dahciτm )−1 [2]. When the additional binding dynamics to the biochemical receptor is explicitly
taken into account, this relative error becomes [1]

The first contribution stems from the Markovian
(un)binding to the receptor at detailed balance conditions with binding rate kon and average receptor occupancy hni. The second term is the diffusional noise, up
to the factor π identical to the result by Berg and Purcell [2]. The prefactor of the diffusive term in Eq. (1)
was recently refined heuristically [11]. Inspired by the
early ideas of Berg and Purcell a number of studies unraveled the crucial role of diffusional noise in biochemi-

cal signaling [4, 5, 7–10] along with additional features
such as receptor cooperativity [3] and facilitated diffusion [12]. Various experiments suggest that cells indeed
operate very close to the fundamental accuracy limit [1].
Here we extend the result (1) to the case when the
signaling molecules are not only freely diffusing in the
cell but actively transported along cellular filaments by
motor proteins [20, 21] effecting intermittent ballistic excursions [22–25]. Such an additional active component
occurs when extracellular signaling molecules are taken
up by the cell via endocytosis: the molecules are engulfed into submicron lipid vesicle and then intermittently transported through the cell by motors [26]. A
similar combination of free diffusion and active transport
occurs when virus particles invade a living cell [27]. However, even free molecules such as messenger RNA may attach to motors [28], or proteins move in directed fashion
due to cytoplasmic drag [29]. To incorporate the active
component we employ the theory of random intermittent
search for hidden targets [30] which was recently used to
analyze reaction kinetics in active media [31]. We show
that active transport enables both faster as well as more
accurate sensing: an active noise floor exists, but it can
be significantly lower than the purely diffusive counting
noise (1). This active focusing reduces the noise correlation time and enables the receptor to detect relative
changes in concentration with higher accuracy. Our results also have direct implications to the design of active
components in microscopic synthetic diagnostic systems
based on molecular signals [13].
Model. We consider a signaling particle (vesicle, virus,
mRNA, or protein) in 3-dimensional cellular space, randomly switching between a passive diffusion phase p with
diffusivity D and an active ballistic phase a with velocity v(Ω) of constant magnitude v = |v| [32] in the direction of the solid angle Ω following a Markovian dynamics (Fig. 1). Assuming ideally disordered cytoskeletal filament orientations, the spatial direction of active

Speed. We assume that the system equilibrates on a
time scale over which the signaling molecules move a distance L of the order of the cell size (or that of a cellular compartment). At this stage we neglect the analytereceptor binding dynamics and adopt a probabilistic view
of Eqs. (3). The equilibration time τi is then defined by
the mean squared displacement (MSD), h|r(τi )|2 i = L2 .

motion events is uniformly distributed. The duration of
active/passive phases is exponentially distributed with
mean τa,p [33]. The concentrations of freely diffusing and
motor-bound signal particles are cp (r, t) and ca (r, Ω, t).
A receptor with radius a is placed at r0 . Then the fractional occupancy n(t) of the receptor by a signal particle
evolves according to a mean field kinetic scheme obeying
detailed balance with on/off rates kon/off ,
dn(t)/dt = kon cp (r0 , t)(1 − n(t)) − koff n(t).

Assuming that the particle (un)binds to (from) the receptor only from (to) the passive mode [31], the coupled

The signaling typically occurs in two stages. In the initial phase a change in the concentration of the signaling
particles occurs either by exchange with the extracellular
space [19, 34] or by variation of the production and/or
degradation rates. Upon re-equilibration (assumed to be
much faster than the measurement time τm ) the receptor
reads out the concentration over the time τm in the measurement phase. In a diagnostic device equivalent phases
will be observed after sample immersion and during detection periods. In an optimal signaling setup equilibration should be as fast as possible while the measurement
phase should be as precise as possible. We now quantify
the speed and precision of the two signaling phases.

Over a period of duration τa +τp , during which the directional persistence in the active phase causes a nonlinear
time dependence of h|r2 (t)|i and hence a local violation
of the central limit theorem, an effective diffusive regime
h|r2 (t)|i ≃ t is established. Eq. (4) is a transcendental
equation for τi , essentially depending on only three parameters: the typical distance covered
p in the active and
passive phases, xa = vτa and xp = Dτp , and the Péclet
number P e = Lv/D. To estimate the efficiency of active
trafficking with respect to diffusion we compare τi with
the purely passive equilibration time τ0 ≡ L2 /(6D). The
results for various P e values (see Fig. 2e)) typical for
biological systems are shown in Fig. 2a)-d).
Active transport is more efficient for larger particles
(small D) in larger domains, a direct consequence of
the finite motor velocity and instantaneous directionality of active motion. Namely, in terms of the MSD
diffusion and active motion display different time scaling (≃ t versus ≃ t2 ): considering only pure passive
and active motion for P e < 6 diffusion is more efficient. In the intermittent case the motion has a transient period of duration τa + τa , which corresponds to a
parameter-dependent combination of both regimes during the relaxation towards the equilibrium partitioning
between phases a and p. After this transient period an
effective diffusive regime is established with diffusivity
Deff = (D +x2a /(3τp ))/(1+τa /τp ), which may or may not
be larger than D. τi can thus be smaller or larger than
τ0 . Trafficking of vesicles with D . 10−2 µm2 /s therefore
mostly profits from active motion, whereas active motion
of smaller proteins with D ∼ 10µm2 /s will only be more
efficient over large distances as in eukaryotic cells (especially for neurons), and only if accompanied by significant
phases of passive diffusion. The observed features explain
why it is profitable for a cell to use active transport for
trafficking of larger particles [18, 35], despite demanding
more cellular resources. Similarly, active diagnostics [13]
can be faster and hence allow for a higher throughput.
Precision. Since the precision of the receptor measurement of the signal molecule concentration should
be maximized we consider small deviations from the

improves the speed. For small proteins in eukaryotic cells and large proteins in prokaryotic cells (10 . P e . 102 ), in addition to
large xa a large xp is necessary for active transport to be more efficient. For P e . 10−1 active transport is always less efficient.

the binding/unbinding transitions via kon hcp i/koff =
exp(F/[kB T ]), where F is the binding free energy [36].
Solving Eqs. (3) and following the ideas of Ref. [1] we use
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to obtain the power
spectrum of the concentration fluctuations. Within the
linear response regime and for receptor measurement

Compared to Ref. [1] for passive diffusion our result (5)
differs by the dimensionless factor Λ(xa , xp ) in the second
term, for which always Λ(xa , xp ) ≤ 1 holds [36].
We now focus on the transport controlled regime in
which kon hcp i, koff ≫ τa−1 , τp−1 and kon hcp i/koff ≫ 1.
Hence we neglect the first term in Eq. (5) and consider
the remaining active noise floor. If the active excursions

which has the lower bound Λmin ∼ (πxp /a)2 [1−(πxp /a)2 ]
as xp /a → 0. This might suggest an approach towards an
infinite absolute precision of the transport term as xp →
0. However, at fixed total concentration ctot of signaling
particles in the transport controlled regime we have that
hcp i = ctot /(1 + τa /τp ) corresponding to hcp i → 0 as
xp → 0, hence diverging relative fluctuations. Therefore,
there still exists a noise floor to active sensing but it can
be significantly reduced as explained below.
We gauge the sensing precision at equal ctot and equal
hcp i, corresponding to the lower and upper bounds for
the gain of active focusing. For equal ctot we compare
the relative accuracy of measuring different concentrations of freely diffusing molecules in active and passive
sensing, finding that the precision is always worse for active transport as compared to free diffusion (Fig. 3a)-c)
and asymptotic results in e) and f)) and becomes worse
with longer active excursions. The reason is that despite
reducing the absolute fluctuations by active dynamics we
are measuring smaller and smaller effective concentrations. Conversely, Figs. 3d)-f) shows that if we compare
the precision at identical concentration ctot (1 + τa /τp ) of
free molecules the accuracy can be improved significantly

as long as xp . a (otherwise, in this regime active trafficking does not affect sensing precision). The ingredients necessary to understand this reduced counting noise
are: (i) only fluctuations on a scale ∼ a are relevant for
the sensing accuracy and (ii) the receptor only ’sees’ free
particles. Hence, at finite temperatures perfect signaling
corresponds to the situation in which upon release from
the receptor the particles immediately bind to a motor
and are swept away over distances > a. Concurrently
diffusive displacements must be . a to assure focused
delivery in the sense that any unbinding form the motor
only contributes if it occurs at |r − r0 | . a. This reduction of local concentration fluctuations by means of
intermittent active excursions is exactly the active signal
focusing mentioned above.
Conclusion. The last years have seen significant activity to explore the counting noise for purely diffusive
scenarios [1–11] and to analyze the speedup of receptor binding due to the topological coupling of one- and
three-dimensional diffusion for gene regulation in the facilitated diffusion model [12, 37]. In this Letter we fill the
apparent gap in the quantitative assessment of the counting noise experienced by biochemical receptors measuring the local concentration of signaling molecules or com-

pounds in the case when an active transport component
is present. This occurs for various signaling particles
(proteins, mRNA molecules, vesicles containing signaling
molecules, or viruses) by direct shuttling of these signaling cues by molecular motors or by cytoplasmic drag.
Compared to the purely diffusive signaling considered
so far we showed that the counting noise (the limit to
accurate receptor measurement) for active sensing can
become significantly reduced due to active focusing. The
only contributions to the counting noise stem from particles, which are actively transported to within the particle’s typical free diffusion distance to the receptor. This
reduces the correlation time of the receptor occupancy
noise and renders the averaging over a measurement time
τm more efficient. The importance of active signaling in
cellular regulation is well recognized [38]. In agreement
with our results, in biological systems active transport is
indeed employed to move larger particles (e.g., vesicles or
viruses) with intrinsically small D [19, 22–24, 27, 35]. As
a result even during longer periods of detachment from
motors these particles barely move [18, 22–24, 35]. The
typical experimental values xa ≃ 0.5 − 10µm [23–25, 35]
for a ≃ 1 − 10nm in fact fulfill the requirements of our
model for signal focusing. However, as discussed here also

5
smaller particles such as mRNA and proteins experience
active motion components [28, 29], effecting active focusing for their detection. In living cells the motor tracks are
often not ideally disordered, as assumed here, but biased
towards the receptor [38]. An expected net directional
bias towards the receptor, while not impeding signal focusing as long as xa ≫ a and xp . a [33], would enhance
the rate of delivery and simultaneously increase the local
concentration hcp (r0 )i at the receptor for equal ctot . Signal focusing is thus inherent to active cellular signaling.
Conversely, despite the great technological advance over
the past years, molecular motor-powered diagnostic devices have not yet demonstrated a performance beyond
the existing passive techniques, but a large superiority is
much anticipated [13]. Our results confirm these expectations and present a first rigorous theoretical basis for
their systematic improvement and development.

In this Supplemental Material we summarise the calculations and full results for active transport coupled to reversible
binding to a receptor.
SPEED

In this part we neglect the binding to the receptor (see main text for argumentation) and invoke a probabilistic
interpretation of the model (i.e., concentrations → probability densities). By Laplace transforming Eqs. (2) and (3)
in the main text in time and Fourier transforming in space, (r, t) → (k, s) can be solved for c̃a and c̃p . The Laplace
image of the mean squared
displacement (MSD) for a particle starting at the origin in the passive phase is obtained
R
from h|r2 (s)|i = −∇2k ( c̃a dΩ+ c̃p )|k=0 and interchanging the order of differentiation with respect to k and integration
with respect to Ω:

h|r (s)|i =

which can be inverted exactly to give Eq. (4) in the main text. The equilibration time τi is defined implicitly by
h|r2 (τi )|i = L2 , L being the linear dimension of the cell or its compartment. The transcendental equation for τi is
solved numerically.
SENSING PRECISION

The Fourier transformed linearized Eqs. (1) read
−iωδñ(ω) = −τc−1 δñ(ω) + kon (1 − hni)δ c˜p (r0 , ω) + koff hniβδ F̃ (ω)
−iωδ c˜a (k, Ω, ω) = −(iv(Ω) · k + τa−1 )δ c˜a (k, Ω, ω) + (4πτp )−1 δ c˜p (k, ω)

where we have used the constraint imposed by detailed balance δkon /kon − δkoff /koff = δF/(kB T ) when linearizing
the first of Eqs. (1) in the main text. Solving for δñ(ω) we obtain

We are interested in the low-frequency limit and hence take Ψ(k, ω) ≃ Ψ(k, 0). In this limit the integral over ϕ in
Ψ(k, ω) can be evaluated as a contour integral along the unit circle via the method of residues, while the second one
is amenable directly leading to
Ψ(k, 0) =

where k ≡ |k|. Using Eq. (S5) we can obtain δñ(ω) as a function of δ F̃ (ω) explicitly. The linear response function of
the receptor occupancy (the coordinate) to a change in the free energy difference between bound and freely diffusing
species (the thermodynamically conjugate force) is then δñ(ω)/δ F̃ (ω) and is related to the power spectrum of n via
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem Sn (ω) = 2/(βω)Im[δñ(ω)/δ F̃ (ω)]. A change in concentration is equivalent to a
change in F as a consequence to a change in chemical potential, δcp /hcp i = βδF . Using this it can be shown [1] that
Sc (ω) = (βhcp i)2 |δñ(ω)/δ F̃ (ω)|−2 Sn (ω) leading to

We assume that the receptor measures and averages the concentration over a time τm much longer than any correlation
time. We are thus interested in the low frequency limit Sc (ω → 0) leading to δc2p = Sc (ω → 0)/τm and hence take
Ξ(k, ω) ≈ Ξ(k, 0). Finally, cutting the integral in the inverse Fourier transform |k|max = π/a to correct for a finite
target size (and thereby avoid the UV divergence) we arrive at Eq. (5) in the main text with

(S7)

The integral in Eq. (S7) can be evaluated exactly in the limits when the active excursions are either very short
xa /a ≪ 1 or very long xa /a ≫ 1 compared to the size of the target and gives Eqs. (6) and (7) in the main text.
Now we have to evaluate the equilibrium concentration in the passive phase in the general case, where signaling is
not necessarily transport controlled. In absence of a directional bias the concentration will be uniform
R in both the
active and passive phase. Hence we only need to solve a system of linear equations for hni, hcp i and hca idΩ. It can
be shown that the steady state concentration of freely diffusing molecules hcp i is given by

where V is the volume of the cell or its domain. For koff /(kon hcp i) → 0 we obtain hcp i = ctot /(1 + τa /τp ), where for
convenience we have absorbed the term 1/V in the total concentration ctot − V −1 → ctot . Expressing the ratio τa /τp
