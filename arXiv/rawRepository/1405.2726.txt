Promoter strength, or activity, is important in genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Evidences show that a constitutive promoter with certain strength for one given RNA can often be

reused for other RNAs. Therefore, the strength of one promoter is mainly determined by its nucleotide sequence. One of the main difficulties in genetic engineering and synthetic biology is how
to control the expression of certain protein in one given level. One usually used way to achieve
this goal is to choose one promoter with suitable strength, which can be employed to regulate the
rate of transcription and then leads to needed level of protein expression. For this purpose, so far,
many promoter libraries have been established experimentally. However, theoretical methods to
predict the strength of one promoter from its nucleotide sequence are desirable. Since such methods
are not only valuable in the design of promoter with specified strength, but also meaningful to
understand the mechanism of promoter in gene transcription. In this study, through various tests
one theoretical model is presented to describe the relationship between promoter strength and its
nucleotide sequence. Our analysis shows that, promoter strength is greatly influenced by nucleotide
groups with three adjacent nucleotides in its sequence. Meanwhile, nucleotides in different regions
of promoter sequence have different effects on promoter strength. Based on experimental data for
E. coli promoters, our calculations indicate, nucleotides in -10 region, -35 region, and the discriminator region of promoter sequence are more important than those in spacing region for determining
promoter strength. With model parameter values obtained by fitting to experimental data, four
promoter libraries are theoretically built for the corresponding experimental environments under
which data for promoter strength in gene expression has been measured previously.

INTRODUCTION

In cells, a small variety of expression of some protein may influence cell metabolism seriously. In synthetic biology,
many models have been presented to describe the metabolic network [1, 2]. According to these models, it often needs
to express a certain kind of protein (especially enzyme) in a specific intensity. One of the widely used ways to do this
is to adjust the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding promoter [3–6].
A promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene [7, 8], see Fig. 1. In gene expression,
the genetic information coded in nucleotide sequence of DNA should be firstly transcribed into message RNA (mRNA),
which is performed by enzyme RNA polymerase (RNAP) [9, 10]. Usually, the transcription process begins with the

binding of RNAP to one specific upstream region of the target gene, which is called promoter [11, 12]. Experiments
show that, with different promoters, the protein production rates, or the strengths of gene expression, will be different
[3, 6, 13]. Therefore, the rate of gene transcription to mRNA is regulated by the nucleotide sequence of promoter
(for simplicity, in this study, promoters are assumed to be constitutive, i.e. transcription rate of the corresponding
downstream gene is not influenced by transcription factors, for related discussions about translation factors one can
see [14, 15]). Due to the requirement of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, the production rates of certain
proteins, especially some enzymes, should be regulated detailedly. One of the ways to attain this aim is to choose
specific promoter sequence to get needed rate of transcription (another efficient way is to choose specific ribosome
binding site sequence, i.e. RBS sequence, to regulate the rate of translation [6, 16]).
In order to achieve this goal, many promoter libraries corresponding to large-scale strength of gene expression have
been built experimentally [3, 13, 17–23]. Since it has been experimentally verified that the activity of a promoter can
be reused among different kinds of proteins [6, 18, 24, 25], these promoter libraries are valuable to the regulations of
metabolic networks involving many different kinds of proteins. The establish of promoter libraries is of great important
to the development of synthetic biology. However, reliable mathematical models to describe the relationship between
promoter strength and its nucleotide sequence are much desirable. Since such models can not only reduce the
experimental expense in building further promoter libraries, but also can help us to understand the mechanism of
promoter during gene transcription. More importantly, such models will make it easier to get needed promoter with
specific expression strength, and then will be valuable in genetic engineering and synthetic biology.
In the last twenty years, many studies have been done to build quantitative relationship between promoter strength
in gene expression and its nucleotide sequence. It has been discovered early that, in E. coli promoters, the -10
region hexamer and -35 region hexamer are strongly conserved, and they are much important for determining the
expression strength of promoter [10, 26, 27]. But recent experimental data shows that promoter strength also depends
on nucleotide types in the spacing region of promoter sequence [23], and may also depend on the discriminator
region. Where spacing region is the promoter sequence region between the most conserved -10 region and -35 region,
and discriminator region is the sequence region between the -10 region and transcription start site, see Fig. 1(d).
Therefore, it becomes much difficult to build reasonable theoretical models to describe the relationship between
promoter sequence and its strength, since there may be too many factors or variables which may affect the promoter
strength.
In [28], one modular position weight matrix model is presented to evaluate the contribution of promoter sequence to
its strength. Where promoter score, which correlates with protein-DNA binding energy and consequently correlates
with promoter strength, is obtained as one linear combination of scores for each active promoter sequence modular and
an additional penalty term for nonoptimal modular, with the sequence modular scores obtained by basic principles
of statistical physics. Similar idea has also been used in [8, 29] to try to understand the promoter strength from its
nucleotide sequence. Meanwhile, in [15], based on a large number of experimental data for strengths and sequences
of E. coli lac promoters, an adapted energy matrix for RNAP binding to promoter is statistically determined. Based
on this energy matrix, one thermodynamic model is designed in [30] to predict promoter strength from its nucleotide
sequence. On the other hand, by using support vector regression method and the distribution of specific nucleotides
at each position of promoter sequence, which is obtained in [26] and based on 168 E. coli promoter sequences, one
strength prediction skill of E. coli promoter from microarray data is provided in [31]. They found that several non-

3
consensus nucleotides in the -10 region and -35 region of promoter sequences act positively on the promoter strength,
while certain consensus nucleotides have only a minor effect on the strength.
Although many related studies have shown that the consensus sequences (-35 and -10 regions) are most essential to
determine the strength of promoter [19, 32–34], and actually for the sake of simplicity most of the existing models are
based on such assumption, recent experimental data for promoter strength obtained by Wang’s study group in [23]
indicates that nucleotide types in spacing region of promoter sequence are also not neglectable. With different spacing
sequences but keeping -10 region and -35 region unchanged, the expression strength of promoter may vary between
31 and 105 (in unit relative intensity of red fluorescent per OD600 , i.e. RIRF/OD600 ). For simplicity, this study
assumes that gene transcription will initiate as soon as one RNAP binds to its upstream promoter, and the nucleotide
sequence of gene is not too long. Then for low concentration of RNAP, which assures that the elongation of mRNA
(i.e. the motion of RNAP along DNA) will not be jammed [35, 36], the transcription rate will mainly be determined
by the binding rate of RNAP to promoter. Biophysically, RNAP binding rate to promoter can be roughly written
as k = k0 e−∆G/kB T . Where k0 is one rate constant which depends on RNAP concentration and other experimental
environments, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ∆G is the free energy barrier of RNAP
binding to promoter which is mainly determined by the promoter sequence. Generally, the energy barrier ∆G may
depend on the secondary structure of promoter, and may also depend on the concentrations of transcription factors
for nonconstitutive promoters. But this study assumes that ∆G can be completely determined by the nucleotide
sequence of promoter, and the main focus in the following is to find one reasonable method to get energy barrier ∆G
from the nucleotide sequence of promoter.
One immediate idea to get energy barrier ∆G is to assume that ∆G can be approximated by one linear combination
of energy barriers ∆Gi contributed by each nucleotide in the promoter sequence. Here i is the index of position of
nucleotide in promoter sequence. This idea is similar as the ones previously used in [8, 28, 29, 37]. The main difference
between the idea here and the previous ones is as follows. In the previous methods, such as the one used in the modular
position weight matrix model in [28], ∆G is assumed to be determined only by some so called active modules, including
-35 region, -10 region, discriminator region, transcription start region, and the contribution from other suboptimal
regions is only included as one penalty term which depends only on their lengths of nucleotide sequences. As have
been mentioned previously, recent experimental data presented in [23] indicates promoter strength also changes with
the nucleotide types in spacing region. So we need to calculate the energy barrier contribution ∆Gi from nucleotide
in any position i of promoter sequence. There are several possible ways to get ∆Gi , which base more or less on basic
principles of statistical physics [28, 38, 39]. For example, the energy barrier contribution of one nucleotide at position
i with type b (b = A, T, G or C) can be obtained as ∆Gb,i = ln((nb,i + 0.005N )/(N + 0.02N )/pb) [28]. Where nb,i
is the number of nucleotide b at position i in the aligned sequences, N is the total number of promoter, and pb is
the theoretical probability of finding each type of nucleotide (usually pb = 0.25 is used), and 0.005 and 0.02 are just
two other model parameter values. Such method may be theoretically sound, but our calculations indicate it is not
reasonably good to describe the experimental data of promoters in [23].
If the types of nucleotide at different positions of promoter sequence are independent to each other, then due to
principles of statistical physics, the probability that there is one base b at position i is related to the free energy ∆Gb,i
by pb,i = exp(−∆Gb,i /kB T ). By replacing probability pb,i with frequency nb,i , we then get ∆Gb,i ≈ −kB T ln nb,i .
Where the frequency nb,i is obtained from the 168 promoters of E. coli compiled in [26]. The total energy barrier

4
∆G for one given promoter sequence can then be obtained by ∆G =

P

∆Gb,i , with b the nucleotide at position i.

However, this model can not fit to the recent experimental data presented in [23] well, see Fig. S1(a) in Supplemental
Material [40].
In recent paper [15], based on experimental data of E. coli lac promoters, one 4 × 75 parameter matrix M is built,
which is used to describe the interaction of RNAP with promoter region from position -1 to position -75. Where the
matrix element Mb,i represents the contribution to this interaction from having a base b at position −i in the promoter
sequence. Using this parameter matrix M , the total energy barrier for RNAP binding to one promoter can be known,
and so the corresponding expression strength can be obtained. This parameter matrix has been employed by Brewster
et al. in [30] to build one theoretical model to predict the strength of promoter, and its accuracy has been validated
in the design of promoter with specific strength. However, our test shows that such method is not satisfying when it
is employed to describe the recent experimental data presented in [23], see Fig. S1(b) in Supplemental Material [40].
One common characteristic of the three methods discussed above is that, the energy barrier ∆G of RNAP binding
to promoter is assumed to be one linear combination of energy barriers ∆Gb,i contributed by each nucleotide in
promoter sequence. The failures of these methods in describing the recent experimental data presented in [23] implie
that this assumption of independence and additivity of energy barriers may not be generally true, though it may
be approximately reasonable in some special cases and has been validated previously for transcription factor binding
sites of promoter [41]. Therefore, this assumption needs to be modified to be more reasonable. One immediate way
to do this is to assume that the energy barrier ∆G of RNAP binding to promoter is one linear combination of the
ones contributed by all nearest-neighbor (NN) nucleotide groups in promoter sequence. For convenience, this study
assumes that the energy barrier contributed by one NN nucleotide group is equal to the energy obtained by NN
model in the study field of nucleic acids [42]. Which has actually been used in some software packages, such as
NUPACK [43], to calculate the folding free energy of nucleic acid sequence to determine its secondary structure. In
NN model, the total energy of one given nucleic acid sequence is obtained as the summation of energies contributed
by each NN nucleotide groups, and one additional term according to the initial nucleotide, see the corresponding
values listed in Fig. S1(d) [40]. For example, the energy of sequence CGTTGA at temperature 37o C is obtained as
∆G = ∆G(CG)+∆G(GT)+∆G(TT)+∆G(TG)+∆G(GA)+∆G(init.) = −2.17−1.44−1.00−1.45−1.30+(0.98+1.03)
(excerpted from Ref. [42]). With one additional parameter to indicate the average level of experimental environments,
the fitting results of this model are plotted in Fig. S1(c) [40]. Unfortunately, this model is also not satisfactory.
The failure of the above NN method to predict promoter strength, i.e. the failure in calculating energy barrier ∆G
of RNAP binding to promoter, may due to following two reasons. (1) In the NN method, no difference is included
among energy contributions from nucleotide groups in -10 region, -35 region, discriminator region, and spacing region.
As mentioned above, previous studies have shown that the -10/35 region may be more important for determining
promoter strength. So the nucleotide (group) in -10/-35 region should contribute more to the RNAP binding energy
∆G. (2) The energy barrier ∆G may also depend on large nucleotide groups, at least on nucleotide groups with
three adjacent nucleotides. In the following, we will test new models which do not have at least one of the above two
weaknesses.
Firstly, we test the model which includes nucleotide position explicitly, where the energy barrier ∆G of RNAP
binding to promoter is assumed to be linear combination of ∆Gb,i and ∆Gbb̄,i . Here ∆Gb,i is the energy barrier
contributed by one nucleotide b at position i, and ∆Gbb̄,i is the energy barrier contributed by one nearest-neighbor

5
nucleotide group bb̄ with nucleotide b at position i and nucleotide b̄ at position i + 1. For convenience, in the following,
this model is called POSITION2 model. One main difficulty in such model is, compared with the known experimental
data, there are too many model parameters. For example, if the promoter sequence comprises of 35 nucleotides,
then there will be 35 × 4 + 34 × 42 = 684 model parameters. To avoid the overfitting problem, we used the partial
least squares (PLS) regression to get parameter values. Where the principal component number, i.e. the number of
independent model parameters, is chosen by 10-fold cross-validation. With the chosen principal component number,
both the mean residual of all promoter strength between measured values and theoretical values, and the mean
residual in 10-fold cross-validation are reasonably low, see Fig. S2(a,b) in Supplemental Material [40]. In this study,
the experimental data includes a total of 422 promoters, with their nucleotide sequences and strengths presented in
Refs. [6, 13, 23] respectively. Due to the different experimental environments used in measuring promoter strengths,
including temperature, RNAP type and concentration, and lots of other conditions in transcription and translation
processes, in this model as well as other models used in the study, extra constants are added to total energy barrier
∆G to stand for these differences. For experimental data from different references, these extra constants will be
different, and their values are also obtained by PLS regression. Meanwhile, to know if there are real differences
between the energy barrier contributions from nucleotides in -10 region, -35 region, discriminator region, and spacing
region, another extra constant is added to distinguish the length of promoter spacing region. The possible lengths
of spacing region in the experimental data used in this study are 16, 17 and 18. With seven principal components,
the fitting results of the POSITION2 model are presented in Fig. S2(c) [40]. Where the mean residual between the
experimental data and theoretical values is around 61 (in arbitrary unit), see Fig. S2(a) in Supplemental Material
[40]. From the model coefficient values plotted in Fig. S2(d,e,f) [40], one can see that the contributions to total energy
barrier ∆G from -10 region, -35 region, and discriminator region are larger than those from the spacing region for
promoters with any length of spacing region. Here the model coefficients are obtained by an inverse transform from
the values of the seven principal components.
One may argue that one of the reasons that the above NN model is not good enough to describe the relationship
between promoter strength and sequence is that, the values of ∆Gbb̄ given by Ref. [42] for energy barrier contribution
from nearest-neighbor nucleotide group bb̄ may not be accurate enough (see also the values listed in Fig. S1(d) in
Supplemental Material [40]), or they may not be generally right for any nucleic acid sequence. In order to exclude
this reason, we have tested one generalized model, called GROUP2 model, in which the energy barrier ∆G of RNAP
binding is assumed to be one linear combination of ∆Gb and ∆Gbb̄ . Different with the above NN model, ∆Gb and
∆Gbb̄ here are obtained by PLS regression. However, from the plots in Fig. S2(a,b) [40], one can see that the GROUP2
model is actually less accurate than the above POSITION2 model.
As mentioned previously, another possible reason for the failure of NN model to describe the relationship between
promoter sequence and strength is that, the promoter strength may also depend on large nucleotide groups (with at
least three adjacent nucleotides), but not only on independent nucleotides and nucleotide groups with two neighboring
nucleotides. We may need to point out that, models with nucleotide groups of size only 3 implicitly include the cases
of size 1 and 2. But, for the sake of comparison of contributions to the total energy barrier ∆G of RNAP binding
to promoter, from nucleotide groups with different sizes, our model includes all possible nucleotide groups with size
1, 2, and 3. For convenience, such model is called GROUP3 model. In GROUP3 model, there are also too many
unknown model parameters which need to be fitted from experimental data, altogether 4 + 42 + 43 = 84. Therefore,

6
PLS regression is also used in the data fitting process to determine model parameter values, in which the principal
component number (i.e. the number of independent model parameters) is determined by reducing both the mean
residual between promoter strengths from experimental data and from theoretical model, and the mean residual of
promoter strengths in 10-fold cross-validation, see Fig. S3(a,b) in Supplemental Material [40]. With eight principal
components, the fitting results are presented in Fig. S3(c) [40]. From the model coefficient values plotted in Fig.
S3(d) [40], one can see that contributions to total energy barrier ∆G of RNAP binding from nucleotide groups with
three adjacent nucleotides are relatively larger than those from nucleotides or nucleotide groups with two neighboring
nucleotides.
Based on the above two test models, the POSITION2 model and the GROUP3 model, we conclude that the
energy barrier ∆G of RNAP binding to promoter depends on nucleotide groups with three adjacent nucleotides.
Meanwhile, the contributions of nucleotide (groups) to ∆G from different regions of promoter sequence are different.
Therefore, it seems more reasonable to use one combined model to describe the relationship between promoter strength
and sequence, in which both nucleotide groups with size up to three and their positions in promoter sequence are
explicitly considered. Undoubtedly, there will be too many unknown parameters in such combined models. For
example, if each promoter has 35 nucleotides and there is no missing nucleotide in promoter sequence, the number
of model parameters will be 35 × 4 + 34 × 42 + 33 × 43 = 2796. Meanwhile, as mentioned previously, during data
fitting extra parameters are also added due to the difference of length of promoter spacing region and the difference of
experimental environment to measure promoter strength. Therefore, PLS regression should also be used to determine
the values of model parameters. With reasonable low value of mean residual between theoretical model predictions
and experimental data of promoter strengths, and mean residual of 10-fold cross-validation, the principal component
number of this combined model is chosen to be seven, see Fig. S3(a,b) in Supplemental Material [40]. With these
seven principal components, the theoretical results of this combined model (for convenience, this model is called
POSITION3 model) are plotted in Fig. 2(a). The mean residual between theoretical predictions and experimental
measurements of promoter strengths is about 59 (in arbitrary unit), see Fig.S3(a). From the plots in Fig. 2(b,c,d),
one can easily see that the nucleotide groups in -10 region, -35 region, and discriminator region have more effects on
promoter strength. Meanwhile, the effects of nucleotide groups with three adjacent nucleotides are also nonnegligible,
see Fig. S4 in Supplemental Material [40].
Using the POSITION3 model and genetic algorithm, four promoter libraries are calculated (see Fig. 3, and the Excel
files in supplement materials for the corresponding promoter sequences), which correspond to the four experimental
environments under which the data used in this study are obtained [6, 13, 23]. These libraries will be helpful for the
synthesis of promoter with specific expression strength. Using the same methods, promoter libraries corresponding
to any other experimental environments can also be theoretically built, but with one extra step during which the
model constant corresponding to the given experimental environment should be determined firstly by initial promoter
samples. Combining our model here for promoter strength with the calculation method for ribosome binding site
sequence [6, 16], the gene expression, including transcription and translation, can be regulated to given strength
detailedly.
In conclusion, in this study one theoretical model for describing the relationship between promoter strength and
sequence is presented. Our study shows that the nucleotides in -10 region, -35 region, and the discriminator region
have more effects on promoter strength than those in spacing region. Meanwhile, promoter strength depends more

7
on nucleotide groups with three adjacent nucleotides than on single nucleotides and nucleotide groups with two
neighboring nucleotides. Using our model, promoter libraries with wide range of expression strength are theoretically
obtained.

FIG. 1: Schematic depiction of gene expression, including transcription process and translation process. The transcription is
initiated by the binding of RNA polymerase to promoter (a). With the motion of RNAP along unpaired DNA, message RNA
(mRNA) is then produced with the genetic information coded in DNA (b). During the translation process, the previously
obtained mRNA is then used to assemble amino acids into protein (c). The rate of protein production can be regulated by
the sequence of promoter. In E. coli, promoter sequence contains two short sequence elements approximately -10 and -35
nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. The sequence at -10 (called -10 region or -10 box) has the consensus
sequence TATAAT. The sequence at -35 (called -35 region or -35 box) has the consensus sequence TTGACA (d).

are altogether 422 promoters obtained in [6, 13, 23] respectively, see also the description in Fig. S1 [40]. The parameter values
(or model coefficients) of POSITION3 model are obtained by PLS regression with seven principal components, see Fig. S3 [40].
To show the difference of nucleotide contributions to promoter strength between nucleotides (or nucleotide groups) in spacing
region of promoter sequence and nucleotides (or nucleotide groups) in other regions, the fitted parameter values of POSITION3
model are plotted in (b,c,d). Where the data points drawn at horizontal coordinates 1, 2, 3, 4 are corresponding to nucleotides
in -35 region, -10 region, discriminator region, and spacing region respectively [see Fig. 1(d)]. The lengths of promoter spacing
region in (b,c,d) are 16, 17, and 18 respectively. The plots in (b,c,d) imply that, generally nucleotides in -10/-35 region and
discriminator region are more important for determining the strength of promoter, see also Fig. S2(d,e,f) [40].

FIG. 3: (Color online) Promoter libraries theoretically obtained by the POSITION3 model and genetic algorithm. Where
the model parameter values are obtained by fitting to the experimental data measured in [6, 13, 23]. (a) 90 promoters with
expression strength between 31-104 with the same measuring environment as in [23]. (b) 20 promoters with one of the measuring
environments in [13] to build their promoter library. (c) 200 promoters with the same measuring environment as in [6] to build
their modular promoter library (MPL), and (d) 400 promoters with the same measuring environment as in [6] to build their
randomized promoter library (RPL).
