Abstract
Many foraging animals find food using composite random search strategies,
which consist of intensive and extensive search modes. Models of composite
search can generate predictions about how optimal foragers should behave
in each search mode, and how they should determine when to switch between search modes. Most of these models assume that foragers use resource
encounters to decide when to switch between search modes. Empirical observations indicate that a variety of organisms use non-directional sensory
cues to identify areas that warrant intensive search. These cues are not
precise enough to allow a forager to directly orient itself to a resource, but
can be used as a criterion to determine the appropriate search mode. As
a potential example, a forager might use olfactory information as a nondirectional cue. Even if scent is too imprecise for the forager to immediately locate a specific food item, it might inform the forager that the area
is worth searching carefully. We developed a model of composite search
based on non-directional sensory cues. With simulations, we compared the
search efficiencies of composite foragers that use resource encounters as
their mode-switching criterion with those that use non-directional sensory
cues. We identified optimal search patterns and mode-switching criteria
on a variety of resource distributions, characterized by different levels of
resource aggregation and density. On all resource distributions, foraging
strategies based on the non-directional sensory criterion were more efficient
than those based on the resource encounter criterion. Strategies based on
the non-directional sensory criterion were also more robust to changes in resource distribution. Our results suggest that current assumptions about the
1

role of resource encounters in models of optimal composite search should be
re-examined. The search strategies predicted by our model can help bridge
the gap between random search theory and traditional patch-use foraging
theory.

1. Introduction
For many organisms, the ability to efficiently find food resources is a
key determinant of fitness (Bell, 1991). It is advantageous for foraging
animals to focus search effort on resource rich areas and minimize energy
spent searching resource poor areas (Viswanathan et al., 2011). This search
tactic has been termed composite search (Plank and James, 2008), arearestricted search (Weimerskirch et al., 2007), or area-concentrated search
(Benhamou, 1992). A forager using a composite search strategy alternates
between intensive and extensive search modes. In intensive mode, a forager
thoroughly searches resource rich areas by making short moves and reorienting frequently; in extensive mode, it moves directly across resource poor
areas by making long, relatively straight moves with minimal turning.
Composite search behavior is widespread, observed in taxa as diverse as
slime moulds (Latty and Beekman, 2009), beetles (Ferran et al., 1994), honeybees (Tyson et al., 2011), fish (Hill et al., 2003), birds (Nolet and Mooij,
2002), ungulates (Tyson et al., 2011), turtles (Tyson et al., 2011), weasels
(Haskell, 1997), and humans (Hills et al., 2013). Given the ubiquity of composite search, an important question arises: how should a forager determine
when to switch from intensive to extensive mode, and vice versa? Questions
about optimal foraging have traditionally been addressed with patch models that envision intensive search taking place within patches and extensive
search as movement between patches (Charnov, 1976; Oaten, 1977). These
models are not directly applicable to cases where resources do not occur

in well-defined patches, and instead take on more general spatial distributions (Arditi and Dacorogna, 1988). Optimal foraging on such landscapes
is more properly addressed using random search theory (James et al., 2010;
Reynolds and Rhodes, 2009; Viswanathan et al., 2011). In random search
models, resources are represented as points, and animal movement is modeled with stochastic processes. Unlike patch models, random search models
are spatially explicit; resource locations in these models can be specified
according to any spatial point pattern and are not limited to the case of
clearly defined patches.
Recently, many studies have compared the efficiencies of different random search movement patterns (James et al., 2008, 2011; Reynolds and
Bartumeus, 2009), and composite searches have been a particular focus
(Benhamou, 2007; Plank and James, 2008; Reynolds, 2009, 2010a). The
criteria that foragers use to switch between modes have received far less attention. Most analyses of optimal composite search presume that foragers
use a “giving-up time” (GUT) as their mode-switching criterion (Plank and
James, 2008; Reynolds, 2009, 2010a; Scharf et al., 2007). A forager using
this criterion switches from extensive to intensive mode upon encountering
a resource. It then stays in intensive mode until a fixed amount of time (the
GUT) has elapsed without a subsequent resource encounter. GUT models
accurately describe some foraging situations, such as ladybird beetle larvae
(Coccinella septempunctata) feeding on aphids (Carter and Dixon, 1982)
and houseflies (Musca domestica) feeding on sucrose drops (Bell, 1990).
Rather than keeping track of time, many animals use sensory cues
to modulate their search behavior. Parasitoids like Nermeritis canecens
(Waage, 1979), Venturia canescens (Bell, 1990), and Cardiochiles nigriceps
(Strand and Vinson, 1982) use chemical cues to determine when to search intensively for hosts. When deciding when to leave a foraging site, wolf spiders
rely more heavily on visual and vibratory cues than elapsed time since their
last prey encounter (Persons and Uetz, 1997). Procellariiform seabirds use
chemicals like dimethyl sulfide to identify when to switch to intensive search
behavior (in this case, intensive search consists of upwind zig-zag movement)
(Nevitt et al., 2008). These seabirds “use changes in the olfactory landscape
to recognize potentially productive foraging opportunities as they fly over
them” (Nevitt, 2008). Further examples of animals that use sensory cues to
determine search mode include ciliates like Paramecium and Tetrahymena
(Leick and Hellung Larsen, 1992; Levandowsky and Klafter, 1988), bacteria,
like Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Adler, 1975; Dusenbery,
3

1998; Moore and Crimaldi, 2004), cod larvae (Døving et al., 1994), and fruit
flies (Dalby-Ball and Meats, 2000). It is important to note that identifying discrete behavioral states (e.g., search modes) from empirical movement
data is a difficult problem; fortunately, significant progress has been made
in this area (Barraquand and Benhamou, 2008; Knell and Codling, 2011;
Nams, 2014; Postlethwaite et al., 2013).
There are two primary ways that organisms use sensory cues to find resources: taxis and kinesis (Codling et al., 2008; Dusenbery, 1989). In taxis,
an organism uses sensory cues (e.g., the gradient of a stimulus field) to orient
itself and move toward the resource. In kinesis, an organism uses sensory
cues to determine its speed (orthokinesis) or turning frequency (klinokinesis). Unlike taxis, kinesis does not use directional information. Taxis is
an efficient strategy used by many organisms (Seymour et al., 2010), but in
some situations limitations on sensory information make it impractical; Hein
and McKinley (2012) note that such limitations occur when sensory signals
are infrequent, noisy, or contain limited directional information. When organisms are unable to extract directional information from sensory cues,
they may still be able to use kinesis. In this paper, we refer to the cues used
in kinesis as non-directional sensory cues. We use this term to contrast
with directional sensory cues, which allow foragers to orient their motion
toward resources. Most foragers likely use a combination of non-directional
and directional sensory cues. For example, a forager might use odor as a
non-directional cue to determine where to search intensively; when it comes
close to a resource, it might switch to using visual information as a directional cue and move directly to the resource. A forager that uses odor
as a non-directional cue when the signal is dilute and the odor gradient is
imperceptible might switch to taxis (using odor as a directional cue) when
it is close to a resource and the odor gradient is more pronounced. Two
specific examples illustrate how foragers use non-directional sensory cues.
Williams (1994) proposes that tsetse flies search for targets using kinesis,
with carbon dioxide concentration serving as a non-directional sensory cue.
Williams hypothesizes that winds in typical tsetse fly habitats are too light
and variable to allow for taxis based on wind direction. Juvenile flatfish
use kinesis to find bivalves (Hill et al., 2000, 2002); respiratory currents
generated by the bivalves are likely the non-directional sensory cue in this
system.
In this study, we model two classes of composite search strategies: those
with mode transitions triggered by resource encounters and elapsed time
4

(the GUT criterion), and those with mode transitions triggered by nondirectional sensory cues. Our modeling framework allows for a full spectrum
of random movement patterns for both intensive and extensive mode. We
used simulations to compare the efficiencies of different search strategies.
Searching efficiency depends in part on the spatial distribution of resources
(Cianelli et al., 2009), so we compared search strategies on a variety of
landscape types, characterized by different levels of resource aggregation
and density. Further, we examined the performance of the search strategies
in response to changes in resource aggregation to test the robustness of the
search strategies to environmental change. We found that the search strategy based on non-directional sensory cues outperformed the search strategy
based on resource encounters across all landscape types, and was more robust to changes in resource aggregation.
2. Methods
2.1. Overview
In our modeling framework, resources are represented as points distributed across a two-dimensional landscape, and a forager is represented
as a moving point with a small fixed detection radius. The forager moves
at a constant speed, and when a resource falls within its detection radius,
the forager moves in a straight line to the resource and consumes it; otherwise, the forager implements a random search strategy. Random search
strategies consist of a set of probabilistic movement rules. Although the resulting movement patterns are stochastic, the probability distributions that
generate the movement provide a structure for the search.
In accordance with many theoretical studies on optimal random search
behavior (e.g., James et al. 2008; Reynolds 2010a; Viswanathan et al. 1999),
our model is very general, and parameters are not fit to any particular
species. The distance and time units in our simulation set the characteristic
distance and time scales of the system. These units could be quantified in
terms of meters and seconds to represent a specific system. Our simulations
use a square landscape 101 units in length and width, and foragers have a
detection radius of 0.5 units. Coordinates are floating point numbers, and
are not restricted to discrete values. Like many random search simulations
(e.g., Reynolds 2009), we focus on a case where the detection radius is less
than 0.01 of the landscape scale.

2.2. Lévy walks
Lévy walks are stochastic processes that provide a versatile tool for
modeling animal movement (Bartumeus et al., 2013; Reynolds and Rhodes,
2009; Viswanathan et al., 2011). A Lévy walk with parameter µ is a random
walk with step lengths l drawn from a Pareto distribution, p(l) ∼ l−µ ,
1 < µ ≤ 3. Different values of µ produce different types of random walks.
As µ → 1, the resulting random walk approaches ballistic (i.e., straight-line)
motion. Random walks with step lengths drawn from a Pareto distribution
with µ ≥ 3 behave like Brownian motion. Thus, Lévy walks can be seen as
spanning a spectrum of movement behavior, ranging from ballistic motion
(µ → 1) on one extreme to Brownian-like motion (µ = 3) on the other (for
details see, A.1). This family of random walks is a widely used modeling
tool (e.g.,Viswanathan et al. 1999).
Lévy walks are not to be confused with Lévy flights. In the former, a
forager moves continuously along each step length; in the latter, a forager
hops instantly from the start to the end of each step length. Lévy walks
model cruise foragers, while Lévy flights model saltatory foragers (for more
on this distinction, see James et al. 2010).
Most Lévy walk models, including those considered in this study, are
technically truncated Lévy walks: step lengths are terminated when a resource or boundary is reached, or when the maximum time of the simulation
elapses (Reynolds and Rhodes, 2009). Fortunately, many of the important
features of Lévy walks, including general properties of the mean-square displacement, are retained by truncated Lévy walks (Mantegna and Stanley,
1994; Viswanathan et al., 2008). For more details, see A.1.
Our model deals with both non-composite and composite foragers. Noncomposite foragers move by Lévy walks with parameter µ. Composite foragers switch between extensive and intensive search modes. In extensive
search mode, foragers move according to a Lévy walk with parameter µext .
In intensive search mode, foragers move according to a Lévy walk with parameter µint . Previously, composite searches have been modeled with Brownian motion in the intensive mode and ballistic motion in the extensive mode
(Benhamou, 2007; Plank and James, 2008). This was later generalized to
consider a full range of Lévy walks in extensive mode (Reynolds, 2009). Our
model represents a further generalization that allows a full range of Lévy
walks for both intensive and extensive search modes.
Correlated random walks provide another approach to modeling movement on the ballistic to Brownian spectrum. This approach has been used
6

with great success (Benhamou, 2007, 2013). The Lévy walk and correlated random walk approaches are compatible, and are mathematically connected (Reynolds, 2010b). We used Lévy walks to build our models, because
they offered a straightforward way of implementing non-directional sensory
mode-switching criteria (as described in section 2.4). Future studies should
examine how our models can be translated into a correlated random walk
framework.
A recent review by Pyke (2015) suggests that the enthusiasm with which
many ecologists have embraced Lévy walks is misplaced. In the discussion,
we address how his criticisms of the Lévy walk concept apply to our model.
2.3. Forager movement
In our model, a forager moves by selecting a heading and a step length.
The heading is randomly selected from a uniform distribution on [0, 2 π).
The step length is selected from a Pareto distribution with parameter µ (for
a non-composite forager), µint (for a composite forager in intensive mode),
or µext (for a composite forager in extensive mode). The procedure for
simulating ballistic motion was an exception that will be described at the
end of this subsection.
For non-ballistic motion, the selected heading and step length together
determine a random walk step. The forager moves along a random walk
step at a uniform speed of 0.25 units per time step. The forager’s speed
determines how finely its movement is discretized, and 0.25 was the smallest
speed that allowed for practical simulation. It takes a forager many time
steps to complete a typical random walk step.
If the forager encounters a resource while it is moving along a random
walk step, it truncates the random walk step, moves to the resource, and
consumes the resource. Consumed resources are not replaced; hence our
simulations represent destructive foraging (resource depletion). If a forager
reaches a landscape boundary before completing a random walk step, it
truncates the random walk step (details on boundary conditions are provided in section 2.5). When a forager ends a random walk step, whether
that step is truncated or not, it randomly selects another heading and step
length, and the procedure repeats.
Simulations of ballistic motion (µ → 1) do not use Pareto distributions
to generate step lengths. A forager using ballistic motion selects a heading
and moves in that direction until it encounters a resource or landscape
boundary.

2.4. Mode-switching criteria
Our model considers two type of composite foragers: GUT foragers,
which use resource encounters as their search mode criterion, and sensory
foragers, which use non-directional sensory cues as their search mode criterion. A GUT forager switches from extensive to intensive search when it
encounters a resource. After encountering a resource, the forager reverts to
extensive search as soon as a specified time (the GUT) elapses without a
subsequent resource encounter.
For sensory foraging, we created a generalized non-directional sensory
field. We denote the intensity of non-directional sensory cues generated by
a resource located at yi detected at a location x by fyi (x). The shape of the
function fyi (x) will depend on the particular sensory mechanisms involved;
here, in order to make the model as general as possible, we assume that the
strength of non-directional sensory cues generated by a resource at yi follow
the probability density function of a Gaussian distribution with variance σ 2
centered at yi . This is particularly appropriate if, for example, the sensory
cues are chemical signals that travel via diffusion. For more specific cases,
other distributions could be used to generate the non-directional sensory
field (for example, the sensory field could be designed to account for how
advection transports chemical cues or how vibratory signals are propagated
through various media). The total non-directional sensory field isPobtained
by superimposing the fields produced by each resource, f (x) = i fyi (x).
When a resource is consumed, its contribution to the non-directional sensory
field is removed.
A non-directional sensory forager assesses the sensory field at the end of
every random walk step (note that it does not assess the sensory field after
every time step). If the value of the field is below a specified threshold, the
forager engages in extensive search; if it is above the threshold, it engages in
intensive search (Fig. 1). We call this threshold the sensory field threshold
and abbreviate it as SFT. A forager has more opportunities to assess the
sensory field in intensive mode (which is composed of many short random
walk steps) than in extensive mode (which is composed of a few long random
walk steps). This assumption reflects a trade-off between the attention
devoted to movement versus monitoring the sensory field.
It is important to note that the sensory forager and the GUT forager
each have distinct advantages. The sensory forager has the benefit of using
non-directional cues, but the GUT forager has the benefit of using elapsed
time since its last resource encounter. It is not a priori obvious which of

Resources are black dots on the two-dimensional landscape (bottom). The radius of a
dot is the forager’s detection radius. A non-directional sensory field (red surface) is
generated by the resources. A non-directional sensory forager has a fixed threshold
(green plane) that it uses as a mode-switching criterion. When a forager reaches the end
of a step-length, it assess the sensory field; if the field is above the threshold value (circled
areas on landscape), the forager engages in intensive search. The forager’s movement is
represented by the blue line. In this case, it eventually consumes a resource (red disk).

these abilities leads to higher foraging efficiency. In reality, many foragers
probably use a combination of sensory and GUT strategies. In this study, we
focus on comparing these strategies in isolation; future work could examine
how these strategies can be used together.
2.5. Landscape characteristics
Resources were distributed across landscapes according to Neyman-Scott
processes (Illian et al., 2008). We selected this point process because it
allowed us to adjust both the intensity and aggregation of the process. The
resource distributions were specified by two parameters: the radius of the
clusters of resources and the total initial number of resources. We used 100,
400, 700, and 1000 as our initial resource levels, and cluster radii of 4, 8,
16, 32, and 64.
The algorithm for generating realizations began with randomly drawing
the number of resource aggregations, or clusters, from a Poisson distribution with an expected value of 15 (Table 1). The center of each cluster was
randomly assigned to a point in the landscape (i.e., parent point). Then resources were sequentially assigned to a random parent and randomly placed
within a specified radius (i.e., cluster radius) of the parent point until all
resources were distributed among the parents. Thus, for each run of the
simulation, the algorithm randomly determined the number of clusters and
the number of resources per cluster, but the initial total resource density
and the cluster radius were fixed. By changing a single parameter (i.e.,
cluster radius), we were able to vary the degree of aggregation of resources,
which ranged from tightly clumped (cluster radius = 4) to dispersed (cluster
radius= 64).
A common misconception is that the negative binomial distribution is
the best tool for modeling clusters. A negative binomial distribution describes the probability of finding a specific number of points within a sample
area; it does not directly generate the positions of points. In fact, there is
no stationary spatial point process that generates a negative binomial distribution of points in all possible sample areas (Diggle, 2003). In contrast,
the Neyman-Scott process is a stationary spatial point process.
The boundary conditions for the landscape were selected to minimize
the impact of boundary artifacts. A buffer zone five units wide was added
to each side of the landscape. This buffer zone contained no resources. Its
purpose was to make sure that no resources were extremely close to the
landscape boundary (which would protect them from approach from one
or more sides). When a forager reached a boundary, it was relocated to

a random position in the landscape, and it resumed its search (starting
by drawing a new step length). The rationale for this type of boundary
condition is described in A.5.
2.6. Optimization
We used Netlogo (Wilensky, 1999) to simulate three classes of foraging
strategies: non-composite, GUT, and non-directional sensory. Within each
of these strategy classes, we sought to identify the movement parameters
and mode-switching threshold that maximized search efficiency. We defined
efficiency as the number of resources consumed divided by the length of
the forager’s trajectory. For the non-composite foragers, this amounted to
optimizing the movement parameter µ. For GUT foragers, we optimized
µint , µext , and the GUT. For non-directional sensory foragers, we optimized
µint , µext , and the SFT. Using an optimization algorithm (see A.2), we found
the optimal parameter combination for each class of forager on each type of
landscape, and compared the efficiencies of these optimal foragers. Then,
we examined the sensitivity of search efficiency to each of the optimized
parameters (see A.3). We also explored how a forager optimized to one
type of landscape would fare in another; we quantified this ability with a
measure called robustness (see A.4). The sensitivity and robustness analyses
11

were conducted with R (R Development Core Team, 2011).
3. Results
3.1. Optimal parameters
The optimal parameter for non-composite search generally ranged from
µ = 1.0 (ballistic motion) on landscapes with low resource aggregation to
µ = 1.8 on landscapes with high resource aggregation (Table 2). Although
optimizing the parameter for non-composite Lévy walks is a well-studied
problem, the case of destructive foraging on patchily distributed resources is
not; such situations were once assumed to be equivalent to non-destructive
foraging on uniform landscapes, but this is not true (Reynolds, 2010a).
Our non-composite results are largely in agreement with previous results
about destructive searches on landscapes generated by cellular automata
(Reynolds, 2010a).
The optimal search parameters for composite foragers showed several
interesting patterns. For all degrees of resource aggregation, the best GUT
foraging strategies involved ballistic motion in extensive mode (µext = 1)
(Table 2). The optimal intensive mode for GUT foragers depended on the
degree of resource aggregation. On landscapes with a high degree of resource
aggregation, optimal GUT foragers used Brownian motion in intensive mode
(µint = 3). The optimal GUT foragers for other landscapes used a ballistic
extensive strategy and a superdiffusive intensive strategy (µint < 3). For all
degrees of resource aggregation, the best non-directional sensory foraging
strategies involved Brownian motion in intensive mode (µint = 3). The optimal non-directional sensory foragers used an extensive mode that depended
on the landscape, although these extensive modes were always ballistic or
close to ballistic.
The optimal parameters identified in our simulations can be compared
with conventional composite search strategies, which use ballistic motion in
extensive search and Brownian motion in intensive search (Plank and James,
2008). Optimal GUT foragers for landscapes with a high degree of resource
aggregation behaved like a conventional composite searcher. The optimal
GUT foragers for other landscapes used the conventional extensive strategy but deviated from the conventional intensive strategy (µint < 3). The
optimal non-directional sensory foragers used intensive and extensive movement parameters that are consistent with conventional composite search
(although the criteria they use for mode-switching distinguishes them from
previous composite search models).

3.2. Search strategy comparisons
After identifying optimal parameters for non-composite, GUT, and nondirectional sensory foragers, we compared the search efficiencies of these
foraging strategies. The composite search strategies outperformed the noncomposite search strategy when resources were highly aggregated, and the
relative advantage of composite search increased with the degree of resource
aggregation (Fig. 2). Composite search also produced lower variability in
search efficiency than non-composite search when resources were aggregated
(Fig. 3). For all search strategies, both search efficiency (Fig. 2) and
variability in search efficiency (Fig. 3) increased with degree of resource
aggregation.
The non-directional sensory strategy performed better than the GUT
strategy across the full spectrum of resource aggregation (Fig. 2). At first
glance, this result may seem obvious; having sensory capabilities is clearly
better than not having them at all. Recall, however, that the non-directional
sensory forager is not simply an enhanced GUT forager. The GUT forager
has the ability to keep track of time since the last resource encounter, an
ability that the non-directional sensory forager lacks.
The non-directional sensory forager’s performance advantage over the
GUT forager can be attributed to two main reasons. First, the sensory
forager has more opportunities to switch search mode. The GUT forager
only switches mode upon encountering resources or when the time threshold
expires. The sensory forager examines the sensory field at every resource
encounter and at the end of every step of its random walk; this happens very
frequently when move lengths are short (i.e., when µ is close to 3.0). When
the sensory forager engages in intensive mode, it is not making a large time
commitment, because it has frequent opportunities to revert to extensive
mode. When the GUT forager engages in intensive search, it is stuck in
that mode until the time threshold elapses. Second, the GUT foragers
search strategy relies on the spatial autocorrelation of resources. When
a GUT forager encounters a resource, it enters intensive search, under the
assumption that other resources are nearby. In contrast, the sensory forager
can be triggered into intensive search by local deviations in the sensory field,
which is beneficial regardless of the spatial autocorrelation of the resources.
This effect is evident in Figure 2, where the advantage of sensory search
over GUT search increases slightly as landscapes become more dispersed.
These results regarding the relative efficiencies of different search strategies have two major biological implications. First, they indicate that non14

across resource densities. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Non-directional
sensory search (solid lines) outperforms GUT search (dashed lines) across all landscape
types. On landscapes with low aggregation (large cluster radii), the advantage of GUT
over non-composite search (dotted lines) vanishes, but the advantage of non-directional
sensory over non-composite search does not.

directional sensory strategies are generally superior to GUT strategies. From
a forager’s point of view, this means that it is better to keep track of sensory
cues than time, even if the sensory cues cannot be used for taxis. Second,
these results show that non-directional sensory foraging is a useful strategy,
even when resources are not aggregated. This means that the advantages
of composite search extend beyond environments with clumped resource
distributions.
3.3. Sensitivity
For both composite search classes, searching efficiency was most sensitive
to movement behavior in extensive mode, µext (Fig. 4). The difference in
searching efficiency between the optimal µext and the worst µext was up to
70%. In contrast, the difference in searching efficiency between the optimal
µint and the worst µint was no more than 45%.
Setting the threshold parameter (the time threshold for GUT foragers,
the sensory field threshold for non-directional sensory foragers) below the
optimal value caused greater decreases in efficiency than when these parameters were set above the optimal value. When the time threshold is set
too low, the GUT forager spends too much time in extensive mode; in the
extreme, setting the time threshold to zero leads to a reduction in efficiency
of nearly 40%. When the sensory field threshold is set too low, the nondirectional sensory forager spends too much time in intensive search; in the
extreme, setting this threshold to zero leads to a reduction in efficiency of
over 60% (Figure 4).
Biologically, this means that GUT foragers should error on the side of
too much intensive search (with too high a GUT threshold) more frequently
than on the side of too little intensive search (with too low a GUT threshold). Conversely, sensory foragers should error on the side of too little
intensive search (with too high a sensory field threshold) more frequently
than on the side of too much intensive search (with too low a sensory field
threshold).
3.4. Robustness
Our robustness analysis (explained in detail in A.4) allowed us to determine how a forager optimized for a particular level of resource aggregation
would fare in landscapes with different levels of resource aggregation. The
non-directional sensory strategy was more robust to changes in resource

Figure 4: Representative example of sensitivity analysis for the three parameters associated with giving-up time and non-directional sensory search strategies. Resource
density is 400; cluster radius is 4. Points represent proportional difference in searching efficiency for a single run relative to the mean searching efficiency for the optimal
parameter combination. µext is the extensive movement parameter, µint is the intensive
movement parameter, GUT is the giving-up time, and SFT is the sensory field threshold.
Parameter values are normalized for comparison. Lines are smoothing splines. For both
non-directional sensory and GUT search, efficiency generally declines as µext increases,
and generally increases as µint increases. See A.3 for details.

aggregation than the GUT strategy, particularly for foragers that were optimized for dispersed resources (black lines in Fig. 5). GUT foragers optimized for a high degree of resource aggregation were relatively robust to
decreasing degrees of resource aggregation (grey dashed lines in Fig. 5),
but GUT foragers optimized for landscapes with dispersed resources had
drastically reduced searching efficiency in landscapes with more aggregated
resources (black dashed lines in Fig. 5). This contrasts with the optimal
non-directional sensory foragers, which had much smaller decreases in efficiency (solid lines in Fig. 5).
Overall, the biological implications of the robustness analysis are clear:
non-directional sensory foragers fare better than GUT foragers when placed
in environments they are not optimized for. This implies that non-directional
sensory foragers will suffer a smaller reduction in efficiency than their GUT
counterparts if environments change drastically over time.
4. Discussion
Composite search strategies, which consist of extensive and intensive
search modes, help foragers focus search effort on resource rich regions
and devote less effort to resource poor regions. The central objective of
this study was to compare the efficiency of two possible criteria for switching search modes: giving-up time (GUT) and non-directional sensory cues.
Our simulations revealed that non-directional sensory foragers outperformed
GUT foragers across a full spectrum of resource distributions, ranging from
highly aggregated to highly dispersed. In addition, non-directional sensory
foragers were more robust to changes in resource distribution, implying that
they would be better able to cope with environmental change. These results
indicate that it is better to inform search behavior with a non-directional
sensory cue than with resource encounters and elapsed time. Together with
empirical evidence indicating that sensory cues are more important than recent resource encounters in determining foraging mode (Persons and Uetz,
1997), our simulations suggest that the default assumption that GUT governs composite random search should be reexamined. If a researcher in
the field observes foragers engaged in composite random search, the default
assumption should be the foragers are using the most efficient mode switching strategy, which our simulations show is based on non-directional sensory
cues. The alternative hypothesis, that foragers use GUT mediated search,
should be entertained only after the researcher rules out all possible sensory
cues.

Cluster Radius

Figure 5: Robustness of non-directional sensory (NDS) and giving-up time (GUT) search
strategies across 5 levels of resource aggregation (measured by cluster radii) and 4 levels
of resource density: (A) 100, (B) 400, (C) 700, (D) 1000. Robustness measures how well
a searcher optimized for a landscape of type X does in a landscape of type Y, relative to a
searcher optimized for type Y. A NDS searcher optimized for dispersed landscapes (black
solid lines, large cluster radii) performs sub-optimally in clumped landscapes (small cluster radii). The corresponding situation for GUT search is much more dramatic; a GUT
searcher optimized for dispersed landscapes (black dashed lines) does very poorly when
placed in clumped landscapes. See A.4 for details.

Our simulations also agree with the results in Benhamou (2007), which
showed that composite search strategies outperform non-composite searches
in patchy environments. Our simulations show how this performance advantage varies across a spectrum of levels of resource aggregation (Fig. 2).
At the lowest levels of resource aggregation, the performance advantage
vanishes for GUT composite foragers, but not for non-directional sensory
composite foragers.
To our knowledge, GUT is the only mode-switching mechanism previously used to model composite strategies in the general random search context (e.g., James et al., 2011; Plank and James, 2008; Reynolds, 2009). Our
model with mode-switching based on non-directional sensory cues is novel.
Our results agree with the system-specific model of Hill et al. (2003), who
simulated juvenile flatfish foraging for bivalves. In their study, simulated
flatfish movement was determined by sampling empirically observed movement distributions. The authors studied both a giving-up time composite
search strategy and a “local density” strategy, in which search mode was
based on the number of prey items within a fixed radius of the fish’s position. Hill et. al found that the local density strategy outperformed the
GUT strategy, which matches our finding that the non-directional sensory
strategy outperforms the GUT strategy. Our work, which represents very
general search behavior, and that of Hill et al. (2003), which focused on a
specific system, provide complementary evidence for the potential importance of composite foraging strategies that are not based on time.
In an attempt to keep our model as general as possible, we did not include several important ecological factors. First, we did not consider the
costs involved in the evolution or development of the cognitive and sensory abilities foragers would need to detect non-directional cues versus the
cost to keep track of time. Second, we did not model the process of selection and evolution; an approach similar to that implemented by Preston
et al. (2010) could be used to investigate the evolution of these strategies.
Third, we only considered non-directional sensory fields that were created
by symmetric Gaussian sources. This provides an accurate representation
of sensory fields when there are no prevailing winds, as in the Tsetse fly
system described by Williams (1994). In many systems, however, the sensory field will be altered by wind, currents, and other environmental factors
(Reynolds, 2012). In some situations, it could be expected that turbulence
would blur what otherwise might be used as gradient-following cues, resulting in non-directional sensory cues. In other cases, prevailing winds or
21

straight-line winds might create a situation in which special movement patterns would be optimal (Nevitt et al., 2008). Future work will be required to
fully describe these situations and conditions, but the symmetric Gaussian
case studied here provides a useful starting point. Fourth, our simulation
was done in two dimensions; for many species, especially marine organisms, a three-dimensional model would be more appropriate. Finally, we
did not take into account factors like interspecific competition or predation
risk (Brown and Kotler, 2004; Reynolds, 2010a). Information sharing among
foragers in a group is another complicating factor. Codling and Bode (2014)
created an individual-based model of how leaderless social groups navigate
toward a target. Future research should build upon this, and examine how
information sharing applies to the context of foraging.
Our models use Lévy walks to describe movement types that lie on a
spectrum between the extremes of Brownian and ballistic motion. Recently,
Pyke (2015) argued that traditional Lévy walk models are biologically unrealistic. He advocated the use of individual based models that can incorporate phenomena like area-restricted search, patchy resource distributions,
and forager memory and perceptual abilities. Our modeling framework
shows that these features are compatible with Lévy walks. Lévy walks provide a simple, general family of non-oriented superdiffusive random walks
(for details see, A.1); their usefulness as a descriptive modeling tool does
not rest on the validity of the Lévy foraging hypothesis (as described in
Bartumeus, 2007). An analogy can be made with Brownian motion, which
is frequently used as a descriptive model of random movement, without invoking a Brownian foraging hypothesis. With knowledge of the traits of a
particular species and its environment, a highly detailed, specific model can
be created; our models, however, aim to explore general principles about
composite foraging strategies. We believe Lévy walks offer an appropriate
trade-off between generality and realism.
The modeling framework outlined in this study has the potential to
help bridge the gap between two traditionally disparate fields of study:
random search theory and classic patch use theory. The former focuses on
animal movement patterns, the latter on patch use decisions (Bartumeus
and Catalan, 2009). Recent work (Bartumeus et al., 2013) has sought to
establish a stochastic optimal foraging theory to unify these approaches; our
model could contribute to that effort. One of the foundational results of
classic foraging theory is Charnov’s Marginal Value Theorem (MVT), which
dictates that an optimal forager should deplete patches so that the intake
22

rate in each patch is equal to the expected intake rate averaged over the rest
of the environment (Charnov, 1976). The predictions of the MVT provide
a useful benchmark to measure real-world foragers against. Unfortunately,
the MVT is not easily translated to the realm of random search theory,
where resources have arbitrary spatial distributions (hence patches are not
well-defined) and resource encounters are typically discrete events (hence
instantaneous intake rate is not well-defined).
Plank and James (2008) proposed an analogue between patch-use models
and composite random search models: within patch harvesting corresponds
to intensive search, while between-patch travel corresponds to extensive
search. They further suggested that optimal GUT composite searchers represent the random search version of MVT optimal foragers. There are important differences between the optimal behavior predicted by these two
models, though. MVT optimal foragers make decisions based on the current local and global resource levels. They are omniscient, and hence have
no need to use past experience or memory. This contrasts with GUT optimal foragers, whose behavior is highly dependent on stochastic resource
encounters. The non-directional sensory optimal foragers introduced in this
paper provide a better analogue to MVT optimal foragers. Like MVT optimal foragers, non-directional sensory optimal foragers make instantaneous
assessments of local and global resource conditions to determine when to
switch behavioral modes. Just as MVT optimal foragers provide a useful
null-model for foraging on landscapes with resource patches, non-directional
sensory optimal foragers provide a useful null-model for foraging on landscapes with resources distributed as arbitrary point patterns. Similar to
MVT foragers, the non-directional sensory optimal foragers can be used as
a benchmark, even when the mechanisms foragers use to locate resources
are unknown. The non-directional sensory forager model predicts areas that
warrant intensive search; by overlaying this with observed animal movement
trajectories, one can determine how close those animals come to optimal behavior.
In summary, our results challenge the assumption that GUT is the key
criterion composite foragers use to switch between intensive and extensive
search modes. Non-directional sensory cues and GUT are both potential
mechanisms for mediating kinesis, but our simulations show that strategies based on non-directional sensory cues are more efficient than strategies
based on GUT. This suggests that foragers should rely more heavily on
sensory cues than elapsed time for determining search mode switches.

A. Appendix
A.1. Diffusive and superdiffusive random walks
A frequently invoked reason for using Lévy walks to model animal movement is that they are“superdiffusive” (Viswanathan et al., 2008). In this
section, we clarify how this term is defined, and address the implications
for situations where walks are truncated.
Mean-square displacement (MSD) provides a useful way to classify stochastic movement. If a particle’s position is given by the stochastic process
x (t), then we define MSD = hx2 i. For Brownian motion, hx2 i ∼ t. This
linear scaling of MSD with time is referred to as normal diffusion. If
hx2 i ∼ tα , α > 1, then we say that the particle is “superdiffusive”.
For random walks with step-lengths drawn from a Pareto distribution
with µ > 3, the Central Limit Theorem guarantees that hx2 i ∼ t. Hence
these random walks are normal diffusions, and behave like Brownian motion
at sufficiently large time scales. For µ = 3, the Central Limit Theorem no
longer applies, and hx2 i ∼ ln (t) t, a marginal case between normal diffusion
and superdiffusion. This fact is mentioned in Klafter et al. (1996) and
Viswanathan et al. (2011), and a proof of the discrete space case can be
found in Zumofen and Klafter (1993). We were able to translate Zumofen
and Klafter’s approach into a continuous space context (we were unable to
find a proof of this case in the literature). For µ < 3, it is well known that
the resulting Lévy walk is superdiffusive (Viswanathan et al., 2011).
These results are valid for theoretical Lévy walks. In nature and in
simulations, there will always be an upper bound to step-lengths. These
limitations result in truncated Lévy walks, which, by the Central Limit Theorem, eventually converge to Brownian motion (Benhamou, 2007). There
are both numerical and philosophical reasons why this does not prevent
Lévy walks from serving as useful modeling tools. The numerical argument, as established in Mantegna and Stanley (1994) and reiterated in
Viswanathan et al. (2011), is that the convergence to Brownian motion is
24

very slow, and hence a truncated Lévy walk retains its superdiffusive quality
over relevant time scales. From a philosophical perspective, the theoretical
(non-truncated) Lévy walk represents a process that, together with the environment, generates an observed (or simulated) truncated Lévy walk. As
argued by Viswanathan et al. (2011), this distinction between process and
observation is extremely important.
Another important property of Lévy walks is that they are scale-free;
that is, the probability distribution of step lengths is invariant under scaling
transformations (Reynolds and Rhodes, 2009). When a forager interacts
with its environment, either by truncating step lengths or by switching its
search mode, the scale-free property is not retained (Viswanathan et al.,
2008). In other words, although scale-invariant probability distributions
drive a forager’s intrinsic movement tendencies, its trajectory depends on
its interactions with the environment, and hence is not scale-free. This is
realistic, because foraging behavior should reflect the characteristic scales
of the surrounding environment.
A.2. Parameter optimiziation
We used a grid-based search to explore the searching efficiency associated with large regions of the parameter space of our simulation model. A
non-composite forager is characterized by a single parameter µ. We ran noncomposite simulations using parameter values µ = 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, ..., 3.0 on
each landscape type (specified by initial resource distribution and resource
aggregation). For the composite foragers, we examined 4 initial resource
densities, 5 cluster radii, 2 search strategies (GUT and non-directional sensory), and 11 values for each of the 3 search parameters (µext , µint , switching
threshold). In the first sweep of the parameter space, we conducted 100 runs
for each parameter combination for a total of 5,324,000 runs (4 densities * 5
radii * 2 strategies * 113 search parameter combinations * 100 runs). Each
run of the model consisted of 20,000 discrete time steps. Even the most efficient foragers did not come close to consuming all of the available resources;
hence totally depleting the landscape before 20,000 time steps was not an
issue. The full grid-based search produced a rough fitness surface based on
the searching efficiency of each parameter combination. The fitness surface
allowed us to exclude regions of the parameter space that led to poor searching efficiency, thereby focusing our computational resources on increasing
replication in regions of the parameter space that were likely to contain the
optimal parameter combination. We used an iterative process (described
below) to narrow the regions of the parameter space selected for increased
25

replication. The iterative process did not produce a finer-scale resolution
of the parameter space but rather increased the replication for subsets of
the parameter combinations used in the full grid-based search. Within
each landscape type, we used the mean searching efficiency from the full
grid-based search to select the top 13 of the 1331 (1%) possible parameter
combinations. For each parameter, we used the range of values found within
the top 1% to reduce the parameter space. For example, suppose the top
1% parameter combinations included µext values that ranged from 1.0-1.4,
µint values from 2.6-3.0, and GUT values from 100-200. Then we would have
increased replication for the 27 parameter combinations (µext , µint , GUT)
that represented parameter values within those ranges: µext = 1.0, 1.2, 1.4;
µint = 2.6, 2.8, 3.0; GUT = 100, 150, 200. For some landscape types, this
approach did not reduce the parameter space substantially. Thus, we conducted 200 runs for each parameter combination in the reduced parameter
space and again calculated the top 1% of the parameter combinations to
further reduce the parameter space. This process was repeated until the
optimal parameter combination was comprised of at least 500 runs because
preliminary exploration of the model indicated that 500 runs produced good
estimates of mean searching efficiency.
A.3. Sensitivity
We examined the sensitivity of searching efficiency to each search parameter by varying one search parameter while holding the other two parameters at their optimal values. µext and µint ranged from 1 to 3, GUT
ranged from 0 to 500, and the sensory field threshold ranged from 0 to
0.256 (Table 1). The µ parameters have a naturally bounded range, but
the threshold parameters have arbitrary upper bounds, which were selected
based on preliminary explorations of parameter space. We normalized the
parameter values to fall between 0 and 1 to facilitate comparisons across the
different ranges of the parameters. We calculated the proportional difference in searching efficiency as DS = (y − ȳo )/ȳo , where y was the searching
efficiency for a single run and ȳo was the mean searching efficiency for the
optimal parameter combination. We fitted smoothing splines to the relationship between DS and the normalized value of each parameter for each
landscape type. The shape of the smoothing splines provided an indication
of the sensitivity of searching efficiency to changes in each parameter. In
two cases (see Table 2), the optimal µext and µint were the same, which
made the best giving-up time parameter irrelevant. Thus, those landscape
types were excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
26

A.4. Robustness
To assess the robustness of the optimal strategies to changes in resource
aggregation, we examined how a search strategy that maximized the searching efficiency for one landscape type performed in landscape types with
different degrees of resource aggregation. Specifically, we calculated robustness as DR = (ȳi,j − ȳi,i )/ȳi,i , where ȳi,j was the mean searching efficiency in
landscapes of type i for a forager that was optimized for a landscape of type
j. In this formula, landscape types are indexed by cluster radius. We examined how foragers optimized for very clumped and very disperse landscapes
(j = 4 and j = 64, respectively) performed on a full range of landscape
types (i = 4, 8, 16, 32, 64). This analysis was done on four different levels of
resource density (100, 400, 700, 1000). Then we resampled the data with
replacement (i.e., bootstrap method) 500 times for each landscape type and
calculated the mean and 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the distribution of
robustness values.
A.5. Boundary conditions
Landscape boundary conditions play an important role in individualbased models (Berec, 2002). Most simulations use one of three types of
boundary conditions: reflecting, periodic, or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries are appropriate for modeling animals that live in a restricted environment, like animals on an island (Berec, 2002), or animals with territories
bounded by scent marks (Giuggioli and Kenkre, 2014). Reflecting boundary conditions can also be interpreted as having a new forager enter the
landscape at the exact place where the previous forager left it. This biases
the initial conditions for the new forager and creates edge effects.
Periodic boundary conditions can be interpreted in three different ways.
First, the landscape is literally a torus, which is an unrealistic assumption.
Second, the landscape is infinite, but repeating; this is problematic when
resource consumption is destructive, and a forager’s actions at one point on
a landscape affect an infinite number of other points. Third, a new forager
enters the landscape at a point determined by where the original forager left
it; like with reflecting boundary conditions, this has the potential to create
edge effects. Our modeling framework presents a few additional problems
associated with periodic boundary conditions. The resource distributions
and the sensory field are generated under the assumptions that the topology
of the landscape is a plane; periodic boundary conditions would mean that
resources on opposite ends of the landscape are close to each other, leading
to logical inconsistencies.
27

Alternatively, foragers that reach the boundary of the landscape could
be reintroduced at a randomly selected point on the boundary. This poses
a problem, because a random walker placed on a boundary is highly likely
to cross the boundary within a very short time period (often immediately).
This can lead to a long repeated pattern of foragers being placed on the
boundary, crossing it almost immediately, being replaced on the boundary,
leaving again, etc. Ideally, one would like to de-emphasize the role of potential boundary artifacts, and minimize the time a forager spends near
boundaries. The boundary reintroduction method does not meet that goal.
In our model, we implemented a modified version of absorbing boundary
conditions. The major challenge with absorbing boundary conditions is that
a forager could leave the landscape by chance almost immediately after
entering it. The performance of such a forager would not provide much
information about the efficiency of the strategy it employed. Therefore, we
chose to force each forager to spend 20,000 discrete time steps foraging on
the landscape. If the forager was absorbed by a boundary, it was randomly
dropped back into the landscape to resume foraging. This can be interpreted
as a forager leaving the landscape, then returning later to resume foraging.
We chose 20,000 time steps, because this was a sufficient time for foragers to
appreciably deplete landscapes. Finally, we included a small resource-free
buffer zone at the edge of the landscape. The entire landscape (including
buffers) was a square 111 units long and 111 units wide, but only the 101
unit long, 101 unit wide square in the center contained resources. Resourcefree buffer zones occupied 5 unit thick strips at the top, bottom, left, and
right edges of the central landscape. This ensured that all resources could
be approached from every direction, and that no resources were protected
by edge effects.
