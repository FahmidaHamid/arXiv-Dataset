We develop a quantum scattering model to describe the exciton transport through the FennaMatthews-Olson(FMO) complex. It is found that the exciton transport involved the optimal quantum coherence is more efficient than that involved classical behavior alone. Furthermore, we also
find that the quantum resonance condition is easier to be fulfilled in multiple pathways than that
in one pathway. We then definitely demonstrate that the optimal distribution of the pigments, the
multitude of energy delivery pathways and the quantum effects, are combined together to contribute
to the perfect energy transport in the FMO complex.

Photosynthesis is a fundamental biological process that
harvests solar energy to power life on Earth. It starts
with the absorption of a photon of sunlight by the antenna molecules, followed by transfer of the energy to the
reaction centers. Remarkably, the energy transfer from
the antennas to the reaction center is almost perfectly
efficient[1]. Then an intriguing question arises: what
makes the energy transfer so efficient? Up to date, there
are two acceptable contributing factors[2]: The first one
is optimal space distribution of the pigments in lightharvesting complexes[3], where the optimal space is just
closely enough to enable fast energy transfer, but far
enough apart to prevent the molecular orbital of the
pigments from overlapping. The second factor is the
supramolecular organization of photosynthetic apparatus, which allows the multiple energy delivery pathways
to connect to the reaction centre[4].
Recently, the experimental and theoretical studies
show that there exists long-lived quantum coherence in
this energy transfer in several photosynthetic complexes
[5–10], which suggests that quantum coherence could be a
third factor in optimizing energy transfer efficiency. However, to what extent quantum effects contribute to the
efficiency of energy transfer is largely unknown. Therefore, it would be significant important to establish quantitatively whether or not photosynthetic light harvesting
that involves quantum coherence is truly more efficient
than it would be using classical mechanisms alone[2].
In this paper, we develop a quantum scattering model
to describe the exciton (the energy carrier) transport in
the FMO complex. We explore respectively the quantum and classical transports of the exciton in one, two
and multiple pathways and show that the quantum transport under the resonant condition can lead to perfect
efficiency. Since the resonance is due to the quantum
coherence and it is impossible in classical physics, we
thus demonstrate definitely that the exciton transport involved optimal quantum coherence is more efficient than
that for the classical case. We show that the resonant
transport with perfect efficiency occurs when the quan-

tum phase of the exciton accumulated in the pathways
are fulfilled with the resonant condition. Since the phase
of the exciton is determined by the space distribution of
the pigments, the optimal distribution of the pigments
is then indeed significant in the near-unity transfer efficiency. Although the perfect efficiency is also possible
for one pathway alone, the multiple pathways are essential because the resonant region in multiple pathways is
much larger than that in one pathway. The large resonant region is the mechanism that the excitons with a
broad range of the spectrum ( electron absorbed different colors of light) can transport with perfect efficiency.
Therefore, the three mentioned contributing factors, the
optimal distribution of the pigments, the multitude of
energy delivery pathways and the quantum effects, are
combined together in our proposed model to contribute
the perfect energy transport in FMO.

Quantum scattering model of the FMO complex. The
architecture of antenna light-harvesting complexes varies
widely among photosynthetic organisms. A well-studied

2
example is the water-soluble FMO complex of green sulfur bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1, the FMO complex
comprises three identical monomers that each contains
seven pigments. The seven pigments (Fig. 1(b)) can
be combined into two major energy transport pathways
[11]. A light pulse absorbed by the chlorosome antenna
could excite an electron into a state called an exciton
which is a quasi-particle and can be considered as the
energy carrier in light-harvesting complexes. The exciton then transports to the reaction centre through FMO
with nearly perfect efficiency.
Exciton transport is accomplished in FMO through
tunneling, where the exciton jumps from one pigment to
another. In the previous theories[9, 10, 12], each pigment
is usually modeled by a two-level molecule and then the
FMO complex are described by some coupled two-level
molecules interacting with their environmental phonons.
In this paper we proposed a different model, the scattering model[13, 14] (see a brief review in Supplementary material), to explain transmission efficiency of FMO.
There are two basic elements in the scattering model, the
scatterer and the ideal channel; they are connected with
certain orders to form a quantum network. We denote
the transfer matrix for the nth scatterer as Mn and the
transfer matrix for the ideal channel with the length l as
Ul . They can be written as

where tn =Tn2 eiϕn , rn =−iRn2 eiϕn , Tn is the transmission
probability of the nth scatterer, Rn =1-Tn is its reflection
probability, ϕn is the phase change in the transmitted
wave and k is the wave number of the exciton.
The transport of FMO can be well explored with the
help of the transfer matrices in Eq. (1) as well as the
junctions S and G to be defined below. Each pigment
can be thought of as a potential well and there exists a
potential barrier between two nearest neighbor pigments
along the pathways. The potential barrier can be well
described by the transfer matrix of the scatterer defined
in Eq.(1). The wave function of the exciton in pigment
j could be written as ψj (x)=Cj eikx +Dj e−ikx , where Cj
and Dj are the amplitudes of the wave function. The
amplitudes Cj and Dj are related to its nearest neighbor
pigment through the transfer matrix of the scatterer between the two pigments. In addition, the transfer matrix
of the pigment is the one as the ideal channel defined in
Eq.(1). Therefore, we can describe the exciton transmission through the whole FMO complex with the following
three steps: (i) the two major energy transport pathways
in each monomer is described by two different scattering
pathways LA and LB , as shown in Fig. 2(a). (ii) Each
monomer is represented by a ring with two branches LA
and LB and connected to two leads through two junctions
S. The transfer matrix of the monomer j (j=1, 2, 3) is

denoted as Fj , as show in Fig. 2(b). (iii) The transport
of the whole FMO can be described in Fig. 2(c), where
three monomers represented by Fj are connected to the
antennas and reaction center through two junctions G.
The exciton created at the antennas injects into FMO
with I = 1 through the G junction connected with the
antennas. For simplicity, we assume that there is no reflection from the reaction center (the amplitude O in Fig.
2(c) vanishes); In this case, the transmission coefficient
of the whole FMO complex is then determined by the
probability |O′2 | indicated in Fig. 2(c).
Transfer matrices of the FMO complex. We now turn
to study the transfer matrices of the basic elements LA ,
LB , Fj and the whole FMO complex. The pathway LA is
represented by two scatterers connected one ideal channel
and its transfer matrix is then given by
L A = M2 Ul M1 ,

where l is the length of the 2nd pigment. The pathway
LB is composed of three branches connected by two S

From Eqs. (1-4), the amplitudes CαL ,DαL (α=A, B) of
the wave function on the left of the pathway and the

Therefore, instead of an array of the scatterers, each

We now study the exciton transport in one monomer of
the trimer. The schematic representation of the monomer
is shown in Fig. 2(b). Two pathways LA and LB form
a ring and connected to two leads through two S junctions. With the help of the effective transfer matrix for
the pathway α of the monomer j, we can obtain

where G is a 4 × 4 unitary matrix given by Eq. (20) in
Supplementary material. By solving Eq.(9) with I=1

and O=0, one can obtain the transmission coefficient
TF MO =|O′2 | of the FMO complex.
To understand the features of the transmission, we
compare the transmission coefficients for different number of pathways. For simplicity, we assume that all scatterers have the same transmission probability Tn =T and
the phase change in transmitted wave ϕn =0. Furthermore, we compare the transmission difference between
the classical and quantum cases. As for the classical
transmission, it means that the exciton is a classical particle without wave-like phase and thus the particle probability is determined by the addition of the probability
from different pathways and not the amplitudes of the
wave function; In addition, the scatterer is determined
uniquely by the transmission probability T .
Transmission of the pathways LA and LB . Based on
Eqs. (1,2,5), we can obtain the total transmission probR 2

(10)

where φA =kl. It is notable that the resonant tunneling
TA =1 appears under the condition φA =(n + 1/2)π with
n being an integer. However, as for the classical case,
after considering the multi-reflection between the scatterers M1 and M2 , we may obtain the total transmission
T
probability TAC = 2−T
.
Figure 3(a) shows the total transmission probability as
a function of the path phase for both quantum and classical case at strong scattering limit T =0.01. For classical
case, TAC =5×10−3, it is impossible for the particle to pass
through the system at strong scattering limit. However,
for quantum case, there exist two resonant peaks at which
the total transmission probability takes its maximal value
TA =1. Therefore, the transport involved optimal quantum coherence is more efficient than that involved the
classical behaviors alone.

happen and the exciton can pass through the barriers

Figure 3(b) shows the total transmission probability

classical case, TC <0.029, the particle passes through the
monomer with very small probability. However, for quantum case, there are eight resonant regions where the particle can pass through the monomer with perfect efficiency. Compared with single pathway, the resonant regions for two pathways become larger and then it is much
easier for the exciton absorbed different colors of light to
pass through the monomer.

. Figure 3(c) shows the quantum
transmission √of the √whole FMO complex for fixing
φ3 = 21 arcsin( 0.12T - R) and T =0.01. Compared with
the transmission of double pathways shown in Fig. 3(b),
the resonant region of the whole FMO becomes larger.
However, the transmission TFCMO <0.083 for classical
case, which is pretty small.
Before ending, we make several remarks on the main
results that can be obtained from the scattering model:
(i) The mechanism underlying the perfect energy efficiency is the resonant transmission induced by the quantum coherent effects, which is impossible for the classical mechanism. (ii) Multi-pathway plays significant role
in achieving remarkable efficiency of the energy transfer. To understand this point, we plot in Fig. 3(d) the
transmission coefficients for one, two, and multiple pathways. The resonant regions for FMO with multiple pathways almost occupy all parameter space which ensures
that the exciton can pass through FMO with perfect efficiency. The large resonant region means that the exciton
absorbed different colors of light can still pass through
FMO with high efficiency. (iii) The resonant conditions
are determined by the space distribution of the pigments.
When the pigments are optimally spaced such that the
quantum resonant tunneling will happen, the exciton can
pass through FMO with perfect efficiency. Therefore,
our results prove the conjecture that quantum coherence
might ’wire’ together the final energy acceptors in antennas, thus compensating for the relatively weak coupling between the pigments in FMO [2, 8]. In addition,
FMO with multiple pathways has fault-tolerant function.
When one pathway or one subunit is blocked, the exciton
can still pass through other pathways.
In summary, we have proposed a scattering model to
compare the quantum and classical energy transfer in
FMO. We found that, the aforementioned three factors,
the optimal space distribution of the pigments, multiple
pathways, and quantum effects are combined together to
ensure high efficiency of the energy transfer in FMO.
