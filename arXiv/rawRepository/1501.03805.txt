Abstract
In this paper, we seek to model the deformation of nucleated cells by
single diode-laser bar optical stretchers. We employ a recently developed
computational model, the Dynamic Ray-Tracing method, to determine
the stress distribution induced by the applied optical forces on a capsule
encapsulating a nucleus of different optical properties. These forces are
shape dependent and can deform real non-rigid objects; thus resulting in
a dynamically changing optical stress distribution with cell and nucleus
deformation. Chinese hamster ovary cell is a common biological cell that
is of interest to the biomedical community because of their use in recombinant protein therapeutics and is an example of a nucleated cell. To this
end, we model chinese hamster ovary cells as two three-dimensional elastic
capsules of variable inner capsule size immersed in a fluid where the hydrodynamic forces are calculated using the Immersed Boundary Method.
Our results show that the presence of a nucleus has a major effect on the
force distribution on the cell surface and the net deformation. Scattering
and gradient forces are reported for different nucleus sizes and the effect
of nucleus size on the cell deformation is discussed.

Introduction

The ability to trap particles using laser light was discovered by Arthur Ashkin
in 1970 [1]. In this, gradient forces are created at the surface of transparent
particles suspended in a medium of different refractive index and situated within
a light gradient. In the ray-optics regime, where the particles size is much larger
than the light wavelength [2], refraction of light rays of different intensities at
the surface and within the particles results in a change in the total momentum
between the entering and exiting light beam. These gradient forces on the order
of picoNewtons are capable of drawing microscopic particles into a region of
highest light intensity [3]. Scattering forces are also created that accelerate the
particle in the direction of beam propagation towards its focus [4]. With these
opposing mechanisms, an equilibrium position is reached and the particle is held
fixed (trapped) in the center of the beam focus as the light rays passing through
and exiting the particle exert forces that are balanced with no net change in
momentum.
Optical traps or tweezers used to manipulate microscopic objects without
any mechanical contact have become a major tool in biological research over
the last thirty years. Cells have been stretched [5], folded [6] and even rotated
[6, 7] using single and multiple optical tweezers. Recently, the technique has been
extended to study the properties of cells by observing their deformation [8, 9, 10].
Guck et al. developed an optical stretcher that uses two counterpropagating
diverging laser beams to trap cells individually along the aligned laser beams
axis [5]. This optical stretcher has also been used to deform cells and to measure
their membrane properties using a simple numerical model [9]. Extending this,
Sraj et al. developed a high-throughput optical stretcher using a single linear
diode bar to trap and stretch bovine red blood cells (RBC) [10].
Theoretical and numerical studies have also been conducted to determine
the induced optical force distribution. Using analytical solutions of the governing optical equations, Ashkin was the first to perform calculation of the total
forces of a single-beam gradient laser on solid spheres in the ray-optics (RO)
regime [11]. Guck et al. determined the local optical force distribution by the
dual optical stretcher on spherical cells using the RO technique before cells begin to deform [5] to determine the stiffness of RBCs [9]. In their method, the
effect of subsequent deformation on the calculation of force distribution was
neglected and constant rigid spherical cell morphology was assumed due to limitations in the method. Deformability of biological cells can result in a shape
change under the influence of external flows or applied forces and thus the local
force distribution and total trapping forces can change significantly with cell
deformation [12]. To take this into account, the RO method has been improved
to include different cell shapes such as oblate spheroids [13] and even cylinders
[14]. As an analytical method, RO remains a difficult approach for calculating
the forces on more complex cell shapes like the RBC bi-concave discoid shape
and deformable cells.
To overcome these issues, we recently developed and implemented a dynamic
ray-tracing (DRT) approach [12] that, in addition to finding transient optical
2

forces on deformable cells, solves for fluid-cell interactions [15, 16]. DRT offers
the possibility of simulating different phenomena occurring in optical systems
such as erythrocyte deformation in high-throughput optical stretchers [17] and
optical levitation [18]. The approach allows one to assess cell deformability and
to investigate the optical parameters to better design traps and manipulate cells
prior to performing experiments. In addition, due the vector-based nature, DRT
allows the calculations of both anisotropic and inhomogeneous structures, cases
that exist in real systems.
CHO cells are the most commonly used mammalian host for industrial production of recombinant protein therapeutics [19] and have been used in related
genetics studies [20]. Because of their importance, a number of previous studies
have investigated the optical forces on CHO cells. For example, Wei et al. used
a fiber-optic dual-beam trap to capture chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and
determine the associated three-dimensional optical force field [21]. Chang et
al. developed a model based on RO to calculate the optical force upon a solid
spherically-symmetric multilayer sphere [22]. This study showed that the magnitude of optical forces are three times smaller than that upon a polystyrene
bead of the same size and that the distribution of optical forces is much different from that upon a uniform particle. Recently, Kim et al. computed the
optical force on a pair of concentric spheres in a focused beam and determined
the influence of refractive index differences and relative size between the inner
and outer spheres on the optical force [23].
All of these studies however did not take into account the deformability of
both the cell and its encapsulated nucleus. We show here how the presence of a
nucleus inside deformable cells leads to alteration in the propagation of light rays
due to the additional internal surface and the additional medium of different
refractive index [24]. Here, the variation in the nucleus size may significantly
influence the optical forces and ultimately the net deformation of both the cell
and the nucleus itself.

Numerical method

Simulating deformation of a cell via optical stretchers requires a two-step method
to first determine optical stresses induced by the interaction of light with the
cell surface and then model the cell-fluid interactions. Because the distribution
of optical stresses is dependant on the shape of the cell that in turn changes
during deformation, these two steps are done alternately until a steady state
shape is reached. In the case of nucleated cells, optical stress calculation is
additionally challenging due to the different external and internal morphologies
in addition to membrane deformability. For this purpose, we resort to DRT to
determine the optical stresses induced on the surfaces of deformable nucleated
cells by optical stretchers [10, 17]. DRT, unlike the traditional RO method, is
vector-based and is capable of determining the optical forces on cells of arbitrary
shape and morphology. Cell-fluid interaction and the hydrodynamics, on the
other hand, are solved using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). In this

3

section we briefly describe the two methods.

2.1

Dynamic Ray Tracing

DRT is a vector-based method developed by Sraj et al. [12, 17] to determine
optical forces on the surface of any arbitrary shaped cell including deformable
cells with asymmetrical geometries [18]. Briefly, DRT considers a finite number
of rays issued from a light source with given intensities and known direction.
These rays are treated as vectors and traced as they intersect a surface. A
ray-triangle intersection algorithm is then employed to determine the location
of intersection where the surface is divided into triangular elements for this
purpose. Geometrical optics laws are then applied to find the refraction and
reflection angle. Consequently the vectors of the rays are updated and the
procedure is repeated till each ray exits the cell. From the direction of the light
rays within the cell one can calculate the trapping efficiency Q, a dimensionless
factor representing the amount of momentum transferred [5, 12]. The trapping
efficiency Q is independent of the laser power used and depends only on the
object geometry and reflectance of the medium. Elemental optical forces at any
location of the cell are therefore found regardless of the initial cell shape. Rays
are traced at any surface where Q is multiplied by a factor to account for energy
loss from previous refractions. Internal and external reflections within the cell
are neglected as their effects rapidly diminish. Optical forces can be expressed
as
nm QP
,
(1)
c
where nm is the index of refraction of the buffer medium, c the speed of light in
vacuum, and P the laser power. It is important to note that the resulting optical
forces are added to the Navier-Stokes equations as body forces as described
below.
This method has been validated and applied to cells of different initial shapes
[12] and different optical applications [17, 18]. Here, DRT is used to model
nucleated cells by considering two concentric spheres of different sizes, one representing the cell surface and another representing the nucleus. DRT is then
employed to determine optical stresses induced on both surfaces.

Immersed Boundary Method

The IBM is a cell-fluid interaction solver that has been used extensively to simulate biological systems such as cell adhesion [25], cell adhesion in atomic force
microscopy measurements [26] and red blood cell motion through microvascular
bifurcation [27]. IBM splits the numerical solution onto two grids: a stationary
grid that has a fixed position with time representing the three-dimensional fluid
domain and a moving grid representing the two-dimensional immersed boundary.

4

To this end, a cell is modeled as an elastic membrane that is deformable
by any applied stress. The membrane is discretized into a finite number of flat
triangular elements that remain flat after deformation. This approximation is
valid given that the local radius of curvature during deformation is much larger
than the membrane thickness and that bending stresses are negligible. Elastic forces at the discrete membrane nodes are found from their displacement
(deformation) using a finite element model. We adopt an approach developed
by Charrier et al. [28] and Shrivastava and Tang [29] that uses the principle
of virtual work to find those forces from an appropriate strain energy density
function. These forces and any external applied forces such as the optical forces
are then distributed onto the fluid grid using an appropriate discrete delta function and added to the Navier-Stokes equations as body forces. The discrete
delta function ensures that only membrane nodes in the sphere of influence of
the fluid grid make a contribution to the local body forces. The Navier-Stokes
equations are then solved for the fluid velocity.
The no-slip boundary condition at the membrane surface is satisfied by allowing the membrane nodes to move with the local fluid velocity. The velocity
of the membrane is found by summing of the velocities at the fluid grid nodes
weighted by the same discrete delta function used for the distribution of body
forces. This again ensures that only fluid grid nodes in the sphere of influence
of the membrane node make a contribution to its velocity. Membrane nodes
are then moved with the calculated velocity for one time step to a new position
giving a new membrane shape. The procedure is repeated and elastic forces
and optical forces are then calculated as described above to advance the flow
for another time step.

Model parameters

The CHO cell is a typical example of a nucleated cell. The size of such cells vary
with radius rcell ranging from 5 − 7.5 µm [30] and nucleus radius rnuc varying
following the relationship [31]:
rcell = (1.38 ± 0.02)rnuc + (0.03 ± 0.05).

(2)

The refractive index of the cytoplasm has been measured and reported as ncyt =
1.37 while that of the nucleus has been found to be slightly greater nnuc =
1.392 [31]. As the size of the cell has an effect on the forces induced by optical
stretchers (more surface area intuitively results in large forces) and hence on the
cell deformation, we seek to investigate the impact of the presence of the nucleus
and its size on the optical stress distribution and resulting cellular deformation.
For this purpose, we model CHO cells as two three-dimensional (3D) concentric
elastic spherical capsules. The radius of the outer capsule is fixed and taken as
the CHO cell average radius rcell = 5.6 µm; however, the radius of the inner
capsule representing the nucleus is varied from rnuc = 1.1 − 5 µm. The ratio of
. We
the radius of the cell to the radius of the nucleus is denoted by r = rrnuc
cell
note that a typical CHO cell has radii ratio of r = 0.72 from Equation 2.

Figure 1: CHO cell model: nm < ncell < ncyt in a linear diode stretcher.
In our calculations, cells are assumed initially trapped and situated at the
center of a laser beam created with a single linear diode bar of wavelength
λ = 808 nm and power P = 12.5 mW/µm. The length of the diode lies in
the y-axis and the laser beam direction is along the z-axis as shown in Fig. 1.
The cell is assumed to be immersed in an aqueous medium of refractive index
nm = 1.335 that is lower than the refractive index of both the cell and its
nucleus (nm < ncyt < nnuc ) (Fig. 1).
The hydrodynamics and cell mechanics are calculated using the IBM. Both
fluids inside and outside the cell are assumed incompressible and Newtonian
with identical density ρ = 1 g/cm3 and viscosity µ = 0.8 cP . The cell membrane is assumed of Neo-Hookean material, as appropriate for most biological
cells, and can be characterized using solely its stiffness Eh. Unless otherwise
noted, membrane stiffness is taken as Eh = 0.1 dyn/cm. For the purpose of
quantifying cell deformation from optical or hydrodynamic forces, we use the
Taylor deformation parameter defined as: DF = (L − B)/(L + B), where L and
B are the major and minor semi-axis of a capsule in the x − z plane. When viscous stresses, elastic forces and optical forces are balanced, cells adopt a steady
state shape denoted by DF∞ . The uniform grid used for the fluid solver has
643 nodes with a grid spacing of rcell /8 while the finite element cell grid has
20482 triangular elements. A time step of 10−5 s was used in all computations
to ensure numerical stability.

Results and discussions
Impact of nucleus size on optical forces

As a first step, we investigate the effect of nucleus size on the optical forces
initially induced at the cell surface. For reference, we employ DRT to determine
the forces induced on a cell with no nucleus. In this case, light rays emerging from the diode laser bar hit the front surface of the cell to create optical
scattering forces along the laser beam axis whose direction is opposite to their
propagation direction i.e. the negative z−axis direction as shown in Fig. 1.
6

This is due to the momentum gained by the cell when the rays transit from a
medium of lower refractive index to a medium of higher refractive index (the
cell cytoplasm ncyt = 1.37) [5]. Gradient optical forces are also created with
a sum equal to zero as the center of the cell is aligned with the center of the
laser beam. After refraction, the rays continue to hit the back surface of the
cell where they refract again and transfer momentum inducing scattering forces
in the positive direction. The magnitude of the net scattering force at the back
surface of the cell is, however, greater than the net scattering force at the front
surface resulting in a net total scattering force in the positive z − axis direction.
With our chosen laser, cell, and fluid properties, the magnitude of scattering
force applied on the front surface is 23.1 pN while on the back surface is 26.7 pN
with a net scattering force of 3.6 pN . The scattering forces would both stretch
and translate the cell away from the light source. The net gradient forces are
again equal to zero on both the front and back surface of the cell; however, if
we consider the net gradient force in the perpendicular direction to the laser
beam on one half of the cell we find it equal to 20.7 pN . The gradient forces
contribute to the stretching of the cell as well but have no translation effect.
In cells with a nucleus, light rays can hit up to four surfaces as shown in
Fig. 1 before exiting the cell from the back surface. This leads to scattering and
gradient optical forces at both the outer cell and the nucleus surface. At the
front cell surface, scattering forces remain unchanged and independent of the
nucleus size as the rays first enter the cell as already described. As the refractive
index of the nucleus is higher than that of the cytoplasm, scattering forces at
the front surface are also in the negative direction while the same forces at the
back surface are in the positive direction. However, the magnitude of the net
scattering force on the nucleus is less than the net scattering force on the cell
due to the smaller refractive index contrast between the nucleus and the cell
= 1.392
compared with the cell and suspending medium ( nnnuc
1.37 = 1.016 versus
cyt
ncyt
1.37
nm = 1.335 = 1.030 ). The magnitude of these forces depends on the nucleus
size. For instance, a nucleus of radius rnuc = 4 µm experiences a scattering
force of 4.54 pN on the front surface of the nucleus and a force of 5.24 pN on
the back surface with a net scattering force on the nucleus of 0.7 pN . When the
nucleus size is increased to rnuc = 5 µm, the net force on the nucleus increases
to 8.75 pN and 10.4 pN on the front and back surface respectively with a total
net force of 1.6 pN . This increase in force has a significant effect on the nucleus
deformation and the forces induced on the cell itself as discussed in the following
section.
As the rays reach the cell back surface, the forces induced are influenced by
the previous two refractions at the nucleus. As the nucleus size increases, optical
forces on the nucleus increase, rays gain more energy, and we see subsequent
increase in the magnitude of optical forces at the back cell surface. For a nucleus
of radius rnuc = 4 µm the net force at the back of the cell is 27.1 pN and 27.4 pN
for rnuc = 5 µm. The maximum increase in the net optical forces on the cell
is thus 20.4% compared with the nucleus-free case. Finally, for rnuc = 5 µm
the gradient forces calculated on the cell slightly decreased to 20.2 pN due to

the presence of the nucleus while the gradient forces calculated on the nucleus
increased to 8.6 pN .
The variation of the net scattering and gradient forces on the cell and its
nucleus is shown in Fig. 2 where we clearly see the effect of the size of the nucleus
on the total net force induced on the cell surface. As the nucleus size increases,
the cell will be exposed to larger forces for the same laser power. The nucleus
acts as a lens that focuses the light rays and leads to higher optical forces at the
nucleus and cell back surfaces. We finally note that we can determine the net
scattering and gradient forces on a CHO cell of nominal size from the curves in
Fig. 2 using a vertical line (shown in magenta) that corresponds to the nominal
CHO cell radius ratio of r = 0.72.

4.2

Influence of nucleus size on net cell deformation

From our calculations, it is clear that the presence of a nucleus has a significant
impact on the initial optical force distribution as these forces deform and stretch
CHO cells. Changes in cell shape lead to a new force distribution. To calculate
these, optical forces are added as body forces to the surrounding fluid. DRT
is then employed to update the optical force distribution as the cell shape is
changing until steady state when the elastic and applied optical forces are equal.
The net deformation of both the cell and the nucleus is quantified using the
Taylor parameter deformation DF shown in Fig. 3. The figure indicates that in
the case of small nuclei, DF of the cell increases to a steady value that is higher
than the reference case of no-nucleus (shown on all panels for comparison). This
is due to the slight decrease in gradient forces that lead to more deformation in
the z-direction and thus higher net deformation. DF of the nucleus, however,
is negligible due to the small magnitudes of the optical forces created.
For larger nuclei, DF shows similar trends where the cell deforms until a
steady state shape is reached but with net deformation lower than the nucleus-

net deformation of the nucleus increases with r.
To summarize the results discussed above, we show in Fig. 4 the steady
state net deformation DF∞ of both the cell and the nucleus. Here, we clearly
see that DF∞ of the cell is initially larger than the DF∞ of the nucleus-free
case but then decreases as the radius ratio increases. At the same time, DF∞ of
the nucleus increases with the radius ratio. The two curves eventually intersect
when the radius of the nucleus becomes comparable to the radius of the cell. We
also note here that we can determine the steady state net deformation DF∞ of
a CHO cell of nominal size from the curves in Fig. 4 using a vertical line (shown
in magenta) that corresponds to the nominal CHO cell radius ratio of r = 0.72.

DF calculations for CHO cells show a clear relationship between the size of
the nucleus and the steady state net cell and nuclues deformation. As the size of
the nucleus increases, the steady state deformation increases due to the increase
in the scattering forces applied at the cell surface. It is therefore expected
that the corresponding deformation increases as well. Fig. 4 shows also that
as the size of the nucleus increases, the steady state deformation of the cell
decreases. Moreover, as the size of the nucleus approaches the size of the cell, the
relative deformation of the nucleus, as characterized by the Taylor deformation
parameter surpasses that of the cell. The relationship between the size of the
nucleus and the deformation of the cell means that cells with larger nuclei show
less deformation when optically stretched than cells with smaller nuclei. Another
observation is that the cell with no nucleus deformed to a steady state of DF
value that is smaller than the value for the smallest radius ratio but larger than
the value for the largest radius ratio.

Conclusions

Chinese hamster ovary cell is of interest to the biomedical community because
of their use in recombinant protein therapeutics. Unfortunately, no experiments
have been performed to stretch this line of cells in optical traps. Few experiments, however, were performed to describe deformation of cell nucleus. In
these experiments researchers have studied the interaction of cells with topographically patterned material surfaces to show the changes in shape, function,
and viability of the cells. Only few of these studies, however, indicated possible
impact on the behavior of organelles. For instance, Dalby et al. [32] quantified
cell and nuclear morphology with light and fluorescence microscopy and showed
a slight elongation of the nuclei in grooves. Yamauchi et al. also observed
the deformation of cancerous cells/nucleus and their migration in capillaries of
mince [33]. This study aimed to find the minimum diameter of capillaries where
cancer cells are able to migrate. They measured the diameter of both the cell
and its nucleus for this purpose.
In our work, we modeled the deformation of Chinese hamster ovary cells
by single diode-laser bar optical stretchers. For this purpose, we extended the
recently developed Dynamic Ray-Tracing method to determine the stress distribution induced by the applied optical forces on cells that have a nucleus. Our
results showed that the presence of a nucleus has a major effect on the force
distribution on the cell surface and the net deformation. We also showed and
quantified the effect of nucleus size on the net applied force as well as on cell
deformation. We are working effectively on setting up experiments to stretch
CHO cells and compare our numerical data with experimental results.
