Chapter 9 TISSUE ENGINEERING

9.1

Introduction

Tissue Engineering (TE) is an interdisciplinary field dealing with the principles of engineering
and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or
improve tissue function or a whole organ [52]. Currently, TE is emerging as an invaluable
field of study and is one of the most promising fields for the next century. The ultimate goal
is to develop powerful new therapies for biological substitutes that will successfully restore
the structural and functional disorders of human and animal system.
Available standard treatments for organ or tissue loss include transplantations of the
same organ or organs from healthy donors, surgically reconstructed with synthetic implants in most of the cases, and the use of mechanical devices such as kidney dialysers,
ventricular assist device (VAD) etc [14]. Of course,
these treatments can save lives and decrease morbidity. However, each has its significant drawbacks and
most are associated with substantially decreased quality of patients life. Although these procedures (treatments) temporarily save countless lives, unfortunately
these techniques are not perfect.
Tissue engineering procedures offer a new hope
in modern medical science. By using patients own
cells to produce bioengineered tissues and organs that
function like their natural counterparts, TE may offer
a better solution for the repair and reconstruction of
damaged tissue and organs. At present, the only successfully engineered tissue that has been made available to people is skin. Major success in this direction
came in 1984 when Robert Langer, a chemical engineer at MIT and Joseph Vacanti, a medical surgeon
at Harvard, first time jointly came up with an idea of
duplication of bodys production tissues by developing
a biodegradable scaffold on which skin cells could be
grown using fibroblasts. After rigorous and extensive

in a compact dense form under specific physical conditions that is exactly similar to the inner layer of the
skin. Seeding keratinocytes on this layer leads to the formation of upper layer of the skin.

This is how the artificial skin was developed by TE methods. The important point of this artificial skin is that it has no immunogenic cells, therefore question of rejection does not arise
when implemented on patients body. Artificial skin are now made available commercially
in large quantities. The next major step towards the development of artificial organ using
tissue engineering approach is the cartilage. It is believed that the cartilage has relatively
simple composition and structure.

Cartilage Tissue Engineering
Introduction

Articular cartilage is a living tissue but of very
limited capacity to repair itself. In fact, any damage to the articulating surface (due to injury, disease, and/or genetic disorders) tends to spread
allowing the bones to rub directly against each
other and resulting in increasing joint pain and
loss of joint movement. It can also lead to osteoarthritis (a slow degeneration of articular cartilage) (see Fig. 9.2). It is the most common form
of arthritis in Australia, about 10% of the total
population [61]. In United States alone, more
than one million people annually suffer from os- Fig. 9.2: A damaged knee (Source: [66]).
teoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease caused
by damage to articular cartilage [34]. Damage to the articulating surface can occur due to
compression of heavy load or when angular and/or shear forces are applied on it. With the
prevalence of cartilage-related disease (e.g., Osteoarthritis), injuries and cost of treatment
on the rise, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) urges new treatment
options [34]. An overview of a healthy and damaged knee is given in Fig. 9.2.
The ability of cartilage to withstand enormous compressive loads (many times the body
weight) without being crushed, is attributable to the multi-phasic nature of the tissue. Mature articular cartilage contains approximately 5% of its volume as cells (also known as the
growth cells or chondrocytes), and 95% as extracellular matrix (ECM). From an engineering
standpoint, ECM is a porous, viscoelastic material consisting of three principal phases (a
phase represents all of the chemical compositions with similar physical properties): 1) the
solid phase constitutes about 30% of the total weight, and contains collagen (60%), proteoglycans or PG (25%) and wide range of matrix proteins (15%), 2) the fluid phase (also known
as the synovial fluid), which constitutes on average about 70% of the total weight, for normal
tissues, and 3) an ion phase, consisting of many ionic species of dissolved electrolytes (e.g.,
Na+ , Ca++ , Cl− ). These constitute less than 1% of the net weight. The biofluid mechanics
of cartilage growth and degradation relies on this multi-phasic nature of the tissue.
9.2.2

Collagen

2

The collagen fibrils are densely packed polymer
strands with a high resistance against fluid flow.
They are the dominant structural components
of the solid matrix and helps in retaining the
shape of the cartilage when compressed. Collagens are basically made off three polypeptide
chains arranged as triple helix long its length.
There are two different types of collagens, known
as fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens. Depending upon structural and functional characteristics collagen has been classified as 12 different
categories. Hyaline cartilage (articular cartilage) Fig. 9.3: Distribution of proteoglycan
mainly consists of type-II and type-XI fibrillar & collagen in articular cartilage (Source:
collagens where the percentage of type-II colla- [79]).
gen is much higher.
The architecture of articular cartilages connective tissues is very complicated. Collagen
fibrils in the superficial-most region (known as the tangential zone) of the cartilage layer are
densely packed and oriented parallel to the articular surface. This collagenous membrane
has a relatively low PG content and a lower permeability to fluid flow, which is important in
providing for a barrier of high resistance against fluid flow when cartilage is compressed. In
the middle or transitional zone of the cartilage, the collagen fibers are larger and are either
randomly or radially orientated. In the deepest zones, i.e., the zone nearest to the calcified
cartilage and sub-chondral bone interface the collagen fibers are larger and form bundles
that are oriented perpendicular to the calcified/bony interface. The way how the collagen
and proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycans (GAG) molecules are arranged inside the articular
cartilage, is shown in Fig. 9.3.
9.2.3

Proteoglycan

PG are macromolecules consisting of a protein core to
which are attached short chains of negatively charged
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The primary GAGs associated with PGs in cartilage are chondroitin 4sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate and keratan sulfate (Fig.
9.4). It is available in all connective tissues but its
structure varies with the type of tissue. Hyaline cartilage contains mainly aggregating proteoglycans.
Each PG-associated negative charge on the polymer chain (known as the fixed charge, FC), requires
a mobile counter-ion (e.g., Na+ ) dissolved within the
interstitial fluid in the cartilage gel to maintain its
electro-neutrality. This effect gives rise to an imbal- Fig 9.4: A GAG molecule attached
ance of mobile ions across the gel interface. The ex- to the core protein in proteoglycan
cess of mobile ions colligatively yields a swelling pressure, known as the osmotic pressure, while the swelling pressure associated with FCs is
3

known as the Donnan pressure. Changes in this internal swelling pressure, arising from
altered ion concentrations of the external bath, or changes in the fixed charges result in
changes in tissue dimensions and hydration. However, this swelling pressure is balanced by
tensile forces generated in the collagen network. This effect is due to the presence of covalent
cross-links within the polymer matrix. An increase in cartilage tissue hydration, governed
by the density and the nature of FCs on the PGs as well as the density of the mobile counter
ions in the interstitial fluid are the earliest signs of articular cartilage degeneration during
osteoarthritis.
9.2.4

Chondrocyte

Chondrocytes are mature cells found in cartilage.
They make up the cellular matrix of cartilage, performing a number of functions within the tissue, including production and maintenance of the cartilaginous matrix and facilitating the exchange of fluids
through the gelatinous layers. Fully mature chondrocytes tend to be round, and they may cluster together
in small groups within the network of the cartilage
(Fig. 9.5).
The progenitors of these cells arise in the bone
marrow, in a form of stem cell. Stem cells are capable of differentiating into several different types of cell,
depending on the need. When they differentiate into
cartilage cells, they start out as chondroblasts, actively producing secretions of chondrin, the primary
substance in cartilage, to build and repair the tissue.
Once a chondroblast becomes totally surrounded, it
is a mature chondrocyte. These cells can be found in Fig. 9.5: Light micrograph of hyasmall gaps within the cartilage known as lacunae.

the cartilage matrix, and as discussed above, the facilitate the exchange of materials between the cartilage and the surrounding material. Depending on what type of cartilage a cell is in, it may have a slightly different composition;
elastic, hyaline, and fibrocartilage are all unique, designed to meet various needs within the
body.

9.3

Mathematical model of the ECM

Mathematical models are essential for understanding systems (like cartilage) with many interacting components (e.g. the collagen network, proteoglycans, interstitial fluid and ionic
solutions present in cartilage), since the complexity of the interactions taking place overwhelms the ability of the human intuition to make accurate predictions of their behavior.
Comparisons of the models’ quantitative predictions with experimental results allows us
4

either to confirm that the biological hypotheses regarding these interactions (which are encoded in the model) are correct or, equally usefully, identify that some of them are in error.
Once thus validated, the model will ultimately help design treatments related to cartilage
loss and osteoarthritis by predicting this outcome of proposed interventions, and focusing
efforts on those which appear most promising.
In this chapter, an account of the equilibrium for electro-chemical properties of poly(ethylene
gylcol) gel (PEG) containing negatively charged chondrotin sulfate (ChS) strands, immersed
in water with several different ions: H+ , Na+ , Cl− is demonstrated. This material closely
mimics the electro-chemical properties of articular cartilage. We view this mixture as a
multi-component material, including solvent particles, polymer and particles of several ionic
species. The polymer is assumed to be made up of two types of monomers the uncharged
units (PEG segment of the polymer) and those that are the charged ones (ChS segment of
the polymer). Only the charged units participate in the binding reactions, carry a double
negative charge and are denoted as M2− . The positively charged ions in the solvent are
Hydrogen (H+ ) and Sodium (Na+ ). The negatively charged ions could include Hydronium
(OH− ) and Chloride (Cl− ). Because the negatively charged ions are assumed to be not involved in any binding reactions with the gel, acting only as counterions to positive charges,
we identify these ions by the name Chloride. The binding reactions of the positively charged
ions with the monomers are:

We assume that all the binding sites/charge sites are identical and the binding affinities for
the different ions are different. The species M2− , MH− , MNa− , MH2 , MNa2 and MHNa are
different monomer species of the charged type, all of which move with the same polymer
velocity. The ion species are freely diffusible, but because they are ions, their movement is
restricted by the requirement to maintain electroneutrality.
Suppose we have some volume V of a mixture comprised of k types of particles each
with particle density (number of particles per unit volume) nj , and particle volumes νj ,
j = 1, · · · , k. From now on we will denote the quantities with subscript “1” related to PEG
monomer species, subscript “2” related to ChS monomer species and subscript “3” related
to solvent molecule. The subscript (p,s) denotes polymer and solvent phase, respectively.
The volume fraction for each of the polymer species (θ1 , θ2 ) and the solvent (θ3 = θs ) are
θi = νi ni (i = 1, 2, 3) respectively and θp = θ1 + θ2 . Suppose the ChS monomers constitute a
fraction ‘α’ of the total number of monomers, np , (i.e., n2 = αnp , n1 = (1 − α)np ). Assuming
that the ionic species do not contribute significantly to the volume (i.e., we take νj = 0,
j = 4, · · · , k), conservation of total volume implies θ1 + θ2 + θ3 = 1. Further, in subsequent
calculations we make an assumption that the particle density of the ions
P is insignificantly

Chemical potential

This section outlines the calculation of the free energy and the chemical potential for this
multi-species material. As above, we suppose there are k different kinds of particles, with
particle volumes νi and particle numbers ni , i = 1, . . . , k. To calculate the chemical potentials, µj , we use the Gibb’s free energy
G = −kB T S + U + P V,

(2)

where U is internal energy,
S is entropy, T is temperature, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, P
P
is pressure, and V = j νj nj is the total volume of the system. However, we assume that
the volume occupied by species j = 4, · · · , k (which are the ions dissolved in the solvent)
is small compared to that of the monomer plus solvent volumes νp np + νs ns and so take
V = νp np + νs ns . The chemical potential are given by

the number of cross-linked monomers per total number of monomers in one chain, and
the number of monomers per chain, respectively. Finally, the expressions for the entropic
chemical potentials are given in the article by Sircar et al. [82] and are not included here for

Internal Energy Contribution to Chemical Potentials (µIj )

The internal energy consists of two contributions, long range electrostatic interactions and
short range (nearest neighbor) interactions. The long range electrostatic interactions have

where zi is the charge on the i ionic species (z1 = z2 ≡ zp is the average charge per
monomer), and Φe is the electric potential.
To calculate the short range interaction energy for the polymer and solvent, we assume
that each of the nT (= np + ns ) particles have z neighboring interaction sites (called the
coordination number). Of the total of np monomers, k1 n1 and k2 n2 of them are the crosslinked PEG and ChS monomers, respectively. Since the cross-linked particles are pair-wise
connected, we treat each of these pair as a single species.
The different species with their pairwise interactions (i.e., the cross-linked species, x,
the uncross-linked species, u, and the solvent particles, s) are shown in Fig. 9.6. Following assumptions are made while calculating the per-particle interaction energy, U : (1) all
cross-links are assumed identical, (2) the cross-links are covalent permanent bonds, (3) the
polymers have long chains and hence the end-effects are neglected, and (4) different polymer
species have the same interaction energies if they are of the same type (e.g., uncross-linked
PEG and uncross-linked ChS monomers have the same interaction energy). The cross-linked
particle pair and the uncross-linked monomer have 2z-6 and z-2 free interaction sites based
on their position in the middle of the polymer chain, respectively (Fig. 9.6(a) and Fig.
9.6(b)). The solvent particles have z free interaction sites (Fig. 9.6(c)).

Fig. 9.6: Pairwise interactions of the different species and their associated interaction energies for: (a) cross-linked monomers, x, (b) uncross-linked monomers, u, and (c) solvent, s.
Double solid lines denote cross-linking, single solid lines denote interactions within a polymer
chain while the other types of interactions are denoted by dashed lines. The nearest neighbor
interactions are assumed identical for both the PEG and ChS monomer species.
The interaction energies for crosslinked, uncrosslinked polymer particles, and solvent
particles are calculated using standard mean-field arguments. For example, the interaction
energies for cross-linked particles, Fx (Fig. 9.6a), are calculated by noting that there are
2
either n21 pairs of only PEG monomers, n22 pairs of only ChS monomers or n1 +n
pairs of
2
both PEG and ChS monomers, respectively. The corresponding probabilities of forming
7

cross-links are k12 , k22 and k1 k2 . For each of these pairs, two neighboring sites are occupied by
the covalent cross-link, four neighboring interactions are the monomer-monomer interactions
within the polymer strands, and the remaining z −6 interactions are distributed to monomermonomer, with probability nnTp and monomer-solvent, with probability nnTs . Hence,

where the coefficients, χ, µp0 , µs0 , are referred as the Flory interaction parameter and the

of the particle fraction of the ChS strands (α), the interaction energy associated with the
uncross-linked monomer-monomer interaction (1 ), solvent-solvent interaction (2 ), covalent
cross-links interaction (3 ) and monomer-monomer bond within a polymer strand (4 ). The
factor 12 in the per-particle interaction energy in Eqn. (9) is to correct for double counting.
The corresponding contributions to chemical potentials (µIj ) are calculated via Eqn. (3).

Interface conditions

Under no-loading conditions, there is a free moving-edge to the gel on one side of which
(inside the gel) θp = θp− , θs = θs− , and on the other side of which (outside the gel) θp+ = 0,

for the solvent. n is the normal to the free surface. The interface conditions are derived
using the standard variational arguments to minimize the rate of work, which constitutes the
viscous rate of energy dissipated within the polymer and the solvent, energy dissipation rate
due to the drag between solvent and polymer and between solvent and ion species particles
as well as the rate of work required against the chemical potential, µj . These interface
conditions contain the contribution to the swelling pressure via the entropy, the Donnan
potential and the net osmolarity (or the swelling pressure coming from the difference between
the concentrations of ions dissolved in the gel and those dissolved in the bath, outside the
gel). The derivation details can be seen in [46, 47, 82].

9.3.5

Ionized-species chemistry

We use the law of mass action to describe the chemical reaction. Under the assumption
of fast chemistry and diffusion, the forward and the back reaction rates in Eqn. (1) are
balanced. Those relations provide us with quasi-equilibrium concentration of the monomer
species (e.g., m = [M2− ], y = [MH− ], v = [MNa− ], w = [MH2 ], x = [MNa2 ] and q = [MHNa]).
Similarly, the quasi-equilibrium concentration of the ion species (n = [Na+ ], h = [H+ ] and
cl = [Cl− ]) reduces into
C = Cb e−zC Ψe ,
(12)
where C = h, n, cl , zn = zh = 1 and zcl = −1 and the subscript ‘b’ denotes the corresponding
bath concentrations (or concentrations outside the gel). The electrostatic potential, Ψe , is
determined by the electro-neutrality constraint inside the gel, namely,
(n + h − cl )θs + zp mT = 0,

(13)

where zp is the average charge per monomer. This charge depends on the residual charge of
the unbound and the bound ChS monomers, zp , given by
zp mT = −(2m + y + v).

(14)

From Eqns (13, 14), we can calculate the Donnan potential, zp Ψe . This potential is zero
outside the gel (since there is no polymer in that region).

9.4

Experimental methods

In vitro experiments provide the most intuitive mechanism for cartilage swelling-deswelling
kinetics. Recent experiments have confirmed that changes in external ion concentration
and pH affect not only the mechanical properties of cartilage, but also the biosynthetic
capabilities of chondrocytes. The experimental outcomes of Beekman et al. [7], Freed et al.
[25], Kisiday et al. [49], Regan et al. [73], Stading and Langer [84], Vunjak-Novakivic et al.
[96] and Wilson et al. [99], all share a common feature: collagen accumulation in engineered
cartilage tend toward a constant value (steady state) with respect to time. A similar type
of result was obtained by Buschmann [16] for GAG molecule accumulation in engineered
cartilage constructs.
According to the results on DNA content of engineered cartilage constructs obtained by Wilson et al.
[99] (Fig. 9.7), there is an increasing trend of cell population growth that means the cell population has no
control (i.e., it keeps on increasing unboundedly), but
this is not the case in nature. Hence, overall experimental observations suggests that ECM deposition in
cell-polymer construct of engineered cartilage heading
towards a steady state but there is no concrete evidence that chondrocytes population does the same.
Our experimental validation of the model, described previously, is performed by running a subset Fig 9.7: DNA concentration Source:

of in vitro experiments in tandem with the proposed
computational experiments described below. We construct ionic gels by co-polymerizing methacrylated chondroitin sulfate and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate in deionized water (distilled water). PEG was chosen since it can be used
as a neutral, cross-linked, 3-D scaffold, a system that promotes the deposition of proteoglycans and collagen molecules and emulates the mechanical strength, load bearing capabilities
and resilience of cartilage tissue. The ChS component serves two purposes: to mimic the
biochemical environment of cartilage (since it is the main component of proteoglycans) and
to introduce fixed negative charges into the network. These polymer gels are then allowed
to reach equilibrium in deionized water (e.g., 24 hours) and then placed into appropriate
solution (e.g., with variable pH, salt concentration, etc.) to reach a new equilibrium.
To quantify the local configuration of the polymer gels, the counter-ion concentrations and
the osmolarity inside these gels, the following in-vitro experiments were performed and the
results were utilized to validate the outcome of numerical simulations: (i) Vary the particle
fraction of PEG:ChS in a salt-free, neutral bath (Hb = 10−7 M), where α, the particle fraction
of ChS, is: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1. This experiment is performed to determine the role
of fixed charges. Since the ChS monomer volume and the density are constant, increasing
the particle fraction of ChS directly corresponds to increasing its weight fraction. (ii) Vary
the bath concentration of the monovalent salt within a range of concentrations, 0.1-1 M, and
(iii) repeat experiments (i) and (ii) in a salt-free bath and variable pH for neutral hydrogels
(i.e., α = 0) as well as for ionic gels (i.e., α > 0). The pH is varied in the range 3-8 to
ensure that the model accurately captures the local variables (i.e., the volume fractions and
the osmolarity), within the physiological range [57]. Further, the above mentioned three
sets of experiments are repeated for gels with different cross-link fractions. Gels of varying
cross-link density are achieved by changing the total monomer concentration in solution prior
to polymerization (e.g., 10 wt %, 20 wt %, and 30 wt % gel). Polymer volume fraction is
determined from equilibrium swollen volume and dry polymer volume measurements and
compared to the numerically determined value. The initial volume of the dry polymer, Vi ,
was determined from the initial mass, mi , using a weighted density of PEG and ChS, as

The mass of the gel at equilibrium was measured and used to determine the swollen volume,

for chondroitin sulfate, and therefore a change in mass was solely due to the a change in the

The volume fraction of the polymer was calculated as the volume of the dry polymer (i.e.
before swelling) divided by the volume of the swollen gel, Vi /Vswollen . The kinetic chains
associated with methacrylate group (-MA) represents less than one percent of the total gel
volume and therefore are not considered in the volume calculations.

Comparison of model outcomes with experiments: parameter estimation

The values of the parameters used in numerical calculations are listed in Table 9.1. The
constants in the model are the monomer volumes, ν1 , ν2 , the coordination number of the
PEG-ChS polymer lattice, z, and the nearest neighbor interaction energies, i (§9.5.2). The
undetermined constants are the binding affinities of the polymer gel with Sodium (Kn ) and
hydrogen (Kn ).
The monomer volumes are found from the density and the molecular weight information
(νi = Mi /(ρi ∗ NA )). The cross-linked PEG-ChS matrix has a 3-D configuration, which
suggests that we choose the coordination number, z = 6, which mimicks a 3-D cubic lattice.
The standard free energies, kB T0 µ0p and kB T0 µ0s and the interaction energies, i are found
from the Hildebrand solubility data, δi [?]. The standard free energy is the energy of all the
interactions between the molecule and its neighbors in a pure state that have to be disrupted
to remove the molecule from the pure state.
The molecular mass and the density of PEG were fixed at 4600 g/mol and 1.07 g/mL,
while that of ChS were selected at 48700 g/mol and 1.001 g/mL, respectively. These values
give the monomer volumes of the PEG chains as ν1 = 7.14 × 10−21 cm3 , and that of ChS
chains as ν2 = 8.08 × 10−20 cm3 . The density of the solvent, ρsolvent , was assumed to be
1.00 g/ml and the volume of 1 molecule of water at reference temperature, T0 = 298K, is
νw = 2 × 10−23 cm3 . The Hildebrand solubility parameters for pure species (values given
in Table ??) and the monomer volumes are used to calculate the interaction energies, i
(i=1,...,4). Using the solubility relations [82], these values are fixed at 1 = 0.0, 2 = 3.74, 3 =
9.58, 4 = −56.17. The reference temperature of the experiments was fixed at T0 = 298K.
The undetermined parameters, namely the binding affinity of the polymer gel with various
cations (Kh , Kn ) are computed by minimizing a nonlinear least-square difference function
between the experimentally observed values of the equilibrium volume fraction, θp , and
the corresponding model output, implemented via the MATLAB non-linear least-square
minimization function lsqnonlin. These values are found as log10 (Kn ) = −2.17, log10 (Kh ) =
−3.65.

Effect of structural and environmental fluctuations on equilibrium ECM configuration

Articular cartilage is composed of highly negatively charged aggrecan aggegates dispersed
in a crosslinked collagen network. This chemical make-up gives rise to an unusually high
concentration of mobile-counter ions (e.g., Na+) in the interstitial fluid of the tissue. As
a result, the cartilage tissue experiences a complex set of electromechanical cues (signals)
arising from fixed negative charges (aggrecan), and mobile-counter ions, in equilibrium. Understanding and recapitulating the electromechanical cues in a tissue engineering approach
may be key to bioengineering functionally competent cartilage.

Effects of changes in ionization, cross-links

Fig. 9a,b,c present the equilibrium volume fraction, corresponding Donnan potential and
the net-osmolarity versus the particle fraction of ChS, α, respectively. The various curves
represent gels with different cross-link fractions, (k1 , k2 , Eqn. 6). It can be shown that
the average charge per monomer (or the average ionization) increases in proportion to the
particle fraction, α. The gel is dissolved in salt-free, neutral water. Any far field boundary
effects are neglected in our numerical simulations, by assuming infinite bath conditions. The
negative charges on the gel causes water to dissociate into hydrogen (H+ ) and hydronium
(OH− ) ions. The free H+ ions bind with the monomers.
At low ionization (or low particle fraction values, α), the physically relevant solutions
swell as a function of increasing α. This is due to the increased swelling effect via the

Donnan potential (e.g., look at the trend of the volume fraction and the Donnan potential
in the range, 0 ≤ α ≤ 0.9). The physically relevant solutions are the largest and smallest
ones, if there are three solutions, because the intermediate solution is unstable. Another
trend is that the gel deswells versus increasing α, at high cross-link fraction and particle
fraction values (the curve denoted by CL3 in the range α > 0.9, figure). This observation is
corroborated by experimental results that a highly cross-linked network provides a barrier
against the Donnan potential and deswells at higher ionization levels [48,67].
9.5.2

Effects of changes in the bath salt concentration

Figure 9.10 a,b,c highlight the corresponding equilibrium volume fraction, Donnan potential
and the net-osmolarity versus the bath salt concentration, [NaCl]b , for polymer gels immersed
in a neutral water solution, respectively. These gels have variable cross-link fractions but a
fixed ChS particle fraction, α = 0.1. Usual features emerge at high concentrations ([NaCl]b ≥
10−3 M) and low concentrations ([NaCl]b ≤ 10−8 M) of salt. At higher salt concentrations,
the gel deswells and the deswelling is more prominent for specimen with greater cross-link
fraction. This is readily understood since at higher salt concentrations, more dissolved Na+
ions are furnished which can bind with the negatively charged gel. As a result, the primary
ingredient of swelling pressure, i.e., the Donnan potential, is negligible (Fig. 9.10b). High
cross-link density within the gel resists the swelling pressure which further enhances the
deswelled state of the gel. At lower concentrations of salt, there any hardly any Na+ (or H+ )
ions readily available to bind with the gel. The Donnan potential is nearly constant and this
feature leads to a fixed equilibrium state of the gel (θp ≈ 0.65).
For intermediate salt concentrations (10−8 < [NaCl]b < 10−3 M), a new swelling-deswelling
feature emerges, namely, there is a swelling, either gradual or through a phase transition,
as the salt concentration in the bath increases. The explanation for these swelling feature
is that there is a complicated interplay between ionization (which promotes swelling) and
increases in bath concentration of salt which promote deswelling [82].
9.5.3

Effects of changes in the bath pH

Two sets of numerical experiments are performed to predict the equilibrium volume fraction
of the charged gel. In the first experiment, cross-link fraction of the polymer matrix is
fixed, k1 = k2 = 0.25, while the ChS particle fraction is varied. Overall, it is found that
increasing the bath concentration of hydrogen leads to deswelling. The reason is that a
decrease in pH leads to an increase in the dissolved cations which readily bind with the gel,
thereby decreasing the gel ionization and the swelling effect via Donnan potential. In this
case, swelling is predominantly driven by the ionization which is induced by the Donnan
potential. The pressure created by the Donnan potential is about an order of magnitude
greater than potential induced osmotic pressure (e.g., compare the order of magnitude of the
curves in Fig. 9.11b versus Fig. 9.11c).
Another set of numerical simulations is carried to determine the equilibrium solutions of
gels having a fixed ChS particle fraction but a variable cross-link fraction. It is found that
gels progressively preferred a deswelled state in the order of increasing cross-link fraction
values, consistent with our observations in 9.5.2. In summary, for the values of parameters

Concluding remarks

In this chapter a description of the makeup of the cartilage tissues is given. We then provided a multi-phase, multi-species model to shed light on the swelling / de-swelling mechanism for ionic gels with covalent cross-links; as well as provided a detailed description of
the experimental methods to engineer these biogels. These polymeric biogels mimic the
electro-chemical environment of articular cartilage. Finally, we have highlighted the effect
of structural and environmental uctuations on the equilibrium tissue configuration.

16

Current research includes determining the counter-ion concentration and local osmolarity
in dynamically loaded gels, determining the effect of the environmental fluctuations on the
cartilage cell response and the tissue development. A synchronous development of biomechanical models and numerical schemes are following. Readers are requested to look at the
research work done by Stephanie Bryant et al. [13,95] on the experimental side and those
by Van Mou et al. [51,65,66] on the numerical end. Ultimately, in the long term, the scientists and the tissue engineers expect to answer the fundamental question through research in
this area, how important are electro-mechano-chemical cues in guiding cellular response and
cartilage tissue growth? Information gleaned from models and experiments will help understand the pathway to cartilage degeneration, repair strategies, maintaining healthy joints via
delayed tissue aging and developing superior mechano-chemically resistant biogels as joint
replacements.
