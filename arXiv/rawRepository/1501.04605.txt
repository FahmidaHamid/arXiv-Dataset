Abstract

into “R-tumors”, where “stochastic factors, presumably related
to errors during DNA replication, most strongly appear to affect their risk,” and “D-tumors”, where “deterministic factors
such as environmental mutagens or hereditary predispositions
strongly affect their risk”. On this basis, they give a prognosis
for the likely success of interventions to prevent these tumor
types:

Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) collected data on 31 different
tissue types and found a correlation of 0.8 between the logarithms of the incidence of cancer (LCI), and the estimated
number of stem cell divisions in those tissues (LSCD). Some
of their conclusions however are statistically erroneous. Their
excess risk score, “ERS” (log10 LCI × log10 LSCD), is nonmonotonic under a change of time units for the rates, which
renders meaningless the results derived from it, including a
cluster of 22 “R-tumor” types for which they conclude, “primary prevention measures are not likely to be very effective”.
Further, r = 0.8 is consistent with the three orders of magnitude variation in other unmeasured factors, leaving room for the
possibility of primary prevention if such factors can be intervened upon. Further exploration of the data reveals additional
findings: (1) that LCI grows at approximately the square root
of LSCD, which may provide a clue to the biology; (2) among
different possible combinations of the primary data, the one
maximizing the correlations with LCI is almost precisely the
formula used by Tomasetti and Vogelstein to estimate LSCD,
giving support to stem cell divisions as an independent factor
in carcinogenesis, while not excluding other such factors.

These results could have important public health implications. One of the most promising avenues for
reducing cancer deaths is through prevention. How
successful can such approaches be? The maximum
fraction of tumors that are preventable through primary prevention (such as vaccines against infectious
agents or altered lifestyles) may be evaluated from
their ERS. For nonhereditary D-tumors, this fraction
is high and primary prevention could make a major impact (31). Secondary prevention, obtainable
in principle through early detection, could further
reduce nonhereditary D-tumor-related deaths and is
also instrumental for reducing hereditary D-tumorrelated deaths. For R-tumors, primary prevention
measures are not likely to be very effective, and secondary prevention should be the major focus.

Key words: cancer incidence, stem cells, correlation, tumor types, linear regression, somatic mutation, fallacy, symbolic regression, prevention

Here I describe statistical problems with the paper that undermine these conclusions. These problems are so basic that
they ought to have been caught in review, but apparently were
not.
First, any statistic on “extra risk” should be invariant under
a change in the units of time used to measure the rates. Their
ERS statistic not only fails to be invariant, but is non-monotonic
under a simple change of time units in the data. This renders
meaningless all the conclusions based on it.
Second, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what
high correlations imply. The argument that “primary prevention measures are not likely to be very effective” rests on the
idea that high correlations between a variable not subject to intervention (number of stem cell divisions) and a target variable
(cancer incidence) means that the target variable is mostly non-

Introduction
A paper recently published in Science, “Variation in cancer risk
among tissues can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions” by Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015), investigates the
relationship between the number of stem cell divisions in various tissue types and the incidence of tumors in them. They find
a strong correlation, 0.8, between the logarithms of these two
values (both Spearman’s rank correlation ρ and Pearson’s linear
correlation r). They use the product of these logarithms, which
they call the “extra risk score” (ERS) to classify tumor types

susceptible to intervention.
This is wrong on two counts: first, because the correlation
is between logarithms, it is possible for a second, unmeasured
factor to vary, in this case over four orders of magnitude, and
still maintain the correlation of 0.8 for the data. Second, correlations only put limits on the existing variation of unknown
factors; they have nothing to say about novel interventions that
may be developed which change that variation. This latter point
is well developed in Feldman and Lewontin (1975), an article
prompted by the misuse of heritability measures of human intelligence. The potential misuse of correlation measures in decisions about cancer research prompts the work here.
Putting aside the statistical problems in Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015), further exploration of their data reveal some
tantalizing clues to the biology of cancer.
First, the best fit to the data indicates that cancer incidence
grows not in proportion to the number of stem cell divisions
in a tissue, but in proportion close to the square root. Second, an exploration of different combinations of primary data,
s and d, they use to estimate the lifetime number of stem cell
divisions shows the correlations with the lifetime cancer incidence are maximized almost precisely by the formula they use,
LSCD = s(2 + d) − 2. This suggests that their estimate for
the number of stem cell divisions or a closely related formula
is a real biological factor in the incidence of cancer, while not
ruling out the possibility of other central factors.

The Ill-Behaved “Extra Risk Score”
(ERS)

LCI/LSCD. On the logarithmic scale this would be log10 LCI −
log10 LSCD. For unknown reasons, the authors instead devise
a statistic ERS(LCI, LSCD) := log10 LCI × log10 LSCD. They
also considered using log10 LCI/ log10 LSCD (see their Supplement) but reject it, not on first principles, but because it is “suboptimal”:
“Note that using the ratio between the log10 values
of r [LCI] and lscd , instead of the product, would
be sub-optimal to estimate the extra risk. . . . When
ERS is defined as the product rather than the ratio,
the expected relationship is evident”.
One expected relationship that should be evident for a measurement of extra risk is that it be invariant under a change of
time units. If the time units were changed from per lifetime to
per lifetime/T , this should be irrelevant to a measure of “cancer risk of that tissue type relative to its number of stem cell
divisions”.
However, we find that ERS is extremely ill-behaved in this
regard: it is not invariant, and even worse, it is non-monotonic.
This can be seen from its expansion:
ERS(LSCD/T, LCI/T )
= ERS(LSCD, LCI)
− T (log10 LSCD + log10 LCI) + (log10 T )2 .
The relationship between ERS for the data set using time units
T = 1 and T = 1000 is plotted in Figure 1. We see that a
simple change of time measurement units essentially scrambles
the ERS scores.

Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) introduce their ERS statistic:
We next attempted to distinguish the effects of
this stochastic, replicative component from other
causative factors—that is, those due to the external
environment and inherited mutations. For this purpose, we defined an extra risk score (ERS) as the
product of the lifetime risk and the total number of
stem cell divisions (log10 values). . . .
The ERS provides a test of the approach described in
this work. If the ERS for a tissue type is high—that
is, if there is a high cancer risk of that tissue type relative to its number of stem cell divisions—then one
would expect that environmental or inherited factors
would play a relatively more important role in that
cancers risk (see the supplementary materials for a
detailed explanation). It was therefore notable that
the tumors with relatively high ERS were those with
known links to specific environmental or hereditary
risk factors (Fig. 2, blue cluster).
The most straightforward statistic to measure the “cancer
risk of that tissue type relative to its number of stem cell divisions” would be the ratio of risk to the number of cell divisions,

and secondary prevention should be the major focus.

Residual Risk
Clearly, Tomasetti and Vogelstein’s ERS = log10 LCI ×
log10 LSCD is so ill-behaved that it has no meaning. The two
natural choices for measuring extra risk are:
1. Normalized Incidence: This is simply the lifetime cancer incidence divided by the lifetime number of stem cell
divisions. In log scale:

prediction function.

That this is fortuitous can be seen in the completely different
mathematical structures of ERS and RR:

NI := log10 LCI − log10 LSCD.
2. Residual Risk: This is the lifetime cancer incidence divided by the incidence predicted from the linear regression. In log scale:
RR := log10 LCI − P[log10 LCI],
where
P[log10 LCI] = 0.533 log10 LSCD − 7.61

is the linear predictor function from regression of log10 LCI on
log10 LSCD (plotted with the data in Figure 2):
In Table 1 the 31 tumor types are sorted by their residual risk
values,
RR = log10 LCI − (0.533 log10 LSCD − 7.61).
(this has been posted on at least one online blog, “Peer 3”
(2015)).
Topping the list is lung cancer in smokers, followed principally by the tumors labeled with inherited or viral risk factors.
This supports the argument of Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015)
for “incorporation of a replicative component as a third, quantitative determinant of cancer risk” in addition “environmental
or inherited factors.”
We also see something remarkable. The types identified by
Tomasetti and Vogelstein as “excess risk” based on the spurious ERS statistic largely maintain their positions in the top
of the list based on the RR statistic. The reason for this is pure
coincidence: it happens that, on this data set, the correlation between RR and ERS is fortuitously high: r(ERS, RR) = 0.83,
ρ(ERS, RR) = 0.80.

ERS = log10 LCI × log10 LSCD,

RR = log10 LCI − (0.533 log10 LSCD − 7.61).

For comparison, the rank correlation between ERS and ERS
with time units rescaled by 0.001 is only 0.24 (Figure 1), and
between ERS and NI it is only 0.09. Note that ρ(NI, RR) =
0.618.
This coincidental correlation may have been the reason that
ERS was retained by the authors, because it sorted the tumor
types in an order similar to the vertical position of the points
relative to the predictor line in Figure 2.
If one wanted to distinguish “R-tumors” from “D-tumors”
based on Table 1, one certainly could, since there are several
large gaps between RR values, notably between Gallbladder
and Glioblastoma. But an goodness-of-fit test (Anderson and
Darling, 1952) shows the distribution of RR values to be indistinguishable from a Gaussian normal distribution (P = 0.977),
and the gap sizes not significantly different from an exponential
distribution (P = 0.51). Caution should therefore be used in
making any claims based on these gaps.
We also see in Table 1 that the residual risk spans 2.862 =
1.211 + 1.651 orders of magnitude. A correlation of 0.8 between the logarithms of LSCD and LCI therefore does not preclude three orders-of-magnitude variation in LCI due to other
factors. This is elaborated upon in the next section. If we consider only those tumor types with negative RR, there are still
almost 2 orders of magnitude variation due to unknown factors.
If not from errors in the data, something is suppressing the incidence of certain tissue tumors to only 2% of that predicted
from the log LSCD regression.

The fallacy that high correlations preclude intervention
Tomasetti and Vogelstein point out that the correlation between
log10 LSCD and log10 LCI is extremely robust to noise, and
therefore makes their results robust. What they do not realize
is that this very robustness argues against their conclusion that
“for R-tumors, primary prevention measures are not likely to
be very effective”, because it allows large variation in unknown
factors that could also control cancer incidence rates while having little effect on the correlation.
Tomasetti and Vogelstein measure this robustness by adding
noise to the data to see how much it changes the correlation. They add both Gaussian and uniformly distributed random noise to their estimates of lifetime number of stem cell
divisions. For the uniform variation, they examine the correla-

tions between LCI and LSCD + U(−2, 2), where U(−2, 2) is a
uniformly distributed random variable on the interval [−2, 2].
Under 10,000 replicates they find the addition of this four
orders-of-magnitude noise only reduces the median value of
Spearman’s rank correlation ρ (Spearman, 1904) from 0.81 =
ρ(LCI, LSCD) to 0.67 = ρ(LCI, LSCD + U(−2, 2)), which is
still significantly different from zero:
Thus, though the total range for LSCD is ∼ 6 orders
of magnitude and we allowed four 4 [sic] orders of
magnitude variation for each data point, the correlations generated were always statistically significant.
This provides strong evidence that our results are robust. [Supplement p. 11]
But the robustness of the high correlation to order-ofmagnitude variations in the data has its converse implication: it
means that high correlation cannot rule out order-of-magnitude
variation in other factors that may determine the rates of cancer.
We see this in Table 1.
To illustrate this converse implication, suppose that LCI were
determined by two factors, LSCD, and another, unknown preventative factor “X” that reduces the rate of cancer in proportion
to its value. How much variation in X could there be and still
obtain correlations of 0.8 between log10 LSCD and log10 LCI?
The general problem is to compute the correlation, r (Pearson, 1901), between Y , and Y plus uncorrelated noise, Z:
Cov(Y, Y + Z)
p
r(Y, Y + Z) = p
Var(Y ) Var(Y + Z)
1
=r
.
Var(Z)
1+
Var(Y )
The solution of r(Y, Y +Z) = 0.8 is Var(Z) = 0.5625 Var(Y ).
To be concrete, let LCI = c ∗ LSCD ∗ X, where the constant c
does not enter into the correlation. Then log10 LCI = log10 c +
log10 LSCD + log10 X. We let log10 LSCD be distributed as a
uniform random variable on the interval [6.50, 12.55], the actual range from the data. We let log10 X be distributed as an
independent random variable uniform on [−w, 0], and ask how
big w can be and yet maintain 0.8 = r(log10 LCI, log10 LSCD).
The solution is w = 4.5—four orders of magnitude.
It may be helpful to see what the distribution of this hypothetical preventative factor X looks like, in Figure 3. We see
huge variation in the population incidence of cancer due to hypothetical factor X, even though there is still a correlation of
0.8 between log10 LSCD and log10 LCI. Therefore, the correlation of 0.8 does not rule out the presence of other factors—
genetic, environmental, physiological, or measurement error—
that can produce over four orders-of-magnitude variation in
cancer rates. Such factors could potentially include environmental variation that is subject to intervention.

the mean squared displacement grows in proportion to time
or the number of steps taken. In such cases we would need
to ask what properties of cells follow a random walk under
cell division. Models of telomere length come to mind here
(Blythe and MacPhee, 2013; Duc and Holcman, 2013). Another source could be geometry—boundaries of regions that
grow along two-dimensions (e.g. the perimeter of a growing
circle, or the surface of an elongated cylinder growing in diameter) can have close to a square-root relationship to that growth.
Provided the right geometry, a square-root relationship could
conceivably emerge if the boundaries of tissues played a role
in carcinogenesis. There may be plausible sources of one-half
power laws to be elicited from the work on scaling relationship
in biology (c.f. Savage et al. (2013)).

The Formula for LSCD

Further Explorations
The problems described above do not diminish the fact that
Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) have produced an important
data set, and the strong correlation they find between the logarithms of lifetime number of stem cell divisions and the rates of
cancer in different tissues provides evidence for a real biological phenomenon. Their data therefore deserve deeper investigation.

The appearance of the exponent 0.533 in the relationship between LCI and LSCD prompts us to examine more closely how
the estimate of LSCD was made. Their Supplement explains
that the formula for LSCD is:
LSCD = s(2 + d) − 2,

(3)

where

A One-Half Power Law?

s is the total number of stem cells found in a fully developed
tissue, and

The predictor function (2) translates to an approximate power
law of

d is the number of further divisions of each stem cell in the
lifetime of that tissue once the tissue is fully developed,
due to normal tissue turnover.

LCI ≈ 10 −7.61 LSCD 0.533 .

(2)

A power law with exponent 0.533 is not what we would have
expected from a simple stem cell division hypothesis. The simple hypothesis would predict the cancer incidence should grow
in proportion to the number of stem cell divisions, with exponent 1.00. What we find instead is that it grows in proportion
to approximately the square root of the number of stem cell divisions (this has been noted in comments on at least one online
blog, Kuenzel (2015)).
The value 0.533 may, however, reflect regression dilution—a
systematic reduction in the slope of the predictor function due
to large amounts of noise in the independent variable. This
is likely here because the estimate of the number of stem cell
divisions, LSCD, combines multiple and sometimes uncertain
primary data. Improvements in the estimation of LSCD and
inclusion of more tissue types in the data would therefore be
expected to increase the slope.
If, however, further data lent support to a power law with
an exponent of one-half, it would invite biological speculation.
One would want to examine probabilistic models for the mutational basis of carcinogenesis to see where probabilities scaled
in proportion to the square root of the number of cell divisions.
Random walks and diffusions provide another possibility, since

Suppose instead of this formula, we explored the space of
possible combinations of the primary data s and d (i.e we are
pursuing symbolic regression (Koza, 1990)). Could modern
data mining software discover the stem cell division hypothesis by finding patterns in the data (c.f. Schmidt and Lipson
(2009))? Could we find combinations of s and d with higher
correlations to LCI?
We first explore the effect of changing the additive constants
in (3). For Spearman’s ρ, the constant −2 is irrelevant. We
embed s(2+d)−2 in the family of formulae, ψ(c) := s(c+d)−
2. For c ∈ [0, 20], ρ(ψ(c), LCI) varies only between 0.776 and
0.810, with a broad peak for 0.8 ≤ c ≤ 6.1. The robustness of
ρ to variation in the constants means the data give no particular
validation to their values in the formula for LSCD (3).
Since log10 LSCD ≈ log10 s + log10 d, hence (1) is approximated by
P[log10 LCI] ≈ 0.533 (log10 s + log10 d) − 7.61.
Suppose instead of equal weights on log10 s and log10 d, we
embed s(2 + d) − 2 in the family of formulae,
φ(t) := s (2 − t) (2 + d t ) − 2.

6

The parameter t varies φ(t) continuously from φ(0) = 3s2 − 2,
to φ(1) = LSCD, to φ(2) = d2 . We find that
ρ(φ(0), LCI) = ρ(s, LCI) = 0.68,
ρ(φ(1), LCI) = ρ(LSCD, LCI) = 0.81,

Nonetheless, the optimality of the formula of Tomasetti and
Vogelstein is at least suggestive: that something close to s × d
has a real biological role in the incidence of cancer. It is a separate form of evidence from the 0.8 magnitude of the correlation
itself.

ρ(φ(2), LCI) = ρ(d, LCI) = 0.60.

for φ(t) := s (2 − t) (2 + d t ) − 2. The peaks are near t = 1, where
φ(1) = LSCD.

For the range of t, Figure 4 plots the correlations ρ(φ(t), LCI)
and r(φ(t), LCI). There peaks are very near the value t = 1
where φ(1) = LSCD.
Therefore, by simply looking for correlations between LCI
and different combinations of s and d, we come up with a formula very close to the formula developed by Tomasetti and Vogelstein from first principles for the total number of stem cell
divisions in a tissue. There is no a priori reason that the peak
should occur near t = 1.0, since s, d, and LCI are independently obtained data sets (the rank correlation between s and d
is only 0.23).
Could this be a coincidence? We can get some idea of that
likelihood. Bootstrap resampling of the 31 tissue types for the
values of t that maximize ρ(φ(t), LCI) gives a central 50%
interval of (0.909, 1.009), with a median and sharp mode at
t = 0.971. Subjecting s and d to multiplicative noise (replacing
s and d by s × ν1 and d × ν2 , where ln ν1 , ln ν2 ∼ N (0, 1/82 ),
ν1 , ν2 independent), gives a median of 0.954 and 50% central
range of (0.928, 0.973).
So, yes it could be a coincidence that the optimal t is so close
to 1.0. Chance can’t be ruled out as to why the formula of
Tomasetti and Vogelstein seems to provide the maximal correlation to the rates of cancer incidence. We cannot rule out there
being other relationships between s and d that give even higher
correlations with the cancer incidence data. It will require expansion of the data set to more tissue types, more precise estimates of the number of stem cell divisions, and exploration of
other models of the biology to resolve this question.

The publication of Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) was announced by Johns Hopkins University with the press release
headline, “Bad Luck of Random Mutations Plays Predominant
Role in Cancer, Study Shows.” Probability theory was created
to make reasoning about “luck” a rigorous science. People’s
reasoning about probabilities—luck—is a notoriously errorprone activity, and the characterization of these errors is now a
scientific field that has burgeoned since the pioneering work of
(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). There is a wide intuition that
there is a zero-sum tradeoff between control and luck in determining events: the more control we have, the less we depend
on luck. This intuition of a tradeoff resonates with the mathematical structure of the analysis of variance, in which total
variance is partitioned into a sum of variances and covariances.
However, when two factors, “luck” (L) and “control” (C) interact multiplicatively, as L × C, then there is no necessary
tradeoff between them at all. And as described here, because of
the nature of logarithms, a high correlation between log L, and
log L + log C, does not preclude large variation in C.
Beyond this issue of correlations between logarithms, and
the erroneous use of the ill-behaved “extra risk score” (ERS),
there is the additional pitfall of cognitive framing. If Tomasetti
and Vogelstein had presented an 80% correlation between logarithms of the number of stem cell divisions and cancer mortality
for different tissues, instead of incidence, would they have then
argued “cancer treatment measures are not likely to be very effective, and prevention should be the major focus”? Of course
not, because novel cancer treatments are something new under
the sun. The cognitive frame in this case draws on our familiarity with the history of medicine in which many new cures have
been found that obliterate past correlations.
The experience of “dramatic cure” has no parallel in experiences of “dramatic prevention” (except to a statistician) because prevention is a non-event. Therefore, the fallacy that
“high correlation precludes intervention” can find an easier
home when reasoning about prevention.
Cures, primary prevention, and secondary prevention are
simply interventions at different stages of disease. Correlations
found in the present do not bear on what interventions may be
found in the future for any of these disease stages. If anything,
the track record of human discovery to date has been that cancer prevention is much easier to discover than cancer cure. But
the future has yet to be written.
Leaving aside the erroneous statistics of Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015) and the conclusions based on them, as biology
it is a significant finding that there is a high rank correlation

S TATISTICAL P ROBLEMS IN A PAPER ON VARIATION I N C ANCER R ISK A MONG T ISSUES

between (1) cancer incidence, and (2) the estimated number of
stem cell divisions in a tissue. Additional upport for that significance is presented here: that among various possible combinations of the primary data, the one that produces the highest correlation to cancer incidence is precisely the formula Tomasetti
and Vogelstein obtain from biological first principles. Although
this could be a statistical coincidence and requires additional
data to confirm, it can be seen as a novel form of support for
the hypothesis stem cell divisions are an independent causal
factor for cancer.
Materials and Methods
Data sets were obtained from the Supplement to Tomasetti and Vogelstein (2015). All computations and statistics were carried out using
MathematicaTM . The code used is available upon request.
