Abstract
Culinary practices are influenced by climate, culture, history and geography. Molecular
composition of recipes in a cuisine reveals patterns in food preferences. Indian cuisine
encompasses a number of diverse sub-cuisines separated by geographies, climates and cultures. Its
culinary system has a long history of health-centric dietary practices focused on disease prevention
and promotion of health. We study food pairing in recipes of Indian cuisine to show that, in contrast
to positive food pairing reported in some Western cuisines, Indian cuisine has a strong signature
of negative food pairing; more the extent of flavor sharing between any two ingredients, lesser
their co-occurrence. This feature is independent of recipe size and is not explained by ingredient
category-based recipe constitution alone. Ingredient frequency emerged as the dominant factor
specifying the characteristic flavor sharing pattern of the cuisine. Spices, individually and as a
category, form the basis of ingredient composition in Indian cuisine. We also present a culinary
evolution model which reproduces ingredient use distribution as well as negative food pairing of
the cuisine. Our study provides a basis for designing novel signature recipes, healthy recipe
alterations and recipe recommender systems.
Introduction
Culinary practices are shaped by complex interplay of culture, climate, geography
and genetics (1–6). These factors influence food preferences and recipe composition, thereby
altering the fabric of cuisine. Recipe composition pattern in a cuisine provides a means for
investigating its gastronomic history and molecular constitution. The shift to cooked diet has been
proposed to be a trigger for increased brain size in humans (7). Indian culinary system has
traditionally developed dietary practices where food has nutritional as well as medicinal value (8–
10). Ayurveda, the classic medicinal system of India, proposes that food has as much therapeutic
value as drugs and even uses similar processing techniques for their preparation (11, 12).

In this study, we analyzed the recipe composition as well as flavor compound constitution of the
Indian cuisine in search of its quintessential features. Specifically, we quantified the food pairing
pattern and built models to identify features that explain statistical properties of the cuisine. The
flavor constitution of the Indian cuisine was explored for ingredient composition and food pairing
at the levels of cuisine, sub-cuisines, recipes and ingredient pairs. We built controls to probe for
the role of factors that may be crucial in shaping recipes and hence the cuisine. Further we
developed models to explain evolution of cuisine and its characteristic features. Our study
illustrates application of data analysis and modeling for exploring chemical basis of a cuisine.

Results
The Indian cuisine. The traditional recipes of Indian cuisine are documented in the form of books
(2) and lately through online repositories. We compiled the recipes data from TarlaDalal (13)
(http://www.tarladalal.com, November 2014), one of the largest, most extensive online repertoires
of original Indian recipes (SI Text). After curation, the Indian cuisine contained 2543 recipes from
following eight sub-cuisines: Bengali, Gujarati, Jain, Maharashtrian, Mughlai, Punjabi, Rajasthani
and South Indian. These sub-cuisines span diverse geographies, climates and cultures of Indian
subcontinent. After aliasing ingredient names, the recipes comprised of 194 unique ingredients (SI
Text and Dataset S1). The ingredients belong to following 15 categories: spice, vegetable, fruit,
plant derivative, nut/seed, cereal/crop, dairy, plant, pulse, herb, meat, fish/seafood, beverage,
animal product, and flower. Certain pulses (millets), lentils, spices and vegetables, seldom used in
other cuisines, were common to Indian cuisine (SI Text).
Recipe size distribution reflects the ingredient richness of recipes in the cuisine. Similar to other
cuisines (4, 14, 15), the recipe size distribution of Indian cuisine is bounded, varying between 1
and 40 with an average size of 7 (Fig. 1A). Mughlai sub-cuisine, with a royal lineage, had bimodal
distribution with exceptionally large recipe sizes. Ingredient frequency when plotted against rank,
by ordering ingredients according to their prevalence in the cuisine, reflects bias in use of
ingredients. The frequency-rank distribution of the Indian cuisine varies over three orders of
magnitude following a scale-free distribution (Fig. 1B). All sub-cuisines have strikingly similar
profiles, indicative of generic culinary growth mechanisms (Fig 1B, inset). A few ingredients are
excessively used, indicating either their inherent ‘fitness’ or possible accidental lock-in (15).
Knowing that many cuisines share this property (4, 14, 15), the question is whether pattern of use
of ingredients has any role in rendering the profile of a cuisine.
Food pairing is measured in terms of overlap of flavor profiles. The composition of recipes in
a cuisine could be studied in terms of co-occurrence of ingredients (14, 16). One of the notions
associated with ingredient co-occurrence is positive food pairing hypothesis— ingredients sharing
flavor compounds are more likely to taste well together than ingredients that do not (14, 17). While
this hypothesis holds true for some cuisines (North American, Western European and Latin
American), it does not hold for a few others (Southern European and East Asian) that have negative
food pairing (14). Thus, beyond following generic statistical patterns in recipe sizes as well as
ingredient use, skewed food pairing seems to be a unique feature representing molecular basis of
2

ingredient combinations dominant in a cuisine. Towards the aim of quantifying the pattern of
ingredient composition of recipes, we studied food pairing (sharing of flavor compounds) in Indian
cuisine.
While food sensation is a result of interplay between various aspects of ingredients, such as texture,
color, temperature and sound, flavor plays a dominant role in specifying culinary fitness of
ingredients and their combinations (18, 19). Flavor mediated food perception, primarily involving
molecular interactions with olfactory and gustatory receptors, is crucial in developing food
preferences in humans, and has coevolved with nutritional needs (20). Molecular composition of
food dictates the sensation of flavor (21). Each ingredient is characterized by a set of chemical
compounds which forms its flavor profile. Flavor profile provides us an effective tool for exploring
patterns in ingredient composition of recipes. We obtained the flavor profiles for all ingredients in
the Indian cuisine with the help of previously published data (14), a resource of flavor ingredients
(21) and by extensive literature search (SI Text, Dataset S2). The flavor profiles, comprising of a
total of 1170 unique compounds, had a size range of 270. Across this range of profile size,
ingredient category representation was fairly uniform (Fig. S1).
The interrelationship among ingredients by virtue of shared flavor compounds could be
represented as a flavor graph that illustrates the underlying topology of flavor sharing (Fig. S2 and
S3). The ingredients have dominant intra-category flavor sharing indicating significant overlap of
flavor profiles within the category (Fig. S4). We quantified flavor sharing in a recipe (𝑁𝑠𝑅 ) and
̅̅̅𝑠 ) by comparing profiles of ingredient pairs and their joint
average flavor sharing of the cuisine (𝑁
occurrence in recipes. Figure 2 illustrates this quantification procedure starting from data of recipes
and flavor profiles
Indian cuisine is characterized with strong negative food pairing. We found that average flavor
sharing in Indian cuisine was significantly lesser than expected by chance (Fig. 3A). When
computed for all recipes in the cuisine, average flavor sharing for Indian cuisine was found to be
5.876, as compared to that of 9.442 for a randomized cuisine, which was constructed by randomly
picking the ingredients while maintaining the recipe size distribution. This reflects a strong
̅𝑠𝐼𝐶 − 𝑁
̅𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 = -3.566 and Z-score of
signature of non-random ingredient co-occurrence (∆𝑁𝑠 = 𝑁
-54.727) skewed towards negative food pairing (Fig.3B). This is corroborated by the pattern of
extent of flavor sharing between pairs of ingredients and their co-occurrence in the cuisine (Fig.
4A). More the extent of flavor sharing between any two ingredients in the Indian cuisine, lesser is
their co-occurrence. The extent of food pairing bias in the Indian cuisine is much stronger than
reported earlier for any other cuisine (14, 22) and is persistent regardless of the recipe size (Fig.
3A). Our analysis also showed that each of the sub-cuisines independently displayed negative food
pairing, highlighting it as an invariant feature of the Indian cuisine (Fig. 3B). Thus, we conclude
that the Indian cuisine is characterized with a strong negative food pairing.
We further explored the origin of this characteristic pattern by controlling for category and
frequency of use of ingredients. The former is a recipe-level control that generates a cuisine by
preserving category composition of each recipe, whereas the latter is a cuisine-level control that
generates recipes by preserving frequency of occurrence of each ingredient. Interestingly, we
observed that controlling only for the ingredient frequency leads to food pairing pattern similar to
3

that of real-world cuisine (Fig. 3A, Fig. S5 and Fig. 4B). On the other hand, controlling only for
ingredient category led to a pattern similar to that of a randomized cuisine. A randomized control
that combines category-composition as well as ingredient frequency also reproduced the food
pairing pattern. Thus, ingredient frequency emerged as the dominant factor specifying the
characteristic flavor sharing pattern of the Indian cuisine. Considering the biased use of
ingredients, we investigated the role of top ranked ingredients by randomly swapping the top ten
ingredients with the rest. We found that indeed the highly ranked ingredients play a key role in
shaping the negative food pairing pattern of the cuisine, in contrast to ingredients with poor ranking
(Fig. S6).
A copy-mutate model of the Indian cuisine explains the negative ingredient pairing. Over the
years, the present repertoire of recipes in Indian cuisine would have evolved from a much smaller
primitive set of recipes. To probe for mechanisms and factors that may have influenced the cuisine,
we implemented the copy-mutate model proposed by Kinouchi et. al.(15). This model imitates
evolution of the cuisine to incorporate duplication and modification of recipes. The model with
randomly ascribed ingredient fitness reproduced the frequency-rank distribution (Fig. 5A), but had
̅̅̅𝑠 = 8.784, Fig. 5C). On the other hand, the cuisine
food pairing similar to a random cuisine (𝑁
generated using a modified copy-mutate model, in which the ingredient fitness was scaled to its
occurrence, acquired the characteristic flavor sharing pattern of real-world cuisine, reproducing
̅̅̅𝑠 = 6.183, Fig. 5 C and D). Interestingly, our model also suggests that
the negative food pairing (𝑁
the pattern of frequency-rank distribution may be a persistent feature throughout the evolution of
the cuisine, with presence of a few dominant ingredients (Fig. 5B). The fitness parameter in our
model could represent ingredient availability, flavor, nutritional value, cost and versatility (15).
Spices are uniquely placed in the recipes. Negative food pairing in the Indian cuisine is a
cumulative result of individual ingredient contributions by virtue of pairing with other ingredients
in recipes. To investigate the importance of individual ingredients and their categories in the
composition of recipes, we randomized ingredients of each category independently, while
maintaining the category as well as frequency of occurrence of the rest. We found that randomizing
ingredients in any of the categories, except spices, does not affect negative food pairing pattern,
thereby implying their insignificance (Fig. 6A). Spices, on the other hand, when swapped
selectively, randomize the negative food pairing significantly (Fig. 6A and B, ∆𝑁𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑒 = 4.229
and Z-score of -61.524). This implies that each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to
shape the flavor sharing pattern with rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even
with other spices, which is noteworthy given that the extent of flavor sharing is high among spices
(Fig. S4 A).
Spices are key contributors to the negative ingredient pairing. Beyond global statistical
features, we identified the ingredients that make key contributions towards the food pairing by
computing the extent to which their presence affects the magnitude of average food pairing (𝜒) .
We found that the key ingredients that contribute to negative food pairing of Indian cuisine were
spices (Fig. 6C). Among the top ten ingredients whose presence bias flavor sharing pattern of the
Indian cuisine towards negative pairing, nine were spices: cayenne, green bell pepper, coriander,
garam masala, tamarind, ginger garlic paste, ginger, clove, and cinnamon (SI Text and Dataset S3).

We surmise that this pivotal role of spices carries the evidence of historical practice of healthcentric diet in Indian subcontinent.
Discussion. Our study reveals that spices occupy a unique position in the ingredient composition
of Indian cuisine and play a major role in defining its characteristic profile. Spices, individually
and as a category, emerged as the most critical contributors to the negative food pairing.
Historically, they have been used as functional foods to serve multiple purposes such as coloring
and flavoring agents, preservatives, and additives (23). Spices also find mention as medicines in
Ayurveda as described in texts such as Charaka Samhita (11, 12, 24). One of the strongest
rationales for the use of spices is the antimicrobial hypothesis— spices are primarily used due to
their activity against food spoilage bacteria (3, 25). A few of the most potent antimicrobial spices
(26) are commonly used in Indian cuisine. Spices also serve as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
chemopreventive, antimutagenic, and detoxifying agents (24, 27). Our recent studies have shown
the beneficial role of capsaicin, an active component in cayenne which was revealed to be the most
critical ingredient in rendering the food pairing of the cuisine (28). The significance of spices in
Indian cuisine is also highlighted by the fact that its recipes have many derived ingredients that are
spice combinations (SI Text). Archeological evidences have suggested to the fact that lentils,
millets and spices, especially turmeric and garlic were used as ingredients in ancient Indus
civilizations (29, 30). We conclude that the evolution of cooking driven by medicinal beliefs would
have left its signature on traditional Indian recipes.
Traditionally, recipes have been passed down the generations via oral renditions. Documentation
of recipes in the form of cookbooks enable preservation of culinary practices (2). Our copy-mutate
model of culinary evolution incorporates aspects central to diversification of the cuisine and
closely reproduces its flavor sharing characteristics at the level of cuisine, recipes as well as
ingredient pairs. While we have examined Indian cuisine on the basis of one of the most
comprehensive resources, there is ample scope to enhance the analysis with enriched data. The
flavor profiles of ingredients are limited by the availability of data. Also, our study does not
account for the fact that certain flavor compounds may undergo changes in the process of cooking.
The study of molecular basis of the cuisine has potential to be extended into nutritional genomics
to explore the role of dietary chemicals in health (31, 32). Beyond revealing the characteristic food
pairing of Indian cuisine, our study could potentially lead to methods for creating novel Indian
signature recipes, healthy recipe alterations and recipe recommender systems.
Methods
Flavor sharing. We enumerated the flavor sharing (14) pattern among the ingredients that cooccur in a recipe, starting from the set of 2,543 (𝑁𝑅 ) traditional Indian recipes comprising of 194
(𝑁𝐼 ) ingredients (SI Text). We computed average number of shared compounds in each recipe 𝑁𝑠𝑅
and further calculated a representative average flavor sharing index ̅̅̅
𝑁𝑠 (= ∑𝑅 𝑁𝑠𝑅 ⁄𝑁𝑅 ) of the
cuisine. Figure 2 presents a graphic illustration of this procedure. For a recipe R with n ingredients
𝑁𝑠𝑅 is defined as,
𝑁𝑠𝑅 =

2
∑ |𝐹𝑖 ∩ 𝐹𝑗 |
𝑛(𝑛 − 1)
𝑖,𝑗𝜖𝑅,𝑖≠𝑗

5

where 𝐹𝑖 represents the flavor profile of ingredient 𝑖 (a set of compounds).
Average flavor sharing in Indian cuisine was compared with a corresponding randomized cuisine
̅𝑠𝐼𝐶 − 𝑁
̅𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 , where ‘IC’ and ‘Rand’
to assess its statistical relevance by computing ∆𝑁𝑠 = 𝑁
indicate Indian cuisine and corresponding random cuisine, respectively. Five types of randomized
cuisines were created by maintaining the recipe size distribution of the original Indian cuisine: a
randomized control where ingredients were chosen uniformly (20,000 recipes); a frequencypreserved control in which frequency of use of ingredients was preserved (20,000 recipes); a
category-preserved control in which while the category composition of the recipe was preserved,
ingredients were randomly chosen from each constituent category (8 sets of control cuisines,
20,344 recipes); a frequency-and-category-preserved control where the category composition was
maintained and each ingredient was chosen with probability consistent with its frequency in Indian
cuisine (8 sets of control cuisines, 20,344 recipes); a frequency-preserved randomized control
where the top 10 ranked ingredients in the Indian cuisine were randomly swapped with low ranked
(rank ≥ 11) ingredients (10 sets of control cuisines, 200,000 recipes). The statistical significance
of ∆Ns was measured with Z-score, 𝑍 = √𝑁𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑

̅𝑠𝐼𝐶 − 𝑁
̅𝑠𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 )
(𝑁
𝜎𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑

. Here NRand and 𝜎𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑑 represent

total number of recipes in the randomized cuisine and standard deviation, respectively.
Copy-mutate model. Copy-mutate model (15) imitates evolution of a cuisine to incorporate
duplication and modification of recipes. It was started with an initial set of recipes (𝑅0 = 20) of
size 𝐾 (= 7) each, by random selection of ingredients from a randomly populated ingredient pool.
This initial set was evolved by copying a recipe randomly, mutating it 𝐿(= 2) times and adding
this mutated recipe back to the set. For every mutation an ingredient was randomly chosen from
the recipe and was replaced with another ingredient chosen randomly from the pool, only if the
latter had higher fitness value than the former. New ingredients were introduced for maintaining
the size ratio of ingredient pool and recipe pool (𝑀 = 0.0762, consistent with that of Indian
cuisine). This process was repeated to obtain 61,032 recipes comprising 24 sets of cuisines
generated through copy-mutate model. While one of the models was implemented with the strategy
of Kinouchi et. al. (15) with randomly ascribed fitness values to ingredients (‘fitness random’), a
derivative of the same had fitness values scaled to ingredient frequency in the Indian cuisine
(‘fitness ranked’).
Ingredient uniqueness. Uniqueness of an ingredient of a given category by virtue of flavor
sharing pattern with other ingredients in the recipe was computed by replacing it with a randomly
chosen ingredient from the same category. Deviation in the average flavor sharing of the
randomized recipes (8 sets of control cuisines, 20,344 recipes) from that of the original cuisine
was measured, for 10 major categories (depicted in Fig. S4).

(80) and 0.6% (15) recipes are considered at cut-off of 15 and 20, respectively. While the recipes

1. Materials and methods
1.1 Data source selection
Our data on Indian cuisine was obtained from one of the leading cookery websites in India,
tarladalal.com. Among the various online resources available for recipes from Indian cuisines,
TarlaDalal (http://www.tarladalal.com) was found to be the best in terms of authentic recipes,
cuisine annotations and coverage across major regional subtypes. The website has 3330 recipes
from 8 Indian cuisines. Among others online sources, Sanjeev Kapoor
(http://www.sanjeevkapoor.com) has 3399 recipes from 23 Indian cuisines. NDTV Cooks
(http://cooks.ndtv.com) has 667 Indian recipes across 15 cuisines. Manjula’s Kitchen
(http://www.manjulaskitchen.com) is restricted to 730 Indian vegetarian recipes across 19 food
categories. Recipes Indian (http://www.recipesindian.com) has 891 recipes from around 16 food
categories. All Recipes (http://www.allrecipes.com) has only 449 recipes from 6 food categories.
In comparison to these sources, Tarladalal.com is the best source of recipes for Indian cuisine. The
statistics of sub cuisines, their recipes and ingredients is provided in Table S1.

1.2. Data collection and curation: Recipes
We started with the data containing 3330 recipes. This number was reduced after pruning to
remove duplicates and other inconsistencies, to obtain 3037 recipes. Recipes containing any of the
ingredients for which no flavor profile was available (349) were removed from the data, leaving
us with 2688 recipes. For the purpose of flavor sharing analysis,we removed ingredients from
‘snack’ and ‘additive’ categories, as their flavor profiles could not be determined. Finally, all
recipes having single ingredient were removed to obtain a final set of 2543 recipes.

The Indian cuisine from TarlaDalal comprise of 588 ingredients. For the purpose of mapping the
ingredients to their flavor profiles (list of volatileflavor compounds present in that ingredient),
these ingredient names were aliased to 339 source ingredients. These ingredients were categorised
into seventeen ingredient categories based on the nature of ingredients. Out of these 339 aliased
ingredients, we could obtain flavor profiles for 194 ingredients. By aliasing we mean, removing
the redundant terms in ingredient names. For instance, canned pineapple was aliased as pineapple.
Ingredient names in Hindi were translated to English. For instance anardaana was renamed as
pomegranate. Further we aliased some of the ingredient names for the purpose of matching our
ingredient names with their data. For instance bay leaf was named bay laurel. By crosschecking
with dataset of Ahn et al (1), ingredients unique to Indian cuisine were identified. A full list of
ingredient aliases, their categories and other details are provided in Dataset S1.

1.3. Compilation of the flavor profiles data
Our data of Indian cuisine as well as flavor compounds is not exhaustive. The original ingredient
number had to be drastically reduced as flavor profiles of some of the ingredients could not be
identified. Our main source of flavor compounds was obtained from the data made available by
Ahn et al(1). Out of 194 ingredients with flavor profiles, 146 were obtained from dataset of Ahn
et al(1). Ingredients for which the flavor data could not be obtained from either of these sources
(31), flavor profile were compiled by extensive literature survey. All the flavor profiles were cross
checked with those in 6th edition (latest) of Fenaroli’s Handbook of Flavor Compounds (2) so that
their names are used consistently. Chemical Abstract Service numbers were also used as unique
identifiers to bring consistency in nomenclature of flavor molecules. Detailed information of all
the ingredients and their flavor profile are provided in Dataset S2.

Fig. S2. Construction of flavor graph. (A) Illustration for construction of flavor graph of a
cuisine starting from its ingredients set and their flavor profiles. (B) The backbone extracted (3)
flavor graph of Indian cuisine. Ingredients are denoted by nodes and presence of shared flavor
profile between any two ingredients is depicted as a link between them. The color of node reflects
ingredient category and thickness of edges is proportional to extent of flavor profile sharing. Node
size is scaled to the ingredient’s contribution to negative food pairing of the cuisine

19

Fig. S3. The backbone of flavor graph of Indian cuisine. Each of the 194 ingredients is depicted
as a node and shared flavor compounds are shown as edges. The size of the node is scaled to the
frequency of use of the ingredient, whereas the thickness of the edge is scaled to number of shared
flavor compounds.

Fig. S4. Flavor sharing within the ingredient category. Intra-category flavor sharing pattern for
10 (of 15) major ingredient categories. The categories are color coded as per the legends in Figure
S2B. (A) Spice, (B) Vegetables, (C) Fruit, (D) Plant derivative, (E) Nut/Seed, (F) Cereal/Crop,
(G) Dairy, (H) Plant, (I) Pulse, (J) Herb

Fig. S5. Ingredient rank profiles of Indian cuisine and controls. (A) Random control when
compared to Indian cuisine. (B) Control with ingredient frequency preserved. (C) Control that
preserved only the ingredient category composition of a recipe. (D) Control in which, both, the
frequency of use of ingredients as well as the category composition were preserved

22

Fig. S6. Role of most frequently used ingredients in the negative food pairing pattern of the
Indian cuisine. Frequency preserved random control with top 10 ranked ingredients swapped
randomly with low-ranked ingredients exhibited food pairing pattern similar to a randomized
cuisine. On the other hand, when poorly ranked ingredients (bottom 39 ingredients; equally
ranked) were subjected to similar random swapping the food pairing was less affected. This
highlighted that high-ranked ingredients are critical in specifying the characteristic profile of
Indian cuisine. The error bars indicate the standard deviation over 10 experiments.
