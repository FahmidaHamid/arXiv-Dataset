This review presents the elastic theory of low-dimensional (one- and two-dimensional) continua
and its applications in bio- and nano-structures.
First, the curve and surface theory, as the geometric representation of the low-dimensional continua, is briefly described through Cartan moving frame method. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff
rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod, fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. The free energy
density of the continua, is constructed on the basis of the symmetry argument. The fundamental
equations can be derived from two kinds of viewpoints: the bottom-up and the top-down standpoints. In the former case, the force and moment balance equations are obtained from Newton’s
laws and then some constitute relations are complemented in terms of the free energy density. In
the latter case, the fundamental equations are derived directly from the variation of the free energy. Although the fundamental equations have different forms obtained from these two viewpoints,
several examples reveal that they are, in fact, equivalent to each other.
Secondly, the application and availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in
bio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes, are discussed.
The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich
rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid membranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. The shape
equation and the stability of closed lipid vesicles, the shape equation and boundary conditions of
open lipid vesicles with free edges as well as vesicles with lipid domains, and the adhesions between
a vesicle and a substrate or another vesicle are fully investigated. A cell membrane is simplified
as a composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little similar to the solid
shell. The equations to describe the in-plane strains and shapes of cell membranes are obtained. It
is found that the membrane skeleton enhances highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes.
Thirdly, the application and availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in nanostructures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A revised Lenosky lattice model
is proposed based on the local density approximation. Its continuum form up to the second order
terms of curvatures and strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. The intrinsic
roughening of graphene and several typical mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited
and investigated based on this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial
concepts, the Young’s modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes, with
this continuum form.

INTRODUCTION

We human beings live in a three-dimensional (3D)
space which contains many geometric entities composed
of atoms or molecules. The length scale of objects observed with our naked eyes is much larger than the distance between nearest neighbor atoms or molecules in
the objects. As a result, the objects can be regarded as
continua. If one dimension of an object is much larger
than the other two dimensions, such as a rod, we call it
a one-dimensional (1D) entity. If one dimension of an
object is much smaller than the other two dimensions,
such as a thin film, we call it a two-dimensional (2D) entity. In this review, the term “low-dimensional continua”
represents 1D and 2D entities.
Elasticity is a property of materials. It means that
materials deform under external forces, but return
to their original shapes when the forces are removed.
Elastic theory, the study on the elasticity of continuum materials, has a long history1,2 which records

many geniuses such as Hooke (1635–1703), Bernoulli
(1700–1782), Euler (1707–1783), Lagrange (1736–1813),
Young (1773–1829), Poisson (1781–1840), Navier
(1785–1836), Cauchy (1789-1857), Green (1793–1841),
Lamé (1795–1870), Saint-Venant (1797–1886), Stokes
(1819–1903), Kirchhoff (1824–1887), and so on. Now
elastic theory has been a mature branch of physics
and summarized in several excellent textbooks.2,3,4
Although the classical elastic theory is applied to
macroscopic continuum materials, more and more facts
reveal that it can be also available for bio- or nanostructures such as short DNA rings,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13

This review presents the elastic theory of lowdimensional continua and its applications in bio- and
nano-structures, which is organized as follows: In Sec. II,

423
we briefly introduce the geometric representation and the
elastic theory of low-dimensional continua including 1D
rod and 2D fluid membrane or solid shell. The free energy density of the continua is constructed on the basis
of the symmetry argument. The fundamental equations
can be derived from the bottom-up and the top-down
viewpoints. Although they have different forms obtained
from these two standpoints, several examples reveal that
they are, in fact, equivalent to each other. In Sec. III, the
application and availability of the elastic theory of lowdimensional continua in bio-structures, including short
DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes, are
discussed. We investigate the kink stability of short DNA
rings, the elasticity of lipid membranes, and the adhesions between a vesicle and a substrate or another vesicle.
A cell membrane is simplified as a composite shell of lipid
bilayer and membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton
is shown to enhance highly the mechanical stability of
cell membranes. In Sec. IV, the application and availability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua
in nano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. We propose a revised Lenosky lattice model and fit four parameters in this model through
the local density approximation. We derive its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures and
strains, which is the same as the free energy of 2D solid
shells. The intrinsic roughening of graphene and several
typical mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are
revisited and investigated by using this continuum form.
Sec. V is a brief summary and prospect.

ELASTIC THEORY ON LOW-DIMENSIONAL

In this section, we describe the mathematical basis and
the elastic theory of 1D and 2D continua.

The 1D continuum (rod) and 2D continuum (membrane or shell) can be expressed as a smooth curve and
a smooth surface, respectively.

Surface theory

Fig. 2 depicts a surface M embedded in the 3D Euclid
space. Imagine that a mass point moves on the surface in
the speed of unit and that a right-handed frame, which
consists of three unit orthonormal vectors with two vectors always in the tangent plane of the surface, adheres
to the mass point. Assume that the mass point is at position expressed as vector r and the frame superposes three
unit orthonormal vectors {e1 , e2 , e3 } with e3 being the
normal vector of surface M at some time s. When the
mass point moves to another position r′ at time s + ∆s,
the frame will superpose three unit orthonormal vectors
{e′1 , e′2 , e′3 }. Thus we call the frame a moving frame and
denote it as {r; e1 , e2 , e3 }.
If ∆s → 0, we define
dr = lim (r′ − r) = ω1 e1 + ω2 e2 ,
∆s→0

Curve theory

Fig. 1 depicts a curve C embedded in the 3D Euclid
space. Each point in the curve can be expressed as a
vector r and let s be the arc length parameter. At point
r(s), one can take T, N, and B as the tangent, normal
and binormal vectors, respectively. {r; T, N, B} is called

where ω1 , ω2 , and ωij , (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are 1-forms, and ‘d’
is the exterior differential operator.48,49 Here ω12 can be
understood as the infinite rotation angle of vectors e1 and
e2 around e3 . Similarly, we can understand the physical
meaning of the other ωij . It is easy to obtain ωij = −ωji

tation matrix of the curvature tensor R. Its trace and
determinant are two invariants under the coordinate rotation around e3 which are denoted by

and K = ac − b2 .

(6)

They can be expressed as 2H = −(1/R1 + 1/R2 ) and
K = 1/R1 R2 by the two principal curvature radii R1
and R2 at each point.
Consider a tangent vector m stemming from r. Let
φ be the angle between m and e1 . Then the geodesic
curvature, the geodesic torsion, and the normal curvature
along the direction of m can be expressed:49

 kg = (dφ + ω12 )/ds,
τg = b cos 2φ + (c − a) cos φ sin φ,


kn = a cos2 φ + 2b cos φ sin φ + c sin2 φ,
where ds is the arc length element along m. If m aligns
with e1 , then φ = 0, kg = ω12 /ds, τg = b, and kn = a.

Elastic theory of 1D continua

We will elucidate the elastic theory of rod with inextensible centerline. As shown in Fig. 3, let us simplify a
rod as a curve r(s) with s being the arc-length parameter,
and cut an infinitesimal element (shown in the magnified
box) from the rod. There are forces and moments at the

r(s)

two ends of the element which originating from the interaction of other parts of the rod. F and M represent
the force and moment vectors at point r(s), while F + dF
and M + dM are the force and moment vectors at point
r(s + ds). From Newton’s laws, we can derive the force
and moment balance equations:
X
F = 0 ⇒ F′ = 0,
(8)
and

M = 0 ⇒ M′ + T × F = 0,

where the prime represents the derivative with respect to
s. One should add the constitutive relation and boundary
conditions to make the above two equations closed.

Kirchhoff rod theory

A rod with rectangle cross section and centerline C is
shown in Fig. 4. Take local coordinates {x1 , x2 , x3 } with
x1 and x2 paralleling respectively to the two edges of the
rectangle, and x3 along the tangent of the centerline. N is
the normal of curve C. Let {x1 , x2 , x3 } denote the basis
of the local coordinates and define κ1 = −x2 · (dx3 /ds),
κ2 = x1 · (dx3 /ds), and κ3 = x2 · (dx1 /ds). Viewed
from geometrical point, κ1 and κ2 describe the bending
of the rod around axes x1 and x3 , respectively, and κ3
represents the twist of the rod around axis x3 . The free
energy density G due to the bending and twist can be
expressed as a function of κ1 , κ2 , and κ3 . Expanding G
up to the second order terms of κ1 , κ2 , and κ3 , we have
G = γ+

k1
k2
k2
(κ1 −κ̄1 )2 + (κ2 −κ̄2 )2 + (κ3 −κ̄3 )2 , (10)

where the constant γ can be interpreted as the line tension. κ̄1 and κ̄2 are interpreted as the spontaneous

425
curvatures while κ̄3 the spontaneous torsion. Denote
k = κ1 x1 + κ2 x2 + κ3 x3 and let φ be the angle between
x1 and N. Then we have

N = cos φ x1 − sin φ x2 ,
(11)
B = sin φ x1 + cos φ x2 ,
where B is the binormal of curve C. From Eqs. (1) and
(11), we can derive50,51
k = κ sin φ x1 + κ cos φ x2 + (τ + φ′ ) x3 .

(12)

Thus G can be also regarded as the function of κ, τ, φ, φ′ .

G = (k0 /2)(κ21 + κ21 ) + γ = (k0 /2)κ2 + γ.

The moment vector is defined as2
(13)

which is called the constitutive relation. Eqs. (8), (9)
and (13) with some boundary conditions form a group of
closed equations. They are also available for the rod with
cross section different from rectangle if only we take x1
and x2 as the two principal axes of inertia. It should be
noted that the equivalent form of these equations can be
also obtained from the variational method. This method
is called the top-down method while the former one via
Newton’s laws called the bottom-up method.
The free energy of a rod with length L can be written
as
Z L
G(κ, τ ; φ, φ′ ) ds + Fbd ,
(14)
F=
0

where Fbd comes from the contributions of two ends of
the rod. The general Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to Eq. (14) are derived as

where F30 is an integral constant which represents the
line tension of the straight (κ = 0) rod. On the other
hand, we have Gκ = k0 κ, Gφ = Gφ′ = Gτ = 0. Eq. (15)
is trivial while Eqs. (16) and (17) are, respectively, transformed into

On the one hand, we have M1 = k0 κ1 = k0 κ sin φ, M2 =
k0 κ2 = k0 κ cos φ, M3 = 0 from Eq. (13). The moment
balance equation (9) implies F1 = −k0 κ1 κ3 − k0 κ′2 and
F2 = k0 κ′1 − k0 κ2 κ3 . Substituting them into the force
balance equation (8), we have F3 = F30 − k0 κ2 /2 and

derivation of Eqs. (15)–(17) is attached in Appendix A.
These equations have been employed to investigate helical and twisted filaments.12 There might be a misprint in
Eq. (7) of Ref. 12, corresponding to our above equation
(17), because the dimension of its last term is different
from that of other terms.
Now we would give a typical example to reveal
the equivalence relation between Eqs. (8),(9), (13) and
Eqs. (15)–(17) rather than prove it directly. Let us consider a rod with k1 = k2 = k0 , k3 = 0, and κ̄1 = κ̄2 =
κ̄3 = 0. The free energy density (10) is simplified as

(16)
= 0,(17)

where Gφ , Gφ′ , Gκ and Gτ are the partial derivatives of
G with respect to φ, φ′ , κ and τ , respectively. Additionally, G′κ ≡ (Gκ )′ , G′τ ≡ (Gτ )′ , G′′κ ≡ (Gκ )′′ . The berief

κ′′ − κτ 2 + κ3 /2 − γκ/k0 = 0,
2τ κ′ + κτ ′ = 0.

(21)
(22)

The above equations are the same as Eqs. (19) and (20)
obtained from the force and moment balance conditions if
only we take F30 = γ. Thus the equations obtained from
the top-down and bottom-up methods are equivalent to
each other.
Substituting the free energy density (10) into
Eqs. (15)–(17), we obtain the so called shape equations
of Kirchhoff rod as
(k1 − k2 )κ2 sin 2φ − 2k3 (τ + φ′ )′ + 2I21 κ = 0, (23)

+2τ [(k1 − k2 )κ sin 2φ + I21 ]φ′ − I12 τ ′ = 0,

(25)

where I1 = k1 sin2 φ + k2 cos2 φ, I¯ = k1 κ̄21 + k2 κ̄22 , I12 =
k1 κ̄1 sin φ + k2 κ̄2 cos φ, and I21 = k2 κ̄2 sin φ − k1 κ̄1 cos φ.
We also suggest that gentle readers consult the work
by Zhou et al.18 where the above equations (23)–(25)
and different kinds of boundary conditions are expressed
in another representation with the aid of Euler angles.

where k2 , k3 , k22 and k4 are elastic constants while γ is
the line tension. It is noted that this free energy density is the simplest stable form including the chirality
term but without spontaneous curvature and torsion. It
has been employed to investigate the circular DNA in
Ref.
R 6 and the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding
to G ds are given as:
k2 (κ3 /2 − κτ 2 + κ′′ ) − γκ
+k3 (3κ3 τ − 2κτ 3 + 6κ′ τ ′ + 2κτ ′′ + 6κ′′ τ )

+k22 (3κ5 /4 − κ3 τ 2 + 6κκ′2 + 3κ2 κ′′ ) = 0, (27)
k2 (2κ′ τ + κτ ′ ) + k22 (κ3 τ ′ + 6κ2 κ′ τ )
+k3 (6κ′ τ 2 + 6κτ τ ′ − 3κ2 κ′ − 2κ′′′ )

−4κ′ τ ′′ − 6κ′′ τ ′ − 4κ′′′ τ − κτ ′′′ ) = 0.

(28)

Here we will not go on the more higher order Helfrich
rod theory, on which gentle readers can consult Refs. 20
and 21.

Theory of bending-soften Rod

There are two kinds of rod theory with bendinginduced softening. First, let us assume that the bending moment depends linearly on the curvature for small
curvature but not on the curvature for large curvature,
which is expressed as

k1 κ, (κ < κc )
M=
(29)
k1 κc , (κ > κc )
where k1 and κc are the elastic bending rigidity and the
critical curvature, respectively. Eq. (29) describes the
bending-induced softening relation of the first kind which
is depicted in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding free energy
density can be expressed as
G = γ + (k1 /2)[κ2 − (κ − κc )2 H(κ − κ0 )],

(30)

where H(.) is the Heaviside step function. The above
form has been employed by Yan et al.
to investigate the loop formation mechanism and probability
of short DNA rings.53 We conjecture that this model
could solve the paradox in the experiment on the ring

closure of single-walled carbon nanotubes with 1,3dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.54 Fitting the experiment data
with the worm-like chain model,55 the persistence length
is 800 nm for single-walled carbon nanotubes in the diameter of 1 nm,54 which is much smaller than the theoretical value 33 µm estimated in terms of the Young’s
modulus and thickness of single-walled carbon nanotubes
in Ref. 44.

Consider a rod divided into two parts at s = Lc : one
part (s < Lc ) has curvatures less than κc another one
larger than κc . In terms of the variational method in
Appendix A, we can derive the equations describing the
rod as
k1 (2κ′′ − 2κτ 2 + κ3 ) − 2γκ = 0 (s < Lc ),
κτ ′ + 2κ′ τ = 0 (s < Lc ),
k1 κc (κc κ − 2τ 2 ) − 2γκ = 0 (s > Lc ),
τ ′ = 0 (s > Lc ).

(31)
(32)
(33)
(34)

At the divided point s = Lc , we have the joint conditions
as
κ− = κ+ = κc ,
κ′− = 0,
τ− = τ+ ,

(35)
(36)
(37)

where (.)− and (.)+ represent the values of (.) at the left
and right sides of s = Lc .
Secondly, let us assume that the bending moment depends linearly on the curvature for small curvature but
weaker linearly on the curvature for large curvature,
which is expressed as

k1 κ, (κ < κc )
M=
(38)
k2 (κ − κc ) + k1 κc , (κ > κc )
where k1 > k2 are the elastic bending rigidities while κc
is the critical curvature. Eq. (38) describes the bendinginduced softening relation of the second kind which is
depicted in Fig. 5(b). The corresponding free energy density can be expressed as
G = γ +(k1 /2)κ2 +[(k2 −k1 )/2](κ−κc)2 H(κ−κ0 ), (39)

427

f

Consider a rod divided into two parts at s = Lc : one
part (s < Lc ) has curvatures less than κc another one
larger than κc . In terms of the variational method in
Appendix A, we can derive the equations describing the
rod as
k1 (2κ′′ − 2κτ 2 + κ3 ) − 2γκ = 0 (s < Lc ),
κτ ′ + 2κ′ τ = 0 (s < Lc ),
2k2 κ′′ + [k2 (κ − κc ) + k1 κc ](κ2 − 2τ 2 ) − 2γκ
+(k2 − k1 )(κ − κc )κκc = 0 (s > Lc ),
k2 (τ ′ κ + 2κ′ τ ) + (k1 − k2 )κc τ ′ = 0 (s > Lc ).

Obviously, the above equations (40)–(47) degenerate
into Eqs. (31)–(37) if k2 = 0 and into Eqs. (21)–(22) if

Elastic theory of 2D continua

C

where ds and dA are the arc length element of curve
C and area element of the region enclosed in curve C,
respectively.
Define two second order tensors S and M such that
S · b = f,

M · b = m.

where S1 = S · e1 and S2 = S · e2 . Since the integral
is performed on the region enclosed in an arbitrary curve
C, from the above two equations we obtain the force and
moment balance conditions of 2D continua as:
div S = pe3 ,
div M = S1 × e1 + S2 × e2 .

A 2D continuum can be simplified as a surface as
shown in Fig. 6. At each point, we can select a frame
{e1 , e2 , e3 }. A pressure p is loaded on the surface in the
inverse direction of the normal vector e3 . Let us cut a
region enclosed in any curve C from the surface. t is the
tangent vector at point of curve C. b is normal to t and
in the tangent plane. The force and moment per length
performed by the other region on curve C are denoted as
f and m, respectively. Through Newton’s laws, the force
and moment balance conditions are obtained as

(51)
Z

The above two equations are equivalent to Eq. (25) in
Ref. 56, and Eqs. (28) and (57) in Ref. 57. Eqs. (53) and
(54) with some complement constitutive relations form
the fundamental equations of 2D continua.

1.

Fluid membranes

A fluid membrane is a 2D isotropic continuum which
cannot withstand in-plane shear strain. Generally, we
assume that the fluid is incompressible. The free energy
density, G, of fluid membranes should be invariant under the in-plane coordinate transformation. In terms of
the surface theory, there are only two fundamental geometric invariants: the mean curvature 2H and gaussian
curvature K. Thus the free energy density should be a
function of 2H and K, that is,
G = G(2H, K).

(55)

The free energy of a closed fluid membrane can be
expressed as
Z
Z
F = G dA + p dV,
(56)
where dA is the area element of the membrane and dV
is the volume element enclosed in the membrane. p is
the osmotic pressure, the pressure difference between the
outer and inner side of the membrane. The general EulerLagrange equation of free energy (56) can be derived

428
through the variational method shown in Appendix B
as
p − 2HG + (∇2 /2 + 2H 2 − K)(∂G/∂H)
˜ + 2KH)(∂G/∂K) = 0. (57)
+(∇ · ∇
As we known, the above equation has been derived by
several authors such as Ou-Yang et al.49,58 and Giaquinta
et al.59 coming from different research fields. It is recently employed to investigate the modified Korteweg-de
˜ can be called as the Laplace
Vries surfaces.60 Here ∇ · ∇
operator of the second class which is also fully discussed
by Zhang and Xu.61
We emphasize that (57) can be also derived from the
bottom-up method, Eqs. (53) and (54) combining a complement constitutive relation
M = (Gb /2)(e1 e1 − e2 e2 ) − Ga e2 e1 + Gc e1 e2 ,

(58)

where Ga , Gb , and Gc represent the partial derivatives of
G with respect to a, b, and c, respectively. Here a, b, and
c are the components of the curvature tensor R in Eq. (5).
To illuminate this point, we consider an example in which
the free energy density is taken as G = kc (2H)2 +λ, where
kc and λ are the bending modulus and surface tension of
the fluid membrane. It follows that M = 2kc H(e1 e2 −
e2 e1 ) from Eq. (58). Substituting it into Eqs. (53) and
(54), we can derive
p − 2λH + 4kc H(H 2 − K) + 2kc ∇2 H = 0,

(59)

which is the same as the result obtained directly from
(57). Simultaneously, we have the stress components
S1 = (2H 2 − 2aH + λ)e1 − 2bHe2 − 2H1 e3 , (60)
S2 = −2bHe1 + (2H 2 − 2cH + λ)e2 − 2H2 e3 , (61)
where H1 and H2 are the directional derivatives of H
respect to e1 and e2 . These equations have been also derived by Capovilla and Guven,57 from which we seem to
arrive at a paradox for fluid membranes: we have mentioned that fluid membranes cannot withstand in-plane
shear strain, however Eqs. (60) and (61) reveals shear
stress still exhibits in non-spherical vesicles.
2.

Solid shells

A solid shell is a 2D isotropic continuum which can
endure both bending and in-plane shear strain. The free
energy density, G, of solid shells should be invariant under the in-plane coordinate transformation. There are
only two fundamental geometric invariants, 2H and K,
and two fundamental strain invariants: the trace, 2J, and
the determinate, Q, of the in-plane strain tensor. Thus
free energy density should be a function of 2H, K, 2J,
and Q. That is, G = G(2H, K; 2J, Q).
If the solid shell has no initial strains and consists of
materials distributing symmetrically with regard to the

middle surface of the shell, we can expand G up to the
second order terms of curvatures and strains as
G = (kc /2)(2H)2 − k̄K + (kd /2)(2J)2 − k̃Q,

(62)

where kc and k̄ are the bending moduli while kd and k̃
are the in-plane rigidity moduli. The theory based on the
above free energy density is called Kirchhoff’s linear shell
theory.2 Especially, if the shell consists of 3D isotropic
materials, we have
kc = Y h3 /12(1 − ν 2 ),
kd = Y h/(1 − ν 2 ),

k̄/kc = k̃/kd = (1 − ν),

(63)
(64)
(65)

where Y and ν are the Young’s modulus and Poisson
ratio while h is the thickness of the shell.3
For a closed shell, its free energy is expressed as
Eq. (56) with G in Eq. (62). Of course, we can obtain
the equations of in-plane strains and shapes through the
variational method in Appendix B. The final results are
the same as those obtained from Eqs. (53) and (54) with
a complement constitutive relations (58) and
S = Si + Sf

(66)

with
Si ≡ Gε11 e1 e1 +(Gε12 /2)(e1 e2 +e2 e1 )+Gε22 e2 e2 , (67)
where Gε11 , Gε12 , and Gε22 represent the partial derivatives of G with respect to ε11 , ε12 , and ε22 , the components of the in-plane strain tensor E. Substituting
Eq. (62) into Eqs. (58) and (67), and then employing
Eqs. (53) and (54), we obtain
d(Si11 ω2 − Si12 ω1 ) − (Si21 ω2 − Si22 ω1 ) ∧ ω21 = 0, (68)
d(Si21 ω2 − Si22 ω1 ) − (Si11 ω2 − Si12 ω1 ) ∧ ω12 = 0, (69)
and
p+2kc [2H(H 2 −K)+∇2 H]−4(kd − k̃)JH − k̃R : E = 0, (70)

where Si11 = (2kd J − k̃ε22 ), Si12 = Si21 = k̃ε12 , and
Si22 = (2kd J − k̃ε11 ) are the components of tensor Si . R
is the curvature tensor related to Eq. (5). The above
equations (68)–(70) describe the in-plane strains and
shapes of solid shells at equilibrium state. The similar equations and the corresponding dynamics forms
have been derived through the variational method in
Refs. 49 and 62, respectively, with the aid of moving
frame method.
The above equations (68) and (69) can be written as
one vector equation by introducing a displacement vector
u = u1 e1 +u2 e2 +u3 e3 , which is related to two invariants
2J and Q of the in-plane strain tensor as
2J = div u − 2Hu3
(71)
2
2
2
2Q = (div u − 2Hu3 ) + (1/2)(curl u) − (♦u) , (72)

429
where ♦u = ∇u − e3 (e3 · ∇u) is the in-plane part of ∇u.
Using the new variable u, Eqs. (68) and (69) can be be
written as
˜ 3 ) = 0, (73)
(k̃−2kd )∇(div u−2Hu3 )−k̃(♦2 u+K ū+∇u
where ū and ♦2 u are the in-plane components of u and
˜ is called the gradient operadiv (♦u), respectively. ∇
tor of the second class, which is shown in our previous
˜ 3 vanish and ♦2 degenwork.49 In particular, H, K, ∇u
2
erates into ∇ for a flat manifold. Then the above equation degenerates into the Cauchy equation2 in 2D plane.
Thus Eq. (73) can be regarded as the Cauchy equation
in a curved surface.
III.

APPLICATION OF ELASTIC THEORY IN
BIO-STRUCTURES

In the above section, we have described fundamentals
of geometric and elastic theory on low-dimensional continua. Can this theory be applied to the bio-structures,
such as DNA and cell membranes, and so on? DNA is a
long chain macromolecule which may be described as an
elastic rod. A cell membrane is a thin structure whose
thickness and the size of the microscopic components are
so much smaller than its lateral dimension that it can
be regarded as a 2D continuum phenomenologically. We
will discuss the application of the above elastic theory in
short DNA rings, lipid membranes and cell membranes
in this section.
A.

kink deformations were observed in DNA rings of 168
bp but not 126 bp. Above some thresholds of the chiral modulus, k3 in Eq. (26), the DNA circles turn into
elliptical, triangular, square, or other polygonal shapes,
respectively. This fact agrees with the experiments if k3
is positively correlated to the condensation of Zn2+ ions.
Interestingly, Zhou and Ou-Yang proposed another interpretation based on the dynamic instability of Kirchhoff rod theory8 with κ̄2 = κ̄3 = 0 in Eq. (10). Their
result is the same as that obtained directly from the first
and second order variations of the free energy. We deal
with the latter scenario. First, τ = 0, φ = 0, and κ = 1/R
satisfy Eqs. (23)–(25) derived from the first order variation of the free energy. That is, a planar circle with
radius R is an equilibrium configuration. Next, through
the second order variation of the free energy, we can obtain the characteristic function describing the stability of
the circle
gc (R) = κ̄21 − (1 − Γ)κ̄1 /R − Γn2 /R2 ≤ 0

(74)

where n > 1 is an arbitrary integer and Γ = k3 /k1 . From
the above inequality, we obtain the critical radius
p
(75)
Rc = 8Γ/κ̄1 [Γ − 1 + (Γ − 1)2 + 16Γ],

above which the circle is instable. If only the presence of
Zn2+ ions tunes the values of Γ and k3 /k2 such that Rc is
in the range between 63/π (bp) and 84/π (bp), the above
result is also in agreement with the experiments,65,66
where kink deformations were observed in DNA rings of
168 bp but not 126 bp.

Short DNA ring

DNA is a double helical structure whose diameter is
about 2.5 nm. Its bending rigidity, described as the persistence length lp , is about 50 nm (150 bp) at the room
temperature. The normal DNA is usually flexible enough
because its length is so much larger than lp that the fluctuations are quite evident. Thus the rod theory cannot
directly be applied to the normal DNA. The statistical
theory combining the rod theory is required,63,64 which
is out of our topic in this review. However, there is a
special kind of short DNA rings65,66,67 which are in the
length scale of lp so that the fluctuation effect can be
neglected. The diameter is still much smaller than the
total length. Thus the rod theory mentioned in Sec. II B
is expected to be available for this kind of DNA rings.
Han et al. have used AFM to observe DNA rings consisting of several segments connected by kinks in the presence of Zn2+ ions.65,66 Zhao et al. have analyzed the
mechanism of this kink instability based on Helfrich rod
theory.6 Their main ideas are sketched as follows. First,
a circle is a solution to Eqs. (27) and (28). Next, through
analyzing the stability of the cycle, it is found that, for
the given elastic constants, there exists a critical radius
above which DNA circles will be instable. This prediction
is in good agreement with the experiments,65,66 where

FIG. 7: A possible configuration of a short DNA ring.

In Sec. II B, we also mention the theory of bendingsoften rod. Can this theory also provide an interpretation
to the experiments? Let us consider the bending-soften
rod theory of the first kind whose free energy density is
expressed as Eq. (30). When the radius R of the ring is
smaller than 1/κc, any small perturbation will increase
the free energy. If R > 1/κc , the ring might transform
into the fictitious configuration shown in Fig. 7 which
consists of four arcs AB, BC, CD, DA with the radius R1
and R2 . To see conveniently, the joint points are marked
as small cycles in the figure. Obviously, R2 < R < R1 .

430
Through simple calculations, we find that the fictitious
configuration is energetically less favorable than the perfect ring with radius R. Therefore, this coarse analysis
reveals that the theory of bending-soften rod cannot explain the experiments.
B.

Lipid membrane

Lipids are dominant composition of cell membranes.
Most of lipid molecules have a polar hydrophilic head
group and two hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. When a
quantity of lipid molecules disperse in water, they will
assemble themselves into a bilayer vesicle as depicted
in Fig. 8, in which the hydrophilic heads shield the hydrophobic tails from the water surroundings because of
the hydrophobic forces. This self-assembly process has
been numerically investigated by Lipowsky et al.68,69,70
and Noguchi et al.71 through molecular dynamics simulation based on coarse-grained model or meshless membrane model.

Water

and T the room temperature, from which the persistence
length of lipid bilayers is estimated about 10 µm.32,33
In this section we only consider the size of lipid bilayers
smaller than 10 µm so that the fluctuation effect on the
shape of lipid bilayers can be neglected. The model based
on Eq. (76) is called spontaneous curvature model. We
still remind gentle readers to note the two similar nonlocal models— the bilayer-coupling model72,73 and the
area difference model,74 although we will not touch them
in the present review.

1.

Closed vesicles

The free energy of a lipid vesicle under the osmotic
pressure p (the outer pressure minus the inner one) can
be written as Eq. (56) with G = GH being Helfrich’s
form (76). Substituting (76) into Eq. (57), we can obtain
the shape equation of lipid vesicles:75,76
p−2λH +kc (2H +c0 )(2H 2 −c0 H −2K)+2kc ∇2 H = 0. (77)

This equation is the fourth order nonlinear equation. It
is not easy to find its special solutions. We have known
three typical analytical solutions: sphere,75 torus,77,78
and biconcave discoid shape.79
For a sphere with radius R, we have H = −1/R and
K = 1/R2 . Substituting them into (77), we arrive at

pR2 + 2λR − kc c0 (2 − c0 R) = 0.

FIG. 8: A lipid bilayer vesicle.

The thickness of the lipid bilayer and the size of single
lipid molecules are much smaller than the scale of the
whole lipid bilayer. Additionally, at the physiological
temperature, the lipid bilayer is usually at the nematic
state where the hydrocarbon chains of the lipid molecules
are roughly perpendicular to the bilayer surface. Thus
the bilayer can be regarded as a 2D fluid membrane whose
free energy density is expressed as Eq. (55). Expanding
it up to the second order terms of curvatures, we obtain
the Helfrich’s form:29
GH = (kc /2)(2H + c0 )2 − k̄K + λ,

(76)

where kc and k̄ are the bending moduli of the lipid bilayer. We emphasize that the minus sign before k̄ in
Eq. (76) is opposite to Helfrich’s convention. λ is the
surface tension of the bilayer. c0 is called the spontaneous curvature that reflects asymmetric factors between
two sides of the bilayer, including the lipid distribution,
the chemical environment, and so on. kc is about 20 T
for lipid bilayers, where the Boltzmann factor is set to 1

(78)

This equation gives the sphere radius under the osmotic
pressure p.
A torus is a revolution surface generated by a circle
with radius ρ rotating around an axis in the same plane
of the circle. The revolution radius r should be larger
than ρ. A point in the torus can be expressed as a vector
{(r + ρ cos ϕ) cos θ, (r + ρ cos ϕ) sin θ, ρ sin ϕ}. Through
simple calculations, we have 2H = −(r + 2ρ cos ϕ)/ρ(r +
ρ cos ϕ), K = cos ϕ/ρ(r + ρ cos ϕ). Substituting them
into Eq. (77), we derive
[(2kc c20 ρ2 − 4kc c0 ρ + 4λρ2 + 2P ρ3 )/̺3 ] cos3 ϕ
+[(5kc c20 ρ2 − 8kc c0 ρ + 10λρ2 + 6P ρ3 )/̺2 ] cos2 ϕ
+[(4kc c20 ρ2 − 4kc c0 ρ + 8λρ2 + 6P ρ3 )/̺] cos ϕ
+2kc /̺2 + kc (c20 ρ2 − 1) + 2(P ρ + λ)ρ2 = 0,
(79)
where ̺ = r/ρ. If ̺ is finite, then Eq. (79) holds if and
only if the coefficients of {1, cos ϕ, cos2 ϕ, cos3 ϕ} vanish.

It follows
√ 77 2λρ = kc c0 ρ(4 − c0 ρ), P ρ = −2kc ρc0 and
̺ = 2. That is, there exists a√lipid torus with the ratio
of its two generated radii being 2, which was confirmed
in the experiment 80.
To describe the solution of biconcave discoid shape, we
write the shape equation (77) under the axisymmetric
condition. If a planar curve z = z(ρ) revolves around the
z-axis, an axisymmetric surface is formed. Each point
on the surface is expressed as r = {ρ cos ϕ, ρ sin ϕ, z(ρ)}.

It is easy to verify that Ψ = sin ψ = −c0 ρ ln(ρ/ρB )

corresponds to a curve shown in Fig. 9. A biconcave
discoid surface will be achieved when this curve revolves
around z-axis and then reflects concerning the horizontal
plane. The above equation (81) can give a good explanation to the shape of human red blood cell under normal
physiological conditions.79 If c0 ρB is out of the range between 0 and e, Eq. (81) corresponds to a prolate ellipsoid
or other self-intersecting surfaces.86
In the purely mathematical viewpoint, there are also
the other solutions to Eq. (77) such as cylinder, constant
mean curvature surface, periodic undulation surface,87
pearling tubule,88 and so on.34,89 However, It is a pity
that they are open surfaces and do not correspond to
truly closed vesicles.
As mentioned above, it is fairly difficult to find the
analytical solution to Eq. (77). Thus we appreciate the
applications of numerical methods to find the equilibrium shapes of closed vesicles. Two kinds of typical
numerical frameworks are usually employed. The first
one is to use ‘Surface Evolver’, a software package developed by Brakke,90 to find the configurations minimizing the free energy under some constraints.91,92,93,94 The
second one is based on the phase field formulation of
Helfrich’s free energy density (76) and diffusive interface
approximation.95,96,97,98 The above numerical methods

can obtain lipid vesicles with different shapes either axisymmetric or asymmetric. Additionally, the finite element method might be a potential method although very
sparse literature99 treats lipid bilayers by using it.
2.

Stability of closed vesicles

When the osmotic pressure is beyond some threshold,
a closed vesicle will lose its stability and change its shape
abruptly. The threshold is called the critical pressure. To
obtain it, one should calculate the second order variation
of the free energy (56) with G being Helfrich’s form (76),
which has been dealt with in the general case as:49,100

class.
Here we will mention two results for special configurations.
First, let us consider a lipid sphere that satisfies
Eq. (78). On the sphere, the function Ω3 can be expanded by the spherical harmonic functions Ylm as Ω3 =
P∞ Pm=l
Substituting it into Eq. (82), we
l=0

derive δ F = (R/2) l,m |alm |2 [l(l + 1) − 2]{2kc[l(l +

pressure75
pc = 2kc (6 − c0 R)/R3 .

(83)

If p < pc , δ 2 F ≥ 0 for any |alm |; on the contrary, δ 2 F
can be negative for the special selection of |alm |. The
above equation depends also on c0 . If c0 > 6/R, then pc
is negative, which reveals that a sphere vesicle is always
instable for large enough c0 .
Next, let us still regard a long enough lipid tubule as
a closed vesicle. Denoted its radius as ρ. From Eq. (77)
we have
(kc /2)(1/ρ2 − c20 ) − pρ = λ.

(84)

On the cylindrical

Open vesicles with free edges

The opening-up process of lipid vesicles by talin, a protein, has recently been observed101,102 which pushes us
to study the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions of lipid vesicles with free exposed edges. Capovilla
et al. have addressed this problem and given the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions.103 Inspired
by the talk “moving frame method” of Chern,104 we introduce exterior differential form to deal with the variational problem on open surface and obtain concisely the
shape equation and boundary conditions of open lipid
vesicles.105 Numerical solution to the shape equation and
boundary conditions with relaxed method can explain
the experimental results very well.106 A quantity of open
vesicles with free edges have also been obtained numerically by Wang and Du107 with the phase field method.
Here we will not further discussed the dynamical opening
process of the vesicles, which has been recently investigated by Kaga and Ohta.108

are as follows: Eq. (87) is the normal force balance equation of the membrane; Eq. (88) is the moment balance
equation of points in curve C around the direction of t;
Eq. (89) is the force balance equation of points in curve
C along the normal direction of surface; and Eq. (90)
is the force balance equation of points in curve C along
the direction of b. It is necessary to emphasize that the
boundary conditions are available for open vesicles with
more than one free edge because the edge in our derivation is a general one.
In Ref. 105, we have shown two analytical solutions to
above equations (87)–(90): One is a cup-like membrane
and another is the central part of a torus. Several numerical solutions to these equations are obtained by Umeda et
al.106 . Their results reveal that the line tension γ induced
by talin correlates negatively with the concentration of
talin, which is in agreement with the experimental result
that the hole of vesicle is enlarged with the concentration
of talin.101

Vesicles with lipid domains

(90)

The above discussion on open lipid vesicles with free
edges can be extended to study a vesicle of several lipid
components. The domains usually formed so that each
domain contains one or two kinds of lipid molecules.
The morphology of axisymmetric vesicles with multidomains has been theoretically investigated by Jülicher
and Lipowsky.109 It is found that lipid domains facilitate
the budding of vesicles.110 The giant vesicles with lipid
domains have been observed in recent experiment.111
There are two kinds of lipid domains which are at the
liquid-ordered state and liquid-disordered state, respectively. It is natural to assume that different kinds of
domains have different bending moduli and spontaneous
curvatures. The axisymmetric vesicles in the experiment
can be explained with Jülicher-Lipowsky theory through
numerically method. Baumgart et al. have demonstrated
that the line tension, the osmotic pressure, the relative
bending moduli, and the spontaneous curvature have
significant effects on the morphology of a vesicle with
two domains being at the liquid-ordered and disordered
states, respectively.112
The asymmetric vesicles are also experimentally observed in Ref. 111, which enlightens us to investigate the
shape equation of each domains and the boundary conditions between domains without any axisymmetric assumptions. Let us consider a vesicle with two domains
separated by curve C sketched in Fig. 11. The free energy

As we know, there is still no any numerical result on
asymmetric vesicles with domains directly from the above
equations in the previous literature. Only in Ref. 107,
Wang and Du discussed the morphology of asymmetric
vesicles with domains through the phase field model.
In the above theory, the detailed architecture of liquidordered and disordered phases is neglected. There
are special lipid domains at liquid-ordered phase, so
called rafts, which are enriched in cholesterol and
sphingolipids.114 Cholesterol is a kind of chiral molecules,
which has not been included in the above theory. Recently, a concise theory of chiral lipid membranes developed by Tu and Seifert115 might be extended to discuss
the raft domains.

Adhesions of Vesicles

Cell adhesion is a complex biological process which
controls many functions of life. It can be understood as
a first-order wetting transition116 and might be simplified as the adhesion of lipid vesicles. As a model, Seifert
and Lipowsky have theoretically investigated a lipid vesicle adhering to a flat rigid substrate and found that the
vesicle undergoes a nontrivial adhesion transition from
the free state to the bound state, which is governed

The adhesion between a lipid vesicle and a rigid substrate is depicted in Fig. 12a where the contact area is
denoted by Ā. The free energy of this system is expressed
as117
Z
Z
F = GH dA + p dV − W Ā,
(96)
where p is the osmotic pressure of the vesicle and W is the
strength of the adhesion potential between the vesicle and
the substrate. GH is the free energy density of Helfrich’s
form (76). For the flat rigid substrate, a characteristic
radius p
and the length scalepof the vesicle are defined as
Ra = 2kc /W and R = A/4π, respectively. If R <
Ra , the vesicle is a little stiffer or the attraction is relative
weak such that Ā approaches to zero. Thus the vesicle
is unbound to the substrate and this state is called the
free state. On the contrary, the vesicle is at the bound
state. At this state, let us take t as the tangent vector
of the contact line C, and b perpendicular to t and in
the common tangent plane of the lipid vesicle and the
substrate. The absolute value of the normal curvature
along b for the point on the contact line is proven to be
p
2W/kc for an axisymmetric vesicle adhering to the flat
substrate.117 If the rigid substrate is curved, the above
conclusion is revised as121

where κVb and κSb are the normal curvatures along b for
the points outside but near the contact line, calculated
by using the surfaces of the vesicle and the substrate,
respectively.

to the above equations (99)–(101) in the previous literature. Only in the recent work, Ziherl and Svetina122 have
investigated the adhesion between two vesicles by numerically minimizing the free energy (98) with kcII = kcI and
various W .
Is the behavior of vesicle adhesion close to that of
cell adhesion? The cell membrane can bear shear strain
whose adhesion behavior might be much closer to the
adhesion between a polyelectrolyte microcapsule and the
substrate.123 Interestingly, beyond the threshold adhesion strength Wc , the contact length scale increases in
proportion to (W − Wc )1/2 , which is the same as the behavior of vesicle adhesions except the coefficient before
(W − Wc )1/2 .

A different viewpoint of surface tension

Although the lipid bilayer cannot withstand the inplane shear strain, it can still endure the in-plane compression strain. The in-plane compression modulus, kb ,
of lipid bilayers is about 0.24 N/m.124 Considering this
point, we may write the free energy of a closed lipid vesicle as
Z
Z
Z
F = p dV + GB dA + (kb /2)(2Jb )2 dA, (102)
where
GB = (kc /2)(2H + c0 )2 − k̄K,

(103)

and Jb is the in-plane compression or stretch strain. We
emphasize that the contribution of chemical potential are
omitted when we write the above free energy.

The first order variation of the free energy (102) reveals
that 2Jb is a constant and then
p − 2(2kb Jb )H + 2kc ∇2 H
+kc (2H + c0 )(2H 2 − c0 H − 2K) = 0. (104)
Comparing the above equation with the shape equation
(77) of lipid vesicles, we deduce that
λ = 2kb Jb .

(105)

In the discussion on the stability of closed lipid vesicles,
we have seen that the surface tensor λ has no effect on the
critical pressure. The second order variation of the

Cell membrane

Cell membrane consists of lipids, proteins, and a small
quantity of carbohydrates and so on. A simple but
widely accepted model for cell membranes is the fluid
mosaic model125 proposed by Singer and Nicolson in
1972. In this model, the cell membrane is considered
as a lipid bilayer where the lipid molecules can move
freely in the membrane surface like fluid, while the proteins are embedded in the lipid bilayer. Some proteins, so called integral membrane proteins, traverse entirely in the lipid bilayer and play the role of information and matter communications between the interior
of the cell and its outer environment. The others, so
called peripheral membrane proteins, are partially embedded in the bilayer and accomplish the other biological functions. Beneath the lipid membrane, the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins, links with the proteins embedded in the lipid membrane. Mature mammalian and human erythrocytes (i.e., red blood cells)
are lack of a cell nucleus. Thus they provide a good
experimental model for studying the mechanical properties of cell membranes.126,127,128,129 On the theoretical side, spontaneous curvature model,29 rubber membrane model,30,130,131 and dual network model132 have
been employed to investigate the mechanical and thermal
fluctuation properties of erythrocyte membranes. We
will address the elasticity and stability of composite shell
model for cell membranes in this section.

435
1.

Composite shell model of cell membranes

A cell membrane can be simplified as a composite
shell133 of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton. The
membrane skeleton, inside of the cell membrane, is a
network of protein filaments as shown in Fig. 13. The
joint points of the network are bulk proteins embedded
in the lipid bilayer. The whole membrane skeleton seems
to float the sea of the lipid bilayer. It can have a global
movement along the surface of the bilayer but the movement of the joints along the normal direction is totally
coupling with the bilayer. In the mechanical point of
view, the lipid bilayer can endure the bending deformation but hardly bear the in-plane shear strain. On the
contrary, the membrane skeleton can endure the in-plane
shear strain but hardly bear the bending deformation.
The composite shell overcomes the shortage of the lipid
bilayer and the membrane skeleton. It can sustain both
bending deformation and in-plane shear strain.

Similarly to Sec. II C, if we define a displacement vector u satisfying Eqs. (71) and (72), we can derive the
Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the free energy (108) as
˜ 3 ) = 0,

FIG. 13: Local schematic picture of the composite shell model
for a cell membrane.

The contour length of protein chain between joints
in the membrane skeleton is about 100 nm which is
much smaller than the size (∼ 10 µm) of cell membranes. The lipid bilayer is 2D homogenous. The membrane skeleton is roughly a 2D locally hexagonal lattice. As is well known, the mechanical property of a
2D hexagonal lattice is 2D isotropic.134 Thus the composite shell of the lipid bilayer plus the membrane skeleton can still be regarded as a 2D isotropic continuum.
Its free energy density should be invariant under the inplane coordinate transformation and can be written as
Gcm = Gcm (2H, K; 2J, Q). We can expand Gcm up to
the second order terms of curvatures and strains as
Gcm = GB + (kb /2)(2Jb )2 + Gsk ,

are the compression and shear moduli of the membrane
skeleton, respectively. Their values are experimentally
determined as kd = k̃ = 4.8 µN/m.129,135 2J and Q are
the trace and determinant of the stain tensor of the membrane skeleton. Because there is no in-plane coupling between the lipid bilayer and the membrane skeleton in the
composite shell model, thus Jb for the lipid bilayer and J
for the membrane skeleton have no local correlation. In
the above subsection, we have mentioned that the effect
of (kb /2)(2Jb )2 can be replaced with the surface tension
λ = 2kb Jb . Considering a closed cell membrane under
osmotic pressure p, the free energy can be written as
Z
Z
F = Gcm dA + p dV.
(108)

(107)

where GB results mainly from the bending energy of
the lipid bilayer, which has the form as Eq. (103).
(kb /2)(2Jb )2 is the contribution of in-plane compression
of the lipid bilayer where kb and 2Jb are the compression modulus and relative area compression of the lipid
bilayer. Gsk = (kd /2)(2J)2 − k̃Q is the in-plane compression and shear energy density which comes from the
entropic elasticity of the membrane skeleton. kd and k̃

class, which is shown in our previous work.49
Generally speaking, it is difficult to find the analytical
solutions to Eqs. (109) and (110). But we can verify that
a spherical membrane with homogenous in-plane strains
satisfy these equations. The radius R and the homogenous in-plane strain ε should obey the following relation:
pR2 + 2(λ + 2kd ε − k̃ε)R + kc c0 (c0 R − 2) = 0.

Stability of cell membranes and the function of
membrane skeleton

When the osmotic pressure is beyond some threshold,
a closed cell membrane will lose its stability and change
its shape abruptly. The threshold is called the critical
pressure. To obtain it, one should calculate the second
order variation of the free energy (108) in terms of Appendix B. The variational result is

be expressed by two scalar functions Ω and χ as

(113)

where ∗ is the Hodge star.49,136 Then we have div v =

As a byproduct, Eq. (118) also gives the critical pressure

(119)

for a spherical thin solid shell of 3D isotropic materials if
we take kc , kd , and k̃ as Eqs. (63)–(65). This formula is
the same as the classic strict result obtained by Pogorelov
from the other method.138
IV.

APPLICATION OF ELASTIC THEORY IN
NANO-STRUCTURES

In the last section, we have expatiated on the application of Elastic theory in bio-structures. In this section, we
will discuss whether and to what extent this theory can
be applied to nano-structures, especially the graphitic
structures, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.

(a)

It is easy to verify that δ 2 F1 is always positive on a
spherical surface. Then the stability of the spherical cell
membrane is merely determined by δ 2 F2 . By analogy
with our previous work,137 we can prove that δ 2 F2 is
also positive if

for any integer l ≥ 2. Thus the critical pressure is
pc ≡ min{pl (l = 2, 3, 4, · · ·)}.

(117)

Obviously, if k̃ = 0, i.e., the effect of membrane skeleton
vanishes in the cell membrane, pc degenerates into the
critical pressure (83) of a spherical lipid vesicle.
When k̃kd (2kd − k̃)R2 /kc (6kd − k̃)2 > 1, the critical
pressure is derived from Eqs. (116) and (117) as
q
(118)
pc = (4/R2 ) (k̃/kd )(2kd − k̃)kc .
As an example, let us consider a cell membrane with
typical values of k̃ = kd = 4.8 µN/m,129 kc = 10−19 J,
and R ≈ 10 µm. Through a simply manipulation, we find
that k̃kd (2kd − k̃)R2 /kc (6kd − k̃)2 ≫ 1, and so Eq. (118)
holds, from which we obtain the critical pressure pc =
0.03 Pa. However, if the membrane skeleton vanishes,
k̃ = 0, we calculate pc = 0.001 Pa from Eqs. (116) and
(117). This example reveals a mechanical function of

FIG. 14: (a) Graphene. (b) Single-walled carbon nanotube.

A.

Graphene

Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms with a
2D honeycomb lattice as shown in Fig. 14a. It has
been a rapidly rising star in the material science and

437
condensed-matter physics139 since it was successfully
cleaved from buck graphite.140 It is found that the freestanding graphene might be a strictly 2D atomic crystal
which is stable under ambient conditions.141 However,
Mermin has theoretically proved that the 2D crystalline
order could not exist at finite temperature.142 There are
two possible ways to solve this paradox: (i) The graphene
might not be a perfect 2D crystal. Recently, Meyer
et al. have investigated the elaborate structure of suspended graphene sheets and found that the graphene
sheets are not genuine flat.143 They also argue that the
graphene sheets could be stabilized by the out-of-plane
deformation in the third dimension resulting from the
the thermal fluctuations.143 Fasolino et al. have also addressed the height fluctuations by means of Monte Carlo
simulations.144 Their result at room temperature is in
good agreement with the experiment mentioned above.
(ii) Mermin theorem is valid for power-law potentials of
the Lennard-Jones type while the interaction between
nearest neighbor atoms (covalent bond) in the graphene
might not be of this type.145
To fully understand the experimental result and possible stable mechanism in theory, we will address the
Lenosky lattice model146 and its revised form as follows.
1.

Revised Lenosky lattice model and its continuum limit

We start from the concise formula proposed by
Lenosky et al. in 1992 to describe the deformation energy
of a single layer of curved graphite146

The first two terms are the contributions of bond length
and bond angle changes to the energy. The last two terms
are the contributions from the π-electron resonance. In
the first term, r0 is the initial bond length of planar
graphite, and rij is the bond length between atoms i and
j after the deformations. In the remaining terms, uij is
a unit vector pointing from atom i to its neighbor j, and
ni is the unit vector normal to the plane determined
P by
the three neighbors of atom i. The summation (j) is
taken over
P the three nearest neighbor atoms j to atom
i, and (ij) taken over all the nearest neighbor atoms.
The parameters (ǫ1 , ǫ2 , ǫ3 ) = (0.96, 1.29, 0.05) eV were
determined by Lenosky et al.146 through local density
approximation. The value of ǫ0 was given by Zhou et al.
as ǫ0 = 57 eV/Å2 through the force-constant method.147
In the above energy form, the second term requires
that the energy cost due to in-plane bond angle changes is
the same as that due to out-of-plane bond angle changes.
However, the experiment by inelastic neutron scattering
techniques reveals that the energy costs due to in-plane
and out-of plane bond angle changes are quite different

from each other.148 To describe this effect, we revise the
Lenosky lattice model as

where utij = uij − (ni · uij )ni and unij = ni · uij .
If the three nearest neighbor atoms
to atom i are laP
beled as 1,2,3, the summation (j<k) is understood as
P
1≤j<k≤3 . The second and third terms of Eq. (121) represent the energy costs due to in-plane and out-of-plane
bond angle
P changes, respectively. We have omitted the
term ǫ3 (ij) (ni · uij )(nj · uji ) relative to the original
Lenosky model (120), because its contribution is very
small in terms of the results by Lenosky et al..
The parameters in Eq. (121) are determined by fitting
the
√ total
√ energy of variously perturbed configurations of
7× 7 unit cell of graphite (14 atoms). The total energy
is obtained through the first-principles calculations (the
ABINIT package149 ). The calculations are carried by
taking Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials,150 plane-wave
energy cutoff of 50 Hartree, and 4×4×1 Monkhorst-Pack
k-points151 in Brillouin-zone. The exchange-correlation
energy are treated within the local-density approximation in the Ceperley-Alder form152 with the PerdewWang parametrization.153 Our result is r0 = 1.41 Å,
ǫ0 = 46.34 eV/Å2 , ǫ1t = 4.48 eV, ǫ1n = 1.04 eV, and
ǫ2 = 1.24 eV. The value of ǫ0 is a little smaller than that
obtained by Zhou et al.147 from force constant method.
The values of ǫ1n and ǫ2 are very close to those of ǫ1
and ǫ2 obtained by Lenosky et al.146 from local density
approximation. The key reason is that the main energy
contribution in the configurations discussed by Lenosky
et al. comes from the third and fourth term in Eq. (121).
Now let us derive the continuum limit form of the revised Lenosky lattice model (121) by analogy with the
method in our previous work.42,44 Now consider a curved
graphene and take a fictitious smooth surface such that
all carbon atoms are on that surface.
The

 in-plane
ε11 ε12
stain can be expressed as Ei =
in the loε12 ε22
cal frame {e1 , e2 , e3 } at atom i. The bond vector rij
from atom i to its neighbor j after the deformations and
the initial bond vector r0ij before the deformations satisfy
rij = (I + Ei ) · r0ij , where I is the unit matrix. The initial
bond vectors r0ij can be expanded to the order of O(r02 κ2 )
as47
r0ij = (1 − r02 κ2j /6)r0 Tj + (κj τj r03 /6)Bj
+[r0 κj /2 + (r02 /6)dκj /ds]r0 Nj ,

(122)

where j=1, 2, 3 denote three sp2 -bond curves from atom
i to one of its three neighbor atoms j on the graphene surface. The symbols Tj , Nj , and Bj represent the unit tangential, normal, and binormal vectors of the bond curve

438
from i-atom to j-atom, which satisfy the Frenent theorem
Eq. (1). κ, τ refer to the curvature and torsion while s is
the arc-length parameter along the bond curve. Assume
the sp2 -bond along the geodesic curve of the graphene
surface. The vectors Tj and Bj can be expressed by
Tj = cos θj e1 + sin θj e2 and Bj = − sin θj e1 + cos θj e2 ,
where θj is the rotating angle from e1 to Tj . We have the
expressions of uij = rij /rij and ni = Nj with rij = |rij |
for the deformed graphene. Then Eq. (121) is transformed into the continuum limit up to the second-order
magnitudes of ε11 , ε22 , ε12 and r0 κ as

The continuum form (123) has first derived in our previous work 44 which is, in fact, the natural conclusion of
the symmetry of graphene:154 The curved graphene comprises a lot of hexagons which has approximately local
hexagonal symmetry. In fact, 2D structures with hexagonal symmetry are 2D isotropic.134 Thus the elasticity
of the graphene can be reasonably described by the shell
theory of 2D isotropic materials mentioned in Sec. II C
and so its energy has the form of Eq. (123). We also
notice that a flaw in the coefficient before ǫ1 in the expression of kc in our previous work 44.
Using the values of r0 , ǫ1t , ǫ1n , and ǫ2 obtained from
the first-principles calculations, we have kc = 1.62 eV,
k̄ = 0.72 eV, kd = 22.97 eV/Å2 , and k̃ = 19.19 eV/Å2 .
Because the results of first-principles calculation are
applicable for zero temperature, only the results derived from the experiments at low temperature can be
used as reference values to compared with them. The
value of kc is close to the value 1.77 eV estimated by
Komatsu155,156,157 at low temperature (less than 60 K).
The value k̃/kd = 0.83 is quite close to the experimental value 0.8 derived from the in-plane elastic constants of
graphite.158 The elastic properties of graphene can be described by Eq. (123) with four parameters kc , k̄, kd , and
k̃, where the energy density is the same as Eq. (62), the
free energy density of solid shell with 2D isotropic materials. Since k̄/kc = 0.44 is much smaller than k̃/kd = 0.83,
the graphene cannot be regarded as a solid shell with 3D
isotropic materials as Ref. 44.

This value is a little smaller than the largest out-of-plane

consistent with each other because 0.5 nm is the mean
square value which should be smaller than the largest
out-of-plane deformation in the experiment.

Carbon nanotube

Intrinsic roughening in graphene at temperature T

Let us consider the freely suspended graphene which
is almost a flat layer with the area L2 . The small out-ofplane displacement is denoted by w. The energy (123) is

There are two kinds of carbon nanotubes: single- and
multi- walled carbon nanotubes, which are synthesized in
the last decade of 20 century.160,161 Simply speaking, a
single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) can be regarded

439
as a seamless cylinder wrapped up from a graphitic sheet,
as shown in Fig. 14b, whose diameter is in nanometer
scale and length from tens of nanometers to several micrometers if we ignore its two end caps. A multi-walled
carbon nanotube (MWNT) consists of a series of coaxial
SWNTs with layer distance about 3.4 Å.
SWNTs can be expressed as a pair of integers (n,m),
so called index, in terms of the wrapping rule. They
are divided into two classes: achiral tubes if n = m or
nm = 0 and chiral tubes for others.162 The electronic
properties of SWNTs depend sensitively on the index:163
they are metallic if n − m is multiple of 3, else semiconductor. SWNTs also possess many novel mechanical properties,164 in particular high stiffness and axial
strength, which are not sensitive to the tube diameters
and chirality. MWNTs have the similar mechanical properties to SWNTs.165,166 In this section, we will review the
theoretical and numerical results on the elastic properties of carbon nanotubes, and then discuss how the lowdimensional elastic theory mentioned in Sec. II can be
applied in carbon nanotubes.

General review on the elasticity of carbon nanotubes

The early researches on the elasticity of carbon nanotubes are focused on their Young’s modulus Y and Poisson ratio ν. A SWNT is a single layer of carbon atoms.
What is the thickness h of the atomic layer? It is a
widely controversial question. Three typical values of
the thickness listed in Table I are adopted or obtained in
the previous literature Refs. 40, 41, 44 and 167–180. The
first one is about 0.7 Å obtained from fitting the atomic
scale model with the elastic shell theory of 3D isotropic
materials.167,168,169,170,171,172,173 The second one is about
1.4 Å derived from molecular dynamics or finite element
method.174,175 The third one is about 3.4 Å adopting the
layer distance of bulk graphite.176,177,178,179,180 Recently,
Huang et al. have investigated the effective thickness of
SWNTs and found it depends on the type of loadings.181
The size- or chirality-dependent elastic properties of
SWNTs have also been discussed by molecular mechanics model182,183,184 and ab initio calculations.173,185 The
common conclusion is that the Young’s modulus and
Poisson ratio depend weakly on the diameter and chirality of SWNTs if the diameter is larger than 1 nm.
Only for very small SWNTs, the size and chirality effect
is evident. The SWNTs synthesized in the laboratory
have usually the diameters larger than 1 nm; thus the
size and chirality effect can be neglected safely.
The axial tension properties of MWNTs depend on the
layer number of MWNTs for the small layer number and
approach quickly to the properties similar to the bulk
graphite.44,186,187
The buckling and stability of carbon nanotubes under
pressure or bending is a hot topic in the recent researches,
where the critical pressure, moment or the equivalent
quantity, critical strain, are highly concerned. A long

zc = απ I/AL ∝ (ρ/L) ,

(136)

where L, ρ and A are the length, radius and crosssectional area of the carbon nanotube, respectively. I
is the moment of inertia of the nanotube. The value
of α depends on the boundary conditions of the carbon
nanotube. This relation has been investigated by atomicscale finite element method188,189,190 and molecular dynamics method or ab initio calculations.191,192,193,194,195
The basic numerical result is that the tube exhibits
rod-like buckling behavior as the right-handed side of
Eq. (136) if L ≫ ρ. The Timoshenko beam theory, a
more complicated theory than Euler rod theory, is also
employed to discuss the buckling of MWNTs.196 The difference between the results of both theories vanishes for
large value of L/ρ.
For a short carbon nanotube under axial loading, the
continuous shell model of 3D isotropic materials are
widely used.40,188,189,190,192,193,194,197,198,199 The axially

(137)
zc

where ρ and h are the radius and effective thickness
of the SWNT, respectively. ν is the Poisson ratio of
the SWNT. The value of α depends on the boundary condition of the carbon nanotube. For a short
MWNT, the above relation is applicable for the outmost
layer of the tube because the inter-layer interaction of

440
MWNTs is very small.200 It has also been investigated by
atomic-scale finite element method,188,189,190,198 molecular dynamics method,40,192,193,194,199 and nanoindent
experiment.201,202 It is found that the tube displays indeed the shell-like buckling behavior as the right-handed
side of Eq. (137) for the tube aspect ratio L/ρ < 10.
The stability of a long SWNT under radial hydrostatic
pressure might also be described by the continuous shell
model of 3D isotropic materials, and the critical pressure
is138

kc , k̄, kd , and k̃. These four quantities avoid the controversial thickness of SWNTs. We suggest to use them
as the fundamental quantities for SWNTs from which we
can obtain some reduced quantities as follows.
Let us consider a cylinder under an axial loading with
line density f along the circumference. The corresponding axial and circumferential strains are denoted as ε11
and ε22 . With Eq. (123), the free energy of this system
is written as

pshell
∝ ρ−3 ,
cr

where L and ρ are the length and radius of the SWNT.
The in-plane Young’s modulus and Poisson ratio can
be defined as Ys = f /ε11 and νs = −ε22 /ε11 . From
∂F /ε11 = 0 and ∂F /ε22 = 0, we derive

(138)

where ρ is the radius of the SWNT. This relation has
recently been confirmed by Hasegawa and Nishidate203
through ab initio calculations. The stability of a MWNT
under radial hydrostatic pressure might also has the similar relation as Eq. (138) if only we take ρ as the outmost
radius of the MWNT, because the transverse elasticity of
MWNTs204,205 is much weaker than the in-plane elasticity of the outmost single layer of tube.
Bending can also result in the buckling of SWNTs.
The kink phenomenon in a SWNT under pure bending
has been investigated through molecular dynamics simulations and finite element method.40,206 The critical curvature can be described as
−2
κcr = εshell
,
zc /ρ ∝ ρ

(139)

where ρ is the radius of the SWNT. The kink phenomenon in a MWNT under pure bending satisfies the
similar relation to Eq. (139) with small correction due to
inter-layer van de Waals interactions207,208,209 if only we
take ρ as the outmost radius of the MWNT.
Here we would not further discuss the problems on the buckling of MWNTs embedded in
an elastic medium,210,211,212,213,214,215 the postbuckling behavior and the plastic properties

well as the mechanical properties of nanotube

literature.

What are the fundamental quantities for SWNTs?

As mentioned above, different thickness leads to different Young’s modulus (see Table I), which implies
that the Young’s modulus and thickness of SWNTs are
not well-defined physical quantities.229 However, the inplane Young’s modulus Ys = Y h has the similar value
22 eV/Å2 . Thus it is a more well-defined quantity than
the Young’s modulus and the thickness. Here we may
ask: what are the fundamental quantities for SWNTs?
A SWNT is also a single layer of graphite, whose deformation energy can be also described as the revised
Lenosky model (121). The corresponding continuum
limit is Eq. (123) which contains four elastic constants

F ≈ 2πρL[(kd /2)(ε11 + ε22 )2 − k̃ε11 ε22 − f ε11 ] (140)

2

Ys = k̃(2 − k̃/kd ) = 22.35 eV/Å ,
νs = 1 − k̃/kd = 0.165,

(141)
(142)

where the value of Ys is close to the in-plane Young’s
modulus derived from Table I. It is in between 20–
23 eV/Å2 obtained by Sánchez-Portal et al..230 It is much
larger than the value 15 eV/Å2 obtained by Arroyo et
al.231 and Zhang et al.,232 and 17 eV/Å2 by Caillerie et
al.,233 but smaller than 34.6 eV/Å2 for armchair tube by
Wang.234 The value of νs is close to the value 0.16–0.19
obtained by Yakobson et al.,40 Kudin et al.,167 Pantano
et al.,170,171 Wang et al.,173 Hernandez et al.,176 and Shen
et al..177
The other quantity, the bending rigidity D, is also
widely discussed in literature. In terms of Eq. (123), the
energy per area of a SWNT without the in-plane strains
can be expressed as
Gg = kc /2ρ2 ≡ D/2ρ2 .

(143)

D = kc = 1.62 eV,

(144)

Thus the bending rigidity

which is quite close to the value 1.49–1.72 eV obtained
by Kudin et al.167 and Sánchez-Portal et al.230 through
ab initio calculations. It is a little larger than the values 0.85–1.22 eV obtained Yakobson et al.,40 Pantano et
al.,170,171 and Wang.234
In terms of Eqs. (141)–(144), we can infer the values
of kd , k̃, kc from the previous literature, which are listed
in Table II. There is still lack of literature on k̄ except
our previous work42,44,154 and the present review. More
work on k̄ would be highly appreciated in the future.
We should emphasize that our formula (123) holds approximate up to the order of (r0 /ρ)2 for SWNTs, where
r0 is the C-C length and ρ the radius of the SWNT. The
omitted terms is in the order of (r0 /ρ)4 . This is the main
reason for the size effect on the elastic constants in the
very small SWNTs found in Refs. 173,182,183,184,185.
Additionally, we have not considered the effect of StoneWales defects on the local properties of carbon nanotubes. In terms of Refs. 235 and 236, we can deduce
that the defects reduce the the elastic constants of carbon nanotubes.

Revisit the stability of SWNTs

Now we will revisit the stability of SWNTs with the
four fundamental quantities kc , k̄, kd , and k̃ or the corresponding reduced quantities.

First, let us consider a bent SWNT as shown in Fig. 15
where ρ and 1/κ are the radii of the SWNT and the
centerline of the SWNT, respectively. Assume that the
centerline of the SWNT is not extended and the cross
section of the SWNT is still flat after bending under the
condition ρ ≪ L ≪ 1/κ, where L is the total length of
the centerline. In terms of Eq. (123), we can derive the

where ds is the arc length element of the centerline.
The bending modulus of the rod is krod = πρ[(2 −
k̃/kd )k̃ρ2 + kc ]. For the SWNT with diameter in the
order of 1 nm, we can estimate kc ≪ (2 − k̃/kd )k̃ρ2 .
Considering Eq. (141), we have
krod ≈ πYs ρ3 .

(146)

If an axial compression force F is loaded on the both
ends of the SWNT, following Euler rod theory,2 we can
easily derive the critical force, above which the SWNT is
instable, as
Fcrod = 2απkrod /L2 ,

(147)

where α depends on the boundary conditions in two
ends of the SWNT. Defining the critical strain as εrod
zc =
Fcrod /2πρYs and considering the above two equations, we
can derive
2
εrod
zc = α(ρ/L) .

(148)

This relation has the same asymptotic behavior as
Eq. (136), which, as mentioned above, has been confirmed by a lot of theoretical and numerical researches.

442
Secondly, let us consider a short SWNT with radius ρ
and an axial compression force loaded on its two ends.
The force per length along the circumference is denoted
as f . Following Ru’s work,197 considering Eq. (123) we
have the critical axial force density as
p
fcshell = α kc Ys /ρ,

(149)

and the corresponding critical strain
p
εshell
≡ fc /Ys = (α/ρ) kc /Ys ,
zc

(150)

where α depends on the boundary conditions in two ends
of the SWNT. Ys is the in-plane Young’s modulus as
shown in Eq. (141). The above relation (150) has the
same asymptotic behavior as Eq. (137), which, as mentioned in above, has been confirmed by several theoretical
and numerical researches.
Thirdly, let us consider a long enough SWNT with
radius ρ and a radial compression pressure p loaded on its
surface. In terms of the similar method on the stability
of cell membranes, we can derive the critical pressure
pshell
= 3kc /ρ3 ,
cr

(151)

above which the SWNT will lose its stability. This relation has the same asymptotic behavior as Eq. (138). The
corresponding critical circumferential strain is
2
shell
εcir
c = 2ρpcr /Ys = 6kc /Ys ρ .

(152)

Comparing Eq. (151) with (85), one can find that the
critical pressures for carbon nanotubes and lipid tubules
are in the same form. Yin et al. have noticed this similarity in the recent work 237. However, the profound
mechanism is different: nanotubes can endure the shear
strain while lipid tubules cannot.
It seems that no literature discusses the possible instability of a SWNT under axial tension. Here we will
give a qualitative analysis. Assume the tension density
(i.e., force per length) to be f . The axial strain under
the tension is f /Ys and the corresponding circumferential strain is νs f /Ys . When it is beyond the critical value
(152), the SWNT will be instable. Thus we obtain the
critical tension density
fctsn = 6kc /νs ρ2 .

(153)

Only if fctsn is below the strength of the SWNT, the
buckling phenomenon under tension can be observed.
Till now, we have not found that k̄ exists explicitly
in the above equations (148)–(152) for nanotubes. Because the term related to k̄ in the free energy (123) can
be transformed into the boundary term with the aid of
Gauss-Bonnet formula, k̄ should be implicitly contained
by α in these equations, which need the further investigations in the future.

V.

CONCLUSION AND PROSPECT

In summary, we present the elastic theory of lowdimensional (one- and two-dimensional) continua and its
applications in bio- and nano-structures. The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,
fluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. We construct
the free energy density of the continua on the basis of
the symmetry argument. The fundamental equations can
be derived from the bottom-up and the top-down standpoints. Although they have different forms obtained from
these two viewpoints, several examples reveal that they
are, in fact, equivalent to each other. We investigate the
kink stability of short DNA rings, the elasticity of lipid
membranes, and the adhesions between a vesicle and a
substrate or another vesicle. A cell membrane is simplified as a composite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane
skeleton. The membrane skeleton is shown to enhance
highly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. We
propose a revised Lenosky lattice model based on the local density approximation and derive its continuum form
up to the second order terms of curvatures and strains,
which is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells.
The intrinsic roughening of graphene and several typical mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are addressed by using this continuum form. We can abandon the controversial thickness and Young’s modulus of
graphene and SWNTs if we adopt this continuum form
to describe the mechanical properties of graphene and
SWNTs.
Finally, we would like to list a few open problems which
need to be addressed in the future work.
(i) The vesicles with lipid domains have been investigated in Sec. III B. There is a special lipid domain at
liquid-ordered phase, so called the raft, which is enriched
in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Cholesterol is a kind
of chiral lipid molecules, which has not been included in
the previous and present theory of lipid domains. A new
theory with the chirality on the raft domain should be
developed.
(ii) The composite shell, as a model of cell membranes, has been investigated in Sec. III C where the
constraint between the area of the lipid bilayer and
membrane skeleton is totally neglected. Additionally,
only the small deformation of cell membranes are addressed in this review. The large deformation behavior of cell membranes238,239,240 has recently discussed
through numerical simulations. It is necessary to reRconsider the
R composite shell model with the constraint
JdA = Jb dA and its behavior under large deformation theoretically.
(iii) We suggest adopting four parameters kc , k̄, kd ,
and k̃ to describe the mechanics of graphitic structures
in Sec. IV. However, there are sparse studies on k̄ in
previous literature. It is highly expected to theoretical
and experimental work on this quantity.
(iv) We only talk about the thermal fluctuation on the
discussion of graphene. The fluctuations of DNA, lipid

443
membranes, and cell membranes are not in the range
of our topics, on which we suggest that gentle readers
consult Refs.10,33,63,64.
(v) The elastic theory presented in this review is a
static theory. Thus we are very regretted that we have
to omit several important subjects such as the vesicles
in shear flows,241,242,243,244,245 and dynamic response of
carbon nanotubes or nanotube networks246,247 and so on.
These topics will be quickly developed in the future.

ω3 Ω31 = dΩ1 + Ω2 ω21 + Ω3 ω31 ,
ω3 Ω32 = Ω1 ω12 + dΩ2 + Ω3 ω32 ,

Considering the above equations (A1), (A4)–(A8) and
integral by parts as well as Stokes’ theorem, we can derive
Eqs. (16) and (17) from the free energy (14).
APPENDIX B: SURFACE VARIATIONAL
THEORY

Following the spirit of Ref. 49, any infinitesimal deformation of a surface can be achieved by a displacement
vector at each point on the surface as
δr ≡ v = Ω1 e1 + Ω2 e2 + Ω3 e3 ,

Note added in proof

ω3 = ds, ω12 = τ ω3 , ω13 = −κω3 , ω23 = 0.

(B1)

where δ can be understood a variational operator. The
frame is also changed because of the deformation of the
surface, which is still denoted as
δei = Ωij ej ,

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(B2)

where Ωij = −Ωji , (i, j = 1, 2, 3) corresponds to the rotation of the frame due to the deformation of the surface.
From δdr = dδr, δdej = dδej , and Eqs. (2)–(5), we can
derive

These equations are the essential equations of the surface

where δ can be understood a variational operator. The

Using the above three equations and the Stokes’ theorem,
we can easily derive Eq. (57) from the free energy (56),
or Eqs. (87)–(90) from the free energy (86), and so on.

APPENDIX C: STOKES’ THEOREM AND THE
OTHER IMPORTANT GEOMETRIC RELATIONS

The Stokes’ theorem is a crucial theorem in differential
geometry. Let us denote the boundary of domain D as
∂D. The Stokes’ theorem states as: If ω is a differential
form on ∂D, then
I
Z
ω=
dω.
(C1)
∂D

D

R

In particular, D dω = 0 for a closed domain D.
It contains a lot of geometric relations, which are listed
as follows.
(i) For any smooth functions f and h on 2D domain
D, we have
Z
I
(f d∗dh − hd∗df ) =
(f ∗dh − h∗df ),

˜ − hd˜
˜ )=
˜ − h˜
˜ ).
(f d˜∗dh

(f ˜

(iii) For the tensors S and M defined in Sec. II, we
have
I
Z
S · b ds =
div S dA,
(C6)
ZD
I ∂D
div M dA,
(C7)
M · b ds =
∂D

where D is a 2D domain with boundary ∂D and b is the
normal vector of ∂D in the tangent plane.
The above three items are also called the Stokes’ theorem in this review, which are widely used in the variational process.
The other geometric identities linking the vector form
and differential form on a smooth surface used in this review are summarized as follows without additional proof.
(curl u) dA = d(u · dr),
(div u) dA = d(∗u · dr),
