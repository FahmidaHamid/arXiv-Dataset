Abstract
Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern in the United States and
globally. While influenza vaccines are the single most effective intervention to reduce influenza
morbidity and mortality, there is considerable debate surrounding the merits and consequences of
repeated seasonal vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact
network model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in vaccination
across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that revaccination reduces the
influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the overall number of susceptible individuals,
but also because it better protects highly-connected individuals, who would otherwise make a

1

disproportionately large contribution to influenza transmission. Our work thus contributes a
population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and
advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories.

Introduction
Influenza is a serious public health threat in the United States. In recent decades, seasonal
influenza has contributed to about 30,000 excess deaths per year on average [1], is a significant
cause of outpatient and emergency department visits by children [2-3], and accounts for millions
of lost workdays each year [4]. Controlling influenza is a multifaceted effort utilizing strategies
such as antiviral drug treatment and prophylaxis [4] and hygiene practices like washing hands
and wearing face masks [5-6]. However, seasonal influenza vaccination has been the centerpiece
of influenza control efforts in the United States for the past 60 years and vaccine coverage of
only 40% is believed to reduce the risk of influenza illness by about 60% among the overall
population [7].
While the impact of overall influenza vaccine coverage levels in a single season has been
studied in detail [8-12], the consequences of repeated seasonal influenza vaccination to the same
individuals have not been studied as extensively. Most research on repeated vaccination has
considered this problem from an immunological [13-14] or purely statistical perspective and not
considered potential population-level consequences of repeated vaccination. For example, Ohmit
et al. [15] recently found that seasonal influenza vaccines are ineffective for patients who were
vaccinated the previous season, but Keitel et al. [16] and Voordouw et al. [17] found that
repeated vaccination contributes to increased protection. Such discrepancies may be explained by
the antigenic distance hypothesis, which depends on positive and negative interference between
vaccine strains [18].
A thorough understanding of the merits of vaccination strategies may require considering
their consequences across multiple seasons. Carrat et al. [19] assume no long-term
immunological benefits from repeated seasonal influenza vaccination, and model long-run

3

effects of vaccination strategies which prescribe vaccinating adults and children, such as the
strategy recently adopted in the United States. Their analysis suggests that vaccinating people
throughout their lives prevents them from developing natural immunity to influenza and
therefore increases the risk of infection at older ages. Counterintuitively, their results suggest that
given the greater risk of mortality associated with influenza at increasing ages, vaccination at all
ages may actually increase influenza mortality. However, their analysis does not directly model
influenza epidemics and does not account for any herd immunity impacts of higher vaccination
rates or rates of individual-level revaccination. Similarly, Bodewes et al. [20] suggest that
repeated seasonal influenza vaccination may be disadvantageous because it might prevent
patients from developing heterosubtypic immunity that could potentially be protective during a
pandemic [21].
Mathematical epidemiological models have been used extensively to study vaccination
and other influenza control strategies, and consider targeted vaccination to minimize morbidity,
mortality, or economic costs [22-27]. Some mathematical models as well as epidemiological data
suggest that targeting influenza vaccination towards school-age children may be a preferred
strategy, as children are the age group most likely to be infected with influenza and to transmit it
to others [22, 26]. Others have advocated for a strategy that minimizes mortality by targeting
those most at risk for complications and death [24, 27]. However, most models of influenza
vaccination have focused on single epidemics and hence not accounted for the rate of
revaccination (but see Fung et al. [28]). Also, modeling revaccination inherently requires a
modeling framework such as contact network modeling that explicitly models individual hosts.
Recent theoretical research using contact network models has shown the significance of

4

modeling epidemics in series, when natural immunity from past epidemics influences future ones
[29-30].
In this study, we consider whether the rate of revaccination, which we define as the
proportion of first season vaccine recipients who are vaccinated in a successive influenza season,
may be epidemiologically relevant. We present a two-season mathematical model to explore the
consequences of influenza revaccination on herd immunity and the mechanisms driving them.
Our theoretical study suggests that revaccination indeed reduces the public health burden, and
that this result is robust with respect to variation in contact structure, vaccine efficacy, vaccine
coverage, vaccine assortativity, and levels of natural immunity. Our work thus contributes a
population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination and
advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual vaccine histories.

Results
We define the rate of revaccination (r) as the proportion of vaccine recipients in one
influenza season who are also vaccinated in the following season. If vaccination were random
with respect to previous vaccination status, the expected revaccination rate would be equal to the
vaccination coverage. Because the expected revaccination rate is a function of the vaccination
coverage, we additionally define r’ to be the excess revaccination rate, which takes into account
variable vaccination coverage and measures revaccination beyond the level expected at random.
(Details in Methods.) However, for almost all of our analyses we will simply use r, because
vaccination coverage will be held constant.
To assess the epidemiological relevance of revaccination rates, we present a contact
network model for two consecutive influenza seasons. In the contact network model, each

5

individual is represented as a node, and influenza-spreading contacts or interactions are
represented as edges (Figure 1). Prior to the first influenza season, all individuals in the
population are susceptible to infection. A proportion of this population is protected by pre-season
vaccination. We assume that vaccine-induced immunity is fully-protective in a season and is
protective only in the season in which vaccination occurs, but that natural immunity confers
protection in the season following infection (further information in Methods). Outbreaks are
simulated until a large epidemic (i.e. ≥5% of individuals infected) occurs. Following a first
season epidemic, vaccination is implemented again prior to the second season outbreak. The
identity of the second season vaccine recipients is chosen based on the revaccination rate (r,
ranging from 0% to 100%), and is implemented randomly. We assume that the level of
vaccination coverage is constant across both seasons, supported by the National Health Interview
Survey which shows that flu vaccination coverage in the United States has been quite consistent
from the 2007-2008 season to the 2011-2012 season [31]. We record results from second seasons
in which a large epidemic occurs. We focus on the size of second-season epidemics, because the
rate of revaccination inherently cannot have any bearing on first season outbreaks.
When the model is applied to a synthetic (computationally-generated) exponential
random contact network (details in Methods below), we find that second season epidemic sizes
decrease as the rate of revaccination increases (Figure 2). This result indicates that the rate of
revaccination is indeed epidemiologically relevant, and we explore below some of the
mechanisms leading to this effect.

Explaining the Effect of Revaccination: “Wasting” Vaccine

6

One possible cause of the effect of revaccination on epidemic size is that as the rate of
revaccination increases, vaccine is used more efficiently because individuals with natural
immunity from first-season infection are less likely to also be vaccinated for the second season.
When revaccination is complete (r = 100%), no individual can be both naturally immune (i.e.
protected due to first season infection) and have second-season vaccination because, under total
revaccination, all individuals vaccinated immediately prior to the second season must have also
been vaccinated and thus fully protected for the first season. Under the assumptions of the
model, vaccinating individuals with natural immunity does not provide further protection to
those individuals or in terms of herd immunity to the population. As a result, more revaccination
leads to fewer susceptible individuals prior to the second season, which indicates a more efficient
use of vaccine.
We test this by comparing the results of two models that differ only in terms of which
individuals are eligible to be vaccinated for the first time prior to the second season. One
model—universal vaccination—follows the method outlined in the previous section, in which
vaccine doses not used for revaccination are randomly given to any individuals not vaccinated
for the first season, including both naturally immune and never vaccinated or infected
individuals. An alternative model—preferential vaccination—still implements revaccination as
before, but the only individuals who are candidates for first-time vaccination prior to the second
season are those without natural immunity from the first season, thus not “wasting” vaccine on
any naturally-immune individuals. While this approach may not be realistic because individuals
who are infected with influenza in a previous season might be more motivated to be vaccinated
in a subsequent season, it provides a useful model for comparison. When revaccination is
complete (r = 100%), no individuals are vaccinated for the first time prior to the second season

7

and, as such, the two models are functionally identical. Figure 3a confirms that under the
preferential vaccination scenario, the proportion of all individuals who are susceptible prior to
the second season does not change even as the revaccination rate changes. This is as expected,
because under the preferential vaccination scenario, the number of susceptible individuals is
simply the total number of individuals in the network minus the number of individuals with
natural immunity from the first season and minus the number of individuals vaccinated for the
second season. Neither first season epidemic size nor vaccine coverage are functions of the
revaccination rate.
On the other hand, we find that as the rate of revaccination increases, the proportion of
susceptible individuals infected during the second season decreases regardless of whether
individuals with natural immunity are vaccinated (Figure 3b). While the effect of revaccination is
most pronounced in the universal vaccination scenario, a decrease in epidemic size is also
evident under the preferential vaccination scenario. This result suggests that the increasing
number of protected individuals does not fully explain the relationship between revaccination
rate and epidemic size, and that higher revaccination rates also confer greater indirect protection
to susceptible individuals. We present these two models of vaccination only to illustrate that
revaccination has an impact on epidemic sizes even when the number of susceptible individuals
is constant. Elsewhere in this study we focus only on the universal vaccination approach.

Efficiency of Vaccination Schemes: Connectivity of Susceptible Individuals
It is well-understood that public health measures such as vaccination can demonstrate an
impact beyond those directly protected, to indirectly protect a larger community. The extent of
this indirect protection, or herd effect, can be quantified in our model by comparing second-

8

season epidemic sizes at elevated rates of revaccination to second-season epidemic sizes when
the level of revaccination is equal to the overall coverage level (Figure 4), which is the level of
revaccination expected if vaccination was not affected by previous vaccination status. Figure 4
shows that as revaccination increases, the population level efficacy of indirect protection
increases as well.
To better understand why higher rates of revaccination indirectly protect susceptible
individuals, we explore the degree (number of contacts or edges) of susceptible and protected
(vaccinated or naturally immunized) individuals in the network. Vaccination in the first season is
random, so the expected value of the average degree of nodes vaccinated in the first season is
equal to the mean degree of the network (Figure 5a). However, infection during the first season
and, therefore, natural immunity prior to the second season are not random with respect to
degree, because higher degree nodes are more likely to be infected during the first season (Figure
5a) [32, 30]. Consequently, remaining susceptible nodes have disproportionately lower degree,
on average, than both naturally immune individuals and individuals vaccinated during the first
season (Figure 5a). In a population connected as an exponential random network, with complete
revaccination, susceptible individuals in the second season have an average degree that is 15%
smaller than that of susceptible individuals in the first season. However, when individuals
vaccinated for the first season are not revaccinated, these nodes of average degree are, in effect,
added to the set of nodes susceptible in the second season, thereby increasing the average degree
of susceptible individuals (Figure 5b). This, in turn, decreases the strength of the herd effect in
the network, because when high degree nodes are not protected either by vaccination or natural
immunity, the epidemic is able to spread further [33-34].

Robustness in Realistic Populations
While we are not aware of any studies that focus on estimating influenza revaccination
rates in large populations, we have been able to infer approximate revaccination rates from a
variety of studies. Rates likely vary between populations, perhaps depending on factors such as
access to vaccines and the overall rate of vaccination in the population. For example, data from a
study of Medicare beneficiaries [35] indicates a revaccination rate of 93.4% between the 1998-99
and 1999-2000 influenza seasons with a 70% vaccine coverage rate; while Uddin et al. [36]
surveyed college students and found a revaccination rate between the 2006-07 and 2007-08
seasons of 58.5% with an average coverage rate of 15.65%. Lastly, based on data reported in a
large study of people 65 years and older in the Netherlands, we estimated rates of revaccination
generally between 80 and 90% [17]. Adjusting these revaccination rates for varying coverage
levels, we estimate plausible excess revaccination rates of 39% to 78% (Figure 6).
To explore the robustness of our findings, we test our hypotheses on an empirical contact
network model as well as with realistic values of epidemiological parameters. The empirical
network represents an urban population based on data for the city of Vancouver, British
Columbia, and is built from age-specific, activity-based interaction patterns relevant to the
spread of an influenza-like illness [37, 30]. Bansal et al. [30] find that while the Vancouverbased model has a higher density of contacts, age-specific contact patterns are captured well in
the model compared with empirical data from studies on contact structure.
Based on this contact network, we assume age-specific vaccine efficacy and coverage
rates based on the 2006 and 2011 influenza seasons in the United States, as well as levels of
natural immunity based on empirical estimates from recent studies (details in Methods). Our
findings in this scenario, based on the Vancouver host population and empirical parameters, are

10

qualitatively similar to those found previously: increased revaccination decreases the proportion
of individuals infected (Figure 6). While the impact of revaccination is more muted due to the
use of an imperfect vaccine (as available in the two U.S. influenza seasons considered) with
moderate levels of coverage, these results illustrate that revaccination does indeed reduce the
burden on public health (for realistic estimates of r’), and has the capacity for a larger impact.
In addition, we conduct sensitivity analyses to assess whether our findings are robust with
respect to partial natural immunity (Figure S1), vaccine efficacy (Figure S2) and vaccine
coverage rates (Figures S3 and S4). We also studied whether assortative vaccination, a
phenomenon that has been observed empirically [38, 39], affects the relationship between
revaccination and epidemic size (Figure S5). In terms of network variables, we consider the
impact of variation in network size (i.e. the size of the population) (Figure S6) and variance in
node degree (Figure S7). In general, we find that the decrease in epidemic size due to
revaccination is strongest when both vaccine efficacy and natural immunity are complete and
when networks have degree distributions with high variance. In addition, lower vaccine coverage
appears to increase the effect of revaccination on the total number of cases, highlighting that
higher revaccination rates can be used to compensate for low coverage rates (e.g. the epidemic
size for a vaccine coverage rate of 50% with no revaccination is equivalent to the epidemic size
for a vaccine coverage rate of 30% with full revaccination) (Figure S4). Finally, we observed
that the relationship between revaccination rate and epidemic size is robust to both assortative
vaccination and network size. (All figures mentioned are in the Supplementary Materials).

Discussion

11

Using a mathematical modeling framework that accounts for the consequences of past
epidemics on future disease outbreaks (Figure 1), we have considered the epidemiological
impact of influenza revaccination. Our work suggests that implementing greater rates of
revaccination may contribute to reduced outbreak sizes (Figure 2), both by reducing the overall
number of individuals who are susceptible by using vaccine more efficiently (Figure 3), and by
increasing the extent to which more connected individuals are protected (Figures 4 and 5). We
also show that similar results are obtained in populations with more realistic contact structure,
with empirical estimates of natural immunity levels and less than ideal vaccine coverage and
efficacy levels from recent influenza outbreaks (Figure 6). While we have focused our attention
on the impact of revaccination on the total incidence of influenza, we expect similarly positive
results for other metrics of public health impact (e.g. peak incidence and outbreak duration).
The process described in this study can be thought of as a partial fragmentation of the
contact network by first season vaccination and, especially, the random vaccination of highlyconnected individuals. Infection then spreads, working its way through the most connected parts
of the network, but its path is constrained by first season vaccination. When previously
vaccinated individuals are not revaccinated (i.e. when r is low), previously protected fragments
of the network are made vulnerable. This compromises the strength of herd protection, thereby
creating new paths through the population along which infection during the second season can
spread, leading to larger second season epidemic sizes.
More generally, we have demonstrated that mathematical models to develop and test
influenza vaccination schemes should take into account prior vaccination status, as the
distribution of vaccination in a population, even if it is random, can shape patterns of natural
immunity. In turn, patterns of natural immunity are not random and drive the frailty, which is the

12

extent to which highly connected individuals are at risk of infection, of the host population [32,
30]. These findings also reinforce previous work that highlights the need for shifting influenza
control strategy with the epidemiological structure of a population, and targeting those most
likely to be infected [30]. While this study focuses on human influenza in particular, the
population-level consequences of revaccination rates may be relevant to research on other
infectious disease systems with complex multi-strain natural and vaccine-induced immunity
dynamics, such as dengue and even swine influenza or foot and mouth disease in livestock [4042]. This study is relevant to public and animal health policy because it contributes a populationlevel perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza vaccination.
One of the limitations of this study, however, is that in real populations, there is no
corresponding first season of seasonal influenza in which natural immunity does not exist, as is
assumed here. A better understanding of the longitudinal distribution and properties of natural
and vaccine-induced immunity to influenza in empirical contact networks would significantly
enhance modeling efforts. Also, this model assumes that the host population is closed and that
the network structure is constant across both seasons. Presumably those assumptions become less
tenable as models take into account more seasons in series. However, the mechanism of indirect
protection we have identified relates to the average connectivity of immune and susceptible
individuals, not necessarily their particular place in the network. Therefore, future research
should address not only how contact networks change over time, but also the extent to which the
degree of individuals remains consistent over time. Finally, this model does not explicitly take
into account viral evolution (viral evolution is an implicit factor only to the extent that vaccine
failure is due to antigenic drift). Presumably, the validity of the assumption that vaccine-induced

13

immunity is season-specific and that natural immunity is effective across seasons varies
depending on the particular pair of seasons under consideration.
While vaccinating individuals with large numbers of contacts is arguably advantageous
regardless of the individual’s immunological history, this study indicates that it may be
especially important to vaccinate individuals who, by virtue of their occupation or living
arrangements, are likely to have a high number of contacts and who have been vaccinated
previously. Due to past vaccination, such individuals may be less likely to have natural immunity
and, if not vaccinated, could infect large numbers of contacts. Some health care systems send
reminders to people vaccinated in previous years to be vaccinated for the upcoming influenza
season [43, 35]. Practically, this is an effective practice because past vaccination is a strong
predictor of future willingness to be vaccinated, but this study shows that this health care
intervention may have population-level benefits beyond that of simply increasing vaccine
coverage. The results of our study demonstrate that policy debates about repeated influenza
vaccination and the related topic of universal vaccination should take into account disease
ecology and, especially, herd immunity considerations, not just immunological and public health
implementation considerations.

Methods
Defining Revaccination
We define the rate of revaccination (r) as the proportion of vaccine recipients in one
influenza season who are also vaccinated in the following season. The revaccination rate is
easiest to conceptualize if populations are closed and the level of vaccine coverage is constant
across both seasons. As vaccine coverage approaches 100%, the revaccination rate also

14

converges to 100%. However, if the overall vaccination coverage is less than or equal to 50%,
the range of theoretically possible revaccination rates is 0% to 100%. If vaccination were random
with respect to previous vaccination status, the expected revaccination rate would be equal to the
vaccination coverage. To account for this, we additionally define r’ to be the excess
revaccination rate, which measures revaccination beyond what is expected at random,

r '=

r− C
1− C

where r is the absolute rate of revaccination and C is the vaccine coverage.

Population Model
We simulated epidemics on computationally-generated contact network structures.
Computationally-generated theoretical networks allow us to systematically study the
epidemiological consequences of network structure. The network structure used in this study is
an exponential random network, with the number of contacts (i.e. degree) per individual sampled
from a geometric distribution, and connected randomly. We assume an average degree of 10
contacts per individual and a network size of 5,000 nodes. (The impact of these choices is
studied in the sensitivity analyses.) While much remains unknown about contact networks in real
populations, Bansal et al. [44] found that contact networks derived from empirical data
correspond more closely to exponential random network structures than other common network
types.

Epidemiological Two-Season Model & Vaccination

15

We model first-season vaccination with single doses of influenza vaccine by removing
select individuals and all their connections from the network. Individuals to be vaccinated are
chosen randomly, and the size of the population to be vaccinated (and thus fully protected
against influenza) is CE, where C is the vaccine coverage rate, and E is the vaccine efficacy. We
call the set of individuals who are vaccinated in the first season, V1, and note that these
individuals are only protected for the first season (as influenza vaccine-induced immunity is
temporary).
To model the first season outbreak, we perform Monte Carlo simulations for a
susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) epidemic model with a single initial infected case and percontact transmissibility, T1, on all susceptible individuals in the networks specified above. Once
infected, a node cannot be reinfected during the same season, and unlike with vaccination, will
have resistance to infection during the subsequent season (natural immunity). This is a
reasonable assumption because natural immunity is thought to induce a stronger, longer lasting
immune response than vaccines, and provide better cross-protection across strains [45-48].
Second-season vaccination is modeled similarly, except the identity of vaccinated
individuals is no longer completely random. Based on the revaccination rate, r, a proportion r of
the vaccinated group (V1) is vaccinated first. The remaining vaccine supply (C-rV1) is distributed
randomly among the rest of the population.
The second season outbreak is also modeled with a Monte Carlo SIR model, and an
independent transmissibility T2. Infection in the second season is allowed in all susceptible
individuals (that is, those individuals who do not have natural immunity from the first season and
those who have not been vaccinated immediately prior to the second season). Second season
outbreaks are only considered in cases when a large epidemic occurs in the first season. The

16

model assumes constant demography and constant network structure over the course of the two
seasons. Public health burden is measured in terms of the proportion of the population infected in
the case that there is a large epidemic in the second season (“second-season size of epidemic”).

Realistic Parameters
In the robustness analysis on the Vancouver urban network [37, 30], we divide the
population into four age classes: Ages 0-4, 5-18, 19-64, and ≥65. The vaccine efficacies for each
of these age groups were 60%, 60%, 70%, and 50%, respectively, and were primarily based on
clinical trials of influenza vaccines and meta-analyses thereof [49-55, 7]. We also implement two
vaccine coverage scenarios. For a scenario based on the 2011-2012 influenza season in the
United States, the age-specific vaccine coverage levels are 55%, 45%, 40%, and 70%,
respectively [56]; for a scenario based on coverage levels from 2006 in the United States, agespecific vaccine coverage levels are 33%, 16%, 21%, and 65%, respectively [57-58].
Revaccination rates are applied to each age class such that the excess revaccination is equal
across age classes (i.e. differences in vaccine coverage are taken into account.) While the
relationship between immune response and future protection is not well quantified, the efficacy
of natural immunity, Q, for all age groups is assumed to be 80% [59-60, 45, 48]. In this case,
natural immunity is implemented in a manner similar to vaccination, so that 80% of those
infected in the first season are assumed to be fully protected against infection, while the
remaining 20% are not protected at all.
The methods for the remaining sensitivity analyses are described in the Supplemental
Materials.

Figures

Figure 1. Schematic representation of a two-season contact network model for seasonal
influenza. Individuals make up nodes in the contact network, and contacts between individuals
are represented by network edges. This heuristic representation assumes that both natural
immunity and vaccine efficacy are complete (E=1.0 and Q=1.0). The scenario in which there is
no revaccination (r=0) is illustrated here. The universal revaccination scheme in which naturally
immune individuals may be randomly selected for second season vaccination is used (note the
individual, in purple, who is both naturally immune and vaccinated).

Figure 2. Second season epidemic size decreases as revaccination increases. This figure is based
on results from 2000 simulated second season large epidemics on a single 5000 node exponential
random network with T1=.09, T2=.18, E=1.0, Q=1.0, and C=.25.

Figure 3. a) The proportion of all individuals susceptible prior to the second season decreases as
the revaccination rate increases when the universal vaccination scenario is used (black), but is
held constant under the preferential vaccination scenario (gray). b) The proportion of susceptible
individuals infected during the second seasons decreases as the revaccination rate increases
regardless of whether the universal vaccination scenario (black) or the preferential vaccination
scenario is used (gray). This figure is based on results from 2000 simulated second season large
epidemics on a single 5000 node exponential random network with T1=.09, T2=.18, E=1.0,
Q=1.0, and C=.25. This is the only figure that contrasts results from the universal and
preferential vaccination schemes. Elsewhere, only universal vaccination is shown.

Figure 4. This figure shows the strength of the herd effect (or, indirect protection) at different
levels of revaccination. Efficacy is calculated as 1-RR, where RR is the relative risk, calculated as
the ratio of incidence among unvaccinated individuals at the specified rate of revaccination and
incidence among unvaccinated individuals when the revaccination rate is equal to the vaccine
coverage (i.e. r’=0). This figure is based on results from 2000 simulated second season large
epidemics on a single 5000 node exponential random network with T1=.09, T2=.18, E=1.0,
Q=1.0, and C=.25.

Figure 5. a) Estimated probability of first season vaccination is constant regardless of degree
(black x). Nodes of higher degree are more likely to be infected during the first season epidemic
and therefore more likely to have natural immunity (black circles). Consequently, lower degree
nodes are more likely to be susceptible prior to the second season epidemic (gray circles). The
probabilities shown here are calculated for the 0% revaccination level, but the qualitative
patterns are similar across all revaccination rates. We note that this panel does not reflect the
degree distribution of the network. b) At higher revaccination rates, the mean degree of second
season susceptible nodes decreases. Here, the mean degree of susceptible nodes is normalized by
the network’s mean degree. This figure is based on results from 2000 simulated second season
large epidemics on a single 5000 node exponential random network with T1=.09, T2=.18, E=1.0,
Q=1.0, and C=.25.

results from 2000 simulated second season large epidemics on an age-structured network
representative of contact patterns in Vancouver, British Columbia, with partial natural immunity
(Q=80%) and age-specific vaccine efficacies and coverage rates (see Methods). Two vaccination
scenarios are illustrated here, one based on vaccine coverage levels in the United States during
the 2011-2012 influenza season and the other based on vaccine coverage levels circa 2006 in the
United States. The light gray box corresponds to values of excess revaccination calculated from
empirical studies of vaccination (see Results).

Increasing Herd Immunity with Influenza Revaccination
Eric Mooring and Shweta Bansal

Supplemental Materials
Sensitivity Analysis—Model Variables
We conducted numerous simulations to test how changing key parameters in the model
affected the relationship between revaccination rate and epidemic size. Unless otherwise noted,
1000 iterations were conducted for each combination of values. We found that when natural
immunity is stronger, increasing the rate of revaccination has a larger effect on the size of second
season epidemics (Figure S1). This finding makes intuitive sense because in the limit where
there is no natural immunity across seasons, each season can be thought of as independent and
equivalent. As expected, we also found smaller second seasons when natural immunity is
stronger, regardless of level of revaccination.
Additionally, we considered the consequences of changing efficacy of vaccination. The
effect of revaccination on epidemic size is strongest when vaccine is fully protective (Figure S2).
Regardless of the degree of revaccination, we found higher second season epidemic sizes when
vaccine efficacy was greater, because greater vaccine efficacy in the first season limited the
degree of natural immunity in the second season and vice versa. For this reason, we plotted the
summed first and second season epidemic sizes.
Next, we considered the effect of changing the level of vaccine coverage. This sensitivity
analysis is complicated by the fact that the level of vaccine coverage is not wholly independent
of the rate of revaccination. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of changing rates of excess
revaccination, which is measured as
r '=

r− C
1− C

where r is the absolute degree of revaccination and C is the vaccine coverage. This can be
thought of as the extent of revaccination beyond that which would be expected by chance (C)
normalized by the magnitude of the range of possible excess revaccination (1-C). Figure S3
indicates that the effect of revaccination is greater at lower vaccine coverage levels, but this
effect is largely because at lower vaccine coverage levels, the range of possible excess
revaccination rates is larger. Specifically, figure S4 plots the same data but plots the absolute

33

revaccination (r) as opposed to the excess revaccination (r’) on the x-axis. The effect of
increasing revaccination at high vaccine coverage levels now appears magnified. Because the
degree of vaccine coverage affects the first season epidemic size and hence the degree of natural
immunity in the population, as with the sensitivity analysis on vaccine efficacy, we plot summed
first and second season epidemic sizes.
Finally, we investigated whether assortativity with respect to vaccination affects the
relationship between revaccination and epidemic size. There does not appear to be any
systematic effect on the relationship, but assortativity affects the size of the first season epidemic
and thus the amount of natural immunity in the community, so we therefore present summed first
and second season epidemic sizes (Figure S5).
Assortative vaccination assignments were generated based on the algorithm of Salathé
and Khandelwal [1]. Assortative first season vaccination assignments were created by first
randomly assigning vaccination at a given coverage level and calculating the assortativity
coefficient ρ. Next, two nodes with opposite vaccination status were selected and their assigned
vaccination statuses were swapped; ρ was recalculated and if ρ was increased by the swap then it
was preserved. If not, the pair of nodes reverted to their original assigned vaccination status. This
process was repeated until the target assortativity was reached. In this sensitivity analysis, target
assortativities of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25 were used. The values span values observed in
an empirical study of seasonal influenza vaccination on a contact network [2]. To generate
second season vaccination assignments, the first season assignments and a given level of
revaccination were used to generate preliminary second season assignments. Then, as before, the
assortativity was boosted as needed by randomly selecting pairs of nodes with opposite second
season vaccination status, swapping statuses, and recalculating ρ. But now, all pairs of nodes had
to share the same first season vaccination status. (This process was unnecessary when
revaccination was complete, because the first season assignments were reused and already met
the target level of assortativity.) We did not investigate having the target level of assortativity
vary between seasons.
Sensitivity Analysis—Network Variables
We conducted simulations to determine the effect of changing the structure of the
network on the relationship between the degree of revaccination and second season epidemic
size. To test the effect of network size, we computationally generated exponential random
34

networks with 250, 500, 5,000, 15,000, and 25,000 nodes. While the degree distributions were
drawn from theoretical distributions with mean degree of 10, the networks actually differ slightly
in mean degree, which influenced the size of first seasons and, in turn, the extent of natural
immunity. Therefore, for the same reason as in the assortativity sensitivity analysis, the response
variable shown in this analysis is the summed first and second season epidemic size. Figure S6
shows the results of simulations on ten networks of each size. Note that simulations using the
smaller networks exhibit greater variance in epidemic size. However, there does not appear to be
a systematic effect of network size on the relationship between revaccination rate and epidemic
size.
Finally, we assessed the effect of changing variance of the degree distribution on the
relationship between revaccination rate and epidemic size. We computationally generated
negative binomial networks from negative binomial distributions with mean degree 10 and
variances 10, 13.5, 18, 22.5, 36, and 90. The negative binomial distributions were shifted
rightward by one unit so that zero was excluded from the degree distribution. We found that the
effect of increasing revaccination was strongest when variance in degree was greatest (Figure
S7). This finding confirms our explanation that non-randomness of natural immunity with
respect to degree partially underlies the effect of revaccination on epidemic size. Because the
variance of the degree distribution affects first season epidemic sizes, summed first and second
season epidemic sizes are plotted in figure S7.
