We study four citrate synthase homodimeric proteins within a structure-based coarse-grained model. Two of
these proteins come from thermophilic bacteria, one from a cryophilic bacterium and one from a mesophilic
organism; three are in the closed and two in the open conformations. Even though the proteins belong
to the same fold, the model distinguishes the properties of these proteins in a way which is consistent with
experiments. For instance, the thermophilic proteins are more stable thermodynamically than their mesophilic
and cryophilic homologues, which we observe both in the magnitude of thermal fluctuations near the native
state and in the kinetics of thermal unfolding. The level of stability correlates with the average coordination
number for amino acids contacts and with the degree of structural compactness. The pattern of positional
fluctuations along the sequence in the closed conformation is different than in the open conformation, including
within the active site. The modes of correlated and anticorrelated movements of pairs of amino acids forming
the active site are very different in the open and closed conformations. Taken together, our results show
that the precise location of amino acid contacts in the native structure appears to be a critical element in
explaining the similarities and differences in the thermodynamic properties, local flexibility and collective
motions of the different forms of the enzyme.

INTRODUCTION

The primary characteristics of globular proteins are
their native structures and sequences of amino acids. An
evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor may
lead diverse sequences to fold to nearly the same native
structure. One particularly interesting example is citrate
synthase (CS), an enzyme that is found in most living
organisms, from bacteria to man1 . It acts as a part of the
Krebs cycle that generates ATP2 . The native structure
of CS from a bacteria living in hot hydrothermal vents
is superimposable with that of CS from a bacteria living
under the conditions of extreme cold1 and yet properties
of these proteins, such as the thermodynamic stability,
are distinct so that the enzymatic action – conversion of
acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate into CoA and citrate3 – is
executed properly.
In this paper, we investigate to what extent structurebased coarse-grained models, or rather their one specific
implementation, can capture physical differences between
proteins which belong to the same fold. We study four
CS proteins and demonstrate that their properties are indeed distinct in the model due to the existence of slight
differences in the native structures. In particular, the
model thermophilic proteins are found to have stronger
thermodynamic stability than those which are cryophilic
(an equivalent term is: psychrophilic). However, we also
find that the root-mean-square single-site fluctuations are

alike within the very region of the active site of the thermophilic and cryophilic forms, even though they are distinct in other parts of the proteins.
The structure-based dynamical models follow from
Go’s idea4–6 that kinetic and thermodynamic properties
of proteins should depend primarily on the geometry of
the native structure and less so directly on the specificity
of the sequence. There are many variants of such models
(see, for instance, Refs.7–12 ). They are not equivalent,
but their predictions are expected to be most accurate in
a vicinity of the native state – a situation encountered,
for instance, during stretching manipulations13–16 . It has
also been argued that protein folding processes may be
proceeding as in the Go-like models due to minimization of hindrances to folding17–22 . Large-scale conformational changes in proteins can be explored by multi-state
Go-type models23,24 and mixed elastic network models25 .
In contrast, standard elastic network models, which are
less demanding computationally than molecular dynamics simulations, are known to capture local fluctuations
about the native state26 . Here, we employ a standard
Go-type model to examine thermal stability, local flexibility, collective motions and unfolding kinetics of CS
enzymes functioning in organisms that live in very different environmental conditions.
The adaptations of life to different environmental conditions can be observed at various levels of organization, including the molecular level. The composition and
structure of proteins from organisms living under extreme
conditions27–29 are known to correlate with the character
of the environment. For instance, thermophilic organisms, i.e. those thriving between 45◦ C and 120◦ C, tend

2
to contain proteins with smaller cavities, bigger number of ionic bonds, increased polarity of exposed surfaces, an increased content of charged residues and tryptophan, and a smaller content of phenylalanine, methionine and asparagine compared to proteins in mesophilic
organisms30–33 . On the other hand, cryophilic organisms, i.e. those which grow and reproduce between about
-20◦ C to +10◦ C, tend to contain proteins with larger
catalytic cavities, reduced content of proline and arginine
(to make the backbone more flexible), increased content
of clusters of glycines, less hydrophobic cores (to make
the protein less compact), a higher proportion of nonpolar groups on the surface, and an increased content of
negative charges on the surface (to facilitate interactions
with the solvent)34–37 . Structure-based models cannot
explicitly take all of these many detailed chemical features into account, but these features lead to a particular structure of the native conformation. Therefore, such
models can tell the thermophilic and cryophilic proteins
apart even if they belong to the same fold. We shall inquire here – to what extent. These models also identify
properties that are similar. We illustrate these aspects
here by considering CS.
CS is an α-protein homodimer. Fig. 1 shows an example of the native conformation – it is for CS from
Pyrococcus furiosus with the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
code 1AJ8 and atomic coordinates resolved for 741 amino
acids38 . It is formed of two identical subunits, each with
its own active site. Each of the subunits comprises two
domains – a small domain, which comprises five α-helices,
and and a large domain which contains 13 α-helices. In
other species, the number of the helices in the large domain varies between 11 and 15. The substrate binding
site is located in a cleft between the two domains.
Two kinds of conformations of CS have been identified: one is termed ’open’ and the other ’closed’. CS is
in the ’open’ conformation when the active site is not
occupied and is thus free to bind substrate molecules for
the enzyme catalysis. When the substrate binds, the
small domain undergoes a rotation, sealing the substrate
binding site and forming the ’closed’ conformation. A
number of crystal structures of CS from different organisms are available in the PDB. The five structures we
have considered in our study are summarized in Table I.
It would be ideal to also consider an open form of CS
form a cryophilic organism, but they do not seem to be
available in the PDB.

METHODS

We use a coarse-grained continuum representation for
CS configurations in which only the positions of Cα
atoms are retained in the molecular dynamics simulations. However, the contact map, i.e. a list of nonbonded interactions is determined based on the all-atom
coordinates. The configurational energy of the model

Here, r and r0 denote the distances between two subsequent residues at configurations X and X0 , respectively,

3
where the reference configuration X0 corresponds to the
native state. The summation over bonds includes peptide
and disulfide bonds (the latter are present in 2IBP, one
in each monomer). Analogously, φ and φ0 represent the
bond angles formed by three subsequent residues along
the amino acid chain at configurations X and X0 , respectively. Next, θ and θ0 are the dihedral angles formed by
four sequential residues at configurations X and X0 . The
coupling parameters in the first three terms in Eq. (1) are
taken to be as in Ref.8 , i.e., Kr = 100 ǫ/Å2 , Kθ = 20 ǫ,
(1)
(3)
Kφ = ǫ, and Kφ = ǫ/2.
The fourth term in Eq. (1) describes the native interactions. Here, rij and r0ij denote the distances at
configurations X and X0 , respectively, between residues
i and j forming the native contacts. The native contacts
are identified as in Ref.13,14,42 , i.e., by using an overlap
criterion43 applied to the coordinates of all heavy atoms
in the native structure. The heavy atoms are assigned
enlarged van der Waals spheres and if there is a pair of
atoms for which one finds spheres that overlap in the native state then the corresponding pair of amino acids is
considered as forming a native contact. Physically, these
contacts are due to hydrogen bonds and ionic bridges.
Only contacts with |i − j| > 3 are included in the contact map. The last term in Eq. (1) describes repulsion
between non-native contacts, with ρ0 = 4 Å.
The model described by Eq. (1) is different from the
one used in our recent studies of protein stretching13–15 :
the contact potential is of the 10-12 type, and not 6-12,
and the local backbone stiffness is given by the usual
bond-angle and dihedral-angle potentials instead of a
term involving the local chirality (which effectively includes the dihedral term but not the bond angle terms11 ).
The 6-12 model yields amino-acid positional fluctuations substantially larger than those found in experiments
through the temperature factors, and coming close to the
experimental data requires rescaling as in Ref.44 . Nevertheless, we expect that the calibration of ǫ is of the same
order, i.e. ǫ ≈ 110 pN Å. Thus the room temperature
should be in the vicinity of 0.35 ǫ/kB , where kB denotes
the Boltzmann constant.
In our coarse-grained simulations, the citrate and CoA
molecules (present in the closed structures of CS) are represented by one and four beads, respectively. The contacts between CS and citrate, and between CS and CoA,
are found using the same all-atom overlap criterion as
the native contacts between the amino acids within CS.
To avoid dissociation of the citrate and CoA molecules
from CS during simulations, these contacts are replaced
by harmonic bonds analogous to the Cα -Cα pseudobonds
with the spring constant Kr = 100 ǫ/Å2 .
To study thermodynamic properties of the CS dimers,
we performed overdamped Langevin dynamics simulations using in-house software15,42 . The simulations were
carried out at 31 different temperatures T distributed
uniformly in the interval from 0.1 ǫ/kB to 0.7 ǫ/kB . Each
simulation was 105 τ long and it was preceded by a 104 τ
equilibration run. The unit of time, τ , is of order 1 ns. At

these temperatures and time scales the dimers never dissociate or unfold. We observe only small and moderate
deviations from the native state as measured by RMSD,
see Figs. 2b and 3b in the next section.
In the course of the simulations, we monitor the number of contacts
m(t) =

M

θ (dij − rij (t))

(2)

i=1

where M is the total number of contacts in the native
state, rij (t) is the distance between residues i and j at
simulation time t, dij = 1.2 r0ij is a cutoff distance, and
θ is the the Heaviside function: θ(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0 and
θ(x) = 0 if x < 0. To assess thermal stability of the enzyme, we compute the probability of finding the enzyme
in the native state
P0 = hδm,M i

(3)

as a function of temperature T , where the brackets denote time average after equilibration, and δm,M is the
Kronecker delta: δm,M = 1 if m = M and δm,M = 0 otherwise. Notice that the definition of P0 involves counting
conformations in which all native contacts are present.
The native state probability as given by Eq. (3) is thus
different from the average fraction of contacts

We define temperature of thermodynamical stability, Tf ,
as one at which P0 = 21 . This temperature is different
and substantially lower than the temperature at which
Q = 21 . Our definition of Tf yields values of T that are
in a vicinity of temperatures at which smaller proteins
fold optimality42 .
To describe how far a particular configuration has departed from the native state, we compute the root mean
square deviation

RMSD fluctuates around its average value, hRMSDi,
which is a function of temperate T .

ri i is the displacement from the average position computed after superimposing on the native structure. Significant positive correlations mean that
the residues tend to move together, possibly as part of a
larger structural motif. Negative correlations imply that
the two residues tend to move in opposite directions.
To study thermal unfolding and dissociation of the CS
dimers, we performed overdamped Langevin dynamics
simulations at elevated temperatures T between 1.1 ǫ/kB
and 1.7 ǫ/kB . At each of temperatures we run 200 trajectories to study kinetics of the unfolding and dissociation
processes.

FIG. 2. Thermodynamic properties of citrate synthase from
thermophilic (1AJ8, dashed lines), mesophilic (2CTS, dotted lines) and cryophilic (1A59, thin solid lines) organisms in
the closed conformation. (a) The probability of finding the
enzyme in the native state, P0 , (b) the average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) from the native state, (c) the average internal energy per residue, and (d) the average radius of
gyration, hRg i, as functions of temperature T .

We first compare some thermodynamic properties of
the CS dimers from thermophilic and cryophilic organisms in the closed conformation (PDB codes 1AJ8 and

1A59, respectively). Fig. 2a shows that, at any a given
T , the probability P0 of finding the enzyme in the native state is larger for the thermophilic CS than for
the cryophilic one. In particular, Tf is 0.303 ǫ/kB and
0.287 ǫ/kB for the thermophilic and cryophilic CS dimers,
respectively. With our calibration of ǫ, the difference is
of order 14◦ C.
Fig. 2b shows that, at any given T , hRMSDi is larger
for the cryophilic CS than for the thermophilic one. Thus
the cryophilic CS undergoes larger thermal fluctuations
than the thermophilic CS at the same T . The internal energy per residue, shown in Fig 2c, is lower by about 0.2 ǫ
for the thermophilic CS compared to the cryophilic CS,
independent of the value of T . This result is consistent
with the data in Fig.2a showing that the thermophilic CS
exhibits better thermal stability than the thermophilic
CS.
Interestingly, the thermophilic CS appears slightly
more compact than the cryophilic CS, as evidenced by the
time-averaged radius of gyration, hRg i, plotted against
T , see Fig. 2d (note that these two dimers comprise comparable numbers of residues, 740 and 754, respectively).
The difference in hRg i is about 0.4 Å or about 1.5% of
the native Rg . We have checked that, at a given temperature T in the range between 0.1 ǫ/kB and 0.7 ǫ/kB ,
the standard deviation of the instantaneous Rg values
is smaller than 0.1 Å, both for the cryophilic and thermophilic forms of CS. Thus the observed difference in the
values of hRg i is small but statistically relevant.
We next discuss the thermodynamic properties of the
mesophilic CS in the closed conformation (with the PDB
code 2CTS). We find that, at any given temperature, P0
for the mesophilic CS is smaller than for the thermophilic
one and only slightly bigger than for the cryophilic CS,
see Fig. 2a. Its stability temperature is Tf = 0.289 ǫ/kB .
The stability difference, as measured by alterations in
Tf , between the thermophilic and mesophilic CS dimers
in the closed conformation is of order of 12◦ C.
Interestingly, out of the three CS dimers in the closed
conformation, the mesophilic one shows the fastest increase in hRMSDi with T , see Fig. 2b. At any given T ,
the internal energy per residue for the mesophilic and
cryophilic CS dimers in the closed conformation are almost the same, see Fig. 2c. This observation is consistent with the results shown in Fig.2a, namely, that
these two forms are characterized by very similar P0 (T )
curves. The mesophilic CS dimer comprises 874 amino
acid residues whereas its cryophilic and thermophilic homologues – only 754 and 740 residues, respectively. This
explains why the mesophilic form has the larges radius
of gyration, as shown in Fig. 2d.
We next compare the thermodynamic properties of CS
dimers from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms in
the open conformation (PDB codes 2IBP and 1CTS,
respectively). As shown in Fig. 3a, the thermophilic
CS exhibits larger P0 (T ) and is thus thermodynamically
more stable than the mesophilic CS. The values of Tf
are 0.285 ǫ/kB and 0.274 ǫ/kB for the thermophilic and

system. Table II demonstrates that the values of Tf correlate with z both in the open and closed conformation.
The coordination number can be determined both for
the dimers and individual monomers. The corresponding quantities zdimer and zmonomer differ because there
are contacts formed at the interface of the two monomers.
The number of the interfacial contacts in 1AJ8 is 289; in
2CTS it is 302, whereas in 1A59 it is only 266. For the
closed forms the numbers are 322 for 2IBP and 252 for
1CTS. Whichever quantity one takes, zdimer or zmonomer,
the correlation with Tf is evident, which indicates that
both bulk and interfacial contacts contribute to the larger
stability of the thermophilic forms. The larger value of z
is also consistent with the tighter packing of residues in
thermophilic enzymes.
It is interesting to ask whether the stability temperature is correlated with the average contact order
CO =

mesophilic CS, respectively. The difference is of order
10◦ C. Fig. 3b shows that the mesophilic CS exhibits
larger hRMSDi(T ) and is thus more susceptible for thermal fluctuations than the thermophilic CS. A larger thermal stability of the thermophilic CS can be also inferred
from Fig. 3c which shows the internal energy per residue
as a function of T . We note also that the thermophilic
CS is more compact than than the mesophilic CS, see
Fig. 3d. Overall, we observe that the qualitative differences between the proteins belonging to the organisms
preferring high and low temperatures do not depend on
whether the structures are closed or open.
It is instructive to compare the open and closed CSs
from the same organism (with PDB codes 1CTS and
2CTS, respectively). We note that the closed form is
more compact than the open one. Its radius of gyration is smaller by 1.2 Å. The closed form exhibits a
slower decrease of P0 with T . As mentioned before, Tf
is 0.289 ǫ/kB for the closed form and 0.274 ǫ/kB for the
open one. Since the two forms have identical sequences,
the difference in Tf should be related to the number of
native contacts, which is 2060 in the open conformation
and 2138 in the closed conformation.
The higher thermodynamic stability of the thermophilic proteins is expected and required by the function. It is interesting to ask, however, what features of
the native structure encode this information. It has been
shown recently, in a similar model, that effective stiffness
of virus capsids, as measured in nanoindentation experiments, correlates with average coordination number, z 46 .
Specifically, the corresponding Young modulus is proportional to (z − 6)2 . The average coordination number is
defined as
z=2

#native contacts + #bonds
#residues

(9)

and it describes how many neighbors, on an average, any
residue has. It is determined in the native state and the
notion of neighborhood relates to the dynamics of the

(10)

Here, N is the number of residues in an amino acid chain,
where M is the total number of the native contacts, and
∆ij = |i − j| is the sequence separation between residues
i and j that form a native contact. Note that the contact
order is uniquely defined only for single amino acid chains
(monomers). The values of the average contact order as
calculated from the contact maps of the five CS forms are
given in the last column of Table II. Interestingly, we find
no correlation between CO and Tf . A similar conclusion
has been reached in Ref.47 .
B.

The temperature factors and RMSF

To validate our simulations, we compare experimental and simulational temperature factors of the different CSs, see Fig. 4. The simulations have been done at
T = 0.3 ǫ/kB which is close to Tf . Although the temperature factors in a crystal may in general differ from
those in a solution, this approach has been widely used
to parametrize elastic network models26 .
We obtain very good agreement for the 2IBP and 1A59
structures, see panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 4. For 1AJ8,
see Fig. 4(c), the simulation pattern closely resembles
the distribution of the crystallographic β factors but its
magnitude is too small. However, simulations at T =
0.4 ǫ/kB fit the experiment much better, see the blue line
in Fig 4(c). We do not compare results for 1CTS because
the resolution of the mesophilic CS structure in the open
conformation (1CTS) is only 2.7 Å. The resolution for
the structures of 2IBP, 1A59, and 1AJ8 is much better
and is equal to 1.6 Å, 2.1 Å, and 1.9 Å respectively.
We note that the average crystallographic β factor,
PN

β̄ = N1
i=1 βi , is β̄ = 21 Å for the thermophilic CS in
the closed conformation (1AJ8), and β̄ = 14 Å2 for the

residues that bind citrate (indicated by the vertical lines
in Fig. 4) have relatively small temperature factors.
When one compares the β factors of the thermophilic
and cryophilic proteins in the closed conformation, see
panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 4, then they are seen to map
out very similar looking patterns no matter whether one
uses the experimental results at the room temperature
(red solid lines in Fig. 4) or the simulational results at
T = 0.3 ǫ/kB (black dashed lines in Fig. 4). When δi
or βi are calculated at a higher T for the thermophilic
form and at a lower T for the cryophilic form then the
match in the patterns is better quantitatively. Fig. 4(d)
compares δi for 1AJ8 and 1A59 at their respective stability temperatures. The amplitudes of the fluctuations
are seen to be comparable.

ported to be obtained at the room temperature. The experimental data would thus imply that the thermophilic
CS is, on average, more flexible than its cryophilic homologue at the same temperature. One would certainly
expect the opposite relation. This inconsistency might be
a reason for the quantitative disagreement between simulations and experiment in the case of 1AJ8, see Fig. 4(c).
In all of the analyzed structures, the residues that
have the largest β factors are localized in the small domain (the region highlighted in Fig. 4), primarily in the

Fluctuations of the active site

The citrate binding site comprises seven evolutionarily conserved amino acids: three histidine residues, three

depicted in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table S1 which is
provided in Supplementary Material53 . Three of them,
which we denote here as His2 , His3 and Asp1 , are directly
involved in the chemical reaction that results in citrate
formation49 . They are highlighted in Table S153 in bold.
His3 , Arg1 and Aps1 reside in the small domain. His1 ,
His2 , Arg2 and Arg3 are located in the large domain (His2
is at the N-terminal end of the large domain). Arg3 is
the only citrate-binding residue that resides on the other
monomer.
In Fig. 4 the citrate binding residues are labeled with
vertical lines. All of them exhibit relatively small spatial
fluctuations, as indicated by low β factors. Fig. 6 shows
the RMSFs of these seven amino acid residues as a function of T . In the closed conformation, the active site in
the thermophilic and cryophilic enzymes fluctuate in the
same manner although, for any fixed T , the magnitude of
fluctuations is somewhat larger in the cryophilic CS, see
panels c and d in Fig. 6. The residues that exhibit largest
RMSFs are Arg1 , Arg3 and His1 . The residues that fluctuate most weakly are His2 , Asp1 and His3 , which happen
to be the three amino acids that are directly involved in
the chemical reaction of citrate formation.

manner but quite differently than in the closed conformation, see panels a and b in Fig 6. Here, the residues
that fluctuate the most are His3 and Asp1 , which are involved in the reaction of citrate formation. The residues
that exhibit smallest fluctuations are Arg2 and His1 . Also
the magnitude of RMSFs is larger than in the closed conformation.
Interestingly, the three residues involved directly in the
catalytic activity, His3 , His2 and Asp1 , exhibit rather
small thermal fluctuations in the closed conformation,
whereas in the open conformation the thermal fluctuations of these three residues are significantly enhanced.
This result seems consistent with the division of functions
between residues in the active site: some amino acids are
tailored to binding the substrate, whereas others participate in the catalytic process.

Our results at temperatures between 0.35 and

show that at T = 300 K the RMSFs of the active site
residues in contact with the citrate molecule are in the

and variation of distances (lower panels) between the seven
residues forming the active site in the open conformation.
The results were obtained in simulations of the thermophilic
(left panels) and mesophilic (right panels) CS dimers at
T = 0.3 ǫ/kB . The largest positive correlations and the smallest distance variations are shown as red circles. The negative
correlations and the largest distance variations are shown as
blue squares. The intermediate cases are indicated by black
crosses.

In order to identify collective motions of the active site
residues, we compute the equal-time correlation coefficients Cij as defined in Eq. (8) for all pairs (i, j) of the
residues forming the active site. The upper panels of
Fig. 7 show correlation levels of these pairs in the thermophilic (left panel) and mesophilic (right panel) enzymes in the open conformation. The positive correlations with Cij > 0.15 are labeled with red circles and
indicate that the pairs of residues often move together
in the same direction. The negative correlations are depicted as blue squares and indicate that the pairs have a
tendency to move simultaneously in opposite directions.

large domain, and the active site residues have no freedom to perform any large-amplitude motions. Therefore,
the residues in the small domain are positively correlated
with those in the large domain. Interestingly, the active
sites in the thermophilic and cryophilic CS exhibit the
same pattern of correlations, see the top panels in Fig. S1.

Another way to assess thermal stability of proteins is
to simulate their unfolding at elevated temperatures as
analyzed theoretically in Ref.50 . The unfolding simulations start at the native state and finish when all nonlocal contacts get broken, which defines the unfolding time
tunf . Specifically, the nonlocality refers to the sequential
distance |i − j| > l. We take l = 10 in this study. In
Ref.50 , l has been taken to be 4 to eliminate the local
contacts in α-helices, but this choice is too demanding
computationally in the current context.
We performed unfolding simulations at high temperatures only for the CS dimers in the open conformation because dissociation of the citrate and CoA molecules from
CS occurs much faster than protein unfolding or dimer
dissociation (kinetic constants for the successive steps of
the CS reaction at physiological conditions are detailed,
for example, in Ref.51 ). At any given T between 1.1 ǫ/kB
and 1.7 ǫ/kB , we run 200 trajectories. We checked that
tunf < 25000 τ in all the simulation trajectories.

# trajectories

The results shown in Fig. 7 were obtained in simulations at temperature T = 0.3 ǫ/kB but we checked that
the same correlation pattern persists at temperatures between 0.2 ǫ/kB and 0.5 ǫ/kB .
Interestingly, all the active site residues that are located in the small domain, His3 , Arg1 and Asp1 , appear
to move together as a unit, which is indicated by significant positive correlations for all the three residue pairs.
The three residues in the small domain exhibit motions
that are anti-correlated with the motions of His2 and
Arg3 , which are placed in the large domain. Therefore,
the collective motions of the active site in the open conformation seem to be due to the displacements of the
small domain relative to the large domain.
To further quantify this observation we compute the
variations of the inter-residue distances, δdij = h(dij −
hdij i)2 i1/2 , where hdij i is the average distance between
residues i and j forming the active site. The lower panels
of Fig. 7 illustrate the distance variations in the open conformation of the thermophilic (left panel) and mesophilic
(right panel) enzymes. The smallest distance variations
(red circles) are observed for the residue pairs that exhibit
correlated motions with Cij > 0.15. The largest distance
variations (blue squares) are observed almost exclusively
for the residue pairs that exhibit negative spatial correlations and, thus, have the propensity to move in opposite directions. Importantly, these results show that the
motions of largest amplitudes occur primarily between
the residues located in different domains, and the smallamplitude motions are mainly between the residues residing in the same domains.
In the open conformation of the thermophilic CS,
we can distinguish three groups of spatially-correlated
residues: the first group comprises the three residues in
the small domain, Arg1 , His3 and Asp1 ; the second group
consists of His1 and Arg2 ; and the third group is His2 and
Arg3 . Within each of the groups, the individual residues
show a propensity to move jointly with other group members. For example, His1 and Arg2 often move together in
the same direction (Cij = 0.26) but almost independently
from other residues of the active site. Interestingly, all
the residues in the first group are spatially anti-correlated
with the residues in the third group. These two groups
can be thus visualized as the lower and upper ’jaws’ moving in an up-and-down manner.
In the open conformation of the mesophilic CS, we observe more correlations between the active site residues
present in the large domain. Here, the ’upper jaw’ (His2
and Arg3 ) appears to be connected more stiffly to the
’hinge’ (His1 and Arg2 ) but performs even larger motions (δdij > 0.2 Å) against the ’lower jaw’ (Arg1 , His3
and Asp1 ).
In the closed conformation, both in the thermophilic
and cryophilic enzymes, we observe only positive correlations, Cij > 0, and rather small inter-residue distance
variations, δdij < 0.07 Å, see Fig. S1 in Supplementary
Material53 . Here, due to the presence of the citrate and
CoA molecules, the small domain is tightly bound to the

zyme is more resistant to thermal denaturation. Also,
the histograms seem to display multi-peak profiles, which
suggests that there might be more than one characteristic time scale governing the thermal unfolding of the CS
dimers. To further characterize the unfolding kinetics, it
is instructive to calculate the fraction of the number of
trajectories, φf (t), in which the unfolding event has not
occurred within time t from the beginning of the simulation. The fraction φf (t) provides an estimate for the
probability of not unfolding CS within time t. As can be
seen in Fig. S253 , there is an initial lag phase in which
φf (t) = 1. The lag phase is followed by a fast decrease
of φf (t). Interestinlgy, we find that the decay of φf with
t is not exponential.
The right-hand-side panel of Fig. 8 shows the average
unfolding time, htunf i, as a function of T . The average is
taken over 200 trajectories. The error bars correspond to
the standard error of the mean. At any specified temperature, the thermophilic CS (2IBP) exhibits significantly
larger unfolding time than the mesophilic CS (1CTS).
This result shows that the thermophilic enzyme is thermally more stable than its mesophilic homologue. Based
on the dependence of htunf i on T as shown in Fig. 8,
the difference in stability temperatures is of the order
0.1 ǫ/kB , which corresponds to about 80◦ C.
We use an analogous method to quantify thermal dissociation of CS dimers. The dynamics of the system is
exactly the same as in the unfolding simulations but only
the contacts between the monomers are monitored. The
simulations start at the native state and finish when all
contacts between the monomers get broken, which defines
the unbinding time tunb . In the range of temperatures
studied, tunb < 25000 τ in all the trajectories.

The left panels of Fig. 9 show histograms of the unbinding time for the thermophilic (2IBP) and mesophilic
(1CTS) CS in the open conformation at T = 1.11 ǫ/kB
and T = 1.18 ǫ/kB , respectively. These data show that

the thermophilic dimer is more resistant to thermal dissociation. To characterize the dissociation kinetics, we
compute the fraction of the number of trajectories, φb (t),
in which the unbinding event has not occurred within
time t. Fig. S253 shows φb (t) for 2IBP and 1CTS at different temperatures. We note that the decay of φb with
t is not exponential.
The right panel of Fig. 9 shows the average unbinding time, htunb i, as a function of T . The average is taken
over 200 trajectories, and the error bars correspond to the
standard error of the mean. At any given temperature,
htunb i of the thermophilic CS dimer (2IBP) is significantly larger than that of the mesophilic enzyme (1CTS).
Interestingly, the two plots of htunb i versus T overlap
if the temperature is shifted by about 0.07 ǫ/kB . This
temperature shift corresponds roughly to 60◦ C, which
is consistent with the difference in the optimal growth
temperatures, see Table I.

SUMMARY

We performed Langevin dynamics simulations of CS
dimers from thermophilic, mesophilic and cryophilic organisms using a coarse-grained structure-based model
that does not differentiate between the ionic, hydrophobic or van der Waals interactions. In fact, the interactions between different amino acid residues are described
in this model by the same potential energy function. Although this model might seem oversimplified, it correctly
predicts that the thermophilic CS is thermally more stable than the mesophilic and cryophilic ones. It also yields
root-mean-square fluctuates of single amino acid residues
that are fully consistent with crystallographic temperature factors. Therefore, the precise location of the amino
acid contacts appears to be a key element in explaining thermodynamic properties and local flexibility of enzymes.
The difference of the thermodynamical stability temperatures, ∆Tf , can be obtained from the native state
probabilities (see section III A). For the CS dimers from
thermophilic and cryophilic organisms in the closed conformation we obtain ∆Tf ≈ 14◦ C; for the thermophilic
and mesophilic CS dimers in the open conformation we
get ∆Tf ≈ 10◦ C. These values are smaller than expected. The expected difference in melting temperatures
between the mesophilic and thermophilic CS dimers is
about 20◦ C as reported in a recent study52 . The likely
reason for the fact that our model underestimates the
transition temperature differences is that it lacks some
relevant sequence effects. As discussed in section II, the
atomic structures of the CS proteins are used in the Gotype model only to construct the contact maps whereas
the chemical composition of the proteins is not directly
included in the energy function of the model as given by
Eq. (1).
The temperature of optimal folding, Tf , is one measure of the thermodynamic stability of proteins. Another

10
measure is provided by the kinetics of thermal unfolding
(see section III E). These two measures are quite different as they refer to equilibrium properties near the native
state and dynamic properties away from the native state,
respectively. One measures the frequency of the situations in which all contacts are present simultaneously,
and the other focuses on rupture events up to a given
sequential length. The stability temperature difference
obtained from the thermal unfolding of CS dimers from
thermophilic and mesophilic organisms (see Fig. 8) is of
the order of 80◦ C. We note that this value can be affected
by the partition of the native contacts into local and nonlocal (we used the sequential distance cut-off l = 10 in
our analysis). On the other hand, the stability temperature difference obtained from the thermal dissociation of
CS dimers from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms
is about 60◦ C (see Fig. 9). We note that this value is
unaffected by the choice of the sequential distance cutoff, l, as we take into account all inter-monomer contacts
in the analysis of the simulation data. Interestingly, this
temperature difference, 60◦ C, is consistent with the difference in the optimal growth temperatures as given in
Table I.
We analyzed thermal fluctuates and collective motions
of the active site in CS enzymes from different organisms, both in the open and closed conformations. We
find that the three residues that are directly involved in
the chemical reaction of citrate formation exhibit rather
small fluctuations in the closed conformation. In the
open conformation, however, the thermal fluctuations of
these three residues are significantly enhanced. We also
find that the collective motions of the active site in the
open conformation are mainly due to the movements of
the small domain relative to the large domain. In the
open conformation, due to the presence of the citrate and
CoA molecules, the small domain is tightly bound to the
large domain, and the active site residues have no freedom to perform any large-amplitude collective motions.
Taken together, our results show that the relatively simple structure-based model correctly captures the similarities and differences in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the different forms of the CS enzyme.
