Abstract
This paper presents a compact programmable biphasic stimulator for cochlear implants. By
employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of the current generator is
increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of the output transistor. To make the
stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation current is set by scaling a reference current using a
two stage binary-weighted transistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a
4 bit low-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the area of the
circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented in AMS 0.18µm highvoltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of about 0.042mm2. Measurement results
show that proper charge balance of the anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a
dc blocking capacitor can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the
proposed system suitable for a large number of channels.

1. Introduction
A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted electronic device that bypasses the
damaged parts of the inner ear and directly stimulates the remaining hearing nerve fibers in the
cochlea with electrical signals [1]. In general, a cochlear implant consists of an external part and
an internal part. The external part comprises: 1) a microphone, which picks up sound from the
environment; 2) a speech processor which selectively filters sound to prioritize audible speech,
splits the sound into channels and sends the electrical sound signals through a thin cable to the
transmitter; and 3) a transmitter, which is a coil held in position by a magnet placed behind the
outer ear, that transmits power and the processed sound signals through the skin to the internal
part. The internal part comprises: 1) a receiver and a stimulator that convert the signals into
electric impulses and sends them through an internal cable to the electrodes; 2) an electrode array
inserted inside the cochlea, which sends the impulses to the nerves in the scala tympani and then

1

directly to the brain through the auditory nerve system. Generally, users can understand speech
by using the device in a clean environment, i.e., without background noise or when
communicating via the telephone.
This paper will focus on the stimulator that is responsible for generating electric pulses.
Since the stimulator is implanted inside the body, a small size and a low power consumption are
critical requirements, especially if a large number of channels is preferred. Moreover, the circuit
must be able to provide charge-balanced stimulation in order to prevent tissue damage [2]. A
current mode stimulator seems to be an attractive method because the amount of charge injected
into the tissue can easily be defined by the current amplitude and the duration of the pulses.
Several current mode stimulators have been reported thus far. Stimulators based on a current
mirror circuit have been widely used [3]-[12]. To maintain constant current stimulation, wideswing and regulated cascode current mirror topologies are used but these limit the voltage
compliance. Moreover, when using a dual supply with two current sources to create the
stimulator, additional circuitry to match the two current sources is needed to ensure charge
cancellation [4]-[6]. A voltage-controlled resistor based implementation has been presented in [7]
to achieve a high voltage compliance but it needs additional circuitry to reduce non-linearity. A
blocking capacitor free stimulator using dynamic current matching is a useful idea to reduce the
size of the implant and preserve a charge error less than 6pC [8]. However, a dual supply is used
and additional circuitry is needed in this method.
Another issue is related to making the output current programmable. In many cases a digitalto-analog converter (DAC) is used to generate a programmable reference current [3]-[5], [9],[10].
Then, a current mirror replicating or scaling the reference current is used to provide the
stimulation current. All these system blocks consume power and area. It has therefore been
suggested to combine the DAC function into the output current stage in order to reduce the
complexity and minimize the silicon area and power consumption [11]. Our work has adopted
this suggestion and tackles several other drawbacks mentioned in the previous paragraph.
In this paper, a current mode, biphasic neural stimulator for application in cochlear implants
is proposed. It uses a compact stimulator circuit, avoids the use of external blocking capacitors by
achieving a good charge balance and thereby allows an increase in the number of stimulator
channels. By using a double-loop negative feedback topology, the output impedance of the
current source can be maximized while only one effective drain-source voltage drop (Veff) is
required. This means that more voltage headroom at the tissue is achieved and more charge can
be conveyed into the tissue.
The circuit provides a programmable biphasic stimulator that includes the DAC function
embedded in the output current stage. By using a two stage binary-weighted transistor DAC
configuration (employing high-voltage and low-voltage DAC topologies), the settling time of the
stimulation pulse improves, and the area of the circuit is minimized.
Moreover, by using a single current source from a single supply, we achieve charge-balanced
stimulation during every stimulation cycle and avoid the need for a dual supply. A switch array is
used to reverse the current direction.
The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows. Section 2 presents the system
design of the proposed stimulator. Section 3 describes the circuit implementation and the
fabrication of the proposed stimulator. The measurement results are presented in Section 4. The
conclusions are given in the final section.

2. System design
The stimulator uses a single supply and a single current source stimulation scheme as
depicted in Fig. 1(a). The configuration consists of three main parts, the load, ZL, representing
the tissue and the electrode-tissue interface, the switch array (S1, S2, and S3) and the current
source, Istim. The individual parts will be described in the following subsections.
2.1 Electrode-Tissue Interface Model
The load of the stimulator comprises the tissue and the electrode-tissue interface which can
be modeled in the electrical domain. In this work a simple model is used as shown in Fig. 1(b)
[13]. Rs corresponds to the resistance of the electrode leads and the tissue. In practice the
resistance of the electrolyte (the tissue) will be much higher and is therefore the dominant
component. Cdl and Rf correspond to the interface between the electrode and the tissue. Cdl is the
double-layer capacitance and Rf is the Faradaic resistance. For simplify, we assume that Rf
remains large (>1MΩ) during the stimulation pulse (<100µs), and can therefore be neglected.
The stimulator chip is designed for electrode-tissue impedances in the range of RS=1kΩ~10kΩ,
CL=1nF~10nF (RC series impedance in cochlear implants) [8].
2.2 Switch Array
The stimulation pattern is controlled by the switch array comprising switches S1, S2, and S3.
The principle of constant current biphasic stimulation can be described using Fig. 1(c). When
switches S1 are closed (tc) the current flows from A to C. When switches S2 are closed and S1 are
opened (ta) the current reverses its direction. An inter-phase delay (ti) is added between the
stimulation phases when switches S1 and S2 are opened. Switch S3 is used to short circuit and thus
passively discharge the tissue. The advantage of using the switch array for performing both
anodic and cathodic current injection is that only a single voltage supply is needed. Also, since
only one source is used, the currents are easily matched during both phases.
2.3 High Output Resistance Current Source
A straightforward implementation of a current driver uses a current mirror which is often
cascoded in order to have a sufficiently high output resistance [14]. Fig. 2(a) shows the simplest

version of a PMOS cascode current mirror. A small reference current, IDAC, generated from a
digital to analog converter, is applied through diode connected transistors M1 and M4.
Subsequently, the current is scaled up by a factor n to become the stimulation current, Istim,
flowing through transistors M2, M3, and load ZL. In this case, the output resistance equals
gm3ro3ro2, where ro2 and ro3 are the output resistance of M2 and M3, respectively,
gm3=(2ID3KpW/L)0.5 is the transconductance of M3, where ID3 is the drain current through M3, Kp is
the intrinsic transconductance, and W and L are the width and length of M3, respectively.
However, the minimum required voltage across the current source (voltage drop, Vd) becomes
one source-gate voltage (VSG) plus one effective source-drain voltage (Veff). This limits the
voltage headroom VL and the amount of charge that can be conveyed to the tissue (load).
To increase VL, a current mirror employing active feedback to boost the output impedance
can be used. In Fig. 2(b), a high-gain amplifier, Av, is applied to make the drain voltage of M2
equal to the drain voltage of M1. The same biasing condition makes Istim n times IDAC. The output
resistance of the active feedback current generator is given by Avgm3 ro3ro2. This causes Vd to
become Veff3 + Veff2. Due to the fact that the output resistance of this mirror is higher than in the
previous cases but requires less Vd, this cascoded structure is popularly used in neural stimulation
[4],[15].
2.4 Proposed Current Source
In order to allow for an even higher VL, we proposed a high output impedance current source
that requires Vd to be only a single Veff [16],[17]. The concept of the proposed current source is
shown in Fig. 3(a). It contains two feedback loops. The first local one is used for high precision
down scaling of Istim (to Istim/n). Transistor M2 generates Istim flowing through ZL. The gate
terminal of transistor M1 is connected to the gate terminal of M2 to accurately scale down the
current flowing through M3 to summing node A. Based on the same principle as used for the
current mirror of Fig. 2(b), Av is used to force the drain terminals of M1 and M2 to be equal,
resulting in a very precisely copied current Istim/n flowing into node A. This current will be
compared with IDAC and an error current, Ie, equal to

the gate of M2 to produce Istim. Ie will be forced to be zero by the large loop gain of the second
global feedback loop creating a relationship of

We can simplify the feedback block diagram of the proposed circuit as shown in Fig. 3(b). The
loop gain of the system can be found to be

where Gm2 is the transconductance gain of transistor M2.
To maintain the desired current given by (2), LG needs to be as large as possible. Since Gm2
is limited by the values of Istim and the dimension of M2 and n is preferred to be high (10-100) to
keep the total power consumption low, a large Zm becomes the main factor that defines the
accuracy of the proposed circuit.
The simulated output current versus the voltage headroom of the three current source designs
VL, the simple cascode (Fig. 2(a)), the regulated cascode (Fig. 2(b)), and the proposed circuit
(Fig. 3(a)) is shown in Fig. 4(a). AMS 0.18µm high-voltage technology parameters were used for
circuit simulations. The simulation is performed using the same transistor dimensions for all three
designs. A high voltage supply (>10V) is needed to accommodate the maximum current required
(1mA) through the maximum load expected (< 20kΩ). VDD is set at 18V and IDAC is 50µA,
yielding Istim=1mA with a scaling factor of n = 20. Ideal op-amps with a gain Av = 200 are used
for the circuits in Figs. 2(b) and Fig. 3(a). VL was varied from 0 to 18 V with a 0.5V step size by
using an ideal voltage source, as we can see the proposed current source achieves a larger voltage
headroom than those of the others. This verifies that the proposed current source can inject more
charge into the tissue for the same supply voltage.

3. Circuit implementation
From the concept as described in the previous section, we have derived a programmable
biphasic stimulator circuit for cochlear implants. The design aims to support the flexible
electrode array as developed in the SMAC-It (Smart cochlear implants) project [18]. In order to
reduce the size and parasitic capacitances of the stimulator output transistor (M2), the proposed
current source was modified as shown in Fig. 4(b). Istim is created by scaling a reference current
(Iref) by scaling factors n and m of M7 and M2, respectively. Thereby Istim becomes
I stim = n ⋅ m ⋅ I ref .

(4)

To make n and m programmable M7 and M2 are implemented using a binary weighted DAC
scheme. The circuit diagram of the implemented stimulator circuit is shown in Fig. 5(a). This
requires the use of high-voltage (HV) transistors (indicated by the thick drain terminal) combined
6

with low-voltage (LV) transistors. To minimize the area occupied by the circuit, the number and
size of HV transistors used should be as small as possible. The design of the individual subcircuits will be described in the next subsections.
3.1 High-Voltage and Low-Voltage DAC Configuration
In order to create a 10µA resolution for a 1mA full-scale stimulation current, a 7-bit
resolution is required. The silicon area of the circuit can be minimized when using two stages in
cascade, a HV DAC and a LV DAC. The number of bits in the HV DAC should be as small as
possible. This will reduce the number of (large) HV transistors resulting in a smaller area as well
as a lower parasitic capacitance. However, a certain minimum equivalent transistor size is needed
to be able to supply the maximum stimulation current. In our design 3 bits for the HV DAC was
found to be optimal.
The remaining 4 bits can be implemented using LV transistors. These transistors are much
smaller, making the area contribution negligible compared to the area occupied by the HV DAC.
The reference current was chosen to be Iref = 10µA. By enabling one or more transistors in
the binary weighted DACs (using transistor switches), Istim can be made programmable using the
following relation:
 2
 3

I stim =  ∑ au 2u  ∑ al 2l  I ref ,
 u =0
 l =0


(5)

in which u and l are the bit-numbers of the enabled HV transistors M2 and LV transistors M7,
respectively. In this way the LV DAC can generate a current in steps of 10µA from 10µA to
150µA. The HV DAC can scale this current with a factor 1 up to 7, resulting in a maximum
stimulation current of 1.05mA.
3.2 Differential Amplifier Av
Amplifier Av is used in the feedback loop to control the drain voltage of M1. It is
implemented using a standard differential amplifier (using HV transistors) with an active load as
depicted in Fig. 5(b). An offset voltage source, Voff, is needed at the output of the amplifier to bias
the gate of M3 properly. It was implemented using a diode connected LV transistor chain and
current sources Is = 10µA. The minimum common mode input voltage that the amplifier can
handle is about 3V because of the biasing of the LV DAC. When Va < 3V an error is introduced
in the output current because VDS,M2≠VDS,M1. However this error is small because |VDS,M2| >>
|VDS,M1-VDS,M2|.
3.3 Switch Array
The implemented switch array is shown in Fig. 6(a). The upper switches can be implemented
using PMOS HV transistors. The minimum gate length (1.5µm) permitted by the process was
chosen to provide low on-resistance. A gate width of 50µm was chosen.
The lower switches are implemented using NMOS HV transistors. The gate lengths and
widths were chosen 1.5µm and 15µm, respectively. It should be noted that at node n the voltage
with respect to ground can become negative because of the charging of CL and the subsequent

reversed current direction during the charge cancellation phase. Therefore a substrate isolated
Schottky diode is placed in series to prevent leakage between the substrate and the drain of the
transistor. Switch S3 is implemented using back-to-back PMOS transistors with their source
terminals biased at VDD. The back-to-back configuration is necessary in order to allow for current
flow in both directions. Finally, a standard cross-coupled level shifter is used to convert a LV
control signal into a HV control signal,Vcontrol [19].
The dimensions of the transistors are indicated in Table 1 and were selected to suit their
application in fully implantable cochlear implants.
4. Measurement results
The stimulator circuit has been implemented in AMS 0.18µm HV CMOS technology. The
active area is approximately 200 µm × 210 µm. The layout capture and the micrograph of the
chip are depicted in Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c), respectively. From the layout it can be seen that the
HV transistors dominate the area. The area was minimized by implementing multiple HV
transistors in the same deep n-well whenever possible, e.g. in the HV DAC.
The measurement setup is presented in Fig. 7. An external 18V supply is used for the main
circuit. A 5V supply is used for powering the pad ring of the chip. The control of the HV and LV
DACs were set by DIP switches. Iref and Is were set at 10µA by a Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp
source meter. Finally, 5 digital outputs from an Arduino UNO microcontroller board were used
in order to control the timing and current direction of the switch array.

the stimulator.

4.1 Output DC Characteristic
First the accuracy of the stimulation current was measured. For this, the load was chosen to
be a single resistor RL=10 kΩ without a capacitor. The output current was measured using a
Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp source meter. Fig. 8(a) shows the measured output current versus
full-scale digital input code for the positive and negative stimulation direction, respectively. The
current values in both positive and negative directions are almost identical, which is required for
proper charge balancing. The percentage of current mismatch is 0.02% and 0.3% at the minimum
and maximum output current, respectively. The average percentage of current mismatch over the
entire digital input code is 0.05%. This is mainly because of the mismatch error at the most
significant bit transistors.
The measured output current versus output voltage at several stimulation current levels is
shown in Fig. 8(b). The output voltage was varied from 0 to 18V with a 0.5V step size by using a
Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp source meter as a voltage source. The voltage headroom is about
12.5V and 16.5V at maximum and minimum stimulation current, respectively. This value is
mainly limited due to the relatively small dimensions of the HV DAC transistors. The voltage
headroom can be increased by increasing the width of the HV DAC transistors. Moreover, the
voltage headroom also depends on the voltage across the switch array. This voltage is related to
the dimensions of the HV switch transistors in order to allow the maximum stimulation current to
pass through. In this design it also depends on the voltage across the Schottky diode. This diode
has a small (0.4V) voltage drop.
The output resistance calculated from the measurement results plotted in Fig. 8(b) is about 33
MΩ and 500kΩ at Istim=10µA and 1.05mA, respectively.
4.2 Biphasic Stimulation

Next, the chip was measured while providing a programmable biphasic stimulation current in
the range of Istim=10µA (minimum) to 1.05mA (maximum). The digital outputs from the
microcontroller board are used to control the timing of the biphasic waveform. The pulse widths

Istim = 50µA and 1.05mA at a 10 kΩ resistive load are shown in Fig. 9(a).
Fig. 9(b) shows the measured biphasic output voltages of Istim across a 10kΩ+10nF load. The
spikes due to switching, and consequently settling of the stimulator current sources (see the
magnified output voltage in Fig. 9(b) do not contribute to significant charge mismatch, as will be
discussed in the next section.
In order to test the stimulator in a realistic situation, the load was changed to a CI electrode
array in 0.9% saline solution. Clarion HiFocus Cochlear electrodes were used. These are
platinum iridium electrodes, produced by Advanced Bionics, used for studies in animal cochleae
and each electrode has an area of approximately 0.2 mm2. Fig. 10 shows the measured output
voltage across the two electrode sites at Istim=500µA, and 1.05mA. As can be seen from Fig. 10,
the circuit works as expected. The output voltage at the end of each stimulation cycle remains
constant and goes to zero without creating any voltage accumulation.
4.3 Charge Error
The residual voltage (Vresidual) at the end of the stimulation cycle has been measured to
determine the remaining charge imbalance. It was measured by connecting an instrumentation
amplifier (AD826) in parallel with CL. The output of the amplifier was connected to a 20-bit

analog to digital converter (ADC) card (APPLICOS model ATX7006). A shielding enclosure
(ground connected Faraday cage) was used to reduce the amount of noise picked up from the
environment. A computer running APPLICOS ATXView software was used to acquire, store and
analyze the data. The average DC offset voltage and noise in the data acquisition hardware was
measured before each residual voltage measurement and subsequently subtracted from the
acquired data. The charge error can be calculated by multiplying the measured residual voltage at
the end of stimulation cycle with the capacitive load value (Qerror = CLVresidual). The dc current
error is subsequently determined by dividing the charge error by the stimulation cycle time (Idc=
Qerror/tstim). Table 2 shows the computed charge errors and dc current errors for several values of
Istim at 10kΩ+10nF load. The pulse width was set to 50µs and the stimulation cycle to 600µs. For
Istim =1.05mA the pulse widths tc and ta were chosen to be 10µs to prevent clipping of Istim. The
results show that the charge error and DC current error stay well below the safety limits. The
specified industry limit on current mismatch in cochlear implants is 25 nA [20].
4.4 Current and Power Efficiency
For the maximum output current (Istim=1.05mA) through the maximum load (RL = 10kΩ), the
current efficiency (defined by the ratio of the load current and the supply current) is 87% as
shown in Fig. 11. The maximum power efficiency is found to be 61%. The power consumption is
dominated by the bias sources in the differential amplifier (30µA) and the current through the
DACs, depending on the number of bits enabled in the LV DAC (ranging from 40~158µA). The
measured quiescent current is 210µA which is limited by the biasing of M3. Note that all these
bias sources can be switched off when stimulation is not active, yielding very low static power
consumption.
4.5 Multichannel Operation
The proposed stimulator can be used for multichannel stimulation as shown in Fig. 12. The
reference circuit provides biasing quantities for the LV DAC, HV DAC and amplifier Zm, which
can be shared among stimulation channels. The control logic for setting the 7 bit current
amplitude and 3 bit current direction/pulse width are received from a programmable controller.

5. CONCLUSION
A compact programmable biphasic stimulator chip for cochlear implants has been presented
in this paper. A double loop negative feedback topology was employed to increase the output
impedance. The circuit can deliver stimulation amplitudes in the range of 10µA~1.05mA for a
wide range of electrode-tissue impedances: RL=1kΩ∼10kΩ, CL=1nF~10nF. The current error
(<1.6nA) was found to be well below the safety limits. It consumes a very small chip area
(0.042mm2) enabling many stimulation channels on a single die.
