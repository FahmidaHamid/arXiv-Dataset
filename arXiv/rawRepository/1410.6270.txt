Chlamydomonas shows both positive and negative phototaxis. It has a single eyespot near its
equator and as the cell rotates during forward motion the light signal received by the eyespot varies.
We use a simple mechanical model of Chlamydomonas that couples the flagellar beat pattern to the
light intensity at the eyespot to demonstrate a mechanism for phototactic steering that is consistent
with observations. The direction of phototaxis is controlled by a parameter in our model and the
steering mechanism is robust to noise. Our model shows switching between directed phototaxis
when the light is on and run-and-tumble behaviour in the dark.
Keywords: Cell locomotion, flagella, phototaxis

Physical models are useful for understanding complex
biological processes. For example, Berg and Purcell described how a microorganism could compare the concentration of chemoattractants over a time interval of a few
seconds [1]. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that
wild-type E. coli cells perform such comparisons [2, 3]. E.
coli swims with run-and-tumble motion and the cell uses
the temporal concentration comparisons to modify the
time between tumble events so that runs are longer when
the cell swims up the concentration gradient. Friedrich
and Jülicher described how larger microorganisms that
swim on noisy helical paths can navigate in a concentration gradient using a simple feedback mechanism [4].

the cell swims perpendicular to the incoming light, the
signal varies sinusoidally; when the cell swims parallel to
the light, the signal is constant.

In phototaxis, organisms move towards or away from a
light source. The flux of light is a vector quantity so the
orientation of an organism determines the measured intensity, whereas chemotaxing organisms measure a scalar
quantity. Observations show that Chlamydomonas exhibits run-and-tumble in the dark [5], but we do not
know of any observations of run-and-tumble motion during phototaxis. How can Chlamydomonas use run-andtumble as a search strategy in darkness, and stop tumbles
and steer directly towards or away from a light source?
A model of Chlamydomonas also needs to swim at low
Reynolds number, which is non-trivial [6], and have synchronized flagella during runs [5]. It would be remarkable
to bundle all these complex engineering requirements into
one simple model. We develop a simple model with coupling to the light intensity at the eyespot and intrinsic
noise to investigate how Chlamydomonas could produce
these behaviours.

Rüffer and Nultsch performed high-speed cinematography photoresponse experiments on fixed cells to study
the change in beat frequency and pattern in response
to step-up and step-down white light stimuli [17]. They
observed two step-up responses and two step-down responses; they suggest that the different responses to each
type of stimulus correspond to positive and negative phototaxis. They observed that the cis and trans flagellum
have the same frequency response, however, the beat amplitude of the cis and trans flagella changed in the opposite sense. For ‘type (+)’ cells, on step-up stimuli the
amplitude of the trans flagellum increases and the amplitude of the cis flagellum decreases; for ‘type (-)’ cells,
on step-up stimuli the amplitude of the trans flagellum
decreases and the amplitude of the cis flagellum increases
(vice versa for step-down stimuli). These results were
confirmed by subsequent measurements with better sensitivity and allowed simultaneous measurements of photocurrents [18, 19]. A mutant strain ptx1 does not show
phototaxis: the two flagella show the same amplitude
response [20, 21].

Chlamydomonas is a photosynthetic unicellular alga
that shows both positive and negative phototaxis. It detects light with an eyespot near the cell’s equator, offset
about 45◦ ahead of the flagellar beat plane (the y-z plane
shown in figure 1(a)). It is interesting that evolution has
placed the eyespot on the side of the cell instead of the
anterior or posterior. The equatorial position is advantageous because Chlamydomonas rotates about its body
during forward swimming, allowing the eyespot to scan
the incoming light from different directions [7–10]. When

Light excitation of the eyespot triggers photocurrents
causing an influx of Ca2+ ions to the flagella [11–15].
The response to the influx of Ca2+ ions is different
in the cis-flagellum (closest to the eyespot) and transflagellum (furthest from the eyespot). Kamiya and Witman studied axonemes in reactivated demembranated
models and observed that increasing the Ca2+ concentration decreases the beat amplitude of the cis-axoneme
and decreasing the Ca2+ concentration decreases the beat
amplitude of the trans-flagellum [16].

The eyespot is located about 45◦ ahead of the flagellar
beat plane, so at typical 2 Hz rotation the eyespot passes
some fixed point 60ms ahead of the beat plane. The lag
time between light stimuli and beat pattern changes are
30-40ms, suggesting that in free swimming cells, the beat
pattern changes when the light direction is nearly in the
beat plane [8, 17]. The sensitivity of the photoreceptor is

!

optimised for this frequency of rotation [22]. Schaller et
al suggested that the 45◦ offset of the eyespot is important for the cell keeping its correct orientation towards
or away from the light [10]. They showed that cells swim
with helical motion so the eyespot either tilts towards the
light or away from the light depending on whether the
cis or trans flagellum has the larger beat amplitude and
whether the cell is positively or negatively phototactic.
They showed that single photons can cause directional
changes and argued that in order to keep the correct orientation, the eyespot should be shaded by tilting away
from the light.
The direction of phototaxis is affected by preirradiation, concentration of cations, the intensity of the
directional light source and the wavelength of background
monitoring light [17, 23–25]. Ref. [25] reports evidence
that photosynthesis affects the sign of phototaxis. The
mechanism that controls the sign of phototaxis is still an
open question.
Drescher et al. developed a model to study phototaxis in Volvox carteri, a colonial alga with thousands
of cells like Chlamydomonas on the surface of a spherical extracellular matrix [26]. Each individual cell responds to a step up in light by decreasing its flagellar activity, then after some time adapting to its baseline. There is no central nervous system, but the coordinated response gives phototactic steering. Volvox rotates
about its swimming direction axis, and Drescher’s model
shows that this is essential for accurate phototaxis. Although Chlamydomonas and Volvox are closely related,
their steering mechanisms for phototaxis are different:
Chlamydomonas is a single cell that responds to a single
stimulus, but Volvox has many individual cells each responding to a different stimulus (some cells are shaded
and the intensity received by the illuminated cells depends on their angle to the light). The necessity of rotation is a common feature with our model, where the rotation of Chlamydomonas is necessary for its single eyespot
to scan the light in different directions.
Here, we use a simple mechanical model to demonstrate how opposite changes in beat pattern can give
phototactic steering. Previously we developed the model
to study synchronization and emergent run-and-tumble
behaviour [27]. Here we extend the model by coupling
the light intensity at the eyespot to a parameter that
describes the beat pattern.
The three-sphere model.— Simple actuated bead models have been used extensively to study swimming [28–
32] and synchronization [33–38] at low Reynolds number. Inspired by measurements of the flow field around
Chlamydomonas, found to be well represented by three
Stokeslets [39, 40], we represent the flagella as spheres
moving around circular trajectories in opposite directions. A third sphere represents the cell body; the model
is shown in figure 1. Each flagellar sphere is driven by
a tangential force that is phase dependent, representing

Each sphere is driven by a phase-dependent tangential force.

angle between the outward normal from the eyespot and the
direction towards light.

the beat pattern. We consider driving force profiles of
the form F (φi ) = F0 (1 + ai sin (nφi + ∆)), where φi is
the phase of flagellum i = c, t and ∆ is a constant phase.
Evidence for modelling the beat pattern using phase dependent forcing is shown by Geyer et al., who develop a
similar model and compare with detailed observations of
the flagellar beat pattern of Chlamydomonas [41]. The
beat pattern is an essential feature in this model for producing the behaviour observed in Chlamydomonas, for
example, synchronized beating [27].
Chlamydomonas has a diameter of ∼ 10µm and swims
in water with velocity ∼ 100µms−1 , so the Reynolds
number is ∼ 10−3 . The Reynolds number is small so velocities are linearly related to forces and Stokes friction
acts on each sphere. Hydrodynamic interactions between
the spheres break the time reversal symmetry, which is
a requirement for net propulsion at low Reynolds number. Further details of the model are presented in Ref.
[27], where we found emergent run-and-tumble behaviour
when we added noise to the parameter ai .

3
Here, we choose F (φi ) = F0 (1 + ai sin (φi + ∆)) and
couple the coefficient ai to the light intensity at the eyespot
ac = a0 + p log (1 + I(t)) + ζc (t),
at = a0 − p log (1 + I(t)) + ζt (t),

(1)

where p controls the strength of coupling and sign(p)
determines the direction of phototaxis, and I(t) is the
intensity of light at the eyespot which varies as the
cell rotates. The noise, ζi (t), has Gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and correlation function
hζi (t)ζj (t0 ) = σ 2 δij δ(t − t0 )i. The noise is not part of
the steering mechanism in the presence of light, but we
include it to show that steering is robust in the presence
of noise. In the dark, the noise allows the cell to show
run-and-tumble motion. We also include a phase shift
when there is no light: ∆ = 0 if I > 0 and ∆ = π/2 if
I = 0. We choose a0 = 0.6 so that we have stable synchronized beating in the absence of the coupling term.
The cis and trans coupling terms in equation (1) have
opposite signs, motivated by observations that the beat
amplitudes of the flagella respond in opposite ways to
light stimuli [17]. We couple the light logarithmically to
allow responses over a larger range of light intensity.
We denote the axes in the lab reference frame (X̂, Ŷ , Ẑ)
and choose the directional light to be in the −Ẑ-direction
with intensity I0 . We denote the axes in the rotating
cell frame (x̂, ŷ, ẑ) where ẑ points in the swimming direction and ŷ points towards the cis
√ flagellum. The eyespot
points in the direction (x̂ + ŷ)/ 2, so approximating the
cell body as opaque, the light intensity at√the eyespot is
I(t) = Ib + I0 Ẑ · (x̂ + ŷ)H Ẑ · (x̂ + ŷ) / 2, where Ib is
isotropic background light and H is the Heaviside step
function. The intensities of the background light Ib and
the directional light I0 are chosen such that |ac,t | < 1.
The angular velocity about the x-axis that this model
produces can be approximated as
ωx = ω0 (at − ac ) + ω1 tanh (K(at − ac )) cos (Ωb t) (2)
where K ≈ 100 and Ωb is the flagellar beat frequency.
We use the full model and not approximation (2) in the
results presented here. The observed rotation about the
ẑ-axis, Ωz ≈ Ωb /20, can be produced by the model when
we tilt the circular trajectories of the flagellar spheres
out of the y-z plane in opposite directions. The forward
motion produced by the model is oscillatory and can be
approximated by, u = u0 +u1 cos(Ωb t), in agreement with
experiments [42]. The initial orientation angle θ0 is the
angle between the cell’s orientation ẑ and the direction
towards the light Ẑ. We choose an initial condition such
that the y-z plane lies in the Y -Z plane.
Results.— The three-sphere model shows positive phototaxis when p > 0 and negative phototaxis when p < 0
for all initial orientations, θ0 , and choices of Ib , I0 that
satisfy |ac,t | < 1. Even if we start the cell on a trajectory

directly away from the light, if p = 1 then the negative
phototaxis direction is unstable and the steering mechanism turns the cell towards the light. Similarly, when
p = −1, if we start the cell on a trajectory towards the
light then the steering mechanism turns the cell away
from the light. On average the cell travels on a helical
path as shown in the inset of figure 2(a).
The steering mechanism is robust to noise; when the
light is on the cell moves towards or away from the light,
and if a tumble occurs then the cell quickly reorients itself
towards or away from the light again. We have tested
noise strengths σ ∈ [10−4 , 5x10−3 ] and we find that the
cell steers directly towards or away from the light with
only an occasional tumble that is quickly corrected for
the larger noise strengths. Figure 2 shows trajectories
with p = −1 where the cell alternates between light and
dark phases. The cell steers away from the light, then
when the light is switched off the cell shows run-andtumble behaviour. When the light is turned on again
the cell immediately steers away from the light again. If
σ < 10−4 then we see the same dynamics in the light,
but in the dark the run duration becomes longer and we
would need longer simulation times to see tumble events.
In Ref. [27] we show that the characteristic run duration
varies as 1/σ.
If the cell swims in periodic light with a period that is
shorter than the characteristic run duration and longer
than rotation period, then the probability of a tumble
event occurring during the dark phase is small and the
cell can follow its path towards the light without interruption. The initial orienting of the cell towards or away
from the light can be slowed by dark phases, but once
the cell has reached the correct orientation, short periodic dark phases do not disturb the motion towards or
away from the light.
Figures 2(c,d) show the curvature of the trajectories
in figures 2(a,b) when we average over the helical motion
and small fluctuations. We see that in the red sections
when the light is on the curvature is small. During darkness we see peaks in the curvature that correspond to the
tumbles and sections of very small curvature that correspond to straight runs. In Ref. [27] we found that when
tumbles occur we also see jumps in the phase difference
between the two flagella. The green line in figures 2(c,d)
shows the phase difference and we see that the peaks in
curvature correspond to jumps in phase difference, confirming that the peaks in curvature are tumbles and that
we have run-and-tumble motion in the dark.
Stronger coupling gives faster steering. This is shown
in figure 3, where the initial curvature towards the light is
greater for greater values of p. Larger values of p increase
the mismatch between the cis and trans beat amplitudes
which allows faster rotations in the beat plane.
Understanding the steering mechanism.— When we
average over the fast oscillations within a flagellar beat
cycle, the cell swims along a helical path and we consider

how the helix bends towards or away from the light. The
cell swims with linear velocity u in the ẑ-direction and
angular velocities −Ωz about the ẑ-axis, Ωz > 0, and ωx
about the x̂-axis. This combination causes the cell to
swim along a left-handed helix with radius r = u|ωx |/Ω2z
and pitch length λ = 2πu/Ωz . The angle between the
cell trajectory and the helix axis is

plane, the cell does not generate the required rotation
about the ŷ-axis. Therefore, the change in γ is produced
by a change in direction of the helix axis, as shown in
figure 4(a). This change in direction changes the angle χ
between the light direction and the helix axis.

(4)

Increasing and decreasing light produce opposite
changes in γ, but since these changes happen when the
cell is at different positions along the helix, the opposite changes in γ can work together to produce the same
change in χ. Let ϕ ∈ [0, 2π) be the phase of the cell on
the helix where ϕ = 0 is the position furthest from the
incoming light, marked with a red triangle in figure 4(c).
When ϕ ∈ (0, π), an increase (decrease) in γ causes the
helix axis to bend away from (towards) the light and a
decrease (increase) in γ when ϕ ∈ (π, 2π) also causes the
helix axis to bend away from (towards) the light.

For either choice of p, from equations (3) and (4) we see
that when I(t) decreases (increases), then |ωx |, and hence
γ, decreases (increases). To see how changes in the pitch
angle γ affects steering, we consider the angle between
the helix axis and the Ẑ-axis (light direction) which we
denote χ. If the helix angle γ changes as a result of the
changing light intensity, there are two possible ways that
the correct angle can be made: either the cell changes its
trajectory by rotating about its ŷ-axis or the helix axis
changes direction. But since the flagella beat in the y − z

We consider what happens for each choice of sign(p).
First we consider p > 0. In this case, ωx < 0 so the
eyespot moves around the inside of the helix. As the cell
moves from ϕ = 0 to ϕ = π, on average the cell sees
a decrease in the light intensity as the cell body moves
around to shield the eyespot, so γ decreases, causing the
helix axis to bend towards the light. Similarly, as the cell
moves from ϕ = π to ϕ = 2π, on average the cell sees an
increase in the light intensity so γ increases, also resulting
in the helix axis bending towards the light. Therefore we

γ = tan−1 (2πr/λ) = tan−1 (|ωx |/Ωz ).

(3)

The ŷ-axis points outwards in the radial direction when
ωx > 0 and points inwards in the radial direction when
ωx < 0. We can approximate the x-component of angular velocity using equation (2) and average over the fast
oscillations:
ωx ≈ −2pω0 log (1 + I(t)).

FIG. 3. Trajectories of the cell with different values of
coupling strength p projected into the Y -Z plane, where
t/tc ∈ [0, 180]. Blue circles: p = 0.5; purple squares: p = 0.8;
green diamonds: p = 1.2; red triangle: p = 1.8. The cell is
initially oriented in the −ŷ direction and steers towards the
light coming in from the Ẑ direction. At t/tc = 180, the cells
with p = 1.2 and p = 1.8 have oriented towards the light, but
the cells with p = 0.5 and p = 0.8 are still slowly bending
towards the light.

have positive phototaxis for p > 0.
If p < 0, then ωx > 0 and the eyespot moves around
the outside of the helix. When the cell moves from ϕ = 0
to ϕ = π the light intensity at the eyespot increases, γ
increases, and the helix axis bends away from the light.
When the cells moves from ϕ = π to ϕ = 2π, the light
intensity decreases, γ decreases, and the helix axis bends
away from the light. Therefore we have negative phototaxis for p < 0.
The direction of phototaxis is controlled by sign(p). If
we use linear coupling instead of the logarithmic coupling
used in equation (1)—or indeed any other monotonically
increasing functional form—then we find the same phototaxis directions for each choice of sign(p) and the mechanism is the same as that described above, provided the
coupling strength does not exceed the permissible range
for the ai coefficients.
The rate that the cell turns towards or away from the
light depends on |p|. The rate of bending towards or
away from the light is χ̇ = γ̇ sin ϕ, where
γ̇ ≈

(5)

I˙ changes sign at approximately the same time as sin ϕ,
so increasing |p| increases the rate at which χ decreases
or increases towards 0 or π, respectively.
Discussion.— We have shown that in the three-sphere
model of Chlamydomonas our simple coupling of the amplitude in the flagellar driving force to the intensity at
the eyespot leads to phototactic steering. The direction

change in γ is facilitated by the helix axis changing direction
by δγ. The purple dashed line shows the new cell axis after
γ → γ + δγ. (c) The effect of changes in γ on the angle χ depend on the phase of the cell: δχ = δγ sin ϕ. The red triangle
and purple square mark the positions ϕ = 0 and ϕ = π, respectively. When the cell has position ϕ ∈ (0, π), an increase
(decrease) in γ causes the helix axis to bend away from (towards) the light and a corresponding decrease (increase) in
γ when ϕ ∈ (π, 2π) also causes the helix axis to bend away
from (towards) the light. The incoming light is marked by
the pink arrow and the blue arrows show the direction that
the cell travels along the helix. The dashed lines at ϕ = π/2
and ϕ = 3π/2 show the new direction of the helix axis if γ
increases and decreases, respectively, by δγ at these positions.

of phototaxis and steering rate is controlled by the parameter p. As the cell rotates about its body axis, the
light intensity viewed by the eyespot varies and this produces variation in the angular velocity. The cell swims
along a helical path and variation in the angular velocity
causes the helix axis to bend. The position of the cell
along the helix affects whether the helix axis bends towards or away from the light so opposite changes in light
intensity that occur on opposite sides of the helix can
work together to bend the cell towards or away from the
light.
We have included noise in our model and shown that
the steering mechanism is robust with respect to the
noise. When the light is on, the cell steers towards or

6
away from the light and travels along a helical path. In
darkness, the cell shows run-and-tumble behaviour and
the phase dependence in our model allows us to control the synchronization properties of the flagella, as described in Ref. [27]. The model includes a phase shift in
the beat pattern between light and darkness and this
gear change enables the cell to run-and-tumble effectively. Hydrodynamic interactions allow the model to
break time reversal symmetry; a requirement for swimming at low Reynolds number. Therefore, the simple
model successfully meets our complex engineering needs
of low Reynolds swimming, synchronized beating, runand-tumble in darkness and phototaxis.
In periodic light with a period that is shorter than the
characteristic run duration, there are very few tumbles
and our model maintains its path towards or away from
the light in the same way as it does with a constant light
source, although the initial orienting time can be longer.
It would be interesting to see if real Chlamydomonas cells
phototax as effectively in periodic light as they do in
constant light when the period is shorter than the typical
run duration and longer than the rotation period about
the body axis.
We do not vary the parameter a0 because the stability
of the synchronized state is sensitive to this parameter as
discussed in Ref. [27]. We only get the desired behaviour
of phototactic steering in the light and run-and-tumble in
the dark for a narrow range of a0 . The phase dependence
of the driving force is essential for the model to produce
the different types of observed behaviour.
The direction of phototaxis is controlled by p in our
model. Chlamydomonas usually shows positive phototaxis in low to moderate light intensities and negative
phototaxis in high light intensity, so p = 2H(Ib + I0 −
Ic (λ)) − 1 is a reasonable choice for a basic model, where
the critical light intensity Ic (λ) depends on the wavelength of both background and directional light.
The magnitude of the coupling parameter |p| increases
the rate of steering towards or away from the light. A
quick glance at equation (5) suggests that increasing
(decreasing) the spinning frequency, Ωz , decreases (increases) the rate of steering, χ̇. However, increasing (decreasing) Ωz also increases (decreases) the rate of change
˙ which increases (decreases)
of viewed light intensity, I,
the steering rate. Our numerical results do not show
significant variation of the steering rate with Ωz , when
the spinning frequency is at least an order of magnitude
slower than the beat frequency. If the spinning and beat
frequencies become comparable then we get nonlinear
terms in equation (5).
