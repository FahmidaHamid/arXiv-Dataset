Abstract
Oscillatory chemical reactions often serve as a timing clock of cellular processes in
living cells. The temporal dynamics of protein concentration levels is thus of great
interest in biology. Here we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the frequency,
phase and amplitude of oscillatory protein concentrations in gene regulatory networks
with negative cyclic feedback. We first formulate the analysis framework of oscillation
profiles based on multivariable harmonic balance. With this framework, the frequency,
phase and amplitude are obtained analytically in terms of kinetic constants of the reactions despite the nonlinearity of the dynamics. These results are demonstrated with the
Pentilator and Hes7 self-repression network, and it is shown that the developed analysis method indeed predicts the profiles of the oscillations. A distinctive feature of the
presented result is that the waveform of oscillations is analytically obtained for a broad
class of biochemical systems. Thus, it is easy to see how the waveform is determined
from the system’s parameters and structures. We present general biological insights
that are applicable for any gene regulatory networks with negative cyclic feedback.

Introduction

In living cells, oscillatory chemical reactions serve as a timing clock of important cellular
processes. The temporal dynamics of oscillatory gene expression has thus been actively
studied in recent years (Goldbeter and Berridge, 1997; Winfree, 2001). It is known that
the frequency, phase and amplitude of the oscillations are diverse, ranging from minutes to
hours and from phase synchronization to asynchronous oscillations. However, the relation
between the dynamical properties of biochemical system and the resulting temporal pattern
is not thoroughly understood. Here we propose a theoretical framework for quantitatively
studying the frequency, phase and amplitude of oscillatory chemical concentrations that
arise from biochemical networks with negative cyclic feedback.
The negative cyclic feedback motif shown in Fig. 1, where each gene activates or represses
another gene expression in a cyclic way, has been considered as a core circuit module to
produce periodic oscillations for a long time (Goodwin (1965); Tyson (1975); Thron (1991);
Tiana et al. (2007); Hori et al. (2011) for example). This conjecture was recently corroborated with a synthetic biological circuit reported in Elowitz and Leibler (2000), in which
oscillatory gene expression was indeed observed in a gene regulatory network consisting of
three repressors. Moreover, the negative cyclic feedback was also found in many existing
biochemical networks that exhibit periodic oscillations such as the somitogenesis oscillator

(Hirata et al., 2004) and p53 networks (Lahav et al., 2004). Thus, the study of negative
cyclic feedback circuits can potentially unravel the essential dynamical properties of oscillatory biochemical reactions.
The frequency profile of oscillatory gene expression in cyclic biochemical networks was
studied by means of numerical simulations for the Repressilator motif (El-Samad et al.,
2005) and for the self-negative feedback motif (Jensen et al., 2003; Monk, 2003; Wang et al.,
2004). A more theoretical approach was taken by Rapp (1976) to investigate the frequency
of Goodwin type oscillators (Goodwin, 1965) based on harmonic balance analysis (Khalil,
2001). This approach is, however, not directly applicable to the biochemical oscillators of our
interest due to the multiple nonlinearities, and the phase profile of oscillations is still open
to be analyzed. Hence, a more general theoretical framework is desirable to systematically
explore the profiles of oscillations in biochemical networks.
The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) to develop a systematic method to study the profiles
of oscillations in gene regulatory networks with negative cyclic feedback, and (ii) to gain
novel biological insight on the relation between the oscillation profiles and the reaction
kinetics. In particular, we here pursue universal insights that are applicable to a broad class
of biochemical networks rather than the numerical study of particular biological examples.
To this end, we adopt a simplified model that is suitable for capturing the essence, and we
analytically obtain the oscillation profiles. Specifically, we use describing function approach
to approximating nonlinearities of the system (Khalil, 2001; Iwasaki, 2008), and formulate
multivariable harmonic balance equations for the analysis of biochemical oscillators. Using
distinctive features of the dynamics of biochemical networks, we derive analytic estimates
of frequency, phase and amplitude in terms of kinetic constants of the reactions despite the
nonlinearity of the dynamical model.
A distinctive feature of our result is that the approximate waveform of oscillations is analytically obtained for a broad class of cyclic biochemical systems. Thus, it is easy to see
how the waveform is determined from the system’s parameters and structures. This feature
is demonstrated through the analysis of two biological examples, the Pentilator (Tsai et al.,
2008) and the somitogenesis clock (Hirata et al., 2004). The Pentilator is a conceptual
biochemical oscillator with five repressors connected in a cyclic way. We here analyze the
Pentilator to show that the developed result is useful even for large-scale gene regulatory
networks. In the somitogenesis example, we investigate the Hes7 self-repression network
(Hirata et al., 2004). It was experimentally observed that Hes7 gene exhibits oscillatory
expression with almost two-hour cycle (Hirata et al., 2004). We demonstrate that the developed analysis method indeed predicts the two-hour period, and show that transcription
and translation time delays play an important role in maintaining the oscillation period.
Finally, general biological insights that are applicable to any biochemical networks with
negative cyclic feedback are presented.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the dynamical model of the gene regulatory
network is introduced. Then, we formulate multivariable harmonic balance for biochemical
oscillators in Section 3. Based on this formulation, the frequency, phase and amplitude of
oscillations are analytically obtained in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to illustrate these
results with the biological examples. In Section 6, we provide general biological insights.
Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 7.
The basic idea of the analysis was previously demonstrated in the authors’ conference
paper (Hori and Hara, 2011) with the omission of rigorous proofs. In this paper, we include
complete proofs of the theorems. Moreover, the analysis of oscillation amplitude (Section
4.3) and the illustrative examples of the two biochemical oscillators (Section 5) are presented
as original work. The biological insights in Section 6 are also greatly extended.

Model Description and Existence of Oscillations
Dynamical Model of gene regulatory networks with negative
cyclic feedback

In cells, the production of proteins consists of two processes, transcription and translation.
In transcription, information on a gene is decoded, and turns into the copies of messenger
RNA (mRNA). The mRNA molecules are then translated to corresponding protein molecules
(see Fig. 1). These proteins then activate or repress the transcription of other genes, and
form gene regulatory network.
In this paper, we consider the gene regulatory network illustrated in Fig. 1. Here each
protein activates or represses another transcription in a cyclic way. The dynamics of mRNA
and protein concentrations in such networks can be modeled as follows (Chen and Aihara,
2002; Elowitz and Leibler, 2000).
ṙi (t) = −ai ri (t) + βi fi (pi−1 (t − τpi−1 )),
ṗi (t) = ci ri (t − τri ) − bi pi (t),

(1)

for i = 1, 2, · · · , N , where ri ∈ R+ (:= {x ∈ R | x ≥ 0}) and pi ∈ R+ denote the concentrations of the i-th mRNA and its corresponding protein synthesized by the i-th gene,
respectively. For the sake of notational simplicity, we regard the subscript 0 as N throughout this paper. The positive constants τri and τpi describe transcription and translation
time delays resulting from unmodeled intermediate process, respectively. The kinetic constants ai , bi , ci and βi represent the followings: ai and bi denote the degradation rates of
the i-th mRNA and protein, respectively; ci and βi denote the translation and transcription
rates, respectively. The nonlinear function fi (·) : R+ → R+ stands for the effect of either
activation or repression of the transcription, and it is defined by

with a Hill coefficient ν.
We see from (1) that the transfer function from ui := fi (pi−1 ) to pi , which describes
the dynamics of protein production in each gene, becomes a second order system with time
delay. Defining these second order systems as hi (s) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ), the overall system
(1) can be described by Fig. 2 (Left), where a transfer matrix H(s) and a static vector

Specifically, the protein concentrations asymptotically converge to one of equilibria when
δ > 0, while they exhibit oscillatory solutions as well as convergence when δ < 0 (Enciso,
2007; Smith, 1987). Therefore, the gene regulatory networks with δ < 0 are of interest in
this paper.
Assumption 1. For given fi (·) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ), δ < 0.

This assumption implies that a given gene regulatory network has an odd number of repressive interactions (dfi /dp < 0) between genes. Thus, the loop gain of the overall system is
negative.
In order to capture the essential dynamical properties in an analytic way, we hereafter
consider a simplified model of (1). It is assumed that the kinetic parameters ai , bi , ci and βi
in (1) are homogeneous between genes throughout this paper.
Assumption 2. a1 = a2 = · · · = aN (=: a), b1 = b2 = · · · = bN (=: b), c1 = c2 = · · · =
cN (=: c) and β1 = β2 = · · · = βN (:= β) in (1).

Remark 1. In Appendix A, we also discuss the case where the parameters are heterogeneous. In particular, we show that the analysis based on Assumption 2 provides important
insights for the case of heterogeneous parameters as well, though the primary aim of Assumption 2 is to simplify the model and explore the essence of the dynamics in an analytic
way.

Existence of oscillations

In Takada et al. (2010), the authors presented existence conditions of oscillations for the
gene regulatory system (1). The analysis then revealed that five dimensionless quantities
essentially determine the existence of oscillations, namely (N, Q, R, τ̃ , ν), where

Physical meanings of these constants are summarized in Table 1.
Remark 2. Since Q is the ratio of geometric and arithmetic means, 0 < Q ≤ 1 holds. In
particular, Q → 1 implies that the degradation time constants of mRNA and proteins, Ta
and Tb , tend to be a same value. The parameter τ̃ describes the ratio of mean transcription
and translation delay to the mean degradation rate.
In what follows, we analyze the frequency, phase and amplitude of oscillatory protein
concentrations, and reveal how these parameters in Table 1 affect the oscillation profiles.
Throughout this paper, it is assumed that the system (1) satisfies the existence conditions
of oscillations in Takada et al. (2010), and exhibits oscillatory protein concentrations.

Multivariable Harmonic Balance Analysis for Biochemical Oscillators

In this section, we provide a theoretic framework of oscillation profile analysis for the gene
regulatory network (1). Using the harmonic balance analysis (Khalil, 2001; Iwasaki, 2008),
we first derive a quasi-linear system associated with (1). Then, it is shown that the frequency,
phase and amplitude profiles are obtained from the equations that the closed loop quasilinear system should satisfy.

3.1

Multivariable harmonic balance analysis

The oscillatory waveform of pi (t)
(i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) can be written with the infinite sum
P∞
of sinusoidal waves as pi (t) =
k=0 αik sin(k̟t + ϕik ) with some constants ̟, ϕik and
αik (k = 0, 1, · · · ). Here, we can expect that pi (t) is approximately written as
pi (t) ≃ xi + yi sin(̟t + ϕi ) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ),
5

(10)

since the higher order harmonic components are attenuated by the second order low-pass
filters hi (s) in the cyclic network. It should be noted that xi and yi denote the bias and the
amplitude of the first order harmonic components of the i-th protein pi (t), respectively. We
assume xi ≥ 0 and yi ≥ 0 without loss of generality.
Let the describing functions of R2 fi (·) be defined by
Z π
Ri2
fi (xi−1 +yi−1 sin(t)) dt,
2πxi−1 −π
Z

Ri2
ξi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) :=
fi (xi−1 +yi−1 sin(t)) sin(t)dt.
πyi−1 −π
ηi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) :=

(11)
(12)

The describing functions ηi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) and ξi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) represent the bias and harmonic
gains of Ri2 fi (·) for the sinusoidal input xi−1 +yi−1 sin(̟t), respectively (Khalil, 2001).
Approximating the nonlinearity f (·) with the describing functions, we see that the input
to hi (s) is ui = ηi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) and ui = ξi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) instead of ui = fi (·). Thus, the system
depicted in Fig. 2 (Left) can be redrawn as shown in Fig. 2 (Right), where
K0 (x, |y|) := cyc(η1 , η2 , · · · , ηN ),
K1 (x, |y|) := cyc(ξ1 , ξ2 , · · · , ξN ),

and |y| stands for elementwise absolute values, i.e., |y| = [y1 , y2 , · · · , yN ]T ∈ RN

We can see that the system in Fig. 2 (Right) would satisfy the following closed-loop
equations, if the waveform of pi (t) was strictly the sinusoidal wave xi + yi sin(̟t + ϕi ).
(I − H(0)K0 (x, |y|))x = 0

(I − H(j̟)K1 (x, |y|))y = 0.

(15a)
(15b)

Thus, the solution (̟, x, y) of the equations (15) is expected to capture an approximate
profile of the oscillations when pi (t) is sufficiently close to the sinusoidal of the form (10).
Consequently, the oscillation profile analysis reduces to the problem of finding 3N variables
(̟, x1 , x2 , · · · , xN , y1 , y2 , · · · , yN , ϕ2 , ϕ3 , · · · , ϕN ) satisfying (15). Note that ϕ1 is defined

H0 (s) and H1 (s) as
H• (s) := (I − H(s)K• )−1 (• = 0, 1),

6

(16)

where K• is the constant matrices defined by K• := K• (x∗ , |y ∗ |) (• = 0, 1). Although
there may exist multiple solutions for the equations (15), orbitally unstable solutions can be
empirically ruled out by checking the stability of H• (s) (see Khalil (2001); Iwasaki (2008) and
references therein). Specifically, a pair of poles of H• (s) is expected to lie on the imaginary
axis, and the rest in the open left half complex plane, if a solution (̟, x∗ , y ∗ ) is orbitally
stable. Thus, the profiles of stable oscillations can be specified from the solutions of (15)
and the marginal stability condition.

3.2

Oscillation profile analysis for biochemical oscillators

Using the harmonic balance approach, the oscillation profile analysis of biochemical oscillators can be summarized as follows.
Oscillation profile analysis: Consider the gene regulatory network modeled by (1).
Suppose pi (t) is approximately written as pi (t) ≃ xi +yi sin(̟t+ϕi ) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ).
Then, we find (̟, ϕi , xi , yi ) such that the following two conditions hold.
(C1) The equations (15a) and (15b) hold.
(C2) The system H0 (s)(H1 (s)) has a pole at s = 0(s = ±j̟), and the rest in
the open left half complex plane.

In what follows, we explore the solutions of (15) in an analytic way. We show that the
equations (15) can be rewritten in the form of eigen-equations, and the profiles of oscillations
can be determined from the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of matrices with a certain structure.
Let a N × N diagonal transfer matrix U (s) and a scalar transfer function h(s) be defined
by
U (s) := diag(es(τ −τ1 ) , es(τ −τ2 ) , · · · , es(τ −τN ) ),

h(s) :=

(19)

(18)

where

It follows that H(s) = h(s)e
U (s) with τ defined in (9). Note that H(s) is decomposed
into the common dynamics h(s)e−sτ and the deviation U (s). Dividing (15) by h(0) and
h(j̟)e−j̟ and substituting the solution (̟, x∗ , y ∗ ), we have
(φ(0)I − K0 )x∗ = 0,

where
φ(s) := 1/h(s) and U := U (j̟).

(21)

We see that x∗ and y ∗ can be seen as the eigenvectors of K0 and U K1 associated with
the eigenvalues φ(0) and φ(j̟)ej̟τ , respectively. However, the solution is not obtained by
simply analyzing the eigenvalue and the associated eigenvector. This is because the matrices
K0 , K1 and U depend on x, |y| and ̟ as shown in (13) and (21), thus we need to determine
both the matrices K• (x, |y|) and the corresponding eigenvalues/eigenvectors simultaneously.
Nevertheless, this observation provides us with important intuitions for our subsequent
analysis. In the following sections, we show that (20) can be analytically solved by using
the structure of the matrices K• (x, |y|).

Profiles of Oscillations

In this section, we analytically derive the profiles of the oscillatory protein concentrations
in terms of the biological parameters in Table 1.

4.1

The frequency of oscillations

We first obtain the frequency ̟ in terms of the parameters shown in Table 1. The following
lemma describes the eigenvalue distribution of U (j̟)K1 (x, |y|).
Lemma 1. For any given (̟, x, y), the eigenvalues λi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) of the matrix
U (j̟)K1 (x, |y|) are given by

QN
Note that the time delays are cancelled out. It follows that i=1 ξ(xi−1 , yi−1 ) < 0, because
ξi (xi−1 , yi−1 ) is negative/positive when δi is negative/positive, and Assumption 1 holds.
Thus, (22) is derived by solving (23).

We see that the eigenvalues are equiangularly located on a circle with center at the origin.
Moreover, ̟ does not affect the eigenvalue, and x and y affect only the radial position, but
not the the angular position of the eigenvalues. Since the oscillation frequency ̟ should
satisfy (20), possible candidates of ̟ can be characterized as

̟ ∈ ω  arg(φ(jω)e ) =

where arg(·) stands for the argument of a complex number. Note that (24) does not depend
on x and y. The possible solutions of ̟ are illustrated in Fig. 3. We see from Fig. 3 that
there are countably infinite solutions.
Despite the infinite candidates of ̟, we can show that an orbitally stable solution is unique
by considering the condition (C2). The following lemma gives a necessary and sufficient
condition for marginal stability of H1 (s).

Lemma 2. The system H1 (s) defined by (16) has a pair of poles at s = ±jω0 and the rest
in the open left half complex plane, if and only if a pair of the eigenvalues of U K1 , which
we denote by λℓ and λ′ℓ (= λ¯ℓ ), satisfies φ(jω0 ) = λℓ and φ(−jω0 ) = λ′ℓ , and the others lie
in the domain Ωc+ := {γ ∈ C | φ(s)esτ 6= γ for ∀s ∈ C+ }.

The proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix B. The domain Ωc+ is the hatched region
partitioned by φ(jω)ejωτ in Fig. 3. Lemma 2 implies that the marginal stability of H1 (s) is
examined from the domain Ωc+ and the eigenvalue distribution of U K1 . In particular, the
gain and phase monotonicity of φ(s)esτ allows us to show the uniqueness of the frequency
̟ that satisfies both (C1) and (C2).
Proposition 1. Suppose there exist (̟, x, y) satisfying (C1) and (C2). Then, the frequency
̟ is uniquely given by the minimum positive solution of arg(φ(j̟)ej̟τ ) = π/N .

Proof. The distance of the boundary of Ωc+ from the origin, i.e.,

|φ(jω)ejωτ | = (1 + Ta ω 2 )(1 + Tb ω 2 )

monotonically increases for ω ≥ 0. On the other hand, the eigenvalues of U K1 are equally
distant from the origin as seen in Lemma 1. Thus, the marginal stability condition in Lemma
2 implies that λ1 in (22) must lie on the boundary of Ωc+ , when H1 (s) is marginally stable
(see Fig. 3). Consequently, ̟ satisfies φ(j̟)ej̟τ = λ1 .

From this proposition, we can analytically derive the frequency profile in terms of the
biological parameters.

Note that φ(jω) (ω ∈ R) draws a parabolic curve on the complex plane. Proposition
1 implies that ̟ is the minimum positive solution of arg(φ(j̟)) = π/N − ̟τ . Thus,
Re[φ(j̟)] = A cos(π/N ) and Im[φ(j̟)] = A sin(π/N ) for some A > 0. Substituting these
into (26) and (27), and eliminating A, we have the following equation.

The oscillation frequency is analytically predicted in this theorem. Thus, it is possible to
interpret the relation between the parameters and the frequency. Note that (25) is written
only in terms of the essential parameters shown in Table 1. We will demonstrate biological
insights obtained from Theorem 1 in Section 6.
Remark 3. The minimum positive solution of (25) can be efficiently obtained by bisection
search for ̟ ∈ [0, π/N τ ], because the right-hand side of (25) monotonically decreases for
̟ ∈ [0, π/N τ], and the minimum positive solution of (25) exists in this region. It should be

The phase profile is determined from the eigenvector y ∗ of U K1 in (20b). In what follows,
the phase profile is explored in an analytic approach.
We first show that U K1 can always be transformed into a circulant matrix (Davis, 1979)
by similarity transformation.
Lemma 3. Let D := diag(d1 , d2 , · · · , dN ) ∈ CN ×N be defined by

with ξi∗ := ξi (x∗i−1 , yi−1

Since circulant matrices are known to be diagonalized by the discrete Fourier transform
matrix (Davis, 1979), the eigenvector q := [q1 , q2 , · · · , qN ]T of V associated with the eigenvalue φ(j̟)ej̟τ is easily obtained as
(

Therefore, the phasor y = [y1 ej ϕ˜1 , y2 ej ϕ˜2 , · · · , yN ej ϕ˜N ]T is calculated from y = Dq. Finally,
computing ϕi = ϕ̃i + ̟τpi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) yields the following analytic estimate of the
phase.
Theorem 2. Consider the gene regulatory networks modeled by (1). The phase shift (ϕi+1 −
ϕi ) between the (i + 1)-th and the i-th protein is expected as

(33)
(34)

and ̟ is given by Theorem 1.
This theorem analytically predicts the phase difference between protein species. The
constants ∆τi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) are the discrepancy of the time delay of the i-th gene from
the average delay τ . The interpretation of Theorem 2 is given in Section 6.
Remark 4. When the delays are homogeneous between genes, i.e., τr1 = τr2 = · · · = τrN
and τp1 = τp2 = · · · = τpN , (32) is independent of ̟, and it depends only on the activationrepression pattern of the regulatory network.

4.3

The bias and amplitude of oscillations

The bias and amplitude profiles can be predicted from x and |y| in (15).
We first show that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of K0 (x, |y|) are obtained in a similar
fashion to Lemma 1.
Lemma 4 .For any given (x, y), the eigenvalues µi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) of the matrix K0 (x, |y|)
are given by

and the eigenvector associated with µ1 is [η1 , η1 η2 , · · · ,

QN

i=1

ηi ]T .

This lemma shows that the eigenvalues of K0 are located on a circle with center at the
origin, but the angular position is different from that of U K1 (see Lemma 1). Following the
similar argument as Lemma 1 and Proposition 1, we can show that µ1 should become the
eigenvalue that corresponds to φ(0)(= 1) in (20a). Therefore, the bias x∗ is obtained from
the eigenvector of K0 associated with µ1 , and we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3. Consider the gene regulatory networks modeled by (1). The bias x and
amplitude |y| of oscillatory protein concentrations pi (t) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) are expected to
satisfy both (36a) and (36b) simultaneously.

This theorem provides the equations that the bias and amplitude of oscillations should
satisfy. Note that xi and yi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) are determined from the recursive equations
(36) once (x1 , y1 ) is determined. It also follows that

(x1 , y1 ) so that (37) is satisfied under the constraint (36). However, the construction of a
fast and reliable algorithm to compute x and |y| remains a future challenge.

Applications to Biochemical Oscillators

In this section, we demonstrate the proposed analysis method with two biochemical networks. We first consider the Pentilator (Tsai et al., 2008), a conceptual biochemical network consisting of N = 5 genes, to illustrate that the developed result is useful even for the
large network. Then, we investigate the oscillations of an existing oscillatory reactions, the
somitogenesis clock (Hirata et al., 2004).

5.1

Pentilator with time delay

Pentilator (Tsai et al., 2008) is a model of the gene regulatory network that is composed of
N = 5 genes interacting in a cyclic way. Although the original model assumed that all the
interactions are repressive, we here replace two of the repressors with activators in order to
describe the effect of activators on the oscillation profiles.
We consider the gene regulatory network depicted in Fig. 4 (Top). The dynamical model
of the Pentilator in Fig. 4 (Top) is then written for i = 1, 2, · · · , 5 as
ṙi (t) = −ari (t) + βfi (pi−1 (t − τpi−1 )),
ṗi (t) = cri (t − τri ) − bpi (t),

(38)

where f1 (·) = f2 (·) = f4 (·) = FR (·) and f3 (·) = f5 (·) = FA (·). Note that time delays of
transcription and translation are explicitly modeled in (38), though they were not introduced
in Tsai et al. (2008).
The parameters are set as follows: the degradation rates are a = 2.0[min−1 ] and b =
0.2[min−1 ], and the synthesis rates are c = 0.3[min−1 ] and β = 10[min−1 ]. The Hill coefficient is ν = 2.0, and the time delays are τr := [1.8, 1.4, 1.1, 0.7, 1.0]T [min] and τp :=
[1.0, 0.8, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4]T [min], where the i-th entry of τr and τp is defined as τri and τpi ,
respectively.
From the above parameters, we have
Q = 0.575, τ = 1.8, TA = 1.1,

(39)

T

∆τ = [1.0, 0.4, −0.3, −0.7, −0.4] ,
where ∆τ is the vector whose i-th entry is ∆τi defined in (33). Then, φ(s)esτ in (20) becomes
φ(s)esτ = (5s + 1)(0.5s + 1)e1.8s , and the problem reduces to finding (̟, x, y) satisfying the
conditions (C1) and (C2).
The existence of oscillations for this system can be confirmed from the conditions presented
in Takada et al. (2010), thus we hereafter analyze the waveform of the oscillations. Using
Theorem 1, we first obtain the oscillation frequency as ̟ = 8.98 × 10−2 [rad/min]. The
phase profiles can be computed from Theorem 2, where Z1 = −1, Z2 = −1, Z3 = +1, Z4 =
−1, Z5 = +1. The results are summarized in Table 2. Note that we define ϕ1 = 0 without
loss of generality.
To confirm these results, we conducted a numerical simulation of (38). The time course
of protein concentrations is presented in Fig. 4 (Bottom). The frequency and phase of
the simulated oscillations are shown in Table 2. We see that the proposed analytic results
provide approximate oscillation profiles with high accuracy.

Somitogenesis clock

Somitogenesis is the process by which the somites of living organisms are produced. Recent
biological studies revealed that somite segmentation of mouse embryos occurs every two
hours, and the segmentation clock is primarily controlled by oscillatory gene expression of
Hes7 gene (see Hirata et al. (2004) and references therein).
The Hes7 transcription is controlled by the self-negative feedback of Hes7 protein. Thus,
the dynamics of Hes7 protein concentration can be described as

β
ṙ (t) = −ar (t) +
,
1
1
1 + p21 (t − τp1 )
(40)

ṗ1 (t) = −bp1 (t) + cr1 (t − τr1 ).

Note that this model is a special case of (1) with N = 1.
Theoretical studies of the self-negative feedback system (40) predicted that short halflife of Hes7 is a key to generate the oscillations of two-hour period (Monk, 2003) . Later,
Hirata et al. (2004) conducted an experiment using Hes7 mutants with long half-lives and
normal repressor activity, and confirmed that the mutants with long half-lives do not exhibit
oscillations. Although the oscillations’ existence was focused in many existing studies including the authors’ work (Takada et al., 2010), the underlying mechanism that determines
the profiles of oscillations are still unclear.
In what follows, we demonstrate that the frequency profile can be analyzed with Theorem
1, then provide insights on the relation between the parameters and the frequency of the oscillations. Following Hirata et al. (2004), we here define the mRNA and protein degradation
rates a and b as
a=

ln 2

,b =

(41)

where tr and tp denote mRNA and protein half-life time. The parameter values of wild-type
Hes7 is also taken from Hirata et al. (2004): tp = 20 [min], tr = 3 [min], a = 0.231 [min−1 ], b =

0.0347 [min−1 ], c = 4.5 [min−1 ], β = 0.825 [min−1 ], τp = 17 [min], τr = 20 [min], ν = 2. Note
that mRNA and protein concentrations are normalized by the half maximal effective concentration of the protein, or the constant pcrit in Hirata et al. (2004).
Theorem 1 implies that the frequency profile is essentially determined from Q, τ and
TA , whose meanings are listed in Table 1. Thus, these quantities are calculated from the
parameters as
Q = 0.674, τ = 2.23, TA = 16.6.

(42)

We obtain the frequency ̟ from Theorem 1 as ̟ = 0.523 [rad/min], from which the period
is calculated as
2π
= 120.1 [min].
̟

(43)

The numerical simulation of Hes7 concentrations indeed exhibits two-hour oscillations as
shown in Fig. 5. We see that Theorem 1 successfully predicted the frequency of oscillations
without simulating (40).
Remark 5. Hirata et al. (2004) showed that the period of oscillations is approximately
given by 2(τr + τp + ln(2)/a + ln(2)/b) with a and b defined by (41). This estimate provides
120.0 [min] in the above example. A more detailed comparison of Theorem 1 and the estimate
in Hirata et al. (2004) is shown in Appendix C. It should be emphasized that Theorem 1 is
useful for negative cyclic feedback networks consisting of any number of genes, while Hirata’s
estimate is applicable only for the self-repression case, i.e., N = 1.
Theorem 1 also allows us to obtain more general insights on the frequency profile. The
equation (25) implies that the parameters τ and Q are important for characterizing the
frequency. Based on Theorem 1, the relation between these parameters and the period
2π/̟ of oscillations is illustrated in Fig. 6. Note that Q stands for the discrepancy of
mRNA and protein degradation rates, and Q = 1.0 implies a = b = 0.0604[min−1]. We see
that the frequency is sensitive to the sum of transcription and translation delay τ = τr + τp
rather than Q. Thus, the transcription and translation delays play an important role in
regulating the two-hour cycle of the segmentation clock.

Biological Insights

In this section, we provide general biological insight based on Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.
Specifically, we illustrate how the profiles of oscillations depend on parameters and structures
of the network.

Figure 6: The period of Hes7 oscillations predicted from Theorem 1. The mean degradation
rate of mRNA and proteins is set as TA = 16.6, and R = 21.5, which is equivalent to the
parameters in (39). The oscillations illustrated in Fig. 5 correspond to the red point with
the caption “Hes7 oscillation example.”
Frequency: The frequency profile is given by (25) in Theorem 1. Let ̟
˜ be defined by
̟
˜ := ̟TA with TA in (8). From the definition, ̟
˜ is a frequency normalized by the mean
degradation rates of mRNA and proteins. Then, we can rewrite (25) as

where τ̃ is the time delay normalized by TA (see (8) for the definition). This implies that time
can be normalized by the mean degradation rates TA without loss of generality. Therefore,
the frequency profile can essentially be captured by the dimensionless quantities that appear
in (44).
We see that ̟
˜ depends only on the normalized time delay τ̃ , the number of genes N and
the discrepancy of the degradation rates Q (see Table 1 for the biological meanings). It is
worth noting that as a result of cyclic feedback, the mean time delay over all genes, τ̃ , plays
a decisive role rather than the individual delays at each gene. Thus, the frequency can be
less sensitive to the variation of the delays in intermediate reactions.
Looking more closely into (44), we obtain more quantitative relations between these parameters and the frequency as follows: the normalized frequency ̟
˜ monotonically increases
as
(i) the average time delay of transcription and translation process (τ̃ ) decreases
(ii) the number of genes (N ) decreases
(iii) the mRNA and protein degradation time gets close to each other.
These insights are confirmed by numerical simulations as shown in Fig. 7. Note that the
vertical axis is the period of oscillations, where the time is normalized by TA . We see that
the solution of (44) successfully predicts the oscillation profiles.

intact, while the frequency changes drastically.
In particular, it is observed that the period is almost linearly proportional to the mean
delay τ̃ . This observation is essentially consistent with the ones in Jensen et al. (2003); Monk
(2003) and Wang et al. (2004), where the period of oscillations was shown to be proportional
PN
to the total time delay i=1 (τri + τpi ) based on numerical simulations. In fact, we have

by approximating (44) with 1 + x2 ≃ 1+x2 /2 and cot(x) ≃ x−1 , and the normalized period
of oscillations 2π/̟
˜ is indeed proportional to the sum of delays in Fig. 7 (see Appendix D
for the details of the approximation).
Remark 6. The frequency profile obtained from (44) becomes less accurate, when the
parameters R and ν are so large that the oscillation waveforms are saturated, because the
analysis is based on (10). However, the authors have observed by numerical simulations that
the qualitative insights obtained above hold, even when the waveform is much distorted from
(10).
Phase: The phase of oscillations is given by (32). Since ̟∆τ = ̟∆τ̃
˜
with ∆τ̃i := ∆τi /TA ,
(32) can be rewritten with the dimensionless quantities shown in Table 1. We see that the
phase is determined from the activation and repression pattern Zi of the network and ̟∆τ̃
˜ i.
16

The constants ∆τ̃i are the discrepancy of the delay from the mean delay τ . Thus, the
delays have no impact on the phase profile if they are homogeneous, while they do have an
impact for the frequency profile. An example is illustrated in Fig. 8, where ∆τ = 0. We see
that only the frequency is affected by the difference of the mean delay τ̃ .
The phase profile can be summarized as follows.
(i) The difference of the individual time delays from the average τ̃ affects the phase of
oscillations.
(ii) The repression/activation of transcription causes phase delay/lead of the following
protein oscillations.

Conclusion

We have developed a systematic method to explore the profiles of oscillatory protein concentrations in biochemical networks with negative cyclic feedback. First, we have formulated
harmonic balance for biochemical oscillators. Then, the relation between the reaction rates
and the frequency, phase and amplitude of the oscillations has been analytically obtained.
The proposed method has been demonstrated with the Pentilator and the somitogenesis
clock, and the analysis result has shown quantitative agreement with the existing biological
experiments.
A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is that the oscillation profiles are written
in an analytic way. Thus, we can obtain detailed biological insight, which provides useful guidance in synthetic gene circuit design. We have revealed dimensionless parameters
that primarily encode the profiles of oscillations, and analyzed the qualitative properties of
frequency and phase in terms of these parameters.

A

Oscillation frequency for the case of heterogeneous
parameters

In this section, we first discuss the oscillation frequency under parametric perturbations to
ai , bi , ci and βi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ), then we show that Theorem 1, which is derived under
Assumption 2, is useful for analyzing the upper and lower bounds of the frequency. To
this end, we hereafter relax Assumption 2 and assume that the parameters belong to the
following set P.
P := {(ai , bi , ci , βi ) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) | ai ≤ ai ≤ ai , bi ≤ bi ≤ bi ,

ci ≤ ci ≤ ci , βi ≤ βi ≤ βi (i = 1, 2, · · · , N )},

(46)

where the symbols with a upper and a lower bar are the given upper and lower bounds of
each parameter, respectively.
We can verify that the frequency of oscillations can be obtained by (15) for the heterogeneous parameters as well. In particular, the following proposition shows that the upper and
lower bounds of the frequency is obtained by the analysis for extereme parameters.
Proposition 2.
Consider the gene regulatory networks modeled by (1). Suppose the
parameters (ai , bi , ci , βi ) (i = 1, 2, · · · , N ) belong to P. Then, the solution of (15) is bounded
by ̟ ≤ ̟ ≤ ̟, where ̟ and ̟ are the solutions of (15) for (ai , bi ) = (ai , bi ) and (ai , bi ) =
(ai , bi ), respectively. The parameters ci and βi do not affect the solution of (15).
Proof. We see that ̟ satisfies
|I − H(j̟)K1 | = 0 ⇐⇒ 1 +

N
Y

i=1

hi (j̟)|ξi | = 0.

(47)

This implies

−̟(τri + τpi−1 ) − ∠(ai + j̟) − ∠(bi + j̟) = −π.

(48)

We see from (48) that ̟ monotonically increases as ai and bi increase and that ci and βi
do not affect ̟. These observations immediately lead to Proposition 2.

Although this proposition shows that the parameters ci and βi do not affect the solution of
(15), this does not mean the waveform of oscillations does not depend on these parameters,
since the harmonic balance method is based on the approximation (10). In general, ci and
βi affect the amplitude of oscillations, and the oscillations tend to contain high frequency
components as ci and βi increase, which results in the degradation of the estimation by Theorem 1. Nevertheless, the qualitative properties are preserved for wide range of parameters
even for such cases as noted in Remark 6.
Let a := mini ai , b := mini bi , a := maxi ai and b := maxi bi . Then, it follows from
Proposition 2 that the upper and lower bounds of the frequency can be obtained by letting
(a, b) = (a, b) and (a, b) = (a, b) in Theorem 1, respectively. This means that Theorem
1, which is derived under Assumption 2, also provides some knowledge for the case of
heterogeneous parameters.

QN
Define X(s) := i=1,i6=ℓ,ℓ′ (φ(s)esτ −λi ). Then, we can write χ(s) = (φ(s)esτ −λℓ )(φ(s)esτ −
λℓ′ )X(s). It should be noted that H1 (s) is a retarded time delay system, thus the dominant
pole is located at the rightmost position in the complex plane.
In what follows, we prove the sufficient condition. It follows from the definition of Ωc+
that the roots of X(s) = 0 lie in the open left half complex plane. On the other hand,
φ(s)esτ − λℓ = 0 and φ(s)esτ − λℓ′ = 0 have at least one root at s = jω0 and s = −jω0 ,
respectively, and the rest in the open left half plane. In particular, the roots s = ±jω0 of
these equations are single roots, because ω0 satisfies |φ(jω0 )ejω0 τ | = |φ(jω0 )| = |λℓ | and
|φ(jω)| monotonically increases with respect to ω > 0. Therefore, H1 (s) has a pair of poles
at s = ±jω0 with multiplicity one, and the rest in the open left half plane.
The proof of the necessary condition is omitted, since it can be easily obtained from the
above discussion.

Comparison of Theorem 1 and the estimate in Hirata et al.
(2004)

In Hirata et al. (2004), the period of oscillations is analytically estimated as 2(τr + τp +
ln(2)/a + ln(2)/b, where a and b are defined by (41). We here compare the period obtained
from Theorem 1, Hirata et al. (2004) and numerical simulation of (40). The result is shown
in Fig. 9.
We see that Theorem 1 and Hirata et al. (2004) provide close estimation for a wide range
of time delay. The actual oscillation period starts to deviate from these estimations as the
time delay increases, because the waveform tends to be distorted. Nevertheless, the relative
error at τ = 50 [min] is −6.28% for Theorem 1 and −9.18% for the Hirata’s estimate. Thus,
these estimates can be useful for gaining qualitative insight of the oscillation period. Note
that Theorem 1 is useful for biochemical networks consisting of a large number of genes,
while the estimate in Hirata et al. (2004) is applicable only to the self-negative feedback
case, i.e. N = 1.
