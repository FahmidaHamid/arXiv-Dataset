Abstract
Using very precise (±0.05%) measurements of the growth parameters for bacteria E.
coli grown on minimal media, we aimed to determine the lowest deuterium
concentration at which the adverse effects that are prominent at higher enrichments
start to become noticeable. Such a threshold was found at 0.5% D, a surprisingly high
value, while the ultralow deuterium concentrations (≤0.25% D) showed signs of the
opposite trend. Bacterial adaptation for 400 generations in isotopically different
environment confirmed preference for ultralow (≤0.25% D) enrichment. This effect
appears to be similar to those described in sporadic but multiple earlier reports.
Possible explanations include hormesis and isotopic resonance phenomena, with the
latter explanation being favored.

Introduction
Since the discovery of D20 (heavy water) in 1932 by Urey, Brickwede and Murphy
[1], its biological effects have attracted a great deal of researchers’ interest. Already
early experiments have revealed that deuterium has profound effect on living
organisms. Between 1934 and the beginning of the second World war in 1939, a total
of 216 publications appeared dealing with biological effects of deuterium [2]. Excess
of deuterium in water was found to cause reduction in synthesis of proteins and
nucleic acids, disturbance in cell division mechanism, changes in enzymatic kinetic
rates and cellular morphological changes [3,4]. Yet it is possible to grow
microorganisms (e.g. some variants of Escherichia coli) in a highly substituted
medium, and achieve almost complete deuterium substitution [5,6].
The biological effects of stable isotopes are usually observed shortly after the
microorganism is placed in an isotopically different medium [7]. At first, prokaryotic
cells experiences an “isotopic shock” manifested through the growth arrest and
morphology changes. After a period of adaptation (“lag phase”), growth resumes, but
the rate is usually slower than in normal isotopic environment [8]. The changes in the
growth rate can be explained by the impact of isotopic substitutions on the kinetics of
enzymes [9], pattern of hydrogen bonds and similar relatively subtle but cumulatively
potentially important effects.
The Katz group who have studied multiple heavy-isotope (13C,

15

N and

18

O)

substitutions in Chlorella vulgaris grown in heavy water found that all additional
isotopic substitutions resulted into abnormal effects in cell size, appearance, growth
rate and division [10]. The effects were progressively stronger as the isotopic
composition deviated from the normal. The authors concluded that “organisms of
3

different isotopic compositions are actually different organisms, to the degree that
their isotopic compositions are removed from naturally occurring compositions” [10].
The question is whether this conclusion made for heavy enrichments levels
(>50%) remains true for low levels of enrichment (<10%). Since isotopic
compositions of microorganisms grown in a slightly enriched environment showed
deficit of heavy isotopes [11], one can reasonably assume that even low levels of
deuterium enrichment may cause biological effects. Indeed, the earliest works on
biological effect of deuterium reported in the 1930s were performed using low levels
of deuterium, as high enrichment was still not available. Barnes et al. studied the
physiological effect of low deuterium concentration on the growth of Spirogyra,
flatworms and Euglena. They found an increased growth of these three organisms at
0.06% of D in water compared to ordinary water that contains 156 ppm D (0.0156%).
More specifically, they observed increased cell division for Euglena, longer longevity
for flatworms, and both less cell disjunction and greater longevity for Spirogyra [12–
15]. Lockemann and Leunig’s study on the effect of heavy water with less than 0.54%
D upon E. coli and Pseudomonasa revealed that concentrations as low as 0.04% D
favored growth [16]. Curry et al. observed ca. 10% faster growth for Aspergillus at
0.05% D, but the result was not statically significant due to large errors of
measurements [17]. After the first half of 1930s, the research focus has shifted to the
effects of highly enriched deuterium, which were more pronounced and largely
negative. The interested to low deuterium enrichment has returned in the 1970s and
1980s, when Lobyshev et al. studied the Na, K-ATPase activity at different
concentration of deuterium and found it to increase at low deuterium concentrations,
with a maximum reached at 0.04-0.05% [18,19]. Lobyshev et al. then performed
experiments with regeneration of hydrioid pohyps Obelia geniculata in a wide range
4

of deuterium added to sea water and found faster regeneration at and below 0.1% D
[20]. Somlyai et al. have shown that 0.06% D in tissue culture activated the growth of
L929 fibroblast cell lines [21]. Nikitin et al. have studied growth of bacteria with
different membrane lipid composition in liquid media in a range of deuterium
concentration in water varied from 0.01% to 90% and observed pronounced activation
in growth for Methylobacterium organopholium and Hyphomonas jannaschiane at
around 0.01% enrichment [22]. Recent studies on the impact of D2O on the life span
of Drosophila melanogaster revealed the biggest positive effect of deuterium at the
lowest D concentration tested in that work, 7.5% of enrichment [23].
In the current study, we probed enrichment levels starting from 0.03%, i.e.
double the normal deuterium abundance of 156 ppm. Disregarding the earliest reports
from 1930s on the biological effects of 0.06% deuterium in water which suffered
from the lack of statistical analysis and proper controls, we expected the size of the
biological effects to be commensurable with the enrichment levels, i.e. to be
exquisitely small. To address the expected minute size of the phenomena, we
developed a very sensitive method for detecting the biological effects of unspecific
deuterium incorporation in the model organism. E. coli was chosen as such because of
the ease of handling, robustness and speed of growth as well as the ability to thrive on
minimal media with easily changeable isotopic composition.
The applied method utilizes robotized sample preparation, automated and
massively parallel data acquisition (hundreds of individual experiments per
concentration point) and measures three independent parameters per growth curve:
maximum growth rate, the lag phase duration and maximum density (Figure 1).
Massive parallel measurement approach is achieved using the BioScreen C automated
fermentor that affords up to 200 experiments run at the same time. Every second
5

experimental well in a 100-well plate was kept at standard isotopic conditions (Figure
S1), and the data from each “test” well was normalized by that of the neighboring
standard well, providing the accuracy of relative measurements close to those
achieved with internal standard. Using massive statistics, we achieved the precision of
relative measurements close to 0.05% (standard error).
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Materials
Glycerol stock of E. coli BL 21 strain (stored at -80 oC) was obtained from the
microbiology lab of our department. The M9 minimal media [24] was prepared using
D-glucose

(C6H12O6),

disodium

hydrogen

phosphate

(Na2HPO4.2H2O),

monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium sulfate
(MgSO4), calcium chloride (CaCl2), ammonia chloride (NH4Cl), all purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany), and distilled water prepared with a Milli-Q
device from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). Heavy water (99.9% of 2H) was also
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany).
Vacuum filtration system with 0.2 µm polyethersulfone (PES) membrane for
bacteria media sterilization was purchased from VWR (Stockholm, Sweden). Petri
dishes (90 x 14 mm) and inoculating sterile loops were purchased from SigmaAldrich. Sterile plastic conical tubes (50 mL and 15 mL) for sample preparation were
purchased from Sarstedt (Nümbrecht, Germany).

The BioScreen C automatic

fermentor was obtained from Oy Growth Curves AB Ltd (Helsinki, Finland).
M9 minimal media preparation

6

5-time concentrated M9 minimal salts stock solution was prepared by dissolving 42.5
g Na2HPO4. 2H2O, 15 g KH2PO4 and 2.5 g NaCl in Milli-Q water to a final volume of
1000 mL. The solution was then sterilized by autoclaving and stored at 4 oC for
further use. To prepare M9 minimal media, the salts stock solution was diluted five
times in Milli-Q water.
M9 minimal media were prepared by mixing the following components: 800
mL Milli-Q water, 200 mL M9 concentrated salts stock solution, 2 mL of 1 M MgSO4
solution, 0.1 mL of 1 M CaCl2 solution, 5 g D-glucose (C6H12O6) and 1 g NH4Cl.
Preparation of streak agar plates
M9 minimal media agar plates were prepared by dissolving 3 g of agar powder in 200
mL M9 minimal media. The obtained mixture was sterilized by autoclaving, then
cooled down to ca. 60 oC and finally poured into Petri dishes (ca. 15 mL agar solution
per plate). The agar plates were allowed to solidify at room temperature for ca. 10
min, sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 oC till further use.
E. coli streak agar plates were prepared by streaking [25] E. coli from -80 oC
glycerol stock onto M9 minimal media agar plate followed by 40-hour incubation at
37 oC to form visible isolated colonies. Streak agar plates were stored for experiments
for maximum one week at 4 oC.
Measurement of E. coli growth
From the E. coli agar plate, one isolated colony was picked with a sterile loop into 5
mL M9 minimal media and incubated at 37 oC while shaking with 200 r.p.m for 5-6
hours until it reached its early exponential phase with optical density (OD590) around
0.2, measured with Colorimeter WPA CO75 (York, UK).

Sample preparation workflow is shown in Figure 2. In each experiment, four
stock solutions were used. Stock A for preparing sample S A, and stock B for
preparing sample SB were obtained by mixing M9 minimal media with sterilized
heavy water at a certain ratio (Table 1). For the preparation of stock solutions of
standard A and standard B, M9 minimal media were mixed with sterile Milli-Q water
at the same ratio as stock A and stock B. The final solutions were dispensed into the
honeycomb well plates using programmed robotic system (Tecan, Genesis RSP 150,
Männedorf, Switzerland).
A 20 µL aliquot of the incubated E. coli culture (O.D. ≈ 0.2) was diluted in 45
mL M9 minimal media for robotic sample preparation. First, 300 µL M9 minimal
media without bacteria were introduced into each of the border wells (“edge cells”) on
both plates PA and PB (72 wells in total) to serve as blank samples (no color code in
Figure S1). Second, 30 µL (10 µL for samples with <4% enrichment of deuterium)
aliquot of stock A was dispensed into each “sample” well (marked with purple on
plate PA in Figure S1) to prepare 32 replicates of sample SA. Third, 30 µL (10 µL for
samples with <4% enrichment of deuterium) aliquot of stock solution of standard A
was added into each “standard” well (marked with yellow on plate P A in Figure S1) to
prepare 32 reference standards on plate. In the same way, wells were filled on plate
PB. Finally, 270 µL (290 µL for <4% D) of the diluted E. coli culture was dispensed
into each well except blank wells. In total, 32 replicate pairs of “sample” and
“standard” wells were prepared on each plate. Sample configuration is shown in
Figure S1.
Bioscreen C monitors E. coli concentration in each well by measuring
turbidity (with wide band filter 420–580 nm) in it at 39 oC with continuous bacterial

8

agitation by shaking. In our experiments, turbidity was sampled every six minutes and
was monitored for ca. 24 hours.
E. coli adaptation to different deuterium content
One E. coli colony was inoculated into 5 mL M9 minimal media (normal isotopic
condition) from a fresh M9 minimal media agar plate, and cultured at 37 oC until O.D.
1.0. For every deuterium concentration point (156 ppm, 0.03%, 0.25%, and 1%), 2 µL
E. coli culture was diluted 2500 times into 5 mL M9 minimal media with the
corresponding D content and cultured overnight at 37 oC. After the culture reached its
maximum density (O.D. ≈ 1.4), for each E. coli culture, 10 µL was then diluted 500
times into 5 mL media with the same D content, and culturing continued at 37 oC. In
this way, each E.coli culture was diluted 500 times twice a day, with nine generations
grown between dilutions.

The process continued until the 400th generation was

obtained, after which the difference in the rate of growth of the adapted bacteria on
the corresponding content of deuterium versus normal D content was measured using
Bioscreen C.

Data Analysis
Using Microsoft Excel, the logarithm of turbidity was plotted against time (Figure 1).
The slope for every 8-h interval was calculated, and the maximum value was
determined. The extrapolation of the line with maximum slope to the background
level of turbidity gave the lag time. The maximum turbidity for each replicate was
taken as the maximum density. The obtained three values for each growth curve were
treated in the same way as below.

9

For each “sample” A, the obtained value was normalized by that of the
“standard” B. To minimize the influence of nonstatistical outliers that could arise due
to gross errors in sample preparation and handling (e.g. robot or BioScreen C
malfunction), the 32 replicates were divided into 4 groups according to their positions
on the honey comb well plate (group 1: columns 1 and 2; …, group 4: columns 7 and
8). In each group, the median of the eight values was calculated and then the four
medians were averaged to obtain the value for a given plate and its standard deviation.
Altogether, nine independent 32-replicate experiments were performed for each D
content point and six experiments per each D point for adapted bacteria. To
compensate for small systematic errors of measurement (e.g., differences in the
geometry of the honeycomb wells, position-dependent sensitivity of the BioScreen C
detector, etc.), the obtained average values of the maximum growth rate, lag time as
well as the maximum density within each experiment were normalized to that of the
sample with terrestrial D composition (156 ppm). The final result was obtained when
the average of 9x4=36 (6x4=24 for adapted bacteria) median values, and the
corresponding standard error, were calculated. Since after normalization, the values
for terrestrial composition were all unities, the p-values for non-terrestrial
compositions were calculated using two-tailed, paired Student’s t-test comparing the
relative value R and its inverse 1/R.
Results and Discussion
High enrichment (50% D). To learn the behavior of the growth parameters at high
enrichment, bacteria were grown first at 50% D. The growth curve showed significant
deviation from the normal (Figure 1), with the growth rate reduced by ca. 5%,
maximum density increased by ca. 15% and the lag phase extended by almost 40%
10

(Figure S2). While reduction in the growth rate and lag time extension were expected
based on abundant previous research, the increase in maximum density was
surprising: at adverse growth conditions, the maximum density usually follows the
declining growth rate trend. The increase in maximum density at 50% D, or at least
the magnitude of the increase, could be overestimated by the optical density
measurements if the optical properties of the deuterated bacteria are different than that
of bacteria with normal D content. Indeed, literature suggests that the size and shape
of the bacteria may be quite distorted when grown in a highly deuterated media,
especially in the beginning of growth [3,4,7]. If this is the case, and the maximum
density at 50% D is overestimated, then the growth rate reduction at 50% D may be
underestimated in our measurements. However, both these possible effects should be
relatively small at <10% D, and especially at <1% D. Besides, our prime goal was to
identify the lowest concentration of deuterium at which biological effects become
detectable. Thus we did not make any corrections for these hypothetical effects in
low-enrichment measurements.
Low enrichment (<10% D). Growth behavior of E. coli in minimal media under ten
different content of deuterium (including 156 ppm, 0.03%, 0.06%, 0.1%, 0.25%,
0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 8%) were investigated, starting with 156 ppm of deuterium
(terrestrial condition) and increasing the content of deuterium by a factor of 2 until ca.
10% D is reached. In each run of the BioScreen C instrument, E. coli was grown in
minimal media on two honey comb well plates each containing wells with two
different contents of deuterium, one always being the normal D content (156 ppm),
giving 32 replicates for each plate (vide infra). This way, five runs were required to
cover the entire range of deuterium content, which constituted one experiment.

11

Figure 3A shows the normalized maximum growth rate. The curve is trending
downwards, but only at the highest enrichment the statistical significance at p<0.05 is
reached. The observed trend significantly (by a factor of 4) lags behind the linear
extrapolation of the 50% D results to low-enrichment levels (i.e., a 5% slower growth
at 50% D means growth rate ≈ 1 - 0.001*%D).
In contrast, the lag phase curve (Figure 3B) fluctuates at ultralow enrichment
levels slightly below the normal level. But after 0.1% D, the lag time increases
dramatically, reaching statistical significance at 0.5% D. The curve lags behind the
linear prediction by a factor of two. Even if linear extrapolation is made based on 8%
D results instead of 50% D, the actual trend remains below the predicted one.
The maximum density curve (Figure 3C) shows surprising behavior: at the
lowest enrichment level of 0.03% D amounting to only twice the normal D content,
there is a small but significant (p<0.05) peak corresponding to a ≈0.16% higher
density. The increase in the maximum density continues at higher D content, and
vanishes at 0.25% D, to increase again above the significance level at 1% D. For the
interval 0.2% - 4% D, the maximum density curves lags behind the linear
extrapolation, but at 8% D it actually exceeds it, increasing by 3.2% compared to the
predicted 2.4%.
Summarizing the above observations, the effects typical for high D
enrichment (slower growth, longer lag and higher maximum density), start to be
noticeable at 0.5% D. This is a surprisingly high threshold, given that the 0.05%
precision of the measurements would allow us to detect with statistical significance as
small changes in growth parameters as 0.1%. According to the 50% D results, if the
effect of D content on E. coli growth was linear, the expected detection threshold for
12

biological effects would be around 0.1-0.2% D. That no significant change was
detected at 0.25% D indicates the presence of a previously unreported threshold for
isotopic phenomena. Moreover, the results hint on the existence of an “inverted
region” at ultralow enrichment levels with statistically significant fluctuations in the
direction of higher comfort, rather than adverse reaction as at ≥0.5% D. The existence
of such a region would be in agreement with previous studies, even though many of
the actually found much bigger effects than were observed in our experiments [12–
22].
Validity of ultralow enrichment effect. The biological effect at <0.25% D in our study
does not result from one or two aberrantly high measurements: in six out of nine
constituent experiments, the maximum density was enhanced compared to normal %
D. Another way to test the validity is to investigate the variability of measurements:
usually, stronger biological effect results in larger variability. Indeed, the standard
error of the maximum density determination at normal D content was 0.05%, while
for 8% D it was five times larger, 0.25%. At 0.03% D, the corresponding standard
error was 0.08%, which is the highest value for all measurements below 1% D. Also
for the other two growth parameters, the maximum growth rate and the lag phase, the
standard error at 0.03% D was higher than at normal conditions. Curiously, of all the
data points, only 0.03% D shows an increase (however slight and statistically
insignificant) in the maximum growth rate on Figure 3A. Another supporting
evidence in favor of the opposite trend at ultralow enrichment is the fact that, at such
enrichment, all three growth parameters lag behind the trend extrapolated from 50%
D measurements, and two out of three (lag phase and maximum density) – of the
trend extrapolated from 8% D results. These results speak in favor of the validity of
the biological effect at 0.03% D.
13

The effect at the ultralow enrichment levels, assuming it is real, in unlike that
at high enrichments. While the growth rate does not change, the lag phase shortens
(although insignificantly in statistical sense), and the maximum density increases
above the expected trend. Overall, it’s a signature of growth in a more comfortable
environment. In contrast, at high enrichments the signature is definitely that of a
more hostile environment, with a very long lag phase and slower growth. What is
common for both regimes, though, is the increased maximum density, but the origins
of this effect may differ (vide supra).
How to explain the presumed effect of ultralow deuterium enrichment on
bacterial growth? The previous research has not produced any convincing explanation
[12–22], which probably was one of the factors why this research has largely became
forgotten. One of possible explanations is the effect of hormesis. The concept of
hormesis suggests that, at low dosages, the effects of adverse agents (e.g. chemical
toxins or radiation) can be stimulating for growth. Hormetic effect on E. coli growth
has previously been detected at low concentrations of chemical toxins [26]. However,
the size of the effect in our study (≈0.16% in maximum density) is disproportionally
large compared to the enrichment degree (0.032% D, or +0.016% D compared to
normal composition, Figure S3), which speaks against the role of hormesis in the
studied situation.
Adaptation to ultralow enrichment conditions. Hormesis is usually explained by
activation of protecting mechanisms that, in effect, boost the growth at low
concentrations of adverse agents. But gradual adaptation of the organism to slightly
adverse environment should increase the threshold for activation and thus reduce this
effect. To test this hypothesis, we grew bacteria for ca. 400 generations at normal
isotopic conditions, 0.03% D, 0.25% D and 1% D, changing the media every 12 hours
14

(Figure S4). After that, the growth parameters in the same media were measured,
using as control the same adapted bacteria growing at normal isotopic conditions.
Adaptation has dramatically reduced the lag time from 10-11 h to 6-7 h, and increased
the maximum growth rate as well as the maximum density by about 15-20% (Figure
S5). The directions of the changes in growth parameters are consistent with bacteria
feeling much more comfortable in the minimal media after adaptation.
In the isotopically different environment, the growth rate has increased by
0.10-0.15% at ultralow enrichment (p<0.05 at 0.25%, Figure 4A), while the lag time
has increased insignificantly by the same amount (Figure 4B). The maximum density
has shown most significant changes of ca. 0.2% (p<0.05, Figure 4C) at 0.25% D, but
was elevated also at 0.03% D.

Overall, two out of three parameters showed

statistically significant changes characteristic for better adaptation in isotopically
different environment compared to normal media. Note that at 1% D this effect
disappeared.
Strictly speaking, deuterium is not toxic for E. coli, as this organism can grow
at very high enrichment levels. Even at 50% D, the maximum growth rate is only
slightly (5%) lower than at normal conditions.

Therefore, deuterium enriched

medium is more correctly characterized as an unusual, rather than toxic, environment.
Thus the applicability of the hormetic explanation to ultralow deuterium enrichment is
questionable.
An alternative to hermetic explanation could be provided by the isotopic
resonance hypothesis [27]. Briefly, the hypothesis suggests that, at certain isotopic
compositions of the elements C, H, N and O that together compose ≥96% of the living
matter of prokaryotes and many eukaryotes, the rate of all chemical and biochemical
15

reactions, including the bacterial growth, should increase. Normal terrestrial isotopic
compositions are very close to one such resonance. The existing small deviation from
the perfect resonance, suggests the hypothesis, can be corrected by “tuning” the
isotopic composition of any of the elements C, H, N and O. After such tuning the
growth rate of all organisms should slightly increase. The size of the effect is not
predicted, but the required value of the D content for the perfect “terrestrial” isotopic
resonance is close to 0.03% [28]. Since the isotopic composition of water inside the E.
coli bacteria has much lower deuterium enrichment compared to the growth media
[29], the resonance conditions should occur in the region 0.03-0.06% of D. Such an
agreement between the predictions of the hypothesis and the experiment could be
spurious, but it receives strong support from earlier studies [12–22]. Taken together,
these results suggest that the growth behavior of E. coli and other organisms at
ultralow enrichment levels well worth exploring further, using even more precise
measurements.
Conclusions
Here we studied the growth behavior of E. coli at low enrichment levels of
deuterium, and found that the adverse effects characteristic for high enrichment levels
become noticeable at 0.5% D, which is several times higher level than expected given
the 0.05% precision of our measurements. This discrepancy highlights the “buffering
capacity” of living organisms that can partially compensate the adverse nature of the
isotopically altered growth medium by reduced incorporation levels of heavy isotopes
[28]. On the other hand, there seems to be a small but significant fingerprint of more
comfortable environment at an ultralow enrichment level of 0.03% D. This behavior,
which begs for additional verification by more precise measurements, could be
explained by both hormesis as well as the isotopic resonance hypothesis. The latter
16

theory predicts the exact location of the “resonance” at ≈0.03%-0.06% D, which is in
a broad agreement with sporadic but multiple earlier reports [12–22].

Stock solution (column one) was prepared by mixing M9 minimal media and heavy
water at a certain ratio that resulted in the final D content in the sample (column four).
For each sample, stock solution for its corresponding standards (below it is called
stock solution of standard X) was prepared in the same way but using Milli-Q water
instead of heavy water.
