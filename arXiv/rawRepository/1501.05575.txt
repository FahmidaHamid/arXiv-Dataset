We study the ordering kinetics in d = 2 ferromagnets which corresponds to populated neuron
activities with long-ranged interactions, V (r) ∼ r −n associated with short-ranged interaction. We
present the results from comprehensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the nonconserved Ising
model with n ≥ 2. Our results of long-ranged neuron kinetics are consistent with the same dynamical
behavior of short-ranged case (n > 4). The calculated characteristic length scale in long-ranged
interaction is found to be n dependent (L(t) ∼ t1/(n−2) ), whereas short-ranged interaction follows
L(t) ∼ t1/2 law and approximately preserve universality in domain kinetics. Further, we did the
comparative study of phase ordering near the critical temperature which follows different behaviours
of domain ordering near and far critical temperature but follows universal scaling law.

INTRODUCTION

The spiking activity in complex neuron network in
brain is dynamic (far from equilibrium) [1], exhibit
nonequilibrium critical dynamics [2] and the criticality
in it has been used to characterize brain signals [3]. The
reason could be when such system is quenched from a
homogeneous phase to a broken-symmetry phase, it becomes thermodynamically unstable. The subsequent farfrom-equilibrium evolution of the system is characterized
by the emergence and growth of domains enriched in
the new equilibrium phases. This nonequilibrium evolution, usually called kinetics of phase ordering or domain
growth, has been the subject of much active investigation
[4]. The domain morphology is quantified by the time
dependence of the domain scale L(t), where t is the time
after the quench. There is a good understanding of domain growth kinetics in pure and isotropic systems with
short-ranged interactions, where the domain scale shows
a power-law behavior, L(t) ∼ tφ [5, 6]. For the case with
nonconserved order parameter, e.g., ordering of a ferromagnet into up and down phases (spin-flip Glauber-Ising
model [7]), one has φ = 1/2 [8, 9]. On the other hand,
for the case with conserved order parameter, e.g., phase
separation of a binary (AB) mixture into A- and B-rich
domains (spin-exchange Kawasaki-Ising model [10]), we
have φ = 1/3 when growth is driven by diffusion [11, 12].
Apart from the domain growth laws, experimentalists
are also interested in quantitative features of the domain
morphologies. An important experimental quantity is the
time-dependent correlation function C(~r, t) or its Fourier
transform, structure factor S(~k, t) (~k being the wave vector [4, 5]. Most of the studies are concentrated around
the nearest-neighbor (short-range) inter-molecular interaction.
The neuron activities in brain at critical point are believed to be effective for the long distance communication
of the neurons [13] because of coupling and variability to

optimize information storage in the system [14] and dynamic range of the system to response the input signal
[15]. The core of the paper focuses on long-range interactions which dynamically explains the rapid movement of
the signal information inside the brain. The fast emergence of long-range interactions, mimic the rapid neuronal interactions in the brain. Further, we study the
phase ordering dynamics in neurons with a specific interest to understand the role of the range of inter-neuron
interactions. We address two important questions in this
context via kinetic MC simulations: (a) What is the
growth law for ordering phases of neurons? Is the growth
law independent of the range of interaction? (b) What is
the morphology for ordering phases of neurons, as measured by the correlation function and structure factor?
Is it comparable for all interaction range? We will be
providing the answers to the above questions from our
extensive MC simulations.

NEURON ACTIVITY PATTERN MODEL

Brain can be considered as a complex network of
neurons which can be mapped onto ferromagnetic Ising
model with two spin interactions [16], where random firing or non-firing of neuron can be represented by two
states of a spin, s = +1 for firing and s = −1 for rest or
non-firing neurons [17]. Even though neuron activity pattern model is far from equilibrium dynamic model [18],
Ising model can be serve an excellent model to deal with
critical phenomena of neuron activity pattern [1]. The
large number of local (short range) interaction of neurons
[19] and significant amount of global (long range) interaction of neurons [20] are main basis of neurons communication in brain network [21]. We consider the following
Hamiltonian of two dimensional Ising system which in-

where J is the coupling strength, n characterizes the
range of the interaction, rij = |~ri − ~rj |, and si denotes
the spin variable at site i. We consider two state spins:
si = +1 denotes an up-spin (active neurons) and si = −1
denotes a down-spin (passive neurons). We consider only
a ferromagnetic case, where J > 0 always. The case
where J can be both > 0 (ferromagnetic) and < 0 (antiferromagnetic) is relevant to spin glasses. We associate
stochastic dynamics with the Ising model by placing it
in contact with a heat bath. The appropriate dynamics for the phase ordering problem is spin-flip kinetics or
Glauber kinetics.

Since it is very difficult to obtain exact analytical solution of this problem, we straightforward implement a
MC simulation of the Ising model with spin-flip kinetics
to understand the behaviour. In a single step of MC dynamics, we choose a spin at random in the lattice of distribution of spins. The change in energy ∆H that would
occur if the spin was flipped is computed with the step of
acceptance or rejection based on Metropolis acceptance

One Monte Carlo step (MCS) is completed when this
algorithm is performed N times (where N is the total
number of spins), regardless of whether the move is accepted or rejected. All our simulations have been performed on a d = 2 lattice of size L2s (Ls = 512) with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. The statistical quantities presented here (e.g., correlation function,
structure factor) are obtained as averages over 10 independent runs. Each run starts with a randomly-mixed
state with equal numbers of up (fired) and down (inactive) spins (neurons), which corresponds to a mean magnetization m = hsi i = 0.

vanishes, whereas below Tc it takes a nonzero value, inducing the typical behavior of a ferromagnet. Therefore,
the physical properties of such systems and so its phase
states depend on the value for the magnetization, the parameter which is termed as order parameter: an ordered
phase in which the spins are aligned appears when m 6= 0,
while m = 0 implies a disordered (or symmetric) phase.
Since, Tc ’s for n ≥ 4 are very close to each-other and
hence, exhibit qualitatively similar behavior (explained
shortly). We thus consider n < 4 cases for the longranged interaction. For each value of n, we cut-off the
interaction at rc = (2.5)6/n to accelerate our simulation
[29]. We stress that the simulations are numerically very
demanding for larger cut-offs. We compute several statistical quantities to characterize the system. These are
described as follows.

FIG. 2. Evolution snapshots of domain coarsening for n = 2,
3, and 6 quenched at T = 1 below Tc at time t = 100, 500. The
snapshots are obtained from a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
of ordering kinetics in ferromagnetic system. The details of
the MC simulation are provided in the text.

(b) Plot of S(k, t)L−2 vs. kL, corresponding to the data sets
in (a). The reasonably good data collapse shows that the
scaling functions do not depend on the interaction range. The
solid line denotes the OJK function in Eq. (12) [33].

The domain coarsening is characterized by a growing
time-dependent length scale L(t). The domain morphology does not change with time, apart from a scale factor.
A direct consequence of the existence of a unique length
scale is that the system exhibits a dynamical-scaling in
the correlation function and structure factor. We compute the time-dependent correlation function:
C (~ri , ~rj ; t) ≡ hsi sj i − hsi i hsj i .

FIG. 3. (a) Scaling plot of C(r, t) vs. r/L for a phase ordering dynamics in d = 2 for n = 2. The data sets (for
t = 100, 200, 500) collapse onto a single master curve. (b)
Similar plot for n = 6.

We study LSM for several values of n, namely 2, 3,
4, 6, and 12. The critical ordering temperatures, Tc (n)
for each n case is shown in Fig. 1, where the characteristic behavior of spontaneous magnetization (< si >)
is plotted against temperature (T ). As expected, Tc (n)
(dotted lines) increases with decreasing n as evident from
equation (5). Above Tc the spontaneous magnetization

Here, the angular brackets denote an averaging over the
independent initial ensemble and different noise realizations. As the system is translationally invariant, the correlation function depends only on ~r = ~rj − ~ri :
C (~ri , ~rj ; t) = C (~ri , ~ri + ~r; t) = C (~r, t) .

(9)

Usually most experiments study the structure factor,
which is the Fourier transform of the real-space correlation function:
  Z
~
S ~k, t = d~r C (~r, t) eik·~r .
(10)
Since the system is isotropic, we can improve statistics
by spherically averaging the correlation function and the

4
structure factor. The corresponding quantities are denoted as C (r, t) and S (k, t), respectively. The correlation function and structure factor obey the dynamical
scaling forms:
C(r, t)

= g[r/L(t)],

S(k, t) = L(t)d f [kL(t)].

(11)

Here, g(x) and f (p) are scaling functions; r is the separation between two spatial points; k is the magnitude
of the wave vector; and d is the system dimensionality.
The characteristic domain size L(t) is obtained as the distance over which the correlation function decays to some
fraction (say half) of its maximum value [C(r, t) = 1
at r = 0]. There are several other suitable definitions
for computing L(t), e.g., first zero-crossing of C(r, t), inverse of the first moment of S(k, t). In the scaling regime,
all these definitions differ only by constant multiplicative
factors [30–32].

with each other and there is no spatial structure in the
evolution morphology. For larger values of n, we see the
emergence and growth of domains of up-spin (marked in
black) and down-spin (unmarked). These domains interact and annihilate, resulting in coarsening of the characteristic length scale, and therefore, domain patterns
at different times look statistically similar, apart from a
global change of scale. The domain size at a fixed time
(e.g., t = 500) is smaller for larger values of n.
In Fig. 3, we show a scaling plot of the correlation function, defined in Eq. (8). We plot C(r, t) as a function of
the scaled distance r/L at three times, as indicated. Figure 3(a) corresponds to n = 2, and Fig. 3(b) shows data
for n = 6. The data sets show a neat scaling collapse,
confirming the validity of dynamical scaling.

L(t) for n = 2, 3, 4, 6, plotted on a log-log scale. The lines

for phase ordering in d = 2 ferromagnetic system.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

In Fig. 2, we show the evolution snapshots obtained
from our MC simulations for n = 2, 3, 6 with T = 1
(< Tc , see Fig. 1) at t = 100, 500 MCS. At low temperatures, energetic effects are dominant and the system
minimizes its energy by ordering the spins parallel to each
other. In the absence of an external field (e.g., magnetic
field, h = 0), the activated neuron (up-spin) and inactivated neuron (down-spin) states are equivalent. In the
mean-field (MF) limit, i.e., n = 0, all the spins interact

FIG. 6. Evolution snapshots of phase ordering systems in
d = 2 for n = 2, 3, and 6. The system is quenched at T ≃ Tc .
The MC simulations are described in the text.

Let us next discuss whether the evolution morphology
depends on the range of the interaction characterized by
n. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the scaling functions for
four different n values (n = 2, 3, 4, 6) at a time t = 500,
when the system is already in the scaling regime. In
Fig. 4(a), we plot the scaled correlation functions. The
reasonably good data collapse suggests that the scaling
functions do not depend on the interaction range. The
solid line in Fig. 4(a) denotes the analytical result due to

in a ferromagnet. The OJK function is

C(r, t) = sin−1 (e−r /L ).
(12)
π
(The corresponding result for the case with vector order parameter has been obtained by Bray and Puri [34].)
Our correlation-function data is in excellent agreement
with the OJK function, showing that the phase ordering
dynamics for n < 4 lie in the same dynamical universality class as that for n > 4. In Fig. 4(b), we plot the
scaled structure factor [L−2 S(k, t) vs. kL] for the same
time as in Fig. 4(a). Again, the data sets collapse neatly
onto a single master curve, confirming the scaling form
in Eq. (11). The scaling function is in excellent agreement with the corresponding OJK function. Notice that
the structure factor, for large values of k, follows the
well-known Porod’s law, S(k, t) ∼ k −(d+1) , which results
from scattering off sharp interfaces [35, 36]. The scaled
correlation function and structure factor, in congruence
with scale free behaviour of functional brain networks [37]
depicts the universality of the interaction mechanism in
both short and long range interactions in brain.
In Fig. 5, we turn our attention to the time-dependence
of the domain size. We plot L(t) vs. t on a log-log scale
for n = 2, 3, 4 and 6. Here, the data sets are consistent
with the Cahn-Allen growth law, L(t) ∼ t1/2 −there is no
sign of a crossover in the growth law at n = 4, as predicted by Bray [38]. Bray has used the renormalization
group (RG) approach to study ordering dynamics with
long-ranged interactions of the form rd+σ with 0 < σ < 2.
In our case, d = 2 and σ = n − 2. Bray argues that the
long-ranged interactions are relevant for 0 < σ < 2 or
2 < n < 4, and irrelevant for n > 4. The corresponding
growth law is
 1/(n−2)
t
for 2 < n < 4,
L(t) ∼
t1/2
for n > 4,
with possible logarithmic corrections. As we can see that
our numerical results are not consistent with this prediction. The only difference as n is varied is that we
have faster growth (higher prefactors) for smaller n, corresponding to more long-ranged interactions. The fast
dynamics of long-range interactions signifies the path of
information processing and neuronal connections in the
brain. The longer persistance of long-ranged neural connections could give sense to clustering behaviour of neural
circuitry , specifically during learning of a specific task,
new synaptic connections tend to form in vicinity of old
connections related to that task [39] making it more robust.
In Fig. 6, we show the evolution of the order parameter
(m) near critical temperature (T ≃ Tc ) from a disordered
initial state (m = 0) for n = 2, 3, and 6 respectively. At
higher temperature below Tc we observe large fluctuations in the evolution patterns with very small global ordering; instead of picking one of the up-spin, down-spin,

or zero order parameter states, the system near Tc is a
kind of fractal blend of all three [40]. However the cluster
size is larger for smaller n. Recall that at T = 1 (≪ Tc ),
thermal energy (kB T ) of the system is low, thus spins
try to obtain minimal energy by forming domains with a
global ordering: m = +1 or -1.

MCS. (b) Sacling plot of C(r, t) vs. r/L, corresponding to the
data sets in (a). The solid line denotes the OJK function for
the scaled correlation function in Eq. (11).

Finally, in Fig. 7(a), we show the plot of correlation
function [C(r, t) vs. r] corresponding to the evolution
shown in Fig. 7 at t = 500. Note that the decay range
of the correlation function is larger for smaller n. Figure 7(b) shows the scaling plot of the data sets in (a). A
reasonable data collapse confirms the dynamical scaling
and clarifies that the system for each n belongs to the
same dynamical universality class.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Let us conclude this paper with a summary and discussion of the results presented here. We study the effect of
interaction range on the morphology of neuron activity
pattern. The long-ranged and short-ranged interaction of
neurons could be the main basis of how brain performs
complicated functions at fundamental level. Neuron activities as well as wiring and rewiring of the neurons in
the network subjected to heat bath depend on the range
of interaction which are reflected in the dependence of
critical temperature Tc and magnetization on n. The domain sizes of the neurons in short range interaction at
far-lower critical temperature are smaller; some are isolated and numbers are more as compared to long ranged
interaction for any time domain. However, the domain
dynamics both in short and long ranged interaction system is quite different as compared to far critical temperature dynamics due to emergence of more randomness in
the domain organization in the system. This leads to the
change in domain growth laws of the neurons in short and
long ranged interaction in the system. The correlation of
neurons decays much faster in short ranged interaction as
compared to long ranged, but it scales with r/L showing
the universality of neuron interaction in brain.

6
Given the current focus on the biological network and
their functionality, we hope that this paper will motivate
fresh interest in the evolution dynamics and morphology
of active and passive neurons. These kinetic processes
play an important role in determining the functionality
of brain. We emphasize that one can gain a good understanding of the relevant neuron dynamics (wiring and
rewiring inside the brain network) from simple coarsegrained models of the type discussed here. Convincing
to the fact that re-learning help us to memorize things
for longer duration. Thus it is an attempt to predict and
an outlook to understand the functionaliies of the brain.
