Abstract ‚Äì We consider the problem of extinction processes on random networks with a given
structure. For sufficiently large well-mixed populations, the process of extinction of one or
more state variable components occurs in the tail of the quasi-stationary probability distribution, thereby making it a rare event. Here we show how to extend the theory of large deviations
to random networks to predict extinction times. In particular, we use the theory to find the most
probable path leading to extinction. We apply the methodology to epidemic models and discover
how mean extinction times scale with epidemiological and network parameters in ErdoÃãs-ReÃÅnyi networks. The results are shown to compare quite well with Monte Carlo simulations of the network
in predicting both the most probable paths to extinction and mean extinction times.

In many models of finite populations, random fluctuations occur due to internal interactions between individuals or agents, and/or external stochastic forces. Such
fluctuations are evident in the modeling of well mixed populations that support epidemics of disease spread [1], as
well as ecological bio-diversity of species [2,3], among others. Typically, the dynamics performs small random fluctuations about an attracting state. However, in almost
all populations of finite size, fluctuations may organize in
such a way to drive one or more components of the population to extinction. Mechanisms conjectured to play a role
in extinction processes include small population size, low
contact frequency for frequency-dependent transmission,
competition for resources, and evolutionary pressure [4],
as well as heterogeneity in populations and transmission
in coupled population models [5, 6].
In epidemic models where the population is well-mixed,
extinction of infectious individuals has been shown to be
affected by noise intensity [7], peak infectious population
size [8], and seasonal phase occurrence [9]. Moreover, since
the extinct state is typically unstable in the deterministic mean field and is an absorbing state of a stochastic
process, time scales for extinction may be exponentially
long [10]; i.e., the probability of extinction is a decreasing exponential function [11]. Vaccination and treatment
programs have been studied to speed up the extinction
of disease in well-mixed populations [10, 12]. For example, although most vaccination schedules are designed to

be administered periodically (deterministic) [13‚Äì15], Poisson distributed scheduling was recently shown to be more
efficient than regular treatment schedules [16].
In network populations, outbreak extinction probabilities have been predicted for early times when an infection
has just been introduced [17, 18]. Other studies of extinction on networks attempt to predict whether a persistent
non-extinct state exists, such as for computer viruses in
growing networks [19] and epidemics in various network
geometries (e.g., [20]). This is equivalent to finding the bifurcation point where the extinct state becomes unstable
and thus can frequently be predicted using deterministic
approximations (e.g., [19]).
Extinction times for an endemic disease in a network
have occasionally been studied, mostly numerically. In
[21], extinction times were measured in simulations of an
epidemic on an adaptive network, and the log of the extinction time was observed to increase with a power of the
distance from a bifurcation point. In [22], lifetimes were
measured in a similar model with the addition of pulsed
vaccination. Similar lifetimes were obtained in simulations
by adding stochastic pulsed vaccination to a deterministic
mean-field model based on a pair approximation, suggesting that it is not necessary to model the full stochastic
network dynamics in detail to capture the extinction time.
Here we will present a method for finding the most probable path to extinction and the extinction time in networks
that can be described using a pair approximation.

Rare Event Extinction on Stochastic Networks

Here  = 0 returns the standard equations for the SIS
model in a globally-coupled (well mixed) population, and
 = 1 is a locally-coupled network SIS model. Even the
pair-based proxy system is sufficiently high dimensional
that finding the most probable path to extinction will be
difficult a priori, but continuously varying  will allow us
to track the path from the known case of global coupling
to the network case. This approach to tracking the path
to extinction by continuously varying a parameter is new.
However, we note that far from the extinction bifurcation
point, if the well mixed population is constrained in fluctuation so that S +I = N , the limit of I() as  approaches
zero may not exist since the SIS model has been shown
to be fragile [27].
The rare events we are interested in are those of extinction where the number of infected nodes goes to zero.
As in the globally coupled case ( = 0), the Monte Carlo
dynamics of the network ( = 1) exhibits random fluctuations about an attracting state, and then the fluctuations
organize in such a way as to drive the infected nodes to
extinction. We wish to characterize the probability of an
extinction event in the large population limit and compare it to the globally coupled case. In particular, we are
interested in the most probable path and mean times to
extinction. To understand the scaling of extinction times
in terms of epidemiological parameters and network topology, we employ large deviation theory techniques for finite
populations [25, 28].
We introduce the scaled variables x with components
defined by x1 = I/N , x2 = NSI /N , and x3 = NII /N ,
where the remaining variables S and NSS can be eliminated by conservation of nodes and links. We define the
scaled transition rates w(x, ŒΩ k ) = W (X, ŒΩ k )/N on these
variables. Henceforth, we will refer to the fraction of infecteds and susceptibles as PI = I/N and PS = S/N . The
link variables will be given as LAB = NAB /N . Given that
the probability current at the extinct state is sufficiently
small for large enough N , and that the increments are sufficiently small with respect to N , there will exist a quasistationary probability distribution about a state with a
non-zero number of infected individuals that decays into
the stationary (extinct) solution over exponentially long
times [16]. The extinction rate of infected individuals can
be calculated from the tail of the quasi-stationary distribution. It has been demonstrated that a WKB approximation to the quasi-stationary distribution allows one to
approximate the mean extinction time provided the population is sufficiently large when  = 0 [28].
Employing the WKB approximation for the probability,
œÅ(x, t) = A(x)exp(‚àíN R(x, t)), from the first order expansion with respect to N ‚àí1 , we can write the HamiltonJacobi equation,

Here the function H is called the Hamiltonian of the system, and R is known as the action. The variable p = ‚àÇx R

is the conjugate momenta of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and the Hamiltonian can be written as
H(x, p) =

k=1

We analyze the system by solving the characteristic equations xÃá = ‚àÇp H(x, p), pÃá = ‚àí‚àÇx H(x, p).
Since we are interested in the probability of extinction
events, we must compute the action R that maximizes this
probability. This will, naturally, be the one that satisfies
the Hamilton-Jacobi Eq. 4. This implies that there will be
some trajectory along which R is minimized, which represents the maximal probability of such an extinction event,
and that this trajectory, which we will call the ‚Äúmost probable path,‚Äù satisfies the characteristic equations for the
Hamiltonian plus boundary conditions [25, 28].
The boundary conditions for the characteristic equations are given as steady state solutions of xÃá = pÃá = 0. In
fact, for epidemic models, the quasi-stationary probability
distribution peaks at an endemic state, where the number of new infections equals the number of recoveries per
unit time, and corresponds to the zero conjugate momenta
case, i.e., the steady state is at (x, p) = (xe , 0). The other
steady state is the extinct state, PS = 1, PI = 0, which
is saddle point. However, here we find that the conjugate
momenta at this state, p0 , is non-zero, since there is a
non-zero probability current at that point. We label the
endemic state as (xe , 0), and the non-trivial extinct state
as (x0 , p0 ). The steady states of the characteristic equation corresponding to zero conjugate momenta are those
which satisfy the deterministic epidemic model.
For the case  = 0, analytic solutions are available for
the most probable path to extinction [29], and hence the
action may be computed directly. However, for  = 1,
the additional equations for the mean link fractions complicate the analysis, and the most probable path must be
computed numerically. We therefore employ the iterative
action minimizing method (IAMM) [30] to compute the
most probable path between xe and
R xx0 , and the action
will be given by the path integral xe0 p ¬∑ dx along this
path since H(x, p) = 0 along the path.
Using the IAMM, we perturb off the  = 0 solution,
where the path can be analytically defined. For an all-toK 2
all connected graph, LSI = K
N 2PS PI and LII = N PI and
momenta conjugate to the link variables are 0. We then
use continuation as a function of  to get to the locallycoupled  = 1 case. We demonstrate the robustness of
this approach in Fig. 1, where the computed most probable path is plotted for several values of . It is clear from
Fig. 1a that the path predicted for the discretely coupled
network ( = 1) is quite different from the globally coupled disease dynamics ( = 0). Note that as  increases and
infection spreads primarily along the network, II connections become more prominent because infected nodes arise
next to other infected nodes. Also, as shown in Fig. 1b,
the action decreases, corresponding to a decrease in the

To validate the predicted paths and extinction times, we
compare the numerical results for our approximate system
to Monte Carlo simulations of an SIS epidemic model on
an ErdoÃãs-ReÃÅnyi random network. Here, the Monte Carlo
simulations are completed using the Gillespie algorithm
[31] with an initial condition at the endemic steady state.
For the networks, 1000 trajectories are run to extinction,
100 for each of 10 randomly generated network geometries. From the set of paths that go extinct, a density
function is created from the prehistory of these paths, and
a clear local maximum can be identified. This maximum
corresponds to the most likely trajectory connecting the
endemic and extinct points, and is shown in the density
plots of Fig. 2. Using the IAMM to compute the most
probable path and comparing it to the prehistory of extinction events on stochastic networks, as shown by the
dashed curve in Fig. 2, demonstrates that our proxy model
approximates well the path to extinction.

until extinction. We assume that the mean lifetime œÑ
is inversely proportional to the probability of the event,
and thus can be related to our action by the formula
œÑ = B(x)eN R . Note the appearance of the prefactor B(x)
in this calculation. The prefactor may depend on all parameters for a given problem, but in general scales as ‚àö1N
for sufficiently large N . For our purposes, the prefactor
can be found analytically for  = 0,

where the effective reproductive number is given as R0eff =

In Fig. 3, we plot the log of the mean lifetimes of the
disease compared to our numerical predictions of the action, incorporating the prefactor in Eq. 6. Because it is
analytically intractible to find the prefactor for  > 0, we
assume that, since the action does not vary greatly with
respect to , the change to the prefactor will be negligible,
and thus we can use the same prefactor for the case when
 = 1.
Figure 3a shows the log of the mean lifetime versus population for Monte Carlo simulations of the disease on discrete networks ( = 1) and the mean-field prediction generated by the IAMM, and scaled by the analytical prefactor, i.e., ln œÑ /N ‚âà R + ln B/N . Because the action R is
invariant with respect to N , the scaling depends entirely
on the prefactor, and the good agreement between our analytical approximation and stochastic simulations shows
that our approximation of the prefactor is sufficient to
capture the dynamics. Figure 3b varies a different parameter, the infection rate p, and shows the lifetime scaling
predicted by our model and the stochastic simulations as
the probability of disease propagation along the network
is increased.

aided by perturbing from the known path in a well-mixed
system. In the future, the pair-based proxy method will
be extended to systems such as epidemics on adaptive networks (e.g., [33]) by adding network adaptation to the list
of transitions (Eqs. 2 and 3). Vaccination transitions can
also be added, as in [22]. More generally, this pair-based
proxy method will be applicable to predict extinction in
any network system that is well described by a pair-based
approximation for dynamics of nodes and links, including games on networks (e.g., [34, 35]). Further, we expect that our method of continuously varying a parameter while tracking the path to extinction will be useful in
other contexts where finding the path a priori is difficult
due to high dimensionality, as in finite mode projection of
partial differential equations [36], and pattern switching
along paths in continuous systems [37].
