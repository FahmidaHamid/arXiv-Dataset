Abstract
Biodiversity conservation becoming increasingly urgent. It is important to find mechanisms of
competitive coexistence of species with different fitness in especially difficult circumstances on one limiting resource, in isolated stable uniform habitat, without any trade-offs and
cooperative interactions. Here we show a mechanism of competitive coexistence based on a
soliton-like behaviour of population waves. We have modelled it by the logical axiomatic
deterministic individual-based cellular automata method. Our mechanistic models of
population and ecosystem dynamics are of white-box type and so they provide direct insight
into mechanisms under study. The mechanism provides indefinite coexistence of two, three
and four competing species. This mechanism violates the known formulations of the
competitive exclusion principle. As a consequence, we have proposed a fully mechanistic and
most stringent formulation of the principle.

competition; population waves.

Introduction
Background. Up to now, it is not clear why are there so many superficially similar species
existing together1,2. The competitive exclusion principle (also known as Gause’s principle,
Gause’s Rule, Gause’s Law, Gause’s Hypothesis, Volterra-Gause Principle, Grinnell’s Axiom,
and Volterra-Lotka Law)3 postulates that species competing for the same limiting resource in one
homogeneous habitat cannot coexist4,5. This principle contradicts with the observed biodiversity.
This contradiction is known as the biodiversity paradox6. Because of the long standing
biodiversity debates1,2,4,5, this paradox is the central problem of theoretical ecology. At least 120
different explanations of the biodiversity paradox were presented3, however the biodiversity
debates still continue1,2. Different competitive trade-offs7-11 do not violate the competitive
exclusion principle. The point is that the classic study of the principle in the work of Gause
1

necessarily suggested that “one of species has any advantage over the other”4, i.e. one and the
same species always keeps a definite uncompensated benefit.
Fundamentally important point is that empirical studies cannot prove and hardly falsify the
competitive exclusion principle – it can be verified only theoretically5. However, the theoretical
studies of the subject left too many unresolved questions, what is one of the reasons of
continuing biodiversity debates. Let us to consider the initial source of the problems with
theoretical understanding of natural biodiversity. The Lotka-Volterra model predicts coexistence
of two species when, for both species, an interspecific competition is weaker than intraspecific
one. This interpretation follows directly from the Lotka-Volterra model. However, the further
interpretation of this interpretation, known as the competitive exclusion principle has no rigorous
justification under itself. The problem is that the Lotka-Volterra model is phenomenological12.
Therefore this model cannot show underlined mechanisms of ecosystem under study in details.
The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity was proposed as an alternative to the niche theory.
But Hubbell’s neutral model is also discussed as “just a statement of ignorance about which
species can succeed and why”2. The general problem is the absence of a mechanistic
understanding of how and why many superficially similar species existing together.
In this paper we investigate a mechanism of competitive coexistence of species with different
fitness in especially difficult circumstances - on one limiting resource, without any trade-offs and
cooperative interactions, in isolated stable uniform habitat, and so on. We model a mechanistic
mechanism of competitive coexistence outside the limitations imposed by the known
formulations of the competitive exclusion principle.
Main hypothesis. We suppose that presence of free resource gaps may be a basis for
competitive coexistence and for violation of the known formulations of the competitive
exclusion principle. Free resource gaps may help to eliminate direct conflicts of interest between
competing species. As result, colliding population waves of different competing species may
interpenetrate through each other like soliton waves in physical systems. A possible mechanism
of appearance of such gaps is a moderate reproduction.
On a soliton-like behaviour of population waves. Population waves are self-sustaining waves
which use resources of a medium where they propagate. Population waves are autowaves13.
Autowaves play a universal role in mechanisms of various chemical and biological processes1416
. The importance of autowaves is based on the universality of their properties that are
independent of a specific implementation. One such universal property is that identical
autowaves annihilate each other after collision. Previously, the paradoxical phenomenon of
soliton-like (quasi-soliton) behaviour of population waves was revealed for ultra-fast
chemotactic bacteria - their colliding population waves did not annihilate each other and looked
as penetrating through or reflecting from each other without significant delay13,17,18. The
phenomenon of soliton-like behaviour of chemotactic bacterial waves is based on ultrafast
bacterial movement and, as the result, bacteria have no time to use all local resource13,17. Thus, a
certain amount of unused resource is left behind the population wave front. Consequently, a
reflection of the chemotactic waves and, possibly, their interpenetration through each other may
occur after their collision. The question remains - what is implemented exactly - reflection,
interpenetration, or both. Individual bacteria of colliding population waves were not
2

marked13,17,18. So, a mechanistic mechanism of soliton-like interpenetration of colliding
population waves was not directly demonstrated. Modelling by differential equations19 has not
helped to realize what really happens because it does not show what happens with population
waves on a micro-level of individuals and their local interactions. Moreover the results on
chemotactic soliton-like behaviour were obtained on one and the same species while we look for
a mechanism of interspecific competitive coexistence.
A similar task of distinguishing between interpenetration and reflection arose in the studies of
colliding population waves of the bacteria Myxococcus Xanthus20-22. Under starvation conditions
these bacteria start to act cooperatively, aggregate and finally build a multicellular structure, the
fruiting body. The fruiting body formation is often preceded by the pattern of periodically
colliding waves called rippling patterns. In the difference from chemotactic bacteria,
myxobacterial aggregation is the consequence of direct cell-to-cell contact interactions, but not
of chemoreception of a food concentration gradient. When viewed from a distance where only
cell density can be perceived, the rippling waves appear to pass through one another, analogous
to soliton waves in various physical systems22,23. Nevertheless, the detailed studies of the
population waves’ behaviour of myxobacteria showed that they actually reflect off one another
when they collide. Each wave crest oscillates back and forth with no net displacement. Without
observing individual cells, the illusion that the waves pass through one another is nearly perfect.
In the experimental study of colliding population waves some individual cells were marked by
green fluorescent protein23,24 and in computational modelling the agent-based approach was
implemented23,25. These results ruled out the assumption about the soliton-like behaviour of
rippling population waves of myxobacteria.
On a methodology. Phenomenological models are difficult to interpret mechanistically and thus
they are of limited usefulness12. They may superficially show what happens with modelled
object but cannot show how it happens in physical sense. They describe some empirical
observations, but have no foundations in mechanisms or first principles. Phenomenological
models are rather of ‘black-box’ type what means that they are not transparent for understanding
of underlying mechanisms.
In contrast to the phenomenological black-box models, cellular automata models can be of a
‘white box’ type. A white box model has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlined
mechanistic mechanisms – all events at micro-, mini- (meso-) and macro- levels of the simulated
dynamic system are directly visible at all stages. We consider mechanistic mechanisms as
consisting of two inter-related constituents – (1) cause-effect relations and (2) part-whole
relations. The causes of the mechanisms should be sufficient to understand their effects and the
parts should be sufficient to understand the whole. In our research, the ‘whole’ is a specific
ecosystem with populations of competing species. The ‘parts’ are individuals, microhabitats and
interactions between the individuals and their immediate environment (neighbourhood).
Mechanicalness of models may be achieved by using individual-based cellular automata
approach. A logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata modelling may help us to
find a mechanism of coexistence by the simplest way. The methodology of our approach has
been described in detail previously26. Currently, the white-box modelling is mostly used in
engineering sciences27-29.

Results
The main goal of this paper is a mechanistic verification of the competitive exclusion principle.
To achieve that we have elaborated a cellular automata model of interspecific competition.
Cellular automata provide mechanistic simulations of spatial and temporal relationships between
individuals of competing species. This modelling method is based on physically interpreted
ecological axioms i.e. on first principles (Fig. S2). The cellular automata model works as the
automaton of visualised inference of a mechanistic insight into studied phenomena (Movies S1S4).
A mechanism of competitive coexistence. On the basis of our main hypothesis we have
proposed a special cellular automata neighbourhood with gaps (Fig. 5a). This spatial hexagonal
rosette-like pattern of the offsprings placement permit to model population waves with free
resource gaps. In accordance with the neighbourhood, offsprings of every individual can occupy
no more than one third of resources of nearest environment of their parental plant. Rosettes of
rhizomes of asexually propagating turf grasses Poa pratensis L. and Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra
are biological prototypes of the specific form of this neighbourhood.
We have found that moderate reproduction of competing species may be a base for soliton-like
behaviour of colliding population waves (Fig. 1; Movie S1). Individuals of the colliding
population waves of competing species freely interpenetrate through arising gaps. Therefore,
interpenetration of colliding population waves occurs as tunnelling (interdigitation) of offsprings
through the gaps in population waves (Fig. 1a; Movie S1). As a result, both competing species
coexist indefinitely with the same equal numbers of individuals (Fig. 1b).

Additionally we show indefinite competitive coexistence of three and four species in one closed
homogeneous habitat (Movies S3 and S4). All these species are complete competitors. They
compete for one limiting resource in isolated stable uniform habitat without any trade-offs and
cooperative interactions. A mechanism of their coexistence is based on moderate reproduction of
individuals of all competing species. Unusually large numbers of cases when the less fit species
survive have been found in the models of competition between two, three and four species (Fig.
S5). In addition, we have shown that the species can coexist with each other in all possible
combinations (Figs S6 and S7). Along with the cases of competitive coexistence (Movies S1, S3
and S4) we have shown also a case of competitive exclusion when competitors cannot avoid
direct conflicts of interest (Movie S2).
Investigation of population dynamics. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate
population dynamics of two, three and four competing species (Figs 2, S3-S8). The Monte Carlo

the lattice were used in each of 200 repeated experiments (Monte Carlo simulation).

simulation consists of multiple repeated experiments in which the initial conditions of the models
are randomly changed. These multiple repeated experiments consist of random placements of
single initial individuals of each species on the lattice. We show that competitive coexistence
depends on initial positioning of individuals on the lattice (Fig. 2). Along with initial positioning
of individuals on the lattice, the outcome of competition also depends on the lattice size.
Coexistence occurs if the lattice consists of NxN lattice sites, where N is an even number (Figs 2,
S3 and S4). If N is an odd number then with this type of the neighbourhood (Fig. 5a) the
coexistence mechanism cannot be implemented and species cannot coexist (Figs S3 and S4).
Discussion
The mechanism of competitive coexistence investigated here is a special case of spatio-temporal
resource partitioning in isolated stable uniform habitat. It based on a soliton-like interpenetration
of colliding population waves of competing species and implements the optimal allocation of a
limiting resource among competitors enabling them to avoid direct conflicts and to maintain
equal numbers of individuals in populations. This mechanism of indefinite competitive
coexistence is based on a specific combination of the four basic conditions:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Moderate reproduction of individuals of competing species (number of offsprings is
determined by the hexagonal rosette-like cellular automata neighbourhood);
Geometrically defined spatial placement of offsprings (it is determined by the
hexagonal rosette-like cellular automata neighbourhood);
The definite structure and the definite size of an ecosystem (they are determined by
the cellular automata lattice);
The definite initial spatial placement of single individuals of competing species
(determined by their coordinates).

A rigorous theoretical verification of a validity of the known formulations of the principle may
allow to solve the theoretical problem of contradictions between the principle and the observed
biodiversity. In this paper we look for a new mechanism of competitive coexistence which
contradicts the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle. Such mechanism has
been found. It provides indefinite coexistence of competing species, which are identical
consumers and compete for one limiting resource in one isolated stable and uniform habitat.
Here are the main conditions of our models:
1. There are no any trade-offs and cooperative interactions between the competing species;
2. Reproduction of the competing species occurs only vegetatively and the species are
genetically homogenous and stable;
3. Individuals of one and the same species always win individuals of other competing
species in direct conflict of interest;
4. A habitat is limited, homogeneous, stable, closed for immigration, emigration, predation,
herbivory, parasitism and other disturbances;
5. Competing species are per capita identical and constant in ontogeny, in fecundity rates, in
regeneration features of a microhabitat and in environmental requirements.
6

Our models completely satisfy to all these conditions (Figs 3-5, S1 and S2; Movies S1-S4). The
known hypotheses of natural richness are based on non-compliance with one or more of these
conditions3,30,31. Let us cite three of the most known formulations of the competitive exclusion
principle:
“n species require at least n resources”32;
“no stable equilibrium can be attained in an ecological community in which some r of the
components are limited by less than r limiting factors”33;
“Two populations (species) cannot long coexist if they compete for a vital resource limitation of
which is the direct and only factor limiting both populations. As thus restated, the principle is, I
think, valid without exception”34.
Palmer carefully analyzed twelve formulations of the competitive exclusion principle and offered
his own reformulated principle3:
“Given a suite of species, interspecific competition will result in the exclusion of all but one
species.
Conditions of the Principle:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)

Time has been sufficient to allow exclusion;
The environment is temporally constant;
The environment has no spatial variation;
Growth is limited by one resource;
Rarer species are not disproportionately favored in terms of survivorship,
reproduction, or growth;
(6) Species have the opportunity to compete;
(7) There is no immigration.
Corollary: The greater the degree to which these conditions are broken, the greater the number
of species which can coexist.”
Our models violate the wordings of Darlington34 and Palmer3 by showing the mechanism of
competitive coexistence on one limiting resource. Furthermore, we have revealed a rather
unexpected result that increasing the number of similar competing species led to the increased
number of coexistence cases what contradicts to the cited formulations (Figs 2, S6-S8). Since our
results violate the listed and other known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle,
this principle should be additionally reformulated. We reformulate the competitive exclusion
principle as follows:
If each and every individual of less fit species in any attempt to use any limiting
resource always has direct conflict of interest with an individual of most fittest
species and always loses, then, all other things being equal for all individuals of the
competing species, these species cannot coexist indefinitely and the less fit species will
be excluded from the habitat in the long run.
7

Our formulation of the principle is fully mechanistic. Implementation of this extremely strict
formulation of the competitive exclusion principle is rather a very rare case in nature. This fact
eliminates old contradictions between the competitive exclusion principle and natural
biodiversity.
Methods
A system of logical rules of transitions between the states of a lattice site of the cellular automata
is formulated as a part of axioms on the basis of which we model population and ecosystem
dynamics. The entire cellular automaton simulates a whole ecosystem which autonomously
maintains and regenerates itself. A two-dimensional hexagonal lattice is closed to a torus by
periodic boundary conditions in order to avoid boundary effects. We use the hexagonal lattice
because it most naturally implements the principle of densest packing of microhabitats. Each site
of the lattice simulates a microhabitat. In the free state a microhabitat contains resources for
existence of a one individual of any species. An individual can occupy a one microhabitat only.
A life cycle of an individual lasts a one iteration of the automaton. All states of all sites have the
same duration. Every individual of all species consumes identical quantity of identical resources
by identical way i.e. they are identical per capita consumers. Such species are complete
competitors. Individuals are immobile in lattice sites and populations waves spread due to
reproduction of individuals (Movies S1-S4). The closest biological analogue is vegetative
reproduction of plants (Figs 3 and S1).
In order to model interspecific competition, we mechanistically define dominance as a primary
ability of an individual of a species with greater fitness to occupy a free microhabitat in a direct
conflict of interest with an individual of a less adapted species (Fig. 3). Rules of competitive
interactions between species are represented in a general form by diagrams (Fig. 4).
These cellular automata models are individual-based and their rules consist of deterministic
logical ‘if-then’ statements only (Figs 5 and S2). Thus, the models are fully mechanistic. The
models take into account a regeneration state of a microhabitat after an individual's death. Earlier
regenerative processes in ecosystems were considered in the regeneration niche concept 35,36. For
example, obstacles in the form of dead roots, dead tillers as and soil toxins must be eliminated
and necessary mineral components must be recovered after propagating of population wave.
Thus a set of conditions must be restored for a possibility of subsequent successful occupation of
a microhabitat by an individual.
Inclusion of the regeneration state of a microhabitat allow us to implement the accordance of our
models with the axiomatic formalism of Wiener and Rosenblueth for simulation of excitation
propagation in active media37. Three successive states - rest, excitation and refractoriness of each
site are the main features of that formalism. In our formalism the ‘rest’ state corresponds to the
‘free’ state of a microhabitat, the ‘excitation’ corresponds to the life activity of an individual in a
microhabitat and the ‘refractoriness’ corresponds to the regeneration state of a microhabitat (Figs
5b-d and S2).

are the states of a microhabitat occupied by an individual of the first, second, third and fourth
species, respectively. In Supplementary movies these states are marked by the same colours,
but represented as symbols ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’ according to the number of the species; 2, 4, 6, 8 –
are the regeneration states of a site after living of an individual of the first, second, third and
fourth species respectively. In Supplementary movies these regeneration states are
represented by symbols ‘.’, ‘*’, ‘@’, ‘#’, respectively, to distinguish them from living individuals.

A populated microhabitat goes into the regeneration state after an individual’s death. A
populated microhabitat and a microhabitat in the regeneration state cannot be occupied. A
microhabitat can be occupied if it is in the free state or immediately after finishing of the
regeneration state when it becomes free. Thus, we simulate a birth-death-regeneration process. In
addition, the regeneration state of a microhabitat allows us to avoid a predator-prey analogy
when an individual directly replaces another one. Logical rules of the two-species competition
model are considered in Figure S2 in more details.

Population dynamics in the models with two, three and four competitors was investigated by
Monte Carlo simulations with 200 repeated experiments of random initial placements of single
individuals of competing species on the lattice consisting of 26x26 sites (Fig. 2).
Along with investigation of random initial positioning of individuals on the lattice consisted of
26x26 sites, we investigated population dynamics in the two-species competition model by the
same Monte Carlo method with the following lattice sizes (NxN lattice sites): 27x27, 28x28,
29x29, 30x30 (Fig. S3) and, 100x100, 101x101, 102x102, 103x103 (Fig. S4).
Additionally, to analyse population dynamics we performed 100 repeated series of Monte Carlo
simulations with 200 repeated experiments in every Monte Carlo simulation (Fig. S5-S8).
Random initial placements of single individuals of competing species on the lattice were used in
each of 200 repeated experiments (Monte Carlo simulation). The lattice consists of 26x26 sites.

Figure S1 | Moderate vegetative reproduction of plants. A pattern of propagation and
number of offsprings are determined by the hexagonal rosette-like neighbourhood.

Figure S2 | Rules of the two-species competition model. A graph of transitions between the
states of a site (microhabitat) in the two-species competition model is represented here in two
forms (a and b). a, Pictorial form. b, Numerical form of program implementation.
Each microhabitat may be in one of the five states:
0 – a free microhabitat that can be occupied by an offspring of any species;
1 – a microhabitat which is occupied by a living individual of the first species;
2 – a regeneration state of a microhabitat after death of an individual of the first species;
3 – a microhabitat which is occupied by a living individual of the second species;
4 – a regeneration state of a microhabitat after death of an individual of the second species.

Logical rules of transitions between the states of a microhabitat in the two-species competition
model:
0, a microhabitat remains free if in its neighbourhood is no one living individual;
1, a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the first species if in its neighbourhood
is at least one individual of the first species;
3, a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the second species if in its
neighbourhood is at least one individual of the second species and there is no one individual of
the first species;
2, after death of an individual of the first species its microhabitat goes into the regeneration
state;
0, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will become free if in its neighbourhood is no
one living individual;
1, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the first
species if in its neighbourhood is at least one individual of the first species;
3, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the second
species if in its neighbourhood is at least one individual of the second species and there is no
one individual of the first species;
4, after death of an individual of the second species its microhabitat goes into the
regeneration state;
0, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will become free if in its neighbourhood is no
one living individual;
1, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the first
species if in its neighbourhood is at least one individual of the first species;
3, after the regeneration state a microhabitat will be occupied by an individual of the second
species if in its neighbourhood is at least one individual of the second species and there is no
one individual of the first species.
