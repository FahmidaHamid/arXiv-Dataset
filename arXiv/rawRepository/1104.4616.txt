Abstract
Prion diseases (e.g. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant CJD (vCJD), GerstmannSträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) and Kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or ‘mad-cow’ disease)
and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cattles) are invariably fatal and highly infectious
neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. However, by now there have
not been some effective therapeutic approaches or medications to treat all these prion
diseases. Rabbits, dogs, and horses are the only mammalian species reported to be resistant to infection from prion diseases isolated from other species. Recently, the β2-α2
loop has been reported to contribute to their protein structural stabilities. The author
has found that rabbit prion protein has a strong salt bridge ASP177-ARG163 (like a
taut bow string) keeping this loop linked. This paper confirms that this salt bridge
also contributes to the structural stability of horse prion protein. Thus, the region of
β2-α2 loop might be a potential drug target region. Besides this very important salt
bridge, other four important salt bridges GLU196-ARG156-HIS187, ARG156-ASP202
and GLU211-HIS177 are also found to greatly contribute to the structural stability of
horse prion protein. Rich databases of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
contacts for horse prion protein can be found in this paper.

Introduction
Prion diseases such as CJD, vCJD, GSS, FFI, Kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, BSE
or ‘mad-cow’ disease and CWD in cattle are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. However, by now there have not
been some effective therapeutic approaches or medications to treat all these diseases
(1-3). In 2008, canine mammals including dogs (canis familials) were the first time
1

academically reported to be resistant to prion diseases (4) (where, before 2008, dogs
and horses were reported to resist prion diseases in media). Rabbits are the mammalian
species known to be resistant to infection from prion diseases from other species (5).
Horses were academically reported to be resistant to prion diseases too (6). Thus, it
is very worth studying the molecular structures of dog, rabbit and horse prion proteins to obtain insights into the immunity of dogs, rabbits and horses to prion diseases.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide an excellent method to understand the
structural stability as well as ligand interactions of biological systems (7-38). It should
be noted that recently there have been a devoted effort by MD to understand the human
prion proteins (39-42). This author has already investigated (43-45) by MD simulations
the dog and rabbit prion proteins. This paper is focusing on the MD simulation studies
on the horse prion protein C-terminal structured region, as well as a comparison of
rabbit, dog and horse prion proteins.
Rabbits, dogs and horses are resistant to prion diseases. The infectious prion
(PrPSc ) is an abnormally folded form of the normal cellular prion (PrPC ) and the
conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is believed to involve conformational change from a predominantly α-helical protein (42% α-helix, 3% β-sheet) to a protein rich in β-sheets
(30% α-helix, 43% β-sheet). For a protein structure, its stability is maintained by its
hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts. Thus,
when we study their NMR structure and structural dynamics, we have to consider these
factors. The secondary structure of rabbit prion protein turned into β-sheet structures
from α-helical structures under low pH environment. The change of pH environments
causes the change of secondary structure from a-helices into -sheets, because the salt
bridges disappear under low pH environment. Thus, we might say that the salt bridge
provides the stability and it might be be a drug target.
All the MD simulations in this paper confirmed the structural stability of wild-type
horse prion protein under both neutral and low pH environments. The analyses of salt
bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts for horse prion protein will be done
in order to seek reasons of the stability (where the salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic contacts will be presented in this paper at the residue-residue level). The
rest of this paper is arranged as follows. We introduce the MD simulation materials
and methods (similar as (44-46)) in Section 2. Section 3 mainly gives MD simulation
results and their discussions. Concluding remarks are given in the last section.

Materials and Methods
The MD simulation materials and methods for horse prion protein are completely same
as the ones of (44-45). Simulation initial structure for the horse prion protein was built
on HoPrPC (119-231) (PDB entry 2KU4). The low pH in the simulations is achieved
by the change of residues HIS, ASP, GLU into HIP, ASH, GLH respectively and the
Cl- ions added by the XLEaP module of AMBER 11. The neutral pH in the simulations is achieved by the change of residues HIS into HID and the Na+ ions added by

2

the XLEaP module of AMBER 11. 16 Cl- and 6281 waters were added for the horse
prion protein under low pH environment, and 2 Na+ and 6679 waters were added under neutral pH environment. After equilibrations, 30 ns’ production MD simulations
were done using constant pressure and 350 K temperature ensemble for the horse prion
protein for both the seed1 and seed2 defined in (45). The two seeds are two different
initial velocities. Different initial conditions should produce the same thermodynamic
quantities after equilibration. This will firmly ensure that our research findings in this
paper are correct.
The studies on the rabbit prion protein at 300 K, 450 K, 500 K (43-46) and the
dog prion protein at 300 K, 450 K (45) have confirmed the research findings on the salt
bridge ASP178-ARG164 and the secondary structure change of rabbit prion protein
from neutral to low pH environments. 350 K is a practical experimental laboratory
temperature for prion proteins reported. Thus, 350 K is set for HoPrPC in this paper.

Results and Discussions
For both the seed1 and seed2, the MD simulations at room temperature 300 K whether
under neutral or low pH environment display very little fluctuation. At 350 K there is
fluctuation and variation for different pH values, but we cannot find their real difference
between (i) their backbone atom RMSDs (root mean square deviations) (Fig. 1), which
were calculated respectively from the minimized structure, (ii) their radii of gyrations
(Fig. 1), and (iii) their secondary structures (Fig.s 2-3).

Why does HoPrPC still have stable molecular structures even under low pH environment? Under low pH environment, horse prion protein has 45 and 38 strong hydrogen
bonds respectively for seed1 and seed2, if only considering the resident of hydrogen
bonds (HBs) for more than 5% of the whole 30 ns simulations. All these hydrogen
bonds are listed in Table 1 of the Supplementary Materials (where the number before
@ is the residue number counted from 1 to 113, i.e. corresponding to residues 119
3

to 231). By analysis, during the long simulations of 30 ns we can see that all these
hydrogen bonds well maintain the three α-helices and the two β-sheets, and especially
their interactions linked by the following hydrogen bonds (the first percentage is for
seed1 and the second percentage is for seed2):
• SER170-TYR218 (linking the β2-to-α2 loop with α2, 78.00%, 65.52%),
• ASP202-TYR157 (linking α3 with α2, 66.05%, 65.44%),
• TYR157-ARG136 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with α2, 68.27%, 71.04%),
• MET134-ASN159 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with the α1-to-β2 loop, 29.83%, 21.47%),
• GLY131-GLN160 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with the α1-to-β2 loop, 26.67%, 37.03%),
• HIS140-ARG208 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with α3, 43.85%, 10.80%),
• SER132-GLN217 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with α3, 29.70%, 12.90%),
• PRO137-TYR149 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with α1, 17.18%, 23.39%),
• PRO158-ARG136 (linking the β1-to-α1 loop with α2, 9.53%, 6.01%),
• ARG156-HIS187 (linking α1 and α2, 6.64%, 33.70%), and
• GLU221-TYR163 (linking α3 and β2, 11.40%, 6.22%).
Hydrophobic interactions also contribute greatly to the structural stability of horse
prion protein under low pH environment. In all there are 1760 and 2006 hydrophobic
bonds respectively for seed1 and seed2 during the whole 30 ns of simulations, and for
seed1 and seed2 respectively, there are 383 and 363 strong hydrophobic interactions are
100% resident in the core of the protein (Table 2 of the Supplementary Materials). The
three hydrophobic bonds CYS214-CYS179, CYS214-VAL176, TYR162-LEU130 should
be well noticed, where there is a disulfide bond between CYS179 and CYS214 linking
α-helices 2 and 3, VAL176 is in α-helix 2, and TYR162-LEU130 (but 99.06% for seed2)
are just respectively in the strands 1 and 2 of the antiparallel β-sheet (we noticed that
there is not a hydrogen bond between TYR162 and LEU130).
Under the neutral pH environment, there are 33 salt bridges respectively for seed1
and seed2, which contribute to the structural stability of horse prion protein (Table 3
of the Supplementary Materials). These salt bridges well keep the structural stability
of the three helices and their interactions. During the whole 30 ns, among these salt
bridges the following ones are important in the contributions of the three α-helices and
two β-sheets’ structural stability of horse prion protein: GLU211-HIS177 (occupied
rate 27.48% for seed1 and 17.77% for seed2), GLU196-ARG156 (occupied rate 17.17%
for seed1 and 43.47% for seed2), ARG156-HIS187 (occupied rate 9.14% for seed1 and
75.60% for seed2), ARG156-ASP202 (occupied rate 0.25% for seed1 and 6.69% for
seed2), ASP178-ARG164 (occupied rate 10.45% for seed1 and 4.30% for seed2). The
positions of all these important salt bridges can be seen in Fig. 4. We can see that
the residue ARG156 of α-helix 1 forms a network of three salt bridges (and hydrogen
bonds) linking α-helices 2 and 3.
Recently, some researchers (6, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52) reported that the β2-α2 loop
plays an important role to stabilize the structural stability of rabbit and horse prion
proteins. This conclusion can be confirmed from the hydrogen bond, hydrophobic bond,
and salt bridge databases on horse prion protein presented by this paper. All their reports are not addressing the salt bridge problem of this loop. Like (44-46), this paper
also reports the important salt bridge ASP178-ARG164 (like a taut bow string) keeping
4

this loop linked. The important salt bridges reported in this paper, together with the
highly ordered β2-α2 loop and its interactions with α-helix 3, maintain the structural
stability of horse prion protein in a perfect way.
Lastly, we make some comparison of horse prion protein with dog and rabbit prion
proteins. There sequences alignment is shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, “*” means
that the residues in that column are identical in all sequences in the alignment, “:”
means that conserved substitutions have been observed, “.” means that semi-conserved
substitutions are observed, the RED color takes place at small (small+ hydrophobic (incl.aromatic-Y)) residues, the BLUE color takes place at acidic residues, the
MAGENTA color takes place at Basic-H residues,GREEN color takes place at Hydroxyl+sulfhydryl+amine+G residues, and Grey color takes place at unusual amino/imino
acids etc.. We may see in Fig. 5 that there are more identities and similarities between
horse and dog prion proteins, compared with the identities and similarities between
horse and rabbit prion proteins, between dog and rabbit prion proteins. This point can
be furthermore confirmed by the following data of the Needleman-Wunsch or SmithWaterman Pairwise Sequence Alignment and the jCE algorithm or jCE Circular Permutation Pairwise Structure Alignment. For horses and dogs, the Identities are 89.38%
(query) and 90.99% (subject) and the Similars are 93.81% (query) and 95.50% (subject)
for the Sequence Alignment, and the Identity is 89.11% and the Similarity is 93.07%
for the Structure Alignment. For horses and rabbits, the Identities are 87.61% (query)
and 71.74% (subject) and the Similars are 93.81% (query) and 76.81% (subject) for
the Sequence Alignment, and the Identity is 71.72% and the Similarity is 77.78% for
the Structure Alignment. For dogs and rabbits, the Identities are 72.46% (query) and
90.09% (subject) and the Similars are 76.81% (query) and 95.50% (subject) for the
Sequence Alignment, and the Identity is 92.93% and the Similarity is 98.99% for the
Structure Alignment. The 3-Dimensional structural Identity and Similarity of horse
and dog prion proteins (89.11%, 93.07%) are clearly very larger than those of horse
and rabbit prion proteins (71.72%, 77.81%). This explains the reasons why rabbit
prion protein differs very much from dog and horse prion proteins in secondary structures under low pH environment (45). The rabbit / horse and dog prion proteins have a
strong salt bridge ASP177-ARG163 / ASP178-ARG164 (like a taut bow string) keeping
the β2-α2 loop linked (44, 45). But the salt bridge ASP178-ARG164 does not exist for
human and mouse prion proteins (46). For horses and humans (1QLX.pdb), the Identities are 86.73% (query) and 46.67% (subject) and the Similars are 51.43% (subject) for
the Sequence Alignment. For horses and mouses (1AG2.pdb), the Identities are 80.53%
(query) and the Similars are 87.61% (query) for the Sequence Alignment. Thus, compared with the sequence alignments of horses-dogs (89.38%, 90.99%, 93.81%, 95.50%)
and horses-rabbits (87.61%, 71.74%, 93.81%, 76.81%), the percentages of Identities
and Similars of the sequence alignments of horses-humans (86.73%, 46.67%, 51.4%)
and horses-mouses (80.53%, 87.61%) are clearly very less. This is due to human and
mouse prion proteins are non-resistive prion proteins, but dog, horse and rabbit prion
proteins are prion disease resistive proteins. Rabbit prion protein differs from dog prion
protein in that, except two residues at positions 158 and 173 are different, all other
different residues are in helix 3 (46). However, compared with horse prion protein,
rabbit prion protein has different residues at positions 158, 159, 172, and 173. In the
5

C-terminal end of helix 3, at positions 219, 222 and 228 rabbit prion protein differs
from dog and horse prion proteins. We also find that horse prion protein has different
residues from dog and rabbit prion proteins at positions 167, 168, 173, 212, 216. The
residues at all these special positions should specially contribute to the structural stability of these resistive prion proteins.

Conclusion
Rabbits, dogs, and horses are the only mammalian species reported to be resistant
to infection from prion diseases isolated from other species. Recently, the β2-α2 loop
has been reported to contribute to their protein structural stabilities. The author has
found that rabbit prion protein has a strong salt bridge ASP177-ARG163 (like a taut
bow string) keeping this loop linked. This paper confirms that this salt bridge also
contributes to the structural stability of horse prion protein. Thus, the region of β2α2 loop should be a potential drug target region. Besides this very important salt
bridge, other four important salt bridges GLU196-ARG156-HIS187, ARG156-ASP202
and GLU211-HIS177 are also found to greatly contribute to the structural stability of
horse prion protein. Rich databases of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
contacts for horse prion protein can be found in the Supplementary Materials of this
paper.
