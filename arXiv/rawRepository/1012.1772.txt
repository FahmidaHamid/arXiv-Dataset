We present a stochastic approach for ion transport at the mesoscopic level. The description takes
into account the self-consistent electric field generated by the fixed and mobile charges as well as the
discrete nature of these latter. As an application we study the noise in the ion transport process,
including the effect of the displacement current generated by the fluctuating electric field. The
fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the electric current with and without the displacement
current.

INTRODUCTION

The study of electrolyte solutions finds its origin in the seminal works of Nernst [1, 2] and Planck [3, 4]. Ion
transport in electrolytes is described as arising from a diffusive part due to the concentration gradients and a drift
part due to the external electric field imposed to the system. A more accurate description is obtained if the electrical
field is not only generated by external means but also self-consistently incorporates the contributions of the local
deviations from electroneutrality [5, 6]. Under the assumption that the electric field propagates instantaneously the quasi-static limit of the Maxwell equations - this problem is known as the Nernst-Planck-Poisson (NPP) problem
[7, 8]. Here, the electric field self-consistently arises from the distribution of charges as described by the Poisson
equation. In this case, the transport process may present an additional contribution due to the temporal variations of
the electric field, known as the displacement current [9‚Äì11]. This approach has also played a basic role in the theory of
other systems: Indeed, the NPP equations, combined with statistical arguments, lead for instance to the description
of semiconductor p-n junctions [12, 13].
On the other hand, ionic solutions exist in many natural or artificial systems. Many biological processes crucially
depend on the transport of ions, e.g., between intra- and extracellular solutions [14, 15]. Besides, solid-state nanopores
are fabricated for the study of ionic current fluctuations [16]. In these systems, the transport of ion takes place in
different geometries, either with the complexity of channel proteins or more regular as straight channels in the case
of nanopores. Biological ion channels [17], as well as physico-chemical systems such as nanopores [18], nanofluidic
diodes [19], or nanostructures studied by impedance spectroscopy [20], are often described by the NPP theory. Yet,
they are of mesoscopic sizes and, at these scales, the motion of ions in solution is subjected to molecular fluctuations
and presents a stochastic behavior. These random fluctuations can be successfully described at the mesoscopic level
as Markovian stochastic processes [21‚Äì25]. Non-Markovian discrete-state models have also been considered to take
into account the memory effects resulting, in particular, from the lumping of diffusion [26]. The description to be
adopted depends on the geometry. In short heterogeneous channels, transport tends to proceed by jumps between
discrete states corresponding to wells in the free-energy potential. In long homogeneous channels such as cylindrical
nanopores, diffusion is not interrupted by barriers except at entrance and exit. In any case, the master equation ruling
these stochastic processes should reduce to the evolution equation for the charges densities at the macroscopic level.
In this respect, one of the fundamental problems is to incorporate the long-range Coulomb interaction between the
electric charges in the description.
In the present work, our purpose is to present a description of ion transport which is consistent with the laws of
both electricity and statistical thermodynamics. The key point is that the long-range Coulomb interaction deeply
influences the fluctuations of the particle and total currents. The proposed model describes the spatial distribution
of the discrete number of ions in a long channel. The ions undergo random jumps due to the thermal agitation in a
self-consistently generated electrical potential landscape. This description takes into account the stochastic aspects
of the time evolution as well as the self-consistent electric field generated by the charge distribution. In this regard,
it offers a computationally favorable alternative to more expensive techniques such as Brownian dynamics [27, 28].
This approach allows us to study various aspects of ion transport, revealing, e.g., the long-ranged spatial correlations
of the potential fluctuations inside the channel. We further study the fluctuations present in the transport process,
including the contributions of the displacement current. Also, we show that the fluctuation theorem [29‚Äì36] describing
the large-deviation properties of the current holds in this case as well.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the macroscopic description of ion transport in terms

2
of the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations. The stochastic description is presented in Sec. III. The fluctuations in the
ion transport process are studied in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, the symmetry of the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for
both the particle and electric currents. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI.
II.

MACROSCOPIC EQUATIONS

We consider a one-dimensional conduction channel extending from x = 0 to x = `. An important class of electrolytic
systems are those which contain a homogeneous distribution of immobile ions [37]. We therefore consider a model
with a single mobile species of charge e and density n being transported in a channel presenting a fixed ion density
n‚àí of opposite charge ‚àíe. The charge density inside the system is thus given by
œÅ = e(n ‚àí n‚àí ) .

(1)

The case of several fixed and mobile species can be treated in a similar way. Expressing the electric field E in terms
‚àáŒ¶, the problem is ruled by the coupled diffusion and Poisson equations:

D is the diffusion coefficient of the mobile species and ¬µ is the mobility coefficient which is given by Einstein‚Äôs relation
¬µ = D/kB T . The dielectric fluid is here homogeneous throughout the channel and has a dielectric constant of .

Equation (2a) is the conservation equation for the particle density, ‚àÇt n = ‚àí‚àá

coupled system (2) forms the Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations. They correspond to the quasi-static limit of the
complete Maxwell equations. On the other hand, the total current density reads [9, 11]

the last term being the displacement current density arising from temporal variations of the electrical field. The
displacement current vanishes in a stationary state but contributes, for example, when the system relaxes toward
the stationary state. Note that, by virtue of the Poisson equation (2b), the total current density is divergence free,
‚àá ¬∑ I = 0, at all times. We further notice that the experimentally measurable quantity is given by the total current
[11].
The channel is in contact with two reservoirs of particles maintained at fixed concentrations and electric potentials.
Equations (2) are thus supplemented by the boundary conditions
n(0) = nL ,

determining the concentrations on the left (L, x = 0) and right (R, x = `) boundaries as well as the external potential
difference V = Œ¶L ‚àí Œ¶R applied to the channel.
For time-independent boundary conditions, the system evolves toward a stationary state where ‚àÇt n = 0 so that
the particle current density J is constant in time and in space. For the one-dimensional channel here considered, the
stationary density satisfying the boundary conditions (4) is expressed as

This voltage difference is known as the Nernst potential [1, 2]. If this condition is not satisfied we are in a nonequilibrium situation characterized by the presence of a non-vanishing ionic current given by Eq. (6). In the stationary
state, the associated total current reads
I = eJ

(10)

since the displacement current vanishes in this case. However, at the mesoscopic level, fluctuations in the charge
distribution generate a fluctuating displacement current, as studied in Sec. IV.

III.

STOCHASTIC DESCRIPTION

The study of noise and molecular fluctuations at the mesoscopic scale is successfully accomplished in terms of
a Markovian random processes. Indeed, the master equation is known to describe the fluctuations down to the
mesoscopic scale [21‚Äì23].
We here introduce a stochastic model for the distribution of ions in the channel that incorporates the self-consistent
electric field generated by the fluctuating distribution of ions. The channel is divided into L cells of volume ‚àÜV , cross
section œÉ, and length ‚àÜx = `/L centered at the positions xi = (i ‚àí 1/2)/‚àÜx (i = 1, . . . , L). Each cell contains a
discrete number of mobile ions Ni and a constant number N‚àí = n‚àí ‚àÜV of fixed ions. The cells 0 and L + 1 correspond
to the external reservoirs maintained at fixed concentrations so that their particle numbers N0 and NL+1 remain
constant in time. The dimensionless electric potential œÜi = ‚àíeŒ¶i /kB T is defined on each cell as well. It obeys the
Poisson equation (7) which is discretized according to

with the boundary conditions œÜ0 = œÜL and œÜL+1 = œÜR . Equations (11) form a linear system that must be solved
at each time the particle distribution changes. Its exact solution is given in Appendix A. The extension of the
model to several (positive or negative) ion species and inhomogeneous distribution of fixed ions and permittivity is
straightforward.
The state of the system is determined by the number of ions Ni in each cell. The evolution equation for the
probability distribution P (N1 , ..., NL ) to observe a configuration {Ni } of particles is ruled by the master equation

where W¬±i (¬∑) denotes the transition rate between two configurations of the system. The transition ¬±i changes the
configuration from (..., Ni , Ni+1 , ...) to (..., Ni ‚àì 1, Ni+1 ¬± 1, ...). These transitions rates are supplemented with the
boundary conditions that N0 and NL+1 take fixed values.
The transition rates can be expressed as
W+i (..., Ni , Ni+1 , ...) = œà(‚àÜUi,i+1 )Ni
W‚àíi (..., Ni , Ni+1 , ...) = œà(‚àÜUi+1,i )Ni+1

where D is the diffusion coefficient and Œ≤ = (kB T )‚àí1 the inverse temperature. The prefactor D/‚àÜx2 allows us to
recover the appropriate evolution equation (2a) in the macroscopic limit, L ‚Üí ‚àû [39]. The transition rates are
proportional to the number of mobile ions in the cells and depend on the free electrostatic energy difference ‚àÜUi,i+1
as a result of the transition event:
e
‚àÜUi,i+1 = (Vi + Vi0 ) .
(16)
2
In Eq. (16), Vi and Vi0 are the voltage drops across the cells i and i+1 before and after a transition event, respectively.
This expression corresponds to the change in electrostatic energy resulting from the transition event, as shown in
Appendix A. Consequently, Eq. (16) can be expressed as
‚àÜUi,i+1 =

in terms of the electric potential calculated for the current configuration, Œ¶j = Œ¶j (N1 , ..., NL ), and the electric
potential Œ¶0j that would occur if the corresponding transition ¬±i were performed:
Œ¶0j = Œ¶0j (..., Ni ‚àì 1, Ni+1 ¬± 1, ...) .

The function œà satisfies the identity
œà(‚àÜU ) = œà(‚àí‚àÜU )e‚àíŒ≤‚àÜU

(20)

which guarantees that detailed balance is fulfilled at equilibrium [40‚Äì42]. On the other hand, the nonequilibrium
constraints or affinities driving the system out of equilibrium [43] can be identified in the stochastic description
thanks to a construction put forward by Schnakenberg [22], according to which the affinities are obtained from the
cyclic trajectories in the forward and backward directions. In our case, as verified in Appendix B, the macroscopic
affinity is readily identified by considering trajectories involving the transfer of an ion from one reservoir to the other,

Here, ‚àÜœÜ = œÜR ‚àí œÜL and we note that this affinity only involves macroscopic quantities as it should. At equilibrium
the affinity vanishes, Aeq = 0, and we recover the macroscopic equilibrium condition (9).
The stochastic process is simulated as follows. Random trajectories of the system are obtained using Gillespie‚Äôs
algorithm [44], which is known to reproduce the statistical properties of the master equation (12). At each random
jump, we have to recalculate the electric potential in the channel by solving the system (11). The simulations are
performed with the following parameters. Each cell contains a number N‚àí = 25 of fixed ions. By an appropriate
choice of the time unit, we can impose for example D/‚àÜx2 = 1. Using the dimensionless electric potential œÜ, the
only remaining dimensional parameter is the Debye length Œª. We form the dimensionless quantity `/Œª, i.e., the ratio
between the channel and Debye‚Äôs length, for which we choose the value `/Œª = 50. For a Debye length of 7 nm this
would correspond to a channel length of 350 nm.
The link with the macroscopic description is established in the limit where the volume of the cells ‚àÜV vanishes in
which case the concentrations are recovered as n(xi ) = hNi i /‚àÜV . In Fig. 1a, we depict the average number of ions
along the channel, estimated by the time average

distance Œª. The corresponding mean electric potential hœÜi i is shown in Fig. 1b. It is approximately linear throughout
the channel, which corresponds to a constant electric field, except again for a small layer near the boundaries.
Due to the electric interaction, the particle density fluctuations present spatial correlations along the channel. The

Fig. 2a shows the effect of the electric interaction on the spatial correlations. We observe negative correlations between
neighboring sites, showing that an excess charge at some location induces a repulsive effect on the neighboring sites.
The negative correlations rapidly diminish with the separation between sites over a distance comparable to the Debye
length. The presence of such correlations also shows that the particle distribution is not Poissonian even at equilibrium
in contrast with population dynamics of chemical reactions network [23]. The electric potential correlation function

FLUCTUATIONS IN ION TRANSPORT

In this section, we study the fluctuations in the transport process. For this purpose, we first introduce the fluctuating
particle current jk counting the number of ions transferred between the cells k and k + 1. We denote by Œµk (s) = ¬±1
the discrete charge transfer of an ion in the positive or negative direction between the cells k and k + 1 during the
sth random transition occurring at the time ts [Œµk (s) = 0 otherwise]. Accordingly, the fluctuating particle current is
given by
jk (t) =

+‚àû
X

Œµk (s)Œ¥(t ‚àí ts ) .

(25)

s=‚àí‚àû

We notice that the currents (25) are so-called point processes composed of singular events occurring at random times.
In the stationary state, the average particle current crossing the channel is time-independent and can be obtained
from the stationary probability distribution as
X
J ‚â° hjk (t)i =
Pst (N1 , ..., NL )[W+k (N1 , ..., NL ) ‚àí W‚àík (N1 , ..., NL )] .
(26)
N1 ,...,NL

By current conservation, the average particle current is independent of the position in the channel, J ‚â° hjk i for all k.
However, the experimentally measured electric current is composed of the particle and displacement currents according to Eq. (3). Indeed, even in a stationary state, fluctuations in the particle distribution at the mesoscopic level
generate a fluctuating electric field that, in turn, generates a fluctuating contribution to the electric current. We thus
calculate the change in the electric field associated with the random jumps of the charge carriers. The change in the
electric field between the cells k and k + 1, Ek+1/2 = ‚àí(Œ¶k+1 ‚àí Œ¶k )/‚àÜx, is expressed as

if the transition W¬±l is performed. The second equality is obtained by using Eq. (19) for the potential Œ¶0 (..., Nl ‚àì
1, Nl+1 ¬± 1, ...) after the transition. The associated displacement current is given by œÉ times the change in the
electric field, where œÉ is the cross section of the channel (œÉ‚àÜx = ‚àÜV ). The displacement current associated with the
transition W¬±l and measured between the cells k and k + 1 thus reads

(28)

‚àìe L+1 if k = l
where we used expression (A7) and the equality œÉ = Œ±‚àÜx. Now, the contribution of the transition W¬±l to the total
current is the sum of the particle current, ¬±e if k = l and zero otherwise, and the displacement current (28) so that
the location l contributes to the total current by the amount

contribute equally to the electric current. The total current is finally obtained by summing the contributions from all
the transitions ¬±l:

I(t) =

The sum runs over all the possible charge transfers since each charge displacement in the system modifies the electric
field, inducing in turn a displacement current. Expression (30) can also be obtained from the Ramo-Shockley theorem
[11, 45‚Äì47] linking the current flowing in the external circuit to charge movement inside the system. By virtue of Eq.
(26), the mean total current is related to the mean particle current according to
hIi = eJ ,

particle and total currents differ in the properties of their non-zero frequency fluctuations.

where the sums take into account every transition in the system, in accord with Eq. (30).
In Fig. 3, we depict the power spectrum of the particle and total currents. We see that, under the same conditions,
they are qualitatively different from each other, showing that the inclusion of the displacement current affects the
fluctuations at positive frequencies and therefore must be properly taken into account. The power spectrum of
the particle current increases with the frequency œâ because the corresponding correlation function is negative. Such
anticorrelations constitute another signature of the Coulomb repulsion between the ions, which reduces the probability
of a definite transition event after jumping through the same section in the same direction. This frequency dependence
of the power spectrum reflects the memory effects induced by the long-range Coulomb interaction on the random
motion of the particles. On the other hand, the total current presents a strongly reduced noise at all frequencies
because of the long-range correlations induced by the changes in the distribution of charges. We note that the power
spectra reach a constant positive value in the high-frequency limit that results from the intrinsic randomness found
at all times scales in such stochastic processes [48]. Precisely, in this limit, the spectra Sk are given by the shot-noise
formula

In the bulk of the channel away from the boundaries by a few Debye‚Äôs lengths, the spectra Sk (œâ) turn out to be

FLUCTUATION THEOREM FOR THE CURRENTS

In this section, we focus on the fluctuations of the particle and total currents in the zero-frequency limit or,
equivalently, in the long-time limit. More precisely, we will focus on the full probability distribution of the currents,
which contain the information on the second-order noise properties as well as information on higher-order properties.
In Ref. [34] it was shown in that the probability distribution of the particle current fluctuations may obey in the
long-time limit, t ‚Üí ‚àû, a fluctuation symmetry of the form

description, detailed in Appendix B. An illustration of this relation is given in Fig. 4a where we depict the probability
distribution function of the particle current, which is compared to the prediction of the fluctuation theorem (41).
In addition, we here show that the fluctuation theorem also holds for the total current (30) exactly in the same
form:

This symmetry can be rigorously shown by extending the demonstration of Ref. [34] to the present situation where
any charge displacement in the system induces a non-local contribution to the total current, as shown by Eq. (30).
The symmetry relation (42) is illustrated in Fig. 4b. The fluctuation relations (41) and (42) describe the large
nonequilibrium current fluctuations and have important consequences on the linear and nonlinear response properties
[50].
These results show that the fluctuation theorem is verified for systems of particles interacting with complex, longranged interaction, whereas most fluctuation relations were verified for locally interacting particles, for example with
purely diffusive [51] or effusive [52] behavior, or with hard-core interaction [53]. For ion transport in channels, the
fluctuation theorem was considered in the limiting case where the electric repulsion is strong enough to prevent the
presence of more than one ion inside the channel [51, 54‚Äì56].

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have introduced a mesoscopic description of ion transport in homogeneous channels on the ground
of the laws of both electricity and statistical thermodynamics. The model is ruled by a master equation describing the
spatial distribution of the discrete numbers of ions in the channel. Indeed, the stochastic aspects of the time evolution
as well as the discrete nature of the ions are essential aspects of the behavior of matter at the mesoscopic scale.
The model incorporates the self-consistent field generated by the fixed and mobile ions as described by the Poisson
equation. Also, the model is shown to be consistent with thermodynamics and can be studied under equilibrium or
nonequilibrium conditions.
The stochastic description can be used to obtain the spatial correlations of particle density fluctuations in the channel, which reveal the strong repulsion due to the electric interaction for fluctuations that depart from electroneutrality.
Moreover, we observe long-range correlations in the electric potential fluctuations.
Another quantity of fundamental interest in the study of ion transport in channels is the experimentally measured
total current, which is composed of the particle current plus the displacement current arising from the temporal
variations of the electric field. At the macroscopic level, the displacement current vanishes in a stationary state. On
the other hand, at the mesoscopic level, the molecular fluctuations induce long-ranged electric field fluctuations which
result in a reduced noise spectrum at all positive frequencies. The particle and total currents thus differ in their
fluctuation properties and the present approach allows us to assess the importance of such effects. Furthermore, we
have shown that the fluctuation theorem for the currents holds in this more general situation as well, that is when
the displacement current is taken into account in the total current.
In summary, we have shown how to describe ion transport in homogeneous channels at the mesoscopic level. The
extension of the present considerations to the transport of several ionic species in one channel and to the case of
heterogeneous channels of relevance to biological systems is possible on the basis of the present results.

Appendix A: Solution of the channel electrostatics

The electric potential Œ¶i is defined on each cell i = 1, ..., L and obeys the discretized Poisson equation (11) (above
written in terms of the dimensionless potential œÜ = ‚àíeŒ¶/kB T ). This linear system must be solved at each time the

10
particle distribution changes and must satisfy the boundary conditions
Œ¶0 = Œ¶L ,

Œ¶L+1 = Œ¶R .

This linear system of equations can be written in matrix form as

where T denotes the transpose operation and where we introduced the charge vector Q of components Qk = e(Nk ‚àí

quantity Œ± = (N‚àí )/(n‚àí ‚àÜx2 ), which has the units of a capacitance. The L √ó L symmetric matrix C reads

for the electrostatic energy difference. Note that Eq. (16) also holds for inhomogeneous channels with  = (x) and
n‚àí = n‚àí (x).

FIG. 5: Graph associated with the random process of the master equation (12) over a chain of length L = 2. The depicted
cycle corresponds to the transfer of an ion from the left to the right reservoir. The orientations of the edges are chosen so that
a movement from left to right is counted positively.

In this appendix, we detail the thermodynamic properties of the stochastic model introduced in Sec. III. For
a system ruled by the master equation (12), a graph G is associated as follows [22]: each state œâ of the system
corresponds to a vertex or node while the edges represent the different transitions œâ 
 œâ 0 allowed between the states.
The stochastic ion transport of Sec. III is defined in terms of the populations (N1 , ..., NL ) of mobile ions inside the
channel. Accordingly, each such configuration defines a node of the graph and each transition ¬±i corresponds to one
edge. As an example the graph associated with the case L = 2 is drawn in Fig. 5.
As a matter of fact, cyclic trajectories play a special role as they link the macroscopic thermodynamic properties
to the transition rates of the mesoscopic description [22, 24]. In the case L = 2 corresponding to Fig. 5, we see that
any cyclic path in the graph can be decomposed as a linear combination of two types of cyclic trajectories:
c1 ‚â° (N1 , N2 ) ‚Üí (N1 + 1, N2 ) ‚Üí (N1 + 1, N2 + 1) ‚Üí (N1 , N2 + 1) ‚Üí (N1 , N2 )

(B1)

c2 ‚â° (N1 , N2 ) ‚Üí (N1 + 1, N2 ) ‚Üí (N1 , N2 + 1) ‚Üí (N1 , N2 ) .

(B2)

and

12
As shown by Schnakenberg [22], the macroscopic affinities associated with these cyclic paths can be obtained from
the transition rates by calculating the quantities
A(c1 ) = ln

W+0 (N1 , N2 )W‚àí2 (N1 + 1, N2 )W‚àí0 (N1 + 1, N2 + 1)W+2 (N1 , N2 + 1)
W‚àí0 (N1 + 1, N2 )W+2 (N1 + 1, N2 + 1)W+0 (N1 , N2 + 1)W‚àí2 (N1 , N2 )

(B3)

W+0 (N1 , N2 )W+1 (N1 + 1, N2 )W+2 (N1 , N2 + 1)
.
W‚àí0 (N1 + 1, N2 )W‚àí1 (N1 , N2 + 1)W‚àí2 (N1 , N2 )

(B4)

and
A(c2 ) = ln

These expressions are obtained as the ratio between the product of the transition rates along the cyclic path in one
direction over the product of the transition rates along the cyclic path in the reversed direction. Calculating the
affinities (B3) and (B4) with the transition rates (14) yields


N0 ‚àÜœÜ
A(c1 ) = 0 and A(c2 ) = ln
e
.
(B5)
NL+1
The first one always vanishes whereas the second is the macroscopic affinity (21), irrespectively of the initial configuration (N1 , ..., NL ). Note that A(c2 ) only involves externally controlled parameters, as it should. This results from the
fact that only the second cycle involves the transport of an ion across the channel. The extension to larger channels,
L > 2, is straightforward.
According to a result of Kolmogorov [57], a Markov process is at equilibrium if and only if the affinities along the
cycles vanish. As shown by Eqs. (B5) this occurs when condition (9) is fulfilled.

Several functions œà(‚àÜU ) can be chosen which satisfy the condition (20). Besides the function (15)
 which has
	 been considered
in another context [58], alternative functions are the Metropolis one œà(‚àÜU ) = (D/‚àÜx2 )min 1, e‚àíŒ≤‚àÜU , or the Kawasaki

one œà(‚àÜU ) = (D/‚àÜx2 )[2/ 1 + eŒ≤‚àÜU ], which also satisfy the condition (20) [59]. The specific form of the function œà(‚àÜU )
should be determined by the microscopic process ruling the jumps of particles between the cells. We emphasize that, in our
case, the energy difference ‚àÜU depends on the global configuration because of the long-range Coulomb interaction. This
dependence is required in order to obtain a model which is thermodynamically consistent, irrespectively of the specific
choice of the function œà.
