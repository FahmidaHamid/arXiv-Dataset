Abstract. Steady state analysis of dynamical systems for biological networks give rise to
algebraic varieties in high-dimensional spaces whose study is of interest in their own right.
We demonstrate this for the shuttle model of the Wnt signaling pathway. Here the variety
is described by a polynomial system in 19 unknowns and 36 parameters. Current methods
from computational algebraic geometry and combinatorics are applied to analyze this model.

1. Introduction
The theory of biochemical reaction networks is fundamental for systems biology [13, 27].
It is based on a wide range of mathematical fields, including dynamical systems, numerical
analysis, optimization, combinatorics, probability, and, last but not least, algebraic geometry.
There are numerous articles that use algebraic geometry in the study of biochemical reaction
networks, especially those arising from mass action kinetics. A tiny selection is [4,7,12,22,25].
We here perform a detailed analysis of one specific system, namely the shuttle model for the
Wnt signaling pathway, introduced recently by MacLean, Rosen, Byrne, and Harrington [17].
Our aim is twofold: to demonstrate how biology can lead to interesting questions in algebraic
geometry and to apply state-of-the-art techniques from computational algebra to biology.
The dynamical system we study consists of the following 19 ordinary differential equations.
Their derivation and the relevant background from biology will be presented in Section 2.

The quantity xi is a differentiable function of an unknown t, representing time, and ẋi (t) is
the derivative of that function. This dynamical system has five linear conservation laws:

The 31 quantities ki are the rate constants of the chemical reactions, and the five ci are the
conserved quantities. Both of these are regarded as parameters, so we have 36 parameters
in total. Our object of interest is the steady state variety, which is the common zero set of
the right hand sides of (1) and (2). This variety lives in K 19 , where K is an algebraically
closed field that contains the rational numbers Q as well as the 36 parameters ki and ci . If
these parameters are fixed to be particular real numbers then we can take K = C, the field
of complex numbers. If it is preferable to regard k = (k1 , . . . , k31 ) and c = (c1 , . . . , c5 ) as
vectors of unknowns, then K = Q(k, c) is the algebraic closure of the rational function field.
In this latter setting, when all parameters are generic, we shall derive the following result:
Theorem 1.1. The polynomials in (1)–(2) have 9 distinct zeros in K 19 when K = Q(k, c).
By analyzing the steady state variety, we can better understand the model, which is nonlinear, and thus the biological system. The aim is to predict the system’s behavior, offer
biological insight, and determine what data are required to verify or reject the model. Here
is a list of questions one might ask about our model from the perspective of systems biology.
Biological Problems. These are labeled according to the section that will address them.
4. For what real positive rate parameters and conserved quantities does the system exhibit
multistationarity? This question is commonly asked when using a dynamical system
for modeling a real-world phenomenon. When modeling a process that experimentally
appears to have more than one stable equilibrium, multistationary models are preferred.
5. Suppose we can measure only a subset of the species concentrations. Which subsets can
lead to model rejection? If all species are measurable at steady state, then we can substitute data into the system (1), and check that all expressions ẋi are close to zero. If only
some xi are known, we still want to be able to evaluate models with the available data.
6. Give a complete description of the stoichiometric compatibility classes for the chemical
reaction network. A stoichiometric compatibility class is the set of all points accessible
from a given state via the reactions in the system. This question relates more closely to
the dynamics of the system, but also has ramifications for the set of all steady states.
7. What information does species concentration data give us for parameter estimation?
In particular, are the parameters identifiable? Identifiability means that having many
measurements of the concentrations x can determine the reaction rate constants k. If not
identifiable, we will explore algebraic constraints imposed by the species concentration
data. This question is relevant for complete and partial steady-state data (usually noisy).
These questions are open challenges for medium to large models in systems biology and
medicine [13, 27]. The book chapter [16] illustrates standard mathematical and statistical
2

methods for addressing these questions, with Wnt signaling as a case study. Here, we examine
these questions from the perspective of algebraic geometry. The aim is to provide insight into
global behavior by applying tools from nonlinear algebra to synthetic and systems biology.
Below are the algebraic problems underlying the four biological problems listed above.
Algebraic Problems.

4. Describe the set of points (k, c) ∈ R31
>0 × R>0 such that the polynomials (1)-(2) have two
19
or more positive zeros x ∈ R>0 . When is there only one? Identify the discriminant.

5. Which projections of the variety defined by (1) into coordinate subspaces of K 19 are
surjective? Equivalently, describe the algebraic matroid on the ground set {x1 , . . . , x19 }.
6. The conservation relations (2) specify a linear map χ : R19 → R5 , x 7→ c. Describe all the
5
convex polyhedra χ−1 (c) ∩ R19
≥0 where c runs over the points in the open orthant R>0 .
7. a. Complete data: Describe the matroid on the ground set {k1 , k2 , . . . , k31 } that is defined
by the linear forms on the right hand sides of (1), for fixed steady-state concentrations.
b. Partial steady-state data without noise: Repeat the analysis after eliminating some of
the x-coordinates.
c. Partial steady-state data with noise: For the remaining x-coordinates, suppose that we
have data which are approximately on the projected steady state variety. Determine a
parameter vector (k, c) that best fits the data.
In this paper we shall address these questions, and several related ones, after explaining the
various ingredients. A particular focus is the exchange between the algebraic formulation
and its biological counterpart. Our presentation is organized as follows.
In Section 2 we review the basics on the Wnt signaling pathway, we recall the shuttle model
of MacLean et al. [17], and we derive the dynamical system (1)–(2). In Section 3 we establish
Theorem 1.1, and we examine the set of all steady states. This is here regarded as a complex
algebraic variety in an affine space of dimension 55 = 19 + 31 + 5 with coordinates (x, k, c).
In Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 we address the four problems stated above. The numbers of
the problems refer to the respective sections. Each section starts out with an explanation
of how the biological problem and the algebraic problem are related. The rationale behind
Section 4 is likely to be familiar to most of our readers, given that multistationarity has been
discussed widely in the literature; see e.g. [4, 22]. On the other hand, in Section 5 we employ
the language of matroid theory. This may be unfamiliar to many readers, especially when
it comes to the algebraic matroid associated with an irreducible algebraic variety. Section 6
characterizes the polyhedral geometry encoded in the conservation relations (2). This is a
case study in the spirit of [25, Figure 1]. Section 7 addresses the problems of parameter
identifiability and parameter estimation. Finally, in Section 8 we return to the biology, and
we discuss what our findings might imply for the study of Wnt signaling and other systems.

2. From Biology to Algebra
Cellular decisions such as cell division, specialization and cell death are governed by a rich
repertoire of complex signals that are produced by other cells and/or stimuli. In order for
a cell to come to an appropriate decision, it must sense its external environment, communicate this information to the nucleus, and respond by regulating genes and producing relevant
proteins. Signaling molecules called ligands, external to the cell, can bind to proteins called
receptors, initializing the propagation of information within the cell by molecular interactions
and modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). This signal may be relayed from the cytoplasm
into the nucleus via molecules and the cell responds by activation or deactivation of gene(s)
that control, for example, cell fate. The complex interplay of molecules involved in this information transmission is called a signaling transduction pathway. Although many signaling
pathways have been defined biochemically, much is still not understood about them or how a
signal results in a particular cellular response. Mathematical models constructed at different
scales of molecular complexity may help unravel the central mechanisms that govern cellular
decisions, and their analysis may inform and guide testable hypotheses and therapies.
In this paper, we focus on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular processes, both during development and in adult tissues. This includes stem cells.
Dysfunction of this pathway has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Consequently, Wnt signaling has been widely studied in various organisms, including amphibians
and mammals. Researchers are interested in how the extracellular ligand Wnt affects the
protein β-catenin, which plays a pivotal role in turning genes on and off in the nucleus.
The molecular interactions within the Wnt signaling pathway are not yet fully understood.
This has led to the development and analysis of many mathematical models. The Wnt
shuttle model [17] includes an abstraction of the signal transduction pathway (via activation/inactivation of molecules) described above. The model also takes into account molecules
that exist, interact and move between different compartments in the cell (e.g., cytoplasm
and nucleus). Biologists understand the Wnt system as either Wnt off or Wnt on. However, such a scenario is rarely binary (i.e., different concentration levels of Wnt may exist)
and inherently depends on spatial movement of molecules. The Wnt shuttle model includes
complex interactions with nonlinearities arising in the equations. In particular, it includes
both the Wnt off and Wnt on scenarios, by adjusting initial conditions or parameter values.
The biology needed to understand the model can be described as follows. See also Table 1.
Wnt off: When cells do not sense the extracellular ligand Wnt, β-catenin is degraded (broken down). The degradation of β-catenin is partially dependent on a group of molecules
(Axin, APC and GSK-3) that form the destruction complex. Crucially, the break down of
β-catenin occurs when the destruction complex is in an active state; modification to the
destruction complex by proteins, called phosphatases, changes it from inactive to active.
Additionally, β-catenin can degrade independent of the destruction complex. Synthesis of
β-catenin occurs at a constant rate.
Wnt on: When receptors on the surface of a cell bind to Wnt, the Wnt signaling transduction pathway is initiated. This enables β-catenin to move into the nucleus where it binds
with transcription factors that regulate genes. This signal propagation is mediated by the
following molecular interactions. After Wnt stimulus, the protein Dishevelled is activated
4

near the membrane. This in turn inactivates the destruction complex, thereby preventing
the destruction of β-catenin, allowing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm through natural
synthesis. Throughout the molecular interactions in the signaling pathway, intermediate
complexes can form (e.g., β-catenin bound with Dishevelled).
Space: The location of molecules plays a pivotal role: β-catenin moves between the cytoplasm
and the nucleus (to reach target genes and regulate them). Dishevelled and molecules that
form the destruction complex shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, it
is assumed that only the inactive destruction complex can shuttle (since in the cytoplasm it
would be bound to β-catenin). Phosphatases exist in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm
but the movement across compartments is not included in the model. Symmetry of reactions
is assumed if the species exist in both compartments. Intermediate complexes are assumed
to be short-lived, or not large enough for movement across compartments.
The Wnt shuttle model of [17] has 19 species whose interactions can be framed as biochemical
reactions. These species correspond to variables x1 , . . . , x19 in our dynamical system (1).
Namely, xi represents the concentration of the species that is listed in the ith row in Table 1.

Explanation

Table 2: The 31 reactions in the Wnt shuttle model.
The 31 reactions in Table 2 translate into a dynamical system ẋ = Ψ(x; k). Here Ψ is a
vector-valued function of the vectors of species concentrations x and rate constants k. The
choice of Ψ is up to the modeler. In this paper, we assume that Ψ represents the law of
mass action [13, §2.1.1]. This is precisely what is used in [17] for the Wnt shuttle model.
The resulting dynamical system is (1). We refer to [4, 7, 12, 22, 25] and their many references
for mass action kinetics and its variants. In summary, Table 2 translates into the dynamical
system (1) under the law of mass action. The five relations in (2) constitute a basis for the
linear space of conservation relations of the model in Table 2 assuming mass action kinetics.
6

We refer to x1 , . . . , x19 as the species concentrations, k1 , . . . , k31 as the rate parameters,
and c1 , . . . , c5 as the conserved quantities. We write x, k and c for the vectors with these
coordinates. As is customary in algebraic geometry, we take the coordinates in the complex
numbers C, or possibly in some other algebraically closed field K containing the rationals Q.
Our aim is to understand the relationships between x, k and c in the Wnt shuttle model. To
this end, we introduce the steady state variety S ⊂ C55 . This is the set of all points (x, k, c)
that satisfy the equations ẋ1 = . . . = ẋ19 = 0 in (1) along with the five conservation laws
5
31
in (2). We write our ambient affine space as C55 = C19
x × Ck × Cc . This emphasizes the
distinction between the species concentrations, rate parameters, and conserved quantities.
3. Ideals, Varieties, and Nine Points
We write I for the ideal in the polynomial ring Q[x, k] = Q[x1 , . . . x19 , k1 , . . . k31 ] that is
generated by the 19 polynomials ẋi on the right hand side of (1). Five of these generators
are redundant. Indeed, the conservation relations (2) give the following identities modulo I:
ẋ1 + ẋ2 + ẋ3 + ẋ14 + ẋ15 = ẋ8 + ẋ16 = ẋ9 + ẋ17 = ẋ12 + ẋ13 =
ẋ4 + ẋ5 + ẋ6 + ẋ7 + ẋ14 + ẋ15 + ẋ16 + ẋ17 + ẋ18 + ẋ19 = 0.
For instance, the polynomials ẋ13 , ẋ15 , ẋ16 , ẋ17 and ẋ19 are redundant because they can be
expressed as negated sums of other generators of I. Hence I is generated by 14 polynomials.
31
The variety V (I) lives in the 50-dimensional affine space C19
x × Ck , and it is isomorphic to
the steady state variety S ⊂ C55 . A direct computation using the computer algebra package
Macaulay2 [11] shows that V (I) has dimension 36. Hence the affine ideal I is a complete
intersection in Q[x, k]. Furthermore, using Macaulay2 we can verify the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1. The ideal I admits the non-trivial decomposition I = Im ∩Ie , where Ie = I : hx1 i
and Im = I + hx1 i, both of these components have codimension 14, and Ie is a prime ideal.
The ideal Im is called the main component, while Ie is called the extinction component, since
it reflects those steady states where a number of the reactants “run out.” Both of these ideals
live in Q[x, k], and we now present explicit generators. The extinction component equals
Ie = hx1 , x2 , x3 , x5 , x7 , x14 , x15 , x16 , x17 , k30 x10 − (k23 + k31 )x11 − k22 x19 ,
k13 x10 + k23 x11 + k11 x18 + k22 x19 − k12 , k24 x11 x12 − k25 x13 ,
k20 x6 x11 − (k21 + k22 )x19 , k9 x4 x10 − (k10 + k11 )x18 i.
The ideal Ie is found to be prime in Q[x, k]. The main component equals
Im = hk16 x15 − k19 x17 , k5 x14 − k8 x16 , k30 x10 − (k23 + k31 )x11 − k22 x19 ,
k13 x10 + k23 x11 + k11 x18 + k22 x19 − k12 , k28 x5 − k29 x7 , k26 x2 − k27 x3 ,

This ideal is not prime in Q[x, k]. For instance, the variable k1 is a zerodivisor modulo Im ,
as seen from the last generator. Removing the factor k1 from the last generator yields the
quotient ideal Im : hk1 i. However, even that ideal still has several associated primes. All of
these prime ideals, except for one, contain some of the rate constants ki .
That special component is characterized in the following proposition. Given any ideal J ⊂
Q[x, k], we write Je = Q(k)[x]J for its extension to the polynomial ring Q(k)[x] in the
unknowns x1 , . . . , x19 over the field of rational functions in the parameters k1 , . . . , k31 .
50
Proposition 3.2. The ideal Jm = If
m ∩ Q[x, k] is prime. Its irreducible variety V (Jm ) ⊂ C
has dimension 36; it is the unique component of V (Im ) that maps dominantly onto C31
k .

Proof. The ideal If
m has the same generators as Im but now regarded as polynomials in x with
coefficients in Q(k). Symbolic computation in the ring Q(k)[x] reveals that If
m is a prime
ideal. This implies that Jm is a prime ideal in Q[x, k], and hence V (Jm ) is irreducible. The
dimension statement follows from the result of Lemma 3.1 that Im is a complete intersection.
This ensures that V (Im ) has no lower-dimensional components, by Krull’s Principal Ideal
Theorem. Finally, V (Jm ) maps dominantly onto C31

k because Jm ∩ Q[k] = {0}.
Corollary 3.3. The ideal Ie is radical, and it is the intersection of two primes in Q(k)[x]:
(3)

Ie = Iee ∩ If
m.

Proof. This follows directly from Proposition 3.2 and the primality of Ie in Lemma 3.1. 
The decomposition has the following geometric interpretation. We now work over the field
e is the 5-dimensional
K = Q(k). All rate constants are taken to be generic. Then V (I)
19
variety of all steady states in K . This variety is the union of two irreducible components,
e = V (Iee ) ∪ V (If
V (I)
m ),
where each component is 5-dimensional. The first component lies inside the 10-dimensional
coordinate subspace V (x1 , x2 , x3 , x5 , x7 , x14 , x15 , x16 , x17 ). Hence it is disjoint from the hyperplane defined by the first conservation relation x1 + x2 + x3 + x14 + x15 = c1 . In other
words, V (Iee ) is mapped into a coordinate hyperplane under the map χ : K 19 → K 5 , x 7→ c.
5
On the other hand, the second component V (If
m ) maps dominantly onto K under χ. Theorem 1.1 states that the generic fiber of this map consists of 9 reduced points. Equivalently,
(4)

e = χ−1 (c) ∩ V (If
χ−1 (c) ∩ V (I)
m)

is a set of nine points in K 19 . We are now prepared to argue that this is indeed the case.
Computational Proof of Theorem 1.1. We consider the ideal of the variety (4) in the polynomial ring Q(k, c)[x]. This polynomial ring has 19 variables, and all 36 parameters are now
scalars in the coefficient field. This ideal is generated by the right hand sides of (1) and (2).
Performing a Gröbner basis computation in this polynomial ring verifies that our ideal is
zero-dimensional and has length 9. Hence (4) is a reduced affine scheme of length 9 in K 19 .
Fast numerical verification of this result is obtained by replacing the coordinates of k and c
with generic (random rational) values. In Macaulay2 one finds, with probability 1, that the
8

resulting ideals in Q[x] are radical of length 9. We also verified this result via numerical
algebraic geometry, using the two software packages Bertini [1] and PHCpack [26].

4. Multistationarity and its Discriminant
This section centers around Question 4 from the Introduction: For what real positive rate
parameters and conserved quantities does the system exhibit multistationarity? This is commonly asked about biochemical reaction networks and about dynamical systems in general.
Mathematically, this is a problem of real algebraic geometry. Writing S for the steady state
31
5
variety in C55 , we are interested in the fibers of the map πk,c : S ∩ R55
>0 → R>0,k × R>0,c .
19
According to Theorem 1.1, the general fiber consists of 9 complex points x ∈ Cx , when the
map πk,c is taken over C. But here we take it over the reals R or over the positive reals R>0 .
In our application to biology, we only care about concentration vectors x whose coordinates
5
are real and positive. Thus we wish to stratify R31
>0,k × R>0,c according to the cardinality of
	

−1
0
0
(5)
πk,c
(k, c) = (x, k0 , c0 ) ∈ S ∩ R55
>0 : k = k and c = c .
5
This stratification comes from a decomposition of the 36-dimensional orthant R31
>0,k × R>0,c
into connected open semialgebraic subsets. The walls in this decomposition are given by the
discriminant ∆, a giant polynomial in the 36 unknowns (k, c) that is to be defined later.

We begin with the following result on what is possible with regard to real positive solutions.
Theorem 4.1. Consider the polynomial system in (1)–(2) where all parameters ki and cj
are positive real numbers. The set (5) of positive real solutions can have 1, 2, or 3 elements.
Proof. For random choices of (k, c) = (k1 , . . . , k31 , c1 , . . . , c5 ) in the orthant R36
>0 , our polynomial system has 9 complex solutions, by Theorem 1.1. For the following two special choices
of the 36 parameter values, all 9 solutions are real. First, take (k, c) to be the vector
(1.7182818, 53.2659, 3.4134082, 0.61409879, 0.61409879, 3.4134082, 0.98168436, 0.98168436,

The resulting system has three positive solutions x ∈ R19
>0 . Next, let (k , c ) be the vector

(0.948166, 7.45086, 5.72974, 3.96947, 7.21145, 7.8761, 1.87614, 8.11372, 6.21862, 5.24801,

7.22696, 1.45438, 3.36482, 6.06453, 4.82045, 3.6014).

Here, one solution to our system is positive. By connecting the two parameter points above
00 00
with a general curve in R36
>0 , and by examining in-between points (k , c ), we can construct a
system with two positive solutions. All computations were carried out using Bertini [1]. 
Remark 4.2. At present, we do not know whether the number of real positive solutions can
be larger than three. We suspect that this is impossible, but we currently cannot prove it.
9

The difficulty lies in the fact that the stratification of R36
>0 is extremely complicated. In
computer algebra, the derivation of such stratifications is known as the problem of real root
classification. For a sample of recent studies in this direction see [3, 6, 23]. Real root classification is challenging even when the number of parameters is 3 or 4; clearly, 36 parameters
is out of the question. The stratification of R36
>0 by behavior of (5) has way too many cells.
While symbolic techniques for real root classification are infeasible for our system, we can use
numerical algebraic geometry [9] to gain insight into the stratification of R36
>0 . Coefficientparameter homotopies [19] can solve the steady state polynomial system (1)-(2) for multiple
choices of (k, c) quickly. For our computations we use Bertini.m2. This is the Bertini
interface for Macaulay2, as described in [2]. Each system has 19 equations in 19 unknowns
and, for random (k, c), each system has 9 complex solutions. Such a system can be solved
in less than one second using the bertiniParameterHomotopy function from Bertini.m2.
Below we describe the following experiment. We sample 10, 000 parameter vectors (k, c)
from two different probability distributions on R36
>0 . In each case we report the observed
frequencies for the number of real solutions and number of positive solutions. We then follow
these experiments with a specialized sampling scheme for testing numerical robustness.
Uniform sampling scheme: Here we choose (k, c) uniformly from the cube (0.0, 100.0)36 .
Sampling 10,000 parameter vectors from this scheme and solving the steady state system for
each of these parameter vectors in Bertini, we obtained 9, 992 solutions sets that contained
9 complex points. Solution sets with less than 9 points occur when some paths in the
coefficient-parameter homotopy fail. We call solution sets with 9 solutions good.
Integer sampling scheme: Here we select (k, c) uniformly from {1, 2, 3}36 . Sampling 10,000
parameter vectors according to this scheme and solving the corresponding steady state system
returned 9, 963 good solution sets. Below is a table that records how many of the good
solution sets had 9, 7, 5, 3 real solutions; all solution sets had 1 positive real solution.

These computations indicate that for most parameter vectors in (0, 100)36 we will see only
one positive solution to the steady state system. But while the set of parameter vectors that
result in multiple steady states is not very large, we can give evidence that multistationarity
is preserved under small perturbations. This is our next point.
Testing Robustness: Let (k∗ , c∗ ) be the first point in the proof of Theorem 4.1. For each
index i ∈ {1, . . . , 19} we choose yi uniformly from (−0.03 · ki∗ , 0.03 · ki∗ ) then set ki = ki∗ + yi .
We ran the same process for the ci . Sampling 10, 000 parameter vectors this way and solving
the corresponding steady state systems returned 10, 000 good solution sets, as follows:

In the remainder of this section, we properly define the discriminant ∆ that separates the
31
5
various strata in R36
>0 . Let ∆int denote the Zariski closure in Ck ×Cc of all parameter vectors
(k, c) for which (1)–(2) does not have 9 isolated complex solutions and there are no solutions
with xi = 0 for some i. It can be shown that ∆int is a hypersurface that is defined over Q, so
it is given by a unique (up to sign) irreducible squarefree polynomial in Z[k, c]. We use the
symbol ∆int also for that polynomial. To be precise, ∆int is the discriminant of a number
field L with K ⊃ L ⊃ Q, namely L is the field of definition of the finite K-scheme (4).
Next, for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 19} consider the intersection of the steady state variety S with
the hyperplane {xi = 0}. The Zariski closure of the image of S ∩ {xi = 0} under the map
31
πk,c is a hypersurface in C19
k × Cc , defined over Q, and we write ∆xi =0 for the unique (up
to sign) irreducible polynomial in Z[k, c] that vanishes on that hypersurface. We now define

∆ := ∆int · lcm ∆x1 =0 , ∆x2 =0 , . . . , ∆x19 =0 .
This product with a least common multiple (lcm) is the discriminant for our problem.
Example 4.3. The degree of ∆int as a polynomial only in c = (c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 , c5 ) equals 34.
To illustrate this, we set c = 5, 16 + C, 58 − C, 65 + C, 3 − C where C is a parameter, and

Under this specialization, the polynomial ∆int becomes an irreducible polynomial of degree
34 in the parameter C. Its coefficients are enormously large integers. It has 14 real roots.
For the other factors ∆xi =0 of the discriminant, we find the following specializations:

(6)

x1 → 0, x2 → 0, x3 → 0, x4 → (C+16)(5C−8), x5 → C+16, x6 → (C+16)(5C+6),
x7 → C+16, x8 → 5C − 8, x9 → 5C + 6, x10 → a quartic q(C), x11 → 0, x12 → C−3,
x13 → C−3, x14 → (C+16)(5C−8), x15 → (C+16)(5C+6), x16 → (C+16)(5C−8),
x17 → (C+16)(5C+6), x18 → (C+16)(5C−8)q(C), x19 → (C+16)(5C+6).

These polynomials have 8 distinct real roots in total, so the total number of real roots of the
discriminant is 14 + 8 = 22. These are the break points where real root behavior changes:
(9, 0) −77.2388 (9, 0) −16.0000 (9, 0) −5.28669 (7, 0) −1.57472
(9, 0) −1.46506 (9, 0) −1.34899 (7, 0) −1.29581 (9, 0) −1.20000

(7, 0) 21.4165 (9, 0) 310.141 (9, 0)
In this table, we list all 22 roots of the specialized discriminant ∆(C). The eight boldface
values of C are the roots of (6): here one of the coordinates of x becomes zero. At the other
14 values of C, the number of real roots changes. Between any two roots we list the pair
(r, p), where r is the number of real roots and p is the number of positive real roots. For
instance, for −0.361808 < C < 0.191039, there are 7 real roots of which 3 are positive.

5. Algebraic Matroids and Parametrizations
Question 5 asks: Suppose we can measure only a subset of the species concentrations. Which
subsets can lead to model rejection? This issue is important for the Wnt shuttle model
because, in the laboratory, only some of the species are measurable by existing techniques.
We shall address Question 5 using algebraic matroids. Matroid theory allows us to analyze
the structure of relationships among the 19 species in Table 1. This first appeared in [17].
We here present an in-depth study of the matroids that govern the Wnt shuttle model.
An introduction to (algebraic) matroids can be found in [21]; they have been applied in
[14, 15] to problems involving the completion of partial information. General algorithms for
computing algebraic matroids are derived in [24]. We briefly review basic notions.
Definition 5.1. A matroid is an ordered pair (X, I), where X is a finite set, here regarded as
unknowns, and I is a subset of the power set of X. These satisfy certain independence axioms.
For an algebraic matroid, we are given a prime ideal P in the polynomial ring K[X] generated
by X, and I consists of subsets of X whose images in K[X]/P
are algebraically independent

	
over K. Thus, the collection of independent sets is I = Y ⊆ X : P ∩ K[Y ] = {0} .
1. Bases are maximal independent sets, i.e. subsets in I that have maximal cardinality.
2. Rank is a function ρ from the power set of X to the natural numbers, which takes as input
a set Y ⊂ X and returns the cardinality of the largest subset of Y in I.
3. Closure is a function from the power set 2X to itself. The input is a set Y and the output
is the largest set containing Y with the same rank.
4. Flats are the elements in 2X that lie in the image of the closure map.
5. Circuits are the sets of minimal cardinality not contained in I.
We are here interested in the matroid that is defined by the prime ideal P = If
m in Q(k)[x]. Its
f
ground set X is the set of species concentrations {x1 , . . . , x19 }. Since V (Im ) is 5-dimensional,
each basis consists of five elements in X. In our application, bases are the maximal subsets of
X that can be specified independently at steady state; they are also the minimal-cardinality
sets that can be measured to learn all species concentrations. The rank of a set Y indicates
the number of measurements required to learn the concentrations for every element of Y .
Flats are the full subsets that are specified by any given collection of measurements.
Circuits furnish our answer to Question 5: they are minimal sets of species that can be used
to test compatibility of the data with the model. For each circuit Y there is a unique-upto-scalars relation in If
m ∩ Q(k)[Y ], called the circuit polynomial of Y . If the measurements
indicate that this relation is not satisfied, then the model and data are not compatible.
Proposition 5.2. The algebraic matroid of If
m has rank 5. It has 951 circuits, summarized
in Table 5. Of the 11628 subsets of X of size 5, precisely 2389 are bases. The 2092 bases
summarized in Table 6 have base degree 1, while the remaining 297 have base degree 2.
The computation of this matroid was carried out using the methods described in [24]. It was
first reported in [17], along with the matroids of alternative models for the Wnt pathway.
The idea there was to find subsets of variables that were dependent for different models.
12

Our matroid analysis here goes beyond [17] in several ways:
1. We keep track of the parameters k. We take our circuit polynomials to have (relatively
prime) coefficients in Z[k]. This gives us a new tool for model rejection, e.g. in situations
where only one data point is known but some parameter values are available.
2. We show how circuits can be used in parameter estimation; this will be done in Section 8.
3. We use the degree-1 bases to derive rational parametrizations of the variety V (If
m ).
We now explain Table 5. A circuit polynomial has type (i, j) if it contains i species concentrations (x-variables) and j rate parameters (k-variables). The entry in row i and column j
in Table 5 is the number of circuits of type (i, j). Zero values are omitted for clarity.

Table 5. The 951 circuit polynomials, by numbers of unknowns xi and kj .
Example 5.3. There are five circuits of type (2, 2). One of them is ẋ1 = −k1 x1 +k2 x2 . Most
of the 951 circuit polynomials in If
m are more complicated. In particular, they are non-linear
in both x and y. For instance, the unique circuit polynomial of type (6, 11) equals
(−k15 k17 k19 k20 k25 − k16 k17 k19 k20 k25 )x7 x9 x13
+(k14 k16 k18 k21 k24 + k14 k16 k19 k21 k24 + k14 k16 k18 k22 k24 + k14 k16 k19 k22 k24 )x3 x12 x19 .
In Section 7, we will consider the role of these nonlinear functions in parameter estimation.
Given a basis Y of an algebraic matroid, its base degree is the length of the generic fiber of
the projection of V (P ) onto the Y -coordinates (cf. [24]). Bases with degree 1 are desirable:
Proposition 5.4. Let P ⊂ K[X] be a prime ideal, Y a basis of its algebraic matroid,
|X| = n, and |Y | = r. If Y has base degree 1 then V (P ) is a rational variety, and the basic
circuits of Y specify a birational map ϕY : K r 99K K n whose image is Zariski dense in V (P )
Proof. For each coordinate xi in X\Y there exists a circuit containing Y ∪ {xi }; this is the
basic circuit of (Y, xi ). Since Y has base degree 1, the generic fiber of the map V (P ) → K r
consists of a unique point. Therefore the circuit polynomial is linear in xi . It has the form
pi (Y ) · xi + qi (Y ),

where pi , qi ∈ K[Y ].

The i-coordinate of the rational map ϕY equals xi if xi ∈ Y and −qi (Y )/pi (Y ) if xi ∈
/ Y. 
13

From Propositions 5.2 and 5.4, we obtain 2092 rational parametrizations of the variety V (If
m ).
5
19
These are the maps ϕY : K 99K K , where Y runs over all bases of base degree 1. Using
these ϕY , we obtain 2092 representations of the steady state variety (4) as a subset of K 5 ,
where now K = Q(k, c). Namely, we consider the preimages of the five hyperplanes defined
by (2). These are hypersurfaces in K 5 whose intersection represents the nine points in (4).
We performed the following computation for all 2092 bases Y = {y1 , . . . , y5 } of base degree 1:
1. Substitute x = ϕY (y1 , . . . , y5 ) into the five linear equations (2).
2. Clear the denominators d1 , . . . , d5 in each equation to get polynomials h1 , . . . , h5 in Y .
3. The saturation ideal JY = hh1 , . . . , h5 i : hd1 d2 · · · d5 i∞ represents the preimage of (4).
Given such a wealth of parametrizations, we seek one where JY has desirable properties.
We use the following criterion: consider subsets of five of the generators of JY , compute the
mixed volume of their Newton polytopes, and fix a subset minimizing that mixed volume. In
the census of 2092 bases in Table 6, that minimum is referred to as the mixed volume of Y .

Table 6. Reducing the steady state equations to the 2092 bases of base degree 1
By Bernstein’s Theorem, the mixed volume is the number of solutions to a generic system
with the five given Newton polytopes. We seek bases Y where this matches the number nine
from Theorem 1.1. We see that the mixed volume is nine for 416 of the bases in Table 6.
Example 5.5. The basis Y = {x1 , x4 , x6 , x8 , x13 } has base degree 1 and mixed volume 9.
The remaining variables can be expressed in terms of Y as follows. For brevity, we set
r(x4 , x6 ) =
k9 k11 k20 k22 x4 x6 + k9 k11 (k21 + k22 )(k23 + k31 )x4

where the α1 , . . . , α25 are certain explicit rational functions in the k-parameters.

6. Polyhedral Geometry
Dynamics of the system while not at steady state cannot typically be studied with algebraic
methods. One exception is the set of all possible states accessible from a given set of initial
values via the chemical reactions in the model. This set is called a stoichiometric compatibility
class in the biochemistry literature. Mathematically, these classes are convex polyhedra. We
determine them all for the Wnt shuttle model. This resolves Problem 6 from the Introduction.
The conservation relations (2) define a linear map χ from the orthant of concentrations R19
≥0
to the orthant of conserved quantities R5≥0 . We express this projection as a 5×19-matrix:

Let Pc denote the fiber of the map χ for c ∈ R5≥0 . This is known in the biochemical
literature as the invariant polyhedron or the stoichiometric compatibility class of the given x;
see e.g. [25, (3)]. The fiber over the origin is P0 = R≥0 {e10 , e11 }, the two-dimensional
orthant formed by all positive linear combinations of e10 and e11 . If c ∈ R5≥0 is an interior
point, then Pc is a 14-dimensional convex polyhedron of the form P0 × P̃c where P̃c is
a 12-dimensional (compact) polytope. Two vectors c and c0 are considered equivalent if
their invariant polyhedra Pc and Pc0 have the same normal fan. This property is much
stronger than being combinatorially isomorphic. The equivalence classes are relatively open
polyhedral cones, and they define a partition of R5≥0 . This partition is the chamber complex
of the matrix (7). For a low-dimensional illustration, see [25, Figure 1]. Informally speaking,
the chamber complex classifies the possible boundary behaviors of our dynamical system.
Proposition 6.1. The chamber complex of our 5×19-matrix divides R5≥0 into 19 maximal
cones. It is the product of a ray, R≥0 , and the cone over a subdivision of the tetrahedron.
That subdivision consists of 18 smaller tetrahedra and 1 bipyramid, described in detail below.
Proof. The product structure arises because the matrix has two blocks after permuting
columns, an upper left 4×17 block and a lower right 1×2 block (1 1). Our task is to compute
the chamber decomposition of R4≥0 defined by the 4 × 17-block. After deleting zero columns
15

and multiple columns, we are left with a 4 × 7-matrix, given by the seven left columns in

The correspondence between the seven left columns of M and the columns of (7) is as follows:
a = {x4 , x5 , x6 , x7 , x18 , x19 }, b = {x14 , x15 }, c = {x16 },
d = {x17 }, e = {x1 , x2 , x3 }, f = {x8 }, g = {x9 }.
The remaining columns of M are additional vertices in the subdivision.
The following table lists the 19 maximal chambers. For each chamber we list the extreme rays
and the facet-defining inequalities. For instance, the chamber in R5≥0 denoted by ef jk is the
orthant spanned by the columns e, f , j and k of the matrix M times the ray (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)T . It
is defined by c5 ≥ 0 together with the four listed inequalities: c4 ≥ 0, min(c1 , c3 ) ≥ c2 ≥ c4 .

Interpreting the columns of M as homogeneous coordinates, the table describes a subdivision
of the standard tetrahedron into 18 tetrahedra and one bipyramid hijkl. These cells use the
12 vertices a, b, . . . , l. The reader is invited to check that this subdivision has precisely 39
edges and 47 triangles, so the Euler characteristic is correct: 12 − 39 + 47 − 19 = 1.

We shall prove the following result about the Wnt shuttle model.
Proposition 6.2. Suppose that the rate constants ki and the conserved quantities cj are all
strictly positive. Then no steady states exist on the boundary of the invariant polyhedron Pc .
16

Proof. Consider the two components Im and Ie of the steady state ideal I given in Lemma 3.1.
We intersect each of the two varieties with the affine-linear space defined by the conservation
relations (2) for some c ∈ R5>0 . We claim that all solutions x satisfy xi 6= 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , 19.
For the main component V (Im ), we prove this assertion with the help of the parametrization
ϕY from Example 5.5. If the values of x1 , x4 , x6 , x8 , x13 and of the expression r(x4 , x6 ) are
nonzero, then each coordinate of ϕY is nonzero. We next observe that r(x4 , x6 ) > 0 for any
k > 0 and x ≥ 0. A case analysis, using binomial relations in the ideal Im , reveals that if
any of x1 , x4 , x6 , x8 , x13 are zero, some coordinate of c is forced to zero as well:
x1 = 0 ⇒
x2 , x3 , x14 , x15
x13 = 0 ⇒
x12
x4 = 0 ⇒ x5 , x6 , x7 , x14 , x15 , x16 , x17 , x18 , x19

It remains to consider the extinction component. Its ideal Ie contains the set b ∪ l =
{x1 , x2 , x3 , x14 , x15 }. The corresponding columns of the matrix in (7) are the only columns
with a nonzero entry in the fourth row. This implies that c4 = 0 holds for every steady state in
V (Ie ). We conclude that there are no steady states on the boundary of the polyhedron Pc . 
Remark 6.3. In this proof we did not need the detailed description of the chamber complex,
because of the special combinatorial structure in the Wnt shuttle model. In general, when
studying chemical reaction networks that arise in systems biology, an analysis like Proposition
6.1 is requisite for gaining information about possible zero coordinates in the steady states.
7. Parameter Estimation
Question 7 asks: What information does species concentration data give us for parameter
estimation? This question is of particular importance to experimentalists, as species concentrations depend on initial conditions, whereas parameter values are intrinsic to the biological
process being modeled. Identifiability of parameters has been studied in many contexts, notably in statistics [8] and in biological modeling [19]. Sometimes, as in [19], parameters are
determined from complete time-course data of the dynamical system, making a differential
algebra approach desirable. In the present paper we focus on the steady state variety, so we
consider data collection only at steady state. We assume that there is a true but unknown
parameter vector k∗ ∈ R31 of rate constants, and our data are sampled from the positive
real points x on the variety in R19 that is defined by the 19 polynomials in (1).
7.1. Complete Species Information. The first algebraic question we answer: To what
extent is the true parameter vector k∗ determined by points on its steady state variety?
To address this question, we form the polynomial matrix F (x) of format 19 × 31 whose
entries are the coefficients of the right-hand sides of (1), regarded as linear forms in k. With
this notation, our dynamical system (1) can be written in matrix-vector product form as
ẋ = F (x) · k.
17

Our data points are sampled from

	
∗
(8)
x ∈ R19
>0 : F (x) · k = 0 .
Let x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . denote generic data points in (8). The set of all parameter vectors k that
are compatible with these data is a linear subspace of R31 , namely it is the intersection
(9)

kernel(F (x1 )) ∩ kernel(F (x2 )) ∩ kernel(F (x3 )) ∩ · · ·

The best we can hope to recover from sampling data is the following subspace containing k∗ :
\
(10)
kernel(F (x)) ⊂ R31 .
x in (8)

We refer to (10) as the space of parameters compatible with k∗ . A direct computation reveals:
Proposition 7.1. The space of all parameters compatible with k∗ is a 14-dimensional subspace of R31 . If x is generic then the kernel of F (x) is a 17-dimensional subspace of R31 .
This has the following noteworthy consequence for our biological application:
Corollary 7.2. The parameters of the Wnt shuttle model are not identifiable from steady
state data, but there are 14 degrees of freedom in recovering the true parameter vector k∗ .
Our next step is to gain a more precise understanding of the subspaces in Proposition 7.1.
To do this, we shall return to the combinatorial setting of matroid theory. We introduce two
matroids on the 31 reactions in Table 2. The common ground set is K = {k1 , k2 , . . . , k31 }.
The one-point matroid Mone is the rank 17 matroid on K defined by the linear subspace
kernel(F (x)) of R31 where x ∈ R19 is generic. The parameter matroid Mpar is the rank 14
matroid on K defined by the space (10) of all parameters compatible with a generic k∗ . The
following result, obtained by calculations, reflects the block structure of the matrix F (x).

Figure 1. Graphic representation of the one-point matroid Mone of rank 17.
The rank 4 component of the rank 14 parameter matroid Mpar is not graphic.
Proposition 7.3. The one-point matroid Mone is the graphic matroid of the graph shown in
Figure 1 a). Its seven connected components are matroids of ranks 3, 3, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1. The rank
14 parameter matroid Mpar is obtained from Mone by specializing the rank 7 component to
the rank 4 matroid on 11 elements whose affine representation is shown in Figure 1 b).
18

This characterizes the combinatorial constraints imposed on the parameters k by measuring
the species concentrations at steady state. For a single measurement x, the result on Mone
tells us that the 19 × 31-matrix F (x) has rank 14 = 31 − rank(Mone ). After row operations,
it block-decomposes into two matrices of format 3 × 6, one matrix of format 4 × 11, and four
matrices of format 1 × 2. Each of these seven matrices is row-equivalent to the node-edge
cycle matrix of a directed graph, with underlying undirected graph as in Figure 1 (a).
Consider the graph with edges 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 31. The cycle {22, 23, 30, 31}
reveals that our measurement x imposes one linear constraint on k22 , k23 , k30 , k31 . If we take
further measurements, as in (9), then six of the seven blocks of F (x) remain unchanged. Only
the 4 × 11-block of F (x) must be enlarged, to a 7 × 11-matrix. The rows of that new matrix
specify the affine-linear dependencies among 11 points in R3 . That point configuration
is depicted in Figure 1 (b). For instance, the points {9, 10, 11} are collinear, the points
{20, 21, 22} are collinear, but these two lines are skew in R3 . From the other line we see that
that repeated measurements at steady state impose two linear constraints on k22 , k23 , k30 , k31 .

7.2. Circuit Data. The second question we address in this section: Given partial species
concentration data, is any information about parameters available? In Section 7.1, all 19
concentrations xi were available for a steady state. In what follows, we suppose that xi can
only be measured for indices i in a subset of the species, say C ⊂ {1, . . . , 19}. In our analysis,
it will be useful to take advantage of the rank 5 algebraic matroid in Proposition 5.2, since
that matroid governs dependencies among the coordinates x1 , . . . , x19 at steady states.
We here focus on the special case when C is one of the 951 circuits of the algebraic matroid
of If
m . Let fC be the corresponding circuit polynomial, as in Table 5. We regard fC as a
polynomial in x whose coefficients are polynomials in Q[k]. Suppose that fC has r monomials
xa1 , . . . , xar . We write FC ∈ Q[k]r for the vector of coefficients, so our circuit polynomial is
the dot product fC (k, x) = FC (k)·(xa1 , . . . , xar ). We write VC ⊂ Rr for the algebraic variety
parametrized by FC (k). Thus VC is the Zariski closure in Rr of the set {FC (k0 ) : k0 ∈ R31 }.
Our idea for parameter recovery is this: rather than looking for k compatible with the true
parameter k∗ , we seek a point y = FC (k) in VC that is compatible with FC (k∗ ). And, only
later do we compute a preimage of y under the map R31 → Rr given by FC . Most interesting
is the case when VC is a proper subvariety of Rr . Direct computations yield the following:
Proposition 7.4. For precisely 288 of the 951 circuits C of the algebraic matroid of the
steady state ideal If
m , the coefficient variety VC is a proper subvariety in its ambient space
Rr . In each of these cases, the defining ideal of VC is of one of the following four types:
(11)

hy2 y6 − y3 y5 i

(12)

hy5 y6 − 2y3 y7 , y52 − 4y2 y7 , y3 y5 − 2y2 y6 , y2 y62 − y32 y7 i

(13)

hy3 y52 − y2 y5 y6 + y1 y62 i

(14)

h2y3 y4 − y2 y5 , y2 y3 − 2y1 y5 , y22 − 4y1 y4 i
19

Example 7.5. Consider the circuit C = {6, 10, 18}. The circuit polynomial fC equals
(k13 k20 k22 + k20 k22 k30 ) · x6 x10 + k11 k20 k22 · x6 x18 − k12 k20 k22 · x6
+(k13 k21 k23 + k13 k22 k23 + k21 k23 k30 + k22 k23 k30 + k13 k21 k31 + k13 k22 k31 ) · x10
+(k11 k21 k23 + k11 k22 k23 + k11 k21 k31 + k11 k22 k31 ) · x18
− (k12 k21 k23 + k12 k22 k23 + k12 k21 k31 + k12 k22 k31 ).
Here r = 6 and we write FC (k) = (y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 , y5 , y6 ) for the vector of coefficient polynomials. The variety VC is the hypersurface in R5 defined by the equation y2 y6 = y3 y5 .
We now sample data points xi from the model with the true (but unknown) parameter vector
k∗ . Each such point defines a hyperplane {y ∈ Rr : y · (xa11 , . . . , xar r ) = 0}. The parameter
estimation problem is to find the intersection of these data hyperplanes with the variety VC .
That intersection contains the point y∗ = FC (k∗ ), which is what we now aim to recover.
7.3. Noisy Circuit Data. The final question we consider in this section is: Given partial
species concentration data with noise, is any information about parameters available?
As in Section 7.2, we fix a circuit C of the algebraic matroid in Section 5, and we assume
that we can only measure the concentrations xj where j ∈ C. Each measurement xi ∈ RC
still defines a hyperplane y · (xai 1 , . . . , xai r ) = 0 in the space Rr . But now the true vector
y∗ = FC (k∗ ) is not exactly on that hyperplane, but only close to it. Hence, if we take s
repeated measurements, with s > r, the intersection of these hyperplanes should be empty.
We propose to find the best fit by solving the following least squares optimization problem:
(15)

Minimize

s
X

y · (xai 1 , . . . , xai r )

2

subject to y ∈ VC ∩ Sr−1 ,

i=1

where Sr−1 = {y ∈ Rr : y12 + y22 + · · · + yr2 = 1} denotes the unit sphere. When the variety
VC is the full ambient space Rr , this is a familiar regression problem, namely, to find the
hyperplane through the origin that best approximates s given points in Rr . Here “best”
means that the sum of the squared distances of the s points to the hyperplane is minimized.
This happens for 663 of the 951 circuits C, and in that case we can apply standard techniques.
However, for the 288 circuits C identified in Proposition 7.4, the problem is more interesting.
Here the hyperplanes under consideration are constrained to live in a proper subvariety. In
that case we need some algebraic geometry to reliably find the global optimum in (15).
Our problem is to minimize a quadratic function over the real affine variety VC ∩ Sr−1 . The
quadratic objective function is generic because the xi are sampled with noise. The intrinsic
algebraic complexity of our optimization problem was studied by Draisma et al. in [5]. That
complexity measure is the ED degree of VC ∩ Sr−1 , which is the number of solutions in Cr
to the critical equations of (15). Here, by ED degree we mean the ED degree of VC ∩ Sr−1 ,
when considered in generic coordinates. This was called the generic ED degree in [20].
We illustrate our algebraic approach by working out the first instance (11) in Proposition 7.4.
Example 7.6. Suppose we are given s noisy measurements of the concentrations x6 , x10 , x18 .
In order to find the best fit for the parameters k, we employ the circuit polynomial fC in
20

Example 7.5. We compute y ∈ R6 by solving the corresponding optimization problem (16).
This problem is to minimize a random quadratic form subject to two quadratic constraints
y2 y6 − y3 y5 = y12 + y22 + y32 + y42 + y52 + y62 − 1 = 0.

(16)

We solve this problem using the method of Lagrange multipliers. This leads to a system of
polynomial equations in y. Using saturation, we remove the singular locus of (16), which is
the circle {y ∈ R6 : y12 + y42 − 1 = y2 = y3 = y5 = y6 = 0}. The resulting ideal has precisely
40 zeros in C6 . In the language of [5, 20], the generic ED degree of the variety (16) equals 40.
8. From Algebra to Biology
The aims of this paper are: (1) to demonstrate how biology can lead to interesting questions in algebraic geometry, and (2) to apply new techniques from computational algebra
in biology. So far, our tour through (numerical) algebraic geometry, polyhedral geometry
and combinatorics has demonstrated the range of mathematical questions to explore. In
this section, we will focus on translating our analysis into applicable considerations for the
research cycle in systems biology, which is illustrated in Figure 2. In what follows we discuss
some concrete applications and results pertaining to the steps (a), (b) and (c) in Figure 2.

See Sections 5 and 6. (c) Model and data compatibility. See Sections 5 and 7.
Analysis of the Model: Before any experiments are performed, our techniques inform the
modeler of the global steady-state properties of the model. The number of real solutions to
system (1)–(2), stated in Theorem 1.1, governs the number of observable steady states. Various sampling schemes demonstrated that most parameter values lead to only one observable
steady state. We produced a set of parameter values and conserved quantities with three
real solutions, and two solutions are also attainable. If the “true” parameters k∗ and c∗
admit multiple real solutions, then multistationarity of the system is theoretically possible.
If multiple states are observed experimentally, then the model must be capable of multistationarity. In the Wnt shuttle model, the system is capable of multiple steady states; however,
based on parameter sampling, the frequency of this occurrence is low, and parameters in this
21

regime are somewhat stable under perturbation. The discriminant of the system is a polynomial of degree 34 in c, and our analysis along a single line in c-space illustrates the high
degree of complexity inherent in the full stratification of the 36-dimensional parameter space.
Experimental Design: In Section 6, the combinatorial structure of the various stoichiometric compatibility classes was fully characterized. As the conserved quantities c = (c1 , . . . , c5 )
range over all positive real values, the set of all compatible species-concentration vectors x
will take one of 19 polyhedral shapes Pc . This may find application in identifying multiple
steady state solutions for specific rate constants k. A natural choice for initial conditions
when performing experiments is on or near the vertices of the 14-dimensional polyhedron Pc .
Example 8.1. Suppose the conserved quantities vector lies in the bipyramid, e.g. c =
(1, 2, 2, 2, 3). The preimage of c in x-space is a product of the orthant R≥0 {e10 , e11 } and
a 12-dimensional polytope with 400 vertices: (1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
and 399 of its permutations. This product is the polyhedron Pc . If we have control over initial
conditions, beginning near the vertices positions us to find interesting systems behavior.
In the laboratory, the experimentalist makes choices of what to measure and what not to
measure. For instance, measuring a particular xi may be infeasible, or there may be a
situation in which measuring concentration xi can preclude measuring concentration xj .
For every strategy, we fix a cost vector, listing the costs of making each measurement. We use
the symbol N to indicate infeasible measurements. Suppose there are two different ways to
run the experiment; then we have a 2×19 cost matrix P , whose rows are cost vectors for each
experiment. We multiply P by the 0-1-incidence matrix for the 951 circuits of Proposition
5.2. That matrix has a 1 in row i and column j if circuit j contains species i, and 0 otherwise.
The product is a matrix of size 2 × 951. For N → ∞, the 2 × 951 matrix has a finite entry
in position (i, j) precisely when the strategy i can measure the circuit j. Minimizing over
those finite cost entries selects the most cost-effective experiment to measure a circuit.
Example 8.2. Suppose that none of the intermediate complexes x13 , . . . , x19 are measurable,
and that we are able to measure only one Phosphatase concentration (x4 or x8 ) in each
experimental setup. A corresponding cost matrix might look like


1 1 1 N 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 N N N N N N N
P =
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 N 1 1 1 1 N N N N N N N
Multiplying by the circuit support matrix of size 19 × 951 reveals 82 feasible experiments:
50 using the first row of P , and 32 using the second. With more refined cost assignment,
this would decide not only feasibility but also optimal cost. In this way, the matroid allows
us to choose cost-minimal experiments to obtain meaningful information for the model.
Model and data compatibility: After an experiment is performed, the task of the modeler
is to test the data with the model. One possible outcome is model rejection. If the data are
compatible, then another outcome is parameter estimation. Both may provide insights for
biology. The role of algebraic geometry is seen in [9, 10] and shown in the next two examples.
Example 8.3 (Model Rejection). Suppose that rate parameters ki are all known to be 1,
and that we have collected data for variables x1 , x4 , x14 . The circuit polynomial is k1 k3 x1 x4 +
(−k2 k4 − k2 k5 )x14 , which specializes to x1 x4 − 2x14 . If the evaluation of the positive quantity
|x1 x4 − 2x14 | lies above a threshold , then we can reject the model as not matching the data.
22

Every circuit polynomial of the matroid is a steady state invariant; depending on which
experiment was performed, the collection of measured variables must contain some circuit.
Even if one can measure all 19 species at steady state, it is not possible to recover all 31 kinetic
rate constants, but we do have relationships that must be satisfied among parameters [16].
Example 8.4 (Parameter Estimation). Suppose that rate parameters are unknown, and that
we have collected data for x6 , x10 , x18 . The corresponding circuit polynomial fC is shown in
Example 7.5. We know that the coefficients of fC satisfy the constraint y2 y6 = y3 y5 . Suppose
our experiments lead to the following ten measurements for the vector (x6 , x10 , x18 ):
{(.715335, 4.06778, 14.6806), (.390982, 4.83152, 6.08251), (.706539, 4.98107, 3.83617),
(.14316, 4.30851, 12.5809), (.995583, 4.01222, 15), (.413817, 4.08114, 14.902), (.232206, 3.38274, 23.3162),
(.219045, 5.06008, 3.67175), (.704106, 3.52804, 21.1037), (.648732, 3.6505, 19.7008)}

The data lead us to the following function to optimize in (15):
57.2345y12 + 376.181y1 y2 + 801.672y22 − 27.5625y1 y3 − 96.4429y2 y3

−144.7y2 y6 + 10.339y3 y6 − 83.8072y4 y6 − 269.749y5 y6 + 10y62
The global minimum of this quadratic form on the codimension 2 variety (16) has coordinates
y1 = 0.183472, y2 = 0.152416, y3 = 0.959232, y4 = 0.038042, y5 = 0.00335267, y6 = 0.211.
Given these values, one now has three degrees of freedom in estimating the nine parameters
ki that appear in the circuit polynomial fC . The other ten coordinates of k are unspecified.
