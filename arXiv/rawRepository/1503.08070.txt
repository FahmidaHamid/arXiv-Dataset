Abstract. We introduce the gonosomal algebra. Gonosomal algebra extend the evolution algebra of the
bisexual population (EABP) defined by Ladra and Rozikov. We show that gonosomal algebras can represent
algebraically a wide variety of sex determination systems observed in bisexual populations. We illustrate this
by about twenty genetic examples, most of these examples cannot be represented by an EABP. We give seven
algebraic constructions of gonosomal algebras, each is illustrated by genetic examples. We show that unlike the
EABP gonosomal algebras are not dibaric. We approach the existence of dibaric function and idempotent in
gonosomal algebras.

1. I NTRODUCTION
To construct an algebraic model of sex-linked inheritance (i.e. controlled by sex), it is
necessary to solve two problems: the asymmetry of the transmission of genes and the wide
variety of sex-determination systems.
In populations with separate sexes, bisexual and diploid, the sexual differentiation is
controlled in the majority of cases by a pair of chromosomes: the sex chromosomes also
called gonosomes (or heterochromosomes, or heterosomes). The gonosomes often have
different shapes (dimorphism) which induces an asymmetry in the transmission of sexlinked traits.
In the animal kingdom, sex is determined by different systems, we distinguish five systems: XY , W Z, X0, Z0 and W XY , which can be added their multiple variants.
In the XY sex-determination system observed in most mammals, homogametic XX individuals are females and heterogametic XY are males. The XY -system has multiple variants
as X1 X2Y and XY1Y2 . In the X1 X2Y -system, females are X1 X1 X2 X2 and males X1 X2Y while
in the system XY1Y2 females are XX and males XY1Y2 . Systems with more gonosomes as
X1 X2 X3 X4 X5Y or X1 X2 X3 X4 X5Y1Y2Y3Y4Y5 have also been observed.
The W Z-system is mainly found in birds, females are heterogametic W Z while males
are homogametic ZZ. This system also accepts multiple variants such that W1W2 Z, W Z1 Z2 ,
W1W2 Z1 Z2 .
The X0-system is mainly observed in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ...). In this system sex
is controlled by a single X chromosome, females have two X chromosomes, their genotype
is XX, while males have one, they are X0 (zero indicates the absence of the second X
chromosome). It has been observed in several species of spiders the following systems
X1 X2 0, X1 X2 X3 0, X1 X2 X3 0, X1 X2 X3 X4 0.
As for Z0 sex determination system mainly observed among Lepidoptera, females are
Z0 and males ZZ.
Finally, the W XY -system observed in several species of tropical fish is more complex:
an individual having a gonosome Y is male unless it is coupled with a W chromosome, so
1

in this system individuals with genotypes XY or YY are males and those of genotypes XX,
W X and WY are female.
However we shall see later in this work through numerous examples that there are many
other sex determination systems.
A gene is said sex-linked or gonosomal if it is located on the sex chromosomes. Because
to the dimorphism of gonosomes there are two kinds of gonosomal gene. Indeed, in the XY
and W Z systems two parts on gonosomes are observed: one part homologous (or pseudoautosomal) where genes are common to both gonosome types and a differential part where
a locus located on a gonosome has no counterpart on the other. There are therefore two
types of gonosomal genes: a gene is pseudo-autosomal (or partially sex-linked) if the locus
is located on the homologous parts; it is gonosomal (or completely sex-linked) when the
locus is on the differential part of the sex chromosomes (cf. [8]).
In this work, after recalling the algebraic models of sex-linked inheritance, we give
a genetic example that can not be represented by these algebras, this leads us to extend
these algebras and define the gonosomal algebras. Then we give seven algebraic constructions of gonosomal algebras and illustrating them with examples we see that these
algebras can represent algebraically a wide variety of genetic phenomena related to sex as:
i) temperature-dependent sex determination; ii) sequential hermaphrodism; iii) androgenesis; iv) parthenogenesis; v) gynogenesis; vi) bacterial conjugation vii) cytoplasmic inheritance; viii) sex-linked lethal genes; ix) multiple sex-chromosome systems; x) heredity in
the WXY-system; xi) heredity in the WZ-system with male feminization; xii) XY-system
with fertile XY-females; xiii) X-linked sex-ratio distorter; xiv) kleptogenesis; xv) genetic
processes (mutation, recombination, transposition) influenced by sex; xvi) heredity in ciliates; xvii) genomic imprinting; xviii) X-inactivation; xix) sex determination by gonosome
elimination; xx) sexual reproduction in triploid; xxi) polygenic sex determination; xxii) cytoplasmic heredity. We show that gonosomal algebras are not in general dibaric and we
give conditions for the existence of a dibaric function and an idempotent in these algebras.
2. P RELIMINARIES
There are three algebraic models for a gonosomal gene inheritance.
The first method was proposed by Etherington [4] in the case of a diallelic sex-linked
gene in the XY -system. It has been used by Gonshor in the case of a diallelic sex-linked
gene with mutation [5] and for a multiallelic sex-linked gene [6]. This model has been also
described and studied by Wörz-Busekros [14], [15] in the general case of a multiallelic
gene linked to sex in the XY-system. Starting from a basis (ai )1≤i≤n ∪ {Y } of an algebra A
equipped with the multiplication:
n

ai a j =

∑ γi jr ar ,

∑ γir ar + 2 Y,

YY = 0,

r=1

with ∑nr=1 γi jr = 1, ∑nr=1 γir = 21 for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n; where the structure constant γi jr (resp.
γir ) represents the frequency of gametic type er produced by a female (resp. male) of
genotype ai a j (resp. aiY ). Let Z be a vector space, (ai ⊗ a j , ai ⊗ Y )1≤i≤ j≤n a basis of Z
where ai ⊗ a j , ai ⊗ Y represent respectively female and male genotypes, and we define on
Z the commutative structure algebra:
1
(ai ⊗ a j ) (ak ⊗ Y ) =
∑ (γi jr γks + γi jsγkr ) ar ⊗ as + 2 ∑ γi jr ar ⊗ Y,
1≤r≤n
0≤r≤s≤n
(2.1) (ai ⊗ a j ) (a p ⊗ aq) =
(ai ⊗ Y ) (ai ⊗ Y ) =

0,
0.

The algebra Z is the zygotic algebra for sex-linked inheritance.

The second definition is due to Gonshor [5], it does not depend on a given base, it is
built from the gametic state by the sex duplication method. Starting from a baric algebra
(A, ω ), we define on the space A ⊗ A ⊕ A the structure algebra:
(2.2)

(x ⊗ y ⊕ z) x′ ⊗ y′ ⊕ z′ =
xy ⊗ z′ + x′ y′ ⊗ z ⊕ ω z′ xy + ω (z) x′ y′ .

The resulting algebra is called the sex-linked duplicate.
In [15], Wörz-Busekros showed that the Etherington and Gonshor definitions are equivalent.
Recently Ladra and Rozikov [11] introduced a more general definition. Starting from
(f)

the canonical basis (e1 , . . . , en+ν ) of Rn+ν , ei = ei , i = 1, . . . , n and ei = en+i , i =

ALGEBRA , DEFINITION AND EXAMPLES

In this section we give a definition of a sex-linked algebra that extends the one given in
[11]. This extension of the definition of [11] finds its source in the following example.
3.1. Introductory example.
Example 1. Heredity of hemophilia.
Hemophilia is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome, it is due to mutations in
two genes located at the end of the long arm of gonosome X. This is a lethal recessive
genetic disease that is lethal in the homozygous state, it follows that if X h denotes the
X chromosome carrying hemophilia, there are only two female genotypes: XX and XX h
(genotype X h X h is lethal) and two male genotypes: XY and X hY . The results of the four
kinds of crosses are:
XX × XY ֌ 21 XX, 21 XY ;
XX h × XY ֌ 41 XX, 41 XX h , 41 XY, 14 X hY ;

XX × X hY ֌ 12 XX h , 21 XY ;
XX h × X hY ֌ 13 XX h , 31 XY, 31 X hY.

Algebraically we represent this by the following commutative algebra defined on the
basis (e1 , e2 , ee1 , ee2 ) of a R-vector space:
e1 ee1 = 21 e1 + 12 ee1 ,

e2 ee1 = 14 e1 + 14 e2 + 14 ee1 + 14 ee2 ,
ei e j = 0

e1 ee2 = 21 e2 + 12 ee1 ,

e2 ee2 = 31 e2 + 13 ee1 + 13 ee2 ,
eei eej = 0,

(i, j = 1, 2) .

It is clear that this algebra is not an evolution algebra of the bisexual population as
defined in [11].

3.2. Definition of a gonosomal algebra.
The above example leads us to put the following definition.
Definition 2.	 A K-algebra A is gonosomale if there is a basis B = {ei ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ∪

eep ; 1≤p≤m of A verifying for all 1≤i, j≤n and 1≤p, q ≤ m :

The basis B is called gonosomal basis of A.
In this definition the vectors of (ei )1≤i≤n (resp. (e
e p )1≤p≤m ) are interpreted as genetic
types observed in females (resp. in males), the structure constant γipk (resp. γeipr ) represents
the female (resp. male) proportion of type ek (resp. eer ) in the progeny of a female type ei
with a male type eep .
eipr for all 1≤i≤n and 1≤p≤m,

(f)

(m)

∑nk=1 Pip,k ek = ∑m
r=1 Pip,r = 1, we find the definition of the evolution algebra of the bisexual
population given in [11].
Remark 4. A gonosomal algebra is commutative by definition. It is not in general associative, so for the algebra A of example 1 we have: e1 (e
e1 e2 ) − (e1 ee1 ) e2 = 41 (e
e1 + ee2) 6= 0.
The gonosomal algebras form a new class of non-associative algebra, indeed the algebra
A given in example1, is not Lie because e1 (e
e1 e2 ) + ee1 (e
 2 e1 )1+ e2 (e1 ee1 ) 6= 0 and taking in
(e1 + ee1 ) therefore A is not
A, x = 23 e1 + 31 ee1 and y = e1 we obtain x2 (yx) − x2 y x = 54

either Jordan, nor power associative because x x − x = − 162 (e1 + ee1 ), nor alternative
1
because we have x2 y − x (xy) = 36
(e1 + ee1 ).
3.3. Examples of gonosomal algebras.

We will show that the gonosomal algebras allows to represent algebraically a wide variety of genetic phenomena linked to sex. In these examples, unless otherwise specified, the
term genetic type represents as well alleles, genotypes or collection of genes whose loci
are on gonosomes. We start with some unusual examples.

Example 5. Temperature-dependent sex determination.
In reptiles (snakes, crocodiles, turtles, lizards) we find two types of sex determination, either a genotypic determination controlled according to the species by XY - or ZW system, either a determination depending on the incubation temperature of eggs (or TSD:
temperature-dependent sex determination). TSD is observed in all species of crocodilians and most turtles. TSD is controlled by three temperature ranges, the eggs subject to
feminizing temperatures (TF) (resp. masculinising (TM)) give rise to 100% or a majority
of females (resp. males) and those subject to transition temperatures (TRT) provide 50%
females and 50% males.
Algebraically, we consider the space A with basis (ei , eei )1≤i≤n where ei (resp. eei ) are
female (resp. male) genetic types present in a population and subject to TSD. We note τ1 ,
τ2 and τ3 the probability that eggs are incubated at TF, TM and TRT respectively, thus we
have τ1 , τ2 , τ3 ≥ 0 and τ1 + τ2 + τ3 = 1. For each r = 1, 2 (r = 1 for TF, r = 2 for TM)
er respectively the proportions of females and males arising from eggs
we note µr and µ

placed in the environment r, thus we have µr + µ
Finally, if for all 1 ≤ i, p ≤ n we denote θipk the egg proportion of ek type in the laying of a
female ei crossed with a male eep , thus ∑nk=1 θipk = 1. Then the space A equipped with the
following algebra structure:

is a gonosomal algebra and the product ei eep gives the genetic distribution of progeny of a
female ei with a male eep .

Example 6. Sequential hermaphroditism.
It is observed in many species of fish that the sex of an individual changes during his life.
We distinguish two cases of sequential hermaphroditism: protogyny and protoandry. In
protogyny (9% of fish families) individuals are first female then become male, the opposite
occurs in the protoandry (1% of fish families) when a male change sex to female. This sex
change occurs as a result of the disappearance of the dominant male or female.
This situation can be represented by a gonosomal algebra. For this we consider in
a protogynous hermaphrodite population, a gene whose types are noted e1 , . . . , en when
they are observed in females and ee1 , . . . , een in males. The progeny of a female type ei
with a male eej consists of individuals having a female phenotype. Therefore if λi jk is the
frequency of type ek in the progeny of the cross between ei with eej before sexual inversion,
then the distribution of types in offspring is ∑nk=1 λi jk ek . And if 0 < θk < 1 denotes the
rate of sexual invertion by generation of a female ek , the distribution of types becomes
ei eej = eej ei = ∑nk=1 (1 − θk ) λi jk ek + ∑nk=1 θk λi jk eek .
Example 7. Androgenesis.
Androgenesis is a rare process observed in fish, molluscs and insects. Androgenesis is
the production of an offspring containing exclusively the nuclear genome of the fathering
male via the maternal eggs. During fertilization spermatozoon penetrates the ovum which
causes the expulsion of the female genome. In some species the eggs give haploid individuals, in others chromosomes are immediately duplicated after fertilization to give diploid
individuals and in other species, there is a polyspermy that is to say, the ovum is simultaneously fertilized by several spermatozoa, in this case we obtain diploid or polyploid
individuals.
For example, in bivalves of genus Corbiculla, androgenesis is observed in four species
which are simultaneous hermaphrodite, i.e. male and female reproductive organs are mature at the same time. In these species ova are fertilized by unreduced spermatozoa, i.e.
whose genetic composition is identical to that of the somatic cells of the male transmitter.
This mode of reproduction allows the coexistence and interbreeding of individuals di-, triand tetraploid within the same species of Corbiculla.
Algebraically, let be e1 , . . . , en and ee1 , . . . , een respectively the ova and spermatozoa genetic types carried by Corbiculla. Let θi the proportion of eggs among the gametes of
an individual of type i, we define on the space A with basis (ei , eei )1≤i≤n the products
ei eej = eej ei = θ j e j + (1 − θ j ) eej , other products are zero, then the algebra A is gonosomal.

Example 8. Sex determination by thelytokous parthenogenesis or by gynogenesis.
In some species a female gamete develops an embryo without fertilization by a male
gamete, this form of asexual reproduction is called parthenogenesis. There are several
forms of parthenogenesis, one is the thelytoky. In thelytokous parthenogenesis a diploid
female gives birth only to diploid females and therefore the population consists solely of
females.

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

6

Another phenomenon related to the thelytokous parthenogenesis is gynogenesis (or
pseudogamy or merospermy) which is observed in fish, amphibians and insects. Gynogenesis requires the fertilization of the ovum by a sperm cell of a close species what activates
its development in zygote, the male genome degenerates or is eliminated, thus it is not
expressed in the offspring which consists only of females.
To represent algebraically these two situations, we consider the gonosomal R-algebra
defined on a basis (ei )1≤i≤n ∪ (e
e) by ei ee = ∑ni=1 µik ek where e1 , . . . , en symbolize female
genotypes and µik the mutation rate from type ei to type ek .
Example 9. Bacterial conjugation.
Bacterial conjugation is a transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells, a donor
(called male) to a recipient (called female), that is why bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction. It is controlled by a conjugative factor carried by a plasmid. Plasmids are double-stranded, circular DNA molecules,
present in the cytoplasm of bacteria that replicate autonomously. Plasmids are not essential
to a normal activity of bacteria but they carry genes that provide a selective advantage to
the holder (antibiotic resistance, increased pathogenicity, bacteriocins synthesis inhibiting
the growth of other bacteria, acquisition of new metabolic properties). In addition to these
genes, some plasmids carry a conjugative factor composed of several genes that control
their transfer to another bacterial cell. The most studied conjugative factor is the factor F,
it contains genes that encode the synthesis of pili allowing a bacterium F + to dock with
a bacterium F − , surface exclusion genes that prevent two bacteria F + to moor and genes
that allow the synthesis and transfer of one copy of the plasmid into a bacterium F − . At
the end of the conjugation, the factor F persists in the donor bacterium which stays F +
and a copy of the plasmid carrying this factor is acquired by the recipient bacterium which
becomes F + .
Algebraically, let a1 , . . . , an be the different types of bacterial chromosomes and b1 , . . . , bm
the plasmid types carrying a conjugative factor observed in a colony
 of 	bacteria. If we put
ei = ai and eep,q = a p ⊗ bq, then the space A with the basis {ei } ∪ eep,q and the commutative product ei e j = 0, eep,q eer,s = 0, ei eep,q = 21 eep,q + 12 eei,q is a gonosomal algebra which
models the bacterial conjugation. If 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1 denote conjugation rate, starting from two
e p,q eep,q and y = ∑i βi ei + ∑ p,q βep,qeep,q where
populations of bacteria x = ∑i αi ei + ∑ p,q α

ALGEBRAS CONSTRUCTIONS

The definition of gonosomal algebra is very general, it allows to represent a wide variety
of sex-linked inheritance situations, but the counterpart is that we can not give an intrinsic
definition similar to that of Gonshor for zygotic algebra of sex-linked inheritance.
In the following we give seven methods to construct gonosomal algebras. These constructions are obtained:
– by reduction of gonosomal algebra;
– from the duplicate of a baric algebra;
– from two baric algebras;
– from two algebra laws;
– from three linear forms and three linear maps;
– from a baric algebra and two linear maps;
– from a baric algebra and a gonosomal algebra.
We can see each construction as a particular gonosomal algebra class that can be studied
for its own interest. Each construction is illustrated by genetic examples.

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

In the following constructions we often use the the notion of baric algebra. A K-algebra
A is baric if it admits a non trivial algebra morphism ω : A → K, called weight morphism
of A, we note (A, ω ) to indicate that A is weighted by ω and for x ∈ A, the scalar ω (x)
is called the weight of x. We also use the following result (cf. [16], lemma 1.10) : a
finite-dimensional K-algebra A is baric if and only if A has a basis (e1 , . . . , en ) such that
ei e j = ∑nk=1 γi jk ek with γi jk ∈ K and ∑nk=1 γi jk = 1 (i, j = 1, . . . , n).
4.1. Construction by reduction of gonosomal algebra.
Starting from a gonosomal algebra we can construct others by reducing the gonosomal
basis. In the result below, for any integer k ≥ 1 we note [[1, k]] = {1, . . . , k}.
Proposition 10. Let A be a gonosomal K-algebra, (ei )i∈[[1,n]] ∪ (e
e p ) p∈[[1,m]] a gonosomal

that for all i ∈ [[1, n]] \ I and p ∈ [[1, m]] \ J we have σip = 1 − ∑k∈I γipk + ∑r∈J γeipr 6= 0 , then

and ei ∗ e j = eep ∗ eeq = 0 for all (i, j ∈ [[1, n]] \ I; p, q ∈ [[1, m]] \ J), is a gonosomal algebra.

Proof. This follows immediately from ∑k∈[[1,n]]\I γipk + ∑r∈[[1,m]]\J γeipr = σip .



This result is very useful to show that the transmision of a recessive lethal character can
be represented by a gonosomal algebra.

Example 11. Recessive lethal gonosomal allele in XY -system.
A gene is lethal if one of its alleles causes the death of organisms that carry them.
We study in XY -system, a gonosomal gene having two alleles a and b. We are going to
consider two cases.
Case 1. Allele b is recessive lethal to females.
In this case there is no genotype female bb. Therefore we have only four crosses:
aa × bY ֌ 12 ab, 12 aY ;
aa × aY ֌ 12 aa, 12 aY ;
ab × aY ֌ 41 aa, 14 ab, 14 aY, 41 bY ; ab × bY ֌ 13 aa, 13 aY, 31 bY.
Case 2. Allele b is lethal to males.
In this case there is no genotype male bY . There are therefore only three crosses:
aa × aY ֌ 21 aa, 12 aY ;
ab × aY ֌ 13 aa, 31 ab, 13 aY ;
bb × aY ֌ ab.
Algebraically, we consider the basic algebraA with basis (e1 , e2 , e3 , ee1 , ee2 ) defined for
i, j = 1, 2, i 6= j by
ei eei = eei ei

ei eej = eej ei

other products are zero. It is clear that A is a gonosomal algebra. Using one hand, the
correspondences e1 ↔ aa, e2 ↔ bb, e3 ↔ ab, ee1 ↔ aY , ee2 ↔ bY and taking on the other
hand in the proposition 10, I = {2}, J = Ø we recognize the case 1, with I = Ø, J = {2}
we obtain the case 2.
4.2. Construction from the duplicate of a baric algebra.
We recall that if (A, ω ) is a commutative K-algebra, the non commutative duplicate of A
is the space A ⊗ A and the commutative duplicate of A is the quotient space of A ⊗ A by the
ideal spanned by {x ⊗ y − y ⊗ x; x, y ∈ A}. They are both noted D (A) and equipped with
the algebra law: (x ⊗ y)(x′ ⊗ y′ ) = (xy) ⊗ (x′ y′ ). The surjective morphism µ : D (A) → A2 ,

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

8

x ⊗ y 7→ xy is called the Etherington morphism and the map ωD = ω ◦ µ is a weight of
D (A).
Proposition 12. Let (A, ω ) be a finite-dimensional baric commutative K-algebra and A1 ,
A2 two vector subspaces of D (A) such that A1 , A2 6= {0}, A1 , A2 * ker (ωD ), A1 ∩ A2 = {0}
and µ (A1 ) ⊗ µ (A2 ) ⊂ A1 ⊕ A2 , then the space A1 ⊕ A2 with multiplication
(x1 ⊕ x2 ) (y1 ⊕ y2 ) = µ (x1 ) ⊗ µ (y2 ) + µ (y1 ) ⊗ µ (x2 )
is a gonosomal algebra.
Proof. From A1 , A2 6= {0} and A1 , A2 * ker (ωD ) we deduce there are e1 ∈ A1 and ee1 ∈ A2
such that ωD (e1 ) = ωD (e
e1 ) = 1. Let us complete {e1 } into a basis B = (e1 , . . . , en ) of A1 ,
replacing in B each element ei such that ωD (ei ) 6= 0 by ωD (ei )−1 ei and each term ei such
that ωD (ei ) = 0 by ei + e1 , we can suppose that we have ωD (ei ) = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Analogously we complete {e
e1 } into a basis Be = (e
e1 , . . . , eem ) of A2 verifying ωD (e
e j) = 1
for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m. By A1 ∩ A2 = {0} it follows that B ∪ Be is a basis of A1 ⊕ A2 . Let us show
that A1 ⊕ A2 equipped with the product given in the statement is gonosomal for this basis.
From the multiplication definition it occurs immediately that ei e j = eei eej = 0. Then for
all ei ∈ B and eej ∈ Be we have ei eej = µ (ei ) ⊗ µ (e
e j ), but it follows from µ (ei ) ⊗ µ (e
e j) ∈
ek and with ωD (µ (ei ) ⊗ µ (e
A1 ⊕ A2 that µ (ei ) ⊗ µ (e
e j ) = ∑nk=1 αi jk ek + ∑m
e j )) =

Sex determination in the great majority of species is controlled by two genotypes (e.g.
XX or XY ). However there are cases where sex is encoded by more than two genotypes,
we are going to give several examples and see that these cases also obey the definition 2.
Example 14. Heredity in the WXY-system.
We consider a population whose sex is determined by the W XY -system, in this system
male genotypes are XY or YY and female W X, WY or XX. This situation is more complex
than other systems because here a gene can be completely gonosomal for a pair of sex chromosomes and partially gonosomal (i.e. pseudo-autosomal) for another pair. To take this
into account in an algebraic model of this system we introduce the following formalism.
Gonosomes W , X, Y are denoted respectively by Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 . Considering a gonosomal
gene, its alleles are noted a1 , . . . , aN and a0 is used to indicate that the gene is not present
on a gonosome.
For each 1 ≤ r ≤ 3 we put Ir = {1, . . . , N} if gonosome Γr carries the gene, otherwise we
(r)
put Ir = {0}. For each i ∈ Ir , the notation ai represents a gamete containing gonosome
Γr and allele ai , then for all i ∈ Ir , j ∈ Is such that r ≤ s, the genotype of an individual
(r,s)
(r) (s)
of sex Γr Γs with alleles ai on Γr and a j on Γs is denoted by ai a j . Next we note αi jk
(r,s)

(r) (s)

(resp. βi jk ) the probability that an individual of genotype ai a j produces a gamete
(r)

(s)

(r,s)

(r,s)

carrying allele ak (resp. ak ), thus we have ∑k∈Ir αi jk = ∑k∈Is βi jk = 1 and we agree

(r,s)

that αi j0 = 0 if Ir 6= {0} and α0 jk = αi0k = α00k = 0 for all k 6= 0 (similar conventions
(r,s)

are used to βi jk ), in other words if the gene locus is present on a gonosome it can not
disappear and if absent it can not appear. It follows from this that the progeny of two
(r) (s)
(u) (v)
individuals, one of genotype ai a j and the other of genotype a p aq is:
1 (r,s) (u,v) (r) (u) 1 (r,s) (u,v) (r) (v) 1 (r,s) (u,v) (s) (u) 1 (r,s) (u,v) (s) (v)

Example 15. Heredity in the WZ-system with male feminization.
By 1940, the French biologist Albert Vandel noted that some female woodlices of the
species Armadillidium vulgare generate 80% to 100% of females instead of the expected
50% and that this seems hereditary. The explanation of this phenomenon was discovered in
1973: these females with almost exclusively female descent are in reality males infected by
a bacterium which transforms them into females. This bacterium was identified in 1992, it
belongs to the genus Wolbachia, it is an endosymbiotic bacterial cell widespread in insects
which mainly transmitted from mother to offspring and changes the reproduction of its
guests either by making sterile the matings, or by killing embryos, or still by feminizing
males.
Biologically, the sex of woodlices follows the W Z-system. When a male ZZ is infected
by Wolbachia, what is denoted ZZ + w, it becomes female and can cross with a male ZZ,
and as transmission of Wolbachia does not happen 100 % there is a majority of ZZ + w
females and a minority of ZZ males. Finally, in this population three kinds of females
is observed: W Z, W Z + w, ZZ + w. For the crosses, if we note η (0.5 < η < 1) the
transmission rate of Wolbachia in the offspring, we have:
W Z × ZZ ֌ 21 W Z, 12 ZZ;
(W Z + w) × ZZ ֌ η2 (W Z + w) , η2 (ZZ + w), (1−2 η ) W Z, (1−2 η ) ZZ;
(ZZ + w) × ZZ ֌ η (ZZ + w) , (1 − η )ZZ.
Algebraically, we take a vector space A with basis (e1 , . . . , e4 ) equipped with the multiplication:
e2i = ei , (i = 1, . . . , 4)
e1 e2 = (1 − η )e1 + η e2 ,
e1 e3 = 21 e1 + 12 e3 ,
e1 e4 = e2 e3 = e2 e4 = (1−2 η ) (e1 + e3 ) + η2 (e2 + e4),
e3 e4 = 21 e3 + 12 e4 .
The algebra A is weighted by ω (ei ) = 1. We take in the proposition 12, the subspaces
A1 = R he1 ⊗ e1i and A2 = R he1 ⊗ e2, e1 ⊗ e3 , e1 ⊗ e4 i, if in the products obtained from the
proposition 12 we make the correspondences e1 ↔ Z, e2 ↔ Z +w, e3 ↔ W and e4 ↔ W +w,
we retrieve the results of crosses given in the biological model.
Example 16. Heredity in the XY -system with fertile XY females.
In rodents, cases where the XY system is atypical have been found. For example, in
Myopus schisticolor (wood lemming) and Mus minutoides (african pygmy mouse), we

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

10

described three female genotypes: XX, XX ∗ and X ∗Y . In these genotypes, notation X ∗
refers to a chromosome carrying a gene having two actions: it inactivates the action of
gonosome Y and it causes the elimination of gonosome Y during gametogenesis, so X ∗Y
females give only ova of X ∗ type. Therefore the results of crosses are:
XX × XY ֌ 21 XX, 21 XY ;
XX ∗ × XY ֌ 41 XX, 41 XX ∗ , 41 X ∗Y, 14 XY ;
X ∗Y × XY ֌ 12 XX ∗ , 21 X ∗Y.
To interpret this in algebraic terms, we define the space A with basis (e1 , e2 , e3 ) and the
multiplication:
e2i = ei , e1 ei = 21 e1 + 12 ei , e2 e3 = e2 ,

(i = 1, . . . , 3) .

Next we take in proposition 12, the subpaces A1 = R he1 ⊗ e1 , e1 ⊗ e2 , e2 ⊗ e3 i and A2 =
R he1 ⊗ e3i, then the product defined in proposition 12 and the relations e1 ↔ X, e2 ↔ X ∗ ,
e3 ↔ Y , allow to find the results of crosses.
In Dicrostonyx torquatus (Arctic lemming) three female genotypes are also described :
XX, XX ∗ and X ∗Y , but unlike the previous case, the females X ∗Y give normal male XY .
In this case the results of crosses are:
XX × XY ֌ 12 XX, 21 XY ;
XX ∗ × XY ֌ 41 XX, 41 XX ∗ , 41 X ∗Y, 14 XY ;
X ∗Y × XY ֌ 13 XX ∗ , 31 X ∗Y, 13 XY.
And in this case the algebraic model is defined from the algebra A = R he1 , e2 , e3 i where
e2i = ei , e1 ei = 12 e1 + 12 ei , e2 e3 = e2 ,

(i = 1, . . . , 3) .

Then we take in proposition 12, the subspaces A1 = R he1 ⊗ e1 , e1 ⊗ e2 , e2 ⊗ e3i and
A2 = R he1 ⊗ e3, e3 ⊗ e3 i, next we apply proposition 10 to obtain a gonosomal algebra
structure on A1 ⊕ R he1 ⊗ e3 i from which relations e1 ↔ X, e2 ↔ X ∗ , e3 ↔ Y allow to
find the results of crosses.

Example 19. X-linked sex ratio distorter.
In some species the X chromosome carries alleles referred as distorters which disrupt in
male the production of gametes carrying Y chromosome. In this case the males offspring
consists only of females. However in some species suppressors of distortion are observed
on the Y chromosome, in this case depending on the suppressor type the percentage of
females in the male offspring is between 50% (Y totally suppressor) and 100% (Y no
suppressor).
If we denote X d the X chromosome carrying an distorter allele and Y s the Y chromosome carrying a suppressor gene, there are three female genotypes XX, XX d , X d X d
and four male genotypes XY , XY s , X d Y , X d Y s and gametogenesis of these genotypes are
XY ֌ 21 X + 21 Y , XY s ֌ 12 X + 21 Y s , X d Y ֌ X d , X d Y s ֌ 2−2 θ X d + θ2 Y s where 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1
is the suppression rate of distortion. For example, the cross XX × X dY gives only XX d
females and XX × X dY s ֌ 2−2 θ XX d , θ2 XY s .
To show that this situation is depicted by a gonosomal algebra we use the correspondences X ↔ e1 , X d ↔ e2 , Y ↔ ee1 and Y s ↔ ee2 and we apply proposition 17 with A =

Example 20. Kleptogenesis.
Kleptogenesis is observed in fishes (Poeciliopsis), frogs (Pelophylax) and insects (Bacillus). These bisexual species are present in various forms that can hybridise, that is to
say cross-fertilizations is observed between two related species. During oogenesis hybrid females produce eggs that contain only the genome of one of his parents transmitted
without recombination, the genome of the other parental species being totally evacuated.
This mode of reproduction is thus characterized by a clonal transmission of the genome,
whereas the other genome is acquired by sexual reproduction.
The first observation of this phenomenon was made by L. Berger in three species of
European green frogs (genus Pelophylax): P. lessonae (LL) small, P. ridibundus (RR) large
and P. esculentus (LR ) whose size is intermediate. If frogs (LL) and (RR) are crossed,
hybrids (LR) are obtained, but if we cross a female (LR) with a male (LL) only (LR) are
obtained while the Mendel law provides 50% (LL) and 50% (LR). This result is explained
by the systematic elimination during the (LR) frogs gametogenesis of the entire genome
inherited from parents (LL).
e an algebra with basis (a1 , a2 )
Algebraically, we apply the proposition 17 by taking A = A
and multiplication ai a j = 12 (ai + a j ) weighted by ω (ai ) = 1. Let 0 < θ < 1 be the female
e → A by
proportion in the population, we define ϕ , ϕe : A ⊗ A
(
(1 − θ )ai si i = j
ϕ (ai ⊗ a j ) =
(1 − θ )a1 si (i, j) = (1, 2) , (2, 1) ,
(
θ ai si i = j
ϕe (ai ⊗ a j ) =
θ a1 si (i, j) = (1, 2) , (2, 1) .
Noting ei j = (0, ai ⊗ a j ) female genotypes and eei j = (ai ⊗ a j , 0) male genotypes, the
product defined in the proposition 17 coupled to the relations a1 ↔ R, a2 ↔ L give the
results of crosses observed in species Pelophylax.

The following three examples show that this construction is also useful to give algebraic
models of genetic processes influenced by sex.
Example 21. Recombination between two pseudo-autosomal genes.
This case was investigated for zygotic algebra in [2]. We consider two pseudo-autosomal
genes a and b in the XY system which allelic forms are a1 , . . . , an and b1 , . . . , bm , it is also
assumed that the locus of the gene a is closer to the centromere and does not occur recombination between the locus and the centromere, it follows that the alleles of a does not
change chromosome during recombination.
We note (ai b j , ak bl ) the genotype of an individual where the haplotype ai b j is transmitted by the mother and ak bl by the father. Let θ and θe respectively the recombination
rates between these two loci in females and males. During meiosis a female (ai b j , ak bl )

(a p bq , ar bs ), the distribution of spermatozoa is 1−2 θ a p bq , 1−2 θ ar bs , θ2 a p bs , θ2 ar bq where,
taking into consideration the notation, genotypes a p bq and a p bs are carried by a gonosome
X and ar bs , ar bq are on a gonosome Y . It results for example, that the frequency distribution of the eight genotypes of girls born from the cross between a female (ai b j , ak bl ) and a
male (a p bq , ar bs ) is:

Example 22. Genetic mutation with sex-dependent mutation rate in a multiple XY -system.
The inheritance of a gonosomal gene was studied for the XY system in the absence of
mutation in [4, 7, 9] and with mutation in [5]. Nevertheless it is observed in all sex determination systems, in the following it is described in the multiple XY -system for pseudoautosomal or gonosomal genes.
There are many diploid species (fish, insects, spiders) who have sex determination systems with multiple sex chromosomes. In these systems sex is determined by the XnYm
system with n ≥ 1 and m ≥ 0, that is to say a female type is X1 . . . Xn /X1 . . . Xn and a male
X1 . . . Xn /Y1 . . .Ym if m ≥ 1, or X1 . . . Xn /0 if m = 0 (Wm Zn system is symmetric).
We consider in this population, a gonosomal gene whose allelic forms are a1 , . . . , aN and
we denote by a0 the case where the locus of this gene is not observed on a gonosome. We
use the following notations, for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n (resp. 1 ≤ r ≤ m) we put Ik = {1, . . . , N}
(resp. Jr = {1, . . . , N}) if the chromosome Xk (resp.

observed on chromosome Yk , we note νk,ri the mutation rate of allele ai to allele ar on
chromosome Yk with the convention νk,0i = 0. If the gene locus is not on gonosome Xl

Example 23. Transposable elements with sex-dependent transposition rate.
Since the Barbara McClintock’s pioneering works, we know that a more or less important part of the genome (45% in humans) consists of repeated sequences that can move
along chromosomes. These sequences called transposable elements or transposons (also
known as mobile genetic elements or jumping genes). The transposon displacement is
called a transposition. According to the transposon there are two transposition modes: conservative or replicative, some transposons use both. Transposition is conservative when the
transposon moves from one site to another without being replicated. It is replicative when
one or more copies of the transposon is transferred to another site, in this case there is an
increase of the number of copies of the transposon inside the genome.
We consider a bisexual population composed of diploid individuals with chromosomic
number 2n ≥ 4. Chromosomes are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the number reserved
for the X and Y sex chromosomes. We study the copies number of a transposon into the
genome of individuals. The notation ci, j is the chromosome number i carrying j copies of
the transposon and we assume that each chromosome can carry at most N copies.
We note τk, j (resp. τek, j ) the insertion (in this case k > 0) or deletion (in this case k < 0)
probability in a female (resp. male) of k copies on a chromosome carrying j copies. Thus
we have 0 ≤ k + j ≤ N and we put τk, j = τek, j = 0 as soon as k + j < 0 or k + j > N, all this
allows to take −N ≤ k ≤ N in the definitions of τk, j and τek, j .
Let c1,i1 , . . . , cn,in the chromosomes transmitted by a parent, we note ci1 ,. . . ,in = c1,i1 ⊗

Example 25. Heredity of an autosomal gene with sex-dependent segregation and mutation.
We consider the alleles a1 , . . . , an an autosomal gene in a diploid bisexual population.
Genotypes (ai , a j ) are ordered, i.e. in (ai , a j ) allele ai is transmitted by the mother and a j
is received from the father. It is assumed that the segregation coefficients and the mutation

rates during meiosis are sex-dependent, we note ηi jk (resp. η
e pk ) the mutation rate of allele
of allele ak in a female (resp. male) (ai , a j ) and µ pk (resp. µ
ak to a p in females (resp. males). Finally it is assumed that each generation the female
rate in the population remains constant equal to θ . Then after crossing a female (ai , a j )
with a male (a p , aq ), the proportion of females (resp. males) (ak , ar ) in the offspring is
e pqr ).

frequency distributions of genetic types after crossing a female ei j = (ai ⊗ a j , 0) with a
male eei j = (0, ai ⊗ a j ).
Example 26. Reproduction in ciliates.

Ciliates (Ciliophora) are unicellular organisms. Ciliates can reproduce in two ways: by
fission (asexual reproduction) or by conjugation (called sexual reproduction). Ciliates have
two nuclei: a large nucleus (macronucleus) polyploid which is involved in the control of
metabolism and a smaller nucleus (micronucleus) diploid which is involved in reproduction.
Conjugation is a cross-fertilization process, it begins when two ciliates come together
side by side and form a cytoplasmic bridge between them, this cytoplasmic bridge ensures
the exchange of genetic material. The macronuclei degenerate while each micronucleus
undergoes two meiosis resulting in four haploid nuclei which three are destroyed, the remaining nucleus divides to produce two haploid gametic nuclei: a resident and a mobile.
The mobile nuclei are exchanged between the two conjugants, then the conjugants separate, the gametic nuclei fuse in a zygotic nucleus which divides several times, among the
nuclei obtained one becomes micronucleus and the others form a macronucleus. Finally,
after conjugation we have two genetically identical individuals.
Given a diploid ciliate species with 2n chromosomes in the micronucleus. For each 1 ≤

obtain the genotypes distribution after conjugation of two ciliates.
Proposition 27. Let A be a K-vector space equipped with two algebra laws ◦ and • to
which A is not necessarily commutative or baric. The K-space A ⊗ A is equipped with the
multiplication:
(a ⊗ b) ∗ (c ⊗ d) = (a ◦ b) ⊗ (c • d).

Example 28. Genomic imprinting (or parental imprinting)
In many diploid placental mammals, we observe a functional asymmetry for some autosomal genes according to their paternal or maternal origin, it results in the offspring
by the expression of only one allele on both. This phenomenon is called genomic (or
parental) imprinting. The genomic imprinting is submitted to the cycle: deletion, installation, maintenance. In every generation in each individual at the time of gamete formation,
all parental imprints are erased in the germ cells and when these cells become mature gametes the genes subject to imprinting are inactivated or not according to the sex of the
individual, next the imprints are transmitted by fertilization to the next generation where
they are transmitted through cell divisions throughout the life.
For example, the mutation brachyury (T ) of the mouse is known since 1927, it is a
dominant mutation that results in a shortening of the tail. One of its alleles, called
 hairpin
tail (denoted T hp ) has a strange inheritance: the cross (~, +/+) × |, T hp /+ , sign +
denoting the normal allele, gives a descent made up 50% of short-tailed mice and 50%
of normal tail, while the symmetric cross ~, T hp /+ × (|, +/+) gives only normal tail
mice. This observation which is contradictory to the Mendel laws, is explained by maternal
imprint which inactivates allele T hp and thereby silencing it, which means that the embryos
hp
hp
T hp /+ die
 in utero.
It follows that wehpcannot observe homozygote T /T , so the cross
hp
hp
T /+ × T /+ produces only T /+ and +/+ descendants.
Algebraically, we establish coding e1 ↔ +, e2 ↔ T hp , we define on the space A with
basis (e1 , e2 ) the laws ◦ and • :
e1 ◦ e1 = e1 , e2 ◦ e2 = 0, e1 ◦ e2 = e2 ◦ e1 = e1 .
e1 • e1 = e1 , e2 • e2 = 0, e1 • e2 = e2 • e1 = 21 e1 + 12 e2 .
If we note ei j = ei ⊗ e j , by applying the proposition 27 we have

and taking for G the space with basis (e11 , e12 ) weighted by ω (e11 ) = ω (e12 ) = 1, the maps
ϕ = ψ = Id and θ the female proportion by generation, we obtain an algebraic model for
the transmission of brachyury mutation.

Example 30. X-inactivation (or lyonization).
In most placental or marsupial mammals, one of the X chromosome in the female
genome is inactive: genes carried by this chromosome are not expressed throughout the
lifetime. The X-inactivation occurs upon implantation of the egg, it is random in placental
mammals and in marsupials it is always the X chromosome inherited from the father who
is inactived.
We use the proposition 29 to give an algebraic model of the X-inactivation. We consider the alleles a1 , . . . , an of a gonosomal gene, we note a1 , . . . , an (resp. a∗1 , . . . , a∗n ) when
these alleles are active (resp. silencer). Let V be the vector space with basis (ai , a∗i )1≤i≤n
o
n
and A = V + V ⊗ V . The space A1 spanned by a∗i ⊗ a j , ai ⊗ a∗j ; 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n represents
ordered female genotypes, the space A2 = V gives male genotypes. If the X chromosome
inactivation rate of maternal origin is noted by τ , we define on A1 ⊕ A2 the laws ◦ and • :

µki ) is the mutation rate of the allele ai to the allele ak in females (resp. males).

Example 31. Sex determination by elimination of sex chromosomes.
In Sciaridae sex is determined by the gonosome X: females are XX and males X0
with the peculiarity that Sciaridae males are obtained by elimination of all chromosomes
coming from the father. We note respectively Am and A p the set of autosomes coming
from the mother and father, X m and X p a gonosome X transmitted by the mother and

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

19

father. In Sciaridae after fertilization zygotes are of genotype Am A p X m X p X p , during the
formation of the somatic lineage, one gonosome X p is eliminated from the cells of the
somatic female lineages while both X p are eliminated in the somatic male lineages. In male
germline during spermatogenesis cells lose chromosomes A p and X p , the X m gonosome is
replicated, finally we obtain a Am X m X m type spermatozoa. In females, oogenesis proceeds
normally and it leads to AX type ovules.
We must add that according to the composition of female progeny two types of Sciaridae
are distinguished: digenic or monogenic. In digenic Sciaridae the progeny of a female
consists of males and females with a sex-ratio different from 1. In monogenic Sciaridae,
descendants are all of the same sex, the females are called androgenic when they produce
only males and gynogenic when they produce only females. There are also Sciaridae which
are monogenic and digenic.
Sex determination in digenic Sciaridae can be represented algebraically as follows. Let
V , G, O spaces with respective bases (a1 , . . . , an ), (g1 , . . . , gm ) and (o). We consider the
space A = V ⊗V ⊗ G ⊗ (G + O). An element ai ⊗ a j ⊗ gk ⊗ g of the basis of A, or (ai a j gk g)
in an abbreviated form, is the genotype of an adult, where ai (resp. a j ) represents autosomes coming from the mother (resp. father), gk a gonosome X transmitted by the mother
and g indicate the sex of the individual with g ∈ {g1 , . . . , gm } if female and in this case
g was transmitted by the father, or g = o if male. We apply the proposition 29 by taking
A1 = V ⊗ V ⊗ G ⊗ G, A2 = V ⊗ V ⊗ G ⊗ O equipped with multiplications:

are gynogenic while XX females are androgenic.

We are going to apply this result to to an exceptional mode of reproduction in the living
world.

Example 33. Reproduction of a triploid (Bufo baturae).
In nature triploid individuals appear from a cross between a tetraploid (4n) and a diploid
(2n) as the result of the union between a diploid (2n) and a haploid (n) gamete which gives
a triploid zygote (3n). Triploids are sterile, this is due to the mechanism of gamete formation. Indeed, during meiosis chromosomes are associated by homologous pairs before
being divided equally for each group in different gametes and this independently for each
group. As a result, in triploids for each homologous pair, a gamete receives two chromosomes and an other only one. Since the distribution of chromosomes is independent of a
homologous pair to another, the probability of having a haploid or diploid gamete in a 3n
triploid is (1/2)n−1 , for example for 3n = 33 this probability is 1/1024. In theory there exists
a possibility that two haploid or diploid gametes unite to give an euploid zygote, but the

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

21

probability of this event is very low. The triploid sterility is used in agriculture to produce
seedless fruits (banana, watermelon, grapes . . . ).
From the above we can understand the surprise of biologists discovering that the toad
Bufo baturae, who lives in the desert mountains of northern Pakistan, is triploid (3n = 33)
and reproduces. The explanation of this particularism was found in male and female gametogenesis. The B. baturae genome contains two sets of chromosomes carrying a nucleolar
organizer (nucleolus-organizing region or NOR) and one set without NOR, noted NOR−
in the following. In males, the cells at the origin of the sperm undergo at first elimination of the set of NOR− chromosomes, so we obtain diploid spermatocytes which, after a
normal meiosis with possibilities of recombination, give haploid sperm of NOR+ type. In
females, there are two kinds of ovogenesis. In one, as in males, there is at first elimination
of one genome NOR+ , followed by the duplication of the remaining chromosomes which
leads to the formation of tetraploid cells, followed by a meiosis without recombinations.
In the other, there is at first duplication of the set NOR− followed by a normal meiosis
with recombination between NOR+ chromosomes. In both cases it leads to diploid eggs
of NOR+ /NOR− type whose fusion with the sperm gives triploid zygotes containing two
sets of NOR+ and one of NOR− .
We can apply the proposition 32 to this situation. Note (ai )1≤i≤n (resp. (e

As illustrated in the following example, this construction is very useful when sex determination is polygenic that is to say that sex determination factors are distributed on several
chromosomes.

Example 35. Sex determination in Musca domestica.
In Musca domestica (2n = 12), sex determination follows the XY -system. On the Y
chromosome is a diallelic locus: M, +. The allele M determine male sex, allele + is
neutral. The female sex is determined by an allele F present on the autosome IV, allele F
is recessive compared to M. Therefore male genotypes are (M+, FF) or (MM, FF) and
female (++, FF). However in some fly populations locus M, + is also located on one of
the autosomes or even on the X chromosome, in these populations there is a mutation of
the factor F denoted by F D which is dominant compared to M, in these cases the sex is
determined by 18 genotypes including 10 for the sex female (see table below).

Algebraically, given three spaces A, B and C with respective bases (a1 , a2 ), (b1 , b2 ) and
(c1 , c2 ) and with the algebra law: xy = 21 x + 21 y, the space A ⊗ B ⊗ C is equipped with the
algebraic structure (ai ⊗ b j ⊗ ck ) (a p ⊗ bq ⊗ cr ) = (ai a p ) ⊗ (b j bq ) ⊗ (ck cr ) and the weight
function ω (ai ⊗ b j ⊗ ck ) = 1. For i, j, k ∈ {1, 2} we note e(i, j,k) = ai ⊗ b j ⊗ ck , and we put:


 e(1,1,1) ⊗ e(1,1,1) , e(1,1,1) ⊗ e(2,1,1) , e(1,1,1) ⊗ e(2,2,1) , e(1,2,1) ⊗ e(2,2,1) , 
e
⊗ e(2,1,2) , e(1,1,1) ⊗ e(2,2,2) , e(1,2,1) ⊗ e(2,2,2) , e(1,1,2) ⊗ e(2,1,2) ,

then applying the proposition 34 with ϕ , ϕe defined on A ⊗ B ⊗ C by ϕ|~ = id, ϕ|| = 0
and ϕe|~ = 0, ϕe|| = id, the algebra A ⊗ B ⊗ C is gonosomal. Using the coding a1 ↔ F,
a2 ↔ F D , b1 ↔ +, b2 ↔ M, c1 ↔ X, c2 ↔ Y , we obtain the frequency distribution of
crosses.

Example 36. Cytoplasmic heredity.
Cytoplasmic heredity is the inheritance of genes that are not carried by chromosomes
in the nucleus cells, that is why it is called as extrachromosomal or extranuclear heredity.
These genes are located on the genome of mitochondria (or chloroplasts in plants). Mitochondria are organelles present in the cytoplasm, they play a key role in the production and
energy storage in eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, they divide continuously regardless of the division of the cell that contains them, and they are distributed
randomly between the daughter cells during cell division. The mitochondrial genome mutates, this translates into a cell by a genetically heterogeneous mitochondria population and

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRA

23

during oogenesis by a heterogeneous oocyte population: some oocytes contain only one
type of mitochondria (homoplasmy) others contain several types (heteroplasmy). At the
time of the sexual reproduction, only the head of a sperm cell enters into the oocyte, it is
possible that some mitochondria of the flagellum are transferred at the same time, however
the number of mitochondria of paternal origin being very low compared to those present
in the oocyte, it is considered that the mode of transmission of the mitochondrial genome
is maternal.
Classify oocytes of a diploid sexual species in categories c1 , . . . , cn according to their
mitochondrial populations. During fertilization, the fusion of a ci type oocyte with a sperm
gives a ck type egg with a frequency νki (thus ∑nk=1 νki = 1), this egg becomes female with
a frequency σi or male in a proportion 1 − σi .
Algebraically, we apply the proposition 34 on the algebra A with basis (c1 , . . . , cn ) defined by ci c j = ci for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, weighted by ω (ci ) = 1 and the maps ϕ (ci ) = σi ∑nk=1 νki ck
and ϕe (ci ) = (1 − σi) ∑nk=1 νki ck .

Example 37. Sex determination by deuterotokous parthenogenesis.
This type of parthenogenesis is known as cyclical because it alternates a parthenogenetic
phase and a sexual phase. In this case a diploid female gives birth to diploid males or
females.
In some species of aphids (Aphidoidea), the homogametic sex female 2A-2X are divided into two types: gynoparous females only lay eggs that develop into females and
androparous females only lay eggs that develop into males. In gyniparous females a mitosis replaces meiosis and produces 2A-2X genotype eggs that develop into females carrying
A-X type oocytes. In androparous female meiosis is abnormal: one of the X chromosome
is lost, the resulting spermatocytes 2A-X give males with A-X type sperm (those of type
A-0 are eliminated). The crosses give only 2A-2X females.
Algebraically, we consider the algebra V with basis (a1 , . . . , an ), multiplication ai a j =
1
(a
i + a j ) and weight function ω (ai ) = 1. Let A = D (V ) be the (commutative or non com2
mutative) duplicate of V , we apply the proposition 34 with ϕ (x) = θ x, ϕe (x) = (1 − θ )x.
Let ei j = (ai ⊗ a j , 0) and eei j = (0, ai ⊗ a j ) we obtain:

Example 39. Crosses with distribution of autosomal types according to sexes.
In a bisexual population we consider autosomal genetic types of autosomal a1 , . . . , an
and we assume that over the generations the proportion of females in the population has
a constant constant value 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1. This frequency σ is connected to the population
sex-ratio ρ (proportion of males to females per generation), indeed we have ρ = 1−σσ thus
σ = 1+1 ρ .
Let γi jk the frequency of type ak in the progeny of two individuals of types ai and
a j . Let A be the algebra with basis (a1 , . . . , an ), the commutative law ai a j = ∑nk=1 γi jk ak ,
∑nk=1 γi jk = 1 and G the gonosomal algebra with basis ( f , m) defined by f 2 = m2 = 0 and
f m = m f = σ f +(1 − σ )m. If we apply the proposition 38 to A⊗G we find (ai ⊗ f ) (a j ⊗ m) =
σ ∑nk=1 γi jk ak ⊗ f + (1 − σ ) ∑nk=1 γi jk ak ⊗ m, therefore after the cross of types ai and a j , the
frequency of type ak in the female (resp. male) offspring is σ γi jk (resp. (1 − σ ) γi jk ).
Example 40. Transmission law of a couple of autosomal and gonosomal genes.
We consider in a bisexual population the autosomal types a1 , . . . , aN ; the female e1 , . . . , en
and male ee1 , . . . , eem gonosomal types. Let A be algebra with basis (ai )1≤i≤N with commutative law ai a j = ∑Nk=1 λi jk ak , ∑Nk=1 λi jk = 1 and G the gonosomal algebra with basis

BARICITY AND DIBARICITY OF GONOSOMAL ALGEBRAS

The notion of baric algebra (see definition in section 4) was introduced by Etherington
[3], it plays a fundamental role in the study of genetic algebras. But as zygotic algebras for
sex-linked inheritance admit bases whose elements are nilpotent this means they are not
baric. In order to remedy this, Holgate [9] introduced the notion of dibaric algebra.
Definition 41. A K-algebra A is dibaric if there is a surjective morphism χ : A → S where
S is the K-algebra with basis { f , m} such that f 2 = m2 = 0 and f m = m f = 21 ( f + m).
Remark 42. A K-algebra with basis {a, b} such that a2 = b2 = 0, ab = ba = θ a + (1 − θ )b
where θ ∈ K, θ 6= 0, 1, is isomorphic to the dibaric algebra S with basis { f , m} by a 7→
2 (1 − θ ) f and b 7→ 2θ m.
If A is a dibaric algebra then A2 is baric. There are other results concerning dibaric
algebras in [1] and [13].
Remark 43. In [11] the authors showed that the evolution algebra of the bisexual population
are dibaric. The example 1 shows that gonosomal algebras are not in general dibaric.
Indeed, let us assume that the algebra A defined in example 1 is dibaric, let χ : A → S a

GONOSOMAL ALGEBRAS

In order to study the idempotents of a gonosomal algebra we introduce the following
definition:

For x = ∑i=1 αi ei + ∑i=1 αi eei in A, the scalar µ (x) = ∑i=1 αi + ∑i=1 αi is called mass of x.

Proposition 47. For a gonosomal K-algebra admits an idempotent of mass µ 6= 0 it is
necessary that the field K contains the roots of X 2 − (µ − 1)2 + 1.

Proof. Let A be a gonosomal K-algebra with gonosomal basis (ei )1≤i≤n ∪ (e

In the particular case of a population with a dominant male where a single male involved
in reproduction, we can specify the set of idempotents. This case was studied in [10] and
[12] for evolution algebras of the bisexual population, for gonosomal algebras we have:
Proposition 48. Let A be a gonosomal algebra with gonosomal basis (ei )1≤i≤n ∪(e
