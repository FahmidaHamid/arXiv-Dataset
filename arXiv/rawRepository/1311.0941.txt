Abstract. We demonstrate a vast expansion of the theory of evolutionary stability to finite populations with mutation, connecting the theory of the stationary distribution of the
Moran process with the Lyapunov theory of evolutionary stability. We define the notion
of stationary stability for the Moran process with mutation and generalizations, as well
as a generalized notion of evolutionary stability that includes mutation called an incentive
stable state (ISS) candidate. For sufficiently large populations, extrema of the stationary
distribution are ISS candidates and we give a family of Lyapunov quantities that are locally
minimized at the stationary extrema and at ISS candidates. In various examples, including
for the Moran and Wright-Fisher processes, we show that the local maxima of the stationary
distribution capture the traditionally-defined evolutionarily stable states. The classical stability theory of the replicator dynamic is recovered in the large population limit. Finally we
include descriptions of possible extensions to populations of variable size and populations
evolving on graphs.

1. Introduction
Finite population evolutionary dynamics are of broad interest for both application and
theory [60] [46] [13] [14] [42] [21] [45] [44]; in particular, concepts of evolutionary stability
have been widely-studied [62] [59] [69] [66], and recently applied to finite populations [70]
with mutation (and weak selection) [5]. Many evolutionary dynamics, such as the replicator
equation, effectively assume infinite population sizes which allows a variety of tools from
dynamical systems to be applied. Lyapunov stability theorems are crucial tools in the study
of dynamical systems and evolutionary dynamics and there is a long history of Lyapunov
stability results in evolutionary game theory and mathematical biology [69] [7] [1] [53] [55].
Evolutionary dynamics in finite populations are commonly modeled as Markov processes,
such as the Moran and the Wright-Fisher processes [41] [40] [35] [61] [12], which are not
deterministic; in the case of the Moran process, the replicator equation can be recovered in
a large population limit [63] [64]. Such stochastic models lack Lyapunov stability theorems.
The theory of Markov processes, however, provides powerful analytic tools, notably the
stationary distribution, capturing the long-run behavior of a process. We will show that
there is an intimate connection between the stationary distributions of these processes and
the celebrated theory of evolutionary stability.
In particular, for populations of finitely many replicating types, we define a Lyapunov-like
quantity, namely a quantity that is positive-definite, decreasing toward an “equilibrium”
locally, and minimal at the equilibrium, for a large class of birth-death processes we call
the incentive process [27], including the Moran process and the Fermi process [65]. We then
show local maxima of the stationary distribution of the Markov processes are local minima
of the Lyapunov quantity for sufficiently large populations, which in turn are generalized
evolutionarily stable states. In this manner, we have effectively extended the folk theorem of
evolutionary dynamics [11] [32] to these stochastic processes, including those with mutation
(in fact we generally require some mutation for the stationary distribution to exist). Similar
yet more nuanced results hold for the Wright-Fisher process on two types. For dynamics
on populations of three types, such as the famous rock-scissors-paper dynamics, we show
that similar results hold for the Moran process, and that the stationary distribution and
Lyapunov quantity recapitulate the phase portraits of the replicator equation. Our main
results apply to populations with any finite number of types. Finally we demonstrate some
extensions to the dynamics of birth-death processes in structured populations, i.e. in the
context of evolutionary graph theory, and of populations of variable size.
The use of information-theoretic quantities such as cross entropy and relative entropy [37]
date back at least to [1] and [7]. Recently author Harper used generalizations from statistical
thermodynamics [43] to extend the well-known Lyapunov stability result for the replicator
dynamic to a large class of geometries [24], simultaneously capturing the facts that the
relative entropy is a Lyapunov function for the replicator dynamic and the Euclidean distance
is a Lyapunov function for the projection dynamic [53]. (Local versions of such results were
given first in [30] using Riemannian geometry.) Author Fryer extended the local Lyapunov
result for the relative entropy from the replicator dynamic to a class of dynamics known as
the incentive dynamics [17], which includes the logit, Fermi, and best-reply dynamics, and
introduced the concept of an incentive stable state (ISS) as a generalization of evolutionary
stability [69]. The authors results were combined and further extended to various time-scales
(including the standard discrete and continuous time-scales) in [28], yielding a vastly general
3

form of the classical Lyapunov stability theorem of [1]. Now we extend some of these results
to finite populations.
We proceed by applying a local/discrete variant of relative entropy to the study of Markov
processes and drawing inspiration from methods from statistical inference. Bayesian inference is analogous to the discrete replicator dynamic [58] and relative entropy is a commonly
used measure of convergence of an inference process. Simply stated, given a particular population state, we look at the expected next state of the system, formed by weighting the
adjacent states by the transition probabilities of moving to those states, and compare this
expected state to the current state via the standard relative entropy function (and others)
from information theory. Intuitively, a population state is stable if the expected population
state is close to current state. Indeed, we show that extrema of the stationary distribution
minimize relative entropy between the expected state and the current state for a variety
of processes. In particular we focus on the incentive process with mutation, a mapping of
Fryer’s incentive dynamic to finite populations, first introduced in [26], a generational version
called the k-fold incentive process, and the Wright-Fisher process.
We can say more, in fact. For the distance between the expected next state and the
current state, we can use any of the information-theoretic q-divergences [28], which range
from the Euclidean distance (1/2)||x − y||2 for q = 0 to the relative entropy for q = 1. The
Euclidean distance will give the best results for finite populations since it is well-defined on
the boundary of the simplex as well as the interior, and will detect stable points everywhere.
The relative entropy, however, will yield the best connection to deterministic dynamics in
the limit that N → ∞, where we recapture the classical results for the replicator equation.
The authors explored the incentive process without mutation in [27], where we investigated the fixation probabilities of the process in the absence of mutation. Together these
two approaches give a complete characterization of the behavior of the incentive process,
whether the “equilibria” of the process are the boundary fixation states or if there are interior maxima of the stationary distribution. Stationary distributions of the Moran process
and variants with mutation have been studied by Claussen and Traulsen [10] and others
e.g. [60]. We note that the incentive processes captures a similar set of processes as Sandholm’s microfoundations approach using revisions protocols [49] [51] [52].
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Incentive Proportionate Selection with Mutation. The incentive process was
briefly introduced in the appendix of [26], as a generalization of the Moran process incorporating the concept of an incentive. An incentive is a function that mediates the interaction of
the population with the fitness landscape, describing the mechanisms of many dynamics via
a functional parameter, including replicator and projection dynamics, and logit and Fermi
processes. A Fermi incentive is frequently used to avoid the general issue of dividing by
zero when computing fitness proportionate selection [67] [65]. The authors described the
fixation probabilities of the incentive process without mutation in [27]. We now describe
the incentive process with mutation, which captures a variety of existing processes, such as
those used in [10] and [60].
Let a population be composed of n types A1 , . . . An of size N with ai individuals of type Ai
so that N = a1 +· · ·+an . We will denote a population state by the tuple a = (a1 , . . . , an ) and
the population distribution by ā = a/N . Define a matrix of mutations M where 0 ≤ Mij ≤ 1
4

may be a function of the population state for our most general results, but we will typically
assume in examples that for some constant value µ, the mutation matrix takes the form
Mij = µ/(n − 1) for i 6= j and Mii = 1 − µ. Finally we assume that we have a function
ϕ(ā) = (ϕ1 (ā), . . . , ϕn (ā)) which takes the place of ai fi (a) in the Moran process. See Table 2
for a variety of example incentives. We will denote the normalized distribution derived from
the incentive function as ϕ̄.
The incentive process is a Markov process on the population states defined by the following transition probabilities, corresponding to a birth-death process where birth is incentiveproportionate with mutation and death is uniformly random. To define the adjacent population states, let iαβ be the vector that is 1 at index α, -1 at index β, and zero otherwise,
with the convention that iαα is the zero vector of length n. Every adjacent state of state a
for the incentive process is of the form a + iαβ for some 1 ≤ α, β ≤ n. At a population state
a we choose an individual of type Ai to reproduce proportionally to its incentive, allowing
for mutation of the new individual as given by the mutation probabilities. The distribution
of incentive proportionate selection probabilities is given by p(ā) = M (ā)ϕ̄(ā); explicitly, the
i-th component is
Pn
k=1 ϕk (ā)Mki
(1)
pi (ā) = P
n
k=1 ϕk (ā)
We also randomly choose an individual to be replaced, just as in the Moran process. This
yields the transition probabilities

We will mainly consider incentives that are based on fitness landscapes of the form f (ā) =
Aā for a game matrix A; some authors do not allow self-interaction and use fitness landscapes
of the form (e.g.):
a(i − 1) + b(N − i)
f1 (i) =
N −1
ci + d(N − i − 1)
f2 (i) =
N −1
for a game matrix defined by
A = ( ac db )
For our purposes the difference will have little impact. Though we primarily investigate
two one-parameter families of incentives defined in terms of a fitness landscape, we note that
the incentive need not depend on a fitness landscape or the population state at all. The
Fermi process of Traulsen et al is the q-Fermi for q = 1 [65], and q = 0 is called the logit
incentive, which is used in e.g. [3]. The q-replicator incentive has previously been studied in
the context of evolutionary game theory [24] [28] and derives from statistical-thermodynamic
and information-theoretic quantities [68]. Recently human population growth in Spain has
been shown to follow patterns of exponential growth with scale-factors q 6= 1 [29]. Other
than the best-reply incentive, which we will consider primarily as a limiting case of the qFermi, we will assume that all incentives are positive definite ϕ(k) > 0 if 0 < k < N to avoid
the restatement of trivial hypotheses in the results that follow. For the q-Fermi incentives,
5

positivity is of course guaranteed for all landscapes. This is particularly convenient for threetype dynamics since the mean-fitness can frequently be zero (for zero-sum games such as the
rock-paper-scissors game), which would cause the transition probabilities to be ill-defined.
We will also typically assume that incentives are continuous in the population distribution,
that is, that they are discretized versions of continuous functions on the probability simplex.
At first glance the introduction of incentives might seems like just an alteration of the fitness landscape. While it is true that on the interior of the probability simply many incentives
can be re-written as nonlinear fitness functions, there are significant advantages to the change
in perspective from fitness-proportionate selection to incentive proportionate-reproduction.
In particular, the authors showed in [28] that incentives ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of evolutionary stability and a substantial improvement in the ability to find
Lyapunov functions (via formal and geometric considerations) for a wide-range of evolutionary dynamics. Moreover, when dynamics interact with the boundary, such as innovative
and non-forward invariant dynamics, incentives yield a better description of evolutionary
stability. Finally, we can study how a population interacts with the same fitness landscape
by varying the incentive function and its parameters rather than the fitness landscape itself.

Figure 2. Incentives for some common dynamics. The projection incentive
[53] is simply the q-replicator with q = 0. Another way of looking at the
projection incentive on the Moran landscape is simply as a constant incentive,
since the incentive itself is a constant function in i. The logit incentive is the
q-Fermi with q = 0. For more examples see Table 1 in [16].

2.2. The Wright-Fisher Process. In contrast to the Moran process, which models a population in terms of individual birth-death events, the Wright-Fisher process is a generational
model of evolution [35] [12]. Each successive generation is formed by sampling, proportionally to incentive, the current generation. Define the Wright-Fisher Process with mutation
for evolutionary games by the following multinomial transition probabilities:
 Y
N
b
(3)
Ta =
pi (ā)bi ,
b
i
6

where pi (ā) is defined as before in Equation 1. This is a slight generalization of the basic
process as given by Imhof and Nowak to include mutation, though we will not consider
parameters for intensity of selection via the 1 − w, w linear combination approach as in [35].
In contrast to the Moran process, the Wright-Fisher process is not tri-diagonal, rather every
state is accessible from every other state, so long as the incentive-proportionate probabilities
are non-zero.
2.3. n-fold Incentive process. Since the Wright-Fisher process is a generational process,
replacing the entire population in each iteration, and the incentive process is atomic process,
they can exhibit very different behaviors. Consider the following process, which will be
referred to as the k-fold incentive process, as an intermediate between the two types of
processes. Define each step of the process as k steps of the Moran process, so that k = 1
is the Moran process, and k = N , where N is the population size, yields a generational
processes derived from the incentive process. The crucial difference is the simultaneity of
the replication events, as all occur instantaneously for the Wright-Fisher process, so the
transition probabilities for the k-fold process differ in general.
The transition probabilities of the k-fold process can be computed directly from the transition matrix of the incentive process (equation 2) by simply computing the k-th power of the
b
transition matrix. The entries of the transition matrix, T k a correspond to the probability
of moving from population state a to population state b in exactly k steps of the Moran
process.
2.4. Stationary Distributions. For a deterministic dynamic there are notions of long-term
behavior, such as an ω-limit set [31], and powerful tools such as the Lyapunov stability theorems. For Markov processes we lack any notion of deterministic behavior since the population
trajectories can only be determined probabilistically from previous states. We do, however,
have a tool that does not exist in the deterministic setting: the stationary distribution of
the Markov process. The stationary distribution is a probability distribution on the states
of the process, indicating the likelihood of finding the population in any particular state in
the long-run. It is characterized in multiple ways, of which we will use that facts that (1) the
stationary distribution s is the left eigenvector of the transition matrix with eigenvalue one,
that is s = sT , and (2) the rows of the limit T k x convergence to the stationary distribution
for any starting distribution x as k → ∞.
Stationary distributions for the Moran process in two dimensions and some recentlystudied generalizations are given in several recent works [10] [4] [60] [36] [23] [2] [71]; stationary distributions for both the Moran process and the Wright-Fisher process have been
studied in [33]; a number of formulas for various finite population processes are given in [50]
and [54]. The n = 2 solution only relies on the fact that the transition matrix is tridiagonal,
and so applies to the incentive process with mutation without modification. The components sa of the stationary distribution satisfy the detailed-balance condition sa Tab = sb Tba
(also known as the local balance condition) and such processes have a stationary distribution
given by the following formula. For any sequence of states j0 , j1 , . . . , jk ,

where sj0 can be obtained from the normalization i si = 1. This particular formulation
relies on the fact that the transitions between neighboring states are nonzero, which we
assume is valid throughout. For games with more than two types, none of the processes
described so far satisfy the detailed-balance condition in general [61], though the neutral
landscape is reversible for some choices of mutation matrix. It is, however, always the case
that the global balance conditions are satisfied:
X

which follows easily from the fact that the stationary distribution is the right eigenvector
of the transition probability matrix sT = s. Though we will not be able to give explicit
closed forms in the higher dimensional cases (in general they are not known), the global
balance equations will be sufficient for our analytic purposes. Exact analytic forms for the
stationary distribution of the Wright-Fisher process are similarly not known. Nevertheless,
from a computational perspective, for any concrete values of the various parameters of these
processes, the stationary distribution can be computed fairly efficiently for relatively large
populations.
3. Notions of Stability
Let us pursue notions of stability for these Markov processes. Intuitively, a population
state is stable if there is a reluctance of the population to move from that state. We characterize this in multiples ways. Evolutionary stability has been studied extensively and is
closely related to the concept of a Nash equilibrium, which can be loosely described as a state
in which no strategy has incentive to deviate from. In [16], Fryer defines an incentive stable
state (ISS) as a generalization of evolutionary stability, and shows that there is a generalization of the well-known Lyapunov theorem for the replicator equation. The authors ported
the notion of an incentive stable state to the incentive process in [27]. In some cases an ISS
for a particular incentive is again an ESS, such as for the best-reply incentive, and the Fermi
incentive. We will give a generalization of those definitions in this work for completeness.
From the Moran process, an analogous form for the standard equation for an interior
evolutionary stable state (ESS) for a 2x2 game can be obtained by equating the fitness
functions of the two types in the population, matching the fact that for the replicator equation
any interior rest point has equal fitness across all types [45]. This can similarly be obtained
(i+1,N −i−1)
(i−1,N −i+1)
by equating the transition probabilities T(i,N −i)
= T(i,N −i)
for the Moran process,
which also reproduces the correct form of Fryer’s ISS in equality for the incentive process,
and adds i = 0 and i = N to set of potential stable points (for the Moran process). Since we
do not (yet) have inequality in a neighborhood (as in the definition of a standard ESS) from
this derivation we will refer to such states as candidate ISS. Explicitly, we define a candidate
ISS as a population state a such that ā = p(ā). For µ = 0 and the replicator incentive, this
definition implies that fi (ā) = fj (ā) for all i and j, which is typical for an ESS. Note that
solutions of the ISS candidate equation in a finite population will often not be integral.
Although we lack a Lyapunov theory for Markov processes, it is nevertheless desirable to
have a quantity that is locally minimal at stable states and decreasing locally otherwise as
an indicator of stability. Such a function yields another method of computation of candidate
ISS without having to solve the ISS candidate equation, which might be very difficult. We
8

combine this desire with the idea that a stable state for a stochastic process should remain
close to itself by defining the expected distribution resulting from a single iteration of the
incentive process

We
P then consider distance functions such as D1 (a) = DKL (E(ā)||ā) where DKL (x, y) =
i xi log (xi /yi ) is the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, a commonly-used
measure of distance between probability distributions.
For this purpose, we define the following one-parameter distance function

This family has the property that D̂d1 < D̂d2 if d1 < d2 , which is an simple consequence of
a more general definition (see [24]), and all have the property that D̂d (x, y) = 0 iff x = y
(positive definite). We will also make use of the fact that they are all bounded above (on
our state spaces) by the χ-squared distance [56]
X (xi − yi )2

Dχ2 (x, y) =

In what follows, we will write Dd (a) for D̂d (E(ā), ā). This brings us to our first propositions. The first gives two forms for the expected distribution of the incentive, both of which
are simple algebraic consequences of the definitions given so far. For two-type populations,
the second form is, explicitly,

Proposition 2. For both the incentive process and the Wright-Fisher process, the following
are equivalent:
(1) ā = p(ā) (ISS Candidate definition)
(2) E(ā) = ā, that is, ā is a fixed point of E
(3) Dd (a) = 0 for all 0 ≤ d ≤ 1
Proof. (2) For Wright-Fisher follows from the fact that the expected value of a multinomial
distribution is just p(ā). The others follow easily from the previous proposition and Equation
1.

For the k-fold incentive process the natural notion of expected distribution E k (a) is the
k-th iterate of E as defined for the incentive process. We will not give a closed form for E k ;
the following proposition will suffice for our purposes, and is also an easy consequence of our
definitions.
Proposition 3. Let E(ā) be defined as for the incentive process. Then for the k-fold incentive
process, E k (ā) = ā if and only if E(ā) = ā.
Hence for all three processes we have that ISS candidates are equivalent to fixed points
of the expected distribution function. This definition captures the usual notion of ISS/ESS
as follows. We can write (loosely) that ā = p(ā) ≈ ϕ̄(ā)(1 − µ) + µ/(n − 1)1, where n is
the number of types in the population, so that if e.g. µ ∼ O(1/N ) or is otherwise relatively
small, we have asymptotically that ā ≈ ϕ̄(ā), i.e. a fixed point of ϕ̄ (and so a candidate for
incentive stability). For the replicator incentive, this implies that fi (ā) = fj (ā) for all i, j,
which is the case for an ESS, as above. Our results are true regardless of the form of the
mutation matrix, but the stable points need not coincide with the ISS of the incentive for
large or imbalanced mutations (which is a feature). We note that Garcia et al have found
that the form of the mutations can significantly alter to locations of stable points [22].
The stationary distribution yields our final notion of stability. We define a candidate ISS
to be an ISS if the stationary distribution at the candidate is locally maximal, and we call
such local maxima stationary stable in general. Intuitively, a stable state of the dynamic
should occur at some notion of a maximum of the stationary distribution since it indicates
the likelihood of finding the process in any particular state, in the long run, and a tendency
to remain in the state. Our main results are that in many cases, for sufficiently large
populations, local maxima and minima of the stationary distribution are ISS candidates.
We note that several authors (e.g. [4] [23] [2] [71]) have used the stationary distribution
as a solution criterion, looking at average abundance of each population type computed
by weighting the population states by the stationary distribution. While the authors of
this paper find this to be an interesting approach, we use the stationary distribution to
measure the stability of particular population states rather than as a measure on individual
types. To see how these differ, consider that for any symmetric process on two types, the
average abundance is equal for the two types [4]. For instance, the neutral landscape and
the landscape given by a = 1 = d, b = 2 = c for the replicator incentive would have both
have equal abundance for the two types and a stationary distribution with maximum at
(N/2, N/2), but so would the neutral landscape as µ → 0, in which the stationary distribution
would be locally maximal at the two fixation states (0, N ) and (N, 0) [18] and zero at the
central point. In all these cases strategy abundance gives an intuitive aspect of “equallylikely to be represented” in the long run, yet taking the average loses information about the
manner in which this representation manifests (coexistence of all types or domination by a
single type). In all cases the given states are stationary stable.
4. Main Theorem for Two-type Incentive Processes
First we show that when the stationary distribution is locally maximal or minimal, the
distance between E(ā) and ā is minimal. We require a technical lemma to prove the main
theorem that concerns continuity of incentive-proportionate replication probabilities. The
crux of the proof is essentially that from the stationary distribution we have that if (i, N − i)

is local maximum or minimum of the stationary distribution then
(i+1,N −i−1)

T(i,N −i)

(i,N −i)

= T(i+1,N −i−1) .

Note there are two directions for the path through the states in Equation 4, ending with
i → i + 1 or i → i − 1, so there is a second solution to the ISS max/min criteria as well (see
Table ). To satisfy E(ā) = ā we need
(i+1,N −i−1)

T(i,N −i)

(i−1,N −i+1)

= T(i,N −i)

.

So we need “equality” of the right-hand sides to ensure that these criterion are both satisfied,
and we can argue that this is the case for sufficiently large N by appealing to continuity.
This should not be surprising – in both cases, the population is shifting by one in the same
direction, and as N gets larger, these points are closer together since i/N ≈ (i + 1)/N for
large N .
Lemma 1. Suppose the vector of incentive proportionate selection probabilities p as defined
in Equation 1 is a continuous function of ā and let  > 0. Then for the incentive process
defined in Equation 2, there exists an integer N 0 such that for N > N 0 we have that


 (i,N −i)
(i−1,N −i+1) 
T(i+1,N −i−1) − T(i,N −i)
 < .
Proof. Since p is a continuous function of ā, so is p∗ (ā) = (1 − p(ā)) ∗ ā. Let ā+ = ā + i1,2 /2
and ā− = ā + i2,1 /2. For  > 0 we simply need to choose N large enough so that the set of
−
population states is sufficiently fine-grained enough so that |Tāā+ − Tāā | = |p∗ (ā+ ) − p∗ (ā)| <
. Continuous functions on compact spaces (the simplex) are uniformly
continuous,
so p∗
 ∗

continuous implies there is δ > 0 such that if |ā − b̄| < δ then p (ā) − p∗ (b̄) <  for all a
and b. Since |ā+ − ā| = 2/N , N > N 0 = 2/δ is sufficient.

If the incentive function is continuous as a function of ā, and the mutations are constant or
otherwise continuous as functions of a, then we have that p(ā) is also continuous, satisfying
the hypothesis of the lemma.
11

Theorem 1. For a continuous incentive and mutation matrix, there is a sufficiently large
N so that local maxima and minima of the stationary distribution of the incentive process
are local minima of the distance Dd for 0 ≤ d < 1; interior extrema are local minima of the
relative entropy D1 .
Proof. If (j, N − j) is a maximum or minimum of the stationary distribution then by the
formula for the stationary distribution (Equation 4) we must have that the last term in
the product passes through 1 so that the stationary distribution switches from increasing
to decreasing (or vice versa). By continuity there is i ∈ (j − 1, j + 1) where the ratio is
exactly equal to one by the intermediate value theorem, and so the state (i, N − i) satisfies
(i+1,N −i−1)
(i,N −i)
T(i,N −i)
= T(i+1,N −i−1) .
Let  > 0. Then by the lemma and the triangle inequality, for sufficiently large N > N 0
(scaling (i, N − i) if necessary),

and similarly at boundary states for Dd , 0 < d < 1. This shows that Dd vanishes for large N ;
at neighboring states, the difference in transitions is larger, and Dd (a) is locally minimal. 
A maximum of the stationary distribution need not occur when Ti→i is maximal, hence it
is not a good definition of stability. The converse of the theorem is not true; the Lyapunov
quantity may be minimized but fail to have a local maximum or minimum of the stationary
distribution. While we have only proven that the theorem for large N for arbitrary continuous
incentives, it may be possible to make sharper estimates based on the form of the incentive.
As we will see from the examples for dimensions greater than 2, for linear landscapes the
theorem seems to hold for almost any N with few exceptions.
For the replicator equation, it is known that there is at most one asymptotically stable
interior state for linear fitness landscapes. We have a similar result in this context as a
corollary.
Corollary 4. For two-type populations, linear fitness landscapes, the Moran process, if µ → 0
as N → ∞ then there is at most one interior stationary stable state as N → ∞.
Note that the hypothesis that µ → 0 is necessary, otherwise one can find counterexamples
with multiple interior stationary maximum for specific parameters, e.g. µ = 6/25, and game
matrix given by a = 1 = d, b = 0 = c produces a process with interior local maxima at
a/N = 2/5, 3/5.
√ In fact for this game, any µ ∈ (0, 1/4) produces two interior solutions,
a/N = 1/2 ± 1 − 4m/2, so long as N is large enough for the solutions to be more than
1/N from the boundaries. (Note that Theorem 1 still holds.)
4.1. k-fold Incentive Process. These two propositions show that the main theorem for
locally-balanced birth-death processes will apply to the k-fold incentive process for all k.
Proposition 5. The stationary distribution of a Markov process X is the same as the stationary distribution of the process X k , defined by the k-th power of the transition matrix.

Relative Entropy

Stationary Distribution

Figure 4. Demonstration of Theorem 1, for the Moran process (replicator
incentive) with game matrix given by a = 1 = d, b = 2, c = 3, population
size N = 100, µ = 1/1000, which has an ESS at approximately (33, 67).
Top: Transition probabilities Tii+1 (blue) and Tii−1 (green). Middle: Relative
entropy D(ā). Bottom: Stationary distribution.
Proof. The stationary distribution of a Markov chain can be obtained by the rows of the
matrix defined by
m
s = lim T m = lim T k ,
m→∞

m→∞

and so the stationary distributions of the k-fold incentive process are the same for all k,
given a fixed transition matrix T .

The next proposition follows easily from the fact that the k-fold incentive process has the
same stationary distribution and the definition of matrix multiplication.
Proposition 6. If a Markov process X satisfies the detailed-balance condition, so does the
process X k defined by the k-th power of the transition matrix.
Corollary 7. Theorem 1 holds for the k-fold incentive process for two-type populations.
Examples. As an illustration of how large N may need to be, we consider the q-replicator
incentive and game matrix defined by a = 1 = d, b = 2 = c. Direct substitution shows that
ā1 = 21 is a solution to the ISS candidate equation for all q and µ. (Note that for q = 1,
13

a = 0 and a = N are also solutions.) For the two stationary extrema equations, we have
1
that ā1 = 12 ± 2N
. For large N , these solutions all converge to ā = ( 21 , 21 ). Even for small
1
N , these solutions differ only by a small amount (≈ 2N
). Similarly, for the landscape given
by a = 0 = d, b = 1 = c, we can give an explicit formula for the stationary distribution for
arbitrary µ (see [26]):

2µ
N
=
N
2 + 2µ(2 − 2) j

s(0,N ) = s(N,0) =

s(j,N −j)

Since only the binomial factor depends on j, it is clear that (N/2, N/2) is the local maximum of the stationary distribution for any µ and any N ≥ 2. So we see explicitly that the
property of being stationary stable is dependent on the population size N .
Let the fitness landscape be defined by the q-replicator incentive and the game matrix
a = 2 = b, c = 1 = d (the Moran landscape with relative fitness r = 2) and let µ = 0.001
for N = 100. As shown in [27], for q 6= 1 there is an internal candidate ISS. We consider
three cases. For q = 1, there is no ISS (the transition probabilities never intersect), and
no internal local maximum of the stationary distribution. The latter is true for q = 2 as
well, but there is a state where the transitions intersect, and Dd (x) is locally minimal at this
state (x ≈ (33, 67)), which shows that a candidate ISS need not be stable in the sense of the
stationary distribution. An imbalanced mutation rate can force an internal equilibrium for
q = 2, for instance with µ12 = 0.05 and µ21 = 0.0005. For q = 0, the projection incentive,
there is a local maximum of the stationary distribution (at i = 67). It is unique and Dd (x)
is minimal.
It is possible to have multiple interior stationary stable states for the replicator incentive
with q 6= 1. For example, the following parameters give a process with two local maxima
of the stationary distribution: N = 50, µ = 0.1, q = 1.5, and the neutral fitness defined by
a = b = c = d = 1. It is also possible to have an internal local stationary maximum as well
as a boundary maximum, e.g. for N = 50, µ12 = 0.1, µ21 = 0.01, q = 0.5, fitness landscape
defined by a = 20, b = 1, c = 7, d = 10.
5. Main theorem for Globally Balanced Incentive Processes
In general, incentive processes for more than two-types need not be locally-balanced, so we
cannot use Equation 4 to establish the main theorem. In fact, it appears to rarely be the case
(the neutral landscape is an exception in some cases), though computations indicate that
in some cases, the detailed balance condition is nearly satisfied, and Equation 4 produces a
good approximation of the stationary distribution. Regardless, we now generalize Theorem 1
to globally-balanced incentive processes. The proof strategy is similar to the locally-balanced
case, using the global balance equation instead.
P
b
Any probability inflow-outflow balanced state, i.e. any state such that
a adj b Ta =
P
a
b adj a Tb , will minimize the distance between the expected next state and the current
state. We will call such states probability flow neutral. This could happen in principle at
e.g. a saddle point, but since we are mostly concerned with stationary maxima for stability
purposes, we will focus on maxima.
14

Proposition 8. For a continuous incentive and mutation matrix and sufficiently large N ,
local maxima and minima of the stationary distribution are probability flow neutral. Precisely,

Proof. We prove just the maximal case. Suppose we have local maxima a of the stationary
distribution and let  > 0. Since all the transition probabilities are continuous in the population state, so is the stationary distribution, which is therefore uniformly continuous and
bounded by M . For sufficiently large N we have that |sb /sa − 1| < /(n2 M ) for states b

We take it as given that stationary extrema occur at probability flow neutral states,
knowing that the population states may differ by a small amount. Now we show that
stationary extrema minimize the distance functions Dd . While the relative entropy (d = 1)
is only well-defined on the interior of the simplex, the same result holds when the state space
is restricted to a boundary simplex of lower dimension. This means that the relative entropy
can still detect boundary stable points of the same process on the restricted subspace, but
the other Dd do so on the full simplex.
Theorem 2. For a continuous incentive and mutation matrix on n types, there is a sufficiently large N so that probability flow neutral states of the incentive process are local minima
of the distance functions Dd for 0 ≤ d < 1; interior extrema are local minima of the relative
entropy D1 .
Proof. Since the proof is similar to the two-type case, we just sketch the proof. Let  > 0

Since the k-fold incentive process has the same stationary distribution as the k = 1 case,
and since the expected value functions agree at equilibrium via Proposition 1, we have
the next theorem as an immediate corollary. This shows in particular that the connection
between the stationary distribution and evolutionarily stable states can hold for generational
processes.
Theorem 3. Theorem 2 holds for the k-fold incentive process.
5.1. Three Type Examples. Here we give several interesting examples using I.M. Bomze’s
classification of three-type phase portraits for the replicator dynamic with linear fitness
landscape (see [6] and the additions and corrections [8]). We use the Fermi incentive for
all examples. A full list corresponding to each of the 48 phase portraits is available online
at http://people.mbi.ucla.edu/marcharper/stationary_stable/3x3/. Figure 5 gives
stationary distributions and expected distances for the following game matrices, to illustrate

In [3] (online supplement), Andrae et al give steady-state distributions for the rock-scissors-paper game in the context of entropy
production. Figure 6 contains stationary distributions for the rock-scissors-paper game; these are qualitatively similar to those in
Figure 4 of [3]. Traulsen et al consider the average drift of a relative entropy equivalent Lyapunov quantity in [65] for the Moran
process in a finite population, and find that convergence depends on the value of N . The rock-scissor-paper game for the Moran process
does not yield a detail-balanced Markov process [3], and because of the cyclic-nature of the process, the transitions are particularly
removed from detailed-balance. This is reflected in the fact that the stationary distribution can take many iterations of the transition
matrix to converge. These plots also illustrate that the stability of particular states depends significantly on the mutation rate.

Although we cannot easily plot the full stationary distribution, we can plot the two-dimensional
boundary simplices. Figure 7 gives the D0 expectation distance and the stationary distribution for
two of the four faces. Three are the same; the fourth, where a4 = 0, is distinct, and similar to the
stationary distribution in Figure 1. From inspection of the game matrix, we would predict that
(N/3, N/3, N/3) is an ISS for the distinct face. The three similar faces have boundary ISS such as
(N/2, 0, N/2). Note that the stationary distribution and D0 expected distances are computed for
the full process on the three-dimensional state space; only the two-dimensional faces are plotted.

6. The Wright-Fisher Process
The Wright-Fisher process behaves differently than the Moran process for many combinations of
parameters; see, e.g. [35]. In general, even for two-types, the Wright-Fisher process is not locally
balanced [61]. Because of the combinatorial complexity of the process, the Wright-Fisher process is
often studied via diffusion-type approximations. In some cases, these differential equations produce
a qualitatively similar result to our main theorem for the incentive process. For instance in [9],
19

the authors show that for the replicator incentive, the limiting distribution of the diffusion approximation concentrates on ESS. Combined with the fact that E(ā) is the same as for the incentive
process (Prop 1), one can reasonably expect some subset of the parameters to produce a similar
result to Theorem 1 for the Wright-Fisher process. See Figure 5 for examples.
We give an partial analog of Theorem 1 for the Wright-Fisher process. Crucially, note that
a local maximum of the stationary distribution of the Wright-Fisher process is in fact a global
maximum since every state is connected directly to every other state (assuming that that transition
probabilities are never zero), and therefore is necessarily unique.
Theorem 4. Suppose a given incentive and mutation matrix are continuous. For the WrightFisher process, suppose that the stationary distribution has a global maximum at a, is symmetric
about the maximum, and is otherwise vanishingly small (if the maximum is not central). Then for
sufficiently large N , the state a is an ISS candidate and a minimum of the distance Dd .
Proof. We only give the case for n = 2 in detail. Since the stationary distribution satisfies s = sT ,
we have that
X

si+1 − si =
sk Tki+1 − Tki ,
k

where si+1 denotes an adjacent state and by continuity for some j we must have that Tjj+1 −Tjj−1 = 0
(at the maximum since the distribution is symmetric). A bit of algebra shows that this occurs when
(N − j)p1 (j) = (j + 1)(1 − p1 (j)).
For sufficiently large N , solutions to this equation are the same as those of the ISS candidate
equation. For n > 2, looking at all the immediately adjacent states leads to pα (ā)āβ = pβ (ā)āα for
large N , which implies by summation that p(ā) = ā.

Computationally, we can compute the stationary distribution of the Wright-Fisher process for
any combination of parameters for smaller N ≈ 100 easily. Figures 8 and 8 give a variety of
computational examples, some of which suggest that a more general version of Theorem 4 holds.
Note the sensitivity to the mutation rate µ. Qualitatively, Figure 1 is similar for the Wright-Fisher
process on the interior. Figures for all 48 of the landscape in Bomze’s classification are also available

7. Extensions
7.1. Non-constant Populations. Like the Moran process, the incentive and Wright-Fisher processes keep the population at a fixed size. Here we give an example that suggests that the methods
used in this manuscript could be useful for processes with variably sized populations. We use the
process defined in [25], and note that there are other models of variable population size process
and dynamics in the literature, such as [39].
We modify the Moran process by inserting a coin-flip in each step to determine if a birth event or
death event is to take place. The probability of this intermediate step can depend on the population
state, and so can define a carrying capacity for the population. For instance, we could take an curve
that has probability one of a birth event if the population has size M = 1, is 1/2 for 1 < M < N ,
and is 0 for M = N . Clearly there are many variations on this probability, and the Moran process
is a special case, if we separate the birth and death events.
Figure 9 shows the stationary distribution (left plot) of such a process with the replicator incentive
for the fitness landscape defined by a = 1 = d and b = 2 = c and the birth probabilities described in
the previous paragraph. Now the ternary plot shows the population states (a1 , a2 ) where a1 + a2 <
N ; the rightward coordinate is the population size N . The right plot is D0 of the expected next
state from the current state, where the neighboring states now may have a total population size that
is greater or less by one. On the right hand plot, the Lyapunov quantity is minimal when a1 = a2 ,
as we might expect from the fitness landscape and the examples earlier in the paper. These minima
occur at the maxima of the stationary distribution as expected, since for a1 + a2 = M < N , we
would expect the stationary max for M fixed to be a1 = a2 = M/2. We leave a precise extension
of the main theorem to such processes as an open question.

Figure 9. Left Figure: Stationary distribution for a Moran-like process with
non-constant population size with the replicator incentive for the fitness landscape defined by a = 1 = d and b = 2 = c, maximum population size N = 40,
µ = 0.01. The coordinates are (a1 , a2 , a1 + a2 ), with
√ the population size a1 + a2
increasing to the top and right. Right Figure: D0 distance between the expected next state and the current state. As expected, minima occur along the
line a1 = a2 with a local minima of D1 at (20, 20). We have taken the root
of D1 to exaggerate the variation visually. Sigmoid (s-curve) probabilities for
the birth-death decision behave similarly.
7.2. Evolutionary Graph Theory. Many authors now study Moran-like processes for populations distributed on graphs [38] [47]. So far we have been working in a fully-connected population,
that is, a population on a complete graph in the sense that every replicator interacts with every
22

other replicator (not to be confused with the graph defined by the transitions of the Markov processes). We outline how a result analogous to Theorem 1 could hold for populations on graphs. A
birth-death process on a graph is again a Markov process, and we consider an incentive process
on two-types. Let the graph be a cycle. We argue for the stationary stability of some states over
others. Suppose that the replicators are distributed A, B, A, B, . . . about the cycle (i.e. a proper
coloring), as in Figure 10 (left). Then any reproductive event A → B or B → A will necessarily
change the state, since every vertex has adjacent neighbors of the other type. Such a state is
inherently unstable, and will have a small presence in the stationary distribution.

Figure 10. Two configurations for an incentive process on a cycle. The left
hand configuration is inherently unstable since any non-mutation replication
will alter the configuration. The right-hand configuration is much more stable.
For small mutation rates, only replication events on the interface between the
two subpopulations can alter the configuration.
Similarly, we can follow this reasoning to conclude that the most stable configurations will have
the least possible interactions between the two types. In the case of a cycle, this means that
the population is segregated into two connected subpopulations, as depicted in Figure 10 (right).
All the remains is to determine the relative sizes of the two subpopulations. Proceeding in the
spirit of Theorem 1, we look for states such that the population state’s probability of moving up
(i, N −i) → (i+1, N −i−1) is the same as the probability of moving down (i, N −i) → (i−1, N −i+1).
For very small µ, only replication events at the interface of the two subpopulations will affect the
graph state. Suppose that subpopulations are of distribution a = (i, N − i). Then we have that the
probability of increasing the size of the subpopulation of type A1 (red) is simply p1 (ā)(2/a1 )(1/2)
since we must choose an A1 individual to reproduce, it has to be one of the two on the interface
between the subpopulations, and we have to randomly chose the individual of type A2 (blue) to
be replaced. Similarly for the subpopulation of A2 individuals, and these transitions are equal
when a2 p1 (ā) = a1 p2 (ā), i.e. when the subpopulations are in the ISS proportions. We have verified
computationally that this is in fact the case for some two player games, such as a = 1 = d,
b = 2 = c and the neutral landscape for 2 ≤ N ≤ 14. Specifically, there is a particular value of
µ such that these configurations are stationary stable for each N tested (when consolidated via
cyclical symmetry). For N = 2, this value is analytically computable to be µ = 1/3, and µ ≥ 1/N
appears sufficient computationally in other cases. For larger N the number of states in the Markov
chain is too large for a direct approach.
A similar line of reasoning applies to the random graph, and so we conjecture that analogous
results should hold for the random graph and k-regular graphs (and likely others).
8. Discussion
8.1. Vanishing Mutation. Throughout, we have explicitly assumed that the mutation rates are
(at least) nonzero so as to guarantee the existence of the stationary distribution. In [19] [21] [20],
23

it is shown that as µ → 0, the stationary distribution concentrates on the boundary states for
the Moran process (and some others), and is given in terms of the fixation probabilities of the
process. These results complement those of this manuscript, connecting stationary stability with
fixation probabilities. In other words, it is trivially the case that for µ = 0, the fixation states are
stationary stable for e.g. the Moran process on linear landscapes, since they are locally maximal
for the stationary distribution. That they are ISS/ESS also depends on the incentive – this would
be true for the the Moran process (e.g. p((0, 1)) = (0, 1) in the n = 2 case) but not necessarily for
e.g. the projection incentive on the neutral landscape.
8.2. Existence of ISS Candidates. We have left the question of whether stationary stable states
or ISS candidates exist as a prerequisite for the results presented thus far. For fixed µ and other
parameters fixed, there may not be a value of N such that p(ā) = ā for an arbitrary incentive,
1
but the converse is true: µ = n−1
n , where n is the number of types, gives pi (ā) = n for all i, so
the central point of the simplex is an ISS candidate, and it is stationary stable (the process is
equivalent to the neutral landscape, which has a known stationary distribution for all n for this
mutation matrix [36]). Computationally we have observed for fixed population size, there is often a
critical value of µ that determines if there is an internal stationary maximum, which is not surprising
given that the processes often fixate when µ → 0. Hence there are may be analogs to Theorems 1
2 such that for fixed N , there exists a mutation matrix that yields a stationary maximum that is
also evolutionarily stable, or some other relationship between µ and N that achieves this.
8.3. Large Population Limit. We have shown above that the relative entropy DKL (E(ā), ā) is
locally minimal for evolutionary stable states, and so we can view Theorem 2 as a finite population
analog of the fact that DKL (x̂||x) is a Lyapunov function for the replicator dynamic when x̂ is
evolutionarily stable. Explicitly, Traulsen et al show [63] [64] [66] [48] [72] essentially that the
Moran process maps to the stochastic replicator equation with mean dynamic ẋ = T + (x) − T − (x)
(in the n = 2 case). The stable rest points of this dynamic are those that satisfy the ISS candidate
condition when we replace ā with x, and we have that the relative entropy is locally minimal at
these points. Moreover, this limiting process shows that any stable rest point of the replicator
dynamic must be a limit of stationary stable states for some sufficiently large N (the stationary
states are by definition rational and the rest point could be irrational).
What happens to the stationary distribution in the large population limit? Consider the explicit stationary distribution in Equation 7. For large N , we have that the stationary distribution
converges to a binomial distribution with p = 1/2. Scaling to the simplex [0, 1], we have that
the stationary distribution is, by the normal approximation to the binomial, a normal distribution
centered at 1/2 with variance 1/(4N ). As N → ∞, the stationary distribution becomes a delta
function centered on the ESS. Furthermore, since the replicator equation is deterministic, the expected next state is also a deterministic quantity, and naturally replaced by the ESS x̂, and so
the Lyapunov quantity becomes the function DKL (x̂||x). This is essentially why the stationary
distribution and the relative entropy capture the properties of the vector field of the replicator
equation, as in Figure 1. We highly encourage the reader to compare Figure 3 to Figure 1.4 of [65]
for a striking visualization of the relationship between a Lyapunov quantity (essentially equivalent
to the relative entropy) for the replicator dynamic and the functions Dd that we have defined in this
work. Sandholm et al also derive a number of large population limits of the stationary distribution
for similar processes [50] and [54].
The key difference between the distance functions is the natural geometry of the simplex, the
Shahshahani geometry [57], is closely associated with the relative entropy. Forward-invariance of
the replicator equation is a property acquired because of the limit N → ∞, and not true for the
Markov processes considered above. This substantially changes the character of the limits as xi → 0
since for integral population states, the process gets no closer to zero than 1/N .
24

8.4. Conclusion. We have introduced the concept of stationary stability for finite populations and
have shown that it captures the traditional notion of evolutionary stability. In the large population
limit, our results limit to the known Lyapunov theory of evolutionary stability via Traulsen et al’s
mapping of the Moran process to the replicator equation. We have demonstrated that stationary
stability works for all mutation rates and for a large class of incentives, connects with the fixation
theory of the Moran process, and likely extends to finite populations on graphs.
Crucially, we have given Lyapunov quantities that are very easy to compute as a means of
understanding the stationary distribution, which can be very difficult to study analytically, and
for which the stationary distribution can not be characterized in closed form (currently). These
quantities derive from information-theoretic distance functions ranging from the Euclidean distance
to the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence).
