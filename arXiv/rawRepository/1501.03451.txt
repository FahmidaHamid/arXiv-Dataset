Abstract
When the body gets infected by a pathogen or receives a vaccine dose, the
immune system develops pathogen-specific immunity. Induced immunity decays
in time and years after recovery/vaccination the host might become susceptible
again. Exposure to the pathogen in the environment boosts the immune system
thus prolonging the duration of the protection. Such an interplay of within host
and population level dynamics poses significant challenges in rigorous mathematical modeling of immuno-epidemiology. The aim of this paper is twofold.
First, we provide an overview of existing models for waning of disease/vaccineinduced immunity and immune system boosting. Then a new modeling approach
is proposed for SIRVS dynamics, monitoring the immune status of individuals
and including both waning immunity and immune system boosting. We show
that some previous models can be considered as special cases or approximations
of our framework.

Introduction

Models of SIRS type are a traditional topic in mathematical epidemiology. Classical approaches present a population divided into susceptibles (S), infectives (I) and
recovered (R), and consider interactions and transitions among these compartments
[9]. Susceptibles are those hosts who either did not contract the disease in the past or
lost immunity against the disease-causing pathogen. When a susceptible host gets in
contact with an infective one, the pathogen can be transmitted from the infective to
the susceptible and with a certain probability the susceptible host becomes infective
himself. After pathogen clearance the infective host recovers and becomes immune for

some time, afterward he possibly becomes susceptible again (in certain cases one can
talk of life-long immunity). The model can be extended by adding vaccination. Vaccinees (V) are protected from infection for some time, usually shorter than naturally
infected hosts.
From the in-host point of view, immunity to a pathogen is the result of either active
or passive immunization. The latter is a transient protection due to the transmission
of antibodies from the mother to the fetus through the placenta. The newborn is thus
immune for several months after birth [26]. Active immunization is either induced by
natural infection or can be achieved by vaccine administration [35, 15].
Let us first consider the case of natural infection. A susceptible host, also called
naive host, has a very low level of specific immune cells for a pathogen (mostly a
virus or a bacterium). The first response to a pathogen is nonspecific, as the innate
immune system cannot recognize the physical structure of the pathogen. The innate
immune response slows down the initial growth of the pathogen, while the adaptive
(pathogen-specific) immune response is activated. Clonal expansion of specific immune
cells (mostly antibodies or CTL cells) and pathogen clearance follow. The population
of pathogen-specific immune cells is maintained for long time at a level that is much
higher than in a naive host. These are the so-called memory cells and are activated
in case of secondary infection (see Figure 1, adapted from [6].). Memory cells rapidly
activate the immune response and the host mostly shows mild or no symptoms [2].
Each exposure to the pathogen might have a boosting effect on the population of
specific memory cells. Indeed, the immune system reacts to a new exposure as it did
during primary infection, thus yielding an increased level of memory cells. Though
persisting for long time after pathogen clearance, the memory cell population slowly
decays and in the long run the host might lose his pathogen-specific immunity [37].
Vaccine-induced immunity works in a similar way as immunity induced by the
natural infection. Agents contained in vaccines resemble, in a weaker form, the diseasecausing pathogen and force a specific immune reaction without leading to the disease.
If the vaccine is successful, the host is immunized for some time. Vaccinees experience
immune system boosting and waning immunity, just as hosts recovered from natural
infection do. In general, however, disease-induced immunity induces a much longer
lasting protection than vaccine-induced immunity does [35].
Waning immunity might be one of the factors which cause, also in highly developed
regions, recurrent outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles, chickenpox and
pertussis. On the other side, immune system boosting due to contact with infectives
prolongs the protection duration. In a highly vaccinated population there are a lot of
individuals with vaccine-induced immunity and few infection cases, as well as many
individuals with low level of immunity. In other words, if a high portion of the population gets the vaccine, there are very few chances for exposure to the pathogen and
consequently for immune system boosting in protected individuals.
In order to understand the role played by waning immunity and immune system
boosting in epidemic outbreaks, in the recent past several mathematical models were
proposed. Few of these models describe only in-host processes during and after the
infection [37, 16]. Many more models, formulated in terms of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), consider the problem only at population level, defining compart2

primary infection (respectively, vaccination) occurred, the adaptive immune system

clearance, specific immune cells (memory cells) are maintained for years at a level that
is much higher than in a naive host. Memory cells are activated in case of secondary
infection.
ments for individuals with different levels of immunity and introducing transitions
between these compartments [10, 17]. Vaccinated hosts or newborns with passive immunity are often included in the model equations and waning of vaccine-induced or
passive immunity are observed [33, 31, 11, 3, 22, 5, 30].
To describe the sole waning immunity process, authors have sometimes chosen delay
differential equation (DDE) models with constant or distributed delays [21, 36, 8, 7, 38].
The delay represents the average duration of the disease-induced immunity. However,
neither a constant nor a distributed delay allows for the description of immune system
boosting.
Models which include partial differential equations (PDEs) mostly describe an agestructured population [27, 20, 33] and consider pathogen transmission among the different age groups (newborns, children, pupils, adults, . . . ). Rare examples suggest a
physiologically structured approach with populations structured by the level of immunity, coupling within-host and between-hosts dynamics [25, 6].
The goal of the present book chapter is twofold. On the one side, we found necessary to provide a comprehensive overview of previously published models for waning
of disease/vaccine-induced immunity and immune system boosting (Sect. 2). On
the other side, in Sect. 3 we propose a new modeling framework for SIRVS dynamics,
monitoring the immune status of individuals and including both waning immunity and
immune system boosting.

Mathematical models for waning immunity and
immune system boosting

In the following we provide an overview on previous mathematical models for waning
immunity and immune system boosting. We shall classify these models according to
their mathematical structure (systems of ODEs, PDEs or DDEs).

2.1

Systems of ODEs

Mossong and coauthors were among the first to suggest the inclusion of individuals
with waning immunity in classical SIRS systems [31]. Motivated by the observation
that measles epidemics can occur even in highly vaccinated populations, the authors
set up a model to study the waning of vaccine-induced immunity and failure of seroconversion as possible causes for recurrent outbreaks. Their compartmental model
includes hosts with the so-called “vaccine-modified measles infection” (VMMI) which
can occur in people with some degree of passive immunity to the virus, including those
previously vaccinated. Assuming that not all vaccinees are protected from developing
VMMI, the authors classify vaccinees into three groups: immediately susceptible to
VMMI (weak response), temporarily protected who become susceptible to VMMI due
to waning of vaccine-induced immunity (intermediate response), and permanently protected from VMMI (strong response). Infection occurs due to contact with infectious
individuals (both regular measles infection and VMMI). The resulting compartmental
model includes waning of vaccine-induced immunity but not of disease-induced immunity, nor immune system boosting. Similar to McLean and Blower [28], Mossong et al.
define a parameter φ to describe the impact of the vaccine: if φ < 1, then vaccine
failure is possible. Analytical results in [31] show that the main effect of VMMI is to
increase the overall reproduction number of the infection.
Inspired by Mossong’s work, in 2003-2004 Glass, Grenfell and coauthors [14, 13, 12]
proposed modifications and extensions of the system in [31]. The basic model is similar
to the ODE system in [31], with a group of subclinical cases which carry the pathogen
without showing symptoms [11]. In addition, the distribution of antibody levels in
immune hosts (included in the ODEs coefficients) and immune system boosting are
introduced: the average antibody level in an immune host increases due to contact
with infective or subclinical hosts. This model was used to fit measles data in England [12]. In [13] the basic model was extended to consider measles transmission in a
meta-population with N patches.
Immune system boosting in vaccinees was further studied in [3]. In this work two
models are introduced. In the first one vaccinees are separated from non-vaccinated
hosts. Both groups of individuals are classified into susceptible, infective and immune,
but in contrast to the models in [14, 13, 12, 31], there is no compartment for subclinical
cases. Non-vaccinated hosts do not undergo immune system boosting. For vaccinated
hosts the authors include a so called “self-boosting” of vaccine, so that contact with
infectives moves susceptible vaccinees to the immune vaccinated compartment. The
second model extends the first one with a new compartment for hosts with waning
immunity (W). These can receive immune system boosting due to contact with infectives or move back to the susceptible compartment due to immunity loss. Numerical
4

simulations show possible sustained oscillations. The SIRWS system was partially analyzed by Dafilis et al. [10].
Heffernan and Keeling [16] proposed an in-host model to understand the behavior
of the immune system during and after an infection. Activation of immune system effectors and production of memory cells depend on the virus load. When not stimulated
by the virus, the number of activated cells decays (waning immunity). Vaccination is
simulated by changing the initial conditions for the virus load. Numerical simulations
show that the number of infected immune system cells in a vaccinated patient reaches
approximately half of what is reached in a patient who undergoes natural infection.
In turn, the level of immunity gained after one dose of vaccine is the same as the level
observed in a measles patient 4 years after natural infection. The in-host model in
[16] was extended by the same authors to a population model (SEIRS) with waning
immunity and immune system boosting [17]. In contrast to classical SEIRS models,
the class R refers here to individuals protected by short-term immune memory, while
the class S refers to those individuals who have lost this short-term protection and may
experience immune system boosting. Each compartment is classified according to the
level of immunity, which can be related to the number of memory cells. Newborns
are recruited into the susceptible class S0 (lowest level of immunity). During exposure
and infection the host does not change his level of immunity, that is, transition occurs
from Sj to Ej to Ij for each j ∈ N. Hosts in S and R experience waning immunity
and transit from Sj to Sj−1 (respectively from Rj to Rj−1 ). Immune system boosting
is due to recovery from infection and is incorporated into the equations with transition terms from Ij to Rk , with k ≥ j. The resulting large system of ODEs, with a
very high number of parameters, is quite hard to approach from an analytical point of
view, hence the authors make use of numerical simulations to investigate the long term
behavior. A somehow simplified version of the ODE system in [17] was proposed by
Reluga et al. in [32]. A similar large system of ODEs was introduced by Lavine et al.
[22], extending the SIRWS model in [31, 11], by including several levels of immunity
for immune hosts (R) and hosts with waning immunity (W), as well as age classes
for all compartments. The authors claim that the model can explain several observed
features of pertussis in US, in particular a shift in the age-specific incidence and the
re-emergence of the disease in a highly vaccinated population.

2.2

System of DDEs

Delay models with constant or distributed delay have been introduced to describe
waning of disease-induced or vaccine-induced immunity. A simple SIRS system with
constant delay is given by
Ṡ(t) = µ(1 − S(t)) − φS(t)f (I(t)) + γI(t − τ )e−µτ
˙ = φS(t)f (I(t)) − (µ + γ)I(t)
I(t)
−µτ

Ṙ(t) = γI(t) − µR(t) − γI(t − τ )e

.

This model was studied by Kyrychko and Blyuss [21], who provided results on existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of solutions, linear and global stability of the
disease-free equilibrium, as well as global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium.
5

A special case of (1) was considered some years later by Taylor and Carr [36]. An
extension of system (1) with distributed delay was proposed in [8] and shortly after in
[7].
A more general model with distributed delay and vaccination was proposed by
Arino et al. in [4]. Their system includes three compartments (susceptible, infective
and vaccinated hosts) in a population which remains constant in time. Vaccine-induced
immunity might be only partial, resulting in vaccinated individuals becoming infective. Systems of ODEs or DDEs can be obtained from the general model by a proper
choice of the kernel (see also [19, 18]).
Recently, Yuan and Bélair proposed a SEIRS model with integro-differential equations which resembles the systems in [4, 19]. The probability that an individual stays
in the exposed class (E) for t units of time is P (t), hence,
Z t
S(u)I(u) −b(t−u)
E(t) =
β
e
P (t − u) du.
N
0
Similarly, Q(t) is the probability that an individual is immune t units of time after
recovery, thus
Z t
R(t) =
γI(u)e−b(t−u) Q(t − u) du.
0

For a certain choice of the probabilities P and Q, the problem can be reduced to a
system with one or two constant delays. The authors show existence of an endemic
equilibrium and boundedness of solutions in a positive simplex. For the system with
one constant delay, results for existence of a global attractor as well as the proof of
persistence of the disease in case R0 > 1 are provided.

2.3

Systems of PDEs

Structured populations in the context of waning immunity and immune system boosting have been motivated in different ways. Often the structure can be found in the
biological age [27, 26, 20, 33], and is used to observe disease transmission among babies, children, adults and seniors. Only few works suggest models for physiologically
structured populations [25, 6].
McLean and Anderson [27, 26] proposed a model for measles transmission which includes a compartment for babies protected by maternal antibodies. Indeed, mothers
who have had measles or have been vaccinated transfer measles immunity to the baby
through the placenta. For several months after birth (ca. 2 months if the mother
was vaccinated, ca. 4 months if she had the disease [26]) the baby is still protected
by maternal antibodies and should not be vaccinated. The model by McLean and
Anderson [27] considers only waning of maternally induced immunity in the context of
measles infection. Few years before McLean, Katzmann and Dietz [20] proposed a bit
more general model, which includes also waning of vaccine-induced immunity. In both
cases, the age structure was used to determine the optimal age for vaccination. A compartment for adult hosts with waning immunity who can also receive immune system
boosting was introduced only years later by Rouderfer et al. [33]. A further deterministic system of ODEs for maternally induced immunity in measles was proposed in [29].

6

Different is the approach when physiologically structured populations are considered.
Martcheva and Pilyugin [25] suggest an SIRS model in which infective and recovered
hosts are structured by their immune status. In infective hosts the immune status
increases over the course of infection, while in recovered hosts the immune status decays at some non-constant rate. When the immune status has reached a critical level,
recovered hosts transit from the immune to the susceptible compartment.
A general framework for SIRS systems, modeling waning immunity and immune
system boosting, and combining the in-host perspective with the population dynamics,
was proposed in [6].

A general modeling framework

In this section we extend the model in [6] to include vaccine-induced immunity. As in
[25, 6], we couple the in-host with the between-hosts dynamics, focusing on the effects
of waning immunity and immune system boosting on the population dynamics. In
contrast to the models proposed in [17, 22], we shall maintain the number of equations
as low as possible. The resulting model (V1) is a system of ODEs coupled with two
PDEs. The ODE systems in [31, 11, 3, 5, 30], as well as extensions of the DDEs
systems in [36, 38], can be recovered from our modeling framework.
Setting up our model we do not restrict ourselves to a particular pathogen. The
model (V1) can be adapted to several epidemic outbreaks (e.g. measles, chickenpox,
rubella, pertussis) by ad-hoc estimating coefficients from available experimental data
[24, 1, 23].

3.1.1

Model ingredients
Originally susceptible and infectives hosts

Let S(t) denote the total population of originally susceptible hosts. These are susceptible individuals which have neither received vaccination nor have been infected
before. Newborns enter the susceptible population at rate b(N), dependent on the total population size N. For simplicity we assume that the natural death rate d > 0 does
not depend on N. Assume that b : [0, ∞) → [0, b+ ], N 7→ b(N), with 0 < b+ < ∞,
is a nonnegative function, with b(0) = 0. Finally, assume that in absence of diseaseinduced death there exists an equilibrium N ∗ such that b(N ∗ ) = d N ∗ .
Let I(t) denote the total infective population at time t. Infection of susceptible
individuals occurs by contact, at rate βI/N. Infected hosts recover at rate γ > 0.
When we include disease-induced death at rate dI > 0, the equilibrium N ∗ satisfies
b(N ∗ ) = d N ∗ + dI I ∗ .
3.1.2

Immune individuals

Let us denote by r(t, z) the density of recovered individuals with disease-induced immunity level z ∈ [zmin , zmax ] at time t. The total population of recovered hosts is given

7

by
R(t) =

Z

zmax

r(t, z) dz.
zmin

The parameter z describes the immune status and can be related to the number of
specific immune cells of the host. The value zmax corresponds to maximal immunity,
whereas zmin corresponds to low level of immunity. Individuals who recover at time
t enter the immune compartment with maximal level of immunity zmax . The level
of immunity tends to decay in time and when it reaches the minimal value zmin , the
host becomes susceptible again. However, exposure to the pathogen can boost the
immune system from z ∈ [zmin , zmax ] to any higher status. It is not straightforward
to determine how this kind of immune system boosting works, as no experimental
data are available. Nevertheless, laboratory analysis on vaccines tested on animals
or humans suggest that the boosting efficacy might depend on several factors, among
which the current immune status of the recovered host and the amount of pathogen
he receives [1, 24]. Possibly, exposure to the pathogen can restore the maximal level
of immunity, just as natural infection does [6].
Let p(z, z̃), z ≥ z̃, z, z̃ ∈ R denote the probability that an individual with immunity
level z̃ moves to immunity level z, when exposed to the pathogen. Due to the definition
of p(z, z̃), we have p(z, z̃) ∈ [0, 1], z ≥ z̃ and
p(z, z̃) = 0,

for all z < z̃.

As we effectively consider only immunity levels in the interval [zmin , zmax ], we set
p(z, z̃) = 0,
Then we have
Z ∞

p(z, z̃) dz =

for all z̃ ∈ (−∞, zmin ) ∪ (zmax , ∞).

Z

zmax

p(z, z̃) dz = 1,

for all z̃ ∈ [zmin , zmax ].

z̃

Exposure to the pathogen might restore exactly the immunity level induced by the
disease (zmax ). In order to capture this particular aspect of immune system boosting,
we write the probability p(z, z̃) as the combination of a continuous (p0 ) and atomic
measures (Dirac delta):
p(z, z̃) = cmax (z̃)δ(zmax − z̃) + c0 (z̃)p0 (z, z̃) + c1 (z̃)δ(z − z̃),
where
• cmax : [zmin , zmax ] → [0, 1], y 7→ cmax (y), is a continuously differentiable function
and describes the probability that, due to contact with infectives, a host with
immunity level y boosts to the maximal level of immunity zmax .
• c0 : [zmin , zmax ] → [0, 1], y 7→ c0 (y), is a continuously differentiable function and
describes the probability that, due to contact with infectives, a host with immunity level y boosts to any other level z ∈ (y, zmax ), according to the continuous
probability p0 (z, y).
• c1 (y) = 1 − cmax (y) − c0 (y) describes the probability that getting in contact with
infectives, the host with immunity level y ∈ [zmin , zmax ] does not experience
immune system boosting.
8

The immunity level decays in time at some rate g(z) which is the same for all
recovered individuals with immunity level z. In other words, the immunity level z
follows
d
z(t) = g(z),
dt
with g : [zmin , zmax ] → (0, Kg ], Kg < ∞ continuously differentiable. The positivity
of g(z) is required from the biological motivation. Indeed, if g(z̃) = 0 for some value
z̃ ∈ [zmin , zmax ], there would be no change of the immunity level at z̃, contradicting the
hypothesis of natural decay of immune status. In absence of immune system boosting,
we have that
Z zmax
1
dx
zmin g(x)
is the time a recovered host remains immune (see [6]).
3.1.3

Vaccination

We structure the vaccinated population by the level of immunity as well. Let v(t, z)
be the density of vaccinees with immunity level z ∈ [zmin , zmax ] at time t. The total
population of vaccinated hosts is given by
Z zmax
v(t, z) dz.
V (t) =
zmin

Vaccination infers a level of immunity zvax , which is lower than the level of immunity
after natural infection: zmax > zvax > zmin [35]. As in recovered individuals, the
level of immunity of a vaccinated host tends to decay in time and when it reaches the
minimal value zmin , the host becomes susceptible again. However, also in vaccinated
hosts, exposure to the pathogen can boost the immunity level z ∈ [zmin , zvax ] to any
higher value in [zmin , zmax ]. Immune system boosting is described by the probability
p(z, z̃), as in recovered hosts. We consider the possibility that exposure to the pathogen
boosts the immune system of a vaccinated individual to z ∈ (zvax , zmax ]. Vaccinated
hosts with z ∈ (zvax , zmax ] have an immune status which can be compared to the one
of hosts who recovered from natural infection.
It is reasonable to assume that in vaccinated individuals the immunity level decays
in time at the same rate g, as in hosts who underwent natural infection. In absence
of exposure to the pathogen (hence in absence of immune system boosting), the time
that a vaccinee remains immune is shorter than the time a recovered host does:
Z zmax
Z zvax
1
1
dx <
dx.
zmin g(x)
zmin g(x)
Let us define the vaccination rate at birth α > 0. We assume that originally susceptible
(adult) individuals get vaccinated at rate φ ≥ 0.
3.1.4

Becoming susceptible again

In absence of immune system boosting both disease-induced and vaccine-induced immunity fade away. Individuals who lose immunity either after recovery from infection
or after vaccination, enter the class S2 of susceptible individuals who shall not get a
9

new dose of vaccine. A host who had the disease or got vaccination relies indeed on
the induced-immunity and is not aware of the fact that his level of immunity might
have dropped below the critical immunity threshold.
We denote by S2 (t) the population at time t of susceptible hosts who are not going to receive vaccination.

3.2

Model equations

In view of all what we have mentioned above, we can easily write down the equations
for the compartments S, I and S2 . Let initial values S(0) = S 0 ≥ 0, I(0) = I 0 ≥ 0
and S2 (0) = S20 ≥ 0 be given. The population of originally susceptible individuals is
governed by

To obtain an equation for the recovered individuals, structured by their levels of immunity, one can proceed similarly to size structured models or as it was done for the
immune population in [6]. The result is the following PDE. Let a nonnegative initial
distribution r(0, z) = ψ(z), z ∈ [zmin , zmax ] be given. For t > 0, z ∈ [zmin , zmax ] we
have

Equation (4) expresses the rate of change in the density of recovered individuals according to immune level due to natural waning, mortality, and boosting. The boundary
condition (5) includes newly recovered individuals as well as those recovered individuals, who just received a boost which elevated their immune system to maximal level.
Next we shall consider the vaccinated population. Again, by structuring this group
according to immunity level, one has the PDE

at the lower value zvax , which is expressed in equation (6) as an impulse at z = zvax
by the term with the Dirac delta δ(z − zvax ).
It becomes evident that the quantity ΛR , initially introduced in the S2 equation
to represent the number of hosts who experienced immunity loss, is given by the
number g(zmin )r(t, zmin ) of immune hosts who reached the minimal level of immunity
after recovery from natural infection. Similarly, ΛV is the number g(zmin )v(t, zmin ) of
vaccinated hosts who reached the minimal level of immunity. Hence we have

In the following we refer to the complete system (2) – (8) as to model (V1).

Connection to other mathematical models
Connection to ODE models

As it was shown in [6] for a simpler problem, model (V1) can be reduced to a system
of ODEs analogous to those proposed in [31, 11, 3, 22, 17, 30]. The connection between model (V1) and the ODE system is given by the method of lines, a technique in
which all but one dimensions are discretized [34]. In our case, we shall discretize the
immunity level (z) and obtain a system of ODEs in the time variable.
Let us define a sequence {zj }j∈N , with hj := zj+1 − zj > 0, for all j ∈ N. To
keep the demonstration as simple as possible, we choose a grid with only a few points,
z1 := zmin < zW := zvax < zF < zmax and for simplicity (or possibly after a rescaling) assume that hj = 1 for all j. We define the following subclasses of the immune/vaccinated population:

11

• RF (t) := r(t, zF ), immune hosts with high level of immunity at time t. As their
immunity level is quite high, these individuals do not experience immune system
boosting. Immunity level decays at rate µ := g(zF ) > 0.
• RW (t) := r(t, zW ), immune hosts with intermediate level of immunity at time t.
These individuals can get immune system boosting and move to RF . Immunity
level decays at rate ν := g(zW ) > 0.
• RC (t) := r(t, zmin ), immune hosts with critically low level of immunity at time
t. With probability θ boosting moves RC individuals to RW (respectively, with
probability (1 − θ) to RF ). Immunity level decays at rate σ := g(zmin ) > 0.
If they do not get immune system boosting, these hosts move to the class S2
(become susceptible again).
• VR (t) := v(t, zF ), vaccinated hosts who thanks to immune system boosting
gained a very high level of immunity at time t. These individuals do not experience immune system boosting. Immunity level decays at rate µ.
• V0 (t) := v(t, zW ), vaccinated individuals at time t with maximal vaccine-induced
immunity. This class includes new vaccinees. If their immune system gets
boosted hosts move to VR . Immunity level decays at rate ν.
• VC (t) := v(t, zmin ), vaccinees with critically low level of immunity at time t.
With probability ξ boosting moves VC hosts to V0 and with probability (1 − ξ)
to VR . Immunity level decays at rate σ. If they do not receive immune system
boosting, VC hosts move to S2 .
To show how the PDE system can be reduced to a system of ODEs by means of the
method of lines, we consider a simple example. Let us neglect immune system boosting
for a moment. Then the PDE for r(t, z) in model (V1) becomes

∂
∂
g(z)r(t, z) − dr(t, z),
r(t, z) =
∂t
∂z

z ∈ [zmin , zmax ],

(9)

with boundary condition Rzmax (t) := r(t, zmax ) = γI(t)/g(zmax ). Using forward approximation for the z-derivative in (9), we obtain, e.g., for RF (t) the following differential equation:
∂
r(t, zF )
∂t

∂
g(zF )r(t, zF ) − dr(t, zF )

∂z
g(zmax )r(t, zmax ) − g(zF )r(t, zF )
≈

ṘF (t) =

=1

= g(zmax )Rzmax (t) − µRF (t) − dRF (t)
= γI(t) − (µ + d)RF (t).
12

Analogously one can find equations for RW , RC , VR , V0 and VC . Altogether we obtain
a system of ordinary differential equations in which a linear chain of ODEs replaces
the PDEs for the immune and the vaccinated class:
Ṡ(t) = (1 − α)b(N(t)) − φS(t) − β

S(t)I(t)
− dS(t)
N(t)

˙ = β I(t) (S(t) + S2 (t)) − (γ + d + dI )I(t)
I(t)
N(t)
ṘF (t) = γI(t) − µRF (t) − dRF (t)
ṘW (t) = µRF (t) − νRW (t) − dRW (t)
ṘC (t) = νRW (t) − σRC (t) − dRC (t)
V̇R (t) = −µVR (t) − dVR (t)
V̇0 (t) = φS(t) + αb(N(t)) + µVR (t) − νV0 (t) − dV0 (t)
V̇C (t) = νV0 (t) − σVC (t) − dVC (t)
S2 (t)I(t)
Ṡ2 (t) = −β
− dS2 (t) + σ(RC (t) + VC (t)).
N(t)
The method of lines can be applied to the full model (V1) as well [6]. To this purpose
it is necessary to discretize the boosting probability p(z, z̃) (this is expressed by the
parameters ξ and θ below). Incorporating the boosting effect, the result is the following
system of ODEs.

Ṡ(t) = (1 − α)b(N(t)) − φS(t) − β

The linear chain of ODEs provides a rough approximation of the PDEs in model (V1).
Indeed, with the method of lines we approximate the PDE dynamics considering only
changes at the grid points (zmin , zW , zF ), whereas the dynamics remains unchanged
13

in each immunity interval [zj , zj+1]. We consider as representative point of the interval
the lowest boundary zj - for this reason we do not have a differential equation for
Rzmax (t) or Vzmax (t).

Connection to DDE models

Delay models with constant delay can be recovered from special cases of model (V1).
We show here how to obtain the classical SIRS model with delay studied in [36], or
extensions thereof.
In the following we neglect boosting effects and vaccination. Further we do not distinguish between originally susceptibles and host who have lost immunity, hence w.r.t.
model (V1) we identify the classes S and S2 . From our assumptions, the diseaseinduced immunity lasts for a fix time, τ > 0 years, given by
Z zmax
1
dx = τ.
zmin g(x)
We can express the total immune population at time t as the number of individuals
who recovered in the time interval [t − τ, t],
Z t
Z τ
−d(t−y)
R(t) = γ
I(y)e
dy = γ
I(t − x)e−dx dx.
0

t−τ

Differentiation with respect to t yields
Ṙ(t) = γI(t) − γI(t − τ )e−dτ − dR(t).

(10)

On the other side, we have the definition in terms of distribution of immune individuals,
Z zmax
r(t, z) dz.
R(t) =
zmin

Differentiate the last relation and compare with (10):
g(zmax )r(t, zmax ) = γI(t),

g(zmin )r(t, zmin ) = γI(t − τ )e−dτ .

This means that individuals with maximal level of immunity are those who recover
from infection. If a host who recovers at time t1 survives up to time t1 + τ , he exits
the R class and enter S. In turn, we find a delay term in the equation for S too, and
have a classical SIRS model with constant delay
Ṡ(t) = b(N(t)) − β

S(t)I(t)
− dS(t) + γI(t − τ )e−dτ
N(t)

˙ = β S(t)I(t) − (γ + d + dI )I(t)
I(t)
N(t)
Ṙ(t) = γI(t) − γI(t − τ )e−dτ − dR(t),
which was studied by Taylor and Carr [36].

Now we can include again vaccination and the class S2 as in the general model (V1).
We assume that vaccine-induced immunity lasts for a time τv > 0,
Z zmax
Z zvax
1
1
dx <
dx =: τ.
τv :=
zmin g(x)
zmin g(x)
With similar arguments as for the immune population, we obtain the relations
g(zvax )v(t, zvax ) = αb(N(t)) + φS(t),
g(zmin )v(t, zmin ) = (αb(N(t − τv )) + φS(t − τv )) e−dτv ,
and find a system with two constant delays
Ṡ(t) = (1 − α)b(N(t)) − φS(t) − β

S(t)I(t)
− dS(t)
N(t)

˙ = β I(t) (S(t) + S2 (t)) − (γ + d + dI )I(t)
I(t)
N(t)
Ṙ(t) = γI(t) − γI(t − τ )e−dτ − dR(t)
V̇ (t) = αb(N(t)) + φS(t) − (αb(N(t − τv )) + φS(t − τv )) e−dτv − dV (t)
S2 (t)I(t)
Ṡ2 (t) = −β
− dS2 (t) + γI(t − τ )e−dτ
N(t)
+ (αb(N(t − τv )) + φS(t − τv )) e−dτv .
