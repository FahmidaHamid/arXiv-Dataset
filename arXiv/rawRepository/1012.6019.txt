Abstract.
The instantaneous state of a neural network consists of both the degree of excitation
of each neuron, the network is composed of, and positions of impulses in communication
lines between neurons. In neurophysiological experiments, the neuronal firing moments
are registered, but not the state of communication lines. But future spiking moments
depend essentially on the past positions of impulses in the lines. This suggests, that the
sequence of intervals between firing moments (interspike intervals, ISIs) in the network
could be non-Markovian.
In this paper, we address this question for a simplest possible neural “net”, namely,
a single neuron with delayed feedback. The neuron receives excitatory input both from
the driving Poisson stream and from its own output through the feedback line. We
obtain analytical expressions for conditional probability density P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ),
which gives the probability to get an output ISI of duration tn+1 provided the
previous (n + 1) output ISIs had durations tn , . . . , t1 , t0 . It is proven exactly, that
P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ) does not reduce to P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 ) for any n ≥ 0. This
means that the output ISIs stream cannot be represented as Markov chain of any
finite order.

1. Introduction
In a biological network, the main component parts are neurons and interneuronal
communication lines – axons [1]. These same units are the main ones in most types of
artificial neural networks [2]. If so, then the instantaneous dynamical state of a network
must include dynamical states of all neurons and communication lines the network is
composed of. The state of a neuron can be described as its degree of excitation. The
state of a line consists of information of whether the line is empty or conducts an impulse.
If it does conduct, then further information about how much time is required for the
impulse to reach the end of the line (time to live) describes the line’s state.

In neurophysiological experiments, the triggering (spiking, firing) moments of
individual neurons are registered. The sequence of intervals between the consecutive
moments (interspike intervals, ISIs) is frequently considered as renewal stochastic
process. Recently, based on experimental data it was offered that the ISIs sequence
could be Markovian of order 4 or higher [3].
The presence of memory in the ISI sequence is not surprising, taking into account
that information about triggering moments leaves unknown the states of communication
lines at those moments. On the other hand, it is namely the impulses propagating
in the communication lines that connect past firing moments with the future ones
in a reverberating neural network. Without knowledge of communication line states,
information about previous neuronal firing moments could improve our predicting ability
of the next ones. The exact answer of what kind of memory could be expected in an
ISI sequence of a neuron embedded in a reverberating neural network driven with some
noisy stimulation requires rigorous mathematical treatment.
In this paper, we consider a simplest neural “net”, namely, a single neuron with
delayed feedback, which is driven with Poisson process. As neuronal model we take
binding neuron as it allows rigorous mathematical treatment. We study the ISI output
stream of this system and prove that it cannot be presented as Markovian chain of any
finite order. This suggests that activity of a more elaborate network, if presented in
terms of neuronal firing moments, should be non-Markovian as well.
2. The object under consideration
2.1. Binding neuron model
The understanding of mechanisms of higher brain functions expects a continuous
reduction from higher activities to lower ones, eventually, to activities in individual
neurons, expressed in terms of membrane potentials and ionic currents. While this
approach is correct scientifically and desirable for applications, the complete range of

duration in the feedback line.

the reduction is unavailable to a single researcher/engineer due to human brain limited
capacity. In this connection, it would be helpful to abstract from the rules by which
a neuron changes its membrane potentials to rules by which the input impulse signals
are processed in the neuron. The coincidence detector, and temporal integrator are the
examples of such an abstraction, see discussion in [5].
One more abstraction, the binding neuron (BN) model, is proposed as signal
processing unit [6], which can operate either as coincidence detector, or temporal
integrator, depending on quantitative characteristics of stimulation applied. This
conforms with behavior of real neurons, see, e.g. [7]. The BN model describes
functioning of a neuron in terms of discret events, which are input and output
impulses, and degree of temporal coherence between the input events, see Figure 1.
Mathematically, this is realized as follows. We expect that all input impulses in all
input lines are identical. Each input impulse is stored in the BN for a fixed time, τ .
The τ is similar to the tolerance interval discussed in [8]. All input lines are excitatory.
The neuron fires an output impulse if the number of stored impulses, Σ, is equal or
higher than threshold value, N0 . After that, BN clears its memory and is ready to
receive fresh inputs. That is, every input impulse either disappears contributing to a
triggering event, or is lost after spending τ units of time in the neuron’s internal memory.
It is clear, that BN fires when a bunch of input impulses is received in a narrow temporal
interval. In this case the bunch could be considered as compound event, and the output
impulse — as an abstract representation of this compound event. One could treat this
mechanism as binding of individual input events into a single output event, provided
the input events are coherent in time. Such interpretation is suggested by binding of
features/events in largescale neuronal circuits [9, 10, 11].
Further, we expect that input stream in each input line is the Poisson one with some
intensity λi . In this case, all input lines can be collapsed into a single one delivering
P
Poisson stream of intensity λ = i λi , see Figure 2.
For analytical derivation, we use BN with N0 = 2. The case of higher threshold is
considered numerically.

2.2. Feedback line action
In real neuronal systems, a neuron can have synaptic connection of its axonal branch
at its own dendritic tree, see [12, 13] for experimental evidence. As a result, the neuron
stimulates itself obtaining excitatory impulse after each firing with some propagation
delay. We model this situation assuming that output impulses of BN are fed back
into BN’s input with delay ∆. This gives BN with delayed feedback, Figure 2. See
also Supplementary Matherial for animation of BN with delayed feedback in action.
Impulses from the feedback line have the same excitatory action on BN as those arrived
from Poisson stream. Namely, each one of them is stored in BN’s memory for time τ ,
after which it desappears completely, see section 2.1.
The feedback line either keeps one impulse, or keeps no impulses and cannot convey
two or more impulses at the same time. If the feedback line is empty at the moment of
firing, the output impulse enters the line, and after time interval equal ∆ reaches the
BN’s input. If the line already keeps one impulse at the moment of firing, the just fired
impulse ignores the line.
Any output impulse of BN with feedback line may be produced either with impulse
from the line involved, or not. We assume that, just after firing and sending output
impulse, the line is never empty. This assumption is selfevident for output impulses
produced without impulse from the line, or if the impulse from the line was involved,
but entered empty neuron. In the letter case, the second (triggering) impulse comes
from the Poisson stream, neuron fires and output impulse goes out as well as enters
the empty line. On the other hand, if impulse from the line triggers BN, which already
keeps one impulse from the input stream, it may be questionable if the output impulse
is able to enter the line, which was just filled with another impulse. We expect it does.
This means that the refraction time of biological axon modelled as feedback line is equal
∆. Thus, at the beginning of any output ISI, the line keeps impulse with time to live s,
where s ∈]0; ∆]. In this paper, we consider the case
∆<τ

(1)

in order to keep expressions shorter.
3. Statement of the problem
The input stream of impulses, which drives neuronal activity is stochastic. Therefore,
the output activity of our system requires probabilistic description in spite of the fact
that both the BN and the feedback line action mechanisms are deterministic. We treat
the output stream of BN with delayed feedback as the stationary process‡. In order to
discribe its statistics, we introduce the following basic functions:
‡ The stationarity of the output stream results both from the stationarity of the input one and from
the absence of adaptation in the BN model, see Section 2.1. In order to ensure stationarity, we also
expect that system is considered after initial period sufficient to forget the initial conditions.

• joint probability density P (tm , tm−1 , . . . , t0 ) for (m + 1) successive output ISI
durations.
• conditional probability density P (tm | tm−1 , . . . , t0 ) for output ISI durations;
P (tm | tm−1 , . . . , t0 )dtm gives the probability to obtain an output ISI of duration
between tm and tm + dtm provided previous m ISIs had durations tm−1 , tm−2 , . . . , t0 ,
respectively.
Definition The sequence of random variables {tj }, taking values in Ω, is called the
Markov chain of the order n ≥ 0, if
∀m>n ∀t0 ∈Ω . . . ∀tm ∈Ω P (tm | tm−1 , . . . , t0 ) = P (tm | tm−1 , . . . , tm−n ),
and this equation does not hold for any n′ < n (e.g. [14]). In the case of ISIs one
reads Ω = R+ .
In particular, taking m = n + 1, we have the necessary condition
P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ) = P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 ),

ti ∈ Ω,

i = 0, . . . , n + 1,

(2)

required for the stochastic process {tj } to be the n-order Markov chain.
Theorem 1 The output ISIs stream of BN with delayed feedback under Poisson
stimulation cannot be represented as a Markov chain of any finite order.
4. Proof outline
In order to prove the Theorem 1, we are going to show analytically, that the equality (2)
does not hold for any finite value of n, namely, in the exact expression for conditional
probability density P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ), elimination of t0 -dependence is impossible.
For this purpose we introduce the stream of events (t, s)
ts = {. . . , (ti , si ), . . .},
where si is the time to live of the impulse in the feedback line at the moment, when
ISI ti starts. We consider the joint probability density P (tn+1 , sn+1; tn , sn ; . . . ; t0 , s0 )
for realization of (n + 2) successive events (t, s), and the corresponding conditional
probability density P (tn+1 , sn+1 | tn , sn ; . . . ; t0 , s0 ) for these events.
Lemma 1 Stream ts is 1-st order markovian:
∀n≥0 ∀t0 >0 ∀s0 ∈]0;∆] . . . ∀tn+1 >0 ∀sn+1 ∈]0;∆]
P (tn+1 , sn+1 | tn , sn ; . . . ; t0 , s0 ) = P (tn+1, sn+1 | tn , sn ),

(3)

where {t0 , . . . , tn+1 } is the set of successive ISIs, and {s0 , . . . , sn+1 } are
corresponding times to live.
Proof Indeed, the value of sn+1 characterizes the state of the system at the moment of
triggering, θ, and the value of tn+1 characterizes the system’s behavior after that
triggering, which means that, in physical time, sn+1 always gets its value before

Delayed feedback causes non-Markovian behavior of neuronal firing statistics

6

than the tn+1 does. Once the value of sn+1 is known, the realization of tn+1 is
completely determined by a unique realization of the input Poisson process after
the θ.
At the same time, in P (tn+1, sn+1 | tn , sn , . . . , t0 , s0 ) the value of sn+1 can be derived
unambiguously from (tn , sn ) (See Sections 2.2 and 5.2):
sn+1 = sn − tn ,

tn < sn ,

= ∆,

tn ≥ sn .

(4)

Just after triggering, BN appears in the standard state (it is empty), the state of
line is given by the value of sn+1 , and the state of input Poisson stream is always
the same. Therefore, once the pair of values (tn , sn ) is given, the state of the system
at the moment of (n + 1)-th ISI beginning is determined completely, and knowledge
of previous values of (ti , si ), i < n adds nothing to our predictive ability as regards
the values of (tn+1 , sn+1 ), which proves (3).
In order to find the conditional probability density P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ), the
following steps should be performed:
• Step 1. Use property (3) for calculating joint probability of events (t, s):
P (tn+1 , sn+1 ; tn , sn ; . . . ; t0 , s0 ) =
P (tn+1 , sn+1 | tn , sn ) . . . P (t1 , s1 | t0 , s0 )P (t0 , s0 ),

(5)

where P (t, s) and P (tn , sn | tn−1 , sn−1 ) denote the stationary probability density
and conditional probability density (transition probability) for events (t, s).
• Step 2. Represent the joint probability density for successive output ISI durations
as marginal probability by integration over variables si , i = 0, 1, . . . , n + 1:

P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t1 , t0 ). It appears, that the conditional probabilities have singular parts

of the Dirac’s δ-function type. This is because the system’s dynamics involves discret
events of obtaining impulse by neuron (see below). In order to prove that the equality (2)
does not hold for any n ≥ 0, we use the singular parts only.
5. Main calculations
5.1. Probability density P (t, s) for events (t, s)
The probability density P (t, s) can be derived as the product
P (t, s) = F (t | s)f (s),

(9)

where f (s) denotes the stationary probability density for time to live of the impulse in
the feedback line at the moment of an output ISI beginning, F (t | s) denotes conditional
probability density for ISI duration provided the time to live of the impulse in the
feedback line equals s at the moment of this ISI beginning. Exact expressions for both
f (s) and F (t | s) are given in [15, Eqs.(5),(6) and (31)]. In this paper we need only
singular parts of those expressions, which read:
F sing (t | s) = λse−λs δ(t − s),
(10)
f sing (s) = a · δ(s − ∆),

where

a=

4e2λ∆
,
(3 + 2λ∆)e2λ∆ + 1

(11)

where a gives the probability to obtain the impulse in the feedback line with time to live
equal ∆ at the beginning of an arbitrary ISI, λ — is the input Poisson stream intensity.
The presence of δ-functions in F (t | s) and f (s) can be explained as follows. The
probability to obtain an output ISI of duration t exactly equal s is not infinitesimally
small. Due to (1), it equals to the probability to obtain exactly one impulse from the
Poisson stream during time interval ]0; s[, which is λse−λs . The second impulse comes
from the line and triggers the neuron exactly after time interval s. So, we have the

Delayed feedback causes non-Markovian behavior of neuronal firing statistics

8

non-zero probability to obtain an output ISI of duration exactly equal to s. This gives
the δ-function at t = s in the probability density F (t | s).
The probability to have time to live, s, exactly equal ∆ at the moment of an output
ISI beginning is not infinitessimally small as well. Every time, when the line is free at
the moment of an output ISI beginning, the impulse enters the line and has time to
live equal ∆. For the line to be free from impulses at the moment of triggering, it is
nessesary that t ≥ s for the previous ISI. The set of realizations of the input Poisson
process, each realization results in t ≥ s, has non-zero probability a, see (11), and this
gives the δ-function at s = ∆ in the probability density f (s).
The output ISI probability density P (t) can be obtained as the result of integration
of (9) (see [15] for details):
Z ∆
P (t) =
F (t|s)f (s)ds.

Examples of P (t) and f (s) graphs are given in Figure 3.

5.2. Conditional probability density P (tk , sk | tk−1 , sk−1)
Here we find the conditional probability density P (tk , sk | tk−1 , sk−1 ) for events (tk , sk ),
which determines the probability to obtain the event (tk , sk ), with precision dtk dsk ,
provided the previous event was (tk−1 , sk−1 ). By definition of conditional probabilities,
the probability density wanted can be represented as the following product
P (tk , sk | tk−1 , sk−1 ) = F (tk | sk , tk−1 , sk−1)f (sk | tk−1 , sk−1),

(13)

where F (tk | sk , tk−1 , sk−1 ) denotes conditional probability density for ISI duration, tk ,
provided i) this ISI started with lifetime of impulse in the feedback line equal to sk , and
ii) previous (t, s)-event was (tk−1 , sk−1 ); f (sk | tk−1 , sk−1) denotes conditional probability
density for times to live of the impulse in the feedback line under condition ii). It is
obvious, that
F (tk | sk , tk−1 , sk−1) = F (tk | sk ),

(14)

because with sk being known, the previous event (tk−1 , sk−1 ) does not add any
information, useful to predict tk (compare with proof of Lemma 1).
In order to find the probability density f (sk | tk−1 , sk−1), let us consider different
relations between tk−1 and sk−1 . If tk−1 ≥ sk−1 , the line will have time to get free from
the impulse during the ISI tk−1 . That is why at the beginning of ISI tk , an output spike
will enter the line and will have time to live equal sk = ∆ with probability 1. Therefore,
the probability density contains the corresponding delta-function:
f (sk | tk−1 , sk−1 ) = δ(sk − ∆),

tk−1 ≥ sk−1 .

(15)

If tk−1 < sk−1 , than the ISI tk−1 ends before the impulse leaves the feedback line.
Therefore, at the beginning of the tk , the line still keeps the same impulse as at

Delayed feedback causes non-Markovian behavior of neuronal firing statistics
the beginning of tk−1 .
sk = sk−1 − tk−1 , so

9

This impulse has time to live being accurately equal to

f (sk | tk−1 , sk−1 ) = δ(sk − sk−1 + tk−1 ),

tk−1 < sk−1 .

(16)

Taking all together, for the conditional probability density P (tk , sk | tk−1 , sk−1) one
obtains
P (tk , sk | tk−1 , sk−1 ) = F (tk | sk )δ(sk − ∆),

tk−1 ≥ sk−1 ,

= F (tk | sk )δ(sk − sk−1 + tk−1 ),

tk−1 < sk−1 ,(17)

where exact expression for F (t | s) is given in [15, Eqs.(5),(6)].
5.3. Joint probability density P (tn+1 , . . . , t0 )

probability density P (tn+1 , . . . , t0 ) at the domain

It is worth to notice, that the set of (n + 1) successive ISI durations t0 , . . . , tn has
non-zero probability, p∆ > 0, to fall into the domain (18). Indeed, BN with threshold
N0 = 2 needs 2(n + 1) input impulses within time window ]0; ∆[ to be triggered (n + 1)
times within this window (condition (1) ensures that no input impulse is lost). BN
receives impulses both from the Poisson stream and from the line. But no more than
one impulse from the line may have time to reach BN’s input during time interval less
than ∆. Therefore, the other (2n + 1) impulses must be received from the Poisson
stream. On the other hand, if 2(n + 1) input impulses are received from the Poisson
stream during time interval ]0; ∆[, the inequality (18) holds for sure, no matter is the
impulse from the feedback line involved, or not. Therefore, p∆ > p(2n + 2, ∆) > 0,
where p(i, ∆) gives the probability to obtain i impulses from the Poisson stream during
time interval ∆ [16]: p(i, ∆) = e−λ∆ (λ∆)i /i!.

Consider the fixed sequence of ISIs, (t0 , . . . , tn ), which belongs to D1 . Domain of s0
values covered by Ii , i = 0, . . . , n, corresponds to the scenario, when impulse, which was
in the feedback line at the beginning of interval t0 (with time to live s0 ), will reach BN
during interval ti . In this process, after each firing, which starts ISI tk , k ≤ i, the time
to live of the impulse in the feedback line is decreased exactly by tk−1 . This means, that
variables of integration {s0 , . . . , sn+1 }, above, are not actually independent, but must
satisfy the following relations:

(22)

and this is ensured by δ-function in the top line of (17). The next to si+1 times to live
again are decreased by corresponding ISI with each triggering. Due to (18), this brings

The last expression might be obtained as well by means of consecutive substitution
of either top, or bottom line of (17) into (19), without previously discovering (21) –
(24).
Finally, integral In+1 corresponds to the case, when at the beginning of interval
tn+1 , the line still keeps the same impulse as at the beginning of t0 . Therefore, In+1
comprises the rest of scenarios contributing to the value of P (tn+1 , . . . , t0 ) in (6). Here,

5.4. Singular part of P (tn+1 , . . . , t0 )
In order to obtain the singular part of expression, defined in (29), let us first derive
singular parts for all Ii , i = 0, . . . , n and In+1 separately. In order to keep the expressions
shorter, we represent Ii as follows
Ii (t0 , . . . , tn+1 ) = Xi (t0 , . . . , ti ) · Yi (ti+1 , . . . , tn+1 ),
where
Xi ≡

It is clear, that at D1 , Xi is the part of the probability density for (i + 1) successive
ISI durations, which corresponds to the case when the impulse, which was in the line
at the beginning of the first ISI, reaches the neuron’s input within the last one. And
the Yi gives the probability density for (n + 1 − i) successive ISI durations provided the
impulse enters the line just at the beginning of the first one of these ISIs.

Obviously, each factor Ai , i = 0, . . . , n, gives the probability to obtain (n + 1 − i)
successive output ISIs of overall duration exactly equal ∆. And An+1 gives the
probability to obtain (n + 2) successive output ISIs of overall duration exactly equal ∆.
The presence of δ-functions in joint probability density P (tn+1 , . . . , t0 ) can be
additionally explained as follows. If at the beginning of (i + 1)-th ISI, the impulse enters
the line, then output interval tn+1 will start with that same impulse in the feedback line
P
with time to live equal sn+1 = ∆ − nj=i+1 tj . To trigger BN after time exactly equal

Delayed feedback causes non-Markovian behavior of neuronal firing statistics

14

sn+1 after that, it is nesessary to obtain one impulse from the Poisson stream during
time interval sn+1 . This event has non-zero probability, therefore we have the non-zero
P
probability of an output ISI exactly equal to sn+1 : tn+1 = ∆ − nj=i+1 tj . This gives the
corresponding δ-functions in ISI probability density. The term with δ(tn+1 +. . .+t0 −∆)
corresponds to the case, when the impulse enters the line at the beginning of t0 .

probability density P (tn , . . . , t0 ) has no singularities at the domain tn < ∆ − i=0
ti ,
see (37) with (n − 1) substituted instead of n.
As one can see, function P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t0 ) contains singularty at tn+1 = ∆ − tn −
tn−1 − . . . − t0 . The dependence of the singular part of function P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t0 ) on
t0 cannot be compensated by any regular summands, therefore, the whole conditional
probability density P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t0 ) depends on t0 . It means, that the condition
(2) does not hold for any n for the output stream of BN with delayed feedback. The
Theorem 1 is proven.
6. Particular cases
In previous section, we have prooven the impossibility to represent the stream of output
ISI durations for BN with delayed feedback as a Markov chain of any finite order. In
particular, output ISI stream is neither a sequence of independent random variables,
and therefore is non-renewal, nor it is the first-order Markovian process.
In the course of proving Theorem 1 (see Sections 4 and 5), we have obtained the
Pn
expression for P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t0 ) at the domain
i=0 ti < ∆ in general case of an
arbitrary n, see (30).
In this section, we consider the two particular cases of P (tn+1 | tn , . . . , t0 ) when
n = 0 and n = 1, namely, the single-moment conditional probability density P (t1 | t0 )
and the double-moment conditional probability density P (t2 | t1 , t0 ) and obtain the
expressions for P (t1 | t0 ) and P (t2 | t1 , t0 ) for domain (18), as well as for all other
possible domains, which were omitted in general consideration.
6.1. Conditional probability density P (t1 | t0 )
In order to derive the exact expression for conditional probability density P (t1 | t0 ) for
neighbouring ISI durations, we take Steps 1–3, outlined in Section 4, for n = 0. In the
case of P (t1 | t0 ), there are only three domains, on which the expressions should be

Delayed feedback causes non-Markovian behavior of neuronal firing statistics

15

obtained separately, namely cases t0 < ∆, t0 > ∆ and t0 = ∆. Performing intergation
in (8), one obtains the following expressions for P (t1 , t0 ) at these domains:
P (t1 , t0 ) = F (t1 | ∆)P (t0 ),
Z t0

Then, by definition of conditional probability densities, one obtains:
P (t1 | t0 ) = F (t1 | ∆),

(44)

t0

It should be outlined, that the output ISI probability density P (t0 ) has no singularities
at the domain t0 < ∆. Indeed, due to (10)–(12), the only δ-function contained in P (t0 )
is placed at t0 = ∆, see Figure 3 (a).
In vicinity of the point t0 = ∆, the single-moment conditional probability density
can be derived as

∆−ǫ
P (t1 | t0 = ∆) = lim ∆+ǫ

which just gives δ-functions’ masses both in numerator and denominator, and delivers
P (t1 | t0 ) = F (t1 | ∆),

t0 = ∆.

(46)

Expressions (43), (44) and (46) can be understood as follows. Since t0 ≥ ∆, one
can be sure that the line has time to get free from impulse during t0 , therefore at the
moment of next firing (at the beginning of t1 ) the impulse enters the line and has time
to live equal ∆. In the case of t0 < ∆, see (44), two possibilities arise. The first term
corresponds to the scenario, when the feedback line discharges conveyed impulse within
time interval t0 , and the second one represents the case when at the beginning of t1 the
line still keeps the same impulse as at the beginning of t0 .
It can be shown, that the following normalization conditions take place:

dt1 P (t1 | t0 ) = 1, and dt0 P (t1 , t0 ) = P (t1 ).

= 150 s−1 , N0 = 2, t0 =6 ms (a) and t0 = 11 ms (b), found numerically by means of
Monte-Carlo method (the number of firings accounted N = 30 000).

Obviously, expression (48) could be obtained directly from (38)–(40) by substituting
n = 0.
As it can be seen from (47) and (48), the number of δ-functions in P (t1 | t0 ) and
their positions depend on t0 , therefore the conditional probability density P (t1 | t0 )
cannot be reduced to output ISI probability density P (t1 ). Therefore, the neihgbouring
output ISIs of BN with delayed feedback are correlated, as expected.
Examples of P (t1 | t0 ), found for two domains numerically, by means of Monte-Carlo
method (see Section 7 for details), are placed at Figure 4.
6.2. Conditional probability density P (t2 | t1 , t0 )
In order to derive the exact expression for conditional probability density P (t2 | t1 , t0 )
for the succecive ISI durations, we take Steps 1–3, outlined in Section 4, for n = 1.
In the case of P (t2 , t1 , t0 ), there are six domains, on which the expressions should be
obtained separately, namely, the domain
D1 = {t1 , t0 | t1 + t0 < ∆},
which was already utilized in Section 5, and five remaining:
D2 = {t1 , t0 |

t0 ≥ ∆

and

t1 ≥ ∆},

D3 = {t1 , t0 |

t0 < ∆

and

t1 ≥ ∆},

D4 = {t1 , t0 |

t0 ≥ ∆

and

t1 < ∆},

D5 = {t1 , t0 |

t0 < ∆

and

∆ − t0 < t1 < ∆},

d = {t1 , t0 |

t0 + t1 = ∆}.

In the case, when the exact equality t0 +t1 = ∆ holds, namely, if (t1 , t0 ) ∈ d, the product
P (t2 | t1 , t0 )dt2 gives the probability to obtain an output ISI of duration within interval
[t2 ; t2 + dt2 [, provided the overall duration of two previous ISIs accurately equals ∆.

and (54). Indeed, from (47) and (48) one can see, that P (t1 , t0 ) may include singularities
only at the points t1 = ∆ and t1 = ∆ − t0 . None of these points belongs to D1 , or D5 .
It can be shown, that the following normalization conditions take place:

Obviously, expression (58) could be obtained directly from (38)–(40) by substituting
n = 1.
As one can see, the singular part of P (t2 | t1 , t0 ) depends on t0 , therefore P (t2 | t1 , t0 )
cannot be reduced to P (t2 | t1 ), which means that the output stream is not first-order
Markovian.
Examples of P (t2 | t1 , t0 ), found numerically for different domains, are placed at
Figures 5 and 6.
7. Numerical simulation
In order to check the correctness of obtained analytical expressions, and also to
investigate wheather the output ISIs stream is non-Markovian for BN with higher
thresholds as well as for N0 = 2, numerical simulations were performed. A C++
program, containing class, which models the operation manner of BN with delayed
feedback, was developed. Object of this class receives the sequence of pseudorandom
numbers with Poisson probability density to its input. The required sequences were
generated by means of utilities from the GNU Scientific Library§ with the Mersenne
Twister generator as source of pseudorandom numbers.

numerically by means of Monte-Carlo method (N = 30 000).

Program contains function, the time engine, which brings system to the moment
just before the next input signal, bypassing moments, when neither external Poisson
impulse, nor impulse from the feedback line comes. So, only the essential discret events
are accounted. It allows one to make exact calculations faster as compared to the
algorithm where time advances gradually by adding small timesteps.
The conditional probability densities, P (t1 | t0 ) and P (t2 | t1 , t0 ), are found
by counting the number of output ISI of different durations and normalization (see
Figures 4 – 7). Obviously, for calculation of conditional distiributions only those
ISIs are selected, which follow one or two ISIs of fixed duration, t0 for P (t1 | t0 )
and {t1 , t0 } for P (t2 | t1 , t0 ). The quantity, the position and the mass of deltafunctions, obtained in numerical experiments for BN with threshold 2, coincide with
those predicted analitycally in (47), (48) and (55) – (58).
For N0 > 2, conditional probability densities P (t1 | t0 ) and P (t2 | t1 , t0 ) are similar
to those, found for N0 =2. In particular, both the quantity and position of delta-functions
coincide with those obtained for BN with threshold 2, as expected, compare Figures 7
and 6.
8. Conclusions and discussion
Our results reveal the influence of the delayed feedback presence on the neuronal
firing statistics. In contrast to the cases of BN without feedback [17] and BN with
instantaneous feedback [18], the nighbouring output ISIs of BN with delayed feedback
are mutually correlated. It means that even in the simplest possible recurrent network
the ISI stream cannot be treated as the renewal one. The presence of nearest ISIs
correlation was reported for spike trains of a neurons in different CNS and peripheral
NS structures [19, 20].
Moreover, we prove, that the output ISI stream of BN with delayed feedback cannot

be represented as the Markov chain of any finite order. This is in accordance with rare
attempts of experimental estimation of the Markov order of neuronal spike trains (see,
e.g. [3], where it is established that the order, if any, must be greater than 3).
We expect the same non-markovian property for firing statistics of any single neuron
with delayed feedback, whatever neuronal model is used, and conclude that it is namely
the delayed feedback presence results in non-markovian statistics found. One should
take this fact into account during analysis of neuronal spike trains obtained from any
recurent network.
