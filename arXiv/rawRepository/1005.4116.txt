In a well-stirred system undergoing chemical reactions, fluctuations in the reaction propensities
are approximately captured by the corresponding chemical Langevin equation. Within this context,
we discuss in this work how the Kramers escape theory can be used to predict rare events in chemical
reactions. As an example, we apply our approach to a recently proposed model on cell proliferation
with relevance to skin cancer [P. B. Warren, Phys. Rev. E 80, 030903 (2009)]. In particular, we
provide an analytical explanation for the form of the exponential exponent observed in the onset
rate of uncontrolled cell proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

Noise is ubiquitous in systems undergoing chemical reactions. In a well-stirred system, the source of noise
comes from the probabilistic nature of the reactions,
and can be analyzed by employing the Chemical Master
Equation (CME) [1, 2]. With the help of the KramersMoyal expansion, a Chemical Langevin Equation (CLE)
can be formulated to approximate the CME [2–4]. When
the number of molecules in the system is small, the limitations of the approximation have been explored in [5, 6].
On the other hand, when the numbers of molecules of
the different chemical species in the system are greater
than certain thresholds, the CLE constitutes a reasonable approximation to the CME [4]. One big advantage
of the CLE is the well developed analytical tools available. For instance, thermally activated escape theory
(see, e.g., [7, 8]), such as Kramers escape theory, serves
as a natural platform for the studies of extinction rate of
chemical species [9–13], and transition rates between two
metastable states of the system concerned [14]. This is
the approach adopted in this work. Besides being of general interest to chemical systems, the method discussed
here is also relevant to cellular processes. One interesting
example is the recent proposal that metastability in skin
cell proliferation constitutes a component in the pathogenesis of cancer [15]. In particular, the author in [15]
observed numerically that the rate for the onset of uncontrolled cell proliferation has an exponential component
that scales in a specific manner with the model parameters. As an illustration, we shall demonstrate how the
form of the exponent observed can be explained analytically within the context of Kramers escape theory.

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

We will first start by considering a simple example to
set up the formalism. Consider the following set of chem-

model described in Eq. (1). There exist two fixed points: a
stable one at nA = M and an unstable one at nA = N . If nA
gets beyond N , it will diverge to infinity. The phase portrait
of the model is depicted under the plot.

where λ depends on the number of A molecules, na , in
the following manner:

if nA < N
λ(nA ) =

2ΓnA , otherwise ,
where M and Γ are constant. In a deterministic system,
the above scenario is governed by the following equation:


(3)
ṅA = λ(nA ) − ΓnA nA .

In other words, if 0 < nA (t = 0) < N , then nA (t →
∞) = M . On the other hand, if nA (t = 0) ≥ N , then
nA (t → ∞) diverges (c.f. the phase portrait under the
plot in Fig. 1).

2
This deterministic picture is of course incomplete due
to the neglect of the intrinsic fluctuations from the reaction propensities. Such fluctuations are approximately
captured by the following CLE [4]:

ṅA = λ(nA )− ΓnA nA + λ(nA )nA w + Γn2A w′ , (4)

FIG. 2: (Color online) The flow lines of the cell proliferation
model described in Eqs (13) and (14). The two fixed points of
the models are depicted by the gray circle and square (c.f. Eqs
(22) and (23)). The red (gray) wriggly line depicts schematically a possible escape trajectory. The numerical values for
the model parameters are α = 2, β = 10, r = 0.08, n0 = 200,
Γ = 0.045, ρ0 = 0.22 and ρ1 = 0.26 [15].

where w, w′ are Gaussian noises with zero means and unit
standard deviations. Since w and w′ are uncorrelated, we
have
p

ṅA = γf + 2γw
where we have introduced the following functions:


λ(nA ) + ΓnA nA
γ =

2[λ(nA ) − ΓnA ]
f =

λ(nA ) + ΓnA

(6)
(7)

Note that the form of Eq. (5) corresponds to a Langevin
equation describing a particle in a potential well under
thermal perturbations in the non-inertia regime. Specifically, nA can be treated as the coordinate of the particle,
f as the force exerted on the particle due to an underlying potential, and γ as the position-dependent damping
coefficient of the system.
In the region nA < M , the force is
2(M − nA )
.
f (nA ) =
M + nA

(8)

The corresponding potential energy can thus be determined as
Z nA
dxf (x)
(9)
U (nA ) = −
M

= 2(nA − M ) − 4M ln

nA + M
.
2M

(10)

Similarly, in the region nA ≥ M , we have f (nA ) = 23 and
U (nA ) = −2nA /3 + constant. The shape of the potential
energy is depicted in Fig. 1.
We are primarily concerned with rare escape events
and we thus assume that N − M ≫ 1. In this scenario, if
the initial state of the system is such that nA (t = 0) = M ,
then the waiting time, τ , for the system to move out of
the potential well, i.e., the waiting time for nA to attain
the value N is (c.f. Sect. 7.2 in [8]):

Note that nA will, with probability one, either go to zero
or diverge [8], and so the knowledge of the escape rate is
particularly important.

SKIN CELL PROLIFERATION

We now move onto discussing a model for skin cell
proliferation. The model we study is based on the single
progenitor cell model introduced in [16, 17]. This model
was then generalized in [15] to account for the homeostasis of the system. Furthermore, the author in [15]
suggests that the escape of the system from the homeostatic basin due to rare stochastic fluctuations plays a
role in uncontrolled cell proliferation. This is of important relevance to the study of skin cancer. Specifically,
there are two basal layer cell types in this model: progenitor cells A and postmitotic cells B. These two types
of cells proliferate according to following scheme:
λ

A −→ B + B , B −→ ∅ .

(14)

Γ

The first three processes represent the different progenitor cell division pathways, and the fourth represents postmitotic cells leaving the basal layer. In the model above,
Γ is a constant and λi are defined as follow:
λ1 = λ(n)r(1 − q(ρ))
λ2 = λ(n)(1 − 2r)
λ3 = λ(n)r(1 + q(ρ))

(15)

(17)

where

ṅB = λ(1 + 2rq)nA − ΓnB . (21)

Setting the L.H.S. in the equations above to zero, we find
two nontrivial fixed points:

These fixed points are denoted by a gray circle and a gray
square respectively in Fig. 2 along with flow lines.
The corresponding CLE for this system is [4]:

where the wi are again Gaussian noises with zero means
and unit standard deviations. As among the four independent Gaussian noise terms, only w3 are common in
both equations, we can thus simplify the above equation
to the followings:
p
ṅA = (λ1 − λ3 )nA + (λ1 + λ3 )nA w1

Note that the constants n0 , ρ0 and ρ1 represent the initial number of cells, the fraction of progenitor cells at the
stable fixed point (marked by the gray circle in Fig. 2),
and the fraction of progenitor cells at the unstable fixed
point (marked by the gray square in Fig. 2), respectively.
An experimentally motivated set of parameters for this
model is shown in the caption of Fig. 2. We refer the
readers to [15–17] for more detailed physiological interpretations of the different processes. Here, we will only
note that a divergence of the total cell density, nA + nB ,
signifies the onset of uncontrolled cell proliferation. In
[15], the author employs the standard Gillespie kinetic
Monte Carlo algorithm [18] to perform stochastic simulations of the model, and finds that the escape rate has an
exponential component of the form exp(−4.6 × n0 △ρ2 )
where △ρ ≡ ρ1 − ρ0 denotes the difference in the fractions of progenitor cells at the saddle point and at the
fixed point. We will now demonstrate how the Kramers
escape theory accounts for the exponent observed.
We shall first look at the deterministic case, where the
chemical reaction scheme in Eqs (13) and (14) lead to
the following set of ordinary differential equations:

(c.f. the discussion before Eq. (39)), which corresponds to the

corresponds to the correlation between the two fluctuation processes.
Note that in dimensions higher than one, one cannot
in general represent the force fields as the gradients of
a potential, i.e., the force is not conservative. Although
a potential energy cannot be constructed here, it is still
possible to obtain a scalar function that serves to determine the exponent in the Arrhenius term associated to
the escape process [19]. This can be achieved by solving a second-order boundary value problem, and usually
can only be done numerically. Here, we will avoid this
numerical challenge and aim to proceed analytically by
making a series of approximations to the above CLE.
As aforementioned, the Gaussian noises associated to
the two coordinates are correlated. In Fig. 3, we show
the magnitude of σ around the two fixed points, which is
bounded above by 0.31. The first approximation is that
we will set σ to zero, i.e., we assume that the perturbations acting on nA and nB are uncorrelated. With this
simplification, Eqs (24) and (25) can be written as:

ṅA = γA fA + 2γA wA , ṅB = γB fB + 2γB wB ,

Fig. 4 show the force vectors (fA , fB ) around the two
fixed points, which suggests that |fB | ≪ |fA | in the region connecting X and Y. In other words, it is much
easier for the particle to diffuse vertically than to diffuse horizontally. We will therefore ignore the second
dimension and consider purely the first coordinate. This
constitutes our second approximation and effectively collapses the problem into a one-dimensional problem. As
a result, we can calculate the corresponding potential by
simply integrating over fA :

(33)
U = 2q

where we will take n̂B = XB (c.f. Eqs (20) and (22)).
If the initial cell densities are in the metastable region
around X, the rate, R, at which uncontrolled cell proliferation occurs will be of the form R ∝ exp(−△U ) [19],
where

Note that our consideration effectively amounts to calculating the first passage time of a particle constrained to
diffuse along the horizontal path depicted by the broken
line in Fig. 3.
Since throughout the range of the integration, the argument in q is bounded above by 0.12, q is well approximated by q̃ where (c.f. Eq. (20))
q̃(ρ) =

10ρ0 (1 − ρ0 )(ρ − ρ0 )(ρ1 − ρ)

where the second approximated equality comes from substituting in the numerical values of the parameters shown
in the caption of Fig. 2. Recall that the exponent is found
numerically to be (4.6 × n0 △ρ2 ) [15]. We have therefore
recovered the scaling of the exponent with respect to △ρ.
On the other hand, the prefactor we obtained is about
two thirds of that observed from simulations.
We will now try to incorporate the second dimension
and the correlation in the fluctuations into the picture.
Our strategy is to find a path that better represents the
escape route. In the weak noise limit, such an optimal
escape path encapsulates the information on the asymptotic behavior of the escape process, and in principle,
can be obtained by solving a set Hamiltonian equations
with the appropriate end points. [7, 20–22]. We find
the application of the numerical procedure to the problem concerned challenging as the corresponding set of
Hamiltonian equations are higher sensitive to the initial
conditions chosen. Hence, we will instead make a crude
estimate on the escape path that connects the metastable
state to the saddle point [24]. Specifically, as we have argued that the particle diffuses more easily along the vertical direction, we reason that as the particle goes upward
in the nA direction, it should stay at the bottom of the
valley with respect to the force fields along the nA . We
therefore start at the metastable point, X, and find the
nA that minimizes |fA | as we move up in the nB dimension. We find that such a path corresponds to a slanted
as depicted by the solid line in Fig. 3. When the path
reaches YB in the nB coordinate, we simply connects it
horizontally with the saddle point Y (c.f. Fig. 3). We
denote this escape path by z(s), where 0 ≤ s ≤ L corresponds to the parametrization of the curve such that
z(0) = X, z(L) = Y and |z′ (s)| = 1 for all s. Now, we
collapse again the problem into one dimension by considering only fluctuation processes along this path. The
time evolution of the particle along the path can be expressed as:
ṡ = uγA fA + vγB fB
(38)

where the γA/B and fA/B are as expressed in Eqs (31)
and (32), σ is defined in Eq. (29), and (u, v) denotes the
unit tangent of the curve z at the point (nA , nB ). As
a result, the exponent in the rate describing the escape
process from s = 0 to s = L is:

This simplification allows us to perform the integration

△U = 2.05 = 6.4 × n0 △ρ2 ,

which is greater than the simulation results by about
39%. The discrepancy here is likely an outcome of

our crude way of estimating the escape path. To improve upon this result, more sophisticated numerical approaches would be required, which is beyond the scope
of this work.

explained analytically the observed rate for the onset of
uncontrolled cell growth.
