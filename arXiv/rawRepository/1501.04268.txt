Abstract
The Cancer Genome Atlas project was initiated by the National Cancer Institute in order to
characterize the genomes of hundreds of tumors of various cancer types. While much effort has
been put into detecting somatic genomic variation in these data, somatic structural variation
induced by the activity of transposable element insertions has not been reported. Transposable
elements (TEs) are particularly relevant in cancer in part because of several known cases in
which a TE insertion is directly linked to cancer formation and studies linking the epigenetic
status of retrotransposons to carcinogenesis and patient outcome. Additionally, evidence for
somatic retrotransposition in eukaryotic genomes suggests that some tissues and therefore some
cancer types may be disposed to increased retrotransposition. We built upon previous work to
develop a highly efficient computational pipeline for the detection of non-reference mobile element insertions from high-throughput paired-end whole genome sequencing data that is capable
of detecting breakpoints through a local assembly strategy. Using this, we analyzed 33 whole
genome tumor datasets with paired normal samples from TCGA across 3 different cancer types:
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD). We detected 72 insertions in colon samples, almost all of them LINE-1
elements, and none in GBM or OV. The amount of somatic retrotransposition varies widely
between samples with 61 insertions present in one case. The lack of somatic retrotransposon
insertions in GBM and OV samples suggests that TE activity in cancer is restricted to certain
cancer types.

Introduction

Retrotransposons are found in all eukaryotic genomes. They are observed as repetitive DNA elements due to their capacity to insert new copies of themselves into the host DNA through a copy
and paste process using an RNA intermediate (Boeke et al., 1985). They are categorized as either
long terminal repeat (LTR) or non-LTR and further into families based on sequence similarity
to other elements and by their mechanism of mobilization. The non-LTR retrotransposons that
inhabit mammalian genomes are likely to mobilize through a mechanism known as target-primed
reverse transcription (Luan et al., 1993). Numerous retrotransposon copies exist in the human
genome, comprising at least 45% of its DNA (Lander et al., 2001) and perhaps over two-thirds
when highly sensitive TE detection methods are applied (de Koning et al., 2011). The most prolific
retroelements in the human genome include LINE-1 and Alu sequences, comprising 17% and 8%
of the assembled reference genome, respectively. During primate evolution, the general pattern of
retroelement activity has been for one family of LINE element to be active at a time, suggesting either competition for a host factor or adaptation to evade one (Khan et al., 2006). LINE-1 elements
are autonomous retrotransposons encoding two proteins (Scott et al., 1987) responsible for both
1

their own mobilization in cis and the mobilization of non-autonomous Alu elements (Dewannieux
et al., 2003), SVA elements (Hancks et al., 2011), and processed pseudogenes (Esnault et al., 2000)
in trans. The activity of the human-specific LINE element, termed L1HS, was first recognized in
vivo due to its ability to disrupt exons and cause Mendelian disease (Kazazian et al., 1988). Since
then, transposable elements have been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer, through
insertional mutagenesis of exons and regulatory regions near genes, disrupting gene function or
regulation (see Hancks et al. 2012 for review). For example, in one case, an exonic L1 insertion
was found in the APC tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer tissue but not the normal tissue of
the same patient (Miki, 1992). Intronic retroelement insertions are known to affect splicing by providing 5’ or 3’ splice sites or disrupting sequence at the branch point (Belancio et al., 2008; Hancks
et al., 2009; Taniguchi-Ikeda et al., 2011). Recent estimates place the rate of L1 retrotransposition
in human genomes at 1 new insertion for every 100 to 150 live births (Ewing and Kazazian, 2010;
Huang et al., 2010). Since retroelements can clearly have an impact on phenotype and disease, it is
important that retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) and mutations be characterized in
genomic studies. A plethora of recent studies provide various means to document retrotransposon
insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) segregating in human populations (Beck et al., 2010; Ewing and
Kazazian, 2010; Hormozdiari et al., 2010a; Huang et al., 2010; Iskow et al., 2010; Witherspoon
et al., 2010; Ewing and Kazazian, 2011; Stewart et al., 2011), including one report of 9 somatic
retrotransposon insertions across 6 lung tumors (Iskow et al., 2010).
Cancer progression depends on the accumulation of somatic mutations, and recent evidence
suggests that retrotransposition also occurs in some somatic tissues such as neuronal stem cells
(Muotri et al., 2005; Coufal et al., 2009; Baillie et al., 2011). The observation of somatic retrotransposition in specific tissue types suggests tissue-specific regulation, either through known regulators
such as APOBEC3 proteins (Kinomoto et al., 2007; Muckenfuss et al., 2006; Stenglein and Harris,
2006; Chen et al., 2006), germline piRNAs (Aravin et al., 2007), and DNA methylation (Yoder
et al., 1997; Bourc’his and Bestor, 2004), or through novel mechanism(s) not yet ascribed to transposable elements. Other lines of evidence for somatic retrotransposition include the aforementioned
disease-causing insertions, observations of varying levels of transgene-bourne somatic retrotransposition in transgenic mice (Kano et al., 2009), and somatic R2 insertions in Drosophila simulans
(Eickbush and Eickbush, 2011). In addition to mutagenizing both somatic and germline genomes
through new insertions, transposable elements play an important role in shaping gene regulatory
networks by providing binding sites for transcription factors, including those highly important for
cancer progression such as TP53 and SOX2 (Wang et al., 2007; Bourque et al., 2008; Kuwabara
et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2009). Furthermore, genome-wide methylation status is often assessed
through analysis of CpG islands located in the 5’ UTRs of LINE-1 elements, which are typically
heavily methylated (Woodcock et al., 1997), contributing to their quiescence in most somatic tissue types. Through this assay, a wide variety of cancers are found to be hypomethylated (Ogino
et al., 2011), leading us to speculate that retrotransposition rates may be substantially increased
in certain cancer types or samples.
In order to test this hypothesis, we took advantage of whole-genome sequence data available
through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA is an ongoing multi-institutional effort that will
eventually include whole genome sequence data for hundreds of tumors and corresponding normal
samples for over 20 different cancer types. Here, we consider transposable element insertions in the
genomes of three cancer types: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (TCGA Research Network, 2008),
ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) (TCGA Research Network, 2011), and colon/rectal adenocarcinoma (COAD/READ) (Muzny et al., 2012), and present evidence for substantially increased
retrotransposition in colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Results

We developed a computational pipeline (discord-retro, http://github.com/adamewing/discord-retro)
to detect non-reference retrotransposon insertions from paired end whole genome sequencing data
by using mate-pair information from discordantly mapped read pairs (see Methods). We measured
the detection characteristics of our application by repeatedly inserting 100 retrotransposons into
the euchromatic portion of human chr22 at random positions, generating paired reads, mapping to
the GRCh37 reference sequence, and applying our method (see Methods for details). We observe
87.9% sensitivity with perfect specificity when insertions into other insertions of the same class (e.g.
LINE into a LINE or Alu into an Alu) are discarded, and 94.5% sensitivity and perfect specificity
if these insertions are allowed. Using discord-retro, we analyzed 33 high coverage (>30x) tumor
and normal genome pairs produced by TCGA, and identified retrotransposon insertions not found
in the human reference genome (NCBI36 or GRCh37). For high coverage data, the tumor and
patient-matched normal paired-end sequence data were combined in order to distinguish between
a non-reference germline insertion, which would be found in both tissues, from a somatic insertion,
which would be found only in the tumor (or normal) DNA. Refinement of junctions using local
assembly and analysis of soft-clipped reads allowed breakpoint-resolution on one or both ends of
a predicted insertion. In 45% of cases, we identified target site duplications (TSDs), a short duplication of sequence around the insertion site that occur as a byproduct of target primed reverse
transcription.

2.1

Germline Insertions

Across the 33 tumor/normal pairs, we identified 7022 non-reference retrotransposon insertions
present in both the tumor and corresponding normal genome, of which 3273 overlapped with a
previous study (Wang et al., 2006; Beck et al., 2010; Ewing and Kazazian, 2010; Hormozdiari et al.,
2010a; Iskow et al., 2010; Witherspoon et al., 2010; Ewing and Kazazian, 2011; Stewart et al., 2011)
(Fig S1). Of all insertions detected, 727 were LINE insertions, 6101 were Alu insertions and 189
were SVA insertions. Of the 3749 previously uncataloged insertions, 350 were LINE-1 elements,
3220 were Alu elements, and 177 were SVA elements. For every tumor/normal pair we detected an
average of 111 LINEs, 823 Alus, and 36 SVAs (Fig. 1). We detected an average of 8.4 LINE, 79.6
Alu and 1.9 SVA insertions that were present in only one sample. The chromosomal distribution
of insertions is illustrated in Figure 2.

2.2

Somatic Insertions

Somatic insertions are those occuring exclusively in either the tumor or normal sample of a patientmatched pair of genomes and also not present in any other sample or catalogue of retrotransposon
insertions from a previous study. Furthermore, because we combine discordant read pairs across
both the tumor and normal tissue for an individual, we can be sure that if a tumor-specific or
normal-specific call is made, not a single read that could indicate the presence of the insertion
exists in the other sample. We found 72 tumor-specific LINE-1 insertions from 4 colon cancer
tumor/normal pairs and none from any of the 18 GBM and 10 OV tumor/normal pairs (Fig. 3).
Conversely, for the four samples with tumor-specific insertions, we found very few insertions present
only in the normal sample (Fig. S2). For one sample, TCGA-AA-A00R, there was an abnormally
high number of normal-specific predictions which we believe to be an artifact. The distribution of
insertion lengths for the tumor-specific LINE-1 insertions differs markedly from insertions found
in both the tumor and normal tissues (Fig. 4). Of 655 LINE-1 insertions present in both tumor

3

and normal genomes, 147 were full length, defined here as 5.8 kb of greater as indicated by the
minimum and maximum mapping locations of paired reads within the reference elements, which
resembles the distribution expected from the length distribution in the reference genome (Grimaldi
et al., 1984; Pavlı́cek et al., 2002). In contrast, only 2 out of 72 tumor-specific LINE-1 insertions
were full-length (p < 9.68 × 10−6 , Fisher’s exact test).
Of the 72 tumor-specific insertions, one occurred in the 3’ UTR of PPP1R1C (protein phosphatase 1, regulator subunit 1C), and 22 occurred in introns, including an insertion in NAV3, a
gene associated with colon cancer (Carlsson et al., 2012). The NAV3 insertion occurs in patient
TCGA-AA-3518 115 bp downstream of the third exon in the same orientation as the gene in a
region overlapped by DNAse hypersensitivity and H3K27 acetylation signals (Fig. S3), indicating possible regulatory elements nearby. An examination of gene expression levels (Agilent 244K
Custom Gene Expression G4502A-07-3) between the tumor and normal insertions was carried out
using the UCSC Cancer Genome Browser (Zhu et al., 2009), which indicated lower expression of
NAV3 and other genes containing tumor-specific insertions (notably A2BP1, and CTNNA2 ) in the
tumor relative to the patient-matched normal colon tissue (Fig. 5). Here we focus further analysis on NAV3, as decreases in its expression are frequent in colorectal adenomas (Carlsson et al.,
2012). Analysis of Agilent expression data from TCGA-AA-3518 shows the difference in expression
between NAV3 in tumor and normal tissues is ranked at the 93rd percentile relative to differences
between all other genes in the same tumor/normal pair. To ascertain whether other somatic mutations might be responsible for the observed change in expression, we compared NAV3 and the
surrounding region between cancer and normal genomes of TCGA-AA-3518 using the BamBam
algorithm (Z. Sanborn, unpublished). We detected evidence for 9 potentially cancer-specific SNPs
in the 382 kbp region (Fig. S4), but we found no evidence for point mutations or CNVs in exons
or in the proximal upstream region likely to have an obvious effect on transcript abundance apart
from the L1 insertion.

2.3

Similarity to reference elements

After acquiring a set of insertion predictions for each sample, we sought to determine the closest
element in the reference genome in terms of sequence similarity, as this may represent an element
similar to the active progenitor element. In general, it is unlikely that the true progenitor can be
identified through sequence similarity alone, as the active elements in the human reference genome
diverge from one another by less than 1% (Brouha et al., 2003; Seleme et al., 2006; Beck et al.,
2010). That said, identification of the most similar elements in the human reference genome based
on local re-assembly of the elements detected by discord-retro yields an enrichment of full-length,
intact, human L1 elements, some of which are known to be active elements (Table 1). This serves
as further evidence to substantiate our claim that our report of 72 tumor-specific L1 insertions in
4 colon cancer cases are novel insertions derived from active L1 elements.

Discussion

As TCGA and others continue to sequence more cancer and paired normal cases across a wider
number of cancer types, we may uncover clear driver mutations caused by transposable elements
and other cancer types that exhibit high levels of insertional mutagenesis by transposable elements.
It is remarkable that TE activity appears so much higher in colorectal adenocarcinomas than in
glioblastoma multiforme or ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma, but the specific mechanism behind
this tissue specificity has eluded us so far. An intronic insertion in NAV3 seemes to be paired with
a marked decrease in gene expression, although it is far from clear if there is a direct relationship
4

between the presence of somatic LINE-1 insertions and the expression decrease in cases like this.
Given that a survey of other somatic mutations in and surrounding NAV3 yielded nothing that
stood out as a possibly expression-altering mutation, and an insertion in NAV3 occured only 112
bp downstream of an exon in a region with an epigenetic profile indicating regulatory potential, we
posit that the LINE-1 insertion may be responsible for the cancer-specific decrease in expression in
this instance.
Our general knowledge of somatic retrotransposition is limited, although new technologies and
the decreasing cost of sequencing will likely provide new insights in the near future as sequencing
studies begin to focus on multiple tissues from a single donor individual. In most respects, the
somatic tumor-specific insertions detected by our method are similar to germline insertions, with
the notable exception of their length: 97.2% of tumor-specific insertions are truncated as compared
to a 77.6% truncation rate for germline insertions (insertions detected in both normal and cancer
samples). The mechanism for L1 truncation is unknown; conjectures include the presence of an
endo- or exonuclease that targets the L1 RNA template, or a factor that interferes with reversetranscription. At this stage the etiology of element truncation in colon tumors and how it differs
from normal or germline tissue is unknown. It may be illuminating to work out why tumor-specific
insertions are more severely truncated than those in the germline as a future study and whether
this is a general characterisic of somatic retrotransposition or if there is some connection to tumor
biology.
This is an exciting time for transposable element biology given our improving ability to explore
entire genomes. In this case, whole-genome paired-end sequencing has allowed us to detect somatic
retrotransposition in cancer genomes, an observation that opens many new questions regarding the
role of mobile DNA in carcinogenesis and tumor molecular biology. As sequencing technologies
and out ability to detect structural variants improve, so will our ability to characterize new TE
insertions and their parent elements, perhaps gaining further insight on what leads to tissue or
disease specific TE activation.

Methods

A number of successful computational methods have been devised capable of detecting transposable element insertions from whole-genome sequence data including VariationHunter2 (Hormozdiari et al., 2010b), T-lex (Fiston-Lavier et al., 2011), RetroSeq (https://github.com/tk2/RetroSeq),
HYDRA-SV (Quinlan et al., 2010), and Tea (Lee et al., 2012). The approach outlined here, implemented as discord-retro, has the advantage of working directly from the ubiquitous .bam sequence
alignment format (as does RetroSeq) with minimal need for additional mapping apart from that
required to identify insertion breakpoints. Here, we give a high-level overview of our method. Sequence data analyzed in this study was generated on the Illumina platform and aligned to a human
reference assembly (NCBI36 or GRCh37) by TCGA Research Network members at TCGA Genome
Sequencing Centers.
Paired-end reads can be classified based on how they map to the reference genome. A read
pair is called concordant if both reads map the proper distance apart and in the correct orientation
for the insert size and procedure used in the library preparation and sequencing, and discordant if
these conditions are not met. For example, ends of a discordant paired read may map to different
chromosomes, too far apart, too close together, or in the wrong orientation. A second type of
improperly paired reads are ones in which one read maps to the reference, but its pair does not.
These reads are referred to as one-end-anchored (OEA). Lastly, reads are called soft-clipped when
part of the read aligns to the reference sequence, but either or both ends of the read do not.

5

We first selected all discordant reads from both the tumor and normal sequencing data of a
patient where one read of the pair maps to a unique portion of the genome, called the “anchored”
read, and the other end maps to a repeatmasker annotation elsewhere in the genome. We will refer
to these types of read-pairs as one-end-repeat (OER) reads. We filtered elements corresponding to
AluS and LTR elements from the results due to an overabundance of calls with no corresponding
breakpoint predictions in some samples. Regions where the uniquely mapped ends of the OER
reads clustered in two peaks with opposite orientation were considered consistent with an insertion
existing between the two clusters of OER reads. We require there to be 8 OER read pairs within
a 500bp window, and for there to be at least 2 uniquely mapped or “anchored” reads on either
strand. The requirement that both breakpoints (5’ and 3’ junctions) be covered by paired reads
reduces the chance of incorrectly annotating a segmental duplication, translocation, or inversion as
a transposable element insertion.
The selection of clustered discordant OER reads yields a set of 20-50bp windows as predicted
transposable element insertion sites. These were annotated as “germline” if there were discordant
reads in both the tumor and normal tissue samples, as “somatic/cancer” if there were contributing
discordant reads only in the tumor tissue, and as “somatic/normal” if there were contributing discordant reads only in the normal tissue. Insertion loci are cross-referenced against retrotransposon
insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) cataloged in previous studies (Wang et al., 2006; Beck et al., 2010;
Ewing and Kazazian, 2010; Hormozdiari et al., 2010a; Iskow et al., 2010; Witherspoon et al., 2010;
Ewing and Kazazian, 2011; Stewart et al., 2011) and against each other. As breakpoint resolution
varies across studies, insertions within the same 500bp window were considered overlapping. A
total of 14 (16%) potentially tumor-specific insertions were eliminated by comparison to known
RIPs and RIPs found in this study.

4.1

Breakpoint refinement using soft-clipped reads

Soft-clipped reads mapped using bwa (Li and Durbin, 2009) could be used to pinpoint a breakpoint
in the insertion site. For each of the 14 samples aligned with bwa (Table S1), soft-clipped reads
mapping within 500bp of each of the predicted insertion sites and which had greater than 10 bp
clipped from the read were used to find a consensus breakpoint where a majority of soft-clipped
read ends occurred at the same nucleotide in the reference genome. When breakpoints for both
the 5’ and 3’ junctions between the element and the reference genome were detected, we identified
target site duplications when the breakpoint on the forward strand occured 3-50bp downstream of
the breakpoint on the reverse strand.

4.2

Breakpoint refinement with local assembly

We used a local assembly and realignment strategy to determine breakpoints for all samples. All
discordant and soft-clipped reads within 500bp of a predicted insertion site were assembled using
Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) with a k-mer size of 31, the shortPaired option, and insert length
of 300. If the reads assembled into 5 contigs or less, these contigs were mapped back to the reference
genome using BLAT. A cutoff of 5 contigs was chosen because when more contigs were present,
they were generally too short to be more informative than the original reads. After mapping the
assembled contigs back to the reference assembly, breakpoints present as the point where a contig
no longer matches the reference sequence and begins matching a reference retroelement sequence.
Target site duplications could be ascertained in cases where two assembled contigs had overlapping
alignments to the predicted insertion site on opposite strands.

Simulation

To measure the accuracy and sensitivity of our pipeline, we inserted 100 LINE, SINE, and SVA
sequences randomly into the euchromatic sequence of chr22 from hg19/GRCh37. The retroelement
sequences were randomly truncated on the 5’ end up to 75% of the original element length for
LINEs and SVAs, and 25% for Alus. Poly(A) tails between 20 and 70bp in length were added to
the 3’ end, and 12bp of the target insertion site was duplicated on the 5’ junction to mimic target
site duplications. Paired Illumina reads were simulated via wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim)
to generate paired 75bp reads at 30x coverage. These reads were mapped back to the reference
genome using bwa (Li and Durbin, 2009) with the following parameters: -q 5 -l 32 -k 2 -t 4
-o 1, alignments were processed with samtools (Li et al., 2009) and used as input to discord-retro.

4.4

Assessing sequence similarity to reference elements

We performed local sequence assembly as described in section 4.2 to generate contigs corresponding
to inserted sequences. BLAT alignments of the contigs were carried out to find the most closely
related elements in the reference genome. Repeatmasker-annotated elements were scored by the sum
of the products of the percent identity of a BLAT alignment and the length of the alignment for each
contig that overlapped the repeat masked element. The element with the highest score was predicted
to be the source element for the new insertion, excluding elements within 1000bp of the insertion site.
Elements scoring within 20 percent-identity bases of the highest score were considered as potential
progenitors as well. In cases where there were several repeat elements tied for the highest score
or very close to the highest score, the progenitor is considered ambiguous. We ranked the repeat
masked elements by the number of times they were predicted to be a progenitor for an somatic
insertion, whether ambiguous or not, and examined the top 10 elements for retrotransposition
capability.

Figure 4: The lengths of non-reference L1 insertions detected in this study, binned in 200bp

in a previous study, or found in multiple patients, and somatic/cancer insertions are found only
in the tumor tissue of a single patient. There is a significant difference between the proportion
of L1 germline insertions that are full length (>5.8kbp) and the proportion of somatic/cancer L1
insertions that are full length (p-value=9.68 x 10-6).

Table 1: Contigs of inserted sequence were assembled for some cancer-specific transposable element
(TE) insertions and aligned back to the reference genome using BLAT. Repeat masker annotated
elements from the reference genome are listed according to the number of times they have the
highest sequence similarity to an insertions contigs compared to all other repeat masker annotated
elements (Best Related Insertions). The number of times an element has within 20 mismatches of
the highest sequence similarity to an insertions contigs (in essence, is the most similar or a close
second), is also listed (Related Insertions).
