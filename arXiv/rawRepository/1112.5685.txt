Abstract – To maintain bone mass during bone remodelling, coupling is required between bone resorption
and bone formation. This coordination is achieved by a network of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules
between cells of the osteoclast lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of signalling
between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of experimental data, clarify signalling interactions
and help develop a deeper understanding of complex bone diseases. Several mathematical models of bone
cell interactions have been developed, some including RANK–RANKL–OPG signalling between cells and systemic
parathyroid hormone PTH. However, to our knowledge these models do not currently include key aspects of some
more recent biological evidence for anabolic responses. In this paper, we further develop a mathematical model
of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) [1] to include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the
model. This inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to play an important role in
anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased
rate of proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone mass. However, modelling
these different processes separately enables the new model to represent recent experimental discoveries such
as the role of Wnt signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells by transforming
growth factor β. Finally, we illustrate the power of the new model’s capabilities by applying the model to prostate
cancer metastasis to bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to release some of
the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone remodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer
cells to disrupt normal signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to either bone
gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model developed here is capable of capturing
some key observations made on the evolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone
microenvironment.

Introduction

to bone, are associated with the dysregulation of this coupling process leading to abnormal bone loss or bone gain.
Mathematical modelling can be employed to interpret experimental data, clarify signalling interactions, investigate
therapeutic interventions, and to generally better understand bone remodelling from a systems perspective [11].

Bone is a dynamic living tissue which continuously undergoes remodelling to ensure mineral homeostasis and to
repair micro damage [2, 3]. The two main bone cell types
executing bone remodelling are osteoclasts which resorb
the mineralised bone matrix and osteoblasts which deposit
osteoid (which subsequently becomes mineralised) [3].
The third cell type involved in bone remodelling are osteocytes (i.e., terminally differentiated cells derived from
mature osteoblasts that have been trapped in the mineralised bone matrix [4]). The entire ensemble of bone cells
contributing to bone remodelling is referred to as basic
multicellular unit (BMU) [5, 6].
Within the BMU, pre-osteoblasts, which express RANKL
have been hypothesised to control the differentiation of
osteoclasts from hematopoietic progenitors [7–10]. The
bone resorption phase is subsequently followed by bone
formation, driven in part, by factors produced by the
osteoclast that stimulate osteoblastogenesis [9]. This coupling between resorption and formation phase in BMUs is
required to maintain bone mass. Many bone pathologies,
such as osteoporosis, Paget’s disease and cancer metastasis

Bone remodelling has been represented mathematically
in a variety of ways including bone cell population models
(ODEs) [1,12, 13], continuum models (PDEs) [14–16] and
discrete cell models [17, 18]. The bone cell population
model by Lemaire et al. [13] proposes an interesting approach based on fundamental chemical reaction principles
such as material balance and mass action kinetics. This
model incorporates some of the most important bone biology known at that time. Extensions to include further
components of bone biology can be formulated using the
same framework. We have used this framework to include
new knowledge in bone biology in our bone cell population
model [1] (such as the expression of RANKL and OPG by
osteoblasts of various maturities) [1], and to introduce
a spatial variation in cells numbers to represent a single
basic multicellular unit [15]. We have also applied the
model by Pivonka et al. [1] to examine possible therapeutic
interventions to restore bone mass following dysregulation
of the RANK–RANKL–OPG signalling system [19], coupled

nuclear size, Roberts et al. [30] have characterised four
precursor cell types to the functional osteoblast. This differentiation pathway has been confirmed (and refined) by
marker expression in vitro using functional assays [32, 33].
Asymmetrically-dividing mesenchymal stem cells recruited
to the BMU give rise to a population of osteoblast progenitors that are proliferating extensively (undergoing symmetric division). These osteoblast progenitors differentiate into
pre-osteoblasts that undergo limited proliferation. Finally,
pre-osteoblasts differentiate in turn into non-proliferative
active osteoblasts [32].

this model to a pharmacokinetic model of denosumab to
explore the effect of different dosing regimes [20], and
studied osteolytic lesions in multiple myeloma [21].
However, while the model by Pivonka et al. [1] does
some things well, it does not capture the anabolic effects of
precursor osteoblast proliferation. Recent experimental evidence suggests that Wnt signalling is a critically important
regulator of bone remodelling—Wnt signalling plays an important role in normal bone homeostasis under varying mechanical loading, and excessive Wnt signalling is responsible
for some osteopetrotic (excess) bone states [22, 23]. In addition, recent clinical evidence demonstrates that administration of intermittent PTH is an effective anabolic intervention [23, 24]. The exact molecular mechanisms leading to
anabolic responses under intermittent PTH administration
are incompletely understood and probably multifactorial,
involving differential regulations of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis [23]. While we do not
model intermittent PTH administration in this paper, it is
important to include these three cellular behaviours regulating the number of osteoblasts for future investigations.
In this paper, we thus further develop the model by Pivonka
et al [1] by introducing the proliferation of osteoblasts in a
way such that the new model is consistent with the original
model and can incorporate osteoblast proliferation through
W nt signalling or via other signalling systems. We then
explore the effect of parameter changes in the new model
on net bone balance, and see that the new model is capable
of effectively representing osteopetrotic bone disease states
arising from disruption of normal osteoblastic proliferation.
Finally we illustrate the capabilities of the new model in
a complex bone disease that arises when prostate cancer
cells metastasise to the bone microenvironment. This
disease is characterised by a variable phenotype that often
involves net bone gain (coupled with focal bone loss) [25–
27], and finally net bone loss. We show that the new model
developed here can model bone gain and bone loss via
secretion of signalling molecules such as Wnt, PSA and PTHrP
by the prostate cancer cells.

Current bone biology literature identifies the central
role played by the Wnt signalling pathway in regulating
osteoblast development (Figure 1). Wnts are a family
of over 20 secreted glycoproteins crucial for the development and homeostatic renewal of many tissues, including
bone [34]. Wnts stimulate canonical or non-canonical
signalling pathways by binding a receptor complex consisting of LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6
and one of ten Frizzled (Fz) molecules [35]. There are a
range of soluble ‘decoy molecules’ secreted that regulate
W nt signalling including sclerostin, D kk1,2,3 and S FRP 1,2,3.
The canonical Wnt signalling pathway has been the most
extensively studied Wnt signalling pathway in osteoblasts.
Wnt activation involves the stabilization of β-catenin (via
inhibition of the GSK-3β, axin and APC complex), resulting
in the translocation of β-catenin TCF/LEF to the cell nucleus
and activation of various downstream transcription factors
critical for directing cell lineage and subsequent cell proliferation [36]. Wnt signalling has three major functions
in osteoblastic lineage cells: (i) dictating osteoblast specification from osteo-/chondroprogenitors; (ii) stimulating
osteoblast proliferation; and (iii) enhancing osteoblast and
osteocyte survival (Figure 1).
This brief overview of osteoblast development and the
importance of Wnt signalling highlights the complexity of
potential bone cell interactions. A systems biology approach to bone remodelling can help understand these
interconnections and their importance for functional bone
remodelling [11]. It is only recently that a few mathematical models of interacting bone cells have been developed to
explore these fundamental aspects of the bone remodelling
sequence.

Background

A recent review by Khosla et al. highlights the importance
of osteoblast development in the regulation of bone remodelling and the potential for therapeutic interventions
that target the osteoblastic lineage [28]. Osteoblasts are
mesenchymal cells derived from the mesoderm. Sequential
expression of several molecules (such as R UNX2 and O SX),
driven by signal transduction pathways, facilitates the differentiation of the progenitor cell into a proliferating preosteoblast, then into a bone matrix-producing osteoblast,
and eventually into a mechanosensory osteocyte or a bonelining cell (see Figure 1). As the cells of the osteoblastic
lineage differentiate, they produce molecules essential for
regulating BMU operation, including support of osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis in a BMU. Active osteoblasts
secrete osteoid, which later mineralises to bone, while
osteocytes produce molecules that regulate BMU function.
The most extensively studied cell-kinetic model of osteoblast development is that of mechanically induced bone

In Lemaire et al. [13], a bone cell population model for
bone remodelling is proposed and applied to the study of
bone diseases and therapeutic strategies. To restore bone
mass following catabolic pathologies (such as due to estrogen deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, and senescence), the
generation of pre-osteoblasts by differentiation is shown
by this model to be a powerful bone formative strategy.
This occurs despite coupling of formation to resorption
through cells of osteoblastic lineage expressing RANKL,
which binds to the RANK receptor of osteoclasts thereby
promoting osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The
computational model of bone remodelling of Lemaire et al.
has been refined by Pivonka et al. [1] who investigated the
effect of RANKL and OPG expression profiles on cells of the
osteoblastic lineage.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of dif2

ferent developmental stages of osteoblasts on bone remodelling. For this purpose, we include a transient-amplifying
(i.e. proliferating) stage in the osteoblastic lineage in the
bone cell population model of Pivonka et al. [1]. The
motivation for this inclusion is twofold:

MSC s

to the osteoblastic lineage,

Description of the model

For simplicity, osteoblast progenitors and pre-osteoblasts
are pooled into a single proliferative cell type in our
model, which we call pre-osteoblast and denote by OBp .
Three stages of osteoblast development and two stages of
osteoclast development are included in the cell population
model.

1. It is known that the density of MSCs in bone marrow
is very low, and though MSCs are recruited to the BMU
site by TGFβ [37], it is likely the models of Refs [1, 13]
rely on an unphysiological recruitment of a sufficient
number of pre-osteoblasts for the stimulation of a
sustained formative response. The fast increase in
osteoblast population required in a BMU remodelling
event is believed to involve proliferative cells (undergoing symmetric cell division), i.e., so-called transientamplifying osteoblast progenitors [38].

Osteoclasts. Pre-osteoclasts (OCp s) represent circulating
cells of hematopoietic origin. Pre-osteoclasts are assumed
to mature into active osteoclasts (OCa s) upon activation of
their RANK receptor by the ligand RANKL. Active osteoclasts
are cells that resorb bone matrix at a rate kres assumed
constant (in volume per unit time). In the model, OCa s are
assumed to undergo apoptosis at a rate enhanced by the
presence of TGFβ [1, 9, 15]. Thus, osteoclast development
can be summed up schematically as:

2. Hormones and cytokines regulate stages of osteoblast
development differently. The transient-amplifying
stage of osteoblasts is known to be strongly dependent on various hormones, growth factors and other
molecules, such as Wnt, insulin-like growth factor
(IGF), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and estrogen [38–40].
The anabolic effect of intermittent PTH is believed to
operate through multifactorial regulation of osteoblast
generation at several developmental stages [23]. Also,
in some bone diseases, signalling by these hormones
and growth factors is disrupted, leading to an abnormal population of osteoblasts and a subsequent
imbalance of bone during remodelling. For these
reasons, a more accurate account of the transientamplifying stage of osteoblasts is essential for the
realistic modelling of such diseases.

Osteoblasts. Uncommitted osteoblast progenitors (OBu s)
represent a pool of MSCs. These MSCs are assumed to commit to the osteoblastic lineage by becoming pre-osteoblasts
(OBp s) through activation of TGFβ signalling. In the model,
OB p s represent transient-amplifying osteoblast progenitors
and they are therefore assumed to proliferate. Their
maturation into active osteoblasts (OBa s) is assumed to be
downregulated by TGFβ. Active osteoblasts are cells that
form bone matrix at a rate kform assumed constant (in
volume per unit time). The fate of active osteoblasts is
either (i) to be buried in osteoid and become osteocytes;
(ii) to undergo apoptosis; or (iii) to become bone-lining
cells covering the surface of newly-formed bone. In our
model, the elimination of an OBa depletes the pool of
matrix-synthesising cells and thereby includes all three
possibilities. Thus, osteoblast development can be summed
up schematically as:

However, we find that the inclusion of OBp proliferation
proposed in this paper has to be treated with some care
as it can lead both to an unstable dynamic system (not
converging to a steady state with finite cell densities) and to
potentially unphysiological system behaviour, for example
an anabolic response to continuous PTH administration,
which is experimentally known to be catabolic. These
issues are addressed in detail in this paper.

a nonlinear function of the free ligand concentration, the
overall relationship between concentration of extracellular
ligand L and cell response in Eqs (6)–(9) is nonlinear.
The rate equations governing the concentrations of TGFβ,
RANK , RANKL , OPG and PTH are solved under the approximation that receptor–ligand binding reactions occur on a fast
timescale compared to cell responses. These equations are
presented in Appendix A.
The proliferation term POBp OBp in Eq. (4) has been added
to the original system of equations of Ref. [1] to account
for the transient-amplifying stage of osteoblasts. This term
involves the proliferation rate POBp (t), which is related to

are themselves influenced by cellular actions. The
growth factor TGFβ is assumed to be stored in the bone
matrix and released into the microenvironment in active
form by the resorbing OCa s [9, 37, 41]. The ligand RANKL is
assumed to be expressed on the surface of OBp s. However
this expression can be blocked by binding to OPG, which
in turn is assumed to be produced in soluble form by
OB a s [10, 42]. The generation of RANKL and of OPG by
osteoblasts is respectively upregulated and downregulated
by the systemic hormone PTH.

In Eqs (3)–(5), source and sink terms are specified according to transformation rates between cell types with first

of OBu s into OBa s activated by TGFβ, and DOBp (t) is the
differentiation rate of OBp s into OBa s repressed by TGFβ.
The elimination rate of active osteoblasts, AOBa , is assumed
unregulated and constant: AOBa (t) ≡ AOBa . Activation and
repression of these rates by RANKL or TGFβ is expressed in

where BV stands for the volume fraction of bone matrix
in a representative volume element at the tissue scale.2
The quantity kres OCa represents the resorption rate (bone
volume fraction resorbed per unit time) and the quantity
kform OBa represents the formation rate (bone volume fraction formed per unit time). All the parameter values of the
model are listed in Appendix B (Table 1).
The system of ODEs (3)–(5) together with Eqs. (27)–
(31) form a closed system that can be solved for the time
evolution of the three state variables OBp , OBa and OCa from
an initial condition. Eq. (11) can then be integrated to
provide the time evolution of the bone volume fraction.
Clearly, BV(t) is not a function of the current state only as
it depends on the integrated history of OCa (t) and OBa (t).
However, the bone volume fraction change rate ∂∂t BV is a
function of the current state and will be a major model
output followed in this paper.

Regulation of OBp proliferation. In a single BMU, thousands of active osteoblasts refill the cavity created by the
osteoclasts [3, 5]. Their continual recruitment from preosteoblasts occurs at a rate that varies with the rate of
resorption. For a BMU that advances in bone at 40 µm/day,
an estimated rate of 120 active osteoblasts per day is
necessary to ensure that the whole perimeter of the BMU
cavity is covered by the bone refilling cells [3]. This
required recruitment rate of active osteoblasts is achieved
by a combination of differentiation from mesenchymal
stem cells near the tip of the blood vessel, and proliferation
of pre-osteoblasts between the blood vessel and cavity
walls [30, 32, 44]. Active osteoblasts in BMUs usually form

. (10)

These functional forms of πact and πrep are based on the
following assumptions. Ligands such as RANKL and TGFβ
modulate cell behaviours by binding to specific receptors on
the cells and triggering intracellular signalling pathways.
Following Refs [1, 13, 15], we assume that the signal
received by a cell corresponds to the fraction of occupied
receptors on the cell. This fraction is equal to πact (L/k),
where L is the extracellular ligand concentration and k
a binding parameter (dissociation binding constant) [43].
We do not model intracellular pathways explicitly but
relate a cell’s response to its input signal by assuming
a phenomenological relationship. Here, we assume that
a cell responds in proportion to receptor occupancy, i.e.
either in proportion to πact (for activation) or to πrep

1
Such a relationship has been shown to hold experimentally for
example in the context of human fibroblasts stimulated by epidermal
growth factor (EGF): the mitogenic response of these fibroblasts is linearly
dependent on the fraction of occupied EGF receptors [43, Fig. 6-7, p.249].
2
The volume fraction of bone matrix is also equal to 1 − Φ where Φ is
the ‘bone porosity’, i.e., the volume fraction of soft tissues (marrow, cells,
stroma) (compare with Ref. [3, Eq. (3.7)]).

a single layer of cells [45], and so are limited in number
by the available bone surface area. It is likely that feedback
control mechanisms regulate pre-osteoblast proliferation to
limit the generation of active osteoblasts. We model this
control of cell population by limiting the proliferation rate
of pre-osteoblasts with the density of pre-osteoblasts, i.e.:

Pre-osteoblasts generation: differentiation vs proliferation. Differentiation from MSCs and proliferation of preosteoblasts are two different biological mechanisms that
enable the population of osteoblasts to reach the size
required in a BMU for functional remodelling. The relative
proportion of these two mechanisms in vivo has not been
quantified experimentally. Proliferation is a mechanism
that exponentially inflates any deviation in the original
population size. Proliferation thus provides a sensitive
control of the population and the potential for a quick

The steady-state cell densities represented by the model
correspond to physiological cell densities (averaged at the
tissue level) of a normal, healthy adult whose skeleton
undergoes remodelling. While a baseline of mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoetic stem cells is implicitly
assumed, a bone remodelling event is not necessarily induced. Indeed, the system of ODEs (3)–(5) governing
the evolution of OBp (t), OBa (t), and OCa (t) always admits
vanishing bone cell densities as a solution, whatever the
density of OBu s and of OCp s.
Specific signalling is required to commit these stem cells
to the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineage. The induction
of a bone remodelling event appears to be a complicated
and poorly-understood process, that first requires bone lining cells retracting from the bone surface, and is followed
by the recruitment of osteoclasts on site. Our model is
not capable of modelling this induction process. However,
the specific signalling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts
mediated by RANKL and TGFβ forms a positive feedback loop
that leads any initial population of pre-osteoblasts or active
osteoclasts to a steady state characterised by positive cell
densitites OBp , OBa , OCa [1, 15].

OPG , which binds competitively to RANKL . This reduces
the initial increase in RANKL signalling back to near-normal
levels. Another limiting factor for osteoclastogenesis by
RANKL signalling is the limited number of RANK receptors
on OCp s. The generation rate of active osteoclasts saturates
when all RANK receptors on OCp s are bound to RANKL.
It is noteworthy that the RANK–RANKL–OPG signalling
patway exhibits a pronounced ‘catabolic bias’ in the bone
remodelling models developed by Lemaire et al. [13] and
by Pivonka et al. [1, 19], while pre-osteoblast proliferation
exhibit a “complementary” ‘anabolic bias’ in the present
model. We emphasise that depending on the individual,
such biases may not be as pronounced in practice as the
models suggest. In the models, these biases can be partially
explained by the rapid saturation of the receptor–ligand
binding reaction rates (similarly to Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics) that limit the cells’ response to extracellular
ligands (via the ‘activator’ and ‘repressor’ functions πact and
πrep ). As a consequence, cell behaviour is asymmetrical in
response to an increase or to a decrease of extracellular
ligands. The strength of this asymmetry depends on where
on the curves πact and πrep the normal state is assumed
to be. Normal ligand concentrations are likely to differ
across indivuals. In some individuals, this normal ligand
concentration may lie closer to the initial linear part, or
final saturated part of the functions πact , πrep than in other
individuals, and in this way, lead to a less pronounced
asymmetry of the cell’s response.

Anabolic potential of pre-osteoblast proliferation. Our
previous investigations of the bone remodelling model of
Ref. [1] have revealed that the RANK–RANKL–OPG pathway
is effective at inducing catabolic behaviour in response to
an increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio, but not effective at
inducing anabolic behaviour in response to a decrease in
the RANKL/OPG ratio [19]. By contrast, Figure 2 shows
that increasing POBp from a normal state with steady bone
volume is very effective at inducing an anabolic behaviour
of bone remodelling. But decreasing POBp from this state
is not effective at inducing a catabolic behaviour of bone
remodelling, even at high fractions ν.
The strong anabolic potential of pre-osteoblast proliferation occurs despite pre-osteoblasts expressing RANKL, which
by binding to the RANK receptor of osteoclasts promotes
osteoclast activation. This is similar to the bone formative
therapeutic strategy investigated by Lemaire et al. [13].
In fact, the dynamics shows that active osteoclasts are
only transiently increased by an increase in pre-osteoblast
density. The increase in OBp s (which promotes osteoclastogenesis by increasing RANKL signalling to OCp s) is followed
by a delayed increase in OBa s. The latter cells produce

Response to ‘continuous’ PTH administration. The inclusion of OBp proliferation into the model introduces an
additional mechanism for osteoblastogenesis. The relative
importance of this additional mechanism is represented by
the parameter ν introduced in Section 3. High fractions ν
emphasise proliferation, which makes the model sensitive
to small variations in the initial populations. Depending on
the value of ν, different system behaviours may arise, as
illustrated in the following.
While an increase in pre-osteoblast proliferation is
observed to induce a strong anabolic response for a
6

broad range of fractions ν (Figure 2), the magnitude of
the catabolic response to ‘continuous’ PTH administration
(which increases the RANKL/OPG ratio), is strongly dependent on the choice of ν and OBsat
p . Figure 3 shows the
steady-state resorption and formation rates reached by the
model for four combinations of (ν, OBsat
p ) (Fig. 3(a)–(d))
under two externally-driven influences:
(i) An altered value of the
ter POBp (blue curve).

OB p

and increases the OBp population. If OBp proliferation
is significant, this increase in OBp is amplified strongly
and eventually overcomes PTH-induced osteoclastogenesis,
which leads to an anabolic behaviour. As this behaviour
is not observed in vivo for continuous PTH administration,
it can be expected that the proliferative potential of preosteoblasts is normally limited to the negative angle region
in Figure 4. We estimate that the balance between OBu differentiation and OBp proliferation is probably somewhere
in the range 0.4 ® ν ® 0.6. This imposes a strong upper
limit to the parameter OBsat
p (see Figure 4). For an angle
◦
sat
≈ −4.5 , one has OBp ® 0.005 pM.
Finally, we note that intermittent PTH administration may
exert an action on a variety of regulatory pathways of bone
remodelling [23]. An overall anabolic response may be
obtained as a combined effects of anabolic and catabolic
disruptions of bone remodelling. This is the case for
example of point D in Figure 3(a), where the superposition
of an upregulation of pre-osteoblast proliferation and a
catabolic response to PTH administration still leads to an
overall anabolic response.

In Figure 3, the alteration of OBp proliferation may represents an alteration in the Wnt pathway. Continuous PTH
administration increases the concentration of PTH and thus
increases the RANKL/OPG ratio (see Eqs. (28), (30)), which
promotes osteoclastogenesis. It is well-known that continuous PTH administration leads to a catabolic response.
Strikingly, Figure 3(b) and (c) exhibit two examples of pairs
(ν, OBsat
p ) that lead to an (as far as the authors are aware;
unphysiological) anabolic behaviour in response to an increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio from the normal state. Decreasing OBsat
p and/or ν can restore the expected catabolic
behaviour. This is seen by comparing Figure 3(b)→(a)
(decrease in OBsat
p ) and Figure 3(c)→(d) (decrease in ν).

5

The possibility for such unphysiological anabolic behaviour is new compared to the models by Lemaire et
al. [13] and Pivonka et al. [1]. However, this variability
may be advantageous, allowing the system to be adjusted
to specific patients or patient groups responding differently
to increased PTH. The anabolic or catabolic behaviour of
the model in response to increased RANKL/OPG ratio can
be measured in Figure 3 by the angle that the PTH curve
makes with the diagonal (corresponding to BV homeostasis)
at the point corresponding to the normal state. This angle
is shown in Figure 3(c) as ‘α’ and is plotted against ν
and OBsat
p in Figure 4. Only the region corresponding to
negative angles (bottom-left region, in red, in Figure 4)
corresponds to a catabolic response to increased PTH. A
physiologic estimate of this angle constrains (ν, OBsat
p ) to be
on the contour line corresponding to this angle in Figure 4,
leaving one degree of freedom. To retrieve the same
catabolic behaviour to continuous PTH administration near
the normal state for normal individuals as in Refs [1, 19],
we choose this angle to be ≈ −4.5◦ . We note, however,
that the catabolic response to continuous PTH in the present
model is stronger at larger values of PTH administration
rates (not shown).
While continuous PTH administration (infusion) does not
induce an anabolic response, it is known that intermittent
PTH administration (daily injections) does lead to an anabolic response. This dual catabolic–anabolic mode of action of PTH remains poorly understood [23]. It is instructive
to understand within our model how an anabolic response
to continuous PTH administration is obtained in Figure 3(b)
and (c). This anabolic response of the model occurs when
ν or OBsat
p is large, i.e. when OB p proliferation is significant.
Increasing PTH increases RANKL/OPG and promotes osteoclastogenesis, which frees TGFβ in the microenvironment

Many bone pathologies are due to an altered bone balance
and an altered bone turnover rate during remodelling.
Bone imbalance is associated with under-refilling (bone
loss) or over-refilling (bone gain) in BMUs. Bone turnover
rate is associated with the number of active BMUs and
indicates how fast bone may be lost, gained, and/or turned
over. Our computational model represents bone remodelling at the tissue scale, where BMU quantities are spatially
averaged. At this scale, bone imbalance and abnormal
turnover rates are characterised by altered overall rates of
bone resorption kres OCa and bone formation kform OBa in the
representative volume element [6].
Prostate cancer develops metastases primarily to trabecular bone of the pelvis, femur and vertebral bodies [47].
Several regulatory factors produced by the metastasising
prostate cancer cells (PCa) interfere with the normal regulation of bone remodelling, leading to osteoblastic (anabolic)
lesions with underlying osteolytic (catabolic) areas [25,48,
49]. The molecules Wnt in particular, are believed to be
particularly important in establishing osteoblastogenesis in
these lesions [50]. Hall et al. [26] suggest that inhibition
of Wnt by Dkk1 at an early stage of PCa metastasis leads
to osteolytic lesions (due to expression of e.g. PTHrP or
RANKL by the PC a cells). These lesions help the PC a cells to
establish in the bone microenvironment. At a later stage,
PC a cells progressively increase the W nt/ D kk1 ratio, resulting
in an increased osteoblastic response. Prostate cancer cells
also produce PSA, which cleaves PTHrP after amino acid
23 [48, 49, 51, 52]. The cleaved form PTHrP[1–23] fails to
activate the PTH receptor on osteoblasts, but is thought to
promote osteoblastogenesis [49].
The above time course of metastatic bone lesions can
be simulated in the model by prescribing an assumed
time course for the population of PCa cells and for their

As for the regulatory factors of bone remodelling, we
assume that the binding reactions involving PTHrP, PSA and

reaches a quasi-steady state equal to the production rate

has to be emphasised that BV(t) does not represent the time
course of the whole skeleton, but rather the evolution of a
small part of trabecular bone within a tissue sample. Other
regions of the bone might follow the same trend but have

a different time course. This hypothesis is supported by
histological evidence by Roudier et al. [27] in patients who
died with multiple bone metastases. This study shows that
both regions of osteolytic lesions and regions of osteoblastic
lesions are often found in the same individual.

• To obtain physiologically meaningful results and a

essential, as well as a feedback regulation of proliferation. This feedback regulation probably originates in

Figure 6 – Simulated resorption rate and formation rate due to prostate
cancer metastases to a tissue-scale portion of trabecular bone (blue line).
The dots on the line mark the elapsed weeks. The metastatic lesion
transitions from osteolytic to osteoblastic with increased turnover.

• The example of prostate cancer metastasis to bone
shows that the proposed catabolic and anabolic regulatory mechanisms of the model are able to simulate
the progression of a complex bone disease ranging
from catabolic to anabolic bone responses.

The joint evolution of the resorption rate and formation
rate of this simulated disease are displayed in Figure 6. One
sees that while the cancer develops osteoblastic lesions,
turnover rate is higher than normal, and so resorption rate
is also higher than normal. This is also consistent with the
description by Clarke and Fleisch [25] of prostate cancer
lesions to bone being often a combination of both an increase in resorption and in formation at a same site. Here,
we have driven the transition between osteolytic lesions
and osteoblastic lesions by an increase in Wnt production
around t Wnt . While several other factors are known to
influence the co-evolution of prostate cancer metastases
and bone lesions, this sequence of events may already
capture an aspect of metastatic lesions to bone, namely,
that the interference of cancer-cell-produced cytokines with
the normal biochemistry of bone remodelling can disrupt
normal remodelling signals and drive it to either catabolic
and anabolic imbalances.

6

The numerical results indicate that the new model is
improved and able to capture essential features of bone
remodelling. Nevertheless, several aspects of the model
can be further improved. In particular the phenomenological description of Wnt regulation of osteoblast proliferation could include biochemical binding reactions between
different molecules regulating the binding properties of
W nt to its receptor LRP 5/6, such as sclerostin and D kk1.
Most interestingly, the variability of the bone response
to a combination of continuous PTH administration and
perturbation of osteoblast proliferation suggests that future
developments of the model could shed light on the mechanisms underlying the difference between continuous PTH
administration and intermittent PTH administration.

Conclusions

Recent experimental evidence suggests that osteoblast proliferation plays an important role in the regulation of
bone remodelling. In this paper, we have developed a
novel computational model of bone cell interactions that
includes osteoblast proliferation. This model takes into
account a catabolic regulatory mechanism of bone remodelling, mediated by the RANK–RANKL–OPG pathway, and a
new anabolic regulatory mechanism of bone remodelling,
driven by osteoblast proliferation. From our numerical
simulations the following observations have been made:

Appendix A

Rate equations of the
regulatory factors

The regulatory factor concentrations are governed by mass
kinetics rate equations. Ligand–receptor binding reactions
occur on a time scale much faster than the characteristic
times of cellular response (such as differentiation, apoptosis). The rate equations for the regulatory factors can
therefore be taken in their steady state (see Refs. [1, 15]

strong anabolic bone response. Such a response could
be mediated by a variety of signalling molecules including Wnt. The strong anabolic response of prolif10

In these equations, external production rates PLext (t) represent external sources (or sinks) of the protein L and are
assumed given. We provide in Table 1 the description and
values of the parameters of the model.
A slight change in the expression for RANKL in Eq. (28)
has been made compared to Ref. [1]. The production of
RANKL is now correctly proportional to the number of cells
that express RANKL. We have replaced βRANKL in Ref. [1, Eq.

(36)] by βOB
OB p (t). To ensure that the normal steady

state is unchanged by this correction, we take βOB
=

βRANKL /OBp . We note that the same inconsistency of having
a production rate of RANKL not scaled by the number of
osteoblasts is present in Ref. [13]. While many behaviours
of the model are marginally affected by this correction,
some inconsistent behaviours have been corrected. In
particular, increasing the number of pre-osteoblasts in our
model now increases the total number of RANKL (bound
and unbound) accordingly, and transiently increases the
number of active osteoclasts (until OPG, produced by OBa s,
inhibits RANKL-activation of RANK). Previously, a decrease
in the number of active osteoclasts was observed in this
situation.
