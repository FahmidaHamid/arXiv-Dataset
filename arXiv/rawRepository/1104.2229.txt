The reversible Frank model is capable of amplifying the initial small statistical deviations from
the idealized racemic composition. This temporary amplification can be interpreted as a chiral
excursion in a dynamic phase space. It is well known that if the system is open to matter and
energy exchange, a permanently chiral state can be reached asymptotically, while the final state is
necessarily racemic if the system is closed. In this work, we combine phase space analysis, stability
analysis and numerical simulations to study the initial chiral excursions and determine how they
depend on whether the system is open, semi-open or closed.

INTRODUCTION

The Frank model [1] has been extensively invoked to justify theoretically the emergence of biological homochirality [2, 3], and is usually analyzed as a reaction network in open systems (matter and energy are exchanged with the
surroundings) composed of an irreversible enantioselective autocatalysis coupled to an irreversible mutual inhibition
reaction between the product enantiomers. The model shows how homochirality is achieved as a stationary state
when the mutual inhibition product (the heterodimer) is removed from the system and when the concentration of the
achiral substrate is held constant. By contrast, for reversible transformations and when the mutual inhibition product
remains in the system, the final stable state can only be the racemic one. As a consequence, a thermodynamically
controlled spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) cannot be expected to take place. In particular, SMSB is
not expected for reversible reactions taking place in systems closed to matter and energy flow.
Nevertheless, as was recently demonstrated [4] for systems closed to matter flow, the Frank model is a prime
candidate for the fundamental reaction network necessary for reproducing the key experimental features reported on
absolute asymmetric synthesis in the absence of any chiral polarization [5]. Most importantly, when reversible steps
in all the reactions are allowed it is capable of [4] (i) amplification of the initially tiny statistical enantiomeric excesses
from ee ∼ 10−8 % to practically 100%, leading to (ii) long duration chiral excursions or chiral pulses away from the
racemic state at nearly 100% ee, followed by, (iii) the final approach to the stable racemic state for which ee = 0,
i.e., mirror symmetry is recovered permanently. To understand this temporary asymmetric amplification is important
because the racemization time scale can be much longer than that for the complete conversion of the achiral substrate
into enantiomers.
Long duration chiral excursions have also been reported recently in closed chiral polymerization models with reversible reactions [6] where constraints implied by microreversibility have been taken into account. These results
are important because they suggest that temporary spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking in experimental chiral
polymerization can take place, and with observable and large chiral excesses without the need to introduce chiral
initiators [7] or large initial chiral excesses [8].
The purpose of this Letter is to elucidate the nature of these chiral excursions by combining the information provided
by phase plane portraits, numerical simulation and linear stability analysis. We consider the Frank model, this being
the most amenable to such types of analysis and because it is the “common denominator” of numerous more elaborate
theoretical models of SMSB [3].
The reaction scheme consists of a straight non-catalyzed reaction Eq. (1), an enantioselective autocatalysis Eq. (2),
where A is a prechiral starting product, and L and D are the two enantiomers of the chiral product. We also assume
reversible heterodimerization step in Eq. (3), where LD is the achiral heterodimer. The ki denote the reaction rate
constants. In the following, we give the reaction steps in detail.

We assume the feasibility of the reverse reaction for all the steps. Focusing our attention on chiral excursions, we
make a careful distinction between open, semi-open or fully closed systems. These system constraints are crucial for
determining both the intermediate and the asymptotic final states of the chemical system.

OPEN SYSTEM
Rate equations

We first consider the original Frank scenario [1]. There, steady and stable chiral states can be achieved, since the
system is permanently held out of equilibrium. See [9] for more details. An important question is, can the system
support chiral excursions? That is, pass through temporary chiral states before ending up in the final racemic state?
In the original Frank model there is an incoming flow of achiral compound A and elimination of the heterodimer LD
from the system. A convenient way to account for the inflow of achiral matter is to assume that the concentration
of the prechiral component [A] is constant, and then we need not write the corresponding kinetic equation for it.
For the outflow the heterodimer leaves the system at a rate γ̄. We assume that the heterodimer formation step is
irreversible, and set k−5 = 0. Note, the elimination of LD from the system can actually be neglected as long as the
hetero-dimerization step is irreversible [3]. We retain this outflow however since it is needed to obtain stationary
asymptotic values of all three concentrations [L], [D] and [LD]; see the fixed points below. So with [A] = const and
replacing Eq. (3 ) by

we obtain the rate equations

The system is described by three equations Eqs. (10-12). Since P does not enter into the equations for χ and η, the
equations decouple and the dynamical system to study is effectively two-dimensional and so the appearance of SMSB
cannot depend on whether the heterodimer is removed from the system when k−5 = 0, although the fixed points will
(see Sec II C).

Phase plane and linear stability analysis

In the phase space of the dynamical system defined by Eqs. (10,11) there are curves with a special significance.
These are the nullclines defined by
dχ

The intersections of these curves give the possible steady states (or fixed points) of the system. The condition

For u > 0 the solutions denoted χ− correspond to negative total enantiomer concentrations so we discard them.
The physically acceptable nullclines are plotted in Fig. 1. Which of the two different intersection configurations is
obtained depends only on the single parameter g. We emphasize that despite the similar appearance, the nullcline
graphs should not be confused with the classic bifurcation diagrams that have been discussed often in the past [10–12].

and dχ/dτ = 0 nullclines are plotted in black and red, respectively. The black (red) arrows indicate the regions of phase space
where η (χ) increases or decreases. Left: g = 0.79 > gcrit . The nullclines intersect in only the one point R representing the
asymptotic stable racemic state. Right: g = 0.29 < gcrit . In this case there are three intersections, Q± and R representing the
Z2 equivalent stable chiral states and the unstable racemic state, respectively. From Eq. (22) the enantiomeric excess at Q± is
η = ±0.93.

Note that λ1 (R) < 0 and λ1 (Q) < 0 are always negative

λ2 (R) < 0 and λ2 (Q) > 0 for g > gcrit , where gcrit = ( 1 + 16u − 1)/8u is the critical value for this parameter. Note
that gcrit (u) ≤ 1 for all u ≥ 0. For small u we can write gcrit = 1 − 4u; while for large u, gcrit → 1/2u1/2. Thus the
direct chiral monomer production step (∝ k1 in (1)) tends to racemize the system leading to final η values strictly
less than unity:
s
4ug 2
,
(22)
η =± 1−
1−g
which holds when g < gcrit . The chiral monomer production step thus reduces the range of g for which stable mirror
symmetry breaking can occur, and the chiral solutions are no longer 100% chiral.
Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the L and D chiral monomers starting from an extremely dilute total
enantiomer concentration and the very small statistical chiral deviations from the ideal racemic composition. The
right hand side of this figure shows the evolution in terms of the quantities χ and η. Note the mirror symmetry
breaking signalled by η. Are there chiral excursions found in the open system model? A chiral excursion holds when
the enantiomeric excess η departs from a small initial value, evolves to some maximum absolute value and then decays
to the final value of zero. To ensure a final racemic state we must set g > gcrit but then we find no numerical evidence
for such temporary chiral excursions. This can be understood qualitatively from inspection of left hand side of Fig. 1.
The initial conditions (dilute chiral monomer concentration and statistical chiral fluctuation) corresponds to a initial
point located at tiny values of χ and close to the vertical nullcline, well below the point labeled as R. The system
is attracted to the black curve and moves up the curve to R. In this situation, it is impossible for the chiral excess
to increase, not even temporarily. Notice the time scales for χ and η are of the same order. On the other hand, if

FIG. 2: Chiral symmetry breaking in the open system (6-8). Temporal behavior (logarithmic scale) of the individual enantiomer
concentrations [L] and [D] (left), and the chiral polarization η and total enantiomer concentration χ (right). Initial concentrations: [L]0 = (1 × 10−6 + 1 × 10−15 )M , [D]0 = 1 × 10−6 M (η0 = 5 × 10−8 %) and [A] = 1M . Rate constants: k1 = 10−4 s−1 ,
k−1 = 10−6 s−1 , k2 = 1s−1 M −1 , k−2 = 0.5s−1 M −1 and k5 = 1s−1 M −1 . These values correspond to g = 0.5 and u = 10−4 . In
figures of simulations, we always display original variables [L], [D], [LD], etc. as function of time t.

g < gcrit , then we have the situation depicted on the right hand side of the figure. Here the same initial point moves
towards the vertical nullcline and up towards R, but once past the locally horizontal black curve, is attracted to one
of the two chiral fixed points where it stays forever, provided the system is maintained out of equilibrium. The chiral
symmetry is permanently broken, and there is no excursion such as we have defined it.

SEMI-OPEN SYSTEM

Rate equations

To elucidate the temporal evolution of χ and η for a more general setting, we do not remove the heterodimer from
the system now allow the back reaction to chiral monomers, and we keep [A] constant. There is an implicit inflow as
a consequence of constant [A], but no outflow, so we denote this case ”semi-open”. While there is no mass balance
the system can still exhibit temporary SMSB.
The corresponding rate equations are

[L] = k1 [A] + (k2 [A] − k−1 )[L] − k−2 [L]2 − k5 [L][D] + k−5 [LD],

Phase plane and linear stability analysis

In order to obtain an approximate two-dimensional phase plane representation of the system, we will invoke the
dynamic steady state approximation for the heterodimer. Such approximations are usually justified when there
exists a clear separation of time scales in the problem, thus allowing one to identify rapidly and slowly changing
concentrations [13]. Here however, no such time scales are evident, all concentration variables evolve on a similar
time scale. Nevertheless, we will see a posteriori that this approximation can be good over a wide range of time
scales. We therefore assume that the heterodimer is in a dynamic steady state Pstat relative to the chiral monomer
concentrations and chiral polarization:
Pstat ≈

χ2
(1 − η 2 ).

Fixed Points and Stability

We solve Eqs. (26-28) looking for steady states. To keep the algebra manageable, we also set u = 0 as in [9]. There
are four solutions, namely, the empty O solution, the racemic R or the two mirror-symmetric chiral Q± solutions:

Note that the final heterodimer concentration P is zero in the chiral states Q± . Note that the steady state approximation Eq. (30) implies the same result since |η| = 1. In order to study the linear stability of the four possible
homogeneous solutions O, R and Q± , we calculate the eigenvalues of the 3 × 3 Jacobian array Mopen derived in [9]
after deleting the 3rd and 4th rows and columns. The eigenvalues corresponding to these solutions are given by

As λ1,2 (O) > 0, the empty state is always unstable. An inequality analysis shows that both λ2 (R) < 0 and λ3 (R) < 0
for all r > 0 and g > 0. Since λ1 (R) = −1 this demonstrates that the racemic state R is always stable. As an
independent check, we also verify that λ3 (Q) > 0 is positive for all r > 0 and g > 0, so the chiral solutions Q± are
always unstable. The final outcome will always the racemic state. There is no stable mirror symmetry broken solution
when the heterodimer dissociates back into the chiral monomers. Nevertheless, the system can have temporary chiral
excursions.

There is no flow of material into or out of the system. Since [A] is not constant in this situation, we cannot use it to

the dimensionless concentrations. This allows us to express the rate equations in the following dimensionless form:

The nullcline condition dχ/dτ = 0 leads to an unwieldy cubic equation in χ. More importantly, the nullcline is an
even function of η, reflecting the underlying Z2 mirror symmetry. The other condition dη/dτ = 0 is straightforward
to solve analytically and leads – after discarding the unphysical solution corresponding to negative total enantiomer
concentrations – to two curves

The curve χ(η) is an even function of η and χ(η) → ∞ for η 2 → 1 with a minimum at η = 0. Thus the nullcline has
the form of a narrow fork as depicted in Fig. 6.

Fixed Points and Stability

A linear stability analysis for the closed Frank model is given in [9]. That analysis was carried out in terms of χ, y
and P and does not assume the stationary approximation for the heterodimer. It turns out, even in a model as simple
as this one, that keeping ρ > 0 is analytically untractable, so we consider ρ = 0 in what follows. Then the asymptotic
stationary racemic R and chiral solutions Q± are given by

The chiral solutions Q± are unphysical for all u > 0 since they imply negative total enantiomer concentrations χ < 0.
Thus, the only physically acceptable solution is the racemic one R, and this is (at least marginally) stable, the
corresponding eigenvalue was calculated to be [9]
λ1,2,3 (R) = (0, −2 − u, −u).

FIG. 7: Temporary chiral symmetry breaking and chiral excursions in the closed system (41-42). Temporal behavior (logarithmic scale) of the individual enantiomer concentrations [L] and [D] (left) and the chiral polarization η and total enantiomer
concentration χ (right). Initial concentrations: [L]0 = (1 × 10−7 + 1 × 10−15 )M , [D]0 = 1 × 10−7 M (η0 = 5 × 10−8 %)
and [A]0 = 1M . Rate constants: k1 = 10−4 s−1 , k−1 = 10−6 s−1 , k2 = 1s−1 M −1 , k−2 = 0.5s−1 M −1 , k5 = 10s−1 M −1 and
k−5 = 10−4 s−1 .

In the limit ρ = 0, the substrate is consumed and all the matter ends up finally as pure heterodimer. Finally, note that
limu→0 Q± = R: the unphysical chiral solutions merge to the racemic one when k−1 = 0. For reversible heterodimer,
the matter in the racemic state η = 0 is distributed between the chiral monomers and the heterodimer: P = ([C̃]−χ)/2
and χ > 0 in keeping with the law of mass action. The single intersection R displayed in Fig. 6 indicates that the
racemic state is the only possible solution, in qualitative agreement with the stability analysis.
Example of a chiral excursion in a closed system is provided in Fig. 7. Once again, as for the semi-open situation,
the scheme is capable of amplifying a tiny initial chiral excess to practically 100%, followed by final approach to the
racemic state. The steady state approximation for the heterodimer is rather poor during the early stages (Fig. 8), but
similar to semi-open case, converges to the true heterodimer concentration after symmetry breaking and restoration.

DISCUSSION

In this Letter, we investigated transient mirror symmetry breaking in chiral systems, in particular in the Frank
model in settings of open, semi-open, and closed environments. Temporary chiral excursions are observed for closed
and semi-open systems and explained through phase space analysis, stability analysis and numerical simulations.
Such chiral excursions may be experimentally observed and could be mistaken for a transition to a chiral state. They
are in fact a long sought goal for the experimental chemist who could actually fail to see them if not aware of their
transitory nature. In open systems by contrast, the racemic state is approached monotonically. Therefore, it is
important to understand the processes and constraints responsible for these outcomes. This Letter has focused on
the effects that the in- and outflow of matter has on these phenomena. The open nature of the Frank model can
be arranged experimentally with an incoming flow of achiral precursor A and an outflow of the product heterodimer
LD, to conserve mass balance. Mathematically, we can model the inflow by assuming a constant concentration of [A]
and the outflow by a term representing the rate at which LD leaves the system. In our open model we assumed no
dissociation of LD back into chiral monomers. From the point of view of achieving permanent SMSB, there is then
actually no need to remove LD from the system, but we retain this outflow since it is needed to ensure stationary fixed
points for all the chemical concentrations. For the semi-open case, LD is not removed and we allow for its dissociation
into chiral monomers. There is no mass balance but temporary symmetry breaking can arise. Finally, in the closed
system there is neither inflow nor outflow, total mass is conserved and temporary symmetry breaking can occur.
A recent kinetic analysis of the Frank model in closed systems applied to the Soai reaction [5] indicates that in
actual chemical scenarios, reaction networks that exhibit SMSB are extremely sensitive to chiral inductions due to
the presence of inherent tiny initial enantiomeric excesses [4]. This amplification feature is also operative in much
more involved reaction networks such as chiral polymerization [6]. When the system is subject to a very small
perturbation about an extremely dilute racemic state, the initial chiral fluctuation does not immediately decay, but
becomes amplified and drives the system along a long-lived chiral excursion in phase space before final and inevitable
approach to the stable racemic solution. Mauksch and Tsogoeva have also previously indicated that chirality could
appear as the result of a temporary asymmetric amplification [14, 15].
Excursions in phase space as studied in this work are superficially reminiscent of excitable systems as studied in
dynamical systems [13, 16, 17]. But there are important differences. First of all, the excursions reported in chiral
systems are not easily visualized in the chiral monomer concentrations themselves, but are strikingly manifested by
the chiral polarization or enantiomeric excess. Secondly, the total enantiomer and heterodimer concentrations do
increase with time, so that the complete phase-space trajectory does not follow a closed path: there is no return to
the initial state. The chiral excursion is a one way trip, not a round trip as in an excitable system. Third, whereas
excursions are traditionally studied for open excitable systems [13, 16, 17], chiral excursions are observed here only
for closed or at most semi-open systems, but not for open systems.
The original impetus for considering phase-space descriptions of the Frank model comes not only from the chiral
excursions reported in [4] and [6] but also by the recent report of damped chiral oscillations detected numerically
in a model of chiral polymerization in closed systems [6]. Absolute asymmetric synthesis is achieved in the latter
scheme, accompanied by long duration chiral excursions in the enantiomeric excesses for all the homopolymer chains

12
formed, analogous to the much simpler Frank model. But unlike the latter, strong enantiomeric inhibition converts
these excursions into long period damped chiral oscillations in the enantiomeric excesses associated with the longest
homochiral polymer chains formed. Moreover, short period sustained chiral oscillations have been observed numerically
in a recycled Frank model open to energy flow, for large values of the inhibition [18]. This oscillatory behavior poses
an additional problem for the origin of biological homochirality, since any memory of the sign of the initial fluctuation
is further erased by subsequent oscillations thus adding a further element of uncertainty to the overall problem.
Chemical oscillations have been traditionally studied in conjunction with excitability. Although the latter concept is
not directly applicable to models exhibiting SMSB, it remains to be seen if the techniques used to study oscillations
can be applied profitably to reaction schemes that lead to chiral oscillations.
