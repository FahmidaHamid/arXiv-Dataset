Abstract Colony Collapse Disorder has become a global problem for beekeepers and for the crops which depend on bee polination. Multiple factors
are known to increase the risk of colony colapse, and the ectoparasitic mite
Varroa destructor that parasitizes honey bees is among the main threats to
colony health. Although this mite is unlikely to, by itself, cause the collapse
of hives, it plays an important role as it is a vector for many viral diseases.
Such diseases are among the likely causes for Colony Collapse Disorder.
The effects of V. destructor infestation are disparate in different parts of
the world. Greater morbidity - in the form of colony losses - has been reported
in colonies of European honey bees (EHB) in Europe, Asia and North America.
However, this mite has been present in Brasil for many years and yet there
are no reports of Africanized honey bee (AHB) colonies losses.
Studies carried out in Mexico showed that some resistance behaviors to
the mite - especially grooming and hygienic behavior - appear to be different
in each subspecies. Could those difference in behaviors explain why the AHB
are less susceptible to Colony Collapse Disorder?
In order to answer this question, we propose a mathematical model of the
coexistence dynamics of these two species, the bee and the mite, to analyze
the role of resistance behaviors in the overall health of the colony, and, as a
consequence, its ability to face epidemiological challenges.

1 Introduction
Since 2007 American beekeepers reported heavier and widespread losses of
bee colonies. And this goes beyond American borders — many Europeans
beekeepers complain of the same problem. This mysterious phenomenon was
called ”Colony Collapse Disorder” (CCD) — the official description of a syndrome in which many bee colonies died in the winter and spring of 2006/2007.
Diseases and parasites, in-hive chemicals, agricultural insecticides, genetically
modified crops, changed cultural practices and cool brood are pointed as some
of the possible causes for CCD (Oldroyd, 2007).
The ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor that parasitize honey bees has
become a global problem and is considered as one of the important burdens
on bee colonies and a cause for CCD. The Varroa mite is suspected of having
caused the collapse of millions of Apis mellifera honey bee colonies worldwide.
However, the effects caused by V. destructor infestation vary in different parts
of the world. More intense losses have been reported in European honey bee
colonies (EHB) of Europe, Asia and North America (Caldern et al, 2010).
The life cycle of V. destructor is tightly linked with the bee’s. Immature
mites develop together with immature bees, parasitizing them from an early
stage. The mite’s egg-laying behavior is coupled with the bee’s and thus depends on its reproductive cycle. Since worker brood rearing and thus Varroa
reproduction occurs all year round in tropical climates, it could be expected
that the impact of the parasite would be even worse in tropical regions. But
Varroa destructor has been present in Brazil for more than 30 years and yet
no collapses due to this mite, have been recorded (Carneiro et al, 2007). It
is worth noting that the dominant variety of bees in Brazil is the Africanized
honey bee (AHB) which since its introduction in 1956, has spread to the entire
country(Pinto et al, 2012).
African bees and their hybrids are more resistant to the mite V.destructor
than European bee subspecies (Medina and Martin, 1999; Pinto et al, 2012). A
review by Arechavaleta-Velasco and Guzman-Novoa (2001) in Mexico showed
that EHB was twice as attractive to V.destructor than AHB. The removal of
naturally infested brood, which is termed hygienic behavior, was reported as
four times higher in AHB than in EHB, and AHB workers were more efficient
in grooming mites from their bodies.
These behaviors are important factors in keeping the mites infestation low
in the honey bee colonies.

1.1 Resistance behaviors of the bee against the parasite
Two main resistance behaviors, namely grooming and hygienic behavior(Spivak,
1996), are mechanisms employed by the honey bees to control parasitism in
the hive.

Behavioral Defense against Colony Colapse Disorder

The grooming behavior is when a worker bee is able to groom herself with
her legs and mandibles to remove the mite and then injure or kill it. (Vandame
et al, 2000).
Hygienic behavior is a mechanism through which worker bee broods are
uncapped leading to the death of the pupae. This behavior is believed to
confer resistance to Varroa infestation since worker bees are more likely to
uncap an infested brood, than an uninfested one. It has been demonstrated
that the smell of the mite by itself is capable of activating this behavior.
(Corra-Marques et al, 1998).
The hygienic behavior serves to combat other illnesses or parasites to
which the brood is susceptible. It is also not a completely accurate mechanism. Correa-Marques and De Jong (1998), report that the majority (53%)
of the uncapped cells display apparently no signs of parasitism or other abnormality which would justify the killing of the brood. Thus, in our model
we define two parameters for the hygienic behavior: Hg , for the generic hygienic behavior, which may kill uninfested pupae, and h for the sucess rate in
uncapping infested brood cells.
Africanized honey bees have been shown to be more competent in hygienic
behavior than European honey bees. Vandame et al (2000) found in Mexico
that the EHB are able to remove just 8% of infested brood while AHB removed
up 32.5%.
The main goal of this paper is to propose a model capable of describing
the dynamics of infestation by V. destructor in bee colonies taking into consideration bee’s resistance mechanisms to mite infestation — grooming and
hygienic behavior. In addition, through simulations, we show how the resistance behaviors contribute to the reduction infestation levels and may even
lead to the complete elimination of the parasite from the colony.

2 Mathematical model
Previous work by Ratti et al (2012) models the population dynamics of bee
and mites together with the acute bee paralysis virus. Here we focus solely on
the host-parasite interactions trying to understand the resilience of colonies
in Brazil and the role of the more efficient resistance behaviors displayed by
AHB to explain the lower infestation rates and incidence of collapses in their
colonies.
Vandame et al (2002) discusses the cost-benefit of resistance mechanism of
bee against mite. The grooming behavior performed by adult bees, includes
detecting and eliminating mites from their own body (auto-grooming) or from
the body of another bee (allo-grooming). The hygienic behavior occurs when
adult bees detect the presence of the mite offspring still in the cells and in
order to prevent the mites from spreading in the colony, the worker bees kill
the infested brood. Their study compared the results for two subspecies of
bees - Africanized and European - to examine whether these two mechanisms
could explain the observed low compatibility between Africanized bees and

the mite Varroa destructor, in Mexico. The results showed that grooming and
hygienic behavior appears most intense in Africanized bees than in Europeans
bees.
The model proposed is shown in the diagram of figure 1, and detailed in
the system of differential equations below:

A + Ai
Ȧ = δI + gAi − µA
Ai
I˙i = π
− δIi − Hi Ii
A + Ai
Ȧi = δIi − gAi − (µ + γ)Ai
I˙ = π

(1)

In the proposed model, I, Ii , A and Ai represent the non-infested immature
bees, infested immature bees, non-infested adult worker bees and infested adult
worker bees, respectively.
Daily birth rate for bees is denoted by π, δ is the maturation rate, i.e.,
the inverse of number of days an immature bee requires to turn in adult, this

rate is the same for both infested and non-infested immature bees. µ is the
mortality rate for adult bees,γ is the mortality rate induced by the presence
of mites in the colony bees. The parameters Hi , H e g are the rate of removal
of infested pupae via hygienic behavior, the general hygienic rate (affecting
uninfested pupae) and grooming rate, respectively.

Choosing parameters
Some of the parameters associated with the bees life cycle, used for the simulations, can be found in the literature, as shown in table 1. For the resistance behavior parameters, g, H and Hi , very little information is available.
Therefore we decided to study the variation of these parameters within ranges
which allowed for the system to switch between a mite-free equilibrium to one
of coexistence. These ranges also reflected observations described in the literature (Mondragn et al, 2005; Vandame et al, 2002; Arechavaleta-Velasco and
Guzman-Novoa, 2001).

In order to understand the dynamics of the proposed model of mite infestation
of bee colonies, we proceed to analyze it.

Fig. 2 plot of values of R0 for a range of values of g and H. Hi = 0.01 and remaining
parameters set as described in table 1. The region in red corresponds to R0 > 1, the black
line to R0 = 0 and the blue region otherwise.

3.1 Basic reproduction number of the infested bees
An effective way to look at boundary beyond which coexistence of mites and
bees is possible, is to look at the R0 of infestation. For our model, the basic
reproduction number, or R0 of infested bees, can be thought of as the number
of new infestations that one infested bee when introduced into the colony
generates on average over the course of its infestation period or while it is not
groomed, in an otherwise uninfested population.
Deriving R0 using the next generation method: To calculate the basic reproduction number of infested bees, we will use the next-generation matrix
(Van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002), where the whole population is divided into n compartments in which there are m < n infested compartments.
In this method, R0 is defined as the spectral radius, or the largest eigenvalue, of the next generation matrix.
Let xi , i = 1, 2..., m be the number or proportion of individuals in the ith
compartment. Then
dxi
dt

= Fi (x) − Vi (x)

where Fi (x) is the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment i and
Vi (x) = Vi− (x) − Vi+ (x). Where Vi− is the rate of transfer of individuals out
of the ith compartment, and Vi+ represents the rate of transfer of individuals
into compartment i by all other means.

as given in table 1.The region in red corresponds to R0 > 1, the black line to R0 = 0 and
the blue region otherwise. This figure illustrates one of the conditions for coexistence(given
other parameters values fixed as in table 1) that H must be larger than Hi .

The next generation matrix is then defined by F V −1 , where F and V can
be formed by the partial derivatives of Fi and Vi .

and Hi the mite will stay in the colony. On the other hand, the blue region represents R0 < 1
which means that for these these combination of g and Hi the mites will be eliminated.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the boundary between mite-free (blue region,
R0 < 1) and coexistence equilibria (red region, R0 > 1).

We assume that all the coefficients presented in table 1 are all positive, that
is:

α, αi > δ,

µi > µ .

The previous system of equations is written
Ẋ = f (X),

X = (I, A, Ii , Ai )

(7)

The right-hand side of (7) is not properly defined in the points where A+Ai =
0. However, the following result demonstrates that this has no consequence on
the solutions, as the latter stays away from this part of the subspace. For
subsequent use, we denote D the subset of those elements X = (I, A, Ii , Ai ) ∈
R4+ such that A + Ai 6= 0.
Theorem 1 (Well-posedness and boundedness). If X0 ∈ D, then there exists
a unique solution of (7) defined on [0, +∞) such that X(0) = X0 . Moreover,

Theorem 1 shows that the compact set D0 is positively invariant and attracts
all the trajectories. Therefore, in order to study the asymptotics of system (5),
it is sufficient to consider the trajectories of (5) that are in D0 .

Moreover, for all initial conditions in D0 except in a zero measure set, the
trajectories tend towards XCO .
Recall that R0 =

in such a way that

β > 0 ⇔ R0 > 1 .

(15)

The point R0 = 1, that is β = 0, is the point of a transcritical bifurcation,
that appears when R0 gets larger than 1. For larger values, two equilibria are
found analytically, a mite-free one, that is unstable, and a coexistence equilibrium which is stable. We’ve shown (Theorem 2) that the latter is globally
asymptotically stable if β > α1i , and conjecture that the same property holds

corresponding to α ≈ 0.125 (β = 0, R0 = 1). Blue dots correspond to the equilibrium values
of Ii

for β in the interval (0, α1i ]. Using α as bifurcation parameter, the bifurcation
appears for α = αi (µµi +g) ≈ 0.125, after substituting the parameter values.
If we solve numerically the system from (5), we confirm the existence of
two equilibria when α crosses the bifurcation value of 0.125. The instability
and stability of the mite-free and coexistence equilibria, respectively is shown
in the simulation of figure 6.
Figures 6 and 7 show simulations representing the coexistence and mite-free
equilibria, respectively.

4 Discussion and Conclusions
Coexistence of bees and Varroa mites in nature is an undeniable fact. However,
this coexistence is fraught with dangers for the bees, since Varroa mites can be
vectors of lethal viral diseases. These deleterious effects for the health of the
individual workers and the whole colony, has led to the evolution of resistance
behaviors such as the hygienic behavior and grooming.
Those behaviors are not entirely without cost to the bees, exacerbated
hygienic behavior – when both H and Hi are intensified – can exert a sub-

parameters giving R0 ≈ 1.33. Initial conditions: I = 5000, Ii = 0, A = 20000, Ai = 0 and
parameters g = 0.01, Hi = 0.1, µ = 0.04, δ = 0.05, γ = 10−7 and H = 0.19. On time

stantial toll on the fitness of the queen. So it is safe to say that this parasitic
relationship has evolved within a vary narrow range of parameters. Even if the
mite-free equilibrium is advantageous to the colony, maintaining it may be too
expensive to the bees.
[we need some discussion regarding the conditions for stability of XM F , or
the invasibility of the colony by mites]
On the other hand, in the absence of viral diseases, mite parasitism seems
to be fairly harmless. If we look at the expression for the R0 of infestation
(3), we can see that the mite-induced bee mortality, γ, (not by viral diseases),
must be kept low or risk destabilizing the co-existence equilibrium.
Africanized Honey bees, having evolved more effective resistance behaviors, are more resistant to CCD by their ability to keep infestation levels lower
than those of their European counterparts(Moretto et al, 1991, 1993). Unfortunately, the lack of more detailed experiments measuring the rates of grooming
and higienic behaviors in both groups (EHB and AHB), makes it hard to
position them accurately in the parameter space of the model presented.

adult bee, when R0 < 1. Initial conditions: I = 15000, Ii = 5000, A = 20000, Ai = 6000
and parameters g = 0.01, Hi = 0.1, µ = 0.05, δ = 0.05, γ = 10−7 and H = 0.1.

Finally, we hope that the model presented here along with its demonstrated
dynamical properties will serve as a solid foundation for the development of
other models including viral dynamics and other aspects of bee colony health.

5 Appendix – Proofs of the theorems
Proof of Theorem 1. • Clearly, the right-hand side of the system of equations
is globally Lipschitz on any subset of D where A + Ai is bounded away from
zero. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of system (5) is then obtained for each trajectory staying at finite distance of this boundary. We will
show that the two formulas provided in the statement are valid for each trajectory departing initially from a point where A + Ai 6= 0. As a consequence,
the fact that all trajectories are defined on infinite horizon will ensue.
• Summing up the first two equations in (5) yields, for any point inside D:
I˙ + I˙i = π − αI − αi Ii ≥ π − αmax (I + Ii ) .

(16)

Integrating this differential inequality between any two points X(0) = X0 and
X(t) of a trajectory for which X(τ ) ∈ D, τ ∈ [0; t], one gets
I(t) + Ii (t) ≥

π
αmax


1 − e−αmax t + (I(0) + Ii (0))e−αmax t ,

where the right-hand side is in any case positive for any t > 0.

(17)

14

Joyce de Figueiró Santos et al.

Similarly, one has
I˙ + I˙i ≤ π − αmin (I + Ii ) ,

(18)

and therefore
I(t) + Ii (t) ≤


π
1 − e−αmin t + (I(0) + Ii (0))e−αmin t .
αmin

(19)

This proves in particular that the inequalities in (8a) hold for any portion of
trajectory remaining inside D.
We now consider the evolution of A, Ai . Similarly to what was done for
I, Ii , one has
Ȧ + Ȧi = δ(I + Ii ) − µA − µi Ai ≥ δ(I + Ii ) − µi (A + Ai )

(20)

Therefore,
A(t) + Ai (t) ≥ (A(0) + Ai (0))e−µi t + δ

Z

t

(I(τ ) + Ii (τ ))e−µi (t−τ ) . dτ . (21)

0

Integrating the lower bound of I + Ii extracted from (17) yields the conclusion
that any solution departing from D indeed remains in D as long as it is defined.
On the other hand, we saw previously that trajectories remaining in D could be
extended on the whole semi-axis [0, +∞). Therefore, any trajectory departing
from a point in D can be extended to [0, +∞), and remains in D for any t > 0.
In particular, (8a) holds for any trajectory departing inside D.
Let us now achieve the proof by bounding A + Ai from above. One has
Ȧ + Ȧi ≤ δ(I + Ii ) − µ(A + Ai )

(22)

and thus
A(t) + Ai (t) ≤ (A(0) + Ai (0))e−µt + δ

Using (19) then permits to achieve the proof of (8b), and finally the proof of

and thus Hurwitz because α(µ+g)−µαmin = (α−αmin )µ+αg > 0. Therefore,

Invoking Kamke’s Theorem, see e.g. (Coppel, 1965, Theorem 10, p. 29), one

Joining this with (5d) and using Kamke’s result as before, ones deduces that
both Ii and Ai have positive values when at least one of their two initial values
are positive. This achieves the proof of Theorem 1.

For subsequent use of the theory of monotone systems, one determines, for
any (nonnegative) constant value of u, the equilibrium values of (I, A, Ii , Ai )
for equation (30a)-(30d), and the corresponding values of y as given by
(30e).
2. The equilibrium points of system (5) are then exactly (and easily) obtained by solving the fixed point problem u = y among the solutions of the
previous problem.

3. One then shows that the I/O system u 7→ y defined by (30a)-(30e) is
anti-monotone with respect to certain order relation, and the study of the
stability of these equilibria shows that it admits single-valued I/S and I/O
characteristics, as in (Angeli and Sontag, 2004).
4. Using this properties, the stability of the equilibria of the system obtained
by closing the loop (30a)-(30e) by (30f) is then established using arguments
similar to Angeli and Sontag (2003).
1. For fixed u > 0, the equilibrium equations of the I/O system (30) are given
by

• The case λ = 0 yields I = 0, and then A = 0 by (31a), and therefore u

• The case λ = 1 yields Ii = 0, and then Ai = 0 by (31d) or (31c), and
y = 0. There remains the two following conditions:

2. The equilibrium points of system (5) are exactly those points for which
u = y(u) for some nonnegative scalar u, where y(u) is one of the output values
corresponding to u previously computed. We now examine in more details the
solutions of this equation.
• For the value λ = 0 in the previous computations, one should have u = 0,
due to (45); but on the other hand y > 0 for u = 0, due to (46). Therefore
this point does not correspond to an equilibrium point of system (31).
• The value λ = 1 yields a unique equilibrium point. Indeed, y = 0, so u
should be zero too, and the unique solution is given by

This corresponds to the equilibrium denoted XM F in the statement.
• Let us consider now the case of λ ∈ (0; 1). For this case to be considered,
it is necessary that β > 0, that is R0 > 1. The value of u should be such that

3. Let K be the cone in R4+ defined as the product of orthants R+ × R+ ×
R− × R− . We endow the state space with this order. In other words, for any
X = (I, A, Ii , Ai ) and X 0 = (I 0 , A0 , Ii0 , A0i ) in R4+ , X ≤K X 0 means:
I ≤ I 0 , A ≤ A0 , Ii ≥ Ii0 , Ai ≥ A0i .

(53)

With this structure, one may verify that the system (30a)-(30e) has the following monotonicity properties (Hirsch, 1988; Smith, 2008)
.
– For any function u ∈ U = {u : [0; +∞) → R, locally integrable and taking
on positive values almost everywhere}, for any X0 , X00 ∈ R4+ ,
X0 ≤K X00

⇒

∀t ≥ 0, X(t; X0 , u) ≤K X(t; X00 , u)

(54)

where by definition X(t; X0 , u) denotes the value at time t of the point in
the trajectory departing at time 0 from X0 and subject to input u.
– The Jacobian matrix of the I/O system is

which is irreducible when A 6= 0 and Ai 6= 0. The system is therefore
strongly monotone in D0 \ {X : Ai = 0} (notice that D0 does not contain
points for which A = 0), and also on the invariant subset D0 ∩ {X : Ii =
0, Ai = 0, }.

– The input-to-state map is monotone, that is: for any inputs u, u0 ∈ U, for
any X0 ∈ R4+ ,
u(t) ≤ u0 (t) a.e.

⇒

∀t ≥ 0, X(t; X0 , u) ≤K X(t; X00 , u) .

(56)

– The state-to-output map is anti-monotone, that is: for any X, X 0 ∈ R4+ ,
X ≤K X 0

⇒

∀t ≥ 0, gAi ≥ gA0i

(57)

monotone (due to the irreducibility of the Jacobian matrix) for any constant value of u.
• In order to construct I/S and I/O characteristics for system (31), we now
examine the stability of the equilibria of system (31) for any fixed value of
u ∈ R+ . As shown by Theorem 1, all trajectories are precompact.
• When β ≤ 0, it has been previously established that for any u ∈ R there
exists at most one equilibrium in D0 to the I/O system (31). The strong monotonicity property of this system depicted above then implies that this equilibrium is globally attractive (Hirsch, 1988, Theorem 10.3). Therefore, system
(31) possesses I/S and I/O characteristics. As for any value of u, this equilibrium corresponds to zero output, the I/O characteristics is zero. Applying
the results of Angeli and Sontag (2004), one gets that the closed-loop system
equilibrium XM F is an almost globally attracting equilibrium for system (5).
• Let us now consider the case where β > 0. We first show that the equilibrium point with Ii = 0, Ai = 0 and (34) is locally unstable. Notice that this
point is located on a branch of solution parametrized by u and departing from
XM F for u = 0. The Jacobian matrix (55) taken at this point is


The first of them is clearly Hurwitz, while the second, whose characteristic
polynomial is
µαδπ
= s2 +(αi +µi +g)s−ααi (β−u(µi +g))
δπ + αu
= s2 + (αi + µi + g)s − ααi (µi + g)(u∗ − u) (60)

s2 +(αi +µi +g)s+αi (µi +g)−

(where u∗ is defined in (44)) is not Hurwitz when β > 0 and 0 ≤ u ≤ u∗ , and
has a positive root for 0 < u < u∗ . Therefore, the corresponding equilibrium
of the I/O system (30) is unstable for these values of u.
The other solution, given as a function of u by (52), is located on a branch
of solution parametrized by u and departing from XCO for u = 0. As the

Behavioral Defense against Colony Colapse Disorder

21

other solution is unstable for 0 < u < u∗ , one can deduce from Hirsch (1988,
Theorem 10.3) that these solutions are locally asymptotically stable.
• One may now associate to any u ∈ [0; u∗ ] the corresponding unique
locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, and the corresponding output
value, defining therefore respectively an I/S characteristic kX and an I/O
characteristic k for system (30).
For any scalar u ∈ [0; u∗ ], for almost any X0 ∈ D0 , one has
lim X(t; X0 , u) = kX (u),

lim y(t; X0 , u) = k(u) ,

t→+∞

t→+∞

(61)

and, from the monotony properties, for any scalar-valued continuous function
u, for almost any X0 ∈ D0 :




k lim sup u(t) ≤ lim inf y(t; X0 , u) ≤ lim sup y(t; X0 , u) ≤ k lim inf u(t) .
t→+∞

t→+∞

t→+∞

t→+∞

(62)
Using the fact that k is anti-monotone and that u = y for the closed-loop
system, one deduces, as e.g. in Gouzé (1988) that, for the solutions of the
latter,




k 2l lim inf y(t; X0 , u) ≤ lim inf y(t; X0 , u) ≤ lim sup y(t; X0 , u) ≤ k 2l lim sup y(t; X0 , u) .
t→+∞

t→+∞

t→+∞

t→+∞

(63)
Here k(u), defined by (46), is a linear decreasing map. When its slope is
smaller than 1, then the sequences in the left and right of (63) tend towards
the fixed point that corresponds to the output value at X = XCO , see (50).
This slope value, see (46), is equal to
µi + g
1
δπg
=
,
αi (µi + g) δπβ
αi β

(64)

and it thus smaller than 1 if and only if β > α1i , which is an hypothesis of the
statement.
Under these assumptions, one then obtains that the lim inf and lim sup in
(63) are equal, and thus that y, and thus u, possesses limit for t → +∞. Moreover, the state itself converges towards the equilibrium XCO when t → +∞
for almost every initial conditions X(0). This achieves the proof of Theorem
2.
