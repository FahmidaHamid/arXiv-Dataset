Abstract This study reports on a head related
impulse response (HRIR) application to an
auditory spatial brain-computer interface (BCI)
speller paradigm. Six experienced and five BCInaive users participated in an experimental spelling
set up based on five Japanese vowels. Obtained
auditory
evoked
potentials
resulted
with
encouragingly good and stable P300-responses in
online BCI experiments. Our case study indicated
that the headphone reproduced auditory (HRIRbased) spatial sound paradigm could be a viable
alternative to the established multi-loudspeaker
surround sound BCI-speller applications, as far as
healthy pilot study users are concerned.
Keywords Auditory BCI; P300; EEG; brain signal
processing.

INTRODUCTION

BCI is expected to provide a speller for paralyzed
people such as those suffering from an amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), etc. The majority of successful
BCI applications rely on motor imagery or visual
modalities, which require long-term training and good
eyesight from the users [1]. Auditory modality could
be an alternative method because it does not require
good eyesight, although it is still not as successful as
the visual applications. We propose to extend the
previously reported vector-based-amplitude-panning
(VBAP)-based spatial auditory BCI (saBCI)
paradigm [2] by making use of a head-related-impulseresponse (HRIR) [3] for virtual sound images
spatialization
with
headphones-based
sound
reproduction. In addition we simplify the previously
reported real sound sources generated with surround
sound loudspeakers [4]. The HRIR appends interauralintensity-differences (IID), interaural-time-differences

(ITD), and spectral modifications to create the spatial
stimuli. The HRIR allows also for a more precise and
fully spatial virtual sound images positioning utilizing
even not the user own head’s HRIR measurements.

METHODS

All of the experiments were performed in the Life
Science Center of TARA, University of Tsukuba,
Japan. We conducted pilot experiment with the six
BCI experienced users and a practical previous study
with BCI-naive participants [5]. We chose five
Japanese vowels for the first step for the BCI-speller.
We spatialized the sound stimuli using a public
domain CIPIC HRTF database [3]. Each Japanese
vowel was set spatially on a horizontal plane at
azimuth locations of -80°, -40°, 0°, 40°, and 80° for
the a, i, u, e, and o vowels, respectively. Synthetic
voice was used in the pilot and recorded voice [6] in
the practical experiments, respectively. The online
EEG experiments were conducted to investigate P300
response validity. The brain signals were collected by
a bio-signal amplifier system g.USBamp by g.tec
Medical Engineering GmbH, Austria. The EEG
signals were captured by sixteen active gel-based
electrodes attached to the following head locations Cz,
Pz, P3, P4, Cp5, Cp6, P1, P2, Poz, C1, C2, FC1, FC2,
and FCz as in the extended 10/10 international system.
The ground electrode was attached on the forehead at
the FPz location, and the reference on the user's left
earlobe, respectively. The extended BCI2000 software
was used for the saBCI experiments to present stimuli
and display online classification results. A single
experiment was comprised of five sessions and a
session contained of five selections. In brief, single
experiment was comprised of 25 selections. A single
selection was comprised of 10 targets and 40 nontargets. Brain signals were averaged 10 times for each
vowel classification. The single stimulus duration was

set to 150 ms in pilot experiment and 250 ms in
practical experiment [5]. The inter-stimulus-interval
(ISI) was set to 350 ms in the pilot and 150 ms in
practical experiment. The EEG sampling rate was set
to 512 Hz and the notch filter to remove electric power
lines interface of 50 Hz was applied in a rejection band
of 48 to 52 Hz. The band pass filter was set with
0.1 Hz and 60 Hz cutoff frequencies. The acquired
EEG brain signals were classified online within the inhouse extended BCI2000 application using a stepwise
linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) classifier with
features drawn from the 0~800 ms ERP intervals.

RESULTS AND DISUCUSSIONS

This section presents and discusses results obtained
from the EEG experiments conducted with eleven
users as described in the previous sections. The
average and the best accuracies are summarized in
Table 1 with a major comparison measure called an
information-transfer-rate (ITR). Users #E1~E6 were
the BCI experienced of the pilot experiment and
#N1~N5 the naive from the practical sessions [5].

Figure 1. Grand mean average ERP brain responses.

The grand mean averaged brain ERP responses at
representative four center electrodes from the both
experiments are presented in Figure 1. The purple lines

depict the brainwave responses to targets, and blue to
the non-targets. The clear P300 responses have been
confirmed in the both conducted experiments. The
averaged BCI classification accuracies were still not
perfect owing too short ISIs set in the practical
experiment, yet the ITR scores improved.

CONCLUSIONS

The presented EEG results confirmed P300
reponses not only of the BCI experienced users but
also in case of the BCI-naive group. The mean
accuracy was not perfect yet, but the ITR results were
encouraging for the novel saBCI modality. We plan to
expand this modality with more letters using
additionally various spatial sound elevations.
