SUMMARY

Pre-mRNA splicing relies on the poorly
understood dynamic interplay between >150
protein compo- nents of the spliceosome. The
steps at which splicing can be regulated remain
largely unknown. We sys- tematically analyzed
the effect of knocking down the components of
the splicing machinery on alterna- tive splicing
events relevant for cell proliferation and apoptosis
and used this information to reconstruct a
network of functional interactions. The network
accurately
captures
known
physical
and
functional associations and identifies new ones,
revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core
spliceosomal components, related to the order
and duration of their recruitment during
spliceosome assembly. In contrast with standard
models of regulation at early steps of splice site
recognition,
factors
involved
in
catalytic
activation of the spliceosome display regu- latory
properties. The network also sheds light on the
antagonism between hnRNP C and U2AF, and on targets of antitumor drugs, and can be widely used
to identify mechanisms of splicing regulation.

INTRODUCTION
Pre-mRNA splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, one of the
most complex molecular machineries of the cell, composed of
five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4/5/6
snRNP) and about 150 additional polypeptides (reviewed by
Wahl et al., 2009). Detailed biochemical studies using a small
number of model introns have delineated a sequential pathway
for the assembly of spliceosomal subcomplexes. For example,
U1 snRNP recognizes the 5’ splice site, and U2AF—a heterodimer of 35 and 65 kDa subunits—recognizes sequences at
the 3’ end of introns. U2AF binding helps to recruit U2 snRNP
to the upstream branchpoint sequence, forming complex A. U2
snRNP binding involves interactions of pre-mRNA sequences
with U2 snRNA as well as with U2 proteins (e.g., SF3B1). Subse-

quent binding of preassembled U4/5/6 tri-snRNP forms complex
B, which after a series of conformational changes forms complexes Bact and C, concomitant with the activation of the two
catalytic steps that generate splicing intermediates and products. Transition between spliceosomal subcomplexes involves
profound dynamic changes in protein composition as well as
extensive rearrangements of base-pairing interactions between
snRNAs and between snRNAs and splice site sequences (Wahl
et al., 2009). RNA structures contributed by base-pairing interactions between U2 and U6 snRNAs serve to coordinate metal ions
critical for splicing catalysis (Fica et al., 2013), implying that the
spliceosome is an RNA enzyme whose catalytic center is only
established upon assembly of its individual components.
Differential selection of alternative splice sites in a pre-mRNA
(alternative splicing, AS) is a prevalent mode of gene regulation in
multicellular organisms, often subject to developmental regulation (Nilsen and Graveley, 2010) and frequently altered in disease
(Cooper et al., 2009; Bonnal et al., 2012). Substantial efforts
made to dissect mechanisms of AS regulation on a relatively
small number of pre-mRNAs have provided a consensus picture
in which protein factors recognizing cognate auxiliary sequences
in the pre-mRNA promote or inhibit early events in spliceosome
assembly (Fu and Ares, 2014). These regulatory factors include
members of the hnRNP and SR protein families, which often
display cooperative or antagonistic functions depending on the
position of their binding sites relative to the regulated splice sites.
Despite important progress (Barash et al., 2010; Zhang et al.,
2010), the combinatorial nature of these contributions complicates the formulation of integrative models for AS regulation.
To systematically capture the contribution of splicing regulatory factors, including components of the core spliceosome (Clark
et al., 2002; Park et al., 2004; Pleiss et al., 2007; Saltzman et al.,
2011) to AS regulation, we set up a high-throughput screen to
evaluate the effects of knocking down each individual splicing
component or regulator on 36 functionally important AS events
(ASEs) and developed a framework for data analysis and
network modeling. Network-based approaches can provide
rich representations for real-world systems that capture their organization more adequately than more traditional approaches or
mere cataloguing of pairwise relationships. Numerous studies
have utilized them as a platform for deriving comprehensive transcriptional, metabolic, and physical interaction maps in several

organisms and contexts (e.g., Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2013;
Franceschini et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2012). Their application
has also proven invaluable for deciphering regulatory relationships in transcriptional circuits, for studying their properties
upon perturbation, and for connecting physiological responses
and diseases to their molecular underpinnings (e.g., Kim et al.,
2012; Watson et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014).
Key to our approach is the premise that the distinct profiles of
splicing changes caused by perturbation of regulatory factors
depend on the functional bearings of those factors and can,
therefore, be used as proxies for inferring functional relationships. We derive a network that recapitulates the topology
of known splicing complexes and provides an extensive map
of >500 functional associations among ~200 splicing factors
(SFs). We use this network to identify general and particular
mechanisms of AS regulation and to identify key SFs that
mediate the effects on AS of perturbations induced by iron
(see accompanying manuscript by Tejedor et al., 2014, in this
issue of Molecular Cell) or by antitumor drugs targeting components of the splicing machinery. Our study offers a unique compendium of functional interactions among SFs, a discovery tool
for coupling cell-perturbing stimuli to splicing regulation, and
an expansive view of the splicing regulatory landscape and its
organization.
RESULTS
Results from a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify regulators
of Fas/CD95 AS revealed that knockdown of a significant
fraction of core SFs (defined as proteins identified in highly purified spliceosomal complexes assembled on model, single-intron
pre-mRNAs; Wahl et al., 2009) caused changes in Fas/CD95
exon 6 inclusion (Tejedor et al., 2014). The number of core factors involved and the extent of their regulatory effects exceeded
those of classical splicing regulatory factors like SR proteins or
hnRNPs. To systematically evaluate the contribution of different
classes of splicing regulators to AS regulation, we set up a
screen in which we assessed the effects of knockdown of
each individual factor on 38 ASEs relevant for cell proliferation
and/or apoptosis (Figures 1A and 1B). The ASEs were selected
due to their clear impact on protein function and their documented biological relevance (see Table S1 available online). A
library of 270 siRNA pools (Table S2) was used, corresponding
to genes encoding core spliceosomal components as well as
auxiliary regulatory SFs and factors involved in other RNA-processing steps, including RNA stability, export, or polyadenylation. In addition, 40 genes involved in chromatin structure mod-

ulation were included, to probe for possible functional links
between chromatin and splicing regulation (Luco et al., 2011).
The siRNA pools were individually transfected in biological
triplicates in HeLa cells using a robotized procedure (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Seventy-two hours posttransfection, RNA was isolated, cDNA libraries generated using oligodT and random primers, and the patterns of splicing probed
by PCR using primers flanking each of the alternatively spliced
regions (Figure 1A). PCR products were resolved by highthroughput capillary electrophoresis (HTCE) and the ratio between isoforms calculated as the percent spliced in (PSI) index
(Katz et al., 2010), which represents the percentage of exon
inclusion/alternative splice site usage. Knockdowns of factors
affecting one ASE (Fas/CD95) were also validated with siRNA
pools from a second library and by a second independent
technique (Illumina HiSeq sequencing; Tejedor et al., 2014).
Conversely, the effects of knocking down core SFs (P14,
SNRPG, and SF3B1) on the ASEs were robust when different
siRNAs and RNA purification methods were used (Figure S1A).
Several pieces of evidence indicate that the changes in AS are
not due to the induction of cell death upon depletion of essential
SFs. First, cell viability was not generally compromised after
72 hr of knockdown of 13 individual core SFs (Figure S1C). Second, cells detached from the plate were washed away before
RNA isolation. Third, splicing changes upon induction of
apoptosis with staurosporine were distinct from those observed
upon knockdown of SFs (Figure S1D).
Overall the screen generated a total of 33,288 PCR data
points. These measurements provide highly robust and sensitive
estimates of the relative use of competing splice sites. Figure 1D
shows the spread of the effects of knockdown for all the factors
in the screen for the ASEs analyzed. Three events (VEGFA, SYK,
and CCND1) were excluded from further analysis, because they
were not affected in the majority of the knockdowns (median absolute DPSI <1, Figure 1D). From these data we generated, for
every knockdown condition, a perturbation profile that reflects
its impact across the 35 ASEs in terms of the magnitude and direction of the change. Figures 1E and 1F show examples of such
profiles and the relationships between them: in one case, knockdown of CDC5L or PLRG1 generates very similar perturbation
profiles (upper diagrams in Figures 1E and 1F), consistent with
their well-known physical interactions within the PRP19 complex
(Makarova et al., 2004). In contrast, the profiles associated with
the knockdown of SNRPG and DDX52 are to a large extent
opposite to each other (lower diagrams in Figures 1E and 1F),
suggesting antagonistic functions. Perturbation profiles and
relationships between factors were not significantly changed

when knockdown of a subset of factors was carried out for 48 hr
(Figure S2A), arguing against AS changes being the consequence of secondary effects of SF knockdown in these cases
(see also below the discussion on IK/SMU1).
Pervasive and Distinct Effects of Core Spliceosome
Components on Alternative Splicing Regulation
The output of the screening process is summarized in the heatmap of Figure 2A. Three main conclusions can be derived from
these results. First, a large fraction of the SF knockdowns have

	  
4

noticeable but distinct effects on AS, indicating that knockdown
of many components of the spliceosome causes switches in
splice site selection, rather than a generalized inhibition of
splicing of every intron. Second, a substantial fraction of AS
changes correspond to higher levels of alternative exon inclusion, again arguing against simple effects of decreasing splicing
activity upon knockdown of general SFs, which would typically
favor skipping of alternative exons that often harbor weaker
splice sites. These observations suggest extensive versatility
of the effects of modulating the levels of SFs on splice site

	  

selection. Third, despite the diversity of the effects of SF knockdowns on multiple ASEs, similarities can also be drawn (Figure 2A). For example, a number of ASEs relevant for the control
of programmed cell death (e.g., Fas, APAF1, CASP9, or MCL1)
cluster together and are similarly regulated by a common set
of core spliceosome components. This observation suggests
coordinated regulation of apoptosis by core factors, although
the functional effects of these AS changes appear to be complex (Figure S3A). Another example is two distinct ASEs in the
fibronectin gene (cassette exons EDA and EDB, of paramount
importance to control aspects of development and cancer progression; Muro et al., 2003) which cluster close together, suggesting common mechanisms of regulation of the ASEs in this
locus.
To explore the effects of different classes of SFs on AS regulation, we first grouped them in four categories: genes coding
for core spliceosome components, noncore SFs/regulators,
RNA-processing factors not directly related to splicing, and
chromatin-related factors. Core SFs display the greater spread
and average magnitude of effects, followed by noncore SFs (Figure 2B). Factors related with chromatin structure and remodeling
showed a narrower range of milder effects (Figure 2B), although
their values were clearly above the range of changes observed in
mock knockdown samples. Of interest, knockdown of core factors leads to stronger exon skipping effects, while noncore SFs
and other RNA processing and chromatin-related factors show
more balanced effects (Figures S3B and S3C).
To further dissect the effects of core components, we subdivided them into four categories depending on the timing and
duration of their recruitment to splicing complexes during
spliceosome assembly (Wahl et al., 2009): (1) persistent components (e.g., 17S U2 snRNPs, Sm proteins) that enter the assembly process before or during complex A formation and remain
until completion of the reaction, (2) transient early components
that join the reaction prior to B complex activation but are scarce
at later stages of the process, (3) transient middle components
joining during B-act complex formation, and (4) transient late
components that are only present during or after C complex formation. Our results indicate that knockdowns of factors that
persist during spliceosome assembly cause AS changes of
higher magnitude than those caused by knockdowns of transient
factors involved in early spliceosomal complexes, which in turn
are stronger and more dispersed than those caused by factors
involved in middle complexes and in complex C formation or catalytic activation (Figure 2C). As observed for core factors in general, knockdown of persistent factors tends to favor skipping,
while the effects of knockdown of more transient factors are
more split between inclusion and skipping (Figures S3B and
S3C).
Interestingly, knockdowns of components of the exon junction
complex (EJC) display a range of effects that resembles those of
transient early or mid splicing complexes (Figure 2C). These results are in line with recent reports documenting effects of EJC
components in AS, in addition to their standard function in postsplicing processes (Ashton-Beaucage et al., 2010).
To test whether the knockdown of core factors causes a general inhibition of splicing, we measured the levels of introns (both
in constitutive and alternatively spliced regions) relative to exons

	  
	  

	  
	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

in four genes, upon the knockdown of four SFs (BRR2, SF3B1,
SNRPG, and SLU7). The results shown in Figure 3 reveal a
complex picture in which retention of certain introns is clearly
increased and retention of other introns is very mild, and there
is even one case (the two introns flanking the fibronectin EDI
alternative exon) in which the low levels of intron detected under
control conditions are reduced upon knockdown of core SFs
(notably, this ASE typically displays a distinct pattern of AS
upon knockdown of core SFs, Figure 2A). Therefore, rather
than a general uniform inhibition of splicing, reduction in the
levels of core SFs induces differential effects in different introns,
a concept reminiscent of the differential effects observed for
antitumor drugs targeting core components like SF3B1 (Bonnal
et al., 2012).
Reconstruction of a Functional Network of Splicing
Factors
To systematically and accurately map the functional relationships of SFs on AS regulation, we quantified the similarity between AS perturbation profiles for every pair of factors in our
screen using a robust correlation estimate for the effects of the
factors’ knockdowns across the ASEs. This measure captures
the congruence between the shapes of perturbation profiles,
while it does not take into account proportional differences in
the magnitude of the fluctuations. Crucially, it discriminates between biological and technical outliers and is resistant to distorting effects of the latter (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
We next employed glasso, a regularization-based algorithm
for graphical model selection (Friedman et al., 2008; Supplemental Experimental Procedures), to reconstruct a network
from these correlation estimates (Figures 4A and S4). Glasso
seeks a parsimonious network model for the observed correlations. This is achieved by specifying a regularization parameter,
which serves as a penalty that can be tuned in order to control
the number of inferred connections (network sparsity) and therefore the false discovery rate (FDR) of the final model. For a given
regularization parameter, both the number of inferred connections and the FDR are a decreasing function of the number of
ASEs assayed (Figure 4B). Random sampling with different subsets of the real or reshuffled versions of the data indicates that
network reconstruction converges to ~500 connections with a
FDR <5% near 35 events (Figure 4B), implying that analysis of
additional ASEs in the screening would have only small effects
on network sparsity and accuracy.
The complete network of functional interactions among the
screened factors is shown in Figure 4A. It is comprised of 196
nodes representing screened factors and 541 connections
(average degree 5.5), of which 518 correspond to positive and
23 to negative functional associations. The topology of the resulting network has several key features. First, two classes of
factors are easily distinguishable. The first class encompasses
factors that form densely connected clusters comprised of
core spliceosomal components (Figure 4A). Factors physically
linked within U2 snRNP and factors functionally related with U2
snRNP activity, and with the transition from complex A to B,
form a tight cluster (orange nodes in the inset of Figure 4A). An
adjacent but distinct highly linked cluster corresponds mainly
to factors physically associated within U5 snRNP or the U4/5/6

tri-snRNP (blue nodes in Figure 4A, inset). Factors in these clusters and their mutual links encompass 23% of the network nodes
but 63% of the total inferred functional associations (average
degree 14.5). A second category includes factors that form
a periphery of lower connectivity that occasionally projects
to the core. This category includes many of the classical
splicing regulators (e.g., SR proteins, hnRNPs) as well as several
chromatin factors. An intermediate category—more densely interconnected but not reaching the density of interactions of
the central modules—includes multiple members of the RNAdependent DEAD/X box helicase family. While the number of
connections (degree) is significantly higher for core spliceosomal
factors in general (Figure 4C), this is especially clear for factors
that represent persistent components of splicing complexes
along the assembly pathway (Figures 4D and 4E). Persistent
factors are particularly well connected to each other (50% of
the possible functional connections are actually detected, Figure 4E). Factors that belong to consecutive complexes are significantly more linked to each other than factors that belong to early
and late complexes, and factors that transiently assemble toward the final stages of spliceosome assembly display the least
number of connections (Figures 4D and 4E).
Collectively, these results indicate that core SFs, particularly
those that persist during assembly, display highly related functions in splice site recognition and fluctuations in their levels or
activities have related consequences on the modulation of splice
site choice. Of the observed connections, 20% can be attributed
to known physical interactions and 82% of these are among core
components (Figure 4A). Examples include tight links between
the two subunits of U2AF, between the interacting partners
PLRG1 and CDC5L or IK and SMU1. We estimate that about
50% of the functional links detected in our network could be predicted by previous knowledge of the composition or function of
splicing complexes.
Of relevance, a substantial number of the functional associations closely recapitulate the composition and even—to some
extent—the topology of known spliceosomal complexes (Figure S4; see also below and Discussion). These observations
suggest that differences in the sensitivity of ASEs to SF perturbations reflect the specific role of these factors in the splicing
process. Conversely, these results warrant the use of splicing
perturbation profiles as proxies for inferring physical or functional links between factors in the splicing process.
Generality of the Functional Interactions in the AS
Regulation Network
The above network was derived from variations in 35 ASEs
selected because of their relevance for cell proliferation and
apoptosis, but they represent a heterogeneous collection of AS
types and, possibly, regulatory mechanisms. To identify functional connections persistent across AS types, we undertook a
subsampling approach. We sampled subsets of 17 from the
original 35 ASEs and iteratively reconstructed the network of
functional associations from each subset (see Supplementary
methods). Following 10,000 iterations, we asked how many
functional connections were recovered in at least 90% of the
sampled networks. The retrieved set of connections are shown
in Figure 5A and they can be considered to represent a ‘‘basal’’

or indispensable splicing circuitry that captures close similarities
in function between SFs regardless of the subset of splicing
substrates considered. The majority of these connections correspond to links between core components, with modules corresponding to major spliceosomal complexes. For example, the
majority of components of U2 snRNP constitute the most prominent of the core modules (Figure 5A). Strikingly, the module
is topologically subdivided in two submodules, the first corresponding to components of the SF3a and SF3b complexes
and the second corresponding to proteins in the Sm complex.
The connectivity between U2 snRNP components remarkably
recapitulates known topological features of U2 snRNP organization, including the assembly of SF3a/b complexes in stem loops
I and II and the assembly of the Sm ring in a different region
of the U2 snRNA (Behrens et al., 1993) (Figures 5A and S4).
That the connectivity between components derived from assessing the effects on AS of depletion of these factors correlates
with topological features of the organization of the snRNP further
argues that the functions in splice site selection are tightly linked
to the structure and function of this particle, highlighting the
potential resolution of our approach for identifying meaningful
structural and mechanistic links.
A second prominent ‘‘core’’ module corresponds to factors
known to play roles in conformational changes previous to/
concomitant with catalysis in spliceosomes from yeast to human, including PRP8, PRP31 or U5-200. Once again some of
the topological features of the module are compatible with physical associations between these factors (e.g., PRP8 with PRP31
or U5-116K or PRP31 with C20ORF14). That knockdown of
these late-acting factors, which coordinate the final steps of
the splicing process (Bottner et al., 2005; Hä cker et al., 2008;
Wahl et al., 2009), causes coherent changes in splice site selection strongly argues that the complex process of spliceosome
assembly can be modulated at late steps, or even at the time
of catalysis, to affect splice site choice. Other links in the
‘‘core’’ network recapitulate physical interactions, including the
aforementioned modules involving the two subunits of the 3’
splice site-recognizing factor U2AF, the interacting partners
PLRG1 and CDC5L and IK and SMU1.
To further evaluate the generality of our approach, we tested
whether the functional concordance derived from our network
analysis and from the iterative selection of a ‘‘core’’ network
could be recapitulated in a different cell context and genomewide. We focused our attention in the strong functional association between IK and SMU1, two factors that have been
described as associated with complex B and its transition to
Bact (Bessonov et al., 2008) (Figure 5A). Analysis of the effects
of knockdown of these factors in the same sets of ASEs in
HEK293 cells revealed a similar set of associations, despite
the fact that individual events display different splicing ratios
upon IK/SMU1 knockdown in this cell line compared to HeLa
(Figures 5B and 5C). To explore the validity of this functional
association in a larger set of splicing events, RNA was isolated
in biological triplicates from HeLa cells transfected with
siRNAs against these factors, and changes in AS were assessed
using genome-wide splicing-sensitive microarrays. The results
revealed a striking overlap between the effects of IK and
SMU1 knockdown, both on gene expression changes and on

AS changes (61% overlap, p < 1E-20) covering a wide range of
gene expression levels, fold differences in isoform ratios and AS
types (Figures 5D–5F, S5B, and S5C). The overlap was much
more limited with RBM6, a splicing regulator (Bechara et al.,
2013) located elsewhere in the network. These results validate
the strong functional similarities between IK and SMU1 detected
in our analysis. The molecular basis for this link could be explained by the depletion of each protein (but not their mRNA)
upon knockdown of the other factor, consistent with formation
of a heterodimer of the two proteins and destabilization of
one partner after depletion of the other (Figure S5A). Notably,
the best correlation between the effects of these factors was between IK knockdown for 48 hr and SMU1 knockdown for 72 hr,
perhaps reflecting a stronger functional effect of IK on AS regulation (Figures S2B and S2D).
Gene ontology analysis revealed a clear common enrichment
of AS changes in genes involved in cell death and survival (Figure S5D), suggesting that IK/SMU1 could play a role in the
control of programmed cell death through AS. To evaluate this
possibility, we tested the effects of knockdown of these factors,
individually or combined, on cell proliferation and apoptotic assays. The results indicated that their depletion activated cleavage of PARP, substantially reduced cell growth, and increased
the fraction of cells undergoing apoptosis (Figures S5E–S5G).
We conclude that functional links revealed by the network can
be used to infer common mechanisms of splicing regulation
and provide insights into the biological framework of the regulatory circuits involved.

	  

Ancillary Functional Network Interactions Reveal
Alternative Mechanisms of AS Regulation
The iterative generation of networks from subsets of ASEs explained above could, in addition to identifying general functional
interactions, be used to capture functional links that are specific
to particular classes of events characterized by distinct regulatory mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we sought the set
of functional connections that are robustly recovered in a significant fraction of ASEs subsets but are absent in others (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Figure 6A shows the
set of such identified interactions, which therefore represents
specific functional links that only emerge when particular subsets of ASEs are considered. The inset represents graphically
the results of principal component analysis (PCA) showing the
variability in the strength of these interactions depending on

the presence or absence of different ASEs across the subsamples. The most discriminatory set of ASEs for separating these
interactions is also shown (see also Figure S6). While this analysis may be constrained by the limited number of events
analyzed and higher FDR due to multiple testing, it can provide
a valuable tool for discovering regulatory mechanisms underlying specific classes of ASEs as illustrated by the example
below.
A synergistic link was identified between hnRNP C and U2AF1
(the 35 kDa subunit of U2AF, which recognizes the AG dinucleotide at 3’ splice sites) for a subset of ASEs (Figures 6A and S6A).
We explored a possible relationship between the effects of
knocking down these factors and the presence of consensus
hnRNP C binding sites (characterized by stretches of uridine residues) or 3’ splice site-like motifs in the vicinity of the regulated
exons. The results revealed a significant correlation between
the two factors (0.795), associated with the presence of composite elements comprised of putative hnRNP C binding sites within
sequences conforming to a 3’ splice site motif (see Experimental
Procedures) upstream and/or downstream of the regulated
exons (Figures 6B and S6B). No such correlation was observed
for ASEs lacking these sequence features (Figures 6C and S6C).
These observations are in line with results from a recent report
revealing that hnRNP C prevents exonization of Alu elements
by competing the binding of U2AF to Alu sequences (Zarnack
et al., 2013). Our results extend these findings by capturing functional relationships between hnRNP C and U2AF in ASEs that
harbor binding sites for these factors in the vicinity of the regulated splice sites, both inside of Alu elements or independent
of them (Figures 6B and 6D). Our data are compatible with a
model in which uridine-rich and 3’ splice site-like sequences
sequester U2AF away from the regulated splice sites, causing
alternative exon skipping, while hnRNP C displaces U2AF
away from these decoy sites, facilitating exon inclusion. In this
model, depletion of U2AF and hnRNP C are expected to display
the same effects in these ASEs, as observed in our data (Figures
6B and 6D). In contrast, in ASEs in which hnRNP C binding sites
are located within the polypyrimidine tract of the 3’ splice site of
the regulated exon, the two factors display antagonistic effects
(Figures 6C and 6D), as expected from direct competition between them at a functional splice site. This example illustrates
the potential of the network approach to identify molecular
mechanisms of regulation on the basis of specific sequence features and the interplay between cognate factors.

Positive or negative functional correlations are represented by green or red edges, respectively. Edge thickness signifies the strength of the functional
interaction, while node size is proportional to the overall impact (median Z score) of a given knockdown in the regulation of AS. Node coloring depicts the
network’s natural separation in coherent modules (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Known physical interactions as reported in the STRING
database (Franceschini et al., 2013) are represented in black dotted lines between factors. The inset is an expanded view of factors in the U2 and U4/5/6 snRNP
complexes.

Mapping Drug Targets within the Spliceosome
Another application of our network analysis is to identify possible
targets within the splicing machinery of physiological or external
(e.g., pharmacological) perturbations that produce changes in
AS that can be measured using the same experimental setting.
The similarity between profiles of AS changes induced by such
perturbations and the knockdown of particular factors can help
to uncover SFs that mediate their effects. To evaluate the potential of this approach, cells were treated with drugs known to
affect AS decisions and the patterns of changes in the 35
ASEs induced by these treatments were assessed by the same
robotized procedure for RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis
used to locate their position within the network.
The results indicate that structurally similar drugs like Spliceostatin A (SSA) and Meayamycin cause AS changes that
closely resemble the effects of knocking down components of
U2 snRNP (Figure 7A), including close links between these drugs
and SF3B1, a known physical target of SSA (Kaida et al., 2007;
Hasegawa et al., 2011) previously implicated in mediating the effects of the drug through alterations in the AS of cell cycle genes
(Corrionero et al., 2011). Of interest, changes in AS of MCL1
(leading to the production of the proapoptotic mRNA isoform)
appear as prominent effects of both drugs (Figure 7B), confirming and extending recent observations obtained using Meayamycin (Gao et al., 2013) and suggesting that this ASE can play
a key general role in mediating the antiproliferative effects of
drugs that target core splicing components like SF3B1 (Bonnal
et al., 2012). A strong link is also captured between each of the
drugs and PPIH (Figure 7A), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase
which has been found to be associated with U4/5/6 tri-snRNP
(Horowitz et al., 1997; Teigelkamp et al., 1998) but had not
been implicated directly in 3’ splice site regulation. Indeed, the
network indicates a close relationship between PPIH and multiple U2 snRNP components, particularly in the SF3a and SF3b
complexes, further arguing that PPIH plays a role in 3’ splice
site definition closely linked to branchpoint recognition by U2
snRNP. Treatment of the cells with the Clk (Cdc2-like) kinase
family inhibitor TG003, which is also known to modulate AS (Muraki et al., 2004) and causes changes in ASEs analyzed in our
network (Figure 7B), led to links with a completely different set
of SFs (Figure 7A), attesting to the specificity of the results. These
data confirm the potential of the network analysis to identify
bona fide SF targets of physiological or pharmacological perturbations and further our understanding of the the underlying molecular mechanisms of regulation.
DISCUSSION
The combined experimental and computational approach
described in this manuscript provides a rich source of information and a powerful toolset for studying the splicing process
and its regulation. Similar approaches could be useful to systematically capture information about other aspects of transcrip-

tional or posttranscriptional gene regulation. The data provide
comprehensive information about SFs (and some additional
chromatin factors) relevant to understand the regulation of 35
ASEs important for cell proliferation and apoptosis. Second,
the network analysis reveals functional links between SFs, which
in some cases are based upon physical interactions. The reconstruction of the known topology of some complexes (e.g., U2
snRNP) by the network suggests that the approach captures
important aspects of the operation of these particles and
therefore has the potential to provide novel insights into the
composition and intricate workings of multiple Spliceosomal
subcomplexes. Third, the network can serve as a resource for
exploring mechanisms of AS regulation induced by perturbations of the system, including genetic manipulations, internal
or external stimuli, or exposure to drugs. As an example, the
network was used in the accompanying manuscript by Tejedor
et al. (2014) to identify a link between AS changes induced by
variations in intracellular iron and the function of SRSF7, which
can be explained in terms of iron-induced changes in the RNA
binding and splicing regulatory activity of this zinc-knuckle-containing SR protein. Other examples include (1) the identification
of the extensive regulatory overlap between the interacting proteins IK/RED and SMU1, relevant for the control of programmed
cell death; (2) evidence for a general role of uridine-rich hnRNP C
binding sequences (some associated with transposable elements; Zarnack et al., 2013) in the regulation of nearby alternative exons via antagonism with U2AF; and (3) delineation of U2
snRNP components and other factors, including PPIH, that are
functionally linked to the effects of antitumor drugs on AS.
Our data reveal changes of AS regulation mediated either by
core splicing components or by classical regulatory factors like
proteins of the SR and hnRNP families. While the central core
of functional links is likely to operate globally, alternative configurations (particularly in the periphery of the network) are likely to
emerge if similar approaches are applied to other cell types,
genes, or biological contexts. We report considerable versatility
in the effects of core spliceosome factors on alternative spicing.
Precedents exist for a role of core SFs on the regulation of
splicing efficiency or splice site selection in yeast, Drosophila,
and mammalian cells (Clark et al., 2002; Park et al., 2004; Pleiss
et al., 2007; Saltzman et al., 2011). Despite their assumed general roles in the splicing process, depletion or mutation of
particular core factors led to differential splicing effects in these
studies, and at least in some cases the differential effects could
be attributed to particular features of the regulated pre-mRNAs.
For example, Clark et al. (2002) found that the core components
Prp17p and Prp18p are dispensable for splicing of yeast introns
with short branchpoint to 3’ splice site distances. Pleiss et al.
(2007) found that introns of yeast ribosome protein genes
are particularly sensitive to mutation of various core factors,
including two DEAD/X box family of RNA helicases (PRP2 and
PRP5) involved in spliceosome conformational transitions and
PRP8, a highly conserved protein involved in catalytic activation

(Collins and Guthrie, 1999; Mozaffari-Jovin et al., 2012). Distinct
effects of the mutations on different ribosomal genes were also
observed, arguing again for specific effects on splicing of certain
genes. DEAD/H box proteins as well as components of U1, U2,
and U4/6 snRNP were found to modulate particular ASEs in an
RNAi screen of RNA binding proteins in Drosophila cells (Park
et al., 2004). In contrast with the standard function of classical
splicing regulators acting through cognate binding sites specific
to certain target RNAs, core factors could both carry out general,
essential functions for intron removal and in addition display regulatory potential if their levels become limiting for the function of
complexes, leading to differences in the efficiency or kinetics of
assembly on alternative splice sites. This could be the case for
the knockdown of SmB/B0, a component of the Sm complex present in most spliceosomal snRNPs, which leads to autoregulation of its own pre-mRNA as well as to effects on hundreds of
other ASEs, particularly in genes encoding RNA processing factors (Saltzman et al., 2011).
The results of our genome-wide siRNA screen for regulators of
Fas AS (Tejedor et al., 2014) provide unbiased evidence that an
extensive number of core SFs have the potential to contribute to
the regulation of splice site selection. This is, in fact, the most
populated category of screen hits. Similarly, the results of our
network highlight coherent effects on alternative splice site
choice of multiple core components, revealing also that the
extent of their effects on alternative splice site selection can be
largely attributed to the duration and order of their recruitment
in the splicing reaction.
Remarkably, effects on splice site selection are associated
with depletion not only of complexes involved in early splice
site recognition but also of factors involved in complex B formation or even in catalytic activation of fully assembled spliceosomes. While particular examples of AS regulation at the time
of the transition from complex A to B and even at later steps
had been reported (House and Lynch, 2006; Bonnal et al.,
2008; Lallena et al., 2002), our results indicate that the implication
of late factors is quite general. Such links, e.g., those involving
PRP8 and other interacting factors closely positioned near the reacting chemical groups at the time of catalysis, like PRP31 or U5
200KD, are actually part of the persistent functional interactions
that emerge from the analysis of any subsample of ASEs
analyzed, highlighting their general regulatory potential in splice
site selection. How can factors involved in late steps of the
splicing process influence splice site choices? It is conceivable
that limiting amounts of late spliceosome components would
favor splicing of alternative splice site pairs harboring early complexes that can more efficiently recruit late factors, or influence
the kinetics of conformational changes required for catalysis. In
this context, the regulatory plasticity revealed by our network
analysis may be contributed, at least in part, by the emerging realization that a substantial number of SFs contain disordered regions when analyzed in isolation (Korneta and Bujnicki, 2012;
Chen and Moore, 2014). Such regions may be flexible to adopt

different conformations in the presence of other spliceosomal
components, allowing alternative routes for spliceosome assembly on different introns, with some pathways being more sensitive
than others to the depletion of a general factor.
Kinetic effects on the assembly and/or engagement of splice
sites to undergo catalysis would be particularly effective if spliceosome assembly is not an irreversible process. Results of single molecule analysis are indeed compatible with this concept
(Tseng and Cheng, 2008; Abelson et al., 2010; Hoskins et al.,
2011; Hoskins and Moore, 2012; Shcherbakova et al., 2013),
thus opening the extraordinary complexity of conformational
transitions and dynamic compositional changes of the spliceosome as possible targets for regulation. Interestingly, while
depletion of early factors tends to favor exon skipping, depletion
of late factors causes a similar number of exon inclusion and
skipping effects, suggesting high plasticity in splice site choice
at this stage of the process.
Given this potential, it is conceivable that modulation of the
relative concentration of core components can function as a
physiological mechanism for splicing regulation, for example
during development and cell differentiation. Indeed, variations
in the relative levels of core spliceosomal components have
been reported (Wong et al., 2013). Furthermore, recent reports
revealed the high incidence of mutations in core SFs in cancer.
For example, the gene encoding SF3B1, a component of U2
snRNP involved in branchpoint recognition, has been described
as among the most highly mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (Yoshida et al., 2011), chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Quesada et al., 2012), and other cancers (reviewed in Bonnal
et al., 2012), correlating with different disease outcomes.
Remarkably, SF3B1 is the physical target of antitumor drugs
like Spliceostatin A and—likely—Meayamycin, as captured by
our study. These observations are again consistent with the
idea that depletion, mutation, or drug-mediated inactivation of
core SFs may not simply cause a collapse of the splicing process—at least under conditions of limited physical or functional
depletion—but rather lead to changes in splice site selection that
can contribute to physiological, pathological, or therapeutic outcomes. SF3B1 participates in the stabilization and proofreading
of U2 snRNP binding to the branchpoint region (Corrionero et al.,
2011), and it is therefore possible that variations in the activity of
this protein result in switches between alternative 3’ splice sites
harboring branch sites with different strengths and/or flanking
decoy binding sites. Similar concepts may apply to explain the
effects of mutations in other SFs linked to disease, including,
for example, mutations in PRP8 leading to retinitis pigmentosa
(Pena et al., 2007).
In summary, the data and methodological approaches presented in this study provide a rich resource for understanding
the function of the spliceosome and the mechanisms of AS regulation, including the identification of targets of physiological,
pathological, or pharmacological perturbations within the complex splicing machinery.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

	  

on a FDR of 0.5/kbp of random in- tronic sequences generated using a
second-order Markov chain of actual in- tronic regions.

siRNA Library Transfection and mRNA Extraction
HeLa cells were transfected in biological triplicates with siRNAs pools
(ON TARGET plus smartpool, Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific) against
270 splicing and chromatin remodeling factors (see Table S2).
Endogenous mRNAs were purified 72 hr posttransfection by using oligo
dT-coated 96-well plates (mRNA catcher PLUS, Life Technologies)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA samples
corresponding to treatments with splicing arresting drugs were isolated
with the Maxwell 16 LEV simplyRNA kit (Promega).

	  

RT-PCR and High-Throughput Capillary Electrophoresis
Cellular mRNAs were reverse transcribed using Superscript III Retro
Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) following the
manufacturer’s recom- mendations. PCR reactions for every individual
splicing event analyzed were carried out using forward and reverse
primers in exonic sequences flanking the alternatively spliced region of
interest and further reagents provided in the GOTaq DNA polymerase kit
(GoTaq, Promega). Primers used in this study are listed in Table S6.
HTCE measurements for the different splicing isoforms were performed
in 96-well format in a Labchip GX Caliper workstation (Caliper, Perkin
Elmer) us- ing a HT DNA High Sensitivity LabChip chip (Perkin Elmer).
Data values were obtained using the Labchip GX software analysis tool
(version 3.0).

	  

Quantification of AS Changes from HTCE Measurements
Robust estimates of isoform ratios upon siRNA or pharmacological
treatments were obtained using the median PSI indexes of the biological
triplicates for each knockdown-AS pair. From this value xi the effect of
each treatment was summarized as a robust Z score (Birmingham et al.,
2009):

We considered as probable HNRPC binding sites consecutive stretches of
U{4} as reported in Zarnack et al. (2013). Annotation of ALU elements
was based on the RepeatMasker track developed by Arian Smit
(http://www. repeatmasker.org) and the Repbase library (Jurka et al.,
2005).
More detailed experimental procedures are provided
in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

Robust Sample Correlation Estimation
Robust correlation estimation is based on an iterative weighting
algorithm that discriminates between technical outliers and reliable
measure- ments with high leverage. The weighting for mea- surements
relies on calculation of a reliability index that takes into account their
cumulative influence on correlation estimates of the complete data
set. Algorithmic details are provided in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Network Reconstruction
The process of network reconstruction relies on the regularization-based
graphical lasso (glasso) algorithm for graphical model selection (Friedman
et al., 2008). The glasso process for network reconstruction was
implemented using the glasso R package by Jerome Friedman, Trevor
Hastie, and Rob Tibshirani (http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/glasso/). A
detailed exposition of the algorithmic steps for network reconstruction and
analysis, glasso, and its use for graphical model selection is provided in
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Principal Component Analysis of Ancillary Connections
PCA for ancillary edges was performed using R-mode PCA (R function
prin- comp). The input data set is the scaled 95 3 35 matrix containing the
absolute average correlation for each of the 95 edges over the subsets of
the 10,000 samples that included each of the 35 events. The coordinates
for projecting the 95 edges are directly derived from their scores on the
first two principal components. The arrows representing the top ten
discriminatory events (based on the vector norm of the first two PC
loadings) were drawn from the origin to the coordinate defined by the first
two PC loadings scaled by a con- stant factor for display purposes.
Splice Site Scoring, Identification of Probable HNRPC Binding Sites
and Alu Elements
For the identification and scoring of 3’ ss we used custom-built position
weight
matrices (PWMs) of length 21—8 intronic plus three exonic positions.
The matrices were built using a set of human splice sites from constitutive,
internal exons compiled from the hg19 UCSC annotation database
(Karolchik et al., 2014). Background nucleotide frequencies were estimated
from a set of strictly intronic regions. Threshold was set based

Figure	  S1.	  Consistent	  profiles	  of	  AS	  changes	  and	  limited	  cell	  death	  induced	  by	  the	  
knockdown	   of	   core	   components	   using	   different	   siRNAs.	   	  A.	  AS	  perturbation	  profiles	  
obtained	  for	  depletion	  of	  SNRPG,	  P14	  or	  SF3B1	  using	  two	  different	  siRNAs	  .	  Robust	  
correlation	   between	   conditions	   and	   siRNA	   sequences	   used	   for	   factor	   depletion	   are	  
indicated.	  Positive	  Z-­‐scores	  indicate	  changes	  towards	  exon	  inclusion,	  negative	  values	  
indicate	   exon	   skipping.	   B.	   Knockdown	   efficiency	   for	   a	   subset	   of	   splicing	   factor

Drug	  Treatments	  
Pharmacological	   treatments	   with	   splicing	   arresting	   drugs	   were	   performed	   as	  
described	   in	   Corrionero	   et	   al.	   (2011).	   HeLa	   cells	   were	   treated	   for	   3	   hours	   with	  
Spliceostatin	  A	   260	  nM	  or	  8	  hours	  with	  Meayamycin	   20	  nM	  or	  TG003	  10	  µM.	  RNA

35	  splicing	  events	  were	  performed	  as	  described	  above.	  	  
	  
Cell	  proliferation	  assays	  
HeLa	   cells	  were	  forward-­‐transfected	  with	  siRNAs	  targeting	  IK,	  SMU1	  or	  both	  genes	  
by	   plating	   2500	   cells	   over	   a	   mixture	   containing	   siRNA-­‐RNAiMAX	   lipofectamine	  
complexes,	   as	   previously	   described.	   Indirect	   estimations	   of	   cell	   proliferation	   were	  
obtained	   24,	   48	   and	   72	   hours	   post	   transfection	   by	   treating	   the	   cells	   for	   4h	   with	  
resazurin	   (5	   µM)	   prior	   to	   the	   fluorescence	   measurements	   (544	   nm	   excitation	   and	  
590	   nm	   emission	   wavelengths).	   Plate	   values	   were	   obtained	   with	   an	   Infinite	   200	   PRO

Cell	  apoptosis	  assays	  
Hela	  cells	  were	  transfected	  with	  siRNAs	  against	  IK,	  SMU1	  or	  both	  genes,	  as	  described	  
above.	   Cells	   were	   trypsinized	   and	   collected	   for	   analysis	   72	   hours	   post	   transfection.	  
Pellets	   were	   washed	   once	   with	   complete	   DMEM	   medium	   (10%	   serum	   plus	  
antibiotics),	   and	   three	   times	   with	   PBS	   1X.	   Cells	   were	   then	   resuspended	   in	   200	   µl	  
Binding	   buffer	   provided	   by	   the	   Annexin	   V-­‐FITC	   Apoptosis	   Detection	   Kit	  
(eBiosciences),	   resulting	   in	   a	   final	   density	   of	   4x105	   cells/ml.	   5	   µl	   of	   Annexin	   V-­‐FITC	  
was	   added	   to	   each	   sample	   followed	   by	   10	   min	   incubation	   at	   room	   temperature	   in	  
dark	   conditions.	   Cells	   were	   washed	   once	   with	   500	   µl	   binding	   buffer	   and	   incubated	  
with	  10	  µl	  propidium	  iodide	  (20	  µg/ml)	  for	  5	  minutes.	  FACS	  analysis	  was	  performed

1.1. Removal	  of	  sparse	  variables	  and	  imputation	  of	  missing	  values.

1.

	  Data	  preprocessing	  and	  reduction.	  
	  

1.1	  Removal	  of	  sparse	  variables	  and	  imputation	  of	  missing	  values	  
Estimation	  of	  the	  sample	  covariance	  matrix	  requires	  complete	  data.	  However	  the	  p	  x	  
n	  matrix	  that	  contains	  the	  measurements	  of	  the	  p	  variables	  (genes)	  in	  n	  conditions	  
(ASEs)	  includes	  missing	  (NA)	  values.	  In	  order	  to	  overcome	  this	  problem,	  first	  sparse	  
variables	   (#NA	   values	   >	   n/2)	   are	   removed.	   The	   remaining	   missing	   values	   are	  
subsequently	  filled-­‐in	  by	  applying	  k-­‐nearest-­‐neighbor	  based	  imputation	  (Hastie	  et	  al.,	  
1999,	   R	   function	   impute	   available	   as	   part	   of	   the	   bioconductor	   project	   at	  
http://www.bioconductor.org/).	  For	  the	  purposes	  of	  this	  work	  we	  set	  k=ceiling(0.25	  
sqrt(p)).	  
	  
1.2	  Removal	  of	  uninformative	  ASEs.	  
ASEs	  not	  affected	  to	  a	  significant	  degree	  (median	  absolute	  (ΔPSI)<1)	  by	  the	  KDs	  offer	  
little	  information	  on	  the	  genes’	  covariance	  and	  can	  potentially	  introduce	  noise	  and	  
are	  thus	  discarded	  from	  subsequent	  analyses.	  	  
	  
	  
1.3	  Data	  Scaling.	  
Prior	  to	  sample	  covariance	  estimation	  the	  data	  matrix	  is	  standardized	  along	  the	  gene	  
dimensions.	  Standardization	  of	  the	  events	  ensures	  that	  only	  the	  shape	  and	  not	  the	  
magnitude	  of	  the	  fluctuations	  is	  taken	  into	  account	  for	  covariance	  estimation	  and	  it	  
is	  equivalent	  to	  using	  correlation	  in	  lieu	  of	  covariance	  in	  all	  downstream	  analyses.	  	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

	  
2.	  Robust	  sample	  correlation	  estimation.	  
When	   outliers	   are	   present	   they	   dominate	   the	   correlation	   estimates.	   In	   order	   to	  
overcome	   the	   sensitivity	   of	   sample	   correlation	   to	   outliers	   we	   derive	   robust	  
correlation	  estimates	  based	  on	  a	  weighting	  algorithm	  that	  attempts	  to	  discriminate	  
between	  technical	  outliers	  and	  reliable	  influential	  measurements.	  
In	   particular,	   starting	   with	   an	   M	   =	   p	   x	   n	   dataset	   of	   p	   standardized	   variables	   and	   n	  
samples	   we	   wish	   to	   derive	   a	   robust	   correlation	   p	   x	   p	   matrix.	   We	   calculate	   the	  
influence	   of	   a	   sample	   u	   in	   the	   estimation	   of	   the	   correlation	   of	   two	   variables	   Xa,	   Xb	  
using	  the	  deleted	  residual	  distance:	  
!! !! , !! = ! !! , !! − !!! !! , !! !

	  
Where	  p(Xa,	  Xb)	  and	  	  p-­‐u(Xa,Xb)	  are	  the	  Pearson’s	  correlation	  estimates	  before	  or	  after	  
removing	  the	  observations	  Mau,	  Mbu	  coming	  from	  sample	  u.	  
!
A	  measure	  of	  the	  reliability	  𝑅!,!
	  of	  these	  measurements	  for	  the	  estimation	  of	  p(Xa,	  

Xb)	  given	  all	  the	  observed	  data	  is	  then	  based	  on	  their	  cumulative	  influence	  on	  high	  
correlates	  of	  Xa,	  and	  Xb:

T	  	  being	  a	  minimum	  correlation	  threshold	  for	  considering	  a	  pair	  of	  variables.	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

The	   final	   robust	   correlation	   estimates	   are	   finally	   calculated	   as	   the	   weighted	  
Pearson’s	   correlation	   p(Xa,	   Xb;w)	   where	   w	   is	   a	   vector	   of	   weights	   of	   length	   n	  
!
containing	  the	  values	  𝑅!,!
  for	  every	  observation	  u.	  	  

Intuitively,	   if	   an	   observation	   Mau	   distorts	   correlation	   estimates	   among	   all	   highly	  
correlated	   partners	   of	   Xa	   it	   is	   considered	   an	   outlier	   and	   is	   down-­‐weighted.	   On	   the	  
other	  hand	  if	  including	  this	  observation	  yields	  similar	  correlation	  estimates	  for	  most	  
of	   these	   pairs	   it	   is	   considered	   reliable	   even	   if	   its	   influence	   on	   the	   individual	   estimate	  
of	   p(Xa,	   Xb)	   is	   high.	   The	   advantage	   of	   this	   procedure	   is	   that	   it	   derives	   weights	   for	  
individual	   measurements	   (as	   opposed	   to	   a	   single	   weight	   for	   every	   sample)	   while	  
taking	  into	  account	  the	  complete	  dataset.	  
The	   algorithm	   can	   be	   used	   iteratively,	   however	   in	   our	   experience	   the	   estimates	  
converge	  within	  1	  to	  2	  iterations.	  	  R	  code	  for	  implementing	  this	  algorithm	  is	  available	  
upon	  request.	  Examples	  of	  robust	  correlation	  estimates	  and	  regression	  based	  on	  this	  

4

metric	  and	  taken	  from	  our	  dataset	  are	  shown	  below:

Undirected	   graphical	   models	   (UGMs)	   such	   as	   Markov	   random	   fields	   (MRFs)	  
represent	   real-­‐world	   networks	   and	   attempt	   to	   capture	   important	   structural	   and	  
functional	   aspects	   of	   the	   network	   in	   the	   graph	   structure.	   The	   graph	   structure	  
encodes	  

conditional	  

independence	  

assumptions	  

between	  

variables	  

corresponding	  to	  nodes	  of	  the	  network.	  The	  problem	  of	  recovering	  the	  structure	  
of	  the	  graph	  is	  known	  as	  model	  selection	  or	  covariance	  estimation.	  	  
	  

In	  particular,	  let	  G=(V,E)	  be	  an	  undirected	  graph	  on	  p=|V|	  nodes.	  Given	  n	  

independent,	   identically	   distributed	   (i.i.d)	   samples	   of	   X=(X1,…,Xp),	   we	   wish	   to	  
identify	   the	   underlying	   graph	   structure.	   We	   restrict	   the	   analysis	   to	   Gaussian	  
MRFs	   where	   the	   model	   assumes	   that	   the	   observations	   are	   generated	   from	   a	  
multivariate	   Gaussian	   distribution	   N(µ,Σ).	   Based	   on	   the	   observation	   that	   in	   the	  
Gaussian	   setting,	   zero	   components	   of	   the	   inverse	   covariance	   matrix	   Σ-­‐1	  
correspond	   to	   conditional	   independencies	   given	   the	   other	   variables,	   different	  
approaches	  have	  been	  proposed	  in	  order	  to	  estimate	  Σ-­‐1.	  
Graphical	  lasso	  (gLasso)	  provides	  an	  attractive	  solution	  to	  the	  problem	  of	  
covariance	   estimation	   for	   undirected	   models,	   when	   graph	   sparsity	   is	   a	   goal	  
(Friedman	   et	   al.,	   2008).	   The	   gLasso	   algorithm	   has	   the	   advantage	   of	   being	  
consistent,	   i.e.	   in	   the	   presence	   of	   infinite	   samples	   its	   parameter	   estimates	   will	   be	  
arbitrarily	  close	  to	  the	  true	  estimates	  with	  probability	  1.	  
L1	  regularization	  (lasso)	  is	  a	  smooth	  form	  of	  subset	  selection	  for	  achieving	  
sparsity.	   In	   the	   case	   of	   gLasso	   the	   model	   is	   constructed	   by	   optimizing	   the	   log-­‐
likelihood	  function:	  

	  

	  

	  

	  

log det Θ − !" !Θ − ! Θ ! !

Where	   Θ	   is	   an	   estimate	   for	   the	   inverse	   covariance	   matrix	   Σ-­‐1,	   S	   is	   the	   empirical	  
covariance	  matrix	  of	  the	  data,	  ||Θ||1	  is	  the	  L1	  norm	  i.e	  the	  sum	  of	  the	  absolute	  
values	   of	   all	   elements	   in	   Θ	   -­‐1,	   and	   r	   is	   a	   regularization	   parameter	   (in	   this	   case	  
selected	   based	   on	   estimates	   of	   the	   FDR,	   see	   below).	   The	   solution	   to	   the	   glasso	  
optimization	  is	  convex	  and	  can	  be	  obtained	  using	  coordinate	  descent.	  
The	   glasso	   process	   for	   network	   reconstruction	   was	   implemented	   using	   the	   glasso	  
R	   package	   by	   Jerome	   Friedman,	   Trevor	   Hastie	   and	   Rob	   Tibshirani	  
(http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/glasso/).	  
	  
4.	  Partition	  of	  Network	  into	  modules.	  
Network	   modules	   or	   communities	   can	   be	   defined	   loosely	   as	   sets	   of	   nodes	   with	   a	  
more	  dense	  connection	  pattern	  among	  their	  members	  than	  between	  their	  members	  
and	   the	   remainder	   of	   the.	   Module	   detection	   in	   real-­‐world	   graphs	   is	   a	   problem	   of	  
considerable	   practical	   interest	   as	   they	   often	   capture	   meaningful	   functional	  
groupings.	  
	  

Typically	   community	   structure	   detection	   methods	   try	   to	   maximize	  

modularity,	  a	  measure	  of	  the	  overall	  quality	  of	  a	  certain	  network	  partition	  in	  terms	  
of	  the	  identified	  modules	  (Newman,	  2006).	  In	  particular,	  for	  a	  network	  partition	   p,	  
the	  network	  modularity	  M(p)	  is	  defined	  as:	  	  
!

! ! =
!!!

!!

where	   m	   is	   the	   number	   of	   modules	   in	   p,	   	   lk	   is	   the	   number	   of	   connections	   within	  
module	   k,	   L	   is	   the	   total	   number	   of	   network	   connections	   and	   dk	   is	   the	   sum	   of	   the	  
degrees	  of	  the	  nodes	  in	  module	  k.	  
Here,	  we	  identify	  modules	  of	  genes	  that	  exhibit	  similar	  perturbation	  profiles	  among	  
the	   assayed	   events	   by	   maximizing	   the	   network’s	   modularity	   using	   the	   greedy	  
community	   detection	   algorithm	   (Clauset	   et	   al.,	   2004)	   implemented	   in	   the	  
fastgreedy.community	   function	   of	   the	   igraph	   package	   (Csardi	   and	   Nepusz,	   2006,	  
http://igraph.sourceforge.net/doc/R/fastgreedy.community.html).
