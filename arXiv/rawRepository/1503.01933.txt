Abstract
The word-based account of saccades drawn by a central gravity of the PVL is
supported by two pillars of evidences. The first is the finding of the initial fixation
location on a word resembled a normal distribution (Rayner, 1979). The other is the
finding of a moderate slope coefficient between the launch site and the landing site
(b=0.49, see McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, & Zola, 1988). Four simulations on different
saccade targeting strategies and one eye-movement experiment of Chinese reading
have been conducted to evaluate the two findings. We demonstrated that the current
understanding of the word-based account is not conclusive by showing an alternative
strategy of the word-based account and identifying the problem with the calculation
of the slope coefficient. Although almost all the computational models of eyemovement control during reading have built on the two findings, future efforts should
be directed to understand the precise contribution of different saccade targeting
strategies, and to know how their weighting might vary across desperate writing
systems.

Visual system is constrained by inhomogeneous visual acuity across the retina
with the fovea as the most acute part. During reading, it is well believed that, to
compensate this limitation, the fovea is constantly directed to an optimal position. In
line with it, it has been observed that the initial fixations on a word appear a normal
distribution (i.e., the initial fixation location distribution, IFLD), the peak of which
lies somewhere around the center of the word (e.g., Deutsch & Rayner, 1999; Dodge,
1906; Dunn-Rankin, 1978; Rayner, 1979; Rayner, Sereno, & Raney, 1996; Reingold,
Reichle, Glaholt, & Sheridan, 2012; Vitu, O’Regan, & Mittau, 1990). According to
the word-based account, this point has been referred as the preferred viewing location
(PVL), which can prioritize ongoing lexical processing (Rayner, 1979).
To further explain the generation of the IFLD, especially the PVL, the range
effect has been found to indicate a central gravity of the PVL to draw eyes (e.g.,
McConkie et al., 1988). The range effect describes a pattern of variation of the
saccade length as the launch sites (i.e., prior fixations) approaching the center of the
next words. In another word, saccades tend to undershoot or overshoot the next word
center when eyes are far away from or close to it, respectively.
Almost all the computational models of eye-movement control during reading
have incorporated the PVL and the range effect as the mechanism of saccade targeting
(e.g., Bayesian reader: Engbert, & Krügel, 2010; SWIFT: Engbert, Nuthmann,
Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; E-Z Reader: Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998;
Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 1999; Glenmore: Reilly & Radach, 2006). However, the
purpose of the present note is trying to evaluate the word-based account by offering
an alternative strategy that produces the similar IFLD and identifying the problem of
the range effect with its method of calculation.

An alternative strategy of saccade targeting in producing the similar IFLD
The word-based account in general states that the adjustment of saccade targeting
to an optimal position is influenced by the information of word length. Logically
speaking, there are two possible loci—either on the landing word or on the launch
word— being the candidates of optimal positions. Therefore, to explain the generation
of the PVL, saccades could converge to that point directly or alternatively, be tuned to
an optimal position on the launch word before a move of constant length to that point.
The first strategy, which is widely accepted, can be seen as a direct instantiation of the
word-based account.
The alternative strategy, which is what we propose, assumes that the adjustment
takes place at the launch site instead of the landing site. The eyes re-fixate to an
optimal site on the launch word by an intra-word saccade before an inter-word
saccade of constant length to the next word. Consequently, saccades under this
strategy may coincidentally locate around the center of the next word, generating the
similar IFLD. Thus, this strategy can be seen as an indirect instantiation of the wordbased account.
To test the alternative strategy, four models were built based on different
assumptions of saccade targeting strategies in a writing system assembled as the
alphabetic language (i.e., spaced). During simulations, each model was run to “read”
100,000 artificial sentences, each of which consisted of 10 different words. The
lengths of the first and last words in each sentence maintained 1, and the lengths of
the other words were random permutations between 2 and 9. For simplicity, the same
Greek symbols in the following formulae represent the parameters for different
models. Their corresponding values are listed in Table 1.

Model I assumes that eyes move in a constant saccade length. Parameter φ is a
constant representing the minimal saccade length. The inter-word saccade length, or
INTER-SL is given by:
INTER-SL = φ, with a Gaussian noise N (0, σ) for saccade error

(1)

Model II and III assume that readers adjust their saccade length based on the
distance between the launch site and the center of the next word. For Model II, the
saccade length becomes longer when the launch site approaching the center of the
next word. In this case, the landing site tries to move away from the center of the next
word, so the slope coefficient between the launch site and the landing site is large (b >
1). For Model III, the saccade length becomes shorter when the launch site
approaching the center of the next word, so the slope coefficient between the launch
site and the landing site is moderate (0 < b < 1). Model III is exactly the same
mechanism as McConkie et al.’s to adjust the landing site. D represents the distance
between the launch site and the center of next word. β is a parameter that modulates
this distance. The inter-word saccade length, or INTER-SL, for Model II and III is
given by:
INTER-SL = φ + β × D, with a Gaussian noise N (0, σ) for saccade error (2)
Model IV assumes that readers adjust the launch site by making an intra-word
saccade and then making an inter-word saccade of constant length. This model is the
alternative strategy proposed by this note. E denotes the eccentricity acuity, or the
center of the fixated word subtracting the launch site. π and λ are parameters that
modulate the influence of visual acuity on the probability of intra-word saccade.
The intra-word saccade probability, or INTRA-SP is given by:
INTRA-SP = (|πE|)λ

(3)

The intra-word saccade length, or INTRA-SL is given by:

5

INTRA-SL = E, with a Gaussian noise N (0, ς) for saccade error

(4)

The inter-word saccade length, or INTER-SL is given by:
INTER-SL = φ, with a Gaussian noise N (0, σ) for saccade error

(5)

Figure 1 shows the IFLD for each model. In Model I, the IFLD was flat at first
and suddenly dropped after some positions (Figure. 1a). In Model II, the IFLD
decreased slightly at first and suddenly dropped after some positions (Figure. 1b). In
Model III and IV, both IFLD resembled the normal distribution (Figure. 1c-d),
meaning that the saccade pattern produced by Model IV, the alternative strategy, was
also consistent with the qualitative patterns of eye movement observed during
alphabetic reading.
The existing problem of range effect
The range effect is essential to support the direct instantiation of word-based
account (McConkie et al., 1988). As stated above, it reflects the variation of the
saccade length as the function of the distance between the launch site and the center
of the next word. It is indicated by a moderate slope coefficient (0 < b < 1) between
the landing site and the launch site. However, the traditional way to calculate this
coefficient is problematic because of data selection. Due to the presupposed wordbased account, the calculation used incoming saccades, the saccades that shot exactly
on the target word after they launched from the word prior to that target word.
Conversely, we propose to use outgoing saccades which are any forward saccades that
launch from words immediately preceding the target words, including not only shot
but also undershot and overshot at the target word.
Figure 2 shows the coefficients between the launch site and the landing site of
the above four models for incoming and outgoing saccades, respectively. For outgoing
saccades, only in Model III the slope coefficient was within a moderate range (0.48 ≤

6

b ≤ 0.50; see Table 2). For incoming saccades, however, the slope coefficients
maintain moderate for all four models (0.15 ≤ b ≤ 0.79; see Table 2). Therefore, the
range effect based on the slope coefficient calculated from incoming saccades is
insufficient to discriminate different saccade targeting strategies.
Figure 3 also shows the relationship between the launch site and the landing
site for incoming and outgoing saccades but from an eye-movement experiment of
Chinese reading (Liu, Li, & Pollatsek, submitted for review).While the slope
coefficient for outgoing saccades was larger than 1, for incoming saccades, it was still
within a moderate range (b = 0.42). In a language system that has no specific PVL due
to the absence of blank spaces between words (see Liu, Li, & Rayner, 2011; cf., Yan,
Kliegl, Richter, Nuthmann, & Shu, 2010), the persistent range effect leads to an
obvious contradiction.
Discussion and Conclusion
The aim of this note is to evaluate the word-based account and their
corresponding evidences. We have demonstrated that the central tendency of IFLD
can be produced by direct and indirect instantiation of the word-based account
equivalently. It should be noted that both strategies are not necessary to mutually
exclusive, the selection of strategy may depend on the certainty for perceiving the
center of next word. As a result, it is better to weight both strategies to account for the
complicated pattern of saccade targeting behaviors during reading. Moreover, we
have shown that the slope coefficients of incoming saccades maintain moderate,
irrespective of the underlying saccade targeting strategies. Thereby, the range effect
calculated from the traditional way is unable to confirm or deny any specific
mechanism of saccade targeting.

The intra-word refixation saccades exist broadly during reading (e.g., the Ushaped function of refixation probability; McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, Zola, & Jacobs,
1989; Rayner et al., 1996, see Figure 3). We should reconsider the role they might
play. In the alternative strategy, when the launch site is far away from the center of the
next word, it is likely to make a rightward refixation on the prior word. Conversely,
when the launch site is close to the center of the next word, it is likely to make a
leftward refixation on the prior word. It is possible during real reading that the
summation of the intra-word saccades and the subsequent approximately constant
inter-word saccades acts like the range effect to produce the central tendency of the
IFLD on the next word. If then, the intra-word saccades may not only contribute to
process the current word but also assist eyes to target on the PVL of the next word for
further processing.
During reading, due to systematic and random errors in the oculomotor system,
there are rather broad and overlapping tails between the distributions of within-word
landing positions (e.g., Engbert & Nuthmann, 2008; McConkie et al., 1988). The tails
cannot be ignored and excluded arbitrarily as undershot or overshot at the target word.
Otherwise, the central tendency of the target word will always exhibit. We believe that
the use of outgoing saccades to calculate the range effect is more promising to
discriminate different saccade targeting strategies. For instance, the slope coefficient
of outgoing saccades in model II was larger than 1. The strategy underling this model
is consistent with the converged evidences from studies of Chinese reading in which
saccade length increases with more parafoveal processing (Liu, Reichle, & Li, 2014;
Liu et al., submitted for review). Meanwhile, the slope coefficient of outgoing
saccades in model IV was moderate, given the underlying assumption that eyes were
guided to the center of the next word directly.

8

In summary, our evaluation raises question about the word-based account and the
underlying models. Further empirical and modeling works should attend to figure out
which strategy or even a combination of them is a better account of eye movement
control during reading, and to know their abilities of adaption to disparate writing
systems.

Figure 1. Simulation of the frequency distribution of initial fixation location on the
target word for the four models. In Model I, the saccade length was constant; in
Model II, the saccade length became longer when approaching the center of next
word; in Model III, the saccade length became shorter when approaching the center of
next word; in Model IV, eyes made an intra-word saccade to the center of the fixated
word with a probability, then made a constant inter-word saccade to the right. All
saccades in these models have Gaussian saccade errors. The abscissas shows the
character position on the target word, with 0 indicating the blank space immediately
to the left of the target word.
Figure 2. The saccade landing site as a function of the launch site. The graph shows
the simulated data and regression lines fitted to incoming saccades and outgoing
saccades. The launch site and the landing site were aligned to the center of the target
word (length = 5). The ordinate value represents the position of saccade targeting
relative to the target word. 0 is on the word center, -3 to 3 is within the word (light
gray diamonds), less than -3 is undershot of the word (lower gray triangular), and
more than 3 is overshot of the word (upper gray triangular). The abscissa value
represents the distance from the launch site on the prior word to the center of the
target word. The four models were defined identical with those in Figure 1.

respectively. The launch site and the landing site for incoming saccades are aligned to
the center of the target word (2 characters), but for outgoing saccades, they are
aligned to the center of the word immediately following the target word (also 2
