Running title : ActVB/ActVA, a two component FMN-dependent monooxygenase

1

SUMMARY

The two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases belong to an emerging class of
enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in a number of metabolic and biosynthetic pathways
in microorganisms. One component is a NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase which provides a
reduced flavin to the second component, the proper monooxygenase. There, the reduced
flavin activates molecular oxygen for substrate oxidation. Here, we study the flavin reductase
ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 gene product, both reported to be involved in the last step of
biosynthesis of the natural antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. For the first
time, we show that ActVA-ORF5 is a FMN-dependent monooxygenase which together with
the help of the flavin reductase ActVB catalyze the oxidation reaction. The mechanism of the
transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has been investigated.
Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin (FMNox and FMNred) with regard
to ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 have been determined. The data clearly demonstrate a
thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to ActVA-ORF5, without involving a
particular interaction between the two protein components. In full agreement with these data,
we propose a reaction mechanism in which FMNox binds to ActVB where it is reduced and
the resulting FMNred moves to ActVA-ORF5 where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species
within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.

INTRODUCTION

There is a great variety of monooxygenases, catalyzing oxygen activation and oxygen
transfer reactions in the living world. The most extensively studied ones are the cytochrome
P450-dependent monooxygenases (1) and the enzymes belonging to the methane
monooxygenase family (2), both using an iron center for O2 activation. Also physiologically
important are the flavin-dependent monooxygenases. These systems can be divided into two
groups. The first one consists in enzymes with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or flavin
mononucleotide (FMN) as prosthetic groups, in which reduction of the flavin by reduced
pyridine nucleotides, NADH or NADPH, and oxidation of substrates are carried out on a
single polypeptide chain (3). Recently emerged a second class of enzymes which utilize the
flavin, FAD or FMN, as a cosubstrate rather than a prosthetic group. A separate
NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase is thus required to supply reduced flavins that bind to the
oxygenase component where they activate O2 for substrate oxidation (Scheme 1) (4).
Therefore, in this two-component system, NAD(P)H oxidation and the hydroxylation reaction
are catalyzed by separate polypeptides. For years, the only prototype for this class of
monooxygenases was the luciferase enzyme which has been the subject of numerous studies
(3,5,6). However, it is only recently that the importance of such systems in oxidative
metabolism, in particular within microorganisms, has been realized.
If we except the enzymes involved in the luciferase reaction, the flavin reductases
associated with the oxygenase component display strong sequence homologies (4). These
flavin reductases have been extensively studied from a biochemical (7-10) and a structural
point of view (11,12). On the other hand, much less is known on the structure and the
enzymatic mechanisms of the monooxygenase component.

The monooxygenase components can be further divided into two groups on the basis
of the type of the flavin used in the reaction. The first group consists in FADH2-utilizing
monooxygenases which are represented by several well-characterized systems such as 4hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase (HpaB) of Escherichia coli (13) and 2,4,5trichlorophenol monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia (14,15). 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
monooxygenase (TcpA) from Ralstonia eutropha (16), phenol hydroxylase (Phe A1) from
Bacillus thermoglucosidasius (9) and styrene monooxygenase (StyA) from Pseudomonas
flurescens ST (17,18) belong to that family but have not been characterized yet. The second
group consists in FMNH2-utilizing monooxygenases which have been much less investigated
in terms of their structure, mechanism and substrate specificity. Examples of such FMNdependent systems are those involved in the synthesis of the antibiotic pristinamycin in
Streptomyces pristinaespiralis (19,20), biodegradation of polyaminocarboxylates such as
ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) (21) or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) (22) by
microorganisms, utilization of sulfur from aliphatic sulfonates (23) and desulfurization of
fossil fuels by Rhodococcus species (24).
The results reported here concern the enzyme system we have selected to study the
chemistry of FMN-utilizing monooxygenases. The system participates to the last step of the
biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor (Scheme 2) which
consists in the hydroxylation of the precursor dihydrokalafungin and the coupling of two
molecules of the hydroxylated product (25-27).
Indications that this step was catalyzed by a two-component flavin-dependent
monooxygenase came from genetic (25) and biochemical studies (7,10,25). Actinorhodin
biosynthesis involves about 20 proteins whose corresponding genes are localized in the same
region of the chromosome (27). Inactivation of the actVB gene resulted in the accumulation of
dihydrokalafungin without any production of actinorhodin (25). Purification and

4

characterization of ActVB demonstrated that ActVB was a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase,
therefore suggesting that it serves to provide reduced FMN to a monooxygenase involved in
dihydrokalafungin oxidation catalysis (7,10). The same phenotype was observed when a
second region of the chromosome, named actVA, was inactivated (26) . This region contains 6
open reading frames (ORFs) (26). Here, we identify ActVA-ORF5 as the monooxygenase
associated with ActVB. Overexpression in E. coli allowed us to purify it and to characterize
the FMN-dependent activation of molecular oxygen by the ActVA-ActVB system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. FMN, NADH, DHAQ (1,5-dihydroanthraquinone) were purchased from
Sigma or Aldrich. Other reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from Euromedex.
Deazaflavin (5-Deaza-5-carbariboflavin) was a gift from Philippe Simon (Grenoble, France).
Construction of ActVA-ORF5 expression plasmid. Plasmid pIJ2305 containing the
whole actV region (28) was isolated from Streptomyces coelicolor with the Plasmid Midiprep
Kit (Qiagen). ActVA-ORF5 gene was amplified by PCR from pIJ2305 using the primer 5’GGAATTCCATATGAGCGAGGACACGATGACC-3’ (EcoR1 and Nde1 restriction sites
underlined) and the reverse primer 5’-CGCGGATCCTCAGCCATCGTTGCTCCTCCT-3’
(BamH1 restriction site underlined). The PCR product was digested by EcoR1-BamH1 and
the resulting fragment was ligated into pUC18 (pUC18-ActVA). This plasmid was sequenced
in order to confirm that no changes had been introduced in the actVA-ORF5 sequence during
PCR. The Nde1-BamH1 fragment derived from pUC18-ActVA was subsequently cloned into
pT7-7 at the same restriction sites, resulting in the plasmid named pActVA used for the
overexpression of the actVA-ORF5 gene product.

Overexpression and purification of ActVA-ORF5. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS
harboring pActVA was grown at 37 °C and 220 rpm in a 3-liter flask containing 1 liter of
Luria and Bertani medium in the presence of 200 µg/ml ampicillin and 34 µg/ml
chloramphenicol. Expression of ActVA-ORF5 was induced by adding IPTG to a final
concentration of 380 µM when an OD600nm = 0.4 was reached. After 5-6 hours of growth, cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10%
glycerol (buffer A). All the following steps, except cell disruption, were performed at 4 °C.
Extraction of soluble proteins was performed by lysozyme treatment (0.5 mg/ml lysozyme,
incubation time 45 min at room temperature) followed by French Press disruption. The
resulting cell extract was clarified by ultracentifugation at 45,000 rpm during 90 min (rotor TI
50.2 Beckman) and the supernatant was used as crude extract for purification. Crude extract
(700 mg in proteins) was loaded onto a 60 ml Q Sepharose XL column (Pharmacia),
previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was then washed with 60 ml of buffer A
plus 25 mM NaCl and the proteins were eluted with a linear 0-500 mM NaCl gradient.
Fractions containing ActVA, eluted with 120 mM NaCl, were pooled and concentrated to 2
ml by ultrafiltration using a 10,000 MW regenerated cellulose membrane (Amicon). 30% of
the total protein fraction was lost in this step, probably due to irreversible adsorption to the
membrane. The concentrated fraction was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column
(120 ml, from Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer A and then eluted
with the same buffer. Fractions containing pure ActVA, about 95 % as determined by SDSPAGE electrophoresis, were pooled, concentrated as described above and stored at –80 °C.
Preparation of apoActVB. Overexprexion and purification of His-tagged ActVB was
carried out as previously reported (10). All the following steps were performed at 4 °C.
Purified His-tagged ActVB (2 mg) was loaded onto a 1 ml Ni-NTA column (Pharmacia) and
treated with 1.5 column volumes of 2 M KBr and 2 M Urea, at acidic pH (29). Renaturation

6

on the column was achieved with 4 column volumes of Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.6, 10 %
glycerol and the protein was recovered with 3 column volumes of 500 mM imidazole, 25 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10% glycerol. As apoActVB was unstable in the presence of imidazole, the
protein solution was immediately loaded onto a Nap 10 column and eluted with 25 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6, glycerol 10%. The yield of the overall process was about 40%.
Analytical Determinations. The native molecular mass of ActVA was determined with
an analytical Superdex 200 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.6 containing 150 mM NaCl. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45
kDa), chymotrypsin (20.1 kDa) and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) were used as markers of
molecular mass. The void volume was determined with ferritin (450 kDa). Protein
concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, with bovine serum
albumin as a standard.
Flavin Binding to ActVA-ORF5 and ActVB. UV-Visible absorbance spectra were
recorded with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 photodiode array instrument at 18°C. Kd values of
FMNox for ActVB and ActVA were calculated from the variation of the absorbance values at
the selected wavelengths, using eq 1:
(Ax - Ao)/(Af - Ao) = ([FMNtot] ¥ [proteinfree])/(Kd + [proteinfree]) (1)
where A0 is the initial absorbance, Ax the absorbance after a given addition of the protein, Af
the absorbance at the end of the titration. Making the hypothesis that ActVA and ActVB
contain one binding site per monomer, [FMNbound] and [proteinfree] were calculated from the
total concentrations of FMN ([FMNtot]), and protein ([proteintot]), using eq 2 and eq 3:
[FMNbound] = (Ax - Ao)/(Af - Ao) ¥ [FMNtot] (2)
[proteinfree] = [proteintot] - [FMNbound]

(3)

ActVA fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 18 °C with a Jasco FP 6500
spectrofluorimeter, using a 1 cm square cuvette (Helma). The excitation wavelength was set

7

to 295 nm. The measured fluorescence spectra were corrected from inner filter effects due to
FMNox or FMNred absorption during excitation as well as during emission. The corrected
fluorescence (Fcorr) was calculated according to the method described in (30), using eq 4:

where L is the cuvette full path length (1 cm), [FMN] the total concentration of FMN, eex, the
extinction coefficient of FMN at excitation wavelength (295 nm), e em, the extinction
coefficient of FMN for each emission wavelength between 300 and 400 nm. Since the inner
filter effect is not homogenous in the entire cuvette, we divided it into 100 identical points
and defined their position by x and y coordinates making the hypothesis that their surfaces are
infinitely small. For each position and each wavelength between 295 and 400 nm, the factors
representing the inner filter effect were calculated and were subsequently summed in order to
determine an F corrected (Fcorr) value. Fcorr precisely corresponds to the intrinsic protein
fluorescence.
Kd values were calculated from the variation of the corrected fluorescence intensity at
338 nm (Fcorr) using eqs 1, 2 and 3.
Anaerobic experiments. Anaerobic experiments were performed in a Jacomex glove
box equipped with a UV-visible cell coupled to a Uvikon XL spectrophotometer by optical
fibers (Photonetics system). All the solutions were incubated anaerobically 2 hours before the
beginning of each experiment. For FMN reduction, an FMN stock solution (500 mM) was
anaerobically and quantitatively photoreduced by 30 min irradiation with a commercial slide
projector placed at a distance of 3 cm, in the presence of 2 mM deazaflavin and 10 mM
EDTA. For oxidation of reduced flavin, as a standard procedure, aerated water was prepared
for each experiment by bubbling a 100 % oxygen gas for 30 min into an air-tight eppendorff
tube containing 1 ml of water. FMNred oxidation was performed in the anaerobic glove box by
8

injecting 5 m l of the oxygen saturated water (1 mM) into a 100 mL air-tight
spectrophotometric cuvette with an Hamilton syringe.

RESULTS

ActVA-ORF5 as the potential flavin-dependent hydroxylase
Among the six genes present in the actVA region (26), only ORF5 displays sequence
homologies with flavin-dependent hydroxylases. This becomes particularly obvious when the
sequence of the corresponding protein is compared to the product of the tdsC gene from
Paenibacillus spA11-2 (31) and the product of the pheA gene (32) (Supplementary data
Figure 1). TdsC is a FMN-utilizing monooxygenase associated with TdsD, a NADH:FMN
oxidoreductase, and involved in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (31). A similar system is
found in Rhodococcus erytropolis with DszC acting as a FMN-utilizing monooxygenase and
DszD as a NADH:FMN oxidoreductase displaying strong sequence homologies with ActVB
(24). Therefore, this analysis suggests that actVA-ORF5 gene product might be the
monooxygenase associated with ActVB for the last step of actinorhodin biosynthesis.

Purification of ActVA-ORF5
The details of the methods used to clone, express the actVA-ORF5 gene in E. coli and
purify the corresponding protein are given in the experimental section. Briefly, E. coli Bl 21
(DE3) pLysS strain was transformed with the expression vector pActVA-ORF5 derived from
pT 7-7 containing the actVA-ORF5 gene. Bacterial soluble extracts were subjected to an anion
exchange chromatography and the enriched fractions, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, were
further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. The protein was obtained 95 %

9

pure as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). No proteolysis occurred all
through the purification process (data not shown). Determination of its N-terminal sequence
(SEDTHT) confirmed that the purified protein was indeed the product of the actVA-ORF5
gene. For the sake of simplicity, in the following, this protein is named ActVA. Analysis by
mass spectroscopy showed that the protein, with a molecular mass of 39,715 Da, lacked the N
terminal methionine. Chromatography of pure ActVA on a calibrated Superdex 200 gel
filtration column showed that the protein was dimeric in solution, with an experimental mass
of about 77,000 Da (data not shown). Finally, no evidence for a protein-bound chromophore
could be obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy.
At room temperature the protein spontaneously precipitated in the presence of 250
mM NaCl. Thus, the following experiments using pure ActVA were carried out in 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, in the absence of salt.

ActVA-ORF5, an active monooxygenase system
The precursor of actinorhodin is dihydrokalafungin. However, this compound is not
commercially available and difficult to obtain either from natural sources (25) or by chemical
synthesis (33). Thus, we used 1,5-dihydroanthraquinone (DHAQ) as a substrate analog to
check whether the ActVA protein was indeed able to catalyze an hydroxylation reaction in
combination with ActVB. The assay mixture, under aerobic conditions, contained 200 µM
NADH, 5 µM FMN, 50 µM DHAQ, 11 nM ActVB and various amounts of ActVA, in 2 ml of
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6. After one hour at 30 °C, DHAQ and its oxidation products were
extracted with MeOH and analyzed by ESI-MS. As shown in Figure 1, a peak at m/z = 255
was observed besides the peak at m/z = 239 corresponding to DHAQ. This proved the
formation of a product corresponding to DHAQ plus one oxygen atom (+16), thus deriving
from DHAQ by monooxygenation. This peak was absent from the mass spectrum when one

10

of the following components of the system was excluded from the reaction mixture, FMN,
NADH, ActVB or DHAQ (data not shown). In addition, a control reaction carried out within
an anaerobic glove box did not result in the production of the oxygenated product either (data
not shown). In conclusion, taken together, these preliminary experiments reported here clearly
indicate that the product of the actVA-ORF5 gene is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase.

Interaction of FMN with ActVA and ActVB: dissociation constants
In order to determine the mechanism of the transfer of reduced flavins between ActVB
and ActVA, the dissociation constant (Kd) values for reduced and oxidized FMN with ActVB
and ActVA proteins were determined.
As reported previously, a significant proportion (20-30 %) of the purified ActVB
polypeptides contained one bound FMN (10). Removal of FMN for the production of ActVB
in the pure apoprotein form, named apoActVB, was thus achieved first prior to the binding
experiments. The use of the his-tagged form of ActVB bound to a Ni-NTA column allowed a
fast and efficient procedure for the preparation of apoActVB, as described in the experimental
section. The protein bound to the Ni-NTA column was treated first with a solution containing
2 M urea and 2 M KBr. This was followed by renaturation, elution with imidazole and
desalting. The protein obtained from that process retained its ability to bind FMN, as judged
from the appearance during incubation of apoActVB with FMN, of an absorption band,
centered to 457 nm, characteristic of the ActVB:FMN complex (10). ApoActVB was shown
to be active as a flavin reductase in a standard assay using NADH and riboflavin or FMN as
substrates, with Km values for flavins (data not shown) comparable to those obtained with the
as-isolated enzyme (10). Taken together, these data showed that apoActVB was fully active,
well-folded and could thus be used in our following investigations.

11

Figure 2 shows the UV-visible spectrum of the oxidized form of FMN (FMNox), under
three different conditions. The l max value of the low-energy visible band is 445 nm for free
FMNox, 438 nm for FMNox in the presence of an excess of ActVA and 457 nm for FMNox in
the presence of an excess of ActVB. This showed that FMNox bound to ActVB, as previously
demonstrated (10), but also to ActVA. Therefore, the l max value could be used as an
indicator for whether FMNox is free or bound to ActVA or ActVB.
As shown in Figure 3, aerobic titration of FMNox with increasing amounts of ActVA,
resulted in a shift of the FMNox visible absorption band from 445 to 438 nm. An isobestic
point was observed at 458 nm. A plot of bound FMN versus free ActVA, calculated from the
fractional absorbance change at 440 nm as described in the experimental section, gave a Kd
value of 19.4 ± 6.3 mM for FMNox with regard to ActVA (Inset of Figure 3).
A similar spectrophotometric titration of FMNox with ActVB was performed. Again
from the shift of the FMNox absorption band, from 445 to 457 nm as the concentration of
ActVB increased (isobestic point at 385 nm), a plot of bound FMN versus free ActVB,
calculated from the fractional absorbance change at 480 nm, gave a Kd value of 4.4 ± 0.6 mM
for FMNox with regard to ActVB (Supplementary data Figure 2).
Since FMNred does not exhibit marked absorbance bands, Kd values for FMNred could
not be obtained by the same spectrophotometric titration experiments. For that purpose, we
took advantage of specific spectroscopic properties of FMNred as described in the following.
In the case of ActVB, binding of FMNred in its active site in the presence of NAD+
results in the formation of a broad absorption band between 550 and 800 nm which is
characteristic for a charge-transfer (CT) complex between NAD+ and FMNred ((10) and Figure
4). Such a complex is also formed as the result of the oxidation of NADH by FMNox in the
active site of ActVB. As shown in Figure 4, the intensity of the charge transfer band increased
upon successive addition of FMNred in the presence of an excess of NAD+. A plot of the

12

bound ActVB versus free FMNred determined from the variation of the absorbance of the
charge transfer band at 680 nm gave a Kd value of 6.6 ± 0.6 mM for FMNred with regard to the
[ActVB-NAD+] complex (Inset Figure 4).
Finally, in the case of ActVA, the well-established ability of FMNred to quench the
fluorescence of the apoproteins (upon excitation of tryptophan residues at 295 nm) allowed us
to design another method for the determination of the Kd value for FMNred. This approach
could be also carried out with FMNox allowing comparison with the results described above,
obtained by UV-visible spectrophotometry. It should be mentioned that such experiments
could not be carried out with ActVB since the protein is totally devoid of trytophan residues
(27). Figure 5 shows a typical fluorescence quenching experiment for the ActVA-FMNox
combination. Addition of FMNox led to a decrease of the fluorescence intensity of the ActVA
apoprotein, excited at 295 nm, without any notable shift of the emission maximum (338 nm).
Inner filters due to the absorption of FMN between 295 and 400 nm were corrected as
described in the experimental section. As shown in the Inset of Figure 5, a plot of the bound
ActVA versus free FMN determined from the fluorescence intensity at 339 nm gave a Kd
value of 26.3 ± 3.2 mM for FMNox with regard to ActVA. This Kd value was consistent with
that obtained from the UV-visible titration experiments as described above. This indicates that
the fluorescence quenching experiment for the determination of Kd values is a reliable
approach.
When a similar fluorescence quenching experiment was carried out in anaerobiosis
(excitation at 295 nm), with ActVA, in the presence of increasing amounts FMNred produced
by deazaflavin photoreduction, the Kd value for FMNred was determined to be 0.39 ± 0.04 mM
(Supplementary data Figure 3).
Table 1 summarizes the K d values obtained here for both FMNox and FMNred,
characterizing their interaction with apoActVA and apoActVB. We deduce from these Kd

13

values that FMN transfer is thermodynamically favorable from ActVA to ActVB in the
oxidized state and from ActVB to ActVA in the reduced state.
This conclusion was confirmed by experiments showing irreversible transfer of FMNox
from ActVA to ActVB and of FMNred in the reverse direction. In the first one, 10 µM of
FMNox was complexed to an excess of ActVA (140 µM) and, accordingly, the light
absorption spectrum of the solution displayed a band centered at 438 nm (data not shown).
Addition of increasing amounts of apoActVB resulted in a shift of that band to lower energies
(data not shown). As shown in Figure 6, the l max value increased to reach 457 nm after
addition of about one equivalent of apoActVB with regard to ActVA, with no further changes
for larger apoActVB/ActVA ratios. The final value of l max was characteristic for the
FMNox-ActVB complex, demonstrating that FMNox, initially in ActVA, had been transferred
to and was bound to apoActVB. Taking into account the concentrations of the different
components in the solution, a total transfer of FMNox from ActVA to ActVB at a
[ActVB]/[ActVA] ratio of 1 was consistent with the Kd values reported in Table 1 1. In a
second experiment, FMNox was bound to an excess of ActVB (thus light-absorbing at 457
nm) and was reduced by NADH under anaerobic conditions (data not shown). Reduction
could be monitored by visible spectroscopy not only from the disappearance of the 457 nm
band, but also from the appearance of the broad absorption between 550 and 800 nm
characteristic for the CT complex between NAD+ and FMNred discussed above (Figure 4).
Anaerobic addition of one equivalent of ActVA resulted in the instantaneous disappearance of
about 90% of the latter absorption (data not shown). This indicated disruption of the chargetransfer complex, most likely resulting from a transfer of FMNred from ActVB to ActVA.

14

Oxidation of FMNH2 : evidence for a flavin-peroxide intermediate
As shown above, FMNred is a good ligand for ActVA. In the following, the study of
the reaction of the ActVA:FMNred complex with molecular oxygen is reported. In the
experiment shown in Figure 7, 16 µM FMNred were anaerobically incubated with 140 µM
ActVA, so that the flavin was totally complexed to the protein (Table 1). Addition of oxygensaturated water (50 µM O2 final concentration) resulted in the complete oxidation of the flavin
within 5 minutes as shown by light absorption spectroscopy (Figure 7). The final spectrum
with two bands at 370 nm and 438 nm, was superimposable to that of a preparation of
FMNox–containing ActVA. Therefore, it showed that the flavin stayed in the protein during
the whole oxidation reaction. In the inset of Figure 7, absorbances at 380 and 438 nm are
reported as the function of time, after addition of O2. At 380 nm, the kinetic trace indicated
that the reaction with O2 proceeded in two steps: an initial fast phase, occurring during
mixing, followed by a second slower phase. At 438 nm, only one phase was observed,
without evidence for the first rapid event observed at 380 nm. Without taking into account the
initial fast phase at 380 nm, both kinetics at 380 and 438 nm were found exponential, with the
same apparent first-order rate constant value k = 0.44 ± 0.02 min-1. Moreover, this rate
constant was not a function of O2 concentration (data not shown). This process was found to
be much slower than the oxidation of free FMNred under same conditions (data not shown),
suggesting that ActVA binds FMNred in an environment which protects it significantly from
oxidation.
The spectrum in Figure 7 (and in supplementary data Figure 4) observed at the very
beginning of the reaction (first spectrum after 15 s) is significantly different from that of
FMNox with a band at 380 nm more intense than at 440-450 nm. Together with the kinetic
analysis (see above), this suggests a fast formation of an intermediate flavin species absorbing
at 380 nm which then disappeared more slowly to generate FMNox. Based on the similarities

15

of this first spectrum and those reported in enzyme systems involving flavin-peroxide species,
usually absorbing at 380 nm (3), we might assign the observed intermediate spectrum to a
FMN-OOH species resulting from the reaction between FMNred and O2.
Oxidation of FMNred in complex with ActVA is also a very slow process when
compared to that of FMNred in complex with ActVB. This was shown in the experiment
described below. ActVB-FMNox complex was treated anaerobically with a slight excess of
NADH to generate ActVB-FMNred. Oxidation of the flavin was initiated by the addition of
aerated water and monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. In Figure 8 are shown the initial
oxidation rates Vi for the O2-dependent oxidation of ActVB-FMNred, in the presence of
increasing amounts of ActVA. The observation that Vi decreased with increased ActVA was
consistent with the notion that FMNred spontaneously moved from ActVB to ActVA and was
oxidized more slowly within the latter than within ActVB. As shown in Figure 8, in the
presence of one equivalent of ActVA compared to ActVB, the oxidation rate was similar to
that of ActVA-FMNred alone. This is in agreement with the much better affinity of FMNred for
ActVA than for ActVB. In addition, formation of FMNox within ActVB occurred with no
observable intermediate species absorbing at 380 nm (data not shown). Therefore a slow
oxidation process via a FMN-OOH species is specific for ActVA.
The supplementary data Figure 4 shows one of those experiments of Figure 8, in
which one equimolar amount of ActVA with respect to ActVB was added in the reaction
mixture. The difference with the experiment shown in Figure 7 is that the FMNred is provided
in the form of an ActVB-FMNred complex to the aerated solution of ActVA. The results
shown in supplementary data Figure 4 are very similar to that of Figure 7, with two
observable reaction steps and a comparable rate constant for the second slow step. Again, 15 s
after O2 addition, the UV-visible spectrum was different from that of FMNox, with a single
band at 380 nm, in agreement with a FMN-OOH intermediate within ActVA. This result

16

suggests that also in that case, FMNred oxidation occurred in ActVA, as a consequence of a
fast transfer of FMNred from ActVB to ActVA. Furthermore it shows that the oxidation
reaction is not affected by the presence of ActVB. The only noticeable difference with the
experiment in absence of ActVB (Figure 7) was that the final spectrum of the product FMNox
exhibited a maximum at 457 nm showing that at the end of the reaction, FMNox was bound to
ActVB.

Interaction of ActVA with ActVB
In order to verify that ActVA and ActVB might not form a complex in solution, the
following experiment has been carried out. When an equimolar mixture of His-tagged ActVB
and ActVA was loaded onto the Ni-NTA column, ActVA was totally recovered in the runthrough fraction and could not be detected in the imidazole fraction containing ActVB (data
not shown). These data suggest that there is no association between ActVA and ActVB.

DISCUSSION

The two-component flavin-dependent monoxygenases seem to be widely distributed
within the bacterial world and used in a large variety of biosynthetic and metabolic reactions.
However, while the flavin reductase component of these systems, which provides reduced
flavins required for O2 activation, has been the subject of detailed mechanistic and structural
studies, very little is known on the monooxygenase component, where the oxidation takes
place.
Our investigation of the final step of actinorhodin synthesis, which consists in the
conversion of dihydrokalafungin into actinorhodin (Scheme 2) led us to characterize such a

17

two-component FMN-dependent monooxygenase system. We first reported the purification
and the characterization of ActVB, the NADH:FMN oxidoreductase associated with the
reaction (10). The oxidation reaction itself is not a trivial reaction since it involves two
oxidation steps, a dimerization and an aromatic hydroxylation. Not only is the order of the
two steps still unknown but it is also not sure whether there are different genes for each step.
The ActVA region of the act cluster carries several genes involved in actinorhodin
biosynthesis (26). Because of the general difficulties in purifying the enzymes of that region
coupled with the lack of commercial substrates required for biochemical studies, so far only
ORF6 was assigned to a defined function, catalysis of the conversion of 6deoxydihydrokalafungin to dihydrokalafungin (34,35). However, we speculated that the
ORF5 product, named ActVA here for sake of simplicity, could be the enzyme partner of
ActVB for catalyzing one or the two steps of the oxidation of dihydrokalafungin to
actinorhodin for the following reasons. First, a DNA fragment containing the actVA-ORF5
region could cause Streptomyces sp. AM 7161, the producer of medermycin, an analog of
actinorhodin which lacks the C-8 hydroxyl group, to make mederrhodin A, which is
hydroxylated at C-8 (36). Secondly, as shown here, ORF5 displays significant similarities
with genes encoding flavin-dependent monooxygenases (Supplementary material Figure 1).
Our results strongly support this hypothesis. With a pure preparation of ActVA, reported here
for the first time, we clearly show that the ActVA-ActVB combination can catalyze an
hydroxylation reaction, using 1,5-dihydroanthraquinone as a substrate analog. Oxidation
absolutely requires NADH, FMN and molecular oxygen, supporting the notion that ActVB
serves for the production of reduced flavins whereas ActVA uses the latter to activate oxygen
and oxidize the organic substrate. Accordingly, even though it was purified with no
chromophore, we have shown that ActVA is able to bind FMNox, which displays a specific
light absorption spectrum with a low-energy transition at 438 nm. ActVA is also able to bind

18

FMNred, to which it provides protection from oxidation by air. With the true substrate,
dihydrokalafungin, when it is available, this in vitro system will allow us to conclude whether
dimerization and hydroxylation is catalyzed by the same enzyme and, if not, which step is
occurring first.
An interesting issue concerns the transfer of reduced flavin from one protein (ActVB)
to another (ActVA), its control and whether specific interactions between ActVB and ActVA
are required for that purpose.
The K d values for FMN, both in the reduced and the oxidized form, characterizing
their interaction with each component, ActVA and ActVB, have been carefully determined.
This is the first time that all these values are given with this class of enzymes. They indicate
that the flavin transfer between ActVA and ActVB is under a thermodynamic control, with a
preference of FMNox for ActVB and a much stronger affinity of ActVA for FMNred (Kd = 0.39
mM). The data showed that FMNox can be transferred from ActVA to ActVB (Figure 6) and
also that FMNred generated in ActVB by reduction of FMNox either by NADH or by
photoreduction can be removed from ActVB and transferred to ActVA. This was also in good
agreement with the observation that the oxidation of ActVB-FMNred by oxygen is greatly
slowed down upon addition of increasing amounts of apoActVA, as a consequence of FMNred
transfer to ActVA where oxidation occurs slowly (Figure 8).
All these results can thus be fitted into a very simple mechanism shown in Scheme 3.
At the very beginning of the reaction, FMNox binds to ActVB where it is reduced by NADH.
The resulting FMNred then diffuses out of ActVB and tightly binds to ActVA where it reacts
with oxygen. In this step a reactive intermediate is formed and used to hydroxylate the
substrate thus generating FMNox as will be discussed below. In the absence of the substrate it
is likely that the intermediate decomposes to form hydrogen peroxide. Then, in all cases,
FMNox diffuses out of ActVA and ends up into ActVB ready to start a new cycle. In this

19

mechanism, based on a thermodynamic control of the reaction, we do not find it necessary to
invoke a specific interaction between the two proteins and a complex channeling mechanism
allowing FMN to travel from one protein to another without equilibrating with FMN free in
solution. In fact, we did not get any evidence for a complex between ActVB and ActVA. It is
actually the case for most two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase systems that the
flavin reductase component and the monooxygenase component do not form a complex.
Furthermore, in most cases, the oxidoreductase component can be replaced by many flavin
reductases, including the non-homologous ones from other microorganisms. Therefore direct
protein-protein interactions are in general not essential.
In a few cases it has been reported that the monooxygenase component stabilizes C4a-flavin hydroperoxides in the absence of the substrate (3). One of the characteristics of
these species, which derive from the reaction of reduced flavins with molecular oxygen, is
their light absorption spectrum with a broad unique band at around 360-390 nm and the
absence of the absorption band at 440-450 nm present in the spectrum of oxidized flavins. In
the present study during oxidation of ActVA-FMNred or oxidation of ActVB-FMNred in the
presence of ActVA, we have observed that the reaction, in the absence of substrate, occurs in
two steps. In the first one, a species absorbing at 380 nm is rapidly generated, and in the
second one, the latter is slowly converted to FMNox. We thus assign the 380 nm-absorbing
species to a flavin hydroperoxide, FMN-OOH. The accumulation of the observed peroxide
and its slow decomposition in ActVA is consistent with the protective effect of ActVA with
regard to flavin oxidation by oxygen as discussed above. It is very likely that the flavin
hydroperoxide is the oxidizing agent which attacks the substrate within ActVA. Further
studies will address the substrate specificity of this interesting enzyme system as well as the
chemistry of the reaction between the flavin hydroperoxide and the substrate.

In a presence of both ActVB and ActVA, because FMN is in binding equilibrium with both

proteins, the concentration of bound FMN can be calculated with the following equation:
[FMN]bound = ([FMN]tot [ActVB]free)/[(KdActVB(1+([ActVA]free)/(KdActVA))+[ActVB]free)]
