Crosslinked semi-flexible and flexible filaments that are actively deformed by molecular motors
occur in various natural settings, such as the ordered eukaryotic flagellum, and the disordered
cytoskeleton. The deformation of these composite systems is driven by active motor forces and
resisted by passive filament elasticity, and structural constraints due to permanent cross-links. Using
a mean field theory for a one-dimensional ordered system, we show that the combination of motor
activity and finite filament extensibility yields a characteristic persistence length scale over which
active strain decays. This decay length is set by the ability of motors to respond to combination of
the weak extensional elasticity, passive shear resistance and the viscoelastic properties of the motor
assembly, and generalizes the notion of persistence in purely thermal filaments to active systems.

Semi-flexible and flexible filaments interacting with active molecular motors arise naturally in the cell as well as
in in-vitro motor assays [7–13]. The overall coordinated
macroscopic mechanical response of such a composite assembly depends on the coupling between the active motors and the passive properties of the aggregate composite. A structurally ordered example of such a system is
the eukaryotic flagellum comprised of relatively stiff filaments (microtubules), motors (dynein) and passive elastic elements (nexins) which together oscillate with well
defined wavelengths and frequencies [8, 14–16]. To understand how coordinated motion can arise in such a system, a variety of models of varying degree of complexity
[9–13] have been proposed; those show that the wavelength of active beating is correlated with increasing flagellum length. However, experimental evidence strongly
indicates that this relationship is altered for very long
lengths [17, 18] and that the wavelengths attained in nature are self-limiting [8, 9] even as the flagella themselves
range from tens of microns to nearly a centimeter. This
strongly suggests that over large lengths, mechanical information transmission degrades substantially.
Indeed, in a passive context [11], it has been demonstrated that when bundles of filaments are forced to bend,
the shearing forces between them are mediated by extensibility, leading to a characteristic scale over which
mechanical information is transmitted. In an active system such as an array of soft filaments interacting with
each other via motors, degradation of mechanical signal
transmission occurs because the weak passive extensibility of the filaments limits the range over which motorco-ordination can occur, while restrictions on the kinetics of motor activity set by ATP hydrolysis rates couple
back to weak extensibility and alter the interaction between motor groups significantly. We illustrate this in
Fig. 1(a) showing two distinct motor patches labeled I
and II that cross-link a pair of thin filaments that may
bend and shear. For inextensible filaments, mechanical
activity by group (I) leads to shear (sliding) in this patch
which is transmitted by attached motors in (II) over arbitrarily large inter-aggregate distances. For extensible
filaments, there is an interplay between shear/slide and

filament elongation along its contour and this leads to a
decrease in the ability of group (I) to mechanically link
with group (II). In this letter, we propose a minimal,
mean-field theory to study the decay of deformations generated by localized steady or oscillatory strains in active,
weakly noisy motor-filament assemblies. For simplicity
we focus on purely extensional systems ignoring bending modes of deformation and restrict ourselves to a one
dimensional setting.
The model system we analyze is illustrated in Fig.
1(b). A weakly extensible filament of length `, thickness w  `, Young’s modulus E and lateral extent b is
animated by active motor proteins that are spaced uniformly with fixed areal density ρm . These motors are attached to an underlying rigid, straight substrate. Passive
permanent cross-linkers connect the filament to the substrate maintaining a gap of size D (w ≤ D  `) between
the filament and the substrate. These cross-links, spaced
uniformly with areal density ρN , also act as linearly elastic springs of stiffness kN . Active motors are modeled as
linear elastic springs of stiffness km , that attach and detach from the elastic filament. The inter-link spacing and
the inter-motor spacing is assumed to be much smaller

2
than the filament length so that a continuum model is
appropriate. Thus when b  max(w, `), the assembly
acts as an effective one dimensional extensible composite
filament, with the passive permanent cross-linkers that
connect the filament to the substrate providing shear
resistance. The effective shear modulus resulting from
these passive springs is obtained by considering the relative displacement between the top sheet and bottom
sheets due to a shearing stress acting on an area b`; this
yields G∗ ∼ DkN ρN and G∗ w/D ∼ wkN ρN /2 - consistent with analysis of a passive cross-linked railway track
model [10].
Due to the motors, the filament is displaced horizontally as it is stretches. Let the displacement of a material point on the filament relative to its initial position
in the undeformed state be U (s, t), s being the material/reference coordinate, and t time. For an inertialess
filament, the sum of forces on the filament arising from
filament extensibility, springs and motors must vanish. If
Fm is the effective active force density per attached motor and ρm the (total) motor density, local stress balance
then yields
∂s (Kpas ∂s U ) − Gpas U + ρm Fm = 0.

(1)

Here Kpas ∼ Ew and Gpas ∼ ρN kN are the passive
stretching and passive shear moduli (per unit width)
for the composite filament. In the absence of activity,
Fm = 0 so that the solution to (1) yields an exponential profile for the displacement with a relaxation length
1
1
scale `E ≡ (Kpas /Gpas ) 2 = (Ew/ρN kN ) 2 , so that as the
passive shear resistance ρN kN increases, the persistence
length decreases.
When motors are present, Fm 6= 0. At the level of a
single motor, we assume that motors attach to the elastic
filament with an initial extension dm (that may vanish)
and are then stretched due to two effects - a sliding velocity relative to the filament as well as the displacement
of the filament due to the cumulative effect of other motors. Both of these lead to an increasing motor extension
y shown in Fig. 1(b). Assuming a simple linear relation
for the force-velocity relation for an individual motor, we
may then write ∂t y = ∂t U + vo (1 − km y/Fs ) where the
first term is the velocity of the filament and the second
term is the velocity of the head relative to the track. Here
the stall force Fs and the load-free velocity vo are motor
dependent parameters.
With this given motor-filament interaction, the average number of attached motors relates attached and detached probability densities to their corresponding fluxes
via microscopic transition rates. In the mean-field limit,
the density of motors ρm is large enough that fluctuations in the time average of the density of attached motors ρa = ρm N (t), where N (t) is the fraction of attached
motors are small compared to the mean value. Ensemble
averaging the terms in the population balance equation

over y (see SI-§I) yields

F(E, Y ) is modified by motor extension, since the
characteristic energy scale for detachment is E ≡

/kB T and depends on a typical length scale δm
charactering the extension at which motors detach. Consistent with previous studies [12, 13], we use two forms:
F(E, Y ) = exp(E|Y |) and F(E, Y ) = cosh(EY ). The
evolution of the mean motor extension Y ≡ hyi/δm is
obtained by write down the microscopic description for
∂t y for a single motor and then average over y. Relating

The first term on the right is the passive convection of
the motor head as the filament stretches [12] and second term arises as the motor head walks relative to the
moving filament. The last term on the right corresponds
to the rate at which the mean strain changes due to the
kinetics of motor attachment and arises from the difference in extension of attaching and detaching motors. The

parameters A1 ≡ vo km /(ωoff
Fs ), A2 ≡ Fs /(km δm ) and
A3 ≡ dm /δm relate the microscopic motor parameters to
the population level dynamics. Finally, given the fraction of attached motors N and their mean extension Y ,
the effective active force per motor in (1) is given by

Fm = km δm N Y.

Equations (1)-(4) specify the evolution of the filament
displacement U (s, t), the motor density N (s, t) and the
motor stretch Y (s, t) in terms of the dimensionless pao
o
. While Ψ is rerameters A1 , A2 , A3 and Ψ ≡ ωoff
/ωon
lated to the duty ratio of the motors, A1 and A3 determine the mechanism that yields the average extension of
attached motors. Specifically, when A3  1, the role of
the pre-strain dm is negligible [13] while when A1  1,
pre-strain dominates [12]. Our model complements and
differs from previous attempts in a few important ways.
o
Firstly, the detachment rate ωoff
depends on the motor extension [12, 13] and not the rate of extension [18],
consistent with experiments that show that bond failure
is more naturally dependent on the extension and only
weakly on the rate of extension [19]. Secondly, the nonlinear coupling between passive and active deformations
in (3) distinguishes our model from previous studies of
motor mediated bending of filaments [18]. Finally, we assume that the filament is (weakly) extensible, bolstered
by experimental evidence in passive systems [9, 11], and
unlike all previous studies of active ordered filaments.
To understand the solutions of (1)-(4) and their stability, we expand the motor displacement Y , the filament extension U , and motor number density N in pow-

Equations (8)-(10) may be interpreted in two ways. In
the absence of imposed oscillations, they determine the
linear stability of the equations (5)-(7) to small perturbations. Alternately (8)-(10) can be interpreted as the
linearised response to a small amplitude, externally imposed oscillation in which case in the limit t → ∞ limit
(provided Real [σ] < 0), (Û , N̂ , Ŷ ) is slaved to the forcing
frequency.
Before we approach the question of persistence of activity in an active filament, we ask if spontaneous strain
fields can be generated by a small, localized patch of mo1
tors of length `s  (Kpas /Gpas ) 2 . The dynamics of this
patch may be mapped to that of a rigid segment working
against an effective spring with passive as well as active
components - here, we lump these contributions together
using an effective spring constant Ks ∼ Gpas (SI-§IIa).
The displacement of this fragment follows
− Ks U + Gact δm N Y = 0.

(11)

When Ks > 0 (for the degenerate case Ks = 0, see SI§IIb) and global filament translation is prevented, equations (2), (3) and (11) admit two classes of solutions - a
constant extension of the rigid filament with ∂t U = 0, or
a time-periodic, oscillatory extension. In the first case,
the steady density and motor strain are given by equations (6) and (7) with the steady extension Gact C/Ks
where C ≡ δm N0 Y0 . This static state is however linearly unstable to oscillatory states and the onset of these

oscillatory states can be readily obtained from (9), (10)
and the linearised version of (11). Analyzing the conditions under which Real [σ] = 0 yields the neutral stability curve that demarcates the static state from stable, oscillatory states, emanating via supercritical HopfPoincare bifurcations; the necessary criterion for this bedF
(Y0 ) ≡ F00 > 0. The mechanism behind the
ing dY
oscillations is the coupling in (11) between the filament motion and attached motors that yields an effective compliance comprised of both in-phase and an outof-phase term; the oscillatory solutions obtained are a
result of positive feedback, when either or both of these
terms turn negative, similar to that seen in flagellar [18]
and spindle oscillations [12]. In Fig.3 (a), we show neutral stability curves (SI-§IIC) separating oscillatory from
non-oscillatory steady regimes. For fixed motors density (fixed motor number) ρm , there is a range of Ψ over
which oscillations can be sustained. For fixed Ψ there exists a critical motor density, related to Ks /(ρm km ) (units
m−2 ), above which the oscillations appear. When stably
oscillating, the power due to activity balances dissipation
due to motor friction - this yields an effective viscosity
ηact ∼ ρm No km (∂hyi/∂Ut )Ut =0 where ρm N0 is the total number of attached motors. As Ψ increases, both
(∂hyi/∂Ut )Ut =0 and No typically decrease leading to an
increase in the emergent frequency ωc - c.f. Fig. 3(b) here, Ut ≡ ∂t U .
Having identified the two stable localized dynamical
states that can exist for a short fragment, we next combine this local analysis with a global description of the filament extension to obtain decay lengths for active assemblies. We first address decay lengths of steady extensions.
For boundary conditions, we assume that U (0, t) = 0
and U (`, t) = U0 (`) + UI Real[eiωt ], i.e. one end is fixed
while the other is forced harmonically with amplitude

4
UI . We focus on homeostatic responses and analyze the
frequency-locked response of the active asssembly to the
imposed frequency at the free end.
At O(0 ), we recover equation (5) which when solved
with boundary conditions U0 (0) = 0 and ∂s U0 (`) = 0, as
is appropriate for a free end, yields
U0 = (

Gact C 
) 1 − α es/`E − (1 − α) e−s/`E
Gpas

(12)

where α = e−2`/`E (1 + e−2`/`E )−1 . The decay length
for steady extensions depends only on the passive elastic
compliance because active motors sense only strain rates
and not the strain. An elastically compliant inter-motor
spacing or inter-motor interactions will alter the decay
length from that given by (12). In the degenerate limit
ρN = 0, U0 (s) = (Gact C/Kpas ) s(2` − s) - there is thus no
decay length scale for the steady extension in this case.
Attached motors in rigor do sense absolute displacements
and strain rates. The decay length is then modified to
1
(SI-§IIIA) (Kpas /[Gact N0 + Gpas ]) 2 where N0 is the preexisting attached fraction.
Next, we examine equations (8)-(10) to discern the decay of oscillatory strains. The end at s = ` is forced harmonically at frequency ω and so as t → ∞, the locked-in
response is obtained by setting σ = iω in equations (9)
and (10). Combining (8)-(10) then yields
Kpas ∂ss Û − Gpas Û − Gact χÛ = 0

(13)

where the complex function χ = −δm (N0 Ŷ + Y0 N̂ )/Û ≡
R+iI characterizes the linear viscoelastic response of the
motors (SI-§IIIB,C). Since the stationary solutions, Y0
and N0 do not involve the position dependent U0 , χ does
not depend on s. We seek solutions to (13) of the form
Û ∼ es/λ with λ being a complex wavenumber. Nontrivial solutions of (13) exist only when (Gpas + Gact R −
Kpas /λ2 )2 + G2act I 2 = 0 which on simplifying yields the
1
two roots λ−1
[(Gpas /Kpas ) + (Gact /Kpas ) (R ± iI)] 2 .

Defining `E ≡ Kpas /Gpas and an activity parameter
β ≡ Gact /Gpas , we find an effective persistence length

. (14)

Here β controls the importance of active to passive shear
stiffening. When β = 0, we recover the result for a passive assembly, λE = `E . In the absence of passive linkers,
the persistence length is controlled solely by Gact /Kpas .
The frequency dependence of λE , arises via the real and
imaginary parts of χ, these being associated with motor
properties such as stall force Fs , free velocity v0 and the
duty ratio via Ψ. When activity is weak, β  1, an
expansion of equation (14) in powers of β yields λE ≈
`E 1 − 12 βR − 81 β 2 (I 2 − 3R2 ) + O(β 3 ). For R > 0, at
O(β) the motor activity decreases λE with shear stiffening driving the stretching of the filament. The O(β 2 )

term can either enhance this effect or lessen it depending
2
on the sign of the term (I 2 −
p3R ). For strong activity,
1
when β  1, we get λE ≈ 2(Kpas /Gact )(R + |χ|)− 2
with actively driven shear stiffening dominating.
The role of motor dynamics can be probed by examining the low and high frequency limits of (14). In the low
frequency limit, motors undergo multiple mechanochemical cycles before they feel the imposed oscillation. In the
high frequency limit, attached motors encounter several
cycles of imposed oscillations before detaching. Activity
will then increase the persistence length from the lower
bound of a tightly coupled system. These trends are
transparent when we examine the limit A1 = 0. In
the low frequency limit, I ∼ (ω/ωoff )(1 − γ + γτ )
and R ∼ (ω/ωoff )2 (1 − γ + γτ 2 ) with γ = A3 ΨF00
and τ = ωoff /(ωoff + ωon ) both dependent on Y0
but not on s. Substituting these in (14) yields λE ≈
2
`E 1 − 81 (ω 2 /ωoff
){β 2 (1 − γ + γτ )2 + 4β(1 − γ + γτ 2 )} ,
which clearly indicates that activity, through β,
decreases the persistence length.
In the limit of
high ω, we find R ∼ 1 − (ωoff /ω)2 (1 − γ + γ/τ 2 ),
and I
∼ √(ωoff /ω)(1 − γ + γ/τ ) providing
λE ≈ (`E / 1 + β)(1 + 18 (ωoff /ω)2 {4β(1 − γ +

λE → `E / 1 + β = Kpas /(Gpas + Gact ).
For fixed motor properties, the decay length sets a finite range of correlated activity that might be relevant
for naturally ordered active matter such as eukaryotic
flagella [20]. Modeling the flagellum as a composite filament driven by uniformly spaced dynein motors, we take
w, D and E as the radius, spacing and Young’s modulus
of microtubules and kN and ρN as the nexin stiffness (per
length) and nexin density. From the existing literature,
we find w ∼ 20 nm, D ∼ 40 nm [21], E ∼ 1.2 GPa [9, 21],
kN ∼ 16 − 100 pN µm−1 , km = 10−3 N/m [22], ρm ∼ 108
m−1 and wρN ∼ 105 − 107 m−1 [17, 22]. We find that the
frequency dependent decay length `E ∈ [10 − 500] µm,
where the lower limit corresponds to all dyneins and nexins attached, and the upper bound corresponds to only
nexins being attached - in the range of physically relevant length scales. For segments of the flagella separated
by distances less than the decay length, one could have
frequency entrainment with multiple oscillatory regions
eventually synchronising.
Our theory accounts for extensional deformations in a
model ordered active composite consisting of elastic elements that can be stretched and sheared by dynamically
attaching motors. Extensibility, even if negligible locally,
affects the scale over which deformations persist owing
to the competition between extensibility and shear. For
strain dependent motor kinetics, the decay of steady extensions is controlled by shear stiffening due to passive
linkers. Localized oscillatory strains lead to global deformations that decay over longer length scales that involve passive and frequency dependent active properties
of the assembly. Given that it is now possible to create partially ordered mixtures of motors and cytoskeletal

5
filaments [23, 24] that show spontaneous activity, our cal-

culations can be tested experimentally.

SI: Persistence of strain in motor-filament assemblies

I.

COARSE-GRAINING YIELDS MEAN FIELD MODEL

Of the total motors per area at position s along the filament let a fraction N (t) be attached so that the density
of detached motors is ρd (s, t) = ρm (1 − N (s, t)). Each motor experiences an internal spring extension y which may
be considered the distance between the head and the base or as an intrinsic co-ordinate of the underlying mechanochemical cycle. We choose y = 0 as our base state corresponding to an unstrained motor.
In the mean-field limit, the number of motors (and the density) is large (high) enough that fluctuations in the time
average of the density of attached motors ρa (s, t) = ρm N (s, t) are small compared to the mean value. The motor
kinetics may be described by a set of population balances relating the attached and detached probability densities
Pa (s, y, t) and Pd (s, y, t) to attachment and detachment fluxes Ja and Jd via the transition rates νon (y) and νoff (y),
∂t Pa + ∂y Ja = νon Pd − νoff Pa ,
∂t Pd + ∂y Jd = νoff Pa − νon Pd

(15)
(16)

consistent with previous studies (see [6, 12] and references therein). For simplicity, the attachment frequency νon
is chosen to be constant while the detachment rate is allowed to vary with the motor extension. Thus we write
νoff = νoff (y, δm ), δm being a measure of the motor extension at which the detachment rate becomes significant.
Focusing on the noise-less limit, we make the assumption that thermal noise as described by Brownian effects of the
diffusion of both the motor base (this is assumed to be attached permanently) and the motor head, is negligible.
where, in the absence of motor diffusion, Ja = (dt y)Pa .
Consider now the flux of attached and detached motors. One scenario is that the detached motors could rapidly
relax to their equilibrium internal state with a viscous relaxation time. Alternately the detached motors could relax
to a delta function Pd = ρd (t)δ(y) with the change occurring instantaneously. When the distribution in extension of
attached motors is sharply peaked about the typical (average) length, transients to this distribution occur over times
very small compared to the averaged macroscopic time scale, t we can write RPa = ρa (t)δ(y − hyi). Averaged equations
(moments) may be obtained from (SI-1) and (SI-2) by using the definition XPa dy ≡ hXi N ρm .
Integrating either (SI-1) or (SI-2) over all configurations y yields
o
o
∂t ρa = ωon
ρm − ρa (ωon
+ hνoff i).

(17)

In deriving these equations, we have used the fact that averaging the transition rates yield the mean-field (effective)
o
attachment rate ωon
(chosen to be a constant), and detachment rate, hνoff i = ωoff that is modified by the mean motor
extension.

6
The extension of attached motors y for a location s is peaked about the mean value hyi(s, t) with small deviations
from this mean. Ignoring these deviations as done in previous studies [6, 12], we choose νoff (y) to depend only on the
scaled mean motor extension Y ≡ hyi/δm so that ωoff is just dependent on (Y, δm , km ). Thus we may write,
hνoff yi ≈ hνoff ihyi ≈ ωoff Y δm

(18)

o
2
and thus ωoff ≡ ωoff
F (Y, E) where E ≡ km δm
/kB T is a measure of the energy needed to stretch the motors to their
maximal extent. For subsequent analysis, we define

F0 ≡ F (Y0 ),

F00 ≡

dF
(Y = Y0 ).
dY

(19)

Note that since ρa (s, t) = ρm N (s, t), equation (SI-3) can be recast as
o
o
∂t N = ωon
− N (ωon
+ ωoff ).

(20)

The final equation is for the evolution for the mean strain, hyi ≡ Y δm . This ensemble averaged quantity changes
due to three effects - the pre-strain (pre-extension) value of attaching motors, the fact that motors detach at finite
strain and the evolution of the strain whilst the motor is attached. The evolution of extension in attached motors is
related to the correspondence between the change of the mean stretch, ∂t hyi, to the mean rate of stretch, h∂t yi and
necessitates consideration of the local interaction between the motor heads and the filament tracks on which they
move exemplified by an active velocity-force relationship and a passive force that is a measure of the elasticity of a
fixed cross-bridge under conditions of rigor.
We consider a simple physical picture for how motors interact with the filament. We assume motors attach in a
pre-strained state with initial extension at attachment dm and then once attached walk relative to the filament with
velocity vm as they interact with the tilted potential that characterises the filament-head interaction. At the same
time since the base is fixed, the increasing spring extension y causes a force that ultimately at some point detaches
the motor.
As the motor head moves relative to the potential field generated by the filament, it obeys a velocity-force relationship prescribed by microscopic details of the motor head-track interaction. One may then think of the velocity
relative to the track as being caused by the hopping of the head from one potential local energy well (binding site)
to another without detaching from the track. The simplest specification for the velocity of the motor head relative to
the track after it is attached is given by a linear force-velocity relationship


km δm y
vm = ∂t y = ∂t U + vo 1 −
(21)

where the first term ∂t U is the velocity of the filament (that convects the attached motor). The second term is the
velocity of the head relative to the track and in this term Fs is the stall force at which motion stops, vo is the velocity
at zero force and km δm Y is the spring force. Taking the ensemble average of (SI-7) yields

h∂t yi = ∂t U + vo

Finally, we put together these aspects of the motor extension. Multiplying (SI-2) by y and then integrating over y,
we can write

Note that when dm = 0, we recover the model proposed by Grill et. al. [12] wherein motors attach at zero extension
and then walk along the filament with a strain-dependent speed. When vo = 0, we recover a different model [6] wherein
motors follow a two-state cross-bridge scheme and attach in a forward leaning position with an motor extension dm .
Equation (SI-10) is an approximation which allows one to interpolate between these two limiting cases.

DYNAMICS OF A SMALL FRAGMENT

A.

Mapping to an effective resisting spring
1

The dynamics of a fragment of the filament of length `s  (Kpas /Gpas ) 2 (the strip has lateral extent b) animated by
the activity of motors may be mapped on to that of a rigid segment working against an effective spring that has both
passive and active components - here we combine these contributions together in terms of an effective spring constant
Ks . The passive elasticity of this spring comes from both Gpas and Kpas while the active contribution comes from
attached motors in neighbouring segments. If ρN = 0 then the passive part of Ks ∝ Kpas /(`s b), while a contribution
solely due to passive linkers would suggest Ks ∝ Gpas . Since, active contributions merely rescale Ks , we treat this as
a external parameter.

B.

Degenerate case of free fragment

When there is no restraining spring, Ks = 0, and equation (11) of the main text is irrelevant. We are left
with equations (2) and (3) of the main text that describe an untethered, stiff filament forced by motors to move at
o
velocity ∂t U = V . Treating (V /δm ωon
) ≡ Z as a continuation parameter and restricting ourselves to constant Z,
we numerically obtain solutions defined by the set N (Z) and Y (Z). Fig. 1 illustrates the dynamical characteristics
of these solution branches when A1 = 0 and F = exp (E|Y |). The fraction of attached motors, N and Y selects
the constant speed Z. The stability of the translating solution is controlled by the form of the detachment rate and
characteristic energies for motors to detach E. The range over which a stable, steadily translating velocity (solid curve)
can exist is controlled by E. These results are relevant to microtubule-motor assays in which small rigid segments are
moved about by the motor activity.

(37)

Invoking various quasi-static assumptions - thus yielding approximations where the motor displacement is slaved to
the density field - does not yield qualitative differences.
The physical mechanism for oscillations is an effective negative spring constant and negative friction co-efficient
due to the interplay between the motor dynamics and the spring resistance of the rod leading to a positive feedback
in the dynamics of the system. To formally see this we set u = ∆1 Û exp (iωt) + c.c, Y = Yo + ∆1 Ŷ exp (iωt) + c.c and
N = No +∆1 N̂ exp (iωt) and find the find the frequency dependent response of the active force term Fa = ρm km δm Y N
which in frequency space writes as ρm km δm χ(ω). The frequency dependence of χ indicates that under certain
conditions the elastic in-phase - R(χ) - and/or viscous out of phase - I(χ) - parts turn negative suggesting a positive
feedback thus yielding eventually stable oscillations. For large values of Ψ, the number of attached motors is insufficient
to supply the energy for oscillations thus yielding an upper bound. for small Ψ too many attached motors increase the
net elastic resistance and friction coefficients, causing a strong damping of oscillations. these trends are qualitatively
consistent with related observations on mitotic spindle oscillations even though the governing equation differs due
the exact averaging procedure [12]. In the stable oscillating state, the active energy input by motor attachment
must balance the dissipation due to motor friction. Unfortunately, the equation for the emergent frequency is too
algebraically complicated to be interpreted directly. It is however possible to estimate the effective active viscosity
and anticipate how this affects emergent frequency. When motors adiabatically couple to the dynamics of the rod, as
in [12] for instance, so that Ẏ ≈ ΨY F and mean motor extension is slaved to the velocity of the rod and the mean
time for which the motor stays attached, we find
ωc2 ∼

ρm km No (dhyi/dŻ)Ż=0

(38)

yielding an estimate of the effective motor friction
ηactive ∼ ρm km No (dhyi/dŻ)Ż=0

(39)

As Ψ increases with everything else held constant, (dhyi/dŻ)Ż=0 typically decreases, as does No , resulting in an
effective increase in ωc .

Seeking possible periodic solutions, we again find that the resulting equations admit either decaying solutions or
oscillatory solutions. The neutral stability curve is given by
0 = (1 + 2ΨFo ) − BYo ΨNo Fo0 + BNo (1 + ΨFo ).
and the frequency at onset is

ωc =

ΨFo (1 + ΨFo )
(1 + BNo )

 12
.

(45)

Again, further simplifications can be made in the various adiabatic limits discussed earlier with motor dynamics
slaved to the dynamics of the rod. One such physically relevant limit is ΨFo  1 which is obtained when the
detachment rate at the equilibrium point is much larger than the strain-independent attachment rate. An alternate
approximation which may be treated as a variation of the mean field theory is Ẏ ≈ ΨY F. As Ψ increases with
everything else held constant, No decreases, resulting in an effective increase in ωc .

When the motor aggregates are in rigor, there is no intrinsic motor dynamics as they are stuck in fixed configurations
(either attached or detached) and therefore ωon = 0, ωoff = 0 and vo = 0. In this limit, the motors are bound
permanently to the filament track and can actually sense the instantaneous displacement of the attachment point
(where the head is) rather than just the rate of displacement. The number of attached motors N cannot change and
equals N0 , the preexisting attached fraction. As a result, the Y responds passively to the change in the attachment
point. and satisfies δm Yt = −Ut . Integrating this once yields δm (Y (t) − Y0 ) = −(U (t) − U0 ). Writing U (t) − U0 = δU
we get Ew(δU )ss − ρN kN (δU ) − km ρm N0 (δU ) = 0. Thus the decay length of the strain is given by
