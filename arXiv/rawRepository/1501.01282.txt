We model the evolution of eukaryotic protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In our model,
PPI networks evolve by two known biological mechanisms: (1) Gene duplication, which is followed
by rapid diversification of duplicate interactions. (2) Neofunctionalization, in which a mutation leads
to a new interaction with some other protein. Since many interactions are due to simple surface
compatibility, we hypothesize there is an increased likelihood of interacting with other proteins in
the target protein’s neighborhood. We find good agreement of the model on 10 different network
properties compared to high-confidence experimental PPI networks in yeast, fruit flies, and humans.
Key findings are: (1) PPI networks evolve modular structures, with no need to invoke particular
selection pressures. (2) Proteins in cells have on average about 6 degrees of separation, similar to
some social networks, such as human-communication and actor networks. (3) Unlike social networks,
which have a shrinking diameter (degree of maximum separation) over time, PPI networks are
predicted to grow in diameter. (4) The model indicates that evolutionarily old proteins should have
higher connectivities and be more centrally embedded in their networks. This suggests a way in
which present-day proteomics data could provide insights into biological evolution.

We are interested in the evolution of protein-protein
interaction (PPI) networks. PPI network evolution accompanies cellular evolution, and may be important for
processes such as the emergence of antibiotic resistance in
bacteria [1, 2], the growth of cancer cells [3], and biological speciation [4–6]. In recent years, increasingly large
volumes of experimental PPI data have become available [7–10], and a variety of computational techniques
have been created to process and analyze these data [11–
18]. Although these techniques are diverse, and the experimental data are noisy [19], a general picture emerging from these studies is that the evolutionary pressures
shaping protein networks are deeply interlinked with the
networks’ topology [20]. Our aim here is to construct
a minimal model of PPI network evolution which accurately captures a broad panel of topological properties.
In this work, we describe an evolutionary model for eukaryotic PPI networks. In our model, protein networks
evolve by two known biological mechanisms: (1) a gene
can duplicate, putting one copy under new selective pressures that allow it to establish new relationships to other
proteins in the cell, and (2) a protein undergoes a mutation that causes it to develop new binding or new functional relationships with existing proteins. In addition,
we allow for the possibility that once a mutated protein
develops a new relationship with another protein (called
the target), the mutant protein can also more readily establish relationships with other proteins in the target’s
neighborhood. One goal is to see if random changes based
on these mechanisms could generate networks with the
properties of present-day PPI networks. Another goal is
then to draw inferences about the evolutionary histories
of PPI networks.

THE MODEL

We represent a PPI network as a graph. Each node on
the graph represents one protein. A link (edge) between
two nodes represents a physical interaction between the
two corresponding proteins. The links are undirected and
unweighted. To model the evolution of the PPI graph, we
simulate a series of steps in time. At time t, one protein
in the network is subjected to either a gene duplication
or a neofunctionalizing mutation, leading to an altered
network by time t + ∆t. We refer to this model as the
DUNE (DUplication & NEofunctionalization) model.

Gene duplication

One mechanism by which PPI networks change is gene
duplication (DU) [21–23]. In DU, an existing gene is
copied, creating a new, identical gene. In our model,
duplications occur at a rate d, which is assumed to be
constant for each organism. All genes are accessible to
duplication, with equal likelihood. For simplicity, we assume that one gene codes for one protein. One of the
copies continues to perform the same biological function
and remains under the same selective pressures as before. The other copy is superfluous, since it is no longer
essential for the functioning of the cell [24].
The superfluous copy of a protein/gene is under less
selective pressure; it is free to lose its previous function
and to develop some other function within the cell. Due
to this reduced selective pressure, further mutations to
the superfluous protein are more readily accepted, including those that would otherwise have been harmful
to the organism [25, 26]. Hence, a superfluous protein
diverges rapidly after its DU event [27, 28]. This wellknown process is referred to as the post-duplication di-

FIG. 1. DUNE model flowchart. At each time step, the
simulated network undergoes a duplication or neofunctionalization event. Red nodes/links indicate nodes/links that
have been created by duplication during the current time
step. Green links indicate links that have been created by
neofunctionalization during the current time step. A dashed
line indicates a duplicated link that has been deleted during
the post-duplication divergence. Only 3 neighbors are shown
for the assimilation mechanism; however, the actual simulations included up to 20th neighbors. The simulated network
evolves until its number of links (K) meets or exceeds the
number of links in the data (Kdata ).

vergence. Following [29], we assume that the link of each
such superfluous protein/gene to its former neighbors is
deleted with probability φ. The post-duplication divergence tends to be fast; for simplicity, we assume the divergence occurs within the same time step as the DU.
The divergence is asymmetric [30, 31]: one of the proteins diversifies rapidly, while the other protein retains
its prior activity. We delete links from the original or
the duplicate with equal probability because the proteins
are identical. As discussed in the supporting information
(SI), this is closely related to the idea of subfunctionalization, where divergence freely occurs until redundancy is
eliminated. In our model, φ is an adjustable parameter.
In many cases, the post-duplication divergence results
in a protein which has lost all its links. These ‘orphan’
proteins correspond to silenced or deleted genes in our
model. As discussed below, our model predicts that the
gene loss rate should be slightly higher than the duplication rate in yeast, and slightly lower in flies and humans.
We simulate a gene duplication event at time t as follows:

1a) Duplicate a randomly-chosen gene with probability
d∆t.
2a) Choose either the original (50%) or duplicate
(50%), and delete each of its links with probability φ.
3a) Move on to the next time interval, time t + ∆t.

Neofunctionalization

Our model also takes into account that DNA can be
changed by random mutations. Most such mutations do
not lead to changes in the PPI network structure. However, some protein mutations lead to new interactions
with some other protein (which we call the target protein). The formation of a novel interaction is called a
neofunctionalization (NE) event. NE refers to the creation of new interactions, not to the disappearance of
old ones. Functional deletions tend to be deleterious to
organisms [32]. We do not account for loss-of-function
mutations (link deletions) except during post-duplication
divergence because damaged alleles will, in general, be
eliminated by purifying selection. In our model, NE mutations occur at a rate µ, which is assumed to be constant. All proteins are equally likely to be mutated.
How does the mutated protein choose a target protein
to which it links? We define a probability q that any protein in the network is selected for receiving the new link
from the mutant protein. To account for the possibility
of homodimerization, the mutated protein may also link
to itself [24, 33]. Random choice dictates that q = 1/N
(see SI).
Many PPI’s are driven by a simple geometric compatibility between the surfaces of the proteins [34]. The
simplest example is the case of PPI’s between flat, hydrophobic surfaces [35], a type of interaction which is
very common [36]. These PPI’s have a simple planar interface, and the binding sites on the individual proteins
are geometrically quite similar to one another. One consequence of these similar-surface interactions is that if
protein A can bind to proteins B and C, then there is a
greater-than-random chance that B and C will interact
with each other. We refer to this property as transitivity: if A binds B, and A binds C, then B binds C. The
number of triangles in the PPI network should correlate
roughly with transitivity. As discussed below, the number of triangles (as quantified by the global clustering
coefficient) is about 45 times higher in real PPI networks
than in an equally-dense random graph. This suggests
that transitivity is quite common in PPI networks. Another source of transitivity is gene duplication. If A binds
B, then A is copied to create a duplicate protein A’, then
A’ will (initially) also bind B. If A interacts with A’, then
a triangle exists. However, duplication is unlikely to be
the primary source of transitivity; recent evidence shows
that, due to the post-duplication divergence, duplicates
tend to participate in fewer triangles than other proteins
[37].
A concrete example of transitivity is provided by the

3
evolution of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), an example
of neofunctionalization which has been characterized in
detail [38]. Three paralogs of RAR exist in vertebrates
(RARα, β, and γ), as a result of an ancient duplication. The interaction profiles of these proteins are quite
different. Previous work indicates that RARβ retained
the role of the ancestral RAR [38], while RARα and γ
evolved new functionality. RARα has several interactions not found in RARβ. RARα has novel interactions
with a histone deacetylase (HDAC3) as well as seven of
HDAC3’s nearest-neighbors (HDAC4, MBD1, Q15959,
NRIP1, Q59FP9, NR2E3, GATA2). None of these interactions are found in RARβ. The probability that all
of these novel interactions were created independently is
very low. RARα has 65 known PPI’s and HDAC3 has 83,
and the present-day size of the human PPI network is a
little over 3000 proteins. Therefore, the chance of RARα
randomly evolving novel interactions with 7 of HDAC3’s
neighbors is less than 1 in a billion. This strongly suggests that when a protein evolves an interaction to a target, it has a greater-than-random chance of also linking
to other, neighboring proteins.
How do similar-surface interactions affect the evolution of PPI networks? First, consider how an interaction
triangle would form. Suppose proteins A and B bind due
to physically similar binding sites. Protein X mutates
and evolves the capacity to bind A. There is a reasonable chance that X has a surface which is similar to both
A and B. If so, protein X is likely to also bind to B, forming a triangle. Denote the probability that two proteins
interact due to a simple binding site similarity by a. The
probability that A binds B (and X binds A) in this manner is a. Assuming these probabilities are identical and
independent, the probability that X binds B is a2 .
So far, we have discussed transitivity as it affects the
PPI’s in which protein A is directly involved (A’s firstneighbors). We now introduce a third protein to the
above example, resulting in a chain of interactions: protein A binds B, B binds C, but C does not bind A. Protein
X mutates and gains an interaction with A (with probability a2 ). What is the probability that X will also bind
C? The probability that B binds C due to surface similarity is a. Thus, X will bind C (A’s second-neighbor) with
probability a3 . In general, the probability that X will
bind one of A’s j th neighbors is aj+1 . We refer to this process as assimilation, and the ‘assimilation parameter’ a is
a constant which varies between species. As discussed in
SI, it is primarily mutliple-partner proteins which bind to
their partners at different times and/or locations which
are affected by this process; consequently, at most one
link is created by assimilation at the first-neighbor level,
second-neighbor level, etc. Assimilation is assumed to
act on a much shorter time scale than duplication and
neofunctionalization; in our model, it is instantaneous.
Our hypothesized assimilation mechanism makes several predictions that could be tested experimentally: (1)
the probability of a protein assimilating into a new pathway should be a2 (at the first-neighbor level), a3 (at the

second-neighbor level), and so on, where a is a constant
which varies between species; (2) weak, nonspecific binding and planar interfaces should be overrepresented in
interaction triangles (and longer cycles) between nonduplicate proteins; (3) competitive inhibitors should be
overrepresented in interaction triangles; and (4) domain
shuffling should be associated with assimilation. (See SI
for discussion of (3) and (4).)
We simulate a neofunctionalization event at time t as
follows:
1b) Mutate a randomly-chosen gene with probability
µ∆t.
2b) Link to a randomly-chosen target protein.
3b) Add a second link to one of the target’s firstneighbor proteins, chosen randomly, with probability a2 .
4b) Add a link to one of the target’s second-neighbor
proteins, with probability a3 , etc.
5b) Move on to the next time interval, time t + ∆t.

Model simulation and parameters

A flowchart of how PPI networks evolve in our model
is shown in Figure 1. To simulate the network’s evolution, one of the two mechanisms above is used at each
time step, using [39]. We call each possible time series
a trajectory. We begin each trajectory starting from two
proteins sharing a link (the simplest configuration that
is still technically a network). Each simulated trajectory ends when the model network has grown to have
the same total number of links, K, as found in the experimental data, Kdata . Here, we perform sets of simulations for three different organisms: yeast (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster ), and humans (Homo sapiens). Because evolution is stochastic,
there are different possible trajectories, even for identical starting conditions and parameters. We simulated 50
trajectories for each organism. Our figures show the me-

(Kdata is used to stop the simulation. Ndata is not used as a

(Myr). φ and a are probabilities (unitless). Kdata and d are
constraints from the data, while µ, φ, and a are adjustable
parameters. We used Monte Carlo simulations to optimize
the parameter values, by minimizing the total symmetric
mean absolute percentage error values of the simulated
versus the experimental data (see SI). Our values of µ are
substantially lower than d because µ is the rate of mutations
leading to the creation of a new PPI (rather than being a
simple mutation rate, which would be much higher).

For a given data set, the number of links (Kdata ) is
known. We estimate the duplication rate d from literature values. There have been several empirical estimates
of duplication rates, mostly falling within an order of
magnitude of each other [27, 40–45]. We averaged together the literature values to estimate d for each species
(Table I).
The quantity µ is not as well known. Its value relative
to d has been the topic of considerable debate [24, 46–
48]. Although, in principle, µ is a measurable quantity,
it has proven difficult to obtain an accurate value, in
part because the fixation rate of neofunctionalized alleles
varies with population size [49, 50]. In the absence of
a consensus order-of-magnitude estimate, in our model,
we treat µ as a fitting parameter. Consistent with the
findings of [51] and [46], our best-fit values of µ are within
an order of magnitude of each other for yeast, fruit fly,
and human networks. Best-fit parameter values are given
in Table I.

RESULTS
Present-day network topology

One test of an evolutionary model is its predictions
for present-day PPI network topologies. Current largescale PPI data sets have a high level of noise, resulting
in significant problems with false positives and negatives

[19, 54]. To mitigate this, we compare only to ‘highconfidence’ experimental PPI network data gathered in
small-scale experiments (see Methods). We computed 10
topological features, quantifying various static and dynamic aspects of the networks’ global and local structures: degree, closeness, eigenvalues, betweenness, modularity, diameter, error tolerance, largest component size,
clustering coefficients, and assortativity. 8 of these properties are described below (see SI for others).
The degree k of a node is the number of links connected to it. For protein networks, a protein’s degree is
the number of proteins with which it has direct interactions. Some proteins interact with few other proteins,
while other proteins (called ‘hubs’) interact with many
other proteins. Previous work indicates that hubs have
structural and functional characteristics that distinguish
them from non-hubs, such as increased proportion of disordered surface residues and repetitive domain structures
[56]. The high degree of a protein hub could indicate
that protein has unusual biological significance [57]. The
network’s overall link density is described by its mean
degree, hki (Table II). The degree distribution p(k) is the
probability that a protein will have k links. PPI networks have a few hub proteins and many relatively isolated proteins. The heavy tail of the degree distribution
shows that PPI networks have significantly more hubs
than random networks have. Simulated and experimental degree distributions are compared in Figure 2. (For
quantitative comparisons, see SI.)
Component refers to a set of reachable proteins. If any
protein is reachable from any other protein (by hopping
from neighbor to neighbor), then the network only has
one component. If there is no path leading from protein
A to B, then A and B are in different components. The

low average closeness h`i = 0.06 (top; each node is generally far away from most other nodes because there are no ‘short cuts’)
and high average closeness h`i = 0.28 (bottom; the random connections allow each node to be only a short distance from the
other nodes). Note that both networks pictured here have the same number of nodes (N = 100) and roughly the same average
degree (top: hki = 4, bottom: hki = 3.7).

fraction of nodes in the largest component (f1 ) is a measure of network fragmentation (Table II and Figure S2).
Note that, although silent genes (proteins with no links)
exist in real systems, these genes do not appear in data
sets consisting only of PPI’s. Therefore, calculations of
f1 for all models exclude orphan proteins (proteins with
k = 0).
Gene loss, the silencing or deletion of genes, is known
to play an important role in evolution. The loss of a func-

tioning gene will damage an organism, making the gene
loss unlikely to be passed on. The exception is if the
gene is redundant. Consistent with this reasoning, evidence suggests that many gene loss events are losses of
one copy of a duplicated gene [30, 58]. Although empirical estimates of the gene loss rate varied considerably, a
consistent finding across several studies is that the rates
of gene duplication and loss are of the same order-ofmagnitude [27, 41, 44]. This broad picture is in good
agreement with our model. In our model, a gene is con-

and 1; positive values of Q indicate that the number of
links within modules is greater than random. The numerical value of Q required for a network to be considered
‘modular’ depends on the number of nodes and links and
method of computation. To calibrate baseline Q values
given our particular network data, we used the null model
described in [64]. Our non-modular baseline values are
Q = 0.603 for the human PPI net, Q = 0.590 for yeast,
and Q = 0.722 for flies (see SI). As shown in Table II,
PPI networks are highly modular, and our simulated Q
values are in good agreement with those of experimental
data.
The clustering coefficient, Ci , for a protein i, is a measure of mutual connectivity of the neighbors of protein i.
Ci is defined as the ratio of the actual number of links
between neighbors of protein i to the maximum possible
number of links between them,
Ci =

sidered lost when it has degree zero. Our model predicts
that the ratio of orphan to non-orphan proteins is 1.6±0.4
in yeast, 0.58 ± 0.06 in flies, and 0.67 ± 0.09 in humans.
The gene loss rate has been previously estimated to be
about half the duplication rate in both flies and humans
[27, 44], consistent with our model’s prediction.
The distance between nodes i and j is defined as the
number of node-to-node steps that it takes along the
shortest path to get from node i to j. The closeness centrality of a node i, `i , is the inverse of the average distance
from node i to all other nodes in the same component.
The diameter, D, of a network is the longest distance in
the network. Simulated closeness distributions are compared to experiments in Figure 3. Interestingly, proteins
have about ‘six degrees of separation’, similar to social
networks [59, 60]. The closeness distributions p(`) have
peaks around 1/` ≈ 5 − 7.
Another property of a network is its modularity [61].
Networks are modular if they have high densities of links
(defining regions called modules), connected by lower
densities of links (between modules). One way to quantify the extent of modular organization in a network is
to compute the modularity index, Q [62, 63]:

# edges between neighbors of node i
.

In a PPI network, clustering is thought to reflect the high
likelihood that proteins of similar function are mutually
connected [65]. The average (or global) clustering coefficient, hCi, quantifies the extent of clustering in the
network as a whole. As shown in Table II, PPI networks
have large global clustering coefficient values; the yeast
PPI network, for example, has a value of hCi which is 45
times higher than that of a random graph of equivalent
link density. In flies and humans, our simulated networks
have hCi values in excellent agreement with the data; in
yeast, our predicted value is slightly low.
A network is said to be ‘hierarchically clustered’ if the

FIG. 8. Modularity and diameter. (A) Modularity Q and (B) diameter D are both predicted to grow with time in human
(green), yeast (blue), and fly (red). Light lines indicate the evolutionary trajectories of 50 individual simulations, and the heavy
line is the median value. The modularity and diameter of the empirical data are shown as dashed horizontal lines. Time traces
occasionally do not start at t = 0 because these simulations spend the first few time steps in a completely disconnected state,
so the dynamical quantities are undefined. (See Figure S2 for other dynamical plots.)

organized into small-scale modules, and the small-scale
modules are in turn organized into larger-scale modules
following the same pattern [67]. By plotting each node’s
clustering coefficient against its degree, we observed a
trend consistent with hierarchical clustering, although
data in the tail is very limited.
The betweenness of a node measures the extent to
which it ‘bridges’ between different modules. Betweenness centrality, b, is defined as:
bi ≡

# shortest paths passing through node i
.
# total shortest paths

(3)

Betweenness has been proposed as a uniquely
functionally-relevant metric for PPI networks because it relates local and global topology. It has been
argued that knocking out a protein that has high
betweenness may be more lethal to an organism than
knocking out a protein of high degree [68]. Betweenness
distributions are shown in Figure 5.
If a network’s well-connected nodes are mostly attached to poorly-connected nodes, the network is called
disassortative. A simple way to quantify disassortativity
is by determining the median degree of a protein’s neighbors (n) as a function of its degree (k). Previous work has
found that yeast networks are disassortative [64]. It has
been argued that disassortativity is an essential feature
of PPI network evolution, and recent modeling efforts
have heavily emphasized this feature [69, 70]. However,
it was noted by [71] that disassortativity may simply be
an artifact of the yeast two-hybrid technique, and [72]
pointed out that this trend is quite different among different yeast datasets, and in some cases is completely
reversed, resulting in assortative mixing, where high degree proteins prefer to link to other high-degree proteins.

As shown in Figure 7 and Table S1, the empirical data
shows no evidence of disassortativity in flies or humans,
and even the trend in yeast is quite weak. This conclusion is based solely on analysis of the empirical data, and
casts further doubt on the role of disassortative mixing
in PPI network evolution.
Some higher-order features of the network are simply
a result of its degree sequence, and other features might
be important in their own right. As discussed in [64], it
is possible to isolate the effects of the degree sequence by
‘rewiring’ (detaching then reattaching links) the network
at random, subject to the restriction that the degree sequence must be preserved. If a property contains extra
information about the network’s structure, then it should
be different in the rewired network. On the other hand,
if the network is rewired many times, and the property
is always the same, then it is likely to just be a result of
the degree sequence. We randomly rewired the empirical network 4Kdata times.1 As expected, modularity is
decreased by random rewiring. Upon rewiring, we find
Q = 0.603 ± 0.002 in humans, Q = 0.590 ± 0.003 in
yeast, and Q = 0.722 ± 0.007 in flies (median ± standard
deviation from 50 repeats of the rewiring algorithm).
Rewiring also shrinks the diameters of PPI networks to
D = 13 ± 0.9 in humans, D = 12 ± 1.0 in yeast, and
D = 15 ± 1.1 in flies. These results suggest that these
features contain important structural information about
the network, and are not merely consequences of the degree sequence.

Network rewiring was carried out using a script downloaded from
http://www.cmth.bnl.gov/∼maslov/matlab.htm.

8
One reason we are interested in calculating Q and D is
simply to check that the values are comparable between
the simulated and experimental networks. However, on
a more qualitative level, we would also like to have some
idea of what the threshold is for a network to be considered ‘modular’ or ‘small-diameter’. The rewired Q and
D values are useful because these features are dependent
on the size of the network (number of nodes N and links
K); given an identical network construction method, Q
and D will generally be different in sparse versus dense
networks. We use these Q and D values as baseline values with which the experimental and simulated networks
can be compared; we considered Q and D values differing
from the rewired values by more than a standard deviation to be significantly different.
Comparisons of simulated and experimental eigenvalue
spectra and error tolerance curves are shown in SI (Figures S1 and S4). As discussed in SI, the various per-node
network properties we have analyzed are largely uncorrelated (Figure S6).

We now consider the question of how PPI networks
evolve in time. The present-day networks show a richget-richer structure: PPI networks tend to have both
more well-connected nodes and more poorly connected
nodes than random networks have. In our model, the
rich-get-richer property has two bases: duplication and
assimilation. The equal duplication chance per protein
means the probability for a protein with k links to acquire a new link via duplication of one of its interaction
partners is proportional to k. Likewise, the probability of
a protein to receive a link from the first-neighbor assimilation probability a is proportional to its degree k. ‘Rich’
proteins get richer because the probability of acquiring
new links rises with the number of existing links.
First, we discuss two dynamical quantities for which
experimental evidence exists: the rate of gene loss, and
the relation between a protein’s age and its centrality.
Gene losses in our model correspond to ‘orphan’ proteins which have no interactions with other proteins. As
shown in Figure S2, the fraction of orphan proteins grows
quickly at first, then levels off. This is consistent with the
findings of [44]: in humans, while the overall duplication
rate is higher than the loss rate, when only data from
the past 200 Myr are considered, the loss rate is slightly
higher than the duplication rate. In our model, after the
initial rapid expansion, the rate of gene loss stabilizes
relative to the duplication rate.
We define the ‘age’ of a protein in our simulation according to the order in which proteins were added to the
network. Our model shows that a protein’s age correlates
with certain network properties. Consistent with earlier
work [73–76], we find that older proteins tend to be more
highly connected. We plotted the ‘age index’ of a protein

in centrality with age.

sus its centrality scores. As shown in Figure 10, the age
index negatively correlates with degree, betweenness, and
closeness centralities: older proteins tend to be more central than younger proteins. Figure 10 shows our model’s
prediction that a protein’s age correlates with degree,
betweenness, and closeness centrality. We confirmed this
prediction by following the evolutionary trajectories of
individual proteins (Figure S3). These results are consistent with the eigenvalue-based aging method described
in [76] (Figure S5). Phylogenetic protein age estimates
indicate that older proteins tend to have a higher degree [73, 76], which our model correctly predicts. Interestingly, the eigenvalue-based scores are only modestly
correlated with other centrality scores (0.36 degree, 0.47
betweenness, and 0.10 closeness correlations). Using the
eigenvalue method in tandem with our centrality-based
method could provide stronger age-discriminating power
for PPI networks than either method alone.
The correlation between centrality and age suggests
that static properties of present-day networks may be
used to estimate relative protein ages. Suppose each normalized centrality score (k 0 ≡ k/ max(k), `0 ≡ `/ max(`),
b0 ≡ b/ max(b)) represents a coordinate in a 3-D ‘centrality space’. We can then define a composite centrality
score (S) as S 2 ≡ (k 0 )2 + (`0 )2 + (b0 )2 .

Do older proteins typically have different functions
than newer proteins? We classified S. cerevisiae proteins using the GO-slim gene ontology system in the Saccharomyces Genome Database. As shown in Figure 9,
GO-slim enrichment profiles were somewhat different between the oldest and youngest proteins (as measured by
their S values). Several categories which were more enriched for the oldest proteins were the cell cycle, stress
response, cytoskeletal and cell membrane organization,
whereas younger proteins were overrepresented in several metabolic processes. Overall, the differences were
not dramatic, suggesting that cellular processes generally
require both central and non-central proteins to function.

Consistent with this, ancient proteins tend to be centrally
located with modules, as their betweenness values gradually decline over time (Figure S3). The roughly linear
relation between degree and betweenness also suggests
that ancient proteins do not occupy structurally ‘special’
positions within the network, such as stitching together
separate modules (Table S1 and Figure 6). This may indicate that modules tend to accumulate around the most
ancient proteins, which act as a sort of nucleus. Thus,
ancient proteins are involved in all kinds of pathways,
because they have each nucleated their own pathway.
In contrast to the two dynamical quantities discussed
so far, most structural properties of PPI networks have
only been measured for the present-day network. Although our model accurately reproduces the present-day
values of these quantities, there is no direct evidence that
the simulated trajectories are correct; rather, these are
predictions of our model. Figure 8 shows that both modularity Q and diameter D increase with time. These are
not predictions that can be tested yet for biological systems, since there is no time-resolved data yet available
for PPI evolution. Time-resolved data is only currently
available for various social networks (links to websites,
co-authorship networks, etc.). Interestingly, the diameters of social networks are found to shrink over time [77].
Our model predicts that PPI networks differ from these
social networks in that their diameters grow over time.
In addition to Q and D, we tracked the evolutionary trajectories of several other quantities: the evolution of the
global clustering coefficient, the rate of signal propagation, the size of the largest connected component (Figure S2), as well as betweenness and degree values for
individual nodes (Figure S3). See SI for details.
The number of ‘extra’ links created by each assimilation event should independent of N . Proteins with multiple interaction partners may interact with their partners simultaneously (so-called ‘party hubs’) or at different times/locations (‘date hubs’) [78]. Since they bind

to several partners simultaneously, party hubs typically
have multiple binding sites, each specific to one binding partner [79]. This specificity suggests that a protein which evolved the capability to bind to a party hub
would be unlikely to undergo assimilation. By contrast,
the binding sites of date hubs are often disordered regions which are able to form transient interactions with
multiple partners [80, 81]. If a protein evolves the capability to bind to a date hub, it is likely to share the
physical characteristics of the hub’s neighbors, leading to
assimilation. However, to avoid competition for the same
binding site, the interaction partners of date hubs tend
not to be coexpressed [79]. One consequence of this is
that assimilating proteins will likely only bind one of the
target protein’s neighbors – whichever neighbor happens
to be present at that time and place. Although the capability to bind to the hub protein’s other neighbors may
initially be present, these will presumably remain unused
in the cell. Our expectation is that the assimilating protein will therefore be unlikely to retain this capability,
as it evolves. Similarly, only a single extra link should
be generated at the second-neighbor level, third-neighbor
level, etc. Consistent with the evidence discussed above,
the number of links created by assimilation is approximately independent of the total network size. Party hubs
typically are centrally-located within modules, while date
hubs often function to stitch together large-scale modules
in the cell. It may be that duplication-only models are
unrealistically fragmented (Table II) because their modules are not properly attached with date hubs; instead,
the modules are disconnected components.

Sensitivity analysis

The DUNE model has four parameters. One parameter, the DU rate d, is estimated from empirical data. The
other three are adjustable parameters: the NE rate µ, the
divergence probability φ, and the assimilation probability
a. To gain a better understanding of how these parameters affect the final network structure, starting with each
organism’s set of parameters, we systematically adjusted
all 4 parameters. Results are shown in Figure 11.
As expected, the divergence parameter φ was positively
correlated with both the modularity Q and the diameter. When φ ≈ 0, the network quickly reaches a fullyconnected state, where all proteins are linked to all other
proteins. Consequently, the network is not organized into
modules, and all distances in the network are equal to 1.
The ‘thinning out’ of duplicate links is therefore essential
to generate non-trivial network features. The opposite
occurs when the NE rate µ is too low: f1 ≈ 0, and the
network evolves towards a completely disconnected state.
Why does gene duplication lead to modularity? Consider an initially uniform network. When a node is duplicated at random, this causes the original node, the copy,
and their immediate neighbors to share more links internally than they do with the rest of the network. Subsequent duplications amplify this effect: if a node that
has 10 links within a module but only 2 external links is
duplicated, there are now 20 internal and 4 external links
(prior to post-duplication divergence).
Interestingly, Q has a weak negative correlation with
the assimilation parameter a. When a is large, the probability to link to distant neighbors of the target protein is relatively high, and mutated proteins have a non-

11
negligible chance to generate links to proteins outside
of their target’s pathway. This causes modules to blur
at the edges; their member proteins will share a higher
number of links to other modules than for a low a network. Although the modularity is reduced for a high a
network, it does not disappear entirely. Similarly, there
is a sharp decrease in Q as the NE rate surpasses the DU
rate, indicating the important role of the DU mechanism
in modular organization.
Diameter is also negatively correlated with a. When a
single NE event has a significant chance to generate links
to the target protein’s neighbors, this tends to reduce the
overall separation of proteins in the network.

DISCUSSION

The relevance of selection to PPI network evolution
has been a topic of considerable debate [82], particularly
in the context of higher-order network features, such as
modularity. A number of authors have argued that specific selection programs are required to generate modular
networks, such as oscillation between different evolutionary goals [83–88]. However, previous work has shown
that gene duplication by itself, in the absence of both
natural selection and neofunctionalization, can generate
modular networks [89, 90]. Consistent with the findings
of [89, 90], modularity in our model is primarily generated by gene duplications (Figure 11; see SI for sensitivity analysis). Unfortunately, duplication-only models err in their predictions of other network properties
(Tables II and S2; Figure S7). A well-known problem
with duplication models is that they generate excessively
fragmented networks, with only about 20% of the proteins in the largest component. This is in sharp contrast
to real PPI networks, which have 73% to 89% of their
proteins in the largest component. Neofunctionalizationonly models have most of their proteins in the largest
component, but are significantly less modular than real
networks. As shown in Table II, by modeling duplication and neofunctionalization simultaneously, the DUNE
model generates networks which have the modularity
found in duplication-only models, while retaining most
proteins in the largest component. This lends support to
the idea that gene duplication contributes to the modularity found in real biological networks, and that protein modules can arise under neutral evolution, without requiring complicated assumptions about selective
pressures. This is consistent with recent experimental
work characterizing a real-world fitness landscape, showing that it is primarily shaped by neutral evolution [91].
One model for the fate of duplicate genes is subfunctionalization (SF). In SF, the original and the duplicate
genes are both free to lose their redundant functions, so
they can evolve freely until they exactly reproduce the
ancestral function [92]. The post-duplication divergence
in our model is similar in spirit to SF, but it differs in
two significant ways: (1) in our model, the link loss is

completely asymmetric, and (2) a fraction (1 − φ) of the
redundant links are retained, so, unlike SF, not all of
the redundancy is eliminated. For the first point, empirical evidence suggests that the divergence is asymmetric [31], although the assumption of complete asymmetry
would likely need to be revisited to build a finer-grained
model. Second, genetic regulatory networks have been
shown to be robust to random link deletions, indicating
that these networks retain some degree of redundancy
[93–95]. In silico evidence suggests that a more accurate picture may be of a transient period of functional
divergence, followed by prolonged neofunctionalization,
resulting in only a partial loss of redundancy [96]. This
is consistent with our model.
One example of a known biological mechanism which
should lead to assimilation is domain shuffling, the copyand-pasting of part of one protein into another [97, 98].
The neofunctionalization mechanism described here is
quite general, and includes domain shuffling, among
other methods of PPI creation. A PPI formed via domain
shuffling will often be the result of a binding site duplication. Assuming the binding is due to simple surface similarity, the initial link will be to the protein which had its
domain copied. The likelihood of binding to neighbors
of the original protein should depend only on the probability that each interaction is due to surface similarity
because the copied binding site will be identical to the
original.
The role of domain shuffling in assimilation raises the
question of whether domains should be modeled explicitly, rather than representing proteins as integral units.
Previous work indicates that overall PPI network topology is robust to the details of domain shuffling [99].
Moreover, while proteins which have experienced domain
shuffling have a higher average degree than other proteins, high- and low-degree proteins are equally likely to
acquire new interactions this way [100]. Because the creation of new links by domain shuffling should be topologically very similar to the creation of new links by other
neofunctionalization events, we believe our model is a
reasonable implementation of this mechanism, as it applies to the evolution of network topology.
Previous estimates of NE rates in eukaryotes have varied widely, generally falling in the range of 100 to 1000
changes/genome/Myr [24, 46, 52], or on the order of 0.1
change/gene/Myr. However, more recent empirical work
has identified several problems with the methods used to
obtain these estimates, suggesting that de novo link creation is much less common than previously thought [48].
This is consistent with our model. The best-fit values of
our NE rate µ are in the range of 10−5 to 10−4 /gene/Myr
(Table I), which in all three organisms are considerably
slower than the duplication rates d.
Biologically, many of the interactions created by our
neofunctionalization mechanism are expected to initially
be weak, non-functional interactions. The results of [101]
suggest that strong functional interactions are correlated
with hydrophobicity, which in turn is correlated with

12
promiscuity. We posit that initially weak, non-functional
interactions are an essential feature of PPI evolution, as
they provide the ‘raw material’ for the subsequent evolution of functional interactions. If this reasoning is correct,
one consequence should be that hub proteins are, on average, more important to the cell than non-hub proteins.
This has been found to be true: both degree [57] and betweenness centrality [68] have positive correlations with
essentiality, indicating that hub proteins are often critical
to the cell’s survival.
We have described here a model for how eukaryotic
protein networks evolve. The model, called DUNE, implements two biological mechanisms: (1) gene duplications, leading to a superfluous copy of a protein that
can change rapidly under new selective pressures, giving
new relationships with other proteins and (2) a protein
can undergo random mutations, leading to neofunctionalization, the de novo creation of new relationships with
other proteins. Neofunctionalization can lead to assimilation, the formation of extra novel interactions with
the other proteins in the target’s neighborhood. Biological evidence suggests that this type of mechanism
exists. Our specific implementation is based on a simple geometric surface-compatibility argument for the observed transitivity in PPI networks. This is, of course, a
heavily simplified model of PPI network evolution, and
there are many biological factors which have not been
included. However, our relatively simple model shows
good agreement with 10 topological properties in yeast,
fruit flies, and humans. One finding is that PPI networks
can evolve modular structures, just from these random
forces, in the absence of specific selection pressures. We
also find that the most central proteins also tend to be
the oldest. This suggests that looking at the structures of
present-day protein networks can give insight into their
evolutionary history.

Methods

Genome-wide PPI screens have a high level of noise
[19], and specific interactions correlate poorly between
data sets [54]. We found that several large-scale features
differed substantially between types of high-throughput
experiments (see SI). Due to concerns about the accuracy
and precision of data obtained through high-throughput
screens, we chose to work with ‘high-confidence’ data
sets consisting only of pairwise interactions confirmed in
small-scale experiments, which we downloaded from the
public HitPredict database [102]. We found sufficient
high-confidence data in yeast (S. cerevisiae), fruit flies
(D. melanogaster ), and humans (H. sapiens).
All simulations and network feature calculations were
carried out in Matlab. Our scripts are freely available
for download at http://interacto.me. We computed
betweenness centralities, clustering coefficients, shortest
paths, and component sizes using the MatlabBGL package. Modularity values were calculated with the algo-

rithm of [103]. All comparisons (except the degree distribution) are between the largest connected components
of the simulated and experimental data.
Due to the human network’s somewhat larger size,
most dynamical features were calculated once per 50 time
steps for the human network, but were updated at every
time step in the yeast and fly networks. For dynamical
plots, the y coordinates of the trend line are medians-ofmedians. The amount of time elapsed per time step (the
x coordinate) varies between simulations. We binned the
time coordinates to the nearest 10 million years for yeast
and fly, and 25 million years for human. When multiple
values from the same simulation fell within the same bin,
we used the median value. We then calculated the median value between simulations. Scatter plot trend lines
are calculated in a similar way. The trend line represents the median response variable (C, b, or `) value over
all nodes within a single simulation with degree k. The
y coordinate of the trend line is therefore the median
(across 50 simulations) of these median response variables. This median-of-medians includes all simulations
that have nodes of a given degree.

Empirical data

We downloaded large-scale data sets from BioGRID
[104], and used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare
aggregate statistical features across various experimental
types in yeast (S. cerevisiae) and humans (H. sapiens)
[78]. As expected, we found that data obtained by affinity capture was significantly different than pairwise experimental data (primarily yeast two-hybrid and in vitro
complexation), as the affinity capture interactions represent entire complexes, which is somewhat different information than the pairwise interactions we are attempting
to capture using our model. However, more surprisingly,
the only feature to show significant agreement between
pair-wise techniques was the eigenvalue distribution of
the walk matrix (P > 0.05). Further sub-dividing the
individual techniques into smaller data sets containing
only results obtained in single experiments, we discovered that, again, only the spectra agreed between different screens.
Note that, due to the small size of the fly network,
there may be too many missing links to obtain an accurate description the network’s large-scale topology. Although, by appropriate parameter tuning, our model is
able to accurately reproduce the fly network, it is possible that different parameters will be required to match
the fly network once it becomes more fully characterized experimentally. The data sets considered here do
not include interactions which are enabled through posttranslational modifications. Although these data sets
are far from complete, and may be susceptible to falsepositive detections, these appear to be the most accurate
data available at the present time.

ated by NE per protein is only about 8% higher in humans than in yeast [51]. These results support the conjecture that the probability for a protein to receive a new
link via point mutation is approximately independent of
N , as previously noted in [46]. Due to the finite copy
number of proteins, as well as the compartmentalization
of eukaryotic cells, we regard it as unlikely that proteins
will simultaneously acquire multiple links to targets in
different locations in the cell, or which are involved in
divergent biological processes.

Large-scale duplications

Our model does not explicitly consider simultaneous
duplication of multiple genes (chromosomal duplications,
whole genome duplications, etc.). However, as shown in
Table I, duplication rates in our model are considerably
higher than neofunctionalization rates, so that, on average, there are multiple duplications per neofunctionalization event. Sequential duplications of this type may be
thought of as an (imperfect) representation of multi-gene
duplications. The advantage of this approach is that we
do not require separate rates for each duplication scale
(one could imagine an extremely detailed model which included separate rates for gene duplication, gene-pair duplication, gene-triplet duplication, etc.). The downside
is that our implementation of larger-scale duplications
will generally include some genes which have been duplicated multiple times, and others which have not been
duplicated at all. A potential mitigating factor is that
the rate of gene loss (and evolution in general) following genome duplication is very high [30, 58], so even a
completely faithful large-scale duplication would likely
be altered within short order.

p(λ)

We describe here a test of our randomness conjecture,
q = 1/N . The implication is that the average number
of NE links per protein should be independent of N .
Another possibility is that q is constant, implying that
the number of NE links per protein is proportional to
N . To test this, we compared NE rates in the human
and yeast PPI networks. The total number of proteins
in humans is estimated to be 22740 [105] and in yeast,
5616 [106]. The number of mutations to coding DNA is
approximately 0.004/genome/replication in humans and
0.0027/genome/replication in yeast [107]. If the number
of new links is proportional to N , then, based on the number of proteins and the mutation rate, there should be
roughly 600% more links created by NE in humans than
in yeast. However, by counting the number of nonredundant interactions in duplicate gene pairs, it has been
shown empirically that the average number of links cre-

Eigenvalues

The connectivity of a network can be expressed by its
adjacency matrix, an N × N matrix A, in which the entries Aij equal 1 if a link exists between proteins i and j,
and 0 otherwise. If A is normalized by column, then the
entries describe the rates of a transition from i to j in one
time step. The distribution of eigenvalues p(λ) is called
the network’s spectrum (Figure S1). This matrix and its
eigenvalues can be interpreted in terms of a process in
which a random walker starts on one node i, and, over a
series of time steps, reaches another node j. Intuitively,
this can be thought of as a signal propagation rate: if
one protein is affected by an external signal, how long
does it take that signal to diffuse through the network?
The eigenvalues λ of this ‘walk matrix’ describe the rate
at which a random walk on the network reaches steadystate. The second-largest eigenvalue (λ2 ) determines the
rate of convergence of the random walk (Figure S2). A

larger value of λ2 indicates a slower signal propagation
rate.
Error tolerance

We measured the ‘error tolerance’ as described in [29]:
we examined the decrease of f1 when nodes (and their accompanying edges) were deleted from the network either
(1) at random, or (2) according to their degree, starting with the most well-connected node. Results for the
simulated and experimental networks were very similar
(Figure S4).
Simulation length: early versus late evolution

about 1 to 2 billion years, and the fly simulations about
5 billion years. This is compared to the rough estimate of 3.5 billion years since the origin of life on Earth
[108]. The exceptionally long duration of the fly simulations are due to the very low gene duplication rate
(d = 0.001/gene/Myr). The aim of our model is to
describe the evolution of PPI networks with all their
present-day machinery. Gene duplication, in the form
in which it exists today, certainly would not have existed
at the origin of life! The initial state in our model con-

two polypeptides (or, more likely, RNA molecules) in a
pre-biotic soup, that happen to interact in a way that is
mutually beneficial. Each of these molecules has the ability to replicate. This autonomous replication of individual proteins corresponds to ‘gene duplication’ in the very
early stages of evolution. However, this is a very different
conceptual underpinning for the duplication mechanism,
and it seems unlikely to share the present-day values of
the duplication rate. Because, in the early stages of evolution, each time step represents a very long duration in
real time, it is likely that this accounts for the discrepancy in total time elapsed.

Principal component analysis

We examined six features which calculate a value for
each node in the network: degree centrality, clustering
coefficients, closeness centrality, eigenvalue spectrum, betweenness centrality, and mean nearest-neighbor degree.
To quantify the independence of these features, we used
principal component analysis (PCA) [110]. Each feature
assigns a value to each node in the network, giving a
6 × N data matrix, where each row represents a feature
(signal), and each column is a node (sample). We subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation of
each row. This results in a standardized data matrix, denoted by Y. The 6×6 correlation matrix for each species
is defined as C ≡ N 1−1 YYT :

p(`) is approximately Gaussian, with mean 0.17 and standard deviation 0.03 in humans, mean 0.19 and standard
deviation 0.03 in yeast, and mean 0.13 and standard deviation 0.03 in flies. Closeness is a measure of distance,
indicating that the distances within the network are essentially a random walk in ‘node space’. The betweenness
distribution also follows a power law in its tail. This is
an indication of modular structure, due to the overrepresentation of ‘bridge’ proteins, relative to a randomly
connected network.
All species examined show a power law decay in clustering coefficient as a function of degree, C ∼ k −ξ .
Poorly-connected proteins therefore tend to have higher
clustering coefficients, meaning that a greater fraction of
their neighbors are mutually connected.
Disassortative mixing was quantified for the yeast PPI
network in [64] as a power law decrease in median neighbor degree, n ∼ k −δ . This is consistent with our data,
although the very small estimated value of δ = 0.32 indicates only a slight negative relation (Table S1). Interestingly, δ = 0 in both human and fly networks, indicating
that disassortativity may be a trait unique to the yeast
network.

The entries of each C are (from left-to-right, and topto-bottom): degree centrality, clustering coefficients,
betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, eigenvalue
spectrum, and mean nearest-neighbor degree. Many of
the off-diagonal elements of the C matrices are close to
zero, suggesting that the features are to a large extent
independent of one another.
To perform PCA, we diagonalized each correlation matrix,
C = SΛST ,

where Λ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and S has the
eigenvectors of C as its columns. As shown in Figure S6,
the degree and betweenness show similar loadings on the
first two principal components, reflecting the nearly linear relation between these centrality scores (Figure 6).

(Zeros have been suppressed for clarity.) The fraction
of variance explained
by the ith principal component is
P
given by Λii / j Λjj . The closer the number of components required to explain most of the variance is to the
total number of input signals, the more independent the
signals are. In yeast and humans, 4 components are required to explain 90% of the variance; in fruit flies, it requires 5 components. Linear transformations are able to
only modestly reduce the dimensionality of the problem,
suggesting that each feature contributes unique information about the network’s structure. This does not, of
course, rule out the possibility of the existence of other independent, informative features, a far more complicated
question which is outside the scope of this current work.

Our model is rooted in previous modeling efforts. The
basic framework for our model combines the gene duplication mechanism described in [29] with a link creation
mechanism inspired by [52]. The principal difference between our model and previous models is that our model
considers duplication and mutation simultaneously. The
previous models we examined attempted to construct the
PPI network from a single mechanism. Another significant difference is our assimilation mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, previous work has not explicitly
modeled proteins integrating into biological pathways.
We compare the DUNE model to four models previously proposed for PPI networks. Two were evolutionary models: (1) the Vázquez model of DU followed by
rapid loss-of-function mutations [29] and (2) the Berg
‘link dynamics’ model of point mutations coupled with
a PA-like ‘rich-get-richer’ rule for assigning new interactions [52]. (A slightly different DU model is presented
by Pastor-Satorras [111]. However, because the Vázquez
model has been shown to be a better fit to experimental data [112], we have limited our DU-only comparison
here to the Vázquez model.) Two others were static models (models of present-day networks that do not simulate
the network’s evolutionary path) that consider the primary organizing principle to be nonspecific interactions
between proteins: (1) random geometric (RG), a mathematical model where proteins are randomly scattered in a
2 to 4 dimensional box, and any proteins close enough to
one another form an interaction [53] and (2) the ‘MpK’
desolvation model, which assigns interactions based on
proteins’ exposed hydrophobic surface areas [54]. For
reference, we also calculated results for an Erdős-Rényi
(ER) random graph with N and hki set by the data [55].
These models were originally validated against different features of the empirical network, making it difficult
to directly compare them. To characterize these models in greater detail, we coded each of these models, and
ran 50 simulations of each model with identical parameters and starting conditions. Using Matlab, we coded the

FIG. S7. Model comparison. Comparison of five other models to the yeast PPI network: Vázquez [29] (green), Berg [52]
(red), random geometric [53] (dark blue), MpK desolvation [54] (purple), and ER random graph [55] (brown). For reference,
DUNE model results are shown as a black line. Dots represent high-confidence experimental yeast data, and solid lines are
median values over 50 simulations.

Vázquez [29], Berg [52], RG [53], and MpK [54] models
as described in the original papers. Since each model was
originally parametrized for older yeast PPI data sets, we
re-optimized the parameters for our yeast data as follows.
We used a Monte Carlo simulation to adjust each model’s
parameters to minimize the total symmetric mean absolute percentage error values (SMAPE; see below) for the
yeast HitPredict data set.
For the Vázquez model, we used a value of 0.582 for the
post-duplication divergence probability, and a value of
0.083 for the dimerization probability. As noted by previous authors, duplication-only simulations produce networks which are extremely fragmented [89]. We observed
that the Vazquez simulations typically had around 20%
of their nodes in the largest connected component (Ta-

ble II). Since most of the network features we examined
are limited to the largest component, in order to make a
reasonable comparison of the Vazquez simulation results
to the data, we allowed the simulated network to grow
until its number of links met or exceeded 5 times the number of links in the data, K ≥ 5Kdata . Since the largest
component is not always exactly 20% of the total nodes,
this stopping condition is somewhat arbitrary; however,
results for this model seem robust to small changes in
the stopping condition. For the Berg model, we used the
empirically estimated duplication rate of 0.01/gene/Myr,
and found best-fit values of 24.5/gene/Myr for the mutation rate, and Ndata − 98 proteins for the initial network
size. For the RG model, we used a 45.5 × 45.5 × 45.5
‘box’ with a maximum interaction radius of 3.92. For

TABLE S2. Symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) of simulation versus experiment in yeast (Eq. 11). ‘E.T.’ is
the error tolerance curve with random protein removal, and ‘E.T. (k)’ is the error tolerance curve with highest-degree proteins
removed first. ‘DUNE’ is the model described here, ‘Vázquez’ is the DU-only model of [29], ‘Berg’ is the link dynamics model
[52], ‘RG’ is random geometric [53], ‘MpK’ is the physical desolvation model presented in [54], and ‘ER’ is an Erdős-Rényi
random graph [55]. For each comparison, the lowest value is shown in bold.

the MpK model, the number of exposed surface residues
was 19, the fraction of exposed hydrophobic residues was
M = 0.230±0.110 (mean ± standard deviation), and the
best-fit linear equation relating M to the binding threshold was 1.09M + 1.04.
The Vázquez simulations were initialized with 2 connected nodes, and the simulation was allowed to run until K ≥ 5Kdata . The Berg simulations were initialized
with Ndata − 98 randomly connected nodes, then run until N = Ndata . The RG and MpK models (which are not
evolutionary models and therefore create the network all
at once) were set up as described in the original papers.
To characterize the networks, we computed several network properties:
Single-value:: modularity Q, diameter D, fraction of
nodes in the largest component f1 , global clustering
coefficient hCi, and average protein degree in the
largest component hki (Table II)
Distributional:: degree p(k), betweenness p(b), closeness p(`), eigenvalue p(λ), and nearest-neighbor degree p(n) distributions
Scatter plot:: closeness vs. degree `(k), clustering coefficient vs. degree C(k), betweenness vs. degree b(k),
median nearest-neighbor degree vs. degree n(k),
and error tolerance curves
and compared these features to those of empirical data
from yeast. As shown in Figure S7, we found that none

of the previous models capture the full set of network
properties.
To quantify agreement with the data for non-singlevalue features, we calculated the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) between simulation and
experiment [113, 114]:

Y 
1 X yi − yidata 
SMAPE =
,
Y i yi + yidata

(11)

where Y is the number of data points, and yi and yidata
denote the ith point of the response variable (Table S2)
in the simulated and experimental data, respectively. For
the distributional features, Y is the number of bins (arbitrarily chosen to be 100) minus the number of bins
in which yi + yidata = 0. For non-distributional (scatter
plot) features, Y is the number of k values with values for
both simulation and experiment. There are many possible measures of accuracy (such as the widely-used root
mean squared error); we used SMAPE for two reasons.
First, because it relies on absolute value, SMAPE does
not over-emphasize the impact of outliers. Second, dividing by yi + yidata ensures that the magnitude of the
response variable does not overwhelm the sum. This is
significant for the non-distrbutional features. For example, in a plot of betweenness vs. degree (Figure 6), we are
just as interested in the overlap of the low-betweenness,
low-degree region of the curve as we are with the highbetweenness, high-degree region. SMAPE values are collected in Table S2. As shown in Tables II and S2, while
previous models accurately reproduce certain features of
the PPI network, only the DUNE model provides a reasonable across-the-board fit.
