Concentration gradients of signaling molecules are essential for patterning during development
and they have been observed in both unicellular and multicellular systems. In subcellular systems,
clustering of the signaling molecule has been observed. We develop a theoretical model of clustermediated concentration gradient formation based on the Becker-Döring equations of aggregationfragmentation processes. We show that such a mechanism produces robust concentration gradients
on realistic time and spatial scales so long as the process of clustering does not significantly stabilize
the signaling molecule. Finally, we demonstrate that such a model is applicable to the pom1p
subcellular gradient in fission yeast.

INTRODUCTION

Individual cells make precise cell-fate decisions based
on information from signaling networks during development. A central paradigm of information transfer during
development is the morphogen gradient, a spatially varying concentration profile [1]. The dynamics of morphogen
gradient formation [2] and interpretation [3] has been the
subject of intense study, both experimentally [4–8] and
theoretically [9–12].
Single cells can interpret spatial gradients across the
scale of the cell itself, either in response to external chemical gradients - such as chemotactic gradients [13] - or
subcellular gradients. Subcellular concentration gradients are found in the single cell stage of C. elegans development [14], and in single cell organisms including fission
yeast [15, 16] and bacteria [17–21]. In parallel with experimental work, theoretical models have demonstrated
how subcellular gradients can be formed on the relevant
time and spatial scales [22–27].
Clustering, either of the signaling molecules or receptors, is observed in a number of subcellular signaling
systems [28–31]. Receptor clustering helps ensure reliable readout of input signal, for example through receptor clustering by positive feedback that enables binary
on/off decisions [32]. Clustering of signaling molecules is
also observed [29], potentially altering the dynamics of
concentration gradient formation.
Here, we develop a mechanistic model of clustermediated concentration gradient formation based on the
Becker-Döring equations of aggregation-fragmentation
processes [33, 34]. We show that such a model can produce a robust concentration gradient under (certain) biological relevant parameter conditions. In particular, we
find that the process of clustering must not significantly
increase the signal molecule effective lifetime. Finally,

we apply the clustering model to the cortical subcellular gradient pom1p in fission yeast [15, 16, 29, 35]. The
modelling describes how a single component (and its interactions with itself) can create a robust subcellular
concentration gradient by adapting its effective dynamical properties at different spatial positions. Theoretical
approaches on the dynamics of concentration gradient
formation in subcellular systems may need to be significantly different from embryonic systems.

II. AGGREGATION-FRAGMENTATION
MODEL OF GRADIENT FORMATION

We develop a Becker-Döring-like model of concentration gradient formation via clustering. This model takes
into account aggregation, fragmentation and diffusion of
clusters with only a single molecular species. The parameters used are derived from experiments in fission yeast
[29], with typical length and time scales on the order of
a few microns and seconds respectively.

A.

Model motivation

We consider the Becker-Döring equations with conserved number and diffusion [36–38]. The motivation
for such a formalism comes from studies of pom1p in
fission yeast. In time lapse movies, clusters of pom1p
are not observed to coalesce (as in a Smoluchowski process [34], which describes E-Cadherin clustering [39]) but
observed to grow and decay on second time scales, apparently independently of other clusters [29]. Therefore,
we assume that only monomeric molecules are taken up
into a cluster and during fragmentation single molecules
are released from clusters, Fig. 1A. Cluster disassociation events from the membrane are not observed in cells
[29] and so we assume that disassociation involves only a
single molecule at a time (i.e. when a component disassociates from both the cluster and membrane it does so

to join at the insertion region [29] so we consider insertion only in the monomeric form. While difficult to solve
analytically the existence and uniqueness of solutions of
qualitatively similar models can be shown in relevant parameter regimes [37]. We use a one-dimensional model of
concentration gradient formation as our aim is to highlight the important general behavior of such a model.

particles exiting the system (e.g. through membrane disassociation). B Scaling of dynamic parameters as function of

the scaling of α without the term e−s/s0 . For disassociation,
the black line corresponds to equal rate of disassociation of

Parameter scaling

Eqs. 1-3 have a large parameter space, increasing with
smax , the maximum cluster size. However, using biophysical arguments we can reduce the parameter space
to seven non-dimensional parameters as discussed below.
Diffusion: We take Ds = D1 s−rD where rD = 1,
Fig. 1B, consistent with experiments on clustered protein membrane diffusion [29, 40] (note, this contrasts with
theoretical predictions of logarithmic diffusion scaling on
biological membranes [41]). We have confirmed our main
conclusions hold for rD = 2/3 (not shown).
Disassociation: Experimentally, large clusters are not
observed to disassociate from the membrane[29]. Therefore, we assume only single molecules disassociate in each
reaction. We take µs = µ1 s−rµ . rµ = 0 if clustering has
no membrane-stabilizing effect (i.e. the rate of monomer
disassociation is equivalent from all clusters). We also
consider the case rµ = 1, i.e. clustering stabilizes the
signaling molecule within the cluster, Fig. 1B. We shall
see that the latter scenario results in a non-robust gradient and is a key result of this analysis.

Aggregation: Aggregation depends on the cluster size
- bigger clusters are more likely to collide with and aggregate a monomer. How exactly aggregation depends
on the cluster topology is unclear and here we consider
αs = α1 srα with rα = 1/2. Experimentally, there is an
upper limit on the cluster size [29], so an additional term
within the aggregation parameter is included to limit the
maximum size of the clusters: αs = α1 srα e−s/s0 where
s0 = 100 [39], Fig. 1B. Such limitation on the maximum
cluster size could also have been implemented by including a component in the fragmentation rate (below).
Fragmentation: Scaling of the fragmentation rate is
likely to occur via a similar mechanism to aggregation.
Hence, we consider βs = β1 srβ with rβ = rα = 1/2.
We have confirmed that using rβ,α = 1/3 or rβ,α = 2/3
does not significantly alter our key conclusions so long
as rβ = rα . We choose the values of α1 and β1 such
that cluster dynamics are on the order of a few seconds,
consistent with pom1p cluster dynamics [29]. Note, we
use β1 as the lowest order for fragmentation (even though

of these seven parameters, rα,β,D,µ are constrained by
physical arguments as described above. The phenomenological cluster size factor s0 is limited by experimental
observation of cluster sizes [29]. Only κ and β̃ are free
parameters and hence, despite the apparent complexity
of Eqs. 1- 3, the dynamic behavior of the system is effectively described by just two parameters.

of insertion and aggregation (increasing either amplifies
clustering) with diffusion and disassociation (increasing
either reduces clustering). Small κ corresponds to weak

We have demonstrated that a clustering model can produce a concentration gradient on similar spatial and temporal scales observed in subcellular systems. Ultimately,
the concentration profile must be able to impart precise
(i.e. robust) information to the cell. Below, we explore
whether such concentration gradients can be robust to
relevant biological fluctuations. To gain a qualitative understanding, we first discuss a phenomenological model
incorporating concentration-dependent diffusion before
discussing the effects of noise on the clustering model.

dynamics with a resulting steep concentration gradient.
Using biologically plausible parameter values [29], both
κ and β̃ occur at values that allow large clusters to form
(to give benefits of modulating diffusion) without permitting very large clusters to dominate the dynamics,
particularly away from the source region.

in Eq. 8) and degradation (SDD model), Table II. We
define robustness as the positional error, δx in defining a

(9)

due to concentration fluctuations δρ(x, t) (ρ0 is the spatial derivative) from, for example, variations in J. δx is
dependent on when and where measurement occurs. We
focus on the spatial position in steady-state for distances
around 2 − 3µm from the source, consistent with boundaries in fission yeast. Interestingly, in steady-state, δx is
independent of position for all three models if the concentration fluctuations are due to variation in the injection
rate J, Fig. 3B, [9]. Previously, it has been shown that
a model with non-linear degradation (NLD) can produce
concentration profiles that are robust to variations in the
insertion rate [9]. In Fig. 3B we demonstrate that the
CDD model, just as with the NLD model, is more robust

5
to variations in the insertion rate compared to the SDD
model when 0 < r < 1.
Another source of error are stochastic biochemical (intrinsic) fluctuations, relevant in both embryonic and subcellular systems [29, 43–45]. Such fluctuations are typically well-described by Poisson statistics [46, 47]:
r

δρint = a
,
(10)
DT
where a is a constant that is assumed to be model independent and T is the averaging period. NLD models are
generally less robust to intrinsic fluctuations [47]. However, in the CDD model the diffusion coefficient increases
with distance from the source, which in turn increases
the effects of time averaging [46] and hence reduces the
detrimental effects of intrinsic fluctuations. In Fig. 3C we
show that the SDD model is most robust to such variations at x/λ = 2, but concentration-dependent diffusion
results in more robust gradients than those formed by
non-linear degradation processes.

B.

Robustness of clustering model

Having developed a qualitative understanding of the
robustness of concentration-dependent diffusion to relevant fluctuations we now discuss the robustness of the
full clustering model, Eqs 1-3.
To test the robustness of the clustering model to variations in protein insertion we first created 250 profiles using parameters in Fig. 1 but with the insertion rate Gaus¯ standard deviation δJ = 0.2J),
¯
sian distributed (mean J,
Fig. 4A. Fig. 4B shows that the concentration at x = 0
¯ increases rapidly
(normalized by the value when J = J)
(faster than equivalent SDD model) as J increases; as
expected, the fluctuations at the source are increased in
the clustering model. Following [9], we define the characteristic length scale of the profile as
λef f (x) = ρ(x)/|ρ0 (x)| .

(11)

λef f is a function of position and henceforth we consider
the mean λef f in the range 2µm < x < 3µm, hλi2−3µm .
In Fig. 4B, we see that hλi2−3µm scales inversely with
increasing J (unlike the SDD model). Therefore, the
increases variation at x = 0 is compensated for by adaptation in the characteristic profile length. This results
in the cluster model providing precise spatial information, Fig. 4C, compared to SDD model. In Fig. 4C we
also show that the positional accuracy of the clustering
model is significantly reduced when clustering stabilizes
the protein. Therefore, the clustering model is only robust if individual monomers only spend a relatively short
period in each cluster - if they are too stable then the robustness is lost.
The trend of λef f being inversely proportional to J
can be derived using a two-state (monomer / clustered)
model [29]. However, in such a model fluctuations at

the source increase especially quickly with increasing δJ.
Here, our more precise analysis shows that clustering results in a robust gradient when comparing the competing
effects of ρ(x = 0) and λef f fluctuations with changing
J (note that the particular effect is position dependent).
Furthermore, we see that the robustness is due to the
effective spatial adaptation of the diffusion coefficient,
which is highly dependent on β̃, Fig. 2B, as well as on
the scaling of the disassociation rate with cluster size.
The simplifications used in the two-state model meant
that the critical relationship between fragmentation and
disassociation rates was not appreciated, highlighting a
further advantage of our more detailed approach.
Finally, we compare the effects of intrinsic fluctuations
on the robustness of the clustering model. The processes
of clustering are non-linear and therefore the Poisson approximation is less valid. However, direct experimental measurement of intrinsic fluctuations in a subcellular
gradient [29] suggest that away from the source region
(x & 2µm), where diffusion is the predominant dynamic
mechanism, that intrinsic fluctuations are approximated
closely by Poisson statistics. Therefore, Eq. 10 is a reasonable approximation to the intrinsic noise here, though
likely represents a lower bound on the true intrinsic noise
due to neglected non-linear effects from clustering processes. In Fig. 4D we show the positional accuracy of the
cluster model given Poisson distributed intrinsic fluctuations, compared to the SDD model with similar profile
shape and protein disassociation rate. The two models
have qualitatively similar sensitivity to intrinsic fluctuations due to their similar profile shape, Eq. 10. The clustering model is less sensitive to intrinsic fluctuations than
the CDD and NLD models discussed above as the latter
two models have algebraic, rather than exponential-like,
profiles [47].

IV.

POM1P SUBCELLULAR GRADIENT

We apply our clustering model to the specific case of
pom1p in fission yeast and its repression of the downstream target cdr2p [15, 16, 48]. We incorporate spatially
distributed pom1p insertion in the polar region [27, 29].
The formation of the pom1p subcellular gradient has
been modelled previously [29, 49, 50]. However, these
approaches either did not consider clustering [49, 50] or
presented only a qualitative model of clustering with only
two states [29].
Cdr2p itself is known to cluster; indeed, it forms significantly larger clusters with around 80-100 molecules
in the clusters localized to the cell center [51]. Pom1p
has a dual effect on cdr2p. First, it is involved in cdr2p
dephosphorylation, resulting in cdr2p membrane disassociation. Second, it inhibits cdr2p cluster formation. This
double mechanism of repression helps produce the sharp
response of cdr2p to pom1p inhibition [48], Fig. 5A,B.
We use a phenomenological model of cdr2p cluster formation since our focus is on pom1p and how accurately it

[29]) with additional interactions between pom1p (where

Eq. 6) and cdr2p (where [C1,2 ] denotes cdr2p concentration in monomeric and clustered forms respectively),

FIG. 5. (Colour online) A Experimentally measured (normalized) intensity profiles for pom1p (red) and cdr2 (green)
on the cortex of fission yeast cells (n = 14), see [51] for details. Distance defined as the distance around the cortex of
the cell starting from the tip, as shown by the white line in
inset. Inset: Midplane confocal image of fission yeast expressing pom1p-tomato in the tip (red) and cdr2-GFP at
the cell center (green). B Interactions between pom1p and
cdr2p on the membrane. Pom1p actively disassociates cdr2p
from the membrane (yellow box) and also inhibits the ability of cdr2p to cluster (orange box). C Normalized concentration profiles for pom1p (red) and cdr2p (green) generated
from Eqs. 1-3, 12,13. Parameters for pom1p as Fig. 1. For
cdr2p, η1 = η2 /2 = 10−3 s−1 , Jc = 2.6s−1 , [P ]0 = 20µm−1 ,
Dc,1 = 0.5µm2 s−1 , Dc,2 = 0.01µm2 s−1 , µc,1 = µc,2 /2 =
2.5 × 10−3 s−1 , αc = 0.1α1 and βc = 0.1β1 . D Positional error
in the cdr2p profile when the pom1p insertion rate has 25%
Gaussian variation. Results for clustering model (triangles)
and equivalent SDD model (circles) shown.

ior: αc ([P ]) = αc,0 (1 + ([P ]/[P ]0 )4 )−1 . This simplified
model recapitulates the observed pom1p and cdr2p profiles, Fig. 5C. The fitting from the above model to the
measured pom1p and cdr2p profiles represents a significant improvement over previous models [29, 49, 50] both
in replicating the spatial profiles and reproducing the dynamics of clustering and gradient formation.
To test the system robustness we created 200 pom1p
profiles, with insertion rate normally distributed with
standard deviation 25% of the mean and subsequent
cdr2p profiles using Eqs. 12-13. At each position investigated we found the mean total cdr2p concentration and
used this to define the threshold concentration for that
position. For each individual cdr2p profile we then measured the position where it had each particular threshold
concentration and hence calculated the positional precision of cdr2p specification by calculating the standard deviation in these positions. Near the source there is large
variation due to the big intensity changes in pom1p be-

7
tween cells. Near the cell center there is large error due
to the pom1p profile becoming increasingly flat. However, around 2 − 3µm from the source which corresponds
to the region where the boundary between pom1p and
cdr2p is defined - we see that the cdr2p can be positioned
more accurately (compared with equivalent SDD model)
by pom1p when it clusters, Fig. 5D. Of course, including intrinsic fluctuations would decrease the positional
precision so the given accuracy represents a best case
scenario (experimentally, errors of around 1µm are typically observed [29]). In conclusion, a dynamic clustering
mechanism for concentration gradient formation can provide robust positional information on relevant time and
spatial scales for a biologically plausible scenario.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Previous modelling of clustering within cells has predominantly analyzed receptor clustering. Here, we have
focused on the role of clustering in the formation of concentration gradients and demonstrated that subcellular
gradients can be formed via clustering on realistic spatial
and temporal scales. This work represents a significant
advance on previous models of subcellular concentration
gradient formation [29, 46, 50, 52] as it accounts for protein clustering and diffusion in a mechanistic (though still
relatively straightforward) framework that also incorporates realistic protein dynamics, and allows predictions to
be made about the behaviour of specific dynamic components (see below).
Our modeling enables the following predictions regarding the clustering of signaling molecules. (i) the process
of clustering does not significantly stabilize (whether that
be by extending protein lifetime or membrane association
time) the individual molecules within the concentration
gradient. If clustering significantly stabilizes the protein
in the relevant system then the resultant chemical gradient is not robust. This result is qualitatively consistent
with the dynamics of pom1p, where the cluster lifetime
is significantly shorter than the pom1p lifetime on the
membrane [29]. (ii) The ratio of the fragmentation rate
to disassociation rate plays an important role in the gradient formation. Either too small or big a ratio results in
reduced spatial diffusion modulation and hence less robust concentration gradients. Therefore, systems that
use clustering in concentration gradient formation are
likely to have carefully tuned fragmentation and disassociation rates and experimental perturbation of either
should result in significantly reduced robustness. (iii)
Clustering is favorable in systems that have a single decision to make (e.g. placement of division boundary) but
it is less likely to be used in systems that specify multiple
boundaries. Near the source there is increased inaccuracy due to larger fluctuations in the concentration and
at very large distances the profile becomes very flat due
to only small, fast, clusters being present. Depending on

the specific parameters, there will likely be an optimal
region for concentration gradient interpretation.
Given the advantages described above, why is clustering of signaling molecules (i.e. morphogens) not observed
more commonly in multicellular systems? In single cells
where a simple decision is made by the signaling pathway
(e.g. where to define the cell center) then clustering may
be advantageous as dynamic parameters can be tuned
to maximize precision at the relevant position but for
morphogen gradients, that typically define three or more
threshold positions across their spatial range, clustering
may not be beneficial. Further, multicellular organisms
typically have more time and complexity to adjust for
variation in the input signal, such as via feedback networks [7, 53]. We note that the Hedgehog signaling protein is observed to cluster [54] but this is likely due to its
need for a chaperone to aid it in traversing through the
intercellular space due to its hydrophobic nature [54].
We have considered a one-dimensional mean-field scenario. Two-dimensional simulations of the clustering
model could be interesting, as the stochastic noise in such
a (plausible) scenario is non-trivial, particularly near the
insertion region. However, experimental evidence suggests that the approximations used here are relevant in
the signaling region (i.e. away from the source). Further, extension to Smoluchowski processes where clusters
directly interact with each other may be interesting but,
as noted above, such a scenario is not consistent with
current experimental observations of subcellular concentration gradients.
Overall, we have presented a quantitative framework
for understanding subcellular concentration gradient formation. In particular, our model can simultaneously
replicate observed experimental spatial profiles and dynamics. Importantly, despite the apparent complexity of
such a clustering model, through biophysical arguments
we reduced our model to two relevant parameters to describe the concentration gradient. The resulting concentration profile is robust to relevant biochemical fluctuations so long as the process of clustering does not significantly stabilize the signaling molecule.
