Abstract
The functional relevance of regulating proteins is often limited to specific binding sites such as
the ends of microtubules or actin-filaments. A localization of proteins on these functional sites is
of great importance. We present a quantitative theory for a diffusion and capture process, where
proteins diffuse on a filament and stop diffusing when reaching the filament‚Äôs end. It is found that
end-association after one-dimensional diffusion is the main source for tip-localization of such proteins. As a consequence, diffusion and capture is highly efficient in enhancing the reaction velocity
of enzymatic reactions, where proteins and filament ends are to each other as enzyme and substrate.
We show that the reaction velocity can effectively be described within a Michaelis-Menten framework. Together one-dimensional diffusion and capture beats the (three-dimensional) Smoluchowski
diffusion limit for the rate of protein association to filament ends.

The catalytic activity of enzymes is often restricted to specific binding sites. The ends of microtubules
(MTs) for example are binding sites for a plethora of MT associated proteins (MAPs) [1]. At MT ends,
MAPs can catalyze biochemical processes [2], or serve as substrates for other enzymes. This makes an
efficient association of MAPs to MT tips important. Recent experiments suggest that one-dimensional
diffusion of MAPs on MTs facilitates tip-targeting [3, 4]. This idea goes back to the concept of ‚Äúreduction
in dimensionality‚Äù suggested by Adam and Delbr√ºck [5] and has been largely applied [6, 7]. However,
a quantitative understanding of tip-binding mediated by diffusion on the filament and subsequent capture
at the tip has remained elusive [3, 8‚Äì16].
Here we show that capturing at the tip is crucial for tip-localization of proteins. We present a theory where diffusion and capture is accurately quantified with an effective association rate constant and
provide a result which depends only on experimentally accessible parameters. For proteins which are enzymatically active at filament ends, our theory predicts that diffusion and capture leads to an enhancement
of the enzymatic reaction velocity due to stronger tip-localization. We observe that the reaction velocity in dependence of the enzyme concentration closely follows a Michaelis-Menten curve and quantify
the contribution of one-dimensional diffusion to tip-localization and enzymatic processes downstream
thereof.
To model the diffusive motion of proteins on a filament we consider a one-dimensional lattice of
length l with lattice spacing a = 8.4 nm [Fig. 1A]. The lattice corresponds to a single protofilament of a
stabilized MT in the absence of dynamic instability. Proteins perform a random walk on the lattice with
a hopping rate ; the diffusion constant is D =  a2 . Each site can be occupied by only one protein; the
system is an exclusion process [17]. Proteins attach to and detach from the lattice at rates œâon c and œâoff ,
respectively, where c is the concentration of proteins in solution. The tip of the MT is represented by
the first lattice site in our model. To account for its particular structure, different on- and off-rates are
1

assumed there, kon c and koff . Proteins that bind to the tip are captured, i.e. not allowed to hop on the
lattice, but still may detach into solution. This important condition is a critical difference between our
model and previous approaches [3, 16], see also the Supporting Material.
A central goal of this letter is to quantify the relative contributions of diffusion and capture (tipattachment after diffusion on the lattice) and end-targeting (attachment after diffusion in solution) [Fig. 1B]
to tip-localization. To this end we calculated the probability to find a protein at the end of a protofilament
(the tip density œÅ+ ). In the absence of diffusion and capture, the Langmuir isotherm is obtained,
œÅ+ (c) =

c
,
K +c

(1)

where K = koff /kon is the dissociation constant of the protein at the tip. However, as noted previously [3, 4], such a model is incomplete as it does not account for the additional protein flux along
protofilaments mediated by diffusion and capture. We have analyzed this flux by stochastic simulations
of the model [Fig. 1]. Surprisingly, we find that over a broad range of concentrations c, the additional
Dc
protein current to an unoccupied reaction site J D effectively obeys first order kinetics, i.e. J D = kon

[Supporting Material Fig. S2]. This observation implies that despite the complexity of the diffusionreaction process one approximately retains the functional form of the Langmuir isotherm. Accounting
for the diffusion-capture contribution to the rate of protein attachment leads to an effective dissociation

Refer to the Supporting Material for a detailed derivation of Eqs. 1-3. Together Eqs. 1-3 comprise an
effective theory for the association of proteins to the tip which accounts for direct end-targeting as well
as the diffusion-capture process. With Eq. 3 we are able to quantitatively predict the relative contribution
of diffusion and capture to tip-binding for different proteins that diffuse on filaments. The results are
shown in Fig. 2: 90 ‚àí 99% of molecules bind to the tip through one-dimensional diffusion given they
follow diffusion and capture.
Tip-localization due to diffusion and capture as predicted by our theory has important implications
for enzymatically active proteins. We extended the model to investigate enzymatic reactions at the MT
tip, where the protein-tip complex catalyzes a product at rate kcat [Fig. 1C]. In detail, we assume that
the protein does not leave the tip after catalyzing a reaction, but only through detachment into solution.
These model assumptions are consistent with filament polymerizing enzymes that act processively, such
as XMAP215 for MTs [9, 10], and VASP [15] and formins [18] for actin filaments. The assumption of a
constant length l in our model is excellent if the rate of diffusion is fast compared to the polymerization
rate. With the above model assumptions the reaction velocity v is determined by the tip density, v =
œÅ+ kcat . We can apply our previous results, Eqs. 1 -3, to obtain
v(c) = kcat œÅ+ (c) =

kcat c

The above equation is reminiscent of a single-molecule Michaelis-Menten equation [19, 20] when K eff
is reinterpreted as Michaelis constant and substrate and enzyme concentrations are interchanged. In this

MTs, and VASP on actin filaments, see Ref. [15] and personal communicaton [S.D.
Hansen and R.D. Mullins, 2014]. There are also proteins that diffuse on MTs without enzymatic activity at MT ends, but with roles downstream of tip-localization,
e.g. in the protein network of MT tips [1]: NCD80 [11]; CLIP ‚àí 170 [12]; NuMa,
PRC1, EB1 [13]; Aurora ‚àí B [14].

diffusion and capture; instead of solving a complex many-body problem it suffices to apply a mathematical framework which is analogous to (single-molecule) Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the details of

accordance with experimental results for several enzymatically active proteins where Michaelis-Menten
curves were observed for the reaction speed depending on the enzyme concentration [8, 9]. Inspired by
the processive (de)polymerase activity of (MCAK) XMAP215, we assume that enzyme and substrate are
not decomposed in the reaction step. However, it is straightforward to include a decomposition in the

theory: the effective dissociation constant would read K eff = (koff + kcat )/kon

Our analytical results, Eqs. 2-4, agree well with simulation results of the stochastic model, as shown

thereby reduces the effective dissociation constant typically by more than one order of magnitude, e.g.

where the denominator is the square root of the average number of diffusive steps a protein performs on
the filament. Note that one-dimensional diffusion without capturing [16] does not lead to a particle flux
on the filament [Supporting Material Fig. S4] and hence the reaction velocity is not increased [Fig. 3A].
Further, the particle flux might be limited by the length of the filament: Below a threshold length lc
(which is smaller than typical in vivo lengths of MTs) we observe a length dependent behavior of the
reaction velocity [Supporting Material Fig. S3] where our theory is not valid.
Our analysis reveals diffusion and capture as an efficient mechanism to circumvent the diffusion
limit for the rate of end-targeting: Smoluchowski‚Äôs theory of three-dimensional diffusion physically
limits the rate of direct tip-attachment from solution [21]. As shown here, one-dimensional diffusion
along a filament and subsequent capture at the filament end overcomes this limitation. This has been
shown experimentally for MCAK [3]. Our work provides an applicable theory for reaction kinetics
facilitated by diffusion and capture: specific parameter values for diffusion, tip-association and dwell
times can be accounted for, cf. Eqs. 3 and 4. On a broader perspective our results may also be applicable
to other systems where one-dimensional diffusion is important [6] including transcription factor binding
on DNA [22].

Derivation of Eq. (1), (2), and (4)

In the following we derive the reaction velocity of the model presented in the Main Text. We start by
considering the model depicted in Fig. S1 (A): Particles from a reservoir with concentration c can bind
reversibly to a single reaction site with rates kon c for binding and koff for unbinding. As long as the
proteins are bound to the tip, they perform a not specified reaction at rate kcat . Inspired by the processive

FIGURE S1: Illustration of the chemical reaction considered in this section. Particles (blue circles) from a reservoir with concentration c bind reversibly to an unoccupied (dashed circles) reaction site at rates kon c for binding and koff for unbinding.
Whilst bound, the particles catalyze a (not specified) reaction at rate kcat . In (A)
particles can only attach directly via the reservoir. In (B) we have an additional particle flux J D to the reaction site due to a diffusion and capture mechanism described
in the Main Text.
(de)polymerase activity of XMAP215 (MCAK), there is no decomposition of the particle and the reaction
site in the reaction step. Including a decomposition in the model would however be straightforward (see
also the discussion in the Main Text). Let n+ denote an occupied (n+ = 1) or vacant (n+ = 0) reaction
site. Then, the average velocity of the reaction is given by
v = hn+ ikcat .

(S1)

Here, the average refers to an ensemble average. Since the reaction site corresponds to the last lattice site
of one protofilament, we expect our results to be valid for experimental setups with a sufficiently large

7

and constant number of protofilaments or (due to ergodicity) for the time average with respect to a single
protofilament. In the steady state the equation for the average occupation of the reaction site reads
0=

d
hn+ i = kon c(1 ‚àí hn+ i) ‚àí koff hn+ i .

(S2)

Solving for hn+ i leads to an equation for the reaction velocity which is analogous to a single molecule
Michaelis-Menten equation [1]:
v=

K +c

(S3)

with K = koff /kon . Note that here c is the concentration of the enzyme, not the substrate.
If we now have an additional particle flux J to the reaction site via one-dimensional diffusion, Fig. S1
(B), the dynamics are changed. Including this flux in the equation for the average reaction site occupation
leads to

In conclusion, observing a Michaelis-Menten curve for the reaction velocity in dependence of the
enzyme concentration c is equivalent to the statement, that the current of particles towards an unoccupied
reaction site due to the diffusion and capture mechanism obeys first order kinetics. In Fig. S2 simulation
results of our model show that the linearity condition is indeed approximately fulfilled over a broad
parameter range. The corresponding parameter values are chosen within the typical parameter range for
one-dimensionally diffusing proteins (see Fig. 2 in the Main Text). Note that for high concentrations
which imply almost saturated reaction velocities we observe a, in general, non-linear behavior. In such a
parameter range extended analytic approaches than the ones presented here would be necessary. For the
analysis shown in this work these deviations are, however, not relevant as we are interested in quantities
which are almost saturated at such concentrations (tip-occupation and reaction velocity; particle current
to the tip).

Derivation of Eq. (3)
Mathematical model definition

The mathematical formulation of the model depicted in Fig. 1 of the Main Text relies on a probabilistic
description of the lattice site occupations. A basic introduction to lattice gases and related problems can
be found in Ref. [2]. The occupation numbers ni with i ‚àà {0, . . . , L ‚àí 1} describe the configuration of
particles on the lattice, where ni = 0 and ni = 1 stand for an empty or occupied lattice site respectively.
The equations of motion for the density on each lattice site are obtained in terms of the mean occupation
numbers hni i = œÅi . Further it is assumed that neighboring lattice sites are occupied independently, which

FIGURE S2: The current due to the diffusion and capture mechanism towards an
unoccupied reaction site shows linearity in c over a broad parameter range. The
dashed line is the concentration, where the reaction velocity is 90% saturated, v =
0.9 kcat . For concentrations close to the maximum reaction velocity the current
differs from the linear behavior. This is, however, largely negligible because v and
J are almost saturated.

proximation is not a restriction for the computations performed to derive kon

Note that we consider the terminal site separately and refer to its average occupation as tip density œÅ+ ,
œÅ+ := œÅ0 = hn0 i .

(S8)

The lattice site next to the tip, i = 1, is also considered distinct from the bulk dynamics: It serves as a
boundary for the diffusive region. The equations of motion for sites i = 0, 1 are

The density in the bulk is (in leading order of a gradient expansion) governed by the following diffusion

with x = ai. This is a continuous approximation of Eq. S6. The boundary conditions are limx‚Üí‚àû œÅ(x) =
œÅLa and œÅ(a) = œÅ1 . The solution is obtained in the steady state ‚àÇt œÅ(x, t) = 0 and reads

i = 0 and i = 1 the density profile is not continuous and the diffusion equation can not be applied. The
remaining task is to determine the values for œÅ0 and œÅ1 in the steady state.

B.2

Low density approximation

To make progress, the particle flux from site i = 2 to site i = 1 from Eq. S10 is rewritten as a derivative:
(œÅ2 ‚àí œÅ1 ) ‚âà a‚àÇx œÅ(x)|x=a . This corresponds again to a continuous description at the corresponding
sites. Using Eq. S12 we see that the (right) derivative at x = a (which is equivalent to i = 1) is
‚àÇx œÅ|x=a+ = ‚àí(œÅ1 ‚àí œÅLa )/Œª. With this result we can simplify Eq. S10 in the steady state

where attachment and detachment rates have been assumed small. Further, note that we solve Eq. S9 in
the steady state for œÅ0 as a function of œÅ1 :
œÅ0 =

œÅ1  + kon c + koff

(S15)

The key relation at the basis of our theory is that tip attachment via lattice diffusion obeys first-order
reaction kinetics. This is well confirmed by simulations over a broad and biologically relevant parameter

assume œÅ1 to be small. This is well justified for low concentrations. Note also that the density along the

Length dependent behavior for short filaments

For filaments shorter than a critical length lc our model implies a length dependent tip-density, see
Fig. S3. Below lc the particle flux due to diffusion and capture is limited because the filament is shorter
than the length scale of free diffusion. For XMAP215 we find lc ‚âà 0.5 ¬µm. This means that for typical in
vivo lengths of MTs, where l > lc , the enhancement of tip association through one-dimensional diffusion
and capture is realized. However, below lc length dependent behavior might occur.

Differences to work by Helenius et al. [4] and Klein et al. [3]

There are several differences between our work and previous theoretical investigations of the topic. Work
by Helenius et al. [4] did not address the question of reaction kinetics and motor occupations at the
MT tip. Their approach based on differential equations leads to mathematical inconsistencies when
considering a capturing mechanism. This is why we pursued a different approach using a lattice gas. It
allows us to account for the capturing mechanism which in turn leads to an explicit expression for the tip
density. If the tip is highly occupied, the current saturates at a value which is approximately given by the
off-rate at the tip, koff . This saturation effect is not included in the model by Helenius et al. [4], but is
accounted for in our model. In Fig. S4 we compare the particle current J obtained by Helenius et al. with
our result. For high concentrations, there are large deviations between our model and the approximation
in [4]. Work by Klein et al. [3] did not include capturing at the MT tip. Therefore there is a vanishing
current to the tip if diffusion is fast compared to the enzymatic reaction at the tip, cf. Fig. S4.

FIGURE S4: Differences in the (total) protein current J to the MT tip between this
work and previous theoretical approaches. A continuous diffusion equation with
absorbing boundary condition leads to a linear relation J ‚àù c [4]. A lattice gas
without capturing [3] (reflecting boundary condition) has a vanishing current to the
tip J = 0.
