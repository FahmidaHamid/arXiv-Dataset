Abstract
The method of generalized modeling has been applied successfully in many different
contexts, particularly in ecology and systems biology. It can be used to analyze the
stability and bifurcations of steady-state solutions. Although many dynamical systems
in mathematical biology exhibit steady-state behaviour one also wants to understand
nonlocal dynamics beyond equilibrium points. In this paper we analyze predatorprey dynamical systems and extend the method of generalized models to periodic
solutions. First, we adapt the equilibrium generalized modeling approach and compute
the unique Floquet multiplier of the periodic solution which depends upon so-called
generalized elasticity and scale functions. We prove that these functions also have to
satisfy a flow on parameter (or moduli) space. Then we use Fourier analysis to provide
computable conditions for stability and the moduli space flow. The final stability
analysis reduces to two discrete convolutions which can be interpreted to understand
when the predator-prey system is stable and what factors enhance or prohibit stable
oscillatory behaviour. Finally, we provide a sampling algorithm for parameter space
based on nonlinear optimization and the Fast Fourier Transform which enables us to
gain a statistical understanding of the stability properties of periodic predator-prey
dynamics.

Keywords: Generalized models, periodic orbits, predator-prey system, Floquet theory,
moduli space flow, Fourier series, discrete convolution, parameter sampling, optimization,
correlation.

Introduction

Predator-prey systems have been a cornerstone in mathematical biology for many decades
[4]. Standard textbooks on dynamical systems, differential equations and ecology provide
a plethora of models that aim at capturing the interaction between a predator population
Y and a prey population X. Examples for modeling the situation by ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) are [6, 5]

where pi , ki are parameters and (LV) are the Lotka-Volterra equations and (RM) is the
Rosenzweig-MacArthur model [32]. These two models are the most common examples of a
large class of different models of the form
X ′ = S(X) − G(X, Y )
Y ′ = αG(X, Y ) − M(Y )

(1)

where α > 0 is a parameter describing biomass conversion efficiency and the functions S, G
and M represent prey growth, predation, and predator mortality, respectively. Because the
parameter α can always be removed by scaling the variable Y and re-labelling the functions
we will always assume α = 1 from now on.
Generalized models [20, 33] directly work with the formulation (1) without specifying
functional forms for S, G and M. Previous works on generalized models [14, 15, 12, 52]
focused on analyzing the dynamics close to stationary states. Beyond the structure of the
equations (1) this analysis requires only the assumption that steady states exist in the class
of models under consideration. The central idea of generalized modeling is to parametrize
all possible Jacobians that can be encountered in steady states in the class of systems under
consideration. Using a specific renormalization procedure, one can define parameters that are
easily interpretable (and often also directly measurable) in the context of an application. Applications of generalized models to ecology can be found in [19, 18, 17, 20, 21, 3, 47, 22, 48, 50].
Let us emphasize that we do not claim that stability results from generalized models have
not been observed before in some specific models; in fact, the literature on stability of planarpredator prey systems is very large. For instance, questions of local and global stability have
been investigated in various predator-prey systems [13, 26, 49, 40, 36].
In the present paper we go beyond the previous analysis and study nonstationary dynamics in the context of generalized modeling. We extend the theory of generalized models
to arbitrary periodic solutions in the context of the predator-prey system (1). We show that
this mathematical extension of generalized models yields several new phenomena in comparison to generalized models for steady states. For example, we can define time-periodic
generalized parameters of the predator-prey model and we prove that these functions obey
a system of ODEs (a flow on moduli space). Using Floquet theory [7] and Fourier analysis
[28] we derive analytical conditions for the solvability of the moduli space flow and obtain
an analytical stability formula. In this context, a main result is that the stability formula
for periodic solutions only depends on two constants that can be calculated via a discrete
convolution. Using this formula we can identify parameters and conditions that enhance
the stability of predator-prey cycles. Furthermore, we develop an algorithmic approach to
sample the function space of parameters by solving an auxiliary optimization problem, which
will be instrumental for future applications to larger systems.
The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we recall the necessary tools from steadystate generalized models, Floquet theory, and Fourier analysis. In Section 3, we calculate
the generalized vector field for non-equilibrium solutions. In Section 4, we derive the flow
on moduli space. In Section 5, we compute the generalized scale and elasticity functions for
several specific functional forms to gain a better understanding how generalized and specific
models link up. In Section 6, we use tools from Fourier analysis to derive algebraic conditions
2

from the moduli space flow. In Section 7, we provide an analytical stability analysis of
periodic orbits in generalized predator-prey models. Using this result we can identify which
situations increase or decrease stability and interpret the results in an ecological context.
In Section 8, we develop a sampling technique for generalized scale and elasticity functions
that is based on solving an auxiliary optimization problem and the Fast Fourier Transform.
We also use this sampling-based approach to improve our understanding of stabilizing and
destabilizing factors of the predator-prey system. In Section 9, we conclude with a brief
summary and outline the large range of applications and theoretical challenges that can be
found in non-equilibrium generalized models.

Background

In this section we introduce essential tools and techniques that will be used throughout this
work. Further, we use the opportunity to fix the notation. Below, we denote a general
ordinary differential equation ODE by
dZ
= Z ′ = F (Z),
for Z ∈ RN
(2)
dt
and assume always that F is sufficiently smooth. In the following we are going to recall the
necessary tools from steady state generalized models, Floquet theory and Fourier analysis.

2.1

Generalized Models

Let us start by reviewing generalized modeling [20] for ODEs with equilibrium points. A
detailed mathematical approach to generalized models can be found in [33]. For the present
discussion we restrict ourselves to review generalized models in the context of a planar
predator-prey system [21]. Such systems describe the interaction of a population of prey X
and a population of predators Y. The prey population grows at rate S(X), predation occurs
at rate G(X, Y ) and natural mortality of the predator at rate M(Y ). Denoting the prey
density as X and predator density as Y we capture the dynamics by
X ′ = S(X) − G(X, Y ),
Y ′ = G(X, Y ) − M(Y ),

(3)

where S, M ∈ C r (R+ , R+ ) and G ∈ C r (R+ × R+ , R+ ) are sufficiently smooth functions.
Generalized modeling assumes that (3) admits an equilibrium point (X, Y ) = (X ∗ , Y ∗ ) ∈
R+ × R+ .
We normalize the equilibrium defining new coordinates
X
Y
and
y := ∗ .
(4)
∗
X
Y
This transformation moves the equilibrium to (x, y) = (1, 1). The next step is to normalize
the rate functions
S(X ∗ x)
G(X ∗ x, Y ∗ , y)
M(Y ∗ y)
s(x) :=
,
g(x,
y)
:=
,
m(y)
:=
.
(5)
S(X ∗ )
G(X ∗ , Y ∗ )
M(Y ∗ )
x :=

A direct substitution of (4)-(5) into (3) gives
x′ =
y′ =

∗
∗
S(X ∗ )
s(x) − G(XX ∗,Y ) g(x, y),
X ∗∗ ∗
∗
G(X ,Y )
g(x, y) − MY(Y∗ ) m(y),
Y∗

(6)

where the prefactors of the form S(X ∗ )/X ∗ , G(X ∗ , Y ∗ )/X ∗ , etc. represent normalized fluxes
in the steady state and are also called scale parameters
βs :=

β2 :=

G(X ∗ , Y ∗ )

Since (x, y) = (1, 1) is an equilibrium point we know that the following holds:
0 =

S(X ∗ )

X ∗∗ ∗

G(X ,Y )

Y∗

= βs − β1 ,
= β2 − βm .

(8)

Therefore (6) can be re-written as
x′ = β1 (s(x) − g(x, y)),
y ′ = β2 (g(x, y) − m(y)).
The Jacobian at the equilibrium (x, y) = (1, 1) is then given by


β1 ∂x [s(x) − g(x, y)]|(x,y)=(1,1)
−β1 ∂y [g(x, y)]|(x,y)=(1,1)
J(1, 1) =
β2 ∂x [g(x, y)]|(x,y)=(1,1)
β2 ∂y [g(x, y) − m(y)]|(x,y)=1,1


β1 [sx − gx ]
−β1 gy
=:
β2 gx
β2 [gy − my ]

(9)

(10)
(11)

where ∂x , ∂y denote partial derivatives and we refer to the constants
sx = ∂x (s(x))|x=1 ,
gy = ∂y (g(x, y))|(x,y)=(1,1) ,

gx = ∂x (g(x, y))|(x,y)=(1,1),
my = ∂y (m(y))|y=1 ,

(12)

as elasticities. The scale parameters and elasticities are also referred to as generalized parameters.
In the following we will use the insight that every power law function corresponds to an
elasticity that is identical to the exponent of the power law. For example, if we assume that
the mortality M(Y ) is a linear function M(Y ) = KY then we find




M(Y ∗ y)
KY ∗ y
my = ∂y
|y=1 = ∂y
|y=1 = 1.
M(Y ∗ )
KY ∗
Hence we can relate the growth properties of the unspecified functions forms to the elasticities.
The stability of the equilibrium (x, y) = (1, 1) can be inferred from the eigenvalues of
J(1, 1) and hence only depends on the generalized parameters. This admits a bifurcation
analysis of all steady state models of the form (3) in generalized parameter space. Despite
4

the large class of models that one treats simultaneously it is often easy to interpret scale
parameters and elasticities in applications [20]. Thereby a generalized model enables us
to draw conclusions about a whole class of differential equations, for further examples see
[22, 48, 46, 42, 12].
We note that generalized modeling can also be applied to equilibria for delay equations
[27, 33], spatially homogeneous states for partial differential equations [3] and to stochastic
differential equations [33].

2.2

Floquet Theory

For analyzing the stability of periodic solutions in GM we resort to the framework offered
by Floquet Theory. Suppose (2) has a period orbit γ(t) = γ(t + T ) with minimal period
T . Let Σ denote a suitable (N − 1)-dimensional transversal section to Γ and consider the
associated Poincaré map P : Σ → Σ. This map has a fixed point Xγ ⊂ Σ associated to
the periodic orbit γ i.e. P (Xγ ) = Xγ . Recall [8, 34] that the stability of γ is determined
by the N − 1 eigenvalues (or characteristic/Floquet multipliers) λ1 , . . . , λN −1 of the matrix
DP (Xγ ). If |λj | < 1 for all j ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1} then the periodic orbit is stable, if there
exists λj such that |λj | > 1 then the orbit is unstable and eigenvalues with |λj | = 1 signal
bifurcations under parameter variation. We can study the stability of γ by considering the
non-autonomous linear variational equation
v ′ = DF (γ(t))v =: A(t)v

(13)

where A(t) is periodic. An N × N matrix M(t) that satisfies
M ′ = A(t)M

with M(0) = Id

(14)

is called the fundamental matrix solution of (13). The constant matrix M(T ) is called the
monodromy (or circuit) matrix. It has eigenvalues
1, λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λN −1
where the trivial eigenvalue 1 is associated to the direction tangent to the periodic orbit that
links the variational equation to the Poincaré map P . Furthermore, the Liouville formula
Z T

λ1 λ2 · · · λN −1 = det M(T ) = exp
T r(A(t))dt
(15)
0

holds. Floquet’s theorem states that there exists a T -periodic coordinate change C(t) and a
constant matrix R such that
M(t) = C(t)etR .
Since M(0) = Id it follows that C(0) = C(T ) = Id and we find that the monodromy matrix
can be expressed as
M(T ) = eRT .
An elegant explicit formula for the Floquet multiplier from (15) is only available for N = 2.
In general the computation of Floquet multiplier thus requires numerical approaches, which
5

typically start with computing the periodic solution with a suitable boundary value method
such as collocation or finite differences [34, 9]. The variational equation (14) is solved on
suitable sub-intervals of the periodic orbit discretization as an initial value problem to obtain M(T ). The eigenvalues of M(T ) are then obtained yielding the Floquet multipliers.
Although, in certain circumstances, such as large multipliers, the computation can be numerically problematic [10, 37].
Let us point out that Floquet theory has not been widely applied in the context of
ecology [30] although it is a standard tool in the mathematical theory of dynamical systems
[8]. Klausmeier [30] suggests that “Floquet theory [is] a useful tool for studying the effects of
temporal variability on ecological system”. In the context of our approach, Floquet theory
is not only a tool for a particular model but we will also show that it nicely extends to
generalized models.

2.3

Fourier Series

Since we work with periodic solutions to ODEs and also other time-dependent periodic
functions we briefly recall basic facts about Fourier series to fix normalization constants and
notation. Assume that f : R → R is T -periodic so that we can identify the domain of f
as the circle R/(T Z) ∼
= S 1 . We can formally write the complex Fourier series F [f ] of f as
follows:

Observe that fˆ¯(k) = fˆ(−k), where the overbar denotes complex conjugation. Further,
RT
fˆ(0) = 1/T 0 f (t)dt is the time average of the periodic function. The convergence question
F [f ](t) → f (t) is extremely intricate depending on the properties of f [53, 28]. In the
following, all functions we are going to approximate by Fourier series will be in C r (S 1 , R)
for some sufficiently large r or even r = ∞. In this case, uniform convergence is immediate.
A very important practical result in this context is to control the Fourier coefficients.
Theorem 2.1 (see [28]). If f ∈ C r (S 1 , R) then |fˆ(k)| = O(k −r ) as |k| → ∞.
Theorem 2.1 is a version of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma for smooth functions and can
provide an extremely rapid decay of the Fourier coefficients. This justifies (for the smooth
case!) dropping higher-order terms |k| > κ for some rather small suitable κ ∈ N. The
remaining sum is expected to be a good approximation to the original periodic function f .
We write

Non-Equilibrium Planar Predator-Prey Systems

We return to the planar predator-prey system (3) from Section (2.1) given by
X ′ = S(X) − G(X, Y ),
Y ′ = G(X, Y ) − M(Y ).

(17)

Denote the vector field of (17) by F (X, Y ). The vector field is only considered on the
first (positive) quadrant F : R+ × R+ → R2 as predator-prey densities are assumed to be
non-negative.
We want to analyze the class of vector fields (17) under the assumption that it admits
a non-equilibrium orbit that is bounded as |t| → ∞. From an ecological point of view the
most interesting case are limit cycles, so-called predator-prey cycles. We assume that (17)
has a periodic orbit γ(t) = (γ1 (t), γ2 (t)) with period T . The definition of the model implies
that γi > 0 for i ∈ {1, 2} and all t.
In the following, we are going to slightly extend the notation employed already in Section
(2.1) by re-using names for variables and generalized parameters. As in the case of equilibria
one can consider a normalizing coordinate change
x :=

X
γ1

and

y :=

Y
γ2

which maps the periodic orbit to the point (x, y) = (1, 1) =: 1. The ODEs (17) and the
product rule imply
X ′ = x′ γ1 + xγ1′ = x′ γ1 + xF1 (γ) = S(xγ1 ) − G(xγ1 , yγ2),
Y ′ = y ′γ2 + yγ2′ = y ′γ2 + yF2 (γ) = G(xγ1 , yγ2) − M(yγ2 ).

Therefore the new equations can be written as
x′ =

y =

(S(xγ1 ) − G(xγ1 , yγ2) − xF1 (γ))

(G(xγ1 , yγ2) − M(yγ2 ) − yF2 (γ))
(G(xγ1 , yγ2) − M(yγ2 ) − y(G(γ) − M(γ2 ))) .

(18)

In analogy to the equilibrium case we introduce normalized functions
s(x) :=

S(xγ1 )
,
S(γ1 )

g(x) :=

G(xγ1 , yγ2)
,
G(γ1 , γ2 )

m(y) :=

M(yγ2 )
.
M(γ2 )

(19)

and define the scale parameters
βs (t) :=
β2 (t) :=

2 (t))
β1 (t) := G(γ1γ(t),γ
,
1 (t)
M (γ2 (t))
βm (t) := γ2 (t) .

S(γ1 (t))
,
γ1 (t)
G(γ1 (t),γ2 (t))
,
γ2 (t)

(20)

which are now time-dependent T -periodic scale functions. We will often suppress the timedependence in the notation and just write, for instance, βs instead of βs (t). Using (19)-(20)
in (18) we find
x′ = βs [s(x) − x] − β1 [g(x, y) − x],
(21)
y ′ = β2 [g(x, y) − y] − βm [m(y) − y].
For applying Floquet theory we linearize (21) around the limit cycle which yields the matrix


βs [(∂x s)(1) − 1] − β1 [(∂x g)(1) − 1]
−(∂y g)(1)
.
A(1; t) =
(∂x g)(1)
β2 [(∂y g)(1) − 1] − βm [(∂y m)(1) − 1]
We can re-write A(1; t) in terms of the more familiar elasticities, leading to


βs (t)[sx (t) − 1] − β1 (t)[gx (t) − 1])
−gy (t)
A(1; t) =
gx (t)
β2 (t)[gy (t) − 1] − βm (t)[my (t) − 1])
where the four time-dependent T -periodic elasticity functions are
sx (t) := (∂x s)(1),

gx (t) := (∂x g)(1),

gy (t) := (∂y g)(1),

my (t) := (∂y m)(1).

The periodicity and time-dependence becomes more apparent once we write out the detailed
definitions, for example


S(xγ1 )
γ1 S ′ (γ1 )
sx (t) = (∂x s)(1) = ∂x
|x=1 =
.
S(γ1 )
S(γ1 )
The previous calculations show that we can introduce replacements for the generalized parameters for equilibrium points in the context of periodic orbits. In particular, the scale
parameters and elasticities become time-dependent and periodic. The term “generalized
functions” is already used in a different context [51]. Therefore, we refer to elasticity functions and scale functions directly. To analyze the stability of the periodic solution we use
8

Floquet theory (see Section 2.2). For planar systems the stability of the periodic orbit is determined by computing the only non-trivial Floquet multiplier λ. Liouville’s formula implies
that
Z T

λ = exp
Tr(A(1; t))dt
0
Z T

= exp
βs (sx − 1) − β1 (gx − 1) + β2 (gy − 1) − βm (my − 1)dt .
(22)
0

We can thus express the Floquet multiplier as a function depending on elasticity and scale
functions. This is analogous to writing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian as functions of the
generalized parameters in the equilibrium case.

The Moduli Space Flow

In analogy to the generalized exploration of local dynamics, the stability of the limit cycle
can be studied by assuming plausible values for the generalized parameters (here, scale and
elasticity functions). The value of generalized models lies in their ability to cover the whole
range of possibilities that are plausible in the system. For an unbiased analysis it is essential
that we consider only those values of parameters that are consistent with the set up of the
system. For instance, in case of equilibrium generalized models we must demand that the
parameter values which we assume do not preclude the existence of an equilibrium solution in
the class of systems. Likewise, only those scale and elasticity functions should be considered
which are mutually consistent and thus could arise in at least one example system in the
class of models under consideration. To understand this problem we briefly go back to the
equilibrium scenario (see Section 2.1). Suppose we just choose a set of generalized parameters
β1 = β1∗ ,

β2 = β2∗ ,

sx = s∗x ,

gx = gx∗ ,

gy = gy∗ ,

my = m∗y ,

(23)

where we assume that all parameters are positive. One natural question is if there exist
specific functions S, G and M that lead to the generalized parameters (23).
Proposition 4.1. Suppose (23) are given positive generalized parameters. Then there exist
functions S, G, M and an equilibrium (X, Y ) = (X ∗ , Y ∗ ) for (3) so that (7) and (12) hold
i.e. there exists a differential equation of the form (3) that has the given set of generalized
parameters.
Proof. Pick M(Y ) = p1 Y my for some p1 ∈ R+ then my = ∂y (M(Y ∗ y)/M(Y ∗ ))|y=1 = m∗y .
∗
Similarly we pick S(X) = p2 X sx and obtain sx = s∗x . Using a slight modification of this
∗
∗
approach we define G(X, Y ) = X gx Y gy and get gy = gy∗ as well as gy = gy∗ . We also must
have βs = β1 = β1∗ and βm = β2 = β2∗ which translates into the conditions
∗

(C1)

p1 (X ∗ )sx −1 =

(C3)

p2 (Y ∗ )my −1 =

β1 =

β2 =

(C2)

(X ∗ )gx −1 (Y ∗ )gy ,

(C4)

(X ∗ )gx (Y ∗ )gy −1 .

We can always choose p1 and p2 to satisfy (C2) and (C4). Then we can use X ∗ and Y ∗ to
satisfy (C1) and (C3). The result follows.
9

Although there are certainly many other ways for constructing functions that are consistent with a given set of scale and elasticity parameters, already the existence of one such set
of functions proves that the assumed parameter values could be encountered in the class of
models under consideration. This observation is of central importance for sampling procedures, by which high dimensional generalized models are typically analyzed [46, 22].
For non-equilibrium systems the situation is different since one has to ask whether a
whole set of given functions
βs (t),

βm (t),

β1 (t),

β2 (t),

sx (t),

gx (t),

gy (t),

my (t),

can potentially arise from a system of the form (17).
Theorem 4.2. Suppose we are given elasticity functions sx , my , gx and gy then the scale
functions have to satisfy the following set of ODEs

β2 ((β2 − βm )gy − (β2 − βm ) + (βs − β1 )gx ).

(24)

Proof. We start by deriving the equation for βs . We know that βs = S(γ1)/γ1 and direct
differentiation with respect to time via the quotient and chain rules gives
γ1 γ1′ S ′ (γ1 ) − S(γ1)γ1′

The calculation for β2′ is similar to the one for β1′ .
The main conclusion is that the elasticities and scale functions which parametrize the
ODE (21) satisfy an ODE themselves. Because one often uses the terms “parameters” and
“moduli” interchangeably, Theorem 4.2 implies that the time-dependent parameters of generalized models generate a flow on moduli space. The following remark describes the relevance
of this viewpoint in some other research areas.
Remark: The term ”moduli space” is perhaps most commonly used in algebraic geometry which, broadly speaking, is the study of solutions of algebraic equations [24, 25]. The
solutions form algebraic varieties (e.g. curves). Often suitable parametrized families of algebraic varieties again have the structure of an algebraic variety, where the latter object is
the moduli space of parametrized families. The study of the geometry of moduli spaces has
also been transported into different branches of physics such as quantum field theory [1]. In
dynamical systems theory, a classical moduli space argument is made in the renormalization analysis of parametrized families one-dimensional maps [23], where the renormalization
transformation can be viewed as a map generating a dynamical system on moduli space. A
very similar situation occurs for billiard dynamics where the so-called Teichmüller flow on
the space of lattices appears [44, 38].
We note that the positive quadrant is an invariant set for (24) which means that this
property lifts from the predator-prey family of vector fields to the moduli space. From
Theorem 4.2 we can immediately infer a condition for the existence of a generalized model
with given elasticities.
Corollary 4.3. Suppose sx , my , gx and gy are given T -periodic elasticity functions with
minimal period T . If (24) has no T -periodic solutions then there exists no generalized model
of the form (17) for the given elasticities.
Note that the existence of periodic solutions in Corollary 4.3 is only a necessary condition
for the existence of a generalized model. We also observe that for the equilibrium case the
′
conditions β1 = βs and β2 = βm give βs′ = βm
= β1′ = β2′ = 0 consistent with steady state
generalized modeling. It is also interesting to ask what happens if we do not specify the
elasticities.
Taking the idea of deriving a differential equation one step further we consider
sx =

γ1 S ′ (γ1 )
S(γ1 )

⇒ s′x =

S(γ1 )[γ1′ S ′ (γ1 ) + γ1 γ1′ S ′′ (γ1)] − γ1 S ′ (γ1 )γ1′ S ′ (γ1 )
S(γ1 )2

Applying similar substitutions as in the proof of Theorem 4.2 we obtain
S(γ1 )[γ1′ S ′ (γ1 ) + γ1 γ1′ S ′′ (γ1 )] − γ1 S ′ (γ1 )γ1′ S ′ (γ1)

Similar calculations can be carried out for gx′ , gy′ and m′y . These suggest that specifying a
suitable scaled version of second partial derivatives of S, G and M will provide a system of
eight ODEs. This procedure could be continued iteratively. It is interesting to note that
closing a system of ODEs at a given order is a problem that also occurs in the context of
moment closure for networks [29, 16] and for moment equations of stochastic differential
equations [45, 11]. To get a better understanding of the stability of non-equilibrium generalized models and the flow on moduli space we proceed to consider a few typical specific
functions S, G and M that appear in predator-prey models.

Specific Functions

In this section we calculate the generalized elasticity and scale functions for several wellknown predator-prey models. All the model parameters kl (for l ∈ N) we are going to use
below are positive due to modeling considerations. We start with the growth of the prey
S(X). Typical choices are

We start by looking at linear growth. We find

For estimating the impact of linear growth on stability we consider the formula (22) and
view it as a product of exponentials. The term involving βs and sx is
Z T

exp
βs [sx − 1]dt .
(26)
0

Therefore, a linear prey growth
does not contribute to the non-trivial Floquet multiplier
RT
because sx = 1 and exp( 0 0dt) = 1. Different types of polynomial growth with a single
term can be treated analogously since for S(X) = k1 X p we find

where the elasticity function coincides with the result for equilibrium generalized models.
This allows us to write
βs [sx − 1] = k1 γ1p−1[p − 1].

Considering (26) we find that increasing p increases the Floquet multiplier and therefore
has always a destabilizing effect, whereas decreasing p has a stabilizing effect. For logistic
growth we obtain

where
the integral is positive because k2 > 0. This means that increasing k2 or increasing

γ1 dt will promote stability as the Floquet multiplier will move closer to 0. For logistic
0
growth increasing k2 corresponds to decreasing the carrying capacity k1 /k2 of the population.
This can be interpreted as a manifestation of the paradox of enrichment [43, 17] which
captures the observation that increasing the carrying capacity generally has a destabilizing
effect on attractors observed in ecological models. Furthermore, the expression obtained
for logistic grows permits discussion of the contribution of the shape of the limit cycle to
stability. For t ∈ [δ1 , T − δ2 ], where δ1,2 > 0 are small, we find that
0 < γ1 (t) ≪ 1

(28)

RT
which implies that the integral 0 γ1 (t)dt is small as well. Therefore limit cycles where the
number of prey is extremely small for long times are not expected to be a basis for a stable
ecosystem. For the Allee effect we find

Increasing k2 and/or k3 will decrease stability. This is natural as these parameters represent
the threshold to growth and the carrying capacity, providing another example for the paradox
of enrichment.
Note that the shape of the limit cycle can influence stability. In particular, the same
conclusion to assumption (28) holds. In the case of the Allee effect the de-stabilization effect
RT
for long periods of low prey density even enters quadratically in the term 0 k1 2γ12 dt. This
confirms the intuitive conclusion that imposing a threshold to growth is a de-stabilizing
factor for non-equilibrium systems when the prey density is small.
We proceed to consider the mortality of the predator. A very common functional form
used in a large number of models is so-called density independent (linear) mortality

Table 1: Calculation of the scale and elasticity functions for the predation term G(X, Y ).
The top panel lists four typical functional forms. In the bottom panel we calculate the terms
occurring in the Floquet multiplier (22).
Therefore, linear predator mortality has no effect on the stability of the periodic solution.
The interaction term between prey and predator is usually the most complicated and
debated choice for the model. Some common choices are considered in Table 1. The observation that β2 [gy − 1] vanishes for all functions considered in Table 1, can be directly
linked to the ecological assumption that predators hunt independently of each other. The
functions that are therefore used in practice are generally linear in the density of predators
and the impact of predator dependence on stability vanishes. The same assumption cannot
generally be made for prey dependence of predation, leading to more complex expressions
for the impact on stability.
Therefore, we are going to make the assumptions
gy = 1

and

my = 1

from now. Regarding the Floquet multiplier formula (22) the assumptions (30) simplify the
situation to investigating

Example 5.1. For gaining an intuitive understanding one can consider the flow on the

interaction and linear predator mortality gives us the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey

(34)

Figure 1 shows that integrating a slightly perturbed initial condition trajectory does seem
to diverge from the exact periodic solution in moduli space. Furthermore, even for a classical planar predator-prey system, the scale and elasticity functions are quite complicated
for non-equilibrium solutions. In fact, prescribing the elasticities is much more difficult than
just picking a set of fixed parameters for equilibrium generalized models.
To verify the necessary condition from Corollary 4.3 for periodic solutions we must ask
for solvability of the boundary value problem (BVP)

where β(t) := (βs (t), β1 (t), β2 (t)). It is well-known that BVPs can have one, many or no
solutions [2]. Furthermore determining solvability conditions is usually not easy and even
using numerical methods may be dangerous; for example, if a numerical algorithm fails to
provide a solution to (35) this may just be due to the numerical problems that can arise
when solving BVPs [2].

Fourier Decomposition

The previous discussion of specific functions and the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model motivate
the need for a more concrete version of the moduli space conditions (35) and of the Floquet
multiplier (31). The natural step is to use a decomposition of the periodic functions into
Fourier series; see Section 2.3. Using discrete convolution we can easily re-write the problem
(35) on moduli space.
Proposition 6.1. Suppose we are given T -periodic elasticity functions sx , my , gx and gy .
Then the Fourier coefficients of periodic scale functions have to satisfy the following set of
algebraic equations

[β̂2 ∗ ((β̂s − β̂1 ) ∗ ĝx + (β̂2 − β̂m ) ∗ gy − (β̂2 − β̂m ))](k),

(36)

for all k ∈ Z where we have also used the notation 1̂(0) = 1 and 1̂(k) = 0 for k 6= 0 and
employed the obvious definition for addition of infinite sequences.

This formula for Fourier coefficients of products of functions yields the right-hand side of
equation (36) as a direct consequence of Theorem 4.2. The left-hand side of equation (36) follows from direct differentiation which is allowed since all our periodic functions are assumed
to be sufficiently smooth; see Section 2.3.

stable periodic orbit γ(t) of (33); the parameters are given in (34). The coefficients of the
phase space coordinates as well as the generalized elasticity and scale functions are shown.
Since (36) is an infinite set of algebraic equations it may look like we have not considerably simplified the problem of finding scale functions that are consistent with prescribed
elasticities. However, the rapid decay of Fourier coefficients provided by Theorem 2.1 allows us to approximate the solution of (36) by focusing on the first few harmonics with
|k| ≤ κ ≪ ∞.
Example 6.2 (Example 5.1 continued). Just for illustration purposes we look a the Fourier
coefficients of generalized scale and elasticity functions in an example. Figure 2 shows the
results for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model from Section 5 with κ = 4. We can clearly see
that the Fourier coefficients decay very rapidly; it is also interesting to observe that ŝx (k) is
bimodal for logistic growth whereas the other coefficients show a uni-modal distribution for
the first few harmonics. For the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model the algebraic relations (36)

The black coefficients (lines shifted slightly left) are the coefficients of the derivatives βs′ , β1′
and β2′ and the green coefficients (lines shifted slightly right) are associated to the periodic
functions on the right-hand side of (37). The agreement of the two sets of coefficients is
clearly visible.
Figure 3 shows the values of the Fourier coefficients for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur example where we see that the algebraic conditions (37) are satisfied as proven in Proposition
6.1. Furthermore, it is evident that due to the convolution a wider support κM is necessary
i.e. the algebraic equations (36) must be satisfied for |k| ≤ κM where κM > κ and κ is our
truncation for the Fourier coefficients of the phase space periodic orbit.

Stability Analysis

To get a better understanding of stability we can also use the Fourier series approach to
re-express the Floquet multiplier (31) given by
Z T

λ = exp
βs (sx − 1) − β1 (gx − 1) + β2 (gy − 1) − βm (my − 1)dt .

The next results shows how the different Fourier coefficients enter in formula (38).
Theorem 7.1. For the non-equilibrium generalized predator-prey model with gy = 1 = my
the single Floquet multiplier of a T -periodic orbit is given by
 

λ = exp T [β̂s ∗ (ŝx − 1̂)](0) − [β̂1 ∗ (ĝx − 1̂)](0) = exp(T (C1 − C2 ))

i.e. whether |λ| > 1 or |λ| < 1 depends only on the difference of two zeroth-order Fourier
coefficients C1 and C2 that arise from two discrete convolutions.

where the last step follows from the fact that 0 e2πikt/T dt = 0 for k 6= 0. From this
calculation we find C1 and in a similar way also C2 . Using the two factors C1,2 and my =
1 = gx in (38) the result (39) follows. Since T > 0 the modulus |λ| only depends on the
difference of C1 and C2 ; if C1 − C2 > 0 then |λ| > 1 and if C1 − C2 < 0 we obtain |λ| < 1.
Before we consider in more detail the dependency of stability on C1 and C2 we briefly
investigate the influence of the period T . Although T does not effect the stability of a periodic
orbit directly it does have an interesting biological interpretation. If T ≫ 1 then the period
amplifies stability and instability. For example, when C1 − C2 > 0 then a long period moves
the multiplier even further away from |λ| = 1 and trajectories near the unstable periodic
orbit will escape vary quickly. On the other hand, if C1 − C2 < 0 and |λ| < 1 then a very
large period T moves the multiplier even closer to the super-attracting case 0 ≤ |λ| ≪ 1. A
very short period 0 < T ≪ 1 has the effect of moving the multiplier very close to |λ| ≈ 1.
This means that when the periodic orbit is unstable, it will take a very long time to escape
from it. The last effect can be interpreted as inducing meta-stability i.e. when the period of
the predator-prey cycle is short then the predator-prey system stays near a metastable state
for a long time although it is eventually unstable. This could lead to the conjecture that
fast oscillations could be beneficial to survival for predator-prey populations during periods
when external parameters entering C1 and C2 drive the system, potentially only temporarily,
to a state when |λ| > 1.
As a next step, we want to understand better how the Fourier coefficients of βs , β1 , sx
and gx influence C1 and C2 .

fˆ(k)ĝ(k) + fˆ(k)ĝ(k) = 2(Re[fˆ(k)]Re[ĝ(k)] + Im[fˆ(k)]Im[ĝ(k)]).
Now the formulas (40)-(41) follow immediately as βs (t), β1 (t), sx (t) and gx (t) are all realvalued.
In practice, we never use the infinite sum formulas from Proposition 7.2 but truncate
them at a finite order. Using the explicit formulas for C1 and C2 we can directly draw
several conclusions regarding periodic solutions depending on generalized scale and elasticity
functions (recall: we still use gy = 1 = my ). If all Fourier coefficients of higher-order k ≥ 1
are small, then stability of periodic solutions is dominated by the terms
C1 ≈ β̂s (0)(ŝx (0) − 1)

and

C2 ≈ β̂1 (0)(ĝx (0) − 1).

Since the scale functions are always positive the time averages of the elasticity functions
ŝx (0) and ĝx (0) determine the signs of C1 and C2 . Therefore, average sub-linear elasticity
ŝx (0) < 1 and average super-linear conversion ĝx (0) > 1 enhance stability. In ecological
terms 0 ≤ ŝx (0) < 1 means that, on average, the prey growth should be limited by external
factors and ŝx (0) > 1 means that, on average, the predation rate should be sensitive to
prey abundance; see also [21] for an interpretation of the generalized parameters for the
equilibrium case. Both conditions make intuitive sense: if the prey grows without external
limitation then solutions may be expected to diverge from a periodic solution and become
unbounded while insensitivity of predation to prey growth could potentially drive a system to
extinction. Of course, also the inverse relationships hold so that ŝx (0) > 1 and ĝx (0) < 1 act
towards de-stabilization. In this context, the scale functions act as amplifiers. For example,
if C1 < 0 and C2 > 0 then a large average growth rate β̂s (0) ≫ 1 and a large conversion rate
β̂1 (0) ≫ 1 will enhance stability even more since the Floquet multiplier moves closer to the
super-attracting regime λ ≈ 0. In this case, initial conditions will be attracted much quicker
to a stable limit cycle. If
β̂s (0)(ŝx (0) − 1) − β̂1 (0)(ĝx (0) − 1) ≈ 0

i.e. β̂s (0)(ŝx (0) − 1) ≈ β̂1 (0)(ĝx (0) − 1)

the leading-order terms between growth and predation balance and the stability properties
are dominated by higher-order harmonics. The leading-order terms also become irrelevant

Figure 4: Illustration how the location of Fourier coefficients for generalized elasticity and
scale functions influence stability. Here we focus on the first two higher-order harmonics
(first coefficient = solid line, second coefficient = dashed line) of βs (t) (red) and sx (t) (blue)
which influence the term C1 in Theorem 7.1. (a) π-phase shift gives C1 < 0. (b) Small phase

for elasticity functions which average close to one
ŝx (0) ≈ 1

and

ĝx (0) ≈ 1.

In this scenario we have to focus on the relations between the higher-order Fourier coefficients of βs and sx as well as β1 and gx . Let us assume for simplicity that ŝx (0) = 1 = ĝx (0)
so that we can focus on the higher harmonics. Then stability enhancing conditions are
C1 =

(Re[β̂s (k)]Re[ŝx (k)] + Im[β̂s (k)]Im[ŝx (k)]) < 0,

Figure 4 depicts several different situations in the complex plane for the first two higher-order
harmonics of β̂s (k) and ŝx (k) (k = 1, 2). In Figure 4(a) the first two higher-harmonics are
in “anti-phase” so that the angles between the coefficients are separated by π. This means
that
Re[β̂s (k)]Re[ŝx (k)] < 0 and Im[β̂s (k)]Im[ŝx (k)] < 0
for k = 1, 2. In such a situation, we expect that C1 < 0 by disregarding higher orders so
that stability is enhanced.
Figure 4(b) shows the situation where there is only a small phase difference between the
coefficients (“in-phase”) which gives
Re[β̂s (k)]Re[ŝx (k)] > 0 and Im[β̂s (k)]Im[ŝx (k)] > 0.
There is also a possible situation where a competition between the different order harmonics
arises as illustrated in Figure 4(c). We can now also give an ecological interpretation of these
21

conditions. Stability C1 < 0 is enhanced if sx (t) and βs (t) oscillate with a phase separation
near π which means that a period of high sensitivity of prey abundance should coincide with
a period of low prey growth and vice versa. Note that these conditions also make sense
intuitively and suggest that prey growth is most efficient if there is a small number of prey
and there are no limiting factors from the environment. Similar considerations also apply to
the stability enhancing condition C2 > 0. A small phase separation between β1 (t) and gx (t)
increases stability of the predator-prey limit cycle. Observe that gx (t) can be interpreted as
the dependence of predation on prey abundance and β1 (t) as a predation rate (normalized
by the total number of prey) [21]; the stability conditions mean that a high predation rate
should coincide with a high dependence of predation on prey abundance. In other words,
if the dominating factor to prey abundance is predation then it is good for the predator to
hunt a lot to increase stability of the limit cycle.
Note that although the conclusions stated above seem to be “obvious” in an ecological
context, it is by no means clear how to prove them. That they can be obtained by an analysis
of nonlocal generalized models underlines the applicability of the approach.

Sampling

Recall that due to Proposition 4.1 it was straightforward for equilibrium generalized models
to choose a set of generalized parameters, just random sampling produces a set of parameters
that is consistent with at least one specific model. Random sampling of generalized parameters has been exploited to correlate different aspects of the dynamical system to stability
[42, 46]. For non-equilibrium systems we must certainly check the necessary condition from
Corollary 4.3. One possibility is the following algorithm which allows sampling of elasticity
and scale functions:
(A1) Prescribe a set of T -periodic elasticity functions by their Fourier coefficients. For
simplicity we will always choose T = 1 and assume gy = 1 = my .
(A2) Choose a truncation order κM for the algebraic system (37) so that the necessary
condition reads
0 = −2πik β̂s (k) + [β̂s ∗ (β̂s − β̂1 ) ∗ (ŝx − 1̂)](k)
=: cs (k),
0 = −2πik β̂1 (k) + [β̂1 ∗ ((β̂s − β̂1 ) ∗ ĝx + (β̂2 − β̂m ) − (β̂s − β̂1 ))](k) =: c1 (k),
0 = −2πik β̂2 (k) + [β̂2 ∗ ((β̂s − β̂1 ) ∗ ĝx )](k)
=: c2 (k),
for |k| ≤ κM .
(A3) Define a new variable that collects all the Fourier coefficient values for βs , β1 , β2 , βm ,
sx and gx
X := (β̂s (0), β̂s (1), . . . , β̂s (κm ), β̂1 (0), . . . , β̂1 (κm ), . . .) ∈ C6(κM +1) ∼
= R12(κM +1)
where x contains all the information about the scale and elasticity functions since the
negative index coefficients can be obtained by complex conjugation.
22

(A4) Define a function
F (X) := kRe(cs )k2 + kRe(c1 )k2 + kRe(c2 )k2 + kIm(cs )k2 + kIm(c1 )k2 + kIm(c2 )k2
where we view cs , c1 and c2 as vectors of dimension 2κM + 1 and real and imaginary
parts are applied component-wise.
(A5) Observe that F (X0 ) = 0 if and only if the Fourier coefficients encoded in X0 satisfy
the algebraic equations in (A2). Therefore we can attempt to solve the following
optimization problem
Xm := min{F (X) : X ∈ R12(κM +1) }

(42)

with a random initial condition, say x = xl .
Solving the optimization problem for different random initial conditions is expected to
yield different values for Xm that solve the algebraic constraint in (A2). This means that we
get a set of Fourier coefficients {Xm (l)}Ll=1 where L denotes the sample size and the index
l ∈ N indicates the dependence on the initial condition.
The main technical difficulty of the algorithm (A1)-(A5) is that it involves the solution
of the optimization problem (42). This is computationally much more expensive than the
direct random sampling for equilibrium generalized models. It is known [41] that the main
computational cost in optimization is often given by the difficulty of the function evaluations
of F (x). For our case, this seems to be the case since we have to compute several discrete
convolutions to evaluate F (x). However, the convolution computation is inexpensive due to
the Fast Fourier Transform [31].
Now we want to demonstrate that the algorithm can be used for a sampling analysis of
stability similar to the one used in [22]. Let us point out that we do not attempt a full
detailed statistical analysis here but that we only aim at a proof-of-principle. We solved
(42) for 110000 initial conditions for κM = 2 using a standard algorithm for nonlinear
optimization [39, 35]. Each sequence of Fourier coefficients in the initial condition consists
of five real numbers e.g.
β̂s (0), Re(β̂s (1)), Im(β̂s (1)), Re(β̂s (2)), Im(β̂s (2)),

(43)

which were sampled uniformly and independently from the interval [0.5, 1.5]. We discarded
all solutions of the optimization algorithm that did not satisfy the positivity condition
β̂s (0) > 0, β̂1 (0) > 0, β̂2 (0) > 0, β̂m (0) > 0.
which is required by the definition of the scale functions and the invariance of the positive
quadrant for the moduli space flow. The 63587 remaining solutions xm (l) satisfied the the
optimization problem (and therefore the moduli space flow) at least up to a tolerance of
10−4 i.e. |xm (l)| < 10−4 for all l; the average value was E[xm (l)] ≈ 1.73 · 10−6 . We have also
calculated the single Floquet multiplier λl associated to each solution using Proposition 7.2.

Figure 5: Histogram of the 5·63587 Fourier coefficients for βs obtained from the optimization
of (42) with uniformly sampled initial conditions (43). The columns show the five different
real numbers with their observed number on the vertical axes. The first row shows coefficients
associated to a stable Floquet multiplier and the second row those with an unstable Floquet
multiplier. Observe that the number of stable coefficients is substantially larger than the
number of unstable ones.
Figure 5 shows some of the output of the computation. We plot the Fourier coefficients
associated to the scale function βs . The top row in Figure 5 corresponds to coefficients with
stable periodic orbit (|λ| < 1) and the bottom row to coefficients with an unstable periodic
orbit (|λ| > 1). We see that, despite the initial uniform sampling, the results for each
coefficient of βs closely resemble normal distributions. The same observation also applies for
the other scale and elasticity functions. In total we find that 37873 solutions associated to a
stable multiplier and 25714 unstable ones. From this discrepancy one may either conjecture
that the moduli space flow constraint could bias ecosystem towards stability or that our
choice of initial uniform random sampling over a particular region in parameter space causes
the bias towards stability.
In Table 2 we list mean and variance for each coefficient. Several observations can be
made based on Table 2. The scale functions β2 and βm have a much bigger variance than
βs and β1 . This could indicate that the prey growth rate and the prey-per-capita predation
rate have to obey much smaller ranges in ecosystems compared to the predator-per-capita
rates describing consumption and mortality. It is also interesting that the mortality rate
βm allows for much larger amplitude higher-order harmonics whereas e.g. |β̂s (2)| is always
comparatively small. The elasticities show no consistent variance decay towards higherorder harmonics although the coefficients themselves seem to decay. From the ecological
perspective this suggest that predator-prey systems may exhibit a wide diversity in terms of
sensitivities sx and gx .

Table 2: Mean and variance for the Fourier coefficients obtained from optimization (solution
of the moduli space flow). Coefficients associated to stable and unstable Floquet multipliers
are considered separately.

To understand how the different coefficients relate to stability we calculate the Pearson
correlation coefficient. For two vectors of observations {al } and {bl } it is defined as

(al − E[a])(bl − E[b])
r(a, b) := pP l

Figure 6 shows r(a, λl ) where a is a sequence of real or imaginary parts of the Fourier
coefficients e.g. {al } = {Re(β̂s,l (k))}. One important conclusion to draw from the correlation
coefficients is that although a Fourier coefficient does not appear in the stability formula
for the Floquet multiplier it may still correlate positively or negatively with stability. For
example, β̂2 (1) and β̂2 (2) show a negative correlation with Floquet multiplier. This effect
can be caused by the fact that the scale and elasticity functions are not independent i.e.
they are related via the moduli space flow.
It is very important to observe that we can recover conclusions, which we found already
analytically in Section 7, from the statistical analysis. For example, the coefficient ĝx (0)
correlates negatively with stability which means that decreasing it increases the Floquet

obtained analytically in Section 7. Let us point out again that the basic statistical analysis
we have provided is incomplete but that it definitely does show that the proposed sampling
techniques based on the FFT, optimization and correlations can help to understand stability
of periodic solutions.

Outlook

In this paper we have extended the method of generalized modeling from equilibrium to
non-equilibrium systems. This extension has been achieved in the context of a classical
predator-prey system with periodic solutions. The main re-scalings and definitions from the
equilibrium case can be carried over to periodic orbits. However, the resulting generalized
ODEs differ from the steady state case in several respects. The algebraic form is different
due to the time dependent re-scalings and also the generalized parameters become timedependent elasticity and scale functions. The Jacobian A(t) of the system has to be analyzed
using Floquet theory that describes the stability of periodic orbits. For planar vector fields
we have been able to use Liouville’s formula
Z T

λ = exp
T r(A(t))dt
0

which facilitated several analytical calculations. We have discovered that the generalized
elasticity and scale functions have to satisfy a flow moduli space. Then we used Fourier
26

analysis to find computable conditions from the moduli flow. Discrete convolutions turned
out to be the key to stability analysis providing explicit interpretable stability results. In the
last part of the paper, we suggested a sampling algorithm that uses optimization methods to
find elasticity and scale functions that satisfy the (algebraic) moduli space flow. During our
analysis we have also obtained several ecological conclusions about arbitrary predator-prey
models that can be written in the generalized form (3).
In principle, we can extend the theory described here without any technical problems
to limit cycles in N-dimensional systems for N > 2; see also [33] regarding generalizations
to RN in the equilibrium context. The main difference in RN will be that we have to
compute several the Floquet multipliers numerically since Liouville’s formula only provides
the product of the eigenvalues.
One can also consider a generalization to non-equilibrium system beyond periodic orbits.
For example, the generalized model (21), as well as Theorem 4.2 on the moduli space flow,
carry over directly to other situations such as homoclinic trajectories [34] or chaotic dynamics
[23]. For instance, instead of posing periodic boundary conditions of the form
β1 (0) = β1 (T ),

β2 (0) = β2 (T ),

...

we have to impose other conditions on the solution of the moduli space flow. For homoclinic
orbits we need the boundary conditions
β1 (−∞) = β1∗ = β1 (∞),

β2 (−∞) = β2∗ = β2 (∞),

...

i.e. that we have asymptotic limits of the generalized elasticity and scale functions to their
value at a saddle-point equilibrium. For chaotic dynamics one must search for aperiodic
bounded trajectories in moduli space. Note that this raises interesting mathematical as well
as application questions. For example, the moduli space flow may provide new insights when
a dynamical system may be chaotic. Finally, also our sampling analysis can obviously be extended. Beyond a more detailed statistical validation, we could consider higher-dimensional
food webs [22] which leads to a problem in RN .
