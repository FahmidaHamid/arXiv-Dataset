Abstract
Understanding the architectural subtleties of ecological networks, believed to confer them enhanced stability and robustness, is a subject of outmost relevance. Mutualistic interactions have been profusely studied and their corresponding bipartite
networks, such as plant-pollinator networks, have been reported to exhibit a characteristic “nested” structure. Assessing the importance of any given species in mutualistic
networks is a key task when evaluating extinction risks and possible cascade effects.
Inspired in a recently introduced algorithm –similar in spirit to Google’s PageRank
but with a built-in non-linearity– here we propose a method which –by exploiting their
nested architecture– allows us to derive a sound ranking of species importance in mutualistic networks. This method clearly outperforms other existing ranking schemes
and can become very useful for ecosystem management and biodiversity preservation,
where decisions on what aspects of ecosystems to explicitly protect need to be made.

Introduction
Assessing the stability and robustness of complex ecosystems is a fundamental problem
in conservation ecology [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The loss of an individual “keystone” species can
induce cascade effects –i.e. a series of secondary extinctions triggered by the primary one–
propagating the damage through the network. Thus, the relative “importance” of a given
species within a ecological network could be gauged as a function of the eventual size of
the cascade of extinctions its loss would potentially cause. A successful ranking of species
importance should rank first those species that trigger larger extinction cascades.
In the context of food webs, species rankings have been long sought (see e.g. [6, 7]). For
example, Allesina and Pascual [8] successfully applied the Google’s PageRank algorithm
[9] to order species within food webs, much as Google ranks webpages.
Mutualistic ecological communities such as those formed by plants and their pollinators, plant seeds and their dispersers, or anemone and the fishes that inhabit them, etc.
constitute another broadly studied set of ecological networks. These comprise two different sets of living beings that benefit from each other and as such can be represented in
terms of bipartite networks [10]. Mutualistic networks turn out to have a very particular
“nested” architecture [11, 12, 13] in which specialist species –interacting with only a few
mutualistic partners– tend to be connected with generalists (Figure 1). Such a nested
design is believed to confer robustness against species loss and other systemic damages,
thus fostering biodiversity [14, 15].

For simplicity, we focus on binary networks: blue squares correspond to existing interactions while empty ones describe absent links. A perfectly nested network (A) shows a
characteristic interaction matrix in which specialist species –with low connectivity– interact only with generalist ones. The matrix in (B) has a lesser degree of nestedness (see
[16, 13] and [17] for quantification of nestedness).

Determining a ranking of species importance in mutualistic communities poses an
important practical challenge, as it would be highly desirable to know which species are
more crucial for the long-term stability of the community. The goal would be to establish
a proper ordering of species, ranking them in order of decreasing importance for the
community. This would facilitate the design of sound conservation policies protecting the
most important species.
Following the experience from food webs we could, in principle, employ the PageRank
algorithm to rank mutualistic species in bipartite networks. PageRank [9, 8] is a linearalgebra iterative algorithm which, in a nutshell, computes the “importance” of a given
node as the linear superposition of the importance of the nodes connecting to it, in a
recursive and self-consistent way. However, in this work, taking inspiration from a recent
breakthrough on economics/econometrics [18, 19], we propose to employ a novel nonlinear algorithm specially designed for bipartite networks.
Tacchella et al. [18, 19] analyzed economic data from the world trade network (i.e.
the bipartite network of countries and the products they export). The goal was to infer
an objective ranking of countries in terms of their “fitness” and a classification of the
products in terms of increasing “complexity”. Inspection of such economic data reveals
that rich (high fitness) countries are not specialized into producing complex products
(such as high-tech devices) exclusively. Rather, they export a highly diversified variety of
goods, including less-complex ones (e.g. cereals). On the other hand, poor (low fitness)
countries only produce low-complexity merchandises. These facts are reflected in the
nested structure of the corresponding bipartite network [18, 19], with a shape similar to
that in Figure 1. The main idea behind the novel algorithm of Tacchella et. al. is that
while the fitness of a country can be safely defined as the linear average of the complexity
of the products it exports, the reverse does not make sense. Indeed, the complexity of
a given product cannot be meaningfully estimated as the average fitness of the countries
producing it, but is much better characterized by the minimal fitness required to produce
it [18]. To implement this idea Tacchella et al. proposed an iterative non-linear algorithm
(see below) and were able to compute the fitness of all countries and the complexity of
all products in a self-consistent way, using solely information contained in the matrix of
2

economic transactions. The novel algorithm clearly outperforms PageRank and leads to
striking implications for understanding the global trade market [18, 19].
Here, we consider a set of 63 real mutualistic networks –all of them with a characteristic
nested structure– taken from the literature (45 pollination networks, 16 frugivore seeddispersal, and 2 other networks; see Table 1) and rank the species accordingly to different
criteria (such as node-connectivity, betweenness centrality, PageRank, etc.) including the
novel non-linear algorithm. Each of the employed criteria leads to a different ranking of
species. We analyze the quality of any of these orderings by monitoring how fast the
network collapses if species are sequentially removed in order of decreasing ranking. The
best ranking is the one for which the network breaks down more rapidly. Our conclusion
is that the non-linear algorithm clearly outperforms all others, thus providing us with an
efficient and powerful scheme to gauge the relative importance of species in mutualistic
communities.

Results
The non-linear ranking algorithm for mutualistic networks
Inspired by the work of Tacchella et. al., [18, 19] we propose a novel ranking algorithm for
mutualistic networks of ecological relevance. We shall refer to it as mutualistic species rank
(MusRank). To establish a common terminology for plant-pollinator, seed-disperser, and
anemone-fish networks, we refer to plants, seeds and anemones as “passive” (P) elements,
while pollinators, dispersers, and fishes are their “active” (A) partners; rather than fitness
and complexity now we use the terms importance and vulnerability, for the two emerging
species rankings, respectively. It is natural to identify products with passive components
and countries with active ones (but the opposite identification can also be made; see
below). We assume that the importance of an active species, is determined by the number
of its mutualistic passive partners, each one weighted with its own vulnerability: the more
partners and the more vulnerable they are, the more important an active element is.
On the other hand, the vulnerability of a passive element will be bounded by the
less important species it interacts with. The rationale behind this is that, given that
mutualistic networks are nested, specialized species tend to interact with generalists. If a
passive element interacts only with generalists it is most certainly a specialist and therefore
highly vulnerable as it can disappear if a few generalists go extinct.
The non-linear algorithm, encoding these ideas, is summarized in eq.1. The importance
of active elements, IA=1,...,Amax , and the vulnerability of passive ones, VP =1,...,Pmax , are
computed at iteration n as a function of their values in iteration n−1 using the interaction
(or adjacency) matrix MAP as the only input:

Here, as in the work by Tacchella et al., the adjacency matrix is considered to take binary
values, but generalization to allow for real values is straightforward. In a first step (left),

3

intermediate values of the importance and vulnerability are calculated for each species:
the first as the average of vulnerabilities of its partners and the second as the inverse of
the average of its partners inverse importances [18]. In a second step (right), both values
are normalized to their mean values. In this way, starting from arbitrary initial conditions
(e.g. IA (0) = 1 for all A and VP (0) = 1, for all P ) the two-step transformation above is
iterated until a fixed point is reached (let us remark that we make no attempt here to prove
that such a fixed point actually exists nor to investigate the conditions for the convergence
of the method; see [20]). Such a fixed point –which does not depend on initial conditions–
defines the output of the algorithm: a ranking of importances and vulnerabilities for active
and passive species, respectively.

Assessing the quality of a given ranking
In order to evaluate the quality of any possible ranking of species for a given mutualistic
network we proceed by computationally implementing the following protocol (see Figure
2 A). Active species are removed progressively following the ordering prescribed by any
specified ranking algorithm. The ranking is kept fixed along this process, i.e. no reevaluations of the ranking are performed once species are removed. Secondary extinctions
are monitored (a species is declared extinct when it no longer has any mutualistic partners
to interact with). The process is iterated until all the species in the network have gone
extinct. The total fraction of extinct species as a function of the number of deleted species
defines a extinction curve [8]. For each possible sequence of eradications the extinction area
is obtained as the integral of the extinction curve (see Figure 2 B). This procedure allows
for a quantitative discrimination of species rankings: the best possible ordering of species
would be the one for which the largest extinction area is obtained upon progressively
removing active species in order of decreasing rank.
An exhaustive search of the optimal ranking (in the space of all possible orderings)
can be performed for relatively small networks but becomes an unfeasible task for larger
ones. To have an estimation of the optimal ranking we implemented a genetic algorithm
(GA) (see Methods) devised to obtain the maximal possible extinction area by searching
in the space of all possible orderings. For some of the largest networks we studied (in
particular, for Montane forest and grassland, Beech forest and Phryganic ecosystem with
275, 678, and 666 active nodes respectively; see table) the computational time required
for the genetic algorithm to converge is exceedingly large and satisfactory results were not
found.
Let us finally mention that we have also implemented a slightly modified version of
the extinction protocol in which the ranking is re-evaluated after each species extinction.
Beside being computationally much more expensive, this modified protocol leads, in general, to slightly worse results than the original one; however, even in this form MusRank
outperforms all other rankings.

Algorithm testing and comparison with other rankings
We compared different rankings based on (see Methods) : a) decreasing closeness centrality (CLOS), b) decreasing eigenvector centrality (EIG), c) decreasing betweenness
centrality (BTW), d) decreasing degree centrality (DEG), e) increasing contribution to
nestedness (NES) as described in [16], f) decreasing PageRank (PAGE), and g) decreasing importance as measured by MusRank (MUS).

Figure 2: Left: schematic representation of the extinction protocol for an empirical mutualistic network (Arctic community [21]) with 18 active (pollinators) and 11 passive (plants)
species). Both active (left) and passive (right) species are ordered following some prescribed ranking; from the highest ranked species (top) to the lower-ranked ones (bottom).
The (blue and red) lines represent mutualistic interactions as encoded in the interaction (or
adjacency) matrix. Active species are progressively removed from the community, their
corresponding (red) links are erased, and passive species are declared extinct whenever
they lose all their connections. Right: extinction curve, showing the fraction of extinct
passive species as a function of the number of sequentially removed active ones for a given
specified ranking. The shaded region is the extinction area for the ranking under consideration. Different rankings lead to different extinction areas. The larger the area the better
the ranking.

The average extinction area of the different algorithms was obtained for all networks
in the dataset. In the frequent case in which the order is degenerate (more than one node
were rated with the same value), we considered 103 different randomizations and computed
the averaged extinction area.
For the sake of completeness we have also repeated all the protocol above, but exchanging in Eq.(1) the roles of active and passive species, i.e. assigning importances to
passive species and vulnerabilities to active ones. We refer to this as “reversed” algorithm.
We have also studied extinction areas by progressively removing passive species (rather
than active ones) and monitoring secondary extinctions of active species.

Computational results
Figure 3 illustrates the performance of the different rankings/algorithms for three different
instances of mutualistic networks. Extinction areas are plotted for each of the considered
ranking algorithms. In the three cases MusRank gives results closest to the corresponding
optimal solutions as derived from the genetic algorithm. In almost all of the 63 studied
cases, results are much better for the novel ranking than for any of the other ones (see
Figure3). PageRank gives similar results to MusRank in a few cases (including a relative
large network with 102 nodes). Apart from this, only for very small networks (with less
than 17 active species) some other method different from PageRank gives extinction areas

The upper dashed line shows the optimal performance corresponding to the ranking found
by the genetic algorithm (GA) search, and the lower one the null-expectation, that is the
averaged area obtained when targeting nodes in a random order. The different algorithms
used to rank the nodes are: closeness centrality (CLOS), eigenvector centrality (EIG),
betweenness centrality (BTW), degree centrality (DEG), nestedness centrality (NES),
PageRank (PAGE), and importance as measured by the MusRank (MUS). MUSrev corresponds to the reversed version of the algorithm in which the roles of active and passive
species are exchanged. The height of the boxes corresponds to the standard deviation of
the results when averaging over 103 random ways to break degeneracies in the orderings.

algorithm (average over 60 networks in the database). The left A (right B) panel shows
results when active (passive) species are targeted and passive (active) species undergo
secondary extinctions. Results are consistently much better for the MusRank, in either
the direct or the reversed version, than for any other ranking scheme.

similar to the ones of the novel algorithm. In about one third of the networks, the
ranking provided by MusRank is as good as the one found by the GA and in some cases
(networks for which the GA could not converge in a reasonable time) extinctions areas
are larger for MusRank than for the GA.
Figure 4 gives a global picture of the performance of the different rankings. It shows
the difference, averaged over 60 mutualistic networks, between the optimal solution as
found by the GA and that of each specific ranking (the 3 networks for which the GA
does not converge are excluded from this analysis). Figure 4A illustrates that the ranking
provided by the MusRank –either in the direct or the reversed form– greatly outperforms
all others.
The same conclusion can be reached when progressively removing passive rather than
active species, ordered in a sequence of increasing vulnerability (rather than decreasing
importance), see Figure 4B. Therefore, both targeting strategies and both the direct and
the reversed versions of the algorithm provide results of similar quality.

Optimally packed matrices
The ranking provided by MusRank, in which nodes are arranged by their level of importance or vulnerability, permits us to obtain a highly packed matrix as illustrated in
Figure 5. By “packed” we mean that a neat curve separates densely occupied and empty
parts of the matrix. It could be thought that this ordering might be somewhat similar to
the one that allegedly packs the matrix in the most efficient way (as defined by existing
algorithms usually employed in the literature to measure nestedness [17]). However, as
Figure 5 vividly illustrates, the ordering provided by MusRank gives a more packed matrix
than that obtained by the standard method employed by nestedness calculators [17]. This
suggests that MusRank should be used (rather than existing ones) to measure nestedness
in bipartite matrices.

Final iteration of MusRank

Figure 5: Interaction matrix of a mutualistic community in the Andes [22] composed of 42
pollinators and 61 plants ordered by decreasing importance and increasing vulnerability
respectively, as measured by MusRank. Panels A and B show two different shots of the
iteration process: the initial random condition and the final (fixed-point) ranking obtained
after iteration. Panel C shows the same matrix but with nodes labeled in an order which
gives the maximally packed matrix according to the nestedness calculator of Atmar and
Patterson [17]. The novel algorithm provides a much more “packed” matrix than this
frequently employed method.

Discussion
In this paper we have presented a novel framework to asses the relative importance of
species in mutualistic networks. Inspired by a recent work on economics/econometrics we
employ an algorithm, similar in spirit to Google’s PageRank but of non-linear character,
that we have named MusRank. The algorithm provides two complementary rankings: one
for active species (such as insects, birds, fish,...) in terms of their importance and one
for passive species (plants and their seeds, anemone, etc) in terms of their vulnerability.
We also propose a criterion to assess the quality of any given ranking of species: good
rankings lead to a fast break-down of the corresponding mutualistic network when species
are progressively removed in decreasing ranking order.
In most of the empirical mutualistic networks we have analyzed the use of our novel
framework rendered a ranking which clearly outperforms all the alternative ones used as
workbench. Results are robust in the sense that different implementations lead to similar
rankings. In many cases, the resulting ordering coincides or is very close to the optimal
one as found by a -computationally very costly- genetic algorithm. Moreover, MusRank is
much faster and finds excellent rankings even for large mutualistic networks for which the
genetic algorithm is not able to find optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time.
Therefore, the emerging ranking allows for assessing the importance of individual species
within the whole system in a meaningful, efficient and robust way. We conclude that
rankings of species importance in mutualistic networks should be constructed employing
MusRank.
Furthermore, as a by-product, the excellent packing of nested matrices provided by this
non-linear approach (see Figure 5) calls for a redefinition of the way in which nestedness
is measured. In particular we suggest that nestedness calculators should use the ranking
provided by the present algorithm, which clearly outperforms others in making the nested
architecture evident. Indeed, we believe that the nested structure of mutualistic networks
is essential for the success of MusRank; it remains to be seen what is the performance of
this scheme for bipartite networks without a nested architecture.
The novel approach –introduced here for the first time in the context of mutualistic
ecological networks– may prove of practical use for ecosystem management and biodiversity
preservation, where decisions on what aspects of ecosystems to explicitly protect need to
be made.

Methods
Algorithms
• CLOS: Nodes are sorted in order of decreasing closeness centrality. The closeness
centrality of a node is measured as the inverse of the average shortest distance to all
other nodes in the network. We computed it using the closeness centrality function
of the bipartite section of algorithms of the Python package NetworkX.
• EIG: Nodes are sorted in decreasing order of their overlap with the highest eigenvalue. To calculate the eigenvector centrality of the bipartite network we used the
gsl functions for solving non-symmetric matrices.
• BTW: Nodes are sorted in order of decreasing betweenness centrality. The betweenness centrality of a node measures the fraction of shortest paths between all possible

8

node pairs in the network, in which it appears. We used the betweeness centrality
function of the bipartite section of algorithms in the Python package NetworkX.
• DEG: Nodes are sorted in order of decreasing number of connections.
• NES: Nodes are sorted in order of the inverse contribution to network nestedness.
We calculate the total nestedness of a given bipartite matrix, and the contribution
of each species to the total as described in [16]. Species that contribute most to
the community nestedness are the most vulnerable ones [23]. In order to look for
the fastest community collapse we target them in order of increasing contribution to
nestedness .
• PAGE: Nodes are sorted in decreasing order of Google’s PageRank. The ranking
is given by the projection over each node of the leading eigenvalue of the matrix H,
whose elements are defined as
X
hij = d · aij /
aij + (1 − d)/N.
j

The constant d is a “damping factor” needed to warrant that the matrix is irreducible, and aij are the elements of the adjacency matrix. The value of d has been
set to 0.999, but results are not very sensitive to this choice.

Genetic algorithm
GA: The genetic algorithm is designed to seek for those sequences of extinction that
maximize the extinction area. We start with 104 different random orderings of the Amax
active species. At each iteration-step two of these orderings are randomly selected. Each
one beats the other with a probability proportional to its associated extinction area (normalized to the sum of both extinction areas). The loser sequence is erased from the set
and a copy of the winner will occupy its place. With a small probability, µ = 0.005, this
copy suffers a mutation, meaning that two random nodes exchange their positions in the
ordering. The algorithm is iterated until no better solutions are found in a sufficiently
large time window, that is, until no appreciable changes are seen in the extinction area
with increasing time. If the network is too large, this algorithm might not be able to find
a stationary optimal solution within a reasonable computation time.
