ABSTRACT
Polymerization of fibrin, the primary
structural protein of blood clots and thrombi,
occurs through binding of knobs ‘A’ and ‘B’ in
the central nodule of fibrin monomer to
complementary holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ in the - and
-nodules, respectively, of another monomer.
We characterized the A:a and B:b knob-hole
interactions under varying solution conditions
using Molecular Dynamics simulations of the
structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D
complexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob
‘A’ mimetic) and GHRP (knob ‘B’ mimetic).
The strength of A:a and B:b knob-hole

11

complexes was roughly equal, decreasing with
pulling force; yet, the dissociation kinetics were
sensitive to variations in acidity (pH=5-7) and
temperature (T=25-37°C). There were similar
structural changes in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ during
forced dissociation of the knob-hole complexes:
elongation of loop I, stretching of interior
region, and translocation of the moveable flap.
The disruption of the knob-hole interactions
was not an “all-or-none” transition, as it
occurred through distinct two-step or singlestep pathways with or without intermediate
states. The knob-hole bonds were stronger,
tighter, and more brittle at pH=7 than at pH=5.
The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser,
and more compliant than the A:a knob-hole
bonds at pH=7, but stronger, tighter, and less
compliant at pH=5. Surprisingly, the knob-hole
bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated
temperature (T=37°C) compared to T=25°C
due to the helix-to-coil transition in loop I,
which helps stabilize the bonds. These results
provide detailed qualitative and quantitative
characteristics underlying the most significant
non-covalent interactions involved in fibrin
polymerization.

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
Formation and decomposition of fibrin clots are
essential for hemostasis, thrombosis, and wound
healing (1-3). Fibrin network formation is initiated
by limited proteolysis of fibrinogen by thrombin,
resulting in polymerization of fibrin in two major
steps: self-assembly of fibrin monomers into twostranded half-staggered rod-like protofibrils and
lateral aggregation of protofibrils into thicker
fibrils that form the branched 3D network (4-7).
Building of fibrin protofibrils is driven by the
intermolecular A:a knob-hole interactions, while
B:b knob-hole bonds are involved in the lateral
aggregation of protofibrils. Roughly, the length
and diameter of fibrin fibers are determined by the
relative rates of longitudinal oligomerization vs.
lateral aggregation of fibrin oligomers reaching a
critical length (8). During and after formation, the
stability of blood clots in response to mechanical
forces imposed by the blood flow, wound
stretching, and other dynamic environmental
conditions is regulated by the unbinding kinetics
of the knob-hole interactions until the clot is crosslinked by Factor XIIIa (9). Consequently, the
binding and unbinding kinetics of knob-hole
interactions determine formation of fibrin fibers,
influence the final structure and stability of clots
and thrombi, including a potential of clot
remodeling, embolization, contraction, and other
(patho)physiological processes related to blood
clotting and thrombosis. Impaired knob-hole
interactions results in loose, weak, unstable clots
and are associated with the tendency to bleed.
Dense fibrin networks originating from enhanced
knob-hole interactions show increased stiffness, a
higher fibrinolytic resistance and mechanical
resilience, which may predispose individuals to
cardiovascular disease such as heart attack and
stroke (10-12).
Fibrinogen, the soluble fibrin precursor,
consists of three pairs of polypeptide chains, A,
B, and , linked together by 29 disulfide bonds
(13). Thrombin splits off two pairs of
fibrinopeptides A and B from the N-termini of the
A and Bchains, respectively, in the central
nodule. This results in the exposure of binding
sites ‘A’ and ‘B’ that interact, respectively, with
constitutively accessible sites ‘a’ and ‘b’ in the and -nodules of the lateral D regions of another
fibrin molecule (Figure 1) (14-16). The
polymerization sites have also been called knobs

22

‘A’ and ‘B’ and holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ (14) because Xray crystallographic studies of fibrinogen
fragments revealed binding pockets (holes)
complementary to the peptides, GPRP and GHRP,
corresponding to the newly exposed amino
terminal ends (knobs) of the α and β chains of
fibrin (17). Since the structure of the actual
complexes that form in fibrin polymerization have
not been observed, it is not yet known whether the
binding sites consist only of the peptides fitting
into the holes or the interfaces or the association
processes are more complex involving other
surface amino acids of the two interacting species.
The N-terminal  chain motif GPR, the
main functional sequence in the knob ‘A’, is
complementary to the hole ‘a’ located in the nodule. The N-terminal  chain motif GHRP is a
major part of the knob ‘B’ that binds to the hole
‘b’ located in the β-nodule. Analysis of the
structures of fragment D (containing the -nodule)
co-crystallized with GPRP peptide (synthetic knob
‘A’ mimetic) has revealed that the binding hole ‘a’
is localized to residues 337-379 of the -nodule:
Asp364, Arg375, His340 and Gln329
accommodate binding of the GPRP peptide, and
Lys338 and Glu323 shift slightly to allow
Lys338 to interact with the C-terminus of the
peptide (Figure 1) (18). Due to homology of the
amino acid sequences forming the hole ‘a’ (in the
-nodule) and hole ‘b’ (in the -nodule) and
structural similarity of their binding pockets
(Figure 1), the hole ‘b’ involves similar binding
regions βAsp383-Asp398, βTyr404-Gly434, and
βGln359-Ile369, which accommodate formation of
binding contacts with and subsequent association
of the peptide GHRP (synthetic knob ‘B’
mimetic).
Although the X-ray crystallographic
studies have provided valuable structural data
about the binding sites mediating the knob-hole
associations, this information is limited to a static
molecular image of the A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes. Optical trap-based force spectroscopy
and atomic force microscopy have been used to
probe directly the strength of knob-hole
interactions via dissociation of knob-hole bonds at
the single-molecule level (6,19,20). Yet, these
experiments have limited spatial resolution and do
not reveal the molecular mechanisms of the knobhole interactions. To address these limitations,

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
here we have embarked on the computational
exploration of the knob-hole interactions in fibrin
using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations,
which, in conjunction with atomic structural
models, help to advance our understanding of
protein function and dynamics (21). In computerbased modeling of the force-induced dissociation
of protein-protein complexes, conditions of force
application are similar to force protocols employed
in dynamic force spectroscopy (22,23). To
approach physiologically relevant conditions,
tensile forces and temperature can be varied, ionic
strength can be modeled by including an
appropriate number of ions in the solvation box,
and the solvent acidity (pH) can be modeled by
taking into account the degree of protonation of
amino acid residues.
In this work, we have performed
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of forced
dissociation of non-covalent A:a and B:b bonds to
explore and compare the dynamic behavior of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes subject to
tension. Here, we report the results of our studies
of the kinetics (timescales and reaction pathways),
thermodynamics (energy landscapes), and
molecular mechanisms of the forced dissociation
of the A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes
performed under different virtual ambient
conditions (pH and temperature). We have
employed the atomic resolution inherent to MD
simulation approaches to assess the importance of
particular amino acid residues and clusters of
residues for the binding affinity and strength of the
knob-hole interactions. We have probed the
dynamic network of residues in the holes ‘a’ and
‘b’ forming electrostatic contacts with the peptides
GPRP and GHRP, respectively. Taken together,
the results obtained provide a broad foundation for
understanding the key interactions in fibrin
polymerization. The kinetic and thermodynamic
characteristics can also be used to formulate new
drug design strategies to attenuate the knob-hole
interactions in fibrin, in order to modify the fibrin
clot structure and properties and to reduce the
danger of thromboembolic complications.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Model systems for A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes – Structural models for the A:a and B:b
knob-hole complexes were obtained using the Xray structure of double-D fragment from human

33

fibrin containing both holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ cocomplexed with the Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide
(GPRPam) peptide and Gly-His-Arg-Pro-amide
(GHRPam) peptides (PDB entry 1FZC) (24). In
these structures, holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ contain residues
143-392 and β197-458, respectively. We used the
synthetic knob ‘A’ (GPRP) and knob ‘B’ (GHRP),
which mimic the N-terminal portions of knobs ‘A’
and ‘B’ binding with holes ‘a’ and ‘b’,
respectively (18). The hole ‘a’ is localized to
clusters of residues Trp315-Tpr330, Trp335Asn365 and Phe295-Thr305 in the -nodule.
The hole ‘b’ in the β-nodule involves binding
regions βAsp383-Asp398, βTyr404-Gly434, and
βGln359-Ile369
(Figure
1).
Summarized
description for preparation of each model system
Aa1 (pH=7, T=37°C), Aa2 (pH=7, T=25°C), Aa3
(pH=5, T=37°C), and Aa4 (pH=5, T=25°C) for the
A:a knob-hole bond, and Bb1 (pH=7, T=37°C),
Bb2 (pH=7, T=25°C), Bb3 (pH=5, T=37°C), and
Bb4 (pH=5, T=25°C) for the B:b knob-hole bond
is given in Table S1 and S2 in Supplemental Data
(SD). To model the pH-dependence of forced
dissociation of knob-hole bonds, we considered
the degree of protonation of amino acids. Because
at pH=5 only His residues are protonated
compared to pH=7 (pKa≈6), we replaced neutral
His residues with positively charged His residues.
Ion concentration translates to including an
appropriate number of ions Na+ and Cl- in the
water box. We used the relevant physiological 150
mM concentration of NaCl. Details regarding the
system preparation are given in SD (Table S1 and
S2). Each system was solvated in a water box; the
number of water molecules and size of salvation
box are given in Table S2 in SD. In Umbrella
Sampling calculations, we increased the volume of
the water box to 47.6 Å x 49.1 Å x 98.7 Å (for
systems Aa1-Aa4) and to 50.1 Å x 50.9 Å x 103.6
Å (for systems Bb1-Bb4). Each model system was
first minimized for 5000 steps using the steepest
descent algorithm. After initial minimization, each
system was heated to T=25°C or 37°C and
equilibrated for 0.3 ns. The simulations were
carried out at constant temperature. The water
density was maintained at 1 g/cm3, and periodic
boundary conditions were applied to the water
molecules. Non-bonded
interactions
were
switched off at 12 Å distance, and had a switching
function from 10 Å to 12 Å. The long-range
electrostatics was described using the particle-

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
mesh Ewald method. We used Langevin
thermostat to maintain the conditions of constant
temperature. The damping coefficient was set to 
= 6πηa/m = 50 ps-1, which corresponds to the
water viscosity η = 0.01 Poise, and size and mass
of amino acid a = 5x10-8 cm and m = 2x10-22 g,
respectively.
MD simulations of the A:a and B:b
knob-hole complexes – To carry out
computational modeling of systems Aa1-Aa4 and
Bb1-Bb4 we used NAMD 2.7 software package
(25) and the CHARMM22 force-field (26). Each
initial protein structure was solvated with at least
15 Å of TIP3P water (27) using the VMD solvate
plugin (28). We carried out 10-ns equilibrium
simulations of the D region of the fibrinogen
molecule, which includes the -nodule (with hole
‘a’) and the -nodule (with hole ‘b’) cocomplexed with the peptide GPRP (knob ‘A’
mimetic) and GHRP (knob ‘B’ mimetic),
respectively (see Figure 1). The forced
dissociation of GPRP peptide from the -nodule
(A:a knob-hole complex) and GHRP peptide from
the β-nodule (B:b knob-hole complex) was
performed using steered Molecular Dynamics
implemented in the NAMD package. To mimic the
experimental force-clamp measurements, we
constrained hole ‘a’ (hole ‘b’) by fixing the Cterminal part of one γ chain (β chain) - residue
γGly160 (βVal205); constant tensile force f = f·n
was applied to the Cα-carbon of Pro4 residue in
peptide GPRP (GHRP) in the direction n
perpendicular to the binding interface to dissociate
the A:a (B:b) knob-hole bond. We used force f =
150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 pN. To obtain
statistically meaningful information, we performed
multiple pulling runs: 15 trajectories of forced
unbinding were generated for each force value
(total of 90 trajectories for each model system).
Analysis of simulation output – Analysis
of Structures: To probe conformational flexibility
of the protein domains forming hole ‘a’ and hole
‘b’, we computed the root-mean-square deviations,
RMSD(i) = (1/ttottj(xi(tj) – ~x i ))1/2, where xi(tj) and
~
xi

are positions of the C-atom i (i-th residue) in a
current state and in the reference state,
respectively, and ttot is the length of the simulation
run. To remove rotational and translational
contributions, we used a “running average”
structure for each 150-ps time interval as a

44

reference
state. To probe
the
global
conformational transitions, we analyzed transient
structures for each model system and visualized
then using the VMD plugin (28). Analysis of
Kinetics: We analyzed the average bond lifetimes
and standard deviations. A pair of amino acids i
and j is said to form a binary contact if the
distance between the center-of-mass of their side
chains rij < 6.5Å exists for more than 0.1 ns. The
time-dependent maps of interacting residues were
constructed and the total number of binding
contacts Q(t) was used to monitor the dissociation
progress. The bond lifetime τ was defined as the
time at which Q=0. Molecular Mechanism: We
utilized Essential Dynamics (29,30) to capture
collective displacements of amino acid residues
x(t) = x(t) – x0 from their equilibrium positions
x0 along the unbinding reaction coordinate X (see
SD for detail). We performed numerical
diagonalization of the covariance matrix C(t)=
M1/2x(t)(M1/2x(t))T= TTLT to compute the
matrix of eigenvalues L and the matrix of
eigenvectors T (M is the matrix of masses of
amino acids). These were used to calculate the
root-mean-square displacements for each residue I
along the eigenmode k, i.e. RMSDkI = (CII/MII)1/2 =
(1/MIIkl(TTIkLklTlI))1/2 = (LkITkI2/MII)1/2, in the
center-of-mass representation. The native structure
of the knob-hole complex was superposed with the
structure corresponding to the maximum
displacement along the first (principal) mode k =
1. Analysis of Thermodynamics: To resolve the
unbinding free energy landscape G(X), we
employed Umbrella Sampling method (31,32),
described in detail in the Supplemental Data, to
compute the potential of mean force, in order to
quantify the interaction energy.
RESULTS
Native properties of A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes at various ambient conditions: To
identify the residues in the holes ‘a’ and ‘b’
principally involved in dynamic interactions with
GPRP and GHRP and assess the plasticity of the
knob-hole bonds in response to varying
environmental conditions, we explored the A:a
and B:b knob-hole complexes in their native state.
Since the knob-hole interactions are mainly
electrostatic, it should be expected that the
strength of knob-hole bonds is susceptible to
variation in proton concentration (pH) and

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
temperature, both of which can change at a wound
site in vivo. It is known that at the sites of
inflammation
and
tumor
growth
the
microenvironment is acidified, e.g., as a result of
local metabolic acidosis due to hypoxia (33).
Therefore, we have performed equilibrium
simulations of the A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes at pH=5 and pH=7, and at T=25°C and
T=37°C (body temperature). By varying pH and
temperature we generated four model systems to
study the A:a knob-hole complexes (Aa1-Aa4) and
four model systems for the B:b knob-hole
complexes (Bb1- Bb4) described in Experimental
procedures and in Supplemental Data (SD) (see
Table S1 and S2).
For each of the eight model systems (Aa1Aa4 and Bb1-Bb4), we analyzed the root-meansquare-deviations
(RMSD)
quantifying
fluctuations for each amino acid residue in holes
‘a’ and ‘b’ in the bound state with the
corresponding ligand peptide, GPRP and GHRP,
respectively. It should be expected that amino
acids in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ involved in binding of
the peptides would be more flexible to
accommodate small-amplitude thermal peptide
motion in the binding pocket. Hence, these
residues would show larger RMSD values. We
found that in all four model systems Aa1-Aa4 for
the A:a knob-hole complexes, the largest
fluctuations (RMSD>1.5 Å) correspond to the
same structural regions in hole ‘a’ localized to
residues Trp315-Trp330, Trp335-Asn365, and
Phe295-Thr305 (Figures S1A and S1B).
Specifically, residues Glu323, Pro360, and
Pro299 were found to have the highest RMSD
values. These same stretches of residues have been
found in earlier studies of the X-ray structures of
fragment D co-crystallized with the peptide GPRP
to participate in the binding interactions (14,34).
These binding determinants were termed loop I or
region I (Trp315-Trp330), interior region or
region II (Trp335-Asn365), and moveable flap or
region III (Phe295-Thr305) (Figures 1B and 1C).
There were smaller changes in RMSD values for
amino acid residues in loop I and moveable flap
observed at the higher temperature (T=37°C) as
compared to the lower temperature (T=25°C) and
for the neutral environment (pH=7) as compared
to an acidic environment (pH=5). The only
significant difference was detected for amino acids

55

in the interior region, for which RMSD values
increased from 1.7-1.8 Å to 2.0–2.2 Å upon
decreasing pH from 7 to 5 (e.g., see peak at
residue Pro360 in Figures S1A and S1B).
We obtained similar results for the model
systems Bb1-Bb4 for the B-b knob-hole
complexes (Figures S1C and S1D). The largest
fluctuations detected (RMSD>2.0 Å) correspond
to the regions of hole ‘b’ localized to residues
βAsp383-Asp398, βTyr404-Gly434 and βGln359Ile369. The residues βGly362, βSer388, and
βHis429 were found to have the highest RMSD
values.
Consistent
with
the
previous
crystallographic studies (14,34), the three binding
regions in hole ‘b’ had the secondary structure
similar to that for loop I (region I), interior region
(region II), and moveable flap (region III) forming
the binding interface in hole ‘a’ (compare, e.g.,
Figures 1A and 1C, and Figures 1B and 1D). For
this reason, we used these same notations to
denote the binding structures in hole ‘b’: loop I
(βAsp383-Asp398), interior region (βTyr404Gly434), and moveable flap (βGln359-Ile369)
(Figure 1C). We also found that the mobility of
amino acids forming these binding determinants in
hole ‘b’ does not change much upon changing
temperature and pH (Figures S1C and S1D).
To summarize, our results of equilibrium
simulations are in full agreement with published
X-ray crystallographic data in terms of identifying
the binding determinants for the A:a and B:b
knob-hole complexes, which validates our MD
simulation protocol. The results indicate that the
binding structures and near-native ensemble of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds are fairly similar.
There is a minor difference in mobility of the
binding determinants, which are generally more
flexible at pH=7 in hole ‘b’ than in hole ‘a’.
Varying temperature and pH within the studied
ranges does not affect much the binding structures
that stabilize the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds,
except for the binding residues Trp335-Asn365
(region II) in hole ‘a’, which become more mobile
in an acidic environment.
Forced dissociation kinetics of A:a and
B:b knob-hole complexes: We used a 150-400
pN range of constant pulling force to model the
influence of varying stress due to blood flow on
the knob-hole bond lifetimes. These forces were
chosen as physiologically relevant. The range of
hydrodynamic forces of the blood flow acting on

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
knob-hole bonds in fibrin can be obtained using
the relationship f = 6πηCRhr, which links the
shear rate (r) and the tensile force (f). Here, C ≈ 12 is the dimensionless constant, η is blood
viscosity (~10 Poise), R is clot size, and h is the
average distance between the clot and vessel walls
(~0.1–1 m). Our estimates show that under
(patho)physiological
conditions
of
blood
circulation, the knob-hole bonds in fibrin polymers
forming R ≈ 101–102 m clots are subjected to
tensile forces from a few tens of pico-Newtons
(normal arterial blood flow with r ≈ 102 s-1) to a
few nano-Newtons (stenotic blood flow with r ≈
104 s-1).
We mechanically tested the strength of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds under varying
conditions, i.e. for different temperature (25°C and
37°C) and acidity (pH=5 and pH=7), using pulling
simulations (see Experimental procedures).
Lowering pH from pH=7 to pH=5 results in the
protonation of six His residues (pKa≈6) in hole ‘a’,
four His residues in hole ‘b’, and one His residue
in the GHRP peptide (see Table S1 in SD). These
additional positive charges could alter the pattern
of electrostatic interactions.
The strength of non-covalent bonds
usually decreases with increased pulling force,
meaning that protein-ligand complexes dissociate
faster at higher forces (34-36). We found that as
the pulling force (f) increased, the average bond
lifetimes (τ) decreased and the dependence of τ on
f was monotonic for all model systems, Aa1-Aa4
and Bb1-Bb4 (Figure 2). For equivalent ambient
conditions, the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds were
found to be roughly equally strong in the entire
force range 150-400 pN (Figure 2). Yet, both A:a
and B:b knob-hole bonds were stronger and had
longer lifetimes in neutral solution (pH=7) as
compared to acidic solution (pH=5). Also, the A:a
knob-hole bonds were found to be stronger at
T=37°C as compared to T=25°C both for pH=5
and pH=7, whereas the B-b knob-hole bonds were
weaker at T= 37°C for pH=7 and almost equally
strong at T=37°C and 25°C for pH=5 (Figure 2).
Hence, increasing proton concentration has a more
profound effect on the A:a and B:b knob-hole
bonds as compared to varying temperature.
Single- and two-step dissociation of A:a
and B:b knob-hole complexes: Statistics of bond
lifetimes indicate that the force-driven dissociation
of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds is intrinsically

66

stochastic and quite variable. This can be seen,
e.g., from large standard deviations of the average
bond lifetimes, especially at lower 150–250 pN
force (Figure 2). To understand the origin of large
fluctuations in the bond lifetimes, we analyzed the
dynamics of forced disruption of the binding
contacts. In the studies of the near-native
ensemble, we have identified 16 most important
amino acid residues in the binding interface in
holes ‘a’ and ‘b’, which formed ~90% of all stable
contacts with the residues in the GPRP and GHRP
peptides, respectively. These are residues
Phe295, Asp297, Asp298, Asp301, Phe304,
Thr305, Phe322, Cys326, Gln329, Asp330,
Lys338, Cys339, His340, Tyr363, Asp364,
Arg375 in hole ‘a’, and residues βGln359,
βLeu360, βAsn364, βThr368, βTrp385, βLys392,
βCys394, βGlu397, βAsp398, βArg406, βCys407,
βHis408, βThr431, βAsp432, βMet438, βSer443
in hole ‘b’.
Next, we performed extensive analyses of
the simulation output generated at the lowest
attainable pulling force f=150 pN. To study the
dissociation dynamics, we monitored the total
number of stable contacts at the knob-hole
interface as a function of time Q(t) (see
Experimental procedures), which reflects the
instantaneous changes in the strength of the bond
during forced unbinding. The time-dependent
profiles of Q, obtained from the most
representative knob-hole unbinding trajectories for
the model systems Aa1–Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4, show
that Q(t) starts off from ~15-18 contacts for the
A:a knob-hole complexes (Figures 3A and 3B)
and from ~15-17 contacts for the B:b knob-hole
complexes (Figures 3C and 3D), which
correspond to the native bound state (B), but
decays to zero along the unbinding pathway. The
moment of time τ, at which all the binding
contacts have been disrupted and, hence, Q(t)=0,
signifies a complete dissociation of the complex
and formation of the unbound (dissociated) state
(U). A closer analysis revealed that in some
simulation runs, the forced dissociation occurred
in a single step, B → U, whereas in other runs, the
dissociation occurred by populating the
intermediate state (I), i.e. B → I → U. This is
reflected in the profiles of Q(t) (Figure 3), some of
which show a one-step transition, i.e. initial
plateau followed by a sharp decay to zero, whereas

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
other profiles exhibit two-step transitions. The
former pathway (P1) corresponds to the singlestep transition (B → U), whereas the latter
pathway (P2) represent the two-step unbinding
transition (B → I → U). We have estimated the
extent of this kinetic partitioning. In the case of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds at pH=7, the twostep unbinding pathway P2 was observed in only
~10% of simulated trajectories (Figures 3A and
3C); in the acidic environment (pH=5) the share of
this minor pathway increased to ~30% (Figures 3B
and 3D).
In summary, our results indicate that
dissociation of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds
occurs through multiple competing kinetic
pathways with or without intermediate (partially
dissociated) states, which can underlie the
remarkable variability of bond lifetimes.
Dynamic maps of binding contacts
forming A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds: To get
insight into structural details of the knob-hole
formation and dissociation, we constructed and
analyzed the time-dependent molecular maps of
amino acid residues in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ coupled to
the residues in GPRP and GHRP peptides,
respectively, during their forced unbinding.
Figures S2 and S3 show the maps of stable binary
contacts and how they change over time for model
systems Aa1–Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4. For all systems
Aa1–Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4, stable binary contacts
formed between residues in the hole ‘a’ and the
knob ‘A’ and between residues in the hole ‘b’ and
the knob ‘B’ are summarized in Table I.
The results obtained indicate that for the
A:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, the strongest
contacts are formed between amino acid residues
in loop I and residues Gly1 and Arg3 in GPRP;
between residues in interior region and residues
Gly1, Pro2, Arg3 in GPRP; and between residues
in moveable flap and residues Pro2 and Pro4 in
GPRP (Figure 1). The pH lowering results in
weakening of interactions between residues in
interior region and residues Gly1 and Pro2 in
GPRP and between residues in loop I and residue
Gly1 in GPRP, but also results in formation of
stable contacts between Gly1 and Pro2 in GPRP
and residues in moveable flap. At pH=5, there is a
preference for association with the moveable flap,
which is opposite to what is observed at pH=7
where binding to interior region and loop I is more
favorable. Redistribution of binding contacts leads

77

to weakening of the A:a knob-hole bonds, also
reflected by the decrease of the average bond
lifetime for systems Aa3 and Aa4 (Figure 3A).
This finding implies that molecular interactions of
hole ‘a’ with residues Gly1 and Pro2 in GPRP
play a crucial role. For the B:b knob-hole bonds,
the strongest contacts are between residues in loop
I and interior region and residues Gly1 and Arg3
of GHRP (Figure 1). At pH=7, additional contacts
form between His2 of GHRP and residues in
interior region and moveable flap. The pH
lowering results in weakening of the interactions
between residues in interior region and the
moveable flap with His2 of GHRP, but preserving
contacts between residues in loop I and the interior
region with residues Gly1 and Arg3 in GHRP.
Structural transitions underlying forced
dissociation of A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes: We employed the Essential Dynamics
approach (see Experimental procedures; see also
SD) to single out the most important types of
motion showing the largest contribution in the
direction of the global transition (dissociation).
Using positions of amino acid residues as a
function of time, x(t) = {x1(0), x2(0),…, xN(0)}, we
numerically diagonalized the covariance matrix of
their mass-weighted displacements x(t) from the
reference (native) structure x0={x1(0), x2(0),…,
xN(0)} (bound state) to obtained the matrix of
eigenvalues L, and the matrix of eigenvectors T.
The eigenvalues LI provide information about the
amplitude of the I-th eigenvector tI along the
displacement x(t). We calculated the root-meansquare displacement (RMSD) for each I-th residue
along mode k, RMSDkI = (LkITkI2/MII)1/2, where MII
is the element of M – the matrix of masses of
amino acids. The RMSD profiles for the first three
modes (k=1, 2, and 3) capturing ~85% of the
dissociation dynamics for model systems Aa1–
Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4 were determined (Figures S4
and S5).
The peaks of RMSDkI correspond to
residues forming the main binding determinants –
loop I, interior region, and moveable flap
described in Figure 1 (see also Figure S1). For
these regions, the RMSDkI values are in the 2–4 Å
range for the A:a knob-hole bonds (Figure S4) and
in the 2–5 Å range for the B:b knob-hole bonds
(Figure S5). The RMSDkI values for the A:a and
B:b knob-hole bonds are close, implying similar
flexibility of their binding interface. At pH=7, the

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
interfaces in the A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes
show more flexibility at higher temperature
T=37°C (Figures S4A, S4B, and S5), but when the
pH is lowered to 5, the amplitude of motions is
roughly the same at T=25°C and 37°C (Figures
S4C, S4D, and S5). For the A:a knob-hole bond,
RMSDkI=3-5 Å for interior region and moveable
flap at pH=7 (both at T=25°C and 37°C) and
RMSDkI=2 Å for loop I. For the A:a knob-hole
bonds, pH lowering resulted in smaller values of
RMSDkI for all three regions: at T=37°C motions
of binding residues in loop I are quenched (Figure
S4). For the B:b knob-hole bonds, changing pH
from 7 to 5 leads to increased RMSDkI=5 Å for
residues in moveable flap (Figure S5).
For each system, the most essential
structural changes associated with the first
(principal) mode (k=1) are summarized in Figure
S6. Both for the A:a and B:b knob-hole
complexes, dissociation is associated with partial
opening of the binding interface, which is
accompanied by the simultaneous stretching of all
binding regions, the extent of which is determined
by ambient conditions. The binding interface in
the B:b knob-hole complex is slightly more
flexible. The binding determinants in hole ‘b’
maintain their secondary structure (Figure S6, EH); yet there are minor changes in the secondary
structure propensities for regions I and III in hole
‘a’ (Figure S6, A-D). Both for the A:a and B:b
knob-hole complexes, there is a displacement of
loop I and translocation of moveable flap from the
periphery to the center of the interface. The latter
transition is coupled to partial stretching of the
interior region. Both temperature and pH variation
bring about rather small changes to the molecular
arrangement.
Thermodynamics of forced dissociation
of A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds: We resolved
the profile of the Gibbs free energy change for
forced unbinding, G, as a function of the
“receptor-ligand distance”, X, for various solution
conditions (see Experimental procedures; see also
SD) (31,32). For the A:a knob-hole complex, X
was taken to be the distance between the residue
Gly160 in hole ‘a’ and the C-terminal Pro4
residue in GPRP. For the B:b knob-hole complex,
X was taken to be the distance between the residue
βVal205 in hole ‘b’ and the C-terminal Pro4
residue in GHRP. Residues Gly160 and βVal205
were chosen because they are in the core of the

88

binding pockets in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’, respectively.
The results are presented in Figure 4, where we
have compared the profiles of the average G as a
function of the distance change ΔX for systems
Aa1–Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4. We also estimated the
“bond width” x and the “transition state
position” xdirectly from the curves of G.
These characteristics (x and x) are difficult,
if not impossible, to obtain experimentally. The
average width of the bond x, which we have
defined as half of the width of the energy well for
the bound state (B) corresponding to the energy
change larger than thermal fluctuations
(G>3kBT≈1.8 kcal/mol at T=25°C and 1.9
kcal/mol at T=37°C), shows how tightly coupled
the protein and ligand molecules are. For example,
a steeper growth in G and, hence narrower x, is
indicative of a stronger and tighter coupling. The
position of the transition state x, or the critical
bond extension at which G reaches the energy
plateau (bond dissociation), is a measure of the
conformational tolerance of the bimolecular
complex under tension. Smaller (larger) values of
xcorrespond to more brittle (more flexible)
bonds. The values of these parameters (x, and
x) and the bond dissociation energy Gb, defined
as the plateau of G at large ΔX (see Figure 4A),
for all model systems Aa1–Aa4 and Bb1–Bb4 are
summarized in Table II.
For all the systems studied, the curves of
G show a well around the minimum at a zero
bond extension (ΔX=0), but G rapidly increases,
reaching an energy plateau at larger values of
ΔX=1–2 nm. The smooth curves of G for the A:a
and B:b knob-hole complexes, obtained in the
neutral environment (pH=7), correspond to the
single-step transition (B  U), which is the
dominant pathway of dissociation P1 described
earlier (Figure 4). Yet, the curves of G obtained
in the acidic environment (pH=5) show several
shallow energy wells separated by regions of
energy increase. This is because G represents an
ensemble average picture and, hence, it also
contains the contribution from the two-step
transition (B  I  U), the alternative minor
pathway of dissociation P2 (Figure 4). Both the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds are characterized by
more narrow x=0.15-0.19 nm for A:a knob-hole
bond and x=0.22-0.29 nm for the B:b knob-hole
bond and shorter x=0.98-0.99 nm for A:a
knob-hole bond and x=1.21-1.31 nm for the

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
B:b knob-hole bond at pH=7, as compared to the
same quantities at pH=5, i.e. x =0.41-0.55 nm
x=1.45-1.51 nm for A:a knob-hole bond and
x =0.30-0.45 nm, x=1.25-1.37 nm for the
B:b knob-hole bond (Table II). Also, the A:a
knob-hole bonds are characterized by smaller x
and shorter x than the B:b knob-hole bonds at
pH=7, but larger x and longer x at pH=5
(Table II). The temperature variation does not
seem to affect much the values of x and x.
To summarize, our results reveal that both
the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds are stronger in
the neutral solution (pH=7) compared to the acidic
environment (pH=5). The A:a knob-hole bonds are
stronger than the B:b knob-hole bonds at pH=7 but
weaker at pH=5 (Figure 4). These conclusions
become evident when comparing for all model
systems the values of bond dissociation energy Gb
(Table II). Quite unexpectedly, the A:a and B:b
knob-hole bonds become stronger, not weaker,
upon the temperature increase from 25°C to 37°C
both in acidic and neutral solution. The A:a and
B:b knob-hole bonds tend to form tighter and more
brittle complexes at pH=7 than at pH=5. The B:b
knob-hole bonds are looser and more compliant
than the A:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, but tighter
and more brittle at pH=5.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Fibrin polymerization driven by knob-hole
interactions is a highly dynamic, kinetically
controlled process (37). From the previous X-ray
crystallographic studies, knowledge about the
molecular interactions mediating formation of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes has been
limited to the structure of fragment D cocrystallized with synthetic peptides, GPRP and
GHRP, mimicking knobs ‘A’ and ‘B’, respectively
(17,18,38). On the other hand, the state-of-the-art
experimental instrumentation, such as optical trapbased force spectroscopy, have made it possible to
quantify directly the strength of the A:a and B:b
knob-hole bonds at the single-molecule level
(6,19). Yet, these experiments cannot access the
full dynamics of molecular transitions and resolve
the molecular structural details of coupling of the
knobs ‘A’ and ‘B’ to the holes ‘a’ and ‘b’,
respectively. The heterogeneity of experimental
force signals, partial elongation of fibrin
molecules, and the presence of non-specific
interactions
all
make
interpretation
of

99

experimental data difficult. Despite the critical
biological and clinical significance of blood
clotting, there have been no theoretical studies of
the kinetics (timescales, pathways) and
thermodynamics (energy landscape) of the knobhole interactions aiming at a fundamental
understanding of their mechanism(s) at the
molecular and sub-molecular level. Here, we
showed that these goals can be achieved by using
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which, in
combination with experimental results, continue to
play an important role in advancing our
understanding of the protein-protein interactions
(39). In recent years, dynamic force measurements
in silico, in which tensile forces are used to unfold
proteins and to dissociate protein-protein
complexes, have become a powerful tool to
interpret and clarify the results of nanomechanical
experiments in vitro (22,39,40).
Here, for the first time, using a
combination of MD simulations and theoretical
methods, we explored the kinetics and
thermodynamics and resolved the structural
mechanisms of the knob-hole interactions in
fibrin, which initiate and drive fibrin
polymerization. These approaches have enabled us
to describe in atomic detail the native properties of
the A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes and their
force-induced dissociation. We also probed the
influence of varying important ambient conditions,
pH and temperature, on the A:a and B:b knob-hole
coupling. The rationale for varying these
parameters is that the knob-hole interactions are
mainly electrostatic and, hence, are susceptible to
a change in temperature and acidity, both of which
have (patho)physiological significance. Our
knowledge regarding the mechanism of knob-hole
interactions in fibrin would be incomplete had we
not understood the dynamic mosaic of binding
residues stabilizing the A:a and B:b knob-hole
bonds. For this reason, we constructed and
analyzed the entire molecular maps of amino acid
residues in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’, which establish
strong persistent binding contacts with residues in
the peptides GPRP (knob ‘A’ mimetic) and GHRP
(knob ‘B’ mimetic), respectively. This has helped
us identify the residues critical for binding and
assess the relative importance of specific amino
acid residues, clusters of residues, and even whole
binding determinants. These comprehensive
efforts have enabled us to extract qualitative and

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
quantitative
characteristics
of
fibrin
polymerization.
Profiling the dependence of the knob-hole
bond lifetimes on a tensile force revealed that the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds are roughly equally
strong when probed mechanically, albeit the
dissociation kinetics are sensitive to pH and
temperature variation (Figure 3). The finding that
the strength of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds is
similar is at odds with the recently reported
experimental data, according to which the A:a
knob-hole bond is about six-fold stronger than the
B:b knob-hole bond (6,19). To shed light on the
origin of this disagreement, we performed pilot
MD simulations by reproducing formation of the
A:a knob-hole bonds using not just a GPRP-hole
‘a’ construct, but a short double-stranded fibrin
oligomer formed by three fibrin monomers. In
short, the oligomer was first built by superposing
the structures of the double-D fragment (PDB
code: 1FZC (24)) and fibrin monomer (PDB code:
3GHG (41)); the unresolved portions of the αchain and -chain with knobs ‘A’ and ‘B’ were
reconstructed manually (Figure 5A). Next, we ran
long 250 ns simulations for the oligomer. We
found that binding of the N-terminal end of the α
chain (knob ‘A’) to the pocket in the -nodule
(hole ‘a’) is accompanied by electrostatic coupling
between residues Glu323, Lys356, and Asp297
in the -nodule and residues Lys58, Asp61, and
His67 in the central nodule of the adjacent fibrin
monomers (Figures 5B and 5C). Hence, our
preliminary data seem to indicate that the binding
interface might extend beyond the GPR motif
exposed upon thrombin cleavage at the N-termini
of the α chains, which is traditionally named knob
‘A’, but more simulations are needed to verify this
result. In fact, secondary involvement of the Nterminal portion of the β chain in the A:a knobhole binding is consistent with transient
interactions between fibrin molecules mediated by
the N-terminus of the β chain revealed at the
single-molecule level (42). Furthermore, this
finding supports an idea that the A:a knob-hole
interactions in fibrin might have a much broader
interface than just the peptide-in-pocket complex.
The difference in the binding interfaces between
natural protein complexes and peptide-based
constructs is the most likely source of
disagreement between the published experimental

1010

data and our results regarding the relative strength
of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first substantial
evidence for the interactions mediated by “the full
knob”, which extends beyond the N-terminal GPR
sequence.
Although the A:a (and, perhaps, B:b)
knob-hole interactions are very likely not limited
to the GPR (or GHRP) motifs, the corresponding
peptides had been widely used as “synthetic
knobs” and as effective competitive inhibitors of
the knob-hole interactions (6,9,19, 42-45). Thus,
the core of the knob-hole binding characterized
using X-ray crystallography is represented by the
complexes formed with the GPRP and GHRP
peptides, which has been successfully used to
study the most basic aspects of the A:a and B:b
knob-hole interactions (45,46).
Another important finding is that the A:a
and B:b knob-hole interactions in fibrin are not the
end product of “all-or-none” transitions as they
might occur through distinct pathways via
formation of intermediate states (pathway P2 in
Figure 3). An immediate consequence of this
finding in the context of fibrin polymerization is
that this might lead to the formation of the A:a and
B:b knob-hole bonds of varying strength. This
should be expected since the knob-hole
interactions occur in the environment where the
contact duration and tensile force change due to
the varying blood shear. There is a question
whether the knob-hole bonds in fibrin exhibit the
so-called “catch-slip” behavior (34,35,47,48), i.e.
when the strength of the bond, quantified by the
average lifetime, first increases with increasing
tensile force and then decreases at higher forces.
This unusual type of protein-ligand interaction has
been demonstrated for a number of interacting
pairs, such as such as P-selectin/PSGL-1 (34),
GP1b/von Willebrand factor (49), bacterial
adhesin
FimH/mannose
(50),
integrin
α5β1/fibronectin (51), and integrin LFA-1/ICAM1 (52). Our results show that the A:a and the B:b
knob-hole bonds behave as typical “slip” bonds in
the 150–400 pN range of tensile forces, but we do
not rule out the possibility that the knob-hole
bonds might behave as “catch” bonds at lower
forces (<150 pN). Because pulling simulations
become
prohibitively
more
expensive
computationally at lower pulling forces, we were
unable to probe the force-dependence of the

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
strength of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds
below 150 pN.
Our results indicate that despite some
differences in the kinetics depending on the
magnitude of applied force and variation in
temperature and pH, there are similar structural
transitions in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’, which accompany
the force-induced dissociation of the A:a and B:b
knob-hole bonds. We singled out the most
important modes of motion in the direction of the
“reaction coordinate” - receptor-ligand distance,
both type and amplitude, which contribute the
most to the forced dissociation reaction. We found
that for the A:a (B:b) knob-hole bonds, these
structural changes are the following: 1-4 Å (2-4 Å)
elongation of loop I, stretching of the interior
region by 3.5–4.5 Å (1–4 Å), and 2.5–7 Å (2–6.5
Å) translocation of the moveable flap. The extent
of these changes depends on the degree of
protonation and temperature (Figure S6), and the
amplitude of motions is larger at higher
temperature.
Because in the simulations we have
maintained the conditions of constant pressure and
temperature, we used the Gibbs free energy to
describe the thermodynamics of the A:a and B:b
knob-hole interactions in fibrin. The profiles of the
Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, as a function of the
change in the interaction distance, ΔX, indicate
rather strongly that both in the neutral solution and
acidic solution the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds
become stronger at higher temperature T=37°C
compared to the lower temperature T=25°C. For
the A:a knob-hole bonds, for pH=7 Gb=19.3
kcal/mol at 37°C and 16.2 kcal/mol at 25°C and
for pH=5 Gb=6.1 kcal/mol at 37°C and 1.7
kcal/mol at 25°C. For the B:b knob-hole bonds, for
pH=7 Gb=15.3 kcal/mol at 37°C and 12.6 kcal/mol
at 25°C and for pH=5 Gb=9.2 kcal/mol and 8.4
kcal/mol at 25°C
(see Table II). This is
counterintuitive given that, in general, thermal
fluctuations tend to destabilize and weaken noncovalent bonds. To find a structural basis for these
unusual findings, we have compared the output

1111

from Umbrella Sampling calculations at T=37°C
and T=25°C and have found that, both in hole ‘a’
and hole ‘b’ in neutral and acidic solution, there is
the -helix-to-random-coil transition in loop I,
which occurs at a higher temperature (T=37°C).
The “melting transition” is displayed for the A:a
knob-hole bond in Figure 6, where we have
compared the structures of the A:a knob-hole
complex at 37°C and 25°C (pH=7; model systems
Aa1 and Aa2). We see that residues γ327-330 in
loop I form an -helical pitch at 25°C, which
melts into a more flexible random coil structure at
37°C. As a result, residues γGlu328, γGln329, and
γAsp330 come closer and bind stronger with Arg3
in GPRP, which provides an additional ~2.5–4.5
kcal/mol stabilization to the A:a knob-hole bond.
This combined entropic effect (order-disorder
transition) and enthalpic effect (formation of
stronger contacts) compensates for the thermal
destabilization of the knob-hole interfaces and
accounts for the increased stability of the A:a
knob-hole bond at T=37°C as compared to
T=25°C. We found a similar transition in the loop
I in hole ‘b’ (data not shown).
To conclude, we have performed a
comprehensive
study
of
the
molecular
mechanisms, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the
knob-hole interactions in fibrin using theory and
simulations. The results obtained provide a broad
theoretical foundation for the key interactions in
the fibrin polymerization process, and offer
physiologically relevant structural mechanistic
insights into this biologically important process at
the molecular and sub-molecular level. The results
of these studies can be potentially helpful in
translational research aiming at the computerbased design of fibrin-specific compounds (53)
that could attenuate the knob-hole interactions in a
desired fashion, or modify the final clot structure
so as to reduce the risk of thromboembolic
complications.

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
FIGURE LEGENDS
FIGURE 1. Ribbon structures of fibrin(ogen) (panel A), the A:a knob-hole bond (panels B and C), and
the B:b knob-hole bond (panels D and E). The structures correspond to the A:a knob-hole complex
(model system Aa1) and B:b knob-hole complex (system Bb1), respectively, at pH=7 and T=25°C. Panels
B and D: the interface of the A:a knob-hole complex (panel B) and B:b knob-hole complex (panel D), in
which the binding determinants – loop I (region I shown in blue), interior region (region II shown in
green), and moveable flap (region III shown in red) interact with peptides GPRP and GHRP (shown in
orange), respectively. Panels C and E: Simulation setup: the holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ are constrained through
fixing the C-termini of the γ chain (residue γGly160) and β chain (residue βVal205), respectively (see
Experimental procedures ). A constant pulling force f (represented by the black arrow) is applied to the
Pro4 residue of GPRP peptide and Pro4 residue of GHRP peptides in the direction perpendicular to the
binding interface to dissociate the knob-hole bond. Also shown are structural details of A:a and B:b knobhole bonds, in which residues in binding regions I-III in holes ‘a’ and ‘b’ establish binding contacts with
peptides GPRP and GHRP.
FIGURE 2. Kinetics of the forced dissociation of the A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes. The average
bond lifetimes (<τ>) with standard deviations for the A:a knob-hole complex (model systems Aa1-Aa4;
panel A) and for the B:b knob-hole complex (model systems Bb1-Bb4; panel B) as a function of pulling
force (f) are compared for different ambient conditions (pH=5 and pH=7 and T=25°C and T=37°C; see
Tables S1 and S2 in SD).
FIGURE 3. Dependence of kinetic pathways for forced dissociation of the A:a and B:b knob-hole bonds
on pH and temperature. Shown are the time-dependent profiles of the total number of binary contacts (Q)
stabilizing the A:a knob-hole complex for model systems Aa1 and Aa2 (panels A), and Aa3 and Aa4
(panel B), and stabilizing the B:b knob-hole complex for model systems Bb1 and Bb2 (panels C), and
Bb3 and Bb4 (panel D). The profiles of Q indicate two distinct dissociation pathways, the one-step
pathway of unbinding (B  U) from the bound state (B) to the unbound state (U) and the two-step
pathway of unbinding (B  I  U), in which formation of the intermediate state (I) occurs. The timedependent maps of binary contacts for A:a and B:b knob-hole bond complexes for different pH values and
temperature are presented in Figure S2 and S3 in SD, respectively.
FIGURE 4. Free energy landscape underlying the thermodynamics of A:a and B:b knob-hole interactions
in fibrin. The Gibbs free energy for unbinding ΔG for model systems Aa1 and Aa2 (panel A), and Aa3
and Aa4 (panel B), and for model systems Bb1 and Bb2 (panel C), and Bb3 and Bb4 (panel D) as a
function of knob-hole interaction range X are compared for different ambient conditions (pH=7 and
pH=5, and T=25°C and 37°C; see Tables S1 and S2 in SD). The standard deviations of ΔG are shown for
the knob-hole distance change ΔX = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 nm for the model systems
Aa1 and Aa3 (for the A:a knob-hole bond), and Bb1 and Bb3 (for the A:a knob-hole bond). The standard
deviations for systems Aa2 and Aa4, and Bb2 and Bb4 are even smaller. The values of the equilibrium
binding energy Gb, the width of the bound state Δx, and the distance between the bound state and
transition state x, shown in panel A, are given in Table II.
FIGURE 5. Computational reconstruction of the non-covalent coupling of the central nodule (bearing
sites ‘A’) and the -nodules (bearing sites ‘a’). Panel A: ribbon representation of the initial structure
(before equilibration) of the double-D fragment of abutted fibrin molecules containing two - and two nodules. The residues in site ‘a’ form binding contacts with the residues of site ‘A’ emanating from the
central nodule of the third fibrin monomer between the coiled-coil connectors. Panel B shows the
translocation of the central nodule following formation of the A:a knob-hole bonds observed at the end of
the simulation run. Also shown is the magnified view of electrostatic contacts between residues γGlu323
in loop I, γLys356 in interior region, and γAsp297 in moveable flap (all residues belong to site ‘a’ in the

γ-nodule), and residues Lys58, Asp61, and His67 in the N-terminal portion of the β chain in the
central nodule (GPR motif has been suppressed for clarity).
FIGURE 6. Comparison of the A:a knob-hole interactions in neutral solution (pH=7) at T=37°C (model
system Aa1; panel A) and T=25°C (model system Aa2; panel B). Shown are the ribbon structures of the
binding site ‘a’ interacting with the knob ‘A’. Color denotation: in hole ‘a’ -helices are shown in red
color, -strands are in blue color, and coils and turns are shown in grey color; knob ’A’ is displayed in
green color. Residues γ327-330 in loop I form an -helix at 25°C, but transition to a random coil structure
at 37°C. Interacting residues in loop I and GPRP are magnified below. The electrostatic coupling between
residue γTyr363, residues γGlu328, γGln329, and γAsp330 in loop I, and residue Arg3 in the GPRP
peptide is indicated.

Essential Dynamics: In Essential Dynamics implemented in the GROMACS package (1), the most
important displacements in a biomolecular system are described by a few “essential” degrees of freedom
forming the essential subspace. The remaining degrees of freedom represent less important fluctuations
(2). Dynamic correlations between the positions of amino acids at time t, x(t)={x1(t), x2(t),…, xN(t)} (N –
total number of residues), and the corresponding positions in the reference structure x0={x1(0), x2(0),…,
xN(0)} can be expressed through the covariance matrix C(t) = <M1/2(x(t) – x0)(M1/2(x(t) – x0))T>, where
<…> denotes the ensemble averaging and the superscript T represents the transposed matrix. By
construction, C is a symmetric matrix, which can be diagonalized by an orthogonal transformation T, C =
TTLT, where L is the matrix of eigenvalues and T is the matrix of eigenvectors. For a system of N
particles in the three-dimensional space, there are 3N-6 eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues
(excluding 6 degrees of freedom for translations and rotations). The eigenvalue LI in the center-of-mass
representation (I =1,2,…,N) is the amplitude of the I-th eigenvector tI along the displacement x(t) – x0.
The principal coordinates, pI(t), are obtained by projecting x(t) – x0 onto each eigenvector: p(t) =
TTM1/2(x(t) – x0). These projections are given by yI(t) = x0 + M1/2TTIpI(t) (2,3). To obtain the
displacements of each residue along a particular eigenvector, we calculated the root-mean-square
displacements RMSDkI = (CII/MII)1/2 = (1/MIIl(TTIkLklTlI))1/2 = (LkITkI2/MII)1/2, where index k runs over the
eigenmodes.
Umbrella Sampling: We calculated the potential of mean force for the force-driven dissociation of the
A:a and B:b knob-hole bond, G(X), as a function of the distance between the relevant residue in hole ‘a’
(hole ‘b’) and knob ‘A’ (knob ‘B’), X. The potential energy of the system depends on X (reaction
coordinate), which gradually changes during the simulation run, and one accumulates

E / X

at

several values of X. Then, G(X) can be estimated as G(X) =   EG /  X dX (4,5). Because X is also the
distance traveled by the cantilever tip,  G /  X corresponds to the restoring force F = κdX, i.e. the force
exerted on the tip by the ligand-receptor pair (κ is the cantilever spring constant and dX is the tip
displacement). Hence, measurements of F can be used to estimate  G /  X and to resolve G(X). In a
single run for each model system, we performed a total of 60 steps of simulation and collected 3000 data
points. In each step, the cantilever (base) was first moved by X = 0.5 Å and the system was equilibrated
for 100 ps. Next, the values of the current tip position were sampled for 50 ps to calculate the

2424

Mechanisms of knob-hole interactions in fibrin
biomolecular response F =  G /  X . We used a cantilever with the spring constant κ = 14 N/m. A total
of 5 independent runs have been used to perform ensemble averaging.

contacts between the amino acid residues in the hole ‘a’ and residues in the GPRP peptide (knob ‘A’
mimetic), obtained from the most representative trajectories of forced dissociation for model systems Aa1Aa4. Amino acid residues in the binding regions I, II, and III in the hole ‘a’, which participate in binding
interactions with the GPRP peptide under different environmental conditions are indicated (see Figure 1 in the
main text).

Figure S3: Time-dependent map of binary interactions stabilizing the B:b knob-hole complex under various
ambient conditions (pH and temperature; see Tables S1 and S2). Shown are the contact maps for binary
contacts between the amino acid residues in the hole ‘b’ and residues in the GHRP peptide (knob ‘B’
mimetic), obtained from the most representative trajectories of forced dissociation for model systems Bb1Bb4. Amino acid residues in the binding regions I, II, and III in the hole ‘b’, which participate in binding
interactions with the GHRP peptide under different solution conditions are indicated (see Figure 1 in the main
text).

Figure S4: Essential dynamics underlying the forced dissociation of the A:a knob-hole complexes under
various ambient conditions (pH and temperature; see Tables S1 and S2). Panels A-D show the profiles of the
first three most important modes of displacements of binding residues in hole ‘a’ (mode 1, 2, and 3), which
capture >90% of all the displacements accompanying forced unbinding for the A:a knob-hole complex, as a
function of the residue number (282-382) for model systems Aa1-Aa4, respectively. The “essential
dynamics spectra” are obtained from the most representative trajectories of forced dissociation.
Corresponding to displacement peaks are amino acid residues in the binding regions I, II, and III in the hole
‘a’, which participate in binding interactions with the GPRP peptide (see Figure 1 in the main text).

Figure S5: Essential dynamics underlying the forced dissociation of the B:b knob-hole complexes under
various ambient conditions (pH and temperature; see Tables S1 and S2). Panels A-D show the profiles of the
first three most important modes of displacements of binding residues in hole ‘b’ (mode 1, 2, and 3), which
capture >90% of all the displacements accompanying forced unbinding for the B:b knob-hole complex, as a
function of the residue number (342-442) for model systems Bb1-Bb4, respectively. The “essential

Figure S6. Structural transitions underlying forced dissociation of the A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes
under different ambient conditions (pH and temperature; see Tables S1 and S2). Structural snapshots magnify
the largest displacements in the binding interface, i.e. in binding regions I, II, and III (see Figure 1 in the main
text), for model systems Aa1–Aa4 (panels A-D) and Bb1–Bb4 (panels E-H). These displacements accompany
dynamic transitions from the bound state (B) to the globally unbound state (U). The types (modes) and
magnitude of displacements were resolved using the Essential Dynamics approach. The three most important
types of motion for the A:a and B:b knob-hole bond complexes (modes 1, 2, and 3) are profiled for different
values of pH and temperature in Figures S4 and S5, respectively.
