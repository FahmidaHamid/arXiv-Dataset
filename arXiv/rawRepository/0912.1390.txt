Abstract
Background: The pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) is a serious on-going global public crisis. Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental importance for both public health and scientific researches.
Recent studies have focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which strongly
depends on detailed information about the structure of social contacts, human traveling patterns and
biological activity of virus, etc.
Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf’s law and Heaps’ law. Similar scaling properties
were also observed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also
found a hierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to countries with
smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control effects on both the local growth and
transregional transmission, without the need of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in
detail the impact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the model and showed
that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical spreading properties observed in empirical data.
Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although strict control measures
for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in the regions without local cases, the focus should
be turned to local prevention after the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the
largest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the spreading. This work provided
not only a deeper understanding of the generic mechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases,
but also some practical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.

Introduction
A new global influenza pandemic has broken out. In the first three months, the epidemic spreaded to
over 130 countries, and more than 105 people were infected by the novel virus influenza A (H1N1). H1N1
represents a very serious threat due to cross-species transmissibility and the risk of mutation to new virus
with increased transmissibility. Several early studies paid attention to this public issue from different
perspectives [1–8], and made known important information such as the biological activity of H1N1 virus
and the patterns of early spreading. While every effort was taken to develop antiviral and vaccination
drugs, efficient reduction of the spreading could have already been achieved by interventions of population
contact. However, such interventions, like strict physical checking at the borders and enforced quarantine,

2
are costly and highly controversial. It is therefore difficult to decide the control strategies: when should
the schools be suspended and whether the border control should be reinforced or given up?
The detailed mechanism of transmission can differ significantly for different virus, the spreading
patterns, however, may display common regularities due to generic contacting processes and control
schemes. Many health organizations have collected large amount of information about the spreading of
H1N1. In-depth analysis of these data, together with what we have known for SARS [9,10], avian influenza
(H5N1) [11,12], foot-and-mouth epidemic [13,14] and some other pandemic influenza [15,16], may lead us
to a more comprehensive understanding of the common spreading patterns that do not rely on the detailed
biological features of virus. In this paper, we studied the spreading patterns of influenza pandemic by
both empirical analysis and modeling. Our main contributions were threefold: (i) The Zipf’s law of the
distribution of confirmed cases in different regions were observed in the spreading of H1N1, SARS and
H5N1; (ii) A simple model was proposed, which does not rely on the biological details but can reproduce
the observed scaling properties; (iii) The significant effects of control strategies were highlighted: the
strong control for interregional travel is responsible for the Zipf’s law and can sharply delay the outbreak
in the regions without local cases, while the focus should be turned to local prevention after the outbreak
of local cases. Our analysis provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between control and
spreading, which is very meaningful for decision makers.

Results
Empirical Results
We first analyzed the cumulative number ni of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 of each country i to a
given date (see the data description in Materials and Methods). Because
P ni is growing, the distributions
for different dates are normalized by the global total cases NT =
ni to the corresponding dates for
comparison. What we used in our analysis is the Zipf’s plots [17], which was obtained by sorting each
ni > 0 in a descending order, from rank 1 to the largest value M and plotting ni with respect to the rank
ri . We considered the normalized Zipf’s plot where each ni was replaced by its corresponding proportion
Pi = ni /NT . More discussion of the Zipf’s plot can be found in Materials and Methods. Table 1 shows
the ranking of the top 20 countries and their total of confirmed cases in five typical dates. Fig.1(a) and
1(b) report the Zipf’s plots for the distributions of normalized ni in different dates. The maximal rank
M corresponds to the number of regions with confirmed cases, which grows during the spreading. The
normalized distributions P surprisingly display scaling properties. Before the middle of May, P shows
clearly a power-law type P ∼ r−α with an exponent α changing around 3.0 (except the first data point,
see Fig. 1(a)). Although the total cases NT grows rapidly in this early stage, P for different dates seems
to follow the same line in the log-log plot. After the middle of May, the middle part of the distribution
grows more quickly, and meanwhile the virus spreads quickly to many more countries. In this stage the
exponent α of the left part of P steadily reduces from higher than 3.0 to 1.7 (see Fig. S3(b) in Supporting
Information), and an exponential tail emerges (Fig. 1(b)). After June 10, P can be well fitted by a
power-law function with an exponential tail, for example, P ∼ r−1.70 e−0.013r for the data of July 6 (solid
line, Fig. 1 (b)). The scaling properties are not special for H1N1, but quite common in various diseases,
such as SARS in 2003 (Fig. 1(c), α ≈ 2.7) and the bird cases of H5N1 in 2008 (Fig. 1(d), α ≈ 2.0),
although the spreading range is much more limited (to only about 30 countries).
There could be variations or errors in the real-world surveillance of H1N1, which may affect the ranking
of the countries. To examine the robustness of our analysis against such variations, we considered several
types of possible variation: (A) the variation is correlated with the reported total of cases in a country;
(B) the variation is correlated with the population of the country; and (C) the variation is correlated
with both the reported total of cases and the population of the country. We found that the form of
power-law-like distribution in Zipf’s plot is robust under these different types of variations (Fig. S1).This

3
analysis shows that our finding of the power-law-like form is still believable in the presence of variations
or errors in surveillance. The detailed discussion can be found in the Supporting Information.
Another scaling property which is often accompanied by Zipf’s law is the Heaps’ law [6,19,20]. Heaps’
law describes a sublinear growth of the number of distinct sets M (t) as the increasing of the total number
of elements NT (t) belonging to those sets, with the power -law form M ∼ NTλ . A detailed introduction
can be found in Materials and Methods. In the pandemic of H1N1, the number of infected countries M
and the global total confirmed cases NT obeys the Heaps’ law with the Heaps’ exponent λ ≈ 0.35 before
May 18, 2009 and λ ≈ 0.53 after May 18 (Fig. 2). The exponents of the Zipf’s law and the Heaps law
satisfy αλ ≈ 1, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis [21] that if an evolving system has a
stable Zipf’s exponent, its growth must obey the Heaps’ law with exponent λ ≈ 1/α (an approximate
estimation when α > 1: the larger the α, the more accurate the estimation).After May 18, the pronounced
exponential tail in the distribution P (Fig. 1(b)) leads to a deviation from strict Zipf’s law, and the two
exponents no longer satisfy the relationship λ ≈ 1/α.
We also found that broad distribution of ni is related to heterogeneity in different countries. Figs.
3(a) and 3(b) report the dependence between the number of confirmed cases ni and the population and
gross domestic product (GDP). A clearly hierarchical spreading pattern, similar to what were predicted
by some theoretical complex network models [22, 23], can be observed: the big and rich countries were
infected first, and then the disease spread out to the global world. This can be understood that bigger
and richer countries usually have more active population in international travel, and thus are of higher
risk to be new spreading origins in the early stage of epidemic. The evolution of correlations between the
confirmed cases ni and population and GDP was reported in Fig. 3(c) by the Kendall’s Tau τK . Kendall’s
Tau measures the correlations between two datesets which are strongly heterogeneous in magnitude. The
method to calculate τK was introduced in Materials and Methods. To test whether τK is significant,
we compared the value from original datasets to those from surrogate data by shuffling the order of the
population of GDP (see Supporting Information). Significantly positive correlations with a tendency of
increase with time can be observed (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S2). These results show that the interconnectivity
among world regions and human mobility are important factors that accelerate the spread of diseases
globally. The global total confirmed cases NT displays two phases of growth (Fig. 3(d)): in the early
stage NT increases with a high rate and then turns into a stable exponential growth with a much smaller
rate, with the transition occurring around the middle of May. Such a transition may reflect the changes
in the contacting rate among people due to imposed or self-adaptive control.
It is interesting to study whether and how the exponent α in the distribution P is related to the
well-known reporductive number R in mathematical epidemic theory. Employing the method in Ref. [1]
and the estimate of the mean serial interval of 3.2 days in Ref. [2, 3], we estimated, using the growth rate
in the stable growth period after the middle of May, that R is between 1.09 and 1.22 for the serial interval
in the range [1.9, 4.5] days. This range is slightly smaller than the results in several other estimations
based on the early spreading [4, 5], but generally in agreement with other studies based on the spreading
after the early outbreak [3]. As seen in Fig. S3(a) in Supporting Information, there is a rapid decrease of
R in the period before the middle of May. As we will show later in the model, the decrease of R could
be attributed to the control effects. Interestingly, the power-law exponent α of the distribution P has a
similar trend of evolution (Fig. S3(b)). An positive correlations can be found in the plot R vs. α for
the early stage when both of them are relative large. This relationship could be explained as follows. In
the early stage of spreading, R is effectively higher when surveillance and control schemes for H1N1 were
not very effective. On the other hand, only a small portion of the population was infected. In this stage,
local growth was quicker than transmission between countries, so that the reported number decreases
quickly with rank, corresponding to a larger α. However, a simple relationship between R and α is not
expected because α from the normalized distribution of a given date is related to the accumulated effects
of R before this date, especially in the later stage of spreading.
We also investigated the statistical regularities within a country. We compared the normalized dis-

4
tribution of confirmed cases in different states of USA and in different provinces of China (Fig. 4): P
of USA shows a much more homogeneous form with a large deviation from strict power-law distribution
while P of China is close to a power-law with exponent α = 1.79 ± 0.04 (the Zipf’s distribution of SARS
cases of different provinces of China is also a power-law type with exponent α ≈ 3 [28]).
We have investigated the growth of the number of confirmed cases ni for all the 13 countries with
ni > 103 until July 6, and found that the patterns are quite diverse. As shown in Fig. 5, some have a
clear transition in the middle of May from a rapid breakout to a stably exponential growth (e.g. U.S.A.
and Mexico), which is similar to the global growth patterns; some have much later initial infections (e.g.
Australia); some exhibit a stably exponential growth without a pronounced crossover (e.g. China); and
some show irregular growth curves (e.g. Japan and New Zealand). The spreading of H1N1 was impacted
by many factors, such as control measures, traffic systems, school terms, and so on, which could lead to
such diverse growth patterns under a stable global growth.
To summarize, the empirical results show that the scaling properties in epidemic spreading process
may widely exist at different regional levels and crossing various infectious diseases. In the following we
tried to obtain some insight into the generic mechanisms underlying these common properties.

Modeling and Simulation Results
The empirical results provoke some outstanding questions: how to understand the scaling properties in
region distributions, which factors lead to the different spreading patterns for different regions, and what
are the effects of control measures on the regional level spreading? We believed that the scaling properties
have the origin at the generic contact process underlying the transmission of diseases, and the variation
could result from the heterogeneity of the contact process in different diseases and regions. One most
important heterogeneity may be the control strength. To build a generic model incorporating the effects of
control, let us consider the actions taken by people when facing a serious epidemic spreading. In general,
individual people try to take many approaches to reduce the probability of infection, such as using
respirator, reducing the face-to-face social interactions, and disinfecting frequently. Meanwhile, many
organizations usually take measures to prevent the spreading of epidemic, such as physical examinations
in public transportation and schools, isolation for highly risky groups, and so on. If epidemic breaks out
in a country, other countries may reinforce the health examinations at the borders for the travelers from
that country. For example, in China, measurement of body temperature was used in many airports and
border crossings, and the identified infected persons and their close contacts were strictly isolated in the
early stage of H1N1 spreading. In Hong Kong, students had to measure body temperature and were not
allowed to go to school when the temperature was higher than a threshold. These actions of individuals
and social organizations can effectively change the structure of social contacts, reduce infection probability
and affect the spreading patterns of epidemic [29, 30]. Such effect of imposed or self-adaptive controlling
actions was the starting point of our model.
Different from many individual-based models, our model is in the regional level, so the detailed social
contact structure [9, 31, 32, 34, 35] as well as the control methods and strategies in individual level [36–38]
are not considered directly. Our scheme was based on the metapopulation framework. In this framework,
the global community is divided into a set of regions, each having its own spreading dynamics, but also
interacting with each other. This framework has been widely used in modeling epidemic spreading in the
last decade [39–43]. In our model, a region (such as a country) is denoted by a node in a network with K
nodes in total. Different from previous work considering details of transportation [9, 44] or mobility [45]
networks, the network is supposed to be fully-connected since in general there are direct contacts between
almost all countries in the world. However, the strength of connections between countries could be
different due to the heterogeneity in various factors, such as population and economics. As will be
shown later, while such heterogeneity has some impact on the epidemic spreading, the most important
ingredients are the strengths of control within and between regions. Therefore, instead of employing
the detailed information of real traffics, we generically denoted the international traffic of a node as its

5
strength si , and the weight of link between two node i and j is assumed to be symmetric and proportional
to the products of the strengths si and sj :
qij = si sj /

XK

k=1

sk .

(1)

The spreading at time t from node j to i is proportional to the number of infected cases nj of node
j, together with a time-varying effective weight wij (t) of the link, namely wij (t)nj (t). Here wij (t) is
related not only to the link strength qij , but also to the control strategy. Control measures are in general
reinforced on the travelers from countries with large number of infected cases, and thus in our model the
link weight is
(2)
wij (t) = qij nj (t)−β1 ,
where β1 is a free parameter. Effectively, we can take wij (t) = 0 if nj (t) = 0. Note that while qij
is symmetric, wij is in general asymmetric. This expression describes generically the effects of various
control measures at the borders, without relying on the details at the individual level.
In this model, the update of the number of cases ni of an arbitrary node i consists of two parts: a
local infection growth and the global traveling infections:

∆ni = ρ ai (t)ni (t) +

hsi
where ρ is a positive constant related to the basic transmissibility of the diseases, hsi, the average value
of si , is introduced for normalization, and the coefficient b denotes the relative contribution due to the
transmission from other regions. Note that ∆n is generally a real number while the real-world increment
of infected cases must be integral. Therefore, we round ∆n to the neighboring integer, namely to set
ni (t + 1) = ni (t) + [∆n] + 1 with probability p and ni (t + 1) = ni (t) + [∆n] with probability 1 − p, where
p = ∆n − [∆n] ([x] denotes the largest integer no larger than x).
The relative contribution by local infections, ai (t), is not constant, but reflects the strength of control
within a region. In the same vein as the border control in Eq. 2, we described the generic effects of local
control by decaying ai (t) as a function of ni with a free parameter β2 , namely

ni (t)−β2 , if ni (t)−β2 > g
(4)
ai (t) =
g,
if ni (t)−β2 ≤g.
Effectively, ai (t) = 0 if ni = 0. Here the decaying of ai is limited by a constant g (0 < g < 1), which
accounts for the necessary social contacts in the daily life even under the outbreak of the epidemic. In
reality, g is also related to the transmissibility and death rate of the disease.
In our model, ni is the total infected cases of a node. In reality, the reported and confirmed cases are
most likely a small part of the total cases. If we assume that the ratio of reported cases is similar for
different countries and roughly constant in time, the model can be used to describe the distribution of
confirmed cases without changing our conclusions in the following.
To focus on the effects of the control parameters β1 and β2 , we first considered the simplest case in
which si is uniform. In this case, qij = 1/K and Eq. (3) is reduced to the minimal model

The impact of the heterogeneity in si will be discussed later.
We would like to emphasize that the effect of control considered in our model does not refer in
particular to any of the specific control measures. Eqs. (2) and (4) are supposed to describe generically
the integrated effects of various intervention schemes, either imposed by govermental policies or selforganized by individuals. For example, the border control parameter β1 describes the integrated effect

6
of all the measures impacting on the spreading across different countries, and β2 not only includes the
impact of some official control measures, but also the impact of some adaptive individual actions, such
as reducing of social contact, and wearing gauze mask. All of our discussions of ”control” are based on
this extended meaning.
In the following, to represent a worldwide network of countries, the total number of nodes in our model
is K = 220. The model can also be used to represent the spreading within a county when regarding a
node as a region within a country and ignoring the transmission from other countries. From Eq. (3), the
parameter ρ does not affect the pattern of the normalized distribution P . ρ is thus fixed at 0.2 in all our
simulations, which is close to the fast growing rate of the influenza A in the early stage of outbreak (see
Fig. 3(d)). We quantified the epidemic spreading initiated randomly at one node by the spreading range
M (the number of nodes with ni > 0) and the total cases NT and investigate how they depend on the
control parameters β1 and β2 (Fig. 6). It is seen that both large β1 and large β2 can reduce the range of
spreading M , but the control on the interregional borders by β1 is more effective than β2 (Fig. 6(a)). On
the contrary, large β2 is much more effective than β1 to reduce the total number of cases NT (Fig. 6(b)).
The patterns in Fig. 6 are generic in the model for different parameters ρ, b and g and for different time
during the spreading. These results imply that once a country has local epidemic outbreaks, its growth
will be mainly driven by the local spreading but not the input of foreign cases.
The parameter space of β1 and β2 can be divided into four regimes, corresponding to the combinations of weak or strong and local or interregional controls, as indicated in Fig. 6. Typical normalized
distributions P obtained in the four regimes are compared in Fig. 7. When β1 is small (regimes (I) and
(II)), the epidemics can spread to almost all nodes in short time, and P is rather homogeneous. When
β1 is large (regimes (III) and (IV)), the spreading across different region is suppressed, and P is rather
inhomogeneous, manifested as a power-law-like form. Keeping β2 fixed, the exponent α clearly increases
with β1 and a larger β2 can slightly increase α further (inset, Fig. 7(a)). We have included a detailed
discussion of the time evolution of the distributions P and their association to the Heaps’ law in Fig. S5
of the Supporting Information.
While β1 has a sensitive impact on the interregional spreading and controls the heterogeneity of the
distribution P , β2 mainly affects the growth of total cases NT , especially in the early stage (Fig. 7(b)).
With stronger control at larger β2 , the fast growth of NT in the early stage will be effectively suppressed
and transformed to a slow exponential growth within shorter time. As seen in Eq. (4), β2 only affects
the growth of the epidemic in the very early stage after it appears in a region. The significant effect of
β2 on the growth of total cases NT emphasizes the importance of early epidemic control, in agreement
with the conclusion of previous studies on other diseases [13, 14].
Comparing the results from the four regimes, we can see that the spreading pattern in regime III
(large β1 and small β2 ) is closer to the empirical observations of influenza A. In this regime, the range of
α covers most of empirical results. For example, with β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 0.2, the distribution P can be
well fitted by a power-law function with exponent 1.67 (Fig. 7(a)), and this value is close to the empirical
exponent of influenza A on July 6 (Fig. 1(b)). Large β1 and small β2 is consistent with the real-world
situation. While more efficient to implement control measures on the borders, e.g., to identify infected
and suspected candidates and their close contacts for quarantine, it is much more difficult to get the same
efficiency for the same control schemes in local communities. The relative lower death rate of influenza
A is also likely to weaken the self-adaptive control and voluntary isolation of the individuals, leading to
insignificant change of the contact patterns (e.g., much weaker than SARS). All these will render a lower
efficiency in the local control, corresponding to a small β2 and a larger g.
Besides the two parameters β1 and β2 for the border and local control, the other two parameters b
and g related to interregional and local contact rates can also significantly affect the spreading processes.
The parameter b in our model denotes the relative strength of interregional transmission. Large flow of
interregional travels can also make the epidemic spread to most of the regions rapidly. As a result, the
distribution P becomes more homogeneous with decreasing α when b is larger; however, b has only a

7
slight impact on the growth pattern of NT (Fig. 8(a)).
The parameter g expresses the background local growth speed which cannot be further reduced due
to unavoidable social contacts even under the effect control measures. Under strong border control (large
β1 ), the number of infected cases ni is mainly determined by g, growing exponentially with the rate ρg
after an initial transient period, thus g has a very sensitive impact on the growth of the total number NT
(Fig. 8(b)). If g is large, earlier infected regions will have much more infected cases compared to later
infected regions, leading to an inhomogeneous distribution P . At smaller g, the earlier and later infected
regions do not differ very much in the number of infected cases, corresponding to more homogeneous
distribution P with decreasing α (Fig. 8(b)). Different from the case of weak border control (small β1 ),
homogeneous P here dose not mean the rapid spreading; on the contrary, it denotes the situation that
the infection in each country is in a low level.
All the above discussions are based on the minimal model where the diversity of the nodes and the
edges is ignored by assuming a uniform si . Now we study the impact of heterogeneous si and the effect
of target control on the spreading of disease. While previous investigations have focused overwhelmingly
on the impact of heterogeneity in the degree of complex networks [9, 22, 34, 35], here we study the effects
of the heterogeneity in the intensity of nodes and links in globally coupled networks. We first took the
real population of different countries as si in our model and investigate how does the initiation of the
disease in countries with different ranks of populations influence the global spreading. When the disease
starts in a country with a large si (Fig. 9(a), population rank Rini = 11 as Mexico), the disease spreads
out quickly and the spreading process displays a clear tendency from the node with large si to those with
small si as seen by the evolution of the scatter plot of ni (t) vs. si and the Kendall’s tau (Fig. 9(c)),
which reproduces the main features in the empirical data in Fig. 3. On the contrary, when the initiation
happens in a country with small population (Fig. 9(b), population rank Rini = 100 as Libya), the disease
is contained in the country where it is initiated for a period of time, and then the countries with the
largest populations get infected soon and become new centers of spreading. τK is around zero in the very
beginning when the diseases is contained and becomes negative when spreading to a few nodes with the
largest si and quickly shift to positive values when the new centers take the leading role in the spreading
Fig. 9(c)). The total cases NT grows much faster in the first case (Fig. 9(d)). We applied target control
in our model (see Material and Methods), and we found that strong control just on one or two nodes with
the largest si can sharply reduce the spreading by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 9(e)). This effect
is similar to target immunization of the hubs in degree heterogeneous complex networks [36]. Here the
results are shown for one realization of the simulation. The statistics over many realizations displayed
in Fig. S6 in the Supporting Information can evidently demonstrate the spreading from the nodes with
large si to those with small si . A more systematic analysis of the effects of node heterogeneity and target
control by considering a power-law distribution of si is included in the Supporting Information. We
find that even though the heterogeneity can accelerate the spreading (Fig. S7), the strength of control
plays the leading role to determine the patterns of spreading (Fig. S8). The spreading can be sharply
decelerated by reducing both the total cases NT and range M , when only a few nodes with the largest
si are in strong border control (Fig. S9).
Another extension of our model considers the diverse effects of control in different country to qualitatively explain the different growth patterns for different country shown in Fig. 5. We assume that
the parameters β1 and β2 are nonidentical and are randomly chosen between 0 and 1 for different nodes,
while we fix the other parameters. In reality, all the important parameters ρ, β1 , β2 , g, and b can be
different due to variation of contact structures (population, hygiene condition, culture, etc.) from country
to country. Here we did not intend to fit the model precisely to the real data, but rather to demonstrate
the concept and to prove the principle.
The results were summarized in Fig. 10 for two groups of nodes with early and late initial infections.
In each group, we consider four combinations of the parameters β1 and β2 . For the nodes where the
disease is initiated and got infected in the very beginning (Fig. 10 (a)), the other nodes are not infected

8
and there is no significant input, thus the growth patterns are dominantly determined by β2 . When β2
is close to 1, the local growth rate shifts quickly to ρg, corresponding to an exponential function without
a clear transition. A pronounced transition happens when β2 is close to zero and it takes a period time
for the local growth rate to settle down to ρg. The growth patterns of the late infected nodes depend
on both β1 and β2 (Fig. 10(b)): the transition to stably exponential growth is still determined by β2 ,
while larger β1 prevents the input from other nodes and makes ni smaller. In all the cases, the stable
growth rates are close to ρg (the slope ≈ ρg log10 e), therefore additional variation of ρg can account for
diverse exponential growth rates in the data. We can see that the basic growth patterns in empirical
data, i.e., with and without a pronounced transition, can be reproduced by different control parameters
in the model. The model, however, does not include strong non-stationary ingredients that could lead to
sudden increase of ni observed in a few countries in Fig. 5.
Fig. 10 also shows the corresponding NT in this model of diverse control parameters, which also
reproduce the feature of NT in the data. The behavior is similar if we further include the diversity in
the parameter g. We would like to point out that the growth patterns of ni in the individual nodes with
different parameters are similar to various growth patterns of the global total NT in the model without
diversity in parameters. This provides justification that we can apply our model to the global level where
each node represents a country, or to the level within a country where each node denotes a state/province.
In the later case, NT of the model represents the growth of the total cases of a country and is consistent
with the growth of ni in the former case when similar interregional parameters β2 and g are considered
in both level, namely the model at different level will provide consistent conclusion about the epidemic
spreading.
To summarize, power-law distribution of P with large exponent α appears in situations with large
β1 , small b and large g. This regime corresponds to the real situations that the epidemic control for the
travelers is strong, the interregional contact is much weaker compared to that in local communities, and
the change of local social contacts by the disease is not very significant. The epidemic control for the
interregional travelers (large β1 ) is the most important condition for the emergence of the power-law type
of P , since the power-law distribution cannot be generated when β1 is close to zero no matter what other
parameters are.

Discussion
The statistics of region distributions of several pandemic diseases, including H1N1, SARS and bird cases
of H5N1 display obvious scaling properties in the spreading process at different levels. We studied the
origin of such scaling properties with a model of epidemic spreading at the regional level that incorporates
the generic effects of intervention and control measures without the need of the structure details of social
contacts and the particularity of the transmission of the diseases. Such a model is then able to capture the
general principles underlying epidemic spreading and to reveal the generic impact of control measures. We
elucidated that strict epidemic control on interregional travellers plays an important role in the emergence
of the scaling properties.
The results of the model can cover the empirical statistics of H1N1 on both the region distribution
and the growth of total cases, and are also consistent with the region distributions of SARS and H5N1.
In particular, the exponent α of the empirical distribution P of H1N1 is about 3.0 in the early stage and
changes to 1.7 on July 6, 2009, and α is about 2.7 for SARS and 2.0 for H5N1. In the stable spreading
period, the α of H1N1 is smaller than SARS and H5N1. According to the understanding from our model,
larger α indicates that the control measures are more strict and effective. This is in agreement with the
situation in SARS and H5N1 spreading. Because of high death rate and strong infection capability, SARS
gave rise to strong social panic and attracted attentions from citizens to governments in the countries with
outbreaks, such as China, and strict control measures were enforced in each public transportation systems
and in daily life of people. As for H5N1, many efficient control measures were also taken to prevent the

9
spreading, such as immunity for poultry and culling of livestock, etc. Large α in the early stage of
the spreading of H1N1 could be related to stronger control effect due to overrating of the mortality of
H1N1. Empirical results also showed that the distribution P of H1N1 in USA is more homogeneous than
in China. While there are probably several factors contributing to this difference, but the most obvious
difference is in the control measures. China took strict control policies, such as entry screening at airports
and border crossings, and enhanced surveillance of outpatients and inpatients with influenza-like illness,
enforced quarantine and isolation for identified infected persons and the close contacts, which are not so
strict compared to those during the SARS spreading, but are stronger than USA.
Our main findings, i.e., interregional control mainly affects the spreading range and the form of the
region distributions while local control sensitively impacts the growth of total cases, provide us a picture
of epidemic control. For regions that have no or only a few local infected persons, strict control measures
for interregional travellers can delay the local outbreaks significantly, but if there are large number of
local cases, these control methods for travellers are not so important. Instead, control methods and
treatment for local communities will be much more helpful. After the Summer of 2009, the focal point of
the control policies for H1N1 of many countries turned to the treatment for infected persons. According
to the conclusions of the present model, this strategy shift is reasonable. This model also indicates that
the diversity of different regions will accelerate the spreading. Efficient prevention of the spreading could
be achieved by enhanced control measures, especially for the giant regions. Further work will be focusing
on the impact of target [8] or voluntary vaccination [46].
In summary, a simple physical model basing on the abstraction of the generic contact processing and
the effects of control can provide meaningful understanding of the scaling properties commonly observed
in various pandemic diseases. It deepens our understanding of the relationship between the strength of
control and the spreading process, and provides a meaningful guidance for the decision maker to adopt
suitable control strategies.

Data Description

The cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 of each country is available from the
website of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert of World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/),
which started from April 26 to July 6, and updated each one or two days. Each update is in a new webpage,
for example, the data in May 21 is shown in the webpape (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009 05 21/en/
index.html). After July 6, WHO stopped the update for each country since the global pandemic has
broken out.
Table 1 lists the countries with the rank of confirmed cases up to 20 in several typical dates. The
corresponding total of confirmed cases is shown after the country name in the table. A complete list of
the data in these typical dates can be found in Supporting Information.
The data for SARS and H5N1 are respectively available from the websites of WHO (http://www.
who.int/csr/sars/country/en/index.html) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)(http:
//www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease) respectively. The data for H1N1 cases of different states
of USA is available on the website of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.
gov/h1n1flu/), and the data of different provinces of China is available from Sina.com (http://news.sina.
com.cn/z/zhuliugan/). The data for populations and GDPs of different countries are obtained from English Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of countries by population) and (http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/List of countries by GDP). There are three different lists of GDPs and what we used here is
the one from the World Bank, which includes 182 countries. Among the 135 countries having reported
the confirmed H1N1 cases until July 6, 22 of which do not have GDP data. They are all small countries
and the number of confirmed cases in these countries is also quite few (the total of the 22 countries are

10
163 until July 6). We thus ignore them in evaluating the correlation in Fig. 3(c).

0.2

Zipf’s Law and Power Law

Zipf’s plot is widely used in the statistical analysis of the small-size sample [17], which can be obtained
by first rearranging the data by decreasing order and then plotting the value of each data point versus
its rank. The famous Zipf ’s law describes a scaling relation, z(r) ∼ r−α , between the value of data point
z(r) and its rank r. As a signature of complex systems, the Zipf’s law is widely observed [47,48]. Indeed,
it corresponds to a power-law probability density function p(z) ∼ z −β with β = 1 + α1 .
The Heaps’ law [6] is another well-known scaling law observed in many complex systems, which
describes a sublinear growth of the number of distinct sets M (t) as the increasing of the total number of
elements NT (t) belonging to those sets, with the power -law form M ∼ NTλ . Recent empirical analysis
[19, 20] suggested that the Heaps’ law and Zipf’s law usually coexist. Actually, Lü et al. [21] proved that
if an evolving system has a stable Zipf’s exponent, its growth must obey the Heaps’ law with exponent
λ ≈ 1/α (an approximate estimation when α > 1: the larger the α, the more accurate the estimation).

0.3

Kendall’s Tau

In the empirical analysis, the numbers of confirmed cases, populations and GDPs for different countries
are very heterogeneous, covering several orders of magnitude (e.g., the population of China is about
2 × 104 times larger than that of Dominica). Thus the classical measurement like the Pearson coefficient
is not suitable in analyzing the correlations. We therefore use the rank-based correlation coefficient
→
→
named Kendall’s Tau. For two series −
x = {x1 , x2 , · · · , xm } and −
y = {y1 , y2 , · · · , ym }, the Kendall’s Tau
is defined as [49]
X
2
sgn[(xi − xj )(yi − yj )],
(6)
τK =
m(m − 1) i<j
where sgn(x) is the signum function, which equals +1 if x > 0, -1 if x < 0, and 0 if x = 0. τK ranges from
→
→
→
→
+1 (exactly the same ordering of −
x and −
y ) to -1 (reverse ordering of −
x and −
y ), and two uncorrelated
series have τK ≈ 0.

0.4

On Power-Law Fitting

Most of the distributions P generated by simulations of our model with large β1 (≥ 0.6) trend to a
power-law-like type after several steps of evolution. In the fittings of simulation results, we firstly judge
if the curve of P in this range is power-law-like. If yes, we fit the curve by linear function in log-log plots
in using least square fit method to get the fitting parameters. The range of the power-law fittings is from
2 to 50. If there is obvious deviation from power-law in this range, we do not use power-law to fit the
curve. The only exception is the distribution P when b = 0.02 in Fig. 8(a), where the range is from 1
to 30, because the cut-off appears at rank = 30 due to slow spreading of the disease. All the power-law
fitting results in the model does not show the error-bar (e.g., the dependence of α on various parameters
of the model), because the fitting error on the power-law exponent is far less than the value of α for most
cases after 104 averages (e.g., α = 1.666 ± 0.003 when β1 = 0.8, β2 = 0.2, ρ = 0.2, b = 0.06 and g = 0.2
in the minimal model).

0.5

Target Control

When si is highly heterogeneous, the nodes with the largest si will have the largest number of interregional
travels in our model and have high probability to spread the disease. Target control on such nodes may
efficiently reduce the spreading. To investigate the impact of the target control, we rank si in the

11
descending order, and put the first Rm nodes in the ranking series as the targets of strong border control.
In particular, we take β1 > 0 in Eq. (2) for the first Rm nodes with the largest si and β1 = 0 for the
others.

Supporting Information
The robustness of Zipf’s distribution
In the surveillance of H1N1 spreading process of each countries, many reasons can lead to the deviation of
the reported number of confirmed cases from real number. The ranks of the real number could be different
from those of the reported number for some countries. Here we discuss the impact of this deviation on
Zipf’s plots, and our results show that this impact is slight on the power-law-like distribution of the
reported number.
′
Let us denote the real total number of cases of the ith country as ni = ni + εi , where the positive
value εi represents the error or variation in surveillance of the country. It is reasonable to assume that
εi could be related to ni or the population Mi of a country. We consider three types of assumptions on
such variation as follows: Type A, the variation is correlated with the reported total of cases, namely
εi = σni η, where η is a positive random number and obeys the right-part standard Gaussian
distribution;
P
n
Type B, the variation is correlated with the population of the country, so εi = σMi ( P i Mii )η, where Mi
i
denotes the population of the country; Type C, the variation is correlated
total
P with both the reported
P
i ni
i ni
P
P
of cases and the population of the country, and we assume εi = σni Mi ( ni Mi )η. The terms
Mi and
P
P i ni
i ni Mi

i

i

are introduced for the purpose of normalization so that σ value in the three cases are comparable.
′

The Zipf’s distribution of ni for these three types of variations are compared to the original distribution
in Fig. S1 (a), (b), (c), respectively, for various σ values. While the variation proportional to population
(Type B) can result in some deviation of the distribution from the original one, the other two types has
no obvious impact on the distribution even though the average variation magnitude σ is large. This result
indicate that the power-law-like distribution in Zipf’s plot is robust under the variation in Type A and
C.

Statistical testing of Kendall’s Tau
In this paper, the correlations between the total of confirmed cases of different countries and the populations or GDP of these countries are expressed by the value of Kendall’s Tau τK . Here we test the
significance of τK against the finite number of data points.
According to the algorithm of Kendall’s Tau, τK ≈ 0 for two completely uncorrelated serials, however,
a non-zero value could be obtained due to the small number of countries with reported cases, especially
′
in the early stage of the spreading. To test the significance of the original τK , we compare it to τK from
surrogate data where the series of the population or GDP of the corresponding countries is randomly
′
shuffled. We can obtain a distribution of τK for the surrogate for many realizations, and such a distribution
′
is normal-like around τK = 0. From this distribution, we can obtain the 95% significance levels. If the
original τK is out of these levels, then there is less than 5% of possibility that the original τK is due to
coincidence in finite size uncorrelated series. Note that, in the early stage of May, there are just very few
countries with reported cases. The number of shuffling realizations in the surrogate data is too small to
′
obtain a reliable distribution of τK .
′
Fig. S2 shows the comparison between τK and the distribution of τK . While in the early stage
(before May 22) we cannot reject the null hypothesis with very high confidence that the two series are
uncorrelated, τK is clearly significant afterwards for both the population and GDP.

Estimation of the reproductive number R in global level
As shown in the main text (Fig. 3(d)), the growth of the global total of confirmed cases after the middle
of May can be well fitted by a straight line with a slope 0.021 in semi-log plots, namely, the growth follows

25
a stable exponent form exp(λt) with a daily rate, λ = 0.021 × ln(10) = 0.048. In our estimation of the
reproductive number R, we assumed that all the population is susceptible, and thus R = R0 , where R0
is the basic reproductive number. We used the formula in Ref. [1], R = 1 + V λ + f (1 − f )(V λ)2 , where
f is the ratio of the infectious period to the serial interval, and V is the mean serial interval, the sum of
the mean infectious and mean latent periods. According to Ref. [2, 3], the serial interval was estimated
to be in a range with mean 3.2 days and standard deviation 1.3 days. Therefore, the range of the serial
interval V is set between 1.9 and 4.5 in our estimation. Assuming f = 0.7 or 0.3 [1], the reproductive
number R changes from 1.09 to 1.22 when V increases 1.9 days to 4.5 days (Insert in Fig. S3). This
range of R value is slightly less than the ranges obtained in several other researches based on the early
period [4, 5], but in agreement with the results obtained from the data in the summer of 2009 [3].
We also investigated the evolution of the reproductive number R in the pandemic Influenza A (H1N1)
( Fig. S3 (a)). The daily growth rate λ are obtained from the growth of total of confirmed cases in each
two or three days. The estimated value of R is higher than 4 in the last a few days in April and then
sharply reduces to a normal value between 1.0 and 1.4 after the middle of May. This reduction of R may
reflects the effect of various control and intervention schemes.
Interestingly, the evolution of the estimated reproduction number R is related to the Zipf’s distribution
P . As seen in Fig. S3(b), during the period when R sharply reduces (before the middle of May), the
exponent α of P keeps in a higher level between 2.8 and 3.7. From the middle of May to July, α steadily
declines from higher than 3 to 1.7 while R trends to stable. R and α appear to be positively correlated
in the early stage of pandemic (insert in Fig. S3(b)).

Evolution of the reproductive number R in our model
The evolution of the reproductive number R estimated from the growth of NT in our model is compared
with R estimated from real data. For the comparison, the time scale in our model is rescaled by the
following method: Firstly, we find two times t1 and t2 in the growth curve of NT in the model to satisfy
NT (t1 ) ≈ 38 and NT (t2 ) ≈ 94512. The numbers 38 and 94512 are the global total of conformed cases
in April 26 and July 6, respectively. There are 71 days form April 26 to July 6, thus we assume the
length of one time step in our model is corresponding to t271
−t1 days. Consequently, the growth rate of
each time step in our model is λ(t) = [ln(NT (t)) − ln(NT (t))](t2 − t1 )/71. From the growth rate λ(t),
the reproductive number R(t) can be obtained as in the real data. As shown in Fig. S4, in our typical
parameter settings (β1 = 0.8, β2 = 0.2, b = 0.06 and g = 0.2), the evolution of R also shows a rapid
decrease: R changes from the range between 1.7 and 3.0 to the range between 1.1 and 1.4, and generally
in agreement with our empirical estimation of R.

The evolution of Zipf’s distribution P vs. the Heaps’ plots in the model
The empirical results in Fig. 1(b) in the paper indicates that the Zipf’s plot converges to a stable
distribution before the range of spreading M reaches saturation. The convergence to a stable distribution
is inherent in our model. Let us consider a few nodes in the model with the largest ni . The growth ni
in such nodes is mainly determined by the local growth rate ρg, ni (t + 1) ≈ (1 + ρg)ni (t), since the

27
number of infected case due to input from other nodes is much smaller and can be neglected and the local
growth has shifted to a stable rate due to local control in Eq. 4. When considering a power-law Zipf’s
distribution at time t, Pt (r) ∼ r−α , the total global cases NT are mainly contributed by these nodes
with the largest ni , i.e., NT (t + 1) ≈ (1 + ρg)NT (t). Thus the normalized distribution at t + 1 for these
nodes is Pt+1 (r) = ni (t + 1)/NT (t + 1) ≈ ni (t)/NT (t) ∼ r−α which is invariant vs. time. This analysis is
confirmed by the evolution of P at various parameters in Fig. S5(a-d). We can see that the distributions
P at different time overlap for the nodes with the smallest ranks r. The range of the forepart of the curve
of P which can be well fitted by power-law extends along with the time evolution, and the cut-off tail
will move to large ranks r till it reaches the system size K.
In our model, the scaling property in the distribution P is mainly contributed by large β1 . An
extreme situation is that β1 > 0 and β2 = 0, namely, the effect of local control is ignored (the parameter
g does not have any impacts). In this case, ni (t + 1) ≈ (1 + ρ)ni (t) for the nodes with the largest ni
and NT (t + 1) ≈ (1 + ρ)NT (t). P converges quickly to a power-law distribution when β1 is large (Fig.
S5(a)), and the exponent α is quite large because ni of early infected nodes grow very fast, leading to a
heterogeneous distribution. On the other hand when β2 is large enough, the growth of ni and NT will
shift quickly to a stable rate ρg and P again converges to a power-law distribution. α is significantly
smaller than that at β2 = 0 because the local control reduces significantly the growth rate of the early
infected nodes, and ni is not as heterogeneous. The stronger the control, the slower the growth of the
newly infected nodes, and the more heterogeneous the distribution. Therefore, the convergent exponent
α becomes larger when β2 increases. When β2 is small, it takes a long period of time for infected nodes
to achieve an stable exponential growth and consequently it takes many steps for P to converge.
In the discussions of the results of our model, the evolution time of the model generally is set as
300 steps, because in the parameter settings in our discussion, most of the P distributions can show
long range of power-law part and the exponent of the power-law part trends to stable after 300 steps of
evolution.
From Fig. S5(a-d) we can also see that the distribution at a given time t has a cut-off at the range
of spreading, i.e. r = M (t). At this point, we have P (r) ≈ 1/NT (t) the last infect countries usually just
has one or a few cases. When α is large (e.g., Fig. S5(a)), as an approximation we can assume that the
power-law distribution P (r) ∼ r−α extends to the cut-off point, i.e., P (r) ≈ 1/NT (t) ∼ M −α (t); and we
get M ∼ NTλ where λ = 1/α, implying that the Heaps’ law [6] can be observed in the process (similar
analysis could be found in [7], while for more accurate estimation, please see Ref. [8]). The Heaps’ plots
corresponding to the Zipf’s plots in Fig. S5(a-d) are shown in Fig. S5(e-g). We can see that the fitting
exponents satisfy λα ≈ 1 as expected from the analysis. The Heaps’ plots also manifest the saturation
of M when NT becomes very large.

Fig. S5. Upper panel (a-d): Evolution of the normalized Zipf’s distributions P at different time steps of the
model for various β2 . The other parameters are β1 = 0.8, b = 0.06, ρ = 0.2 and g = 0.2. All the data are average
over 104 independent runs. Lower panel (e-h): Dependence between M and NT (Heaps’ plot) generated by the
model for different β2 , corresponding to the distributions P shown in (a)-(d), respectively.

Effects of heterogeneity in si
In the paper we discuss the effect of heterogeneity in si by taking si as the population of a country. Fig.
9 in the paper shows the evolution of the dependence between ni (t) and si in one realization of the model
simulation when the disease is initiated at two countries with population rank Rini = 11 and Rini = 100,
respectively. Fig. S6 displays the statistics over many realizations: (a) and (b) show the probability
density function in the space (log10 si , log10 ni ) with color scale and (c) and (d) are the time evolution
of the total cases NT and the Kendall’s Tau, corresponding to Fig. 9 in the paper. In the early stage,
the initiation position is the center of spreading, but shortly, the nodes with the largest si become the
super-spreaders. The spreading from the nodes with large si to those with small si becomes very evident
in this presentation.

Fig. S6. Evolutions of the probability density in the space (log10 si , log10 ni ) obtained from 104 realizations of
simulations with the epidemic initiation at node with population rank Rini = 11 (a) and Rini = 100 (b). The
corresponding growth of NT (t) (c) and evolution of Kendall’s Tau τK between ni (t) and si (d) averaged over all
the realizations. Simulations run on β1 = 0.8, ρ = 0.2, b = 0.06, and g = 0.2.

In the following we carry out a more systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneous si and target
control by considering power distributions of si , i.e., P (s) ∼ s−γ . Two spreading processes are compared.
The first one is the situation without any control impacts, namely β1 = 0 and β2 = 0. In the second
situation we consider strong border control (β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 0.2, typical parameter setting introduced
in Fig. 7 in the paper).
Without control, the spreading is very fast even in the case of uniform si . Simulation results indicate
that increased heterogeneity at smaller γ sharply accelerates the spreading by increasing the total cases
NT in all the spreading period (Fig. S7(a)). The impact of heterogeneity on the spreading range M varies
in different periods of the spreading: for stronger heterogeneity (smaller γ), M is larger in the early stage,
but smaller in the later stages (Fig. S7(b)). With control, the spreading is significantly suppressed (e.g.,
compare t = 100 in panel (c) to t = 60 in panel (a)), and the acceleration by the heterogeneity is weaker:
NT does not increase so strongly when γ is smaller (Fig. S7(c)), while M displays similarly non-monotonic
but relatively stronger dependence on γ (Fig. S7(d)). The non-monotonic impact of heterogeneity on M

30
can be understood as follows. When si become rather heterogeneous, the epidemic will rapidly arrive at
the nodes with large si when initiated at a random node (see Fig. S7(b)), so M is larger at smaller γ
in the early stage. Then the epidemic mainly grows in these a few early infected nodes with the largest
si and the majority of nodes with small si have rather weak connections between them, which makes
the spreading to new nodes more difficult, even though the total cases NT is larger. In the situations
with control, the spreading from these nodes having the largest si and ni to the nodes with small si is
further reduced. As a result, the non-monotonic impact on M is more obvious in the situations with
control. The enhanced spreading by the heterogeneity, however, only makes the distribution P slightly
more homogeneous (Fig. S8).

Fig. S7. Impacts of node heterogeneity (γ) on the total cases NT and range M of the epidemic spreading without
control (panels (a) and (b): β1 = 0 and β2 = 0) and with control (panels (c) and (d): β1 = 0.8 and β2 = 0.2).
Note the different scales in the y-axes of (a) and (c). The simulations run on ρ = 0.2, b = 0.06, and g = 0.2. All
of data are averaged from 104 independent runs.

The comparison of these heterogeneous networks with the minimal models show that while strong
heterogeneity in the nodes (countries) could be an accelerating factor, just like the effect of the heterogeneous degree distribution of complex networks [9], the strengths of control play a leading and dominant
role in determining the epidemic spreading patterns. In fact, the impact of strong heterogeneity can be
compensated with slightly increased border control parameter β1 .

Fig. S9. (a) and (b): Total cases NT and range M vs. Rm , the number of nodes with target border control
(β1 = 0.8 for the Rm nodes with the largest si , and β1 = 0 for others). Simulations run on γ = 2.0, β2 = 0.2,
ρ = 0.2, b = 0.06, and g = 0.2. (c) and (d): as in (a) and (b), but with target local control (β2 = 0.2 for the Rm
nodes with the largest si , and β2 = 0 for others). Simulations run on γ = 2.0, β1 = 0.8, ρ = 0.2, b = 0.06. All of
data are obtained at t = 100 and averaged from 104 independent runs.

Generally speaking, the nodes with large intensity on heterogeneous structures usually are the keys
towards the dynamics of the system. We have applied the target control to the first Rm nodes with the
largest si . The spreading can be sharply decelerated by reducing both the total cases NT and range M
(Fig. S9(a) and (b)), when only a few nodes with the largest si are in strong border control (setting
β1 > 0 for the first Rm nodes and β1 = 0 for the others). Similar impact can also be observed with
target local control on the same nodes (setting β2 > 0 for the front Rm nodes and β2 = 0 for others, see

32
Fig. S9(c) and (d)). In this case, infection in those nodes with β2 = 0 grows very fast (with a rate ρ)
and the control on a few nodes does not reduce the total NT very significantly. However, M is clearly
reduced because the nodes with the largest si are usually the centers of spreading in the early stage and
the target control within these nodes will retard the spreading to other nodes. These impacts of control
on the nodes with large si are quite similar to the targeted immunization strategy on hubs notes with
the largest degrees in scale-free networks [10]. Therefore, the heterogeneity could be employed to prevent
the spreading with target control strategies, and the target control over a few nodes can save the overall
cost of control.
