We demonstrate simultaneous measurements of DNA translocation into glass nanopores using ionic current
detection and fluorescent imaging. We verify the correspondence between the passage of a single DNA
molecule through the nanopore and the accompanying characteristic ionic current blockage. By tracking the
motion of individual DNA molecules in the nanocapillary perpendicular to the optical axis and using a model,
we can extract an effective mobility constant for DNA in our geometry under high electric fields.
Since the seminal work on DNA translocations by
Kasianowicz et al.1 , there has been an explosion of interest in nanopore based DNA sensing using both solid
state and biological nanopores. The basis of nanopore
detection is the resistive pulse technique, whereby the
presence of a DNA molecule within the pore reduces the
flow of ions through the pore. Recent advances in the
field such as the devlopment of hybrid2 , DNA origami3,4
and graphene nanopores5,6 , lipid based coating7,8 as well
as the combination with other single molecule techniques
such as optical tweezers9 have greatly enhanced the sensing capabilities of nanopores.
Where nanopores have been combined with single
molecule fluorescence, this has been done with the aim
of developing alternative DNA sequencing techniques10 .
Previous work has also used single molecule fluorescence
for hydrodynamic studies in nanochannels11 . In this paper, we demonstrate simultaneous ionic current and fluorescent detection of DNA translocation through glass
nanocapillaries. These have been shown to be an alternative to traditional solid state nanopores12 . We have
extended this system by combining ionic current detection with single molecule fluorescence imaging and have
shown by direct visual observation that the drop in ionic
current does in fact correspond to the transient blockade
of the pore by the DNA molecule. By tracking the movement of the λ DNA molecules into the nanocapillary we
are also able to extract an effective mobility constant for
long DNA molecules.
Figure 1(a) shows a schematic of the custom built
setup for combined fluorescence and ionic current detection. As described previously12 , a nanocapillary is produced from quartz capillaries of outer diameter 0.5 mm
and inner diameter 0.2 mm (Sutter) using a commercial
laser puller (Sutter, P2000). This is assembled into a
PDMS chip where it connects two reservoirs filled with
an electrolyte solution. For the experiments described in
this paper we use 100 mM KCl in 100 mM citrate buffer
at pH 4.6. The Ag/AgCl electrode within the nanocapil-

lary is held at a constant positive potential with reference
to the ground electrode in the reservoir surrounding the
nanocapillary. An amplifier (HEKA, EPC 800) detects
the ionic current flowing through the nanocapillary at a
bandwidth of 5 kHz. Negatively charged DNA translocates into the nanocapillary which results in characteristic blockades in the ionic current. The I-V curve for
the nanocapillary (diameter ∼ 50 nm) used for all experiments described in this paper is shown in Figure 1(a).
The λ DNA stock solution (Fermentas, 0.3 mg/ml,
48502 bp) is diluted to 10 pM in the buffer solution and
incubated with 50 nM solution of the DNA intercalating
dye SYTOX Orange (Invitrogen), following a protocol
described in Yan et al.13 to obtain a dye:DNA base pair
ratio of ∼1:10. The dye molecules are excited by emissions from a 532 nm laser (Laser Quantum) operating at
< 5mW. A long pass dichroic mirror at 532 nm (Semrock
Filters) directs the excitation light to the rear of a 60x
objective (UPLSAPO NA=1.2, Olympus). The fluorescence emission from the dye molecules is collected via the
same objective. As it is red shifted from the excitation
light, it passes through the dichroic mirror and is focused
via a mirror and a tube lens to the sensor of a fast electron multipying CCD (EMCCD) camera (Andor iXON3
860). We are able to perform imaging of the translocation processes at a maximum frame rate of 510.2 fps.
A bright field image of the nanocapillary used is shown
as a top inset in Figure 1(a) and corresponds to images
shown in Figure 1(b). Data acquisition for both ionic
current and fluorescence images is done through custom
software written in LabVIEW and a DAQ card (PCIe6351, National Instruments). We use low salt concentrations to reduce non-specific interactions between the
dye molecules and the surface of the nanocapillaries. At
pH=4.6, the surface charge on the glass is reduced and
this reduces the electroosmotic flow in the nanocapillary.
A typical result is shown in Figure 1(b). λ DNA
molecules are attracted into the nanocapillary by applying a potential difference of 800 mV. Three images from
a video are shown that correspond directly to the single λ DNA translocation detected by the resistive pulse
technique (indicated by a red box). We set t = 0 about
5 ms before the the ionic current event. In the first image (t = 3 ms) the DNA molecule under consideration is

set in Figure 1(b). It also demonstrates that the current
blockade corresponds to only a very brief period (<1 ms)
when the molecule is right at the tip.

translocation into the nanocapillary which is accompanied by the ionic current blockade. Finally, we are able
to track the DNA molecule upstream into the nanocapillary as shown in the third image (t = 66 ms). See supplementary material at [URL will be inserted by AIP]
for a video of several translocation events and the corresponding ionic current trace. Our results unambiguously
verifies a direct correspondence between translocation of
a DNA molecule through the nanocapillary with the ionic
current events detected in typical nanopore experiments.
A close-up of the ionic current event is shown as an in-

To determine whether the presence of the intercalating dye molecules was significantly altering the behaviour
of the DNA molecules, we detected many ionic current
translocation events. Statistics from the ionic current detection at an applied potential of 800 mV is presented
in Figure 2. A feature of translocation of long DNA
molecules through nanopores of diameter 10 nm or more
is the detection of multiple levels in the ionic current
traces due to the DNA molecule folding over itself during
translocation. These have also previously been detected
with nanocapillaries12 . In Figure 2(a), we present three
representative translocation events that show two folding
levels. This observation is consistent with the mechanical
properties of DNA not being altered by the presence of
intercalating dye molecules14 .
An analysis of each translocation event is presented
as a scatter plot in Figure 2(b). The majority of events
have a duration between 0.4 ms - 1.2 ms which is consistent with our previous work on nanocapillaries. However,
there are some events with mean amplitudes clustered
around 20 pA. This is lower than expected and indicates
DNA degradation in the presence of the intercalating dye
and continuous laser irradiation. We therefore choose to
ignore these points by imposing conditions of minimum
duration and amplitude on the translocation events. A
histogram of these events in Figure 2(c) filtered using
this cutoff presents further evidence of the folding levels.
There is a broad peak centred at 55 pA indicating DNA

degradation and folding.
We analysed the videos obtained simultaneously with
ionic current data presented. Due to the horizontal geometry of the nanocapillaries, the DNA molecules translocate perpendicular to the optical axis. This enables us
to track them up to 16 µm upstream of the pore. Tracks
were obtained for multiple DNA molecules for a range
of applied potentials. For the sake of clarity, tracks for
just three voltages are presented in Figure 3(a). The
tracking was performed with custom written software in
LabVIEW. The schematic in the upper left corner of the
figure explains the coordinate system used. We identify
x = 0 with the nanocapillary tip and t with the time
elapsed since the start of translocation by the DNA at
x = 0.

as it moves up the nanocapillary. The distance moved in
a fixed time depends on the applied voltage. The latter
effect is clearly due to the fact that the DNA velocity is
proportional to the electric field, which in turn, is proportional to the current. This is easily verified by plotting
the distance traveled in a fixed time interval (we choose
40 ms) as a function of the ionic current which gives a
linear plot (inset, Figure 3(a)).
The DNA moves due to a combination of electrophoresis and advection by the electroosmotic flow setup in the
capillary. Both of these effects are proportional to the
electric field15 E. So the equation of motion for the DNA

Assuming a conical geometry for the nanocapillary we
have A(x) = πr2 = π(a + x tan θ)2 where a is the pore
radius at the capillary tip. Substituting in Equation 3, we
get an integral that can be evaluated analytically. We get
a particularly simple form if we neglect the pore radius
by setting a = 0. Then the integrand has a singularity
at x = 0 but the singularity is integrable. On evaluating
the integral we obtain the simple result t ∝ x3 . it is

The data in Figure 3(a) has been re-plotted as x as a
function of t0 in Figure 3(b). The measurements at different voltages are seen to collapse to a single curve as
expected. The line is a parameter fit using the form of
Equation 4. The inset shows that t0 is indeed proportional to x3 as expected with a proportionality constant
that is independent of the applied voltage. The conductivity of the buffer is σ = 17.93 mS/cm. The opening

4
angle of the nanocapillaries is determined by optical microscopy to yield a value of tan θ = 0.0187 and so using
equation 5 we obtain µnet = (8.83 ± 0.17) × 103 µm2 /sV.
This value is less than the electrophoretic mobility obtained in bulk for λ DNA in the same buffer using laser
Doppler electrophoresis (2.6 × 104 µm2 /sV). It is also
half the value reported for DNA confined between two
nanopores16 (1.8 × 104 µm2 /sV). These results can be explained by a number of other factors including a reduced
charge on the DNA backbone due to the presence of the
intercalating dye molecules, low pH of the buffer or larger
electroosmostic flow out of the nanocapillary.
In summary, using a setup that combines ionic current detection with fluorescence imaging we present direct visual evidence that current blockade events do indeed correspond to the translocation of DNA through the
pore. The current blockade is a sensitive determinant of
pore translocation as the drop in the current occurs only
when the DNA molecule is in close proximity to the pore.
Once across the pore region, the DNA moves in a variable electric field due to the changing cross-section of the
nanocapillary. By tracking the motion of the DNA we
show that the observed motion is consistent with a simple analytical model. Fitting the single parameter in the
model to the data provides a method of measuring the
net mobility of the DNA. The measured value was found
to be in the same range as other reported measurements
of DNA moving in confined environments.
