Abstract
We show that the Eigen model and the asexual Wright-Fisher model can be obtained as
different limit cases of a unique stochastic model. This derivation makes clear which are the
exact differences between these two models.
The two key concepts introduced with the Eigen model, the error threshold and the quasispecies, are not affected by these differences, so that they are naturally present also in population
genetics models. According to this fact, in the last part of the paper, we use the classical diploid
mutation-selection equation and the single peak fitness approximation to obtain the error threshold for sexual diploids. Finally, we compare the results with the asexual case.

Keywords: Mutation-selection dynamics, Error threshold, Stochastic model.

Introduction

The Eigen model was formulated as a deterministic mutation-selection model describing replication
at the onset of life [4]. The study of mutation-selection balance in the Eigen model for very high
mutation rates led to the development of two new evolutionary concepts: the error threshold and
the quasispecies [5]. The first refers to the fact that, for a critical value of the mutation probability
(and for some choices of the fitness landscape, see [2], [17], [15]), there is an abrupt transition in
the asymptotic state of the system from a cloud of mutants organized around a given consensus
sequence to an almost random distribution of genotypes. The second refers to the fact that, due to
1

the mutational coupling, selection acts on groups of neighbour mutants (called quasispecies) instead
of individuals.
Since RNA viruses lack proof reading mechanisms, they have mutation rates orders of magnitude
higher than DNA based organisms, so that both the error threshold and the quasispecies concepts
could play a relevant role for these organisms. Indeed, the Eigen model has became the main mathematical tool in this context (see [10], [11] for recent reviews on the subject). However, some authors
questioned the relevance of the quasispecies as a paradigm for populations of RNA viruses [12], [9],
[7], [8], suggesting that the high heterogeneity in populations of RNA viruses could be due to genetic
drift, and consequently could be better explained by population genetics models. This contrast could
lead to the idea that the Eigen model and population genetic models are incompatible mathematical
models. For example, [6] begins saying: “Some major differences distinguish quasispecies theory
from the classical selection theories of Darwin and neo-Darwinian geneticists”, while in [10], one
can read: “The evolutionary dynamics of RNA viruses are complex and their high mutation rates,
rapid replication kinetics, and large population sizes present a challenge to traditional population
genetics”. On the other hand, Wilke provided evidence that this is not the case, by showing that
particular limit cases of the Eigen model give raise to some well known population genetics equations
[17]. However, the precise mathematical relation between the Eigen model and population genetics
models remains still unclear. The main purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap, by showing
that the Eigen model and the haploid asexual Wright-Fisher model can be obtained as different
particular limits of a unique discrete time stochastic model. This is done in section 2. Motivated
by the analogies between the Eigen model and the Wright-Fisher model, in section 3 we use the
classical diploid mutation-selection equation and the single peak fitness landscape approximation,
to determine the error threshold for sexual diploids. Finally, to determine the influence of syngamy
on the error threshold, in section 4 we compare the results that we obtained for sexual diploids with
those holding for asexual diploids.

The stochastic model

In [13] it was shown that the Eigen model emerges as the deterministic and continuous time limit of
a stochastic mutation-selection model. By changing the selection procedure of that model, we can
obtain another stochastic model having again the Eigen model as its deterministic and continuous
time limit and, at the same time, the asexual Wright-Fisher model as a different particular subcase.

Let us consider a population of constant size of N individuals of K possible different types
I1 , . . . , IK that reproduce asexually. Let Ai be the fecundity of type Ii , Di its degradation rate and
Qij the probability that an individual of type Ij mutates into type Ii as a result of an unexact
replication
K

∑ Qij = 1.

(1)

i=1

In this model selection happens at discrete time steps h. Between a selection event and the successive
one, the organisms of the different types Ij reproduce, mutate and degradate with their characteristic
rates. We assume that only the individuals in the parental generation are subject to degradation,
while the newborns will always reach the next selection step, which will restore the total population
to N .
Let us denote with n = (n1 , . . . , nK ), ∑K
j=1 nj = N , the type counts just after a selection event,
then, according to the above hypotheses, the expected number of individuals of type Ii just before
the next selection event will be given by
K

mi = ni + h ∑ (Aj Qij − Di δij ) nj .

(2)

j=1

All the quantities appearing in the above equation, with the exception of the ni that are integer
numbers, can assume real values. Indeed, equation (2) should be interpreted as the deterministic
limit of a stochastic process (see also [13]). Notice that, since in (2) the quantity hDi ni represents
the number of Ii individuals in the parental generation that die before the next selection event, the
time step length h is bounded by the conditions hDi ≤ 1, i = 1, . . . , K.
Selection consists in the extraction with replacement of N individuals from the m population
with sampling probabilities ψi (n) equal to their relative frequencies
ψi (n) ∶=

∑j=1 mj
K

=

ni + h ∑K
j=1 (Aj Qij − Di δij ) nj
N + h ∑K
j=1 (Aj − Dj ) nj

.

(3)

Notice that, by definition, ∑i ψi (n) = 1 and that ψi (n) ≥ 0 is granted by the conditions hDi ≤ 1, so

that the interpretation of the ψi (n) as probabilities is adequate.
The Markov matrix of the model will be given by
Ph (n′ ∣n) =

N!

ψ1 (n)n1 . . . ψK (n)nK ,
′

n′1 ! . . . n′K !

(4)

where n = (n1 , . . . , nK ) and n′ = (n′1 , . . . , n′K ) are the type counts in successive generations, with

K
K
∑j=1 nj = ∑j=1 n′j = N .

Through (3) and (4), we have defined a family of stochastic models parametrized by the time
step h. The particular case when
hDj = 1, ∀j,

(5)

corresponds to the case of separated generations, when all the individuals in the parental generation
die before the next reproductive step. When (5) holds, the sampling probabilities (3) simplify to
ψi (n) ∶=

∑j=1 (Aj Qij nj )
K

∑j=1 Aj nj
K

(6)

.

In this case, equation (4) defines the asexual Wright-Fisher model (see, for example, [1]), with the
viability of type Ii given by Ai . Notice also that the model is now independent of the time step h.
We conclude that the stochastic model defined by (4) reduces to the asexual haploid Wright-Fisher
model when the generations are separated.
Let us now consider the deterministic limit of the model (4). First of all, let us notice that the
probability that n′i = k is simply given by
N
Ph (n′i = k∣n) = ( )ψi (n)k (1 − ψi (n)N −k ) .
k

(7)

Accordingly, the expected value of n′i will be given by
K
N
n̄′i = ∑ k( )ψi (n)k (1 − ψi (n)N −k ) .
k
k=1

(8)

K
N k N −k
= N x(x + y)N −1 ,
∑ k( )x y
k
k=1

(9)

Using the binomial identity

we get
n̄′i = N ψi (n).

(10)

By substituting the expression for the sampling probability (3) with n replaced by its expected value
n̄ inside (10), we get the following system of discrete equations
n̄′i =

n̄i + h ∑K
j=1 (Aj Qij − Di δij ) n̄j
1 + h/N ∑K
j=1 (Aj − Dj ) n̄j

4

.

(11)

Dividing equation (11) by N we obtain the equations for the type frequencies φi = n̄i /N :
φ′i =

φi + h ∑K
j=1 (Aj Qij − Di δij ) φj
1 + h ∑K
j=1 (Aj − Dj ) φj

Clearly, by imposing separated generations (5) into equation (11) we would obtain the deterministic
limit of the haploid asexual Wright-Fisher model, that coincides with the classical haploid mutationselection model (see, for example, [3]):
φ′i =

∑j=1 Aj Qij φj
K

(16)

So, the only differences between the classical haploid mutation-selection model (16) and the Eigen
model (15) is that the first one is obtained by the deterministic model (11) imposing separated
generations and the latter taking the continuous time limit. Since neither the error threshold, nor
the quasispecies phenomenon are due to these differences, they are naturally present in both models
(indeed, see [3] for the quasispecies and [16] for the error threshold in the context of population
genetics).
Just to give a concrete example, let us compute the error threshold according to both models in
a very special case that allows for a simple analytical treatment. Let us suppose that each type Ij
is specificated by a genotype of length L (so that K = 4L ). Let u be the point mutation probability

and let us send u → 0 and L → ∞ in such a way that the genomic mutation rate U = uL stays finite.

In this limit, the probability of mutation from the type I1 to a different type Ij , j ≠ 1 will be given
by µ = 1 − exp(−U ) and the probability of back mutation will be zero. Let us also consider the single
5

peak fitness landscape Ai = A2 , Di = D2 , i > 2, A1 − D1 > A2 − D2 . The single peak fitness landscape
is a (very) simplified fitness landscape often used in the Eigen model to get an analytical expression
for the error threshold (see [14]). Let φB be the frequency of all the sequences different from φ1 :
∞

φB = ∑ φi ,

(17)

i=2

then the Eigen equations reduce to only two equations:

φ̇1
φ̇B

= (A1 e−U − D1 ) φ1 − φ1 [(A1 − D1 ) φ1 + (A2 − D2 ) φB ] ,

= A1 (1 − e−U ) φ1 + (A2 − D2 )φM − φB [(A1 − D1 ) φ1 + (A2 − D2 ) φB ] .

(18)
(19)

The error threshold corresponds to the smallest value of the genomic mutation rate U for which
lim φ1 (t) = 0.

t→∞

(20)

From equations (18), (19), we get the error threshold
Ut = ln (

A1
).
A2 − D2 + D1

(21)

For the classical haploid mutation-selection model (16) the above assumptions translate in considering a locus with two alleles of relative viability w1 = A1 > A2 = w2 , with forward mutation given
by µ = 1 − exp(−U ) and the probability of back mutation being zero. The frequencies φ′1 and φ′2 of
the two alleles at the next generation, given that they are φ1 and φ2 at the present one will be:
φ′1

=

φ′2

=

φ1 A1 (1 − µ)
,
φ1 A1 + φ2 A2
φ1 A1 µ + φ2 A2
.
φ1 A1 + φ2 A2

(22)
(23)

The first allele will go extinct, in the asymptotic limit, when φ′1 − φ1 < 0 for φ1 > 0, that implies
µ>

(24)

or
Ut = ln (

(25)

This is equivalent to the Eigen model result by keeping into account that the separated generations
condition (5) implies that D1 = D2 . By rescaling A1 to 1 and A2 to 1 − s, where s is the selection
coefficient, we obtain:
Ut = ln (

Error threshold in the sexual diploid Wright-Fisher model

Given the relation between the Eigen model (15) and the classical haploid mutation-selection model
(16), it seems a natural option to use the classical diploid mutation-selection equation to determine
the error threshold for sexual diploids. This was indeed done in [16], but the analytical derivation
of the error threshold was inaccurate, giving the correct value of the critical mutation probability
only for some regions of the (h, s) space, where h is the dominance and s the selection parameter.
To explain the problem with the derivation given in [16] let us briefly recall it. To obtain an
analytic expression for the error threshold, the authors consider a diploid analogue of the simplifying
assumptions that we used in the previous section. Namely, they considered a single locus with two
alleles with mutation probability from the fittest to the worst allele given by 1 − m11 and vanishing
back mutation probability (we recall that these simplifying assumptions comes from considering
a genome of infinite length in the single peak landscape, see the previous section). Using these
assumptions, the continuous time version of the classical diploid mutation-selection equation for the
master frequency x1 , reduces to (compare with eq. (1) in [16]):
ẋ1 = x1 (W x)1 m11 − x1 (x, W x)

(27)

where (in their notations) x = (x1 , 1 − x1 ) is the vector of frequencies, W the viabilities matrix and

(1 − m11 ) is the mutation probability of the master sequence. Next, they looked for a stationary

solution of equation (27) (see eq. (17) in [16]):
x1 (W x)1 m11 − x1 (x, W x) = 0,

(28)

When solving equation (28) for m11 , they neglected the common x1 factor (see eq. (18) in [16]).
That is, they solved the equation
(W x)1 m11 − (x, W x) = 0
7

(29)

for m11 in the case x1 = 0. However, this procedure is incomplete for two reasons. First, it should
be checked that for the obtained value of m11 there are no more solutions of equation (29) for
x1 ∈ (0, 1], because in this case x1 = 0 would not be a global sink for the equation (27). Second, if
m11 is such that the left hand side of equation (29) is not zero but always negative, x1 = 0 will be a
sink for equation (27) and the corresponding value of m11 a candidate for the error threshold even
if equation (29) is not satisfied for x1 = 0. So, in the following we will determine the error threshold
by keeping into account the above considerations.
To the effect of determining the error threshold, it is equivalent to consider the time discrete
or continuous, so that we will use the more traditional discrete time version of the classical diploid
mutation-selection equation. As usual, we will consider two alleles on an autosomal locus in a
monoecius random mating population with separated generations. Let us denote by A the fittest
allele and by p its frequency after the mutation step but before selection, while the frequency of the
other allele a will be given by 1 − p. Let the relative fitness be given by 1 for AA, 1 − hs for Aa

and 1 − s for aa. We will denote by µ the mutation probability from A to a and, using the same

approximation that we considered in the haploid case, we will set the back mutation probability to
zero. Furthermore, we will restrict our considerations to the case when 0 < h < 1, that is, we will
neglect underdominance and overdominance. The frequency p′ of the A allele after a generation
(composed by selection followed by mutation) will be given by (see [3]):
p′ =

(1 − µ) [p2 + p(1 − p)(1 − hs)]
w̄

(30)

where w̄ is the average fitness:
w̄ = p2 + 2p(1 − p)(1 − hs) + (1 − p)2 (1 − s)

(31)

We want to determine the minimum value of the mutation probability µ that determines the extinction of the fittest allele A from the population given that its initial frequency is p0 = 1. So, we need
to find the minimum value of µ that implies p′ < p for any p. Since w̄ > 0 this gives the inequality:
p(1 − µ) [p + (1 − p)(1 − hs)] − w̄p < 0

8

(32)

By eliminating the common p factor we reduce to the quadratic inequality in p:
ap2 + bp + c < 0

p ∈ (0, 1],

(33)

with

a

= s(1 − 2h),

(34)

b

= hs(1 − µ) − 2s(1 − h),

(35)

c

= (1 − hs)(1 − µ) − (1 − s).

(36)

For h < 1/2, both the a coefficient (34) and the discriminant ∆ = b2 − 4ac are positive. In this case,

the parabola ap2 + bp + c will always have two real roots and will be negative in the region among
the roots. One of the roots will be zero when c = 0, that is when

µ=

(1 − h)s
.
1 − hs

(37)

For this value of µ the second root becomes
3h − 2 + hs(1 − 2h)
.
(1 − hs)(2h − 1)

(38)

This last quantity will be greater than 1 for h < 1, that is always satisfied. We conclude that, for
h < 1/2, the error threshold is given by equation (37). In the case h = 1/2 the equation (37) remains
valid by continuity. Alternatively, since a = 0 one can directly solve the inequality
bp + c < 0,

(39)

that implies
u>

1/2s
.
1 − 1/2s

(40)

When h > 1/2, a < 0 and the discriminant can be both positive or negative. The inequality (33)
will be satisfied if one of these three conditions is satisfied:
1. ∆ ≥ 0 and the largest root is less than or equal to zero,
2. ∆ ≥ 0 and the smallest root is greater than or equal to one,

9

3. ∆ < 0.
Equation (37) implies that one of the roots is zero, so that the first condition is satisfied if the second
root (38) is less than or equal to zero. This is the case if

s>

3h − 2
.
h(2h − 1)

(41)

Notice that the right hand side of (41) is less than zero when 1/2 < h < 2/3 and it is greater than
zero but less than one when 2/3 < h < 1.
The second condition can never be satisfied. Indeed, a necessary condition for the smallest root
of a parabola to be greater than one is that also the abscissa value of the vertex x = −b/(2a) be
greater than one. In our case this translates into the condition
− hs(u + 1) > 0,

(42)

that cannot be satisfied for our choice of the range of the parameters.
Regarding the third condition, there exists real µ solutions to ∆ < 0 only when

The result given in [16] coincides with the first line of equation (50).

The asexual diploids case

It is interesting to compare the result for the error threshold of sexual diploids (50) obtained in
the previous section with that of asexual diploids, to evaluate the effect of syngamy on the error
threshold. To this aim, we now calculate the error threshold for an asexual diploid organism, in
the usual approximation of infinite genome length and single peak fitness landscape. If we have a
diploid locus in an asexual organism, we denote with p1 , p2 and p3 respectively the frequencies of
the AA, Aa and aa genotypes and with µ the probability of mutating from A to a, then under the
above hypotheses, we have that after one generation:
p⃗′ = M p⃗
with M given by

). The outcome will depend on which is the maximum eigenvalue of

the matrix M . If the maximum eigenvalue is (1 − µ)2 , then the three genotypes will coexist, because

the corresponding eigenvector of M has its three components different from zero. If the maximum

eigenvalue is (1 − µ)(1 − hs), then the AA omozygote will disappear and the other two will coexist,
because the corresponding eigenvector of M has the first component zero and the other two different
from zero. Finally, if the maximum eigenvalue is 1 − s, then only the homozygote aa will survive,
because the corresponding eigenvector of M has only its third component different from zero. The

We can now compare the error thresholds in the sexual and asexual case. Comparing equations
(50), (61) and keeping into account (59) and (60), we see that for h ≤ 1/2 there is no difference in
the error threshold between the sexual and asexual case. We plot this difference in figure 1 for the
whole range of variation of h and s. We see that, for h > 1/2 , the advantageous allele is more robust
to complete loss by mutation in the asexual than in the sexual case.
In figure 2 we show the difference between the sexual error threshold (50) and the threshold
mutation rate for the loss of the advantageous homozygote in the asexual case. We see that in
this case, as obvious, the advantageous homozygote is much more robust to loss by mutation in the
sexual than in the asexual case. Indeed, in the sexual case the advantageous homozygote can be
eliminated only by completely removing the advantageous allele.

Conclusions

We constructed a stochastic model having the haploid Wright-Fisher model and the Eigen model as
particular subcases. The haploid Wright-Fisher model is obtained by considering separated generations, while the Eigen model is obtained by taking the deterministic and continuous time limit. This
derivation makes it clear what are the differences between these two important models of mutationselection dynamics. Emerging as a deterministic limit, the Eigen model neglects genetic drift and it
is almost equivalent to the deterministic limit of the haploid Wright-Fisher model, that is, the classical haploid mutation-selection model (16). The differences among this model and the Eigen model
do not invalidate the concepts of quasispecies and error threshold, that consequently are present
in both models. This suggests to use the classical diploid mutation-selection model to obtain the
error threshold for sexual diploids. We derived an analytical expression for the error threshold inside
this model by using the usual approximations of infinite genome length and the single peak fitness
landscape. We compared this expression with the corresponding expression for asexual diploid organisms. No difference emerges when h ≤ 1/2, but, curiously, when h > 1/2, syngamy makes the
advantageous allele more liable to complete loss by mutation. On the other hand, this is not the
case for the loss of the advantageous homozygote that in the sexual case, especially for low values
of the dominance parameter h and high values of the selection coefficient as can be appreciated in
figure
