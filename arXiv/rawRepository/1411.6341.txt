Abstract
Epistasis describes the phenomenon that mutations at different loci do not have independent effects with regard to
certain phenotypes. Understanding the global epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.
Current knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited by the technological difficulties in
experimentally screening epistatic relations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis
to simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations. Specifically, we looked at gene-gene
epistatic interactions, where the mutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis tends
to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting conditions, indicating that selection might be less
effective in removing deleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of epistatic interactions in all
tested conditions, as well as many epistatic interactions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable
epistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas genes with condition-specific epistasis
form a scale-free network. Furthermore, genes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas
this co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific epistasis. Our findings provide a novel
genome-wide picture about epistatic dynamics under environmental perturbations.

1 Author Summary
Epistasis, often referred to as genetic interactions, occur when mutational effects of genes depend on each other. Aside
from often times complicating the way in which the phenotype of an organism relates to its genotype, epistatic interactions (or epistases) are essential to several important theories in biology, especially in evolution. Due to the difficulty
in experimentally assessing epistasis across an entire genome, we employed mathematical modeling of the metabolic
network of baker’s yeast to comprehensively simulate genetic interactions for virtually all known metabolic genes in
the organism. We performed comprehensive simulations in 17 different environments, which differ by their nutrients.
We characterized a trend that occurs in genetic interactions when yeast is transferred from a glucose-abundant environment to other environments. We also found that both the set of genetic interactions present in all conditions and the
set of interactions present in a single environment are fairly large sets with highly different connectivity. Furthermore,
the set present in all conditions tends to consist of gene pairs with similar evolutionary rates.

2 Introduction
Epistasis refers to the phenomenon wherein mutations of two genes can modify each other’s phenotypic outcomes. It
can be positive (alleviating), or negative (aggravating), when a combination of deleterious mutations shows a fitness
value that is higher, or lower, than expectation, respectively. For example, a mutation that hampers a pathway’s
function may allow for other mutations in the same pathway without a fitness consequence, resulting in positive
epistasis. Conversely, genes or pathways with redundant functions can give rise to negative epistasis. It is well
established that epistasis is important for the evolution of sex [1–3], speciation [4], mutational load [5], ploidy [6],
genetic architecture of growth traits [7], genetic drift [8], genomic complexity [9], and drug resistance [10]. As
biological systems in nature have to face multiple genetic and environmental perturbations, understanding the global
landscape and dynamics of epistasis under these perturbations remains an important issue in the evolutionary field. In
an earlier study, we addressed genome-wide epistasis dynamics under various genetic perturbations [11]. In this study,
we will investigate the impact of environmental perturbations on global epistasis dynamics.
How epistatic interactions among genes change in different environments has been intensively studied in various
model organisms, including E. coli [12–14], S. cerevisiae [15–17], C. elegans [18, 19] and D. melanogaster [20–
22]. The results of these studies, however, are very controversial. While some studies observed increasing positive
epistasis under harsh conditions [13, 17, 20], others have opposite findings [14–16, 18, 19, 21–23]. Even within the
same species, different experimental studies might have conflicting conclusions (e.g. Kishony and Leibler [13], Cooper
et al. [14]). One possible reason for the above controversy could have originated from the fact that most studies only
looked at the epistasis dynamics based on a small number of genes, where the properties cannot be generalized to the
entire organism.
The main obstacle to exploring global epistatic dynamics under a variety of environments is the difficulty of
applying high-throughput experimental platforms. To explore epistasis on a genomic scale, a number of technologies have been developed to systematically map genetic interaction networks, such as synthetic genetic array (SGA)
[24, 25], diploid-based synthetic lethality analysis with microarrays (dSLAM) [26, 27], synthetic dosage-suppression
and lethality screen [28–30] and epistatic miniarray profiles (EMAP) [31–33]. A key issue for all these experimental
studies is that these epistatic networks have been constructed only under normal laboratory conditions. However, cells
in nature are constantly bombarded by various external environmental stresses. Epistasis dynamics under these perturbations cannot be predicted based on a single laboratory condition. Few studies have constructed epistatic networks
for multiple environments. A recent study that has only constructed epistatic networks for a group of genes with specific functions under one normal and one harsh condition already requires a large amount of effort [34]. Consequently,
genome-scale epistasis landscapes under a variety of environmental perturbations remain largely uncharacterized.
Here we explored this issue by using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to simulate epistasis dynamics among genes under multiple environmental perturbations. FBA can provide reliable predictions by optimizating a presumed objective
function, commonly growth maximization in microbes, subject to the known reactions and constraints of a metabolic
network [35–40]. Using this platform, a previous study has investigated synthetic lethal interactions (one type of negative epistasis) under multiple environmental perturbations and showed the plasticity of epistatic interactions in the
metabolic networks [41]. Here we examined both positive and negative epistasis using FBA, and were able to show
that, on a genome scale, epistatic interactions tend to become more positive in nutrient-limiting conditions relative to
abundant-glucose media. In addition, while a large proportion of epistatic interactions can be rewired dynamically
under varying environments, there is a set of epistatic interactions that are stable across all tested environments. We
also discovered different network and evolutionary properties for genes with stable and dynamic epistatic interactions.
Implications of our findings were discussed.

3 Results
3.1 FBA modeling and simulated growth conditions
We applied the yeast S. cerevisiae metabolic reconstruction iMM904 [42] to examine the dynamics of epistasis under various environmental perturbations. The reconstruction has 904 metabolic genes that are associated with 1,412
metabolic reactions. We conducted FBA simulations under an abundant-glucose condition and 16 nutrient-limiting

2

conditions. In 15 of these conditions, the carbon source (abundant glucose) was replaced by one of the following:
acetaldehyde, acetate, adenosine 3’,5’-bisphosphate, adenosyl methionine, adenosine, alanine, allantoin, arginine,
ethanol, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol, low glucose, trehalose, and xanthosine, respectively. These conditions represent a wide variety of nutrient and energy sources: nucleosides, amino acids, sugars, alcohols, etc. Additionally, we
looked at abundant glucose under limited phosphorus availability.
To ensure that all environments have the same growth rates in the following analyses, we restricted the carbon
source or phosphorous uptake levels for each of the 16 environmental perturbations such that only 20% of the highglucose growth rate was attained. This was chosen because it has been shown that metabolism is directly linked to
growth and similar growth rates often induce similar metabolic pathways [43]. It is therefore important to use a fixed
growth rate among different conditions to control for the relationship between growth rates and the overall metabolic
activity so as not to induce a growth-rate specific effect. The 20% high-glucose level was chosen because some media
types do not support high growth rates, regardless of the abundance of the nutrient source. Specifically, the acetate
condition had the lowest wild-type growth rate (38.5% of the wild-type glucose growth rate) when unrestricted carbon
uptake was permitted. In order to allow flexibility with adding more conditions in future studies while simultaneously
not allowing extremely low growth rates that may be possible to model but are unlikely to persist in natural environments, we chose a growth rate of approximately half of this minimal wild-type growth rate as the the wild-type growth
rate for all conditions.
In order to estimate epistasis between genes, we created a mutation for each gene in each condition that restricted
the flux to be 50% of the wild-type flux found by geometric FBA for all reactions associated with the mutant gene
[11]. Epistatic relations between any two genes were calculated under each condition. We also tested our core findings
allowing maximum growth in each condition (Table S1) and the general trends in our results remained similar, as
described in the following.

3.2 More positive differential epistases from rich media to nutrient-limiting conditions
To directly address how the sign and magnitude of epistases change under nutrient-limiting conditions, we calculated
differential epistasis (dǫ), which is defined as the epistatic change from abundant-glucose media to the nutrient-limiting
condition for each gene pair in each growth condition. A gene pair with positive (or negative) differential interaction
under an environmental perturbation is defined as the gene pair having increasing (or decreasing) epistasis values from
the abundant-glucose media to that condition. Figure 1A depicts the distribution of differential epistases in two growth
conditions (ethanol and glycerol) as an example. Only genes with |dǫ| ≥ 0.01 in at least one of the two conditions are
included in this figure. As quantified in Table S2, there are 6.1% and 5.5% of all gene pairs with |dǫ| ≥ 0.01 from
abundant-glucose media to ethanol and glycerol growth conditions, respectively. Among them, a large number of
gene pairs even change their sign of epistasis (Table S2). Simulations in other conditions show similar effects (Table
S2), indicating that epistatic relationships among genes can be very dynamic between abundant-glucose media and
nutrient-limiting conditions.
We further investigated the sign of differential epistasis from abundant-glucose to nutrient-limiting conditions. As
shown in Figure 1A, we observed more yellow dots (positive differential epistasis) than blue dots (negative differential
epistasis) in both panels. Indeed, as quantified in Figure 1B, 72% and 57% of differential epistases are positive in
ethanol and glycerol conditions, respectively. We further explored all 16 nutrient-limiting conditions and the results
are shown in Figure 1C. In most of our simulated conditions (13/16), there are significantly more positive differential
epistases than negative differential epistases (Binomial test, P < 10−5 for each of the 13 conditions), indicating that
epistasis tends to become more positive in nutrient-limiting conditions. This conclusion does not depend on the criteria
we used to define differential epistasis (Figure 6).
A recent high-throughput experiment measured epistatic relations between roughly 80,000 gene pairs with and
without perturbation by a DNA-damaging agent (methyl methanesulfonate, MMS). The study represents the most
comprehensive experimental study so far to explore epistatic dynamics from a rich medium to a harsh condition [34].
Interestingly, the authors also found more positive differential epistases than negative differential epistases, which is
consistent with our general observation (Figure 1C). We further allowed maximum growth in each condition and the
general trends in our results remained similar (Figure 7).
We found that differential epistasis had functional importance after performing both Gene Ontology (GO) and

conditions. Only gene pairs with |dǫ| ≥ 0.01 in either condition are included in the figure. Different colors represent
differential epistasis values as indicated by the color bar at the bottom. The differential epistasis values are assigned
to be 0.1 (or -0.1) in the heat-maps when it is greater than 0.1 (or less than -0.1). It is noteworthy to point out that

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses to compare genes with positive and negative
differential epistases through the glucose-abundant to ethanol transition. We chose the ethanol condition as an example
because it is one of the most widely used conditions for the baker’s yeast. We observed that 38 GO terms and 8 KEGG
pathways are enriched for positive differential epistasis, while 18 GO terms and 1 KEGG pathways are enriched for
negative differential epistasis (Table S3). More importantly, we found positive and negative differential epistases
uniquely contribute to different aspects of ethanol and energy metabolism. For example, positive differential epistasis
is enriched in monohydric alcohol metabolic processes, oxidoreductase activity acting on aldehyde group donors, the
TCA cycle, and pyruvate metabolism, while negative differential epistasis is enriched in ethanol metabolic processes
and various amino acid terms and pathways, indicating the functional importance of differential epistasis (Table S3).
This is consistent with experimental results that show differential epistatic interactions, rather than static epistatic
interactions, are functionally related to the response of interest [34].
Several system properties were found to correlate with the ratio of the number of positive to negative differential
epistases (Table S4). A strong correlation exists between the number of essential genes in a given condition and the
ratio of positive to negative differential epistasis on transition from high glucose to that condition (ρ = 0.8392, P
= 4.8107 × 10−5 ), which was a better predictor than the number of non-zero fluxes in the wild-type vector for that
environment (ρ = 0.5115, P = 0.0428). Another strong predictor for positive differential epistasis was the mean relative
fitness of single mutants in the new environment (ρ = −0.8029, P = 2.7427 × 10−4 ); this anticorrelation suggests that
a propensity for a lower single mutant fitness can cause a shift towards positive epistasis.

3.3 Dynamic epistasis between nutrient-limiting conditions
Figure 1 explored the epistasis dynamics from abundant-glucose media to nutrient-limiting conditions. As biological
systems in nature constantly face perturbations to the environment, it is interesting to investigate the epistasis dynamics
among nutrient-limiting conditions. To achieve this aim, we first explored the epistatic relationship between the same
gene pairs in ethanol and glycerol environments. Figure 2A lists the number of gene pairs that have various epistatic
relationships. It is noteworthy to point out that, consistent with previously published results, there are significantly
more positive epistases than negative epistases between genes in either condition [44].
If two genes have the same sign of epistasis and |ǫ| ≥ 0.01 in both conditions, they are defined as having a similar
epistatic relationship in these two conditions. To quantify epistatic dynamics between ethanol and glycerol growth
conditions, we defined the percentage of gene pairs with similar epistatic relations to be the number of gene pairs with
similar epistasis relations shared in these two conditions (overlap) divided by the number of gene pairs with epistasis
in either condition (union). Our results show that 79% of gene pairs have similar epistasis relations between these
two conditions. Figure 2B shows the distribution for the percentages of gene pairs with similar epistasis relations
between any 2 of 16 conditions, demonstrating a variable degree of epistatic similarity between any two conditions.
This conclusion still holds when we used different criteria to define epistatic relationships between genes (Figure 8).
To understand the global distribution of all epistatic relations, we considered 16 conditions together and calculated
the fraction of epistatic interactions existing in 1, 2, 3, . . . , 15, and 16 conditions, respectively. As shown in Figure 3A,
we found that there is a U frequency distribution for the number of growth conditions in which a specific epistatic
interaction is observed. This means that approximately 52% of these interactions are either condition-specific (24%;
termed dynamic) or predicted to exist in all conditions (28%; termed stable), and about 48% is intermediate (exists
in multiple but not all 16 conditions). An analogous result was obtained previously, but only for synthetic lethal
interactions [41]. We also changed the growth assumption and allowed maximum growth in each condition and
reanalyzed the global distribution of all epistatic relations. The U frequency distribution for the number of growth
conditions in which a specific epistatic interaction is observed remained similar (Figure 9). Based on the result in
Figure 3A, we further calculated the ratio of these three types of epistatic relations in each of the 16 environmental
perturbations. As shown in Figure 3B, we found that in each environment, about 40-60% of epistatic interactions are
stable and that each environment also has many private epistases among genes.

3.4 Different network properties for stable and dynamic epistasis
Analysis on network properties can reveal various organization principles (e.g. frequency of occurrence, centrality)
for epistasis networks [24, 25] and therefore provide valuable information to further distinguish stable and dynamic

epistasis. To achieve this aim, we compared networks formed by extremely stable and extremely dynamic epistasis
among genes and asked whether they have distinct network properties. The degree distributions for both types of
epistasis are shown in Figure 4A. Interestingly, extremely stable epistatic interactions form an exponential network
architecture, which is homogeneous, meaning that most nodes have a very similar number of links (Figure 4A, left
panel). In contrast, the extremely dynamic epistatic interactions give rise to a scale-free network topology, which is
heterogeneous, meaning that the majority of nodes have few links but a small number of hubs have a large number of

In addition, we calculated three network parameters to compare these two types of epistatic interactions. We
found that the network formed by extremely stable epistases has a smaller shortest path length, a larger clustering
coefficient and larger closeness than the network formed by extremely dynamic epistases (Figure 4B). These results
are consistent with the scenario that genes with extremely stable epistasis are directly linked to most other genes and
form an exponential network topology, while genes with extremely dynamic epistasis form a scale-free network. Our
results also show that the network induced by intermediate epistases have intermediate values of these parameters
compared to that of extremely stable and extremely dynamic epistasis networks (Tables S5 and S6).

3.5 Co-evolution of genes with epistatic interaction
Gene pairs with epistasis identified in real experiments usually show similar evolutionary rates. To investigate whether
two genes with predicted epistasis also tend to co-evolve, we calculated the evolutionary rate differences between
two genes with epistasis from FBA modeling (Figure 5A). Evolutionary rates (dN/dS ) based on orthologous gene sets
from four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces were downloaded from a commonly used reference dataset [45].
Simulations based on the same number of gene pairs with FBA-predicted epistasis were conducted to estimate the
evolutionary rate differences for any two randomly selected genes. As shown in Figure 5A, the gene pairs with FBApredicted epistatic interactions tend to have more similar evolutionary rates than random expectation (P < 10−4 ).
In Figure 4 we observed unique network properties for extremely stable and extremely dynamic epistatic inter-

corresponding arrows, respectively). (B) The evolutionary rates for genes that are involved in extremely stable and

actions. We further investigate the co-evolution between genes with these two types of epistatic relationships. As
shown in Figure 5A, genes with extremely stable epistasis tend to co-evolve (P < 10−4 ), while the difference between
genes with extremely dynamic epistasis and random expectation becomes much smaller (P = 0.06). The evolutionary
rate difference between gene pairs with extremely stable and extremely dynamic epistasis is also significant (t-test,

9

P = 8 × 10−6 ). This difference is not caused by genes that are involved in extremely stable or extremely dynamic
epistasis, because these two groups of genes do not have significantly different evolutionary rates (t-test, P = 0.796,
Figure 5B).

4 Discussion
4.1 Natural selection in nutrient-limiting conditions
Whether a genetic mutation has a fitness consequence depends on other sites, a phenomenon called epistasis (see
Lehner [46] for a recent review on molecular mechanisms). Positive epistasis alleviates the total harm when multiple
deleterious mutations combine together and thus reduces the effectiveness of natural selection in removing these deleterious mutations, whereas negative epistasis plays the opposite role by increasing the efficiency of purging deleterious
mutations by natural selection. Results from this study present an initial glimpse over environment-induced epistasis
dynamics at the genome scale. Using differential epistasis from abundant-glucose to nutrient-limiting conditions, our
results show that epistasis between specific genes can become more positive or more negative in nutrient-limiting
conditions, which is consistent with previous findings in small scale studies [12–23]. However, we showed that, at
the genome scale, epistasis is more positive in nutrient-limiting conditions. Interestingly, our simulation results are
consistent with a recent genome-wide study between laboratory and harsh growth conditions [34]. How epistasis affects selection in harsh conditions has been controversial [47]. Our results provide the genome-wide evidence arguing
that selection might be less effective in removing deleterious mutations in harsh conditions, which could be one of the
underlying reasons for a recent observation that stimulation of a stress response can reduce mutation penetrance in
Caenorhabditis elegans [48].

4.2 Network properties and evolutionary patterns for stable and dynamic epistasis
Our results indicate that epistasis could be extremely stable or dynamic among various environmental perturbations,
which is consistent with a previous FBA study investigating synthetic lethal relations among non-essential genes [41].
The inclusion of essential genes in our study allows for investigation on many important metabolic pathways that were
not previously analyzed. Nevertheless, the distribution of epistasis among multiple environments (Figure 3A) remains
largely unchanged from the previous study [41] even when essential genes are included.
We also found that stable and dynamic epistatic relationships show totally different network properties and evolutionary patterns, which might provide new biological and evolutionary insights. The gene pairs with stable epistases
tend to co-evolve with each other. In addition, from the biological pathway perspective, the smaller shortest path
length and larger closeness values in the stable epistasis network both imply that genes with stable epistases tend to
be functionally associated with a large number of neighbors to form a condensed functional network, different from
genes in the dynamic epistasis network that are loosely connected. Furthermore, the large clustering coefficient in the
stable epistasis network also supports the idea that genes with stable epistasis interactions form a network core in the
whole epistasis network. Combined with observations in Figure 5, this core module of epistasis in the metabolic network might represent stable functional associations between genes that are essential for important biological functions
and evolutionarily conserved even under different environmental perturbations. The lack of co-evolutionary pattern
and scale-free network properties for the dynamic epistasis network, however, might represent unstable functional
associations between genes, which may only be responsible for unique functions under specific conditions.

4.3 Implications and significance for exploring stable and dynamic epistasis
Our prediction about stable and dynamic epistasis could have important functional applications. A recent study showed
that the synthetic lethal (negative epistasis) relationship between fumarate hydratase and haem oxygenase can be
employed successfully to identify an in vitro drug target in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal-cell cancer (HLRCC)
cells [49]. Exploring both dynamic and stable epistasis could be useful in this context; stable epistatic interactions
may be important for drug target detection in cancer or other pathogens, whereas it may sometimes be necessary to
exploit dynamic epistatic relationships, possibly induced by treatment with an external perturbation.

10

Furthermore, rational evolutionary design techniques such as OptKnock [50] and OptGene [51] attempt to find
which knockouts will enable a reaction of interest to be coupled with growth (i.e. have positive epistasis with growthassociated genes in a specific environment). However, these techniques do not take into account epistasis dynamics
across different environments. In this study, we have found that epistatic relations can be highly dynamic under
various environmental perturbations, which raises the possibility to improve these techniques by considering epistasis
dynamics in future studies. Research on using compensatory perturbations to reach desired network states is ongoing
[52].

4.4 Caveats and future directions
Though we show several novel insights into how varying environments can influence epistasis, several caveats should
be addressed. First, the FBA modeling used in this study, which was proven to have great predictive power and has
been successfully employed in addressing numerous research problems [35, 36, 39], only includes metabolic genes.
Second, even though FBA offers the most comprehensive simulation method for studying epistasis, there are many
improvements that can be made in order to capture the empirically observed set of epistatic interactions [53]. For
example, integrating transcriptional regulation and physical interactions into this framework could improve the current
methods in predicting epistasis and other evolutionary processes [54]. Related to this point, FBA as used herein only
considers the steady state and does not take into account any dynamics or initial conditions, and would necessarily
miss any epistatic interactions that are due to dynamics in the system, such as changing concentrations; dynamic FBA
(which is part of rFBA) might be a solution, but would likely require about a minimum of two orders of magnitude
increase in computation time [53, 55]. Recent work on new objective functions targeting metabolite turnover rather
than flux per se has also proven successful in recovering many epistases that were previously not found with FBA [56].
Third, in order to understand the impact of environmental perturbations on epistasis, we used a reductive approach
and only considered one mutation type per gene to simulate the global epistatic landscape in 16 environments. There
are countless environments in nature. Furthermore, different mutations in the same gene and the interactions between
genes and environment can likely have an even more complex impact on the epistasis dynamics. While it would be
ideal to simulate a larger variety of environments for multiple mutations of the same gene, the computational cost is a
limiting factor. Our previous study showed that different mutants of the same gene could have very dynamic epistatic
interaction partners in a single environment [11]. In this study, we chose to use one mutation per gene as we are
focusing on addressing how different environments could affect gene epistasis dynamics. Nevertheless, in order to see
how sensitive our results were, we performed the analysis for our core results by simulating 16 environments using
different growth assumption, where the organisms are allowed to have unrestricted uptake of the limiting nutrient
to obtain the maximum growth in that condition. We found the major trends in our results are largely unchanged
(Figures 7 and 9; Table S1).
Keeping these issues in mind, our analysis uncovered several prominent features of epistatic interactions under
a variety of environmental perturbations, and call on future effort to confirm these simulation results using highthroughput experimental platforms. More importantly, the enrichment of stable and dynamic epistasis provides a new
perspective to understand how biological systems may rewire epistasis in nature.

5 Methods
Scripts for generating and analyzing the data can be found in the source code repository located at https://github.
com/bbarker/COBRAscripts/. Scripts and documentation specific to this paper are located in the subdirectory
MyProjects/EnvironmentalEpistasisFBA.

5.1 Flux Balance Analysis
Flux Balance Analysis attempts to tackle issues inherent in other methods of metabolic modeling, such as the need
to measure a large number of parameters, slow speed of simulation, and dependence on initial conditions [40, 57].
Other than needing a fairly complete understanding of the reactions present in an organism, the only measurements
required to perform a genome-scale metabolic simulation are those for determining biomass constitution or a gene
11

expression profile [36, 42]. Strictly speaking, FBA is a particular type of constraint based modeling (CBM). Constraint
based modeling frames the stoichiometry that describe the reactions present in an organism as a matrix equation with
indeterminates (reaction fluxes) subject to constraints [39, 42]. The optimization problem is described as follows:
maximize
subject to

cT v
Sv = dx
dt = 0
vlb  v  vub

(1)

S is a matrix, in which rows and columns correspond to cellular metabolites and reactions in the reconstructed
network respectively. v is the reaction flux with upper and lower bounds vub and vlb respectively. Multiplying the
stoichiometric matrix S by the flux vector v equals the concentration change over time ( dx
dt ). At steady state, the flux
through each reaction is given by Sv = 0. Further details on the underlying methods can be found in the literature
[11, 39, 44].
The fluxes of mutations employed in this analysis were restricted to be 50% of the wild-type fluxes found for
growth rate maximization by geometric FBA [44]. To find new conditions with a specified carbon source or other
limiting nutrient that achieves 20% of the high-glucose growth rate, we can solve a linear program for the minimization
of the limiting nutrient uptake while requiring the growth rate to be equal to 20% of the abundant-glucose growthrate. For maximum growth rate conditions (Table S1, Figures 7 and 9), we allowed unrestricted uptake of the limiting
nutrient to obtain the maximum growth in that condition, up to the point where it would reach the high-glucose growth
rate. Mutations affecting protein complexes and pleiotropic genes are handled by uniform restriction across enzymes
as described before [11].

5.2 Definition of epistasis
In each gene mutant pair, the epistasis value is calculated based on the equation: ǫ = W xy − W x Wy , in which W xy is the
fitness of an organism with two mutations in genes X and Y, whereas W x or Wy refers to the fitness of the organism
with mutation only at gene X or Y respectively. Each fitness listed previously is calculated relative to the wild-type
fitness. Absolute fitness values are determined by the value of the biomass maximization objective present in the
model. Finally, a confidence threshold (|ǫ| ≥ 0.01) was applied to generate epistatic interactions [11, 25, 44]. We also
conducted analyses based on a different threshold for epistasis and the general conclusions still hold in our analysis
(Figures 6 and 8).

5.3 Evolutionary rates and network parameters
Evolutionary rates of S. cerevisiae genes were downloaded from supplementary materials of Wall et al. [45], in which
orthologs were defined by four complete genomes of Saccharomyces species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae and Saccharomyces bayanus) and evolutionary rates at synonymous and
nonsynonymous sites were calculated based on a four-way yeast species alignment for S. cerevisiae genes by PAML.
For the distributions in 5A, we randomly sampled gene pairs with the same number of gene pairs as in three epistasis
networks (epistasis in all 16 conditions, extremely stable epistasis, and extremely dynamic epistasis, respectively),
and calculated the average evolutionary rate differences between random gene pairs in each of these three sample sets.
The simulations were repeated 10,000 times for each of the three groups, which are color coded to correspond to the
epistasis networks of the same size.
Network parameters such as the shortest path length, clustering coefficient and closeness were calculated using the
computer software Pajek, downloaded from: http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek. The shortest
path length between two genes in a network reflects the overall network interconnectedness; the smaller the average
shortest path length is, the higher chance that genes in this network could interact with the other genes. The clustering
coefficient of a network is a measurement of the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together; the larger
the average clustering coefficient is, the more closely the genes are connected, forming modules. The closeness of a
network measures the centrality of nodes within a network; nodes that occur on shortest paths with other nodes have
higher closeness than those that do not [58].

Figure 6: More positive differential epistases under environmental perturbations for different thresholds of differential
epistasis (|dǫ| ≥ 0.001, A) and (|dǫ| ≥ 0.05, B). Ratio of positive to negative differential epistases in each simulated condition are shown. The letters A-P represent acetaldehyde, acetate, adenosine 3’,5’-bisphosphate, adenosyl
methionine, adenosine, alanine, allantoin, arginine, ethanol, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol, low glucose, phosphate,
trehalose, and xanthosine, respectively.

Figure 7: Analogous to Figure 1B-C, but using a maximum growth rate for each condition, where the maximum is
constrained to be no higher than the high-glucose growth rate. (A) Percentage of positive and negative differential epistases under ethanol and glycerol conditions. (B) Ratio of positive to negative differential epistases in each simulated
condition. The result from a high-throughput experiment is also shown. The letters A-P represent acetaldehyde, acetate, adenosine 3’,5’-bisphosphate, adenosyl methionine, adenosine, alanine, allantoin, arginine, ethanol, glutamate,
glutamine, glycerol, low glucose, phosphate, trehalose, and xanthosine, respectively. Note that in (B), low glucose has
the same growth rate as high-glucose, but has different epistatic interactions since we still use the high-oxygen uptake
level associated with the low glucose condition.

Figure 8: Epistasis dynamics between environmental perturbations under different epistasis definition. (A) Number
of gene pairs with various epistatic relationships between ethanol and glycerol growth conditions under a lower (|ǫ| ≥
0.001) and a higher (|ǫ| ≥ 0.05) epistasis threshold. (B) The distribution for the percentages of gene pairs with similar
epistasis relations between any 2 of 16 conditions under a lower (|ǫ| ≥ 0.001) and a higher (|ǫ| ≥ 0.05) epistasis
threshold.

Figure 9: Analogous to Figure 3A, but using a maximum growth rate for each condition, where the maximum is
constrained to be no higher than the high-glucose growth rate. Distribution for the number of conditions in which
each epistatic interaction exists. Note that about 26% of epistatic relations are extremely stable (the very right bar) and
about 19% are extremely dynamic (the very left bar).
