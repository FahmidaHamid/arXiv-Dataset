Abstract
Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved problem of
structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and
Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate
protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known
PDZ-2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric
pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property
was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through
the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a
normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 Å) that acted as a thermal rectifier. In
contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60
Å), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat diffusion was
due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of residues that, in
turn, was also mediated by hydrogen bonds. This asymmetrical/symmetrical
energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal communication directionality in
proteins and for the control of heat flow in materials science.

Introduction
Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved
problem in structural biochemistry. This phenomenon is involved in crucial
cellular and physiological functions and is determinant in human diseases. 1-3
Allosteric communication can mediate signal transmission through proteins on
both short (3 Å) and long (100 Å) range scales, and is studied using both
experimental4-12 and theoretical

8,13-19

techniques, and its occurrence has been

clearly established.
Several questions surround the phenomenology of signal transduction and
energy flow in proteins. This paper assesses how energy is transported from one
site to another in proteins. In particular, directionality for energy flow in proteins
was empirically observed. The structure underlying this directional energy flow
was the normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 Å). This result suggests that a
normal length hydrogen bond is the minimal chemical structure that can operate
as a thermal rectifier in biomolecules. Another source of asymmetrical heat
diffusion was found on a higher scale in the local structural organization of
residues, which were also mediated by hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the thermal
rectification effect seemed to be suppressed in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60 Å),
giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical energy flow may be
relevant for allosteric signal communication directionality in protein structures
and for heat flow control in the field of materials science.
Hydrogen bonds have been an inexhaustible source of research for
decades.20 Their role as stabilizing agents in protein structures has been clearly
established.21 They also act in the modulation of chemical reactivity in proteins 2224

and, as has been proposed earlier in the field of physics, can act as a

supporting structure for vibrational energy flow in protein structures. 25 Recent
studies have shown that hydrogen bonds are also important in heat diffusion
across the β-sheet structure of the spider silk protein26 and in α-helices.27
Due to their polymeric nature, when proteins fold to reach their biologically

active state they generate a complex network of contacts. Previous reports have
shown that thermal energy flows in proteins according to the physical
connectivity of this network28, with velocities of propagation on the order of 10 Å
ps-1.14 This flow of thermal energy mimics the heat transport of percolation
clusters, where the energy flows anisotropically, that is, faster along physically
connected channels and slower along the numerous pathways that reach deadends.14 The anisotropic heat flow in proteins was empirically demonstrated by
Ota and Agard using a computational pump-probe method termed Anisotropic
Thermal Diffusion (ATD).30 Anisotropic thermal diffusion is a non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics (MD) pump-probe method that has been used to study
allosteric communication pathways in proteins. 15,29-30 Various studies support a
direct correlation between the heat diffusion pathways in proteins and their
known allosteric communication pathways.15,29-30 In its original formulation,30 the
protein model is equilibrated in the absence of a solvent at a very low
temperature to minimize background noise. After this, a specific residue is
heated by coupling it to a thermal bath (pump), and the increase in vibrational
energy is measured in different sites of the protein (probe) over a short time
lapse. The correlations between anisotropic vibrational energy propagation and
the cognate structural allosteric pathways have been confirmed in other
systems,31

ATD

characterization

and

comprehension of these mechanisms.
In the simplest cases, allosteric communication involves a protein, a ligand
site, and an effector site in the same protein. After ligand binding, a signal is
propagated throughout the protein structure to the effector site. Depending on
the response of the signal on the effector site, allosteric modulation may be
positive or negative.32 As an example of positive modulation, the binding of
vancomicin to the glycopeptide antibiotic facilitates the dimerization of two
molecules of the antibiotic.33 On the other hand, negative modulation is observed
when cAMP molecules bind to the catabolite activator protein (CAP). Here, the
binding of the first cAMP molecule makes the binding of the second cAMP to CAP
more difficult.10

Thermodynamically, the free energy of allosteric processes in proteins has
been interpreted by attributing the enthalpic part to conformational changes in
the protein structure and the entropic contribution to the dynamical fluctuations
of residues.7,34-35 Based on this distinction, three types of allosteric signaling are
distinguished: Type I, with small or subtle conformational changes, governed
largely by entropy (ΔH≈0); Type II, with the participation of enthalpic and
entropic components to different extents; and Type III, largely governed by
enthalpic changes (ΔS≈0).34 Type I allosteric communication has been less
studied as compared to the enthalpic communication of Types II and III. 5-6 Type
I allosterism, also known as dynamic or configurational allosterism, was initially
proposed by Cooper and Dryden35 in 1984. According to these authors, Type I
allosterism

arises

from

changes

in

the

frequencies

and

amplitudes

of

macromolecular fluctuations around the same protein conformation and involves
several forms of dynamic behavior, ranging from highly correlated low-frequency
normal-mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual
groups or atoms. These fluctuations can be described in terms of vibration,
libration, or rotation of individual groups that propagate vibrational energy along
the protein structure.35 Systems such as staphylococcal nuclease, 36 myoglobin,37
serine proteases,38 HIV-1 protease,39 dihydrofolate reductase,40 β−lactamase,41
and the Post–synaptic density-95/Drosophila disc/Zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)
domain protein family7,16,30 are known to transfer allosteric information by
altering their dynamics without significant conformational changes (Type I
allosterism).
The allosteric pathways of the PDZ domain family are also interesting as
they involve residues which are distant in terms of protein structure. The PDZ
protein family has a common structural domain of 80-96 amino-acids, and
appears in signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses, 42 and animals.43
Experimental,7 statistical coupling analysis (SCA), 16 and theoretical models44
have been used to characterize this protein family, and a consensus of its
allosteric pathways has been reached. In particular, using cross-correlation
analysis, Kong and Karplus 19 report two pathways of allosteric communication for

PDZ-2. In Pathway I (Figure 1), the allosteric communication pathway goes from
strand β2 (residues 19-24) and extends along the long axis of the helix α1
(residues 44-49), and Pathway II starts at strand β2 and goes across strands β3
(residues 33-40), β4 (residues 56-61), and β6 (residues 83-90) to β1(residues 613). A structural interpretation for the correlations obtained by SCA 16 was
initially obtained using ATD.30 The pathways of energetic connectivity observed
with ATD were consistent with the correlations between residues found by
SCA.16,30
As ATD is a quick method, it can be extended to the automatic mapping of
heat propagation from every residue in a protein structure. 31 In this numerical
study, a review of the heat propagation pathways of the PDZ-2 protein was
comprehensively performed, and full heat propagation maps of energetic
connectivity were obtained. Confirmation that vibrational energy flows through
the connectivity network via previously reported 19 allosteric pathways is offered,
but it is also shown that these paths of energetic connectivity were not found to
be completely symmetric. The observations suggest that normal length
hydrogen bonds can act as thermal rectifiers for heat diffusion and that this
rectifying capability can be modulated by bond length. The study and
understanding of heat flow directionality

– phonon rectification – is highly

desirable in the field of materials science for the development of thermal gates, 45
thermal memories,46 and acoustic cloakers.47 In this respect, the structural
inclusion of the rich dynamics of hydrogen bonds in the designs of materials
science may be a useful alternative for implementing these thermal devices.
Methods and Computational Details.
The PDZ-2 protein in the presence of the ligand, 19 herein termed PDZ-2·L
(PDB ID: 1D5G), and without the ligand, herein termed PDZ-2 (PDB ID: 3PDZ),
were used for simulations. These models were minimized and equilibrated using
periodic boundary conditions at 298 K and 1 atm with water as an explicit
solvent and NaCl at 0.15 M. Constant temperature conditions were used through

Langevin dynamics with a damping coefficient of 5 ps -1. An integration time-step
of 2 fs and a cutoff of non-bonded forces at 12 Å with a switching function
starting at 10 Å were used. Equilibration was divided into three steps. First, the
coordinates of the protein models were fixed to allow the solvent and ions to
equilibrate for 200 ps. Second, the coordinates of the lateral chains were
released and equilibrated for another 200 ps. Third, all atoms were released and
allowed to equilibrate for 2 ns. Finally, a production run of 20 ns was performed,
after which 20 equally spaced frames were selected for the ATD procedure. For
each of the 20 frames, the solvent was removed and the protein model was
cooled to 10 K for 100 ps MD. At this point, the ATD procedure was applied using
a set of automated scripts31 available at https://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/atdscripts and by adding the option rigidbonds=none. The scripts allowed the
automated, individual heating of each residue of the protein, in addition to
permitting temperature analysis of every other residue after a short predefined
time-lapse of 30 ps. Each residue was individually coupled to a thermal bath at
300 K, and the thermal response in the rest of the protein was measured. A
total of 20 independent ATD scans were performed for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L. The
results were averaged and used to construct the contact and thermal diffusion
maps shown in Figure 2. All simulations were performed using the NAMD2.9
software48 with the CHARMM2249 potential and CMAP correction50. Visualization
and data analysis were performed using the VMD 1.8.7 software.51
Results.
Figures 1 (a) and (b) show the structures of PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L. Figures 2
(a) and (b) show the contact and thermal diffusion maps averaged for 20
independent simulations for both cases. The thermal diffusion maps showed a
rough similarity with the connectivity maps. These plots showed that heat
diffused mainly through structure connectivity. These contacts belonged to the
covalent network of the primary structure or arose from the side-chain
interactions of residues in different elements of the secondary structure of the

models. The thermal maps revealed that the allocation of allosteric Pathways I
and II for both models can be recovered using ATD, and both pathways can be
deduced by inspecting the averaged thermal maps. A close inspection of Figure 2
uncovered how Pathway II was recovered. By looking at the abscissa of the
thermal map for PDZ-2 at β2, a thermal coupling to β3 was observed (Box 1). Next,
looking at the thermal map for the abscissa at β3, a vibrational coupling with β4
was seen (Box 2). Then, entering the thermal map for the abscissa at β4, a
vibrational coupling with β6 appeared (Box 3). Finally, by entering the abscissa at
β6, a strong vibrational coupling to β1 was noted (Box 4). Now, in order to recover
Pathway I, the PDZ-2·L thermal map was analyzed. By entering in the abscissa at
β2, a vibrational coupling with α1 occurred (encircled area). In the case of PDZ-2 a
strong coupling among β2 and α1 was not found. Thus, the presence of the ligand
enhanced this pathway. This can be clearly observed by comparing both thermal
maps. With this inspection, Pathways I and II19 were reproduced.
Vibrational couplings in other regions were affected by the presence of the
ligand. The thermal map of PDZ-2 at abscissa in β3 displayed a strong vibrational
coupling to residues 66-69 (a region between β5 and α2) and to residue 90 of β6.
Both these thermal coupling were quenched in the presence of the ligand.
Therefore, heat propagation was once again found modulated by the presence of
the ligand. This modulation resulted from observable structural rearrangements,
but these were not evident from the contact maps alone. The similarity between
contact maps and thermal maps suggests that communication pathways in Type I
allosteric systems are primarily defined by atomic connectivity and its respective
interaction. In this particular system (PDZ-2), connectivity occurred among
secondary structure elements of the protein.
The structural features that gave rise to the selected energetic couplings
were analyzed in detail. For example, the thermal maps in Figure 2 displayed a
thermal coupling between β2 and His71, corresponding to α2 (highlighted with a
triangle in the thermal maps). In the ligand-free PDZ-2 model (Figure 3a), this
coupling arose from alternating hydrogen bonds between Nδ1 of His71 with Oγ1
or with the oxygen atom of the C=O backbone moiety of Thr23 (Figure 3c, top).

This coupling also occurred from hydrogen bonds between Nδ1 of His71 with Oγ1
or with the oxygen atom of the C=O backbone moiety of Thr23 (Figure 3c,
bottom). This effect was also observed in the thermal map of PDZ-2·L (Figure
3b). In this case, the heat transference between β2 and α2 was also due to the
formation of hydrogen bonds, but it occurred between Nδ1 of His71 and the
oxygen atom of the C=O backbone moiety of Gly24 (Figure 3d, top) or between
Nε2 of His71 and Oγ1 of Thr23 (Figure 3d, bottom). These observations were
consistent with recent reports about the role of hydrogen bonds in heat diffusion
in protein structures.26,27
Further observation of the results presented in Figure 2 revealed interesting
features of heat propagation. Asymmetries were observed in the thermal diffusion
maps. This was qualitatively observed using the color scale of the thermal maps
in Figure 2. For instance, in Pathway II the heat interchange between β6 and β1
was asymmetrical (observed in both PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L). Likewise, the heat
interchange in Pathway I between β2 and α1 was also asymmetrical (observed in
PDZ-2·L). It is quite possible that there is a preferential directionality in both
cases. These asymmetries were observed at other points on the averaged thermal
maps and supported the idea of signal propagation directionality in allosteric
pathways. These asymmetries were rationalized by analyzing structure, pumpprobe plots, and energy flow, as shown in the following cases.
Now, the asymmetrical interaction between Asp5 and Lys91, which are
located in β6 and β1 respectively, of the PDZ-2 case will be presented. These two
residues interacted through a backbone hydrogen bond (Figure 4a). A clear
asymmetrical pump-probe relationship was observed in Figure 4b (circles), in
which heat was transferred with a preferential directionality going from Lys91
towards Asp5. In the 20 propagations (see Methods section), 63% of time these
residues interacted through one backbone hydrogen bond; 4.5% of the time
residues interacted between hydrogen bonds formed by the lateral chains, and
36.5% of the time no interaction was observed (distances greater than 3.5 Å).
The pump-probe profile with standard deviation (Figure 4c) revealed a response
at Asp5 of 98.4 ± 15.9 K when the pump was applied to Lys91, and a response at

Lys91 of 72.5 ± 12.3 when the pump was applied to Asp5. These data, in addition
to the structural inspection of the hydrogen bond interaction, suggest that the
preferential directionality of the heat flow (Lys91 → Asp5) is due to the spatial
orientation of the hydrogen bond, that, in this case, has the configuration Lys91N-H···O=C-Asp5 (Figure 4a, right). To evaluate the possible relationship between
heat flow directionality and orientation of the hydrogen bond, the kinetic energy
in time of the atoms involved was determined and shown for three heat diffusion
trajectories (Figures 4d, 4e, and 4f). As can be observed in Figure 4d, when the
pump was applied to Lys91 a kinetic energy of ~1000 J/mol was observed

at

10000 fs for the oxygen atom of the C=O moiety of Asp5 (Figure 4d, left).
Inversely, when the pump was applied to Asp5 a kinetic energy of ~750 J/mol at
10000 fs was observed for the nitrogen atom of the N-H moiety of Lys91 (Figure
4d, right). The same observations held in Figures 4e and 4f, in which the C=O
moiety consistently reported increased kinetic energy along the propagations.
These results imply that in this particular configuration of the hydrogen bond,
heat diffuses easily in the direction N-H → O=C, and with difficultly in the inverse
direction, N-H ← C=O. The origin of this effect may be due to the structural
asymmetry of the hydrogen-bond and to the consequent stretching force
constants associated with the N-H and C=O bonds (Figure 4a, left). For N-H and
C=O, the stretching force constants were 440 and 620 kcal·mol -1·Å-2, respectively.
Each moiety also had a particular partial charge state that was linked to the force
field and the associated vibrations, which may give rise to the observed
phenomenology. Further analysis is required to give an exact explanation of the
effect, which is beyond the scope of this article. Based on the observations for
this specific case, it appears that the normal hydrogen bond acts as a thermal
rectifier, that is, it can act as a molecular motif that transfers thermal energy with
preferential directionality. This phenomenon is not new and has been observed in
hydrogen-bond

enhanced

thermal

energy

transport

in

functionalized,

hydrophobic, and hydrophilic silica−water interfaces. 52 Nevertheless, the present
report is, to the author's knowledge, the first to demonstrate this phenomenon in
protein structures. In the case of PDZ-2·L, a similar phenomenon was observed

when analyzing the interaction between Asp5-Lys9, but due to the higher
percentage of interaction through lateral chains for the PDZ-2·L, subsequent
discussion is, at this point, restricted only to PDZ-2.
In the case of symmetrical heat diffusion, attention was directed to the
structural

arrangement

of

Glu10-His86-Glu8

in

PDZ-2.

This

arrangement

interacted through two hydrogen bonds (Figure 5a). In this specific case,
hydrogen bonds were intermittently formed between the available proton donors
located at His86 (atoms Nδ1 and Nε2) and the respective proton acceptors (Atoms
Oε1 and Oε2) located at carboxilyc moieties of the Glu10 and Glu8 residues. In
the 20 propagations, >95% presented these interactions. A symmetrical pumpprobe relation was observed in the interaction of Glu10-His86 and His86-Glu8 for
PDZ-2 (Figure 5b, rectangle). The pump-probe plots showed responses at Glu8
and Glu10 of 114.3 ± 11.7 and 120.6 ± 8.6 K, respectively, when His86 was
excited (Figure 5c, left). Inversely, a response at His86 of 120.0 ± 12.6 K was
observed when Glu10 was excited (Figure 5c, right). Finally, a response at His86
of 115.4 ± 7.2 K was observed when Glu8 was excited (plot not shown). These
measurements reinforce the idea of an asymmetrical pump-probe relationship.
Evaluations of the kinetic energy of the hydrogen bonds for the interaction
between Glu10 and HIS86 in three selected trajectories are shown Figures 5d, 5e,
and 5f. On one hand, when the pump was applied to Glu10 a kinetic energy of
~1500 J/mol at 10000 fs was observed for the nitrogen atom of the N-H moiety
of His86 (Figures 5d, 5e, and 5f, left). These measurements showed a higher
value when compared to the kinetic energy analysis when Asp 5 was excited, in
which a response of ~750 J/mol at 10000 fs for the nitrogen atom of the N-H
moiety of Lys91 was found (Figures 4d, 4e, and 4f, left). On the other hand, when
His86 was excited, similar kinetic patterns were observed with respect to the heat
injection to Glu10. Comparison of the kinetic energy plots with the previous
Lys91-Asp5 case supports the idea of a symmetric response of the Glu10-His86
arrangement. The main difference in both cases is that the former formed a
charge-assisted hydrogen bond with an average length of ~2.62 Å (Figure 5, see
insets in kinetic energy analysis), while the latter formed a normal non-charged

hydrogen bond with an average length of ~2.82 Å (Figure 4, see insets in kinetic
energy analysis). An enhanced chemical reactivity of structural elements that
surround hydrogen bonds that can suffer transition from normal bonding (> 2.8
Å) to a short bonding regime (< 2.6 Å) has been previously reported. 23 In line
with this, the results of this report suggest that heat diffusivity behavior, whether
symmetric or asymmetric, may be modulated by the length of the hydrogen
bond.
The asymmetrical pump-probe relationship between the residues His32 and
Glu90 was also analyzed for the ligand-free PDZ-2 model. These residues belong
to Pathway II. As shown in Figure 6a, these residues were located in the loop
connecting β2-β3 and at the end of the β6 strand. A detailed representative
snapshot of the residues that were in contact with His32 and Glu90 is depicted in
Figure 6b. As can be observed in the detail of the thermal map (Figure 6c), a
preferential directionality of heat flow existed, in which the heating of Glu90 had
an increased pump to His32. The pump-probe plots of His32 and Glu90 (Figures
6c and 6d) revealed an effective asymmetric relationship between these two
residues. While the heating of Glu90 raised the local temperature of His32 up to
92.7±17.2 K, the heating of His32 raised the local temperature of Glu90 to
74.5±17.7 K. Analysis of Figure 6b directly explained the results of Figure 6d.
When the pump was applied at Glu90, heat mainly diffused to Arg57, His32, and
Asp5. On the other hand, when the pump was applied at His32, heat diffused to
Arg57 and Glu90. Given that His32 had contact with Glu67 at two alternating or
simultaneous points (Figure 6b), increased quantities of vibrational energy were
transferred to His32, thus quenching the transference to Glu90. Here Glu67 was
the most important heat sink, giving rise to the asymmetrical behavior. Chargeassisted hydrogen bonds were formed between Glu90, Arg57, and His32, while
His32 formed a charge-assisted hydrogen bond with Glu67. It seems that the
counter balance of the contacts gave rise to the observed behavior in this case.
Another example of heat transfer directionality was observed in Pathway I.
This pathway was observed in PDZ-2 and was enhanced in the case of PDZ-2·L
(Figure 2, encircled area). This involved the group of residues Lys13, Asn14,

Asp15, Asn16, and Ser17 located in the loop connecting β2-β6, as well as Gln43
located in the loop connecting β3-α1 (Figure 7a). A particular feature of group 1317 was the formation of a hydrogen bond cluster which formed a loop in this
region (Figure 7b). It seems that this cluster readily exchanged heat within itsel,
through the hydrogen bond cluster, and it then transferred thermal energy to
Gln43. On the other hand, Gln43 was only able to transfer back to Asp15, as can
be observed in the thermal map detail in Figure 7c. In this case, the source of
asymmetric heat diffusion was given by the local three-dimensional organization
of the residues that formed a funnel-like structure pointing towards Gln43, thus
facilitating heat transfer to it, naturally impeding the inverse process. For
completeness, the statistical pump-probe behavior is shown in Figure 7d.
In summary, the results showed that it is possible to recover Pathways I
and II using ATD. These observations suggest an important role of normal length
hydrogen bonds in the directionality of vibrational energy transfer in proteins.
Moreover, the topological organization of residue contacts is proposed as an
important source of directional energy transfer in biomolecules.
Discussion and Conclusions.
Signal transduction in proteins is an important problem in structural
biochemistry.1-19 The aim of this work was to test one methodology, ATD 30, in
order to identify pathways of energy propagation in the PDZ domain and to
correlate them with the cognate I and II allosteric pathways for PDZ-2. This
protein transfers allosteric signals with minor conformational changes 7,9,12,19,53 and
has been cataloged as a Type I entropic allosteric system. 34 This type of allosteric
communication

is

manifested

through

alterations

in

the

frequencies

and

amplitudes of residue fluctuations and involves several forms of dynamic
behavior, from highly correlated, low-frequency normal-mode vibrations to
random local anharmonic motions of individual groups or atoms. 33,35 Evidence
from experimental studies,7

SCA,16 and theoretical analysis19,44 supports the

existence of two allosteric pathways for PDZ-2. In Pathway I (Figure 1), allosteric

communication went from strand β2 and extended along the long axis of the helix
α1. Pathway II started at strand β2 and went across strands β3, β4, and β6 to β1.
The results demonstrate that PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L have similar contact maps
that resemble the thermal diffusion maps. This study concludes that a correlation
exists between the flow of vibrational energy, the cognate I and II allosteric
pathways for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L, and their respective contact maps. Thus, the
connectivity between secondary elements of the protein structure appears to be
the determining factor in Type I allosteric communication. The presence of a
ligand can induce changes in the contacts between secondary elements so that
the ligand can act as a thermal switch for the vibrational coupling of the allosteric
pathways.
The results also show that hydrogen bonds are implicated in the heat flow
among different segments of the protein, as was found in the coupling between β2
and α2. In this case, hydrogen bonds were formed between His71 and Thr23 for
PDZ-2, and between His71 and Thr26 or between His71 and the C=O backbone
moiety of Gly24 for PDZ-2·L. The role of hydrogen bonds in enhancing heat
diffusion has been demonstrated in models of α-helices,27 in which a higher
number of hydrogen bonds produces higher thermalization rates. The role of
hydrogen bonds in heat diffusion has also been shown in spider silk. 26 Thus, the
observations of the present study are consistent with and supported by these
previous reports.
The main result of this research was the detection of preferential heat flow
directionality along allosteric pathways. This directionality was observed through
the details provided by the thermal maps for PDZ-2 and PDZ-2·L. Directionality
occurred in the absence of a ligand and could be modulated by its presence. This
phenomenon was studied at points of PDZ-2 and was consistent with the
expected behavior of an allosteric protein, that is, to transfer signals with
preferential directionality. The smallest organizational unit that presents this
property is the hydrogen bond. A punctual analysis of the interaction between
Asp5 and Lys91 suggested that normal length hydrogen bonds behave as thermal
rectifiers, which is to say, they transfers vibrational energy with preferential

directionality. This effect may originate from the natural asymmetry of the
hydrogen bond given by the N-H and C=O moieties. Also, because N-H is a single
bond and C=O is a double bond, the amplitude of the stretching that each moiety
reaches during similar thermal excitation is higher for the latter and lower for the
former. Further research is required to reveal the mechanism of the asymmetrical
heat diffusion in this particular structure. The role of hydrogen bonds as thermal
diodes has been previously proposed in MD simulations of asymmetrical
functionalized silica slabs floating in water. 52 In these simulations, one side of the
silica is hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. Heat flow is favored when applied
in the hydrophobic to hydrophilic direction and impeded in the inverse direction.
On a smaller scale, this research shows that the heat flow is favored in the
direction of N-H → O=C and impeded in the inverse direction. This behavior is
compromised in the case of short hydrogen bonds, as was observed in the pumpprobe analysis of the interaction of Glu10-His86. As Glu and His have -1 and +1
charges, respectively, both assisted the formation of short hydrogen bonds, ~2.6
Å. This was the main difference in regards to the interaction between Asp5-Lys91,
which presented a normal hydrogen bond of length of ~2.85 Å. It seems that the
short distances between the N-H and the C=O moieties observed for the
interaction between Glu10-His86 impeded the asymmetric behavior of thermal
diffusion. Quantum mechanical models have previously shown that the transition
between a normal and short bonding regime significantly alters the chemical
reactivity of the structural elements that surround a given hydrogen bond. 23 The
present study, using classical MD, suggests that the transition from a normal to a
short hydrogen bond regime may modulate the thermal diode effect.
Asymmetrical heat transference was also observed in the complex
interaction of residues, as depicted in Figures 6 and 7. In the case of the
asymmetrical pump-probe relationship between Glu90-His32, a set of hydrogenbonded interacting residues explains the observed directionality. For example,
when heat was provided to Glu90, it was directly transferred to His32, Arg57, and
to Asp5, whereas the structural organization surrounding His32, namely, Gly33
and Glu67, quenched the heat transfer to Glu90. As shown in the pump-probe

plot of His32, Glu67 acted as a thermal sink that trapped an important quantity of
heat. So, the topological organization of a set of interacting residues may be the
reason for asymmetrical heat diffusion behavior. A similar phenomenology seems
to be operative in the interaction of residues 13-17 and Gln43 (Figure 7).
Observation of the structure at this segment revealed a hydrogen bond network
organization similar to a funnel pointing towards residue Gln43. As residues 1317 were heated, they distributed heat among each other and transferred it to
Gln43, while the heating of Gln43 mainly transferred back to residue Asp15. This
residue was the individual heat connection of group 13-17 to Gln43. All the
previous data suggest an important role of hydrogen bonds in vibrational coupling
among segments of the secondary structure in this system and, therefore, in the
constitution of allosteric pathways.
In summary, this work analyzed the vibrational energy diffusion in PDZ-2
and the correlation with cognate allosteric pathways for this system. Examples of
asymmetrical heat propagation in protein structures that give rise to signal
directionality were also offered. Thermal diffusion maps showed a high degree of
similarity with connectivity maps, thus supporting the idea that Type I allosteric
communication is the connectivity network that defines the allosteric route and its
directionality. Taken together, it is suggested that hydrogen bonds play an
important role as a transport structure for heat and thermal rectification in the
allosteric communication pathways of proteins.
