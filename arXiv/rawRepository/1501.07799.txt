We develop a framework in which the activity of nonlinear pulse-coupled oscillators is posed
within the renewal theory. In this approach, the evolution of inter-event density allows for a selfconsistent calculation that determines the asynchronous state and its stability. This framework,
can readily be extended to the analysis of systems with more state variables. To exhibit this, we
study a nonlinear pulse-coupled system, where couplings are dynamic and activity dependent. We
investigate stability of this system and we show it undergoes a super-critical Hopf bifurcation to
collective synchronization.

The collective dynamics of pulse-coupled networks of
nonlinear oscillators has been studied extensively [1]. In
the presence of noise, the approach has been to analyze
the Fokker-Planck equation of the state variables of the
oscillators. This has been highly successful for systems
with units described by a single variable. However, it has
proven to be difficult to extend this approach to systems
with several state variables. This is because in such systems the Fokker-Planck equation may have a highly nontrivial boundary conditions [2]. An other long standing
theoretical framework to study irregularly pulsing units
is the theory of the stochastic point processes. In this
theory, the event times are described by probability density functions which are history dependent. Solutions of
the first passage time problem have long been used to
connect this phenomenological description to the underlying dynamics of the state variables [3].
In this letter, we marry these two approaches, exploiting the fact in that pulse-coupled systems the recurrent
inputs into the units is fully determined by the timing
of events. The only element that needs to be added to
the first passage time description, is the self-consistency
of the interactions and the network output. We first
demonstrate our method on a simple system and show
that the description of asynchronous state and its stability is consistent with previously derived results [4, 5]. We
then add a dynamic component to the interactions. This
addition is not readily incorporated within the FokkerPlank approach, however, it is easily incorporated in our
formalism. Such dynamic recurrent couplings can be observed in many physical systems. For instance, temporal dynamics of intracellular signaling activities is tightly
regulated by positive or negative feedback [6], similarly
biochemical processes concerning transmitter production
and release in synapses in the network of neurons are
known to be modulated by the activity of interacting
cells [7, 8].
We consider a network of N identical oscillators with
all-to-all feedback coupling, which receives a noisy exter-

nal input. We assume that the oscillators are modeled
as integrate and fire neurons, where their the membrane
voltage is the state variable. Between events the (normalized) voltage xi , of oscillator i satisfies
τm

d
xi = ιi (t) − xi ,
dt

(1)

where τm is the membrane time constant and ιi is the
input current into oscillator i. When the voltage reaches
the threshold, xthr = 1, the oscillator emits a pulse
and the voltage is immediately reset to the resting potential, xr = 0. The input, ιi , can be written as
ιi = ιi,ext + ιi,fb where ιi,ext and ιi,fb are the external
and feedback input respectively. The external current is
given by ιi,ext (t) = µext + σηi (t), where the ηi s are independent Gaussian white noise variables, hηi (t)i = 0 and
hηi (t)ηj (t0 )i = δij (t − t0 ). When a oscillator emits a pulse
at time tk , this causes a, so-called synaptic, current input
s(t − tk ) in all oscillators. This input is given by
s(t) =

(2)

where Θ is the Heaviside function. Here τs2 and τs1 are
the synaptic rise and decay times. We study the network
in the thermodynamic limit (N → ∞). In this limit
the total recurrent input into all oscillators is identical,
ιi,fb = µfb , and is given by

with initial condition ρ(x, t0 |t0 ) = δ(x) and boundary condition ρ(1, t|t0 ) = 0. The difficulty in solving this is in
satisfying the boundary condition. For an unrestricted
process, which satisfies Eqn. (4) it is straightforward to
show that with initial condition xi (t0 ) = x0 the probability density ρ̂(x, t|x0 , t0 ) for xi (t) = x satisfies, for t ≥ t0

The right hand side of this equation is now a convolution

The problem with initial condition ρ(x, t0 |t0 ) = δ(x) and

where ρ̂eq,L is the Laplace transform of ρ̂eq . In the
supplementary material [9], we show that the Laplace
transform of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck density ρ̂eq,L , can be
formally calculated (for an alternative derivation refer to [10]). Now, we can close the system, since
the average inter-event interval, hti, can be found using hti = −lims→0 dPreq,L (s)/ds and this allows to express req = 1/hti in terms of µeq and σ, together with
µeq = µext + gs req that determines req .
To determine the stability of the asynchronous state
we consider the evolution of small perturbations around
the equilibrium firing rate, r(t) = req + r1 (t). With such
a perturbation the noise averaged input into oscillators
µ(t) satisfies µ(t) = µeq + µ1 (t), where µ1 is given by

Thus, we can expand ρ̂ as ρ̂(x, t|x0 , t0 ) = ρ̂eq (x, t−t0 |x0 )+

In the asynchronous state the emission rate is constant,
r(t) = req , and we have µ(t) = µeq = µext + gs req . Consequently, ρ̂ is given by ρ̂(x, t|x0 , t0 ) = ρ̂eq (x, t − t0 |x0 ),
where ρ̂eq (x, t|x0 ) satisfies Eqn. (5) with xave (t|x0 , t0 ) =
xave,eq (t−t0 |x0 ) = µeq +(x0 −µeq ) exp(−[t−t0 ]/τm ). Note
that for t →√∞, ρ̂eq (x, t|x0 ) → ρ̂∞ (x)
√ ≡ exp(−(x −
µeq )2 /2Σ2∞ )/ 2πΣ∞ , where Σ∞ = σ/ 2τm , Additionally, the inter-event probability density can be written as
Pr(t|t0 ) = Preq (t − t0 ) as this density is time invariant in
the stationary asynchronous regime. This density must
satisfy the following Volterra integral equation

Next, we write for the inter-events probability density
Pr(t|t0 ) = Preq (t − t0 ) + Pr1 (t|t0 ) + O(2 ) and insert
this with the expansion for ρ̂ in Eqn. (9), to obtain for

In this linearized system, we can make the usual Ansatz
that r1 (t) = rλ eλt . With this Ansatz we will, as we

we will demonstrate that the stability analysis of these
systems can be treated effortlessly. Here, without loss
of generality, we focus on the couplings with depressive
interactions (e.g. negative feedback). The network is as
before, except that the recurrent input due to a event of
oscillator i depends on the strength factor pi , denoted as
release factor. For instance, in network of neurons with
depressive couplings the biophysical meaning of pi is the
amount of vesicles that are available in synapses. The
recurrent input is given by

where rr (t) is the rate of release rather then the event
emission
P rate. The release rate is given by rr (t) =
uN −1 i,k pi (t− )δ(t − tik ), where u is the release fraction (see [8]). Between events the vesicles are replenished
with a time constant τD , dpi /dt = (1 − pi )τD and at the
time of the event an amount upi of vesicles is released
and pi is reset to (1 − u)pi . It is straightforward to show
that if the event density is Pr(t|t0 ), the release rate rr

The rate in the asynchronous solution can be determined
as follows: Given µeq and σ we calculate the Laplace
transform PrL of the inter-event distribution as before.
ρ̂λ,L (1, s|0) − ρ̂λ,L (1, s|1)Preq,L (s)
This determines the equilibrium rate. Using this and
. (22)
Prλ,L (s) =
ρ̂eq,L (1, s + λ|1)
Eqn. (26), then we obtain for the steady state release
rate rr,eq = ureq /[1 − (1 − u) PrL (1/τD )]. The selfHere ρ̂λ,L , the Laplace transform of ρ̂λ that satisfies

µeq = µext +gs rr.eq . Now, it is also straightforward to ex∂
ρ̂λ,L (x, s|x0 ) = − Bλ (ρ̂0,L (x, s|x0 )−ρ̂0,L (x, s+λ+τm −1 |x0 )) tend the stability analysis to this model. We starts with

eigenvalue equation (Eqn. 17) as Pr0,L (λ)+req Prλ,L (0) =
and r(t) = req + eλt rλ , with Prλ and rλ proportional to
1, and plugging it in the expressions for the Laplace
rr,λ . Combining this with Eqn. (26) and requiring selftransforms obtained above, we find that the straightforconsistency leads to the following eigenvalue equation

coupled oscillators with interactions. We additionally
characterized the asynchronous state and its stability.
For static interactions, this result coincides with the result from the classical Fokker-Planck approach. However, as we showed our approach is easily extended to
incorporate the effect of dynamical coupling. Using this,
we investigated how networks with interaction through
couplings with short-term depression undergoes a Hopf
bifurcation to a state with collective synchronization, socalled population spikes. The method also allows for a
efficient way to simulate the dynamics of systems in their
thermodynamic limits [9]. We showed in this limit the
system may exhibit a super-critical Hopf bifurcation. Up
to now, the collective effect of activity dependent modulation of interaction in a network has only been analyzed in models without non-linear contributions of the
inter-event density [8, 11]. In such networks interesting
phenomena such a as Shilnikov chaos has been observed
when positive feedback (e.g. facilitation) are added [11].
It is straightforward to extend our approach to study
those cases where the network of oscillators with selfconsistent inter-event density (e.g. spiking neurons) are
also considered. The method presented in here relies on
our ability to calculate ρ̂, the solution of the unrestricted
of Fokker-Planck equation. Once this is achieved imposing the necessary boundary conditions is easy using the
presented method. Thus we believe that our approach
will have a wide range of applications.

The approach introduced here can be utilized to evolve
a system for N → ∞, as the time dependent inter-event
density can be self-consistently determined. By exploiting this, we numerically evolve a network with depressive
coupling [9] to study the behavior near the bifurcation
point. The activity continuously changes after the bifurcation point (Fig.2) and the amplitude of collective
synchrony grows indicting a super-critical Hopf bifurcation [9].
In the present letter, we derived self-consistent description of the inter-event distribution of non-linear pulse
