Abstract
In this article, we follow the trajectory of a photon in the human
cornea. Prior to experimental evidence of the cornea’s gradient refractive
index (GRIN) nature, schematic eye models used a constant or average
as the corneal refractive index. A few recent models respect the intracorneal GRIN, but are based on the paraxial approximation, and thereby
have limited validity in peripheral visual field analysis and non-paraxial
photon tracking. Here, we introduce the Trajectron algorithm. It uses a
closed form solution of the ray equation of constant axial GRIN media, and
evaluates over piece-wise constant GRIN. Using Trajectron, we present
the first quantitative demonstration of non-paraxial intra-corneal lightbending phenomena. This demonstration has significant implications in
the development of refractive surgery algorithms.

Introduction
Aim

To determine the trajectory of a photon being observed in the human cornea,
from a point within the anterior central corneal epithelium to a point within
the posterior stroma.

1.2

Motivation

Refractive error places an enormous disease burden on society, with net estimates of over two billion people affected worldwide [1, 10, 45, 48, 47, 12, 38,
40, 8, 39, 11]. Myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, astigmatism, and cataracts are
among the most common forms of refractive error. Refractive surgery is an effective and growing method of correcting refractive error. There are a high volume
of cases performed annually, including cataract extractions with intraocular lens
placement, laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) by microkeratome incision or by femtosecond laser incision, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and
1

laser-assisted sub-epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK). Refractive surgery techniques and technologies have seen significant advances over the years including
current reports of greater than 90% patient satisfaction post-operatively [42, 4].
However, outcomes remain suboptimal and patients are often still left to manage
imperfect vision following surgery. Most modern refractive surgery techniques
involve direct modification of the corneal epithelium and stroma. It is therefore important to have a precise and detailed understanding of the refractive
properties along this path. It is additionally imperative to understand how
those properties govern the behavior of light both as a source of visual stimulus,
and in amplified form, as lasers for refractive and other ophthalmic intervention. Furthermore, a precise quantitative mapping of the refractive properties
of the human cornea is requisite for good design of keratoprosthetic implants.
In this paper, we embark on a mathematical exploration of the photon trajectory from the anterior central corneal epithelium to the posterior stroma.
We operate within the realm of geometric optics, which assumes the limit of
short wavelength, where light propagation can be approximated by rays and
studied using geometry. We introduce the Trajectron algorithm for computing the photon trajectory in a model respectful of the cornea’s axial GRIN
nature. Meridional intra-corneal GRIN is of significantly less magnitude than
axial intra-corneal GRIN, and is assumed to be zero in this model. Trajectron
uses a closed form solution of the ray equation of constant axial GRIN media,
and evaluates over piece-wise constant GRIN. One advantage of Trajectron is
that it is not restricted to the paraxial regime. This makes it eligible for the
study of non-paraxial optical phenomena such as peripheral visual field analysis,
as well as higher-order aberrations before and after refractive surgery.

Related work

Previous mathematical models of the human eye assumed the corneal refractive
index to be constant [2, 41, 28, 27]. Such models were proposed when less was
known about the intra-corneal GRIN nature. A few recent models based on
ray-transfer matrix (ABCD) analysis incorporate the intra-corneal GRIN nature. Barbero proposed a multilayer model of cornea and tear-film to calculate
corneal power. His global ray-transfer matrix was a product of 7 matrices representing ray transfer through 4 interfaces and 3 media which included a GRIN
stroma [5]. Flores-Arias et al proposed a linear cascade model expressing the
generalized fresnel integral transform kernel in terms of paraxial coefficients;
where the global ray-transfer matrix was a product of anterior chamber, GRIN
cornea, and GRIN lens component ray-transfer matrices [14, 32]. These newer
models incorporating the GRIN nature represent a significant advance. One
disadvantage however, is that they are restricted to the paraxial regime, and
this limits their validity for peripheral visual field analysis and non-paraxial
photon tracking. In contrast, our current work is useful for investigating interesting non-paraxial optical phenomenology, because it respects the intra-corneal
GRIN nature, and is not restricted to the paraxial regime.

Contributions

In this paper we make the following technical and biophysical contributions:

2

• The first quantitative demonstration of non-paraxial light-bending within
the human cornea.
• An analytico-numerical algorithm, Trajectron, for determining the photon
trajectory within the human cornea, respecting axial GRIN and assuming
zero meridional GRIN.
• A method for studying non-paraxial optical phenomena in the human
cornea. For example:
– Peripheral visual field analysis
– Higher order aberrations pre and post refractive surgery
• An approach towards describing the angular domain over which the paraxial approximation is clinically useful in the human cornea.

1.5

Methods

We use a hybrid approach inter-weaving between analytical and numerical processes. Our objective is to determine the ray path from a point in the anterior
central corneal epithelium to a point in the posterior stroma. The human cornea
has an axial GRIN of non-constant magnitude [31], and we approximate it as also
having zero meridional GRIN. This approximation is made because, although
meridional intra-corneal GRIN has been demonstrated in-vivo in humans [44],
it is significantly less than the axial intra-corneal GRIN [31]. To achieve our
objective, we introduce Trajectron, a new algorithm which evaluates a closed
form solution of the ray equation of constant axial GRIN media, over piece-wise
constant axial GRIN. The details of the Trajectron algorithm are presented in
Section (5) below. Discrete measurements of corneal refractive indices are obtained from the literature, and a continuous distribution is generated by curve
fitting. Trajectron is prototyped in MATLAB® (The MathWorks Inc., Natick,
MA).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section (2) outlines
the physical formalism of lagrangian optics and includes a known closed form
solution of the ray equation of constant axial GRIN media; Section (3) describes structure, thickness, and refractive index measurements within the human cornea; Section (4) introduces the Trajectron algorithm; Section (5) presents
the results of our numerical experiments; Section (6) discusses the findings, the
study limitations, and the clinical angular domain of the paraxial and nonparaxial regimes; and Section (7) concludes the paper.

Physical Formalism

Fermat’s principle of stationary time asserts that light travels along the path
that takes the least (or greatest) time. In the context of a classical mechanics
treatment, Fermat’s principle is fully described by the lagrangian of geometric
optics, given by,
p
(1)
L = n(x, y, z) 1 + ẋ2 + ẏ 2 ,

where n is the refractive index distribution, x, y, and z are spatial coordi∂q
. While x and y take the role of generalized coordinates, z
nates, and q̇ := ∂z
describes the optical axis and takes the role of parameter.
The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are given by,

where Equation (2) encodes three equations: with q = x, q = y, and q = z.

the ray equation,

which represents the equations of motion for propagation of a light ray
through a medium of refractive index distribution n(x, y, z). In Equation (3), r
is the spatial position vector [x, y, z] of the ray, ∇ is the gradient operator,
and ∂s
p
is the arc length along the ray trajectory, and is given by ∂s = ∂z 1 + ẋ2 + ẏ 2 .
In the case of constant refractive index gradient, α, along the optical axis
direction, and zero refractive index gradient along the other two cardinal directions, Equation (3) can be written as,

The ray r = [x, y, z] is embedded in a 2-dimensional
plane. This plane

of propagation is defined by the optical axis and dsi , where i denotes the
point along the optical
axis in the anterior corneal epithelium where we initiate

observation, and dsi denotes the ray direction at i. The embedding, (x, y, z) −→
(r, z), is given by,
x = r cos(ψ),
y = r sin(ψ),
z = z,

ray trajectory. Equation (4) in conjunction with the constancy of p1 and p2 ,
constrain the ray r to the (r, z) plane.
Applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to the conservation relation
for optical momentum shown in Equation (7), one obtains the following known
closed form solution of the ray equation in constant axial GRIN media [33],

Measurement

Closed-form and numerical solutions of the ray equation of axial GRIN media
require knowledge of the GRIN. The gradients can be approximated by the
difference quotients. This requires appropriately sampled measurements of refractive index and thickness. Below, we examine the literature for the required
measurements in the four corneal layers along the photon trajectory of interest: (i) corneal epithelium, (ii) Bowman’s layer, (iii) anterior stroma, and (iv)
posterior stroma.

3.1

Corneal epithelium

The corneal epithelium is a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium [21]
of 5-7 cell layers with rapid surface turn over. The corneal epithelium is covered
by mucinous tear film anteriorly, and is adjacent to Bowman’s layer posteriorly.
The morphology of the air-tear film interface approximately conforms to the
corneal epithelial surface. Corneal epithelial surface layer abrasions can cause
significant visual distortion, and can manifest photophobia and moderate to
severe amounts of pain. However as a result of limbal stem cell activity [26],
abrasions typically heal in 24-48 hours in healthy individuals. Both LASEK
and PRK procedures involve manipulation of the corneal epithelium. In PRK,
the epithelial layer is removed entirely by mechanical or alcohol debridement,
to allow for laser ablation of the anterior stroma [30, 7]. In LASEK, an alcohol
solution is used to disrupt the epithelial layer, creating a flap which is then
replaced following laser ablation of anterior stroma [3, 7].
3.1.1

Corneal epithelial thickness

There have been several measurements of human central corneal epithelial thickness by various modalities. Significant variation exists in the findings, but almost all the results have been in the 49-60 µm range. The following is a sample of prior work in this area. King-Smith et al used interferometry to make

5

measurements on 6 healthy eyes, and found a corneal epithelial thickness of
49.7 µm (±2.2 µm) [20]; Li et al used Confocal Microscopy Through Focusing
(CMTF) on 7 healthy subjects and found a thickness of 50.6 µm (±3.9 µm) [25];
and Reinstein et al used Very High Frequency Ultrasound (VHFU) on 110 eyes
in 56 subjects who presented for refractive surgery, and they found a thickness of 53.4 µm (±4.6 µm) [36]. Ladage et al conducted a prospective randomized double-blind study on 246 subjects, assessing the effects of contact
lens type and oxygen transmissibility on corneal epithelium in daily wear [23].
The study consisted of three treatment groups: high oxygen-transmissible soft
lenses (n= 36 subjects), hyper oxygen-transmissible soft lenses (n=135 subjects), and hyper oxygen-transmissible rigid gas permeable lenses (n=75 subjects), in each of which baseline central corneal epithelial thickness was measured using CMTF and found to be 48.55 µm (±3.2 µm), 49.26 µm (±3.44 µm),
and 49.79 µm (±3.25 µm) respectively. There have been a number of studies
using optical coherence tomography (OCT) [18, 43] to estimate central corneal
epithelial thickness in humans. Wang et al used OCT on 20 healthy eyes in
40 subjects and found a thickness of 57.8 µm (±1.7 µm) [46]; Feng et al used
OCT on 10 healthy subjects and found a thickness of 58.4 µm (±2.5 µm); and
Radhakrishnan et al used 1310 nm real-time OCT to make measurements on 5
healthy subjects, and found a thickness of 55 µm [34]. Table (1) summarizes
the central corneal epithelial thickness for the above mentioned studies.

Corneal epithelial refractive index

Patel et al used a modified hand-held refractometer to measure the refractive
index in 10 human eyes in-vivo, and found a value of 1.401 (±0.005) [31]. There
have been few if any other in-vivo estimations of corneal epithelium refractive
index in humans.

3.2

Bowman’s layer

In humans, Bowman’s layer sits posterior to the corneal epithelium and contains
randomly arranged collagen fibrils, which on transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), appear to be continuous with the more regularly arranged fibrils of the
stroma. Fibrils in Bowman’s layer were only half to two thirds the diameter of
those in the stroma, suggesting that Bowman’s layer fibrils may be a condensation of stromal fibrils [19]. Using TEM, Hayashi et al found the collagen fibril
6

diameter to be 20 nm [17] in Bowman’s layer and 20-30 nm in the stroma [17];
and Komai et al found fibril diameters of 25 nm in Bowman’s layer and 25-35
nm in the stroma [22].
3.2.1

Bowman’s layer thickness

There have been few measurements of human Bowman’s layer thickness, most of
which have fallen in the 10−17 µm range. In Hayashi et al’s TEM studies, measurements were made on an excised conical cornea and found a central thickness
of 10 µm. Li et al’s CMTF studies on 7 healthy subjects found a thickness of
16.6 µm (±1.1 µm)d [25]; King-Smith et al’s interferometry measurements on
6 healthy eyes found a thickness of 14.6 µm (±1.4 µm) [20]; and Komai et al’s
TEM studies on 8 eye-bank eyes found a thickness of 8-12 µm [22]. Table (2)

Bowman’s layer refractive index

There have been no reported measurements of the refractive index function of
Bowman’s layer in humans. However, anterior stroma is intermediate between
Bowman’s layer and posterior stroma, in terms of several structural features such
as axial depth, susceptibility to hydration swelling [29], degree of hydration [24],
collagen fibril diameter [17], and regularity of fibril arrangement [15]. It is
therefore reasonable to conjecture that the refractive indicex function of the
anterior stroma is intermediate between those of Bowman’s layer and posterior
stroma. This is premised on the notion that the group refractive index of a
substance is a function of the refractive indices of the biochemical constituents
of that substance. Hence the group refractive index can be estimated by a
weighted summation rule such as the Gladstone-Dale relation; or it can be
estimated by interpolation, as we do here.

3.3

Anterior corneal stroma

The stroma constitutes approximately 90% of the corneal thickness, and the
anterior stroma is the major target for ablation and remodelling in most refractive surgery procedures. The anterior stroma consists of intermediate regularity
type I collagen fibrils, 20-35 nm in diameter [17, 22]. On scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the collagen fibrils are seen bundled into lamellae which are
piled in parallel stacks of about 300 lamellae in the central cornea and about
500 at the limbus [35]. The anterior stromal lamellae are 0.2–1.2 µm thick and
0.5–30 µm wide [22], and are interconnected at points either via interlamellae
crossing collagen fibrils or via anastomosing sublamellae [35], consistent with

7

Maurice and Gallagher’s earlier findings in the rabbit cornea [16]. The architecture of the anterior stroma confers shape, curvature, rigidity, and hydration
resistance to the cornea [29, 6].
3.3.1

Anterior corneal stroma thickness

The anterior corneal stroma has no conventionally defined thickness or demarcation, but the anterior 100 − 120 µm of the stroma has been shown to be
physiologically distinguishable from more posterior stroma [29].
3.3.2

Anterior corneal stroma refractive index

The refractive index of anterior stroma was observed as 1.38 (±0.005) by Patel
et al, using a bench Abbé refractometer to make measurements on bare stroma
of fresh human corneas [31].

3.4

Posterior corneal stroma

The posterior stroma differs from anterior stroma in a number of ways. Ultrastructural studies done in rabbit and humans corneas found the posterior
stroma to have a greater degree of regularity of collagen fibril arrangement than
the anterior stroma [15]. Unlike anterior lamellae, posterior lamellae may course
the entire length of the cornea without branching, and they are typically 1.0
–2.5 µm thick and 100–200 µm wide, which is larger in dimension than anterior
lamellae [22]. Horizontal branching occurs among both anterior and posterior
lamellae, however only anterior lamellae exhibit axial branching [22]. In addition, the posterior stroma has been found to be more susceptible to hydration
and swelling than the anterior stroma [29]. Though the posterior stroma is
largely spared in current refractive surgery procedures, it becomes the cornea’s
primary source of structural support and bulk following laser ablation of the
anterior stroma.

3.5

Posterior stroma thickness

The posterior stroma can be reasonably designated as the posterior two-thirds to
three-quarters of the stroma. Reinstein et al used VHFU to measure net stromal
thickness across the central 10 mm of the cornea in 110 normal eyes, and they
found a vertex thickness of 465.4 ± 36.9 µm and a thickness of 461.8 ± 37.3 µm
at the thinnest point [37]. Erie et al used in-vivo confocal microscopy on 18 eyes
of 12 patients presenting for LASIK, and they found a net stromal thickness of
491 ± 35 µm pre-operatively [9].

3.6

Posterior stroma refractive index

Patel et al used a bench Abbé refractometer on bare stroma of fresh human
cornea, and found a posterior stroma refractive index of 1.373 (±0.001). This
differed from the refractive index of the anterior stroma which they found to be
1.38 (±0.005) [31].

3.7

Refractive index distribution

We fit a curve, shown in Figure (1), to Patel’s experimentally measured data
points [31] shown in Table 3. The fit curve’s expression is given by,
n(z) = 1.3952z −0.003

(11)

where z ≥ 0.2 is the displacement (in µm) along the optical axis, n(z) is
the refractive index at z, and we have chosen z = 0 µm as the central corneal
epithelial surface, z = 0.2 µm as the initial observation point of the photon
in the corneal epithelium, z = 67 µm as the observation point in the anterior
stroma, and z = 550 µm as the observation point in the posterior stroma. These
choices are consistent with the literature data.

Computation

Here we describe the Trajectron algorithm for computing the trajectory of a
photon in the human cornea, based on geometric optics and the following two
assumptions: (i) non-zero axial GRIN, and (ii) zero meridional GRIN.

4.1

The Trajectron Algorithm

We discretize the optical axis into N segments, with finer segments over Bowman’s layer because it has a faster changing refractive index gradient than both

9

the corneal epithelium and stroma. To compute the photon trajectory over the
jth segment we require: (i) the incident refractive index, nj (0), (ii) the incident
location of the ray, rj (0), (iii) the refractive index difference quotient α̂j , and
(iv) the angle θj (0) which the incident optical momentum, pj (0), makes with the
optical axis. In the above notation we have used the domain parametrization,
0 ≤ zj ≤ 1, over each discrete segment Dj , such that fj denotes the restriction of an arbitrary function f over the jth segment, fj (0) denotes the value
of f at the start point of the jth segment, and fj (1) denotes the value of fj at
endpoint of the jth segment. Domain segment boundary points are related by,
Dj (1) = Dj+1 (0), for every j.
(i) We obtain nj (0) simply by evaluating the fit curve in Equation (11). (ii)
The incident ray location is given by,
rj (0) = rj−1 (1),

(12)

where rj−1 (1), is the ray location at the end of the previous segment and is
available from the previous computation.
(iii) The difference quotient is readily computed by,
nj (1) − nj (0)
.
Dj (1) − Dj (0)

where F (j) is an evaluation of the closed form solution using the jth segment parameters obtained as described above. The Trajectron algorithm is

Results

We conducted 40 numerical experiments with 0 < θ0.2 < π2 , each of which
demonstrated bending of the photon trajectory within the human cornea. Results of the first 20 numerical experiments are displayed in Table (5). The
θ0.2 values ranged from 2.21 to 79.05 degrees and resulted in θ550 values which
ranged from 2.25 to 90 degrees. A photon with a θ0.2 of 0 degrees will proceed
along a straight line trajectory. However, for all other θ0.2 values, some degree
of bending occurs. Figure (2) plots both the photon trajectory (solid line) and
the ray initial tangent (dashed line) for a photon with a θ0.2 of 78.97 degrees.

Figure 2: Photon trajectory with θ0.2 of 78.97 degrees and θ550 of 88.67 degrees
(solid line). Also showing initial tangent direction (dashed line)
As the θ0.2 values approach 90 degrees, the bending of the photon trajectory
increases, and becomes increasingly and exquisitely dependent on angle. The
difference, δ, between the initial tangent line and the photon trajectory is a
measure of the extent of bending. We use δz to denote the displacement along
the r-axis at position z µm due to light bending. Table (5) shows the δz values
at 70µm, 200µm, 400µm, and 550µm. In the next 20 numerical experiments,
we computed photon trajectories with θ0.2 values clustered closer to 90 degrees.
Specifically, the θ0.2 values ranged from 77.68 to 78.72 degrees and resulted in
θ550 values ranging from 85 degrees to 89.75 degrees. The photon trajectories
were noted to bend away from the optical axis in a concave upwards direction
as shown in Figure (3).

Discussion

Until recently, schematic eye models assumed a constant or average corneal refractive index [2, 41, 28, 27]. Since emerging evidence of corneal GRIN nature,
a few newer models have respected the GRIN. But like their older counterparts,
these newer models are based on paraxial approximation and ray transfer matrix analysis [14, 32, 5]. The first-order paraxial approximation of the wave

equation in shortwavelength limit, is one whose solutions are rays propagating
along straight lines. And this linearity allows an optical system to be modelled using ray-transfer matrix analysis. The fitness of these ray-transfer matrix
analyses depend on the magnitude of high frequency coefficients in the fourier
transform of the refractive index function. In the case of highly varying refractive index gradient and consequently highly varying ray spatial gradient,
linear approximations have limited validity. And a prohibitively large number
of optical elements or ray transfer matrices may be required to obtain a good
approximation of the ray path. The transition zone between the corneal epithelium and Bowman’s layer is an example of such a steep gradient, where
finer linearization granularity is required. There is not a general notion of when
linear approximation approaches may begin to lose validity, as the small angle approximation, sin(θ) ≈ θ, has no defined boundary. For this reason the
angular domain over which the paraxial approximation is clinically applicable
is not clear. Yet clinically, refractive error measurements and correction are
based on paraxial approximation. Results of our numerical experiments shown
in Figure (3) may help us gain some traction on this issue. We see an increase
in non-linearity with θ0.2 . This increase in non-linearity is correlated with a loss
of paraxial approximation validity. Also from Figure (3), we see that linear-like
form is preserved over a much wider angle than only those for which sin(θ) ≈ θ.
This suggests that the angular domain over which the paraxial approximation
is clinically applicable is more broad than suggested by the small angle approximation alone. For instance, for a θ0.2 of 50 degrees, the δ550 is 25 µm, which is
a relatively small displacement. In addition to exhibiting such preservation of
linear-like form over broad angle, the paraxial approximation is a potent simplification device in theory and practice. For these reasons, it has enjoyed much
success and longevity in the clinic. However, its domain of validity is limited.
For instance, for θ0.2 > 75 degrees, the corresponding δ550 exceeds 0.5 mm and

increases rapidly and non-linearly with θ0.2 ; such that by θ0.2 = 78.84 degrees,
the δ550 has reached 5 mm, which is almost the entire radius of the cornea.
This is clearly non-paraxial territory over which the paraxial approximation is
invalid. Clinically, this zone is at the fringes of peripheral vision. Loss of vision
here is not likely to interfere significantly with daily life, and may even go unnoticed. However, such subtle peripheral vision loss is often the first sign of an
insidious optic neuropathy such as primary open angle glaucoma.
In the numerical experiments presented here, the scope of the photon trajectories studied are exclusively intra-corneal, with z ∈ [0.2, 550] µm. Based on
these purely intra-corneal photon trajectories, we have made inference involving the visual field. This is justified by a reasonable assumption of continuity.
We have assumed that there exists a correspondence between the intra-corneal
angle, θ, and the θ of the originating ray source in the visual field. In other
words, relatively wide angles in the field give rise to relatively wide angles within
the cornea, and relatively narrow angles in the field give rise to relatively narrow angles within the cornea. However, while we have relied on this angular
correspondence to make inference on field source, it is important to note that
what we have shown in this paper is that this correspondence is non-linear.
And more specifically, we have shown that wide intra-corneal angles give rise to
wider intra-corneal angles, while narrow intra-corneal angles remain relatively
constant.
Limitations of the current study include the assumption of gradient zero
in the meridional directions. Vasudevan et al showed naso-temporal gradients
in the human corneal epithelium [44]. Using a portable Abbé refractometer
mounted on a slit-lamp to make measurements on 10 human subjects, they

13

found corneal vertex, nasal, and temporal refractive indices of 1.397 (±0.001),
1.394 (±0.001), and 1.394 (±0.001) respectively. These gradients are significantly less than those found by Patel [31] in the axial direction, and hence were
assumed to be zero. The naso-temporal gradients were in the direction of the
corneal vertex, and their incorporation into the model can be expected to attenuate the concavity of the photon trajectory to some degree. However, the overall
non-linearity and angular-dependence behavior shown here will be unchanged.
A second limitation of the current work is the non-uniform specimen preparation and measurement method of the axial refractive index. The epithelial
refractive index was measured in-vivo using a modified hand-held refractometer, while the stroma was prepared as bare fresh cornea and measured in-vitro
using a bench-top Abbé refractometer [31]. A third limitation of the current
study is the sparsity of refractive index data points currently available to us in
the literature. This sparsity is due to the technological difficulty of making fine
high precision refractive index measurements in the human cornea. Most of this
challenging work has been done by Patel and by Vasudevan. Both Patel’s axial measurements and Vasudevan’s naso-temporal measurements contained only
three data points each, which points towards the challenging nature of the work.
Unfortunately, mathematical models based on such sparse data may be susceptible to the aliasing problem. For instance, in the current study we only had one
data point available for the refractive index gradient in the corneal epithelium.
However, the corneal epithelium is 55 µm thick on average with 5-7 cell layers
and contains histophysiological gradients. The cells are older, flatter, and closer
to apoptosis anteriorly than posteriorly The epithelium is bathed in the tear
film mucinous phase anteriorly and continuous with bowman’s layer posteriorly.
These histophysiological gradients suggest that the corneal epithelium contains
non-zero refractive index gradients. If a gradient does exists, its direction and
form beg investigation. More generally, finer sampling granularity of the refractive index is needed in the human cornea in each of the three principal axis
directions. In-spite of the above limitations, the current study has provided a
clear first demonstration of non-paraxial intra-corneal light-bending, and highlighted potential areas for further experimental and theoretical collaboration in
addressing the global disease burden of refractive error.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have provided the first quantitative demonstration of nonparaxial light-bending within the human cornea. We have also introduced the
Trajectron algorithm for computing photon trajectories in the human cornea.
And we have initiated steps towards describing the angular domain over which
the paraxial approximation is clinically applicable. These demonstrations have
significant implications in the development of refractive surgery algorithms.
