ABSTRACT

Superoxide reductases (SORs) are small metalloenzymes, which catalyze
reduction of O2.- to H2O2. The reaction of the enzyme from Treponema
pallidum with superoxide was studied by pulse radiolysis methods. The first
step is an extremely fast bi-molecular reaction of the ferrous center with O2.-,
with a rate constant of 6x108 M-1 s-1. A first intermediate is formed which is
converted to a second one with a slower rate constant of 4800 s-1. This latter
value is 10 times higher than the corresponding one previously reported in the
case of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii. The reconstituted spectra for the
two intermediates are consistent with formation of transient iron-peroxide
species.

INTRODUCTION

Superoxide radical (O2.-) is the univalent reduction product of molecular
oxygen. It belongs to the group of the so-called toxic oxygen derivatives,
which also include hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals [1]. For years the
only enzymatic system known to catalyze the elimination of superoxide was
the superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, which catalyzes dismutation of superoxide
radical anions to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen [2]. However, it
was recently discovered that biological elimination of O2.- could also occur by
reduction [3, 4], a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme thus named superoxide
reductase (SOR) :

SORs are small iron proteins (14 kDa) that contain an unusual mononuclear
iron center, consisting of a ferrous iron with square-pyramidal coordination to
four nitrogens from histidines as equatorial ligands and one sulfur from a
cysteine as the axial ligand, Fe(N-His)4(S-Cys) [5, 6]. This ferrous center is the
active site of the enzyme, as it reduces superoxide specifically and very
efficiently [3]. The SOR proteins found in some sulfate reducing bacteria, e.g.

3

Desulfoarculus baarsii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris contain an additional
mononuclear iron center, coordinated by four cysteines in a distorted
rubredoxin-type center [3, 5]. However, this iron center is not apparently
involved in the reaction and, up to now, its function remains unknown [3].
Very recently, the reactivity of SORs from Desulfoarculus baarsii [7] and
Desulfovibrio vulgaris [8] has been studied in great detail by site-directed
mutagenesis and pulse radiolysis studies. The data provided the evidence of
reaction intermediates, most likely iron-peroxide species, during the course for
the reduction of O2.- to H2O2, by the ferrous center.
Recently, we and others have characterized a new type of SOR from the
human pathogenic bacteria Treponema pallidum [9, 10]. Its primary sequence
is homologous to the SORs previously described, except that it is lacking three
of the four cysteines involved in the rubredoxin-like iron center. Consequently,
we showed that the protein from Treponema pallidum lacks this iron center and
contains only the mononuclear Fe(N-His)4(S-Cys) iron center. The fact that it
exhibits a full SOR activity confirms that the rubredoxin-like iron center is
apparently not involved in the reaction.
In this work, because of the presence of only one iron center which makes
the enzyme from T. pallidum more suitable for studying SOR reaction, we have
done pulse radiolysis studies on this protein. The results show significant
differences as far as the kinetics of the formation of the reaction intermediates

4

are concerned, with respect to the data recently reported for the SORs from D.
baarsii [7] and D. vulgaris [8].

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sodium formate and phosphate were of the highest quality available
(Prolabo Normatom or Merck Suprapure). Oxygen was delivered by ALPHA
GAZ. Its purity is higher than 99.99%. Water was purified using an Elga
Maxima system (resistivity 18.2 MΩ). The recombinant SOR from Treponema
pallidum protein was purified according to the procedure previously described
[9]. The ferricyanide oxidized purified protein exhibited a A280nm/A650nm ratio of
9.2. Protein concentration was determined using the value of the molar
extinction coefficient of 2300 M-1 cm-1 at 650 nm for the ferricyanide fully
oxidized protein. For the pulse radiolysis experiment, the concentration of the
reduced SOR was determined by subtraction of that of the oxidized protein in
the solution. The purified SOR was 15% oxidized, and remained stable in this
redox state for several hours, in the presence of air or oxygen (1 bar).
Pulse Radiolysis Experiments. Free radicals were generated by the
application into an aqueous solution of a 200 ns pulse of high energy electrons,
ca. 4 MeV from a linear accelerator located at the Curie Institute, Orsay France
[7]. The doses per pulse (2-15 Gy) were calibrated from the absorption of the

5

thiocyanate radical SCN•- obtained by radiolysis of thiocyanate ion solution in
N2O-saturated phosphate buffer ([SCN-] =10-2 M, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7,
G(SCN•-)= 0.55 µmol. J-1, 472 nm, = 7580 M-1 cm-1). Superoxide radicals
were generated during scavenging of radiolytically generated HO. free radicals
by 100 mM formate, in O2 saturated solution, as previously described [7]. This
radical is obtained in pure form in less than one microsecond. Samples to be
irradiated were made up in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mM sodium
formate, and saturated with pure O2. The doses per pulse were ca. 5 Gy ([O2.-]
≈ 3 µM). The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically between 350 and
750 nm, in a 2 cm path length cuvette designed for pulse radiolysis
experiments. Time-dependent absorbance differences were recorded on a
digital oscilloscope from two different experiments at two different time scales.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The SOR from T. pallidum, 60-130 µM in phosphate buffer pH 7.0, was
challenged by 3 µM superoxide, generated radiolytically. O2.- reacted very
rapidly with the iron center and all the absorbances between 350 and 700 nm
increased in the microsecond time scale. Fig. 1 shows a representative trace at
575 nm. All the traces between 350 and 700 nm reached a maximum ca. 40 µs
after the pulse (shown at 575 nm, Fig. 1). Then the absorbances slowly decayed

6

during ca. one millisecond, as shown in Fig. 2 for a representative trace at 550
nm, on the millisecond time scale (up to 1.5 ms). Finally, on a longer time
scale, traces at the different wavelengths revealed a further transformation of
the iron center to give the final product of the reaction, the ferric iron center
(data not shown). But, unfortunately, because of the lamp instability, the
kinetics of the reaction could not be further investigated after about 5-10 ms
reaction time.
Kinetics were analyzed at all the different wavelengths investigated
between 450 and 700 nm. At each wavelength, traces on the microsecond time
scale (up to 300 µsec, Fig. 1) could be described as the sum of two exponential
processes. The apparent rate constant for the first step of the reaction, resulting
in a maximum increase of the absorbance between 500 and 650 nm ca. 40 µsec
after the pulse, was proportional to protein (reduced form) concentration
between 60 and 130 µM (data not shown). The rate constant value, determined
from the slope of the straight line kapp versus [reduced protein] was found to be
6x108 M-1 s-1. The second exponential process could be followed at the
millisecond time scale to completion (Fig. 2) and was characterized by a rate
constant value of 4800 s-1, independent of protein concentration at all
wavelengths investigated (shown at 550 nm, Fig. 2).
Altogether, these results are consistent with a very fast bi-molecular
reaction of SOR with O2.- (k = 6x108 M-1 s-1), leading to the formation of a first

7

reaction intermediate whose concentration is maximum ca. 40 µs after the
beginning of the reaction. This intermediate then undergoes a transformation to
give a second reaction intermediate, which is fully formed 1 msec after the
pulse (Scheme 1). The spectra of these two intermediates could be
reconstructed from the absorbances at different wavelengths obtained after 40
µs and 1 ms reaction for the first and second intermediate, respectively (Fig. 3).
They display an absorption band at 610 and at 670 nm for the first and the
second intermediate, respectively. The molar extinction coefficient at these
wavelengths are almost identical (5000 M-1 cm-1), assuming that the reaction of
SOR with 3 µM of O2.- is quantitative.
The formation of two reaction intermediates with comparable spectra was
also observed in the case of the SOR from D. baarsii [7]. The first intermediate
was formed very rapidly with a rate constant of 1.1x10 9 M-1 s-1, which is close
to the value determined in the case of T. pallidum. On the contrary, the
reported rate constant for the formation of the second intermediate was about
10 times slower than in the case of T. pallidum (550 s-1 compared to 4800 s-1,
respectively).
In both proteins, the spectra of the intermediates are consistent with the
formation of iron-peroxide species (Scheme 1). As a matter of fact, several
models Fe-OOH compounds have been found to absorb visible light in the 500700 nm region [11]. We make the proposal that the first intermediate is an

8

iron(III)-peroxo species, resulting from the very fast binding of O2.- to the
solvent accessible coordination site of the reduced iron center [5, 6]. The
second intermediate may derive from a protonation process of this iron-peroxo
species to give an iron(III)-peroxide complex. Finally, the last part of the
reaction would correspond to a second protonation process which results in the
release of the reaction product H2O2. Interestingly, the three SOR proteins
characterized up to now at the level of reaction intermediates exhibit marked
differences in terms of the rate of formation of the second species [7, 8 and this
work]. As already mentioned, this rate is 10 times slower for D. baarsii as
compared to that for T. pallidum protein. In the case of the SOR from D.
vulgaris, the first intermediate was very rapidly generated (k = 1.5x109 M-1 s-1),
but then underwent a slow transformation (40 s-1) to give the reaction products,
with no evidence for a second intermediate [8]. The absence of a second
intermediate is puzzling, taking into account that the protein from D. vulgaris
is homologous to those from D. baarsii and T. pallidum [9]. One explanation
might be that the proton donors involved in the second step of the reaction
(Scheme 1) are different from one SOR to the other and/or exhibit different
pKa values. In the case of the SOR from D. vulgaris, the observed greater
stability of the first intermediate might result from a combined effect of a lower
pKa value for the proton donor than in the case of T. pallidum and D. baarsii
and a pH value slightly larger (pH 7.8) [8] than that used in our experiments

9

(pH 7.0, this work). Further studies are clearly required to characterize the
nature of the proton donor in the different SORs.
In conclusion, the SOR from Treponema pallidum, with only one iron
center, is here shown to proceed through reaction intermediates similar to those
observed with the D. baarsii and D. vulgaris SORs, containing two iron
centers. It thus represents an ideal model to study the mechanism of SORs
since the presence of the additional rubredoxin-like iron center make the D.
baarsii and D. vulgaris systems more complicated to study, in particular with
spectroscopic methods.
