Running head: RNA Repertoires of the Three Domains of Life

1

Abstract
The RNA world hypothesis, that RNA genomes and catalysts preceded DNA genomes
and genetically-encoded protein catalysts, has been central to models for the early
evolution of life on Earth. A key part of such models is continuity between the earliest
stages in the evolution of life and the RNA repertoires of extant lineages. Some
assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet direct continuity between
modern RNAs and an RNA world has not been demonstrated for the majority of RNA
families, and, anecdotally, many RNA functions appear restricted in their distribution.
Despite much discussion of the possible antiquity of RNA families, no systematic
analyses of RNA family distribution have been performed. To chart the broad
evolutionary history of known RNA families, we performed comparative genomic
analysis of over 3 million RNA annotations spanning 1446 families from the Rfam 10
database. We report that 99% of known RNA families are restricted to a single domain
of life, revealing discrete repertoires for each domain. For the 1% of RNA families/clans
present in more than one domain, over half show evidence of horizontal gene transfer,
and the rest show a vertical trace, indicating the presence of a complex protein
synthesis machinery in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) and consistent
with the evolutionary history of the most ancient protein-coding genes. However, with
limited interdomain transfer and few RNA families exhibiting demonstrable antiquity as
predicted under RNA world continuity, our results indicate that the majority of modern
cellular RNA repertoires have primarily evolved in a domain-specific manner.

Author Summary
In cells, DNA carries recipes for making proteins, and proteins perform chemical
reactions, including replication of DNA. This interdependency raises questions for early
evolution, since one molecule seemingly cannot exist without the other. A resolution to
this problem is the RNA world, where RNA is postulated to have been both genetic
material and primary catalyst. While artificially selected catalytic RNAs strengthen the
chemical plausibility of an RNA world, a biological prediction is that some RNAs should
date back to this period. In this study, we ask to what degree RNAs in extant organisms
trace back to the common ancestor of cellular life. Using the Rfam RNA families
database, we systematically screened genomes spanning the three domains of life
(Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya) for RNA genes, and examined how far back in evolution
known RNA families can be traced. We find that 99% of RNA families are restricted to a
single domain. Limited conservation within domains implies ongoing emergence of RNA
functions during evolution. Of the remaining 1%, half show evidence of horizontal
transfer (movement of genes between organisms), and half show an evolutionary
history consistent with an RNA world. The oldest RNAs are primarily associated with
protein synthesis and export.

Introduction
Following demonstration that RNA can act as genetic material [1-3] and
biological catalyst [4,5], the study of the origin and early evolution of life on Earth has
been heavily focused on the potential for an RNA world. The RNA world hypothesis is
that RNA was both genetic material and main biological catalyst, prior to the advent of
DNA and templated protein synthesis [6-8]. The chemical plausibility of an RNA world
has been intenstively investigated through the application of in vitro methodologies that
enable selection and subsequent characterization of novel RNA functionalities [9,10].
Equally, the discovery of naturally-occurring functional RNAs in biological systems has
expanded our understanding of the ways in which extant organisms utilize this
macromolecule in a wide range of contexts, including catalysis, regulation, and as
sequence-based guides [11-15].
A central tenet of RNA world theory as an account of the early evolution of life on
Earth is the Principle of Continuity [6], namely, that modern systems are the product of
gradual evolution from earlier states. Consequently, it is possible that some RNA
families could be direct descendents of molecules that first evolved in the RNA world
[16,17]. The broad functionality of RNA both in terms of catalysis and biological function
hints at a possibly complex RNA world [12,17,18], but assessing the antiquity of
individual RNA families has been hampered by limited comparative data, and difficulties
in annotating RNAs in genomes [19]. At the same time, it seems likely that many RNA
families significantly postdate the RNA world, having evolved de novo much later in the

4

evolution of life [13,20]. Indeed, for protein-coding genes, both very deep evolutionary
histories [21-23] and more recent origins [24,25] have been established.
Assigning relic status to individual RNAs is not without significant complication.
First, placing RNAs with non-universal distributions into the common ancestor of
archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes requires lineage or domain-specific losses to be
invoked [26]. While loss is plausible, it is difficult to verify at the level of cellular domains,
since recent origin versus lineage-specific loss following a more ancient origin cannot
be readily distinguished, and other data must be considered [27]. Another process that
may obfuscate the history of early RNA-based life is the propensity for genes to
undergo horizontal transmission, from a donor to a recipient. For protein-coding genes,
there is now overwhelming evidence that horizontal gene transfer is a significant
evolutionary force, particularly for microbes [28,29]. Consequently, gene-based
phylogenies do not always provide an accurate means of gauging the evolutionary
history of species, and, extrapolating across the tree of life and several billion years of
evolutionary history, it is plausible that no gene will have remained untouched by
horizontal gene transfer [30]. Consequently, historical signal consistent with RNA world
continuity may have been erased through subsequent gene transfer events.
Conversely, effective spread by horizontal transmission could lead to RNAs appearing
artificially ancient. Finally, many RNAs may be more recent evolutionary innovations,
and may not be RNA world relics [13].
These concerns notwithstanding, it remains commonplace for novel RNAs or
RNA families to be discussed in regard to their potential relevance to the RNA world.
Indeed, there are countless qualitative surveys derived from review of the experimental

5

literature (see for example [11,12,14,17,18,31]), which often extrapolate deep
evolutionary origins from limited comparative data. Problematically, this approach has
led to RNA world model being populated with RNAs whose distributions are patchy, and
antiquity has often been inferred on speculative grounds, following detailed
experimental characterisation of RNAs from a handful of model organisms. Against this
backdrop, it is perhaps of little surprise that more vociferous critics have dubbed this
endeavour the ‘RNA dreamtime’ [32].
While detailed studies have been performed for single RNA families (Table S1),
no published data present a systematic analysis covering all RNA families, despite this
now being routine for protein-coding genes. For RNA genes, an equivalent analysis is
long overdue but has not been possible because, until recently, comparative data were
not of sufficiently high quality.
We therefore sought to systematically address whether the phylogenetic
distribution of extant RNAs fits with direct descent from an RNA world, as predicted
under the Continuity hypothesis, or whether the distribution of extant RNAs better
reflects more recent (post-LUCA) origins. In addition, we sought to examine whether
horizontal transfer between cellular domains (and viruses) is detectable for RNA
families. We report an analysis of over 3 million RNAs spanning 1446 families in the
Rfam database [33], revealing that the overwhelming majority of families (99%) are
restricted to a single domain of life. By contrast, fewer than 1% show evidence of either
a deeper evolutionary origin, or of interdomain transfers. We conclude that, while, on
these proportions, the RNA world ‘palimpsest’ is only a fraction of the RNA repertoires
of modern genomes, the most ancient RNA families nevertheless belie evidence of an

6

advanced protein synthesis apparatus. Strikingly, we report that interdomain horizontal
gene transfers are also minimal for RNA genes, in marked contrast to the significant
levels detected for protein-coding genes. Our analyses thus serve to move the current
state-of-the-art from erudite literature review to systematic analysis of the distribution
and antiquity of large numbers of RNA families.

Results/Discussion
99% of RNA families are restricted to a single domain of life.
We first asked whether a systematic analysis of RNA families expands our knowledge
of ancient RNAs beyond those identified by traditional experimental work. To examine
the degree to which extant RNAs can be traced to earlier evolutionary periods, we
performed comparative analyses of annotated RNAs based on data from all three
domains of life as well as viruses. To this end, we used the Rfam (RNA families)
database [33], which groups RNAs into families, and families into clans, based on
manually-curated alignments, consensus secondary structures, covariance models [34]
and functional annotations. RNAs within families and clans can therefore be claimed to
share a common ancestry [33]. All analyses presented here are based on Rfam 10.0,
which consists of over 3 million annotations grouped into 1446 families and 99 clans
[33].
To generate a high-quality dataset, we first established the distribution of all
individual RNA sequence entries in Rfam by reference to the NCBI taxonomy database,
and manually vetted and removed probable false positive annotations. From the
resulting dataset, we generated an initial survey of families and clans across bacterial,
7

archaeal, eukaryotic and viral genomes (Fig. 1). Two patterns are immediately clear.
First, each domain carries a large number of entries absent from the other domains,
with limited overlap observed between domains, or with viruses. Second, only seven
Rfam families are present across all three domains. That we observe distinct domainlevel RNA repertoires appears consistent with the view that the three domains of life are
genetically distinct [35]. However, families present in more than one domain (or shared
with viruses) may be the result of either vertical evolution from a common ancestor or
horizontal transfer of genes between domains [29,35].

Interdomain RNA families show a mix of vertical and horizontal inheritance. We
next sought to establish whether the distribution the 12 interdomain Rfam families/clans
(Fig. 1) could be attributed either to vertical inheritance or horizontal gene transfer.
Previous studies and data on distribution allow a predominantly vertical pattern of
inheritance to be attributed to only five families (SSU and 5S rRNAs, tRNA, RNase P
RNA, SRP RNA) with four showing evidence of HGT (group I & II introns, organellar
LSU rRNA, IsrR RNA) (Table S1). Ribosomal RNAs are not fully represented in Rfam,
being amply covered by other databases (e.g. [36,37]), but their deep evolutionary
history has been readily traced (Table S1). Combined, these data confirm a minimal
reconstruction of the RNA repertoire of LUCA consistent with that observed for proteincoding genes [21], with the demonstrably oldest RNAs and the majority of such proteins
being involved in translation and protein export (Fig. 2). Consequently, while the
number of RNA families traceable to LUCA is an order of magnitude lower than for
proteins, the spread of functionalities is nevertheless very similar in extent.

8

A vertical trace is suspected but not demonstrated for the universally distributed
TPP riboswitch (Table S1, Fig. 3), which modulates gene expression in response to
thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). The analysis of patterns of inheritance for RNAs is
complicated by their short lengths and generally low levels of sequence conservation.
As riboswitches regulate cognate mRNA in cis, vertical transmission may be tested by
generating phylogenies from the protein products, on the assumption that the riboswitch
and ORF have coevolved. We therefore generated a phylogeny for THIC, the only TPPregulated gene product present in all three domains. The phylogeny shows eukaryote
sequences grouping with proteobacteria (Fig. S1), consistent with horizontal
transmission of TPP-riboswitch regulated ThiC to the eukaryote lineage from a bacterial
donor. Several independent observations are consistent with horizontal transmission:
Arabidopsis THIC is nuclear-encoded, but targets to the chloroplast [38], plant ThiC can
complement an E. coli ThiC mutant [39], and eukaryotic TPP riboswitches show limited
distribution [40] (Rfam 10.0). Moreover, THI1, which also carries a TPP riboswitch in its
mRNA leader, is also targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria [41]. While an early
origin for TPP riboswitches [11] remains plausible, this is difficult to reconcile with our
THIC phylogeny, since bacterial and archaeal sequences are not monophyletic under
any rooting (Fig. S1).
Also noteworthy is the CRISPR/Cas system, which combats viral and plasmid
infection in both bacteria and archaea. Horizontal transmission has been suggested for
this system, but interdomain transfer is thought to be limited [42]. Examination of
CRISPR crRNA family distribution reveals that 54 of 65 Rfam crRNA families are
restricted to a single domain (Table S2). The remaining 11 families fall into two clans

9

(CRISPR-1, CRISPR-2), which include crRNAs in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.
However, only one Rfam family from each of these two clans contains annotations
deriving from both domains. While short sequence length of crRNAs precludes
phylogenetic analyses, the distribution we report (Table S2) is compatible with sporadic
interdomain transfer, consistent with a phylogenomic analysis of Cas genes/clusters
which reported low levels of horizontal transmission [43].
The low number of observed interdomain RNA families suggests that, in contrast
to protein-coding gene repertoires, RNA repertoires are surprisingly refractory to
interdomain transfers. While we do see evidence of organellar contributions, these are
few in number, in marked contrast to the high numbers observed for protein-coding
genes [44,45].

Only a minority of domain-specific RNA families are broadly-distributed. We next
sought to establish the distribution of RNA families within each domain, since our initial
analysis (Fig. 1) does not consider within-domain taxonomic distribution of Rfam
families. A broad distribution may indicate an early origin of a given family, but
information on distribution alone cannot distinguish between horizontal and vertical
modes of transmission. As short length and limited sequence conservation preclude
robust phylogenies for the vast majority of RNA families, distribution cannot be used to
directly infer the RNA repertoire of the last common ancestor (LCA) of each domain.
Nevertheless, such information may indicate whether the RNA repertoires of the three
domains are functionally distinct. We therefore collated families present in at least 50%
of major within-domain taxonomic divisions (Fig. 3, Data S2). Surprisingly, the number

10

of broadly distributed families/clans within each domain is small (Archaea 13/69=18.8%,
Bacteria 15/223=6.7%, Eukaryotes 20/826=2.4%), though among eukaryotes there are
a high number of clans, which may encompass multiple RNA families with a shared
evolutionary history. Two patterns emerge from this analysis (Fig. 3). First, eukaryote
and archaeal repertoires are dominated by snoRNAs. Second, the most broadly
distributed bacterial RNAs are regulatory.
Closer investigation of the snoRNA repertoires across archaea and eukaryotes
reveals that C/D family RNAs are broadly distributed; H/ACA family RNAs, while
widespread among eukaryotes, are only known from Euryarchaeota [46,47], and
Archaeal H/ACA RNAs are not currently included in Rfam [33]. Strikingly, of the >500
snoRNA families included in this study, none are shared across archaea and
eukaryotes. While a deep origin of snoRNPs is supported by surveys of protein and
RNA components [48], this is not reflected by existence of conserved RNA families, for
which only scant evidence exists [49,50].
In eukaryotes, a strong domain-specific evolutionary trace is attributable to
snRNAs (Fig. 3, Table S3), consistent with other studies indicating both the major and
minor spliceosome were features of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) [5153].
A different picture emerges for miRNAs however. The broad distribution of
miRNAs is consistent with the suggestion that RNAi pathways trace to the LECA [54],
with 26/452 miRNA families present in more than one eukaryotic supergroup (Data S3).
However, closer inspection reveals most are singleton false positives or artefactual

11

family groupings. Our dataset therefore does not allow the placement of any individual
miRNA families in LECA.
A broad qualitative difference between bacteria compared to archaea and
eukaryotes is the preponderance of conserved regulatory elements, primarily
riboswitches (Fig. 3). However, this observation is based on only that small fraction of
Rfam families present in ≥50% of taxonomic divisions. To further assess whether there
are qualitative differences between the functional RNA repertoires across the three
domains and viruses, we took advantage of the organization of Rfam into different
functionalities. As is evident from Fig. 4, common functionalities across all three
domains are sparse. Riboswitches and ribozymes indicate the ubiquity of small
metabolite-based regulation and catalytic function, but of the numerous families
included in this analysis, only RNase P RNA is directly traceable to the LUCA (Figs. 2 &
3). Functionalities shared between archaea and eukaryotes to the exclusion of bacteria
are restricted to snoRNA-dependent RNA modification, and CRISPRs are the only
prokaryote-specific functionality. Interestingly, a number of RNA functionalities present
in bacteria lack archaeal or eukaryotic representatives (cis-regulatory leaders,
thermoregulators, sRNAs), and Rfam contains no archaeal-specific functionalities (Fig.
4, Data S4), possibly attributable to the smaller number of experimental screens for
novel RNAs across members of this domain.

Biases in taxonomic sampling. In comparing the RNA repertoires of the three
domains, a key question is whether the underlying Rfam data cover a reasonable
spread of species within each domain, or whether data from a few species or phyla

12

dominate. This is important in that the low number of broadly distributed families/clans
we observe within each domain could be the result of an underlying sampling bias. A
priori we may expect a significant bias, given current genomic coverage of microbial
biodiversity. For instance, a recent survey of snoRNAs indicates there is broad, though
nevertheless patchy coverage across major eukaryotic and archaeal groups [48]. We
therefore examined the underlying taxonomic distribution of all domain-specific Rfams.
For all three domains, entries are heavily skewed, with a majority of Rfam annotations
deriving from a narrow phylogenetic diversity (Fig. S2).
For protein-coding genes, discovery of novel proteins has been significantly
enhanced by sequencing of genomes chosen for maximal phylogenetic diversity [55].
While de novo computational discovery of novel ncRNAs is non-trivial by comparison,
we were nevertheless interested in establishing whether the additional phylogenetic
coverage provided by the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea (GEBA) [55]
impacted the number of broadly distributed Rfam families. Under the assumption of
vertical inheritance, we therefore treated RNAs as characters on the GEBA phylogeny.
Our analysis yielded four additional bacterial candidates (marked with asterisks in Fig.
3), though again we caution that broad distribution may be generated through HGT, so
these candidates cannot be placed in the bacterial ancestor. Nevertheless, this modest
improvement suggests GEBA [55], and targeted experimental screens informed by
phylogeny [48] will provide a valuable framework, both for improving knowledge of RNA
family distribution and in focusing experimental screens for novel RNA families.
How should we interpret these data? The limited distribution of domain-specific
RNAs is likely to be biased by sampling, a problem that affects all genomic data, and is

13

even more acute for detailed experimental data. On available data, we find that only a
minority of domain-specific RNAs exhibit a broad distribution. A broad distribution could
result from vertical inheritance, but it could also be the result of horizontal gene transfer.
Taxonomic biases might underestimate the number of RNAs vertically traceable to the
ancestor of a domain, whereas horizontal gene transfer might be expected to expand
the distribution of some RNAs. Assuming that current sampling has gaps, but is not
completely uninformative [48], available data suggest that a high proportion of RNAs are
likely to be evolutionarily young, and will not trace to the LCA of the domain in which
they reside.

Concluding remarks. We have examined the evolution and diversity of RNAs across
the entire tree of life, an important complement to previous comparative studies on RNA
metabolism [11,17] and RNA-associated protein families [56]. Large-scale analyses of
the RNA repertoire are only now becoming possible through improved methodologies
for RNA identification and greater integration between RNA discovery and online
databases.
It is commonplace for novel RNAs or RNA families to be discussed in regard to
their potential relevance to the RNA world, yet RNAs with limited distribution are difficult
to reconcile with a very ancient evolutionary origin unless massive losses are invoked.
Excepting the possibility of losses (which cannot be readily tested since the evidence for
antiquity has been erased), our study shows that direct evidence for the RNA continuity
hypothesis remains scant; there is undoubtedly an RNA ‘palimpsest’ [16], but it is not
possible to expand this through systematic comparative analyses.

14

Conversely, we find clear evidence of distinct domain-level repertoires, but
limited evidence of inter-domain transfers, consistent with a recent analysis indicating a
detectable vertical trace amidst ongoing HGT [29]. The paucity of shared eukaryotic and
archaeal RNA regulatory processes (Fig. 4) and the marginal bacterial contribution to
the eukaryote RNA repertoire, support the view that eukaryotic mechanisms of RNA
regulation are a domain-specific invention [15], and extend this view to the other two
domains. While we see qualitative similarities between archaea and eukaryotes (Figs. 3
& 4), in agreement with studies indicating a phylogenetic affinity between these two
domains [57], these are currently restricted to snoRNAs. The clear differences in RNA
functional repertoires between eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria (Fig. 4) strengthen the
case for recognizing the biological distinctness of the three domains [35], independent
of uncertainty surrounding their specific phylogenetic relationships [58].

Materials and Methods
Rfam dataset. Annotated noncoding RNA data used in this study was derived from
data curated in Release 10.0 of the Rfam database [33] (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/). The
distribution of Rfam families (Data S1) was established in two steps. First, for a given
family, all annotations across the EMBL database [59] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/) were
binned into domains using the taxonomic information attached to each sequence. We
then inspected annotations from families whose distribution spanned more than one
domain to identify possible false annotations. For all Rfam families with annotations
spanning two or more domains (including viruses) we first confirmed the taxonomic
affiliation of each sequence through reciprocal blasts against the GenBank database
15

and removed any cases where sequences were clearly misannotated (e.g. bacterial
sequencing vectors in eukaryote genome projects). Next, we inspected the quality of
each annotation with reference to Rfam seed alignments. Any sequences with a
bitscore within +10 bits of the individual bitscore cutoffs for curated seed alignments,
and where sequence similarity was deemed insufficient to reliably establish homology,
were discarded.

Higher-level taxonomic assignments. In assigning Rfam entries to specific taxonomic
groups of bacteria and archaea (Figure 3, Data S1), we used the top-level
classifications within each domain in the NCBI Taxonomy Database. At the time the
analyses were performed, the proposed archaeal phylum Thaumarchaeota [60] was not
recognised in the database, and available sequences were classified as Crenarchaeota.
While members of the Thaumarchaeota are present in our data, none carry annotated
snoRNAs, so not explicitly recognizing putative Thaumarchaeotes as a phylum does not
impact the results summarized in figure 2. For Eukaryote RNA sequences, data was
grouped according to the classification scheme proposed by Adl and colleagues [61].

Phylogenetic analyses. All sequences annotated as THIC in Genbank were retrieved
(8 Feb 2011). The resulting list of 4508 sequences were examined for sequence
similarity by generating a blast network using the blastall program from the BLAST
package (version 2.2.18), with an E-value cutoff of 0.1. The network of blast results was
visualized with CLANS [62], using default settings. The output was then clustered using
16

MCL [63], with granularity set at 4. Representative sequences spanning all domains
were retrieved from all MCL clusters with >10 members. Sequences were aligned using
MSA-Probs [64]. Partial sequences and extremely divergent sequences where
annotation appeared questionable were removed. Conserved regions were selected for
use in phylogenetic analysis via the G-blocks server [65]
(http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html), with the settings ‘Allow
smaller final blocks’ and ‘Allow gap positions within the final blocks’ selected. ProtTest
[66] was used to identify the best-fit model of protein evolution for our alignment.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyML 3.0 [67] with parameters and model
(WAG+I+G) as selected using ProtTest. Bootstrapping was performed on two Mac Pro
machines with Intel Xeon Quad core processors, running 12 parallel threads.
Parallelization yielded a total of 108 bootstrap replicates (a consequence of running 12
threads in parallel, resulting in bootstrap replicates that were a multiple of 12); all
bootstrap values in figure S1 are therefore out of a total of 108 not 100. Additional trees
were generated using RAxML [68] and BioNJ [69] to assess robustness of the topology.
Tree figures were generated in Dendroscope [70].

Figure Legends
Fig. 1. Venn diagram of RNA family distribution. Taxonomic information attached to
EMBL-derived Rfam annotations reveals that the majority (99%) of RNA families are
domain-specific, with only seven RNA families universally conserved (across the three
domains of life plus viruses; Table S1). Numbers within dashed circles indicate viral
RNA families.

Fig. 2. RNA-based processes traceable to the Last Universal Common Ancestor.
Universal Rfam families that show evidence of vertical inheritance (Table S1) are all
associated with the processes of translation (rRNAs, tRNAs, RNase P) and protein
export (SRP RNA). A previous study examining the antiquity of protein coding genes
[21] identified only 37 universally distributed proteins which show evidence of vertical
inheritance. The majority of these vertically inherited proteins are associated with
translation and protein export; numbers of such proteins associated with each of the
depicted processes is given in grey (original data are from Harris [21]). The proteins
associated with RNase P are not universally conserved, with archaeal and eukaryotic
RNase P proteins being unrelated to their bacterial counterparts [71]. While tRNA
synthetases are universal, they have undergone ancient horizontal gene transfer events
[72], which complicates establishing the timing of their origin.

plus interdomain RNA families. Colored bars at far right indicate normalized
taxonomic abundance of each Rfam for major taxonomic groupings within each domain.

Horizontal traces (see text, Table S1) for interdomain families, are depicted as follows:
general transfer patterns are given by dashed arrows; proposed HGT patterns for
individual families are depicted by number (inset). For Rfam families present in more
than one domain (far left and inset), bars indicate normalized taxonomic abundance by
domain (color scheme at bottom left). Asterisks indicate additional broadly-distributed
bacterial candidates identified using GEBA tree topology [55] (see text). Note that the
Rfam rRNA families in Rfam 10.0 are based on conserved subsequences, and are not
as comprehensive as other resources (see main text) and are included here for
consistency. The universally-distributed rRNAs are the small subunit (16/18S) rRNA,
large subunit (23/28S) rRNA and 5S rRNA (see Table S1). The 5.8S rRNA of
eukaryotes is known to be homologous to the 5' end of bacterial and archaeal 23S
rRNA [73,74], so its inclusion as a eukaryote-specific family in Rfam is in this respect
artefactual.

Numbers of sequences and families in Rfam 10 that fall into each functional

snoRNA families [48] and more generally for genome projects [55].

Figure S3. Discovery curves for Rfam.
These curves plot the oldest reliable electronic date (EMBL entry or publication)
associated with a particular Rfam family. Domain distribution (1-domain, 2-domain or 325

domain) is based on current distributions. To generate discovery curves for all RNA
families in Rfam 10.0 (which includes families built before January 2010), we extracted
the oldest dates from the literature references contained in the corresponding
Stockholm file and from the EMBL accessions – the oldest date of the two is plotted.

Supporting Information
Justification for the use of Rfam data for comparative analyses.
There are several issues that must be considered for any analysis that requires homology
inference. As a large scale comparative analysis of RNA families has not, to our
knowledge, been performed before, it is important to begin such an analysis with a
discussion of the merits — and possible limitations — of analyzing such a dataset across
deep evolutionary history.
For both proteins and RNA, structure is often better conserved than sequence,
such that homology may not be detectable from sequence data alone [1,2]. In Rfam,
families are based on covariance models (CMs), which contain both primary sequence
and secondary structure information [3,4], thus enabling detection of homology well
below the twilight zone of sequence similarity for nucleic acids [2]. Evolutionary
relationships for RNA genes from distant taxa have been reported (Table S1), and such
distant similarities can be detected using Rfam [3] (Hoeppner & Poole, submitted),
suggesting detection of homology is possible with a range of methods, even for distantly
related RNAs.
Major classification schemes for protein families are based on measures of
sequence similarity [5,6], which may fracture protein families classified from structure,
where significant sequence similarity is undetectable (e.g. ribonucleotide reductases —
[7]). If homology is routinely missed for deeply conserved RNAs, biologicallycharacterisable families should be artificially fractured. Examination of Rfam revealed
few obvious cases, with those that we could identify being resolved at the clan level [3]
(Hoeppner & Poole, submitted). In Rfam 10.0, 20% of families are further grouped into
clans, and clan generation is achieved via implementation of a modified version of PRC
[8], optimized for RNA profile:profile comparisions [3]. This permits detection of very
distant relationships, based on both sequence and secondary structure similarity across
multiple Rfam families. While no homology detection method can be claimed to be
exhaustive, we believe Rfam is, in methodological terms, comparable to best practice in
delineation of protein families by profile:profile comparisons [6,9,10]. For both types of
data (RNA and protein), homology inference (i.e. defining families as a collection of
sequences with a shared common ancestor) is made based on a measure of similarity.

2

There are known issues with existing sequence databases and datasets, where
distinguishing between different forms of homology may be non-trivial, and is often not
explicitly established [11,12]. As with protein families, Rfam families may therefore
contain a mixture of orthologs (genes related by common descent following speciation),
paralogs (genes related by common descent following gene duplication) and xenologs
(genes related by common descent following horizontal gene transfer). For xenologs, this
will not obviously affect the number of Rfam families, only their distribution. As
discussed below, since this study focuses only on interdomain comparisons, we explicity
examine xenologs at the level of interdomain comparisons, but not within domains.
Within-domain xenology may impact the number of broadly-distributed RNAs. More
generally, at the level of resolution used here (comparison across the three domains of
life), failure to distinguish between orthologs and paralogs may at most alter the number
of families attributed to each domain. Cases where paralogs are counted as separate
families would artificially increase the number of within-domain families, and cases
where functionally divergent paralogs are grouped within the same family would reduce
this number. Mitigating against this, Rfam families and clans are based on a combination
of sequence and structural similarity, plus common functionality [3], and inspection of
clans indicates these represent orthologous groups rather than groupings of larger
families with multiple paralogous constituents (personal observations). We think it is
reasonable to conclude that the RNAs that make up individual Rfam families and clans
can be considered to be homologous, and duly note that the caveats described here
regarding orthology and paralogy apply equally to large protein-based datasets [12]. We
can identify no sources of error that are demonstrably associated only with RNA data.
For these reasons, we conclude that Rfam data is amenable to global comparative
analyses.
Rates of interdomain RNA family discovery.
Given the currently rapid rate of discovery of novel RNAs, the Rfam database may not
carry an up-to-the-minute picture of all known RNA families. The analysis we present is
therefore necessarily a snapshot of current knowledge at the time of the Rfam release on
which it is based, and will no doubt evolve as new RNA families are discovered. For the
3

current study it is important to establish the rate of discovery of interdomain RNAs
relative to intradomain RNAs. We therefore plotted discovery curves for all of Rfam
(Figure S3). As is clear from Figure S3, the discovery rate of interdomain RNAs
flattened off some time ago, whereas even in a conservative database like Rfam, domainspecific RNAs are still being added at a significant rate. There is no indication that
interdomain RNAs lag far behind in terms of discovery. As is clear from Figure S3 and
Table S4, some newer cases even show a shortening of discovery times, perhaps because
it is easier to screen for these in the post-genomic environment (e.g. [13]). We suspect
that, as new data are published (as discussed in e.g. [14]), single-domain RNA families
will continue to massively outpace discovery of new interdomain RNAs.
Universally-distributed RNA families.
Two families/clans show a universal distribution (present in all three domains plus
viruses). For group II self-splicing introns, it is well established that these RNA elements
are horizontally transmitted, with good evidence for recent transfer events from bacteria
to archaea [15,16], and to eukaryotes via organelles [17]. By contrast, tRNAs, which are
also universal, have been proposed to show a vertical evolutionary trace [18], and their
involvement in viral replication has been argued to indicate an early evolutionary origin
[19]. While individual tRNAs may have polyphyletic origins [20,21], placing presence of
this family of RNAs in the ancestor of all three domains (Figure 2) is not controversial.

RNA families present in all three domains.
Five RNA families/clans are present in all three domains, and four of the five have been
previously argued to show a vertical trace (Table S1). Rfam does not include full models
for the large and small subunit ribosomal RNA, though RF00177 covers the 5' domain of
the SSU rRNA. The only surprise member of this list is the TPP riboswitch. A difficulty
with directly examining the evolutionary history of specific RNA elements in detail is
that elements tend to be short, precluding reliable phylogenetic analysis in many cases.
To abrogate this problem, we generated protein sequence phylogenies (Materials and
Methods) derived from the most broadly distributed TPP-regulated gene, ThiC. With in
4

excess of 4500 THIC sequences in genbank, we used MCL [22] to generate a broad
overview of the data and selected representative sequences from each of the major MCL
clusters for phylogenetic analysis (see Materials and Methods). Next, we performed
phylogenetic analyses on a subset of this data, with sequence selection guided by the
network of clusters (Materials and Methods). As is clear from Figure S1, we do not
recover the monophyly of the three domains, with proteobacteria and archaea both split
into distinct groups, which cannot be attributed to phylogenetic artefact. It therefore
seems likely that the non-monophyly of both archaeal and bacterial ThiC sequences is
best attributed to horizontal transmission events. Eukaryotes, in contrast, do form a single
clan (sensu [23]). While the tree in Figure S1 is unrooted, vertical descent of the
eukaryote sequences from the Last Universal Common Ancestor is difficult to reconcile
with the non-monophyly among the other two domains. This would require the position
of the root to be between eukaryotes and bacteria/archaea. Given that the eukaryote
sequences group with proteobacterial sequences, are relatively restricted in distribution,
and surrounded by neighbouring bacterial clans, it seems more plausible that eukaryote
ThiC sequences have entered this domain via horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial
source during the evolution of the Archaeplastida.
Interdomain RNA families.
After vetting for false annotations, we recovered five additional families/clans with
members present in more than one domain (Table S1). Evidence of horizontal
transmission can be established for all five cases. Table S2 shows that the distribution of
CRISPR crRNA Rfam families is largely domain-specific, suggesting ongoing
interdomain transfer is minimal. 53 of 65 families we analyzed are present in only a
single domain. One family (RF01353) contains both archaeal and bacterial sequences but
closer inspection reveals it to be archaeal-specific; this family carries only a single
bacterial annotation, in Cyanothece sp. CCY0110, based on a single non-repeated, nonCas associated region, making this almost certainly a false annotation. As noted in the
main text, only two families show interdomain distribution, indicating at most limited
interdomain transfer of crRNAs.

5

As per group II introns above, the horizontal transmission of group I self-splicing
introns is well-documented (Table S1; [24]). The LSU rRNA pseudoknot is present in
23S rRNA from bacteria and eukaryotic organellar 23S rRNA; the latter entered
eukaryotes via bacterial endosymbioses, as judged by representative 23S rRNA
phylogenies, and congruence with 16S rRNA phylogenies [25]. All eukaryotic group II
intron and 23S rRNA sequences annotated in the EMBL database were examined to
establish their genomic location; in all cases, we find these are in organellar (chloroplast
and mitochondrial) genomes. Finally, the IsrR iron stress repressed RNA is associated
with photosystem I in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [26], and
annotated eukaryote sequences in the EMBL database are all chloroplast-encoded,
strongly linking this element to the endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplast.

Displayed are the oldest dates from the literature references (PUB DATE) contained in the corresponding
Stockholm file and from the EMBL accessions. Some of these RNAs were discovered experimentally prior
to the dates associated with the deposited sequences, meaning the age of many of the oldest RNAs is in fact
underestimated. Consequently, the discovery dates summarized in Fig. S3 are estimates that can only be
used in the context of broad discovery trends.

Abbreviations: present in eukaryotes & bacteria (E-B); present in archaea & bacteria (A-B); present in
archaea, bacteria & eukaryotic domains (LUCA).

Figure S1. Unrooted PhyML phylogeny of TPP-regulated gene product THIC.
(A) Tree in landscape format so labels are legible. The phylogeny shows good support for
a close affinity between Plant and green algal (green) and a clan of proteobacterial
homologs (red), to the exclusion of archaeal sequences (dark blue), consistent with
possible HGT from bacteria to eukaryotes. Monophyletic groups are not recovered for
either archaea or bacteria, suggestive of horizontal transmission events. All tips are
labeled with the following information: MCL_cluster|Domain|gi_number|species_name.
Bootstrap values are out of 108 (Materials and Methods). (B) Same tree in unrooted
form; coloring is identical to key in (A).
Figure S2. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of Rfam entries within the EMBL
nucleotide database.
Data for each of the three domains (A) Eukarya (B) Archaea (C) Bacteria are binned by
indicated major taxonomic groupings (see Materials and Methods). The x-axis
corresponds to individual Rfam entries. The majority of families are restricted to wellstudied groups, revealing a strong bias in the underlying data, as previously seen for
snoRNA families [40] and more generally for genome projects [41].
Figure S3. Discovery curves for Rfam.
These curves plot the oldest reliable electronic date (EMBL entry or publication)
associated with a particular Rfam family. Domain distribution (1-domain, 2-domain or 3domain) is based on current distributions. To generate discovery curves for all RNA
families in Rfam 10.0 (which includes families built before January 2010), we extracted
the oldest dates from the literature references contained in the corresponding Stockholm
file and from the EMBL accessions – the oldest date of the two is plotted.
