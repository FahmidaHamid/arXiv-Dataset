Abstract
Quantifying the attack ratio of disease is key to epidemiological inference and Public Health planning.
For multi-serotype pathogens, however, different levels of serotype-specific immunity make it difficult
to assess the population at risk. In this paper we propose a Bayesian method for estimation of the
attack ratio of an epidemic and the initial fraction of susceptibles using aggregated incidence data. We
derive the probability distribution of the effective reproductive number, Rt , and use MCMC to obtain
posterior distributions of the parameters of a single-strain SIR transmission model with time-varying
force of infection. Our method is showcased in a data set consisting of 18 years of dengue incidence in the
city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn about the initial fraction of
susceptibles and the attack ratio even in the absence of serotype specific data. On the other hand, the
information provided by this approach is limited, stressing the need for detailed serological surveys to
characterise the distribution of serotype-specific immunity in the population.

Introduction
Dengue is an arthropod-borne febrile disease caused by a flavivirus with four serotypes which causes
an estimated 50 million infections each year [1]. In humans, immunity against a particular serotype is
considered permanent after the exposure and cross immunity to there serotypes is considered short lived [2].
As a consequence, the proportions of viral serotypes co-circulating at any point in time are strongly
dependent on previous incidence patterns of the disease, which determine the number of individuals
susceptible to each serotype at any point in time.
Dengue transmission is also modulated by environmental conditions, among which, temperature, due
to its effects on the vector reproduction, stands out as a strong predictor of incidence [3, 4]. In places
with sufficient seasonal temperature variation, dengue is predominantly a summer disease. So it is fair to
say that these environmental fluctuations play a key role in determining beginning and end of epidemic
periods. This climatic influence is exerted mainly through its effects on the force of infection, which
cannot be taken as constant [5] but rather as a seasonal (oscillating) function of time. The long term
dynamics of dengue is also modulated by the alternation of virus types in circulation. Demographics also
plays a role in replenishing the population of susceptibles.
The attack ratio (AR) of a disease is a measure of morbidity defined as the number of new cases
divided by the population at risk. For dengue epidemics, it can be difficult to calculate the AR due to
the lack of knowledge of the population at risk. The population at risk in this case is the number of
susceptibles to the circulating virus type(s) before a given epidemic. Thus, in order to calculate the attack
ratio, we need to determine the number of susceptibles to the circulating virus types right before the
epidemic, which is virtually impossible without regular virological surveys.
The attack ratio is also influenced by the reproductive number of the disease [6, 7], which is closely
associated with the force of infection. Thus the incorporation of the effective reproduction number, Rt ,

2

as a function of time, is crucial to an accurate estimation of the AR of seasonal diseases like dengue and
Influenza.
Other methods for estimating the number of susceptibles while accommodating time-varying force
of infection have been proposed before, for measles [8, 9], a disease that shows remarkable seasonality.
These methods try to reconstruct the entire series of infectious and susceptibles from case data using
deterministic models and generally work well for measles because there is a one-to-one relationship between
exposure and immunity, since measles is caused by a single-strain pathogen. Recently, methods in the
same fashion were developed for dengue when serotype-specific data is available [10]. When such data
is not available, the series of susceptibles to all possible serotypes, cannot be reconstructed based solely
on a deterministic transmission model, since the arrival/re-emergence of new serotypes, an intrinsically
stochastic events, can drastically change the pool of susceptibles, throwing off any sequential estimation
based on the incidence dynamics.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate the number (fraction) of susceptibles using a
simplified model of dengue transmission based on a single-strain Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR)
model with time-varying infection rate. In order to bypass the limitations of not knowing the serotypespecific seroprevalence and the exact behaviour of the force of infection through time, we propose to inform
the time-varying transmissibility using the Rt series derived from the notification data [11]. We extend
a Bayesian framework previously used to estimate the number of susceptibles in Influenza epidemics
in Europe [12] to include time-varying force of infection and derive a probability distribution for Rt to
accommodate uncertainty in the estimates. Then, from the incidence series and the population at risk, we
calculate the attack ratio for each epidemic. We apply our method to estimate S0 before every major
dengue epidemic in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the last 18 years.

Methods
In this section we will start by describing the data and then the method used to estimate the effective
reproductive number, Rt , from the data and obtain its posterior distribution. We then proceed to describe
the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model used to represent the aggregated disease incidence and
how Rt can be integrated into the model to allow for time varying force of infection. Next, an approach
to approximate the posterior distributions of the numbers of susceptible to the main circulating dengue
viruses for each epidemic is detailed. Finally, we discuss how to estimate the attack ratio of each epidemic
using the estimated susceptible fraction and the observed incidence.

Data
The data used in this paper consists of time series of weekly notified cases of dengue for the city of
Rio de Janeiro from 1996 to 2014. The cases are notified based only on clinical criteria. Laboratory
confirmation and serotype information are available only for a very small sample and only on recent years
(2010-2013). For the parameter estimation procedures incidence was normalized by dividing the number of
cases reported by the total city population at each year as given by the census (Census Bureau, Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics, http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/).

Estimating the effective reproductive number (Rt )
In monitoring of infectious diseases, it is important to assess whether the incidence of a particular
disease is increasing significantly, in order to decide to take preventive measures. The effective reproductive
number at time t, Rt , can be understood as a real-time estimate of the basic reproductive number (R0 )
and is defined as the average number of secondary cases per primary case at time t.

3

Let Yt be the number of reported disease cases for a particular time t ∈ (0, T ). Nishiura el al. (2010) [11]
extend the theory developed by Stallybrass et al. (1931) [13] and propose to estimate Rt as

1/n
Yt+1
Rt =
(1)
Yt
where n is taken to be the ratio between the length of reporting interval and the mean generation time
of the disease. Here we are interested in the simpler case n = 1. If Rt is to be used as a decision tool,
however, one needs to be able to quantify the uncertainty about estimate in equation 1. Here we detail
how to obtain credibility intervals for Rt under the assumption that the counts Yt are Poisson distributed
for all t.
We explore the approach of Ederer and Mantel [14], whose objective is to obtain confidence intervals for
the ratio of two Poisson counts. Let Yt ∼ P oisson(λt ) and Yt+1 ∼ P oisson(λt+1 ) and define S = Yt +Yt+1 .
The authors note that by conditioning on the sum S
Yt+1 |S ∼ Binomial(S, θt )

θt =

Let cα (θt ) = {θt , θt } be such that P r(θt < θt < θt ) = α. Analogously, define cα (Rt ) =
(L)
(U )
(L)
(U )
{Rt , Rt } such that P r(Rt < Rt < Rt ) = α. Ederer and Mantel (1974) [14] show that one can
construct a 100α% confidence interval for Rt by noting that

and Rt

Because the transform from θ to Rt is monotonically increasing, the result holds for confidence and
credibility intervals alike.
Many authors have chosen to quantify the uncertainty about θ following orthodox approaches (see for
example [15] and [16]) mainly for simplicity. We choose instead to take a Bayesian approach and use the
100α% posterior credibility interval for θt as cα (θt ). If we choose the conjugate beta prior with parameters
a0 and b0 for the binomial likelihood in (2), the posterior distribution for θt is
p(θt |Yt+1 , S) ∼ Beta(Yt+1 + a0 , Yt + b0 )

(5)

Combining equations (4) and (5) tells us that the induced posterior distribution of Rt is a beta prime
(or inverted beta) with parameters a1 = Yt+1 + a0 and b1 = Yt + b0 [17]. The density of the induced
distribution is then
Γ(a1 + b1 ) a1 −1
fP (Rt |a1 , b1 ) =
R
(1 + Rt )−(a1 +b1 )
(6)
Γ(a1 )Γ(b1 ) t

Thus, the expectation of Rt is a1 /(b1 − 1) and its variance is a1 (a1 + b1 − 1)/ (b1 − 2)(b1 − 1)2 . Note
that this result holds only for n = 1. Sampling from the posterior in (6) can be made straightforward by
first sampling from (5) and then applying the transform in (4). Also, one can choose a0 and b0 so as to
elicit meaningful prior distributions for Rt . We show how to elicit the prior for Rt from specified prior
mean and variance or coefficient of variation in the Appendix.
Also, since Rt > 1 indicates sustained transmission, one may be interested in computing the probability
of this event. This can be easily achieved by integrating (6) over the appropriate interval. By noting that

P r(Rt > 1) = 1 −

one can compute the desired probability while avoiding dealing with the density in (6) directly.

Mathematical modelling
A Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model is proposed to model dengue dynamics. In the
traditional formulation of the model, transmission is governed by a constant transmission rate β and
recovery happens at a rate τ .
For our analysis we chose to let the force of infection vary with time, just as it does in the actual
epidemics, as seen in the data. So as the epidemic progresses, the effective transmission rate changes and
is given by
Rt · τ
β(t) =
(9)
S0
where Rt is the effective reproductive number, estimated as in 1. The complete model with the time-varying
force of infection is given by the system of ordinary differential equations:
dS
= −β(t)SI
dt
dI
= β(t)SI − τ I
dt
dR
= τI
dt

(10)

where S + I + R = 1 ∀ t. Of course, this is a rather simplified model, in which, for instance, the vector
is omitted. The rationale for this simplification is based on the ability of the empirically derived Rt to
incorporate the effects of the fluctuating vector populations. Also, although there are multiple circulating
serotypes, our approach can not discriminate between them due to the lack of serotype-specific data.
Nevertheless, this modelling strategy can still provide some insight into the disease dynamics and allows
us to estimate the initial fraction of susceptibles S0 , a key epidemiological parameter.

Bayesian parameter estimation
We take a Bayesian approach to the estimation of S0 . First the incidence time series was divided into
J = 13 epidemic windows that corresponded to significant raises in incidence and normalized to lie on the
[0, 1] interval. For a given interval j = {tstart
, tend
j
j } we observe an incidence time series Yj . We are thus
interested in the posterior distribution
p(S0j |Yj ) ∝ l(Yj |S0j , Rt , m, τ )π(S0j )

(11)

The likelihood l(Yj |·) is assumed to be a Normal distribution with fixed variance σ 2 . In this estimation
procedure we kept Rt fixed at fixed at the posterior mean obtained as described above and fixed
τ = 1/7 days−1 . To complete the inference, we need to specify prior distributions for the parameters of
interest. We place a flat Beta(1, 1) prior on S0j ∀j
To approximate the posterior in (11) we use Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques implemented in the
Bayesian inference with Python (BIP) [12] available at http://code.google.com/p/bayesian-inference/.
BIP uses a Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) [18] scheme that efficiently samples
from high-dimensional joint distributions using multiple adaptive chains running in parallel with delayed
rejection. Also, as the numerical integration routine implemented within BIP needs β(t) to be available at
arbitrary values of t, i.e., as continuous function of time because of the variable step size, we used linear
interpolation to obtain values of Rt for any time point. In this study we used one chain per parameter, i.e,
3 chains for each run. The chains were run until 5000 samples were obtained after discarding 500 burn-in
samples. Convergence of the parallel chains was verified at every 100 iterations by the calculation of the
Gelman-Rubin’s R (potential scale reduction factor), which approaches 1 at convergence [19].

Calculating the attack ratio
The attack ratio of an epidemic is defined by the number of infections divided by the size of the
population at risk.
A=

# cases
Population at risk

Based on what has been discussed so far, we can rewrite (12) for each epidemic j as
P
Yj
Aj =
S0j

(12)

(13)

where S0j is the number of susceptibles before each epidemic j, which we estimated before.
Python and R code to perform all the analyses described above is publicly available at https:

Results and Discussion
In this paper we propose a method to bypass the lack of serotype-specific case data by informing the
time-varying force of infection with the instantaneous reproductive number, Rt which we calculate from
aggregated data. The main contribution of this paper can be summarized in the following items: (i) we
show a method to quantify uncertainty about Rt that is readily applicable to other diseases and; (ii) we
propose to use Rt to inform a dynamic epidemic model with time-varying force of infection in order to gain
insight into the attack ratio of each epidemic; (iii) We propose an estimation procedure for circulating
serotype’s S0 from aggregate case data, which is robust to epidemic sizes; We estimate the AR for 18
years of Dengue epidemics.
Figure 1 shows the Rt series, according to (1) [11] along with the confidence bands derived in this
paper. It can be seen that the inter-epidemic periods are characterized by Rt being indistinguishable from
1. Due to the intrinsic variability of the Rt series, the examination of its credible intervals is essential to
identify periods of sustained transmission. The wider intervals between epidemics are due to the scarcity of
cases during these periods. The method to quantify uncertainty proposed here provides more conservative
credibility intervals, and therefore offers protection against false alarms.

A key epidemiological quantity is the attack ratio (AR) of an epidemic, a measure of morbidity and
speed of spread which can be used to predict epidemic size and help efficient Public Health planning. The
AR depends fundamentally on the population at risk, which in the case of dengue is every naive (to a
particular serotype) individual in the population. Estimating the initial susceptible fraction S0 for each
epidemic is thus central to the estimation of the AR. Methods for estimating the number of susceptibles
have been proposed before, for other diseases [8, 9]. These methods try to reconstruct the entire series
of infectious and susceptibles for measles outbreaks from case data. In the case of dengue, the full
(multi-year/multi-epidemic) series of susceptibles to all possible serotypes, cannot be reconstructed based
solely on a deterministic transmission model, since the arrival/re-emergence of new serotypes (which are a
stochastic events) can change drastically the pool of susceptibles throwing off any sequential estimation
based on the incidence dynamics.
Since there is very limited information regarding the actual proportions of each virus in circulation
and most information available is about the predominant serotypes for some epidemics in the period of
study only [20], we propose the use of a simplified a single strain model. The main argument we put
forward is that by conditioning on the Rt series, we implicitly take into account the variability introduced
by the co-circulation of multiple serotypes and heterogeneous levels of immunity in the general population.

reported cases from which Rt is estimated. As expected, uncertainty about Rt is greater when the case
counts are low, for instance in the period 2003–2006, which represented a big hiatus between major
epidemics. The intrinsic variability of Rt can be used to inform the time-varying force of infection, since it
reflects variation in the vector population and other environmental factors such as temperature and
seasonal variation.
We sought to deal with all important sources of uncertainty impinging on the estimation of the AR of a
dengue epidemic, but not all could be satisfactorily addressed in this analysis. For instance, in any given
epidemic there is a large number of mild and asymptomatic cases, which nevertheless acquire immunity.
It is estimated that for every case reported, up to 10-20 are not seen by health authorities [21]. Another
source of uncertainty is under-reporting of diagnosed cases, which is a serious issue in the health care
systems of many developing countries such as Brazil. Duarte and França (2006) [22], estimated the
sensitivity of Dengue reporting for hospitalized patients in Belo-Horizonte, Brazil to be of 63%, meaning
that approximately 37% of the suspected Dengue cases go unreported. Lastly, demography and migrations
affect the number of susceptible in ways which are not easy to fully determine.
Figure 3, shows the model from (10) fitted to the data. Despite its limitations, our simplified model
fits the data well. In it we can see that the susceptibles series in each epidemic starts at the estimated
level of S0 . The proportion of susceptibles may seem low, but we must remember that these estimates
are being affected by an unknown under-reporting factor, which experts suggest is somewhere between
5 and 10, i.e. for every case observed there are 5 or 10 unobserved. Since this under-reporting affects
both the numerator and denominator of (13), its effects should cancel out, giving us an unbiased attack

ratio estimate. One other possible source of bias which would lead to the underestimation of S0 could
come from a significant part of the population not being exposed to the disease. However, as we can see
in Figure 2, despite the differences in intensity (incidence), the entire city seems to be at risk, with no
particularly “protected” areas, at least in the last four epidemics.

Table 1 contains the attack ratios and medians of the S0 estimated for each epidemic/outbreak. It
is interesting to notice that the larger epidemics, in terms of peak size are not the one with the greater
attack ratios. This stresses the importance of knowing the immunological structure of the population.
Knowing the S0 for the circulating viruses we can order to more accurately assess the potential impact of
a coming epidemic, since particularly virulent types, can be rendered less of a threat by a low S0 .
We hope that the results presented in paper will motivate public health authorities to invest in annual
serological surveys, to determine the susceptibility profile to each dengue virus as well as to estimate the
under-reporting factor of the notification system.

Appendix
A remark on prior distributions and tail behaviour of the distribution of Rt
There are a number of approaches to deriving the distribution of Rt . Alternatively to the approach
described in the main text [14], one could use the conditional distribution of Rt on Yt+1 and Yt as defined
in equation A7 of Nishiura et al. [11]:
fR (Rt ) = (Yt Rt )Yt+1 e−Yt Rt

(14)

Noticing the kernel of (14) is that of a gamma distribution with a2 = Yt+1 + 1 and b2 = Yt , we obtain a
proper density from which to construct cα (Rt ), simply by computing the appropriate quantiles of said
distribution. This density is
ba2
fN (Rt |a2 , b2 ) = 2 Rta2 −1 e−b2 Rt
(15)
Γ(a2 )

11

In order to decide which approach to take, it may be of use analysing the tail behaviour of the derived
distributions for Rt . Consider the case of using a flat U nif orm(0, 1) prior for θt . With a0 = b0 = 1,
a1 = a2 and b1 = b2 + 1. The beta prime (inverse beta distribution) will have heavier tails compared to
the conditional distribution proposed by [11], thus providing more conservative confidence/credibility
intervals. To see that one needs simply take the ratio of the Beta prime and Gamma (unnormalized)
densities and evaluate the limit as Rt goes to infinity:
fP (Rt |a1 , b1 )
eYt Rt
= lim
=∞
Rt →∞ fN (Rt |a2 , b2 )
Rt →∞ (1 + Rt )Yt +Yt+1 +2
lim

(16)

Finally, note that we deliberately construct cα (Rt ) as a equal-tailed 100α% credible set, rather than a less
conservative highest posterior density (HPD) interval.
As a side note, the Bayesian approach presented in this paper will give similar results to orthodox
confidence intervals [15] and [16] for Yt+1 and Yt >> 1. Under the flat uniform prior for θt , the Bayesian
posterior credibility interval is nearly indistinguishable from the confidence interval proposed by Clopper
& Pearson (1931) [16] for Yt+1 , Yt > 20. Note also that the uniform prior (Beta(1, 1)) for θt constitutes a
poor prior choice mainly because the induced distribution for Rt is only well-defined for b0 > 2.
An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that one can devise prior distributions for θt taking advantage
of the intuitive parametrization and flexibility of the beta family of distributions. Prior elicitation can
also be done for Rt and the hyper-parameters directly plugged into the prior for θt . One can, for example,
choose prior mean and variance for Rt and find a0 and b0 that satisfy those conditions. Let m0 and v0 be
the prior expectation and variance for Rt . After some tedious algebra one finds
m0 v0 + m30 + m20
v0
2v0 + m20 + m0

This approach thus makes it possible to incorporate epidemiological knowledge about disease Biology
(e.g. the magnitude of R0 ) into the computation of Rt . This may prove particularly important when
disease counts are low and/or close to the detection threshold. We provide an R script to perform the
above elicitation at https://github.com/fccoelho/paperLM1/blob/master/R/elicit_Rt_prior.R.
