Shear flow significantly affects the transport of swimming algae in suspension. For
example, viscous and gravitational torques bias bottom-heavy cells to swim towards regions of downwelling fluid (gyrotaxis). It is necessary to understand how
such biases affect algal dispersion in natural and industrial flows, especially in view
of growing interest in algal photobioreactors. Motivated by this, we here study
the dispersion of gyrotactic algae in laminar and turbulent channel flows using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the analytical swimming dispersion theory
of Bees & Croze [1]. Time-resolved dispersion measures are evaluated as functions
of the Péclet and Reynolds numbers in upwelling and downwelling flows. For laminar flows, DNS results are compared with theory using competing descriptions
of biased swimming cells in shear flow. Excellent agreement is found for predictions that employ generalized-Taylor-dispersion. The results highlight peculiarities
of gyrotactic swimmer dispersion relative to passive tracers. In laminar downwelling
flow the cell distribution drifts in excess of the mean flow, increasing in magnitude
with Peclet number. The cell effective axial diffusivity increases and decreases with
Peclet number (for tracers it merely increases). In turbulent flows, gyrotactic effects
are weaker, but discernable and manifested as non-zero drift. These results should
significantly impact photobioreactor design.

1. Introduction
In natural bodies of water and in industrial bioreactors, microscopic algae experience laminar and turbulent flows that play a critical role in their dispersion,
proliferation and productivity [2; 3]. The dispersion of passive tracers in fluid flows
is well understood, particularly in the industrially relevant cases of flows in pipes
and channels [4]. G. I. Taylor first realised that the dispersion of passive tracers in
a pipe, caused by the combination of fluid shear and molecular diffusion, could be

described in terms of an effective axial diffusivity [5]. A similar result also holds for
turbulent pipe [6] and channel [7] flows. Taylor’s pioneering analyses of dispersion
in a pipe inspired a series of studies that placed the understanding of the dispersion of neutrally buoyant tracers on a firm footing [8; 9]. Particles whose density
differs from the suspending medium exhibit more complex behaviour (for example,
they can accumulate at walls in turbulent channel flows; see [10; 11] and references
therein).
Swimming single-celled algae are known to respond non-trivially to flows. For
example, the mean swimming direction of biflagellates, such as Chlamydomonas and
Dunaliella spp., is biased by imposed flows [12; 13]. This bias, known as gyrotaxis,
results from the combination of viscous torques on the cell body, due to flow gradients, and gravitational torques, arising from bottom-heaviness and sedimentation
[14]. In the absence of flow gradients, the gravitational torque leads cells to swim
upwards on average (gravitaxis). Recent simulations and laboratory experiments
have shown how inertia and gyrotaxis can play significant roles in the formation
of patchiness and/or thin layers of toxic algae in the ocean [15; 16; 17]. Gravitaxis
and gyrotaxis can also couple in a complex fashion to other biases due to chemical
gradients (chemotaxis) and light (phototaxis [18]). Therefore, the fact that cells
can actively swim across streamlines and accumulate in specific regions of a flow
forewarns that the resultant dispersion of biased swimming algae in a complex flow
field is nontrivial.
In a recent study, Bees & Croze extend the classical Taylor-Aris analysis of
dispersion in a laminar flow in a tube to the case of biased swimming algae [1].
The Bees & Croze dispersion theory provides a general theoretical framework to
describe the dispersion of biased micro-swimmers in confined geometries, such as
pipes and channels. To make predictions for the dispersion of particular organisms,
specific functional expressions for the swimming characteristics need to be obtained
from microscopic models. For example, using expressions for the mean swimming
orientation q and diffusivity D from the so-called Fokker-Planck model [13], Bees
& Croze found that gyrotaxis can significantly modify the axial dispersion of swimming algae (such as Chlamydomonas spp.) in a pipe flow relative to the case of
passive tracers (or dissolved chemicals) [1]. More recently, Bearon et al. [19] obtained predictions for swimming dispersion in laminar flows in tubes of circular
cross-section by using an alternative microscopic model known as generalised Taylor dispersion (GTD), formulated for swimming algae [20; 21] and bacteria [22]. The
GTD model is considered superior, as it incorporates correlations in cell positions
due to cell locomotion within local a flow, as well as the gyrotactic orientational
biases considered in the Fokker-Planck description. The qualitatively distinct predictions, however, have yet to be tested. Direct tests of the models might involve
microscopic tracking of isolated cells swimming in prescribed flows. The Bees &
Croze theory allows the predictions of the two models to be tested for entire populations in macroscopic experiments [23] and individual-based numerical simulations,
as we shall demonstrate in this paper.
Microalgae currently play a prominent role in biotechnology. For example, they
are cultured commercially as nutritious fish and crustacean feed in aquaculture,
and for high-value products that they can synthesize, such as β−carotene [24].
Microalgae also hold significant potential for future exploitation; they can provide a sustainable biofuel feedstock that does not compete for arable land with

food crops. Despite significant efforts, however, current production systems remain
too inefficient for algal biofuels to be commercially viable [25]. Algal culture commonly occurs in open or closed bioreactors, with production systems employing
three stages: cell culture, harvest and downstream processing. Open bioreactors
consist of one or more artificial ponds, quiescent or stirred, where stirring allows
to obtain greater concentrations per reactor area [24]. A common design is the
raceway pond, in which rotating paddles generate flow (see figure 1a). Typically,
raceway ponds are shallow (depths L = 10 − 30 cm), which aids cell exposure to
light. Typically, the flow is turbulent (speeds of 30 cm/s), facilitating light exposure and gas exchange. Pond bioreactors are relatively cheap to operate, but are
limited by their low areal productivity and susceptibility to contamination. This
restricts the range of viable species in open pond culture to robust, high-value extremophiles, which grow in prohibitive conditions such as high salinity or low pH.
A greater variety of fast-growing algae can be cultured in closed bioreactors, where
single species are propagated within sealed transparent containers. Common geometries are flat, cylindrical (columnar or tubular), and annular, see figure 1b-c.
As for raceways, the constraint of light penetration limits the smallest dimension
to 10 cm. In tubular bioreactors the flow-speed typically is 50 cm/s, whilst flat
panel and columnar/annular set-ups operate at 1-10 cm/s [26]. Although closed
bioreactors allow for rapid growth conditions with small footprints, current designs
are relatively expensive to manufacture, operate and maintain, and the algae are
susceptible to invasion by other less-useful species.

Existing bioreactors operate under both laminar and turbulent flow conditions.
The transition between the two flow regimes depends on the ratio of inertial and
viscous forces in a fluid. This is expressed by the dimensionless Reynolds number
Re = UL/ν, where U and L are the characteristic speed and length scale of the
flow, respectively, and ν is the suspension kinematic viscosity [27]. In general, flows

with Re > 2000 will be turbulent, though the transition to turbulence depends on
geometry and particular flow conditions. Approximating the kinematic viscosity by
that of water and using the flow speed and length scales above, we see that flows in
air-lift reactors can be both laminar or turbulent (Re& 100), while raceway ponds
and tubular reactors are always turbulent (Re> 30000). The mixing properties of
turbulent flows are thought beneficial for cell growth, although clear evidence for
this is lacking. With air-lifts the mixing is caused by rising bubbles, which also
provide aeration, and the flow does not need to be turbulent. Both cells and nutrients will disperse in the above flows, with cell growth and productivity depending
critically on such dispersion.
Current photobioreactor designs assume that cells disperse like tracers, whether
they swim or not [28]. However, as detailed above, recent studies show that the distribution and consequent dispersion of swimming cells in flows, including biotechnological interesting species like Dunaliella, should be very different from that of
passive tracers [1; 19]. For example, if cells disperse differently to nutrients in a
reactor they will separate, which could have catastrophic consequences for growth.
Inspired by the possibility of taking advantage of the peculiarities of swimmer response to flow to improve bioreactor operation, we study here the dispersion of
gyrotactic swimming algae in laminar and turbulent channel flows. We carry out
time-resolved direct numerical simulations, comparing results to predictions from
the Bees & Croze dispersion theory applied to channel geometry. The paper is
structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the simulation methods and outline
a derivation of the theory for the new geometry. In Section 3, we present simulation
results for the dispersion of biased swimming algae in laminar and turbulent flows,
comparing theory and simulation results for laminar flows. In Section 4, we interpret the results, and discuss their implications for dispersion in photobioreactors
and the environment.

2. Methods
(a) Direct numerical simulations (DNS): governing equations
We simulate the dynamics of a population of biased swimming micro-organisms,
typically N = 2 × 105 and 106 individuals per simulation (see table 1), placed
in laminar and turbulent flows. Each microswimmer is modelled as a spheroidal
particle whose position xi , i = 1..N , evolves according to
dxi
= u + Vs p
dt

(2.1)

where Vs is the mean cell swimming speed, u is the local fluid velocity and p is the
local particle orientation.
The orientation p of each swimmer evolves in response to the biasing torques
acting upon it. Making the realistic simplifying assumption that swimming cells
have a spheroidal geometry, the reorientation rate of the organisms is defined by
the inertia-free balance of gravitational and viscous torques [29; 13]

where k is a unit vector in the vertical direction; B = µα⊥ /(2hρg) is the gyrotactic
reorientation time (h denotes the centre-of-mass offset relative to the centre-ofbuoyancy, α⊥ is the dimensionless resistance coefficient for rotation about an axis
perpendicular to p, ρ and µ are the fluid density and viscosity, respectively); α0 =
(a2 − b2 )/(a2 + b2 ) is the eccentricity of the spheroids with major axis a and minor
axis b; and, finally, E is the rate of strain tensor and ω the vorticity. The noise Γr
is added to simulate the stochastic rotational diffusivity of a swimming cell.
√ In the
simulations it is implemented with random angular steps of magnitude 2dr , so
that cells diffuse with rotational diffusivity dr [30; 31].
The flow field u is obtained by solving the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid, such that

shall assume cells to be neutrally buoyant, neglecting feedback from the particles
to the flow (these effects are explored elsewhere [1]).

(b) DNS: geometry, scaling and statistical measures of dispersion
We consider a standard channel geometry: two flat plates parallel to each other,
infinite in extent, and separated by a gap of size 2H. When focusing on swimming
cells it would seem natural to rescale length by the plate half-width H and time
by H 2 dr /Vs2 , where Vs is the mean swimming speed and dr is the cell rotational
diffusivity, the characteristic time a cell swimming with Vs takes to diffuse across
H with diffusivity Vs2 d−1
r . However, the parameter values obtained from this ‘cellbased’ rescaling are too large and thus numerically inconvenient for simulations.
Thus we adopt a ‘flow-based’ rescaling in terms of the characteristic length H and
the flow-based timescale H/Uc , the time taken for a flow with centerline speed Uc
to advect a cell by H. In terms of this rescaling, the dimensionless equations of
motion for a biased swimming cell are

supplementary materials) to find x∗i (t∗ ) = [x∗i (t∗ ), yi∗ (t∗ ), zi∗ (t∗ )]. Enumerating the
number of cells N (x) at a given position x in a bin of fixed volume ∆V , we obtain
the cell concentration c(x) = N (x)/∆V . From the cell coordinates can we further
define statistical measures of the cell dispersion in a flow: the adimensional drift Λ∗0
with respect to the mean flow U = (2/3)Uc ; the effective streamwise diffusivity De∗
and the skewness of the cell distribution, γ. These measures of dispersion are given

(2.9)

where Pe is the cell Péclet number defined with respect to the center-line speed (see
equation (2.13)). Note that the skewness γ does not depend on the scaling used.
We shall present results in terms of the cell-based scaling and compare their limit
at long times with analytical predictions.
(c) Analytical theory: dispersion in laminar flows at long times
Here, we shall obtain analytical predictions for the dispersion of algae swimming in laminar channel flow that will be compared with the results from the
simulations. The general Bees & Croze [1] continuum dispersion theory for biased
swimmers will be applied to the new channel geometry; it is valid in the long-time
limit (t ≫ H 2 dr /Vs2 ). The derivation for channel flow is similar to the pipe flow
example in Bees & Croze, so we provide an outline here. Those readers that are
less mathematically inclined may skip the derivation of the results in this section.
We shall begin with the continuity equation for the cell number density n:
∂n
= −∇ · [n (u + Vc ) − D · ∇n] .
∂t

(2.10)

The flow velocity u is the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation (2.3). We adopt
the same coordinate system described above for the DNS. For laminar flows such
that the flow downstream is only a function of the wall-normal coordinate y, the
flow velocity can be expressed as
u(y) = u(y)ex = U [1 + χ(y)]ex ,

(2.11)

where U is the mean flow speed and χ(y) describes the variation in the streamwise
direction about this mean. It is convenient to translate to a reference frame travelling with the mean flow, and non-dimensionalise lengthscales by H and timescales
by the time to diffuse across the channel H 2 dr /Vs2 . Thus, x̂ = (x−U t)/H, ŷ = y/H,
ẑ = z/H and t̂ = Vs2 t/(H 2 dr ), where hats denote dimensionless variables.

We assume unidirectional coupling of the cell dynamics to the flow (for bidirectional coupling due to non-neutrally buoyant cells see [1]): cells are biased by
shear in the flow, so that the cell swimming velocity Vc = Vs q, where q is the
mean swimming direction, and diffusivity tensor D are functions of local flow gradients. Here, we consider analytical predictions for spherical cells (α0 = 0), so cell
orientation is only a function of vorticity, ω = ∇ × u = −χ′ ez .
Consider planar Poiseuille flow, χ = (1 − 3y 2 )/2 and U = (2/3)Uc [32], where
Uc is the centerline (maximum) flow speed. Equation (2.10) becomes

where hats have been dropped for clarity. Pe is a Péclet number, the dimensionless
ratio of the rates of transport by the flow and swimming diffusion, and β is the ratio
of channel half-width to the length a cell swims before reorienting significantly.
Alternatively, we can re-write β = HVs2 dr /Vs2 and interpret it as a ‘swimming’
Péclet number, the ratio of the rates of transport by swimming and diffusion. Noflow and no-flux boundary conditions will be applied to (2.12), such that

As the flow is translationally invariant along x, the mean swimming direction
and diffusivity tensor are independent of x: D = D(y), q = q(y). This permits a
treatment of dispersion using moments in a similar vein to that of Aris [8]. The pth
moment with respect to the axial direction is defined as

(related to the first axial moment) controls the value of the diffusivity.
To make predictions from (2.20) and (2.22) we require expressions for D and
q from microscopic models of the statistical response of cells to flow. Two main
models have been proposed for biased swimming algae: the Fokker-Planck (FP)
model [33; 34] and generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) [20; 21; 19]. For spherical
cells, each model predicts how nondimensional swimming direction q and diffusivity D depend on two nondimensional quantities: σ(y) = −χ′ (y)U/(2dr H) =
−χ′ (y)(1/3)(Pe/β 2 ), the ratio of reorientation time by rotational diffusion to that
by shear (vorticity), and λ = 1/(2dr B), the ratio between the time of reorientation
by rotational diffusion (1/2)d−1
r and the gyrotactic reorientation time B. The functional forms for the transport parameters q(σ) and Dm (σ), where subscripts m =F
and G denote the FP and GTD models, respectively, are given in appendix A. In
particular, the two models differ qualitatively in their predictions for the diffusivity as a function of the shear rate and therefore they provide different predictions
for cell distribution and dispersion. The dispersion predictions (2.20) and (2.22)
were evaluated numerically with Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) using q(σ) and
Dm (σ) from the two models, see supplementary materials.
(d ) Parameters, simulation time and flow profiles
In simulations and theoretical evaluations we used the following cell parameters
based on C. augustae: Vs = 0.01 cm s−1 (swimming speed), dr = 0.067 s−1 (cell
rotational diffusivity), and B = 3.4 s (gyrotactic reorientation time) [1]. Further,
we consider the flow of suspensions taken to have the same viscosity as water,
ν = 0.01 cm2 s−1 . The cell eccentricity α0 is also held fixed. The analytical theory
presented above assumes that cells are spherical, α0 = 0, but laminar and turbulent
simulations have also been performed for elongated cells with α0 = 0.8. With these

parameters fixed, choosing the centreline speed Uc and channel width H gives the
nondimensional flow-based parameters used in the DNS: vs = Vs /Uc (dimensionless
swimming speed), η = 2BUc /H (gyrotactic parameter), d∗r = dr H/Uc (dimensionless rotational diffusivity), and Reynolds number Re= Uc H/ν. For the test run
with passive tracers an additional noise term was added to equation 2.4 to simulate
the translational diffusivity Dt , nondimensionalised as Dt∗ = Dt /(Uc H). These flowbased parameters can be transformed into cell-based nondimensional parameters for
comparison with analytical predictions. From the definitions above and equation
(2.13) it can be shown that Pe= d∗r /vs2 (flow Péclet number), β = d∗r /vs (swimming
Péclet number) and σ(y) = −(1/3)χ′ (y)/d∗r (local dimensionless shear-rate). Since
χ′ (y) = −3y for plane Poiseuille flow, the maximum dimensionless shear is given
by |σmax | = 1/d∗r = ηλ, where we recall λ = 1/(2Bdr ), the nondimensional bias
parameter. Simulations are more readily interpreted and compared to analytical
theory in terms of these parameters (shown in table 1).
The dimensionless flow profiles corresponding to the Reynolds numbers used in
this study are plotted in figure 2 for the benefit of the reader. Laminar flows are selfsimilar, so the nondimensional flow has the same parabolic profile for all Re. Timeaverged turbulent flows have distinct profiles that depend on the Reynolds number.
Note that the number of degrees of freedom in the turbulent flow simulations scales
as Re9 [27]. This makes large Re simulations computationally expensive. For this
reason we do not investigate dispersion for flows beyond Re= 10000.

3. Results
(a) Passive tracers: classical dispersion
The dispersion of passive tracers, such as molecular dyes or nonmotile cells, is
generally well understood. In laminar channel flow passive tracers are transported
on average at the mean flow speed; there is no drift relative to mean flow: Λ0 = 0.
The effective axial diffusivity De , is given at long times by the Taylor-Aris result
De = 1 + (8/945)Pe2 [32; 4]. As a benchmark test, we carried out direct numerical
simulations for passive tracers (solving equation (2.4) with vs = 0 and translational
noise to simulate molecular diffusivity, see methods). A typical result is shown in
figure 3 for Pe= 3000. As expected at long times Λ0 → 0 and the Taylor-Aris
diffusivity prediction, De = 76191, compares very well with simulation results. The
skewness slowly tends to zero at long times as t−0.5 (see supplementary material),
suggesting approach to a normal distribution [8]. The above results for passive

Figure 3. Time dependence of the effective diffusivity, De , for passive tracers in a laminar
flow with Pe= 3000. For long times De ≃ 76191, the constant value predicted from the
classical Taylor-Aris dispersion for passive tracers (see text). The inset shows the expected
zero drift, Λ0 , above the mean flow and the skewness, γ, tending to zero at long times,
suggesting an approach to the expected normally distributed axial concentration profile
[8].

tracers will be compared with the dispersion of gyrotactic swimmers. They can also
be used to check our analytical theory in the limiting case of unbiased swimmers
with no gyrotactic response to flow. In this limit, q = 0 and the diffusivity tensor
is isotropic D = I/6, where I is the identity matrix (see also [19]). Thus, in the
calculation of equations (2.20) and (2.22), Dxx = 1/6 = Dyy , qi = 0 and Dxy = 0
(as Y00 = 1 and J(y) = 0), so that Λ0 = 0, as expected for passive tracers, and

diffusers in 3D, we recover De′ = 1 + (8/945)Pe′2, the classical Taylor-Aris result
for channels.
The dispersion of passive tracers in turbulent channel flows has also been elucidated [9]. Elder derived the (dimensional) effective diffusivity K of passive tracers
in turbulent open channel flow as K = 5.9 uτ H, where uτ is the friction velocity
and H is the channel depth [7; 9]. This open channel result applies equally to a
closed channel with half-width H. Using the approximation Uc /uτ ≈ 5 log10 Re [27],
this result can be written as K ≈ 2.72νRe/ ln(Re). To compare results across the
laminar-turbulent transition (see later in figure 12), we use equations (2.7) and
(2.13) to obtain a nondimensional turbulent diffusivity De = K/D0 as a function
of Pe, where D0 is the characteristic diffusivity scale. However, we stress that the
diffusivity depends only on Re in the turbulent case: molecular diffusivity is negligible [6]. Notice also from the result of Elder how the effective turbulent diffusivity
grows less sharply with Pe than in the laminar regime. Below, we will contrast the
classical predictions for dispersion discussed in this section with our new results for
biased swimmers.
(b) Gyrotactic algae: a new, non-classical ‘swimming dispersion’
(i) Laminar downwelling flows: gyrotactic swimming strongly affects dispersion
It is illuminating to consider how gyrotactic cells distribute across a channel in
downwelling laminar flows, as this determines their streamwise dispersion. Figure
4 displays the time-evolution of the cross-sectional cell concentration profiles in
the wall-normal direction y for a selection of values of (Pe, β). It is seen that an
initially uniform concentration profile evolves to one focused at the channel centre. This is what one would expect for swimming gyrotactic cells with orientations
biased by combined gravitational and viscous torques [12; 13]. At the population
scale, the long-time concentration distribution is a result of the balance between
cross-stream cell diffusion and biased swimming. In section (2c), the cell concentrationR (normalised by its mean) is given by equation (2.21)): Y00 = c(y)/c̄ =

)ds . (Recall subscripts m =G, F denote solutions of the GTD
exp β 0 (q y /Dm
and FP microscopic models respectively.) The two models predict a qualitatively
different dependence of concentration distribution on Pe and β. Whilst the FP approach allows for cells to diffuse more and focus less as the cells tumble in flows
with large shear rates, the GTD model finds that with increasing local shear rate,
σ, the diffusivity of tumbling cells decreases faster than the decrease in cross-stream
cell focusing.
It has hitherto been unclear if GTD, mathematically more complicated than
the FP approach, provides more accurate predictions. Thus we compare the DNS
results and theoretical predictions from the two models. Figure 5 displays the longtime cell distributions from DNS contrasted with theoretical predictions using GTD
and FP. It is clear that DNS profiles get broader with increasing β/Pe, so profiles
are shown for different values of this ratio (individual values of Pe and β are shown
in the figure caption). GTD and DNS profiles agree very well for all the values
of β/Pe simulated. The FP model only agrees well with the DNS for large values
of β/Pe, where predictions coincide with those of GTD. The agreement is poor
at low values (very poor for the sharply focused distribution β/Pe= 0.002). It
is possible to quantify the scaling of the breadth of the profiles with the ratio

experimentally (see discussion), but the DNS results indicate that GTD is likely a
superior model of gyrotactic response to flow than the FP approach.

(△), (27, 6.7, 0.25) (). Theoretical predictions from the GTD and FP models (lines, see
legend), are compared with the simulations. GTD predictions agree very well with DNS
profiles for all β/Pe, but for FP agreement is poor for small values of this ratio. As in
figure 4, DNS profiles broaden with increasing β/Pe is increased. This is as predicted by
GTD, where profiles can be approximated as Gaussians of width y0 = [(2/λ)(β/Pe)]0.5 ,
see text and appendix A.

As for the passive case of figure 3, we have quantified dispersion using the statistical measures: Λ0 (t), the drift above the mean flow; De (t), the effective diffusivity;
and γ(t), the skewness. These are plotted in figure 6 for Pe= 27, 670 and 1675
at the fixed value of β = 33.5. In these simulations, statistically stationary values
for Λ0 (t) and De (t) are achieved for dimensionless times t ∼ 1; steady values are
reached earlier for larger Pe. In terms of the Bees & Croze dispersion theory, steady
dispersion is achieved in the long-time limit when transient solutions to the moment equations have died down: t ≫ τ1 . The analysis of transient solutions with
DNS will be carried out in a future study, but it is reasonable that gyrotaxis makes
the approach to steady dispersion faster than for passive tracers. The skewness
is negative and approaches zero (with γ ∼ t−0.49 for Pe= 27; see supplementary
materials), suggesting a distribution tending to normality. Bees & Croze predicted
the power law decay γ = γ0 t−1/2 (the pre-factor γ0 (β,Pe) depends on gyrotactic
swimming) with the same exponent as the passive case [8].
The steady gyrotactic swimmer dispersion displays some very surprising features, evident in the data presented in figure 6. For example, Λ0 , zero in the passive
case, grows from a negative value to large positive values as Pe is increased. The
effective diffusivity De , on the other hand, shows a non-monotonic behaviour for
increasing Pe (recall De ∼Pe2 for passive tracers). We can qualitatively account
for this behaviour considering the concentration distributions analysed above. Cells
are biased to swim to the centre of the channel. Here only the torque due to gravity
acts on cells, so cells swim upward at their mean swimming speed, which may be
comparable with the mean flow speed for small Pe leading to Λ0 < 0. For large Pe,
the upwards swimming speed is negligible. As cell accumulation at the centre of
the channel increases with Pe due to gyrotaxis they drift more relative to the mean

Figure 6. Evolution of the dispersion of a population of gyrotactic swimming algae in a
vertical down-welling laminar channel flow. The drift above the mean flow, Λ0 (t), effective
diffusivity, De (t), and skewness, γ(t) are displayed for Pe= 27, 670 and 1675, top to bottom
as shown, for fixed β = 33.5. Uniquely, gyrotactic swimming algae have a non-zero drift

flow, and so Λ0 is an increasing function of Pe. Cell accumulation at the centre of
the channel removes them from regions of high shear rate, eventually leading to a
decrease in their effective axial diffusivity with increasing Pe.
The Bees & Croze dispersion theory allows for the quantification of this intriguing dispersion behaviour; the results are summarized in section (3c) below. Prior
to this, we shall consider time-dependent dispersion in turbulent flows.
(ii) Turbulent downwelling flows: persistent but weaker swimming dispersion
Here we describe the first DNS study of the dispersion of gyrotactic cells in
turbulent channel flows. To compare turbulent and laminar results we first focus
on downwelling flows. Simulations were performed for (Pe, Re)= (16570, 2500),
(28140, 4200) and (67000, 10000), with corresponding values of β = 33.5, 55 and 67.

close to the walls where shear is large, but the mean profile departs little from uniform
concentration (expected of passive tracers).

shown in figure 7. It is clear that the mean cell concentration is uniform (barring
small fluctuations about the mean) for almost the entire channel width, except for
regions close to the wall that are gyrotactically depleted of cells (gyrotactically depleted regions occupy only a small fraction (< 4%) of the channel width). Shear
and advection experienced by a cell in turbulent flows are very different from the
laminar case. The turbulent flow can be thought of as a time-averaged base profile
on which are superposed turbulent fluctuations (the well-known Reynolds decomposition [27]). The shear rate of the base profile is close to zero in the middle of the
channel, and large at the walls, see figure 2, and deviates from the laminar case;
this alone will lead to broader concentration profiles. On top of this, turbulent fluctuations perturb the flow, causing cell reorientation and advection. We can think
of turbulence as endowing cells with an increased diffusivity [35] acting to make
gyrotactic accumulations in this downwelling case less pronounced. Only close to
the walls is the impact of mean shear sufficient to cause significant cell depletion;
an effect that increases with β/Pe in a similar fashion to the laminar case. The
small but measurable effects of gyrotaxis on the concentration profiles are reflected
in the time-dependent dispersion measures for the turbulent case, plotted in figure
8 for the same values of (Pe, β) considered above. We leave a detailed analysis
of transients to a future study but note that, due to the increased diffusivity by
turbulence, the approach to the limiting behaviour is faster than in the laminar
case. Less obviously, the long-time dispersion retains a rich behaviour (observe the
order of the curves in figure 7). In particular, notice that cells have a nonzero drift
Λ0 ; this is due to local focusing of cells in downwelling regions of the fluctuating
flow. The dispersion of gyrotactic swimmers is thus qualitatively distinct from that
of passive tracers even in a turbulent flow. As Pe is increased to the maximum

by turbulence.
(iii) Dispersion in upwelling flows
The case of dispersion in flows directed vertically upwards (against the direction
of gravity) is considered here briefly. The DNS results for the same values of Pe
and β as the laminar downwelling case of section (3i) are shown in Figure 9. The
drift above the mean flow Λ0 is positive for small Pe, and grows more negative
with increasing Pe. This behaviour is the result of the peculiar distribution of
gyrotactic cells in the flow: cells in upwelling flow are biased to swim not to the
channel centre, but to the walls [12]. Interestingly, accumulation and dispersion
depend critically on the flow direction! The inset of figure 9, bottom, shows the
normalised cell concentration c/c̄ in the wall normal direction y, demonstrating the

wall accumulation, which becomes more peaked with decreasing β/Pe (for more
details, see supplementary materials). Thus, for fixed β and increasing Pe, cells
focus at the walls and experience slower flow and less of the shear profile, leading
to a decrease in both the drift, Λ0 , and the diffusivity, De . The change of sign in
Λ0 has a similar explanation as for the downwelling case.
The upwelling turbulent case, presented in figure 10, was also investigated for
the same parameter values as the downwelling case of section (3ii). We see that
dispersion measures do not reach steady values: both Λ0 and De grow monotonically
with time for the duration of the simulation run. The inset to the top figure 10 shows
the cell concentration profiles displaying a thin band of gyrotactic accumulation at
the walls. Cells that end up in this band are subject to strong dispersal by the large
mean shear rate at the wall. Diffusion, whether due to turbulence or swimming, is
not strong enough to balance the shear-induced migration towards the wall, as is
the case for laminar flow, leading to non-steady dispersion over the course of the
simulations.
However, the upwelling dispersion results presented above are not realistic for
swimming species that are negatively buoyant; accumulations of negatively buoyant
cells at the walls can result in instability and the formation of downwelling flow and
descending plumes near the walls [12]. These instabilities will differ in their extent
in the laminar and turbulent upwelling cases, but we expect buoyancy driven wall
flows to ensue after accumulation in both regimes.

effective diffusivity De . Note that in the turbulent case neither of the statistical measures
reaches a steady value.

(iv) The effects of cell elongation
So far we have assumed that the gyrotactic cells are spherical, setting the eccentricity parameter α0 to zero. Here we present simulations obtained with a non-zero
eccentricity, α0 = 0.8, for the cases (Pe, β) = (670, 6.7) (laminar) and (28140, 55)
(turbulent). We chose the relatively large value of α0 = 0.8 to emphasise the effect
of eccentricity. Results for the effective diffusivity for downwelling flow are shown
in figure 11 for the laminar and turbulent cases. The insets in the figure display
the concentration profiles. We see that in the laminar case the effect of eccentricity
is to broaden the profile, as observed in Bearon et al. [36]. This broader distribution results in an increased value of effective diffusivity (cells sample more of the
shear profile). In the turbulent case of figure 11 (bottom) there is a much smaller
broadening effect. The effect of cell elongation on other statistical measures for the
parameters considered here is marginal, see supplementary materials. If realistic
values of biflagellate eccentricity (α0 = 0-0.3 [14]) are used, predictions for the
dispersion of biased swimmers are not very different from those obtained here for
spherical cells.
(c) Long-time dispersion of gyrotactic cells as a function of P e (Re) across the
laminar-turbulent transition
Having analysed the full time-dependence of gyrotactic cell dispersion, we concentrate here on its long-time behaviour. In this limit, laminar DNS results can be

Figure 11. The effect of cell elongation on dispersion. DNS simulations of the effective
diffusivity De performed for spherical (α0 = 0) and elongated (α0 = 0.8) cells for downwelling flows. Top: laminar flow, with Pe= 670 and β = 6.7; bottom: turbulent flow, with
Pe= 28140 and β = 55. Even for the large α0 value considered, qualitative effects are not
observed and significant quantitative differences are apparent only in the laminar case (see
text and supplementary materials).

compared with predictions from analytical theory for drift Λ0 and diffusivity De
as functions of Pe (for given β). The theory requires as inputs expressions for the
mean swimming direction, q, and diffusivity tensor, D, obtained from microscopic
stochastic models. We test two alternative microscopic models: Fokker-Planck (FP)
and generalised Taylor dispersion (GTD). The models predict qualitatively different functional forms for the components of D as a function of the dimensionless
shear σ. Correspondingly, predictions for Λ0 (Pe) and De (Pe) obtained with the two
models also differ.
The predictions from the analytical theory are shown as curves in figure 12a,
b, for fixed values of β; the corresponding DNS results for selected Pe and the
same values of β are shown as points. It is clear that, for the GTD predictions, the
agreement between theory and simulation for Λ0 is very good. The GTD prediction
is that, for fixed β, Λ0 increases with Pe, tending to a linear behaviour for large
enough Pe. This is in contrast to passive tracers, for which Λ0 = 0. For small
Pe the FP prediction coincides with that of GTD, but, for larger Pe, Λ0 tends
to a constant instead of growing with Pe. The smaller the value of β, the greater
is the difference between the predictions of the two microscopic models (as for
concentration profiles). A similar trend is seen for the effective diffusivity De , shown

of Pe for gyrotactic cells in downwelling flows. Values of β are: 1.34 ( ), 6.7 (+), 33.5
(), 55 (N), 67 (♦). The DNS results are compared with predictions from the Bees &
Croze dispersion theory, using the FP and GTD microscopic models, plotted as lines for
the same β values as the DNS, see legend. Simulation results compare well with GTD
predictions for all β, but, for Pe& 1, they are incompatible with FP predictions for small
β. Also plotted in (b) are the classical results for passive tracers. In laminar flows, Λ0 = 0
and De ∼Pe2 , in sharp contrast with our predictions for swimmers. In turbulent flow, we
still have Λ0 > 0 for swimmers, though it appears to decay to zero with increasing Pe.
The turbulent De for swimmers is close to the passive case; see text.

as a function of Pe in 12b. We see that for β = 33.5, both GTD and FP predict a
diffusivity rising and then falling with Pe, consistent with DNS results. For smaller
values of β, however, the FP and GTD predictions are different: GTD predicts a
decrease of De at large Pe, while FP predicts a (second) rise. The DNS results are
not compatible with this rise, but agree well with the GTD prediction. We remark
that this dispersion behaviour is unique to swimming cells. It is due to gyrotactic
bias and the ensuing accumulations that change the distribution of cells and thus
their dispersion, as discussed above. Also shown in figure 12b is the diffusivity for
passive tracers, which grows as De ∼ Pe2 [5], without the decrease at large Pe we
predict for gyrotactic swimmers.
In earlier sections we have seen how the effect of gyrotaxis on accumulation and
dispersion is more subtle in turbulent flows. DNS results for long-time dispersion
reflect these changes and are also summarised in figure 12. An analytical theory of
turbulent swimming dispersion has yet to be formulated, so we compare only with
theory for passive tracers. It is seen for all simulations with β = 33.5, that the value
of Λ0 , which was growing with Pe in the laminar regime, drops a little just beyond
the transition to turbulence. On the other hand, the diffusivity De , which was
falling at large laminar Pe, suddenly acquires a sizeable value. The turbulent shear
profile and fluctuations alter the distribution of cells. The effect of gyrotaxis is thus
weakened but still measurable in the dispersion, which is similar but not identical to
that of passive tracers. The fractional drift above the mean flow speed U = (2/3)Uc,
is given by δ ≡ limt→∞ (1/U )[dm1 /dt − U ] = (3/2)Λ0 /Pe; this is rather small for
large turbulent Pe values. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that drift should not be
zero in a turbulent flow, as it is for passive tracers. For very large values of Pe,
we expect gyrotaxis to have practically no effect on dispersion: the time-averaged
concentration profile will be well-approximated as uniform and Λ0 = 0. Indeed our
results suggest that Λ0 → 0 for increasing Pe in the turbulent regime.

4. Discussion
We have studied the dispersion of gyrotactic swimming algae in channel flows by
direct numerical simulations (DNS) and analytical theory. This is the first study
to evaluate cell distributions and statistical measures of gyrotactic cell dispersion
(drift above mean flow Λ0 , effective diffusivity De and skewness γ) for flows on
either side of the laminar-turbulence transition. We find unique cell accumulations
and dispersion with non-zero drift and a non-monotonic diffusivity with Peclet
number, Pe, with qualitative differences for upwelling and downwelling flows. The
dispersion behaviour is remarkable and unique to gyrotactic swimming cells; passive
tracers are transported at the mean flow rate (Λ0 = 0), the diffusivity increases
with Pe (De ∼Pe2 ) [5], and dispersion is insensitive to channel orientation. In the
laminar downwelling regime, simulation results were compared with the predictions
derived from a recently formulated general analytical theory of swimming dispersion
[1; 19], applied here for the first time to channel geometry. The theory requires as
inputs expressions for cell response to the local shear in a flow, determined from
microscopic models.
We have evaluated predictions based on two alternative models: the FokkerPlanck (FP) [33; 34] and generalised Taylor dispersion (GTD) [20; 21; 19] approaches. Which model is more realistic has long been a matter of debate [20]. Here

we find that the DNS are in excellent agreement with analytical predictions based
on GTD, providing the first evidence that it is much better than the FP model
at describing swimmers in flows. As well as validating analytical predictions for
laminar flow, the DNS allow us to explore the industrially relevant dispersion of
gyrotactic algae in turbulent channel flows. In the turbulent regime the effects of
gyrtoaxis (accumulations resulting in non-zero drift) persist, but are much more
subtle. Effective diffusivity in downwelling turbulent flows is similar to that of passive tracers. These are the first full direct numerical simulations of biased swimmers
in turbulent channel flows; previous studies having concentrated on vortical flow
[37] or synthetic approximations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence [35; 31].
The fact that swimming algae in channel flows distribute very differently to
passive tracers has important practical consequences for the culture of swimming
species. The most dramatic implications of our findings are for photobioreactors
that operate using laminar flows. For example, in draft tube air-lift bioreactors,
bubbles up a central draft tube (riser) mix and aerate cells, which then circulate
down the channel formed between the draft tube and the surface of the reactor
(downcomer; see figure 1c). The Bees & Croze [1] analytical theory, confirmed by
simulations, predicts that gyrotactic swimming algae will be focused more and
more sharply at the center of the downcomer as Pe (the flow rate for fixed channel
width, or Re) is increased. For example, considering a flow with Pe= 1675 (Re=
250) and the swimming Peclet number β = 33.5 (H= 5cm), we predict that the
concentration at the walls is a vanishingly small fraction of the mean, given by
c/c̄ ≈ exp [−Peλ/(2β)] ∼ 10−22 (using λ = 2.2 for Chlamydomonas augustae; see
approximations in Appendix A). Non-swimming cells and molecular solutes, on the
other hand, would be uniformly distributed across the tube, c/c̄ = 1. As we can
reasonably assume that the probability of cell adhesion to the walls is proportional
to the concentration there, we predict that surface fouling by gyrotactic cells will
be markedly reduced relative to non-swimming cells. Fouling can be a big problem
in closed bioreactors because cells buildup can prevent light penetration and thus
growth, and in extreme cases can clog reactor conduits [38].
The peculiar dispersion of biased swimmers will also affect growth in bioreactors. Our results indicate that gyrotactic swimmers in a downwelling flow drift
faster and diffuse less than passive tracers, which travel at the mean flow. We can
make experimentally measurable predictions for the dispersion of Chlamydomonas
augustae, the alga whose swimming parameters (reorientation time B, rotational
diffusivity dr , swimming speed Vs ) we have used in this study. For example, in
the case with β = 6.7 and Pe= 670 (e.g. a realistic, small air-lift with H = 1 cm
and Uc = 1 cm/s) the fractional drift above the mean flow, δ = (3/2)Λ0 /Pe, is
estimated to be δ = 0.48. In other words C. augustae cells drift about 50% faster
than passive tracers, such as nutrients. For the nondimensional effective diffusivity
we predict De = 0.8: the axial diffusivity of cells is smaller than the cell diffusivity
scale (Vs2 /dr = 1.49 × 10−3 cm2 /s) in the absence of flow. To compare these predictions with those for passive molecular solutes, we consider the dispersion of CO2
(molecular diffusivity Dt = 1.6 × 10−5 cm2 /s), a vital nutrient for algae. In the
flow under consideration, cells have Pe= 670, but CO2 , with its smaller diffusivity,
has Pet =Pe Vs2 /(dr Dt ) = 6.2 × 104 . Thus, the non-dimensional tracer diffusivity is
De,t ≈ (8/945)Pe2t ∼ 107 , from the Taylor-Aris result. Re-dimensionalising swimming and solute effective diffusivities by multiplying by diffusivity scales, we find

23

that the axial diffusivity of CO2 along a channel is ≈ 105 times greater than that of
C. augustae. This dramatic differential dispersion of cells and nutrients could have
important consequences for swimming cell growth in reactors.
In turbulent downwelling flows, which may also be realised in air-lifts, the effects gyrotactic swimming are much less pronounced. Gyrotactic depletion is not
as efficient as in laminar flows: the concentration at the walls is at best half of the
mean concentration. We thus expect significant fouling in air-lifts under turbulent
regimes. The influence of gyrotaxis on dispersion is also weaker than in the laminar case. For C. augustae in a turbulent channel flow with β = 55 (H = 8.4cm)
and Pe= 28140 (Re= 4200, Uc = 5cm/s), the DNS predict a fractional drift of
δ = 0.015. This is very small, and may be neglected for short channels. As shown
in figure 12b, the effective diffusivity is of the same order as that of a passive tracer
such as CO2 .
The excellent agreement between DNS and predictions for dispersion obtained
using generalised Taylor dispersion theory, provides a first confirmation that the
swimming dispersion theory of Bees & Croze [1] is robust. If they are to be useful in
bioreactor engineering design, however, the theoretical and numerical predictions for
dispersion need to be tested against experiments. Work is in progress to test GTD
predictions for pipe flow with the alga Dunaliella [23]. It would also be interesting
to test experimentally the numerical and analytical predictions for channel flow
presented herein, exploring in particular the laminar-turbulent transition region.
Since tubes are often arranged horizontally in bioreactor designs, it will be interesting to study the effect of tube orientation on biased swimmer dispersion. Croze et
al. [39] have carried out experiments on the dispersion of Chlamydomonas augustae in horizontal pipe flow for low Pe. They found a complex transport mediated
by sheared bioconvection patterns and suggested that such cell-driven flows could
alter the transition to turbulence. It would be interesting to study this transition
experimentally and with the aid of simulations such as presented here, including
the effects of cell buoyancy (especially for small Pe flows) [19].
More generally, our study could be extended to open channel flows, such as
those present in pond bioreactors, channels, waterfalls and rivers. The swimming
dispersion effects we have explored must also exist whenever biased swimmers are
subject to shear in the ocean and lakes. Significantly, about 90% of species implicated in the formation of harmful algal blooms swim using flagella [40]. A recent
study has shown that Heterosigma akashiwo is gyrotactic and could be responsible
for thin layer formation [16]. However, the role of biased swimming in the dispersion
and ecology of algae remains largely unexplored.

S1. Numerical methods for the simulations
The numerical code is an efficient pseudo-spectral solver for the three-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (equations 2.3 or 2.6 in the main text) with
a particle tracking algorithm [11] adapted to swimming micro-organisms. The velocity components of the fluid phase are expanded in both x (streamwise) and z
(spanwise) direction with Fourier modes, whereas Chebyshev polynomials are employed in the wall-normal y-direction. To advance the Navier-Stokes equations in
time, we use a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. Periodic boundary conditions
are assumed in x and z, with no-slip at both walls y = ±1. More details about the
code are given in [41]. For the DNS with laminar flow, the flow is not simulated,
but is taken to be the analytic parabolic Poiseuille solution to the Navier-Stokes
equations .
The micro-organisms are treated as point particles evolved by means of a Lagrangian solver. The fluid velocities and the components of the velocity gradient
tensor are interpolated from the Eulerian grid onto the particle positions using a
tri-linear interpolation. The time advancement of the particle uses the same RungeKutta algorithm as the time-advancement of the fluid except for the noise which
is integrated by an Euler-Marayuma method [42]. Equation (2.5) of the main text
is solved using quaternions rather than angles [43]. We perform numerical simulations of turbulent plane Poiseuille flow at constant mass flux. The Reynolds number,
domain size and resolution used for the results presented here are reported in table 3. Note that resolution and box size are chosen following the classic results for
turbulent channel flow in [44; 45].
In the table, we report both the large-scale Reynolds number defined by Re =
Uc H/ν where Uc is the centerline streamwise velocity for the laminar flow of
same mass flux, and the turbulent Reynolds number Reτ = uτ H/ν. The latter
√
is defined by the friction velocity uτ = σw and the half-channel width, where
σw ≡ ν[∂U/∂y]wall is the shear stress at the wall [27].

Note that the simulation domain is shorter than the distance travelled by the
swimmers during dispersion; also, for large times, the area occupied by the cells
becomes longer than our computational box. However, the computational domain
can be considered long enough for the velocity correlation to be negligible at a
distance of the order of the box length Lx . Therefore, a very long domain for the
swimmers can be assembled by means of copies of a single Eulerian computational
box of length Lx by using the method of repeated domains described in [10].
S2. Evalutation of the analytical dispersion measures
To evaluate the integrals in (2.20) and (2.22), it was simpler to numerically
evaluate an equivalent system of steady differential equations (e.g. use the numerical
solution to dY00 /dy = β(q y /Dyy )Y00 , instead of (2.21)). The system of ODEs was
solved using the Matlab bvp4c routine. Solutions to the system were found for using
both the Fokker-Planck and GTD expressions given in Appendix A. For comparison
with the analytical predictions, concentration profiles from DNS were normalised
by dividing by the area under the profile (the number of cells), evaluated using the
Matlab trapz routine.

The pre factors are different, but both exponents are compatible, as predicted by Bees &

at long times, as it does for passive tracers [8].
