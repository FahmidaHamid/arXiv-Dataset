Animal cells can sense chemical gradients without moving, and are faced with the challenge
of migrating towards a target despite noisy information on the target position. Here we discuss
optimal search strategies for a chaser that moves by switching between two phases of motion (run
and tumble), reorienting itself towards the target during tumble phases, and performing a persistent
random walk during run phases. We show that the chaser average run time can be adjusted to
minimize the target catching time or the spatial dispersion of the chasers. We obtain analytical
results for the catching time and for the spatial dispersion in the limits of small and large ratios of
run time to tumble time, and scaling laws for the optimal run times. Our findings have implications
for optimal chemotactic strategies in animal cell migration.

Eukaryotic cells migration does not always occur continuously: bimodal motions with reorientation phases
where cells loose their polarity and phases of polarized,
persistent motion have been reported in unicellular organisms [1], in cell migration occurring during development in the Zebrafish and Xenopus embryo [2‚Äì5], or in
mammalian cells [6]. These two phases of motions have
been denominated runs and tumbles [2] in analogy with
E. Coli motion, although the corresponding migration
mechanisms and chemical sensing of animal cells are very
different to the ones employed by bacteria. Possibly, cellular run and tumble behavior reflects the necessity for
the cell to retract motile protrusions before forming new
ones [2]: in that case, the run time is associated to the
protrusion lifetime (cf. Fig 1A).
Primordial germ (PG) cells in the Zebrafish embryo
in particular have been reported to switch between two
behavioural modes denoted ‚Äúrun‚Äù and ‚Äútumbles‚Äù [2]. In
addition, PG cells move collectively in response to the
chemokine SDF-1a towards the gonad during the first 24
hours of development [2]. In contrast to bacteria, after a
tumble phase, PG cells choose a direction biased towards
their target : animal cells are indeed capable of migration towards a source through sensing of chemical gradients [7, 8], allowing them to bias their motion towards a
chemical source [9, 10] without the need to sample the
chemoattractant at different spatial positions.
PG cells therefore display intermittent, directed migration towards a target. We investigate here the chemotactic efficiency of this class of motion with a minimal model.
We ask in particular (i) how does the time necessary to
find the target depend on the properties of the cell motion, and (ii), how does the spatial dispersion of a group
of cells evolve in time. Both questions are relevant for
biological processes, where cells have to move to specific
locations and maintain their cohesion [11].
In random search processes, a chaser without information on the target location performs a random walk
until hitting the target by chance [12, 13]. In this context, the persistence length of a particle performing a

random search can be optimised to minimise the search
time [14]. In this work, we consider instead the optimal
moving strategy for another class of motion, directed random search, where the chaser has noisy information on
the location of the target, and needs to slow down to
reorient. More specifically, we consider an intermittent
moving chaser which stops for a finite time to reorient
towards its target (e.g. due to chemotaxis), with some
detection error. This simple model accounts for the general situation where the reorientation of the chasing agent
takes time, either due to physical constraints or to a finite
detection time.
The main question is: how often should such a particle
stop and reorient to efficiently move towards the target?
Intuitively, short runs have the advantage of frequent reorientation towards the target, but at the cost of frequent
stopping, while long runs may significantly deviate the
particle from the location of the target, due to initial orientation errors and possible motion of the target. We
show here that this results in an optimal run time which
depends on the size and distance of the target and on
the orientation errors that the chaser makes. Similarly,
the effective diffusion of a collection of chasers can also
be optimized, which might be essential for collective cell
migration towards a common target.
We consider point-like agents (chasers) moving in two
dimensions towards a disc-shaped target with radius S
located at position xT (Fig. 1). The chaser position is
denoted xC and its direction of motion is given by the
heading angle œï. The chasing agent switches between a
run and a tumbling state. The tumbling phase lasts for
a time tt during which the chaser does not move, after
which the agent picks a direction uC towards the target,
with an additional angular ‚Äúdetection‚Äù error Œ∑ (Fig. 1).
The initial polar angle of the chaser at the start of the
run phase then reads
œïi = arg(xT ‚àí xC ) + Œ∑.

might depend on the distance to the target d, for instance
due to the spatial variation of the chemoattractant. In
this letter, we focus mainly on the simplest case of a
constant , and relax this assumption at the end of the
letter. During the run phase lasting for a time tr , the
particle is not able to further bias its motion towards the
target, and moves with a constant speed vC and heading
angle dynamics œïÃá = Œ∑C (t), with Œ∑C (t) a Gaussian white
noise with variance Dœï . For Dœï = 0 the chaser moves
on a straight line in the direction initially chosen œï = œïi ,
whereas for Dœï > 0 it performs a persistent random walk.
We assume here random switching between the run
and reorientation phases to be given by a dichotomous
Markov process. The durations of the different phases,
tr and tt , are exponentially distributed with an average
run time œÑr and an average stopping time œÑt .
To gain insight in the dynamics of the chasing motion,
we performed simulations of the motion of a collection
of chasers (Fig. 1). At time t = 0 the chaser particles
are placed at an angle Œ∏0 and distance d0 from the target
placed at the origin, xT = 0. Each chaser starts with a
run with initial heading given by Eq. 1. Timescales are
set by the tumbling time œÑt , velocities are normalized by
the chaser velocity vC and distances by vC œÑt .
To characterize the motion of chasers, we numerically
evaluate the average catching time Tc and the spatial dis-

persion in chaser positions, œÉ 2 (t) = h(xC (t))2 i‚àíhxC (t)i2 .
The dispersion exhibits different regimes over time (Fig.
1, [15]): an initial diffusive spread, where œÉ 2 (t) increases
roughly linearly, is followed by a transition to a stationary state, where œÉ 2 (t) assumes a constant value.
We then evaluated the average catching time Tc , the
2
maximum dispersion during the catching process œÉmax
,
2
and the initial effective diffusion Deff = œÉmax /tmax with
tmax being the time of maximum dispersion. When varying the ratio of run to tumble time œÑr /œÑt , we observe that
2
Tc is minimal for an optimal value of œÑr /œÑt (Fig. 2). œÉmax
also exhibits a minimum for zero or a finite value of the
run time œÑr . This behavior can be understood intuitively
as follows: for short run times œÑr , the chaser reorients frequently, allowing it to follow accurately the target; the
frequent reorientations however slow the chaser down.
For long run times on the other end, the chaser has a
high probability to miss the target due to orientation
errors, leading to large displacements away from the target. When varying the rotational diffusion of the chaser
Dœï , we find that for œÑr > 1/Dœï the chaser ‚Äúforgets‚Äù its
initial direction during each run and the catching time
sharply increases, while for short run times the catching time and chaser dispersion are unchanged (Fig. 2).
Because rotational diffusion then essentially introduces a
maximum value of œÑr above which the catching process
becomes undirected, we focus on the limit Dœï ‚Üí 0 in the
following.

To understand the origin of the optimal behavior, we
note that two regimes emerge from the analysis of numerical simulations depending on the ratio between the
average run length and the distance to the target (Fig.
3). For vc œÑr  |xC | (large distances and short runs),
the chasing motion is dominated by a slow effective drift
towards the target. For vc œÑr & |xC | (small distances and
large runs), the chasers approach the vicinity of the target and the catching process is primarily dominated by
the probability of hitting the target within a single run.
The total catching time is then the sum of the time to
approach the target (first regime), and the time to catch
it (second regime). A visualization of the catching process for different average run times is provided in the
Supplementary Material [15].
Based on these observations, we start by considering
the limit of short runs with chasers positioned far from
the target with the initial distance d0  S. We assume
here, without loss of generality due to rotational symmetry, that the chaser initial position is along the x axis,
xc (t = 0) = ‚àíd0 ex . The chaser then follows a nearly
one-dimensional motion along the x-direction, such that
the desired chaser heading angle is small (œï ‚âà 0). The
system can be described in terms of the spatial probability density functions (PDFs) for chaser particles in the
run and tumble phase pr (x, œï) and pt (x) [16], where the
probability distribution is conditioned to the initial position and angle (x0 , œï0 ). The general evolution equations
for the PDFs in the frame of the target read

For  = 0, Deff = (œÑrC+œÑrt )t3 : in that limit, the diffusion is
only due to the stochasticity in run and tumble times, and
for large run time the diffusion constant decreases with
œÑr , since each additional run introduces dispersion by
generating different run lengths between different chasers
(a zero run time also minimizes the diffusion, but the
catching time then diverges). For  6= 0, there is an optimal run time minimizing the diffusion coefficient, given
for  ‚Üí 0 by œÑr /œÑt = 1/: large runs indeed increase dispersion, because they tend to amplify initial errors in the
heading angle.

which agrees with numerical simulations (Fig. S1).
Therefore, in the limit of small runs, increasing the run
time is always favorable.
We now discuss the opposite limit when the target is
sufficiently close to the chaser to be reached within a single run (Fig. 3B). We assume that the probability distribution of the chaser position at tumble, pt , has relaxed
to a steady state. The steady-state distribution is then
isotropic. At lowest order in the orientation error , the
chaser-target distance R = |xc | is distributed according
R
to an exponential distribution, pt (R) = œÑr1vc e‚àí œÑr vc , with
the corresponding standard deviation of chaser position
œÉstat = œÑr vc . To evaluate the catching time, we note that

Therefore, in the limit of large runs, decreasing the run
time is favorable, an opposite behavior to the short run
time limit discussed before.
The total time to reach the target, Tc , is the sum of
the time required to approach the target (Eq. 6) and the
(1)
(2)
time to catch it in its vicinity (Eq. 9), Tc = Tc + Tc .

The resulting analytic prediction accounts very well for
the catching time obtained by simulations (Fig. 4a). To
estimate the optimal run time, we look for the minimum
of the total catching time Tc . We find that for intermediate orientation error ‚àödvS œÑ    1, the optimal run

The condition can be rewritten as an optimal run length
1
œÑr‚àó vC ‚àº (dSœÑt vc /) 3 , scaling with the geometric mean of
the three lengths of the problem. The predicted scaling
is verified by numerical simulations (Fig. 4c-f). The
intermittent directed chaser has an optimal run length
strikingly different from the optimal persistence length of
a random searcher, which was found to be of the order of
the system size [14]. It further implies that performing
short length runs is better for small target sizes, when
the distance to the target is close, and for short tumbles.
The optimal run length is also crucially dependent on
the orientation error: quite naturally, smaller orientation
errors allow to perform larger runs.
In the minimal model discussed so far, we have assumed that the reorientation error  is independent of
the distance to the target d(t) = |xc (t)|. For directional
sensing however, the detection accuracy of the target direction is likely to decrease with d(t). To account for this,
we numerically investigated an extension of our model
by assuming that an arbitrary error function (d) can
be approximated by a linear function (d) ‚âà 0 + 1 d
with 1 > 0. Simulations results for a finite 1 show the
same qualitative behavior as the minimal model (Fig.
5): an optimal run time minimizing the catching time
still exists. When increasing 1 , the optimal run time
minimizing the dispersion moves towards zero, similar to
increasing the overall constant error  (Fig. 2b).
We have also considered the situation where the target
moves balistically with a finite, but small, speed vT < vC ,
and found that the same qualitative findings hold [15].
A crucial difference for a finite target speed vT is the
existence of a regime where the catching time Tc diverges,

5
occurring above a threshold detection error  or for short
run time œÑr [15].
The robustness of our qualitative results to these modifications suggests that the minimal model introduced
here exhibits physical properties which will be preserved
for more realistic description of cells moving with intermittent motion. Developmental processes require cell migration occurring at the scale of the organism [18]: it
would be interesting to experimentally test whether migrating cells operate near the optimum value predicted
by Eq. 10 in this context. Recently, Minina et al. [3]
have analyzed in detail guided migration of progenitor
cell in vivo. Based on their experimental results they suggest that progenitor cells might adaptively decrease their
run length by downregulating receptor signaling close to
the source of the relevant chemokine. A disruption of
this control mechanism for run length was shown to hinder precise arrival of cells at the target. These empirical
findings are confirmed by our theoretical work, in particular by the predicted decrease in optimal run length with
decreasing distance to the target (Fig. 4f). This indeed
suggests that PG cells have evolved complex chemotactic
strategies for precise spatial and temporal arrival at target sites, to ensure successful development of the embryo.
We expect that further research combining new quantitative experiments and more elaborate theoretical models
will provide important insights into the mechanism and
function of directed cell migration in living systems.
From a more general point of view with respect to theory of search processes, our simple but generic model can
be viewed as an investigation of optimal directed search,
which is fundamentally different from the random search
processes predominantly studied up to date.
