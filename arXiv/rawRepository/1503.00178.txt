Environment Assisted Quantum Transport in Organic Molecules

One of the new discoveries in quantum biology is the role of Environment Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT) in excitonic
transport processes. In disordered quantum systems transport is most efficient when the environment just destroys quantum
interferences responsible for localization, but the coupling does not drive the system to fully classical thermal diffusion yet. This
poised realm between the pure quantum and the semi-classical domains has not been considered in other biological transport
processes, such as charge transport through organic molecules. Binding in receptor-ligand complexes is assumed to be static as
electrons are assumed to be not able to cross the ligand molecule. We show that ENAQT makes cross ligand transport possible
and efficient between certain atoms opening the way for the reorganization of the charge distribution on the receptor when the
ligand molecule docks. This new effect can potentially change our understanding how receptors work. We demonstrate room
temperature ENAQT on the caffeine molecule.

Introduction

There is overwhelming evidence that quantum coherence
plays an essential role in exciton transport in photosynthesis 1–4 . One of the fundamental quantum effects there is the
Environmentally Assisted Quantum Transport 5–7 (ENAQT).
It applies to partially coherent quantum transport in disordered
systems. At low temperatures transport is dominated by quantum walk of excitons over the excitable sites forming a network. While a √
classical walker diffuses away from its initial
position like ∼ t in time via taking random turns, a quantum
walker takes a quantum superposition of amplitudes of alternative paths. In a strongly disordered system the interference
is destructive and the walker becomes stuck or ’localized’ 8 .
At medium temperatures coupling to the environment partially
destroys quantum interference and the walker is free to move
and diffuse. Then at very high temperatures decoherence becomes very distractive and the exciton gets frozen due to the
Zeno effect 6 . As a result, transport is most efficient at medium
temperatures or at medium level of decoherence and much less
efficient at low or high temperatures. Transport efficiency is
the highest and mean transport time is the shortest at medium
temperatures. In photosynthetic systems parameters are such
that this optimum is near room temperature (290K).
The conditions for ENAQT look quite generic and one can
suspect that it can occur in a wide range quantum processes
in biology. Yet, the presence of ENAQT has only been established in the exciton transport of light harvesting systems. In
this paper we demonstrate that – indeed – ENAQT can play
a major role in electron transport through organic molecules
at ambient temperatures. Accordingly in certain cases our understanding of charge transport in biology needs revision.

Fig. 1 Caffeine electronic energy level spacings En+1 − En as a
function of the energy En are indicated by red circles and connected
with green line on a semi-logarithmic plot. Horizontal lines
represent the mean level spacing at ∆ = 1.4eV and the room
temperature at kB T = 0.025eV . Energies are in the
−35.3907eV — +57.7272eV range, the HOMO is at
EHOMO = −11.907eV and the LUMO is at ELUMO = −8.6776eV .
Calculation of N = 66 electronic levels has been carried out with the
Extended Hückel method.

Charge transport in biological molecules has been studied
extensively with a wide range of quantum chemical methods 9 . These methods cover fully quantum, mixed quantumclassical, semi-classical, and fully classical approaches. However, none of these cover the parameter range of the validity of ENAQT. In general, electronic levels are broadened due
to the coupling to the environment. The width of the levels
Γ is proportional to the level of decoherence, which is then
ultimately determined by the temperature of the environment
Γ ∼ kB T . Quantum description is relevant, when the broadening is much smaller than the spacing between the consecutive energy levels En+1 − En  Γ and the mean level spac1–6 | 1

ing ∆ = hEn+1 − En i is much greater than the temperature
∆  kB T . The semiclassical and classical or mixed description is relevant in the opposite limit, when ∆  kB T and many
energy levels are involved in the process. The most efficient
ENAQT sets in when the environmental temperature is comparable with the main level spacing ∆ ≈ kB T or at least the
level broadening is comparable 10 with the spacings of some
levels En+1 − En ≈ Γ ∼ kB T . In small and medium sized
(less than 500 Da) organic molecules the mean level spacing of electronic levels is on the electron volt scale, wich is
about two orders of magnitude larger than the room temperature (about 25 milli-electron volts). So, at first sight we
would expect that EQNAT is relevant only at temperatures
T = 1eV /kB ≈ 12000K, which is twice of the temperature of
the surface of Sun. However, there is a second possibility:
In Fig. 1 we show the nearest neighbor spacings of the energy levels of caffeine. The mean level spacing is ∆ = 1.4eV ,
which is much larger than the energy scale of the decoherence
kB T = 0.025eV . However, there are several level spacings in
the spectrum, which are close to 0.025eV indicating that while
global ENAQT extending for the entire molecule is not possible, there might be local pockets on the molecule, where it
plays an important role. Next we continue with showing just
that.

Transport in ligand-receptor complexes

One of the most significant building blocks of biochemical
processes in the cell is the docking of signaling molecules
in receptors. A typical situation is shown in Fig. 2, where
adenosine is docked in the A2A adenosine receptor. Besides
hydrophobic interactions binding the ligand molecule to the
receptor electrostatically, there are also hydrogen bonds connecting the two systems. The hydrogen bridge makes possible the exchange of electrons between the two systems. The
receptor consists of amino acids and these can have very different charging situations. Arginine, histidine and lysine have
positive side chains while glutamic acid and asparatic acid has
negative side chains. The rest of the amino acids is neutral
or hydrophobic. An electron from a negatively charged part
of the receptor protein can jump via the hydrogen bridge to
the neighboring atom of the ligand molecule. If the ligand
molecule would be a good conductor the electron could walk
trough the molecule and reach a positively charged part of
the receptor trough and other hydrogen bridge. The ligand
molecule would act as a molecular wire, a lightning rod. As
a result, the charge distribution on the receptor protein would
change suddenly upon the docking of the ligand molecule and
could spark sudden motion of the parts of the protein, due
to the change of the equilibrium of the electrostatic forces.
Our understanding before ENAQT ruled out such transport
of electrons through the ligand molecule. Quantum calcula2|

tions show that, unless tunneling plays a role in some special
cases, ligand molecules act as insulators. Next, we show that
ENAQT changes this picture and provides a mechanism for
the easy and effective transport of electrons between certain
atoms in the ligand molecule.

Transport model

We can develop a model for the description of the electron
transfer process of the previous section. For the description of
the molecule only the n electrons in the N atomic orbitals are
considered. The molecular orbitals ψ j are linear combinations
of the atomic orbitals
N

ψ j = ∑ C jr ϕr

and

j, r = 1, ..., N,

(1)

i=1

where ϕr are the valence atomic orbitals 2S, 2Px , 2Py and 2Pz
for carbon atoms and hetero atoms and 1S for hydrogen atoms.
The molecular orbitals can be determined from the overlap
matrix Srs = hϕr | ϕs i and Hamiltonian Hrs = hϕr | He f f | ϕs i
matrices via the generalized eigenequation
HC = ESC,

(2)

where H, S and C are square matrices containing the elements
of Hrs , Srs and C jr respectively. The raw molecular orbitals
can be orthonormalized via the Löwdin transformation 15 . The

coefficients in the Löwdin basis can be introduced via C =
S−1/2 C0 and the transformed Hamiltonian H0 = S−1/2 HS−1/2
satisfies the eigenequation
H0 C0 = EC0 ,

(3)

where the eigenenergies E remain unchanged. Next, we will
drop the prime signs and use this basis as default.
We assume that the electron is coming trough the H-bridge
or via other mechanisms and initially enters one of the atomic
orbits of the molecule. Initially the n electrons are placed in
pairs on the lowest molecular orbits with opposite spins and
occupy about the half of the orbitals. The incoming electron occupies one of the atomic orbitals. In a pure quantum description the initial wave function is a n + 1 dimensional Slater determinant of the n molecular orbitals and the
single initial electron on the atomic orbital with wave function Ψ(t = 0). This wave function is localized on the atomic
orbital and it is proportional with the initial atomic orbital
Ψ(0) = αϕI , where α is a normalization constant. The initial atomic orbital canbe expanded in terms of all molecular
orbitals ϕI = ∑ j C−1 I j ψ j , where C−1 is the inverse of the
coefficient matrix. The function ϕI is not orthogonal to the
n occupied molecular orbitals and only the expansion coefficients corresponding to unoccupied molecular orbitals will
contribute to the norm of the n + 1 electron wave function. We
can split Ψ into two orthogonal parts
Ψ = Ψo + Ψu ,

The time evolution is then a Slater determinant again, composed of e−iE j t/h̄ ψ j for the occupied orbitals and Ψ(t).
The reduced density matrix of this wave function contains
the occupied states and the unoccupied part Ψu . In atomic
orbital basis
ρ =| Ψu ih Ψu | + ∑ | ψ j ih ψ j | .
j

This is a very useful expression from the point of view of generalization. The first term represents the evolution of the incoming electron and the second term represents the rest of the
electrons frozen in the Fermi sea. The incoming electron eventually leaves the system. Just like in case of light harvesting
systems this can be modeled by adding an imaginary sink term
to the Hamiltonian
H0 = H − iκ | ϕF ih ϕF |,
where κ is the rate of the leaking out of the electron via a
H-bond coupled to one of the final atomic orbital ϕF . Once
the excess electron is leaked out the reduced density matrix
reduces to the frozen Fermi sea contribution
ρ = ∑ | ψ j ih ψ j | .
j

In our non-interacting electron approximation the leaking
out of the electron is fully described by the non-unitary
Schrödinger equation

where Ψo is spanned over the occupied and Ψu over the unoccupied orbitals of the molecule wit n electrons. The normalization condition of the Slater determinant then involves the
unoccupied part only | Ψu |2 = 1, which yields the following
normalization condition

involving now the anti-Hermitian part −ih̄κ | ϕF ih ϕF | describing leaking. The density matrix corresponding to the
wave function can be groupped into four sectors

Consequently the norm

of density matrix is described by the von Neumann equation

is larger than unity. This reflects the fact that in this description the incoming electron creates both electronic states in the
unoccupied sector and hole states in the occupied sector.
The time evolution in this model is very simple. The molecular orbitals are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian and remain
unchanged except the stationary phase factors e−iE j t/h̄ . The
time evolution of the incoming electron is governed by the
Schrödinger equation

where H1 = h̄κ | ϕF ih ϕF | is the leaking term and {, } denotes
the anti-commutator.
We can now take into account the effect of coupling of
the electrons to the environment. This can come from many
factors including the phonon vibrations of the molecule and
also very crude interactions with water molecules and other
sources of fluctuating electrostatic forces in the complicated
biological environment of a cell. Since all the sources of
phase breaking and dissipation cannot be accounted for we
can treat the system statistically and use the phenomenological

The most general Lindblad operator 16 in our case can be written in terms of the projection operators of atomic orbitals
Ar =| ϕr ih ϕr | as
L = ∑ Lrs (2Ar ρAs − As Ar ρ − ρAs Ar ) ,
rs

where Lrs is a positive definite covariance matrix of the noise
at different atomic sites. We can get Lrs from detailed models.
The crudest approximation is when we assume a completely
uncorrelated external noise and set Lrs = Γh̄ δrs , where Γ is the
strength of the decoherence. Its detailed form is model dependent, but it is in the order of thermal energy and without a
detailed knowledge of the system can be set to Γ = kB T 17 .
Now the steps of the full calculations can be summarized
like this. First we identify the initial I and final F atomic
orbitals, where the electron enters and exits the system. We
initialize the density matrix with the initial wave function ρ =
α 2 | ψI ih ψI |. The trace of this density matrix is Trρ = α 2
and contains both occupied and unoccupied states. We evolve
this density matrix according to (8). The physically relevant
reduced density matrix is given by ρ (u,u) the projection of the
density matrix for the unoccupied sector and we use this for
the calculation of physical quantities.

The average transit time can be calculated from the evolution of the reduced density matrix. The outflowing probability
current at the exit site F at time t is given by dP(t) = JF (t)dt =
2dtκ hϕF | ρ(t) | ϕF i and the average transit time is the average

Transit time between atoms

The next step is to calculate physical quantities characterizing
the electron transport between various atoms. In our model
we have to characterize the event of a single electron passing
trough the system. Once the electron enters the system it can
leave the system only trough the exit. Unless some symmetry
consideration forbids it the electron will leave the system with
probability 1, so we have to find another characteristics. The
next quantity is the average time τ an electron needs to get
from the entrance to the exit. This depends on two factors in
our model: the details of the molecule and the value of κ. It
is hard to set the value of κ without detailed models or measurements of the system, therefore we have to find its value
from other considerations. Since the typical energy range in
the system is the mean level spacing we can expect that the
rate of leaking is in the order of the time κ ∼ ∆/h̄. Once the
scale of the escape rate is set we determine the average time
needed from an initial atom to reach the destination τFI and
also the time an electron would need to leave the system if it
would be placed immediately to the final site τFF . The difference τFI − τFF is a better characteristics of the transport as
the pure pure pumping time is transformed out and mainly the
inter-atomic travel time enters.

Caffeine

In order to show ENAQT in organic molecules we should pick
a biologically relevant example which is also computationally
feasible. Our choice is caffeine as it is a sufficiently small
molecule with 24 atoms (see in Table 1). Using the Extended
Hückel method 18 implemented in the YAeHMOP 19 software
package. There are N = 66 valence atomic orbitals. The computational task involves the repeated calculation of the inverse
of R, which is an (N × N) × (N × N) = N 2 × N 2 matrix, or
4356 × 4356 in case of caffeine. The rapid growth of the computation time with N 2 is the strongest numerical limitation in
the problem. In the calculation the escape rate κ = h̄/1eV has
been used. There are 2145 possible pairs of initial and final
atomic orbitals. In Figure 3 we collected the most interesting
results. These are the transit times of electrons ending on the
2S orbital of oxygen no. 6 in Table 1. The blue curve shows
the transit time between this orbital and itself. This is the minimum time τFF needed for an electron to leak out from this site.
This value is constant for low dephasing and starts increasing

in the classical limit of large dephasing. The green curves
show the leaking time from the same atom but the electron is
initially placed on the three 2P orbitals of the atom. In this
case we can observe a shallow minimum in the Γ = 1 − 10eV
range. The black curves represent the transitions between all
the atomic orbitals and the 2S orbital of oxygen no. 6, except
2S of oxygen no. 11, which is shown in red. The black and the
green curves show the sign of ENAQT and are large both for
small and large Γ with a minimum in the middle. The minimum corresponds again to about 1 − 10eV in accordance with
the expectation based on the mean level spacing 1.4eV , which
is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than room temperature. The
red curve also has a minimum in this range. However, a second shallow minimum is also developed around 0.01eV and at
room temperature 0.025eV the transition time is still close to
this minimum. This second optimum of ENAQT signals fast
transport between the 2S orbits of the two oxygen atoms.
The transition time between the two oxygen atoms is just
10 times as large as the minimum leaking time set by the
scale of κ. This should be contrasted with the quantum limit,
where the transition times are 1000 to 100000 times larger
than the minimum leaking time. A pure quantum calculation
would find the caffeine molecule strongly insulating between
the atoms and electron transport would be practically impos-

Conclusions

We investigated the possibility of ENAQT in organic
molecules at room temperature. We worked out a framework which makes it possible to treat this problem in first approximation. We showed that global ENAQT is not present
in these molecules in general as the optimal temperature is
several orders of magnitude higher than the room temperature. However, room temperature ENAQT can be observed
in the electron transport between certain atoms in the caffeine
molecule. This indicates that in ligand-receptor systems the
ligand molecule can act as a molecular wire connecting differently charged areas of the receptor protein and can contribute
to their response for the docking. This can have a significant importance in understanding signaling and drug action
in cells.
