Synopsis
Superoxide reductases (SORs) are superoxide (O2•-)-detoxifying enzymes that catalyse
the reduction of O2•- into hydrogen peroxide. Three different classes of SOR have been
reported on the basis of the presence or not of an additional N-terminal domain. They all share
a similar active site, with an unusual non-heme Fe atom coordinated by four equatorial
histidines and one axial cysteine residues. Crucial catalytic reaction intermediates of SOR are
purported to be Fe3+-(hydro)peroxo species. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy, we
compared the vibrational properties of the Fe3+ active site of two different classes of SOR,
from Desulfoarculus baarsii and Treponema pallidum, along with their ferrocyanide and their
peroxo complexes. In both species, rapid treatment with H2O2 results in the stabilization of a
side-on high spin Fe3+-(η2-OO) peroxo species. Comparison of these two peroxo species
reveals significant differences in vibrational frequencies and bond strengths of the Fe-O2
(weaker) and O-O (stronger) bonds for the T. pallidum enzyme. Thus, the two peroxo adducts
in these two SORs have different stabilities which are also seen to be correlated with
differences in the Fe-S coordination strengths as gauged by the Fe-S vibrational frequencies.
This was interpreted from structural variations in the two active sites, resulting in differences
in the electron donating properties of the trans cysteine ligand. Our results suggest that the
structural differences observed in the active site of different classes of SORs should be a
determining factor for the rate of release of the iron-peroxo intermediate during enzymatic
turnover.

INTRODUCTION
Superoxide reductase (SOR1), a small metalloprotein of ca. 14 kDa, is a newly discovered
antioxidant enzyme which catalyses the one-electron reduction of superoxide anion (O2•-) to
form hydrogen peroxide H2O2 [1-3]:
O2•- + 1e- + 2H+ → H2O2
SOR proteins have been found in several air-sensitive bacteria [2,4,5] and archaea
[1,6] and their activity is thought to play a fundamental role for these anaerobic organisms in
the defence against oxidative and superoxide stress or exposure to adventitious molecular
oxygen [7,8].
The active site of SOR consists of a non-heme Fe2+ centre (named Centre II in those
2Fe-containing SORs) in an unusual [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal pentacoordination
[2,9,10]. In the reduced state, the sixth, axial coordinating site of the iron is vacant, and
suggests the most obvious site for initial binding of the superoxide substrate [9,12]. SOR
reacts specifically at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate with O2•-, generating H2O2 and the
oxidized Fe3+ active site [2]. In the oxidized state, the active site Fe3+ centre becomes
hexacoordinated, with its sixth coordination site occupied by a conserved glutamic acid
residue (E47 in Desulfoarculus baarsii) [12-14]. The electrons involved in the reaction can
be provided to the oxidized active site by rubredoxin [1,15] or by NAD(P)H dependent
cellular reductases in the absence of rubredoxin [2].
Three classes of SORs have been described so far, all of which display a similar
active site. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans [16], Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough [17] and
Desulfoarculus baarsii [2] SORs are representatives of Class I, in which the catalytic domain
is linked to a small N-terminal domain structurally similar to desulforedoxin and containing
an additional iron centre, named Centre I [9]. The mononuclear Fe3+ of Centre I is ligated
with four cysteines in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement, of rubredoxin-type. SORs of Class
II, such as Pyrococcus furiosus SOR [1], are characterized by the absence of the additional
4

N-terminal domain [12]. In Class III as represented by the Treponema pallidum SOR [4,5],
this domain is present but is incapable of binding the second Fe atom and therefore Centre I
is absent. In fact, when present, a functional role of Centre I has not been established
[2,4,10,11].
Pulse radiolysis studies on SORs have shed light on their enzyme mechanism [19-24].
It is now generally agreed that the reaction of O2•- with the reduced iron Centre II proceeds
through an inner-sphere mechanism. The first step of the reaction consists of a bi-molecular
reaction of SOR with O2•- in a nearly diffusion-controlled process (109 M-1 s-1), to form a first
reaction intermediate. The subsequent step was clearly identified as a protonation process
[23,24], leading to the formation of a second reaction intermediate [24], before the formation
of the final products of the reaction, H2O2 and the oxidized iron Centre II. However, this last
step of the reaction mechanism is not kinetically characterized yet [20,21,24]. Other groups
propose that the first intermediate leads directly to the final product of the reaction, without
formation of a second intermediate [19,22,23]. In all cases, the last step of the reaction might
proceed with the intervention of the conserved glutamate residue, which becomes the sixth
ligand of the Fe3+ ion in the oxidized Centre II [12,14,23,24].
The exact chemical nature of these intermediates observed in pulse radiolysis, which
may be formulated as Fe2+-superoxo, Fe3+-peroxo, or Fe3+-hydroperoxo, is yet to be firmly
established. We have recently identified by resonance Raman spectroscopy a transient highspin “side-on” Fe3+-peroxo species (Fe3+-(η2-OO)) which could be trapped in the SOR active
site of Desulfoarculus baarsii both in the WT and in the E47A mutant where the conserved
Glu 47 residue has been replaced with alanine [25]. This was possible by rapidly mixing and
freezing a solution of resting ferrous SOR with a slight excess of H2O2. These data showed
that this SOR active site can readily accommodate a Fe3+-peroxo species with a “side-on”
configuration. In addition, this Fe3+-(η2-OO) species was sizeably stabilized in the mutant

5

E47A [25]. This is in accord with the postulated role for the E47 residue in the release of the
reaction intermediate from the SOR active site [25].
In this work, in order to determine if different classes of SORs can also accommodate a
high-spin Fe3+-(η2-OO) species, we have investigated the formation of the peroxo species in
the Class III SOR from Treponema pallidum, on the WT and E48A mutant (equivalent of the
E47A mutant in D. baarsii). Comparison of the two peroxo species between the SORs from T.
pallidum and D. baarsii indicate different stabilities of the peroxo adduct, which can be
directly related with differences in the iron-ligand coordination strengths as seen by
vibrational Raman spectroscopy.

EXPERIMENTAL

Biochemical and chemical reagents.
K3Fe(CN)6, ammonium persulphate were from Sigma. K2IrCl6 was from Strem Chemical Inc.
H216O2 (30% in water) was from Aldrich. H218O2 (2% in water with 90% 18O) was from ICON
Stable Isotopes.

Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression and purification.
Two primers were designed for PCR- based site-directed mutagenesis to create the T.
pallidum SOR mutant E48A. Primer 1 (5’GGA TGC AGC GAA GGC AAA GCA TAT CCC
CG3’) and primer 2 (5’CGG GGA TAT GCT TTG CCT TCG CTG CAT CC3’) contained the
mutation of interest (underlined). Mutagenesis was carried out on the plasmid pVN10-2 [4]
with the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The mutation was
verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid, pCMTPE48A was transformed in E. coli
DH5α. Over-expression and purification of the E48A mutant protein was carried out as
reported for the wild-type protein [4]. Purification of the wild-type and E47A proteins from
D. baarsii were performed as described in [2] and [20]. Purified protein samples, in 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.6, were concentrated using Microcon 10 microconcentrators (10 kDa cut-off
membranes). Total iron content in proteins was determined using atomic absorption
spectroscopy as described elsewhere [2]. Unless otherwise stated, proteins were oxidized
using 3 equivalents of K2IrCl6. For certain cases, 1.5 equivalents of K3Fe(CN)6 were used. In
general, the excess oxidant was removed by washing using Microcon 10 microconcentrators.
Ammonium persulphate (1 equivalent) was also used as an oxidant. For the wild-type SOR
from T. pallidum, complete reduction of the active site was achieved by adding slight excess
of sodium ascorbate (Sigma).

7

In general for the resonance Raman samples, 1 µl of concentrated protein (1-5 mM) in
100 mM of buffer was deposited on glass slide sample holder and then transferred into a cold
helium gas circulating optical cryostat (STVP-100, Janis Research) held at 15 K. For the
rapidly frozen H2O2-treated Raman samples, 5 µl of concentrated SOR (either in its Fe2+ or
Fe3+ state) protein (3-6 mM) on ice was manually mixed rapidly with an equal volume of
H2O2 solution (on ice) whose concentration was adjusted in order to obtain a final SOR
protein : H2O2 ratio of ca. 1:6 equivalents. 3-5 µL of the resulting mixture was promptly
transferred to the glass slide sample holder and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen
before transferring to the optical cryostat for Raman measurement. The entire mixing/freezing
operation took no more than ca. 3 seconds. For reaction of H2O2 with SOR in its ferric Fe3+
state, the protein was initially oxidized with 3 eq. of K2IrCl6, washed with three volumes of
buffer using membrane microconcentrators, then concentrated before mixing with 6 eq. of
H2O2. The pH of trial samples (200 µL, 100 mM buffer) were re-measured i) after H2O2
mixing and ii) after freeze/thawing and were observed to not change within ± 0.1 pH unit at
pH 7.5 and 8.5. The resonance Raman spectra of the WT and E47A mutant of D. baarsii
SOR [26] are essentially indistinguishable when reacted with H2O2 in their respective Fe2+ or
Fe3+ states (for example, see Supplemental Data, Figure S1) indicating that a similar Fe3+peroxo species is trapped. For the spectra reported in this work, the reaction of H2O2 with
SOR was done in the Fe2+ state which circumvents the additional K2IrCl6-oxidation and
subsequent washing steps.

Pulse radiolysis.
Pulse radiolysis measurements were performed as described elsewhere [20,21]. Briefly, free
radicals were generated by irradiation of O2-saturated aqueous protein solutions (100 µM), in
Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 7.6, 0.1 M sodium formate with 200 ns pulses of 4 MeV electrons at the

8

linear accelerator at the Curie Institute, Orsay, France. Superoxide anion, O2•-, was generated
during the scavenging by 100 mM formate of the radiolytically produced hydroxyl radical,
HO•, as previously described [20]. Doses of ca. 5 Gy per pulse resulted in ca. 3 µM of O2•-.
Reactions were followed spectrophotometrically, between 450 and 750 nm, at 20°C in a 2 cm
path length cuvette. Kinetic traces were analyzed using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
from the Kaleidagraph software package (Synergy Software).

Spectroscopy.
Optical absorbance measurements were made using a Varian Cary 1 Bio spectrophotometer,
in 1 cm path length cuvettes. For measurements using H2O2 as the oxidant, spectra were
rapidly

recorded,

immediately

after

addition,

using

a

multichannel

diode-array

spectrophotometer (Helwett-Packard) and the evolution of the absorption spectrum was
followed every few seconds. Low temperature 4.2 K X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a
Bruker EMX 081 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument continuous flow cold He
gas cryostat.
Resonance Raman spectra were recorded using a modified single-stage spectrometer
(Jobin-Yvon) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled back-thinned CCD detector (2000 X 800
pixels), and excitation at 647.1 nm (30 mW) was provided from a Spectra Physics Series 2000
Kr+ laser. A holographic notch filter (Kaiser Optical) was used reject stray light. Spectra
were calibrated using the exciting laser line, along with the SO42- (983 cm-1) and ice (230 cm1

) Raman bands from a frozen aqueous sodium sulphate solution. Spectral resolution was < 3

cm-1 with entrance slits at 100 µm.

Frequency accuracy was ± 1 cm-1 and frequency

repeatability was 1 pixel (resolution < 2 pixels) for the spectrograph. Reported spectra were
the result of the averaging of 40 single spectra recorded with 30 seconds of accumulation
time. The reproducibility of the reported Raman frequencies was determined to be ± 1 cm-1.
Verification of small frequency differences of 2 cm-1 of homologous bands originating from
9

two different samples was established by recording, during the same day, the two different
samples deposited the same sample holder under the same spectroscopic/geometric
conditions. Baseline corrections were performed using GRAMS 32 (Galactic Industries). In
all reported spectra, the contributions from ice have been subtracted using the GRAMS 32
software by cancellation of the 230 cm-1 band.

RESULTS

Characterization of the T. pallidum E48A mutant.
The Treponema pallidum SOR E48A mutant was purified in an homogeneous form, with an
iron content of 0.75 iron atom per polypeptide chain. The E48A mutant was isolated in a
completely reduced state, stable in the presence of air. Figure 1A shows the 400-900 nm
region of the electronic absorption spectrum of the T. pallidum E48A mutant in its ferric state
oxidized with K2IrCl6 at pH 8.5. Similar spectra have been observed when it is oxidized with
ammonium persulphate or superoxide generated with the xanthine / xanthine oxidase system
(data not shown). As described in the case of the Desulfoarculus baarsii enzyme, the
maximum of the absorption spectrum depends on the pH. Upon increasing the pH from 5 to
9.1, the absorption band of the iron center exhibits a 80 nm blue shift from 650 to 560 nm,
with a pKa value of 6.0 (Fig. 1B). This value is almost identical to that reported in the case of
the E47A mutant of D. baarsii (pKa = 6.7) [24]. On the other hand, between pH 5 and 8.5, the
spectrum of the oxidized T. pallidum wild-type SOR exhibits the same maximal absorption at
650 nm (compare Figure 1a with Supplemental Data Figure S2a). Above pH 8.5, the iron
center becomes unstable and no spectra could be collected. However, these pH-dependent
absorption data are similar to those of the wild-type SOR from D. baarsii, which exhibits the
80 nm blue-shift absorption transition at higher pH (pKa 9.0) [24].
Figure 2a shows the low temperature X-band electron paramagnetic (EPR) spectrum
of the T. pallidum E48A mutant oxidized with K2IrCl6 at pH 8.5. The major feature at ca. g =
4.3 indicates the high spin state of the ferric centre, as previously observed for all other SORs
to date [2,4,13,16,27]. There is also a small feature observable at g = 4.2 (Inset Fig. 2a). In
addition, the EPR spectrum reveals further heterogeneity in the coordination environment of
the ferric centre. The resonance at g = 8.8 arises from a rhombic species (E/D ≈ 0.15) while
the resonances at g = 7.4 and 5.7 arise from an axial species (E/D ≈ 0.05). Similar structural

11

heterogeneity and EPR resonances have been also observed for the wild-type T. pallidum and
P. furiosus SORs [13,27]. In contrast, no such iron coordination heterogeneity was observed
for wild-type D. baarsii or its E47A mutant, both of which were rhombic (E/D = 0.33) when
oxidized with K2IrCl6 or O2•- [2,20,25].
The reactivity of the T. pallidum E48A SOR with O2•- was studied by pulse radiolysis
at pH 7.6. The experimental conditions were identical to those used for the wild-type [21] and
for the D. baarsii SORs [20,24]. Like the wild-type SOR [21], the mutant reacted very rapidly
with superoxide, with a nearly diffusion-limited second-order rate constant k1 = 109M-1s-1
(Table 1), to form a first intermediate species which exhibits a maximum absorbance at ca.
600 nm (data not shown), comparable with that found for the wild-type protein [21]. This first
intermediate species decays with a rate constant k2 = 2080 s-1 (Table 1) to form a second
intermediate absorbing maximally at ca. 630 nm, similarly to that determined for the wildtype protein [21]. Finally, the last part of the reaction, the transformation of the second
intermediate to the final products, occurs after 30-50 ms of the reaction time, which could not
be observed with our instrumentation, as previously mentioned [21,24].

Resonance Raman Spectroscopy of SOR wild-type and mutated forms oxidized with
K2IrCl6
Figure 3 shows the 15 K RR spectrum of the wild-type SOR from T. pallidum oxidized with
K2IrCl6, excited using 647.1 nm radiation, in resonance with the S → Fe3+ charge transfer
band of the active site [16,28]. The active site modes thus enhanced predominantly arise from
the Fe3+-S(Cys) moiety [10,25,28].
Unlike the SOR from D. baarsii, this resonance Raman spectrum is not complicated
by the preresonance Raman contribution of Center I. Johnson and co-workers, using 34S, 15N
and 54Fe global protein isotopic labelling of SORs from P. furiosus [28] and D. vulgaris [10]

12

have shown that the low-frequency Fe-S stretching mode is kinematically coupled to several
cysteine ligand deformation modes close in energy, resulting in several mixed modes. The
low frequency region of the spectrum of the SOR from T. pallidum is dominated by bands at
304, 311, 326, and 357 cm-1. Based on the assignments made by Johnson and co-workers
[10,28], we may assign the 304, 311, and 326 cm-1 bands in Figure 3, respectively, to Fe-S
stretching and bending modes (contributions from S-Cβ-Cα bending deformations). The 357
cm-1 band can be assigned to a cysteine deformation mode containing significant C-N
character [28]. The 500-800 cm-1 region is expected to contain contributions from overtone
and combination bands, except for the 658 cm-1 band which was assigned to a fundamental
with significant cysteine C-N character [10,28]. The intense 746 cm-1 band in Figure 3b can
be assigned to a cysteine S-Cβ stretching mode [28]. The weakly enhanced bands in the 200250 cm-1 region are attributable to Fe3+-N stretching modes from the coordinating histidine
residues [10,28]. Bands are observed at 215, 232 (the residual feature in this band is due to the
subtraction of the ice band at 230 cm-1) and 255 cm-1, which agree well with those observed in
the P. furiosus spectrum which showed 15N isotopic shifts [28].
For the D. baarsii RR spectrum (Figure 3), the preresonance contributions from Center
I have been subtracted by cancellation of the 384 cm-1 band, arising uniquely from the nonactive Center I site. As with the oxidized T. pallidum RR spectrum, the difference spectrum is
also dominated by contributions from the Fe3+-S(Cys) moiety (Figure 3). By analogy to the
assignments made for the SORs from P. furiosus [28] and D. vulgaris [10], the 299/316/323
cm-1 cluster of bands in the D. baarsii spectrum may be attributed to primarily Fe-S stretching
mode and cysteine bending mode contributions. Since the 299 cm-1 band is the most intense, it
is most likely predominantly Fe3+-S stretching in character. Similarly for T. pallidum, the
relatively intense 304 cm-1 band most likely represents the mode with predominant Fe3+-S
stretching in character in the T. pallidum active site. The 357 cm-1 band can be assigned to a

13

cysteine deformation mode and involving N atoms [28]. The 742 cm-1 bands in the D. baarsii
spectrum was assigned to the S-Cβ stretching mode and is significantly lower than that
observed for T. pallidum (746 cm-1) and P. furiosus (748 cm-1) [28]. The weakly enhanced
Fe3+-N stretching mode bands [28] are seen at 216, 234 and 238 cm-1. Also, two shoulders at
277 and 289 cm-1 are visible, which corresponds to the broader unresolved shoulder at 280
cm-1 in the T. pallidum spectrum.
Figure 3 shows that the RR spectrum of the T. pallidum E48A mutant at pH 8.5 is
similar to that of wild-type. Some small changes in relative band intensities (Fig. 3) could be
attributed to differences in the electronic absorption properties (Fig. 1A). Closer inspection of
the T. pallidum wild-type and E48A spectra also indicate minor frequency shifts in the 658662/660 cm-1 bands.

These observations suggest that the ligand in the sixth position,

presumably the Glu 48, appears to act as a rather weak ligand which does not sizeably perturb
the vibrational structure of the active site.

The trapped Fe3+-peroxo species in the T. pallidum E48A SOR mutant.
Figure 4 shows the resonance Raman spectrum excited at 647.1 nm of the T. pallidum E48A
mutant at pH 8.5 treated with 6 equivalents of H2O2 then rapidly frozen (3 sec). This RR
spectrum exhibits new bands at 852 and 433 cm-1, compared with the K2IrCl6-oxidized
sample (Fig. 3), which were not observed when other oxidants were used. These frequencies
are consistent with the νO-O and νFe-O2 stretching modes, respectively, of an Fe3+-peroxo
species, as was reported for the homologous E47A mutant of SOR from D. baarsii [25].
Isotopically labelled H218O2 experiments show that these bands downshift to 802 (-50) and
413 (-20) cm-1, respectively, in agreement with the calculated isotopic shifts of -49 and –20
cm-1 for a Fe-O2 system, respectively; this close agreement indicates that these Fe-peroxo
modes are pure. D2O buffer exchange measurements were complicated by the fact that the

14

protein was not stable in such a buffer on ice. Significant loss in metal-binding and resulting
luminescence precluded the recording of good quality RR spectra. Nevertheless, such spectra
(see Supplemental Data, Fig. S3) show that the 852 cm-1 band frequency is unaffected (the
433 cm-1 band was severely distorted by the luminescence background), suggesting no
involvement of protons.
When 6 equivalents of H2O2 is rapidly mixed with wild-type SOR from T. pallidum
also at pH 8.5, the same new 852 and 433 cm-1 bands are also observed, however their
intensities relative to the 746 cm-1 band (a marker band for the active site in the high-spin Fe3+
state) [25] are much weaker compared to the E48A mutant (Fig. 5). These observations
demonstrate that the same high-spin side-on Fe3+-peroxo species could be trapped for the
wild-type, however with a much lower yield compared to total Fe3+ formed than in the E48A
mutant.
A high spin Fe3+-(η2-OO) species was also found for the WT and E47A mutant of the
SOR from D. baarsii [25]. Interestingly, the two Fe3+-(η2-OO) species of D. baarsii and T.
pallidum, are not identical (Fig. 5). The slightly higher frequency observed for the νO-O
stretching mode for T. pallidum (852 cm-1) indicates that this bond is slightly stronger than it
is for D. baarsii (850 cm-1) [25]. In addition, the lower frequency of the νFe-O2 mode (433 cm1

) indicates weaker Fe-O2 bonding for the T. pallidum SOR than for that of D. baarsii (438

cm-1). Thus, the Fe3+-(η2-OO) species appears to be a weaker adduct for the SOR of T.
pallidum than for that of D. baarsii. The small but significant vibrational differences observed
in the T. pallidum Fe3+-(η2-OO) species compared to that of D. baarsii mirrors the small
vibrational differences observed for their respective oxidized active sites (see Fig. 3).
The formation of the Fe3+-peroxo species in the E48A mutant of T. pallidum results in
Raman spectral changes for the rest of the active site, both in terms of frequency shifts and
relative intensities, and especially in the 250-400 cm-1 region which corresponds to the mixed

15

Fe-S stretching/deformation modes. The most marked shift after peroxo formation is seen
with the 304 cm-1 band which downshifts to 297 cm-1 for the peroxo species, suggesting a
concomitant weakening of the Fe-S bond. The 357 cm-1 band downshifts to 355 cm-1 and the
311 and 326 cm-1 bands slightly upshift to 313 and 328 cm-1, respectively. The 745 cm-1 band
also upshifts very slightly to 746 cm-1, suggesting a possible modest strengthening of the C-S
bond in the cysteine residue. These observations, which are not clearly observable in the WT
(Fig. 5) due to the lower yield of Fe3+-peroxo formation, show that the peroxo ligand
significantly influences the Fe-S bond in the active site, something that does not occur for the
E48A mutation by itself.
The low frequency region 200-260 cm-1 shows no significant differences from that of
the E48A mutant RR spectrum oxidized with K2IrCl6, providing no evidence for significant
changes in the Fe-His coordination of the active site after Fe3+-peroxo formation. Similar
observations were noted for the E47A mutant of D. baarsii [25].

The SOR-Ferrocyanide Complex
K3Fe(CN)6 is known to oxidize the reduced active site Fe2+ centre of SOR and to form a
complex with it [10,13,27,29]. This is not the case for other oxidants such as K2IrCl6 [13].
The SOR-ferrocyanide complex is described as one where one CN- group is coordinate with
the oxidized SOR active site,

SORFe

3+

-CN-Fe2+-(CN)5 [27,29]. The effects of this

complexation are readily observable in the RR spectrum of T. pallidum and that of D. baarsii,
both similar for wild-type and the E48A/E47A mutants. For simplicity we will restrict our
discussion to the wild-type proteins. Upon ferrocyanide complexation, the intensity in the low
frequency region is enhanced, resulting in a concomitant sharpening of the bands in the 200260 cm-1 (Fig. 6). This probably reflects the change in the electronic absorption properties of
the active site upon ferrocyanide complexation (Fig. 1, and see Supplemental Data Fig. S2)

16

[27], with the appearance of the intervalence broad absorption band at ca. 1000 nm that
changes the resonance Raman enhancement conditions with 647.1 nm excitation.
By examining the accompanying RR changes in the Fe-S and Fe-N vibrational modes,
the SOR-ferrocyanide complex serves as a sensitive probe for the active site. The effects of
ferrocyanide complexation also result in more significant perturbations of the vibrational
structure of the SOR active sites for T. pallidum and D. baarsii (Fig. 6). In general, many
bands, including those attributable to the Fe-S(Cys) stretching modes, are seen to downshift
by 1-3 cm-1. These shifts are more pronounced for D. baarsii compared to T. pallidum and
suggest a weakening of the trans Fe-S(Cys) bond for both SORs. These perturbations are also
most notably seen for the S-C stretching mode of the cysteine ligand. For the T. pallidum
SOR the 746 cm-1 band downshifts to 744 cm-1 for the SOR-ferrocyanide complex (Fig. 6).
For D. baarsii, this band is observed at 742 cm-1 and downshifts to 739 cm-1 when
ferrocyanide is complexed. The slightly greater downshift for D. baarsii (-3 cm-1) than for T.
pallidum (-2 cm-1) suggests a greater perturbation or a stronger complex formation for the
former compared to the latter.
Other perturbations are seen at the level of the Fe3+-N(His) bands. For D. baarsii,
oxidation with ferricyanide results in the upshift of the 238 cm-1 band to 252 cm-1. For T.
pallidum, the analogous band at 255 cm-1 upshifts slightly to 257 cm-1. We also observe the
downshift of another band attributable to an Fe3+-N(His) stretching mode, 234 cm-1 to 225 cm1

for D. baarsii and 232 cm-1 to 230 cm-1 for T. pallidum. Again, the ferrocyanide

complexation effects appear more pronounced for D. baarsii, implying stronger complexation
for this case. The X-ray crystal structure of the the D. baarsii SOR complexed with
ferrocyanide [29] indicated that one of the CN- groups is in strong van der Waals contact with
at least one of the coordinating His ligands.

DISCUSSION
To date, three X-ray crystallographic structures are available for superoxide reductases, two
for Class I SOR [9,29] and one for Class II SOR [12]. Although these crystal structures
indicate that the non-heme iron active site is very similar for these SORs of different classes,
they are not able to reveal subtle structural variations that might exist between one class and
another. In this work, using resonance Raman spectroscopy, we have shown that the active
sites of two SORs from different classes, i.e. D. baarsii and T. pallidum, exhibit significant
differences, which may have important mechanistic relevance.

Comparison of T. pallidum and D. baarsii active sites
Comparison of the RR spectra of the K2IrCl6 oxidized active sites of the T. pallidum and D.
baarsii SORs indicated that these two sites are not strictly identical.

These structural

differences are reflected in their respective resonance Raman spectral bands as variations in
both relative intensities and observed frequencies. Due to the extensive kinematic coupling
and mixing of the Fe3+-S(Cys) stretching and deformation modes in these SOR active sites
[10,28], even slight changes in vibrational frequencies may significantly alter the band
intensity patterns. It should be noted that with our experimental conditions, small frequency
differences up to 2 cm-1 for homologous bands on different samples are significant.
For T. pallidum, the cluster of bands (304, 311, 326 cm-1) attributable to the mixed FeS stretching and deformation modes is observed at slightly higher frequencies than that of D.
baarsii (299, 316, 323 cm-1). This suggests that the Fe-S bond is stronger for the T. pallidum
active site. Another marked difference is seen in the higher frequency band assigned to the SCβ stretching mode of the cysteine ligand which is seen at 746 cm-1 for T. pallidum and at 742
cm-1 for D. baarsii. Another interesting difference between these two SORs is seen in the
region 200-260 cm-1, which contain the contributions of Fe3+-N(His) stretching modes [28].

18

The most notable is the presence of a 255 cm-1 band in the T. pallidum spectrum which is seen
at 238 cm-1 for D. baarsii. The higher frequency seen in the T. pallidum spectrum indicates
that at least one histidine is engaged in a significantly stronger coordination with the iron
metal center, and thus a relatively shorter distance, as compared to D. baarsii.
To summarize, our data show that, compared to the active site of D. baarsii, for T.
pallidum, i) the Fe-S bond and the cysteine S-C bond are both stronger, indicating greater
electron density at these two cysteine bonds, and ii) one or two of the Fe-His bonds are
stronger.
The above structural aspects might be correlated with the EPR observations [2,13,27].
With respect to the oxidized active site, D. baarsii exhibits a homogeneous rhombic EPR
signal whereas the heterogeneous T. pallidum EPR spectrum exhibits species which are more
axial in their iron coordination. The rhombic EPR spectrum of D. baarsii (Class I) might be
related to its weaker Fe3+-S(Cys) ligation and (a) weaker Fe3+-N(His) bond(s) at the equatorial
position as compared to T. pallidum. This could be also the case for the D. desulfuricans
(another Class I) SOR which exhibits a rhombic EPR signal [16] while that for P. furiosus
(Class II) is axial [13]. In fact, the D. desulfuricans Raman spectrum [16] is more like D.
baarsii and the P. furiosus Raman spectrum [28] is more like T. pallidum, especially when
comparing of the 742-748 cm-1 band of the S-C cysteine stretching mode.
The structural origin of these observations is not clear yet. The available X-ray crystal
structures, of differing resolutions (from 1.15 to 1.9 Å) [9,12,29], do not show the subtle
differences revealed by RR spectroscopy for SOR active site in the ferric state. Even the
deemed anomalously long distances of the Fe-S bond from the crystal structure of P. furiosus
[12] might come from the incomplete Fe occupancy of the four sites in the crystal structure,
and thus might be not relevant, as was discussed by Johnson and co-workers [10,13,28]. We
propose that differences in the conformation of the conserved tetrapeptide sequence beginning

19

with the active site Fe-coordinating cystein and/or subtle variations in H-bonding at the
sulphur atom of the cysteine of these two SORs [10] could, in part, explain the differences
observed here. For example, the additional electron density on the cysteine ligand resulting in
a stronger Fe-S bond observed for the T. pallidum SOR active site could be reflecting less Hbonding and/or electrostatic interaction with the cysteine sulphur atom. The effects of protein
environment on the thiolate axial ligand electron donation and its influence on the trans ligand
properties for cytochrome P450s are well known [review 40, 41]

SORs of different classes exhibit different stabilisation for the high-spin Fe3+-(η2-OO)
species
The reaction of the SOR from T. pallidum, E48A mutant or WT forms, with slight excess of
H2O2 results in the formation of a high spin non-protonated side-on Fe3+-(η2-OO) species
which can be trapped upon rapid mixing and freezing. Thus, the active site of SOR from T.
pallidum is capable of stabilizing a Fe3+-peroxo species in a manner similar to that previously
observed for D. baarsii WT and E47A mutant SOR [25], revealing an important general
property of SORs.
When we compare the Fe3+-peroxo species in D. baarsii and T. pallidum, there are
significant differences in the observed νO-O and νFe-O2 vibrational frequencies. For T. pallidum
the former frequency is slightly higher (852 cm-1 compared to 850 cm-1 for D. baarsii) while
the latter is slightly lower (433 cm-1 compared to 438 cm-1). This implies a slightly stronger
adduct formation for D. baarsii. In addition, the difference in Fe3+-peroxo adduct strengths for
T. pallidum and D. baarsii appears to correlate with the strength of the Fe-S bond in the trans
position. For T. pallidum, where the Fe-S bond appears slightly stronger compared to D.
baarsii, the Fe3+-O bonds are weaker than those observed for D. baarsii.

20

These observations are in line with the RR data obtained for the SOR-ferrocyanide
complexes. In both proteins, binding of ferrocyanide results in a frequency decrease of the FeS stretching modes, but to a greater extent for the D. baarsii enzyme. The RR data are also in
agreement with the crystal structure of the complex, where binding of ferrocyanide results in
the S-Fe coordination being elongated by 0.3 Å [29].
The difference in bond strengths observed for the two side-on Fe3+-peroxo species
may be rationalized in terms of electron density donation from the trans cysteinate ligand
[30]. For a side-on bonding configuration, the in-plane π* orbital of the peroxide ligand
overlaps with the iron, presumably dxz, orbital as shown in Scheme 1. Any donation of
electron density to the filled π* orbital via the iron from donation from the trans cysteinate
ligand would be expected to weaken the Fe-O2 bond. In addition, decreased Fe-O2 bond
strength may be expected to increase the O-O bond strength [37]. On the basis of these bond
strength differences it appears that the peroxo species is more destabilized for T. pallidum
than in D. baarsii and should further facilitate Fe-O2 bond cleavage for this SOR, promoting
better peroxide release. These RR data highlight that the different classes of SOR, which were
initially classified based on the presence or absence of the N-terminal domain (and the
additional Centre I), can be also now defined on the basis of different electronic distribution
properties amongst the ligands of their active site, which directly affects the stability of the
Fe3+-peroxo species. This suggests that the different classes of SOR could exhibit catalytic
properties which are not identical.
However, up to now, no kinetic data are available to verify that the observed weaker
adduct formation for T. pallidum could be related to facilitating release of the Fe3+-peroxo
intermediate species to form H2O2. In fact, pulse radiolysis experiments carried out on D.
baarsii and T. pallidum did not provide any information related this last step of the reaction
mechanism, because of technical limitations at reaction times longer 20-30 ms. The data for T.

21

pallidum presented here indicate that its reaction with superoxide anion (k1) is similar to that
of D. baarsii (Table 1) and that two reaction intermediates are also formed. There is a notable
difference on the rate constant for the formation of the second intermediate (k2) at pH 7.6,
faster for T. pallidum, but this step, characterized as a protonation process, was not associated
with H2O2 release [24]. Other rapid kinetic techniques, like stopped-flow experiments, may
provide valuable information on the release of H2O2.
At present it is not known if the side-on peroxo species is an initial SOR intermediate
as seen in the pulse radiolysis experiments [21-24], given the shorter time-scales of those
experiments compared to our trapping experiments with H2O2. However, the observation of a
Fe3+-(η2-OO) peroxo species in SOR reflects important properties of the active site which
might correlate with an efficient release of H2O2. Recent theoretical calculations favour a
linear Fe3+-peroxo intermediate, with a low-spin state [34]. However, in all SORs studied so
far, the ferric state is seen to be high-spin. For Fe3+ complexes with aminopyridine ligands,
the literature reveals that side-on Fe3+-peroxo species have only been observed for high-spin
iron model complexes so far [31]. The high-spin side-on configuration favours weaker Fe-O
bonds and stronger O-O bonds compared to linear low-spin Fe3+-(η1-OO(H)) hydroperoxo
species as is revealed by the very low νFe-O2 stretching mode frequencies for side-on
configurations [31]. In terms of the function and activity of SOR, an important step is the
release of H2O2 from a transient Fe3+-peroxo intermediate without cleavage of the O-O bond.
To optimise such a reaction, the protein should accommodate a peroxo intermediate which
has a weak Fe-O bond and a strong O-O bond. The high-spin side-on peroxo configuration
meets all these requirements, better than a linear one. Indeed, linear end-on Fe3+-OO(H)
peroxo intermediates, as seen in almost all cases to be low spin Fe3+ [31], have been observed
or proposed as intermediates for catalase, cytochrome P450, NO synthase etc. These linear
peroxo intermediates would result in a relatively strong Fe-O bond and a significant

22

weakening of the O-O band, facilitating cleavage of the O-O bond to generate a highly
oxidizing intermediate (e.g. (Fe(IV)=O)) required for the oxygenation activity of these latter
two enzymes [36]. The low frequencies of the Fe-O2 vibrations seen for high spin side-on
peroxo species observed here indicate particularly weak Fe-O2 bonds which would facilitate
H2O2 release and stabilize the O-O bond against cleavage

The Glu47/48 residue as sixth ligand
According to the X-ray crystal structure of the P. furiosus SOR [12] and FTIR
spectroscopic studies on the D. baarsii and T. pallidum SORs [14], the Glu47/48 residue
appears to act as the sixth ligand of coordination to the Fe3+ in the active site after oxidation.
The resonance Raman spectra reported here using 647.1 nm excitation were not expected to
show significant enhancement of any mode(s) from a possible Glu residue since there is no
corresponding charge transfer band to exploit in this spectral region.
Our recent Mössbauer study [26] for D. baarsii indicated near 100% trapping of the
side-on peroxo species at the active site of the E47A mutant, when it is formed using the same
experimental conditions as reported here. Comparing the resonance Raman spectra, it appears
that near 100% trapping of the Fe3+-peroxo species in the E48A T. pallidum mutant was also
obtained here. Thus, in the absence of the glutamic acid residue, a metastable Fe3+-peroxo
species can be readily formed and trapped by treatment with H2O2 and rapid freezing. We
note that the same Fe3+-peroxo species could also be trapped for the corresponding WT SORs
but with a much lower yield. These observations again highlight the participation of the
conserved Glu residue in the release of peroxide in the active site, a process which would be
facilitated if the Glu residue is somehow involved, either directly or indirectly, together with
the protonation and release of the peroxo species to produce H2O2.

23

In summary, we have observed structural differences between the active sites of T.
pallidum and D. baarsii which indicate greater electron density at the cysteine ligand of T.
pallidum. This translates as observed differences of the Fe-O2 and O-O bond strengths for the
trapped high-spin side-on Fe3+-peroxo species of these two SORs which are interpreted as
resulting from differences in the electron density donating properties of the trans cysteine
ligand. The trans cysteine ligand effect is expected to play an important role in SOR activity
with respect to superoxide reduction and H2O2 release. The high-spin side-on Fe3+-peroxo
species we have characterized here reveals that SORs in general are capable of stabilizing
such species and in this light, it may be considered as a potential candidate for a subsequent
intermediate in the SOR catalytic cycle.

Figure 1. A. UV-visible absorption spectra of the SOR from T. pallidum E48A
mutant (200 µM). Proteins oxidized with (a) 3 equivalents of K2IrCl6 at pH 5.0, (b) 3
equivalents of K2IrCl6 at pH 8.5, (c) 6 equivalents H2O2 at pH 8.5 (incubation time 15 sec),
(d) 1.5 equivalents K3Fe(CN)6 pH 8.5. B. pH dependence of the absorbance at 660 nm. The
titration curve fitted the equation expected from a single protonation process, A660 = (A660max
+ A660min x10(pH-pKa))/(1+10(pH-pKa)).

Figure 2. EPR spectra of the SOR from T. pallidum E48A mutant (200µM). Proteins
oxidized with (a) 3 equivalents of

K2IrCl6 at pH 8.5, (b) 6 equivalents H2O2 pH 8.5

(incubation time 15 sec). EPR conditions: temperature, 4.2 K; microwave power 25 mW at
9.447 GHz; modulation amplitude, 20G at 100 kHz. The Inset shows a blow up of the 500600 Gauss magnetic field region.

Figure 3. Low temperature (15 K) resonance Raman spectra of SORs excited at 647.1
nm. (a) T. pallidum E48A mutant, (b) T. pallidum WT, (c) D. baarsii WT, all oxidized with 3
equivalents of K2IrCl6. (c) is the difference spectrum of oxidized-minus-untreated (reduced),
as described in the text. SOR concentration was 3 mM in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5; laser
power was 50 mW at the sample; spectral resolution was < 3 cm-1. Raman contributions of ice
were also subtracted.

Figure 4. Low temperature (15 K) resonance Raman spectra of SOR active site from T.
pallidum E48A mutant oxidized with 6 equivalents of H2O2, rapidly mixed and frozen
within 3 sec. (a) H216O2; (b) H218O2; (c) is the calculated difference of spectrum (b)-minus-

32

spectrum (a).

Bands indicated by (*) are due to added, unreacted H216/18O2. SOR

concentration was 3 mM in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Same experimental conditions as in
Figure 3.

Figure 5. A. Low temperature (15 K) resonance Raman spectra of the H2O2-oxidized
SORs. (a) T. pallidum WT (3 mM), (b) T. pallidum E48A mutant (3 mM), and (c) D. baarsii
E47A mutant (5 mM), in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, rapidly mixed with 6 equivalents of H2O2
on ice, and immediately frozen within 3 sec. (c) is the calculated oxidized-minus-reduced
spectrum of D. baarsii as described in the text. Same experimental conditions as in Figure 3.
B. Expanded view of the 700-900 cm-1 region. Bands indicated by (*) are due to added,
unreacted H2O2.

Figure 6. Low temperature (15 K) resonance Raman spectra of oxidized WT SORs. (a)
T. pallidum oxidized with 3 equivalents K2IrCl6, (b) T. pallidum oxidized with 1.5 equivalents
K3Fe(CN)6, (c) D. baarsii oxidized with 1.5 equivalents K3Fe(CN)6, (d) D. baarsii oxidized 3
equivalents K2IrCl6. SOR concentration was 3 mM in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. Same
experimental conditions as Figure 3.
