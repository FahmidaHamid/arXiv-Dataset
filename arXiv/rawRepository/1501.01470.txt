Superoxide reductase (SOR) is a newly discovered activity b y
which some anaerobic or microaerophilic organisms eliminate
superoxide, O 2•-.1 The SOR catalyzed reaction differs from that
of well-known superoxide dismutases SOD in that it does not
produce O2, but instead reduces by one electron O2•- to form
H2O2 exclusively: O2•- + 1 e- + 2H+ → H2O2.
The active site of SOR consists of a Fe2+ center (center II) i n
an unusual [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal pentacoordination. 2 It
reacts specifically at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate with O 2•, generating H2O2 and the oxidized form of the enzyme, the
ferric iron center II. The SORs (originally called
desulfoferrodoxin) found in some sulfate reducing bacteria, e.g.
Desulfoarculus baarsii1b and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans,2a,3
contain an additional mononuclear Fe3+ center, called center I,
coordinated by four cysteines with a distorted rubredoxin-type
structure. However, center I is not required for the reaction and,
up to now, its function remains unknown.1b-c
Recent pulse radiolysis studies of the reaction of center II
with O2•- have allowed the observation, in the micro and
millisecond time scale, of intermediates characterized b y
absorption bands in the 550-650 nm range. 4 These transient
species were proposed to be Fe3+ peroxo complexes, from
which H2O2 is liberated, on the assumption of an inner sphere
mechanism for O2•- reduction and on the basis that the
corresponding absorption bands were slightly different from
those of the final ferric iron center II.4
On the basis of the crystal structure2b and spectroscopic
studies5 of the SOR from Pyrococcus furiosus, it has been
proposed that upon oxidation the iron active site becomes sixcoordinated, as the consequence of a local protein domain
movement which places a strictly conserved glutamate (Glu47
in the SOR from D. baarsii) in the free coordination site. We
have mutated the Glu47 to alanine (E47A) in the SOR from D.
baarsii and found that this mutation did not affect the kinetics
of formation of the above mentioned intermediates detected b y
pulse radiolysis.4a-b However, because this Glu residue becomes
a ligand for the oxidized iron, a likely hypothesis could be that
it serves to release H2O2 from the Fe3+ peroxo intermediate b y
substitution in the iron coordination sphere.
Here, we have reacted SOR E47A from D. baarsii directly
with H2O2 and have found that the active site of the mutant can
indeed transiently stabilize a Fe3+ peroxo species, that could be
spectroscopically characterized.
When we rapidly manually mixed SOR E47A from D. baarsii
with 6 equivalents of H2O2, a UV-visible absorption feature
with a maximum at 560 nm, characteristic for the oxidation of
the iron center II,6a was immediately observed (Fig.1A). 6b The

4.2 K EPR spectrum,7 after subtraction of signals from center I,
recorded just after addition of 6 equivalents of H2O2 was
complex, with a major feature at g = 4.3 and a minor one at g =
4.15 (Fig.1Bi). The former one is comparable to that of an EPR
spectrum of SOR E47A oxidized with hexachloroiridate (IV)
(Fig.1Bii). It is characteristic for a high-spin Fe3+ in a rhombic
ligand field.1b,3 No other signals in the g = 2 and g = 8-10
regions were observed. At longer incubation time (10 min)
with H2O2, the feature at g = 4.15 completely disappeared (data
not shown).
Resonance Raman (RR) spectra at 15 K,8 taken from the SOR
E47A frozen immediately after addition of H2O2 indicated the
presence of two new bands at 850 and 438 cm-1 (Fig.2b), which
were not present when SOR was oxidized with
hexachloroiridate (IV) (Fig.2a). The RR spectra also exhibit a
band at 742 cm-1 which has been attributed to an internal C-S
stretching mode of the CysS-Fe3+ active site. 3 When the same
Raman measurements were made after mixing with H 218O 2, the
850 and 438 cm-1 bands were observed to down shift to 802 and
415 cm -1, respectively (Fig.2c). RR measurements in D2O
buffer indicated no significant shifts of the 850 and 438 cm -1
bands to within 1 cm-1 (cf. Supporting Information).
When the reaction was carried out with the wild-type SOR
and H2O2, under the same conditions that we described above for
the mutant, an intense RR band at 743 cm-1 was observed (Fig.
2d). This band can be used as a marker of the amount of Fe3+
formed in these conditions. The bands at 850 and 438 cm -1
observed in the case of the mutant with a similar amplitude as
that of the 743 cm-1 band (Fig. 2b) were now in the case of the
wild-type found to be very weak compared to the 743 cm-1 band
(Fig. 2d). However, they exhibited the same shift upon 18O
substitution than reported in the case of the mutant (data not
shown). The 4.2 K EPR spectra of the SOR wild-type, after
subtraction of signal of center I, and recorded immediately after
addition of H2O2, exhibited the rhombic signal at g = 4.3, 1b,3
whereas the feature at g = 4.15 was very weak and completely
vanished within a few min (data not shown).
The observed RR frequencies at 850 and 438 cm-1 and their
18
O isotopic shifts (-48 and -23 cm-1) are consistent with the
ν(O-O) and ν(Fe-O2) stretching modes, respectively, of an Fe3+peroxo species.9 The lack of deuterium isotopic shifts suggests
that this peroxo species is not protonated. We thus conclude
that H2O2 can oxidize SOR and bind to the ferric center II t o
yield a transient high-spin Fe3+-peroxo species, associated
with the feature at g = 4.15, as observed from the 4.2 K EPR
spectra. The absorption band at 560 nm resulted probably
mainly from the Cys-to-Fe3+ charge transfer band,3,5 but also

contains a contribution of the peroxo-to-iron Fe3+ charge
transfer band.9 The resolution of these two charge transfer
bands could be achieved by a RR excitation profile, but this i s
complicated because of the strong interference of center I when
excitations are made below 647 nm.3
The observed Raman frequencies are comparable to those
described for the end-on high-spin Fe3+-OOH species i n
oxyhemerythrin which showed deuterium isotope shifts. 1 0
However, for SOR reported here, the unusually low Fe-O2
frequency (438 cm-1) strongly suggests a side-on η 2 Fe3+peroxo species11 as found in the high-spin Fe complexes such
as [(EDTA)Fe(η2-O2)]3+, for example. 9 In addition, the lack of
deuterium shift, suggesting a non-protonated peroxo species,
is also consistent with a side-on η 2 Fe3+-peroxo species since i t
is expected to be more stable in the unprotonated form. Such a
coordination in the SOR active site would thus imply either a
heptacoordination for the iron or a loss of one of the imidazole
ligands, but up to now there is no evidence for such possible
coordination changes. 5 Clearly, relevant model Fe-peroxo
species with sulfur ligands, not yet available, would support
our proposal of a side-on peroxo coordination in SOR.
In conclusion, the data presented here first show that SOR
active site can accommodate a Fe3+-peroxo species and thus
support the hypothesis that reduction of O2•- proceeds through
such intermediates. To our knowledge, this is the first Fe3+(hydro)peroxo species that has been identified in a
mononuclear non-heme iron protein, with such an unusual
active site. Current RR experiments in the laboratory are
directed in order to identify Fe3+ -peroxo species formed
immediately after reaction with O2•-.
Second, the results suggest that the conserved Glu47 might
serve to help H2O2 release, as illustrated in Scheme 1, since
mutation of that residue to alanine results in stabilization of
the Fe3+ peroxide. It should be noted that the presence of the
cysteinate trans to the peroxide may also be crucial i n
promoting
H2O2 dissociation
from the Fe 3+-peroxo
intermediate, by pushing electron density on the iron. As a
matter of fact, the Fe-O2 bond observed here, with ν = 438 cm -1,
is particular weak and the O-O bond with ν = 850 cm-1 strong,
when compared to the corresponding values reported for model
complexes that promote O-O cleavage and formation of high
valent Fe-O species.9

The active site of superoxide reductase SOR consists of a Fe2+
center in an unusual [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal geometry. It
specifically reduces superoxide to produce H2O2. Here, we have
reacted the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii directly with H2O2.
We have found that its active site can transiently stabilize a
Fe3+-peroxo species that we have spectroscopically
characterized by resonance Raman. The mutation of the strictly
conserved Glu47 into alanine results in a stabilization of this
Fe3+-peroxo species, when compared to the wild-type form.
These data support the hypothesis that the reaction of SOR
proceeds through such Fe3+-peroxo intermediate. This also
suggests that Glu47 might serve to H2O2 released during the
reaction with superoxide.
