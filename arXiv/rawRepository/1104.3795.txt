Abstract
We consider a conductance based neural network inspired by the generalized Integrate and Fire model
introduced by Rudolph and Destexhe in [1]. We show the existence and uniqueness of a unique Gibbs
distribution characterizing spike train statistics. The corresponding Gibbs potential is explicitly computed. These
results hold in presence of a time-dependent stimulus and apply therefore to non-stationary dynamics.

Introduction

Neural networks have an overwhelming complexity. While an isolated neuron can exhibit a wide variety of
responses to stimuli [2], from regular spiking to chaos [3, 4], neurons coupled in a network via synapses
(electrical or chemical) may show an even wider variety of collective dynamics [5] resulting from the
conjunction of nonlinear effects, time propagation delays, synaptic noise, synaptic plasticity, and external
stimuli [6]. Focusing on the action potentials, this complexity is manifested by drastic changes in the spikes
activity, for instance when switching from spontaneous to evoked activity (see for example A. Riehle’s team
experiments on the monkey motor cortex [7–10]). However, beyond this complexity may exist some hidden
laws ruling an (hypothetical) “neural code” [11].

1

One way of unraveling these hidden laws is to seek some regularities or reproducibility in the statistics of
spikes. While early investigations on spiking activities were focusing on firing rates where neurons are
considered as independent sources, researchers concentrated more recently on collective statistical
indicators such as pairwise correlations. Thorough experiments in the retina [12, 13] as well as in the
parietal cat cortex [14], suggested that such correlations are crucial for understanding spiking activity.
Those conclusions where obtained using the maximal entropy principle [15]. Assume that the average value
of observables quantities (e.g. firing rate or spike correlations) has been measured. Those average values
constitute constraints for the statistical model. In the maximal entropy principle, assuming stationarity,
one looks for the probability distribution which maximizes the statistical entropy given those constraints.
This leads to a (time-translation invariant) Gibbs distribution. In particular, fixing firing rates and the
probability of pairwise coincidences of spikes leads to a Gibbs distribution having the same form as the
Ising model. This idea has been introduced by Schneidman et al in [12] for the analysis of retina spike
trains. They reproduce accurately the probability of spatial spiking pattern. Since then, their approach has
known a great success (see e.g. [16–18]), although some authors raised solid objections on this
model [13, 19–21] while several papers have pointed out the importance of temporal patterns of activity at
the network level [22–24]. As a consequence, a few authors [14, 25, 26] have attempted to define
time-dependent models of Gibbs distributions where constraints include time-dependent correlations
between pairs, triplets and so on [27]. As a matter of fact, the analysis of the data of [12] with such models
describes more accurately the statistics of spatio-temporal spike patterns [28].
Taking into account all constraints inherent to experiments it seems extremely difficult to find an optimal
model describing spike trains statistics. It is in fact likely that there is not one model, but many,
depending on the experiment, the stimulus, the investigated part of the nervous system and so on.
Additionally, the assumptions made in the works quoted above are difficult to control. Especially, the
maximal entropy principle assumes a stationary dynamics while many experiments consider a
time-dependent stimulus generating a time-dependent response where the stationary approximation may
not be valid. At this stage, having an example where one knows the explicit form of the spike trains
probability distribution would be helpful to control those assumptions and to define related experiments.
This can be done considering neural network models. Although, to be tractable, such models may be quite
away from biological plausibility, they can give hints on which statistics can be expected in real neural
networks. But, even in the simplest examples, characterizing spike statistics arising from the conjunction of
nonlinear effects, time propagation delays, synaptic noise, synaptic plasticity, and external stimuli is far
2

from being trivial on mathematical grounds.
In [29] we have nevertheless proposed an exact and explicit result for the characterization of spike trains
statistics in a discrete time version of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neural network. The results were quite
surprising. It has been shown that whatever the parameters value (in particular synaptic weights), spike
trains are distributed according to a Gibbs distribution whose potential can be explicitly computed. The
first surprise lies in the fact that this potential has infinite range, namely spike statistics has an infinite
memory. This is because the membrane potential evolution integrates its past values and the past influence
of the network via the leak term. Although Leaky Integrate-and-Fire models have a reset mechanism which
erases the memory of the neuron whenever it spikes, it is not possible to upper bound the next time of
firing. As a consequence, statistics is non-Markovian (for recent examples of non-Markovian behavior in
neural models see also [30]). The infinite range of the potential corresponds, in the maximal entropy
principle interpretation, to having infinitely many constraints.
Nevertheless, the leak term influence decays exponentially fast with time (this property guarantees the
existence and uniqueness of a Gibbs distribution). As a consequence, one can approximate the exact Gibbs
distribution by the invariant probability of a Markov chain, with a memory depth proportional to the log
of the (discrete time) leak term. In this way, the truncated potential corresponds to a finite number of
constraints in the maximal entropy principle interpretation. However, the second surprise is that this
approximated potential is nevertheless far from the Ising model or any of the models discussed above, that
appear as quite bad approximations. In particular, there is a need to consider n-uplets of spikes with time
delays. This mere fact asks hard problems about evidencing such type of potentials in experiments.
Especially, new type of algorithms for spike trains analysis have to be developed [31].
The model considered in [29] is rather academic: time evolution is discrete, synaptic interactions are
instantaneous, dynamics is stationary (the stimulus is time-constant) and, as in a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
model, conductances are constant. It is therefore necessary to investigate whether our conclusions remain
for more realistic neural networks models. In the present paper we consider a conductance-based model
introduced by Rudolph and Destexhe in [1] called “generalized Integrate and Fire” (gIF) model. This
model allows one to consider realistic synaptic responses, and conductances depending on spikes arising in
the past of the network, leading to a rather complex dynamics which has been characterized in [32] in the
deterministic case (no noise in the dynamics). Moreover, the biological plausibility of this model is well
accepted [33, 34].
Here we analyse spike statistics in the gIF model with noise and with a time-dependent stimulus.
3

Moreover, the post-synaptic potential profiles are quite general and summarize all the examples that we
know in the literature. Our main result is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a Gibbs measure
characterizing spike trains statistics, for all parameters compatible with physical constraints (finite synaptic
weights, bounded stimulus, and positive conductances). Here, as in [29], the corresponding Gibbs potential
has infinite range corresponding to a non-Markovian dynamics, although Markovian approximations can be
proposed in the gIF model too. The Gibbs potential depends on all parameters in the model (especially
connectivity and stimulus) and has a form quite more complex than Ising-like models. As a by-product of
the proof of our main result, additional interesting notions and results are produced such as continuity
with respect to a raster, or exponential decay of memory thanks to the shape of synaptic responses.
The paper is organised as follows. In the section 2 we briefly introduce Integrate-and-Fire models and
propose two important extensions of the classical models: the spike has a duration and the membrane
potential is reset to a non-constant value. These extensions, which are necessary for the validity of our
mathematical results, render nevertheless the model more biologically plausible (see the discussion section).
One of the keys of the present work is to consider spike trains (raster plots) as infinite sequences. Since in
gIF models conductances are updated upon the occurrence of spikes, one has to consider two types of
variables with distinct type of dynamics. On one hand, the membrane potential, which is the physical
variable associated with neurons dynamics evolves continuously. On the other hand, spikes are discrete
events. Conductances are updated according to these discrete time events. The formalism introduced in
section 2 and 3 allows us to handle properly this mixed dynamics. As a consequence, these sections define
gIF model with more mathematical structure than the original paper [1] and mostly contain original
results. Moreover, we add to the model several original features such as the consideration of a general form
of synaptic profile with exponential decay or the introduction of noise. Section 4 proposes a preliminary
analysis of gIF model-dynamics. In sections 5, 6 we provide several useful mathematical propositions as a
necessary step toward the analysis of spike statistics, developed in section 7, where we prove the main
result of the paper: existence and uniqueness of a Gibbs distribution describing spike statistics. The
section 8 and 9 are devoted to a discussion on practical consequences of our results for neuroscience.

Integrate and Fire model.

We consider the evolution of a set of N neurons. Here, neurons are considered as “points” instead of
spatially extended and structured objects. As a consequence, we define, for each neuron k ∈ {1 . . . N }, a
variable Vk (t) called the “membrane potential of neuron k at time t” without specification of which part of
4

N

a real neuron (axon, soma, dendritic spine, ...) it corresponds to. Denote V (t) the vector ( Vk (t) )k=1 .
We focus here on “Integrate-and-Fire models”, where dynamics always consists of two regimes.

2.1

The “Integrate regime”.

Fix a real number θ called the “firing threshold of the neuron”1 . Below the threshold, Vk < θ, neuron k’s
dynamics is driven by an equation of the form:

Ck

dVk
+ gk Vk = ik ,
dt

(1)

where Ck is the membrane capacity of neuron k. In its most general form, the neuron k’s membrane
conductance gk > 0 depends on Vk plus additional variables such as the probability of having ionic
channels open (see e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley equations [35]) as well as on time t. The explicit form of gk in the
present model is developed in section 3.4. The current ik typically depend on time t, and on the past
activity of the network. It also contains a stochastic component modelling noise in the system (e.g.
synaptic transmission, see section 3.5).

2.2

LIF model

A classical example of Integrate-and-Fire model is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire’s (LIF) introduced in [42]
where equation (1) reads:
dVk
ik (t)
Vk
+
.
=−
dt
τL
Ck
where gk is a constant and τL =

Ck
gk

(2)

is the characteristic time for membrane potential decay when no

current is present (“leak term”).

2.3

Spikes

The dynamical evolution (1) may eventually lead Vk to exceed θ. If, at some time t, Vk (t) = θ then neuron
k emits a spike or “fires”. In our model, like in biophysics, a spike has a finite duration δ > 0; this is a
generalisation of the classical formulation of Integrate-and-Fire models where the spike is considered
instantaneous. On biophysical grounds δ is of order of a millisecond. Changing the time units we may set
1 We assume that all neurons have the same firing threshold. The notion of threshold is already an approximation which
is not sharply defined in Hodgkin-Huxley [35] or Fitzhugh-Nagumo [36, 37] models (more precisely it is not a constant but
it depends on the dynamical variables [38]). Recent experiments [39–41] even suggest that there may be no real potential
threshold.

5

δ = 1 without loss of generality. Additionally, neurons have a refractory period τref r > 0 where they are
not able to emit a new spike although their membrane potential can fluctuate below the threshold (see fig.
1). Hence, spikes emitted by a given neuron are separated by a minimal time scale
τsep = δ + τref r

2.4

(3)

Raster plots

In experiments spiking neurons activity is represented by “raster plots”, namely a graph with time in
abscissa and a neuron labeling in ordinate such that a vertical bar is drawn each “time” a neuron emits a
spike. Since spikes have a finite duration δ such a representation limits the time resolution: events with a
time scale smaller that δ are not distinguished. As a consequence, if neuron 1 fires at time t1 and neuron 2
at time t2 with | t2 − t1 | < δ = 1 the two spikes appear to be simultaneous on the raster. Thus, the raster
representation introduces a time quantization and has a tendency to enhance synchronization. In gIF
models conductances are updated upon the occurrence of spikes (see section 3.2) which are considered as
such discrete events. This could correspond to the following “experiment”. Assume that we measure the
spikes emitted by a set of in vitro neurons, and that we use this information to update the conductances of
a model, in order to see how this model “matches” the real neurons (see [58] for a nice investigation in this
spirit). Then, we would have to take into account that the information provided by the experimental raster
plot is discrete, even if the membrane potential evolves continuously. The consequences of this
time-discretisation as well as the limit δ → 0 are developed in the discussion section.
As a consequence, one has to consider two types of variables with distinct type of dynamics. On one hand,
the membrane potential, which is the physical variable associated with neuron dynamics evolves with a
continuous time. On the other hand, spikes, which are the quantities of interest in the present paper are
discrete events. To define properly this mixed dynamics and study its properties we have to model spikes
times and raster plots.

2.5

Spike times

If, at time t, Vk (t) = θ, a spike is registered at the integer time immediately after t, called the spike time.
Choosing integers for the spike time occurrence is a direct consequence of setting δ = 1. Thus, to each
neuron k and integer n we associate a “spiking state” defined by:

if ∃t ∈]n − 1, n] such that
 1
ωk (n) =

0
otherwise.
6

Vk (t) = θ;

For convenience and in order to simplify the notations in the mathematical developments, we call [ t ] the
largest integer which is ≤ t (thus [ −1.2 ] = −2 and [ 1.2 ] = 1). Thus, the integer immediately after t is
[ t + 1 ] and we have therefore that ωk ([ t + 1 ]) = 1 whenever Vk (t) = θ. Although, characteristic events in a
raster plot are spikes (neuron fires) it is useful in subsequent developments to consider also the case when
neuron is not firing (ωk (n) = 0).

2.6

Reset

In the classical formulation of Integrate-and-Fire models the spike occurs simultaneously with a reset of the
membrane potential to some constant value Vreset , called the “reset potential”. Instantaneous reset is a
source of pathologies as discussed in [32, 43] and in the discussion section. Here, we consider that reset
occurs after the time delay τsep ≥ 1 including spike duration and refractory period. We set:
Vk (t) = θ ⇒ Vk ([ t + τsep ]) = Vreset .

(4)

The reason why the reset time is the integer number [ t + τsep ] instead of the real t + τsep is that it eases
the notations and proofs. Since the reset value is random (see below and Fig. 1) this assumption has no
impact on the dynamics.
Indeed, in our model, the reset value Vreset is not a constant. This is a Gaussian random variable with
2
mean zero (we set the rest potential to zero without loss of generality) and variance σR
> 0. In this way we

model the spike duration and refractory period, as well as the random oscillations of the membrane
potential during the refractory period. As a consequence, the value of Vk when the neuron can fire again is
not a constant, as it is in classical IF models. A related reference (spiking neurons with partial reset)
2
is [44]. The assumption that σR
> 0 is necessary for our mathematical developments (see the bounds (37)).
2
We assume σR
to be small to avoid trivial and unrealistic situations where Vreset ≥ θ with a large

probability leading the neuron to fire all the time. Note however that this is not a required assumption to
establish our mathematical results. We also assume that, in successive resets, the random variables Vreset
are independent.

2.7

The shape of membrane potential during the spike

On biophysical grounds the time course of the membrane potential during the spike includes a
depolarisation and re-polarisation phase due to the nonlinear effects of gated ionic channels on the
conductance. This leads to introduce, in modelling, additional variables such as activation/inactivation

7

probabilities as in the Hodgkin-Huxley model [35] or adaptation current as e.g. in FitzHugh-Nagumo
model [36, 37, 45, 46] (see the discussion section for extensions of our results to those models). Here, since
we are considering only one variable for the neuron state, the membrane potential, we need to define the
spike profile, i.e. the course of Vk (t) during the time interval (t, [ t + τsep ]). It turns out that the precise
shape of this profile plays no role in the developments proposed here, where we concentrate on spike
statistics. Indeed, a spike is registered whenever Vk (t) = θ and this does not depend on the spike shape.
What we need is therefore to define the membrane potential evolution before the spike, given by (1), and
after the spike, given by (4) (see Figure 1).

The “spiking pattern” of the neural network at integer time n is the vector ω(n) = (ωk (n))k=1 . For m < n

we note ωm
= { ω(m) ω(m + 1) . . . ω(n) } the ordered sequence of spiking patterns between m and n. Such

the set of spiking patterns (alphabet). An element of X = AZ , i.e. a bi-infinite ordered

sequence ω = {ω(n)}n=−∞ of spiking patterns, is called a “raster plot”. It tells us which neurons are firing

Z

at each time n ∈ . In experiments raster plots are obviously finite sequences of spiking pattern but the
extension to

Z, especially the possibility of considering an arbitrary distant past (negative times) is a key

n
of the present work. In particular, the notation ω−∞
refers to spikes occurring from −∞ to n.

of “spike times” tj (ω)
(integer numbers) such that tj (ω) is the r-th time of firing of neuron j in
r=1

(r)

the raster ω. In other words, we have ωj (n) = 1 if and only if n = tj (ω) for some r = 1, · · · + ∞.

We introduce here two specific rasters which are of use in the paper. We note Ω0 the raster such that
ωk (n) = 0, ∀k = 1 . . . N, ∀n ∈

Z (no neuron ever fires) and Ω1 the raster ωk (n) = 1, ∀i = 1 . . . N, ∀n ∈ Z

(each neuron is firing at every integer time).

Z

Finally, we use the following notation borrowed from [47]. We note, for n ∈ , m ≥ 0, and r integer:
m,n

ω = ω′

if

ω(r) = ω ′ (r), ∀r ∈ { n − m, . . . , n } .

(5)

For simplicity, we consider that τref , the refractory period, is smaller than 1 so that a neuron can fire two
consecutive time steps (i.e. one can have ωk (n) = 1 and ωk (n + 1) = 1). This constraint is discussed in
section 9.2.

2.9

Representation of time dependent functions

Throughout the paper we use the following convention. For a real function of t and ω, we write f (t, ω) for
[t]

f (t, ω−∞ ) to simplify notations. This notation takes into account the duality between variables such as
membrane potential evolving with respect to a continuous time and raster plots labeled with discrete time.
[t]

Thus, the function f (t, ω) is a function of the continuous variable t and of the spike block ω−∞ , where by
definition [ t ] ≤ t, namely f (t, ω) depends on the spike sequences occurring before t. This constraint is
imposed by causality.

2.10

Last reset time

We define τk (t, ω) as the last time before t where neuron k’s membrane potential has been reset, in the
raster ω. This is −∞ if the membrane potential has never been reset. As a consequence of our choice (4)
for the reset time τk (t, ω) is an integer number fixed by t and the raster before t . The membrane potential
value of neuron k at time t is controlled by the reset value Vreset at time τk (t, ω) and by the further
sub-threshold evolution (1) from time τk (t, ω) to time t.
2 We use the following convention. The index k is used for a post-synaptic neuron while the index j refers to pre-synaptic
neurons. Spiking events are used to update the conductance of neuron k according to spikes emitted by pre-synaptic neurons.
That’s why we label the spike times with an index j.

Generalized Integrate-and-Fire models

In this paper, we concentrate on an extension of (2), called “generalized Integrate-and-Fire” (gIF),
introduced in [1], closer to biology [33, 34], since it considers more seriously neurons interactions via
synaptic responses.

3.1

Synaptic conductances

Depending on the neuro-transmitter3 they use for synaptic transmission neurons can be excitatory
(population E) or inhibitory (population I). This is modeled by introducing reversal potentials E + for
excitatory (typically E + ≃ 0mV for AMPA and NMDA) and E − for inhibitory (E − ≃ −70mV for GABA
A and E − ≃ −95mV for GABA B). We focus here on one population of excitatory and one population of
inhibitory neurons although extensions to several populations may be considered as well. Also, each neuron
is submitted to a current Ik (t). We assume that this current has some stochastic component that mimics
synaptic noise (section 3.5).
The variation of the membrane potential of neuron k at time t reads:

Ck

dVk
(E)
(I)
= −gL,k (Vk − EL ) − gk (t) (Vk − E + ) − gk (t) (Vk − E − ) + Ik (t),
dt

(6)

(E)

where gL,k is a leak conductance, EL < 0 is the leak reversal potential (about −65 mV), gk (t) the
(I)

conductance of the excitatory population and gk (t) the conductance of inhibitory population. They are
given by:

(E)

gk (t) =

X

(I)

gkj (t);

where gkj is the conductance of the synaptic contact j → k.

and
(E)

ik (t) = gL,k EL + gk (t) E + + gk (t) E − + Ik (t).

3.2

Conductance update upon a spike occurrence.

The conductances gkj (t) in (7) depend on time t but also on pre-synaptic spikes occurring before t. This is
a general statement which is modeled in gIF models as follows. Upon arrival of a spike in the pre-synaptic
(r)

neuron j at time tj (ω) the membrane conductance of the post-synaptic neuron k is modified as:


(r)

gkj (t) = gkj (tj (ω)) + Gkj αkj


(r)
t − tj (ω) ,

(r)

t > tj (ω).

(8)

In this equation, the quantity Gkj ≥ 0 characterizes the maximal amplitude of the conductance during a
post-synaptic potential. We use the convention that Gkj = 0 if and only if there is no synapse between j
and k. This allows us to encode the graph structure of the neural network in the matrix G with entries
Gkj . Note that the Gkj ’s can evolve in time due to synaptic plasticity mechanisms (see section 9.4).
The function αkj (called “alpha” profile [48]) mimics the time course of the synaptic conductance upon the
occurrence of the spike. Classical examples are:

αkj ( t ) = e

− τt

kj

(9)

H(t),

(exponential profile) or:
αkj ( t ) =

t
τkj

e

kj

H(t),

(10)

with H the Heaviside function (that mimics causality) and τkj is the characteristic decay times of the
synaptic response. Since t is a time, the division by τkj ensures that αkj ( t ) is a dimensionless quantity:
this eases the legibility of the subsequent equations on physical grounds (dimensionality of physical
quantities).
Contrarily to (9) the synaptic profile (10), with αkj ( 0 ) = 0 while αkj ( t ) is maximal for t = τkj allows one
to smoothly delay the spike action on the post-synaptic neuron. More general forms of synaptic responses
could be considered as well 4 .

3.3

Mathematical constraints on the synaptic responses

In all the paper we assume that the αkj ’s are positive and bounded. Moreover, we assume that:

the decay time of the evoked post-synaptic potential. This constraint matches all synaptic response kernels
that we know (where typically d = 0, 1) [48, 49].
This has the following consequence. For all t, M < t integer, r integer, we have, setting t = { t } + [ t ],
where { t } is the fractional part:

On physical grounds it implies that the conductance gk remains bounded, even if each pre-synaptic neuron
is firing all the time (see eq. (29) below).

3.4

Synaptic summation

Assume that eq. (8) remains valid for an arbitrary number of pre-synaptic spikes emitted by neuron j
within a finite time interval [s, t] (i.e. neglecting nonlinear effects such as the fact that there is a finite
12

amount of neurotransmitter leading to saturation effects). Then, one obtains the following equation for the
(r)

conductance gkj at time t, upon the arrival of spikes at times tj (ω) in the time interval [s, t]:

The conductance at time s, gkj (s), depends on the neuron j’s activity preceding s. This term is therefore
unknown unless one knows exactly the past evolution before s. One way to circumvent this problem is to
taking s arbitrary far in the past, i.e. taking s → −∞ in order to remove the dependence on initial
conditions. This corresponds to the following situation. When one observes a real neural network the time
where the observation starts, say t = 0, is usually not the time when the system has begun to exist, s in
our notations. Taking s arbitrary far in the past corresponds to assuming that the system has evolved long
enough so that it has reached sort of a “permanent regime”, not necessarily stationary, when the
observation starts. On phenomenological grounds it is enough to take −s larger than all characteristic
relaxation times in the system (e.g. leak rate and synaptic decay rate). Here, for mathematical purposes it
is easier to take the limit s → −∞.

(r)

Since gkj (t) depends on the raster plot up to time t, via the spiking times tj (ω) this limit makes only
sense when taking it “conditionally” to a prescribed raster plot ω. In other words, one can know the value
of the conductances gkj at time t only if the past spike times of the network are known. We write gkj (t, ω)
from now on to make this dependence explicit.
We set

αkj ( t, ω ) = lim

3.5

Noise

We allow, in the definition of the current Ik (t) in eq. (6) the possibility of having a stochastic term
corresponding to noise so that:
(ext)

Ik (t) = ik
(ext)

where ik

(t) + σB ξk (t),

(15)

(t) is a deterministic external current and ξk (t) a noise term whose amplitude is controlled by

σB > 0. The model affords an extension where σB depends on k but this extension is straightforward and
13

we do not develop it here. The noise term can be interpreted as the random variation in the ionic flux of
charges crossing the membrane per unit time at the post synaptic button, upon opening of ionic channels
due to the binding of neurotransmitter.
We assume that ξk (t) is a white noise, ξk (t) =

dBk
dt

where dBk (t) is a Wiener process, so that

dB(t) = ( dBk (t) )N
k=1 is a N -dimensional Wiener process. Call P the noise probability distribution and
E [ ] the expectation under P . Then, by definition, E [ dBk (t) ] = 0, ∀k = 1 . . . N, t ∈

R, and

E [ dBk (s) dBl (t) ] = δkl δ(t − s)dt where δkl = 1 if l = k, l, k = 1 . . . N and δ(t − s) is the Dirac distribution.

Differential equation for the Integrate regime of gIF

dVk
+ gk ( t, ω ) Vk = ik (t, ω),

where:
gk ( t, ω ) = gL,k +

(18)

j=1

where Wkj is the synaptic weight:


Wkj = E + Gkj ,
Wkj = E − Gkj ,

if
if

j ∈ E,
j ∈ I.

These equations hold when the membrane potential is below the threshold (Integrate regime).
Therefore, gIF models constitute rather complex dynamical systems: the vector field (r.h.s) of the
[t]

differential equation (16) depends on an auxiliary “variable” which is the past spike sequence ω−∞ and to
define properly the evolution of Vk from time t to later times one needs to know the spikes arising before t.
This is precisely what makes gIF models more interesting than LIF. The definition of conductances
introduces long term memory effects.
IF models implement a reset mechanism on the membrane potential: If neuron k has been reset between s
and t, say at time τ , then Vk (t) depends only on Vk (τ ) and not on previous values, as in (4). But, in gIF
model, contrarily to LIF, there is also a dependence in the past via the conductance and this dependence is
not erased by the reset. That’s why we have to consider a system with infinite memory.

14

3.7

The parameters space

The stochastic dynamical system (16) depends on a huge set of parameters: the membrane capacities
Ck , k = 1 . . . N , the threshold θ, the reversal potentials EL , E + , E − , the leak conductance gL ; the maximal
synaptic conductances Gkj , k, j = 1 . . . N which define the neural network topology; the characteristic
times τkj , k, j = 1 . . . N of synaptic responses decay; the noise amplitude σB and, additionally, the
(ext)

parameters defining the external current ik

. Although some parameters can be fixed from biology, such

as Ck , the reversal potentials, τkj , ... some others such as the Gkj ’s must be allowed to vary freely in order
to leave open the possibility of modelling very different neural networks structures.
In this paper we are not interested in describing properties arising for specific values of those parameters,
but instead in generic properties that hold on sets of parameters. More specifically, we denote the list of all


N
N
parameters ( Ck )k=1 , EL , E + , E − , ( Gkj )k,j=1 , . . . by the symbol γ. This is a vector in IRK where K is
the total number of parameters. In this paper, we assume that γ belongs to a bounded subset H ⊂ IRK .

Basically, we want to avoid situations where some parameters become infinite, which would be unphysical.
So the limits of H are the limits imposed by biophysics. Additionally, we assume that σR > 0 and σB > 0.
Together with physical constraints such as “conductances are positive”, these are the only assumption
made in parameters. All mathematical results stated in the paper old for any γ ∈ H.

gIF model-dynamics for a fixed raster

We assume that the raster ω is fixed, namely the spike history is given. Then, it is possible to integrate the
equation (16) (Integrate regime) and to obtain explicitly the value of the membrane potential of a neuron
at time t, given the membrane potential value at time s. Additionally, the reset condition (4) has the
consequence of removing the dependence of neuron k on the past anterior to τk (t, ω).

This equation gives the variation of membrane potential during a period of rest (no spike) of the neuron.

(B)

(24)

Reset

In eq. (4), as in all IF models that we know, the reset of the membrane potential has the effect of removing
the dependence of Vk on its past since Vk ([ t + τsep ]) is replaced by Vreset . Hence, reset removes the
dependence in the initial condition Vk (s) in (24) provided that neuron k fires between s and t in the raster
ω. As a consequence, eq. (24) holds, from the “last reset time” introduced in section 2.10 up to time t.
Then, eq. (24) reads
(det)

Vk (t) = Vk

(noise)

(τk (t, ω), t, ω) + Vk

(τk (t, ω), t, ω).

(25)

where:

Although the reset condition may look as a simplification it is in fact a source of complications on
mathematical grounds. As discussed in section 9.3 several proofs are easier if we do not reset memory and
instead take the limit s → −∞ in (24). However, since IF models are widespread in the neuroscience
literature we have preferred to give the more general proofs and then discuss their adaptation to simpler
cases.

so that the conductance is uniformly bounded in t and ω. The minimal conductance is attained when no
neuron fires ever so that Ω0 is the “lowest conductance state”. On the opposite the maximal conductance
is reached when all neurons fire all the time so that Ω1 is the “highest conductance state”. To simplify
notations we note τM,k =

The limit τk (t, ω) → −∞

For fixed s and t there are infinitely many rasters such that τk (t, ω) < s (we remind that rasters are infinite
sequences). One may argue that taking the difference t − s sufficiently large the probability of such
sequences should vanish. It is indeed possible to show (section 8.1) that this probability vanishes
exponentially fast with t − s, meaning unfortunately that it is positive whatever t − s. So we have to
consider cases where τk (t, ω) can go arbitrary far in past (this is also a key toward an extension of the
present analysis to more general conductance-based models as discussed in section 9.3). Therefore, we have
to check that the quantities introduced in the previous sections are well defined as τk (t, ω) → −∞.
Fix s real. For all ω such that τk (t, ω) ≤ s - this condition ensuring that k does not fire between s and t we have, from (28), (31), 0 ≤ Γk (t1 , t, ω)αkj ( t1 , ω ) ≤ α+ e

Continuity with respect to a raster.
Definition

Due to the particular structure of gIF models we have seen that the membrane potential at time t is both a
[t]

function of t and of the full sequence of past spikes ω−∞ . One expects however the dependence with
respect to the past spikes to decay as those spikes are more distant in the past. This issue is related to a
notion of continuity with respect to a raster that we now characterize.
[t]

Definition 1 Let m be a positive integer.The m-variation of a function f (t, ω) ≡ f (t, ω−∞ ) is:
varm [f (t, .)] = sup



m,[ t ]

| f (t, ω) − f (t, ω ′ ) | : ω = ω ′

20



.

(38)

m,[ t ]

where the definition of = is given in eq. (5). Hence, this notion characterizes the maximal variation of
f (t, .) on the set of spikes identical from time [ t ] − m to time [ t ] (cylinder set). It implements the fact
that one may truncate the spike history to time [ t ] − m and make an error which is at most varm [f (t, .)].
Definition 2 The function f (t, ω) is continuous if varm [f (t, .)] → 0 as m → +∞.
An additional information is provided by the convergence rate to 0 with m. The faster this convergence the
smaller the error made when replacing an infinite raster by a spike block on a finite time horizon.

Note that the variation of all quantities considered here is exponentially decaying with a time constant
given by max(τkj , τL,k ). This is physically satisfactory: the loss of memory in the system is controlled by
the leak time and the decay of the post-synaptic potential.

Conditional probability distribution of Vk (t).

Recall that P is the joint distribution of the noise and E [ ] the expectation under P . Under P the
membrane potential V is a stochastic process whose evolution, below the threshold, is given eq. (24), (25)
and above by (4). It follows from the previous analysis that:
[t]

Proposition 7 Conditionally to ω−∞ , V (t) is Gaussian with mean:
i
h
(det)
[t]
E Vk (t) | ω−∞ = Vk (τk (t, ω), t, ω),

k = 1 . . . N,

and covariance:
i
h
[t]
Cov Vk (t), Vl (t) | ω−∞ = σk2 (τk (t, ω), t, ω)δkl ,

k, l = 1 . . . N

where σk2 (τk (t, ω), t, ω) is given by (27).

Moreover, the Vk (t)’s, k = 1 . . . N , are conditionally independent.

Proof Essentially, the proof is a direct consequence of eq. (24), (25) and the Gaussian nature of the noise
(noise)

Vk

(τk (t, ω), t, ω). The conditional independence results from the fact that:

Chains with complete connections

The transition probabilities (47) define a stochastic process on the set of raster plots where the underlying
(det)

membrane potential dynamics is summarized in the terms Vk

(τk (n − 1, ω), n − 1, ω) and

σk (τk (n − 1, ω), n − 1, ω). While the integral defining these terms extends from τk (n − 1, ω) to n − 1 where
τk (n − 1, ω) can go arbitrary far in the past, the integrand involves the conductance gk (n − 1, ω) which
summarizes an history dating back to s = −∞. As a consequence, the probability transitions generate a
stochastic process with unbounded memory, thus non Markovian. One may argue that this property is a
result of our procedure of taking the initial condition in a infinite past s → −∞, to remove the unresolved
dependency on gk (s) (section 3.4). So the alternative is either to keep s finite in order to have a Markovian
27

process; then we have to fix arbitrarily gk (s) and the probability distribution of Vk (s). Or we take
s → −∞, removing the initial condition, to the price of considering a non Markovian process. Actually,
such processes are widely studied in the literature under the name of “chains with complete
connections” [47, 50–53] and several important results can be used here. So we adopt the second approach
of the alternative. As a by-product the knowledge of the Gibbs measure provided by this analysis allows a
posteriori to fix the probability distribution of Vk (s).
For the sake of completeness we give here the definition of a chain with complete connections (see [47] for

Z

the set of sequences ω−∞
and F≤n−1 the related σ-algebra, while

Existence of a consistent probability measure µ

In the definition above, the measure µ summarizes the statistics of spike trains from −∞ to +∞. Its
marginals allow the characterization of finite spike blocks. So, µ provides the characterization of spike train
28

statistics in gIF models. Its existence is established by a standard result in the frame of chains with
complete connections stating that a system of continuous transition probabilities on a compact space has
at least one probability measure consistent with it [47]. Since π is a continuous function the continuity of
(det)

p(n, ω) with respect to ω follows from the continuity of Vk

(τk (n − 1, ω), n − 1, ω) and the continuity of

σk (τk (n − 1, ω), n − 1, ω), proved in section 6.
Therefore there is at least one probability measure consistent with (47).

Following [54], a chain with complete connection µ is a Gibbs measure consistent with the system of
transition probabilities p(n, .) if this system is continuous and non-null. Gibbs distributions play an

important role in statistical physics, as well as ergodic theory and stochastic processes. In statistical
physics they are usually derived from the maximal entropy principle [15]. Here we use them in a more
general context affording to consider non-stationary processes. It turns out that the spike train statistics in
gIF model is given by such a Gibbs measure. In this section we prove the main mathematical result of this
paper (uniqueness of the Gibbs measure). The consequences for spike trains characterizations are discussed
in the next section.
Theorem 1 For each choice of parameters γ ∈ H the gIF model (16) has a unique Gibbs distribution.
The proof of uniqueness is based on the following criteria due to Fernandez and Maillard [54].
Proposition 9 Let:

If m(p) > 0 and v(p) < ∞, then there exists at most one Gibbs measure consistent with it .
So, to prove the uniqueness we only have to establish that
m(p) > 0,
5 In

(51)

[54] the authors use the following definition for the n, m variation, which reads in our notations:

It differs therefore slightly from our definition (5),(38). The correspondence is varm

of v(p) takes this correspondence into account.

Back to spike trains analysis with the maximal entropy principle

Here we shortly develop the consequences of our results in relation with the statistical model estimation
discussed in the introduction. A more detailed discussion will be published elsewhere (in preparation
and [55]). Set:

This equation emphasizes the connection with Gibbs distributions in statistical physics which considers
probability distributions on multidimensional lattices with specified boundary conditions and their
behavior under space translations [56]. The correspondence with our case is that “time” is represented by a
m−1
mono-dimensional space and where the “boundary conditions” are the past ω−∞
. Note that in our case

the partition function is equal to 1.
For simplicity assume stationarity (this is equivalent to assuming a time-independent external current). In
this case, it is sufficient to consider the potential at time n = 0.
31

Thanks to the bounds (53) one can make a series expansion of the functions log ( π ) and log ( 1 − π ) and
rewrite the potential under the form of the expansion:

φ ( 0, ω ) =

R
+∞ X
X

X

λ(k1 ,n1 ),...,(kr ,nr ) ωk1 (n1 ) . . . ωkr (nr )

(57)

R=1 r=1 { (k1 ,n1 ),...,(kr ,nr )∈P(N,R) }

where P(N, R) is the set of non-repeated pairs of integers (k, N ) with k ∈ { 1, . . . , N } and
n ∈ { −R, . . . , 0 }. We call the product ωk1 (n1 ) . . . ωkr (nr ) a monomial. It is 1 if and only if neuron k1 fires
at time n1 , . . . , kr fires at time nr . The λ(k1 ,n1 ),...,(kr ,nr ) ’s are explicit functions of the parameters γ. Due
to the causal form of the potential, where the time-0 spike, ωk (0), is multiplied by a function of the past
−1
ω−∞
, the polynomial expansion does not contain monomials of the form ωk1 (0) . . . ωkr (0), r > 1 (the

corresponding coefficient λ vanishes).
Since the potential has infinite range the expansion (57) contains infinitely many terms. One can
nevertheless consider truncations to a range R = D + 1 corresponding to truncating the memory of the
process to some memory depth D. Note that although truncations with a memory depth D are
approximations, the distance with the exact potential converges exponentially fast to 0 as D → +∞ thanks
to the continuity of the potential, with a decay rate controlled by synaptic responses and leak rate.
The truncated Gibbs potential has the form:
0
φ(D) ω−D



λl φl ω−D

(58)

where l stands for (k1 , n1 ), . . . , (kr , nr ) and is an enumeration of the elements in P(N, D + 1) and where φl
is the corresponding monomial. Due to the truncation (58), contrarily to (55), is not normalized. Its
partition function6 is not equal to 1 and its computation becomes rapidly intractable as soon as the
number of neurons and memory depth increases.
Clearly, (58) is precisely the form of potential which is obtained under the maximal entropy principle,
where the φl ’s are constraints of type “neuron k1 is firing at time n1 , neuron k2 is firing at time n2 , . . . “
and the λl ’s the conjugated Lagrange multipliers. Thus, using the maximal entropy principle to characterize
spike statistics in the gIF model by expressing constraints in terms of spike events (monomials), one can at
best find an approximation which can be rather bad, especially if those constraints focus on instantaneous
spike patterns (D = 0) or short memory patterns. Moreover, increasing the memory depth to approach

−1
Hence it is not a constant but a function of the past ω−D
, in a similar way to statistical physics on lattices where the partition
function depends on the boundary conditions. Only in the case D = 0 (memory less) is this a constant.

32

better the right statistics leads to an exponential increase in the number of monomials which becomes
rapidly intractable. Finally, the Lagrange multipliers λl are rather difficult to interpret.
On the opposite, the analytic form (55) depends only on a finite numbers of parameters (γ) constraining
the neural network dynamics, which have a straightforward interpretations being physical quantities. This
shows that, at least in gIF model, the linear Gibbs potential (58) obtained from the maximal entropy
principle is not really appropriate, even for empirical/numerical purposes, and that a form (55) where the
−1
−1
infinite memory ω−∞
is replaced by ω−D
could be more efficient although nonlinear.

To finish this section let us discuss the link with Ising model in light of the present work. Ising model
corresponds to a memory-less case, hence to D = 0. Since the causal structure of the Gibbs potential
forbids monomials of the form ωk1 (0) . . . ωkr (0), the D = 0 expansion of the gIF-Gibbs potential
PN
corresponds to a Bernoulli distribution where neurons are independent φ(0) ( 0, ω ) = k=1 λk ωk (0). The
Ising model is therefore irrelevant to approximate the exact potential of gIF model, if one wants to

reproduce spike statistics at the minimal discretisation time scale δ without considering memory effects.
However, in real data analysis people are usually binning data, with a time windows of width w ∼ 10 − 20
ms. Binning consists of recoding the raster plot with spikes amalgamation. The binned raster b consists of
“spikes” bk (n) ∈ { 0, 1 } where bk (n) = 1 if neuron k fired at least once in the time window [nw, (n + 1)w[.
In the expansion (57) this corresponds to collecting all monomials corresponding to bk (n) = 1 in a unique
monomial. In this way, the binned potential contains indeed an Ising term . . . that mixes all spike events
occurring within the time interval w. These events appear simultaneous because of binning, leading to the
Ising pairwise term bk1 (0)bk2 (0) while events occurring on smaller time scales are scrambled by this
procedure.
The binning effect on Gibbs potential requires however a more detailed description. This will be discussed
elsewhere.

Discussion.

To conclude this paper we would like to discuss several consequences and possible extensions of this work.

9.1

The spike time discretisation

In gIF model membrane potential evolves continuously while conductance are updated with spike
occurrence considered as discrete events. Here we discuss this time discretisation. Actually, there are two
distinct questions.

33

9.1.1 The limit of time-bin tending to 0
This limit would correspond to a case where spike is instantaneous and modeled by a Dirac distribution.
As discussed in [32] this limit raises serious difficulties. To summarize, in real neurons firing occurs within
a finite time δ corresponding to the time of raise and fall for the membrane potential. This involves
physico-chemical processes which cannot be instantaneous. The time curse of the membrane potential
during the spike is described by differential equations, like Hodgkin-Huxley’s [35]. Although, the time scale
dt appearing in the differential equations has the mathematical meaning of being arbitrary small, on
biophysical grounds this time scale cannot be arbitrary small, otherwise the Hodgkin-Huxley equations
loose their meaning. Indeed, they correspond to an average over microscopic phenomena such as ionic
channels dynamics. In particular, their time scale must be sufficiently large to ensure that the description
of ionic channels dynamics (opening and closing) in terms of probabilities is valid so dt must be larger than
the characteristic time of opening-closing of ionic channels τP . Additionally, Hodgkin-Huxley’s equations
uses a Markovian approach (master equation) for the dynamics of h, m, n gates. This requires that the
characteristic time dt is quite a bit larger than the characteristic time of decay for the time correlations
between gates activity τC . Summarizing, we must have 0 < τC , τP < dt < δ. Thus, on biophysical grounds
δ cannot be arbitrary small.
In our case, the δ → 0 limit is armless however, provided we keep a non zero refractory period, ensuring
that only finitely many spikes occur in a finite time interval. Taking the limit δ → 0 without considering a
refractory period raises mathematical problems. One can in principle have uncountably many spikes in a
finite time interval leading to the divergence of physical quantities like energy. Also, one can generate nice
causal paradoxes [43]. Take a loop with two neurons one excitatory and one inhibitory and assume
instantaneous propagation (the α profile is then represented by a Dirac distribution). Then, depending on
the synaptic weights value one can have a situation where neuron 1 fires instantaneously, and make
instantaneously 2 firing which prevents instantaneously 1 from firing and so on. So taking the limit δ → 0
as well as τref r → 0 induces pathologies not inherent to our approach but to IF models.
9.1.2 Synchronisation for distinct neurons.
There is a more subtle issue pointed out in [57]. We do not only discretize time for each neuron’ spikes, we
align the spikes emitted by distinct neurons on a discrete time grid, as an experimental raster does. As
shown in [32] this induces, in gIF models with a purely deterministic dynamics (no noise and reset to a
constant value), an artificial synchronisation. As a consequence the deterministic dynamics of gIF models
34

has generically only stable periodic orbits, although periods can be larger than any accessible
computational time in a specific region of the parameters space. Additionally, these periods increase as δ
decreases. The addition of noise on dynamics and on the reset value, as we propose in this paper, removes
this synchronization effect.

9.2

Refractory period

In the definition of the model we have assumed that the refractory period τref was smaller than 1. The
consequence for raster plots is that one can have two consecutive 1’s in the spike sequence of a neuron. The
extension to the case where τref > 1 is straightforward for spike statistics. Having such a refractory period
forbids some sequences. For example if 1 < τref ≤ 2 then all sequences containing two consecutive 1’s for
one neuron (1, 1) are forbidden. If 2 < τref ≤ 3 sequences containing 1, ∗, 1 for a given neuron, where
∗ = 0, 1, are forbidden, and so on. More generally, the procedure consisting of forbidding specific (finite)
spike blocks is equivalent to introducing a grammar in the spike generation. This grammar can be
implemented in the Gibbs potential: forbidden sequences have a potential equal to −∞ (resp. a zero
probability). In this case, X = AIZ , the set of all possible rasters, becomes a subset where forbidden
sequences have been removed.

9.3

Beyond IF models

Let us now discuss the extension of the present work to more general models of neurons. First, one
characteristic feature of Integrate-and-Fire models is the reset which has the consequence that the memory
of activity preceding the spike is lost after reset. Although in the deterministic (noiseless) case this is a
simplifying feature allowing for example to fully characterize the asymptotic dynamics of (discrete-time) IF
models [32, 59], here it somewhat renders more complex the analysis. Indeed, it led us to introduce the
notion of “last reset” time and, at some point in the proof (see e.g. eq. (39)), obliged us to consider several
situations (e.g. τk (t, ω) ≥ t − m or τk (t, ω ′ ) ≥ t − m versus τk (t, ω) < t − m and τk (t, ω ′ ) < t − m in the
proof of continuity, section 6). On the opposite, considering a model where no such reset occur would
simply lead us to consider a model where τk (t, ω) → −∞, ∀ω, ∀k. This case is already considered in our
formalism, and actually, considering that τk (t, ω) → −∞, ∀ω, ∀k simplifies the proofs (for example it
eliminates the second term in eq. (39)).
As a matter of fact, the theorems established in this paper should therefore also hold without reset. But
this requires to replace the firing condition (4) by another condition stating what the membrane potential

35

does during the spike. Although, it could be possible to propose an ad hoc form for the spike, it would
certainly be more interesting to extend the results here to models where neurons activity depends on
additional variables such as adaptation currents, as in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model [36, 37, 45, 46], or
activation-inactivation variables as in the Hodgkin-Huxley model [35].
The present formalism affords an extension toward such models, where the neuron fires whenever its
membrane potential belongs to a region of the phase space, which can be delimited by membrane
potentials plus additional variables such as adaptation currents or activation-inactivation variables, and
where the spike is controlled by the global dynamics of all these variables. But, while here the firing of a
neuron is described by the crossing of a fixed threshold, in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model it is given by the
crossing of a separatrix in the plane (voltage-adaptation current), and by a more complex “frontier” in the
Hodgkin-Huxley model [3, 38]. One difficulty is to precisely define this region. To our knowledge there is no
clear agreement for the Hodgkin-Huxley model (some authors [3] even suggest that the “spike region”
could have a fractal frontier). The extension toward FitzHugh-Nagumo seems more manageable.
Finally, the most important difficulty toward extending this paper results to more realistic neural networks
is the definition of the synaptic spike response. In IF models the spike is thought as a punctual “event”
(typically, an “instantaneous” pulse) while the synaptic response is described by a convolution kernel (the
α-profile). This leads one to consider a somewhat artificial mixed dynamics where membrane potential
evolves continuously while spike are discrete events. In more realistic models, one would have to consider
kinetic equations for neurotransmitter release, receptor binding and opening of post-synaptic ionic
channels [6, 48]. Additionally, the consideration of these mechanics deserves a spatially extended modelling
of the neuron, with time delays. In this case, all variables evolve continuously and the statistics of spike
trains would be characterized by the statistics of return times in the “spike region”. This statistics is
induced by some probability measure in the phase space; a natural candidate would be the
Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure [60–62], for stationary dynamics, or the time-dependent SRB measure for
non-stationary cases, as defined e.g. in [63]. These measures are Gibbs measures as well [64]. Here, the
main mathematical property ensuring existence and uniqueness of such a measure would be uniform
hyperbolicity. To our knowledge conditions ensuring such a property in networks has not been established
yet neither for Hodgkin-Huxley’s nor for FitzHugh-Nagumo’s models.

36

9.4

Synaptic plasticity

As the results established in this paper hold for any synaptic weight value in H, they hold as well for
networks underlying synaptic plasticity mechanisms. The effects of a joint evolution of spikes dynamics,
depending on synaptic weights distributions, and synaptic weights evolution depending on spike dynamics
has been studied in [65]. In particular it has been shown that mechanisms such as Spike-Time Dependent
Plasticity are related to a variational principle for a quantity, the topological pressure, derived for the
thermodynamic formalism of Gibbs distributions. In the paper [65] the fact that spike trains statistics were
given by a Gibbs distribution was a working assumption. Therefore, the present work establish a firm
ground for [65].
