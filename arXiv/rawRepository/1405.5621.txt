The design and synthesis of complex and large mimicked biochemical networks de novo is an unsolved problem in
synthetic biology. To address this limitation without resorting to ad hoc computations and experiments, a predictive
mathematical theory is required to reduce these complex chemical networks into natural physico-chemical
expressions. Here we provide a theory that offers a physico-chemical expression for a large chemical network that is
almost arbitrarily both nonlinear and complex. Unexpectedly, the theory demonstrates that such networks can be
decomposed into reactions based solely on the Hill equation, a simple chemical logic gate. This theory, analogous to
implemented electrical logic gates or functional algorithms in a computer, is proposed for implementing regulated
sequences of functional chemical reactions, such as mimicked genes, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction,
protein interaction, and metabolic networks, into an artificial designed chemical network.
guaranteed to be able to synthesize an arbitrarily desired de
novo large working biochemical network, which will be
nonlinear and complex. Therefore, the development of a
unified, holistic and predictive theory capable of dissecting an
arbitrary, large, nonlinear, and complex chemical network into
a set of natural physico-chemical expressions is anticipated.

INTRODUCTION
A living cell is one of if not the most complex functional
chemical networks known to exist. This network consists of
biomolecules including genes, transcripts, proteins,
polysaccharides, lipids, and metabolites interacting in a
solution of water and ions. The emulation of such a system
through de novo synthesis of a synthetic biochemical network
that can mimic a living cell or complex cellular processes is
one of the main goals of synthetic biology (Benner and
Sismour, 2005; Elowitz and Lim, 2010; Khalil and Collins,
2010; Kwok, 2010; Purnick and Weiss, 2009; Way et al.,
2014). The successful development of such a system, a
completely designed and constructed artificial cell, will be a
major scientific accomplishment. There have already been
many successful examples in both theoretical (Alon, 2007;
Karr et al., 2012; Savageau, 1969; Tomita et al., 1999) and
experimental advancements (Alon, 2007; Annaluru et al.,
2014; Becskei and Serrano, 2000; Deans et al., 2007; Elowitz
and Leibler, 2000; Gardner et al., 2000; Gibson et al., 2010) in
which whole-cell computation (Karr et al., 2012) and the
synthetic genome (Annaluru et al., 2014; Gibson et al., 2010)
have been rigorously pursued towards this accomplishment.
Savageau’s Biochemical Systems Theory (BST)
(Savageau, 1969) describes a large biochemical network in a
unified way. It includes mathematical models, the S-system
and the generalized mass action (GMA) system. These models
have been successfully applied to many studies with their
advantages in simplicity and generality (Alvarez-Vasquez et
al., 2005; Savageau, 1976; Voit and Radivoyevitch, 2000).
Specifically, the BST is the only theory, to our knowledge,
that has been mathematically demonstrated to be able to
describe almost arbitrarily nonlinear chemical systems, using
the so-called canonical form (Savageau and Voit, 1987).
However, there are also some known limitations such as the
concept of operating points (Savageau, 1969) or regenerated
artificial variables in the canonical forms. Thus there has
never been a proposed mathematical theory for describing an
arbitrarily nonlinear, and complex chemical network that can
always be naturally interpreted with a physico-chemical
expression. This means that synthetic biologists are not

mathematical formula can be applied to a theory of the
theoretical design of complex chemical networks. The theory
we describe here concludes that each of all the chemical
reactions included in chemical networks that are almost
arbitrarily both nonlinear and complex can be synthesized
based solely on the Hill equation (Hill, 1910), a simple
chemical logic gate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Decomposition of complex chemical networks
Here we propose a mathematical theory based on the Hill
equation (Hill function) (Hill, 1910), a simple chemical logic
gate, for helping in the design of the theoretical and
experimental synthesis of a de novo large working chemical
network that is almost arbitrarily nonlinear and complex (Fig.

provided that 𝑅𝑖 ({0, ⋯ ,0}) = 0 can be approximated with
any level of precision by:

1.). In a general sense, this theory states that a mixture of
chemical reactions, each described by the Hill functions, can
be used to describe any set of interrelated chemical processes.
More specifically, this theory is embodied in the following
mathematical statement:

Figure 1. Physico-chemical interpretation of the
theory. It concludes that almost any complex chemical
networks can be artificially synthesized in principle.
The theory guarantees superposition of the Hill
functions, the mixture of reactive chemical substances
in sigmoidal reactions can be an almost arbitrarily
nonlinear and complex chemical network. Note that all
the substrate axes X in the figure are logarithmic. (A)
Simple chemical reaction rates (s) such as a product
from a substrate (X). The rates can diverge. (B) A simple
sigmoidal reaction rate described by the Hill function
with  = 1. It has a saturated rate (smax). A sigmoidal
reaction is regarded as a chemical logic gate. It
gradually switches on or off, depending on whether the
reaction rate is greater or less than the substrate
threshold , respectively. A chemical logic gate can
transfer chemical information. An example of the
chemical logic gate is a Michaelis-Menten reaction
(below), of which the Hill coefficient  is 1. Note that
the substrate axis is logarithmic and thus the curve is
sigmoidal, which is not usual for drawing the
Michaelis-Menten reaction. (C) Sigmoidal reaction rates
can be steep with higher Hill coefficients. A steep
reaction rate with  = 4 (blue) and Michaelis-Menten
rate with  = 1 (light gray) are shown. Ideally, the rate
becomes a discrete digital switch (the Heaviside step
function, mathematically,) with  = infinity (red line).
An example of the steep chemical logic gate is a tetrameric substrate-enzyme complex that produces a product only after the same four
substrates bind (below) in which  = 4 ideally. (D) An example of a more intricate nonlinear rate. It can be the sum of four different sigmoidal
reaction rates (upper, red, blue, pink, and yellow lines). The superposition can be physico-chemically interpreted by a supramolecular catalyst
(lower). It consists of four loosely linked molecular complexes (red, blue, pink, and yellow multiple enzymes, lower) in which each complex has
a different Hill coefficient and direction for the chemical reaction (white arrows, lower; + and –, next to the colored lines, upper) but the same
product. (E) An example of a heterotetrameric complex that binds two X1, one X2, and one X3 substrates (lower) respectively. Each of the binding
sites has 1 = 2, 2 = 1, or3 = 1 and the heterotetramer produces a product only after binding all the substrates. It corresponds to a direct
product with N of 3 in Eq. 5. The shape of the nonlinear curve in (D) is supposed to be kept in the X1 axis (upper) but it is totally on or off
depending on X2 with a threshold 2 (dotted line in the X1-X2 plane, upper), which corresponds to the direct product between X1 and X2 terms in
Eq. 5. (F) An example of an imaginary synthesized chemical network composed of 7 substrates with fixed catalysts (lower). This system can be
described by the unified mathematical expression, Eqs. 4 and 5, in the same manner. The design of the chemical network can be achieved by
drawing orbits and rates at all the points in the 7-dimensional substrate concentration space (upper, red and white arrows are examples of orbits).
Only one rate should exist at any point in the space (This property is called autonomous). This drawing can be converted to Eq. 3 and then to the
real constants in Eqs. 4 and 5 that are guaranteed to exist by the theory. The constants are supposed to be acquired in the chemical network
(lower) in the dissociation constants, Hill coefficients, and saturated rates. (G) Further interpretation makes possible the synthesis of a large
chemical network that is almost arbitrarily nonlinear and complex. It can acquire any number of components (upper left, e.g., X10000), any orbits
and rates (red arrow), and diverse chemical reactions (background) based on an expression Eq. 4 (center). The Eq. 4 is the linear combination of
Eq. 5, a direct product of the Hill functions. The Eq. 5 is a nonlinear and basic chemical logic gate.

The theory is simply derived by replacing, in Eq. 3,
derivatives with real constants, integrals with summations,
and the Heaviside step functions with the Hill functions,
respectively, since the derivatives are constant real values at
the specific values of 𝜇 , a summation approximates to
integrals, and the Hill function approximates to the Heaviside
step function. The importance of this theory is not the
replacement of mathematics but is the finding of a unified,
holistic and predictive theory capable of dissecting an
arbitrary, large, nonlinear, and complex chemical network into
a set of phenomenological physico-chemical expressions,
which first gives synthetic biologists the theoretical basis of
syntheses of arbitrarily desired de novo large working
mimicked chemical networks, which will be nonlinear and
complex.
The theory shows that Eq. 3, which can
phenomenologically represent almost any chemical system, is
equivalent to Eqs. 4 and 5, which represent an artificial
synthesized chemical system described by the Hill functions
(the word “almost” means that the right-hand sides of Eq. 3
are a type of derivable and continuous functions. The
definition is strictly described elsewhere (Chikayama, 2014).)
The linear combinations in Eq. 4 are simply the mixture of the
chemical substances or supramolecular catalysts representing
the artificially synthesized chemical system.

dissociation constant, and cooperativity (or Hill coefficient). A
Hill coefficient ideally becomes n in the reaction 𝐸 + 𝑛 ×
𝑋 ↔ 𝐸𝑌 → 𝐸 + 𝑃 in which an enzyme E and n molecules of
substrate X produce a product P through an
enzyme-n-substrates complex EY (Fig. 1B (n = 1) and Fig. 1C
(n = 4)). It is well known, however, that in practice a Hill
coefficient is a fractional (not only integer but also real) value
(Weiss, 1997), which is preferable for our theory. In general,
larger values of Hill coefficients indicate higher cooperativity,
or more highly digitized behaviors for information processing
(Shinohara et al., 2014). In this way Eqs. 4 and 5 can describe
a more intricate nonlinearity. For example, suppose there
exists a reaction with a net rate R that exhibits a strongly
nonlinear dependence upon the substrate concentration X
(Fig. 1D, upper, black solid line) described by the right-hand
side of Eq. 3, R(X). From the theory, we can decompose it into
a linear combination of the Hill functions using Eqs. 4 and 5
(Fig. 1D, upper, red, blue, pink, and yellow solid lines). In
sum, these colored lines are equal to the black solid line that
represents the net reaction rate R(X). Additionally those
colored lines are all logic gates (individual examples shown in
Fig. 1B and C, lower) that can be physico-chemically
(mathematically) interpreted as a molecular complex of
cooperative enzymes (logic gates), that result in the net rate
and, for example, together act as a supramolecular catalyst
(Fig. 1D, lower). The superimposition of these four molecular
complexes results in the complicated net rate reaction R(X)
(Fig. 1D, upper, black solid line). Further, a multidimensional
(direct product) form of the Hill functions, Eq. 5, represents
simultaneous or sequential bindings of multiple distinct
substrates or ligands (Fig. 1E, bottom, green objects labeled
X1-X3) before enzymatic activity (Cornish-Bowden, 2004)
(Fig. 1E, P, white). In this case, the axis X as shown in
Fig. 1D (upper) is extended to three axes X1-X3 in Fig. 1E
(upper). Such an interpretation can easily be extended even
further to a more complicated system containing
supramolecular catalysts, multiple enzymes, substrates, and
ligands like a circuit consisting of many wired chemical logic
gates (Fig. 1F), all under the same mathematical expressions
given in Eqs. 4 and 5. In this latter complex case (Fig. 1F),
whereas the axes are extended to X1-X7, there are many of
multiple reaction rates and thus the axis R as in Fig. 1E is
avoided, which is a standard way of describing a dynamical
system.
The design of a complex chemical network using
this theory is performed as an inverse problem. If a designer
wants to predict how a chemical network will behave from
given initial conditions, they should draw orbits in a
coordinate space (specifically, state or phase space) from their
starting points (e.g., Fig. 1F, upper, red and white orbits). A
point in the phase space represents a set of specific
concentrations of all the constituent chemical substances.
Thus the number of dimensions in the phase space is equal to
be the number of substances {𝑋1 , ⋯ , 𝑋𝑁 } being modeled. The
multiple starting points correspond to multiple initial
conditions. The orbits correspond to the desired dynamics in
the concentrations of the constituents. Once all orbits are
drawn, a point on any given orbit uniquely determines the
concentrations of all the substances {𝑋1 , ⋯ , 𝑋𝑁 } in the
system. Additionally, the designer should determine the rate of
the instant direction of the orbit at that point. It corresponds to
give a rate vector at that point. In this manner, designing
desired orbits and then determining the rate vector at each of

Synthetic biologist can synthesize arbitrarily mimicked
chemical networks
The theory is to our knowledge the first mathematical theory
that in principle guarantees the synthesis of a chemical
network that is almost arbitrarily nonlinear and complex based
solely on physico-chemically interpretable equations.
Moreover, because arbitrarily nonlinear chemical networks
can implement arbitrarily logical algorithms (logically
designed sequences of chemical reactions), it implies that
biochemical networks in living organisms can also implement
almost any functional algorithm (analogous to a computer
being able to implement almost any functional programs), at
least for a spatially-homogeneous mixture in a local region
inside a cell. The similar point was proposed by Bray using
examples
of
aspartate
transcarbamoylase,
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, glycogen
synthase, or a protein circuit mediating chemotactic responses
of coliform bacteria (Bray, 1995). The concept is recently
summarized as a computer in every living cell (Bray, 2009).
Theoretical design of complex chemical networks
The theory includes the concepts to allow for the design of an
almost arbitrarily nonlinear chemical network. With this
theory, a complex chemical network can be dissected into a
set of physico-chemical expressions using only the equivalent
concepts: the Hill function and chemical logic gate. Figure 1
details this principle conceptually. In a simple chemical
reaction a substrate changes to a product with the reaction rate
monotonically dependent on the concentration of the substrate
(Fig. 1A), whereas the Hill function exhibits strong
nonlinearity, i.e., a sigmoidal reaction (Figs. 1B and C. Note
that all the substrate axes X in the figure are logarithmic). The
sigmoidal reaction in a chemical system can be interpreted as
an analog switch (Daniel et al., 2013) or as a basic chemical
logic gate. In the Hill function, all the constants 𝛼𝑖𝑗 , 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑘 , and
𝛽𝑖𝑗𝑘 in Eqs. 4 and 5 represent physico-chemically meaningful
phenomenological parameters, i.e., a saturated reaction rate,

3

the points on all the orbits in the phase space are equal to
drawing all the orbits and rate vectors in the phase space in
bi-infinite time (specifically, the set of rate vectors is a vector
field in the phase space). Note that the designer can choose a
favorable length of the rate vector at the point on an orbit
keeping the instant direction, and all the designed orbits
cannot cross each other. All the specific drawn orbits and rate
vectors totally correspond to a set of specific nonlinear
functions, and thus can be expressed by Eq. 3. Using the
theory, it can be converted to Eqs. 4 and 5, which have
specific parameters. The set of Eqs. 4 and 5 is a mixture of
reactively interrelated chemical constituents described by
sigmoidal reactions, i.e., functionally wired chemical logic
gates. This is the design of a chemical network using the
theory. Specifically, the design of all orbits and rate vectors in
the phase space corresponds to the unique determination of
the right-hand side of Eq. 3. Because Eqs. 4 and 5
approximate to Eq. 3, the set of Eqs. 4 and 5 that have specific
parameters is the blueprint of the chemical network. It is
noteworthy that the theory does not limit the number of
components in a given system; consequently a large chemical
network that is almost arbitrarily nonlinear and complex can
be designed at will (Fig. 1G) by using Eqs. 4 and 5, in
principle. Since Eq. 4 is described without Cartesian space
coordinates, an easy extension of Eq. 4 may be used to include
elements of diffusive factors Di into a system,

with a variety of the Hill functions or sigmoid functions. The
use of analogues of Eqs. 4 and 5 has been a known empirical
approach aimed at analyzing a large biochemical network
such as a transcriptional regulatory or signal transduction
network (Aldridge et al., 2006; de Jong, 2002); the
fundamental basis of these empirical approaches can be given
by this theory.
Practically the theory, as presented here, is not
intended for describing the complexity of a real living system.
Rather the intent is to promote the development of synthetic
chemical networks that can mimic living systems. An example
of the method for synthesized mimics of chemical reactions in
living systems, where our theory is combined with Darwinian
evolutionary theory, can be in principle used to evolve large
(in vitro or in silico) chemical networks. Networks are initially
(experimentally or computationally) synthesized as in Eqs. 4
and 5 with diverse constants N, 𝛼𝑖𝑗 , 𝜇𝑖𝑗𝑘 , and 𝛽𝑖𝑗𝑘 ; and can
then be ‘evolved’ through mimicked phenotypic effects of
mutation (by perturbing or altering the desired constants) and
natural selection (by selecting the best ‘mutants’ by some
objective criteria) towards the ‘fitter’ constants. This can be
done repeatedly. Ultimately, the experimental synthesis of
complex chemical networks that incorporate tremendous
numbers of chemical molecules as mimics of functions in
living systems through theoretical design will offer important
clues in the quest of understanding ‘what life is’ in
physico-chemical language (Schrödinger, 1944).

The Hill equation was established in 1910 by A. V.
Hill to describe a sigmoidal reaction on saturated hemoglobins
by dioxygen (Hill, 1910) and well-known examples of such
sigmoidal reactions in living systems are the rate of mRNA
production vs. the concentration of transcription factors
(Ackers et al., 1982; Gardner et al., 2000; Yagil and Yagil,
1971), the rate for certain types of allosteric enzymes vs.
substrate concentration (Hammes and Wu, 1974), tension in
cardiac muscle vs. noradrenaline concentration (Reuter, 1974),
and the firing rate of a neuron vs. synaptic input potential
(McCulloch and Pitts, 1943; Silver, 2010). Protein circuits

are examples of critical components for maintaining living

mechanisms of genetic networks. The formalization of a
