Abstract
Agent-based stochastic models for finite populations have recently received much attention in
the game theory of evolutionary dynamics. Both the ultimate fixation and the pre-fixation transient behavior are important to a full understanding of the dynamics. In this paper, we study the
transient dynamics of the well-mixed Moran process through constructing a landscape function. It
is shown that the landscape playing a central theoretical “device” that integrates several lines of
inquiries: the stable behavior of the replicator dynamics, the long-time fixation, and continuous
diffusion approximation associated with asymptotically large population. Several issues relating to
the transient dynamics are discussed: 1) Multiple time scales phenomenon associated with intraand inter-attractoral dynamics; 2) discontinuous transition in stochastically stationary process akin
to Maxwell construction in equilibrium statistical physics; and 3) the dilemma diffusion approximation facing as a continuous approximation of the discrete evolutionary dynamics. It is found
that rare events with exponentially small probabilities, corresponding to the uphill movements and
barrier crossing in the landscape with multiple wells that are made possible by strong nonlinear
dynamics, plays an important role in understanding the origin of the complexity in evolutionary,
nonlinear biological systems.

INTRODUCTION

One of the salient features of the stochastic evolutionary game dynamics for finite populations is the fixation [1–3]. That is, no matter how the initial strategies are distributed
in a population, the system will eventually be fixated to only one strategy. In general, this
phenomenon can be theoretically explained in terms of a Markov process with absorbing
state(s) [4, 5]: The limiting theory of Markov processes tells us that the finite-state Markov
chains with absorbing states will eventually be trapped into one of the absorbing states
as time passes. The well-known Wright-Fisher model [6, 7], Moran process [8, 9] and the
pairwise comparison processes [10, 11] all belong to this class. A further classification of Darwinian selection scenarios based on the fixation descriptions has already been established in
stochastic game dynamics [12–17]. Another important class consists of evolutionary dynamics with mutations where an ergodic mutation-selection equilibrium can be reached [18–20].
The latter is out of the scope of our study; However, the landscape introduced in the present
work provides a unified perspective for both classes of processes.
In addition to the ultimate fixation, attention should also be paid to the time-dependent,
pre-fixation transient behavior for several reasons [21–23]: On one hand, the process to
fixation is intimately dependent upon both the transient movements before absorption and
the one last step to fixation. That is, studying the transient dynamics provides important
insights into the final fixation behavior. On the other hand, sometimes the time for a true
fixation is too long to be observed [13] and the relevant time scale can be shorter [24–26].
In this case, the transient dynamics provides a more appropriate description. Furthermore,
examinations of transients can yield a mechanistic understanding of the persistence and
coexistence in complex biological dynamics, especially in ecosystems [27]. Indeed, it has
been found that the pre-fixation transient dynamics could be an essential explanatory aspect
of characterizing the stochastic fluctuations raised from finite populations [28–32].
The theory of quasi-stationarity is a widely applied, standard technique of studying the
pre-fixation process [33]. It defines the subchain with the absorbing states removed. Based
on this approach, we present an extended analysis for the transient dynamics of the wellmixed frequency-dependent Moran process. An ergodic conditional stationary distribution
is used to characterize the pre-fixation process. As a result of the law of large numbers, this
stationary distribution approaches to a singular distribution in the infinite population limit.
2

The corresponding large deviation rate function [34–36], which is population-size independent, is shown to be a landscape. This transient landscape has a Lyapunov property with
respect to the corresponding deterministic replicator dynamics, providing a potential-like
function for visualizing the transient stochastic dynamics. Ideas related to the transient
landscape of Moran process have been discussed in the past: Claussen and Traulsen [29]
studied non-Gaussian stochastic fluctuations based on the conditional stationary distribution. It is also a general feeling that one can use the negative logarithm of the stationary,
or conditional stationary distribution as the potential in evolutionary dynamics, following
an analogue to Boltzmann’s law in statistical mechanics. However, it is important to point
out that a stationary distribution usually collapses to singular supports in the infinite population limit, while our large deviation rate function ψ(x) is supported on the whole space
and it is independent of system’s size. Therefore, in terms of the analogue to Boltzmann’s
law, we are effectively identifying the system’s size as the inversed temperature which tends
to infinity for a deterministic limit.
Even though our analysis is based on the one-dimensional Moran process, this idea is
general. It can be applied to many other multi-dimensional evolutionary game dynamics
with finite populations, with or without detailed balance [37]. For the latter case, the landscape itself is an emergent property of the dynamics. With respect to Moran process, [3, 13]
also discovered the expression of ψ(x) from a different origin, via their approximated calculation of fixation probability for large population size. We shall show that this connection
is a nice mathematical property of the ψ(x) function for the processes in one-dimensional
case, but its generalization to multi-dimensional cases is not obvious. More specifically,
for multi-dimensional systems with multiple alleles, the fixation probability does not naturally give a landscape. The large deviation rate function, however, can be generalized to
multi-dimensional Markov processes, as indicated by the Freidlin-Wentzell theory [34]. The
landscape we introduced is also consistent with the landscape theory for other population
dynamics, e.g., chemical, that is ergodic without fixation [37, 38].
There are two fundamentally different types of movements in this landscape that require
separated attention. (i) “Downhill movements” which have deterministic counterparts: The
local minima (transient attractors) in this landscape correspond to the stable points in the
replicator dynamics [39]. That is, these transient attractors are in direct agreement with the
evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) [40, 41]. (ii) “Uphill movements” which are rare and
3

without a deterministic correspondence. In general, rare events take exponentially long time;
one needs to take multiple time scales into consideration in understanding the appropriate
fluctuation descriptions for the transient dynamics as well as eventual fixation. This is
particularly relevant in the anti-coordination games.
Furthermore, the concept of stochastic bistability is studied in the coordination games. In
this case, the downhill and uphill movements in the landscape dominate “intra-attractoral”
and “inter-attractoral” dynamics respectively [37]. It is shown that a Maxwell-type construction from classic phase transition theory in statistical physics [42] is necessary as the
population size tends to infinity, i.e., only one of attractors should be singled out in such a
construction — It corresponds to the global minimum of the landscape. This is not present
in the bistable deterministic dynamics; it raises the novel issue of ultimate fixation. It did
not escape our notice that it is the exponentially long-time search that ultimately finds the
global minimum in a “non-convex optimization” [43].
Another important issue directly relating to the transient dynamics is the diffusion approximation [44–46]. With the conventional truncation of Kramers-Moyal (KM) expansion,
the discrete stochastic Moran process for large populations has been approximated by a
stochastic differential equation [47, 48], with absorbing Dirichlet boundary conditions. If
one replaces the absorbing boundary conditions with the reflecting ones, we can also derive
an ergodic stationary distribution from the Fokker-Planck equation of this diffusion process.
It will be shown that this stationary distribution is in fact the “conditional” stationary
distribution for the process with absorbing boundary conditions. In a comparison of the
transient dynamics between the original Moran process and its continuous counterpart, it
is shown that even though the KM diffusion is valid in finite time as a local dynamical
approximation, it could lead to incorrect approximation in global inter-attractoral dynamics. In bistable game systems, particularly, the KM diffusion could single out a different
stable point from that of the original process for large but finite populations. Moreover,
enlightened by Hänggi et al.’s work [49], we also consider their diffusion approximation that
provides the correct global dynamics. However, this diffusion process gives incorrect finite
time stochastic dynamics.
Now we have a diffusion’s dilemma: The truncated KM diffusion gives the correct finite
time stochastic dynamics as the original Moran process with large population size (this is
guaranteed both by the so called van Kampen’s system size expansion [50] and Kurtz’s
4

theorem [51, 52]), but wrong stationary distribution. On the other hand, Hänggi et al.’s
diffusion, which is unique in providing the correct stationary distribution as well as deterministic limit, is wrong for the finite time stochastic dynamics. To further illustrate this
diffusion’s dilemma, a simple example is present. By investigating the first passage times, it
is found that the failure of exponential approximation in the uphill movement could be the
origin of the difficulties of diffusion approximation. In other words, diffusion approximation
is a second-order polynomial expansion for the Kolmogorov forward equation of the original discrete process, which can give the correct Gaussian dynamics near the stable point;
However, the inter-attractoral global dynamics, determined by the barrier crossing events
with exponential small probabilities, should be approximated in the level of exponential
asymptotics.
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we introduce the frequency-dependent
Moran process. Then we give the transient description of the Moran process in Sec. III,
where the transient landscape ψ(x) is constructed. It is shown that this landscape as a “glue”
holds the deterministic replicator dynamics, the fixation and the problem of Maxwell-type
construction together. Diffusion’s dilemma is discussed in Sec. IV. The discussions are
included in the last section.

II.

FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT MORAN PROCESS

To study evolutionary game theory in finite populations, Nowak et al. [9] generalized
Moran’s classical population genetic model [8] by using frequency-dependent fitness. Consider a population of N individuals playing a symmetric 2 × 2 game with strategies A and
B, the payoff matrix is



M =

a b
c d



,

(1)

where all the entries in the matrix are assumed to be non-negative. If i players follow
strategy A, and N − i play B, the the average payoff of an individual of A is
FAi =

a(i − 1) + b(N − i)
,
N −1

(2)

where self-interaction is excluded, and also for B is
FBi =

ci + d(N − i − 1)
.
N −1
5

(3)

Fitness is assumed to be a linear combination of background fitness and the payoff as follows:
fAi = 1 − w + wFAi ,

(4)

fBi = 1 − w + wFBi ,

(5)

where w ∈ [0, 1] denotes the intensity of selection.
At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce proportional to its fitness, then
the offspring replaces a randomly chosen individual, so that the population size is constant.
The evolutionary mechanism in this Moran process, thus, can be conveniently described as
a Markov chain. If we denote X as the the number of individuals following strategy A,
then X is actually a finite-state birth-death process with discrete-time steps, which can be
expressed as follows:

Ti− = P (i → i − 1) =

Ti0 = P (i → i) = 1 − Ti+ − Ti− .

So the Markov transition probability matrix of this process can be denoted as

(9)

It is easy to see that X = 0 and N are two absorbing boundaries for the system, so the
limiting distribution of the Moran process can be denoted as
(1 − ρi )δ0 + ρi δN ,

(10)

where ρi is the fixation probability that i individuals of strategy A succeed in taking over
the entire population, and δ0 (or δN ) is a Dirac mass at 0 (or N). In other words, except
6

for the two pure-strategic absorbing states, all the mixed states are transient. This process
is different from an irreducible Markov chain whose ergodic behavior is supported on the
whole state space. Thus in the Moran process, it is natural to investigate the conditions for
selection to favor successful fixation by calculating the corresponding fixation probabilities
[12].

III.

TRANSIENT ANALYSIS

The fixation is intimately dependent upon the transient behavior before absorption. To
show this, we shall divide the process to fixation into two parts: One is the irreducible
transitions among the transient states before absorption, the other is the last step to fixation.
This distinction has a very clear evolutionary meaning: the former is a consequence of “global
dynamics” while the latter is a rather local event. It is also worth mentioning that these
two scenarios correspond so-called “golf-course search” and “funnel perspective” in the field
of protein folding [53]. By explicitly studying these two different problems, one is able to
address the “dynamic nature of fixation”: Is the dynamics toward fixation inherent in the
evolutionary dynamics? The investigation of the transients provides another perspective to
understand the fixation. Further, in order to describe the inherent fluctuations arising from
finite populations, the transient dynamics has been proved to be an essential explanatory
aspect [29, 30].

A.

Conditional stationary distribution and the transient landscape

A natural mathematical idea to describe the transient behavior is to concentrate on the
distribution conditional on the subspace of the mix-strategic states [33]. We consider an
auxiliary process X ∗ (t) close to the original Moran process X(t). X ∗ (t) can be described
as the original process with the absorbing states removed, while all other birth and death
probabilities remain unchanged [33, 54]. So the process of X ∗ (t) can be expressed as

The interpretation of η for the transient description of the original process X(t) is from
the theory of quasi-stationarity [26]. It is shown that η characterizes the occupation time
distribution of the process before absorption, i.e. ηi is the average times of visiting to i
divided by the mean absorbing time (see appendix A). So we call η the conditional stationary
distribution of the original process.

x(1 − x)(1 − w + w(cx + d(1 − x)))
.
x(1 − w + w(ax + b(1 − x))) + (1 − x)(1 − w + w(cx + d(1 − x)))

(14)

We term ψ(x) as the transient landscape, which will be shown to be of great importance
in characterizing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. It should be mentioned that
our definition of the transient landscape can be extended to more general dynamics with
multiple populations (see appendix B). An relation between ψ(x) and fixation probabilities
in [3, 13] will be given in Eq. (16) (Also see appendix D).
For the replicator equation
dx(t)
= x(1 − x)[((a − b)x + b) − ((c − d)x + d)],
dt
8

It is easy to check that
dψ(x) dx

1 − w + w((c − d)x + d)

ψ̇(x(t)) =

≤ 0.
So ψ(x) has the Lyapunov property [56, 57], i.e. the dynamical behavior of the replicator
dynamics can be predicted by this transient landscape. Note that by our definition of
ψ(x), the Lyapunov property is nearly transparent, even for multi-dimensional systems (see
appendix B).
We classify the transient landscape into three main generic cases (see Fig. 1):
1) Uni-well : a < c and b > d. ψ(x) decreases on [0, x∗ ] and increases on [x∗ , 1]. Here
x∗ = (d − b)/(a − b − c + d) is the only minimal extreme point.

2) Uni-barrier : a > c and b < d. ψ(x) increases on [0, x∗ ] and decreases on [x∗ , 1]. In

this case, the landscape has two local minimal points at both x = 0 and 1, separated by the
peak at x∗ .
3) Uphill/Downhill : a < c and b < d (or a > c and b > d). In this case, ψ(x) increases
(or decreases) on the whole interval [0, 1]. So x = 1 (or x=0) is the minimal point.
Another seemingly trivial case is when a = c and b = d, which is of limited interest in the
deterministic dynamics. However, this neutral case with flat landscape becomes important
in the context of stochastic dynamics. An interesting result will be obtained for this case in
connection to diffusion approximation (Sec. IV B).
Note that the rescaled conditional stationary distribution η(x) can be expressed as
η(x) ∝ exp{−Nψ(x)},
the landscape ψ(x) visualizes the transient dynamics: The transient system should spend a
majority of time around local minimal point(s) in the landscape. So we term the minimal
point(s) as the transient attractor(s). In the literature of physics, the transient attractor(s)
show the properties of metastablity [58–60]. That is, although the “downhill movement”
towards the local minimum in the landscape maintains the stability of the attractor, the
“uphill movement” of crossing the barrier will drive the system to move from the local
attractor to another on a larger time scale. With this observation, we will discuss the
fixation from the viewpoint of the transient landscape.

B.

The transient landscape and fixation

It is known that the process to fixation is intimately dependent upon both the transient
movements before absorption and the one last step to fixation. Thus we have two cases: First,
the fixation is an inherent result derived directly from the transient process. Second, the
fixation shows distinctly different behavior from the transient process, i.e., the final fixation
does not end up with attractive absorbing, but one last “unnatural” step to fixation.
Based on the different generic cases of the transient landscape, it is found that in the uphill
or downhill case, one of the two absorbing states is located at the transient attractor, we
term this kind of absorbing state as the attractive absorbing state; the other absorbing state
is called as the rare absorbing state. This classification of the absorbing states is directly
linked to the work by Antal et al. [13]. We now denote the probability of fixation at N,
before reaching 0 and starting from the initial state i, by ρi . Similarly, fixation probability
at 0 starting from i is denoted by γi . The explicit expression of ρi , for example, can be
derived from the following difference equation [2]:
ρj = Tj− ρj−1 + (1 − Tj− − Tj+ )ρj + Tj+ ρj+1
with two boundary conditions
ρ0 = 0,
Then we have
ρi =

This result shows that the uphill fixation from N − 1 to 0 is a rare event with exponentially
λ=

small probability, while the downhill fixation from 0 to N − 1 is a rather easy trip. This
corresponds to our “rare” or “attractive” definition of the absorbing states. Similarly, in the
uni-barrier case, both x = 0 and 1 are the attractive absorbing states, whereas the barrier
crossing probability from each side to another is exponentially small.
In the uni-well case, however, the only transient attractor is located at the mixed state
x∗ . In this case, the fixation is not an immediate result of the transient attraction. Antal
et al. [13] shows that the fixation time in this case is exponentially large with population
size N; while in the other two cases the fixation times have the same approximated order
N ln N. This result is also completely in line with our classification of the fixation.
The mismatch between the mixed transient attractor and the final absorbing fixation
leads to multiple time scales issue in the process of evolution. Comparative studies of the
mean first passage time to the attractor x∗ and the fixation time have been carried out in
[32, 40], showing the separation of the transient attractive time scale and the fixation time
scale.
Multiple time scales issue is of great importance in understanding evolutionary systems
[27], especially in explaining the coexistence and extinction of species in ecological systems
[24, 25]. It has been reported that the relevant time scale to explain the coexistence of
species in plankton [24] is found in the short term (within a single season in their models).
The time until species being extinct can be much longer than a single season. Accordingly,
the coexistence can be explained here as a transient phenomenon. The mixed transient
attractor, as the stable equilibrium in the transient dynamics, should be more relevant
within a reasonable time scale. To realize the final fixation, the system has to escape from
the attractor through going uphill on the landscape, collecting many unfavorable moves
consecutively, for an extremely long time.

C.

Stochastic bistability and Maxwell-type construction

Bistability (or multistability) is one of the most interesting phenomena in the nonlinear
systems [45, 57, 61]. For example, consider the replicator dynamics
dx(t)
= x(1 − x)[((a − b)x + b) − ((c − d)x + d)],
dt
bistability arises when a > c and b < d. In this case, x = 0 and 1 are both stable, separated
by the unstable fixed point x∗ = (d − b)/(a − b − c + d). Therefore, the characterizations
of the bistability in the deterministic nonlinear systems should contain two things: One is
where the attractors are, the other is the basins of attraction.
One major problem in evolutionary game theory is the selection of multiple evolutionary
stable strategies [21]. In the bistability case of the deterministic dynamics, the limiting
behavior is determined by its initial state. That is, the measurement of the stability is
closely dependent on the basins of attraction. The stable point with the larger basin of
attraction can be seen as the risk-dominant strategy.
In the context of stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, we can also discuss the noiseinduced bistable phenomenon [61, 62]. The bistability in the replicator dynamics corresponds
to the uni-barrier case in the transient landscape, where both x = 0 and 1 are the local
minimal points in this landscape, separated by the barrier x∗ . We term this case with two
transient attractors as the stochastic bistability. Furthermore, not only does the landscape
cover the characterizations of the bistability in the replicator dynamics, but we can also give
a straightforward comparison to these two stable states based on this landscape. From Eq.

Thereby, even a slight difference between x = 0 and 1 in the transient landscape can leads
to a extreme disparity in the distribution (see Fig. 2). It is observed that except for the
critical case, the system will select only one attractor, the global one, as the unique stable
state with the increase of the population size N [18, 42]. In other words, the Maxwell-type
construction always singles out the global minimum in the system, providing another useful
criterion for the equilibrium selection.

IV.

DIFFUSION’S DILEMMA OF MORAN PROCESS

Discrete Markov chain treatment of biological population systems is necessary for relatively small populations. For large populations it is convenient and desirable to apply
a continuous approximation [63, 64]. Beyond the replicator deterministic dynamics as a
continuous limit, a diffusion-type process has long been much sought after. However, an
important problem arising is the relation between the original discrete Markov chain and
its approximated representation in term of a diffusion process [65]. The perspective of multiple time-scale dynamics in the previous section provides a better understanding of this
important problem.
The insights we gained from the transient descriptions leads naturally to a comparative
study of the original discrete-state Moran process and its continuous-path counterpart.

A.

The Kramers-Moyal expansion and landscape via diffusion approximation

It is known from the Kramers-Moyal diffusion theory in physics [45] that the Moran
process for large population size can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation.
Moran process is a discrete-time, discrete-state Markov process; its Kolmogorov forward
equation (sometimes called Master equation) has the form:
+
−
Pt+1 (i) − Pt (i) = Pt (i − 1)Ti−1
+ Pt (i + 1)Ti+1
− Pt (i)Ti− − Pt (i)Ti+ .

(17)

When N is large, we take the scalings x = i/N, t′ = t/N, and the probability density is
f (x, t) = NPt (i) (we still write t′ as t). By performing the truncated Kramers-Moyal (KM)
expansion of Eq. (17), we have the following approximated Fokker-Planck equation [47]:

where Bt is a Brownian Motion. In the limit of infinite population size, it is easy to see that

In this way, this diffusion approximation links the stochastic Moran process and the macroscopic nonlinear equation.
We should note that the above truncated KM expansion is performed by taking the same
scaling step of time and space with 1/N. However, when a = c and b = d, i.e. the neutrality
case, the transient landscape is flat with
T + (x) = T − (x)
for any x ∈ (0, 1). In this case, the above scaling step is not valid any more. As a modification,

we take x = i/ N, then by performing the truncated KM expansion, we will have

indicates that the scaling of the deterministic drift part should be different from that of the

Limit Theorem.

However, for the Moran process with absorbing boundaries T0+ = 0 and TN− = 0, the diffusion
approximation should have corresponding absorbing boundaries [45, 64]:
f (0, t) = 0, f (1, t) = 0.
In this way, the stationary distribution in Eq. (23) is not a real final limiting, but a transient
description of the diffusion process. We term (24) as diffusive landscape.

B.

The validation of KM diffusion approximation in local dynamics

We now discuss the validation of KM diffusion by comparing the transient landscape ψ(x)
and the diffusive landscape φ(x).
Consider the derivation of ψ(x), without loss of generality we set w = 1, then

From the above comparison, we find that ψ(x) and φ(x) share the same extremal point
and the curvature near x∗ . That is, the Gaussian variance of ψ(x) is equal to that of φ(x),
implying that the local movements near the extremal point in the diffusion process are in
agreement with that in the original Moran process for large populations.
van Kampen’s expansion gives a formal argument to the local validation of diffusion
approximation. Consider the VK diffusion (40) near x∗ , then Eq. (40) reduces to a timehomogeneous Fokker-Planck equation

This is accordance with our result that diffusion approximation gives the same local dynamics

as the original Moran process for large populations.
We now realize that not only does KM diffusion theory give the deterministic nonlinear
dynamical approximation to the Moran process, but it also gives a good approximation to
the intra-attractoral stochastic dynamics.

C.

The invalidation of KM diffusion approximation in global dynamics

Until now, it has been shown that the KM diffusion approximation correctly describe two
kinds of dynamics: 1) Deterministic nonlinear dynamics; 2) local stochastic dynamics. In
this section, we will further investigate the diffusion approximation for global dynamics.
16

Consider the uni-barrier case when a > c and b < d. In this bistable game system,
the comparison of different stable strategies is intimately related to the Maxwell-type construction, which is dependent on the global inter-attractoral dynamics. The Maxwell-type
construction indicates that except for the critical case, only one strategy should be selected
as the unique stable one. Therefore, different constructions could lead to different global
dynamical behavior.
For ψ(x), it has been shown that
ψ(1) = ψ(0) ⇔

b ln b − a ln a
d ln d − c ln c
=
.

For the diffusive landscape φ(x), however,




Fig. 3 shows a simple example: with the payoff parameters that make ψ(1) = ψ(0),
φ(1) > φ(0). In this case, the original Moran process and its diffusion approximated process
will select different transient attractors in large population size. Different global minimum
searches lead to different strategy selections. Therefore, for the evolutionary game systems
with multiple stable equilibria, the validity of this diffusion approximation becomes questionable in global dynamics.
In fact, it is not very surprised to see the global dynamical inconsistency between the
Moran process for large populations and KM diffusion, since their different large deviation
functions result in different exponential tails of their stationary distributions, which is intimately related to the inter-attractoral dynamics consisting of barrier crossing movements
from one attractor to another.
To illustrate this problem, we consider a simple birth-death process Y (t) with birth rate
µi = µ and death rate λi = λ, i.e. the transition rates are independent of the states [37].
Y (t) has a reflecting boundary at M and an absorbing boundary at 0. We are interested
in τn the first passage time from n to 0 [45]. In this simple model, there are three kinds of
movements from n to 0 (let θ = λ/µ): downhill (θ > 1), uphill (θ < 1) and flat (θ = 1).
It is not difficult to have that

From the above comparison of τn and τen , we find that they both approach to n/(λ − µ) in

the downhill dynamics; while in the uphill dynamics, both τn and τen share the exponential

form of ∼ eαn , but different exponential parameters. This is the heart of our example. We
should note that, for the bistable systems, the Maxwell-type constructions are determined
by the jump processes between these two attractors (back and forth), which are both rare
events with exponentially long time to happen. According to the above disparity between
τn and τen in the uphill dynamics, KM diffusion approximation can not give the exponent

correctly, and then results in representing the inter-attractoral dynamical inaccurately. We
suggest this as the reason for the invalidity of the diffusion approximation for the global
dynamics and landscape.

D.

Diffusion’s dilemma

According to Kurtz’s theorem [51, 52], KM’s diffusion theory can be mathematically
justified only for any finite time t. In other words, Eq. (18) correctly approximates the
finite-time Moran process for large but finite populations, whereas it is not guaranteed that
they share the same long-term stationary behavior. Therefore, the difficulty encountered
by KM’s diffusion in bistable game systems stems from the fact that exchanging the limits
of population size and time is problematic. It concerns with non-uniform convergence of
Kurtz’s result.
A natural question is whether one can find a diffusion process that gives both satisfactory
finite-time and stationary dynamical approximation. Hänggi et al. [49] proposed a very
different diffusion process in the context of Chemical Master Equation:


∂
1 ∂2
T + (x) − T − (x)
∂f (x, t)
+
−
= − ((T (x) − T (x))f ) +
f .
∂t
∂x
N ∂x2 ln T + (x) − ln T − (x)

(33)

The heuristic derivation of Eq. (33) is based on Onsager’s theory. Then the stochastic
potential for the system should be the transient landscape ψ(x), and the thermodynamic
force is
F (x) = −

dψ(x)
= ln T + (x) − ln T − (x).
dx

Therefore, the macroscopic ordinary differential equation should be
dx
= T + (x) − T − (x) = η −1 (x)F (x).
dt
So
η −1 (x) =

T + (x) − T − (x)
,
ln T + (x) − ln T − (x)

(34)

(35)

and the diffusion coefficient proportional to η −1 (x). In order to distinguish Hänggi et al.’s
from KM’s, we term Eq. (33) as HGTT’s diffusion.
It is easy to show that Eq. (33) gives the same large deviation function as the original
Moran process. Moreover, by comparing the drift coefficients of (18) and (33),
aKM (x) = aHGT T (x) = T + (x) − T − (x),
HGTT’s and KM’s describe the same ODE when N tends to infinity. For the diffusion
coefficients:
bKM (x) =

T + (x) + T − (x)
,
2
19

bHGT T (x) =

T + (x) − T − (x)
.
ln T + (x) − ln T − (x)

It is easy to find that HGTT’s diffusion coefficient is always smaller than that of KM’s (see
Fig. 4), except bKM (x) ≈ bHGT T (x) when x near x∗ . So away from the extremal point,
HGTT’s diffusion shows different finite-time stochastic dynamics from KM’s. Note that
KM’s diffusion gives the correct finite-time dynamical approximation of the original Moran
process, HGTT’s could then show a wrong short-term dynamics for most of the initial states.
Therefore, our diffusion dilemma can be stated as follows: Can we find an approximated
diffusion process correctly describe the whole three dynamical regimes: (a) The deterministic
limit; (b) the short time stochastic dynamics; (c) long time global dynamics? For truncated
KM approximation (and van Kampen’s expansion), the (a) and (b) are correct for each and
very attractor, but (c) is wrong. For HGTT’s diffusion, (a) and (c) are correct, but (b) is
wrong. So we can not find a diffusion process that provides all the three correctly.

DISCUSSIONS

Stochastic dynamics have become a fundamental theory in understanding Darwinian
evolutionary theory [1, 2, 66–68]. Besides nonlinearity, stochasticity has been shown as
another basic feature of complexity in biological world [69], especially within the scale of
cellular dynamics [70–72]. Stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, as agent-based models
to describe the kinetics in polymorphic population systems, offer a framework to study the
frequency-dependent selection in evolution.
The present paper discuss the well-mixed stochastic evolutionary game dynamics from
the viewpoint of the transients. The transient landscape, as a potential-like representation
of the pre-fixation dynamics, has been constructed via the conditional stationary distribution in the theory of quasi-stationarity in terms of the large deviation rate function. The
involvement of large deviation theory from probability is essential here, for without it, the
landscape would be system’s size dependent. It has been shown that this transient landscape can play a central role in connecting the deterministic replicator dynamics, the final
fixation behavior and diffusion approximation. As a Lyapunov function of the replicator dynamics, the transient landscape visually captures the infinite-population nonlinear behavior.
The downhill movements in this landscape corresponds to the dynamics of its deterministic

20

counterpart, whereas the rare uphill movements arising from the random fluctuations are of
more interest in stochastic evolutionary systems. To capture the eventual fixation behavior
from the transient perspective, we have classified the absorbing states into two cases: The
attractive absorbing state which is located at the transient attractor; the other rare absorbing state which is located at the top of the landscape. The former is an inherent result of the
transient downhill dynamics, while the latter is related to the multiple time scale issue, that
is, the final fixation time scale is separated from the transient coexistence quasi-stationarity.
Furthermore, the Maxwell-type construction and diffusion approximation are both important problems linking to the transient dynamics. The Maxwell-type construction is a global
description of nonlinear bistable stochastic dynamics, which is not present in deterministic
dynamics. This construction always searches the global minimum in the landscape, so it is
a direct result of inter-attractoral dynamics. The comparison of the Maxwell-type constructions between the original transient landscape and its diffusion counterpart indicates that
the truncated KM diffusion approximation could result in different global dynamics, that is,
the original Moran process for large populations and its diffusion counterpart could select
different global stable points. In order to solve this problem, another HGTT’s diffusion
has been constructed for giving the correct long-term asymptotic dynamics. However, this
diffusion gives the wrong finite time stochastic dynamics.
By investigating the first passage times in the simple birth-death process, it has been
found that the failure of exponential approximation in the uphill movement could be a
reason for our diffusion’s problem. Mathematically, the diffusion approximation is just a
second-order polynomial expansion of the Master equation, which only offers the secondorder precision for the original process. Accordingly, this approach can give the correct
deterministic dynamics (first order) and Gaussian dynamics near the stable point (secondorder). However, the inter-attractoral dynamics is determined by the rare barrier crossing
movements with exponentially small probabilities, so the Maxwell-type construction should
be approximated in the level of exponential asymptotics, which could be out of any finite
order expansions’ league. In the theory of probability, this is the domain of the Large
Deviation Theory [35].
It is believed that discrete stochastic dynamics offers a new perspective on biological
dynamics. Besides the conventional concentrations on maximum-likelihood events, more
attention should be paid to rare events. Evolution itself is a process with the accumulations
21

of various rare events, such as genetic or epigenetic mutations and ecological catastrophes.
So the stochasticity is not just fluctuations near the most probable macroscopic states, but
an important source of complexity, i.e., “innovation”, especially on an evolutionary time
scale.

APPENDIX
Conditional stationary distribution in the theory of quasi-stationarity

Quasi-stationarity is a series of stochastic mathematical techniques for analyzing the
Markov processes with absorbing states. The basic idea of the quasi-stationarity is to find
some effective distributions for characterizing the transient behavior of the process. There
are basically two kinds of quasi-stationarities: conditional stationary distribution and stationary conditional one. Here we only consider the former, see [26] for more details.
In order to introduce the conditional stationary distribution, we now add small mutations
to the original Moran process as follows:
T0+ = P (0 → 1) = ε.

(36)

TN− = P (N → N − 1) = ε.

(37)

In this case, the process has become irreducible. Further, the stationary distribution of the
new chain reads:
µi (ε) = C

i
Y

+
Tk−1
/Tk− .

(38)

k=1

where C is the normalized constant. Consider
ηi (ε) =

µi (ε)
1 − µ0 (ε) − µN (ε)
22

i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1,

(39)

it is not difficult to have that η(ε) is independent of ε, and η(ε) is just the same as η in
Eq. (11). It has been shown in [26] that ηj is proportional to the expected time of visits to
state j before absorption when started in the revival distribution. That is, η characterizes
the occupation time distribution of the transient dynamics. The larger ηj , the longer the
process stays at state j before absorption.
Here we should emphasize that, given a Markov chain with absorbing states, the prefixation occupation time distribution depends on the distribution of the states in which the
chain is revived. For the birth-death process here, it is natural to choose the reviving states
as neighboring the absorbing states.

B.

Generalized transient landscape for multi-dimensional cases

In this section we will show that the definition of the transient landscape in Eq. (12) can
be extended to more general cases.
Consider a multi-dimensional birth-death process with absorbing states, i.e.

Xt =

(X1 (t), X2 (t), ..., Xd (t)). The state space of this process is a d-dimensional vector space,
denoted as Nd . In the generalized Moran process [73], for instance, d is the number of
strategies, and Xi (t) is the number of individuals with strategy i at time t.
N
Suppose Xt has a unique conditional stationary distribution Pss
(~n), where N is the
N
population size, ~n ∈ Nd . As a function of N, Pss
(~n) usually has the so called WKB

expansion [37] for large population size:


ϕ2 (~x)
~n
N
Pss (~n) ∝ exp −Nϕ(~x) + ϕ1 (~x) +

N
N
That is, ϕ(~x) can be obtained from
ϕ(~x) = lim −
N →∞

1
N
ln Pss
(N~x),
N

if the above limit exists. We define ϕ(~x) as the generalized transient landscape.
It has been shown that ϕ(~x) still has the Lyapunov property with respect to its thermodynamic limit [74]. Suppose the thermodynamic limit of Xt can be described as the
following deterministic differential equations
dx~t
= ~a(~xt ),
dt
23

~xt = Xt /N.

In particular, for the generalized Moran process [73],
~a(~x) = (..., ai (~x), ...)T = (...,

d
X
j=1

(Tji (~x) − Tij (~x)), ...)T ,

where Tij (x) is the frequency-dependent probability that an i strategist is replaced by a j
strategist. From [37, 74], we have
ϕ̇(x~t ) = ▽ϕ(~x) ·

d~x
dt

= ▽ϕ(~x) · ~a(~x)

C.

van Kampen’s expansion

van Kampen’s expansion provides another systematic method of diffusion approximation
[50]. The idea of VK expansion is that, in large population size N, the number we are
interested in (e.g. the number of strategy A) is expected to consist of two parts: deterministic
and fluctuations parts. Consider the continuous time birth-death process here (the discrete
time case is similar), for any state i, we have
i = Nx(t) + N 1/2 ξ(t),
where x(t) is of order N −1 , ξ(t) is of N −1/2 . Define the shift operators as ω(Ti ) = Ti+1 and
ω −1 (Ti ) = Ti−1 , so the Master equation can be written as
dPt (i)
= (ω −1 − 1)(Ti+ Pt (i)) + (ω − 1)(Ti− Pt (i)),
dt
where Ti+ is the birth rate, and Ti− is the death rate. Now we denote the distribution of
ξ(t) as Π(ξ, t). In fact,
Π(ξ, t) = Pt (Nx(t) + N 1/2 ξ(t)),
and we have
∂Π(ξ, t) ∂Π(ξ, t) dξ

This is a linear Fokker-Planck equation whose coefficients only depend on x(t). So van

where δ~x−~a is the Dirac-delta function for ∂D.
The conditional stationary distribution solves the {· · · } = −Ji (~x) in Eq. (48), where
∇ · J(~x) = 0. Detailed balance, however, further dictates Ji (~x) ≡ 0 [45]. Therefore,

We see a hint of Eq. (47) in the square bracket. For multi-dimensional problems, the gradient
of ρ~x (~a) is a vector while φ(x) is a scalar. Therefore, it seems to us, even with detailed balance
condition, the relation in Eq. (47) can not be generalized to multi-dimensional case. On the
other hand, the definition of φ(x) can be generalized to multi-dimensional case (see appendix
B), even though finding it will be hard.

Figure 1 (Color online): Transient landscapes and conditional stationary distributions:
(a) Uni-well case: The small window shows the transient landscape ψ(x); The large window
shows the conditional stationary distribution η(x) with different population size. Parameters
are a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 1, and w = 0.7. (b) Uni-barrier case, with parameters a = 2.5,
b = 1, c = 1 ,d = 2 and w = 0.7. (c) Uphill case, with parameters a = 1, b = 1.2, c = 1.5,
d = 1.4.
Figure 2 (Color online): Maxwell-type construction for the bistable Moran process: (a)
When the critical condition is satisfied (a = 2, b = 1, c = 1, d = 2), ψ(0) = ψ(1). Both are
equally important. (b) With parameters a = 2.5, b = 1, c = 1, d = 2, ψ(0) > ψ(1). Then
η(0) < η(1), and even η(0) ≪ η(1) for large population size.
Figure 3 (Color online): The original Moran process and its KM approximated diffusion
process show different Maxwell-type constructions. In this example, ψ(1) = ψ(0), but
φ(1) > φ(0). (The figure is magnified and we focus on the region near x = 1)
Figure 4 (Color online): The HGTT’s diffusion coefficient is always smaller than KM’s,
except at x∗ where they are both equal to each other.
