Abstract
Stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity are of great interest recently in
studying the spread of an infectious disease. The presented method solves
an inverse problem to discover the effectively decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the transmission parameters which govern
the stochastic spreads over the network from a dataset on an infectious
disease outbreak in the early growth phase. Populations in a combination
of epidemiological compartment models and a meta-population network
model are described by stochastic differential equations. Probability density functions are derived from the equations and used for the maximal
likelihood estimation of the topology and parameters. The method is
tested with computationally synthesized datasets and the WHO dataset
on SARS outbreak.

Introduction

When the epidemiologists at a public health agency detect a signal of an infectious disease outbreak, they rely heavily on mathematical models of disease
transmission in estimating the rate of transmission, predicting the direction
and speed of the spread, and figuring out an effective measure to contain the
outbreak. Many of the models formulate stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity, which are of great interest recently. The spatial heterogeneity ranges from
the uneven probabilities of contacts between the individuals in communities
[Walker 2010], [Small 2006], dependence of the strength of the demographical interactions between cities on the distance [Keeling 2004], to nation-wide or worldwide inhomogeneous geographical structures [Dangerfield 2009], [Riley 2007].
A Monte-Carlo stochastic simulation is widely used to understand the influence of the spatial heterogeneity on stochastic spreading. In such a simulation,
accuracy and reproducibility of the input demographical knowledge such as the
amount of traffic between cities have great impacts on the reliability of the output pattern of the movement of pathogens and their hosts. But, in studying
1

world-wide epidemics, just a collection of regular airline routes and aircraft capacities does not always present the transportation network which results in the
real chain of transmission. Some routes are influential decisively, but the others
are not. Examples are found in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) from Asia to the world in 2003. There were not any cases in Japan in
spite of the heavy traffic there from Asian countries. Many patients appeared
in Canada earlier than the United States to which airlines connect Asian countries much more densely. Here arises an interesting question. Inversely, is it
possible to learn the effectively decisive transportation network by observing how
the disease spreads, reinforce the demographical knowledge on the network, and
import the acquired knowledge into the mathematical model? This is an inverse
problem similar to the network tomography [Maeno 2009], [Rabbat 2008].
In this study, a statistical method is presented to discover the effectively
decisive topology of a heterogeneous network and reveal the parameters which
govern stochastic transmission from a dataset on the early growth phase of
the outbreak. The dataset consists of either the number of infectious persons or the number of new cases per an observation interval. The method
is founded on a mathematical model for a stochastic reaction-diffusion process [Baronchelli 2008]. The population in the model is described by a set of
Langevin equations. The equations are stochastic differential equations which
include rapidly fluctuating and highly irregular functions of time. Probability
density functions and likelihood functions are derived from the equations analytically, and used for the maximal likelihood estimation of the topology and
parameters. The method is tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets and the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset on the SARS
outbreak in March through April in 2003.

2.1

Problem
Stochastic model

The model in this study is a special case of a stochastic reaction-diffusion process. The model is a combination of standard epidemiological SIR or SIS compartment models and a meta-population network model. The meta-population
network model [Colizza 2007] sub-divides the entire population into distinct subpopulations in N geographical regions. Movement of persons occurs between
the sub-populations while the epidemiological state transitions (infection and
recovery) occur in a sub-population. A sub-population is randomly well-mixed.
Heterogeneity is present between sub-populations.
The geographical regions are represented by nodes ni (i = 0, 1, · · · , N −
1). The movement is parameterized by a matrix γ whose i-th row and j-th
column element γij is the probability at which a person moves from ni to nj
per
PN a−1unit time. A person remains at the same node at the probability of 1 −
j=0 γij . Generally, γij = γji does not hold. By definition, γii = 0. It
is often confirmed empirically that a simple law relates a network topology to
2

the movement [Barrat 2004]. The topology is specified by a neighbor matrix l.
The transportation between two regions is represented by a pair of unidirectional
links. If a pair of links is present between ni and nj , lij = lji = 1. If absent,
lij = lji = 0. By definition, lii = 0. In the experiments in section 4, an
empirically confirmed law γij = Γij (l) is postulated, and the topology and the
probability of movement are treated interchangeably.
The SIR compartment model [Keeling 2008] is a behavioral extreme where
immunity is life-long. The state of a person changes from a susceptible state (S),
through an infectious state (I), to a recovered state (R). In contrast, the immunity does not occur in the SIS compartment model. The state of a recovered
patient goes back to S. The parameter α represents the probability at which an
infectious person contacts a person and infect the person per a unit time. If the
contacted person is susceptible, the number of the infectious persons increases
by 1. The effective rate of infection by a single infectious person is the product
of α and the proportion of the susceptible persons within the population. The
parameter β represents the probability at which an infectious person recovers
per a unit time. These parameters are constants over subpopulations and time.
The basic reproductive ratio r is defined by r = α/β [Lipsitch 2003].
Movement, infection and recovery are Markovian stochastic processes governed by γij , α, and β.

2.2

Time evolution of spread

In a stochastic process, even if the initial condition is known, there are many
possible trajectories which the process might go along. A set of these possible trajectories is a statistical ensemble. The change in the population is
described by a set of Langevin equations [Hufnagel 2004]. A Langevin equation
is a stochastic differential equation [Kloeden 1992]. The microscopic continuous
time evolution of a system is obtained by adding a fluctuation (a stochastic
term) to the known macroscopic time evolution of the system.
The quantity Si (t) is the number of susceptible persons at a node ni at time
t. Ii (t) is the number of infectious persons. Ri (t) is the number of recovered persons. The change in Ii (t) (i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1) is given by eq.(1) [Colizza 2006].
It is a set of N stochastic differential equations.

Stochastic terms ξ(t) = (ξi (t), ξi (t), ξij (t)) are rapidly fluctuating and

terms for infection, N terms for recovery, and N (N − 1) terms for movement).
The functional forms of individual elements ξa (t) (a = 0, 1, · · · , M − 1) are not
known. Their statistical property is the Gaussian white noise which satisfies
eq.(2) through (4).

In these equations, δ(t) is a Dirac’s delta function, and δab is a Kronecker’s
delta symbol. The ensemble average of a variable x is hxiensemble . Eq.(3) means
that there is no correlation at different times and between different terms. Eq.(4)
means that the third and higher order moments vanish.
In most cases, the outbreak is contained before the spread reaches equilibrium. In the early growth phase of the outbreak, Ii ≪ Si and Ri ≪ Si hold
true. The first term of the rightside of eq.(1) is independent of Si and Ri because Si /(Si + Ii + Ri ) ≈ 1. The resulting equation is eq.(5). Eq.(5) can also
be applied to the SIS model.

Definition of problem

The problem is to discover the network topology l (or γ) and reveal the transmission parameter r (or α and β) from a given dataset Ii (td ) (i = 0, 1, · · · , N −
1, d = 0, 1, · · · , D − 1) or ∆Ji (td ) (i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, d = 0, 1, · · · , D − 1).
The dataset Ii (td ) is the time sequence of the number of infectious persons.
The dataset ∆Ji (td ) = Ji (td+1 ) − Ji (td ) is the time sequence of the number of new cases between observations. Observation is made at every node
ni (i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1) at times td (d = 0, 1, · · · , D − 1). The time interval
between observations is ∆t = td+1 − td . For example, a bundle of the daily
reports on cases from hospitals is a dataset ∆Ji (td ) where ∆t = 1 day. Other
information is not known. That is, nothing is known about Si (td ), Ri (td ), nor
the initial condition which could identify the index case (the first patient from
whom the infectious disease has spread).

Method
Likelihood function

Various techniques of statistical inference can be applied once the likelihood
function is obtained analytically. The likelihood function is the conditional probability of the obtained dataset as a function of the unknown parameters of a
parameterized statistical model. The conditional probability becomes noticeably
large if the value of the parameters is close to the true value. For example,
maximal a posteriori estimation is used to find the parameters which maximize
the posterior distribution. In this study, the problem is solved by maximal
likelihood estimation. The Langevin equations (5) through (8) are solved by
obtaining the moments of probability variables at time t so that the probability density functions and logarithmic likelihood functions can be derived,
rather than by calculating the trajectories of time-dependent variables for a
given functional form of ξa (t) [Dangerfield 2009]. Four logarithmic likelihood
functions L[I1] (θ), L[I2] (θ), L[J1] (θ), and L[J2] (θ) are derived for given datasets
Ii (td ), I(td ), ∆Ji (td ), and ∆J(td ) respectively under the unknown parameters
θ = {γ, α, β}.
Appendix A presents the procedure to solve the Langevin equations through
a Fokker-Planck equation [Kampen 2007] . Appendix B summarizes the formula
for the time evolution of m[I] (t|θ), m[J] (t|θ) (row vectors whose i-th element is
the mean of Ii , Ji ) and v [II] (t|θ), v [IJ] (t|θ), v [JJ] (t|θ) (matrices whose i-th row
and j-th column element is the covariance between Ii and Ij , Ii and Jj , Ji and
Jj ). Appendix C summarizes the formula for the time evolution of m[I] (t|θ),
m[J] (t|θ) (the mean of I, J) and v [II] (t|θ), v [IJ] (t|θ), v [JJ] (t|θ) (the variance of
I, covariance between I and J, variance of J).

Case 1: for given Ii (td )

3.1.1

The logarithmic likelihood function L[I1] (θ) is determined by Ii (td ). If the
third and higher order moments are ignored, the probability density function
p(I, td+1 |θ) is a multi-variate Gaussian distribution with the mean m[I] (td+1 |θ)
and covariance v [II] (td+1 |θ) in eq.(9). This is the probability of I = (I0 , · · · , In−1 )
at t = td+1 given θ. X T is a transpose of a matrix X.
p[I1] (I, td+1 |θ) =

exp(− 12 (I − m[I] (td+1 |θ))v [II] (td+1 |θ)−1 (I − m[I] (td+1 |θ))T )

. (9)
(2π)N det v [II] (td+1 |θ)

L[I1] (θ) is the logarithm of a product of the probability of the individual
observation I(td+1 ) at t = td+1 . It is given by eq.(10).
L[I1] (θ) =

D−2

d=0

log p[I1] (I(td+1 ), td+1 |θ).

(10)

If ∆t is small, the formula for the moments become simpler. The exact
formula for m[I] (t|θ) and v [II] (t|θ) are expanded in terms of ∆t, and the second
and higher order terms are ignored. If the data Ii (td ) at t = td is reliable
[II]
[I]
completely, mi (td |θ) = Ii (td ) and vij (td |θ) = 0. The moments after ∆t are
given by eq.(11) and (12). The moments at t = td+1 depend only on the data
at t = td .

(12)

Similarly, the logarithmic likelihood function L[I2] (θ) is determined by I(td ).
I(td ) can be calculated from the given dataset Ii (td ). The probability density function p[I2] (I, td+1 |θ) = p[I2] (I, td+1 |α, β) is a Gaussian distribution with
the mean m[I] (td+1 |θ) and variance v [II] (td+1 |θ). It does not depend on γ.
L[I2] (θ) = L[I2] (α, β) is the logarithm of a product of the probability of individual observation I(td+1 ) at t = td+1 . It is given by eq.(13).
L[I2] (α, β) =

log p[I2] (I(td+1 ), td+1 |α, β).

(13)

Again, if ∆t is small, the formula for the moments become simpler. They
are given by eq.(14) and (15).
m[I] (td+1 |θ) ≈ I(td ) + (α − β)I(td )∆t.

(14)

v [II] (td+1 |θ) ≈ (α + β)I(td )∆t.

(15)

3.1.2

Case 2: for given ∆Ji (td )

The logarithmic likelihood function L[J1] (θ) is determined by ∆Ji (td ). The
probability density function p[J1] (J , td+1 |θ) is a multi-variate Gaussian distribution in the same functional form as eq.(9) with the mean m[J] (td+1 |θ)
and covariance v [JJ] (td+1 |θ). The functional form of L[J1] is also the same as
eq.(10). Ji (td+1 ) can be calculated from the dataset by Ji (td+1 ) = Ji (t0 ) +
Pd
d′ =0 ∆Ji (td′ ). The first observation ∆Ji (t0 ) may include all the known cases
at that time. Then, Ji (t0 ) can be deleted from the above formula. There is,
however, a big difference from L[I1] (θ). The probability at t = td+1 is not determined by the data Ji (td ) because the moments of Ji at t = td+1 depends on
Ii at t = td whose value is not known. Such approximation as eq.(14) or (15)
is not correct. Thus, the exact formula for v [JJ] (t|θ) as a function of t must be
evaluated to calculate the value of L[J1] (θ).
Similarly, the logarithmic likelihood function L[J2] (θ) is determined by J(td ).
J(td ) can be calculated from the given dataset ∆Ji (td ). The probability density
function p[J2] (J, td+1 |θ) = p[J2] (J, td+1 |α, β) is a Gaussian distribution with the
mean m[J] (td+1 |θ) and variance v [JJ] (td+1 |θ). The functional form of L[J2] (θ) =
L[J2] (α, β) is the same as eq.(13). The approximation in eq.(14) and (15) is not
correct either. Thus, the exact formula for v [JJ] (t|θ) as a function of t must be
evaluated to calculate the value of L[J2] (α, β).

3.2

Estimation procedure

Theoretically, every formula in the following can be applied in estimating γij
directly, as well as estimating l and obtaining γ by the law γij = Γij (l). But,
the estimation of N (N − 1)/2 binary parameters lij (i < j) tends to be more
robust than that of N (N − 1) continuous parameters γij (i 6= j). The binary
parameters are suitable for reliable combinatorial optimization by means of wellestablished numerical algorithms and computational implementations. Thus, the
estimation of l is detailed here and demonstrated in section 4.
3.2.1

Case 1: for given Ii (td )

The procedure for the estimation from Ii (td ) is prsented. The problem is solved
by dividing it to two sub-problems and solving them sequentially, rather than
by searching the maximal likelihood estimators α̂, β̂, and l̂ simultaneously. The
first sub-problem is to obtain α̂ and β̂ by solving eq.(16).
α̂, β̂ = arg maxL[I2] (α, β).
α, β

The second sub-problem is to obtain the maximal likelihood estimator l̂
using the obtained values of α̂ and β̂. They are obtained by solving eq.(19).
l̂ = arg maxL[I1] (α̂, β̂, Γij (l)).
l

(19)

Eq.(19) can not be solved analytically. There are 1014 possible topologies
for N = 10, and 1057 for N = 20. Simulated annealing [Press 2007] is a powerful meta-heuristic algorithm to solve such a combinatorial global optimization
problem. A candidate of parameters l′ is generated randomly near the present
value of l. The parameters are updated from γij = Γij (l) to Γij (l′ ) according
to the probability p(s) in eq.(20) in the s-th step (s = 0, 1, · · · ) of iterations.
p(s) = min(exp(

L[I1] (α̂, β̂, Γij (l)) − L[I1] (α̂, β̂, Γij (l′ )
), 1).
kT (s)

(20)

T (s) is the annealing temperature in the s-th step. Typical cooling schedule
is T (s) = 1/ log(s + 1). Since O(T ) = 1, the scaling constant k is selected as an
appropriate value whose order is the same as that of L[I1] .
3.2.2

Case 2: for given ∆Ji (td )

The procedure for the estimation from ∆Ji (td ) is presented. Again, the problem
is divided to two sub-problems. The first sub-problem is to solve eq.(21). The
quantity I(0) is the initial value of the number of infectious persons, which
appears in the formula for the mean and variance of J in Appendix C. It is not
the same as the known J(t0 ), but an unknown parameter.
ˆ = arg max L[J2] (α, β, I(0)).
α̂, β̂, I(0)
α,β,I(0)

(21)

Simulated annealing uses the probability p(s) in eq.(22) for the update of a
candidate. An alternative means to solve eq.(21) is such a function maximization
algorithm as a BFGS quasi-Newton method [Press 2007].
p(s) = min(exp(

L[J2] (α, β, I(0)) − L[J2] (α′ , β ′ , I(0)′ )
), 1).
kT (s)

(22)

A great difficulty in maximizing L[J1] (θ) is encountered in solving the second sub-problem. The very complex formula for v [JJ] (t|θ) to obtain the value
of L[J1] (θ) is not tractable even numerically unless N is very small. An approximation is introduced to convert this problem to the computationally tractable
second sub-problem in 3.2.1. The valued of Ii (td ) is approximately obtained
from the value of ∆Ji (td ) by eq.(23), which use the already obtained value of

8

α̂. Eq.(19) is solved with the converted values of Ii (td ) instead of maximizing
L[J1] (θ) directly.
Ii (td ) ≈

∆Ji (td )
.
α̂∆t

(23)

Eq.(23) is a discrete time approximation of eq.(6) for small ∆t. This relationship holds true for the mean values of Ii (td ) and ∆Ji (td ). But the variance
√
[α]
of Ii (td ) is overestimated by neglecting the stochastic term αIi ξi . Because of
the approximation, the estimation from ∆Ji (td ) would be more erroneous than
that from Ii (td ). The estimation errors are demonstrated in section 4.

Experiment
Computationally synthesized dataset

A number of test datasets are synthesized by numerical integration [Kloeden 1992]
of a Langevin equation (1) for random network topologies and transmission parameters. The network is a Erdös-Rényi model in a combination of N and
the average nodal degree hki i. The nodal degree of a node ni is given by
PN −1
ki = j=0 lij . The probability at which lij = 1 is hki i/(N − 1).
It is postulated that the total p
number of persons who moves from ni to nj
per a unit time is proportional to ki kj if a link is present. This law is known
valid generally for the world-wide airline transportation network [Barrat 2004].
It is also postulated that the initial population Pi (0) = Si (0) + Ii (0) + Ri (0)
of a node ni is proportional to the total number of persons who outgoes from
the node per a unit time. Consequently, γij is determined as a function of l by
eq.(24). The fraction of persons who outgoes per a unit time is a constant γ
over the network. This is an additional unknown parameter in solving eq.(19).
The law in eq.(24) is used in discovering the network topology by eq.(19) as well
as synthesizing the datasets computationally.

Figure 1 illustrates an example of the network topology estimated from a
computationally synthesized dataset. The graph [A] shows the dataset Ii (td )
with ∆t = 1 and D = 100 when r = 2. The drawing [B] shows the topology
with N = 10 and hki i = 3 to synthesize the dataset. The index cases appear
at n0 . The network includes a core sub-structure consisting of n0 , n2 , n4 , n5 ,
and n9 . It is nearly a clique where every node is connected to every other node.
Links are present except for the one between n5 and n9 . The drawing [C] shows
the topology estimated from the dataset. The error is El = 0.18. The core is
discovered correctly. The ability of the method is surprising in distinguishing the
only pair of nodes where the link is absent. The links from the core to n1 and n7
are discovered. Although the method identifies that n3 , n6 , and n8 do not belong
to the core, but form the stubs (dead ends) from the core, it fails to estimate
how they are connected to each other and the core. The number of cases is the
smallest at these nodes. The movements of infectious persons to and from them
are so infrequent that the analysis on them is not so reliable.
The estimation error El of the method in this study is compared with those
of a naive estimation and a mere random guess. The naive estimation relies
on the correlation between nodes. When an infectious person moves from ni
to nj , Ii decreases and Ij increases by one simultaneously. Thus, intuitively,
the negative correlation of the change in Ii and Ij is the signal of the presence
of a link. The correlation ρij between ni and nj is calculated by eq.(28) where

the positive correlation because of the common growing trends in Ii (dependent
on (α − β)Ii ∆t in eq.(11)). The naive estimation predicts lij = 1 if ρij < 0.
The random guess is the worst bound of estimation. The number of links whose
presence or absence is predicted wrongly obeys a binomial distribution. The
mean and standard deviation of El are 0.5 and 0.0745 for N = 10, and 0.5 and
0.0256 for N = 20 theoretically.

1) (hki i = 2, 3, 4 for the number of nodes N = 10) when r = 2, and Ii (td ) with
∆t = 1 and D = 100 is given as a dataset. For small hki i, the naive estimation
does not work at all. As hki i increases, El of the method increases and that
of the naive estimation decreases. For large hki i, the naive estimation becomes
less erroneous than the random guess. But, it never surpasses the method in

this study. The initially heterogeneous node-to-node distribution of infectious
persons relaxes more quickly in the networks having more links. For example,
the standard deviation of Ii (t99 ) is about 400 for hki i = 2, and about 300 for
hki i = 4, while the mean for both hki i is about 550 (≈ I0 (0) exp((α−β)D∆t)/N ).
The growing trends also become more homogeneous. Under such homogeneity, the negative correlation implies the movements between nodes directly. The
naive estimation may be a substitute if assuming homogeneous distribution during observation are well-grounded.
Figure 3 shows the estimation errors El and Er for various values of the
normalized average degree hki i/(N − 1) (hki i = 2, 3, 4 for N = 10 and hki i =
3, 6, 9 for N = 20), N , and r when Ii (td ) with ∆t = 1 and D = 100 is given as
a dataset. The findings are as follows.
• As hki i increases, El increases from around 0.2 to 0.4. Although El (the
average ± standard deviation) remains less than 0.5 within the range of
the experimental conditions here, the estimation comes close to a mere
random guess (El → 0.5) for the dense network limit (→ a complete
graph). Discerning the presence or absence of links becomes more difficult
as the spread goes on over more links in parallel and reaches more nodes
along more possible routes. On the other hand, Er does not change largely
as hki i changes.
12

• As the network becomes larger, El increases and Er decreases. As the
model becomes more complex (the number of links O(N 2 ) becomes larger
compared to the amount of data O(N D)), there may appear more optimal
or sub-optimal topologies. Choosing a unique right answer becomes more
difficult from such similar candidates. On the other hand, the central limit
theorem guarantees that the fluctuation decreases as the network becomes
larger because α P
and β are estimated from the sum of N probability
−1
variables (I(td ) = N
i=0 Ii (td )).

• As r increases, El increases (but the difference between r = 4 and r = 6
is very small) and Er increases from around 0.1 to 0.35. The observations
can not track down the rapid reproduction of patients when r∆t is large.
The dependence of the errors on γ in eq.(24) is investigated. The errors
increase from El = 0.2 and Er = 0.092 for γ = 0.1 in [a] of figure 3 [A] to El =
0.26 and Er = 0.10 for γ = 0.2, and El = 0.32 and Er = 0.099 for γ = 0.4. The
accuracy of estimation is limited when many persons move between nodes in both
directions because of large γ. The dependence of the errors on ∆t is investigated.
The errors increase from El = 0.2 and Er = 0.092 in [a] of figure 3 [A] to El =
0.31 and Er = 0.18 if the observations are made four times less frequently (∆t =
4, D = 25). But they are improved only slightly to El = 0.18 and Er = 0.074
if the observations are made 4 times more frequently (∆t = 0.25, D = 400).
Small time interval between observations is relevant to accurate estimation. The
errors are investigated for various initial population distributions Pi (0). If the
population is a thousandth (P = 103 N ), El = 0.23 and Er = 0.091 for N = 10,
PN −1
hki i = 2, and r = 2 when I0 (0) = 20. If Pi (0) ∝ j=0 lij (ki kj )4 rather than
PN −1 p
ki kj in eq.(25), El = 0.25 and Er = 0.09 when the population is
j=0 lij
P = 106 N . In this case, the population ranges in vastly diverse scales. The
ratio of the population of the most populated node to that of the least populated
node is Pmax (0)/Pmin (0) ≈ 2000 while Pmax (0)/Pmin (0) ≈ 7 in case of eq.(25).
Er is not affected by the distribution. El increases when much less populated
nodes are present. But El still remains small.
Figure 4 shows the estimation errors El and Er for various values of hki i/(N −
1), N , and r when ∆Ji (td ) with ∆t = 1 and D = 100 is given as a dataset. The
experimental conditions are the same as those for Figure 3. The findings are as
follows.
• The dependency of El and Er on hki i, N , and r in figure 4 is similar to
those in figure 3.
• The absolute value of errors tends to increase. For example, El = 0.31 in
figure 4 is much larger than El = 0.2 in figure 3 under the same experimental conditions hki i = 2, N = 10, and r = 2. In contrast, the increase in Er
is relatively small. Er is nearly the same when r = 6. The deterioration
in estimating the topology, therefore, seem to result from the influence of
the approximation in eq.(23).

13

As a summary of the experiments, the estimation is particularly reliable
(El ∼ 0.2 and Er ∼ 0.1) when Ii (td ) for a slow reproduction over a sparse
network is used as an input. Such performance can not be achieved by the
naive estimation. The estimated topology from ∆Ji (td ) is more erroneous than
that from Ii (td ) by as much as 50%.

4.2

SARS dataset

SARS is a respiratory disease in humans caused by the SARS corona-virus.
The epidemic of SARS appears to have started in Guangdong Province of south
China in November 2002. SARS spread from the Guangdong Province to Hong
Kong in early 2003, and eventually nearly 40 countries around the world by July.
WHO archives the cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS1 . The
dataset in the archive had been updated nearly every day since March 17. It is a
time sequence dataset Ji (td ) with ∆t = 1 day. In this study, the target geographical regions are those where five or more cases had been reported in a month
since March 17. They include Canada (CAN), France (FRA), United Kingdom
(GBR), Germany (GER), Hong Kong (HKG), Malaysia (MAS), Taiwan (ROC),
Singapore (SIN), Thailand (THA), United States (USA), and Vietnam (VIE).
Mainland China is not included because no data is available in some periods
and no data outside of Guangdong Province is reported in other periods.
Figure 5 shows the date when the first patient appeared and the propagating
wavefront of the spread. It is almost certain that neither FRA nor MAS are the
origin of the outbreak. But, nobody can tell the chain of transmission among
CAN, HKG, SIN, GBR, ROC, and USA in just two days from March 17 to
19 reliably. The wavefront is not as informative as anticipated. Such a naive
gleaning verifies the obvious series of events at best.
The estimated transmission parameters are α̂ = 0.18 and β̂ = 0.13. The basic reproductive ratio is r̂ = 1.4. According to the field-based medical case studies, the basic reproductive ratio (except for super-spreading events [Fujie 2007])
was r = 2.7 in February and went down to r = 1 in late March in Hong Kong
[Riley 2003], and r = 7 in February and r = 1 in early March in Singapore
[Lipsitch 2003]. The decrease of r is due to the quarantine, hospitalization and
public awareness starting to take effects after WHO issued a world-wide alert
on March 12. But the spread of SARS was still going on world-wide. The value
slightly greater than 1 seems reasonable at that stage.
It is postulated that the law in eq.(24) holds true in analyzing the SARS
dataset. The topology which achieves the largest value of the logarithmic likehood function among many trials is chosen. This is efficient in rejecting the
local maximum to which simulated annealing may converge. The trials use different random number sequences to generate nearby candidates l′ in eq.(20).
Figure 6 shows the estimated topologies l̂. The topology [A] is the most likely
(the largest value of the likelihood L = −9985). The best 30 trials out of 300

trials converge to [A]. It includes 11 links (hki i/(N − 1) = 0.2). The topology
[B] is the second most likely (L = −9998). The next 5 trials converge to [B].
It include 13 links (hki i/(N − 1) = 0.24). The topology [C] is the third most
likely (L = −10012). The next 29 trials converge to [C]. It include 14 links
(hki i/(N − 1) = 0.25). About 20% of the trials converge to either [A] or [C].
The sub-structures common in all of [A], [B], and [C] are a star from HKG
to CAN, ROC, and SIN, another star from USA to GBR, MAS, and VIE, and
a link between the centers of these stars (HKG and USA). A triangle between
USA, VIE, and THI appears in [A] and [C]. The likelihood seems sensitive to the
topological whereabouts of GER and FRA given these common sub-structures as
a core of the network. This may happen to make [B] a tall but narrow peak
in the landscape of the likelihood, which simulated annealing sometimes fail to
discover. In addition to these sub-structures, a few remarkable points are seen
in these topologies. The nodes SIN and ROC are stubs where ki = 1. The
role of SIN is not so relevant in spreading the disease despite the fact that the
number of cases there was more than 100 in the middle of April. The nodes
CAN and USA have links to distant geographical regions, and USA is a hub
(ki is the largest). They are relevant intermediate spreader nodes. The links
around GER are not stable among the three topologies. The number of cases
in some European countries is too small to draw a reliable conclusion.
The estimated topologies are not meant to reproduce the trajectories of
individual patients’ movement, but rather demonstrate some demographical interactions within the macroscopic world-wide transportation behind the SARS
outbreak. Nevertheless, the sub-structures mentioned above seem to be consistent with the following publicly known series of events on some individual
patients’ microscopic movements.
• Two of the index patients in Toronto in Canada, three of the index patients in Singapore, and another three of the index patients in the United
States stayed a hotel in Hong Kong where a Chinese nephrologist, who
had treated many patients in Guangzhou and become infected, was staying in late February2 . This event implies the links from HKG to CAN,

SIN, and USA form a chain of transmission in the early growth phase of
SARS outbreak.
• A garment manufacturer from the United States became infected during
the stay in Hong Kong on the way to Hanoi in Vietnam, showed symptoms
there, and was evacuated to a hospital in Hong Kong [Greenfeld 2006].
An Italian physician, who treated him at a hospital in Hanoi, showed
symptoms in Bangkok in Thailand where he would attend a conference in
early March. These events imply that the interactions among HKG, USA,
VIE, and THI are present potentially, which could result in another chain
of transmission.
The WHO dataset is not of perfectly reliable quality. Particularly, the data
on mainland China is of poor quality, and can not be used in this study. Even the
individual number of cases which was reported from the other local governments
may not be accurate. The number of cases is highly fluctuating and seems noisy.
Data in a city-level resolution, rather than nation-level, would be necessary
for accurate estimation when large countries like USA play an important role
as a spreader. It is surprising that, in spite of these limitations, the method
reproduces some characteristics of the network over which SARS spread from
Hong Kong to Southeast Asia and North America.

Conclusion

The method presented in this study solves an inverse problem to discover the
effectively decisive network and reveal the transmission parameters from the
observation Ii (td ) or ∆Ji (td ) on the spread of an infectious disease. The findings with test datasets are that the estimation is particularly successful when
the topology is sparse and reproduction is slow, and that the estimation from
∆Ji (td ) is more erroneous than that from Ii (td ). The network topology discovered from a seemingly noisy dataset on the SARS outbreak reproduces some
characteristic patterns of the spread from Hong Kong to Southeast Asia and
North America. So far, a great effort has been made to get a complete picture
of how an infectious disease did and will spread from the found pieces of an
epidemiological jigsaw puzzle. The method presents new pieces from a viewpoint of macroscopic transportation. These pieces can be put together with
the pieces found in the conventional field-based medical case studies on the
individual patients’ microscopic movements.
The method can be extended to apply to a more practical situation. The
experimental condition in this study is an extreme where nothing but Ii (td )
or ∆Ji (td ) is known and no informative prior knowledge is available. If some
demographical statistics on the traffic between cities or the findings on the past
contacts between individual patients are available, the consequent posterior distribution enables more comprehensive Bayesian inference. Another extension is
to employ more complicated but realistic epidemiological compartment models.
Latent period (infected but not infectious) and hospitalization are relevant for
some diseases. The dependence of recovery on time (β 6= constant) is realistic
for other diseases. Strictly speaking, the time interval from infection to recovery
and from a movement to another obeys appropriate probability density functions.
Analytical treatment of the stochastic process with these effects tends to be considerably difficult. The estimation may count on such a numerical method as a
Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampling.
In addition to the extensions to the method, it is sometimes critical to gather
such a larger dataset as a collection of multiple independent time sequences
starting from different index cases. Less erroneous estimation may be possible
even for the regions whose population is small or where the number of cases is
small. Such a dataset is not available for SARS, but possibly for influenza which
spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. Understanding the landscape
of the likelihood functions is essential in identifying the requisites for a dataset,
a network topology, and a mathematical model of disease transmission to make
the inverse problem well-posed and stabilize the solution. This remains the
challenge for the future.
