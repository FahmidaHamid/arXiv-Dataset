Abstract: A three-dimensional unilateral contact problem for articular cartilage layers attached to subchondral bones shaped as elliptic paraboloids is considered in the framework
of the biphasic cartilage model. The main novelty of the study is in accounting not only
for the normal (vertical), but also for tangential vertical (horisontal) displacements of the
contacting surfaces. Exact general relationships have been established between the contact
approach and some integral characteristics of the contact pressure, including the contact
force. Asymptotic representations for the contact pressure integral characteristics are obtained in terms of the contact approach and some integral characteristics of the contact zone.
The main result is represented by the first-order approximation problem.

Introduction

Biomechanical contact problems involving transmission of forces across biological joints are
of considerable practical interest (see, e.g. [2, 3, 11, 13]). Many analytical solutions to
the problem of contact interaction of articular cartilage surfaces in joints are available. In
particular, Ateshian et al. [8] obtained an asymptotic solution for the axisymmetric contact
problem for two identical biphasic cartilage layers consisting of a solid phase and a fluid

phase and attached to two rigid impermeable spherical bones of equal radii. Later, Wu
et al. [14] extended this solution to a more general axisymmetric model by combining the
assumption of the kinetic relationship from classical contact mechanics [12] with the joint
contact model [8] for the contact of two biphasic cartilage layers. An improved solution for
the contact of two biphasic cartilage layers in the axisymmetric setting, which can be used
for dynamic loading, was obtained by Wu et al. [15].
An asymptotic modeling approach to study the contact problem for biphasic cartilage
layers has been performed by Argatov and Mishuris in a series of articles (see [4, 5, 7]). In
particular, it was shown [4] that accounting for the tangential displacements is important in
the case of diseased cartilage where the measurement of indentation depth may differ even
as much as 10% in comparison with the healthy case. In [5], the unilateral contact problem
for articular cartilages bonded to subchondral bones with a contact zone in the shape of
an arbitrary ellipse has been considered, and a closed form analytic solution was found.
Exploiting this exact result, Argatov and Mishuris [7] have performed perturbation analysis
of the contact problem with approximate geometry of the contact surfaces. Other analytic
solutions for the contact problem were found using the viscoelastic cartilage model for elliptic
contact zone in [6]. A new methodology for modeling articular tibio-femoral contact based
on the developed asymptotic model of frictionless elliptical contact interaction between thin
biphasic cartilage layers was presented in [2]. The mathematical model of articular contact
was extended to the case of contact between arbitrary viscoelastic incompressible coating
layers.
In this study we extend results obtained in papers [4] and [5] by considering the influence
of the tangential displacements on the contact problem for cartilage layers with the contact
zone of elliptic shape based on the biphasic material model. Note that the perturbation
method proposed in [7] could be one of the options for the analysis, however, the procedure
is too complex to perform even a few asymptotic steps. Here, employing some technique and
ideas from [4] and [5], we propose another way to construct the asymptotics which utilises the
assumption that the shape of the contact zone is an ellipse at the initial stage of deformation
and can be regarded as a small perturbation of the ellipse at any other stage of deformation.
The paper is organized as follows. The unilateral contact problem formulation and its
linearization are presented in Section 2, where a special case of the contact configuration
with one cartilage layer being plane and rigid is also considered in detail. In Section 3,
we derive exact general relationships between the contact approach and some integral characteristics of the contact pressure, including the contact force. In Section 3.3, we obtain
asymptotic representations for the contact pressure integral characteristics in terms of the
contact approach and some integral characteristics of the contact zone. The zero-order and
first-order asymptotic approximations for the solution to the contact problem are obtained in
Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. Namely, the first-order approximation problem constitutes
the main result of the present study.

Formulation of the contact problem

We consider a frictionless contact between two thin linear biphasic cartilage layers firmly
attached to rigid bones shaped like elliptic paraboloids. In the Cartesian co-ordinates
(x1 , x2 , z) = (x, z) the equations for the two cartilage surfaces can be written in the form
z = (−1)n Φ(n) (x), n = 1, 2, where
Φ(n) (x) =
(n)

(n)

2R1

x22
(n)

(2.1)

(n)

with R1 , R2 being the curvature radii of the n-th bone surface at its apex.
In the undeformed state, the cartilage-bone systems occupy convex domains z ≤ −Φ(1) (x)
and z ≥ Φ(2) (x), respectively. They are in the initial contact with the plane z = 0 at the
origin of the co-ordinate system.
We denote by w1 (x, t), w2 (x, t) the local vertical displacements of the corresponding
cartilage surfaces. Let also u1 (x, t), u2 (x, t) be the local horizontal (tangential) displacements
of the corresponding surface of the cartilages. Finally, we denote by P (x, t) the contact
pressure density. In this notation the equations for the cartilage surfaces can be written in
the following form:
z = δ1 (t) − Φ(1) (x + u1 (x, t)) + w1 (x, t),
(2.2)
z = −δ2 (t) + Φ(2) (x + u2 (x, t)) − w2 (x, t).
Here, δ1 , δ2 are some (positive) vertical displacements of the rigid bones. Note also that
the vertical displacements w1 , w2 are positive, while the tangential displacements u1 , u2 are
directed outside of the contact zone. Denoting by δ∗ (t) = δ1 (t) + δ2 (t) the contact approach
of the bones, we get from (2.2) the following inequality:
δ∗ (t) + w1 (x, t) + w2 (x, t) ≤ Φ(1) (x + u1 (x, t)) + Φ(2) (x + u2 (x, t)) .

(2.3)

It was shown in [8] (see also [4]) that vertical and the tangential displacements of each
bone can be represented in the form

Here ǫn = hn /a0 are dimensionless small parameters, h1 , h2 mean the thicknesses of the
cartilage layers, and a0 denotes a characteristic measure of the contact zone (see the detailed
description of the role of this parameter in [4]), Hn = (λs,n + 2µs,n )/µs,n are material parameters of cartilages, where λs,n and µs,n represent the first Lame coefficient and the shear

necessarily coincide, they depend on both spatial variables x1 , x2 , and on the time variable

Further the equality in (2.3), i.e.,

determines the contact area ω(t).
Now we substitute (2.6), (2.7) into (2.8) and obtain the governing equation relating the

Equation (2.14) is the equation for determination of the contact pressure Pε (x, t) ≥ 0,

Special case of the contact configuration

In order to check the content of formula (2.9) we consider here a special case, namely, we
suppose that the lower part cartilage layer is plane and rigid (the same assumption was
(1)
(1)
employed in [14]), it means that µs,2 = ∞ and R1 = R2 = ∞, i.e.,
Φ(1) ≡ 0,

Φ ≡ Φ(2) .

In this case we have got the following equation for determination of the contact domain ω(t)
in the form similar to (2.9):

General relationships between the solution components
Determination of the contact approach

In our model we assume that the external load is non-decreasing. Thus, the contact domain
is monotonically expanded, i.e.
ωε (t1 ) ⊆ ωε (t2 ),

∀t1 ≤ t2 .

(3.1)

It is convenient to suppose also that the contact pressure is defined on the whole plane. For
this we simply extend the density Pε (x, t) by assuming that
Pε (x, t) = 0,

∀x 6∈ ωε (t).

In particular, A0,0 (ω) is the area of the contact domain. It is to remember that the constants
Ak,l (ω) depend finally on t, but we omitted this fact in the notation in order to avoid
cumbersome expressions. Computations of Ak,l (ω) for the elliptic domain (2.17) we included
into Appendix (see Section 6.1).
Taking into account Eqs. (3.6) and (3.8), we get

This formula allows us to compute the contact approach δε (t) as a function of the total
external force F (t) and the main axes of the ellipse describing the shape of the contact zone,
which in fact depends on time too.

3.2

Some integral identity for the contact pressure

In order to write out a more informative equation for the contact load, we use the following
trick. We multiply both sides of (2.14) by the function v(x) = Ψ2 (x) and integrate the

paraboloids, no additional assumptions on the shape of the contact zone have been made.
On the other hand, no proof was offered to show that the contact zone is approximately
represented by an ellipse. This will be done later.
Remark 1. For every t for which the contact pressure Pε (t) is bounded and the contact
εN+1
region ω(t) belongs to a bounded domain, the remainder (N
µN +1 M(N +2) Pε (t) in formula

(3.26) tends to zero as N → ∞. Thus, the series corresponding to the sum on the right
hand-side of (3.26) is converging.

Asymptotic solution to the contact problem
Zero-order approximation

First, we get solution of the problem for ε = 0. In this case Eq. (2.14) has the form


∆P (0) (x, τ )dτ = µ Ψ1 (x) − δ (0) (t) ,

(4.1)

where Ψ1 (x) is defined in (2.15). Since we know from [5] that the contact zone is an ellipse
at this stage of approximation we will have
δε = δ (0) (t) = δε (b0 (t); β0 (t)) =

A1,0 (ω0 (t))
.
A0,0 (ω0 (t))

Using formula (4.2) and calculations presented in Section 6.1 (see formula (6.6)), one

Note that formulas (4.3) and (4.4) contain two known constants e1 and e2 defined in (2.15)

eccentricity of the ellipse

To find the functions b0 (t) and β0 (t) together with the pressure distribution over the
contact zone, P (0) (x, t), we follow [5] and introduce a new unknown function
(0)

p (x, t) = P

(0)

(x, t) + χ

Zt
0

P (0) (x, τ )dτ = KP (0) (x, t).

(4.10)

In the case of monotone external load, this function should satisfy the Poisson equation
(following from (2.9))

∆p(0) (x, t) = µ Ψ1 (x) − δ (0) (t) ,

x ∈ ω0 (t),

(4.11)

with the boundary conditions (2.18), (2.19).
It is customary to rewrite this relation in the form
G0 (x, t) = 0,

(4.12)

where
G0 (x, t) = G0 (b0 , β0 , δ0 )
(0)

(0)



≡ ∆p (x, t) − µ Ψ1 (x) − δ (t) , x ∈ ω0 (t).

(4.13)
(4.14)

Bearing in mind that the function Ψ1 (x) is a quadratic polynomial (compare with (2.15)),
it is natural to look for the solution of such problem in the form of a polynomial in x1 , x2 of
the fourth degree, that is


x21 β02 x22

Q0 (x1 , x2 ).
(4.15)
p (b0 , β0 , η0 , x, t) = η0 (t) 1 − 2 − 2
b0

13

Note that the term in the brackets vanishes on the boundary ω0 , and thus the condition
(2.18) is satisfied automatically.
In Section 6.2, it has been shown that Q0 is a polynomial of the second order having the
form


x21 β02 x22
Q0 (x1 , x2 ) = 1 − 2 − 2

Taken into account this representation we arrive at the following relations (see Section 6.3):

(4.20)
η0 (t) =
2(2β02 + 6β04 )
4β02 (1 + 3β02 )
This system allows us to determine the unknown functions b0 (t) and β0 (t). Indeed,
eliminating η0 from the last two equations, we get a bi-quadratic equation defining the value
of the parameter β0 , i.e.,
3β04 + (1 − e21 )β02 − 3e21 = 0.
(4.21)
η0 (t) =

By definition, β0 is a positive parameter, thus the unique positive solution of (4.21) has the
form
s
p
(e21 − 1) + e41 + 34e21 + 1
.
(4.22)
β0 =
6
Note that at the zero-approximation the parameter β0 does not depend on time. The other
parameter, η0 (t), can be computed directly from (4.19) or (4.20), if one knows the remaining
constant b0 (t). Moreover, taking into account (4.18) and (4.4), one can use an equivalent
formula
µb4 (β 2 + e21 )
η0 (t) = 0 2 0
.
(4.23)
16β0 (1 + β02 )
In the same way, one can offer, in addition to (4.4), two equivalent representations for
the indentation parameter

to the ellipse eccentricity β0 .
Now, it remains only to find the pressure over the contact area. Using (4.10) and (4.17),
we get

4.2

First-order approximation problem
(1)

For the next steps we consider an appropriately deformed contact domain ωε , defined as a
perturbation of the zero-order one ω0 . Namely, we assume that it can be written in the form
n
o
ωε(1) = ωε(1) (t) = (x1 , x2 ) : Q0 (x, t) + εQ1 (x, t) ≥ 0 ,

(4.32)

Q0 (x, t) = Q0 (x, β1 , b1 ),

(4.33)

Q1 (x, t) = a40 (t)x41 + a22 (t)x21 x22 + a04 (t)x42 .

(4.34)

where unknown polynomials are taken in the forms

Note that for ε = 0 the solution form coincides with (4.5), if one take b1 ≡ b0 , β1 ≡ β0 .
The idea behind such choice of the asymptotic anzatz is to satisfy the boundary conditions (2.18) and (2.19) automatically. This will be archived by putting

2 
Pε(1) = K−1 η (1) (t) Q0 (x1 , x2 , β1 (t), b1 (t)) + εQ1 (x, t) .
(4.35)

Now, when the boundary conditions are valid, we will satisfy the governing equation
(2.9). Note that
Pε(1) = P0 + εP1 + O(ε2),
(4.36)
where pj = K(Pj ), j = 0, 1, and

(1)

where the parameter δε is represented in the same form as Pε , i.e.,
δε(1) = δ0 + εδ1 + O(ε2) = δ (1) + O(ε2).

(4.40)

We can write Eq. (4.39) with the accuracy to the terms of O(ε2 ) as follows:

∆p(0) + ε∆p1 = µ Ψ1 − δ (1) − ε∇Ψ2 · ∇P (0) .

An extended variant of this equation can be written by using the definition of all components of the equation and by comparing coefficients at different powers of x1 , x2 , so that

Remark 2. Note that putting ε = 0, the system (4.42)–(4.47), (4.49) transforms to the
previous case evaluated in the previous section.
Remark 3. In the case when ε > 0, the system (4.42)–(4.47), (4.49) has to be solved
numerically. Note that the parameter ε in the last three equations (4.45) – (4.47) can be
canceled. We left these multipliers here to explain the limiting case (ε = 0).

Discussion and conclusion

First of all, observe that at t = 0, the contact problem for biphasic layers reduces to that for
elastic incompressible layers. The contact problem in the latter case were studied in a number
of papers [1, 9, 10, 16], however, without taking into account the tangential displacements.
To solve the resulting problem (4.42)–(4.47) and (4.49), we suggest the following iterative
algorithm:
• Taking ε = 0, we have computed all values η, b, β, δ = η0 , b0 , β0 , δ0 from the zero-order
approximation.
• Having them we can compute the quantity θ2k,2l (t) from (4.48),
• Then, from the system of three equations (4.45)–(4.47) we compute the constants
a40 , a22 , a04 assuming the values of η, b, β as above.
• Finally from the system of four equations (4.42)–(4.44) and (4.49) considering the righthand side known (computed by the values know from the previous computations), we
found new values η, b, β, δ and compare them with the previous computations. If the
required accuracy has achieved we stop the computation, if not we are going to the
second step of this iterative procedure.
We note that formulas (2.4) and (2.5) for the vertical and tangential displacements
contain different powers of parameters ǫ, namely, ǫ2 and ǫ, respectively. Note also that our
analysis (with the values of another parameters taken into account) shows, that the role
of these magnitudes (vertical and tangential displacements) is quite opposite. In the final
equation (see (2.14)) the leading terms, corresponding to the vertical displacement, contain
the zero power of the new small parameter ε, but the leading terms, corresponding to the
tangential displacements, contain the first power of ε.

Q0 (x1 , x2 ) = 1 + q1,0 x1 + q0,1 x2 + q2,0 x21 + q1,1 x1 x2 + q0,2 x22 ,
we need to compute the normal derivative of the unknown functions p(0) (4.15) along the
elliptic boundary Γ:

Here we take into account the fact that, since the contact domain is an ellipse (4.5), the
tangential and normal vectors to the boundary Γ = ∂Ω are given by

(6.8)
Then, to satisfy the boundary condition (2.19) the following equation should be valid:
Q0 |Γ = 0.
This, in turn, is equivalent to the representation

and taking into account that
Ψ1 (x) = Ψ1 (x1 , x2 ) = x21 + e21 x22 ,
one concludes that the expression for G0 is represented by a second order polynomial with
respect to the independent variables x1 and x2 in the following form:
G0 (b0 , β0 , η0 , δ (0) ) = q0 (b0 , β0 , η0 , δ (0) ) + q1 (b0 , β0 , η0 )x21 + q2 (b0 , β0 , η0 )x22 .

We also use the following representations:

Thus, applying the gradient operator, we simply get
∇Ψ2 (x) = 2x1 , 2e22 x2
and
