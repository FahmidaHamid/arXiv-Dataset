Abstract: - An approach for approximately calculating the number of genes in a genome is presented, which
takes into account the average protein length expected for the species. A number of virus, bacterial and
eukaryotic genomes are scrutinized. Genome figures are presented, which support the average protein size of a
species as a criterion for assessing life complexity. The human gene distribution in the 23 chromosomes is
investigated emphasizing the genomic rate, the mean ‘exon’ length, and the mean ‘exons’ per gene. It is shown
that storing all genes of a single human definitely requires less than 12 MB.
Key-Words: - Genome complexity, genomic information, average protein size, human genome.

1 Introduction
The analysis of genomic information [1-2] is
receiving wide attention, especially because of its
importance in the early diagnosis of diseases, and
novel tools are expected to emerge [3]. In living
organisms, an assessment of their number of genes
can be made before sequencing the complete
genome. This can usually be derived taking into
consideration some expected coding density. The
probing starts with bacterial genomes; the
evaluation of such genomes showed that the number
of genes is, as a rule of thumb, numerically equal to
the genome size expressed in kbp. An investigation
of the average size of bacterial proteins reveals 350
amino acid residues as typical. Continuing with a
much more intricate organism, the C. elegans was
chosen, which has a genome of 99 Mbp and a
genomic rate of 25%. Its protein size distribution
has an average polypeptide length of 469 amino
acids. A number of human proteins are quite long;
serum albumin has 609 amino acid residues,
collagen about 1,000, apolipoprotein B 4,536, and
human Titin 26,926. It is therefore possible to
predict an average human protein size at least as
long as 600 amino acid residues. The aim of this
paper is to show that the number g of genes of a
genome can be estimated using the genome length C
(bp), the genomic rate R and the average protein size
L
(expressed by the number of amino acid
residues). The human genome will particularly be
focused in the light of this approach.

2 Genes,

Genomic Information

and

A DNA code is specified by the triplet DNA(C,R,),
where C is genome size (bp), R is genomic rate
and is coding density (genes/bp). R is defined here
as the ratio between the number of protein-coding
base pairs and the total number C of base pairs of
the genome. This figure provides a clue to the
redundancy of the code [4]. Further DNA coding
parameters are g, E and e, where g is the number of
genes of the genome, E is the average length of
‘exons’ and e is the average number of ‘exons’ per
gene. The following relationships among parameters
hold:

g  C /

and

e.E  R .

(1)

Furthermore, the amount of information on the
genome can be estimated by considering 2 bits per
coding base pair (for the sake of simplicity,
Shannon information is not adopted here).
This note introduces an approach for deriving
novel estimates of DNA code parameters, taking
into account the average length of polypeptide
chains of proteins expressed by the genes. For a
given genomic rate R, the number of genes can be
computed by
g

CR
genes,
3L

(2)

where L is the average number of amino acid
residues (aa) of proteins. The coding density can
also be estimated in terms of the expected protein
size according to


C 3L

bp/gene.
g
R

(3)

For instance, the average bacterial protein is often
around 300 amino acids long, and the genomic rate
is typically in the range from 0.8 to 0.9. Bacteria
usually have a coding density   1,000 bp/gene so
their number of genes is, roughly speaking,
numerically equal to the genome length expressed in
kbp, i.e. g  C/1,000 (this is striking confirmed at
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenomeAtlas/).
Synthesized proteins from RNA translation have
different lengths, usually ranging from 30 to more
than 20,000 amino acids. An analysis of the protein
length distribution in several microorganisms was
previously reported [5].

The mean of the protein size distribution depends
on the complexity of the organism. Fig. 1 shows the
protein size histograms for three straightforward
organisms, the X174 and the phage viruses
(Fig.1A) and the C. elegans (Fig.1B).
The coding density of different chromosomes of
lower eukaryotic species is roughly the same, i.e.
shows only slight fluctuations from one
chromosome to another in the same organism. The
S. cerevisiae (C=12,057,849 bp, g=6,268 genes) has
an average coding density 1,947 bp/gene
considering its 15 chromosomes. The six
chromosomes of the C. elegans (C=98,971,533 bp,
g=17,585 genes) present an average coding density
of 5,731 bp/gene. The coefficient of variation (CV
%) of the coding density is 5.06 % for S. cerevisiae,
and 1.72 % for the C. elegans. A reasonable
evaluation for the coding density can therefore be
used to derive a sound guesstimate of the number of
genes. In contrast, higher eukaryotic cells are
actually much more intricate: their coding density
may fluctuate considerably from chromosome to
chromosome. As a consequence, the task of
estimating the number of genes becomes tricky.
This piece of evidence is addressed in the next
section.

from one chromosome to another.

simple organisms: (A) X174 and Bacteriophage ;
and (B) C. elegans.

Table 2 shows DNA parameters for some wellknown genomes, which comprise the virus  X174
[6], the microbial M. genitalium [7], H. pylori [8],
H. influenzae [9], S. aureus [10], B. subtilis [11], M.
tuberculosis [12], E. coli [13] and X. fastidiosa [14].

The average protein length was computed from
Eqn(2). Clearly, an increase in the complexity of the
organism is followed by a corresponding increase in
the average protein length, as expected. According
to Eqn(2), the average protein of C. elegans is 469
amino acids long, which is in agreement with its
protein distribution [15]. The bottom four lines of
Table 1 also include two possible scenarios for the
human genome. The question mark suggests that the
old-accepted estimate clearly underestimates the
expected length of the average human protein.
An early and unsuccessful attempt to explain the
complexity of living beings was the genome length.
The so-called C-value paradox rapidly proved that
this hypothesis was incorrect [16, 35]. The number
of genes was afterward often supposed to be related
to complexity. This reasoning partially biased
people to expect more genes than human actually
have. After all, how could one explain the fact that

humans are so much more intricate than
Drosophila? But is the C. elegans more complex
than the Drosophila? It appears that life complexity
is enormously sensitive to the protein length
distribution. A potential measure that correlated
with the complexity of beings could be its average
protein size.
The genomic information gives an inkling of the
file length required for storing only the proteincoding genes of the genome, without data
compression. It is worthy of note that all genes of a
bacterial genome can easily be stored in a single
floppy disk (1.54 MB). Surprisingly, storing all
genes of a single human will definitely require less
than 12 MB (a typical CD has 700 MB and a
PenDrive 256 MB available), albeit the entire the
human DNA sequence requires about 1 GB.

3 Figures of the Human Genome
There had been many attempts to estimate the
number of human genes indirectly. In the mid-1980s,
it was suggested that there might be about 100,000.
This estimate, widespread in 80’s and late 90’s, was
based on a typical genome of ~3 Gbp (bp=base pairs)
after eliminating highly repetitive sequences and

assuming a human coding density in the order of
20,000 bp/gene [17]. This figure was led to being
widely quoted in many textbooks [15-17]. Until the
end of the previous century, most guesstimates of
the number of genes in human beings ranged from
50,000 to 100,000. Estimates based on ESTs
suggested 120,000 genes [18]. Extrapolating from
the number of CpG islands with known genes made
an estimate of 70,00-80,000 human genes [19]. The
analysis of sequence tags indicated 35,000 genes
[20]. Comparison of whole-genome shotgun

sequence from the pufferfish with the human
genome was used to estimate the density of ‘exons’,
suggesting around 30,000 human genes [21].
This paper corroborates the paucity of human
genes currently accepted [22-23]. Our claim is
substantiated by taking into account the average
protein length expected for humans. Deloucas et al.,
1998 [24] proposed a physical map of 30 kgenes,
but rooted in customary estimates of that epoch,
they argued, “…containing perhaps half of all
human genes” (sic). This rough calculation of the
number of human genes shows no discrepancy with
further estimates derived since the human genome
sequence was published [25].
The estimated number for the number of proteincoding genes of higher eukaryotic organisms is
usually somewhat different, due to their particular
DNA structure. Brief comments on previous
estimates of the number of human genes are also
presented. Let C’ and ’ denote, respectively, the
genome size and the coding density with the
exception of highly repetitive sequences [26]. About
one third of high eukaryotic DNA corresponds to
these sequences, which are not transcribed, but may
have structural properties [17]. Therefore, C’=2C/3
and ’=2/3. The number of genes can be estimated
according to the formula
g

C





genes.
'

(4)

The superscript “prime” refers to the expurgated
genome, i.e. highly repeated sequences apart.
The largely widespread estimate until late 90’s for
human genome assumed C’  2,000 Mbp and
’  20,000 bp/gene in Eqn(4), thereby yielding
100,000 genes [17]. However, no account was taken
of the fact that such a density leads to an average
polypeptide barely 300 amino acid residue in length.
Human beings may have L  600 aa, so a much
more realistic estimate from Eqn(2) gives g 48,300
genes. Nevertheless, the key most up-to-date
refinement must be concerned with the genomic rate,
assumed to be R=1.6% instead of 3.0% [22]
yielding g 25,800. Values for the coding density ’
can be estimated now from  '  C ' / g (Table 2).
Many times, it was not clear whether pseudogenes
were expurgated or not in the number of genes
guesstimates. This fact partially accounts for some
misunderstanding on the gene amount of the human
genome.

Table 3 presents an expected gene distribution in
the 23 human chromosomes, considering the
computerized DNA database1. This rough
calculation of the number of human genes shows no
discrepancy with further estimates derived since the
human genome sequence was published [25].

this distribution is rather speculative, it may furnish

expected in a particular chromosome. The unveil

the approaches for approximately calculating the
quantity of genes is just accurate enough to provide
an order of magnitude, the reasoning presented
here — even if somewhat speculative — is an
additional sign that fewer genes than 25 kgenes are
to be anticipated. The ultimate answer is expected to

4 Conclusion
This short note discussed about genome figures
with focus on its average length of polypeptide
chains of proteins expressed by the genes.
Relationships were derived among parameters such
as genome size, genomic rate, coding density,
average number of aa residues of proteins, average
length of ‘exons’ and average number of ‘exons per
gene’. The human genome was specially considered,
presenting a plausible gene distribution in human
chromosomes. It was shown that it presents
typically an average length of ‘exon’ about 300 bp,
the average length of ‘intron’ about 6,900 bp, there
is a mean of about 6 exons/gene (from single-exon
genes to 175 exon for the Titin gene!) and the
average number of residues for coded-proteins is
close to 600 aa. Finally, the preliminary numbers of
this study also points out to the average protein size
as a worthy criterion for assessing life complexity.
This study was partially supported by the Brazilian
National Research Council (CNPq) through research
grants # 306049 (NSSM) and # 306180 (HMdO).
