Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become an essential tool for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Grelaud et
al. (2009, Bayesian Ana 3:427–442) advocated the use of ABC for
model choice in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on
a inter-model sufficiency property to show that the approximation
was legitimate. We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range
of phylogenetic models in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al.
(2008) Bioinfo 24:2713–2719). We now present arguments as to
why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing,
since the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced
by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation
error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison
may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical
verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those
available in DIYABC are necessary to conduct model choice. 1

nference on population genetic models such as coalescent
trees is one representative example of cases when statistical
analyses like Bayesian inference cannot easily operate because
the likelihood function associated with the data cannot be
computed in a manageable time (Tavaré et al., 1997; Beaumont et al., 2002; Cornuet et al., 2008). The fundamental
reason for this impossibility is that the model associated with
coalescent data has to integrate over trees of high complexity.
In such settings, traditional approximation tools like
Monte Carlo simulation (Robert and Casella, 2004) from the
posterior distribution are unavailable for practical purposes.
Indeed, due to the complexity of the latent structures defining the likelihood (like the coalescent tree), their simulation
is too unstable to bring a reliable approximation in a manageable time. Such complex models call for a practical if
cruder approximation method, the ABC methodology (Tavaré
et al., 1997; Pritchard et al., 1999). This rejection technique
bypasses the computation of the likelihood via simulations
from the corresponding distribution (see Beaumont, 2010 and
Lopes and Beaumont, 2010 for recent surveys, and Csillèry
et al., 2010a for the wide and successful array of applications
based on implementations of ABC in genomics and ecology).
We argue here that ABC is a generally valid approximation method for doing Bayesian inference in complex models.
However, without further justification, ABC methods cannot
be trusted to discriminate between two competing models
when based on insufficient summary statistics. We exhibit
simple examples in which the information loss due to insufficiency leads to inconsistency, i.e. when the ABC model selection fails to recover the true model, even with infinite amounts
of observation and computation. On the one hand, ABC using
the entire data leads to a consistent model choice decision but
it is clearly infeasible in most settings. On the other hand,
too much information loss due to insuffiency leads to a statistically invalid decision procedure. The challenge is in achieving
a balance between information loss and consistency. Theo-

retical results that mathematically validate model choice for
insufficient statistics are currently lacking on a general basis.
Our conclusion at this stage is to opt for a cautionary
approach in ABC model choice, handling it as an exploratory
tool rather than trusting the Bayes factor approximation. The
corresponding degree of approximation cannot be evaluated,
except via Monte Carlo evaluations of the model selection
performances of ABC. More empirical measures such as those
proposed in the DIY-ABC software (Cornuet et al., 2008) and
in Ratmann et al. (2009) thus seem to be the only available
solution at the current time for conducting model comparison.
We stress that, while Templeton (2008, 2010) repeatedly
expressed reservations about the formal validity of the ABC
approach in statistical testing, those criticisms were rebutted
in Beaumont et al. (2010); Csillèry et al. (2010b); Berger et al.
(2010) and are not relevant for the current paper.

Statistical Methods
The ABC algorithm. The setting in which ABC operates is the
approximation of a simulation from the posterior distribution
π(θ|y) ∝ π(θ)f (y|θ) when distributions associated with both
the prior π and the likelihood f can be simulated (the later
being unavailable in closed form). The first ABC algorithm
was introduced by Pritchard et al. (1999) as follows: given
a sample y from a sample space D, a sample (θ1 , . . . , θM ) is
produced by
Algorithm 1: ABC sampler
for i = 1 to N do
repeat
Generate θ 0 from the prior distribution π(·)
Generate z from the likelihood f (·|θ 0 )
until ρ{η(z), η(y)} ≤ 
set θ i = θ 0 ,
end for
The parameters of the ABC algorithm are the so-called
summary statistic η(·), the distance ρ{·, ·}, and the tolerance
level  > 0. The approximation of the posterior distribution
π(θ|y) provided by the ABC sampler is to instead sample
from the marginal in θ of the joint distribution
π (θ, z|y) = R

π(θ)f (z|θ)IA,y (z)

π(θ)f (z|θ)dzdθ
A,y ×Θ

where IB (·) denotes the indicator function of B and
A,y = {z ∈ D|ρ{η(z), η(y)} ≤ } .
The basic justification of the ABC approximation is that,
when using a sufficient statistic η and a small (enough) tolerance , we have
Z
π (θ|y) = π (θ, z|y)dz ≈ π(θ|y) .

In practice, the statistic η is necessarily insufficient (since
only exponential families enjoy sufficient statistics with fixed
dimension, see Lehmann and Casella, 1998) and the approximation then converges to the less informative π(θ|η(y)) when
 goes to zero. This loss of information is a necessary price
to pay for the access to computable quantities and π(θ|η(y))
provides a convergent inference on θ when θ is identifiable
in the distribution of η(y) (Fearnhead and Prangle, 2010).
While acknowledging the gain brought by ABC in handling
Bayesian inference in complex models, and the existence of involved summary selection mechanisms (Joyce and Marjoram,
2008; Nunes and Balding, 2010), we demonstrate here that the
loss due to the ABC approximation may be arbitrary in the
specific setting of Bayesian model choice via posterior model
probabilities.

As detailed in Beaumont et al. (2010), it provides a valid criterion for model comparison that is naturally penalised for
model complexity.
Bayesian model choice proceeds by creating a probability
structure across M models (or likelihoods). It introduces the
model index M as an extra unknown parameter, associated
with its prior distribution, π(M = m) (m = 1, . . . , M ), while
the prior distribution on the parameter is conditional on the
value m of the M index, denoted by πm (θ m ) and defined on
the parameter space Θm . The choice between those models is
then driven by the posterior distribution of M,

belief is false: There have been at least three independent introductions from North America during the past two decades.
The above estimate is improved by regression regularisation (Fagundes et al., 2007), where model indices are processed as categorical variables in a polychotomous regression.
When comparing two models, this involves a standard logistic regression. Rejection-based approaches were lately introduced by Cornuet et al. (2008), Grelaud et al. (2009) and
Toni et al. (2009), in a Monte Carlo simulation of model indices as well as model parameters. Those recent extensions
are already widely used in population genetics, as exemplified by Belle et al. (2008); Cornuet et al. (2010); Excoffier
et al. (2009); Ghirotto et al. (2010); Guillemaud et al. (2009);
Leuenberger and Wegmann (2010); Patin et al. (2009); Ramakrishnan and Hadly (2009); Verdu et al. (2009); Wegmann
and Excoffier (2010). Another illustration of the popularity
of this approach is given by the availability of four softwares
implementing ABC model choice methodologies:
• ABC-SysBio, which relies on a SMC-based ABC for infer-

ence in system biology, including model-choice (Toni et al.,
2009).
• ABCToolbox which proposes SMC and MCMC implementations, as well as Bayes factor approximation (Wegmann
et al., 2011).
• DIYABC, which relies on a regularised ABC-MC algorithm
on population history using molecular markers (Cornuet
et al., 2008).
• PopABC, which relies on a regular ABC-MC algorithm for
genealogical simulation (Lopes et al., 2009).
As exposed in e.g. Grelaud et al. (2009), Toni and Stumpf
(2010), or Didelot et al. (2011), once M is incorporated within
the parameters, the ABC approximation to its posterior follows from the same principles as in regular ABC. The corresponding implementation is as follows, using for the summary
statistic a statistic η(z) = {η1 (z), . . . , ηM (z)} that is the concatenation of the summary statistics used for all models (with
an obvious elimination of duplicates).

k

where wk (y) denotes the marginal likelihood for model k.
While this posterior distribution is straightforward to interpret, it offers a challenging computational conundrum in
Bayesian analysis. When the likelihood is not available, ABC
represents the almost unique solution. Pritchard et al. (1999)
describe the use of model choice based on ABC for distinguishing between different mutation models. The justification
behind the method is that the average ABC acceptance rate
associated with a given model is proportional to the posterior
probability corresponding to this approximative model, when
identical summary statistics, distance, and tolerance level are
used over all models. In practice, an estimate of the ratio of
marginal likelihoods is given by the ratio of observed acceptance rates. Using Bayes formula, estimates of the posterior
probabilities are straightforward to derive. This approach has
been widely implemented in the literature (see, e.g., Estoup
et al., 2004, Miller et al., 2005, Pascual et al., 2007, and Sainudiin et al., 2011).
A representative illustration of the use of an ABC model
choice approach is given by Miller et al. (2005) which analyses
the European invasion of the western corn rootworm, North
America’s most destructive corn pest. Because this pest was
initially introduced in Central Europe, it was believed that
subsequent outbreaks in Western Europe originated from this
area. Based on an ABC model choice analysis of the genetic
variability of the rootworm, the authors conclude that this

the use of a local linear regression in Beaumont et al. (2002)

π(M = m|y) based on the ABC output. This modelling is
implemented in the DIYABC software.

The specific case of Gibbs random fields. In an apparent contradiction with the above, Grelaud et al. (2009) showed that
the computation of the posterior probabilities of Gibbs random fields under competition can be done via ABC techniques, which provide a converging approximation to the true
Bayes factor. The reason for this result is that, for these
models in the above ratio [ 1 ], g1 (y) = g2 (y). The validation
of an ABC comparison of Gibbs random fields is thus that
their specific structure allows for a sufficient statistic vector
that runs across models and therefore leads to an exact (when
 = 0) simulation from the posterior probabilities of the models. Each Gibbs random field model has its own sufficient
statistic ηm (·) and Grelaud et al. (2009) exposed the fact that
the vector of statistics η(·) = (η1 (·), . . . , ηM (·)) is also sufficient for the joint parameter (M, θ 1 , . . . , θ M ).
Didelot et al. (2011) point out that this specific property
of Gibbs random fields can be extended to any exponential
family (hence to any setting with fixed-dimension sufficient
statistics, see Lehmann and Casella, 1998). Their argument
is that, by including all sufficient statistics and all dominating
measure statistics in an encompassing model, models under
comparison are submodels of the encompassing model. The
concatenation of those statistics is then jointly sufficient across
models. While this encompassing principle holds in full generality, in particular when comparing models that are already
embedded, we think it leads to an overly optimistic perspective about the merits of ABC for model choice: in practice,
most complex models do not enjoy sufficient statistics (if only
because they are beyond exponential families). The Gibbs
case processed by Grelaud et al. (2009) therefore happens to
be one of the very few realistic counterexamples. As demonstrated in the next section and in the normal example in SI,
using insufficient statistics is more than a mere loss of information. Looking at what happens in the limiting case when
one relies on a common model-wise sufficient statistic is a formal but useful study since it brings light on the potentially
huge discrepancy between the ABC-based and the true Bayes
factors. To develop a solution to the problem in the formal
case of the exponential families does not help in understanding
the discrepancy for non-exponential models.

Arbitrary ratios. The difficulty with the discrepancy between
η
B12 (y) and B12
(y) is that this discrepancy is impossible to
evaluate in a general setting, while there is no reason to expect a reasonable agreement between both quantities. A first
illustration was produced by Marin et al. (2011) in the case
of MA(q) models.
A simple illustration of the discrepancy due to the use of
a model-wise sufficient statistic is a a sample y = (y1 , . . . , yn )
that could come either from a Poisson P(λ) distribution or
from a geometric G(p) distribution, already introduced in
Grelaud et al. (2009) as a counter-example to Gibbs random fields and later reprocessed in Didelot et al. (2011) to
support
P their sufficiency argument. In this case, the sum
S = n
i=1 yi = η(y) is a sufficient statistic for both models
but not across models. The distribution of the sample given
S is a multinomial M(S, 1/n, . . . , 1/n) distribution when the
data is Poisson,
P while it is the uniform distribution over the
y’s such that i yi = S in the geometric case, since S is then
a negative binomial N eg(n, p) variable. The discrepancy ratio
is therefore

When simulating n Poisson or geometric variables and using prior distributions as exponential λ ∼ E(1) and uniform
p ∼ U(0, 1) on the parameters of the respective models, the
exact Bayes factor is available and the distribution of the discrepancy is therefore available. Fig 1 gives the range of B12 (y)

versus B12
(y), showing that B12
(y) is then unrelated with
B12 (y): the values produced by both approaches have nothη
ing in common. As noted above, the approximation B12
(y)
based on the sufficient statistic S is producing figures of the
magnitude of a single observation, while the true Bayes factor
is of the order of the sample size.
The discrepancy between both Bayes factors is in fact increasing with the sample size, as shown by the following result:

Therefore, the Bayes factor based on the statistic S(y) is
not consistent; it converges to a non-zero, finite value.
In this specific
setting, Didelot et al. (2011) show that
Q
adding P = i yi ! to the S creates a statistic (S, P ) that is
sufficient across both models. While this is mathematically
correct, it does not provide further understanding of the behaviour of ABC-model choice in realistic settings: outside formal examples as the one above and well-structured if complex
exponential families like Gibbs random fields, it is not possible to devise completion mechanisms that ensure sufficiency
across models, or even select well-discriminating statistics. It
is therefore more fruitful to study and detect the diverging
behaviour of the ABC approximation as given, rather than
attempting at solving the problem in a specific and formal
case.

Population genetics. We recall that ABC has first been introduced by population geneticists (Beaumont et al., 2002;
Pritchard et al., 1999) for statistical inference about the evolutionary history of species, because no likelihood-based approach existed apart from very simple and hence unrealistic

probabilities of evolutionary scenarios, we designed two experiments based on simulated data with limited information
content, so that the choice between scenarios is problematic.
This setting thus provides a wide enough set of intermediate
values of model posterior probabilities, in order to better evaluate the divergence between ABC and likelihood estimates.
In the first experiment, we consider two populations (1
and 2) having diverged at a fixed time in the past and a third
population (3) having diverged from one of those two populations (scenarios 1 and 2 respectively). Times are set to 60
generations for the first divergence and to 30 generations for
the second divergence. One hundred pseudo observed datasets
have been simulated, represented by 15 diploid individuals per
population genotyped at five independent microsatellite loci.
These loci are assumed to evolve according to the strict Stepwise Mutation model (SMM), i.e. when a mutation occurs, the
number of repeats of the mutated gene increases or decreases

situations. This approach has since been used in an increasing
number of biological studies (Estoup et al., 2004; Estoup and
Clegg, 2003; Fagundes et al., 2007), most of them including
model choice. It is therefore crucial to get insights in the validity of such studies, particularly when they deal with species of
economical or ecological importance (see, e.g., Lombaert et al.,
2010). To this end, we need to compare ABC estimates of
posterior probabilities to reliable likelihood-based estimates.
Combining different modules based on Stephens and Donnelly
(2000), it is possible to approximate the likelihood of population genetic data through importance sampling (IS) even
in complex scenarios. In order to evaluate the potential discrepancy between ABC-based and likelihood-based posterior

Importance Sampling estimates of P(M=1|y) with 50,000 particles

by one unit with equal probability. The mutation rate, common to all five loci, has been set to 0.005 and effective population sizes to 30. In this experiment, both scenarios have
a single parameter: the effective population size, assumed to
be identical for all three populations. We chose a uniform
prior U [2, 150] for this parameter (the true value being 30).
The IS algorithm was performed using 100 coalescent trees per
particle. The marginal likelihood of both scenarios has been
computed for the same set of 1000 particles and they provide
the posterior probability of each scenario. The ABC computations have been performed with DIYABC (Cornuet et al.,
2008). A reference table of 2 million datasets has been simulated using 24 usual summary statistics (provided in Table
S1) and the posterior probability of each scenario has been
estimated as their proportion in the 500 simulated datasets
closest to the pseudo observed one. This population genetic

setting does not allow for a choice of sufficient statistics, even
at the model level.
The second experiment also opposes two scenarios including three populations, two of them having diverged 100 generations ago and the third one resulting of a recent admixture
between the first two populations (scenario 1) or simply diverging from population 1 (scenario 2) at the same time of 5
generations in the past. In scenario 1, the admixture rate is
0.7 from population 1. Pseudo observed datasets (100) of the
same size as in experiment 1 (15 diploid individuals per population, 5 independent microsatellite loci) have been generated
for an effective population size of 1000 and mutation rates
of 0.0005. In contrast with experiment 1, analyses included
the following 6 parameters (provided with corresponding priors): admixture rate (U [0.1, 0.9]), three effective population
sizes (U [200, 2000]), the time of admixture/second divergence
(U [1, 10]) and the time of the first divergence (U [50, 500]). To
account for an higher complexity in the scenarios, the IS algorithm was performed with 10,000 coalescent trees per particle.
Apart from this change, both ABC and likelihood analyses
have been performed in the same way as experiment 1.
Fig 2 shows a reasonable fit between the exact posterior
probability of model 1 (evaluated by IS) and the ABC approximation in the first experiment on most of the 100 simulated
datasets, even though the ABC approximation is biased towards 0.5. When using 0.5 as the decision boundary between
model 1 and model 2, there is hardly any discrepancy between
both approaches, demonstrating that model choice based on
ABC can be trusted in this case. Fig 3 considers the same setting when moving from 24 to 15 summary statistics (given in
Table S1): the fit somehow degrades. In particular, the number of opposite conclusions in the model choice moves to 12%.
In the more complex setting of the second experiment, the discrepancy worsens, as shown on Fig 4. The number of opposite
conclusions reaches 26% and the fit between both versions of
the posterior probabilities is considerably degraded, with a
correlation coefficient of 0.643.

The validity of the importance sampling approximation
can obviously be questioned in both experiments, however
Fig 5 and Fig 6 display a strong stability of the posterior
probability IS approximation across 10 independent runs for
5 different datasets and gives proper confidence in this approach. Increasing the number of loci to 50 and the sample
size to 100 individuals per population (see SI) leads to posterior probabilities of the true scenario overwhelmingly close
to one (Fig 7), thus bluring the distinction between ABC and
likelihood based estimates but also reassuring on the ability
of ABC to provide the right choice of model with a higher
information content of the data. Actually, we note that, for
this experiment, all ABC-based decisions conclude in favour
of the correct model.

Discussion
Since its introduction by Tavaré et al. (1997) and Pritchard
et al. (1999), ABC has been extensively used in several areas
involving complex likelihoods, primarily in population genetics, both for point estimation and testing of hypotheses. In
realistic settings, with the exception of Gibbs random fields,
which satisfy a resilience property with respect to their sufficient statistics, the conclusions drawn on model comparison
cannot be trusted per se but require further simulations analyses as to the pertinence of the (ABC) Bayes factor based
on the summary statistics. This paper has examined in details only the case when the summary statistics are sufficient
for both models, while practical situations imply the use of
insufficient statistics. The rapidly increasing number of applications estimating posterior probabilities by ABC indicates a
clear need for further evaluations of the worth of those estimations.
Further research is needed for producing trustworthy approximations to the posterior probabilities of models. At this
stage, unless the whole data is involved in the ABC approximation as in Sousa et al. (2009), our conclusion on ABCbased model choice is to exploit the approximations in an
exploratory manner as measures of discrepancies rather than
genuine posterior probabilities. This direction relates with
the analyses found in Ratmann et al. (2009). Furthermore,
a version of this exploratory analysis is already provided in
the DIY-ABC software of (Cornuet et al., 2008). An option
in this software allows for the computation of a Monte Carlo
evaluation of false allocation rates resulting from using the
ABC posterior probabilities in selecting a model as the most
likely. For instance, in the setting of both our population genetic experiments, DIY-ABC gives false allocation rates equal
to 20% (under scenarios 1 and 2) and 14.5% and 12.5% (under scenarios 1 and 2), respectively. This evaluation obviously
shifts away from the performances of ABC as an approximation to the posterior probability towards the performances of
the whole Bayesian apparatus for selecting a model, but this
nonetheless represents a useful and manageable quality assessment for practitioners.

a.s.

Fig 8 illustrates the behaviour of the discrepancy ratio
when σ1 = 0.1 and σ2 = 10, for datasets of size n = 15 simulated according to both models. The discrepancy (expressed
on a log scale) is once again dramatic, in concordance with
the above lemma.
If we now turn to an alternative choice of sufficient statistic, using the pair (ȳ, S 2 ) with
S2 =

n
X
(yi − ȳ)2 ,

we follow the solution of Didelot et al. (2011). Using a conjugate prior µ ∼ N (0, a2 ), the true Bayes factor is equal to the
Bayes factor based on the corresponding distributions of the
pair (ȳ, S 2 ) in the respective models. Therefore, with sufficient computing power, the ABC approximation to the Bayes
factor can be brought arbitrarily close to the true Bayes factor. However, this coincidence does not bring any intuition on
the behaviour of the ABC approximations in realistic settings.

Larger experiment. We also considered a more informative
population genetic experiment with the same scenarios (1 and
2) as in the second experiment. One hundred datasets were
simulated under scenario 1 with 3 populations, i.e. 6 parameters. We take 100 diploid individuals per population, 50 loci
per individual. This thus corresponds to 300 genotypes per
dataset. The IS algorithm was performed using 100 coalescent
trees per particle. The marginal likelihood of both scenarios
has been computed for the same set for both 1000 particles
(IS1) and 50,000 particles (IS2). A national cluster of 376
processors (including 336 Quad Core processors) was used for
this massive experiment (which required more than 12 calendar days for the importance sampling part).
The confidence about the IS approximation can be assessed on Fig 7, which shows that both runs most always provide the same numerical value, which almost uniformly is very
close to one. This makes the fit of the ABC approximation
to the true value harder to assess, even though we can spot
a trend towards under-estimation. Furthermore, they almost
all lead to correctly select model 1.
