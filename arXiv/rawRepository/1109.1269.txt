Abstract
Verhulst logistic curve either grows OR decays, depending on the
growth rate parameter value. A similar situation is found in the Gompertz
law about human mortality. However, growth does not have to be infinite
nor reach a finite steady state at an infinite asymptotic time. Moreover,
before some decay, some growth must have occurred. For example, some
leveling-off could occur at finite time, followed either by some growth again
or then by some decay. Numerous examples show that the Verhulst and
Gompertz models are too reductive (or restrictive) descriptions of their
original purpose. It is aimed, in the present note, to encompass into ONE
simple differential equation the growth AND decay features of, e.g., population sizes, or numbers, but also of many other measured characteristics
found in social and physical science systems. Previous generalizations
of Verhulst or Gompertz functions are recalled. It is shown that drastic growth or decay jumps or turnovers can be readily described through
drastic changes in values of the growth or decay rate. However smoother
descriptions can be found if the growth or decay rate is modified in order
to take into account some time or size dependence. Similar arguments can
be carried through, but not so easily, for the so called carrying capacity,
indeed leading to more elaborate algebraic work.

Introduction

Verhulst 1845 seminal paper [1] bore on previous (1798) considerations by
Malthus [2] on population size evolution. Verhulst model attempts to describe
how the.growth (or mutatis mutandis its decay) of a single species towards its
equilibrium population is limited, taking into account the reproduction rate r
and the nowadays so called limiting capacity M , i.e., the maximum value the
population can reach in its environment., due to limited resources. He obtained
what he called the logistic curve (or map). In a subsequent paper, Verhulst [3]
attempted a different mathematical form of the blocking growth term, thereby
obtaining an exponentially slow approach of the carrying capacity, but not a
sigmoid.
There have been many considerations starting from Verhulst approach of
population size evolution, generalising his original work. However, it is of interest to recall that among the generalisations, one should distinguish between
those which stick to one single differential equation, and those which involve a
set of equations, because they consider a competition effect with another population. Among the former ones, I am fond of the 1939 work by Avrami [4]
on crystal growth, - the so called species changing its thermodynamic phase or
state, but there are many others. Among the latter, one has only to go back
to the work of Lotka, published [5], in 1925, and of Volterra [6], in 1931, pertaining to so called prey-predator models. Not attempting to cite here many
subsequent publications., let it be pointed out that Blanco [7] has suggested a
trivial relationship between the logistic equation and the Lotka-Volterra (LV)
models, indicating that the former is in fact a sort of limit of the LV equations,
pending a redefinition of the parameters.

However, growth can neither be infinite nor reach a finite steady state at an
infinite asymptotic time, as in the logistic map. Moreover before some decay,
some growth must have occurred. In particular, some leveling-off could occur
at finite time, though followed either by some growth again or then by some
decay, in both cases, with a smooth or an oscillatory variation.
It is of interest in contrast, to recall ideas byGompertz [8] who in a series of
papers near 1825 discussed ’the Nature of the Function Expressive of the Law
of Human Mortality, and (...) a New Mode of Determining the Value of Life
Contingencies”. The Gompertz model for describing the decreasing number
of members of a population can be in fact easily reformulated in terms of a
(simple first order differential) growth equation of Malthusian form, with an
exponentially decaying birth rate. This leads to another form of an analytical
sigmoid curve, though asymmetric, in contrast to the Verhulst logistic map.
In brief, depending on the sign of the parameters in Verhulst or Gompertz
approach, one can describe some growth or some decay see Fig. 1 (lhs). However
numerous examples show that both Verhulst and Gompertz modelisations are
thus too reductive (or restrictive) descriptions of their original purpose. Whence,
it is of interest to aim at finding some simple description combining some less
trivial behaviour, i.e. obviously, practically inducing some extremum at some
time in the function which should be the solution of a, by request, simple first
order differential equation. This is the aim of this note, i.e. to encompass into
ONE simple first order differential equation growth AND decay features of, e.g.,
population sizes, or numbers, but also of many other measured characteristics
found in social and physical science systems.
In Sect. 2, after recalling Malthus and Verhulst equations, a few applications
are mentioned in order to substantiate the broad framework in which Verhulst
equation can be applied. Growth, indeed, is not only found in population
studies, through counting the number of individuals in some system, but can be
measured through other means, like the number of stems, the mass, the length,
... of ”something”. It is often found, of course, that the Verhulst sigmoid is
only a rough representation of the data. Whence one has sometimes invented
artificially skewed logistic curves [9]; see Sect. 2, for a general introduction to
growth and such subsequent considerations.
Subsequent considerations on decay, with examples about languages and
religions, are to be found in Sect. 3, before outlining Gompertz law. Discussion
about bio-demography applications can be found in an interesting 1997 review,
up by Olshansky and Carnes [10]. Nevertheless, ad hoc, previous generalisations
of Verhulst or Gompertz functions are briefly recalled to conclude Sect. 3.
In Sect. 4, a few examples show that the Verhulst and Gompertz modelizations are indeed too reductive (or restrictive) descriptions of reality. However,
drastic growth or decay jumps or evolution turnovers can be readily described
through drastic changes in values of the growth or decay rate, as shown inSect.
5. Sometimes the evolution show drastic jumps or drops indeed, - due to exogenous or endogenous causes. However smoother descriptions must be found, i.e.
combining some less trivial behaviour. Obviously, one should aim at practically
inducing some extremum at some time in a smooth function which should be

the solution of a, by request, simple first order differential equation.
It is aimed, in Sect. 6, to encompass into such ONE simple differential
equation the growth AND decay features of population sizes, or numbers, but
also of many other measured characteristics found in social and physical science
systems. In fact one can observe that one could consider that he growth or decay
rate has either some time or some size dependence. The algebra is rather simple
in order to recover a Verhulst or Gompertz evolution equation.. In Sect. 7, the
time and/or size dependence of the so called carrying capacity is considered in
the same spirit as the growth rate. However this is less trivial, indeed leading
to more elaborate algebraic work. Sect. 8 serves as a conclusion.

Introduction to Growth

Following the above historical points, let us do some mathematics and data
analysis within Verhulst equation framework.

2.1

Growth equations

Recall Malthus model or rather his equation for describing a (normalized) population size x evolution as a function of time t, due to a birth rate r, i.e.
dx
= r x,
dt

(1)

which has the (catastrophic) exponential solution x(t) = ert .
The original Verhulst population growth model considers that resources are
limited, such that the evolution of the number of members N (t) in the population is described in terms of a carrying capacity M and a growth rate r,
according to


dN
N
= r N 1−
.
(2)
dt
M
With the change of variable x = N/M , if M is a constant, a dimensionless
form equation can be thereby written, i.e.
dx
= r x [1 − x] .
dt
It has for solution, the so called logistic map, a sigmoid curve,
x=

ert
,
1 + ert

(3)

(4)

if r is a constant as well. Notice that Verhulst had examined complicated forms
of the growth limiting term, like a square, but also a square root [1], both cases
without any theoretical justification, but aiming at better fitting available data
Indeed, there is no biological justification for this assumption; Gilpin, Case, &
Ayala [11] proposed a growth equation of the form dx/dt = r x[1 − (x/M )θ , a larger than 1 value of θ resulting in a steepening of the growth curve and a
higher value for the inflection point, as easily calculated.

2.2

Applications of the logistic map

Let us point out to a few cases of the ”Verhulst population growth model”, as
discussed during the oral presentation, in order to show some universality value
of the logistic map application.
• Population size: Beside those considered by Verhulst, an interesting application on population size is that of Montroll and Badger [12], in 1974,
who studied the USA population between 1810 and 1970. An interesting parameter value is found, i.e. r = 0.02984, which implies interesting
considerations on american sexuality during those times.
• Mass growth: However the logistic map can also be applied to, e.g., mass
growth, like in the report of Lee and Werning [13], in 2008, who compared
Alligators, Elephants, Shrews and Ostriches, on one hand, but in the other
hands Tenontosauruses, Allosauruses, and Tyrannosauruses, using skeletochronology; see reference [13] for the parameter r values, in kg/yr, and
subsequent discussions. For completeness, let us mention that the growth
curves were compared with an alternative model to that of Verhulst, i.e.
the von Bertalanffy [14] curve of mass accumulation.
• Length growth: As far as 1928, Pearl group studied the Cucumis Melo
stem length, either under field conditions [15] or in the absence of exogenous food and light [16]. The population was considered to be the number
of nodes. Notice that r is of the order of 0.7 in their observations.

2.3

Skewed logistic

In so doing, i.e., studying Canteloup growth, Pearl et al. empirically found that
one should generalised the logistic map in order to reproduce better the data.
Rather than the mere logistic, they propose a form like
y(t) =

k
,
1 + ea0 +a1 t+a2 t2 +...

(5)

where y, in [16], is the number of seedlings of the canteloups.
It is quasi obvious that a more general form is like
y(t) =

k
1 + ef (t)

(6)

to be discussed below.

3

Introduction to Decay

Recent applications along Verhulst (limited growth) approach have been concerned with the decay of a population size, rather than its growth.

6

3.1

Religions

The time evolution of several ”main” religions was considered to be described, at
a so called microscopic level, along the lines of the Avrami-Kolmogorov equation,
describing a liquid-solid state formation in a continuous time framework [17],
i.e. a peculiar form of Verhulst law [18]. The solution is usually written as
n

c(t) = 1 − e−Kt

(7)

where c(t) is the volume fraction being transformed from one phase to another;
K and n are adjustable parameters. However, it is ”obvious” that before decaying the number of adepts of any religion had to grow from the founder, N (0) = 1.
Nowadays, several ”religions” have still a growing number of adepts. Others
have reached a maximum, thus decay, or go again into a growing pattern. Population growth-death equations have thus been conjectured for modelling such
religion size evolution dynamics, in a continuous time framework [19], [20], [21],
[22], [23] and [24] attempting to describe the existence of maxima in the number
of adepts. An interpretation of the features, after data fitting, can resort to an
attachment parameter, as resulting from joining at first one’s ”mother religion”,
within exogenous field conditions, as one ”joins” at first one’s mother tongue.

3.2

Language death

For completeness, notice that the disappearance of world’s languages has also
been recently considered through a Verhulst time evolution equation in terms
of the number density ρi of practitioners of some language i, in [25] and [26],
i.e.,


ρi
∂ρi
= ri ρi 1 −
(8)
∂t
Ci
where Ci is the carrying capacity of the environment for the population speaking
the i language and ri is a ”negative growth” rate. The ri values are at this level
of no interest. However notice that the speakers do not fully represent a single so
called population, since their member evolution is toward a bilingual attitude.
In fact, there is a competition between two (or more) languages/populations,
- which according to the point of view mentioned in the Introduction rather
pertains to a prey-predator problem.

4

Gompertz Death law

In fact, previous to Verhulst, Gompertz [8] discussed human population mortality dynamics from a practicing actuary point of view. Gompertz used equal
long time intervals, i.e. 10 year long intervals, to observe that the differences
between the common logarithm of the number of persons living in such successive equal age intervals were almost identical during a significant portion of
their life span. Thus the numbers of living individuals in each yearly increase of
age are in geometrical progression. Whence mortality progresses geometrically
7

as age increases arithmetically. Therefore Gompertz proposed a 3 parameter
expression for the number N (t) of survivors of a population at time t:
N (t)/Ninf = exp[−b exp(−rt)],

(9)

where Ninf , b and r are positive constants. This corresponds to an exponentially
decaying birth rate r in Malthus equation, i.e. r = r0 e−κt , pending r0 and κ
being positive constants. For completeness, notice that Makeham introduced
an age independent mortality rate to be considered in order to better represent
available data [27], i.e. adding a A + Bt term in the right hand side of Eq.(9,
thus attempting to take into account extrinsic effects.
The easily derived differential equation describing the exponential rise in
death rates between sexual maturity and old age, is commonly referred to as
the Gompertz equation, i.e.,
 
k
dx
= r x log
(10)
dt
x
where k has mutatis mutandis the same meaning as M , the carrying capacity, in
the Verhulst approach. Notice that Gompertz and Makeham wondered whether
k can be interpreted in a socio-biological framework, i.e., as a biological limit
to life, based on some vital force.

4.1

Skewed Gompertz law

In the original Gompertz model, r and k are supposed to be constant; b, in
Eq.(9), and k, in Eq.(10), are related to each other through r and the initial
(or final) conditions on N (t). In 1924, Trachtenberg [28] already examined
extensions of Gompertz law, sometimes departing from Gompertz geometric
progression hypothesis, - extensions which do not necessarily lead to a sigmoid
curve, but can be called skewed Gompertz laws. One of them reads
2

N (t) = Ninf e[a+bt+ct

+dt3 +et4 ]

.

(11)

It can clearly be the solution of a second order differential equation for log(N (t)),
as wished by Gompertz, and presents two inflexion points at precise tα and tβ .
In fact, similarly to Eq.(6), the most general extension of a Gompertz form
can be hereby proposed to be
N (t) = Ninf exp[−b exp(−g(t))] .

4.2

(12)

Biomedical considerations

For the purpose of the reader general information, an interesting 1997 review
by Olshansky and Carnes [10], on ”ever since Gompertz”, should be quoted.
However, since the discussion is mainly about demography applications and
biological causes of mortality, in various species, - like the vital force concept

Figure 2: Evolution of the population in Bauduen, Var since ca. 1750
and in particular the influence of radiations, the paper content is quite aside
our present considerations. and not further elaborated upon, though of great
interest.
Nevertheless, it is of common knowledge that exogenous causes can manifest
themselves and influence some ”decay” in the number of living individuals in
a population. Take the trout population data of Lake Ontario measured by
Beeton [29], quoted by Meadows et al. [30], for example. Pollution is supposed
to be the influential external field. On the other hand, a case of endogenous-like
cause was noticed by Kormandy [31], in 1969, who commented on data, which
I did not find, and who stated that deer or goats, even though natural enemies
are absent, ”often overgraze their range and cause erosion or destruction of the
vegetation”, and consequently die. Finally, on the Bauduen, Var city wikipedia
website (http : //f r.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauduen) it is reported that the city
population, since 1793, increased till 1820, thereafter decreased till 1970 and is
going back up nowadays. In this case, sharp turnovers are found at the time of
war ends; see Fig. 2.

5

Growth and decay and growth and decay and
...

In the case of Lake Ontario trouts, here above mentioned [29], there is obviously
a maximum near 1925, followed by a rather sharp drop of three orders of mag9

nitude in 1955 or so. Similar though smoother, features are found for Bauduen
population (Fig. 2). In brief, such few examples should remind us that, in many
measurements, when counting the evolution of a population (of whatever), there
is a succession of maxima and minima, though the growth and decay regimes
can be of different sizes and time spans. Remember business cycles as well [32],
[33], [34], [35], or [36]. To debate on the evolution laws per se is out of question
here, but to find an equation containing both types of extrema is the goal of
this report, basing our considerations on either Verhulst or Gompertz equation.

5.1

Beyond Verhulst and Gompertz equations

In view of the above, it is obvious that many multiparameter extensions have
been proposed in order to ”improve” Verhulst or Gompertz laws [37], see App.
A. However, parameter justification is often missing, within our present requirements. Thus a simple mathematical framework to find several inflexion points on
a time dependent ”growth” curve is still of interest. One may imagine to introduce extra terms, representing endogenous or/and exogenous causes for growth
or decay in Verhulst or Gompertz formalisms, Let us mention Bass model [38] of
innovative and imitative behaviour of consumers, or Zwanzig introduction of a
(damped exponential) heredity kernel [39], both generalising Verhulst approach.
There is to my knowledge no equivalent extension within Gompertz framework.
However both, Bass and Zwanzig considerations, have more physical bases than
other purely mathematically oriented extensions.
For completeness, let us recall Bass model [38] of new product acquisition by
consumers; it leads to a single ”diffusion” equation with constant coefficients, perfectly suitable to our aims:
q
dX
= [N − X(t)] [p + ( )X(t)] .
dt
N

(13)

where X(t) is the number of product users at time t; N is the number of
potential users, like the carrying capacity previously, p is the so called coefficient
of innovation, and q is the so called coefficient of imitation. It is a Verhulst-like
equation, though the r.h.s has an extra zero order term. The solution reads
X(t) = N

1 − e−(p+q)t
.
1 + (q/p)e−(p+q)t

(14)

By differentiation, one can easily find the time at which the function has a
maximum and its value.
On the other hand, Zwanzig [39] writing of Verhulst equation amounts to a
change of variable ev = N/M , - somewhat as in Montroll [40] considering that
the evolution concerns log(N ) rather than N , and the introduction of a heredity
kernel K(t) = K(0) et/T , such that one obtains an integro-differential equation
(not written here). K(0)T is in fact like the growth rate r in Eq.(2). For finite
T , one obtains an oscillatory but damped evolution, with an overshoot of the
carrying capacity value in fact; see Fig. 1 in [39].
10

Both previous formalisms present at least one hump in the ”population” evolution. Nevertheless already within e.g. Verhulst framework, it can be observed
that describing either (i) sharp turn-overs or (ii) drop or jump transitions is
possible. It is for example, simple to introduce a drastic change in the r value.
Similar situations can be illustrated with Gompertz framework, as shown for
both cases here below.

5.2

Sharp turn-overs

The four possible cases of sharp turn-overs forcing a continuous evolution of the
population number, in a Verhulst approach, due to a drastic shift in r values,
i.e. from some r to some −r value, or the opposite, at some time t are shown
in Fig. 3. Similar curves are shown for the Gompertz evolution law on Fig. 4.
Notice the pronounced asymmetry in the latter case.

5.3

Drop or jump transitions

On the other hand, the four possible cases of population drops or jumps in a
Verhulst approach due to a drastic shift in r values, at some fixed time t are
shown in Fig. 5, as if a strong external event had influenced a shift from some
r to some −r, or the contrary. Similar curves are shown for the Gompertz
evolution law on Fig. 6.

5.4

Time and size roles

However such drastic change of signs of the growth rate are rather unlikely or
very rough approximation of reality. A smoother evolution of r must be searched
for. In this respect, let us recall that the dimension-prone Verhulst differential
equation, Eq.(2), is easily integrated,
• if the growth rate r is constant,
• and if the carrying capacity M is a constant.
Let us first observe that there are two equivalent ways to write both Verhulst
and Gompertz equations, either emphasising the time role or the size role.
5.4.1

Time role

It is easy to observe that, after an appropriate simple change of variables, the
corresponding differential equation to Eq.(3), e.g. for the skewed logistic, Eq.(6),
could read
b
dy
= y [k − y] v(t) ,
(15)
dt
k
- thereby defining v(t). One can easily integrate both sides of the equation, by
the technique of separation of variables, i.e.,
dy
b
= v(t) dt ,
y [k − y]
k
11

(16)

12

13

14

15

and easily obtain the skewed logistic therefore.
5.4.2

Size role

Another interesting way, for further discussion, is to rewrite the evolution equation, letting the time t in the right hand side be an implicit variable, thus
referring to the evolution through the size itself, i. e. let
dy
= V (y),
dt

(17)

where V (y) = ry(1 − y) in Verhulst model. Imposing the stability condition
dV (y)
= V (y) = 0, one easily finds out that the r.h.s. is like
dt
V (y) = a y + b y 2 + c y 3 + ....,

(18)

i.e. there is no zero order term. In other words, keeping the cubic term only,
leads to
dy
= ay(y − yb )(y − yc ) ,
dt

(19)

therefore simply generalising the Verhulst equation leading to the logistic map,
thereby introducing two inflexion points at yb and yc .

5.5

Second order derivative

Without going into elementary considerations for mathematicians and physicists
about the conditions on a differential equation to produce, as its solution, a curve
with an extremum, it is immediately obvious, in the present framework that to
differentiate once more Eq.(4) and Eq.(9) will produce a maximum, because of
the introduction of a second inflexion point; - see Fig. 1 (rhs). However, the
goal is to find a f irst order differential equation (ODE) not a second ODE. As
hinted here above, a time or size dependence of r and/or k (∼ M ) seems the
simplest way.

6
6.1

Growth rate role
Growth rate role in Verhulst model

One may rewrite Verhulst equation, Eq.(3), explicitly expressing the time dependence on the right hand side, i.e.
dx
re−rt
r
=

dt
(1 + e−rt )2
2(1 + cosh(rt))

(20)

In order to have a curve with an extremum the most simple way seems to
consider its derivative; the extremum being located at the inflexion point of the
16

logistic map. One finds
dx
d2 x
= r [1 − 2x]
= r2 x (1 − x) (1 − 2x),
2
dt

(21)

or emphasizing the time dependence on the right hand side, i.e. explicitly
writing
r2 ert (1 − ert )
d2 x

(22)
2
dt
(1 + ert )3
One can also rewrite the above as


rt
d2 x
21 − e
=
r
x (1 − x) ≡ RV x (1 − x)
dt2
1 + ert

(23)

in order to reproduce the r.h.s. of Verhulst equation, but with a new r,
called RV having a specific time dependence, i.e. as


1 − ert
RV = r 2
= −r2 tanh(rt) ,
(24)
1 + ert
- which is not a birth-death growth rate of any known population, up to now. In
so doing one obtains the ”generalized” time-Verhulst equation, admitting that
the growth rate should be time dependent.
Considering a writing in terms of a size dependent r, one can write
d dx

d2 x

which has the Verhulst form

r (1 − 2x)
RV /r
=
1 − r x (1 − x)
1 − rx(1 − x)

(26)

where ρV is expressed in terms of the population size. If one wishes ρV to be
expressed in terms of the time t, one should replace u (≡ x) and RV by their
expression found in Eq.(4) and Eq.(24) respectively; e. g., RV = r2 (1 − 2x(t)).

6.2

Growth rate role in Gompertz model

Similar manipulations and algebra can be performed for the basic Gompertz
model, i.e.,
  

which has the Gompertz form, one has to introduce ρG with

RG /r
log [k/x] − 1
=r
log [k/x] − log [r log(k/x)]
log [k/x] − log [r log(k/x)]

(30)

where ρG is expressed in terms of the population size. If one wishes ρG to be
expressed in terms of the time t, one should replace RG and (dx/dt) by their
expression given in Eq.(28) and Eq.(9). It seems that such a writing is out of
necessity here.

7

Carrying capacity role

Beside the possibility of expressing the growth rate in terms of some time or
size dependence, let us recall that k and M in Gompertz and Verhulst model
respectively are considered to be constant. To remove such a restriction has
already been considered in works referenced to here above. However such a
consideration is of highly relevant modern interest in our growing world, and
thereby requests some attention.
Notice that some population growing in a limited environment can approach
the ultimate carrying capacity of that environment in several possible ways:
(i) it can adjust smoothly to an equilibrium, (ii) it can overshoot the limit
and then dies back again either in a smooth very damped way or (iii) in an
oscillatory, more or less damped, way. Let it be emphasised that the population
can overshoot the carrying capacity and in the process decreases the ultimate
carrying capacity by consuming some necessary nonrenewable resource: e.g.,
deer or goats, when natural enemies are absent, often overgraze their range and
cause erosion or destruction of the vegetation [31]

7.1

World model

Related considerations on the carrying capacity are used in Meadows et al. [30]
on the ”standard” world model. At first it assumes no major change in the
physical, economic, or social relationships that have historically governed the
development of the world system. Food, industrial output, and population grow
exponentially, as according to Malthus [2], until the rapidly diminishing resource
base forces a slowdown in industrial growth. Population growth is finally halted
by a rise in the death rate due to decreased food and medical services. However,
because of natural delays in the system, the population (and pollution) continues
to increase for some time after the peak of industrialisation.
Developments of the world model have considered the doubling or resources
[30], - together with plenty of other interfering causes, for describing the population evolution.

Carrying capacity role in Verhulst and in Gompertz
model

The time and/or size dependence of the so called carrying capacity could be
considered in the same spirit as the growth rate. However this is less trivial
and apparently can only be tackled through numerical work. Indeed, one can
only easily separate the variables when one has either a form k(x), or k(t), in
Gompertz model, or M (N ), or M (t), in Verhulst model, in Eq.(10) and Eq.(15)
respectively, i.e.


k(x(t))
dx
= r x(t) log
(31)
dt
x(t)
dN
r
=
N (t) [M (N (t)) − N (t)] ,
dt
M (N (t))

(32)

However to go on, some analytic form for k and M is needed. This is leading to
more elaborate, less universal, algebraic work, and is outside our present report.
Nevertheless in order to substantiate the role of the carrying capacity time
dependence effect in the Verhulst and in Gompertz model, a posteriori analytic
cases have been considered. A few results are shown in Fig. 7 when a time
dependent behaviour is a posteriori included as a mere factor into the original
Verhulst of Gompertz laws, r being kept constant. For completeness, the used
equations in Fig. 7 read

Bumps or dips are markedly seen, within overall growth or decay features,
even in this simple manipulation. A size dependent effect of the carrying capacity either in the Verhulst or Gompertz approach has not been studied.

Conclusion

A goal has been to describe some simple way toward one single simple first order differential dynamics equation, recalling that 3-parameter families of curves
often describe growth data adequately, like in Verhulst or Gompertz approach.
It has been stressed that extensions of the corresponding equations in order to
introduce extrema, or more than one inflexion point, are easily found in the
second order derivative. However a change of variables is necessary, implying that the growth rate or/and the carrying capacity becomes time (or size)
dependent. This corresponds in practice at considering exogenous or/and endogenous causes, in other words, external or internal field interactions with the
population, i.e. intra-community interactions in the latter case.
Bass model [38] and Zwanzig model [39] already contain such extrema in
an ad hoc way within Verhulst population growth framework. Here it has been
20

aimed at providing a single diffusion Riccati equation with time/size dependent
coefficients of realistic nature, enforcing that the corresponding first ODE is of
the Gompertz or Verhulst type. An analytic form for the growth rate coefficients has been derived. The carrying capacity form seems not so immediately
tractable and demands more numerical work.
Other ways of interest to describe a population evolution are those taking
into account some time delay, as in the world model, and in work on anticipation
by Dubois [41] or Rosen [42]. Indeed, in biological and sociological terms, the
logistic and Gompertz equations present a logical absurdity, since it requires
that cause and effect occur quasi simultaneously.
In fine, let it be pointed out that considerations of discrete time effects do
not seem to have been studied on Gompertz model, in contrast to the Verhulst
case [43]: that might be of interest in the framework of CASYS conference
reports on chaotic, anticipatory or not, systems.
Acknowledgements
Thanks go to Daniel. M. Dubois for inviting me to CASYS 2011, in some
sense challenging me to write down coherently considerations which were not
anticipated, but hidden for long time in likely a few loosely connected neurones,
... and, as I discovered on the way, in apparently old if not obscure references,
for a physicist, sometimes. Some support by the COST Action MP0801 has
allowed fruitful interactions, on the matter presented here above, with numerous
colleagues; thanks to them as well.
Appendix A. Multiparameter extensions
For completeness, it seems appropriate to recall generalisations of Verhulst
and Gompertz laws, beside the so called skewed laws, mentioned in the main
text. E.g., one can write indeed
G1 (t) = e−ρ e

−t/σ

−t/σ −θ

V1 (t) = (1 + ρ e

)

,

(35)
(36)

where ρ, σ, and θ are to be positive numbers, - the logistic map corresponding
to θ=1.
Ahuja and Nash [37] have further generalised these distributions by introducing an additional parameter φ > 0. The density functions of these distributions
are respectively


1  −t/σ φ −ρ e−t/σ
ρe
e
(37)
G2 (t; ρ, σ, φ) =
σΓ(φ)



φ
1
V2 (t; ρ, σ, θ, φ) =
ρ e−t/σ
(1 + ρ e−t/σ )−(θ+φ) .
(38)
σB(φ, θ)
However, it seems that there is no physical justification of these parameters to
be usefully discussed within the present context.
