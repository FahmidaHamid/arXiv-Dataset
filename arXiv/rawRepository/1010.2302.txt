Twisting DNA under a constant applied force reveals a thermally activated transition into a state
with a supercoiled structure known as a plectoneme. Using transition state theory, we predict the
rate of this plectoneme nucleation to be of order 104 Hz. We reconcile this with experiments that
have measured hopping rates of order 10 Hz by noting that the viscous drag on the bead used to
manipulate the DNA limits the measured rate. We find that the intrinsic bending caused by disorder
in the base-pair sequence is important for understanding the free energy barrier that governs the
transition. Both analytic and numerical methods are used in the calculations. We provide extensive
details on the numerical methods for simulating the elastic rod model with and without disorder.

INTRODUCTION

When overtwisted, DNA forms supercoiled structures
known as plectonemes (as seen in the lower right of
Fig. 1), familiar from phone cords and water hoses. Single molecule experiments commonly hold a molecule of
DNA under constant tension and twist one end; the appearance of a growing plectoneme can be thought of as
the nucleation of a new phase that can store some of the
added twists as writhe. Recent experiments that hold
DNA near this supercoiling transition have shown that it
is not initiated by a linear instability (as it is in macroscopic objects), but is rather an equilibrium transition
between two metastable states, with and without a plectoneme. These states are separated by a free energy barrier that is low enough to allow thermal fluctuations to
populate the two states, but high enough that the characteristic rate of hopping is only about 10 Hz. Two experimental groups, using different methods to manipulate
the DNA (one, an optical trap [1]; the other, magnetic
tweezers [2]), have observed this nucleation at the transition and reported similar qualitative and quantitative
results.
Understanding the rate of plectoneme nucleation at the
supercoiling transition is a useful goal for both biology
and physics. First, the biological function of DNA is
tied to its microscopic physical characteristics, and plectoneme nucleation is sensitive to many of these. The
microscopic dynamics of DNA in water is one such factor: while often theorized as a cylindrical rod in a viscous
liquid, these dynamics have not been well studied experimentally. The nucleation rate is also sensitive to the
intrinsic bend disorder present in a given DNA sequence,
potentially providing information to clarify the degree
of bend disorder, which is debated in current literature
[3–6]. Popular elastic rod models for DNA can also be
tested. Second, DNA supercoiling provides to physics a
unique testing ground for theories of thermal nucleation.
The theory of thermal nucleation in spatially extended
systems (critical droplet theory) was essentially proposed
in its current form by Langer in the 1960’s [7, 8] (see
Hänggi [9, section IV.F], and also Coleman [10] for the
corresponding ‘instanton’ quantum tunneling analogue.)

Experimental validation of these theories has been difficult in bulk systems, however, for reasons that DNA nucleation neatly bypasses. (a) The nucleation rate in most
systems is partly determined by the atomic-scale surface
tension; in DNA the continuum theory describes the entire nucleation process. (b) Nucleation in bulk phases
is rare (one event per macroscopic region per quench),
and hence typically has a high energy barrier. Small estimation errors for this barrier height typically hinder
quantitative verification of the (theoretically interesting)
prefactor. In single-molecule DNA experiments, the plectoneme nucleation barrier is only a few kT , and indeed
rather short segments of DNA exhibit multiple hops over
the barrier — allowing direct measurements of the transition rate in equilibrium. (c) Nucleation in bulk phases
is normally dominated by disorder (raindrops nucleate
on dust and salt particles); in DNA the likely dominant
source of disorder (sequence-dependence) is under the experimentalist’s control.
As an illustrative example, consider the classic early
study of supercurrent decay in thin wires [11, 12]. Here
(a) the superconductor (like DNA) is well described by
a continuum theory (Ginzburg-Landau theory) because
the coherence length is large compared to the atomic
scale, but (c) the rate for a real, inhomogeneous wire
will strongly depend on, for example, local width fluctuations. Finally, (b) the rate of nucleation is so strongly
dependent on experimental conditions that an early calculation [11] had an error in the prefactor of a factor
of 1010 [12], but nonetheless still provided an acceptable
agreement with experiment.
Reaction-rate theory predicts a rate of plectoneme nucleation related to the energy barrier between the two
states. We perform a full calculation of this energy barrier and of the rate prefactor, including hydrodynamics,
entropic factors, and sequence-dependent intrinsic bend
disorder, to determine which effects contribute to this
slow rate. We calculate a rate of order 104 Hz, about
1000 times faster than measured experimentally. The discrepancy can be attributed to a slow timescale governing
the dynamics of the measurement apparatus. The experiments measure the extension by monitoring the position
of a large bead connected to one end of the DNA, and its

Saddle point energetics

To understand the dynamics of nucleation, we must
first find the saddle point DNA configuration that serves
as the barrier between the stretched state and the plectonemic state. We model the DNA as an inextensible

dynamics are much slower than that of the DNA strand
— thus the bead hopping rate that the experiments measure is much slower than the plectoneme nucleation hopping rate that we calculate. Future experiments may be
able to slow the plectoneme nucleation rate enough that
the bead dynamics is unimportant, such that the bead
motion would reveal the dynamic characteristics of the
DNA itself.
We begin in section II with the nucleation rate calculation in the absence of disorder: II A gives the saddlepoint energy, II B gives the technique for calculating the
prefactor, II C overviews the dynamics of DNA in water,
and II D gives the transition-state theory calculation in
full. Section III presents the results of the undisordered
calculation, with qualitative explanations of the magnitudes of the various terms, and shows that the results are
incompatible with the experiments. This motivates our
discussion of base-pair disorder in section IV, where we
estimate the disorder-renormalization of the elastic constants in section IV B, and formulate and calculate the
rates in sections IV C and IV D. We conclude in section V.
We draw the reader’s attention in particular to the appendices, where substantive, general-purpose results are
presented for numerical discretization and calculations
with the elastic rod model. Appendix B reformulates
the Euler-angle description in terms of more geometrically natural rotation matrices. Appendix C explains
how to transform a DNA with N segments from the 3N dimensional Euler-angle or rotation-matrix space to the
4N -dimensional (x, y, z, φ) space of the natural dynamics, and the Jacobians needed to transform path integrals
over the latter into path integrals over the former. Appendix D discusses the discretization and the rotationinvariant forms for bend and twist in terms of rotation
matrices. Finally, Appendix E provides our numerical
implementation of randomly-bent DNA, mimicking the
effects of a random base-pair sequence.

where s is arclength along the rod, β and Γ are the local bend and twist deformation angles, respectively, and
L is the contour length of the rod (for more details, see
Appendix A; the dynamical equations of motion will be
discussed in section II C). Fain and coworkers used variational techniques to characterize the extrema of this elastic energy functional [27]; this revealed a “soliton-like
excitation” as the lowest-energy solution with nonzero
writhe [13]. They found that the soliton’s energy differed from that of the straight state by a finite amount
in the infinite-length limit. This soliton state, depicted
at the top of the barrier in Fig. 1, is the one we identify
as the saddle configuration.
The shape of the saddle configuration is controlled by
the bend and twist elastic constants B and C, as well as
the torque τ and force F applied as boundary conditions.

Inserting the experimental values listed in Table I into
Eq. (8), we calculate an energy barrier
∆E = 5.5 kT.

This barrier would seem surprisingly small considering
that typical atomic rates are on the order of 1013 Hz:
using this for the attempt frequency in an activated rate
would give 1013 e−5.5 = 1011 Hz for the hopping rate. The
next sections present a more careful calculation, which
shows that the timescale for motion over the barrier is
in fact many orders of magnitude smaller than 1013 Hz
due to the larger length scales involved (and even smaller
when we calculate the bead hopping rate), but also that
the entropy from multiple available nucleation sites significantly lowers the barrier.
B.

Transition state theory: the basic idea

When, as in our case, the energy barrier is much larger
than the thermal energy kT , the rate of nucleation is suppressed by the Arrhenius factor exp (−∆E/kT ). Going
beyond this temperature dependence to an estimate of
the full rate, however, requires a more detailed calculation. We will follow the prescription from Kramers’
spatial-diffusion-limited reaction-rate theory [9] to calculate the rate of hopping. The requirements are that
(1) the timescales involved in motion within the two
metastable wells are much faster than the timescale
of hopping, and (2) (for Kramers’ “spatial-diffusionlimited” theory) the system is overdamped, in the sense
that the ratio of damping strength to the rate of undamped motion over the barrier top is large. We check
that these requirements are met for the intrinsic DNA
nucleation rate after the calculation in section II D.

Under these two conditions, Kramers’ reaction-rate
theory tells us that the rate of hopping over the barrier is
controlled only by the rate of motion through the “narrow pass” at the top of the barrier, since it is much slower
than any other timescale in the system. This means that
the hopping rate should be the characteristic rate of motion across the barrier top times the probability of finding
the system near the barrier top, which, in terms of the
curvature in the unstable direction away from the saddle
point, we can write schematically as
khopping = (Characteristic rate of motion at barrier top)
× (Prob. of being at top)

It is important to note that, in current experiments,
the measuring apparatus violates condition (1) above.
The measurement of the extension is only an indirect
readout of the configurational state of the DNA — it is
a measure of the position of a large bead connected to
one end of the DNA strand. If the bead has much slower
dynamics than the DNA, then it will set the characteristic rate of motion in Eq. (10). In section III D, we will
find that this is the case for the experimental numbers
we use. Therefore, the rate we will calculate is a plectoneme nucleation hopping rate that is not the same as
the (slower) bead hopping rate. We will find also that future experiments may be able to measure the underlying
plectoneme nucleation hopping rate by testing regimes
where the bead hopping rate is not limited by the bead
dynamics.
C.

Dynamics of DNA in water: the diffusion tensor

To find the rate of motion over the barrier top, we need
to know the microscopic dynamics. We will be treating the DNA strand as a series of cylindrical segments,
parametrized by the Cartesian coordinates (xn , yn , zn )
of one end of each segment plus the Euler angle ψn
that controls local twist (see section C 1 for a discussion about the choice of coordinates). Assuming overdamped motion such that we can neglect inertial terms,
we will write the equations of motion in the form [with
~rn = (xn , yn , zn , ψn ), i, j labeling coordinates, and m, n
labeling segments] [9]

ing the transition [33]. We take this into account by
setting the translational diffusion constant for the final
segment in the chain according to Stokes’ Law:
for i, j ∈ {x, y, z}.

(16)

Hydrodynamic effects may also be important, which
introduce interactions between segments: as segments
move, they change the velocity of the water around them,
and this change propagates to change the viscous force
felt by other nearby segments. Following Ref. [16], we incorporate hydrodynamic effects by using a Rotne-Prager
tensor for the translational diffusion, modeling the strand
as a string of beads [34]:

Transition state theory: full calculation

In the full multidimensional space inhabited by our model, the saddle configuration will have a single unstable
direction that locally defines the “reaction coordinate” depicted in Fig. 1. The direction of the unstable mode can be
found numerically by locally solving the equations of motion Eq. (12). First, the local quadratic approximation to
the energy is provided by the Hessian

5
Hmi,nj =

drmi drnj

(18)

where the derivatives are taken with respect to the unitless variables ~r = x/`0 , y/`0 , z/`0 , ψ (where `0 is an arbitrary length scale [35]; see also section C 1). Inserting
the quadratic form defined by H at the saddle point into
Eq. (12), we then diagonalize the matrix M Hsaddle to
find the dynamical normal modes of the system; the single mode u with a negative eigenvalue −λb is the unstable
mode at the top of the barrier:
saddle
Mli,mj Hmj,nk
unk = −λb uli ,

(19)

and λb defines the characteristic rate of Eq. (11). We
have checked that we find the correct saddle configuration and unstable mode u by perturbing forward and
backward along u and numerically integrating the dynamics of Eq. (12) — one case ends in the straight state
well and the other in the plectonemic state well. This
generates the transition path connecting the two wells,
as illustrated in Fig. 2.
To find the probability of being near the top of the barrier in the multidimensional case, we need to know not
only the energy barrier ∆E, but also the entropic factors

coming from the amount of narrowing in directions transverse to the transition path [36], which are controlled
by the remaining eigenvalues of Hsaddle and the Hessian

and det0 represents the determinant without the two

with respect to ss and ρs : Js = |[J T (~rs )]−1 d~
αs /dss | and
Jρ = |[J T (~rs )]−1 d~
αs /dρs |, where J is defined in Eq. (C5).
We can now check that we meet the requirements for
using Kramers’ theory set out in section II B. First, we
check condition (1) by looking at the smallest nonnegative eigenvalues of M H. The slowest mode is transverse motion with wavelength 2L, and since the bead
has much larger viscous drag than the rest of the DNA
chain, it sets the damping for this motion; this produces
a frequency F/(6πηRL) ≈ 600 Hz. The other modes all
have frequencies of order 104 Hz or faster. We will find
that the calculated Kramers rate of hopping lies between
these two timescales — this means that, while the bead
motion is too slow to follow the fast hopping, Kramers’
theory should correctly give the plectoneme nucleation
hopping rate for a fixed bead position. We can check

(22)

(2) by comparing the characteristic rate for undamped
barrier motion to the characteristic damping rate. In the
spirit of section III B, we are dealing with a portion of
DNA of length `B , such that it has a mass µ`B , where
µ = 3.3 × 10−21 g/nm is the linear mass density of DNA
[17], and the energy curvature at the barrier top is on
the order of π 4 B/`3B . Then the damping coefficient is
−1
ζ/µ = 5 × 1011
barp s , and the rate for undamped
rier motion is (π 4 B/`3B )/(µ`B ) = 4 × 108 s−1 . Since
the ratio of these values is much greater than one, we
are firmly in the overdamped regime, and Kramers’ rate
theory applies [9].

After perturbing the saddle state along the unstable direction u (bottom left and top right snapshots), we integrate

(Black) the final hopping rate per unit length from Eq. (22).
The calculation is performed for the experimental conditions
in Ref. [1], with L = 2.2 kbp (squares) and L = 4.2 kbp (diamonds). On this log scale, adding the three distances from
the horizontal line at 100 in the top plot produces the final
rate. Note that the entropic factor cancels the slowing from
the energy barrier factor. (Here the calculation is performed
without intrinsic bend disorder, producing small or even negative free energy barriers — see section IV.)

For the experimental parameters in Table I, using
Rotne-Prager dynamics [37], we find λb /2π = 4.0 ×
104 Hz, ∆E/kT = 5.5, and S/k = 5.8, such that
∆F/kT = − 0.3. There are two surprises here: (1)
the characteristic rate of motion over the barrier is very
slow compared to typical atomic timescales, and (2) the
entropic factors are so large that they completely erase
the energy barrier. We consider these issues in more detail in the next three sections. We will find that the slow
characteristic rate comes from the larger length scales
involved in the transition, and that entropy wins over
energy due to the length of the DNA. (Roughly speaking, since we calculate a probability per unit length of a
plectoneme critical nucleus, for long enough DNA there
will always be such a nucleus.)
These rate factors and the corresponding rate per unit
length of DNA are plotted as a function of external force
for the two experimentally-measured lengths in Fig. 3
[38]. This rate per unit length itself depends on the
length because (1) the saddle-state torque τ changes with
L and (2) the twisting component of the unstable mode

Plot of dr = dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ; the peaks show the locations
where the (Cartesian) motion of the DNA is greatest when

about 75 nm — inserting this length scale into Eq. (25) produces a prefactor ∼ 105 Hz.

We see that the prefactor is strongly dependent on the
length scale `B of the bending of DNA in the unstable
mode motion. This length scale should be related to the
length ` ∼ 10 nm, defined in Eq. (4), characterizing the
shape of the saddle configuration. As shown in Fig. 4,
we can check the amount of DNA involved in the unstable mode motion by looking at the unstable mode eigenvector. This reveals that a better estimate for `B is in
fact 75 nm; inserting this into Eq. (25) gives a prefactor
∼ 105 Hz, agreeing with the order of magnitude found in
the full calculation. This simple calculation shows, then,
how the 8 orders of magnitude separating the atomic
scale rates from that of our full DNA calculation arise
from the smaller energy scales and larger length scales
involved.

Order of magnitude estimates of the dynamical
prefactor

Typically, rates for atomic scale systems have prefactors on the order of 1013 Hz. Indeed, inserting typical
atomic length scales (Å) and energy scales (eV) into the
simple rate equation Eq. (11), and using Stokes’ law for
an angstrom sized sphere in water, the energy curvature
is 1 eV/Å2 , and the damping is 6πηra = 10−13 eV s/Å2 ,
producing a dynamical prefactor of 1013 Hz.
Why, then, is our dynamical prefactor of order 104 −
5
10 Hz? It turns out that the relevant length and energy
scales for the DNA supercoiling transition are not atomic.
For the saddle state, we are dealing with length scales on
the order of tens of nanometers (much larger than single
atoms), and energy scales related to the elastic constants
(B/` ≈ 10 pN nm < 0.1 eV).
To arrive at a better estimate, we can approximate

This factor comes from comparing the size of fluctuations in the normal modes of the straight and saddle
states. We expect that most of the modes will be similarly constrained in the two states, except for the two
zero modes that appear in the saddle state. These zero
modes create a family of equivalent saddle points at different locations and rotations along the DNA, each of
which contributes to the final rate. Imagining counting

` ≈ 10 nm, producing ρ0 s0 ∼ 30 nm. And indeed, using
S/k = 5.8 found in the full calculation, Eq. (27) gives
ρ0 s0 = 14 nm [41]. Thus the size of the entropic factor
makes sense: it is large because there are many equivalent
locations along the DNA where the plectoneme can form.

D.

Estimates of the free energy barrier and bead
dynamics

The effective free energy barrier in our calculation is
reduced to near zero. This is due to the entropic factor, which favors the saddle state due to the location
and rotation zero modes [42]. With a free energy barrier this small, though, plectonemes would form spontaneously even at zero temperature, and with no barrier to
nucleation, no bistability would be observed — indeed,
this would violate our original assumptions necessary for
the use of transition state theory itself. However, the
fact that bistability is observed in experiment [1, 2] assures us that the effective free energy barrier is in reality

Two separate experimental groups have directly measured the distribution of extensions observed for many
seconds near the supercoiling transition; one such histogram [1, 18] is shown in the top of Fig. 5, and the
distributions measured by the other group [2] appear remarkably similar. Taking the natural logarithm of this
probability density produces an effective free energy landscape in units of kT , shown in the bottom of Fig. 5.
To compare the free energy barrier apparent from the
extension data to the one from our calculation [defined in
Eq. (23)], there are two subtleties to consider. First, the
measurements with extension near the middle, between
the two peaks, are not guaranteed to correspond to configurations that are traversing the saddle between the
two wells (that is to say, extension is not the true reaction coordinate). Since adding extra probability density
unrelated to the transition near the saddle point would
lower the measured effective free energy barrier, we will
only be able to put a lower bound on the true ∆F. Second, looking at the transition state rate equation for onedimensional dynamics [9],

we see the entropic factor coming from the ratio of energy
curvatures in the saddle and well states [43]. Comparing
this to Eq. (24), we see that the comparable effective free
energy barrier should be corrected by this entropic ratio,
such that
∆F/kT = ∆E/kT −

(29)

where the λs are the curvatures in the well and saddle
states. As shown in the bottom of Fig. 5, we can use
fit parabolas to estimate this entropic correction, finding
0.5 kT . Using the heights of the parabolic fits, we find
that ∆E = 2.5 kT , such that our lower bound on the
effective free energy barrier is about 2 kT .
Finally, we can now check whether the bead dynamics
slow the hopping measured in experiments. The curvature of the parabola at the top of the barrier in Fig. 5
gives λsaddle /2π = 3 × 10−3 pN/nm; this matches with
the energy curvature F/L that controls the bead’s motion in section II D. Thus, as in section II D, the characteristic rate of bead motion is about 600 Hz — using
the lower bound of 2 kT for the free energy barrier then
gives a bead hopping rate of 80 Hz, near the observed
hopping rate. This provides an explanation for the discrepancy between the fast rate we calculate and the slow
measured rate: the experimental rate is limited by the
dynamics of the bead.

INCLUDING INTRINSIC BENDS

DNA with a random basepair sequence is not perfectly
straight, but has intrinsic bends coming from the slightly
different preferred bond angles for each basepair. This
can profoundly affect our calculation by both providing
pinning sites for plectonemes and changing the relevant
effective viscosity.

A.

History of intrinsic bend measurements

Since thermal fluctuations also bend DNA, the degree
of intrinsic bend disorder is difficult to measure, but can
be estimated using specific DNA sequences that are intrinsically nearly straight. The contribution to the bend
persistence length from quenched disorder alone (P ) can
−1
be found using the relation [3] (B/kT )−1 = Peff
=
−1
−1
Pm + P : Pm is found using an intrinsically straight
sequence (such that P −1 = 0) and compared to Peff from
a random sequence.
Using estimates of wedge angles along with sequence
information, Trifonov et al. estimated P = 216 nm [4, 5].
An experiment using cryo-electron microscopy [3] found
Pm ≈ 80 nm and Peff ≈ 45 nm, giving an intrinsic bend
persistence length of P ≈ 130 nm. More recently, a
group using cyclization efficiency measurements found
Pm = 49.5 ± 1 nm and Peff = 48 ± 1 nm, from which
they conclude that P > 1000 nm [6], in striking contrast
with the previous estimates.
We include intrinsic bend disorder in our simulations
by shifting the zero of bending energy for each segment by
a random amount, parameterizing the disorder strength
by D = P −2 (see section E 1 for a detailed description).
We are able to locate the new saddle point including disorder, as illustrated in Fig. 6, using numerical methods
described in section E 3. Due to the disagreement in the
literature about the correct value of P , we treat it as
an adjustable parameter and examine the effects of disorder in a range from P = 1000 nm to P = 130 nm
(D = 0.03 nm−1/2 to D = 0.09 nm−1/2 ).

Renormalization of DNA elastic parameters

It is important to note that the measured elastic constants B and C are effective parameters that have been
renormalized by both thermal fluctuations and intrinsic
bend disorder. Our simulations do not explicitly include
thermal fluctuations, but incorporate them by using the
measured effective elastic constants. When we explicitly include bend disorder, however, we must use microscopic constants Bm and Cm adjusted so they create the
same large-scale (measured) effective constants. Nelson
has characterized the first-order effect of disorder on the
elastic constants [5]; correspondingly, we use microscopic

If the disorder is large enough, plectoneme formation
will be strongly pinned to one or more locations along the
DNA. In this case, the zero modes have vanished, and we
find the total rate by adding the contributions from each
saddle point at each location sj . Using Eq. (20),

can thus avoid special treatment of the translation modes
when the fluctuations in sj are much smaller than the average distance between pinning sites, about 75 nm (see
Fig. 14). Setting ∆sj < 75 nm in Eq. (33) then produces
a lower bound on the disorder strength D (or, equivalently, an upper bound on the intrinsic bend disorder
persistence length P ):
D > 10−3 nm−1/2 , or P < 106 nm.

(34)

The experimental estimates for the disorder persistence
length P are typically much smaller than this bound
(hundreds to thousands of nanometers), so the large disorder limit [Eq. (32)] should be valid for our calculation.
D.

Results with disorder

Fig. 7 displays our results for the hopping rate and effective free energy barrier as a function of the intrinsic
bend disorder strength D, for D in the range corresponding to experimental estimates of the persistence length P .
The hopping rate is calculated using Eq. (22) at zero disorder and Eq. (32) with disorder (in this case summing
over 10 saddle points — see section E 3 for details). The
effective free energy barrier is calculated using Eq. (24)
(using the average λb over the 10 saddle locations). We
see first that the nucleation rate is not significantly altered by the intrinsic disorder, remaining between 104
and 105 Hz (too fast to measure with current experiments). The effective free energy barrier, however, rises
above zero with increasing disorder, making our calculation more physically plausible. Furthermore, note that
only the larger experimental estimate for intrinsic disorder (P = 130 nm; green dashed line) is consistent with
our lower bound on ∆F of 2 kT .
In Fig. 8, we plot the components that contribute to
the rate, defined in Eq. (23): the dynamic factor λb
(green), the entropic factor exp (S/k) (red), and the energetic factor exp (−∆E/kT ) (blue). To explore the variance caused by sequence dependence, we calculate these
factors for five different random intrinsic bend sequences,

in Fig. 8.

perturbation theory; see section E 2). Depending on the
actual degree of disorder, sequence dependence creates a
spread in the hopping rate of around one order of magnitude.
Since the hopping rate is exponentially sensitive to energy scales at the transition, it will also be important
to carefully consider our knowledge of the true elastic
constants B and C. Our values [ B = (43 ± 3 nm)kT
and C = (89 ± 3 nm)kT ] were obtained directly from
the same experimental setup that produced the hopping
data [1], and come from fitting force-extension data to
the worm-like chain model [19]. The uncertainties in parameters correspond to ranges of rate predictions — we
numerically check these ranges by performing the rate
calculation using both the upper and lower limits of the
ranges for the quoted value of the two elastic constants.
We find that changes in the elastic constants mainly affect the rate through the energy barrier ∆E [Eq. (8)],
which is much more sensitive to B than to C. The horizontal bars in Fig. 8 show the results of changing B from
its lower to its upper limit; we see that the uncertainty in

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

To calculate the rate for plectoneme nucleation at the
supercoiling transition, we first use an elastic rod theory to characterize the saddle state corresponding to the
barrier to hopping. Using reaction rate theory, we then
calculate the rate prefactor, including entropic factors
and hydrodynamic effects. We also analyze the effect of
intrinsic bend disorder, which simultaneously lowers the
energy barrier and increases the entropic barrier. We
find that the experimental rate is in fact set by the slow
timescale provided by the bead used to manipulate the
DNA, with an intrinsic plectoneme nucleation hopping
rate about 1000 times faster than the measured bead
hopping rate.
Further insight is gained by studying the factors that
contribute to the plectoneme nucleation rate. First, the
energy barrier is calculated analytically using elastic theory [Eq. (8)]. Second, the rate of motion at the barrier
top can be obtained in the full calculation, and the order
of magnitude (105 Hz) agrees with the expected rate of
motion of a rod in a viscous fluid when inserting the ap-

propriate length and energy scales. Third, the entropic
contribution to the prefactor significantly lowers the free
energy barrier, in a way directly related to the saddle configuration’s translational zero mode. Finally, from the
experimental observations of bistability, we know that
the size of the barrier should be at least 2 kT (Fig. 5).
Exploring possible corrections to the calculation, we
developed a method to include disorder due to the randomness in the basepair sequence. This disorder introduces a random intrinsic bend to the DNA, which we are
able to incorporate by numerically locating the saddle
point configurations. Intrinsic bends do not significantly
change the hopping rate, though they do increase the effective free energy barrier (Fig. 7). Both sequence dependence and uncertainties in the elastic parameters produce
variations in the rate, but they are not large enough to
slow the hopping rate by three orders of magnitude to
the experimental timescale.
We instead attribute the slowness of the hopping to
the large bead used to manipulate the DNA, since the
timescale controlling the bead’s motion (ωb ∼ 5×102 Hz)
is two orders of magnitude slower than the plectoneme
nucleation rate (khopping ∼ 5 × 104 Hz). This separation of timescales means that the bead moves through
an effective free energy potential that is set by all possible DNA configurations at a given bead position [44].
When the bead is near the saddle extension, the energy
barrier is lower between states with and without a plectoneme (see Fig. 9), and the microscopic configuration of
the DNA hops quickly between states with and without
a plectoneme at a rate faster than khopping . But since
experiments measure the bead position, this hopping is
invisible, and we see only the slower hopping of the bead
(of order 10 Hz), which is set by its own viscous drag.
The situation is illustrated in Fig. 10.
If the characteristic rate controlling the bead motion
were instead made faster than the hopping rate, similar experiments could directly measure the plectoneme
nucleation hopping rate. Some modifications would be
relatively easy: we estimate that increasing the external
force F to 5.5 pN (the highest force at which plectonemes
are observed in the current experiments [20]) would decrease khopping by a factor of 3; decreasing the length of
the DNA to 1 kbp would decrease khopping by a factor
of about 2; reducing the bead’s size to 100 nm would
increase ωb by a factor of 2. These modifications would
bring the two rates closer by about one order of magnitude. We do not see an obvious way to overcome the
remaining factor of ten, but leave the challenge open to
experimentalists. If this challenge can be met, future
experiments may be able to directly measure the plectoneme nucleation hopping rate, giving useful information about the microscopic dynamics of DNA in water,
and providing a novel testing ground for transition state
theory.

The physical properties of long DNA molecules have
been found to be well-described by linear elastic theory (often referred to as the “worm-like chain” model,
especially in a statistical mechanics context; see, e.g.,
[21, 22]). In this formulation, the DNA is modeled as a
thin elastic rod, and the energy associated with deforming it from its natural relaxed state is the sum of local
elastic bending, twisting, and stretching energies. The
corresponding elastic constants are sensitive to experimental conditions such as the ionic concentration of the
surroundings; in our experimental setup, the bend and
stretch elastic constants B and S can be measured by fitting force-extension curves, and the (renormalized) twist
elastic constant C can be measured from the slope of the
torque as a function of linking number. These values are
listed in Table I [1]. For the low forces in the current experiment (which are in a biologically-relevant range [1]),
the stretch elasticity can be safely ignored [45]; we thus
treat our DNA as an inextensible elastic rod, with energy
as given in Eq. (1). Furthermore, since all parts of the
DNA stay sufficiently far from touching each other in the
saddle state, we also neglect nonlocal repulsive interactions (which would be required to stabilize plectonemes),
allowing an analytical description of the saddle state [13].

Appendix B: Calculating the energy of a DNA
configuration

In our numerical calculations, we approximate the continuous elastic rod as a discretized chain of segments,
each with fixed length d. The orientation of each segment
is described by the rotations necessary to transform the
global Cartesian axes onto the local axes of the segment.
When minimizing the (free) energy, we find it convenient
to use Euler angles [46] φ, θ, and ψ, since any set of Euler
angles specifies a valid configuration [47]. However, writing the energy in terms of differences of Euler angles can
lead to numerical problems near the singularities at the
poles. When calculating energies and forces, we therefore
instead use the full rotation matrix R. R rotates a segment lying along the z-axis to its final orientation; R’s
columns are thus the two normal unit vectors followed by

13
the tangent unit vector (see Fig. 11):

cos θ cos φ cos ψ − sin φ sin ψ,
− cos ψ sin θ),

(B1)

(B2)

t̂ = ( sin θ sin φ, − cos ψ sin θ, cos θ).

There are three degrees of freedom in the “hinge” between each segment that determine the local elastic energy: the two components of bending β1 and β2 (along
n̂1 and n̂2 , respectively), and the twist Γ. In terms of the
rotation matrix
∆(n) ≡ (R(n) )T R(n+1) ,

(B3)

which measures the rotation between adjacent segments,
mapping the nth segment’s axes onto those of the (n +
1)th, the bends and twist can be written in an explicitly
rotation-invariant form: to lowest order in the angles (see
Section D 2),

First, we note that there is one less coordinate in Euler angle space: this comes from the inextensibility constraint, which ~r space does not have. Thus we add a
coordinate ∆ to the Euler angles specifying the length of
each segment (which will usually be set to a constant d);
we will call this set of coordinates α
~ = (φ, θ, ψ, ∆). Also,
~r has N + 1 elements, each defining the location of one
end of a segment, while α
~ has N elements, each defining
the Euler angles and length of each segment. To match
the number of degrees of freedom, we remove center of
mass motion and set constant orientation boundary conditions by fixing the location of the first segment’s two
ends and fixing the last segment’s orientation along ẑ:
~r(0) = ~0, ~r(1) = d ẑ, ~r(N + 1) = ~r(N ) + d ẑ. This gives a
total of 4(N − 2) degrees of freedom.
The Jacobian we would like to calculate is

Jmi,nj =

(B4)

where the (n) superscripts have been omitted. The above
forms are useful when the sign of a given component is
necessary [48]. Otherwise, the following squared forms
may be used, which have the advantage of a larger range
of validity away from zero (see Section D 2):
β~ 2 = β12 + β22 = 2(1 − ∆33 )

However, the hopping rate calculation requires that we do
our path integral in the same coordinates as the dynamics, given in Section II C, which are defined in Cartesian
space with a local twist [~r = (x, y, z, ψ)]. To efficiently
calculate the correct Hessian, then, we need to convert
energy derivatives to ~r space.

We then take derivatives with respect to Cartesian coordinates to produce the φ, θ, and ∆ rows in the Jacobian.
A subtlety arises in finding expressions for derivatives of
the Euler angle ψ with respect to Cartesian coordinates.
We would like the derivative to correspond to rotating the
adjacent segments to accommodate the change in the location of their connecting ends. Due to the way in which
Euler angles are defined, this rotation does not in general leave ψ unchanged, as one might naively expect. We
therefore obtain the derivatives of ψ by first writing the
rotation matrix corresponding to infinitesimal motion in
Cartesian space and then calculating the corresponding
change in ψ. This produces the nonzero terms in the ψ
row of J1 below.
In the end, we have

So far, we have used Euler angles (φ, θ, ψ) to
parametrize the DNA configuration. We can easily calculate energy derivatives with respect to these coordinates.

Other subtleties

Since derivatives in ~r space will in general couple to ∆
(changing the lengths of segments), we also include an
extra stretching energy:
Estretching =

SX
(∆n − d)2 .
2 n

(C7)

This avoids problems with extra zero modes corresponding to changing ∆. We may choose the stretch elastic
constant S to match DNA (in which case it should be
about 1000 pN [19]); but since S is so large compared
to the other elastic constants, the stretching modes have
much higher energy and are the same for the straight and
saddle configurations, canceling in the rate equation [e.g.
Eq. (21)]. Thus we find that our results are insensitive
to the exact value of S, as expected.
As can be seen by inserting ~t = (0, 0, 1) into Eq. (C6),
there are singularities in the Jacobian when ~t points along
the z-axis. This corresponds to the singularity in the Euler angle representation at the poles (when θ = 0, φ and
ψ are degenerate). This is a problem for our formulation
because our usual boundary conditions hold the ends in
the ẑ direction. As pointed out in Ref. [23], a simple
way to avoid this problem is to rotate the system away
from the singularity (rotating the direction of the force
as well). When performing calculations that require the
Jacobian, we therefore rotate the system about the y-axis
by an angle β and modify the external force term in the
energy from −F cos θ to −F (cos β cos θ+sin β sin θ sin φ).
This more general formulation also permits an explicit
check that our energies and derivatives are rotation invariant.
The Hessian is constructed by taking numerical derivatives of forces, which can be calculated analytically. This
gives the Hessian as a 4(N − 2) × 4(N − 2) matrix, which
is diagonalized to find eigenvalues for the entropic calculation [Eq. (21)]. At zero disorder, the zero modes
must first be removed; numerically, we find that the zero
modes show up conveniently as the two modes with small-

Choosing d

As shown in Fig. 12, we must be careful to choose our
discretization length (the length d of each segment) such
that our energy calculations are sufficiently accurate. We
can check the accuracy of the discretized energy calculation by comparing with the analytical energy barrier in
Eq. (8). Choosing d = 1 nm (about 3 DNA basepairs)
produces energy barriers within 0.2kT of the continuum
limit (corresponding to 20% changes in the hopping rate)
with reasonable memory and time expenditure.

2.

Deriving rotation-invariant forms for bend and
twist

The amount of local bend and twist can be measured
by differences in the rotation matrices of adjacent segments. We would like expressions in terms of the rotation
matrices that are correct to lowest order in the bend or
twist angle and that are explicitly rotation invariant. Our
procedure will be to form rotation invariant terms and,
writing them in terms of Euler angles and their derivatives, check what they measure in terms of bend and
twist.

15
We can first write the bend and twist in terms of
derivatives of the local basis vectors (see Fig. 11) or Euler
angles [13]:

Eq. (D3) and Eq. (D4) produce Eq. (B7) and Eq. (B8).
To find expressions for signed β and Γ, we notice that
the above use only the diagonal elements of ∆; we can
also form rotation invariant terms using the off-diagonal
elements, producing (with the Levi-Civita symbol ε)
β1 = ε1γδ ∆γδ /2 = (∆23 − ∆32 )/2
β2 = ε2γδ ∆γδ /2 = (∆31 − ∆13 )/2
Γ = ε3γδ ∆γδ /2 = (∆12 − ∆21 )/2.

(D5)
(D6)
(D7)

We can see the benefit of using the squared forms
[Eq. (B7) and Eq. (B8)] by checking their dependence on
pure bending or twisting rotations. For example, with
two segments differing only in twist, such that ψ (n+1) =
ψ (n) + α, we find that Eq. (B6) and Eq. (B8) produce,
respectively [49], Γ = sin α and Γ2 = 2(1 − cos α). Plotting Γ2 for the two cases (Fig. 13) demonstrates that they
have the same curvature near α = 0 (by design), but using the non-squared version in Eq. (B6) leads to a second
minimum at α = π: we find that, especially when including intrinsic bend disorder, this can cause the numerical
minimizer to allow ψ to slip by π to the next minimum,
unphysically removing linking number. For this reason,
we use the squared forms unless otherwise necessary.

We then form rotation-invariant terms from rotation
matrices and compare their Taylor series expansions
with respect to bend and twist angles to Eq. (D1) and
Eq. (D2). First checking Tr[(R(n+1) − R(n) )T (R(n+1) −
R(n) )], we find that

Thus hθ(s)2 i = 2 ds σb2 , which when inserted into Eq. (E3)

that multiple plectoneme locations will contribute to the final hopping rate in Eq. (32) (with multiple locations having

numerically using the derivative calculated at two values

First order changes in the energy barrier due to
disorder

How does disorder change the energy of the saddle
point? Since the disorder changes only the bending energy, we can find the lowest order change from the zero

Fig. 14 shows a typical A as a function of s. Fig. 15 compares the first-order approximation to the saddle energy
at the location s∗ , given by DA(s∗ ), to Esaddle calculated
numerically by zeroing forces (see Section E 3). We see
that the approximation correctly predicts the scale of the
change for the disorder sizes in which we are interested,
but overestimates the change by many kT for large disorder. We therefore use the first-order approximation
to find the likely locations of the lowest energy saddle
points [at the peaks of A(s)], and then zero the forces
numerically.
To estimate the typical size of this sensitivity to disorder, we first note that the bend magnitude for the saddle
configuration is [inserting Eqs. (5) into Eq. (D1)]

Inserting B = (43 nm)kT and ` ≈ 10 nm gives a typical

3.

Finding saddle points

(E13)

With large disorder, the saddle points must be found
numerically. We start by estimating the set of saddle locations {s∗ } and rotations {ρ∗ } using first order perturbation theory (Section E 2). We find the local maxima of
A(s) using a one-dimensional local search method starting from a set of points spaced by the saddle configuration
length scale `. This gives {s∗ }, from which {ρ∗ } can be
found using Eq. (E11). For each s∗ and corresponding ρ∗ ,
we create a zero-disorder saddle configuration [Eqs. (5)],
and then use this as the starting point for a multidimensional equation solver (scipy.fsolve) that numerically
locates the saddle with disorder by finding solutions with
zero net force on each segment.

in our numerical calculations — we attribute this to the
effects of discretization. We therefore first minimize the
forces using the same procedure used to find saddle states
with intrinsic bending disorder, described in section E 3.
Note that this is not the same as the torque before or
after the transition.
We could alternatively use Ks∗ = 8.1 from the theory in
Ref. [18], but finding the transition involves the complications of the full plectonemic state, including entropic
repulsion, that are less well-understood than the elastic
properties. Using this alternative Ks∗ increases ∆E by
about 1 kT , which does not significantly alter our conclusions.
What about the barrier from the plectoneme to the saddle point? Since the plectoneme is stabilized by selfrepulsion (electrostatic and entropic), analytic calculations are more difficult. But at forces and torques where
the plectoneme is in coexistence with the straight state,
the total plectoneme free energy is equal to that of the
straight state, and hence the free energy barriers are the
same.
Taking L → ∞, this agrees
√ with Eq. (19) of Ref. [13] if
their F/L is replaced by 2F B.
It is also known that the presence of a surface (the glass
plate to which the DNA is attached) leads to an enhanced
hydrodynamic diffusion on the bead that depends on the
distance z from the surface; for motion perpendicular
to the surface [24], ζeff = ζ[1 + R/z + R/(2R + 6z)].
For our typical z and R, this increases ζ for the bead
by a factor of about 1.6, which does not significantly
change our conclusions, so we choose not to include this
correction.
The Rotne-Prager tensor (also known as the RotnePrager-Yamakawa tensor [25]) is a regularized version of
the Kirkwood-Riseman diffusion tensor (also known as
the Oseen-Burgers tensor [25]) that is modified at short
distances such that it becomes positive definite, producing stable dynamics [26].
Choosing these units for our variables makes the

[36] The rate will be slower if the system must traverse a more
narrow “pass” at the saddle point.
[37] Using M diagonal [Eq. (13)] produces a comparable unstable mode rate of λb /2π = 5.6 × 104 Hz. We use the more
physical M Rotne−Prager [Eq. (17)] here and in all further
calculations.

[38] The fact that the entropy erases the energy barrier means
that we are not really allowed to calculate a rate in transition state theory. We will later find, however, that the
addition of intrinsic bending disorder increases the free
energy barrier to more reasonable values, and that it does
not significantly change the rate. We thus provide the
zero-disorder rate as a function of force as an indication
of the likely force dependence of the final plectoneme nucleation hopping rate.
[39] We predict that, in an infinite system, dψ should die away
with a characteristic length of about 3 × 103 nm, but our
longest system is shorter than this (about 1.4 × 103 nm).
[40] Planck’s constant plays an analogous role in quantum
statistical mechanics. Also, similar quantities L0 and K0
are defined in the supplementary material of Ref. [18].
[41] Although this argument explains the order of magnitude
of the entropic factor, it does not simply explain the force
dependence: we find that ρ0 s0 has a stronger dependence
on F than predicted by the dependence of ` on F .
[42] In the infinite length limit, entropy will always win,
smearing out the transition.
[43] If the wells become much narrower than the barrier, they
are entropically disfavored, and the barrier-crossing rate
increases.
[44] One could imagine explicitly calculating this free energy.
Since this is both complicated and not biologically relevant, we choose not to do so. Note also that the bead’s
free energy potential is different than the one depicted in
Fig. 1.
[45] At the highest force of 3.5 pN and a stretch elastic constant of 1200 pN [19], we expect a strain of 0.3%, corresponding to an energy density of 0.005 pN nm/nm. This
is much smaller than the typical bending and twisting
energy densities.
[46] We use the ‘z-x-z’ convention: ψ rotates about the original z-axis, θ rotates about the original x-axis, and φ
rotates about the new z-axis.
[47] Other parameterizations with more degrees of freedom
(such as rotation matrices or Cartesian coordinates
paired with a local twist) would require constraints to
ensure a valid configuration with no stretching.
[48] We will use this, for example, when we break the symmetry between positive and negative bends with the introduction of intrinsic bend disorder.
[49] These are straightforwardly evaluated by noting that,
