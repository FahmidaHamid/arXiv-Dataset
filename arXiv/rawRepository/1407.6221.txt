Abstract:
Prion is a misfolded protein found in mammals that causes infectious diseases of the nervous
system in humans and animals. Prion diseases are invariably fatal and highly infectious
neurodegenerative diseases that affect a wide variety of mammalian species such as sheep and
goats, cattle, deer, elk and humans etc. Recent studies have shown that rabbits have a low
susceptibility to be infected by prion diseases with respect to other animals including humans.
The present study employs molecular dynamics (MD) means to unravel the mechanism of
rabbit prion proteins (RaPrPC) based on the recently available rabbit NMR structures (of the
wild-type and its two mutants of two surface residues). The electrostatic charge distributions
on the protein surface are the focus when analysing the MD trajectories. It is found that can
conclude that surface electrostatic charge distributions indeed contribute to the structural
stability of wild-type RaPrPC; this may be useful for the medicinal treatment of prion diseases.

Introduction
It has been a challenge to rational whether the contagious Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy (TSE) is caused by prions (Prusiner, 1997 & 1998; Soto & Castilla, 2004;
Soto, 2011; Fernandez-Borges et al., 2012). As a misfolded protein, prion is neither a virus,
nor a bacterium, and nor any microorganism. Prion disease cannot be caused by the vigilance
of the organism immune system but it can freely spread from one species to another species.
Humans TSEs (for example, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD)) can
happen randomly through a number of processes, such as infections of transplanted tissue,
blood transfusions and/or consumption of infected beef products, etc. Many mammals such as
cat, mink, deer, elk, moose, sheep, goat, nyala, oryx, greater kudu and ostrich etc. are also
susceptible to TSEs. However, a small group of other animals such as rabbits, horses and
dogs seem to be little affected by prions (Vorberg, Martin, Eberhard, & Suzette, 2003; Khan
et al., 2010; Polymenidou et al., 2008; Zhang, 2011a; Zhang & Liu, 2011). As a result, it is
important to understand and to identify the specific causes why these animals are unlikely to
be affected by prions, as it will provide insight to prion diseases and help to resolve the prion
diseases issue.
The role of PrPSc infection in animals such as rabbit has been subject to a heated debating.
Although a number of previous studies showed that a few animals such as rabbits exhibit low
susceptibility to be infected by the PrPSc (Vorberg, Martin, Eberhard, & Suzette, 2003; Khan
et al., 2010; Barlow & Rennie, 1976; Fernandez-Funez et al., 2009; Korth et al., 1997;
Courageot et al., 2008; Vilette et al., 2001; Nisbet et al., 2010; Wen et al., 2010a; Wen et al.,
2010b; Zhou et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012), other recent studies do not agree. Rather, recent
studies suggested that (i) the rabbit prion may be produced through saPMCA (serial
automated Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification) in vitro (Chianini et al., 2012;
Fernandez-Borges et al., 2012), and (ii) the rabbit prion is infectious and transmissible
(Chianini et al., 2012). In their most recently studies, Zhang et al (2014) and Vidal et al.
(2013) suggested that rabbits were not challenged directly in vivo by other known prion
strains. In addition, the saPMCA results did not pass the test of the known BSE strain of cattle.
As a result, rabbits can be considered as a prion resistant species.

A limited number of experimental structural data for RaPrPC are available from the Protein
Data Bank (PBD: http://www.rcsb.org/). For example, the structures of RaPrPC obtained from
NMR (Li et al., 2007, with a PBD entry of 2FJ3) and X-ray (Khan et al., 2010, with a PBD
entry of 3O79) measurements. As a result, it is desirable to reveal the properties and specific
mechanisms of the rabbit PrPC (RaPrPC) and the conversion process of PrPC→PrPSc of rabbit
from limited experimental results. Here PrPC is a soluble normal cellular prion protein and
PrPSc is insoluble abnormally folded infectious and diseased prions. The present study will
base on the NMR structure of RaPrPC (and its I214V and S173N mutants: NMR structure
PDB entries 2JOM, 2JOH, respectively) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
techniques. The information from the present MD studies is able to provide valuable insight
for the PrPC→PrPSc conversion. The information will provide useful rational in the design of
novel therapeutic approaches and drugs that stop the conversion and disease propagation.
This paper can capture the clear α-helices→β-sheets conversion of PrPC→PrPSc under pH
environments from neutral to low. Salt bridge (SB) changes of charged residues under these
two environments can lead to this conversion. Thus, electrostatic charges of charged residues
are focused to study in this paper.

In this study, electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces of the proteins are calculated in order to
determine the shape of the proteins, which helps to reveal how the ligands (drugs) dock into
the proteins, the lock and key model in computer-aided drug design (Zhang, 2012). That is,
the ESP surfaces are used as indicators for different inhibitors with substrates or transition
states of the reaction. These bioinformatics results may be useful to understand the
mechanisms and to suggest helpful information in the medicinal treatment of prion diseases.
As a result, the analysis of surface electrostatic charge distributions of MD trajectories

will be presented. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The MD simulation
materials and methods for NMR structures of RaPrPC wild-type and mutants are provided in
next section, followed by the analysis and discussion focusing on the MD trajectory results of
the surface electrostatic charge distributions and their discussions. Finally, concluding
remarks on RaPrP are summarized.

Materials and methods
The materials, e.g., data used in the present study are based on the NMR PDB files of
2FJ3.pdb, 2JOM.pdb, 2JOH.pdb. The MD methods employed are the same as the previous

studies (Zhang et al., 2014; Zhang, 2010). Briefly, all simulations used the ff03 force field of
the AMBER 11 package (Case et al., 2010). The systems were surrounded with a 12 Å layer
of TIP3PBOX water molecules and neutralized by sodium ions using the XLEaP module of
AMBER 9. Then 14 Cl-, 14 Cl-, 13 Cl- and 5909, 4185 and 4729 water molecules were added
in the rabbit prion wild-type, S173N mutant and I214V mutant, respectively for pH < 7. To
remove the unwanted hydrogen bond contacts, the systems of the solvated proteins with their
counter ions were minimized mainly by the steepest descent method and followed by a small
number of conjugate gradient steps on the data. Next, the solvated proteins were heated from
100 K to 450 K step by step in a 3 ns duration (prions are not completely removed even at a
high temperature of 600 C
̊ (Rhee et al., 2009). For prions many experimental works and
molecular dynamics works have done at 500 K (e.g. Sekijima et al., 2003); simulation results
on protein structures and their dynamics of this paper showed that the force field parameters
are suitable to allow simulations at 450K). Three sets of initial velocities denoted as seed1,
seed2 and seed3 are performed in parallel for stability. The thermostat algorithm used is the
Langevin thermostat algorithm in constant NVT ensembles. The SHAKE algorithm (only on
bonds involving hydrogen) and PMEMD (Particle Mesh Ewald Molecular Dynamics)
algorithm with non-bonded cutoff of 12 Å were used during heating. Equilibrations were
reached in constant NPT ensembles under Langevin thermostat for 5 ns. After equilibrations,
production MD phase was carried out at 450 K for 30 ns using constant pressure and
temperature ensemble and the PMEMD algorithm with the same non-bonded cutoff of 12 Å
during simulations. The step size for equilibration was 0.5 fs and 1 fs in the MD production
runs. The structures were saved to file every 1000 steps. The MD simulations are repeated
under neutral pH environment.

In order to obtain the low pH (acidic) environment, the residues HIS, ASP, GLU were
changed into their zwitterion forms of HIP, ASH, GLH, respectively, and Cl- ions were added
by the XLEaP module of the AMBER package. Thus, the SBs of the system (residues HIS,
ASP, GLU) under the neutral pH environment were broken in the low pH environment
(zwitterion forms of HIP, ASH, GLH). At acidic pH, our MD simulations can also capture the
misfolding of prion proteins from RaPrPC α-helices to RaPrPSc β-sheets (Cheng et al., 2014).

Discussion on the MD methods
The pmemd.MPI is faster and scales better in parallel than sander.MPI, but pmemd is less
accurate than sander. The main reason for choosing PMEMD (Salomon-Ferrer et al., 2013) in
our case is that (i) the solvated systems are large, (ii) the MD simulation time are long, and
(iii) the parallel supercomputer resources of VLSCI (http://www.vlsci.org.au).

The use of cutoffs in GB (Generalized Born) simulations as implemented in PMEMD does
not conserve energy, and their use involves an approximation with an unknown effect on
accuracy. For this reason, we chose not to implement van der Waals (vdW) and electrostatic
cutoffs in the GPU version of this code. Cutoffs for the nonbonded interactions are
implemented for explicit solvent simulations with periodic boundary conditions using the
PME method, as described in (Götz et al., 2012). However, cutoffs in calculating the effective
Born radii are supported.
We explain a bit more about PME and the explicit water with counter ions distribution as
described in (Walker R., 2010). In the periodic boundary method the particles being simulated
are enclosed in a box which is then replicated in all three dimensions to give a periodic array.
During the simulation only one of the particles is represented, but the effects are reproduced
over all the image particles with each particle not only interacting with the other particles but
also with their images in neighbouring boxes. Particles that leave one side of the box re-enter
from the opposite side as their image. In this way the total number of particles in the central
box remains constant. The periodic boundary method would appear to be very
computationally intensive. However, by employing the PME method it is possible to obtain
the infinite electrostatics in a way that scales as NlnN time. This involves dividing the
calculation up between a real space component and a reciprocal space component. The use of
PME means we are calculating all of the ‘infinite’ electrostatics and so are not actually
truncating the electrostatics. The VDW interactions are still needed though which means we
cannot make the cut-off too small less than 8 Å for periodic boundary PME calculations. Prior
to MD, we use optimization (first Holding the solute fixed to just minimize the positions of
the water and ions and then minimizing the entire system) to relax the system to remove bad
VDW and electrostatic interactions and the gaps between the solvent and solute and solvent
and box edges, etc. During the equilibration period, we first run short MD at constant volume
and then use periodic boundaries to keep the pressure constant and so allow the volume of the
box to change. This will allow the water and ions to equilibrate around the solute and come to
an equilibrium density. The visual description of colours for charges should be averaged from
residue charge.
We have chosen 450 K, which is high temperature to SB. This means that the Cp is low
enough to keep the initial structure (ΔG<0) at 450K (Chan et al., 2011); but it is not
simulated using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation (Chan et al., 2011) by all versions of the
Amber package (http://ambermd.org/).
We use FirstGlance in Jmol (http://bioinformatics.org/firstglance/fgij/) to detect all the
charges of RaPrPC wild-type, I214V mutant and S173N mutant: 10+ (7 ARG, 3 LYS) (3HIS)
and 13- (5 ASP, 7 GLU, 1 C-terminus), in defining the following SBs that we have calculated:
ASP146-ARG147, GLU210-ARG207, GLU206-LYS203, GLU206-ARG207, ASP146HIS139, GLU151-ARG150, GLU151-ARG147, GLU151-ARG155, ASP177-ARG163,
GLU145-ARG135, ASP143-HIS139, GLU145-HIS139, GLU195-ARG155, ASP146ARG150, ASP177-HIS176, ASP143-ARG147, GLU195-LYS193, HIS186-ARG155,
HIS186-LYS184, ASP166-ARG163, GLU210-HIS176, HIS139-ARG135, GLU199-LYS193,
GLU206-HIS176 (Zhang et al., 2014).
This paper is focusing to study the ESP surface charge distributions. Here in the below we
will specially discuss some excellent dielectrique constant (Chan et al., 2011) and dielectric
constant (Guest et al., 2011) for the calculations of ESP surface charges.

Discussion on dielectrique constant and free energy
The dielectric response for a particular region of the protein is obtained at the
microscopic level by employing a TI/MD (Thermodynamic Integration / Molecular

Dynamics) method; MD simulations and “TI” are used to determine how the protein
responds to charge insertion at a particular site at the atomistic level. In this paper we
presented the external polarisation in terms of charges (positives, neutral, negatives).
This paper uses Maestro 9.7 2014-1 (Academic use only) free package
(http://www.schrodinger.com/) to draw the Poisson-Boltzmann ESP surface charges
of the external polarisation: we choose indi=1.0 as the solute dielectric constant,
exdi=80.0 as the solvent dielectric constant, and 12 Å as the solvent radius, 450 K as
the Temperature, and EPS mapped on molecular surface is chosen. We know that the
delta ΔCp =>ΔGu=f(T) is a good method to show how a molecular structure is more
stable with a SB (Figure S4 of (Chan et al., 2011)); using the delta method on the
2FJ3.pdb file of the rabbit PrP, the distance of ASP177-ARG163 (O ̶ N) gives a SB of
10 Å which is nearly null in terms of energy. But this is just the result of one snapshot
under special conditions; during the whole MD simulations at temperatures such as
300 K, 350 K, 400 K, 450 K, and 500 K the distance of ASP177-ARG163 (O ̶ N) is at
the SB distance during most of the 30 ns’ MD simulation time.
About dielectric constant
In the method using a mesoscopique dielectric constant a nice figure (Figure 4B of
(Guest et al., 2011)) shows the change of ε which gives what is under the coloured
surface. The transparent surfaces shows contours of equal dielectric as determined
from heterogeneous mesoscopique dielectric theory (Guest et al., 2011). SBs into the
core of the protein will show a better energy for stabilization (weak ε, therefore better
ΔGu) than all SBs rather on the external protein. All the charges we are showing as
red and blue are not just on the periphery. SBs are calculated by oppositely-charged
atoms that are within 6.5 Å and are not directly hydrogen-bonded. It should be the
average charge calculated per residue or the specific atom charge of the residue. The
donor residues involved are ASP, GLU, HID and the acceptor residues involved are
LYS, ARG, HID, and the real computed distance is within 6.5 Å in Amber package.
On prion proteins, Guest et al. (2011) declared “Salt bridges known to be absent in
disease causing human mutants of the prion protein were found to be among the
strongest present in the protein, so that the human mutants were electrostatically the
least stable of those proteins studied. Conversely, the prion protein with the most
stable salt bridges belonged to a species known to be resistant to prion disease (frog)”
(Guest et al., 2010 & 2011).

Results and discussion
The MD results from the simulations are summarized in Figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively,
under the parallel conditions of seed1, seed2 and seed3 in the duration of 30 ns. Each figure,
say, Figure 1, it composes of six panels --- three on the left for the system under the neutral
pH condition and three on the right for the systems under the acidic (low pH) solutions. The
variations of the secondary molecular structures of the wild-type (RaPrPC) and its I214V and
S173N mutants are given on the top row, middle row and bottom row, respectively. As a
result, the six panels in Figure 1 can be called as 1N1, 1N2, 1N3, 1L1, 1L2 and 1L3, for the

results under seed1 conditions, in neutral pH environment for RaPrPC, I214V mutant and
S173 mutant for 1N1, 1N2 and 1N3; in low pH environment (acidic) for RaPrPC, I214V
mutant and S173 mutant for 1L1, 1L2 and 1L3. For example, 1L2 is the results for seed1
conditions in low pH solution for I214V mutant. Within each panel, say, 1N1 (the top-left
corner panel), three subpanels named H1, H2 and H3 from bottom to top represents the αhelix 1, α-helix 2 and α-helix 3 of the prion protein, respectively.

Under the convention, coloured codes represent various helices. The information in the
figures was produced using the DSSP program (Kabsch & Sander, 1983). For example, red,
green, yellow, blue, dark blue, purple and orange represent for H, I, G, B, E, T and S,
accordingly. The coloured codes represent various helices. For example, letter H refers to the
α-helix, I refers to the π-helix, G refers to the 3-helix or 3/10 helix, B refers to the residue in
isolated β-bridge, E refers the extended strand (participates in β-ladder), T refers to the
hydrogen bonded turn, and S refers to the bend. The colour coded letters are given in the
figures.

As can be seen from Figures 1-3, the top-left corner panels, i.e, 1N1, 2N1 and 3N1 are
dominated by red colour, indicating that under the neutral pH conditions, the three α-helices
(H1, H2 and H3) of the wild-type prion RaPrPC, remain dominant the α-helices without
significant changes during the period of 30 ns, regardless the seed conditions. For example,
the α-helices (H1, H2 and H3 in red colour) of 1N1 in Figure 1 (top-left panel) does not
experience any apparent colour changes, indicating that under the neutral pH condition, the αhelices of the wild-type prion resist structural changes. This is particular the case in H3 and
H2, although small noticeable changes in H1 has been observed. However, the I214V (second
rows) and S173N (third rows) mutants of the wild-type prion protein show significant
changes indicated by their changes of colour codes. This is also the cases under acidic
condition (i.e., low pH environment) on the right hand side of the figures, which shows
colourful panels---indication very little similarities can be seen in the corresponding bands.
As Figures 1, 2 and 3 are under parallel conditions with similar changes patterns, the
following discussion will focus on Figure 1 under seed1 conditions.

In Figure 1, the 1N1 panel is unique---it is dominant by red, indicating little mutational
changes, whereas all other panels in this figure results in colourful changes. It reveals that the
three α-helices of the wild-type (RaPrPC) prion protein are unfolded and remain in the same
structures under neutral pH conditions. However, in low pH environment, this wild-type prion
protein (1L1) turns into a colourful panel of almost all of the seven colours but large

presentation of orange (hydrogen bonded bend). Therefore, under acidic condition (low pH
environment), the SB network of the wild-type (RaPrPC) is broken thus leads to the unfolding
of the stable α-helical structures of RaPrPC (Zhang et al, 2014). Hence, it suggests that the
structural distributions of the wild-type (RaPrPC) protein depends on the pH. On the other
hand, the I214V and S173N mutants under either neutral or low pH environment, such as
1N2/1L2 and 1N3/1L3, are unfolded into rich β-sheet structures. Generally, we could see the
clear secondary structure changes from (α-, π-, 310-) helix structures to β-sheet (ladder and
bridge) structures from Figures 1~3.

Residue at 214 within the C terminus could potentially influence the conversion of RaPrPC to
RaPrPSc (Vorberg et al., 2003). For residue at 173 in the β2-α2 loop, Wen et al. (2010)
reported a large-continuous-positive-charge-surface ESP, which is unique to the RaPrPC prion
protein (Wen et al, 2010b). In the studies, the solution structures (backbones) of the RaPrPC
protein and its S173N variant are determined for their structured C-terminal domains. It
suggested that the highly ordered β2-α2 loop has been well recognized by the NMR-signals
contribute to the structural stability of RaPrPC (Wen et al., 2010a,b) at one snapshot of 300 K
and 1 ATM condition. In Figure 4, the surface EPS charge distributions are calculated based
on the NMR structure of the RaPrPC wild type.
Figures 5 and 6 show the surface ESP charge distributions of the wild-type RaPrPC protein at
a temperature of 450 K for the neutral pH environment obtained in the present study. Figure 5
gives the snapshots at 5 ns, 10 ns, 15 ns, 20 ns, 25 ns, 30 ns, for the conditions of seed1 (first
row), seed2 (second row) and seed3 (3rd row). In the figure, the charges coloured by red and
blue represent negative and positive respectively. As shown in Figure 5, it is discovered that a
large region of positive charge (blue) distribution has still been reserved during the long MD
simulation of 30 nanoseconds. However, the continuous of the land has not been always
reserved yet (where continuous means connect to each other, not discreted), as indicated by
Figure 6 with rotational views.

charge. Up to down: seed1~seed3. The pb_potential_volumes for seed1 are ±21.3561 (5 ns), ±27.637 (10 ns),
±23.9485 (15 ns), ±28.2425 (20 ns), ±32.4692 (25 ns), ±25.1583 (30 ns), for seed2 are ±26.452 (5 ns), ±19.6673
(10 ns), ±28.1642 (15 ns), ±25.912 (20 ns), ±31.4185 (25 ns), ±29.0557 (30 ns), and for seed3 are ±24.138 (5 ns),
±28.8575 (10 ns), ±26.5422 (15 ns), ±21.7444 (20 ns), ±31.0833 (25 ns), ±28.0295 (30 ns).

seed1~seed3. The pb_potential_volumes for seed1, seed2, seed3 are ±25.8555, ±25.328, ±33.5938 respectively.

The I214V mutation does not change the ESP due to the non-charged feature of the
two amino acids at site 214 (Wen et al., 2010a). Figure 7 shows the surface ESP charge
distributions of the mutation of the wild-type RaPrPC protein at a temperature of 450 K in the
neutral pH environment obtained in the present study. However, it reveals that the

structures of I214V mutant do not unfold from the α-helices (refer to Figures 1~3) in
the 30 ns duration of the MD simulation. This suggests that the ESP may be not the
reason leading to the structure unfolding of the I214V mutant of the RaPrPC protein.
The S173 mutation, however, just lies in the β2-α2 loop. Thus this mutation S173N
leads to the changes of the network of the ESP in this loop, which is indicated in Figure 8
under seed1 and seed2 conditions, which is very different from seed3 conditions in the same
figure. It indicates that the ESP may lead to the structure unfolding of the S173N

mutant of the RaPrPC protein in seed1 and seed2, whereas the ESP may be not the
reason for the structure unfolding of the S173N mutant of the RaPrPC protein. From
Figures 6~8, we may see that the pb_potential_volume for wild-type is less than for mutants.

respectively.

Conclusions
There are still a number of challenges remain in “prion” theory. The present study using the
molecular dynamic simulation strategies has found that surface electrostatic charge

distributions play an important role in the structural stability of RaPrPC but are clearly not
the only reason contributing to the structural stability the RaPrPC protein. This finding only
partially agrees to the conclusion that “large-continuous-positive-charge-surface ESP
contributes to the structural stability of RaPrPC” (especially in the β2-α2 loop region) (Wen et
al., 2010a,b). Further studies to understand the specific mechanism of RaPrPC are still needed.
