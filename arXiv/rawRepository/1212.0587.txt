ABSTRACT
Large scale surveys in mammalian tissue culture cells suggest that the protein expressed at
the median abundance is present at 8,000 - 16,000 molecules per cell and that differences in
mRNA expression between genes explain only 10-40% of the differences in protein levels. We
find, however, that these surveys have significantly underestimated protein abundances and
the relative importance of transcription. Using individual measurements for 61 housekeeping
proteins to rescale whole proteome data from Schwanhausser et al., we find that the median
protein detected is expressed at 170,000 molecules per cell and that our corrected protein
abundance estimates show a higher correlation with mRNA abundances than do the
uncorrected protein data. In addition, we estimated the impact of further errors in mRNA and
protein abundances using direct experimental measurements of these errors. The resulting
analysis suggests that mRNA levels explain at least 56% of the differences in protein
abundance for the 4,212 genes detected by Schwanhausser et al., though because one major
source of error could not be estimated the true percent contribution could be higher. We also
employed a second, independent strategy to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to
protein expression. We show that the variance in translation rates directly measured by
ribosome profiling is only 12% of that inferred by Schwanhausser et al. and that the measured
and inferred translation rates correlate only poorly (R2=0.13). Based on this, our second
strategy suggests that mRNA levels explain ~81% of the variance in protein levels. We also
determined the percent contributions of transcription, RNA degradation, translation and protein
degradation to the variance in protein abundances using both of our strategies. While the
magnitudes of the two estimates vary, they both suggest that transcription plays a more
important role than the earlier studies implied and translation a much smaller role. Finally, the
above estimates only apply to those genes whose mRNA and protein expression was detected.
Based on a detailed analysis by Hebenstreit et al., we estimate that approximately 40% of
genes in a given cell within a population express no mRNA. Since there can be no translation
in the absence of mRNA, we argue that differences in translation rates can play no role in
determining the expression levels for the ~40% of genes that are non-expressed.

INTRODUCTION
The protein products of genes are expressed at very different levels from each other in a
mammalian cell. Thousands of genes are not detectably expressed. Of those that are, their
proteins are present at levels that differ by five orders of magnitude. Cytoplasmic actin, for
example, is expressed at 1.5 x 108 molecules per cell (Kislauskis et al. 1997), whereas some
transcription factors are expressed at only 4 x 103 molecules per cell (Biggin 2011). There are
four major steps that determine differences in protein expression: the rates at which genes are
transcribed, mRNAs are degraded, proteins are translated, and proteins are degraded (Fig. 1).
The combined effect of transcription and mRNA degradation together determines mRNA
abundances (Fig. 1). The joint effect of protein translation and protein degradation controls the
relative differences between mRNA and protein concentrations (Fig. 1).
Transcription has long been regarded as a dominant step and is controlled by sequence
specific transcription factors that differentially interact with cis-regulatory DNA regions. The
rates of the other three steps, however, vary significantly between genes as well (Boisvert et al.
2012; Cambridge et al. 2011; Cheadle et al. 2005; de Sousa Abreu et al. 2009; Eden et al.
2011; Guo et al. 2010; Han et al. 2013; Hentze & Kuhn 1996; Hsieh et al. 2012; Ingolia et al.
2011; Kristensen et al. 2013; Loriaux & Hoffmann 2013; Rabani et al. 2011; Schwanhausser et
al. 2011; Sharova et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2003). MicroRNAs, for example, differentially interact
with mRNAs to alter rates of RNA degradation and protein translation (Ambros 2011; Baek et
al. 2008; Elmen et al. 2008; Gennarino et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2010; Hobert 2008; Krutzfeldt et
al. 2005; Pillai et al. 2007; Rajewsky 2011; Selbach et al. 2008; Subtelny et al. 2014; Xiao et al.
2007).
To quantify the relative importance of each of the four steps, label free mass spectrometry
methods have been developed that measure the absolute number of protein molecules
expressed per cell for thousands of genes (Bantscheff et al. 2012; Beck et al. 2011; Maier et al.
2009; Schwanhausser et al. 2011; Vogel et al. 2010; Vogel & Marcotte 2012). By comparing
these data to mRNA abundance data, the relative importance of transcription and mRNA
degradation versus protein translation and protein degradation can be determined (Maier et al.
2009; Schwanhausser et al. 2011; Vogel & Marcotte 2012) (Fig. 1). By measuring mRNA
degradation and protein degradation rates as well, the rates of transcription and translation can
be additionally inferred indirectly. Using this approach to study mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts,
Schwanhausser et al. concluded that mRNA levels explain ~40% of the variability in protein
levels; that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of

	  
3

	  

	  

translation; that transcription is the second largest determinant; and that the degradation of
mRNAs and proteins play a significant but lesser role (Schwanhausser et al. 2011).
The above work has provided critically important datasets and an initial framework for analysis.
We noticed, however, that Schwanhausser et al.’s protein abundance estimates are mostly
lower than established values for individual proteins in the literature and that statistical methods
to quantitate the impact of experimental error had not been employed. We therefore set out to
explore if we could refine the analysis of these datasets and to compare our results to those of
Schwanhausser et al. and other system wide studies.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A non-linear underestimation of protein abundances
Our starting point was a set of published abundances of 53 mammalian housekeeping proteins,
most of which are based on SILAC mass spectrometry or western blot data (Biggin 2011; Brosi
et al. 1993; Gregory et al. 2002; Hanamura et al. 1998; Kimura et al. 1999; Kislauskis et al.
1997; Princiotta et al. 2003; Wollfe 1998; Wong et al. 2011; Zeiler et al. 2012). On average
these established estimates are 16 fold higher than those from Schwanhausser et al.’s original
label free mass spectrometry data (Dataset S1). Once we brought this discrepancy to the
authors’ attention, they upwardly revised their abundance estimates for all 5,028 detected
proteins and provided western blot or Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry
measurements for eight polypeptides in NIH3T3 cells (see Corrigendum (Schwanhausser et al.
2011)). However, Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole proteome abundance estimates are
still lower than individual measurements for proteins expressed below 106 molecules per cell,
with the lowest abundance proteins showing the largest discrepancy (Fig. 2a; Dataset S1).
Western blot and SILAC mass spectrometry measurements show the same discrepancy versus
the label free whole proteome data (Dataset S1). For example, for proteins expressed below 1
million molecules per cell, the 26 SILAC measurements are a median of 2.95 fold higher than
Schwanhausser et al.’s second estimates, and the 19 western blot measurements are 3.10 fold
higher. This suggests that the discrepancy is not due to error in the individual measurements
as a similar bias in two independent methods is unlikely.
Of the 61 individual measurements of protein abundance available to us, 15 were made in
NIH3T3 cells and 42 were made in HeLa cells. The discrepancy between Schwanhausser et
al.’s second whole proteome abundances and these individual measurements is not due to
differences in expression levels between HeLa and NIH3T3 cells for the following reasons.

	  
4

	  

	  

One, it is unlikely that such a difference would only occur for lower abundance proteins. Two,
five of the individual measurements for lower abundance proteins (Orc2, Orc4, HDAC3, NFkB1,
and NFkB2) were made in NIH3T3 cells and are on average 3.7 fold higher than the second
whole proteome estimates in this same cell line (Dataset S1). Three, later in the paper we show
that collectively the 61 individual proteins measured have on average the same relationship in
expression values versus all other cellular proteins in both NIH3T3 and HeLa cells. Finally,
Schwanhausser et al.’s second estimates for RNA polymerase II and general transcription
factors such as TFIIB and TFIIE are only 1.6 fold higher than those in yeast (Borggrefe et al.
2001) and are 7.1 times less than those in HeLa cells (Kimura et al. 1999). Yeast cells have
1/40th the volume, 1/200th the amount of DNA and ¼ the number of genes of NIH3T3 and HeLa
cells (Milo et al. 2010). Two fold reductions in the concentrations of a single general
transcription factor have, in some cases, phenotypic consequence (Aoyagi & Wassarman
2001; Deutschbauer et al. 2005; Eissenberg et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2010). Thus, it is unlikely
that a rapidly dividing mammalian cell could function with much larger reductions in the
amounts of all of these essential regulators to levels close to those found in yeast.
Correcting the non-linear bias
Schwanhausser et al. calibrated protein abundances by spiking known amounts of protein
standards into a crude protein extract from NIH3T3 cells and then measuring the abundances
of several thousand proteins in the mixture by label free mass spectrometry. The 20 “spiked in”
protein standards detected in this experiment, however, were present at the equivalent > 8.0 x
105 molecules per cell, a level that represents only the most highly expressed 11% of the
proteins detected (Fig. 3a) (M. Selbach, personal communication (Schwanhausser et al.
2011)). To convert mass spectrometry signals to protein abundances, Schwanhausser et al.
assumed that a linear relationship defined using the 20 “spiked in” standards holds true for
proteins at all abundances (Fig. 3a). The discrepancy between the resulting estimates and
individual protein measurements, however, suggests that this assumption is not valid. We
therefore employed the 61 individual protein measurements from the literature as they span a
much wider abundance range. In a plot of these data vs Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole
proteome estimates, we found that a two-part linear regression gave a statistically better fit
over a single regression (Fig. 3b and c) (p-value=0.002, Materials and Methods). We then used
this two-part regression to derive new abundance estimates for all 5,028 proteins in
Schwanhausser et al.’s dataset (Dataset S1). As Figure 2b shows, the correction removes the
non-linear bias.

	  
5

	  

	  

In our rescaled data, the median abundance protein is present at 170,000 molecules per cell
(Fig. 2b), considerably higher than Schwanhausser et al.’s original estimate of 16,000
molecules per cell and significantly above their second estimate of 50,000 molecules per cell.
For low abundance proteins the effect is larger. In our corrected data, the median sequence
specific transcription factor is present at 71,000 molecules per cell versus Schwanhausser et
al.’s estimates of first 3,500 then 9,300 molecules per cell (Dataset S1). Our correction reduces
the range of detected abundances by ~50 fold (unlogged) compared to Schwanhausser et al.’s
second estimates (Dataset S1) and the variance in protein levels from 0.97 (log10) to 0.36
(log10).
Corrected protein abundances show an increased correlation with mRNA abundances
As an independent check on the accuracy of our corrected abundances, we compared them to
Schwanhausser et al.’s RNA-Seq mRNA expression data. Our corrected protein abundances
correlate more highly with mRNA abundances than do Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole
proteome estimates (compare Fig. 4a and b). The increase in correlation coefficient is highly
significant (p-value<10-29) (Materials and Methods), arguing that our non-linear correction to the
whole proteome abundances has increased the accuracy of these estimates. The most
dramatic change is that the scatter about the line of best fit is reduced and shows a stronger
linear relationship. The 50% prediction band shows that prior to correction the half of proteins
whose abundances are best predicted by mRNA levels are expressed over an 11 fold range
(unlogged), but after correction they are expressed over a narrower, 4 fold range (Fig. 4a and
b). The correction reduces the width of the 95% prediction band even further, by 18 fold.
For our corrected data, the median number of proteins translated per mRNA is 9,800 compared
to Schwanhausser et al.’s original estimate of 900 and their second estimate of 2,800. In yeast,
the ratio of protein molecules translated per mRNA is 4,200 - 5,600 (Ghaemmaghami et al.
2003; Lu et al. 2007). Given that mammalian cells have a higher protein copy number than
yeast (Milo et al. 2010), it is not unreasonable that the ratio in mammalian cells would be the
higher.

Estimating the impact of molecule specific measurement error
In addition to the above general error in scaling protein abundances, there are additional
sources of experimental error that uniquely affect data for each protein and mRNA differently.
As a result of these molecule specific measurement errors, the coefficient of determination
between measured mRNA and measured protein levels—i.e. R2 shown in Fig. 4b—is lower

	  
6

	  

	  

than the actual value between true protein and true mRNA levels. With an accurate estimate of
the errors, it is possible to calculate the increased correlation expected between true protein
and true mRNA abundances. Because the variance in the residuals in Fig. 4b (i.e. the
displacement along the y axis of data points about the line of best fit) is composed of both
experimental error and the genuine differences in the rates of translation and protein
degradation between genes, once the experimental error has been estimated, it is also
possible to infer the combined true effects of translation and protein degradation.
There are two classes of molecule specific experimental error: stochastic and systematic.
Stochastic error, or imprecision, is the variation between replica experiments and is estimated
from this variation. Systematic error, or inaccuracy, is the reproducible under or over estimation
of each data point, and is estimated by comparing the results obtained with the assay being
used to those from gold standard measurements obtained with the most accurate method
available.
Schwanhausser et al. limited their estimation of experimental error to stochastic errors.
Because our correction of the whole proteome abundances reduces the total variance in
measured protein expression levels, we first reestimated the proportion of the variance in the
residuals in Fig. 4b that is due to stochastic measurement error using replica datasets
(Materials and Methods). We find that 7% of this variance results from stochastic protein error
and 0.8% from stochastic mRNA error.
Schwanhausser et al., however, also noted a significant variance between their whole genome
RNA-Seq data and NanoString measurements for 79 genes (R2=0.79 in Fig. S8A in
(Schwanhausser et al. 2011)), though they did not take this into account subsequently. RNASeq is well known to suffer reproducible several fold biases in the number of DNA sequence
reads obtained for different GC content genomic regions (Cheung et al. 2011; Dohm et al.
2008). In contrast, NanoString gives an accurate measure of nucleic acid abundance as
correlation coefficients of R2=0.99 are obtained when NanoString data are compared to known
concentrations of nucleic acid standards (Geiss et al. 2008). Thus, it is reasonable to consider
NanoString as a gold standard that can be used to assess the systematic error in the RNA-seq
data by assuming that the variance between the two methods is due mostly to systematic error
in RNA-seq. Using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the variance in Schwanhausser et al.’s
NanoString/RNA-Seq comparison can be shown to be equivalent to 23.3% of the variation in
the residuals in Fig. 4b, 29 fold larger than the stochastic component of mRNA error (see
Materials and Methods for a discussion of the assumptions used in this analysis).

	  
7

	  

	  

It is also important to assess the systematic error in the whole proteome abundances as label
free mass spectrometry includes such biases (Bantscheff et al. 2012; Kuntumalla et al. 2009;
Lu et al. 2007; Peng et al. 2012). In principle the “spiked in” protein standards in
Schwanhausser et al.’s calibration experiment (i.e. the data in Fig. 3a) should provide gold
standard data. In practice, however, the variance in mass spectrometry estimates for protein
standards present at supposedly the same amounts is too high (i.e. the scatter along the x axis
in Fig. 3a). This variance would contribute 61% to the variance in the residuals in Fig. 4b, yet
the variance of the residuals between the corrected whole proteome estimates and the 61
individual protein measurements (i.e. the scatter along the x axis about the solid red line in Fig.
3b) would contribute only 44%. Since the western blot and SILAC methods used to make the
61 individual protein measurements introduce some experimental error, it seems likely that the
commercial protein standards used by Schwanhausser at al. were not as accurately prepared
at the correct protein concentrations as one would expect. Since no other suitable gold
standard is available, we are thus unable to estimate the systematic protein error, though it is
likely to be less than 44% of variance in the residuals in Fig. 4b.
Taking the stochastic protein error as a minimum estimate of protein error and the variance
from the NanoString/RNA-Seq comparison as an estimate of all RNA errors, it can be shown
that true mRNA levels explain at least 56% of true protein levels, and by extension protein
degradation and translation combined explain no more than 44% (see Materials and Methods).
Estimating the relative importance of transcription, mRNA degradation, translation and
protein degradation
In addition to determining protein and mRNA abundances, Schwanhausser et al. also directly
measured mRNA and protein degradation rates and calculated the percentage that each
contributed to the variance in protein abundances. Using this information, it is possible to
determine the relative importance of transcription, RNA degradation, translation and protein
degradation for different scenarios (Table 1, see Materials and Methods). For the 4,212 genes
whose protein and mRNA expression was detected, our analysis suggests that transcription
explains ~38% of the variance in true protein levels, RNA degradation explains ~18%,
translation ~30%, and protein degradation ~14% (Table 1). Clearly these estimates are
tentative and depend on the particular assumptions we have made. We believe, though, that
they will prove more accurate than Schwanhausser et al.’s suggestion that translation is the
predominant determinant of protein expression and that mRNA levels explain around 40% of
the variability in protein levels (Schwanhausser et al. 2011) (Table 1).

Direct measurements of translation rates support our analysis
Direct measurements of system wide translation rates using ribosome profiling (Guo et al.
2010; Ingolia et al. 2011; Subtelny et al. 2014) provide independent evidence that translation
rates vary less than Schwanhausser et al. suggest. The distributions of the rates of translation
rates measured in mouse embryonic stem cells, mouse neutrophils, mouse NIH3T3 cells and
human HeLa cells are all significantly narrower than Schwanhausser et al. inferred for mouse
NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5a; Table S1). For NIH3T3 cells the translation rates measured by ribosome
profiling for 95% of the genes detected vary only 5.8 fold, but the rates inferred for 95% of
genes by Schwanhausser et al. vary 115 fold (Fig. 5a). Because each of these datasets contain
differing numbers of genes (Table S1), to provide a more direct comparison we took the
intersection of genes detected by Schwanhausser et al. and by ribosome profiling in NIH3T3
cells (Fig. 5b). The variance in measured translation rates for the genes in the intersection is
only 12% of the variance in rates inferred by Schwanhausser et al. for these same genes (Fig.
5b; Table S1).
Having direct measurements of the variance in translation rates opens up a second strategy to
estimate the relative importance of each step in gene expression (Materials and Methods). In
our first strategy—the measured protein error strategy—protein degradation rates and errors in
protein and mRNA abundances were determined from direct experimental data; and the
variance in true protein levels explained by translation was inferred as that part of the variance
in the residuals in Fig. 4b that is not explained by the three experimentally measured terms. In
our second strategy—the measured translation strategy—translation rates, protein degradation
rates and mRNA errors are determined from direct experimental data; and the variance in
measured protein levels explained by protein error is inferred as that part of the variance in the
residuals in Fig. 4a that is not explained by the sum of variances of the three experimentally
measured components (see Materials and Methods). This measured translation strategy is thus
independent of our rescaling of Schwanhausser et al.’s second protein abundance estimates
and of our estimate of stochastic protein measurement error.
According to our second strategy, for NIH3T3 cells the variance in true protein levels is 63% of
the variance in Schwanhausser et al.’s measured protein abundances; mRNA levels contribute
81% to the variance in true protein expression; transcription 71%; RNA degradation 10%;
translation 11%; and protein degradation 8% (Table 1). Despite the significant differences in
the underlying data and assumption used, these results agree broadly with those of our first

	  
9

	  

	  

strategy (Table 1). Both strategies suggest that the variance in Schwanhausser et al.’s second
protein abundance estimates is too high. Both suggest that translation contributes less to
protein levels and that transcription contributes more that Schwanhausser et al. claimed. In
effect, the measured rates of translation provide independent support for our rescaling of
Schwanhausser et al.’s protein abundances and our estimates of stochastic protein error, and
visa versa.
Our second strategy, though, does estimate that mRNA levels and transcription explain a
higher percent of protein expression than the first (Table 1), but this is not entirely unexpected.
In our first strategy, we were not able to take account of systematic, molecule specific errors in
protein abundances because appropriate control measurements were not available. Thus, this
first strategy could well have underestimated error. In contrast, our second strategy estimates
all types of protein abundance errors in a single term and thus has the potential to be the more
accurate if the error in the ribosome profiling and protein degradation data is not too large.
To further explore the relationship between our two strategies, we compared the correlation
between translation rates inferred by Schwanhausser et al. and those measured by ribosome
profiling in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 6). The coefficient of determination is small (R2= 0.13), indicating
that the ribosome profiling data explain only 13% of the variance in Schwanhausser et al.’s
inferred rates. Considered in isolation this result does not establish if the poor correlation is due
to errors in either or both datasets. However, our measured protein error strategy shows that
the variance in true translation rates contributes no more than 19% to the variance in
Schwanhausser et al.’s inferred translation rates, with the remaining 81% of the variance being
due to experimental error (Table 1; 0.19 = (0.34x0.30)/(0.97x0.55)). The close agreement of
this estimate with the actual correlation between measured and inferred translation rates
(R2<=0.19 vs R2= 0.13) suggests that the poor correlation is almost entirely due to error in
Schwanhausser et al.’s inferred rates. In addition, this result provides further evidence that our
two strategies broadly agree, with the measured protein error strategy potentially
underestimating the degree of error in Schwanhausser et al.’s data.
Ribosome profiling has also shown that translation rates change only several fold upon cellular
differentiation and, with the exception of the translation machinery, the change affects all
expressed genes to a similar degree (Ingolia et al. 2011). Other system wide studies, including
a separate analysis by Schwanhausser et al., also suggest that the differential regulation of
translation may be limited to modest changes at a subset of genes (Baek et al. 2008; Hsieh et
al. 2012; Kristensen et al. 2013; Schwanhausser et al. 2011; Selbach et al. 2008). This work

	  
10

	  

	  

seems consistent with our analysis and suggests that translation may be used chiefly to fine
tune protein expression levels.
Estimating the number of non-transcribed genes
Both Schwanhausser et al.’s and all of our analyses presented above consider only those
genes whose protein and mRNA expression was detected. There are many thousands of other
genes, however, which express no mRNA and as a result cannot be translated. To estimate the
proportion of such genes in a typical cell, we made use of a detailed analysis by Hebenstreit et
al, who showed that there is a trimodal distribution of mRNA expression when the data is
derived as an average for a population of cells of a single cell type (Hebenstreit et al. 2012;
Hebenstreit et al. 2011) (Fig. S1). The first mode contains Highly Expressed (HE) genes,
present at one or more molecules per cell; the second mode is comprised of Low Expressed
(LE) genes, which are not expressed in most cells but—as shown by single molecule
fluorescent in situ hybridization—are present at one to several molecules per cell in a small
percent of cells; and the third mode contains genes that are not detectably expressed (NE
genes) and thus, given the assays sensitivity, are present at less than one mRNA molecule per
100 cells. LE genes tend to be closer to HE genes on the chromosome than are NE genes, and
it has been suggested that this proximity may allow escape from repressive chromatin
structures in a few cells, explaining the stochastic bursts of rare transcription observed
(Hebenstreit et al. 2012; Hebenstreit et al. 2011).
To account for variation in the expression of individual genes between cells, which all LE genes
at a minimum must suffer, we assume that the general distribution of mRNA expression levels
does not vary from cell to cell even when the expression of individual genes does. The mRNA
expression of each LE gene was divided into a component representing expression of one
mRNA molecule in some cells and a second component representing the remaining cells that
express no mRNA (Materials and Methods). This yields 8,763 NE and LE gene equivalents that
are not expressed and 12,546 LE and HE gene equivalents that are expressed. For the 8,763
non-expressed gene equivalents, the complete absence of their mRNAs from the cell means
that they are not being translated in these cells. Therefore, there can be no variation in the
rates at which they are translated. Instead, we assume that the absence of transcription is
overwhelmingly the reason why these genes express no protein.

Implication for other system wide studies
Two other system wide estimates of protein abundance in mammalian cells are, like
Schwanhausser et al.’s, lower than ours. These two reports suggest that the median
abundance protein detected is present at 8,000 (Vogel et al. 2010) or 9,700 (Beck et al. 2011)
molecules per cell vs our estimate of 170,000 molecules per cell. Since these lower estimates
provide less than 1/10th of the number of histones needed to cover the diploid genome with
nucleosomes and are lower than published estimates for a wide array of other housekeeping
proteins, it is unlikely that they are accurate.
Another study by Wisniewski et al. provided protein abundance estimates for HeLa cells that
are generally higher than ours and spread over a broader range (Wisniewski et al. 2012) (Fig.
7a). These estimates are 240% higher on average than the set of individual protein
measurements from the literature (Dataset S3, Fig. 7b). Since over 80% of these individual
measurements were made for proteins in HeLa cells, Wisniewski et al.’s estimates must be
incorrectly scaled. Using our two part linear regression strategy, we therefore corrected
Wisniewski et al.’s whole proteome data (Materials and Methods, Fig. S2; Dataset S3), bringing
the average variation between the whole proteome estimates and individual protein
measurements to within 6% of each other (Fig. 7b; Dataset S3). Interestingly, the correction
dramatically increases the similarity between the distributions of protein abundances in HeLa
and NIH3T3 cells for all orthologous proteins (Fig. 7a). This establishes the important point,
mentioned at the beginning of the Results: in aggregate the 60+ housekeeping proteins show a
similar relationship to the expression values of all other cellular proteins in both cell lines, and
thus the discrepancies with the uncorrected whole proteome data are not due to differences in
expression levels in HeLa versus NIH3T3 cells. The correction also increases the correlation
between HeLa cell protein and HeLa mRNA abundances to a statistically significant extent (pvalue, 6 x 10-20) and reduces the 50% and 95% confidence bounds for this relationship by 1.7
fold and 4.6 fold respectively. Wisniewski et al. scaled their protein abundances using the total
cellular protein content and the sum of the mass spectrometry signals for all detected
polypeptides. They assumed that mass spectrometry signals are proportional to protein
abundance. In contrast, our scaling strategy makes no such assumption and instead uses
many individual measurements of housekeeping proteins to estimate a multipart (spline)
function. The increased correlations obtained with individual protein measurements and with
mRNA abundances for two cell lines suggests that our scalings are the more accurate.

	  
12

	  

	  

Other estimates for the contribution of mRNA levels in determining protein expression in
mammals are lower than ours, suggesting that mRNA levels contribute 10%-40% (Maier et al.
2009; Vogel & Marcotte 2012). In comparison, we estimate that mRNA abundance explains
56% - 81% for a set of 4,212 detected proteins. We also have suggested that for the 40% of
genes in a given cell that express no mRNA, translation rates likely play no role in determining
protein expression levels. The other groups’ neither took systematic experimental errors into
account or made use of direct measures of translation rates and generally do not discuss nontranscribed genes. For this reason, we suspect their analyses underestimate the contribution of
transcription.
CONCLUSIONS
Quantitative whole proteome analyses can offer profound insights into the control of gene
expression and provide baseline parameters for much of systems biology. As these important
new technologies continue to be refined, it is critical that the data be correctly scaled, that
experimental errors be measured and accounted for as much as possible, that all genes be
considered, and that direct measurements of each step in gene expression be made. Additional
measurements and controls will be needed to derive a more assured system wide
understanding of protein and mRNA abundances and the relative importance of each of the
four steps in gene expression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Correcting protein abundance
For NIH3T3 cells, all credible individual protein abundance measurements available to us for
housekeeping proteins (a total of 61 proteins, Dataset S1) were log10 transformed along with
the corresponding estimates from Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole proteome dataset.
Model selection of different regressive models by leave-one-out cross-validation was used to fit
the training data (Bickel & Doksum 2001). This showed that a plausible two-part linear
regression with a change point at 106 molecules per cell (line<1x106…slope=0.56,
intercept=2.64; line>1x106…slope=1.06, intercept=-0.41) fit the data far better than by chance
(likelihood ratio test bootstrap p-value=0.002 (Bickel & Doksum 2001); Fig. 3b and c). The
resulting two-part linear model was used to correct all 5,028 protein abundance estimates (Fig.
2b, Dataset S1).

The null hypothesis that the correlation coefficient of the uncorrected Schwanhausser et al.
protein abundance estimates vs mRNA estimates (R1=0.626) is equal to that of our corrected
protein estimates vs mRNA estimates (R2=0.642) was tested. The method for comparing
dependent correlation coefficients (Olkin & Finn 1990) was employed because both
correlations involve the same mRNA-seq data and it is reasonable to assume that the
uncorrected and corrected protein abundance estimates and the mRNA estimates have a
multivariate Gaussian distribution. The resulting two-sided p-value < 10-29 shows that R2 is
significantly larger than R1.
To correct protein abundance estimates for HeLa cells (Wisniewski et al. 2012), the same
strategy used for NIH3T3 cells was used. A two-part linear regression with a change point at
106.8 molecules per cell fit the data far better than by accident (likelihood ratio test bootstrap pvalue=0.001) (Fig. S2). The resulting two-part linear model was used to correct all HeLa cell
protein abundance estimates (Fig. 7; Dataset S3). The correlation of HeLa cell protein
abundance estimates with mRNA abundances was determined using the mean values of
replica HeLa cell RNA-Seq datasets from the ENCODE consortium (Consortium 2011) (GEO
Accession ID "GSM765402"). The hypothesis that our corrected protein abundances correlate
more highly with these HeLa mRNA abundances than the uncorrected estimates was tested as
above, resulting in a two sided p-value of 6 x 10-20.
The contribution of mRNA to protein levels: measured protein error strategy
The variance term in a linear model between measured protein abundance (MP) (response)
and measured mRNA levels (MR) (predictor) is decomposed in a standard way (ANOVA
(Bickel & Doksum 2001)) into three components (Fig. 8). These components of the variance in
the residuals represent mRNA measurement error ( eR ), protein measurement error ( eP ), and
the variance in a linear model between true protein abundance (TP) and true mRNA levels (TR)
that results from the centered genuine differences in the rates of protein degradation and

!

!

translation (PDT). The measured protein abundances considered in this case are our rescaled
estimates.
Statistically, we can write three linear models from Figure 8.

!

TR = bR MR + c R + eR

(1)

TP = bTR + c + PDT

(2)

MP = TP + c P + eP

(3)

where TR, MR, TP, MP are abundance values on a log10 scale; the three sources of variation (

eR , eP and PDT) are assumed to be independent random variables with mean 0; the amount of
protein degradation and translation (PDT) is taken to be independent of true mRNA levels (TR)
on the basis of partial evidence: the variance in the residuals in Figure 4b is similar for different

! !

mRNA abundances; the reversal of the causal relationship between TR and MR in model (1)
assumes that TR and MR have an approximately joint Gaussian distribution; the slope of TP in
model (3) is assumed to be 1 because the ratios between the 61 protein published abundance
measurements and our corrected estimates are close to 1 (Fig. 2b); and finally we note that
implicit in the analysis of variance is the assumption that the various datasets employed can
thought of as originating from a relatively homogeneous superpopulation. Combining (1)-(3),
we write the linear model between measured protein abundance and measured mRNA levels
as

MP = bbR MR + bc R + c + c P + beR + PDT + eP

The contributions of transcription, translation and protein and mRNA degradation:
measured error strategy
To determine the relative contributions of measured RNA degradation (RD) and measured
protein degradation (PD) to the variance in true protein expression (TP), we estimated their
variances, var(RD) and var(PD). We took Schwanhausser et al.’s calculated percentages for
the contribution of RD and PD to explain the variance of their uncorrected mass whole
proteome abundances (Schwanhausser et al. 2011) (6.4% for RD and 4.9% PD, Matthias
Selbach personal communication). Since the variance of the 8,424 uncorrected mass spec
data points from the two replicates is 0.97, we thus calculated var(RD) and var(PD) as 0.062
and 0.048 respectively. The relative contributions of var(RD) and var(PD) to var(TP) (estimated
2
as "ˆ MP
# "ˆ P2 ) was calculated (Table 1). We also determined the contribution of transcription

(var(TXN)) to var(TP) as (var(TR)-var(true RD))/var(TP), where var(TR) was estimated as

(Table 1).

!

The contributions of each step of gene expression to protein levels: measured
translation strategy
We calculated the relative contributions of each of the four steps in gene expression by an
independent, second approach that does not rely either on our rescaling of Schwanhausser et
al.’s protein abundance estimates or on our estimate of stochastic protein errors. Instead, our
second approach infers true protein abundance based on Subtelny et al.’s direct
measurements of translation rates in NIH3T3 cells by ribosome profiling (Subtelny et al. 2014)
and on our estimate of RNA measurement error. The measured protein abundances
considered are thus Schwanhausser et al.’s second estimates, not our rescaling of these
estimates. A central assumption is that since the variance in Subtelny et al.’s measured
translation rates is 12% of the variance in the rates of translation inferred by Schwanhausser et
al., then the contribution of translation to the variance in true protein levels is 12% of the value
provided by Schwanhausser et al.
The variance term in a linear model between measured protein abundance (MP) and measured
mRNA levels (MR) was decomposed as before (Fig. 8) except that the variance in the linear
model between true protein abundance (TP) and true mRNA levels (TR) that results from the
variance in the rates of protein degradation (PD) and protein translation (PT) were considered
separately as cPD and dPT respectively. Similar to our measured error strategy, we can write
three linear models using the same assumptions.

!

TR = bR MR + c R + eR

(1)

TP = bTR + cPD + dPT + f

(2)

MP = TP + c P + eP

(3)

! Thus, we can write the linear model between measured protein abundance (MP) and measured
!

mRNA levels (MR) for the measured translation strategy as

MP = bbR MR + bc R + f + c P + beR + cPD + dPT + e p

genes in the intersected dataset (Fig. 5B; Table S1) by the ratio of the variances for

Schwanhausser et al.’s inferred rates for the 3,633 genes and the 3,126 genes (Table S1).

The number of genes not transcribed in a typical cell within a population.
To estimate the number
! of genes not transcribed in a typical cell within a population, we
employed a deep RNA-Seq dataset that detected polyA+ mRNA for 15,325 protein coding
genes in mouse Th2 cells (Hebenstreit et al. 2011). To place these abundance estimates on
the same scale as those of Schwanhausser et al.’s data the 3,841 mRNAs expressed above 1
RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) in common between the two
datasets were identified. The Th2 cell data were then scaled to have the same median and
variance for these common genes in numbers of mRNA molecules per cell (Fig. S3). Following
Hebenstreit et al., we divided the expressed genes into 11,301 Highly Expressed (HE) genes,
present at one or more mRNA molecule per cell, and 4,024 Low Expressed (LE) genes,
expressed below one molecule per cell. The remaining 5,984 genes whose expression was not
detected were designated Not Expressed (NE) genes. We then divided each LE gene into two:
a fraction of a gene expressed at 1 molecule per cell with a weight w and a fraction of a gene
that is not expressed in any cells with a weight 1-w. The 4,024 LE genes were thus
decomposed into 1,245 gene equivalents expressed at 1 molecules per cell and 2,779 gene
equivalents that are not expressed. Combining these with the 11,301 HE genes and 5,984 NE
genes, we obtained 12,546 HE and LE expressed gene equivalents and 8,763 NE and LE nonexpressed gene equivalents.

Figure Legends
Figure 1: The steps regulating protein expression. The steady state abundances of mRNAs
and proteins are each determined by their relative rates of production (i.e. transcription or
translation) and their rates of degradation.
Figure 2: A non-linear bias in protein abundance estimates and its correction. a, The y
axis shows the ratios of 61 individually derived protein abundance estimates each divided by
the corresponding abundance estimate from Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole proteome
dataset. The x axis shows the abundance estimate from Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole
proteome dataset. The red line indicates the locally weighted line of best fit (Lowess parameter
f=1.0), and the vertical dotted grey lines show the locations of the 1st quartile, median and 3rd
quartile of the abundance distribution of the 5,028 proteins detected in the whole proteome
analysis. b, The same as panel a. except that the whole proteome estimates of
Schwanhausser et al. have been corrected using a two-part linear model and the abundances
from the 61 individual protein measurements, see Fig. 3b.
Figure 3: Calibrating absolute protein abundances. a, The relationship between iBAC mass
spectrometry signal (x axis) and the amounts of the 20 “spiked in” protein standards (y axis)
used by Schwanhausser et al. to calibrate their whole proteome abundances (data kindly
provided by Matthias Selbach, Dataset S2). The line of best fit is shown (red). b, The
relationship between individually derived estimates for 61 housekeeping proteins (y axis) and
Schwanhausser et al.’s second whole proteome estimates (x axis). The two part line of best fit
used to correct the second whole proteome estimates is shown (solid red line) as is the single
linear regression (dashed red line). c, The fit of different regression models for the data in panel
b. The y axis shows the leave-one-out cross validation root mean square error for each model.
The x axis shows the protein abundance used to separate the data for two part linear
regressions. The red curve shows the optimum change point for a two part linear model is at an
abundance of ~106 molecules per cell. The dashed red horizontal line shows the root mean
square error for the single linear regression.

Figure 4: Protein abundance estimates versus mRNA abundances. a, The relationship
between Schwanhausser et al.’s second protein abundance estimates vs mRNA levels for
4,212 genes in NIH3T3 cells. The linear regression of the data is shown in red, the 50%

prediction band by dashed green lines, and the 95% prediction band by dashed blue lines. b,
The relationship between our corrected estimates of protein abundance vs mRNA levels. The
linear regression and prediction bands are labeled as in panel a.
Figure 5: Measured versus inferred translation rates. a. The relative density of ribosomes
per mRNA for each gene directly measured by ribosome profiling (Guo et al. 2010; Ingolia et
al. 2011; Subtelny et al. 2013) (colored lines) compared to the translation rates for each gene
inferred by Schwanhausser et al. (Schwanhausser et al. 2011) (black lines). The distribution of
values from the ribosome profiling experiments was scaled proportionally to have the same
median as that of the Schwanhausser et al. values, and the gene frequencies of the each
distribution was normalized to have the same total. The locations of the 2.5 and 97.5
percentiles of the two distributions for NIH3T3 cells are shown as dashed lines. b. As panel a.
except that the data for all genes in the Schwanhausser et al. dataset are shown in the solid
black line and data for the genes in the intersection of the Schwanhausser et al. and Subtelny
et al.’s datasets are shown in dashed lines. The variances and numbers of genes for each
dataset are given in Table S1.

Figure 6: Correlation between measured versus inferred translation rates. The
relationship between the measured rates of translation determined by Subtelny et al. using
ribosome footprinting vs the inferred rates of translation determined by Schwanhausser et al for
the same set of 3,126 genes in NIH3T3 cells, see Table S1 for further details. The units shown
are those provided in the original datasets. The linear regression is shown.

Figure 7: Comparison of corrected and uncorrected whole proteome abundance
estimates. a. The distributions of protein abundance estimates for 4,680 orthologous proteins
in NIH3T3 cells (black lines) or HeLa cells (red lines). The values from Schwanhausser et al.’s
second estimates and Wisniewski et al.’s estimates are shown as dashed lines. The values for
our corrected abundance estimates are shown as solid lines. b. The ratios of HeLa cell whole
proteome abundance estimates divided by individual measurements from the literature for 66
proteins. Results for the original data from Wisniewski et al. (dashed line) and after these
values have been corrected (solid line) are plotted. The green dashed vertical line indicates a
ratio of 1.

Figure S1: The trimodal distribution of mRNA expression levels in animal cells. The black
curve shows the frequency distribution for 15,325 genes that give detectable polyA+ mRNA
expression in mouse Th2 cells (Hebenstreit et al. 2012; Hebenstreit et al. 2011). The two major
modes detected for these genes are Highly Expressed (HE) genes centered at 10 molecules of
mRNA per cell and Low Expressed (LE) genes centered at 0.1 molecules per cell. The relative
frequency of the remaining 5,984 Not Expressed (NE) genes is represented by the area of the
circle. The grey curve shows the expression frequency distribution in Th2 cells of the 3,841
genes expessed above 1 molecule per cell that are from the set of the 4,212 genes whose
mRNA and protein abundances were detected by Schwanhausser et al. All data has been
scaled as described in the Materials and Methods and Figure S3.

Figure S2. Calibrating absolute protein abundances in HeLa cells. a, The relationship
between individually derived estimates for 66 housekeeping proteins (y axis) and Wisniewski et
al.’s whole proteome estimates from HeLa cells (x axis) (Dataset S3). The two part line of best
fit used to correct the whole proteome estimates is shown (solid red line) as is the single linear
regression (dashed red line). b, The fit of different regression models for the data in panel a.
The y axis shows the leave-one-out cross validation root mean square error for each model.
The x axis shows the protein abundance used to separate the data for two part linear
regressions. The red curve shows the optimum change point for a two part linear model is at an
abundance of ~106.8 molecules per cell. The dashed red horizontal line shows the root mean
square error for the single linear regression.

Figure S3. Scaling Hebenstreit et al.’s mRNA abundances. The distribution of mRNA
abundnaces from three datasets are shown. The 3,841 mRNAs expressed above 1 RPKM in
the Hebenstreit et al. RNA-Seq data that are in common with mRNAs detected by
Schwanhausser et al were identified (dashed red line). These abundances were then scaled to
have the same median and variance as Schwanhausser et al.’s data (solid red line). This
scaling was in addition applied to all other genes in the Hebenstreit et al. data and the resulting
values used in the simulation shown in Figure 6 and in the mRNA expression distribution
shown in Figure S1.

* Replica data is available for all genes used for the NIH3T3 datasets. In these cases, the means of each pair of
measurements was calculated and the variance of these means is given. The data for Schwanhausser et al. is from
Dataset S1. The data for Subtelny et al. is the miR-155 and miR-1 NIH3T3 cell line data from GEO GSE52809. For
other cell lines only a single dataset is available, and thus the variance in the single gene measurements was
determined.
