Abstract: The precise mechanism that causes HIV infection to progress to AIDS is still
unknown. This paper presents a mathematical model which is able to predict the entire
trajectory of the HIV/AIDS dynamics, then a possible explanation for this progression is
examined. A dynamical analysis of this model reveals a set of parameters which may produce
two real equilibria in the model. One equilibrium is stable and represents those individuals who
have been living with HIV for at least 7 to 9 years, and do not develop AIDS. The other one is
unstable and represents those patients who developed AIDS in an average period of 10 years.
However, further work is needed since the proposed model is sensitive to parameter variations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe HIV dynamics since 1990, these present a basic
relation between CD4+T cells, infected CD4+T cells and
virus Nowak [2000], Kirschner [1996], Perelson [1999], Xia
[2007]. These models give a good presentation of the initial
peak infection and the asymptomatic stage. However, they
are not able to describe the transition to the last stage of
the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
To obtain a more widely applicable model, some authors
have tried to introduce other variables, taking into consideration other mechanisms by which HIV causes depletion
of CD4+T cells. Numerous theories have been proposed,
but none can fully explain all events observed to occur
in practice. Recent studies Wang et al. [2000] have shown
that HIV infection promotes apoptosis in resting CD4+T
cells by the homing process. This mechanism was modeled in two compartments by Kirschner et al. [2000], in
this study authors showed that therapeutic approaches
involving inhibition of viral-induced homing and hominginduced apoptosis may prove beneficial for HIV patients.
The role of the thymus in HIV-1 infection was considered
by Kirschner et al. [1998]. The authors found that infection
of the thymus can act as a source of both infectious
virus and infected CD4+T cells. Significant effort has been
developed in understanding the interaction of the immune
system and HIV Campello [1999], Adams et al. [2004].
⋆ This work was supported by Science Foundation of Ireland
07/PI/I1838, and 08/RFP/PHY/1462.

One limitation of these mathematical models is that they
do not reproduce the entire trajectory of HIV/AIDS dynamics. This trajectory consists of the early peak in the viral load; a long asymptomatic period and a final increase in
viral load with a simultaneous collapse in healthy CD4+T
cell count during which AIDS appears.
A number of studies have been conducted to explore
the role of macrophages in HIV infection as long-term
reservoir Oreinstein [2001]. A reservoir is a long-lived cell,
which can have viral replication even after many years
of drug treatment. Using this theory, Conejeros et al.
[2007] proposed a deterministic model which describes
the complete HIV/AIDS trajectory. Simulations results for
that model emphasize the importance of macrophages in
HIV infection and progression to AIDS, but no dynamical
analysis is proposed.
In this paper, we present a simplification of Conejeros et al.
[2007], in order to have the same behavior of HIV/AIDS,
which permits us to understand the transition to AIDS.
The model is discussed and compared with clinical data.

2. MODEL DESCRIPTION
The model proposed in this section is a simplification of
Conejeros et al. [2007], and considers the following populations; T represents the uninfected CD4+T cells, Ti represents the infected CD4+ T cells, M represents uninfected
macrophages, Mi represents the infected macrophages,
and V represents the HIV population.

The mechanisms consider for this model are described by
the next reactions;

thymus, bone marrow, and other cell sources is considered

3. MODEL RESULTS
An infected HIV patient, in general, suffers a fast drop
in healthy CD4+T cell count and at the same time a
rapid increase in virus population. Then, the immune
system responds to the virus by proliferating CD4+T
cells and macrophages, this can be seen just after the dip

data taken from Greenough [2000] and Fauci et al.
[1996]
10 years the patient experience an asymptomatic phase.
On one hand, CD4+T cells experience a slow depletion
but are with sufficient level to maintain most immune
system functions. At the same time the virus population
continues infecting healthy cells, therefore slowly advances
in numbers, see Fig.2. At the end of asymptomatic period,
constitutional symptoms appears when CD4+T cells are

below about 300 mm−3 . The last stage and the most
dangerous for the patient is when CD4+T cells drop below
200 mm−3 and the viral explosion takes place, which is
considered as AIDS. We can see in Fig.1 how the proposed
model is able to represent all the stages of the infection and
matches well clinical data.

Fig.4 shows how macrophages climb over the years slowly
trying to suppress the virus. This fact is consistent with
previous works Conejeros et al. [2007], who suggest that
macrophages may divide and become more aggressive.

Fig. 4. Macrophages and infected macrophages dynamics
Fig. 2. Viral dynamics
Infected CD4+T cell behavior is structurally similar to
the viral dynamics in the first years, see Fig.3. There is an
initial peak of infected CD4+T cells, followed by a small
increment but almost constant during the asymptomatic
stage.

Infected macrophages increase slowly in number during the
asymptomatic period, but when constitutional symptoms
appear infected macrophages increase very rapidly as can
be seen in Fig.4. This is consistent with the work of
Igarashi et al. [2001], who argued that in the early infection
the virus replication rate in macrophages is slower than
replication rate in CD4+T cells, but over the period of
years, the viral replication rate in macrophages is faster
than early stages of infection.

4. AIDS TRANSITION

160

The model proposed by Conejeros et al. [2007] shows the
complete HIV trajectory. However, they do not give a
detailed explanation of the HIV/AIDS transition, since the
model is difficult to analyze. For this reason, we propose
some simplifying assumptions to allow analysis.
Assumption.1 Fast Viral Dynamics
Looking at the differential equations (14) and parameter
values in Table 1, we notice that δ5 >> 1. In this case, the
differential equation for the virus can be approximated by
the next algebraic equation, as noted in Barao et al. [2007].

Fig. 3. Infected CD4+ T cell dynamics
Macrophages play a central role in this model of HIV
infection. They are considered one of the first points of
infection and then infected macrophages are long-lived
virus reservoirs as is noted in Oreinstein [2001]. We may
notice how the model is able to represent these facts.

Assumption.2 Assume Ti is bounded
We note that in the asymptomatic period of infection
(that is, after the initial transient, and before the final
divergence associated with development of AIDS), the concentration of infected CD4+T cells is relatively constant.
This assumption is also proposed in Astolfi et al. [2008].
Therefore the following assumption for infected CD4+T
cells can be considered:
V =

Ti (t) ≈ Ti , ∀t ≥ t0
Then under (15), (16) can be reduced to
V (t) := c1 Mi + VTi

(17)

where VTi = kδ55 Ti and c1 = kδ56 . Note that if T̄i is
selected as an upper bound on Ti , then (17) represents
an upper bound on v(t). Therefore (17) describes the long
asymptomatic period in the viral load dynamic. Using last
assumptions in macrophages and infected macrophages
equations, we have the following system
Ṁ ≈ s2 − c2 M + c3 M Mi

c2 c5 +c3 c4
c3 δ4

M i ≈ c6 M − c7
and c7 = cc53 sδ24 .

The structure of the system (14) can be decomposed in two
feedbacks, see Fig.5; one is a fast negative feedback and the
other is a slow positive feedback. The biological meaning of
this is that feedback 1 is due to a fast CD4+T cell infection
which is greater than the CD4+T cell proliferation. The
feedback 2 is for a slow macrophages infection rate which
is less than macrophage proliferation.

(18)

Ṁi ≈ c4 M + c5 M Mi − δ4 Mi
(19)
where c2 = δ3 − (k3 − k4 )VTi , c3 = (k3 − k4 )c1 , c4 = k4 VTi
and c5 = k4 c1 .
Assumption.3 M and Mi have an affine relation
Note that from (18) and (19), we expect that the bilinear
terms are predominant for large M and Mi , then we may
assume Ṁ ≈ cc35 Ṁi , which are rearranged in the next linear
form;

where c6 =

Equilibrium A represents an uninfected status. Using
numerical values, the uninfected equilibrium is unstable,
which is consistent with previous works Astolfi et al.
[2008]. This could explain why it is difficult to revert
a patient once infected, back to the HIV-free status.
Using parameter set in Table 1, equilibria B and C take
imaginary values since b2 ≤ 4ac, which are not important

for the biological case. This means that there is no stable
point for the patient with this set of parameters, then the
model will progress to AIDS status.

years the transition to AIDS. Furthermore, a change in
the stability from unstable to stable is shown in Fig.7,
that is the immune system would adapt to maintain a
stable status in the patient.

5.1 Number of equilibrium points and parameter spaces
Using the recently developed symbolic real algebraic geometry methods we keep some parameters unfixed and
get the number of equilibrium points for the unfixed parameter space. The method is called the discriminant variety method which was developed in Lazard et al. [2007],
this is implemented in Maple as in-built packages called
“Parametric” and “DV” Liang et al. [2009]. This method
decomposes the parameter space into different cells such
that the number of real roots is the same for any point in
a given cell. We compute 2D parameter spaces below, for
k4 and k5 . In Fig. 6 the colored region shows the part of
the parameter space in the k4 − k5 plane for which there
are two equilibria in the system. All other parameters are
set as in Table 1.
Remark 1. Using a built-in symbolic algebra routine
we confirm that the number of equilibria with biological
meaning and dynamic properties for the proposed model
are equal to those in Conejeros et al. [2007].

5.2 Bifurcation Analysis
Using the proposed model, there is a set of parameters
which may produce real equilibria in B and C. If we solve
for parameter δ5 , the change of stability is given by;

term behavior, bifurcation analysis in Table 2 evidences
an unusually high sensitivity. In particular, small relative
changes in k2 , k3 , k4 , δ1 , δ2 , δ3 , or δ5 give bifurcation to a
qualitatively different behavior.

(26)

Increasing the value of δ5 as in (26), the escape time may
be delayed. This means that infected patients that are
able to rapidly clear the virus could postpone for many

Choosing δ5 as stated in condition (26), there are two real
positive equilibria which are shown in Table 3. One point
is called LTNP (Long Term Non Progressor), because
it shows the characteristic of individuals who have been
living with HIV around 7 to 12 years and have stable

CD4+T counts around 600 cells/mm3 or more. The other
point is called progressor; when CD4+T cell counts fall
below 200 cells/mm3, the patient is said to have AIDS.
We observe in Table 4 that LTNP point is stable and the
progressor point is unstable. The model can represent adequately both phenomena as is presented in clinical studies.
From the bifurcation analysis, it would appear that there
are certain progressor patients who could become LNTP.
However, it is unclear if this property would be preserved
in more complete models, and clinical evidence for this
seems weak.

6. CONCLUSIONS
The proposed model predicts the entire trajectory of the
disease: initial viremia, latency, and the rapid increase
of virus. Using this simplified model can be understood
how HIV works in an infected patient; basically, the virus
inhibits the CD4+T cell population while promotes the
macrophages proliferation which are reservoir for virus
replication. The long reservoir behavior of macrophages in
an infected HIV patient is a possible explanation of why
a patient progress to AIDS, and serve as recommendation
for clinical study. However, we are concerned about the
sensitivity of the model for some parameters, alternative
mechanisms will be considered in future work.
