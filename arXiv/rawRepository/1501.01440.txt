ABSTRACT

Superoxide reductase SOR is a non-heme iron metalloenzyme that detoxifies superoxide
radical in microorganisms. Its active site consists of an unusual non-heme Fe2+ center in a
[His4 Cys1] square pyramidal pentacoordination, with the axial cysteine ligand proposed to be
an essential feature in catalysis. Two NH peptide groups from isoleucine 118 and histidine
119 establish H-bondings with the sulfur ligand (Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR numbering). In
order to investigate the catalytic role of these H-bonds, the isoleucine 118 residue of the SOR
from Desulfoarculus baarsii was mutated into alanine, aspartate or serine residues. Resonance
Raman spectroscopy showed that the mutations specifically induced an increase of the
strength of the Fe3+-S(Cys) and S-Cβ(Cys) bonds as well as a change in conformation of the
cysteinyl side chain, which was associated with the alteration of the NH hydrogen bonding to
the sulfur ligand. The effects of the isoleucine mutations on the reactivity of SOR with O 2●were investigated by pulse radiolysis. These studies showed that the mutations induced a
specific increase of the pKa of the first reaction intermediate, recently proposed to be an Fe2+O2●- species. These data were supported by DFT calculations carried out on three models of
the Fe2+-O2●- intermediate, with one, two or no H-bonds on the sulfur ligand. Our results
demonstrated that the hydrogen bonds between the NH (peptide) and the cysteine ligand
tightly control the rate of protonation of the Fe2+-O2●- reaction intermediate to form an Fe3+OOH species.

INTRODUCTION

Superoxide radical, O2●-, the one-electron reduction product of oxygen, is a side product
of aerobic metabolism [1, 2]. It is considered to be the first reactive oxygen species formed
within the cells, initiating toxic oxidative stress processes which dramatically affect cellular
metabolism and viability [1, 2]. It is now well documented that high levels of oxidative stress
in human cells are involved in the development of serious diseases, like cancers or
pathologies related with aging, Alzheimer or Parkinson diseases [3]. Detoxification of O2●- is
thus a crucial part of the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms which allow the cells to
cope with the presence of molecular oxygen [1, 2]. So far, only two superoxide detoxification
systems have been described. The first one is the well-known superoxide dismutase (SOD),
present in almost all aerobic organisms, catalyzing dismutation of O2●- into H2O2 and O2 [4].
The second one, superoxide reductase (SOR), has been discovered more recently [5, 6] and up
to now has been only found in microorganisms [7-10]. SOD and SOR are structurally
unrelated metalloproteins and carry out different reactions. SOR catalyzes the one-electron
reduction of O2●- into H2O2 (eq. 1), the electron being provided by cellular reductases or
soluble electron transfer proteins [7-10]:
O2- + 1e- + 2H+ → H2O2

(eq. 1)

Although different classes of SOR have been described depending on the presence of an
additional structural domain, which can bind a rubredoxin-like iron center (named center I),
they all exhibit the same active site, named center II [7-10]. The SOR active site in its reduced
form consists of an unusual non-heme Fe2+ center in a [His4 Cys1] square pyramidal
pentacoordination [11-14], which reacts at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate with O2- [15-19].
The catalytic mechanism of SORs has been extensively studied, mainly using pulse radiolysis
[15-19]. Ferric iron hydroperoxide [14-18] and more recently ferrous iron-superoxo species

3

[19, 20] have been proposed as reaction intermediates during the course of superoxide
reduction to produce H2O2. A first reaction intermediate T1 is rapidly formed upon the
binding of O2●- to the vacant sixth coordination position of the Fe2+ site (Scheme 1). In the
case of the Desulfoarculus baarsii enzyme, T1 was proposed to be a ferrous iron-superoxo
species [19]. This first reaction intermediate undergoes a protonation process by H3O+ from
the bulk solvent, to form a second reaction intermediate, an Fe3+-hydroperoxo species (T1’ in
Scheme 1). The second reaction intermediate was proposed to be specifically protonated on
its proximal oxygen atom by a water molecule, hydrogen bonded to lysine 48, a highly
conserved residue located close to the iron site, thus promoting the formation of the H2O2
product [14, 19] (Scheme 1). Although this second reaction intermediate could not be
observed by pulse radiolysis, probably because it did not accumulate [19], its presence was
deduced both from the X-ray structures of iron-peroxide intermediates trapped in the active
site of SOR [14] and from the effects of the K48I mutation on the reactivity of SOR [19]. In
particular, it was proposed that the mutation of lysine 48 into isoleucine, by preventing a
specific protonation of the proximal oxygen of the Fe3+-OOH species, favors its O-O bond
cleavage to form a high valent iron-oxo species, which is avoided in the wild-type enzyme
[19]. Finally, following the release of H2O2, the Fe3+ active site remains hexacoordinated with
the presence of HO-/H2O ligand in the sixth coordination position (P1 in Scheme 1). The HO/H2O ligand is further replaced by the carboxylate side chain of the conserved glutamate 47
residue, to form a hexacoordinated Fe3+-E47 species at the end of the catalytic cycle [17, 19]
(P2 in Scheme 1).
The strictly conserved cysteine axial ligand in the SOR active site has been hypothesized
to be an essential feature for the reactivity of the enzyme with superoxide [7-10]. However,
cysteine substitution to probe its function is not possible, since it would lead, most likely, to
the formation of a demetallated SOR active site [21]. Interestingly, several amino-acid

4

residues were pointed out to interact with the sulfur atom of the cysteine ligand, suggesting
that they could modulate the properties of the S-Fe bond and thus the reactivity of SOR with
O2●-. In D. baarsii SOR, the buried carboxylic side chain of E114 establishes a dipolar
interaction with the sulfur ligand (C116) [22, 23] and its mutation into an alanine (E114A)
was shown to specifically decrease the strength the Fe-S(Cys) bond [23]. Such a modification
on the strength of the Fe-S(Cys) bond was reported to induce an increase of the pKa of the
first reaction intermediate T1, providing experimental evidence for a role of the sulfur ligand
in the control of the evolution of the reaction intermediate in SOR catalysis [23].
By comparison with other Fe-S(Cys) containing metalloproteins, cytochrome P450,
rubredoxins or ferredoxins [24-26], it was proposed that in SORs, two NH peptide groups
from leucine/isoleucine and histidine of a well conserved tetrapeptide C116-N117-L/I118H119 are within H-bonding distance to the sulfur iron ligand [11-14, 27] (Figure 1). In the
crystal structure of the SOR from D. baarsii, these N(H)-S distances are 3.4 Å and 3.2 Å for
the I118 and H119 backbone, respectively (Figure 1), in agreement with the fact that H-bonds
involving a sulfur atom are longer than those involving an oxygen atom. These N(H)-S bond
distances in SOR are slightly shorter than those reported for the sulfur ligands of rubredoxin
(3.6-3.9 Å) [26].
In this work, we have investigated the effect of one of the peptide NH groups on the
sulfur ligand and on the reactivity of the SOR from D. baarsii with O2●- by mutating the I118
residue into A, D, or S. In these mutants, the steric constraints exerted by the lateral chains are
expected to impact the positioning of the NH peptide group with respect to the sulfur ligand.
The H119 position was not mutated since the histidine side-chain is directly involved in the
iron coordination and its substitution, most likely, would result in important alterations of the
active site.

5

Our data show that mutations of I118 induce a strengthening of the Fe-S(Cys) and SCβ(Cys) bonds and a decrease of the pKa of the reaction intermediates. These results are
consistent with the decrease of the strength of an hydrogen bond between the I118 peptide
NH group and the sulfur ligand. These effects are opposite to those reported for the E114A
mutant [23], showing that, in the SOR from D. baarsii, the strength of the Fe-S(Cys) bond is
finely tuned by different second coordination sphere residues.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Materials. For pulse radiolysis experiments, sodium formate and buffers were of the
highest grade available (Prolabo Normatom or Merck Suprapure). Oxygen was from ALPHA
GAZ. Its purity is higher than 99.99%. Water was purified using an Elga Maxima system
(resistivity 18.2 MΩ). K2IrCl6 was from Strem Chemical Inc.
Site-directed mutagenesis and protein purification. Mutagenesis was carried out on the
plasmid pMJ25 [6], with the QuickChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
Plasmid pMJ25 is a pJF119EH derivative, in which the sor gene from D. baarsii was cloned
under the control of a tac IPTG inducible promotor [6]. Six primers were designed for the
PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to create the three I118 SOR mutants, I118A, I118S and
I118D. Primer 1 (5’ GAA TAC TGC AAC GCC CAC GGC CAC TGG 3’) and primer 2
(5’CCA GTG GCC GTG GGC GTT GCA GTA TTC 3’) were used for the I118A mutation.
Primer 3 (5’ GAA TAC TGC AAC GAC CAC GGC CAC TGG 3’) and primer 4 (5’ CCA
GTG GCC GTG GTC GTT GCA GTA TTC 3’) were used for the I118D mutation. Primer 5
(5’ GAA TAC TGC AAC AGC CAC GGC CAC TGG 3’) and primer 6 (5’ CCA GTG GCC
GTG GCT GTT GCA GTA TTC 3’) were used for the I118S mutation. The mutations were
verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmids, pTE118A, pTE118S and pTE118D

6

were transformed in an E. coli BL21 strain. Over-expressions and purifications of the I118
mutant proteins were carried out as reported for the wild-type protein [6].
The purified mutant proteins were found to be as stable as the wild-type protein. The UVvis absorption spectrum of the purified proteins exhibited an A280nm/A503nm ratio of 4.8-4.9 and
appeared to be homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad® protein assay reagent. For each SOR
mutant, full metallation of the two mononuclear iron sites was verified by atomic absorption
spectroscopy, with two iron atoms per polypeptide chain (data not shown). All the I118
mutant proteins were isolated with an oxidized center I (503nm = 4,400 M-1 cm-1) and a fully
reduced center II. Fully oxidized SORs were obtained by treatment of the proteins with a
slight molar excess of K2IrCl6.
pH studies. The following buffers were used to cover a pH range from 5.0 to 10.5: acetate
for pH 5.0 and 5.5; MES for pH 5.6, 6.0 and 6.5; Bis-Tris propane or HEPES for pH 7.0; TrisHCl for pH 7.6, 8.1, 8.5 and 8.8; glycine-NaOH for pH 9.1, 9.5, 10.2 and 10.5. The apparent
pKa of the alkaline transition was determined from the pH dependence of the absorbance at
660 nm of the fully oxidized SOR mutant proteins, as reported in [16]. The titration curve was
fitted with the equation expected from a single protonation process, A 660nm = (A660max +
A660min x 10(pH-pKa app))/(1 +10(pH-pKa app)).
Redox titrations. The redox titrations were monitored by UV-visible absorption at 18 °C
under an N2 atmosphere in a Jacomex glove box equipped with a UV-visible cell coupled to
an Uvikon XL spectrophotometer by optical fibers (Photonetics system). The sample cuvette
contained 3 ml of 50 µM of protein solution in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, in the
presence of the following mediators at 2 µM each: ferrocene (+422 mV), N, N’-dimethyl-pphenylenediamine (+371 mV), 1,4-benzoquinone (+280 mV), 2.5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone
(+180 mV), duroquinone (+5 mV). The redox potentials were measured with a combined Pt-

7

Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) microelectrode, with respect to a standard hydrogen electrode. The
potential of the solution was poised by stepwise additions of small quantities of either 5 mM
of K2IrCl6 (starting from as-isolated SOR), or 10 mM sodium dithionite (starting from
oxidized SOR). After each addition of K2IrCl6 or sodium dithionite, the solution was
equilibrated during 5 min. After the potential reading had stabilized, the potential and the UVvisible absorption spectrum were recorded. The data were fitted to the Nernst equation for a
one-electron reaction.
Pulse radiolysis. Pulse radiolysis measurements were performed as described elsewhere
[28]. Briefly, free radicals were generated by irradiation of O2-saturated aqueous protein
solutions (100 M), in 2 mM buffer, 10 mM sodium formate with 0.2-2 μs pulses of 4 MeV
electrons at the linear accelerator at the Curie Institute, Orsay, France. Superoxide anion, O2●-,
was generated during the scavenging by formate of the radiolytically produced hydroxyl
radical, HO [28]. The doses per pulse were calibrated from the absorption of the thiocyanate
radical (SCN)2•- obtained by radiolysis of the thiocyanate ion in N2O- saturated solution
([SCN-] = 10-2 M, G((SCN)2•-) = 0.55 µmol. J-1, ε472 nm = 7580 M-1 cm-1). For instance, a dose
of 5 Gy per pulse (0.2 μs long) resulted in 2.8 µM of O2-. The dose varied linearly with the
pulse length. Reactions were followed spectrophotometrically, using a Hamamatsu
SuperQuiet xenon-mercury lamp (150 W) between 310 and 750 nm or a tungsten lamp
between 450 and 750 nm, at 20 °C in a 2 cm path length fused silica cuvette. In all the pulse
radiolysis experiments, a cut-off filter cutting all wavelengths below 425 nm was positioned
between the lamp and the cuvette. Kinetics were analyzed at different wavelengths using a
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm from the Kaleidagraph® software package (Synergy
Software).
Resonance Raman spectroscopy. For the Raman experiments, 3.5 μL of concentrated
protein (4-6 mM) were deposited on a glass slide sample holder and then transferred into a
8

cold helium gas circulating optical cryostat (STVP-100, Janis Research), held at 15 K.
Resonance Raman spectra were recorded using a Jobin-Yvon U1000 spectrometer, equipped
with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon, France). Excitation
at 647.1 nm (30 mW) was provided by an Innova Kr+ laser (Coherent, Palo Alto). The signalto-noise ratios were improved by spectral collections of 6 cycles of 30 s accumulation time.
The reported spectra were the results of averaging 5-7 single spectra. The spectral analysis
was made using the Grams 32 software (Galactic Industries). The spectrometer calibration
was done as previously described in [29]. The frequencies of the resonance Raman bands of
SORs were also internally calibrated against the main band of the ice lattice (230 cm-1) and a
residual laser emission at 676.4 nm (669 cm-1). The frequency precision was 0.5-1 cm-1 for
the most intense bands and 1.5-2 cm-1 for the weakest bands.
FTIR. Electrochemically-induced FTIR difference spectra were recorded, using a thin
pathlength electrochemical cell and a Bruker 66 SX spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam
splitter and a nitrogen-cooled MCT-A detector, as described in [22]. 10 µL of a 1 mM
solution of SOR in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl were
used for one sample. Ferrocene, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 1,4-benzoquinone,
N,N,N’,N’-tetra-methyl-p-phenylenediamine,

2,3,4,5-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine,

phenazine ethosulfate, and duroquinone were used as electrochemical mediators, at

a

concentration of 40 µM.
Electronic absorption and EPR spectroscopies. Optical absorbance measurements were
performed using a Varian Cary spectrophotometer (0.2 nm bandwidth) with 1 cm path length
cuvette. Low-temperature (4.2 K) X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX 081
spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instrument continuous flow cold He gas cryostat.
DFT calculations. Three models (designed A, B and C) of the SOR active site have been
built using the structure of the wild-type SOR with the 2IJ1 PDB code [14]. All include the

9

side chains plus the Cα atoms of the five amino-acids binding the iron atom (residues H49,
H69, H75, H119, C116). In model A, α-carbons were kept fixed in their crystallographic
positions, while the hydrogens bound to them (replacing the adjacent atoms) were free to
move only along the Cα-N or Cα-C direction found in the crystallographic structure. Model B
is similar to A except that the peptide bond between H119 and I118 was added (i.e. a –NHCOH moiety replaces the hydrogen atom of model A). In order to maintain the orientation of
the N–H...S hydrogen bond, the additional carbonyl oxygen was fixed in its crystallographic
position, as reported in [30]. In model C, the backbone of the C116-N117-I118-H119
tetrapeptide was added. The same Cα atoms as in models A and B were kept fixed, as well as
the two carbonyl oxygens in order to maintain the two N–H...S interactions. For residues N117
and I118, side chains were replaced by hydrogen atoms in order to save computation time.
Each model was optimized in the absence or presence of superoxide anion or hydroperoxide
bound to the iron atom. A model was also considered with a hydroxide anion bound to iron,
as a model of the Fe3+ resting state. Calculations were performed using the Gaussian03
package [31] and geometries were optimized with the B3LYP [32, 33] hybrid density
functional using a double-ζ quality basis set (hereafter B1). The 6-31G* basis set was used for
all atoms but Fe, N, O and S of the first coordination sphere of the iron. For these N, O and S
atoms of the first coordination sphere of the iron and involved in hydrogen bonds, the 631+G* basis set was employed. For iron, the lanl2dz with ECP [34] was completed by a set of
f polarization functions of exponent 2.462 and a set of d diffuse function of exponent 0.0706
[35]. Energies were computed with B3LYP and the all-electron triple-ζ 6-311+G** (called B2
in the following) basis set on previously optimized geometries. Polarization effects on the
environment were accounted for by the mean of the PCM implicit model of solvent ([36] and
references therein), with a dielectric constant of 5.75 and a probe radius of 2.7, at the B1
level. The proton affinity of the different models was explored by computing the energetics of

10

the reaction leading to its protonated counterpart. This was made by using a solvation energy
of 260 kcal/mol [37]. All systems have been studied in their high-spin state (S=2 for Fe2+
resting state, S=5/2 for Fe2+-OO-, Fe3+-OOH and Fe3+-OH), consistent with previous results
obtained on similar models using comparable methods [19, 20, 30].

RESULTS

Electronic absorption spectroscopy. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the purified D.
baarsii, I118A, I118D and I118S SOR mutants exhibited the characteristic absorption bands
at 370 nm and 503 nm (ε503nm = 4.4 mM-1 cm-1) (data not shown), arising from the ferric iron
center I [6]. When treated with K2IrCl6, the spectra of the mutants exhibited an increase in
absorbance in the 500-700 nm region, reflecting oxidation of the iron center II [16]. As
reported for the wild-type SOR [16], the absorption band maximum of the ferric iron center II
of the I118 mutants was blue-shifted at alkaline pHs (Supplemental data Figure S1). This
process, called alkaline transition, reflects the displacement of the glutamate 47 ligand on the
sixth coordination position of center II (Fe3+-E47, maximum of absorption at 644 nm) by a
hydroxide ion, to form an Fe3+-OH species (maximum of absorption at 560 nm) [16, 39]. As
shown in Table 1, when compared to the wild-type SOR, the apparent pKa associated with
this process was significantly higher in the I118S SOR mutant. This effect was less
pronounced for the I118A and I118D mutants. In addition, the absorbance band maxima of
the Fe3+-E47 forms of the I118A, I118D and I118S SOR mutants were shifted by +7 nm (-167
cm-1), +4 nm (-96 cm-1) and +7 nm (-167 cm-1), respectively, when compared to the wild-type
SOR (Table 1). Since the SOR proteins were found highly unstable at pH values higher than
10.2, the absorbance band maxima of the Fe3+-OH forms of the I118 mutants could not be

11

determined, but we deduced from the spectra recorded at pH 10.2 that they were below 580
nm (Supplemental data Figure S1).
EPR spectroscopy. The 4 K EPR spectra of the as-isolated I118 SOR mutants displayed
resonances at g = 7.7, 5.7, 4.1 and 1.8, similar to those obtained for the wild-type protein [6]
(data not shown). These resonances were typical of those of an Fe3+ ion in a distorted
tetrahedral FeS4 center and originated from center I [6, 27]. The 4 K EPR spectrum of the
I118 SOR mutants oxidized with a slight excess of K2IrCl6 exhibited an additional signal at g
= 4.3, identical to that observed for the oxidized wild-type SOR (data not shown). This g =
4.3 signal was attributed to the oxidized center II, with a rhombic (E/D = 0.33) high-spin (S =
5/2) ferric ion [6, 27]. No other signal was detected (data not shown).
Redox potentials. Potentiometric titrations of the I118 SOR mutants were monitored by
electronic absorption spectroscopy at pH 7.6. The iron center II of each mutant was oxidized
by addition of a stoichiometric amount of K2IrCl6 and the redox dependence of its absorption
spectrum was studied by successive additions of sodium dithionite (Supplemental data Figure
S2). The reversibility of the redox process was checked by re-oxidizing the fully reduced
protein by addition of K2IrCl6, and was observed in all instances (data not shown). As shown
in Table 1, the I118 A and D mutations had no significant effect on the redox potential of
center II at pH 7.6, whereas the I118S mutation slightly increased it.
FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR difference spectroscopy was used to evaluate the impact of the
mutations on the structural changes accompanying the oxidoreduction of the iron center II.
The reduced minus oxidized FTIR difference spectra recorded with the wild-type and the
I118S SOR mutant were superimposed in Figure 2a. The spectra are very similar, notably
below 1450 cm-1, and the IR signatures of the histidine ligands (1109 cm-1 for reduced and
1097 cm-1 for oxidized SOR) [40] were not significantly altered in the mutant. No IR band
could be assigned to the side chain of S118, indicating that the redox state of the iron does not

12

impact the vibrational properties of the S118 side chain. Significant differences with the wildtype were revealed in the 1700-1450 cm-1 region for the I118S mutant. These differences are
evidenced in the mutant-minus-wild-type difference spectrum recorded in H2O (Figure 2b).
They consist in signals appearing at 1670-1660 (+) / 1683, 1639 (-) cm-1 and at 1554, 1504
(+) / 1543, 1523 (-) cm-1, that could be confidently assigned to amide I ((C=O)) and amide II
((CN)+(NH)) modes of peptide bonds, since they shifted by -3 to -11 cm-1 ((C=O)) and by
more than -50 cm-1 ((CN)+(NH)), respectively, in spectra recorded in D2O (Figure 2c). The
bands observed between 1680 and 1630 cm-1 could result from frequency shifts of the (C=O)
mode of peptide groups in the mutant, as compared to the wild type. The I118A mutation
induced very similar changes in the FTIR difference spectrum, associated with the reduction
of the iron center II, notably in the amide II region where the (CN)+(NH) modes contribute,
while only part of these changes was observed for the I118D mutation (Supplemental data,
Figure S3). These data show that the I118S and I118A mutations have no major global impact
on the structure of the SOR active site, but that they significantly affect the IR mode
frequencies of at least one peptide bond around the iron center II.
Resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy. Figure 3A shows the 15 K RR spectra of K2IrCl6oxidized wild-type and I118 SOR mutants, excited at 647.1 nm, which allowed a resonance
with the S-(Cys) → Fe3+ charge transfer (CT) transition (644-651 nm). The RR spectra of
SORs excited in such a condition show a number of bands arising from Fe-S stretch coupled
with vibrations of the Cys residue [27, 41]. This effect is very similar to that observed for
blue copper proteins and Fe-S proteins for which the frequency, number and relative intensity
of the observed RR bands are dependent on the Fe-S bond strength and the conformation of
the Cys side chain [42-46].
The observed RR frequencies of the wild-type D. baarsii and its I118 mutants are listed
in Table 2. In the RR spectra of D. vulgaris and D. baarsii, excited at 647.1 nm, four
13

predominant bands are observed between 200 and 800 cm-1. These bands peak at 299, 314,
357 and 743 cm-1 for the D. vulgaris SOR [27], and at 299, 317, 358 and 742 cm-1 for D.
baarsii one (Figure 3A). On the basis of

34

S and

15

N labeling [27], the 299 cm-1 line was

assigned to a mode involving primarily the Fe-S(Cys) stretch (ν(FeS)). The 314 and 357 cm-1
bands were attributed to major contributions of deformations of the SCβCα(Cys) grouping
(δ(SCβCα)), and of the Cys side chain (δ(SCβCα(C(O))N(H)C(O)), respectively. A mode
mainly corresponding to the S-Cβ stretch (ν(SCβ)) was associated with the 743 cm-1 band [27].
Since the SORs from D. baarsii and Desulfovibrio vulgaris belong to the same 2Fe-SOR
family and exhibit very similar spectroscopic properties [27], we have analyzed our RR data
on the basis of the band assignments proposed for the D. vulgaris enzyme [27].
The 299 cm-1 band of wild-type SOR from D. baarsii was significantly shifted to 302 cm1

in the spectra of the I118A, I118D and I118S mutants (Figures 3A and Supplemental data

Figure S4; Table 2). These upshifts were also clearly identified in the “wild-type minus I118
mutant” difference spectra (Figure 3B). When the intensity of the mode involving a major
contribution of ν(SCβ) is kept constant (742-744 cm-1), one can observe an increase in
relative intensity of the 302 cm-1 band of the mutants when compared to the 299 cm-1 line of
the wild-type SOR (Figure 3A). In the RR spectra of blue copper systems and Fe-S proteins
excited in S(Cys)-to-metal CT transitions, the most intense peak is generally the one
exhibiting the largest

34

S isotope sensitivity and thus having the predominant ν(Fe-S)

character [42-46]. The same observations hold for the red-excited-RR spectra of 1Fe-SORs
and 2Fe-SORs [23, 27, 41]. Displacement of atoms along the Fe-S coordinate in the electronic
excited state, involving the S- → Fe3+ CT, is responsible for an Fe-S stretch being the most
intense feature in the RR spectra excited at 647.1 nm. The most intense line of the RR spectra
of 2Fe-SORs is observed in the 290-310 cm-1 region and exhibit the highest

34

S sensitivity.

The relative increased intensities of the 302 cm-1 bands of the I118 mutants may be assigned

14

to an increased resonance condition given the redshifts of the CT band (Table 1). Thus, the
most intense RR band in the 300 cm-1 region is a sensitive indicator of the Fe-S bond strength
[23]. The upshifts from 299 cm-1 for the wild-type enzyme to 302 cm-1 for the three I118
mutants support an increased strength of the axial Fe-S(Cys) bond in the mutants (Table 2 ).
The 314-317 cm-1 band of the wild-type SOR originates from kinematic and vibronic
coupling of the internal Cys deformations (δ(SCβCα)) with the Fe-S stretch [27]. Due to the
strong decrease in RR activity of the 317 cm-1 band, its position in the spectra of the I118
mutants is difficult to establish (Figure 3A). The spectral deconvolutions indicate that its
homolog corresponds to either the weak band at 314-316 cm-1 bands or the weak or medium
bands at 308-309 cm-1 (Supplemental data Figure S4). This decreased RR activity is hardly
compatible with the redshifts of the S-(Cys) → Fe3+ CT (Table 1). It would rather correspond
to a change in coupling of the δ(SCβCα) and ν(Fe-S) mode, i.e. a decreased contribution of the
Fe-S stretch in the normal mode composition of the 308-317 cm-1 band. In the RR spectra of
the blue copper proteins and its model compounds, such a change in mode coupling originates
from a modification of the (metal-S-Cα)-(S-Cβ-Cα) dihedral angle [43]. The RR bands of the
340-410 cm-1 region were also significantly affected in the spectra of the I118 mutants (Figure
3 A, B; Supplemental data Figure S4). These deformation modes of the cysteine ligand with
the peptide backbone to which it is attached [27, 41] (Table 2) exhibit changes in frequency
and/or in intensity, supporting some local protein reorganization. The spectral changes of the
310-410 cm-1 RR bands are thus all consistent with a conformational change of the cysteine
side chain and the peptide backbone in its proximity.
In the high-frequency region of RR spectra, the 742 cm-1 band of the wild-type SOR is
gradually upshifted at 743 cm-1 for the I118D mutant and at 744 cm-1 for the I118A and I118S
mutants (Figure 3A). In the difference spectra (Figure 3B), the s-shaped signal in the 710-760
cm-1 region illustrates the marked sensitivity of the ν(SCβ) mode to the I118A and I118S

15

mutations. Its increased frequency reflects an increase of the electron density of the S-Cβ
bond.
Therefore, for the I118 SOR mutants, changes in energy and in intensity of the RR modes
involving the Fe-S-CβH2- bonds were observed. These changes are consistent with a
conformational change of the Cys side chain inducing a change in H-bonding. On the basis of
the frequency upshifts of the primarily ν(Fe-S(Cys)) and ν(S-Cβ) modes, the Fe-S and S-Cβ
bond strengths are increased, indicating a decreased H-bonding state of the S(Cys) site.
Weak bands in the 210-240 cm-1 region have been attributed to stretching modes of the
Fe-N(His) bonds (ν(FeN(His)) [27, 41]. Although in the I118 SOR mutants, intensity
variations were detected for these bands, no significant frequency changes were observed
(218-220 and 240-241 cm-1) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Thus, the equatorial Fe-N4(His)
coordinate is not significantly affected by mutations of the I118 residue.
Pulse radiolysis study of the I118 SOR mutants. The reaction of the I118 SOR mutants
with O2- was studied by pulse radiolysis, which allowed the observation of transient
intermediates formed during the reaction course [18, 19]. The kinetics of the reaction were
followed spectrophotometrically between 450 and 700 nm and the protein was present in a
large excess with respect to O2●-, ensuring pseudo first-order conditions. A 425 nm cut-off
filter was positioned on the light beam in order to avoid photochemical reactions involving
the reaction intermediates [18]. Similarly to the wild-type protein [16, 18, 19], all the I118
SOR mutants reacted very rapidly with O2- to form, 50 µs after the pulse, the first reaction
intermediate T1, proposed in the case of the D. baarsii enzyme to be an Fe2+-superoxo species
(Scheme 1, [19]). The absorbance spectrum of T1 was not significantly affected by the I118
mutations, exhibiting a broad band centered at 600-610 nm, with an extinction coefficient of
about 2.5 mM-1 cm-1 (Supplemental data Figure S5). Second-order rate constants for the
formation of T1 (k1) were determined to be (1.2 ± 0.2) x 109 M-1 s-1, (1.1 ± 0.3) x 109 M-1 s-1

16

and (1.4 ± 0.3) x 109 M-1 s-1 for the I118A, I118D, and I118S SOR mutants, respectively.
These values are very similar to that determined for the wild-type protein ((1.0 ± 0.2) x 109 M1

s-1) [16, 19]. For the three mutants, k1 was found to be pH-independent between pH 5 and

pH 9.5 (data not shown), as reported for the wild-type protein [16, 19].
For the wild-type protein, the decay of T1 led to the formation of a SOR Fe3+-OH/H2O
species (P1 in Scheme 1), with a rate constant k2. Log k2 was found to decrease linearly with
increasing the pH value for pHs < 8.0 and to be pH-independent at pH > 8, with a transition at
pH 8. At pH < 7, the I118A, I118D and I118S SOR mutations did not markedly affect the
values of k2 and its pH-dependence (Figure 4 and Supplemental data Figure S6). However, for
the I118 mutants at pH > 7.0, the pH transition was lowered to 7 and k2 became pHindependent. Thus, the pH transition appeared at a more acidic pH in the mutants when
compared to the wild-type SOR (Figure 4 and Supplemental data Figure S6). Consequently,
the k2 values at pHs above 8 were increased by a factor of about 4 for the I118 SOR mutants
in comparison to that of the wild-type SOR.
The spectra of P1 for the I118 SOR mutants were reconstructed at pH 6.0 and pH 9.5, 10
ms and 180 ms after the beginning of the reaction, respectively (Figure 5 and Supplemental
data Figure S7). For the wild-type SOR, this spectrum depends on the pH value, reflecting the
acid-base equilibrium between the Fe3+-OH2 and Fe3+-OH species (maxima of absorbance at
640 and 560 nm, respectively), with an estimated pKa value of 7.0 [19] (Figure 5 and
Supplemental data Figure S7). At pH 6.0, for the I118A, D and S SOR mutants, the P1 spectra
were almost superimposable to that of the wild-type SOR at the same pH (data not shown).
However, for the I118A, D and S SOR mutants at pH 9.5, these spectra differed from that of
the wild-type SOR at the same pH, exhibiting a broad band with a maximum at 600-625 nm.
Such a broad absorbance band is consistent with the presence of a mixture of Fe 3+-Glu (644
nm) and Fe3+-OH species (560 nm) at pH 9.5, which was similarly observed for the wild-type

17

protein, but at a lower pH (pH 8.5, [19]). These data suggest that the pKa value of P1 in the
I118 mutants was increased compared to that of the wild-type SOR.
For the wild-type SOR, the evolution of P1 to the final reaction product P2 (rate constant
k3) was shown to correspond to the binding of the E47 carboxylate side chain to the ferric iron
site, in place of the OH/OH2 ligand (Scheme 1) [19, 38]. The pH dependence of k3 was
proposed to reflect a general acid catalysis, associated with the pKa value of the Fe3+OH/Fe3+-OH2 equilibrium (P1), where the aquo ligand was more easily displaced by the
carboxylate side chain of E47 than the hydroxo ligand [17, 19]. For the I118A, D and S SOR
mutants, the pH-dependence of k3 was still consistent with such a general acid catalysis, with
however an apparent pKa value higher than that determined for the wild-type protein, 9.1
versus 7.0, respectively (Figure 6 and Supplemental data Figure S8). These data suggest that
the I118A, D and S SOR mutations induced a stabilisation of the Fe3+-OH2 species in the P1
species, in comparison to the wild-type SOR.
The spectrum of the final product P2 was reconstructed at pHs 6.0 and 9.5 for the I118
SOR mutants (Figure 7 and Supplemental data Figure S9). At pH 6.0, the mutants exhibited a
spectrum similar to that of the wild-type protein, with an absorbance band centred at 644 nm,
associated with an Fe3+-Glu species [16] (Figure 7 and Supplemental data Figure S9). At pH
9.5, the spectrum of the final product of the wild-type SOR exhibited an absorbance band
peaking at 560 nm, characteristic of an Fe3+-OH species [16, 39]. For the I118A, D and S
SOR mutants at pH 9.5, the spectrum of the final product, exhibited a broad absorbance band
with maximum at 600-625 nm, consistent with the presence of a mixture of Fe3+-Glu (644
nm) and Fe3+-OH species (560 nm) at this pH. These results suggest an increase of the
apparent pKa value of the final Fe3+-E47 species for these three SOR mutants, in comparison
to that of the wild-type SOR. This is in agreement with the increase of the apparent pKa value
of the alkaline transition determined for these three mutants (Table 1).

18

Pulse radiolysis study of the E114A SOR mutant. When compared to the previous data
obtained for the E114A SOR mutant [23], the I118A, D and S mutations appeared to have
opposite effects both on the strength of the Fe-S bond and on the protonation rate of the T1
intermediate, as observed by pulse radiolysis. However in reference [23], the pulse radiolysis
experiments were carried out in conditions where photochemical reactions likely occurred at
the level of the reaction intermediates [18]. Here, the reaction kinetics of the E114A mutant
with O2●- were reinvestigated in the presence of a 425 nm cut-off filter in order to avoid any
photochemical processes [18]. Similarly to the wild-type and the I118 SOR mutants, the
reaction of the E114A mutant with O2●- led to the formation of two transients T1 and P1,
before evolving to the final reaction product P2 (data not shown). The rate constant of T1
formation (k1) was not affected by the E114A mutation and was found to be pH-independent
between pH 5.5 to 9.5 (data not shown). At pHs between 5.5 and 8.5, the decay of T1 (rate
constant k2) was found to be directly proportional to the H+ concentration (Supplemental data
Figure S10.A). However in this pH range, the k2 values determined for the E114A mutant
were found to be 6-9 times smaller than those determined for the wild-type protein. At pH >
8.5, for the E114A mutant, k2 slightly increased with decreasing H+ concentration, with values
from 7 to 10 times smaller than those found for the wild-type SOR (Supplemental data Figure
S10.A). These data show that the E114A SOR mutation decreases the rate of protonation of
T1, as it was previously reported in [23]. This indicates that the photochemical processes
occurring in this former study did not affect the rate of k2. As shown in Supplemental data
Figure S10.B, the pH-dependence of k3 for the E114A SOR mutant exhibited an apparent pKa
value very similar to that of the wild-type SOR. However, the E114A mutation induced a
decrease of the k3 values by a factor of 2.5 to 10 between pH 5.5 and pH 9.6 (Supplemental
data Figure S10.B).

DFT Calculations. In order to rationalize the effects of H-bonds toward the sulfur ligand
on the reactivity of SOR with O2●-, three models corresponding to the five-membered Fe2+
form, the T1 intermediate (Fe2+-OO●) and its subsequently protonated species (Fe3+-OOH),
have been studied by DFT calculations. A fourth structure, Fe3+-OH, has also been considered
to account for a model of the ferric state of SOR after formation of hydrogen peroxide. Each
intermediate has been modeled by three models, each with a different number of N-H…S
interactions. Model A has no H-bond on the sulfur ligand, model B has one H-bond, and
model C has two H-bonds (wild-type SOR). Figure 8 shows the structure of the three models
A, B and C for the Fe2+-OO● species (T1). Discussed geometric parameters (Fe-S and Fe-O
distances) as well as charges and spin population of Fe and S atoms are presented in Table 3
for the four species Fe2+, Fe2+-OO●, Fe3+-OOH and Fe3+-OH, each described by models A, B
and C. A more complete set of data is available as Supplemental data, Tables S1, S2 and S3.
For the five-membered Fe2+ structure, models A, B and C showed good agreement with
the corresponding PDB structure of SOR (2IJ1) [14]. In term of geometry, the Fe-S bond is
slightly affected by the number of H-bonds toward S with a distance of 2.35 Å in A, 2.37 Å in
B and 2.39 Å in C (2.41 Å in PDB). Consistently, a slight increase of the atomic charge and
spin population of Fe, accompanied by a decrease of respective values for S, is found when
including one and then two H-bonds toward S. These trends are significant and indicate that
the Fe-S bond is weakened by H-bonds toward S. Similar observation were made for the Fe2+OO● and Fe3+-OOH species.
For the Fe2+-OO● species (models A, B, C), the -OO●- moiety bears a total charge of ca. 0.8 (i.e. the substrate keeps most of its negative charge) and has a spin population slightly
larger than 1.0. Upon binding of the -OO●- moiety to the ferrous iron, the spin population as
well as the atomic charge do not vary significantly. Consistently with previous findings [19],
the iron atom keeps its formal oxidation state of +2, while superoxide remains a radical anion.

20

Nevertheless, a sizeable increase of the Fe-S distance occurs when OO●- binds to Fe (i.e.:
passing from the five-membered Fe2+ to the Fe2+-OO● one): 0.20 Å in model A, 0.24 Å in B
and 0.32 Å in C. This decrease in Fe-S interaction can be related to a trans influence between
S and superoxide.
As for the five-coordinate Fe2+ species, comparison of structures for models A, B and C
shows that the Fe-S bond is lengthened if the number of H-bonds is increased. This trend is
noticeable, since the Fe-S distance is 2.55 Å in A, 2.61 Å in B and 2.72 Å in C. Consistently,
the Fe-O distance decreases with the increase of the Fe-S one: the values for the Fe-O bond
length are 2.29 Å in model A, 2.23 Å in B and 2.20 Å in C. The presence of H-bonds thus
modulates the trans influence between the sulfur ligand and the superoxide.
Protonation of the distal oxygen of the Fe2+-OO● species leads to the iron-hydroperoxo
intermediate (Fe3+-OOH), where the hydroperoxide moiety has an overall charge of -1.1, with
a spin population of about 0.3 in the three models A, B and C. The substrate protonation is
accompanied by an increase of the atomic charge of the iron in the three models (e.g.: in
model C, the charge of iron is 1.34 for the Fe2+-OO● species and 1.52 in the Fe3+-OOH one).
Accordingly (see Table 3), the sulfur ligand becomes less negative in the three models after
protonation. The spin populations of both the Fe and S atoms also increase during this
process. This shows that the substrate moiety loses its radical character by abstracting one
electron after protonation, thus leading to a formal Fe3+ covalently bound to an OOH- moiety.
In term of geometry, the Fe-S and Fe-O bonds are shorter than in the Fe2+-OO● structure. This
is consistent with an iron atom formally losing one electron.
When comparing the models A, B and C for the Fe3+-OOH species, the general trends
observed in the previous Fe2+-OO● intermediates are found again. The presence of H-bonds
toward sulfur makes the Fe-S bond longer and the Fe-O one shorter. However, this effect
remains much more limited than for the Fe2+-OO● species. For the Fe3+-OOH species, the

21

changes in Fe-S and Fe-O bond lengths are found in a range of 0.04-005 Å in the three
models. Interestingly, while H-bonds have a limited effect on geometries, their influence on
the electronic structure is more important. Hence the spin population of sulfur is larger in
model A than in models B and C with respective values of 0.49, 0.38 and 0.33, respectively.
Consistently, the charge separation between sulfur and iron is enhanced by the presence of Hbonds (sulfur becomes more negative and iron more positive (see charges, Table 3). Again the
presence of H-bonds weakens the Fe-S interaction, which in turn strengthens the Fe-O one.
Indeed, the charge of the oxygen atom bound to iron decreases while its spin population
increases, going from A to B and C. As can be seen in Table 3, the last structure studied, the
Fe3+-OH species which is formed alter the release of H2O2, shows similar trends as already
pointed. The Fe-S bond is shortened while the Fe-O one becomes longer when adding Hbonds toward S. The effect of H-bonding is of comparable magnitude as previously noted
with a variation of +0.08 Å for Fe-S between A and -0.05 Å for Fe-O between models A and
C. Charges and spin population are also in agreement with a reinforced Fe-S interaction when
H-bonds are absent. These observations are in agreement with the increased strength of the
Fe-S bond in the I118 SOR mutants observed by RR spectroscopy (Figure 3). RR also showed
an increase of the Cβ - S interaction. However, due to constraints applied to our models (fixed
Cα), our calculations did not provide any sizeable modification of the Cβ - S distance, which
remains at values close to 1.86 Å in the three models A, B and C of the Fe3+-OH resting state.
Finally, we also have studied the energetics for the protonation process of the Fe2+-OO●
intermediate to form the Fe3+-OOH species, which has been computed for each model A, B
and C. For the models A, B and C, the protonation process is found exothermic by 41.2, 36.2
and 32.6 kcal/mol respectively when using -260 kcal/mol as a reference for the solvated
proton [37] and B3LYP/B2//B3LYP/B1 plus solvation effects for calculated values. These
values are consistent with the -36 kcal/mol reported by Dey et al. for the same reaction, using

22

a similar approach [30]. Comparison of the values found for the three models shows that Hbonds toward the S atom make the protonation process less exothermic. Compared to model
C (wild-type SOR), the reaction is more exothermic in model B (I118 SOR mutants) by 5.6
kcal/mol and by 8.9 kcal/mol in model A (no H-bonds). Hence, thermodynamically, the
presence of H-bonds disfavors the protonation process of the first reaction intermediate T1.
These data are in agreement with the experimental observations presented in Figure 4,
showing that the I118 SOR mutations, which impaired one H-bond on the sulfur ligand,
induced an increase of the protonation rate of the T1 intermediate.

DISCUSSION

The presence of H-bonds on the sulfur atom of cysteine ligands is prominent in iron
proteins, e.g. in heme-thiolate proteins like cytochrome P450 or [Fe-S] cluster proteins [2426]. In SORs, two peptide NH groups from L/I118 and H119 are within H-bonding distance
of the C116 axial sulfur ligand (Figure 1, [11-14]), and they have been proposed to play an
important function in SOR [27, 30]. However, up to now, no experimental data were reported
concerning their role in catalysis. Site directed mutagenesis is a suitable technique for such
investigations, however some limitations have to be taken into account. As highlighted in the
Introduction section, the imidazole side chain of H119 is a ligand of the iron and consequently
this position cannot be mutated without introducing large perturbations, and possibly
demetallation of the active site. For the buried I118 position, mutation into a proline residue
to probe the function of its peptide NH group could also induce large conformation changes in
the protein. In fact, in the different amino-acid sequences of SOR available to date, no proline
residue was found in this position. Here we have mutated the I118 residue into A, D, and S,

23

assuming that the modifications of the side chain of I118 could impact the orientation and the
strength of the peptide NH hydrogen bond to the sulfur ligand.
Such specific effects of the I118 mutations on the peptide NH H-bond were supported by
FTIR spectroscopy, a very sensitive technique to investigate the structural modifications
accompanying the change in the redox state of the SOR iron site [22, 23]. FTIR showed that
whereas the I118 mutations had no major impact on the active site structure, they significantly
affected the conformation of at least one peptide bond around the iron active site, which are
compatible with a change in hydrogen bond involving peptide NH group(s).
RR spectroscopy further showed that the I118 A, D and S mutations had very specific
effects on the cysteine ligand. For these three mutants, the frequencies of the stretching modes
involving the Fe-S-CβH2- grouping clearly indicated an increase strength of the Fe3+-S(Cys)
and S-Cβ bonds. These data are in agreement with the alteration of at least one of the H-bonds
engaged by the S(Cys) ligand, inducing an increase of the electron density on the S(Cys) atom
in the I118 mutants. Interestingly, all these small structural alterations can be directly related
to the variation in the position of the S → Fe3+ charge transfer band [27, 47], which was
observed in the I118A, D and S mutants (+7, +4 and +7 nm, respectively, Table 1). Since the
maximum of the charge transfer band corresponds to the donor-acceptor transition energy of
the Fe-S bond, a decreased transition energy implies a more favorable transfer, i.e. that the
S(Cys) atom becomes less electronegative via weakening of its H-bonding state, in agreement
with our data. These changes in Fe-S bond strength do not however affect the EPR spectrum
of the SOR active site, which remains high-spin (S = 5/2) with a rhombic geometry (E/D =
0.33), as reported for the wild-type SOR from D. baarsii [6]. No axial feature, such as those
reported for the SOR from P. furiosus [47] and T. pallidum [48] was found in the EPR spectra
of the I118 SOR mutants.

24

Taken together, these data demonstrated that the A, S and D mutations have a similar
effect on the SOR active site. They all induced an apparently similar decrease in strength of
the H-bond between the peptide NH and the sulfur ligand, which in turn lead to a
strengthening of the Fe3+-S(Cys) bond. This effect most likely originates from a decrease in
size of the side chain of residue 118 that could slightly remodel the structure of the C116N117-I118-H119 tetrapeptide. This decrease in size has to be significant since we found no
frequency change for the modes involving the Fe-S-Cβ(Cys) bonds when we compared the
RR spectrum of the wild-type SOR with that of the I118V mutant (data not shown).
Surprisingly, the strengthening of the Fe3+-S(Cys) bond observed in the I118A, D and S
mutants has almost no effect on the redox potential of the iron active site. Only a small
positive variation for the S mutant was observed (Table 1). It should be noted that the redox
process occurring at the SOR active site is rather complex, involving both electron and proton
transfer and coordination of the carboxylate side chain of E47 to the ferric iron. Dey and coll.
[30] suggested by DFT calculations that in SOR H-bonds on the thiolate ligand could have an
opposite effect on the oxidation of the ferrous iron and on the subsequent coordination of the
E47 ligand to the ferric iron. In addition, the redox potential also depends on the stabilization
and/or destabilization of the oxidized and/or reduced form of the redox center and the I118
mutants could also strengthen the Fe2+-S(Cys) (ferrous) bond. However, no information on
the effect of the I118 SOR mutants on the Fe2+-S(Cys) bond is available yet. The ferrous form
does not present visible absorption band and could not be investigated by RR spectroscopy.

The I118 peptide NH hydrogen bond to the sulfur ligand controls the pKa of the reaction
intermediates
The studies of the reactivity of SOR with O2●- by pulse radiolysis further showed that the
presence of the I118 peptide H-bond on the sulfur ligand has a direct control on the pKa value

25

of the different intermediates species that are formed trans to the Fe-S(Cys) bond during
catalysis. Whereas the initial fast binding of O2●- to the ferrous iron site to form T1 (k1), was
not significantly modified by the I118 A, D and S mutations, they all induced an increase in
the rate of protonation of T1 (Fe2+-OO● species) at pH > 8.0, where H2O was proposed to be
the proton donor [19]. Since I118 is located on the opposite site of the iron atom compared to
the O2●- binding site (Figures 1 and 8), and since no major structural changes were observed
in the mutants by FTIR, the increase in the rate of T1 protonation could be hardly explained
by any structural modifications that might facilitate proton transfer from the water molecule
to the superoxo moiety of T1. Rather, the faster rate of protonation of T1 could be better
associated with a specific increase of its pKa value. This is in agreement with the Brönsted
catalysis equation, which predicts that among a series of bases, the logarithm of the rate
constant of protonation of a species is directly proportional to its pKa value. Such a
modification of the pKa value of T1 could result, through a trans electronic effect, from the
strengthening of the Fe-S(Cys) bond in the I118 mutants.
It should be noted that at pH < 8, where H3O+ was shown to be the proton donor [19], the
I118 mutations did not affect the rate of protonation step of T1. This could be in line with the
fact that in the presence of a strong acid, the dependence of the rate of protonation of a weak
base (T1) to its pKa value might not be valid any more.
Such an effect of the I118 peptide NH hydrogen bond to the sulfur ligand on the pKa
value of the T1 intermediate was further supported by DFT calculations (Figure 8, Table 3).
The calculations showed that for the Fe2+-OO● species (T1), the Fe-S(Cys) distance increased
significantly in the presence of H-bond(s) around the sulfur ligand, while the Fe-O distance
decreased slightly. The presence of H-bonds rendered the protonation process of the Fe2+OO●
species less exothermic, by 5.6 kcal/mol and 8.9 kcal/mol in the presence of one and two Hbonds, respectively. The Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle [49, 50] stipulates that for similar

26

reactions, the most exothermic one will have the lowest activation energy. Thus, one can
anticipate a lowering of the activation energy of protonation of the Fe2+OO● species in the
presence of only one of the two hydrogen bonds, as it is the case for the I118 SOR mutants.
These computational data are in full agreement with the experimental observations, which
showed that the reaction rate k2 for the protonation of the first reaction intermediate was
increased in the I118 mutants compared to wild-type SOR. These data also suggest that the
second H-bond to the sulfur ligand coming from the H119 NH amide group should have a
similar effect on k2. Thus, the two H-bonds from I118 and H119 to the sulfur ligand should
have an additive impact on the pKa of T1.
Interestingly, a similar effect of the presence of H-bond to the sulfur ligand was also
observed by pulse radiolysis on the transient P1, formed following the release of H2O2 from
the active site and associated with Fe3+-OH/Fe3+-OH2 species in acid-base equilibrium [19].
The data showed that the I118A, D and S mutations induced an increase of the apparent pKa
value of P1 by two pH units (from 7.0 to 9.1, Figures 6 and S8), suggesting that removal or
weakening of an H-bond to the sulfur ligand in the I118 mutants induces a stabilisation of the
Fe3+-OH2 species compared to the Fe3+-OH one. Again, and similarly to what was described
for the Fe2+-OO● species, this supports a trans electronic effect of the sulfur ligand on the pKa
of the Fe3+-OH/Fe3+-OH2 species, which is modulated by the H-bond on this ligand.
Hence, both theoretical and experimental observations support the hypothesis that the
presence of H-bonds toward the sulfur ligand of the active site of SOR disfavors the
protonation of both the superoxide adduct of the Fe2+-O-O● intermediate, and the OH adduct
of the Fe3+-OH transient, by decreasing their pKa value.

27

SOR active site finely tunes the strength of the Fe-S(Cys) bond in SOR by opposite effects
In a previous study, the E114A mutation, which cancels a dipolar interaction between the
carboxylic side chain of this buried residue with the Fe-S(Cys) bond, was shown to weaken
the Fe-S(Cys) bond [23]. In addition, as previously reported in [23] and confirmed here using
conditions where no photochemical processes occurred during the pulse radiolysis
experiments [18, 19], the E114A mutation was shown to induce a decrease of the pKa value of
the T1 intermediate, which was directly associated with the weakening of the Fe-S(Cys) bond.
Thus, the E114 and I118 mutants have opposite effects of the pKa of the T1 intermediate,
which can be directly associated to their opposite effect on the strength of the Fe-S(Cys)
bond.
Altogether, these results demonstrated that in SOR, the pKa of the first reaction
intermediate T1 is finely tuned through a tight control of the strength of Fe-S(Cys) bond. This
fine tuning is achieved by a combination of opposite effects on the strength of Fe-S(Cys)
bond, resulting at least from two different types of interactions: a dipolar interaction with the
E114 carboxylic side chain, and a H-bond between the I118 NH amide group and the sulfur
ligand.
Such a tight control of the rate of protonation of T1 to form the Fe3+-OOH species is
rather surprising at first glance. In fact, for efficient catalysis, one could expect a fastest
protonation rate as possible. This might suggest that a too fast formation of the Fe3+-OOH
species could be somehow detrimental for the SOR activity. Our recent studies underlined
that the control of the evolution of the Fe3+-OOH intermediate is one of the key features of the
SOR activity [14, 19]. In particular, K48, which allows the specific protonation of the
proximal oxygen of the Fe3+-OOH intermediate, was shown to play an essential role in the
formation of the reaction product H2O2. Otherwise, in the absence of such a specific
protonation process, the O-O bond of the Fe3+-OOH intermediate is cleaved to form a high

28

valent iron-oxo species [19]. It is thus conceivable that the control of the rate of protonation
of T1 by the second coordination sphere residues could favour the correct positioning of K48
toward the proximal oxygen of the Fe3+-OOH species. Such hypothesis is supported by the
fact that K48 can adopt different conformations around the Fe3+-OOH species, as observed in
the different X-ray structures of this intermediate trapped in a SOR crystal [14]. Any
impairment of this specific protonation process due to a bad positioning of the K48 side chain
might promote the formation of an iron -oxo species, as supported by our studies on the K48I
SOR mutant [19]. The ability of the I118 SOR mutants to favour the formation of an iron-oxo
species in their active sites is currently under investigation.

SCHEME 1. Mechanism for the reaction of the SOR from D. baarsii with O2●-, as proposed
in [19]. The first reaction intermediate, T1, presents a broad absorption band centred at 600
nm (ε = 2.5 M-1 cm-1) and was proposed to be a ferrous iron-superoxo species (Fe2+-OO●)
[19]. The second reaction intermediate, T1’, a ferric iron-hydroperoxo species, was not
experimentally observed, but was deduced from studies on the reactivity of the K48I SOR
mutant with O2●- [19] and from the crystal structures of iron-hydroperoxide species trapped in
the active site of SOR [14]
