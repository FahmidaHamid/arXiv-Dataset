Abstract
In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) clinical trials, the assessment
of treatment efficacy essentially relies on the time-to-death and the kinetics of prostatespecific antigen (PSA). Joint modelling has been increasingly used to characterize the
relationship between a time-to-event and a biomarker kinetics but numerical difficulties
often limit this approach to linear models. Here we evaluated by simulation the capability
of a new feature of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm in
Monolix to estimate the parameters of a joint model where PSA kinetics was defined by a
mechanistic nonlinear mixed-effect model. The design of the study and the parameter
values were inspired from one arm of a clinical trial. Increasingly high levels of association
between PSA and survival were considered and results were compared with those found
using two simplified alternatives to joint model, a two-stage and a joint sequential model.
We found that joint model allowed for a precise estimation of all longitudinal and survival
parameters. In particular the effect of PSA kinetics on survival could be precisely
estimated, regardless of the strength of the association. In contrast, both simplified
approaches led to bias on longitudinal parameters and two-stage model systematically
underestimated the effect of PSA kinetics on survival.
In summary we showed that joint model can be used to characterize the relationship
between a nonlinear kinetics and survival. This opens the way for the use of more complex
and physiological models to improve treatment evaluation and prediction in oncology.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and is responsible
for about 300 000 deaths worldwide every year [1]. Although treatment can be effective,
a number of factors, such as resistance or delayed treatment (4% of cancer have
metastasized at diagnosis [2]) considerably worsen the treatment outcome. In the case of
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the evaluation of chemotherapy
efficacy primarily relies on the overall survival [3] and is complemented by the analysis of
the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). Although countless studies have explored the
relationship between different PSA kinetic parameters (such as doubling time or time to
nadir) and survival, the choice of a clearly-defined parameter remains controversial.
The lack of consensus on how to use PSA kinetics is exacerbated by the difficulty to
properly handle PSA kinetics and the time-to-event (time-to-death or dropout) in statistical
models. Several methods have been proposed in the literature. The simplest one is to
plug the individual PSA kinetic parameters into a survival model [4]. However the fact that
these parameters are often not directly observed from the data makes this approach error
prone. A second approach is to use a model to describe the entire PSA kinetics using
mixed-effect models to precisely account for between-subjects variability, and then to plug
individual model predictions as covariates in a survival model [5,6]. However this method,
called in the following “two-stage” approach, is prone to bias because it does not take into
account the relationship between the marker’s kinetic and the time-to-event and the
uncertainty in the individual model predictions [7]. In order to eliminate the bias found in
the two-stage approach, one can use models which simultaneously, or “jointly”, handle
longitudinal and time-to-event data [7–13]. For the latter, one can either aim to estimate
all parameters simultaneously (“joint” model) or in a sequential manner (“joint sequential”
model), as it has been suggested in the pharmacometric field [14].
The main challenge in using joint model is the numerical complexity involved by the
calculation and the maximization of the likelihood. This difficulty can be circumvented by
using a linear model for the PSA kinetics as implemented in the large majority of published

3

models [7,15] or softwares [16]. However this precludes the use of physiologically more
accurate models for PSA kinetics which are in essence nonlinear.
In the last years, pharmacometric softwares have addressed the need for joint model
when the longitudinal model is defined by a nonlinear mixed-effect model (NLMEM). This
approach was firstly implemented in NONMEM using a Laplacian approximation of the
likelihood and was essentially used to account for informative dropouts [17,18]. Recently
the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (SAEM) algorithm, a method
relying on an “exact” calculation of the likelihood, was extended to include time-to-event
data [19,20] in Monolix and NONMEM.
Here we evaluated the benefit of joint models using the SAEM algorithm for characterizing
the relationship between survival and a biomarker having a non-linear kinetics. We
compared by simulation the precision and the type 1 error of longitudinal and survival
parameters obtained using a joint, a joint sequential and a two-stage model in the context
of a clinical study in mCRPC according to the strength of the association between PSA
kinetics and survival.

Models and notations
A Mechanistic model for PSA kinetics
In absence of treatment we assume that prostatic cells, C (mL-1), proliferate with rate r
(day-1) and are eliminated with rate d (day-1). PSA (ng.mL-1) is secreted with a production
rate p (ng.day-1) and cleared from the blood with rate δ (day-1). We suppose that a
chemotherapy for mCRPC acts by blocking cell proliferation with time-varying
effectiveness, e(t), and hence the proliferation rate under treatment is given by

Because only 4 parameters can be identified from Eq. 3 ,we fixed d to 0.046 day-1 ,
corresponding to a half-life of tumor cells of 15 days, consistent with an apoptotic index of
5% in metastatic prostate cancer [21]. Moreover we fixed δ to 0.23 day-1, corresponding
to a PSA half-life in blood of about 3 days [22]. Thus PSA kinetics was defined by the
vector parameter ψ={r, PSA0, ε and Tesc}.

Statistical model for PSA measurements
Let yij denote the jth longitudinal measurement of log(PSA+1) for the individual i at time tij,
where i=1, …, N, j=1, …, ni, N is the number of subjects and ni the number of
measurements in subject i. The nonlinear mixed-effect model (NLMEM) for PSA is defined
as follows:
@AB = log

AB , ,A

+1 +F

AB

(4),

where PSA is given by the formula (3), ψi is the vector of the individual parameters and eij
the residual error which follows a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance
1. The vector of the individual parameters ψi is decomposed as fixed effects µ={r, PSA0,
ε, Tesc} representing median effects of the population and random effects ηi specific for
each individual. It is assumed that ηi∼N(0, Ω) with Ω the variance-covariance matrix. In
5

this work, Ω is supposed to be diagonal. Each diagonal element ωq2 represents the
variance of the qth component of the random effect vector ηi. We assumed log-normal
distribution for r, PSA0 and Tesc:

log ψH,A = log IH + ηH,A

and logit-normal distribution for ε:
KLM

A

= KLM

μ0 + η0,A with KLM

O = log	P

Q

R for 0<x<1.

The population parameters vector of PSA noted θl is composed of {µ, Ω, σ}.

Statistical model for survival
Let Xi denote the time to event and Ci the censoring time for the ith subject. Survival data

(Ti, δi) are observed in all individuals, where Ti=min(Xi, Ci) and δT = 1, if	XT ≤

CT , 0	otherwise. For the event process, we used a hazard function of the form:

ℎA |

, ,A

= ℎ&

exp c

, ,A

(5)

where the baseline hazard function, h0, is a Weibull hazard function ℎ&

= P R
d

e e

. The

parameter β measures the strength of the association between the PSA kinetics and the

risk of death. If β=0, the survival process is independent on the PSA evolution and survival
data can be fitted by a Weibull model without adjusting for PSA. If β≠0, the survival
process depends on the PSA kinetics. The survival parameters to estimate are θs={λ, k,
β}.

Joint model
Joint models assume conditional independence: given the random effects ηi, longitudinal

measurements and survival events are independent. All parameters, f = {fh , f# } are

simultaneously estimated. Thus the joint log-likelihood for subject i can be written as follow
[23]:
KA f = log	j

Two-stage model
In order to simplify the heavy calculations involved by Equation (6) one may also use a
two-stage approach. In the first step PSA kinetics parameters (θl) are estimated assuming
complete independence of PSA kinetic and survival and the Empirical Bayes Estimates
(EBEs), defined as the mode of the conditional distribution

Joint sequential model
In order to reduce the number of parameters to estimate in Equation (6), an alternative
consists in first estimating population PSA kinetic parameters, as done in the two-stage
model, and then estimating parameters related to survival (θs) fixing the all population
PSA parameters (θl) in Equation (6) to the values obtained at the previous stage. This
method, inspired from the “Population PK parameter and individual PK data” for the
combined analysis of PKPD data, has been shown to limit the bias compared to two-stage
approach [14].

Simulation study
Design
Simulation setting was inspired by one arm of a phase III study of clinical development of
chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer [3]. M=100 datasets with N=500 patients
were simulated with PSA measurements every 3 weeks for 2 years (i.e., the last possible
measurement time was at t=735 days), leading to a maximum of 36 observations per
patient (Table I). Follow-up was censored at t=735 and no other mechanism than death
was considered for dropout. For the simulation of the time to death, k was fixed to 1.5,
and 3 values for β were considered: 0, 0.005 and 0.02, corresponding to ‘no link’, ‘low link’
and ‘high link’ between PSA kinetics and survival, respectively. In order to maintain a
comparable amount of PSA measurements across scenarios, λ was determined in each
scenario such that the probability of survival at the end of the follow-up (i.e., 735 days)
was equal to 25% with the median PSA kinetic parameters (Table I), leading to λ=580,
765 and 2150 in scenarios ‘No link’, ‘Low link’ and ‘High link’, respectively (Table II). Lastly,
we evaluated the effects of having both a large baseline risk and a strong effect of PSA
kinetics by setting β=0.02 and λ=580 in the scenario called ‘Short survival’. Figure 2 shows
the survival functions for these 4 scenarios for the “median patient”, i.e., a virtual patient
having PSA kinetic parameters equal to the median values in the population.
In order to take into account the effect of withdrawals from PSA follow-up, we also
explored additional scenarios where PSA and/or vital status were censored in case of
PSA progression defined as an increase of 25% above the nadir and of at least 2 ng/ml
compared to nadir (see supplementary file 1).
All simulations were carried out with the R software version 3.0.1 [24].

Parameter estimation
The estimation of two-stage, joint sequential and joint models was performed for each
dataset and each scenario using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization
(SAEM) algorithm in the software Monolix version 4.2.2.

8

The initial values of the parameters were those used for the scenario ‘No link’. Minus twice
log-likelihood (-2LL) was calculated by Importance Sampling, fixing the Monte-Carlo sizes
to achieve a sufficient level of precision for Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) to 100 000 MonteCarlo sizes for the scenario ‘No link’, 20 000 for the other scenarios in joint model and
2 000 in two-stage model.
SAEM was run using 1 chain and we verified that using 3 chains, as suggested in a related
context [19], gave similar results. CPU (Central Processing Unit) times for parameters
estimations and -2LL estimations were recorded on a i7 64bits 3.33GHz.

are the true and estimated parameters, respectively, for dataset m, m=1…M. Boxplots of
the REEs with the 10% and 90% percentiles were plotted. When β=0 (scenario ‘No link’),
the boxplot of the absolute estimation error, c•d , with the 10% and 90% percentiles were

plotted .

The type 1 error and power were calculated as the proportion among the M datasets for
which LRT (called in the following “uncorrected LRT”) led to reject the null hypothesis H0:
β=0. The type 1 error was evaluated in the scenario ‘No link’ and the power was calculated
for the 3 other scenarios. The significance level of the tests α for the observed type 1 error
was fixed to 0.05, leading to a 95% prediction interval for 100 replicates equal to [0.7%9.3%].
In some cases the estimation of -2LL, which relies on a stochastic approximation, was
associated with a non-negligible standard error. Because this can lead to an inflation of
the type 1 error, we also evaluated a “corrected LRT”. In this test H0 was rejected if

Results
Simulated data
Figure 3 shows the spaghetti-plots along with the Kaplan-Meier curves of one typical
dataset for each of the 4 scenarios. Because the scenario ‘No link’ assumes that death
does not depend on PSA kinetics, PSA rebound after loss of treatment efficacy (at time
Tesc) was more frequently observed than in the 3 other scenarios. As expected (see
methods), the numbers of measurements in the first 3 scenarios were largely similar
(Table III). In the last scenario where both the baseline hazard function and the effect of
PSA kinetics were large, early events frequently occurred and the total amount of PSA
data was much smaller.

Estimation performance
No bias was observed in the scenario ‘No link’ regardless of the approach. In the twostage approach, increasing effect of PSA on survival led to higher levels of bias (Figures
4 and 5). In particular there was a systematical underestimation of the PSA effect on
survival with median (Q1;Q3) REE for β equal to -8.4% (-12.6 ; -4.1), -14.8% (-18.9 ; 10.2) and -9.1% (-16.7 ; -5.7) in scenarios ‘Low link’, ‘High link’ and ‘Short survival’,
respectively. The bias was corrected by using joint sequential models or joint models, with
median (Q1;Q3) REE for β of 0.005% (-3.6 ; 5.3), -0.6% (-3.3 ; 2.9) and 0.03% (-4.8 ; 5.7)
in scenarios ‘Low link’, ‘High link’ and ‘Short survival’, respectively for this latter method.
Although the three approaches led to low REEs for the almost all parameters of PSA
kinetics (Figure 4), a bias was observed for the proliferation rate of tumor cells, r, with
median (Q1;Q3) REE equal to -0.4% (-0.7 ; -0.05), -0.8% (-1.0 ; -0.5) and -1.2% (-1.8 ; 0.7) in scenarios ‘Low link’, ‘High link’ and ‘Short survival’, respectively, when using the
two-stage or joint sequential approach. Here as well, the bias was largely reduced when
using a joint model, with median (Q1;Q3) REE for r equal to 0.01% (-0.4 ; 0.3), -0.004%
(-0.3 ; 0.2) and -0.08% (-0.6 ; 0.5), in scenarios ‘Low link’, ‘High link’ and ‘Short survival’,
10

respectively. Of note large REE were found for the parameters λ and k (|REE|>30%) in
the scenario ‘High link’ when using joint and joint sequential models, due to the presence
of a local extremum of the likelihood function.
Lastly we also considered additional scenarios where PSA data and/or vital status were
censored in case of PSA increase (see supplementary file 1). Although the precision of
the parameter estimates was deterioriated due to the reduction in the amount of data
available no substantial bias in the PSA kinetic parameters was found. However bias was
found in survival related parameters, in particular when both PSA and vital status were
censored after disease progression and this bias systematically led to an overestimation
of the hazard function.

Test performance
The uncorrected LRT led to a type 1 error of 21%, 9% and 12% for the joint model, the
joint sequential model and the two-stage model, respectively, i.e., outside the 95%
prediction interval ([0.7%-9.3%] for 100 replicates). The use of a corrected LRT (see
methods) led to a smaller type 1 error of 4%, 3% and 12% for the joint model, the joint
sequential model and the two-stage model, respectively. The reason why the type 1 error
for the two stage model with or without correction were similar is due to the fact that the
standard error of -2LL were negligible with this model (<10-4). For the scenarios with β≠0,
the power was 100% with all three models, regardless of the correction.

Computation time
Mean CPU times for the simultaneous estimation of the 12 parameters using joint model
were about 5 times larger than the total CPU times using two-stage model (70 vs 14
minutes) and about 1.2 times larger than the total CPU times using joint sequential model
(70 vs 59 minutes), ignoring time for specific data manipulation required for setting the
two-stage and joint sequential approaches. Mean CPU times for the -2LL estimation using
joint model (respectively joint sequential model) and 100,000 chains was about 3.1
(respectively 3.6) times larger than when using the joint approach and 20,000 chains (264
vs 86 minutes (respectively 207 vs 57 minutes)) but led to a mean se-2LL(H1) of 1.96 vs
5.14 (respectively 2.40 vs 5.90).

Discussion
Numerical complexities have long limited the use of joint models to longitudinal processes
defined by linear mixed-effect models [7,10,15]. Here we evaluated by simulation, in the
context of PSA and survival in metastatic prostate cancer, the capability of a new feature
of the Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization algorithm in Monolix to
estimate the parameters of a joint model where the longitudinal process was defined by a
nonlinear model. And we compared the results to two simplified approaches, two-stage
and joint sequential models.
We found that joint model provided unbiased parameters of both longitudinal and survival
processes. In contrast, the use of a two-stage model [5,25] led to large biases when PSA
kinetics and survival were linked. In particular, the impact of the biomarker kinetics on the
survival, as measured by the link parameter β, was systematically underestimated,
consistent with results found in linear mixed-effect model [8,9]. Beside survival
parameters, a bias on the tumor proliferation rate, r, which is the driving force for the
increase in PSA, was also observed in scenarios with β≠0. The fact that no such bias
occurred when using joint model shows that the simultaneous estimation of the hazard
function also improved the estimation of the longitudinal parameters. Moreover, a twostage approach led to an inflation of type 1 error (i.e., conclude to an effect of PSA on
survival while there is none) which could be explained by the shrinkage of the EBEs in
patients with short survival [26]. By construction the joint sequential model led to the same
biases on PSA longitudinal parameters than the two-stage model, but the estimation of
survival parameters was close to that obtained with the joint model. This, therefore,
suggests that joint sequential model could be a relevant approach when joint model
cannot be performed.
In spite of the increasing numerical capability, the likelihood of joint models remains
particularly complex to calculate. Here we reported that the likelihood was estimated with
a relatively large uncertainty. Increasing the Monte-Carlo sizes led to smaller standard
errors of the likelihood but considerably increased the computation time. The impact of
this error on type 1 error was in part accounted by using a corrected likelihood ratio test
(LRT). However more studies will be needed to precisely determine when this correction
12

is necessary and whether it can be improved. Here for instance the corrected rejection
region did not take into account the covariance between the likelihood calculated under
the null and alternative hypotheses. Although the Wald test may be an alternative, we
found here that standard errors of the estimates tended to be smaller than the Root MeanSquared Errors (RMSE), indicating a potential underestimation of the standard errors.
Furthermore, and in spite of the stochastic algorithm, the estimation of parameters related
to survival was complicated in some cases by the existence of local extremum of the
likelihood function. This stresses the need, in practice, to perform several runs of likelihood
maximization using different initial values.
The main advantage of nonlinear models is the possibility to develop physiological models
based on nonlinear differential equations, which naturally integrate the correlations
between the different biomarkers. In this study, we used a rather simple model where the
treatment effectiveness was piecewise constant, which allowed us to derive a
biexponential analytical solution for the PSA kinetics. However this model may clearly be
over-simplistic and more complex models will be needed that rely on several markers,
such as tumor size or drug pharmacokinetics. The facilitated use of these models via joint
models holds the promise that the determinants of survival may be much better
characterized [20].
Regarding the survival model, we restricted here to a rather simple fully parametric model,
where the baseline hazard function was a Weibull model [27] and the hazard function was
related to the current PSA values. In practice complex survival models could be evaluated
and standard tools for model selection (e.g., AIC or BIC) could be used to evaluate the
effect of various transformations of the biomarker, such as the derivative or the cumulative
value of PSA. Lastly with a fully parametric model the prediction and the simulation of the
individual hazard function can easily be performed, making possible to guide treatment
adaptation in a dynamic manner [28].

Conclusion
SAEM algorithm implemented in Monolix was shown to provide precise estimates for joint
models where the longitudinal model was defined by a non-linear mixed-effect model. This
13

opens the way for a more systematic use of joint models and a better understanding of
the relationship between biomarker kinetics and survival, especially in the field of
metastatic cancer where survival and non-linear biomarker kinetics are intrinsically
related.

Supplementary file 1: Impact of withdrawal from PSA follow-up on
joint estimation

It is frequent in clinical trial protocols that treatment is stopped when a disease progression
(increase in PSA or tumor size, adverse events) is observed. When treatment is stopped, the
patient may drop out of the study. Although the vital status may continue to be collected, the
PSA measurements are no longer recorded in the study.

Simulation framework
For the sake of simplicity we consider here that a disease progression was only due to a PSA
progression defined as an increase of 25% above the nadir and of at least 2 ng/ml compared
to nadir. PSA data were removed accordingly in all datasets of the scenarios ‘No link’, ‘High
link’ and ‘Short survival’ (see main analysis), leading to a dramatic decrease in the number of
PSA measurements (Table S1).
In order to assess the impact of withdrawal data, two cases were considered:
The vital status is known at the end of the study (scenarios ‘Withdrawal’)
The vital status is censored at the time of the disease progression (scenarios
‘Withdrawal + censor’)

Thus, in the first case the number of observed deaths is equal to that observed in the main
analysis, and in the second case the number of observed deaths is much smaller that observed
in the main analysis (scenarios ‘No withdrawal’). This results in much larger confidence interval
for the Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure S1).

Results
The variability of the parameter estimates increases when patients withdrawal from PSA
follow-up (Figures S2 and S3) which was expected because there is a smaller number of PSA
measurements. PSA kinetic parameters (Figure S2) were not affected by withdrawal, with or
without censor of vital status. However all three parameters related to survival were estimated
with a bias in case of censor of survival (Figure S3): β and k tend to be overestimated while λ

23

tends to be underestimated. These trends led to an overestimation of the hazard function and
hence an underestimation of the survival function.

Conclusion
Drop out caused by predefined levels of PSA progression does not affect the estimation of the
parameters associated with PSA kinetics.
Regarding survival parameters, a bias towards an overestimation of the hazard function may
occur, in particular when not only PSA but also the vital status is not collected after disease
progression.
