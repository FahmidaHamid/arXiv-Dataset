The dynamics of well-mixed biological populations is usually studied by mean-field methods and
weak-noise expansions. Similar methods have been applied also in spatially extended problems,
relying on the fact that these populations are organized in colonies with a large local density of
individuals. We provide a counterexample discussing a one-dimensional neutral population with
negative frequency-dependent selection. The system exhibits a continuous phase transition between
genetic fixation and coexistence unexpected from weak-noise arguments. We show that the behavior
is a non-perturbative effect of the internal noise that is amplified by presence of spatial correlations
(strong-noise regime).

The dynamics of biological populations is traditionally
modeled using systems of partial differential equations
for a set of density fields, representing the (local) concentrations of species, resources, genetic traits, etc. [1].
Despite the success of deterministic theories, the fate of
real populations is often determined by purely stochastic
forces induced by the discreteness of individuals (internal noise). In well-mixed populations, the internal noise
is a finite-size effect that can be studied using system’s
size expansions [2]. Even though the noise has macroscopic effects, including gigantic oscillations and unexpected extinction events [3], these results are obtained
in a weak-noise regime accessible from the deterministic mean-field description by perturbative methods. In
spatially extended populations, on the contrary, correlations induced by spatial constraints can enhance the effects of the internal noise and induce phenomena that are
completely unpredictable by means of perturbative methods. Spatial populations are usually studied using “patch
dynamics” [4] or “stepping stone models” [5], in which
colonies composed of a number (Ω  1) of individuals
occupy the sites of a lattice and interact by migration.
All processes inside the colonies (or demes) and between
them are stochastic, therefore as long as their internal
population is finite and mobility is low, the macroscopic
behavior is affected by noise. Unlike the well-mixed case,
these phenomena can persist also in the limit of infinitely
large systems. The simplest situation occurs in neutral
theories [6], in which purely stochastic genetic (ecological) drift is the only force determining the evolution of the
whole population, favoring local exclusion and fixation.
In low dimensional systems, genetic drift competes with
diffusion and migration processes that instead promote
genetic mixing [5]. When the microscopic interactions

are linear, like in the voter model or in the Moran process, changing microscopic details of the model (e.g. Ω)
only produces a temporal rescale of the dynamics. In the
presence of non-linear interactions, instead, the continuum theory may depend on the microscopic model and
on the way in which the infinite size limit is taken.
In this Letter we address this problem considering the
effects of negative frequency-dependent selection (NFS) in
a neutral population composed of two competing genetic
types. In a regime of strong competition, individuals carrying a rare phenotype are able to exploit new resources,
survive predation or better adapt to an evolving environment, gaining a fitness advantage. This advantage
is transient, because it declines when the phenotype becomes more common. In this sense, it is a special form of
Darwinian selection that, within the framework of neutral theories, favors advantageous mutations and maintains balanced polymorphism and biodiversity. Negative
frequency-dependent selection has been recently observed
experimentally in natural populations both at the phenotype and genetic level [7]. While NFS is enough to
maintain a stable coexistence of different genetic types in
well-mixed populations, we show that in one-dimensional
systems the competition between NFS and genetic drift
leads to an unexpected continuous phase transition between genetic fixation and coexistence.
We consider an idealized population of identical
haploid individuals that differ in a single gene, i.e. at a
given locus they have either allele A or B. According to
Kimura’s stepping stone models [5], the population is
spatially organized in “demes”, i.e. islands or colonies
that occupy the sites of a d-dimensional lattice. Each
deme contains a fixed number Ω of individuals. The
evolution of the population is governed by three stochas-

Following standard stochastic methods [2, 3], we write

ni = Ωfi + O(Ω 2 ), and exploiting the fact that frequencies change of O(Ω−1 ) in a time step ∆t, we expand
the master equation in powers of 1/Ω. In the limit of
large Ω, after temporal rescaling t = Ω∆t, we obtain a
Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding non-linear
Langevin equation for the local frequency fi of type A.
We take a naive continuum limit sending the lattice spacing a to zero and keeping constant the diffusion coefficient
D = a2 λD . The effective continuum equation for f (x, t)
reads

where ν = λS , σ 2 = (λM + λS )/Ω and η(x, t) is a delta
correlated gaussian noise (hη(x, t)η(x0 , t0 )i = δ(t−t0 )δ(x−
x0 )). The parameter ν can be made negative admitting
also positive frequency-dependent selection. In this case,
the two symmetric absorbing states at f = 0, 1 are attractive and the system fixates to one of them after a
coarsening process. For ν > 0 instead, the attractive
fixed point is the active homogeneous equilibrium state
at feq = 1/2, corresponding to a completely mixed coexistence. The fluctuations around feq are gaussian with
amplitude O(Ω−1/2 ). The mean-field picture, with a discontinuous phase transition at νc = 0, is not correct in
one dimension. This is evident from the results of numerical simulations in Fig.1, where we plot the average

tic processes: 1) a migration process (at rate λD ) that
consists in the pair-exchange of individuals between
neighboring demes; 2) a Moran process (at rate λM ) in
which an individual (either of type A or B) is chosen for
reproduction and her offspring replaces another random
individual of the same deme; 3) a process of frequencydependent selection at rate λS . The latter consists in
randomly choosing an individual together with other two
individuals of the same deme. The first individual is replaced by a new one carrying the less/most popular allele
appearing in the triple. In the case of NFS, less frequent
alleles are selected. The state of the system is univocally

FIG. 1: Time dependence of the average heterozygosity h̄(t)
for a system of size L = 103 , λD = 0.2, λM = 1, and different
values of λS . (a) Ω = 5 and λS = 0, 0.2, 0.22, 0.25, 0.3. (b)

state and h̄ eventually vanishes. However, the temporal
behavior of h̄ clearly shows the existence of a phase transition between fixation and coexistence at some non-zero
λS (i.e. νc > 0). For Ω = 5 the coexistence phase develops gradually, indicating the continuous nature of the
transition. Increasing Ω (Fig.1b), the critical point moves
closer to zero, and the transition becomes more abrupt.
In this case, numerical results do not allow to distinguish
between continuous or discontinuous behavior. A discontinuous transition is recovered for sure in the thermodynamic limit, at least if we first take Ω → ∞ and then
L → ∞ limits. An argument in favor of the continuous
character of the transition is based on Hinrichsen’s conjecture about the impossibility of first-order transitions in
non-equilibrium 1d systems with short-range interactions
[8]. Indeed, in the absence of surface tension (d = 1), a
small droplet of the absorbing phase can always grow
by diffusion of the boundaries and eventually destabilize
the fluctuating active equilibrium. For Ω < ∞, the nucleation rate R` of a droplet of size ` of the absorbing phase
out of the homogeneous equilibrium is small but finite
S
(R` ≈ e−cΩ` with c ∝ λMλ+λ
). Hence, if the only proS
cesses into play were nucleation and diffusion, the absorbing phase would always dominate. It is thus necessary to
have a different mechanism for the emergence of coexistence. According to this argument, the Fokker-Planck
approach and small-noise expansions are not valid even in
the large Ω limit, calling for a different “non-perturbative
approach”. Interestingly, a non-perturbative renormalization group study of Eq.2 was done in [9] showing that,
for d < d0c ≈ 4/3, the critical behavior of the model is
controlled by a non-Gaussian fixed point of the RG flow.
In fact, [9] suggests the existence of a continuous phase
transition at νc > 0 that cannot be found by expanding

3
in 1/Ω around the mean-field theory.
A way to confirm and understand this picture is that of
studying a model with only one individual per site and interactions with neighboring sites. The migration process
is unchanged and consists of exchanging two neighboring
individuals with rate λD . The Moran process is reduced
to a voter-like move between nearest neighbors. With
rate λM , an individual dies and is immediately replaced
by an offspring of a randomly selected neighbor. We
adopt a spatial version of NFS recently proposed in theoretical ecology to model interspecies competition [10].
Two neighboring individuals that are different compete
for reproduction: with a rate λS we randomly select a

neighbor of the two to be replaced with the less common type among the three selected individuals. In the
absence of diffusion (λD = 0), the one-dimensional dynamics can be mapped on that of branching-annihilation
random walks with even offsprings (BARWe) [11] or it
can be analyzed with approximated techniques developed
for binary spin systems. After the mapping σi = 2ni − 1,
the transition rates take the simple form wM (σi → −σi )

where DM = a2 λM and DS (h̄) = a2 λS h̄(x, t). The effective diffusion terms generated in the continuum limit
account for the random walk of domain walls induced
by both Moran and NFS moves. The coefficient DS (h̄)
depends linearly on the local heterozygosity h̄(x, t) as
required by NFS microscopic rule. Eqs. 5-6 are deterministic and describe the average behavior of the system.
A single realization of the process would also present a
noise term with two homogeneous absorbing states at
f (x, t) = 0, 1 ∀x. The stationary state is obtained solving Eqs. 5-6 with the assumption of spatial translation
invariance, f¯(x) ≈ f¯ and h̄(x) ≈ h̄. There are two stationary solutions of Eq.5 depending on the ratio λS /λM .
A continuous phase transition separates the absorbing
phase (h̄ = 0) where a unique species survives from an
active phase of non-trivial coexistence (h̄ = λ−1
2λ with
λ = λS /λM ). The theoretical curve h̄(λS /λM ) is plotted

in Fig.2 (full line) together with the results of numerical simulations (points). For λD = 0 the agreement is
very good, although in the analytical calculation we neglected the effects of the self-generated spatial diffusion
that could be responsible of the renormalization of both
the critical point and the critical exponents. To explore
the dynamics in the absorbing phase, we prepared the
population of size L = 104 in a completely mixed configuration (f¯ = 0, h̄ = 1/2) and we studied the temporal behavior of the average cluster size (of type A or

Some progress can be done by assuming the Kirkwood
approximation, i.e. factorizing three-sites and four-sites
quantites as products of lower order ones [12]. For convenience we define the average frequency of type A as
f¯i = (1 + hσi i)/2 and the average local heterozygosity
h̄i = (1 − hσi σi+1 i)/2. Taking the continuum limit, and
neglecting higher order contributions, we get equations
for f¯(x, t) and h̄(x, t),

B) until fixation. Clusters growth is evident from the
time-oriented snapshots in Fig. 3a. The average domain
length is roughly `(t) ∝ 1/h̄(t), therefore the behavior
Eq. 6 provides information on the coarsening exponent.
In the absorbing region, we can neglect the non-linear
terms in the r.h.s. and solving the linear equation we obtain a power law decay h̄(t) ∝ t−1/2 . This is confirmed
by the numerical results shown in Fig. 3b. The typical domain length `(t) thus grows in time as `(t) ∼ t1/2 ,
which is the same behavior as the pure voter model (i.e.
λS = 0). This law is not modified by small diffusion,
but the case Ω > 1 requires further investigation (see
Fig.1). In the active phase, the system shows local clustering up to a characteristic length scale ` ∝ 1/h̄, that
is reduced by increasing λS from just above criticality
(Fig.3c) to the bulk of the coexistence region (Fig.3d).
Comparing snapshots in Figs.3c-3d with that in Fig.3a,
we notice a much higher local volatility of patches and
domain walls, a signature of increasing genetic mixing.
The addition of a small migration rate does not change
the qualitative picture observed for λD = 0. However, increasing diffusion favors local mixing of individuals and
acts against genetic drift. This is confirmed by numerical simulations reported in Fig.2, that show the critical
point moving towards zero and the curve of h̄ becoming
steeper for increasing values of λD . In the limit λD → ∞
the constraints imposed by the one-dimensional geometry
are eliminated leaving a completely well-mixed population that should undergo a first-order transition at zero
NFS as predicted by the mean-field theory.
In conclusion, negative frequency-dependent selection
is a major force for coexistence, but spatial constraints

tend to amplify the effects of genetic drift promoting fixation. The outcome of this competition is a phase transition between a monomorphic and a polymorphic phase.
In one spatial dimension, the nature of the phase transition critically depends on the number Ω of individuals
per lattice site and on their mobility λD . In the infinite size limit, any finite value of Ω generates a dynamics
that cannot be obtained from the mean-field by means
of perturbative approaches (strong noise regime). Recent works have shown that the strong noise limit can be
important in the case of weak directional selection, therefore the present results could be applied to a large class
of phenomena occurring at the one-dimensional fronts of
expanding populations, such as Fisher’s waves [13] and
“gene surfing” [14]. Negative frequency-dependent selection is also expected to play a role in plant communities
and marine ecosystems. It would be interesting to investigate whether one-dimensional structures such as valleys, riverbanks and seacoasts, could act as spatial bottlenecks promoting or impeding genetic variability even
in higher dimensional populations.
