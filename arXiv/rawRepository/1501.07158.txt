Review of Magnetic Shark Deterrents: Hypothetical
Mechanisms and Evidence for Selectivity

Abstract
Several papers published since 2006 describe effects of magnetic fields on elasmobranchs and
assess their utility in reducing negative interactions between sharks and humans, including
bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a single untested hypothesis regarding physical
mechanisms by which elasmobranchs detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful
consideration of magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field detection also has
support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly narrow focus of earlier papers on the
unsupported hypothesis that magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of
Lorenzini creates the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several teleosts, and is
supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present in many teleost species; therefore,
the possibility of induction based indirect magnetoreception should be considered. Finally,
experiments reported as demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents
suffer from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic detection in
any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies depends on both deterrent
effects in sharks and the absence of effects in target teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in
teleost species must be independently tested with adequate sample sizes.

1. Introduction and Background
Magnetoreception is the capability to detect a magnetic field and, in some cases, use it to guide
movement. Over the last century, it has been hypothesized and then supported experimentally
that many species have a magnetic sense. Evidence has been found to support magnetoreception
in certain species of bacteria, mollusks, insects, amphibians, birds, reptiles, mammals, and fish.
(Johnsen & Lohmann, 2004) In principle, the Earth’s magnetic field provides positional
information that may be used for orientation and navigation. There are geometric parameters
such as field intensity and inclination of field lines relative to Earth’s surface that vary with
location. Evidence has accumulated steadily that animals can derive positional information from
these parameters. (Kirschvink, 1989; Walker et al., 2003; Walker et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2012)

One group of animals that has been shown to exercise magnetoreception is elasmobranch fish,
including sharks and rays. Sharks are also part of a large group known as bycatch – marine
animals that are caught while fishing for another species. Shark bycatch contributes to
population declines and management difficulties, as well as inefficiency in commercial fisheries.
(Godin et al., 2013) Because high shark bycatch can result in bait loss, gear damage, and risks to
fishing crew, (Gilman et al., 2008) reducing shark interactions is a priority for fisheries
managers. There are various approaches to reducing shark interactions, but this review will focus
on magnetic deterrents and hypothetical sensory mechanisms, evidence for each possible
mechanism, and species selectivity relating to potential use of magnetic deterrents.
Several papers describe effects of magnetic fields on elasmobranchs and purport to assess their
utility in reducing negative interactions between sharks and humans. (Godin et al., 2013;
O’Connell et al., 2011; O’Connell et al., 2013; Tallack & Mandelman, 2009; Jordan et al., 2013;
Stoner & Kaimmer, 2008; Robbins et al., 2011) However, most of these papers discuss only a
single, untested hypothesis regarding magnetic field detection mechanisms in elasmobranchs,
consequently neglecting adequate consideration of magnetoreception in teleost fish. This
hypothesis focuses on electromagnetic induction with the ampullae of Lorenzini as the detection
organ and detecting induced electric fields as the mechanism. This creates the expectation that all
teleosts are insensitive to magnetic deterrents. Hypotheses should be tested explicitly without
relying on unverified theoretical extrapolations. Numerous experiments have given support to
electroreception in teleosts. (Northcutt et al., 1995; Modrell et al., 2011a ;
New,
1997;
Bodznick & Northcutt, 1981; Jorgensen, 2005) Several studies have also shown evidence of
direct magnetoreception through biogenic magnetite in teleosts and several elasmobranch
species, suggesting that due consideration should be given to alternate mechanistic hypotheses.
(Kirschvink et al., 2001; Johnsen & Lohmann, 2004; Walker et al., 2006; Eder et al., 2012) Thus,
further experiments are needed regarding magnetoreception through biogenic magnetite and
magnetoreception in teleosts.
2. Transduction Hypotheses
There are several hypotheses regarding mechanisms of magnetic reception in fish. One with
strong support is direct magnetic field detection, (Kirschvink et al., 2001; Johnsen & Lohmann,
2004) which asserts that direct detection is based on the magnetic mineral, magnetite (Fe 3O4).
(Walker et al., 2006) It proposes that fish use motion or torque from magnetite crystals to convert
magnetic field stimuli into mechanical signals that are detected by the nervous system.
(Kirschvink, 1989; Eder et al., 2012) These crystals are permanently magnetized bar magnets
that twist into alignment with an externally applied magnetic field if allowed to rotate freely. In
many fish, these are under 50 nm, with the exception of the spiny dogfish’s otolith, which is
larger.
A second hypothesis regarding magnetic reception is electromagnetic induction. (Johnsen &
Lohmann, 2004; Albert & Crampton, 2006) In general, a conductor moving in a magnetic field
or a magnet moving through a conducting medium (salt water) produces an induced electric
field. The induced electric field is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and to the
relative velocity between the conductor and the magnetic field. (Walker et al., 2003; Lohmann et
al., 2008) This hypothesis deals primarily with fish and requires fish with this sense to have an

electroreceptive organ system that detects an externally applied electric field. This electric field
may be created by a stationary magnetic field in a moving saltwater current. However, some
authors propose that the organism itself (and its sensory systems) complete the circuit. This view
favors the ampullae of Lorenzini as the sensory organ in elasmobranchs and various
electroreceptive organs in bony fish. (Johnsen & Lohmann, 2004; Gillis et al., 2012)
Chemical magnetoreception is a third hypothesis regarding magnetic reception but will not be
discussed further in this review because there is insufficient evidence that this is relevant in fish.
This hypothesis requires chemical reactions that are affected by magnetic fields comparable in
magnitude to the Earth's magnetic field (~ 50 gauss). No biological reactions have been
identified that completely fulfill the properties required. (Johnsen & Lohmann, 2004)
3. Evidence for Magnetoreception Mechanisms
3.1 Direct Magnetic Reception
Biogenetic magnetite has been shown to be present in several species of teleosts that demonstrate
magnetoreception including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus
albacares), chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
nerka). (Driebel et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1984; Kirschvink et al., 1985; Mann et al., 1988)
There is also compelling evidence for the presence of direct magnetoreception in swordfish
(Xiphias gladius), based on its ability to navigate long distances along a given compass heading
without any other plausible explanations for maintaining a given orientation. (Carey &
Robinson, 1981) Behavioral evidence for magnetoreception is present in the Japanese eel
(Anguilla japonica), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), zebrafish
(Danio rerio), Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), common carp (Cyprinus
carpio) and other species. (Nishi et al., 2004; Rommel & McCleave, 1973; Shcherbakov et al.,
2005; Hart et al., 2012)
With regard to direct magnetoreception in elasmobranch fish, there is evidence for direct
magnetoreception in scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and short-tailed stingray
(Dasyatis brevicaudata), which casts doubt on implicit suggestions that magnetic reception is
always mediated by electromagnetic induction through the ampullae of Lorenzini. (Klimley,
1993; Hodson, 2001) Magnetite has also been found in the stataconia of the spiny dogfish
(Squalus acanthias). (Hanson et al., 1990) Several authors have argued that electroreception as a
mechanism for detecting the earth's magnetic field would be inefficient because all
elasmobranchs in question lack structures of appropriately large size to achieve necessary
magnetic sensitivity. (Rosenblum et al., 1985; Semm & Beason, 1990; Klimley, 1993) Observed
behavior in sharks and rays also indicates that the primary purpose of electroreception is to
locate prey. (Hodson, 2001; Walker et al., 2003; Kirschvink et al., 2001) Based on the above
findings, Kirschvink, Walker, and Diebel (2001) concluded that experimental evidence rules out
electroreception as the basis of magnetoreception in elasmobranchs.
Several studies regarding magnetic reception in elasmobranch fish ascribe effects to indirect
magnetoreception without experimental evidence to rule out magnetite based magnetoreception.

It has been shown that many elasmobranch species have capability to detect magnetic fields.
This includes juvenile nurse sharks and lemon sharks, as well as many species of mature sharks.
(O’Connell et al., 2011; O’Connell et al., 2010) Further experimentation is needed in confirmed
cases of magnetoreception to determine the mechanism.
3.2 Magnetoreception by Electromagnetic Induction
A conductor moving in a magnetic field generates electric fields proportional to the magnetic
field strength and speed of motion. Thus, any electrosensitive organism can potentially detect a
magnetic field if the combination of speed and magnetic field strength creates a detectable
electric field. Speed can be generated by moving salt water (current), a moving magnet, or a
moving fish.
One hypothesis regarding electroreception in bony fish points to ampullary organs as the
mechanism. It is a long established observation that numerous species of bony fish possess
electroreceptive capabilities. (Kramer, 1996; Bretschneider & Peters, 1992; Albert & Crampton,
2006) Electroreceptors are housed in ampullary sense organs. (Jorgensen, 2005) They include
epidermal hair cell receptors, receptor organs in which hair cells extend into a fluid-filled lumen.
Ampullary receptor organs in non-elasmobranch fish differ in several ways from those of marine
elasmobranchs: the canals are shorter, there are fewer hair cells per organ, and there is usually
only a single afferent fiber from each organ. (Albert & Crampton, 2006) Non-teleost fish that
possess both ampullary organs and electroreceptive capabilities include paddlefish (Polyodon
spathula), Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), coelacanths (Latimeria chalumnae), and
various sturgeon species. Teleost fish that possess both ampullary organs and electroreceptive
capabilities include many species of catfish, African mormyriformes, and neotropical
gymnotiformes. (Bullock et al., 1983; Hopkins, 1995)
Bony fish may also sense electric fields by other mechanisms. Some fish use tuberous
electroreceptors to detect electric fields, including those generated by electrogenic fish. (Albert
& Crampton, 2006) Tuberous organs are similar to ampullary organs, with electrosensory hair
cells and a canal extending to a superficial pore. The core difference between tuberous and
ampullary organs is that in tuberous organs, the hair cells lie mostly within the organ lumen. The
electrosensory system of the lamprey consists of small swellings called end buds distributed on
the epidermal surface over the whole body. (Ronan, 1986)
Authors on elasmobranch electroreception hypothesize that the ampullae of Lorenzini serve as
the location of detection. (O’Connell et al., 2012; Albert & Crampton, 2006; Wueringer et al.,
2012; Johnson & Lohmann, 2004) In elasmobranchs, ampullary organs are clustered into
discrete regions on the head and pectoral fins, and their canals connect with pores distributed on
the surface of the skin. It is hypothesized that this organization allows ampullary electroreceptors
to detect potential differences between a common internal potential and the somatotopic charges
on the skin. (Bleckmann, 1994)
The findings of Bullock and Northcutt (1982) reveal the possibility that “electroreception might
turn up anywhere among hundreds of fish families, especially among teleosts … it will not

necessarily be homologous to previous known examples.” (Bullock, 1999) Electroreception and
insensitivity to the presence of permanent magnets should not be inferred for broad classes of
teleosts based on theoretical considerations or limited data since “most of the 30 orders of fishes
not known to have electroreception have probably not been adequately examined … the task is
much larger than sampling 30 orders.” (Bullock & Northcutt, 1982) This suggests the possibility
of indirect magnetoreception in almost any species of fish and that insensitivity to electric fields
should be tested explicitly and not assumed based on unverified theoretical inferences.
4. Magnetic Deterrents
Early efforts to develop shark deterrents were motivated by the need to protect humans in shark
infested waters. More recent efforts have been motivated by conservation needs to reduce
elasmobranch mortality associated with bycatch of fisheries and beach nets. (Bonfill, 1994;
Shepherd & Myers, 2005) One technology commonly evaluated as a shark repellent is
permanent magnets. The use of magnetic hooks has only a nominal cost increase, making
magnetic hooks commercially viable if they are effective at the deterrent function without
reducing catch rates of target species. These magnets are hypothesized to work by
overstimulating the ampullae of Lorenzini that are present in elasmobranchs. (Stoner &
Kaimmer, 2008; Jordan et al., 2013; O’Connell et al., 2012; Rigg et al., 2009) Because teleosts
have not been shown to possess ampullae of Lorenzini, proponents of this hypothesis have
attempted to infer that magnetic repellents selectively repel elasmobranchs but not teleosts. Since
viable deterrent technologies must be selective to reduce bycatch of elasmobranchs in fisheries
without reducing catch of target species, it is essential to consider the strength of the theoretical
and empirical evidence regarding whether or not teleost species are likely to be sensitive to
deterrent technologies.
Permanent magnets on hooks have been experimentally shown to reduce the catch of some
elasmobranch species. Hook-and-line experiments have supported that magnets reduce the catch
rates of the Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and the smooth dogfish (M.
canis). (O’Connell et al., 2011) Longline experiments found that permanent magnets
significantly decreased capture of the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and the southern
stingray (D. Americana). (O’Connell et al., 2011)
Very few statistically significant results have been published regarding whether magnetic hooks
alter catch rates in teleost species. Because of the current reliance on theoretical considerations,
adequate tests of the hypothesis that permanent magnets do not alter teleost capture are required.
Some current research on this topic has presented inadequate study designs to reach significant
conclusions. A 2011 paper featured a secondary hypothesis regarding teleost capture on hooks
with permanent magnets, but used a sample of only four teleosts in a longline group and eleven
in a hook-and-line group to assert conclusions. (O’Connell et al., 2011; Courtney & Courtney,
2011) Whether or not magnetic hooks reduce catch rates of teleost fishes remains largely an open
question. It is necessary to explicitly test this hypothesis with adequate sample sizes for a
number of taxa of teleost fish under varying conditions.

5. Discussion
There are two main hypotheses regarding the mechanism of magnetoreception in fish: direct and
indirect. Direct magnetoreception involves biogenic magnetite, and there is evidence for this in
both elasmobranch and teleost fish. Indirect magnetoreception involves electromagnetic
induction. It is well established that many fish are electroreceptive and have specific reception
mechanisms that may be used to detect magnetic fields as well. Elasmobranch fish detect
electric fields through ampullae of Lorenzini, while other bony fish detect electric fields through
ampullary organs or other mechanisms. Direct electroreceptive capabilities in a fish do not
exclude the possibility of direct magnetoreceptive capabilities also. Further, it should not be
assumed that fish without known electroreceptive capabilities are insensitive to electric and
magnetic fields without testing explicitly.
In any given species, detecting significantly different catch rates between a magnetic hook and a
sham would suggest some form of magnetoreception in that species. Sensitivity to magnetic
hooks may be the simplest method yet proposed for detecting magnetic sensitivity in fish, and
experiments can be conducted relatively inexpensively in field trials in all species available to be
readily caught on baited hooks. This is much simpler and more accessible than previous
methods involving various conditioning techniques and complex laboratory apparatus. Further,
field trials with magnetic hooks allow study of magnetic sensitivity in species prohibitively
large, difficult, or expensive to manage under captive laboratory conditions.
If magnetic reception exists only indirectly via electromagnetic induction, sensitivity to magnetic
hooks will likely vary between still and moving water. Since the induced electric field is
proportional to the current speed, fish that detect magnetic fields indirectly will lose sensitivity
in still water, although the movements of the fish may provide a minimum amount of motion
needed to detect magnets at sufficiently close distances. In contrast, fish that detect magnetic
fields by biogenic magnetite should be sensitive to magnetic hooks without regard for the
presence of current.
Since aquatic conductivity is necessary to complete the circuit in fish that detect magnetic field
via electromagnetic induction, it is likely that species whose magnetic sensitivity depends
strongly on salinity levels (thus aquatic conductance) are making use of electromagnetic
induction. Insensitivity of magnetic detection thresholds to salinity over a broad range would
suggest direct magnetoreception is more likely.
Sensitive techniques have been developed to identify biogenic magnetite in magnetoreceptive
fishes, and some authors (Kirschvink et al., 2001) have gone as far as to assert that the presence
of magnetite is the defining feature of magnetoreceptive vertebrates. A confirmed absence
(using the most sensitive available techniques) of biogenic magnetite would suggest that indirect
electroreception is the mechanism at work in magnetoreceptive species.
Conversely,
confirmation of the presence of biogenic magnetite in any given species suggests that direct
magnetic field detection is present in that species.

The necessary selectivity of magnetic shark deterrents has been assumed though flawed
theoretical reasoning that teleost species cannot detect electric and magnetic fields. Given that
both electroreception and direct magnetoreception have been demonstrated in broad classes of
teleosts, attempting to establish teleost insensitivity to magnetic deterrents from results in small
numbers of teleost taxa or by grouping of all teleosts is unwarranted. The hypothesis of teleost
insensitivity to magnetic hooks should be tested with adequate sample sizes for a number of taxa
under varying conditions including moving water. Failure to explicitly test for sensitivity to
magnetic deterrents creates a real risk of inadvertently altering catch rates of teleost species.
6. Acknowledgments
The subject of magnetoreception in fish first came to our attention when we read O'Connell et al.
(2011) and noted the numerous errors. We brought these to the authors' attention, and while the
data and analysis reporting errors were corrected in a published errata, the scientific errors
remained and continued to be propagated in additional publications. The journals propagating
these errors refused to balance the information with replies citing Kirschvink and his co-authors
regarding magnetite based magnetoreception, with one editor telling us, “I could not find that
you ever contributed to this sort of research.” We contacted Joe Kirschvink at Cal Tech for
advice. He described the editor's obvious bias as “idiotic” and encouraged us to persist, which
has resulted in this paper. We are grateful to BTG Research and the United States Air Force
Academy for funding this review paper as well as original research in which we have
documented magnetoreception in three species of teleosts: black drum (Pogonias cromis), sea
catfish (Ariopsis felis), and red drum (Sciaenops ocelatus). Though the corresponding author
(MC) is no longer affiliated with the Air Force Academy, he is grateful to their support and
encouragement allowing him to explore and enter new research fields. We are also grateful to
the two anonymous peer reviewers (Aquatic Science and Technology) who provided valuable
feedback which was incorporated into the paper.
