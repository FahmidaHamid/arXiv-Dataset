Abstract
Cancer arises from successive rounds of mutations which generate tumor cells with different
genomic variation i.e. clones. For drug responsiveness and therapeutics, it is necessary to identify
the clones in tumor sample accurately. Many methods are developed to infer tumor heterogeneity
by either computing cellular prevalence and tumor phylogeny or predicting genotype of mutations.
All methods suffer some problems e.g. inaccurate computation of clonal frequencies, discarding
clone specific genotypes etc. In the paper, we propose a method, called- HetFHMM to infer tumor
heterogeneity by predicting clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence. To infer clone specific
genotype, we consider the presence of multiple mutations at any genomic location. We also tested
our model on different simulated data. The results shows that HetFHMM outperforms recent
methods which infer tumor heterogeneity. Therefore, HetFHMM is a novel approach in tumor
heterogeneity research area.

Introduction

Cancer is a disease, caused by somatic mutations that accumulate in the genome during the lifetime
of human [11]. Somatic mutations generate tumor cells with different genomic variation within tumor
to form carcinoma i.e. cancer. This phenomena is known as Intra Tumor Heterogeneity [4] [7] [14] [19]
[20]. In tumor heterogeneity, each type of cells with distinct genomic structure are known as clones [9]
[12]. Caraco et al. [1] identifies that drug responsiveness and cancer therapies are clone dependent. To
develop more accurate drug and therapy, it is important to predict clonal subpopulations (i.e. clones)
within tumor accurately.
Each clone contains distinct genomic variation which is expressed by the precise order of nucleotides
of DNA molecules, different from other clones [5] [11]. To predict the order of nucleotides of DNA
molecules, several techniques are developed. These techniques are known as DNA sequencing. Sanger
sequencing [18] is the first approach to predict precise order of nucleotides of DNA molecules. This
technique cannot produce complete nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule. Later a new technique
is developed to predict complete nucleotides sequence from DNA molecule called Next Generation
Sequencing in short NGS. NGS produces many short sequences of nucleotides to predict complete
nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule. These short sequences are known as short reads. During
DNA sequencing, some short reads are deleted or amplified by E. coli which is used for cloning DNA
fragments. Therefore, sometimes short reads cannot produce complete nucleotide sequence of a DNA
molecule. It is a challenging task to infer clones from short reads.
Many researches and methods are developed to infer clones from short reads. These methods
detect clones by either estimating cellular prevalence1 and tumor phylogeny2 or inferring genotypes

of all mutations. At first researchers develop many methods to infer genotypes of all mutations by
considering genotype as the signature of a clone. GPHMM [13] and Apolloh [9] are the pioneer methods
to infer clones from short reads. These methods detect only copy number variation (CNV) in form of
genotypes to predict clones by assuming that only one clone exhibits one mutation which appears at
a genomic location. Loss of heterogeneity (LOH)3 is not predicted together with CNV. TH-HMM [22]
and CLImAT [24] detect LOH with CNV. But GPHMM [13], Apolloh [9], TH-HMM [22] and CLImAT
[24] do not consider the presence of multiple clone which do not exhibit a mutation at a location in
tumor sample. This important feature is considered in OncoSNP-SEQ [23] and TITAN [10] to infer
genotypes. Above mentioned methods do not work on presence of multiple mutations at any location.
Roy et al. [17] predicts the phylogeny relation between clones by using multicolor lineage tracing
method alias Brainbow. To identify the phylogeny, it is necessary to cluster mutations. TITAN [10]
clusters all mutations into several classes. Other than TITAN [10], PyClone [16], PhyloSub [12],
PhyloWGS [3] and Rec-BTP [11] identify clusters of mutations by computing and clustering cellular
frequencies of all mutations. But these methods cannot identify the clones with same cellular prevalence
separately. Like GPHMM [13] and Apolloh [9], these methods consider the presence of one mutation
at a genomic location.
In real world, many mutations can appear at any genomic location. There are several scenarios
appear at any genomic location. (a). Some clones have same mutation which is harboured by their
ancestor clone. (b) One clone exhibits a mutation which is identical from others. Genotype of a genomic
location cannot reveal types of mutation which appear at that location. Clone specific genotype is a
special genotype which express the genotype of a mutation harboured by a clone. Clonal signature4 ,
clusters of mutations and types of mutation of a location can be easily predicted by clone specific
genotype. No existing method can detect clone specific mutation. This important feature is addressed
in our proposed method- Heterogeneity Factorial Hidden Markov Model (HetFHMM). On the other
hand, existing methods detect either cellular prevalence or genotypes. Genotype of a mutation and
cellular prevalence combinely affect the count of short reads which are the inputs of existing methods.
Our proposed HetFHMM infers clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalences together from the short
reads to predict clonal subpopulations within tumor. It is a novel approach in tumor heterogeneity to
predict clones within tumor.
Our proposed HetFHMM is discussed in section 2. We tested our designed method with recent
methods for simulated data. It is found that our method outperforms recent methods. We discuss our
experiments and results in section 3.

HetFHMM

To infer clone specific genotypes and cellular prevalence from short reads, we develop a factorial hidden
Markov model (FHMM) which is first proposed by Ghahramani et al. [8]. In FHMM, there are n
number of chains. Each chain for individual object. Ghahramani et al. [8] first develops FHMM to
identify the multiple simultaneous potential speakers from speech signals. In this FHMM, each chain
is dedicated for each speaker. In our problem, tumor sample contains multiple clones whose genotypes
and cellular prevalence would be different from each other. Like Ghahramani et al. [8], we predict
clones by n chains using FHMM. In HetFHMM, we consider first chain i.e. chain 0 as normal cells.
Rest of other chains represent the clones within tumor sample.
In the model, genotype Gt,n of any clone n at tth location is one of the hidden variables. Duan et
al. [6] is found in their experiments that copy number varies upto 5. Copy number variation exhibits 21
genotype states are shown in table- 2. In the model, we infer another latent variable- cellular prevalence
vector Φ which contains cellular prevalence of all clones of tumor sample.
Our model takes the number of total short reads Nt , reference read counts7 at and log ratio of
tumor-normal reads depth lt at any mutant location t as inputs. Reference read counts at follows
binomial distribution with total sequence reads Nt and Pbt (Gt , Φ). The parameter Pbt (Gt , Φ) computes

where K, rgt,k and cgt,k are the number of clones, reference allele ratio8 and copy number of clone k
at mutant location t respectively. In the model we assume that log ratio of tumor-normal read depth
is gaussian distributed with mean mt (Gt , Φ, o) and standard deviation σ. The number of short reads
of tumor and normal cells are very large. As per central limit theorem, all large data are normally
distributed. For this reason we consider log ratio of tumor-normal read depth is gaussian distributed.
Mean of log ratio of tumor-normal read depth is:

Where o be tumor ploidy parameter which is set to 3. In addition, our proposed model can work on
multiple samples x ∈ X of same patient. Probabilistic graphical model of HetFHMM is shown in fig-1.
Factorial Hidden Markov Model contains transition and emission probabilities. Like FHMM, transition probability of HetFHMM has been expressed as P (Gt,k = i|Gt−1,k = j) = At,k (i, j). We employ
transition probability from the study done by Colella et al.[2] which captures the position specific effects

Since the exact inference for FHMM is intractable [8], we use a sampling method to get an approximation. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is widely adopted for this task. Gibbs sample in
one of the simple sampling schemes among MCMC methods. In order to run Gibbs sampling, we need
to start with an initial model in which all genotypes are randomly generated. Except for the normal
chain, we randomly choose a genotype for each variable based on the uniform distribution. Then, each
hidden variable is sampled given the current state of rest of the variables. In our case, the probability
of each genotype for a hidden variable Gt,k is :
P (Gt,k ) ∝ At (Gt,k |Gt−1,k )At+1 (Gt,k |Gt−1,k )Bin(at,x |Nt,x , Pbt,x )N (lt,x |µt,x , σ)

(7)

We sample each current state given another four variables: the previous genotype Gt−1 , the next
genotype Gt+1 and two observations lt and at .
Having fixed all the values for genotype variables G, the negative log likelihood can be minimized
using Exponentiated Gradient Descent, which is similar to normal Gradient Descent. Gradient Descent
is an algorithm to find the minimum of a given objective function (target function) by gradually
approaching the minimum along the direction of the gradient function. Exponentiated Gradient (EG)
[?] algorithm is a variant of normal Gradient Descent. The difference is that the update for Gradient
Descent is to subtract the gradient of a target function, where as in EG the update is done by multiplying
the exponents of the negative gradient. So in EG we pursue:
max −L(Φ)
Φ∈4

P
that is k φk = 1 and φk ≥ 0 where L denotes the objective function. In addition, it is proved to
perform better when the target is sparse. In other words, it allows us to identify clones even if it
4

contains only a very small proportion of cells. In our case, the objective function is the log likelihood
function of the model, i.e. L(Φ) = log(P (G, l, a, Φ|N, o)). To solve the above maximization problem,
the EG updates are as follows:
φnew
= φk e−(η∇φk L(Φ))

where η is the learning rate. After updating each component of the latent vector Φ, the values are
normalized so that they sum to one. In our model, for the EG updates, we need the derivatives which
are derived using the chain rule, as follows:

It is known that Gibbs sampling stops when the convergence criteria is met. In our case, we
define the number of times that each genotype and cellular prevalence of n clones are sampled as the

Experiments and results

We carry out several experiments to HetFHMM on simulated data to evaluate its inference of clone
specific genotypes at any mutant location including cellular prevalence. We generate simulated data
from factorial Hidden Markov model with the number of clones varies from 3, 4, 5 and 6. The cellular
prevalence vector Φ is specified before generating FHMM. For each FHMM, we select the number of
mutant location by random which varies from 1k to 10k. After selecting the location, first we proceed
to chain 0 which represents as normal cells with genotype AB. We assume that hidden variables for
all chains at first location are also AB. Next, the genotypes of each clone at all mutant locations are
generated using equation-3. We set the expected probability of reference allele Pb and the mean µt of
lt by using equations-2 and 1 respectively. Finally we generate observation variables: reference allele
read counts and log ratio of tumor-normal contents by random production of total read counts which
varies from 1k 10k.
We implement our model HetFHMM on these simulated data. For comparing our model with recent
methods, we also implement PyClone [16], PhyloSub [12] and Rec-BTP [11] on these data. HetFHMM
gives two outputs: cellular prevalence and clone specific genotypes. Whereas PyClone [16], PhyloSub
[12] and Rec-BTP [11] predict cellular prevalence and clusters of all mutations. No method infers clone
specific genotypes from the short reads. Clusters of all mutations can be determined from clone specific
genotypes. Similar types of output of HetFHMM are also generated by PyClone [16], PhyloSub [12]
and Rec-BTP [11]. For this reason we compare the results of HetFHMM with PyClone [16], PhyloSub
[12] and Rec-BTP [11].
We use V -measure to assess the clusters of all mutation that are either generated from clone
specific genotypes or PyClone [16], PhyloSub [12] and Rec-BTP [11] with gold standard. V -measure is
an entropy-based external cluster validation measure to evaluate predicted clusters with respect to gold
standard classes. It measures how successfully the criteria of homogeneity10 and completeness11 have

evaluate cluster prediction than any other cluster evaluation measures. It is also used in PyClone to
evaluate its clustering methodology. Rosenberg et al. [15] defined homogeneity as followed:

not. For assessing our inferred clone specific genotype with the clusters of mutations by V -measure,

produce similar matrices MK×T , MK×T , MK×T and MK×T for gold standard, Rec-BTP [11], PyClone
[16] and PhyloSub [12] respectively. Generated genotypes that are used to produce simulated data, are
considered as gold standard.
Using these matrices, we compute V -measure of the clustered outputs of HetFHMM, PyClone [16],
PhyloSub [12] and Rec-BTP [11] with respect to gold standard. The cluster validation result is shown
in fig.-2. It clearly shows that HetFHMM outperforms Rec-BTP [11], PyClone [16] and PhyloSub [12].
PyClone [16], PhyloSub [12] and Rec-BTP [11] produce more clones than original number of clones
which affects the completeness and homogeneity of V -measure. More over, from fig.-2, it is also found
that increasing number of clones inversely affects the V -measure of each method.
We evaluate the clonal frequencies by using RM SD value after examining the clusters of mutation.
Root mean square distance or RM SD is used to compute the distance/ gap between cellular prevalence
of predicted clones and gold standard clones. Many predicted clones contains some of mutations of a
gold standard clone. Among them, a predicted clone would contain maximal number of mutations of
gold standard clones. This predicted clone is called significant clone of a gold standard clone. This is
why, clonal frequencies of all predicted clones are not compared with gold standard. Before computing
RM SD value, we obtain significant clones from predicted clones. For detecting significant clones, we

to understand the cellular prevalence comparing results better than RM SD.

In cellular prevalence evaluation, we set the value of threshold to 0.25. The comparative result of
log RM SD of HetFHMM, Rec-BTP [11], PyClone [16] and PhyloSub [12] are shown in fig.-3. We find
that HetFHMM produces less log RM SD value compare to Rec-BTP [11], PyClone [16] and PhyloSub
[12]. The V -measure comparison shows that mutation clustering by Rec-BTP [11], PyClone [16] and
PhyloSub [12] are not more accurate than HetFHMM. It affects the number of mutations in a clone
which affects the cellular prevalence of recent methods.

Conclusion

HetFHMM can detect clones by genotypes and cellular prevalence together. We develop HetFHMM
by considering the presence of multiple clones and mutations at any genomic location which helps
to find the more accurate clones and their cellular prevalence than existing methods: PyClone [16],
PhyloSub [12] and Rec-BTP [11]. Therefore, it can be said that HetFHMM is a novel approach in
tumor heterogeneity research to infer clones.
7

Despite improved performance of HetFHMM, it has some issues. We consider any mutation is
dependant on previous mutation. In the real world, all previous mutations have position specific affects
on one mutation which is not considered in this model. The number of clones within a tumor sample
is predefined, but it needs to be predicted from tumor sample. On the other hand, we experiment our
model only on simulated data. We have a plan in future to test our model on real large tumor sample.
We also improve our HetFHMM by considering above mentioned important features.
