Entropy serves as a central observable in equilibrium thermodynamics. However, many biological
and ecological systems operate far from thermal equilibrium. Here we show that entropy production can characterize the behavior of such nonequilibrium systems. To this end we calculate the
entropy production for a population model that displays nonequilibrium behavior resulting from
cyclic competition. At a critical point the dynamics exhibits a transition from large, limit-cycle like
oscillations to small, erratic oscillations. We show that the entropy production peaks very close to
the critical point and tends to zero upon deviating from it. We further provide analytical methods
for computing the entropy production which agree excellently with numerical simulations.

The study of complex systems with a large number
of interacting particles requests global observables that
characterize their behavior. Modern statistical mechanics has successfully identified, interpreted and applied
such observables for equilibrium systems. One of these
observables is the entropy which allows for predictions
of a system’s behavior through the second law of thermodynamics – an isolated system’s entropy cannot decrease. Identifying similar principles for non-equilibrium
systems, however, proves elusive. Neither a characteristic global observable nor a universal principle have been
identified in a general way. While also in nonequilibrium
the entropy production has been proposed as a useful
observable [1, 2], and different principles governing its
behavior have been suggested [3, 4] problems arise from
different employed definitions of entropy and approaches
to nonequilibrium dynamics [2, 5, 6].
In this Letter we demonstrate that entropy production can successfully characterize ecological systems with
cyclic competition. Ecological systems display a wide variety of nonlinear and nonequilibrium behavior. Random
interactions between individuals and the finiteness of the
population lead to intrinsic stochasticity. Nonequilibrium results when interactions between individuals of different species include cyclic dependencies where a species
A1 benefits from and suppresses a species A2 , while A2
benefits from and suppresses a species A3 and so on, with
some species Ak of the resulting chain benefitting from
and suppressing species A1 . Such cycles can lead to erratic or limit-cycle oscillations in the steady state of the
population dynamics [7–16]. Experimental observations
of cyclic dynamics and corresponding oscillations have,
amongst others, been documented for mating behavior
of lizards in costal California [17] and in microbial laboratory communities [18].
The dynamics of ecological systems can be conveniently described as a Markovian stochastic process

through a master equation,
∂t Pi (t) =

i
Xh j
ωi Pj (t) − ωji Pi (t) ,

(1)

j

in which Pi (t) denotes the probability of finding the system in a certain state i at time t and ωij is the transition
probability from state j to state i. The associated mean
entropy production Ṡ of the system follows as

(2)

Equation (2) can be obtained through considering the difference between forward and backward entropy per unit
time of the stochastic process, Equation (1) [19]. Equation (2) follows also as the temporal derivative of the system’s Gibbs entropy together with a term describing the
total increase of thermodynamic entropy in the reservoirs
to which the system is coupled [20]. For steady states defined by ∂t Pi (t) = 0, as we consider in this Letter, the
entropy production simplifies to

It follows from Equation (2) that the entropy production vanishes if and only if the system obeys detailed balance, ωij Pj = ωji Pi . Indeed, detailed balance represents
the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium in the framework of the master equation. Cyclic population dynamics
violates detailed balance; the computation and discussion
of the associated entropy production is the scope of this
Letter.

The reactions on the left describe cyclic competition: A
outperforms B but is beaten by C, and C is taken over
by B in turn. The reactions on the right correspond to
spontaneous mutations between the three species.
The population model defined by the reactions (4) exhibits a critical mutation rate that, in the resulting nonequilibrium steady state, delineates large oscillations in
the species densities from only small ones. Let us introduce this critical mutation rate first. The reactions (4)
conserve the total number N of interacting individuals.
The densities a, b, and c of species A, B, C therefore sum
up to one: a + b + c = 1 and the population’s state space
is the simplex S3 , see Fig. 1. Numerical simulations indicate that small values of the mutation rate m lead to large
oscillations between the densities of the three species; the
probability distribution is highest close to the corners of
the simplex [Fig. 1(a)]. Large values of m, on the contrary, lead to an approximately gaussian probability distribution around the simplex center [Fig. 1(b)]. Erratic
oscillations occur at small amplitudes [9].
The system’s behavior can be analytically described by
an approximate Fokker-Planck equation. A systematic
expansion in the system size N yields an equation for the
temporal evolution of the probability distribution P (s, t)
of the densities s = (a, b) at time t:
1
∂t P (s, t) = −∂i [αi (s)P (s, t)] + ∂i ∂j [βij (s)P (s, t)] ,

in which the indices i, j run from 1 to 2; the summation
convention implies summation over them. The density c

where the indices are understood as modulus 3 and
s3 = c. The terms containing α describe the deterministic part of the temporal evolution. In the absence of fluctuations, the reactions for cyclic dominance lead to neutrally stable oscillations around the internal fixed point
s∗ = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), while the spontaneous mutations
render the internal fixed point stable. Demographic fluctuations are,
√ for large system sizes N , inversely proportional to N and enter the Fokker-Planck equation (5)
through the terms containing β. They induce a stochastic drift away from the internal fixed point towards the
boundaries of the phase space. The Fokker-Planck equation (5) shows that the competition between the deterministic and the stochastic effects leads, at a critical mutation rate mc = k/(2N ), to a uniform probability distribution. Certain deviations from the uniform distribution
occur near the phase space boundaries where the discreteness of the phase space becomes relevant and the
continuous formulation through the Fokker-Planck equation does not hold. For small mutation rate, m < mc ,
fluctuations dominate and drive the system towards the
boundary. In the absence of mutations the corner states
are absorbing and the system goes extinct [21]. An arbitrary small mutation rate, however, leads to sustained
species coexistence and oscillations. In the opposite case,
when m > mc , the deterministic dynamics centers the
probability distribution around the internal fixed point.
The cyclic population dynamics yields a nonequilibrium steady state that is characterized by oscillations, large or small, around the internal fixed point.
What is the resulting entropy production and how does
it relate to the regimes of small, critical and large mutation rates outlined above?
To tackle this question we have carried out extensive
numerical simulations of the stochastic system employing the Gillespie algorithm [22]. Throughout our simulations we have considered k = 1 which defines the timescale. Numerical results from computer simulations of
the stochastic system show that the entropy production
peaks at a certain value mmax of the the mutation rate
(Fig. 2). The value mmax approximately equals the critical mutation rate, mmax ≈ mc (Fig. 2 inset). Small
deviations from this behavior arise for the probability
distribution at the critical mutation rate is not uniform
near the boundaries as mentioned above.
Analytical understanding of the entropy production in
the regimes of small, critical, and large mutation rates
is feasible through the Fokker-Planck equation (5). To
this end we employ a continuous version of the entropy

system size N 2 for small mutation rates and proportional to
N for large mutation rates. The simulation results further
confirm that the entropy production decays as m for m → 0
and as 1/m for m → ∞.

simulations confirm this behavior (Fig. 2).
In the regime of large mutation rates, m > mc , we need
to calculate the probability density in the steady state to
compute the entropy production. We obtain the probability density by using polar coordinates (r, φ) centered
at the internal fixed point. We then simplify the FokkerPlanck equation (5) through a van-Kampen approximation for the coefficients (6): the latter are approximated
by their values at the internal fixed point. The resulting

This result agrees excellently with numerical simulations
[Fig 3(b)]. The entropy production (10) depends linearly
on the system size N . This behavior arises because the
typical area in phase space explored by the dynamics is
proportional to σ 2 ∼ 1/N and thus contains N 2 σ 2 ∼ N
states. The continuity approximation employed in the
Fokker-Planck equation (5) holds for arbitrary large m,
since the width σ of the probability distribution (9) remains finite as m → ∞.
Expanding (10) for large values of m results in
Ṡmmc = k 2 N/(9m). The entropy production vanishes
as m/k increases. Indeed, only the cyclic dynamics at
rate k underlies the nonequilibrium behavior and therefore entropy production, while the mutations at rate m
obey detailed balance.
When the mutation rate is small, m  mc , the probability distribution is concentrated near the boundaries of
the phase space [Fig. 1 (a)]. The dynamics occurs predominantly along the boundary and can therefore be approximately described by considering only the boundary
states. Because of the threefold symmetry it suffices to
regard only one edge of the simplex with periodic boundary conditions. The concentration x of one of the three
species increases along this edge from 0 to 1 such that
the cyclic dynamics drives the system to x = 1. The
deterministic part of the dynamics is given by
∂t x = m(1 − 2x) − k(x − x2 )

and features a fixed point at x∗ = [(2m + k) −
√
4m2 + k 2 ]/(2k). In the range of m  mc , this
fixed point is closer to 1 than the distance 1/N between two discrete states. We conclude that fluctuations will cause the system to exhibit a constant circular current in the steady state. The probability distribution P (x) for x ∈ [ N1 , 1 − N1 ] can therefore be obtained

with a normalization coefficient N . To determine the
probability P0 of a corner state, which turns out to be finite, fluctuations have to be included. P0 can be obtained
using the master equation and the values of P (x = 1/N )
and P (x = 1 − 1/N ). The normalization N follows from

The factor 3 arises because the phase space simplex possesses three edges. For moderate and large system sizes
N we obtain P0 = N /(2m) which dominates the lefthand side of Equation (13), such that N = N m/3. The

in perfect argeement with simulations [Fig 3 (a)]. The
entropy production for small mutation rates is proportional to the squared system size. Decreasing m lowers
the entropy production in proportion because mutations
are the process that restart the cyclic dynamics once a
corner state has been reached. Mutations therefore limit
the dynamics to a timescale proportional to m.
In conclusion, we have examined the global entropy
production in the steady state of a cyclic population
model. At a critical mutation rate the system undergoes a transition from large oscillations along the phase
space’s boundary to small erratic oscillations around an
internal fixed point. The entropy production peaks very
near the critical mutation rate and decreases to zero away
from it. We believe that, in a similar manner, the entropy production can yield valuable information about
the nonequilibrium steady state of other stochastic systems. Indeed, in a recently studied model, because of
a non-fixed system size and the extensivity of the entropy production, the slope of the entropy production
peaks near a critical point [25]. Within our approach of
a fixed system size we have investigated a stochastic system that displays a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We
found that the entropy production predicts the scale of

the critical mutation rate: it peaks near the Hopf bifurcation, at a mutation rate of about 1/4 of the critical
one [23]. Understanding the certain discrepancy between
the maximum and the critical value may open a route to
more general understanding of the role of entropy production. Because of the universality of the Hopf bifurcation we conclude that our approach is valid for a wide
class of non-equilibrium systems, namely those that exhibit a transition from small, erratic oscillations to limitcycle-like ones, including systems with spatial degrees of
freedom [24].

Supplementary EPAPS Document: Entropy production and Hopf
bifurcation
Entropy production can characterize the behavior of a broad class of nonequilibrium systems. In this Supplementary Material we underpin this point through consideration of a nonequilibrium stochastic system that exhibitis a
Hopf bifurcation. We show that the entropy production peaks in the vicinity of the bifurcation, where the behavior
changes from noisy, erratic oscillations to larger limit-cycle oscillations. We conclude that the entropy production generally characterizes the behavior of systems with limit cycles that fall into the universality class of the Hopf bifurcation.

The reactions with rates k and l can represent cyclic dominance of three species [11]. The corresponding deterministic
rate equations have first been proposed and analyzed by R. M. May and W. J. Leonard [16]. The reactions with rate
m describe spontaneous mutations between the three species.
The deterministic equations for the temporal evolution of the concentrations a, b, c of species A, B, C follow from
the reactions (15) as
∂t a = a[l(1 − ρ) − kc] + m(b + c − 2a) ,
∂t b = b[l(1 − ρ) − ka] + m(a + c − 2b) ,
∂t c = c[l(1 − ρ) − kb] + m(a + b − 2c) .

(16)

Linear stability analysis reveals the existence of a reactive fixed point at (a∗ , b∗ , c∗ ) = l/(3l + k) · (1, 1, 1). This
fixed point changes its stability at a critical mutation rate mc = kl/6/(3l + k) from a stable spiral point (above mc )
to an unstable spiral point (below mc ). Further analysis that takes the leading nonlinearities into account reveals
that a supercritical Hopf bifurcation arises at mc . Above the critical mutation rate, for m > mc , the stochastic
system performs noisy erratic oscillations around the reactive fixed point. The steady-state probability distribution is

approximately gaussian around the reactive fixed point, see Fig. 4 (c) for a projection of the system’s steady state onto
the simplex spanned by the densities a, b, c. Below the critical mutation rate, for m < mc , a stable limit cycle forms.
The stochastic dynamics leads to noisy trajectories along the limit cycle, see Fig. 4 (a). At the critical mutation rate,
as the linear terms in the deterministic equations vanish, a relatively broad, non-gaussian probability distribution
centered at the reactive fixed point arises [Fig. 4 (b)]. This behavior is similar to the one recently reported in Ref. [13]
where higher order nonlinearities render a spiral point stable while the linear terms vanish.
We have performed extensive stochastic simulations of the stochastic system defined by the reactions (15). In these
simulations we have left the rates k, l constant at k = l = 1, defining the time-scale, and systematically varied the
mutation rate m as well as the system size N . In principle, a divergence in the entropy production can arise when
the system reaches the boundary of the phase space. However, because the probability of these boundary states is
exponentially suppressed, this effect can be ignored.
For all considered system sizes the resulting entropy production exhibits a maximum near the critical mutation
rate mc , see Fig. 5. For system sizes above about N = 200 the maximum of the entropy production arises at a value
mmax ≈ 0.01, about 1/4 of the value of the critical mutation rate mc ≈ 0.042. For mutation rates much smaller and
much larger than mmax the entropy production tends to zero. The system’s behavior therefore resembles the one
reported in the main part of this Letter, underpinning the general usefulness of entropy production in characterizing
nonequilibrium steady states. Understanding the certain discrepancy of mmax and mc will yield further insight into
the relation between entropy production and critical nonequilibrium behavior.
