Abstract

This paper describes and analyzes the spatial spread of tuberculosis (TB) on complex metapopulation,
that is, networks of populations connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms
of connectivity distribution of nodes (patches) and the conditional probabilities of connections among
classes of nodes sharing the same degree. The migration and transmission processes occur simultaneously.
For uncorrelated networks under the assumption of standard incidence transmission, we compute the
disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number, and show that the disease-free equilibrium
is locally asymptotically stable. Moreover, for uncorrelated networks and under assumption of simple
mass action transmission, we give a necessary and sufficient conditions for the instability of the diseasefree equilibrium. The existence of endemic equilibria is also discussed. Finally, the prevalence of the TB
infection across the metapopulation as a function of the path connectivity is studied using numerical
simulations.

Keywords: Tuberculosis, metapopulation, uncorrelated networks, basic reproduction number, stability.

Introduction
Despite significant advances in medical science, infectious diseases continue to impact human populations

in many parts of the world. Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus) is a common deadly
infectious disease caused mainly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It basically attacks the lungs (pulmonary
TB), but can also affect the central nervous system, circulatory system, the genital-urinary system, bones,
joints and even the skin. Tuberculosis can spread through cough, sneeze, speak, kiss or spit from active
pulmonary TB persons. It can also spread through use of an infected person’s unsterilized eating utensils
and in rare cases a pregnant woman with active TB can infect her foetus (vertical transmission) [1,2].
Transmission can only occur from people with active TB but not latent TB. This transmission from one
person to another depends upon the number of infectious droplets expelled by a carrier, the effectiveness
of ventilation, duration of the exposure and virulence of the MTB strain. The chain of transmission can
therefore be broken by isolating patients with active disease and starting effective anti-tuberculosis therapy
[1-5]. At present, about 95% of the estimated 8 million new cases of TB occurring each year are in developing
countries, where 80% occur among people between the ages of 15-59 years [1]. In sub-Saharan Africa, TB is
the leading cause of mortality and in developing countries, it accounts for an estimated 2 million deaths which
accounts for a quarter of avoidable adult deaths [1]. It is known that factors such as endogenous reactivation,
emergence of multi-drug resistant TB, and increase in HIV incidence in the recent years call for improved
control strategies for TB. A full understanding of the effectiveness of treatment and control strategies within
different regions of the world is still needed. It is worth emphasizing that mathematical analysis of biomedical
and disease transmission models can contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of those processes
and to design potential therapies (see [6-9] and references therein). A number of theoretical studies have
been carried out on the mathematical modeling of TB transmission dynamics [3-9,38,39].
However, the analysis of the spread of infectious diseases on complex networks has become a central
issue in modern epidemiology [10] and, indeed, it was one of the main motivations for the development of
percolation theory [11]. While the initial approach was focussed on local contact networks [12-16], that is,
social networks within single populations (cities, urban areas), a new approach has been recently introduced
for dealing with the spread of diseases in ensembles of (local) populations with a complex spatial arrangement
and connected by the migrations. Such sets of connected populations living in a patchy environment are
called metapopulations in ecology, and their study began in 1967 with the theory of island biogeography
[17].
Unfortunately, when considering dispersal models, there is an approach based on the metapopulation
concept. The population is subdivided into a number of discrete patches which are supposed to be well
mixed. Then, in each patch the population is subdivided into compartments corresponding to different
epidemic status. This leads to a multi-patch, multi-compartment system. At this point two formulations

2

are possible.
The first one assumes that an infective in one patch can infect susceptible individuals in another patch.
This assumption gives rise to a family of models which have been well studied [18,19]. This formulation
assumes that there is a spatial coupling between patches, but that individuals (vectors or hosts) do not
migrate between patches. They make short ‘visits’ from their home patches to other patches.
The second one considers migration of individuals between patches. The infection does not take place
during the migration process. The situation is that of a directed graph, where the vertices represent the
patches and the arcs represent the links between patches. Recently, there has been increased interest in these
deterministic metapopulation disease models. For instance, in some recent models of epidemic spreading, the
location of the patches in space is treated explicitly (without taking into account the number of connections
k (degree) that any given patch in the network may have) thanks to the increasing of computational power
(see for instance [20, 21]). In Refs. [16, 22, 23], however, an alternative approach based on the formalism
used in the statistical mechanics of complex networks is presented. Under this approach, the structure of
the spatial network of patches (nodes) is encapsulated by means of the connectivity (degree) distribution
p(k) defined as the probability that a randomly chosen patch has connectivity k. In contrast, in [24, 25],
the authors consider reaction diffusion processes to take place simultaneously, which turns out to be correct
assumption for a suitable continuous-time formulation of metapopulation models for the spread of infectious
diseases.
In this paper, we consider the spread of TB on complex metapopulations, that is, networks of populations
connected by migratory flows whose configurations are described in terms of the conditional probabilities of
connections among classes of nodes sharing the same degree. For uncorrelated networks under the assumption
of standard incidence [37] (or frequency-dependent) transmission, we compute the disease-free equilibrium
and the basic reproduction number and show that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically
stable. Moreover, for uncorrelated networks and under assumption of simple mass action [37] (or densitydependent) transmission, we give a necessary and sufficient conditions for the instability of the disease-free
equilibrium. We find that there exists a more precise bound of the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix
of the system around the disease-free equilibrium. This condition says that, for fixed values of the migration
rates of latently-infected and infectious individuals, a high enough density of individuals and/or large enough
maximum connectivity in the metapopulation guarantee the instability of the disease-free equilibrium and,
hence, TB spread. In the limit of infinite networks with bounded average degree, this condition implies
the existence of a TB threshold for any distribution with large value. The existence of endemic equilibria
is also discussed. Additionally, through numerical simulations, the forecasted prevalence of the infection is
not constant but increases with the patch connectivity. Interestingly, close the epidemic threshold, there
are always patches with low connectivities where TB is not able to progress unless infectious individuals

3

arrive from (crowded) patches with higher connectivities. Comparing to existing results in the literature,
our work treats a specific disease which is not the case in Refs. [24, 25, 26]. We point out that in Refs.
[24, 25, 26], the authors have neglected some important epidemiological features of the propagation of a
disease such as births, natural mortality, mortality due to the disease, natural recovery and the basic models
studied are of dimension 2 which are very simple. In addition, the authors have supposed that the total
population is constant which is not always the case. Our basic model is of dimension 4 and incorporates the
essential biological and epidemiological features of TB such as birth, mortality due to the disease, slow and
fast progression, effective chemoprophylaxis of latently-infected individuals, natural recovery and treatment
of infectious, relapse from the disease and re-infection after recovery. Also in our model, the total population
is not constant. It is our view fact that this study represents the first work that provides an in-depth the
spread of TB on complex metapopulation using a degree of distribution and conditional probabilities.

A TB metapopulation model

2.1

The model

We consider the spread of TB in heterogeneous metapopulations. The model consists of n patches representing n different degree of connectivities. We assume that the architecture of the network of patches
(nodes) where local populations live is mathematically encoded by means of the connectivity (degree) distribution p(k), defined as the probability that a randomly chosen patch has degree k. At any given time, in
each patch, an individual is in one of the following states: susceptible, latently infected (exposed to TB but
not infectious), infectious (has active TB) and recovered. These states are average number (density) of ρS,k ,
ρE,k , ρI,k and ρR,k in the patches of connectivity k, respectively. The total variable population size at time
t is given by,
ρk (t) = ρS,k (t) + ρE,k (t) + ρI,k (t) + ρR,k (t).

(1)

It is assumed that births are recruited into the population at per capita rate Λ. The transmission of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs following adequate contacts between a susceptible and infectious in each
ρI,k ρS,k
sub-population. The rate at which susceptible are infected is β
for standard incidence (or frequencyρk
dependent) transmission and β ρI,k ρS,k for simple mass action (or density-dependent) transmission, where β
is the effective contact rate of infectious that is sufficient to transmit infection to susceptible (it also denotes
how contagious of the disease is). On adequate contacts with active individuals, a susceptible individual
becomes infected but not yet infectious. A fraction q of newly infected individuals is assumed to undergo a
fast progression directly to the infectious class, while the remainder is latently infected and enter the latent
class. Latently infected individuals are assumed to acquire some immunity as a result of the infection, which
reduces the risk of subsequent infection but does not fully prevent it. We assume that chemoprophylaxis

4

of latently infected individuals reduces their reactivation at a rate θ and that the initiation of therapeutics
immediately remove individuals from active status and place them into a latent state. This last assumption
is realistic. Indeed, the classic works of Jindani et al. [40] showed that a bactericidal treatment reduced
the number of bacilli 20 times during the first two days and about 200 times during the 12 days. After two
weeks of treatment, the sputum of a patient contain on average 1000 times less bacilli before treatment, a
number generally too low to be detected on direct examination. Latently infected individuals who received
successful chemoprophylaxis can recover at a constant rate η and enter the recovered class R. Those who did
not received effective chemoprophylaxis progress to active TB at a rate α(1 − θ) where α is the rate at which
latently infected individuals become infectious (this value is connected with the average time of incubations).
Once in active stage of the disease, due to their own immunity, an individual may recover naturally and
will move in the class of latently infected at rate γ. Also, after a therapy of treatment, infectious can
spontaneously recover from the disease and will enter the recovery class R at rate δ. As suggested by Styblo
[41], recovered individuals can only have a partial immunity. Hence, they can relapse from the disease with
a constant rate ξ and enter the infectious class I, in the same time some of them can be re-infected at a rate
ρI,k
(1 − ξ)β
and enter class E. The rate for non-disease related death is µ, thus, 1/µ is the average lifetime.
ρk
Infectious have addition death rate due to disease with a rate d.
This model description is summarized in the flow diagram given below.
According to the derivation in [24, 25] of the continuous-time formulation for the progress of diseases on
metapopulations and assuming non-limited or frequency-dependent transmission, the equations governing

reaction-diffusion processes, Eq. (2) expresses the time variation of susceptible, latently infected individuals,
recovered individuals and infectious as the sum of two independent contributions: reaction and diffusion. In
particular, the diffusion term includes the outflow of individuals (diffusing particles) from patches of degree

Notice that, since births and deaths are considered in model (2), the total number of individuals is not

summing over all k, we have the following differential equations for ρS , ρE , ρI and ρR , the average number
of susceptible, latently infected, infectious and recovered individuals per path at time t, respectively,

Thus, it follows from Eq. (7) that all possible solutions of system (5) will enter the region Ω. Hence, the
region Ω, of biological interest, is positively-invariant under the flow induced by system (5). Further, it can
be shown using the theory of permanence [26] that all solutions on the boundary of Ω eventually enter the
interior of Ω. Furthermore, in Ω, the usual existence, uniqueness and continuation results hold for system
(5). Hence, system (5) is well posed mathematically and epidemiologically and it is sufficient to consider the
dynamics of the flow generated by system (5) in Ω. The same conclusions on Ω hold for the simple mass
action (or density-dependent) model.
For networks with a connectivity pattern defined by a set of conditional probabilities P (k ′ |k), we define
the elements of the connectivity matrix C as
Ckk′ =

k
P (k ′ |k).
k′

Note that these elements are the average number of individuals that patches of degree k receive from
neighboring patches of degree k ′ assuming that one individual leaves each of these patches by choosing at
random one of the k ′ connections [9]. One should notice that, for those degrees k that are not present in
the network, P (k ′ |k) = 0, ∀k ′ . Hereafter in the paper, when talking about degrees, we implicitly mean
those degrees that are present in the network. Furthermore, the case with patches having all the same
7

connectivity is excluded from our considerations because, under the present approach, the model equations
reduce to those of a single patch SEIR model.

3

Uncorrelated networks
In order to obtain analytical results about the TB metapopulation dynamics, we need to be precise about

the form of P (k ′ |k). The easiest and usual assumption is to restrict ourselves to uncorrelated networks. In
these networks, the degrees of the nodes at the ends of any given link are independent, that is, no degreedegree correlation between the connected nodes. In this case, we have that P (k ′ |k) = k ′ p(k ′ )/hki which
corresponds to the degree distribution of nodes (patches) that arrive at by following a randomly chosen link
[29].

3.1

Analysis of standard incidence (or frequency-dependent) model

After replacing the expression of P (k ′ |k) into Eq.(2), one obtains the following equations for TB spread

In this form, it becomes clearer that the diffusion term is simply given by the difference between the

outflow of susceptible, latently infected, infectious and recovered individuals in patches of connectivity k,
Ds ρS,k , DE ρE,k , DI ρI,k , and DR ρR,k and the total inflow of susceptible, latently infected, infectious and
recovered individuals across all their k connections, which is k times the average flow of individuals across
a connection in the network, DS ρS /hki, DE ρE /hki , DI ρI /hki and DR ρR /hki. Note that this average flow
across a connection does not depend on the degree k of the considered patch because we have assumed that
the architecture of the metapopulation is described by an uncorrelated network.
In these networks, the elements of the connectivity matrix C are simply
Ckk′ =

(9)

Clearly, C is a rank-one matrix and has the vector with components vk = k as eigenvector of eigenvalue
1. So, if there are n different degrees in the network, then the eigenvalues of this matrix are λ = 0, with
8

algebraic multiplicity n − 1 and λ = 1 which is a simple eigenvalue. This fact will be used in the stability of
equilibria of the model. To do this, we are going to ‘vectorialize’ system (8), using the following vectors of
Rn :
S = (ρS,k1 , ρS,k2 , . . . , ρS,kn )T , E = (ρE,k1 , ρE,k2 , . . . , ρE,kn )T , I = (ρI,k1 , ρI,k2 , . . . , ρI,kn )T ,
R = (ρR,k1 , ρR,k2 , . . . , ρR,kn )T , N = (ρk1 , ρk2 , . . . , ρkn )T and I = (1, 1, . . . , 1)T . If X ∈ Rn is a vector, we
denote by diag(X) the n × n matrix whose diagonal is given by the components of X. With these notations
and conventions, system (8) becomes

We point out that in the case where the parameters β, q, γ, µ, δ, θ, α, ξ, η and d are not the same for all
patches, they are replaced in system (10) by diagonal non-negative matrices and this does not change the
fundamental structure of the system.

For the analysis of the infection’s spread, the so-called disease-free equilibrium is particularly relevant.

By definition, this is obtained by replacing ρI,k = 0 in Eq.(2), leading to an explicit expression for the
number of susceptible individuals in patches with degree k that can be written as

3.1.2

Basic reproduction number and local stability of (DFE)

The global behavior for this model crucially depends on the basic reproduction number, that is, the
average number of secondary cases produced by a single infective individual which is introduced into an
entirely susceptible population. System (8) has an evident equilibrium Q0 = (S 0 , 0, 0, 0) with Sk0 = ρ0S,k
defined as in Eq. (12) and 0 the zero vector of dimension n when there is no disease. We calculate the basic
reproduction number, R0 , using the next generation approach, developed in Ref. [30].
Using the notations in Ref. [30], the matrices F and V , for the new infections and the remaining transfers,
are, respectively, given by

V can be written in the following form:
V −1 =

where A = F11 W11 and B = F11 W12 . Thus, the basic reproduction ratio is defined, following [30], as the
spectral radius of the next generation matrix, F V −1 :
R0 = ρ(F V −1 ) = ρ(A) = ρ (F11 W11 ) .

(13)

To compute the explicit expression of the basic reproduction number, we need to compute the inverse matrix
of V . To this end, we need the following lemma stated above and proved in Appendix A.
Lemma 1 : Let N be a square block matrix of the following form:
N=

where N1 and N4 are square matrices.
If N1 and D = N4 − N3 N1−1 N2 are invertible, then the inverse matrix of N is given by

N1 + N1−1 N2 D−1 N3 N1−1 −N1−1 N2 D−1

Note that the matrix V1 has the form of the matrix N defined in Lemma 1 with N1 = AE In − DE C,

N2 = −γ In , N3 = −α(1 − θ) In and N4 = AI In − DI C.
Note also that the matrix V has the form of the matrix N defined in Lemma 1 with N1 = V1 , N2 = V2 ,
N3 = V3 and N4 = V4 . So, if all the hypotheses in Lemma 1 are satisfied for the matrices V1 and V4 , then
Lemma 1 can be used twice to compute V −1 .
Thus using Lemma 1, one can prove that V1−1 has the following form:
V1−1 =

need to compute the inverse matrices of AI In − DI C − α γ(1 − θ) (AE In − DE C)
To do so, we shall used the following Lemma 2 stated below and proved in Appendix C.

Lemma 2 : Let G = U + X W Z be an n × n invertible matrix. Suppose that the matrices U , W and
W −1 + Z U −1 X are invertible. Then, the inverse matrix of R is defined as
G−1 = U −1 − U −1 X [W −1 + Z U −1 X]−1 Z U −1 .

This achieve the computation of V1−1 .
Now, we need to compute V −1 . To this end, we need to prove the invertibility of matrix D = V4 −
V3 V1−1 V2 . Simple substitutions show that:
D

=

V4 − (η ξ V11 + δ ξ V21 ),

[AR − ξ (η a3 + δ a1 )] In − [DR + ξ (η b3 + δ b1 )] C.

Since V1 and D are invertible matrices, applying Lemma 1, after simple calculations we have:

On the other hand, to have the explicit expression of the basic reproduction ratio, we need the following

Lemma 3 : Let M be a square block matrix of the following form:


M1 M2

M3 M4
where M1 , M2 , M3 and M4 are also square matrices.
1. If M2 is invertible and M2 M3 − M2 M4 M2−1 M1 = 0, then
ρ(M ) = max{0, ρ(M1 + M2 M4 M2−1 )}.

(15)

2. Moreover, if M2 M4 = M4 M2 , then
ρ(M ) = max{0, ρ(M1 + M2 )}.

Note that A = F11 W11 has the form of the matrix M defined in Lemma 3 with

V22 are irreducible and nonnegative, one has V12 , V21 > 0. This implies that A is also irreducible and nonnegative. Then, using the Perron-Frobenius theorem [31], one can deduce that ρ(A) is a positive eigenvalue

The following result is established from Theorem 2 of [30]:
Lemma 4 : The disease-free equilibrium Q0 of system (8) is locally asymptotically stable whenever R0 < 1,
and instable if R0 > 1.
Biologically speaking, Lemma 4 implies that TB can be eliminated from the community (when R0 ≤ 1)
if the initial sizes of the population are in the basin of attraction of the disease-free equilibrium Q0 .

Figure ?? shows the effects of the transmission rate β and the patch connectivity k on the basic reproduction ratio R0 given as in Eq. (19). We have taken a metapopulation with scale-free distribution p(k) ∼ k −3
16

with hki = 6, kmin = 3 and DS = DE = DI = DR = 1. All other parameters are as in Table 1. The part
above the unity of the picture corresponds to the region of the instability of the disease-free equilibrium,
while the part below the unity of the figure represents the region for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. From this figure, one can see that R0 decreases if β decreases even in the case of large values of k.
This means that if the transmission coefficient β is sufficiently small, TB infection could be eliminated in
the host population even if the number of the patch connectivity k is large. However, it is difficult to control
β. This figure also shows that for the chosen parameter values, if the patch connectivity k does not exceed
1.2 (k < 6), then TB can be controlled irrespective of the value of β. The infection will equally persist for
k > 6.
The combined effects of the patch connectivity k and the recovery rate δ on the basic reproduction
number R0 when β = 0.0017 are shown in Fig. ??. This figure suggests that the basic reproduction ratio R0
decreases if δ increases or k decreases. Thus, the treatment of TB will have beneficial effects on infectious
populations if the recovery rate is large.

3.2.1

Local stability of the DFE

We give the formulae of the basic reproduction number, R0 , for the density-dependent model, using again
17

the next generation approach, developed in [30]. Then, derive bounds on R0 in term of the connectivities of
patches.
Using the notations in [30], the matrices F and V , for the new infections and the remaining transfers,
are defined analogously as for the frequency-dependent model except that
F1 = β(1 − q)diag(S 0 )

and

F2 = βqdiag(S 0 ).

Similarly, the techniques used in the previous subsection can be used to compute the basic reproduction
number of the density-dependent model (20). Hence, Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 can be used to find the spectral
radius of the following matrix:
L

= β diag(S 0 )



In + δ ξ V22 D−1 [(1 − q) V21 + q V22 ] + ξ δ V22 D−1 [(1 − q)V11 + qV12 ] ,



= β a8 diag(S 0 ) + b8 diag(S 0 ) C ,

(22)

where a8 and b8 are defined as in Eq. (18). Thus


R0 = β ρ (a8 diag(S 0 ) + b8 diag(S 0 ) C .

(23)

Since the spectral radius of L is very difficult to compute, we shall only give some properties and estimates
of its eigenvalues owing to its specific form.
We point out that L is a sum of a diagonal matrix a8 diag(S 0 ) and a rang 1 matrix b8 diag(S 0 ) C. Moreover,
the diagonal elements of a8 diag(S 0 ) are positive and written in the increasing order. Thus, L can be
considered as a diagonal matrix perturbed by a rank-one matrix. Now, for a general interlacing theorem of
eigenvalues for perturbations of a diagonal matrix by rank-one matrices [33], the eigenvalues λk1 < λk2 <
. . . < λkn = λkmax of L interlace with the eigenvalues β a8 Sk01 < β a8 Sk02 < . . . < β a8 Sk0n of β a8 diag(S 0 )
as follows
β a8 Sk01 < λk1 < β a8 Sk02 < λk2 < . . . < β a8 Sk0n < λkn = λkmax .
Then, it follows that all the eigenvalues of L are real, simple, positive and the greatest one is λkmax = R0 .
Thus, the following inequality for R0 holds:
R0 > β a8 ρ0S,kmax .
Note that ρ0S,kmax is defined as
ρ0S,kmax =

Λ
[µhki + kmax DS ].
µhki(µ + DS )

Therefore, a sufficient condition for the DFE to be unstable is given by the following lemma:
Lemma 5 If
β a8

Λ (µ hki + DS kmax )
> 1,
µ hki (µ + DS )

then the disease-free equilibrium of the density dependent model is unstable.
18

(24)

Condition (24) implies that R0 > 1, which is a sufficient condition for the DFE to be unstable. Rearranging
condition (24) gives
ρ0S,kmax >

1
.
β a8

(25)

Condition (25) simply says that, if the number of individuals inhabiting those patches with highest
connectivity in the metapopulation, for fixed values of µ, γ, DE , DI , DR , δ, ξ, q, θ, β, d, γ, η and α, a
large enough ρ0S,kmax guarantee the instability of the disease-free equilibrium. This implies that the infection
reaches all patches.
Now, we prove that R0 is bounded above and below and give a sufficient condition of the instability of
the DFE in term of the average density of patches of lowest connectivities.
Observe that L is nonnegative (L ≥ 0) and Sk0 is an increasing function of the connectivity k. Thus

ρ0S,kmin guarantee the instability of the disease-free equilibrium. This implies that the infection reaches all
patches.
In summary, it is classically known that if R0 < 1, then the DFE is locally stable, and if R0 > 1, then it is
unstable. With this classic result in mind and the bounds on R0 giving by condition (24) and condition (28),
we have established the following result giving sufficient conditions for the instability of the DFE.
Theorem 1 : For the model with density-dependent model (20),
if the average density of patches with highest connectivities satisfies

then, the DFE is unstable.
Model of this type demonstrates clear infection threshold. In the presence of a threshold, disease eradication requires the reduction of the infection rate below a critical level where a stable infection-free equilibrium
is guaranteed. In epidemiological terminology, the infection threshold may be expressed in terms of the basic reproductive ratio R0 , the average number of infections produced by a single infected individual in a
population of susceptible. From this definition, it is clear that TB infection can spread in a population only
if R0 > 1.
In conclusion, crossing the threshold reduces the basic reproductive ratio R0 below unity and the infection
is prevented from propagating.
3.2.2

Endemic equilibrium

Herein, we investigate the existence of an endemic equilibrium of system (21) in the special case where
there is no re-infection after recovery (i.e. no flow from the recovered class to the latently infected class due
to infection), but with possible relapse from the disease.
To this end, it is more convenient to write system (21) in a more compact form. In a more compact form,
model (21) may be written as follows:

> R0 > 1. From the first equation of (33), one has

x∗ = P −1 (z ∗ )ΛI. Since P −1 (z ∗ ) is a positive definite matrix, one has x∗ > 0. On the other hand, since
z ∗ are the intersection points between the curve of H(z ∗ ) and the line z = 1, one has that z ∗ > 0. Then,
when R0 > 1, the equilibria are endemic. This means that there exists at least one endemic equilibrium of
the model (21). Also, note that z ∗ = B y ∗ is not a bijection (it is a onto map, but not a one to one map),
one can conclude that the TB model with simple mass action transmission could have multiple endemic
equilibria. However, to know the number of endemic equilibria, we need to analyze the function H(z ∗ ). We
stress that Eq. (39) is very difficult to solve analytically due to the fact that H is a highly nonlinear function.
23

Nonetheless, one can numerically plot this curve and examine how the intersection point(s) with the line
z = 1 change with model parameters. We have established the following theorem for the density-dependent
model (21).
Theorem 2 : For the model with density-dependent model (20), if the basic reproduction number R0 > 1,
then there exists at least one endemic equilibrium.
3.2.3

Numerical studies

To illustrate the various theoretical results contained in the previous section, system (20) are simulated
using the parameter value/range in Table 1. In all simulations, the initial conditions have been chosen
randomly. We have also taken a metapopulation with scale-free distribution p(k) ∼ k −3 with hki = 6 and
kmin = 3.
Figure ?? gives the evolution of the model (20) when β = 0.0001 and DS = DE = DI = DR = 1 (so that
R0 < 1). All other parameters are as in Fig. ??. Figure ??(a) presents the prevalence curves of the model
while, the time evolution of the number of infected individuals in each patch is depicted in Fig. ??(b). From
these figures, it clearly appears that the disease disappears in the host population even for higher values of
the patch connectivity.
Figure ?? gives the evolution of the model (20) when β = 0.001 and DS = DE = DI = DR = 1 (so
that R0 > 1). All other parameters are as in Fig. ??. From this figure, one can observe that the disease
persists in the host population. In addition, one can also observe that as the patch connectivity increases,
the prevalence of the infection also increases.
Now, let us examine the influence of the migration on the propagation of TB in the host population.
Figure ?? presents the prevalence of the infection of model (20) in nodes of degree k of an uncorrelated
scale-free network for different values of the migration rates. From this figure, the role of the migration rates
DS , DE , DI and DR is remarkable. Increasing the value of the migration rates DS , DE , DI and DR causes
a reduction in the prevalence of the infection. This is the only case we have observed in which the infection
prevalence changes non-uniformly across the metapopulation when varying the value of a parameter.

4

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a system of differential equations of reaction-diffusion type describing

the TB spread in heterogeneous complex metapopulations. The spatial configuration is given by the degree p(k) and the conditional probabilities P (k | k ′ ). For uncorrelated networks under the assumption of
standard incidence transmission, we have computed the disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproduction
number. We have also shown that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. Moreover,
for uncorrelated networks and under assumption of simple mass action transmission, necessary and sufficient

24

conditions for the instability of the disease-free equilibrium for uncorrelated networks have been given in
term of the highest and lowest connectivities of patches. We have also shown that if the basic reproduction number R0 > 1, then the simple mass action model could have multiple endemic equilibria. Through
numerical simulations, we found that the prevalence of the infection increases with the path connectivity.
Also, increasing the value of the migration rates cause a reduction in the prevalence of the infection.
