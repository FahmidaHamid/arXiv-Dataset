Empirical evidence shows that the rate of irregular usage of English verbs exhibits discontinuity
as a function of their frequency: the most frequent verbs tend to be totally irregular. We aim
to qualitatively understand the origin of this feature by studying simple agent–based models of
language dynamics, where each agent adopts an inflectional state for a verb and may change it upon
interaction with other agents. At the same time, agents are replaced at some rate by new agents
adopting the regular form. In models with only two inflectional states (regular and irregular), we
observe that either all verbs regularize irrespective of their frequency, or a continuous transition
occurs between a low-frequency state where the lemma becomes fully regular, and a high frequency
one where both forms coexist. Introducing a third (mixed) state, wherein agents may use either form,
we find that a third, qualitatively different behavior may emerge, namely, a discontinuous transition
in frequency. We introduce and solve analytically a very general class of three–state models that
allows us to fully understand these behaviors in a unified framework. Realistic sets of interaction
rules, including the well-known Naming Game (NG) model, result in a discontinuous transition, in
agreement with recent empirical findings. We also point out that the distinction between speaker
and hearer in the interaction has no effect on the collective behavior. The results for the general
three–state model, although discussed in terms of language dynamics, are widely applicable.

INTRODUCTION

Language is structured by rules [1, 2] - but linguistic
rules often have exceptions. This fact kindled a longstanding debate in cognitive science centering on how
individual learners accommodate rule sets rife with exceptions (e.g., see Refs. [3, 4]). However, how exceptions
arise and evolve over time within a language system remains a largely open question.
The study of the English past tense is widely used as
an exemplar of the interplay between rules and exceptions [5–8]. A recent study of historical corpus data [9]
looks at rules in the language system rather than individual learners, shedding light on the relationship between
the verb frequency and regularity (Fig. 1). Each verb
in the language can be characterized by I, the fraction
of irregular past tense tokens over the total number of
tokens in the past tense, and ν, its frequency of usage.
An interesting transition is found in the behavior of I
as a function of ν: regular verbs dominate the low frequency range, while most irregular verbs are located at
higher frequencies (see also Refs. [10, 11]). For intermediate values of ν fully regular (I = 0) and fully irregular
(I = 1) verbs coexist. Only a small subset of verbs exhibit both regular and irregular forms (0 < I < 1), and
occur primarily in a rather narrow range of frequencies
between the dominant regular and irregular states.
The work presented in this paper takes a theoretical
approach to the relationship between rules and exceptions in a population of interacting speakers. We investigate the dynamics of a set of very simple agent-based
models aimed at describing the fundamental mechanisms

by which rules and exceptions may be shared or disappear
in a population, in the same spirit of the Naming Game
(NG) [12, 13] investigations of the emergence of shared
naming conventions. We consider a single lemma and examine two-state and three-state models. In a two-state
model, an individual has an internal inflectional inventory which can contain either the regular (R) or irregular
(I) inflection for the lemma. In a three-state model, the
inflectional state can be either R, I or mixed (M). The
mixed state represents intra-speaker variation [14], where

2
an individual may accommodate both regular and irregular forms for a single word [15]. For example, there is evidence that regular and irregular past tense verb forms are
simultaneously known and potentially used in seemingly
free variation within a single speaker (e.g., both sneaked
and snuck are acceptable [15]). Agents are endowed at
the start of the dynamics with some inflectional state for
the word and engage at rate ν in pairwise interactions, i.e.
one of them utters the verb under consideration and the
other listens to it. During interaction, the inflectional
states of the speaker and hearer change according to a
pre-defined set of interaction rules. In addition to interaction events, we implement a replacement mechanism:
at rate r an agent is replaced with a “child” who engages in overregularization: these “child” agents assume
the regular inflection applies to all words in the vocabulary, representing a known bias of child learners, [16–18].
Replacement represents turnover in the population: as a
child learner enters, an adult leaves (i.e., is replaced), so
that the population size remains constant.
We first approach some specific models analytically,
within the framework of mean-field theory. This analytical approach allows for quantitative predictions regarding
which state a population of speakers will reach given a
particular set of interaction rules and the type of transition which may occur depending on the ratio between
the frequency and replacement rates. It turns out that
different interaction rules lead to qualitatively different
types of behavior. Two-state models lead to total regularization or to a continuous transition as a function of
r/ν. Three-state models, on the other hand, have the
potential to exhibit a discontinuous transition with some
highly frequent, mostly irregular words, reminiscent of
findings in empirical data. To understand these variations and understand their origin, we introduce a very
general three-state model, encompassing all possible sets
of interaction rules that do not favour either the regular or irregular state in their outcome. We provide a
formal solution for any value of the model parameters
and study in detail the conditions under which no transition (i.e., total regularization) occurs, and the conditions
under which we observe a continuous or discontinuous
transition. Our analysis also shows that assuming asymmetric influence of the speaker over the hearer in the
interaction has no effect on the collective behavior. The
results for this general model are discussed in terms of
language dynamics, but their applicability is fully general: they give the solution for any three-state model of
population dynamics with unbiased interaction rules and
biased replacement.

II.

TWO-STATE MODELS

Let us start by considering two-state models, where
each individual can be found in one of two possible rule
states, regular (R) or irregular (I). While in this case
the two states represent regular and irregular inflections,

this framework can represent any set of binary options
(e.g., the choice between two possible words to name an
object, two alternative opinions on a given topic, etc.).
As a specific example, the Abrams-Strogatz model [19]
used a two–state approach to examine the dynamics of
endangered languages, providing a prime example of the
dynamics of languages in competition more generally.
Using this general two–state model approach, we focus here on the binary options of regular (R) or irregular (I) inflection for a single word, characterized by
its frequency of usage, ν. At each interaction step two
agents are selected at random (i.e., mixing is homogeneous) and assigned the role of either speaker or hearer.
With probability ν they engage in a pairwise interaction
(i.e. the speaker utters the verb under consideration to
the hearer), which affects their inflectional states according to specific interaction rules. Then, with probability r
one individual in the population is replaced with a “child”
having its inflectional state set to R. This part of the dynamics mimics the turnover of some segment of the adult
population into child learners at rate r, keeping the population size N fixed, and assuming over-regularization
behavior in new learners. In this way the population
replacement is biased towards one of the two options, in
this case, regularity. The quantity 1/r can be interpreted
as the life expectancy of an individual in the population.
Among the possible two–state interaction rules, we
consider the sets presented in Table I. In the Irregular–
biased (A) and Regular–biased (B) models, the speaker
and the hearer roles are symmetric; in other words, which
agent identifies as speaker or hearer is irrelevant, but the
presence of an I(R) state in the interaction leads the rules.
In A(B) an agent switches to the I(R) state whenever interacting with a partner in the I(R) state, regardless of
which agent is the speaker and which the hearer. In these
cases the speaker can affect the hearer’s state, and the
hearer can also affect the speaker’s. In the Speaker leads
model (C) the roles are not symmetric: the speaker never
changes its state and the hearer always adopts the state
of the speaker.
The Irregular–biased model is perfectly equivalent to
one of the most fundamental models of non–equilibrium
statistical physics: the contact process [20]. The temporal behavior of this model is easily understood by writing
down the mean-field evolution equation for the density ρI
of individuals in the I state (the density of R individuals,
ρR , being trivially 1 − ρI )
ρ̇I = −rρI + 2νρI (1 − ρI ).

The solutions for the Regular–biased and Speaker leads
models are obtained from Eq. (2) by simply replacing
n → −n and n → ∞, respectively, and both result in
an exponential relaxation to the stationary fully regular
state (ρI = 0) for any physical value of n. Unlike in case
A, in these two cases the interaction rules are biased in
favor of R (case B) or unbiased (C) and they cannot compensate for the increase in R states due to replacement,
leading to a fully regular absorbing state.
As it will be demonstrated in Sec. IV A, no two-state
model can give rise to a discontinuous transition between
the fully regular state and a state with ρI > 0. Empirical data, however, exhibit such a discontinuous transition, and research shows that speakers can accommodate regular and irregular forms simultaneously [15]. For
these reasons, we now turn our attention to a more complex modeling scheme that integrates a third, mixed state
(M), wherein agents accommodate either the R or I. We
will show that introducing this, psychologically plausible,
mixed state, a qualitatively different behavior appears,
namely, a discontinuous transition in regularity, reminiscent of empirical data.

III.

THREE-STATE MODELS

In three–state models there are still only two alternative inflections that can be applied to a word (R and I)
during an interaction event, but internally, each individual can be in one of the three possible states: R (regular), I (irregular) and M (mixed). In the mixed state the
individual can accommodate both R and I forms; this accounts for agents undecided on which is the correct form
to use, or that consider both the regular and the irregular
form acceptable.
The study of three-state models has a long history
in the investigation of language dynamics (for a re-

view see [21]). In particular, Wang and Minett proposed [22, 23] deterministic models for the competition
of two languages, that included a third potential state of
bilingual individuals. Castelló et al. [24] proposed a modified version of the voter model [25, 26] to examine language which included bilingual individuals, the so-called
AB model. Synonymy, the possibility for having multiple
potential names for a single meaning (much like multiple
inflections for a single verb as in the mixed state) has
also been examined in the classic Naming Game (NG)
model [12, 27]. The Naming Game and its variants have
examined structures of increasing complexity, often including agents who can have multiple internal states,
from the categorisation of colors [28, 29] to basic syntactic structures [30].
We now study the dynamics of three specific examples
in the class of three-state models, with different microscopic rules leading to qualitatively different behaviors
(see Table II). The first set of rules is known as the Naming Game.

A. The Naming Game with biased replacement: A
three–state model with a discontinuous transition

The interaction dynamics of the Naming Game with
three states are as follows: first, at each time step a
speaker and a hearer are selected at random. With the
probability ν they interact; the speaker conveys to the
hearer either the R or I form depending on his inventory (if in the mixed state he utters R or I with equal
probability). If the hearer’s inventory contains the inflection used in the utterance, both agents update their
inventories keeping only the form involved in the interaction. Otherwise, the hearer adds the form to his inventory (thus switching to the mixed state). Table II
(first four columns) summarizes these interaction rules.
In addition to these rules, the population turnover is implemented as in the previous two-state models: at each
time step an individual is selected at random and, with
probability r, is replaced by a new individual in state R.
In a generic three-state model, two densities are needed
to specify the global state of the system. We choose

TABLE II. Interaction rules for the three examples of three-state models. The two columns on the left refer to the status of
speaker and hearer prior to the interaction. The following three pairs of columns refer to the status of speaker and hearer after
the interaction for the three different rule sets: the Naming Game (NG), the Continuous Transition (CT) model and the No
Transition (NT) model. When two alternative inflections are possible because of a mixed state, the probability of each of them
is 1/2. In the only case with three alternative outcomes (I,I) and (R,R) occur each with probability 1/4, while (M,M) occurs
probability 1/2.

ρI and ρR , the density of the mixed state being ρM =
1 − ρR − ρI . The mean-field equations for the Naming
Game with biased replacement are:
(
ρ̇I = −rρI + ν(1 + ρ2R − 2ρR − ρI )
(4)
ρ̇R = r(1 − ρR ) + ν(1 + ρ2I − 2ρI − ρR ).
Notice that the equations for the usual Naming Game
with three states [12, 31] are recovered by setting r = 0
and ν = 1. Imposing the stationarity condition, after
some algebra one finds that the density of individuals in
the irregular state is given by the fourth order equation

i.e., the original Naming Game. The model exhibits a
discontinuous transition between a phase (high values of
n = r/ν) where, whatever the initial condition, the stationary state is fully regular and a phase (low values of
n) where both the fully regular state (solution (1)) and
a state with a large fraction of irregulars (solution (2))
are stable. As depicted in Figure 3, the initial condition
determines which one of the two states is asymptotically
reached. In particular if the initial condition is above
the separatrix corresponding to the attractive direction
(thick red line) all individuals converge to the fully regular state (solution (1)); on the other hand if the initial
condition is below that separatrix the system converges
(2)
(2)
to the solution (2) where a fraction ρI (ρI = 1 for
the case with no replacement, n = 0) of irregulars coexists dynamically with regular and mixed individuals.
Only initial conditions exactly on the separatrix (thick
red line) lead to convergence to solution (3). The predictions of the MF theory are confirmed by numerical
simulations of the actual agent-based model (Fig. 2).
In summary, the Naming Game with biased population
replacement exhibits a discontinuous transition as a function of n. The discontinuity also implies a dependence of
the final steady state on the initial condition which provides a theoretical justification for the observation of a
range of frequencies where both fully regular and mostly
irregular verbs exist (see Fig. 1). For every frequency
in this interval, verbs will converge to the fully regular
state (1) or to the mostly irregular state (2), depending
on the initial values of ρR and ρI . This phenomenology

6
is in agreement the empirical findings reported in [9] of
the existence of a discontinuous transition between regular and irregular forms as a function of the frequency of
usage.

three real solutions. One of them is, for any n, the fully

for n ≤ nc = ( 17 − 3)/4 ≈ 0.2807. In such a case

Model NT: A three-state model without a
transition

Let us now focus on another set of rules, reported in
Table II, column NT. Consider the case in which an individual in the mixed state M is undecided about which one
of R and I is acceptable, and let the interactions between
speaker and hearer be symmetric. When an individual in
a state I interacts with one in a state R both become confused on which form is right and therefore both switch to
M. When an individual in a state M interacts with one in
a state I or R, the outcome of the interaction depends on
which form the individual in the mixed state uses: if it is
the same one used by his partner (with probability 1/2)
then nothing changes, if it is the alternative one (with
probability 1/2) then the partner becomes confused and
also switches to the mixed state M. Interactions among
individuals both in the same state I or R do not produce
any change. The outcome of an interaction among two
individuals in a state M depends on which form they use:
if they both use the regular inflection (with probability
1/4) they both switch to status R, if they both use the
irregular inflection (probability 1/4) they both switch to
status I, if they use different inflections (probability 1/2)
they both remain in the mixed state M, coherently with
the rules regulating the outcomes of the previous interactions.

7
It is easily seen that under this rule set the system
converges to the fully regular state for any value of the
ratio r/ν. The MF equations are:

Summing and subtracting the first equation from the second, one obtains
(
ẏ/ν = n(1 − y)
(17)
ẋ/ν = n(1 − x) − 2x + y 2 + 1
which shows that, for n > 0 the fully regular state
ρR = 1, ρI = 0 is the only possible stationary state.
The conclusion is that, for any value of ν (and n > 0),
this set of rules always leads to a completely regular state
for all individuals.
Unlike the previous models this one is discontinuous
in the limit n → 0: the model with replacement does
not converge in the limit of vanishing replacement to the
model with n = 0. It is easy to see that in the case n = 0
from Eq. (17) ẏ ≡ 0; therefore the unbalance y0 between
ρI and ρR present in the initial condition is preserved
during the dynamics, while x converges to (1 + y0 )/2.
Therefore the stationary state is continuously dependent
on the initial condition, and given by ρR = (1 + y0 )2 /4,
ρI = (1 − y0 )2 /4, which gives the fully regular solution
only as long as the system is initiated in the fully regular
state.
To conclude this section, we observe that in three–state
models different microscopic interaction rules give rise
to qualitatively different behaviors. In the next section
we present a general approach to the modeling schemes
presented so far, clarifying why they give rise to different
phenomenologies.
IV.

GENERAL THEORY

In this section we present a very general three–state
model that provides a unified framework for generic sets
of interaction rules, and we solve it analytically within
the mean-field approximation. This framework allows us
to comprehend the origin of the different behaviors found
in the specific models investigated in the previous sections, providing a complete understanding of the global
phenomenology of three-state models. We start by considering a general two–state model first, as this elucidates
why the more complex three–state model is needed and
how it behaves. We then consider a very general threestate model, encompassing all models considered before
as particular cases. This approach will clarify a number
of general points. In particular it will show how the nature of the transition for both two and three–state models
depends on the microscopic rules, and clarify the role of
asymmetries in the behavior of the speaker and hearer in
the communication process.

A.

General two–state model

Each individual is either in state R or I. At rate r
each individual is replaced by one in state R. At rate ν
an interaction occurs among two randomly selected individuals, the speaker and the hearer. We indicate the
state of the pair of individuals in interaction as (X,Y),
where X is the state of the speaker and Y of the hearer.
As reasonable, we assume that nothing happens if the
two individuals are in the same state [(R,R) → (R,R),
(I,I) → (I,I)]. We first consider the case of deterministic
rules, i.e., the state at the end of the interaction is fully
determined by the initial state. Starting with the state
(R,I) we parametrize the interaction rule by means of the
coefficient γRI , which gives the variation in the number
of individuals in state I. For example, for the interaction [(R,I) → (R,R)] γRI = −1, while for [(R,I) → (I,I)]
γRI = 1. Analogously, when the initial state is (I,R) the
rule is parametrized by γIR .
The mean field equation for this process is simply
ρ̇I = −rρI + ν(γRI + γIR )ρI (1 − ρI ).

(18)

Obviously ρR = 1 − ρI . It follows immediately from
Eq. (18) that assuming distinct asymmetric roles between speaker and hearer has no effect whatsoever on
the collective behavior, since only the cumulative coefficient γ = γRI + γIR enters the equation. The distinction
between hearer and speaker is therefore irrelevant and
any model defined by an asymmetric set of rules behaves
exactly as its symmetrized version. This observation allows to specify any two-state model by means of just one
parameter, γ, with values between -2 and 2.
The general solution of Eq. (18) is obtained by replacing n with 2n/γ in Eqs. (2) and (3). The sign of γ determines the nature of the transition: for γ > 0 (rules biased
in favor of I) there exists a continuous transition with
nc = γ, while for γ ≤ 0 (rules unbiased or biased against
I) there is no transition, and the fully regular state is
the only stationary solution. Therefore we conclude in
general that the system is driven towards a fully regular
state unless a bias in the interactions compensates for
the increase in the R population due to replacement.
In the most general case, the outcome of each interaction is decided probabilistically. In this case γIR and γRI
are defined as the average increase in I states in the interaction, each of them assuming any real value in [−1, 1].
Correspondingly γ can assume any real value in [−2, 2].
It is immediate to realize that the dynamics is again described by Eq. (18) and all the above conclusions hold.

B.

General three–state model

As demonstrated explicitly in the case of two–state
models, asymmetric interaction rules (such as those in
Table II) produce exactly the same behavior as their
symmetrized version also in three–state models. It is

8
therefore possible to express all possible interaction rules
among individuals in a way analogous of what we have
done for the two–state case. Let us define γi , φi , and δi
as the average variation in the number of individuals in
state I, R or M respectively, occurring when an interaction of type i takes place. We will denote with i = 1 the
interactions with initial state (I,R) and (R,I), i = 2 for
(R,M) and (M,R) , i = 3 for (I,M) and (M,I) , i = 4 for
(M,M). As above, we are assuming that no change occurs when two individuals in state R (or two individual

(

in state I) interact. The interaction is instead nontrivial
in the case (M,M). Conservation of the number of individuals implies γi +φi +δi = 0, for any i = 1, 2, 3, 4, which
reduces the number of independent parameters from 12
to 8. Notice that these quantities may be non–integer
when we allow for different possible final states from a
given initial state (each with a given probability).
With this parametrization of the dynamical rules we
can write the rate equations for the evolution of the system in the most general case:


	
ρ̇I /ν = −nρI + 2γ1 ρI ρR + 2γ2 ρR [1 − (ρI + ρR )] + 2γ3 ρI [1 − (ρI + ρR )] + γ4 [1 − (ρI + ρR )]2

	
ρ̇R /ν = n(1 − ρR ) + 2φ1 ρI ρR + 2φ2 ρR [1 − (ρI + ρR )] + 2φ3 ρI [1 − (ρI + ρR )] + φ4 [1 − (ρI + ρR )]2

where n = r/ν is the rate of the replacement process
relative to the frequency of interaction.
We now focus on the case of unbiased interactions that
do not favor either the regular or the irregular form of
the verb. In other words the interaction rules are perfectly symmetric under the exchange between R and I;
the only mechanism that breaks the symmetry between
the regular and the irregular form is replacement, which
favors the diffusion of the former. This choice is based
on the observation that, while in the two-state case unbiased interaction rules always drive the system towards
the fully regular state, the existence of a mixed state allows the survival of the irregular form even for some R–I
symmetric interactions. This can be deduced from the
three models presented in the previous section, which all
have unbiased rules yet exhibit three qualitatively different behaviors. Hence symmetric interaction rules are
general enough to lead to continuous or discontinuous
transitions or to the absence of any transition.
The assumption of unbiased interaction implies the following additional relations among the parameters:
φ1 = γ1 ,

φ 2 = γ3 ,

φ3 = γ2 ,

φ4 = γ4 ,

(20)

thus reducing the number of free parameters to 4 (we
choose to use the four γi ). The values of these parameters
are not arbitrary. An (R,I) interaction cannot produce
an increase in the number of individuals in the I state,
since the same change must occur also for individuals in
the R state, since γ1 = φ1 : hence γ1 ≤ 0. In the same
interaction the number of irregulars cannot decrease by
more than 1: −1 ≤ γ1 . With similar considerations it is
not difficult to verify that the γi parameters are bounded
as follows:

(19)

state, and the excess fraction of R states with respect to
I states, respectively:
(
ẋ/ν = ax2 + cy 2 + 2dx + f
(22)
ẏ/ν = (2(γ3 − γ2 ) − n)y − 2(γ3 − γ2 )xy + n
where
a = γ1 − 2(γ2 + γ3 ) + 2γ4
d = (γ2 + γ3 ) − 2γ4 − n/2

c = −γ1
f = 2γ4 + n.

(23)

Physically sensible solutions must be in the range 0 ≤
x ≤ 1 and −x ≤ y ≤ x. Notice that c ≥ 0, f ≥ 0,
while the sign of a and d may vary and the coefficients
are related by
a + c + 2d + f = 0 .

(24)

Equation (24) implies that, for any choice of the parameters, (x, y) = (1, 1) [which corresponds to the fully regular
state (ρR = 1, ρI = 0)] is always a stationary solution of
Eq. (22). By imposing stationarity in Eqs. (22), other
stationary solutions can be determined. For specific values of the parameters γi it is always straightforward to
solve analytically for the stationary solutions of Eqs. (22)
(which boils down to the solution of a third-order algebraic equation) and study their behavior as a function of
n.
In the following we derive instead in full generality conditions on the parameters γi for the existence, as a function of n, of a continuous transition, a discontinuous one
or no transition at all.

Case γ3 = γ2 : No-transition

− 1 ≤ γ1 ≤ 0, 0 ≤ γ2 ≤ 2, −1 ≤ γ3 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ γ4 ≤ 1. (21)
Introducing the relations (20) in Eqs. (19) it is possible
to write Eqs. (19) in a particularly simple form by defining the auxiliary quantities x = ρR + ρI and y = ρR − ρI ,
which represent the fraction of individuals in an unmixed

Let us first consider the special class of models with
γ3 = γ2 . In this case the second of Eqs. (22) trivially
yields at stationarity y = 1, giving the two solutions
(x1 , y1 ) = (1, 1) and (x2 , y2 ) = (−(2d + a)/a, 1). The second solution is always unphysical. Indeed, from Eq. (24)

where  = n/[2(γ3 − γ2 )]. The solutions of Eq. (25) are
given by the intersections between two conic sections C1

x = 1 − . Depending on the sign of , the two branches
of the hyperbola lie in different quadrants with respect
to the asymptotes (see Fig. 5). In the limit  → 0, which
corresponds to the case with no replacement, the hyperbola degenerates into the pair of asymptotes, y = 0 and
x = 1. The conic section C1 is an ellipse for a > 0 and an
hyperbola for a < 0, turning into a parabola for a = 0,
with axes in all cases parallel to the Cartesian coordinate
system. The intersections of C1 with the y = 0 axis are,

In particular, x2 > 1 if a > 0 and x2 < 0 if a < 0. In
the limit a → 0, x1 → −f /(2d) (which is the intersection
point for the parabolic case a = 0) while x2 → ±∞,
depending on the sign of a. Hence, despite the change
in the global behavior for different values of a, C1 has

it follows that −(2d + a) > 0. Hence x2 is smaller than
0 if a < 0. On the other hand, for γ3 = γ2 the value
of γ3 + γ2 is always positive, since γ2 ≥ 0. This implies
−(2d + a) > a so that x2 > 1 if a > 0. We conclude that
when γ3 = γ2 the only possible stationary state is the
fully regular one: no transition may occur. As shown in
Table III the NT model considered in the previous section
falls in this class of models, featuring γ2 = γ3 = 0. We
will see below that also the degenerate case γ1 = 0 implies no transition, irrespective of the value of the other
parameters.

interest. The circles denote the intersections other than the
fully regular solution.

0 ≤ x ≤ 1: it crosses the y = 0 axis for x = x1 and
is concave towards the right, passing through the two
points (x, y) = (1, 1) and (x, y) = (1, −1) for any value of
the parameters. Notice that also C2 always goes through
the point (x, y) = (1, 1), so that the fully regular state is
always a stationary solution.
We now investigate in full generality the possible existence of other stationary solutions, i.e. other intersections in the physical region. Only the case c = 0 (γ1 = 0)
needs to be treated separately, because the conic section
C1 degenerates into a pair of lines: (x − 1)(x + (2d +
a)/a) = 0, one (x = 1) on the boundary of the physical
region, the other outside it. The fully regular solution
(x, y) = (1, 1) is then the only stationary state, and there
is no transition. We will assume c 6= 0 in what follows.
γ3 > γ2 : Discontinuous transition. For γ3 > γ2
( > 0), the hyperbola C2 lies in the upper–right and

10
lower–left quadrants with respect to the asymptotes (see
Fig. 5). Notice that the vertical asymptote is always at
x < 1. Apart from the fully regular solution, one intersection occurs always for x < 0 or x > 1 and is thus
unphysical. Two other intersections may instead occur
between C1 and the lower–left branch of C2 . For large
n these intersections do not exist as it can be recognized by observing that for  > 1 the lower branch of
C2 has x < 0 while C1 has x > x1 > 0. However, when
n → 0, C2 shrinks towards its asymptotes x = 1 −  and
y = 0, while C1 does not change much. At some critical value n = nc , C2 starts intersecting C1 , so that for
n < nc there are two intersections (see Fig. 5), both in
the physical region because the derivative of C1 for x = 1
is −[1 + (d + f )/c] < −1. In this case the system undergoes a discontinuous transition at nc . Notice when these
two solutions exist they are in the region y ≤ 0, implying
that ρI ≥ ρR , i.e., the fraction of individuals in the I
state is larger than the fraction of those in the R state.
As indicated in Table III, the model NG, which features
γ3 − γ2 = 1/2, belong to this class and this explains why
it undergoes a discontinuous transition.
γ3 < γ2 : Continuous transition. For γ3 < γ2 ( < 0),
the hyperbola C2 lies in the upper–left and lower–right
quadrants (see Fig. 5). The lower branch has x > 1 −  >
1 and hence is unphysical. Therefore at most two of
the four solutions (the intersections of the upper branch
with C1 ) are physical. One of them is the fully regular
state. To investigate the location of the other intersection
one can compare the slope of the two conic sections for
x = 1. If the slope of C1 is larger than the slope of
C2 (which happens for large n) the second intersection
occurs for x > 1, it is unphysical and as a consequence
the fully regular state is the only stationary solution. If
n is reduced the slope of C1 at x = 1 decreases while
the slope of C2 grows. At a critical value nc the two
slopes are equal and for n < nc the second intersection
becomes physical (x < 1). We conclude therefore that
the system undergoes a continuous transition between a
fully regular state and a state with coexisting regular and
irregular individuals. Notice that in this case, since the
physical intersections have y ≥ 0, necessarily ρI ≤ ρR .
The value of nc is easily determined by the condition that
the two slopes are equal, and turns out to be

p
nc = (γ1 −γ2 −γ3 )± (γ1 −γ2 −γ3 )2 + 4γ1 (γ3 − γ2 ) (27)

which has always one positive value (the other being always negative), coherently with the fact that there is always a transition. Remarkably, the value of nc does not
depend at all on the coefficient γ4 , regulating the M-M
interaction. The model CT in the previous section has
γ3 = 0, γ2 = 1/4 and γ1 = −1/2 (see Table III). These
values explain
why it undergoes a continuous transition
√
at nc = ( 17 − 3)/4.

Stability analysis

So far we have shown that below some critical value
of n additional stationary solutions appear, beyond the
fully regular solution. To complete the demonstration of
the existence of phase-transitions we must analyze their
stability.
By linearizing Eqns. (22) around the solution (x∗ , y ∗ )
one gets:

For the fully regular state (x∗ , y ∗ ) = (1, 1) the eigenvalues of the stability matrix M can be evaluated explicitly
yielding
p
λ1,2 = [tr(M ) ± ∆1 ]/2
(29)
where the trace of the matrix is tr(M ) = γ1 − γ2 − γ3 − n
and ∆1 = (γ1 + γ2 + γ3 )2 − 8γ1 γ2 ≥ 0. Notice that ∆1
is independent of n and positive, implying that the two
eigenvalues are always real.
In the case γ3 > γ2 , both eigenvalues are negative, as
can be deduced by considering that tr(M ) (the sum of
the eigenvalues) is always negative (being the sum of four
negative terms) and det(M ) = n2 /4 − n(γ1 − γ2 − γ3 )/2 −
γ1 (γ3 − γ2 ) (the product of the eigenvalues) is always
positive for n > 0. This last condition can be understood
by considering that det(M ) is a parabola with upward
concavity and zeros for negative values of n [given by
Eq. (27)]. Hence, the fully regular state is always stable.
For small n, the two other solutions appearing in the
physical region are a saddle and a stable fixed point [see
Fig. (6)]: a discontinuous transition occurs.
In the case γ3 < γ2 , corresponding to a continuous
transition, det(M ) is positive for large n, but it changes
sign for n < nc [where nc is the only positive determination of Eq. (27)] thus implying that one of the eigenvalues
becomes positive. Hence, below the transition the fully
regular state corresponds to a saddle, while the other
solution appearing in the physical region is stable [see
Fig. (6)].
Finally, we remark that the parameters corresponding
to the Naming Game, considered in the previous section
as an example of models with discontinuous transition,
give ∆1 = 0, corresponding to two degenerate eigenvalues, and only one eigenvector. In this case the fully regular state is stable but defective: in principle arbitrarily
small changes of the parameters may result in a standard stable fixed point if ∆1 > 0, or in a stable spiral
when ∆1 < 0. This last case would change the physical picture, because spiralling trajectories would cross
the boundary of the physical domain before reaching the
fixed point, and therefore the physical system would be
driven toward the boundary of the physical region without reaching the fixed point. However, this possibility
is ruled out by the condition ∆1 ≥ 0 which holds for
physically sensible values of the parameters γi .

Wrap-up of the theory for the general model

The conclusions that follow from the theory presented
in this section are very general and simple. The existence and the nature of a transition depends only on the
sign of γ3 − γ2 . If γ3 > γ2 , as the frequency increases
a discontinuous transition occurs between a fully regular
state and a state with coexistence of fully regular and
mostly irregular inflections. If γ3 < γ2 , the transition is
instead continuous. If γ3 = γ2 , no transition occurs and
the system always reaches a fully regular state.
It is important to notice that the condition γ3 > γ2 has
a very natural interpretation in the context of language
dynamics. It simply means that (recalling that γ2 = φ3 )
an interaction between an individual in state M and one
in state I, will produce an increment in the use of the
irregular inflection larger than the increment in the use

of the regular inflection. The fact that this asymmetry
alone is sufficient to give rise to a discontinuous transition
is a strong indication of the relevance of these theoretical
modeling efforts for the interpretation of empirical data.

V.

CONCLUSIONS

This work has presented an investigation of agentbased models aimed at understanding the processes regulating the interplay between rules and exceptions in language dynamics. In particular, the models aim to investigate the observed behavior of verbs in natural language. Corpus data from natural language points to the
existence of a discontinuous transition as a function of
the frequency of usage: high frequency items are highly
irregular and low frequency ones are regular, while in

12
an intermediate frequency range coexistence between the
two behaviors is observed.
In the minimal models considered each agent is endowed with an inventory, containing the possible inflections (regular or irregular) of a lemma. Two processes
have the potential to change agents’ inventories over
time: interaction and replacement. In interaction, individuals influence each other, adding or deleting forms
from their inventories according to a specific set of interaction rules. In replacement events, agents are substituted by new “child” individuals, who are automatically
biased towards the regular form by being “born” with a
regular inventory.
We analyze two classes of models. In the first one each
individual may store in the inventory only one of the two
competing inflections, either the regular or the irregular
one. Three-state models instead integrate a mixed state,
which represents an individual who finds both the regular
and irregular forms acceptable. We solve these models
analytically within the mean-field framework and confirm the results by means of numerical simulations. We
first focus on a few specific models, including the Naming Game for language dynamics. The analysis reveals
that the the global phenomenology changes qualitatively
depending on the interaction rules: one can observe the
absence of a transition with a move to total regularity, a
continuous transition, or a discontinuous one. We then
consider a very general three-state model, encompassing
all previous examples as special cases, which allows the
description of the previous models with a set of four minimal parameters describing the interaction rules. From
this comprehensive approach several results follow:
(i) Asymmetries in the influence of the speaker and of
the hearer in interaction do not play any role in the collective behavior of the system.
(ii) In two-state models the fully regular state is the only
attractor unless the interaction rules are biased in favour
of the irregular inflection; the three-state models have
instead nontrivial behavior even when the rules are unbiased.
(iii) Allowing for a third state is crucial for the appearance of a discontinuous transition that cannot arise in
two–state versions of the model.
(iv) In three state models the quantity γ3 − γ2 rules the
macroscopic behavior by changing the nature of the transition: when γ3 > γ2 , a discontinuous transition is observed to a state where irregular inflection is prevalent
(ρI > ρR ); in the opposite case, when γ3 > γ2 a continuous transition is observed, to a state with 0 < ρR < ρI ;
in the case γ3 = γ2 there is no transition and the fully
regular state is reached for any frequency.
(v) In the case γ3 > γ2 , above the discontinuous transition the steady state depends on the initial condition:
verbs with the same frequency can end up as fully regular or mostly irregular, similarly to what is observed in
empirical data.
(vi) In the context of language dynamics, the condition
γ3 > γ2 is satisfied by sets of more plausible rules, so that

a discontinuous transition is to be expected.
This model provides a framework that could potentially be used to consider additional, more complex aspects of rule dynamics in language. In particular, empirical data shows that the growth of language contributes
to the expansion of regularity [9], since a core aspect of a
linguistic rule’s utility is that it can be generatively applied to new forms (e.g., the past tense of the neologism
selfie is uncontroversially selfied). Our model considers a
word’s frequency to be static over time; however, natural
languages are living, and populations, vocabulary sizes,
and turnover rates are not static. Furthermore, there
are other cognitive mechanisms beyond child learner biases that may contribute to regularity dynamics. General
memory constraints may contribute to the persistence of
highly frequent irregular forms [32], and adult learners
may possess qualitatively different regularization biases
from children [33]. Moreover, the use of a disordered
topology for the pattern of interaction, as opposed to the
homogeneous mixing assumed by the MF approach, combined with the interaction among the different lemmas in
the agents’ inventories may lead to different patterns of
regularization in frequency. Future models might also
consider another key aspect in the persistence of irregularity: the notion that irregular forms are not always
exceptions, but sometimes constitute sub-rules [34] (e.g.,
foot-feet/goose-geese, sing-sang/ring-rang). Our model
provides a basic starting point from which to consider
the complex dynamics underlying temporal trends of the
rules that form the core of language.
Finally, it is very important to stress that while models and results are presented in this paper in terms of
linguistic rule dynamics, they are fully general and apply
to any system where individuals have three possible internal states and the population exhibits turnover. The
results presented in this paper, and in particular the conditions determining the existence of a transition and its
nature, may have strong implications not only for linguistic rules, but also for all those systems.

(ρI ' 0.382, ρR ' 0.382) the eigenvalues are one positive (λ1 = 2.236) and one negative (λ2 = −4.236) and
this corresponds to a saddle point with an attractive and
a repulsive direction. The separatrix in Fig. 3 (left) in the
attractive direction corresponds to the eigenvector associated to the negative eigenvalue: ρR = ρI (the red line
in figure). The other separatrix is locally approximated

associated to the positive eigenvalue ρR = −ρI + 2ρI

if the initial condition is such that ρI < ρR (ρI > ρR )
the system will deterministically converge to the regular
(irregular) state. On the other hand if the initial condi-

In this appendix, we provide explicit proofs that the
intersections x1 and x2 of the conic section C∞ with the
axis y = 0 [see Eq. (26)] are always physical and always
unphysical, respectively.
Let us first consider the case a > 0. A crucial point
to recognize is that, since a + 2d = −(c + p
f ) < 0, if a
is positive d must be negative. Hence ∆ = d2 − af ≤
|d| = −d. As a consequence x1 =
p−(∆ + d)/a ≥ 0. The
(a + d)2 + ac implies,
alternative expression of ∆ =
since both a and c are positive, ∆ ≥ |a + d|. This means
that ∆ ≥ −(a + d) so that x1 = −(∆ + d)/a ≤ 1. It also
implies ∆ ≥ (a + d) which, inserted into the expression
x2 = (∆ − d)/a ≥ 1, yields x2 ≥ 1.
Theparguments are similar for a < 0. In this case
∆ = d2 − af ≥ |d| ≥ −d so p
that x1 = (−d − ∆)/a ≥
0. By the same token ∆ =
d2 − af ≥ d, implying
x2 = (∆ − d)/ap
≤ 0. Finally, to show that x1 ≤ 1 we
start from ∆ = (a + d)2 + ac ≤ |a + d|. The quantity
a + d is negative for a < 0, because a + 2d < 0 implies
2a + 2d < a < 0. Hence ∆ ≤ |a + d| = −(a + d) so that
x1 = −(d + ∆)/a < 1.
