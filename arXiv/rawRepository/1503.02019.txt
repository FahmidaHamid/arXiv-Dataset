Abstract
Objective. While ultrasound is largely established for use in diagnostic imaging and heating
therapies, its application for neuromodulation is relatively new and not well understood. The
objective of the present study was to investigate issues related to interactions between focused
acoustic beams and brain tissues to better understand possible limitations of transcranial
ultrasound for neuromodulation. Approach. A computational model of transcranial focused
ultrasound was constructed and validated against bench top experimental data. The models
were then incrementally extended to address and investigate a number of issues related to the
use of ultrasound for neuromodulation. These included the effect of variations in skull geometry
and gyral anatomy, as well as the effect of transmission across multiple tissue and media
layers, such as scalp, skull, CSF, and gray/white matter on ultrasound insertion behavior. In
addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to characterize the influence of acoustic properties of
intracranial tissues. Finally, the heating associated with ultrasonic stimulation waveforms
designed for neuromodulation was modeled. Main results. Depending on factors such as
acoustic frequency, the insertion behavior of a transcranial focused ultrasound beam is only
subtly influenced by the geometry and acoustic properties of the underlying tissues.
Significance. These issues are critical for the refinement of device design and the overall
advancement of ultrasound methods for noninvasive neuromodulation.

1. Introduction
Transcranial-focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging technology for non-surgical stimulation
of the human brain. tFUS offers a superior millimeter resolution compared to existing
technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which influences areas of the cortex
spanning several centimeters [1, 2]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that tFUS directed over
the somatosensory cortex in humans affects EEG amplitude, power, phase, and tactile behavior
[3, 4]. The intracranial manifestation of mechanical and thermal effects by tFUS depends on the
insertion behavior of ultrasound across the various layers of tissue. Additionally, it is still not
clear how the neuronal response couples to the exertions of ultrasound on neural tissue. An
understanding of both the insertion behavior of ultrasound across the tissue layers in the context
of neuromodulation and the coupled neuronal response is key to the continued advancement of
ultrasound stimulation methods. The objective of the present study was to investigate the
insertion behavior of tFUS for neuromodulation across the human head and quantify its
sensitivity to tissue domains, their parameters, and their geometry.
Focused ultrasound has previously been investigated for such applications as brain
tumor ablation, blood-brain barrier opening, and thrombolysis [5]. In these applications, it is
advantageous to deliver the desired level of ultrasound energy through an intact human skull to
the prescribed locations, especially for deeper subcortical regions. The intact skull though
represents the primary barrier to ultrasound. The high attenuation, diffusion, and refraction of
ultrasound waves in cranial bone compared to the neighboring tissues results in a significant
loss of energy and distortion of the transmitted ultrasound beam, and is the primary barrier to
high resolution transcranial ultrasound imaging [6]. To an extent, adaptive focusing techniques
are able to account for the defocusing effect of the skull [7], and is critical to the application of
high intensity focused ultrasound. In the context of neuromodulation though, despite bone
absorbing ultrasound almost 90 times more efficiently than soft tissue [8], the skull does not
pose such a dire obstacle to the transmission of sufficient energy for low intensity focused
ultrasound applications. In addition to the effect of tissue properties on ultrasound, it is also
important to demonstrate that ultrasound for neuromodulation does not heat the tissue. At low
intensities over short exposure times, ultrasound does not generate appreciable tissue heating,
and the mechanical effects of ultrasound used in neuromodulatory capacities has not been
reported to cause tissue damage [9-11]. Thus, as the safety of ultrasound has been extensively
investigated, and the insertion behavior of ultrasound characterized in the context of various
other applications, there is a need to explore the insertion behavior of tFUS and the heating
characteristics for the purposes of neuromodulation beyond the barrier of the skull. We

developed a computational model of tFUS for neuromodulation and used this model to explore
the insertion behavior of the ultrasound beam in the intracranial space. We evaluated several
paradigms to explore the sensitivity of focused ultrasound to tissue layers, their acoustic
properties, and their geometry.

2. Methods
We developed computational models of the human skull and superficial cortical layers, including
CSF, white matter, and gray matter, to evaluate the insertion behavior of tFUS across the skull
and the resultant intracranial maps of intensity and heating. The finite element method models
were constructed in COMSOL Multiphysics v4.3 (COMSOL, Burlington, MA) to calculate
pressure, intensity, and heat generation. By these methods, we were able to investigate the
subtle influence that various aspects of human biology impart on the behavior of tFUS.
The initial computational model recreated quantitative acoustic field mapping of focused
ultrasound transmitted through a hydrated fragment of human cranium, which has been detailed
previously [3]. Briefly, a calibrated hydrophone mounted on a motorized stage was used to
measure the acoustic intensity profile from the ultrasound transducer coupled to a skull
fragment in a 58 L acrylic water tank at a 400 µm spatial resolution. The ultrasound transducer
is a custom designed single-element focused transducer (Blatek, Inc., State College, PA) having
a center frequency of 0.5 MHz, a diameter of 30 mm, and a focal length of 30 mm. The
transcranial ultrasonic neuromodulation waveform used has been previously described [12, 13],
and has an acoustic frequency of 0.5 MHz, a pulse duration of 360 µs, and consists of 500
pulses delivered at a pulse repetition frequency of 1.0 kHz, resulting in a stimulus duration of
0.5 sec. As reported in Legon et al. 2014, we observed that transcranial transmission using this
setup results in a spatial-peak pulse-average intensity (ISPPA) of 5.90 W/cm2 [3].
To recreate this experiment in the computational environment, a two-dimensional
geometry with axial symmetry was created as shown in figure 1a. The left most edge was
specified as the axis of rotation, and the bottom most circular edge was specified as the single
element of the focused transducer which serves as the ultrasound source. The transducer
element is shaped with a focal length of 30 mm and an aperture diameter of 30 mm, simulating
the transducer used in bench top experiments within the water tank, and is similarly driven at a
frequency of 0.5 MHz. The normal displacement of the transducer element was specified as
13 nm, based on calculations involving the piezoelectric constant of the transducer element
materials and the ultrasonic neuromodulation waveform. Above the transducer element is a

plane of skull 5 mm thick, and the space between the transducer and skull was specified as
water. Beyond the skull layer the space was specified as water again, to recreate the conditions
of the bench top measurements. The material properties specified in each domain are detailed
in table 1, and geometries detailed in table 2. The sound velocity, density, thermal conductivity,
and heat capacity of the water domain is derived from the default material properties for water in
COMSOL.

To more finely resolve the pressure gradients in the focal area of the transcranial
domain, the mesh size was specified as 1/6 of the wavelength within an elliptical region
enclosing the focal point. A coarser mesh of 1/4 of the wavelength was specified in all other
regions. Additionally, the model is bounded along the top and sides by cylindrical perfectly
matched layers to absorb the outgoing ultrasound waves and prevent their reflection back into
the modeling domain. The model solved for the stationary acoustic field to determine the
acoustic intensity distribution in the materials with the further assumptions that acoustic wave
propagation is linear and that the amplitude of shear waves are nominal compared to those of
the primary, compressive waves. Shear waves are greatly attenuated by tissue compared to the
longitudinal waves in an ultrasound beam [20, 21].
The acoustic intensity magnitude was then used to calculate the heat source for thermal
simulations. Material properties were assumed to not change with temperature and that cooling
due to blood perfusion was negligible in model layers of biological tissue. For the computational
models recreating bench top experiments in the water tank, all domains were assigned an initial
temperature of 294 K, corresponding to room temperature. For computational models
investigating the stimulation and heating of biological tissue, all tissue domains were assigned
an initial temperature of 310 K, corresponding to body temperature. The time course of
application of the heat source was specified to mimic the transcranial ultrasonic
neuromodulation waveform. Heating was applied in 360 µs durations repeated at 1.0 kHz for
Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 6

0.5 sec. No heating was applied for an additional 0.5 sec to observe cooling of the tissue,
bringing total simulation time to 1 sec. The max time step of thermal simulations was set at 1/7
of the pulse duration, to resolve the heating and cooling between each application of an
ultrasound pulse.
Following comparison of the experimental acoustic field mapping to the representative
computational model, the model was then expanded to investigate how features such as
geometry and material properties influence the insertion behavior of transcranially-focused
ultrasound in humans. First the transcranial domain was given material properties of brain
tissue, as specified for gray and white matter in table 1. This offers a simplified model of the
effects of transcranial-focused ultrasound in humans and a baseline for comparisons to later
models. Next the skull layer was curved (figure 1b), given a radius of 17 cm, to deviate from the
idealized straight plane of the previous models, and decrease the effective mechanical coupling
between the transducer and skull.
Tissue layers for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and white matter were then
added above the skull layer (figure 1c) with the thicknesses and material properties stated in
table 1 and table 2. The thickness of layers was based on computational models of electrical
epidural motor cortex stimulation [19] and is specified in table 2. The thickness of the CSF layer
was derived from the sum of the thicknesses of the dura mater and CSF layers from previous
models of the precentral gyrus [18], as we were unable to find the relevant acoustic parameters
for the dura mater in literature for our models. Additionally, the CSF was assumed to have the
material properties of water, due to the lack of literature characterizing the parameters of
interest for our models. Sensitivity analyses were then run with the layered tissue model to
further explore the influence of these additional layers. Models scaling the attenuation
coefficient of white and gray matter by 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 were solved to
inspect its influence on the ultrasound beam profile and tissue heating. The scaling factor 1.4
was included as the attenuation coefficient of white matter has been reported to be 1.4 times
that of gray matter [22]. Additionally, the thickness of the CSF layer was scaled by 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 to inspect the influence of the material’s presence as CSF volume is known to
vary, such as due to age related loss of cortical volume [23]. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses
scaling the density and speed of sound properties of the gray and white tissue layers were run,
as the mechanical properties of cortical tissue have been shown to vary with age and disease
[24-26].
To gain insight on the influence of gyral geometry on the behavior of tFUS, we
constructed two-dimensional models of the precentral gyrus, including two adjacent sulci and

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 7

two neighboring gyri based on computational models of electrical epidural motor cortex
stimulation [19]. In addition to models with the sulci oriented perpendicularly to the skull (figures
1d), other models with sulci slanted thirty degrees were constructed (figure 1e). Maximum
element size within the gyral anatomy model domains was restricted to 1/6 the wavelength.
Additionally, bounding perfectly matched layer domains surrounded the modeling area on all
sides as ultrasound intensity profiles were solve for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mm transducer offsets
from the center line of the model. This modeling geometry assumes the plane of the model is
the plane of symmetry, representing the middle plane of an infinite slab. Attempts to extend the
model to three dimensions proved exceedingly computationally intensive and thus the model
was kept two-dimensional. While this planar, infinite slab, geometry is not representative of the
true geometry of the focused ultrasound transducer included on the bottom of the models, the
resultant pressure field is qualitatively representative of the beam profile at the center plane of
symmetry for the true geometry of the ultrasound transducer, and thus intensity profiles
examined as normalized quantitates. Furthermore, to allow fair comparison to a model without
gyral anatomy, another computational model similar to that of the layered cortex in figure 1c was
constructed but without a plane of symmetry, thus resembling the geometries of figures 1d and
1e, but without the sulci.
To quantify the area of stimulation by the focused ultrasound beam, the geometry of the
root mean squared intensity (IRMS) solved for from the FEM model was characterized for
intensities greater than the half maximum. This thresholding resulted in an elliptical profile that
served as the proxy for stimulated neural tissue in the computational model from which the area
was calculated, excluding any area that was not contained in the gray or white matter (e.g. the
CSF and skull). Additionally, the centroidal principal axes of the area moment of inertia of the
thresholded intensity profile was calculated to determine their principal angles to characterize
any deformation of the ultrasound beam. The length of the centroidal principal axes bounded by
the thresholded profile was also determined to help characterize the geometry of the proxy for
stimulated neural tissue.

3. Results
3.1. Computational model of acoustic water tank measurements
Calculations of intensity from a computational model were compared to experimental
measurements. A close up of experimental measurements in the region of focus and minimally
offset from the intracranial surface of the skull are shown in figure 2a and the intensities for a

similar area in the computational model shown in figure 2b. Characterization of the half
maximum intensity profile for both the computational and experimental models is shown in
figure 2c and 2d. To allow comparisons between the experimental and computational fields,
calculations of intensity within the skull layer were removed, as in figure 2b, and then the
experimental and computational models aligned according to the location of maximal intensity.
The absolute difference and relative error between the two data sets were then calculated, and
is shown in figure 3. The greatest absolute differences are in a small region immediately
adjacent to the skull, while all other regions, particularly at the focal region of the ultrasound
transducer, are notably low. These absolute differences are further reflected in the calculations
of relative error, figure 3b, where the errors are minimal solely in the focal region. The increase
in relative error outside the focal region is attributable to intensity values approaching zero in the
denominator of relative error calculations once outside of the focal region. Beyond the few
differences in intensity profiles between experimental and computational models likely due to
differences between ideal simulations and non-ideal observations, the qualitative similarity, and
particularly the good quantitative agreement within the region of focus, between the
computational and experimental profiles is reassuring of the model.

Figure 3. Comparison of the intensity field between models. (a) Calculation of the difference
between the intensities of the computational and experimental models. Note that at the region of
focus the differences are lowest, while differences are greatest at an off center location close to
the skull. (b) Relative error between the intensities of the computational and experimental
models. Note that within the region of focus that the relative error is low, while outside of the
region of focus the error increases. This is due to the denominator of the calculation being
composed of low intensity values that outside the region of focus are less than one.
The computational model also allows visualization of the profile of heat generation by
tFUS, which is not as readily observed in experimental preparations, and is shown in figure 4.
The heat generated in the skull is several orders of magnitudes greater than that generated in
the water domain, and follows the profiles of intensity from tFUS. The time course of
temperature change is shown in figure 4c. During US stimulation the temperature steadily rises
with a rate highly dependent on the spatial location relative to the focus of the ultrasound
transducer and the properties of the material exposed to ultrasound, with skull tissue heating up
considerably more than the transcranial water domain.

Note that heat is primarily generated in the skull adjacent to the US transducer. (b) Rise in

maximum intensity within the bone layer.

3.2. Model extension to homogenous brain tissue and curved skull surfaces
The transcranial water domain was then given material properties of brain tissue (white and
gray matter of table 1) to compare how the profiles of intensity and temperature change based
on the transcranial domain material. The intensity and heating of the cranial domain changed

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 12

minimally as a result of this material change. As shown in figure 5, the general shape of both the
intensity and heat profiles changes negligibly. Additionally, the maximum intensities and their
locations between water and brain transcranial domains with a planar skull differ minimally
(table 3). However, the maximal change in temperature in the transcranial domains differ by
orders of magnitude, and their y-coordinates differ by a few millimeters as well, due to the large
difference in attenuation coefficients between the two materials. The temperature increase due
to the change of the transcranial domain from water to brain tissue was about 50 fold, similar to
the 46 fold increase in attenuation coefficient in table 1. Additionally, changing the material
properties of the transcranial domain slightly altered the magnitude of intensity effects in the
cranial domain though it did not alter its heating behavior (table 3).

The skull layer was then changed to a circular arc to simulate a curved region of the
skull and alter the coupling with the ultrasound transducer face in a manner that could similarly
occur when placing the transducer on human skull. The resultant intensities and heat generation
following curvature of the skull layer are shown in figure 6, where the range of intensities and
temperature increases have been decreased in comparison to previous models with a planar
skull layer. Additionally, the maximum intensity was no longer located in the skull layer, though
the maximum temperature increase still occurred in the skull layer (table 3). The location of the
maximum intensity in the brain domain moved down approximately 0.5 mm following curvature
of the skull, though interestingly the location of maximum temperature increase did not change.
Contours of the intensity profiles were analyzed and are shown in figure 7. The curvature of the
skull results in a more compact region of high intensities at the ultrasound transducer’s region of
focus. The half maximum contour of intensity for the planar skull enclosed an area of 47.4 mm2,
while the curved skull decreased the enclosed area to 45.0 mm2. Additionally, the planar skull
produced a longer, thinner half max contour compared to the curved skull. Overall, the curved
skull further focused the US beam to produce a more compact region of maximal effects, albeit
at a lower magnitude compared to the planar skull.

Figure 6. Model of tFUS through a curved skull layer and into a brain tissue domain. (a)
Intensity profile within both the brain and skull layers. Note that the peak intensities are lower
than for the model with a planar skull layer, and are no longer within the skull layer but are now
within the focal region of the US transducer. (b) Profile of temperature increase within the brain
and skull layers. Note that heating in the brain layer is still relatively low compared to that
occurring in the skull. (c) Temperature increase within the brain domain. Note that the brain
tissue at the interface with the skull is being heated at a similar level as that at the focal region
of the US transducer. (d) Increase in temperature over time in the transcranial domain (upper
plot) and intracranial domain (lower plot). Increases in temperature over time in the brain tissue
domain are shown at the location of maximum transcranial intensity (black), and 1 and 2 mm
lateral to that (blue and red). Note that there is less heat generation as compared to the model
with a planar skull.

layers. (a) Intensity contours of tFUS through a planar and curved skull layer. Note that the
planar skull layer produced higher intensities and more elongated contours. (b) Half maximum
intensity contours. Note that the planar skull layer produced a greater thresholded area with a
longer major axis and an elevated centroid along the Y-axis. (c) Close up of half maximum
intensity contours.

3.3. Model extension to layered cortical tissue and sensitivity analyses
Layers for CSF, gray matter, and white matter were added following a planar skull layer to
further investigate the modulation of human cortex using focused ultrasound. The profiles of
intensity and temperature rise are shown in figure 8, which did not change in overall shape
compared to the previous homogenous brain model. The half maximum intensity contours are
also very similar, with the homogenous brain model only having a slightly longer elliptical profile
(by 0.19 mm) than the layered cortical model. Interestingly the maximum intensity in the skull
layer decreased while the transcranial maximum increased in the layered cortical model
compared to the homogenous brain (table 3). Between the cortical and homogenous models,

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 16

the max temperature increases were very similar, with the only difference being that the cortical
model’s location for max temperature increase was elevated 0.67 mm along the Y-axis. Thus,
the addition of a CSF layer between the skull and brain domains subtly influences the
magnitude of intensities in both the skull and brain domains, but does not alter the magnitude of
heat generation in either domain.

As we found sparse literature on the differing acoustical properties of the cortical layers,
sensitivity analyses were run to explore their impact on model behavior. The attenuation
coefficient of white matter has been reported to be 1.4 times that of gray matter by Kremkau and
colleagues [22], and after running simulations at a range of scaling factors we found that only for
factors greater than 2.0 for the white matter attenuation coefficient did the half maximum
intensity proxy for stimulation change noticeably. Overall, with increasing white matter
attenuation coefficient, the elliptical profile decreases in area (figure 9a). The maximum intensity
and temperature rise values in the skull and CSF did not change, but in the cortical tissue the
maximum intensity decreased while the heat generation increased, albeit only slightly across
the entire range (figure 9b). Interestingly, the elliptical profile of intensity did not change though
the profile of temperature rise did (figures 9c-9e). The location of maximum temperature
increase was located in the lower gray matter layer for the lowest two values of white matter
attenuation coefficient simulated, after which the location of the maxima elevated into the white
matter with a variation of about 1 mm as the attenuation coefficient continued to increase. The
elliptical profile of temperature increase also returned for these higher values of attenuation
coefficient. Overall, changes to the white matter attenuation coefficient between half and double
that of the gray matter minimally changes the profiles of intensity and temperature change in the
layered model of cortical tissue. Scaling of the attenuation coefficient of the gray matter (figure
10) had even less of an impact on the intensity profile of ultrasound compared to scaling white
matter’s coefficient (figure 10a), and produced a bimodal distribution of heat generation for high
values of attenuation coefficient in the gray matter (figure 10e).

(black), skull (blue), and CSF (red). Metrics were largely insensitive. (c) Location of the

change in location from the white matter to the gray matter. (d) Intensity profile (left) and rise in

The initial inclusion of a CSF layer between the skull and brain domains subtly
influenced the profiles of intensity and temperature increase in both the skull and brain domains.
To further explore the effect of CSF layer presence, a sensitivity analysis of CSF layer thickness
was run to explore the impact on model behavior. Regarding the area enclosed by the half
maximum intensity contour (figure 11a), the thickness of the CSF layer minimally impacted the
area enclosed, except for the case when the CSF was 15.5 mm thick. During this case of a very
thick CSF layer, intensities within the half maximum intensity threshold were present within the
CSF layer as well, reducing the area contained in brain tissue layers. The maxima intensity and
temperature increases in the skull were most sensitive to the thickness of the CSF layer (figure

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 20

11b), with the skull domain having a greater range of values (0.82 W/cm2 and 0.02°C)
compared to the brain domain (0.40 W/cm2 and 3.2e-4°C). The increase of maximal intensity
within the CSF with scaling factor is attributed to more of the focal region of ultrasound being
contained in CSF with increasing layer thickness. Additionally, the thickness of the CSF layer
readily influenced the location of maxima, with maxima increasing in elevation as the CSF
thickness increased (figures 9c-9e).

Sensitivity analyses of the density and sound velocity properties of the gray and white
matter layers revealed an interplay between all the model layers of skull, CSF, and gray/white
matter influencing all measurements of interest (figure 12). The sound velocity of the white
matter layer readily influences the ultrasound beam profile, as well as the maximal intensity in
the skull (figure 12a). Varying the density of white matter caused similar trends in the change of
maximal intensity and temperature values as the velocity, but influenced the half maximum
intensity contour much less (figure 12b). The sound velocity of the gray matter layer also readily
influences the ultrasound beam profile (figure 12c), with increasing half maximum contour area
with increasing sound velocity, an opposite trend compared to the white matter sound velocity.
Varying the density of gray matter (figure 12d) also caused a similarly oppositely sloped trend
affecting the half maximum intensity contour compared to varying the density of white matter.

3.4. Influence of gyral geometry on the US beam
Transcranial transmission of the focused US beam results in an elliptical focus that can be
deformed by the inclusion or proximity of sulci. These deformations are more qualitatively
apparent in the models of the slanted sulci, as at certain horizontal offsets the beam focus
spans across the CSF of sulci into the brain regions on either side (figure 13b). The
quantification of the half maximum intensity contours is shown in figure 14 to allow comparison
of the deformations to the US beam by gyral anatomies, as well as to a baseline comparison
point derived from a model with no sulci (‘NS’ in figures). Overall, the more the beam focus is
localized to a sulcus, the smaller the thresholded area and axes lengths compared to other
cases in models including sulci. This is especially notable in the model with perpendicular sulci,
where a horizontal offset of 6 mm, aligning the transducer well with a sulcus, results in a drop of
area of about 40 mm2 compared to the rest of the offsets (figure 14a).
Particularly noteworthy though, is that the absence of sulci in the model can result in a
decreased area of stimulation compared to models with sulci. This is shown well in the
comparison of the US beam focus in the model with no sulci to the beam focus in the model with
perpendicular sulci. Except for the case when the region of focus is centered on a sulci itself,
when the region of focus is either between two sulci or near one it results in greater areas of
stimulation compared to the model with no sulci (figure 14a). Also particularly noteworthy is that
the gyral anatomy did not typically result in sufficient deformation of the US beam focus to rotate
the centroidal principal moment axes by more than one degree. Only one particular offset with
rotated sulci (9 mm) managed to rotate the principal moment axis by more than one degree
(figure 14c).

Figure 14. Characterization of gyral geometry effects on the focused ultrasound beam.
Following thresholding of the intensity profiles, the resultant elliptical profiles were characterized
using area (a), axis length (b), and centroidal principal moment axis angle (c) to quantify the
effect of perpendicular (black line) and slanted (blue line) gyral anatomy with varying transducer
offsets on the focused US beam. These parameters are also compared to a similar layered
cortical model with no sulci (labeled ‘NS’ along x-axis, red diamond in graphs) to establish a
baseline free of gyral effects for comparison. Overall, when the ultrasound beam was focused in
a sulcus, the thresholded area and axes lengths decreased. However the angle of the major
axis was minimally perturbed by gyral anatomy.

4. Discussion
Transcranial focused ultrasound is an appealing approach for noninvasive neuromodulation of
cortical tissue for a wide variety of applications, including those with deeper cortical targets.
However, the improvement and adoption of ultrasound methods for neurostimulation is greatly
dependent on furthering our understanding of ultrasonic mechanisms, including its insertion
behavior across the skull. We developed a computational model of the resultant intensity
profiles of transcranially focused ultrasound based on acoustic tests in a water tank, and
extended the model to solve for the heating by the ultrasonic neuromodulation waveform. We
used the model to then explore the effect of tissue properties and model geometries on the
behavior of the ultrasound beam. To quantify the model response of ultrasound, we
characterized the ultrasound beam using half maximum intensity contours and their
corresponding area moments of inertia. While the relationship between ultrasound intensity and
stimulation of neural tissue is not established, the half maximum intensity contours provided a
quantitative measure of the model response to estimate the influence of tissues and geometry
on the region of effects by tFUS. By beginning to investigate and consider these issues in the

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 26

context of neuromodulation, we can advance the utility of focused ultrasound methods for
human neuromodulation.
To ensure that the computational models would be relatively accurate and credible, we
began with construction of a computational model recreating acoustic testing of tFUS in a water
tank. While it is possible to adjust the computational model to have an identical maximum
intensity value as that observed in the experimental measurements, obtaining an identical
profile of intensities is more difficult. Most notable in the difference between the computational
and experimental profiles of intensity in figure 2 is the warped region of moderately high
intensities near the inner surface of the skull and below the maxima. This may be largely
attributed to differences between the experimental approach and the idealized computational
model, namely the inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and slightly curved human skull fragment used
in the experimental tests. Unlike the idealized skull layer in the computational model, human
skull has an inhomogeneous curved structure with a varying density and thickness that is
compensated for in applications requiring very precise control of the transcranial distribution of
ultrasound [27, 28]. Outside of the region near the inner skull surface, at the focal region and far
field locations, the intensity profiles between the experimental and computational models are
qualitatively similar and we deemed the computational model an acceptable recreation of the
experimental observations for the purposes of this investigation.
Using the computational model we were also able to calculate the intensities within the
skull layer, and simulate the heat generation from focused ultrasound in both the cranial and
transcranial domains. The majority of heating takes place in the skull layer, largely due to the
fact that the attenuation coefficient of the skull is much higher than that of the water. In fact, the
model overestimates the heating of the transcranial water domain, as we used a value of
0.02 Np/m, while the attenuation coefficient of water at room temperature is closer to 6e-3 Np/m
based on reported data [29]. We used this larger value due to our representing CSF with the
same parameter set in later models, as the density and sound velocity of water were found to be
similar to that of CSF according to one source [30], and the CSF containing proteins and other
compounds likely increases the attenuation coefficient to some degree.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation is another form of noninvasive neuromodulation that
passes unimpeded through skull and whose manifestation of effects (electric fields) is
influenced by the geometry of neural tissue [2]. As reflected in the simulations of this work
though, tFUS seems to be manipulated in an opposite manner compared to TMS; the skull is
the barrier to transmission of energy by ultrasound and the geometry of neural tissue only
influences the manifestation of effects due to ultrasound (i.e. intensity and heating) subtly. As

Mueller et al., arXiv 2015 | Page 27

the properties of the skull (e.g. thickness, density, curvature) can vary over the expanse of the
cranium [28], this implies that the transcranial effects of US can vary with transducer placement
on the skull. Indeed, curvature of the skull layer in the computational model resulted in a 62%
drop in maximal transcranial intensity, and a 56% drop in transcranial heat generation. The drop
in effects by ultrasound within the skull layer was of an even greater scale, though they are not
of concern in regards to neuromodulation but merely as a safety check and possible means of
secondary effects. The influence of tissue geometry on the effects of US were quantified using
the half maximum intensity contours, and was found to have subtle effects. Overall, the region
of effects by US stayed at the focus of the ultrasound transducer, with CSF in sulci being the
source of subtle influence on the geometry of the intensity contours. This translates into the
targeting of US for neurostimulation not being variable with the intracranial geometry and thus
not being a significant concern for the design of an ultrasound transducer’s region of effects. In
comparison to TMS where the induced electric fields are on the scale of centimeters and
greatest at the gyral crown, but the effective electric field for neuronal stimulation is for elements
within the gyral walls [31], one can focus design efforts of an ultrasound transducer to have a
region of focus at the desired depth after accounting for the placement of the transducer on the
cranium. Additionally, differences in tissue properties between white and gray matter could have
a more substantial influence on the ultrasound beam, if the properties between the two differ
greatly due to developmental or pathological changes. Thus placement and targeting of the
ultrasound transducer are the primary factors of concern when applying tFUS, especially as the
scale of effects by tFUS are in the range of millimeters.
Overall, the intracranial manifestation of effects by US (intensity, heating) is more readily
controlled than the effects of TMS and other electromagnetically based noninvasive
neuromodulation methods. The profile of these manifestations though depends on the insertion
behavior of US across the various layers of tissue. As US offers the advantages of finer spatial
resolution and variable depths of stimulation compared to noninvasive electromagnetic methods
though, it is an appealing alternative to electromagnetic methods for a number of possible
applications. However, it is still not clear how the neuronal response couples to the exertions of
ultrasound on tissue. Using a computational model to systematically investigate parameters of
interest, we found that the profiles of intensity produced by tFUS is relatively insensitive to the
geometry of intracranial tissue, that the material properties of the intracranial tissue can
influence the intensity profile more substantially, and that the skull is a major source of influence
on the ultrasound beam profile. An understanding of both the insertion behavior of ultrasound

across the skull and the coupled neuronal response is key to the continued advancement of
ultrasound stimulation methods.
