Abstract
Topological entropy has been one of the most difficult to implement of all the entropytheoretic notions. This is primarily due to finite sample effects and high-dimensionality problems. In particular, topological entropy has been implemented in previous literature to conclude that entropy of exons is higher than of introns, thus implying that exons are more
“random” than introns. We define a new approximation to topological entropy free from the
aforementioned difficulties. We compute its expected value and apply this definition to the
intron and exon regions of the human genome to observe that as expected, the entropy of
introns are significantly higher than that of exons. Though we surprisingly find that introns
are less random than expected: their entropy is lower than the computed expected value. We
observe the perplexing phenomena that chromosome Y has atypically low and bi-modal entropy, possibly corresponding to random sequences (high entropy) and sequences that posses
hidden structure or function (low entropy). A Mathematica implementation is available at:

Introduction

Entropy, as a measure of information content and complexity, was first introduced by Shannon
(1948). Since then entropy has taken on many forms, namely topological, metric (due to Shannon),
Kolmogorov-Sinai, and Rènyi entropy. These entropies were defined for the purpose of classifying
a system via some measure of complexity or simplicity. These definitions of entropy have have
been applied to DNA sequences with varying levels of success. Topological entropy in particular
is infrequently used due to high-dimensionality problems and finite sample effects. These issues
stem from the fact that the mathematical concept of topological entropy was introduced to study
infinite length sequences. It is universally recognized that the most difficult issue in implementing
entropy techniques is the convergence problems due to finite sample effects (Vinga and Almeida
2004; Kirillova 2000). A few different approaches to circumvent these problems with topological
entropy and adapt it to finite length sequences have been attempted before. For example, in
Troyanskaya et al. (2002),linguistic complexity (the fraction of total subwords to total possible
subwords) is utilized to circumvent finite sample problems. This though leads to the observation
that the complexity/randomness of intron regions is lower than the complexity/randomness of exon
regions. However, in Colosimo and de Luca (2000) it is found that the complexity of randomly
produced sequences is higher than that of DNA sequences, a result one would expect given the
commonly held notion that intron regions of DNA are free from selective pressure and so evolve
more randomly than do exon regions. Also, little has been done in the way of mathematically
analyzing other finitary implementations of entropy due to most previous implementations using
1

an entire function instead of a single value to represent entropy (thus the expected value would be
very difficult to calculate)
In this paper we focus on topological entropy, introducing a new definition that has all the desired
properties of an entropy and still retains connections to information theory. This approximation,
as opposed to previous implementations, is a single number as opposed to an entire function, thus
greatly speeding up the calculation time and removing high-dimensionality problems while allowing
more mathematical analysis. This definition will allow the comparison of entropies of sequences
of differing length, a property no other implementation of topological entropy has been able to
incorporate. We will also calculate the expected value of the topological entropy to precisely draw
out the connections between topological entropy and information content. We will then apply this
definition to the human genome to observe that the entropy of intron regions is in fact lower than
that of exon regions in the human genome as one would expect. We then provide evidence indicating
that this definition of topological entropy can be used to detect sequences that are under selective
pressure.

Methods
Definitions and Preliminaries

We restrict our attention to the alphabet A = {A, C, T, G}. For a finite sequence w over the alphabet
A, we use |w| to denote the length of w. Of primary importance in the study of topological entropy
is the complexity function of a sequence w (finite or infinite) formed over the alphabet A.
Definition 1 (Complexity function). For a given sequence w, the complexity function pw : N → N
is defined as
pw (n) = |{u : |u| = n and u appears as a subword of w}|
That is, pw (n) represents the number of different n-length subwords (overlaps allowed) that
appear in w.
Now the traditional definition of topological entropy of an infinite word w is the asymptotic
exponential growth rate of the number of different subwords:
Definition 2. For an infinite sequence w formed over the alphabet A, the topological entropy is
defined as
log4 pw (n)
lim
n→∞
n
Due to the limit in the above definition, it is easily observed that this definition will always lead
to an answer of zero if applied directly to finite length sequences. This is due to the fact that the
complexity function of infinite length sequences is non-decreasing, while of finite length sequences
it is eventually zero. We include in figures 1 and 2 a log-linear plot of the complexity functions
for the gene ACSL4 found on ChrX:108906440-108976621 (hg19) as well as for an infinite string
generated by a Markov chain on four states with equal transition probabilities.
The graph of the complexity function of the gene found in figure 1 is entirely typical of the
graph of a complexity function for a finite sequence as can be seen by the following proposition.
The proof can be found in the nice summary by Colosimo and de Luca (2000). Note that in the
following m and M are numbers whose calculation is straightforward.

Proposition 1 (Shape of Complexity Function). For a finite sequence w, there are integers m, M ,
and N = |w|, such that the complexity function pw (n) is strictly increasing in the interval [0, m],
non-decreasing in the interval [m, M ] and strictly decreasing in the interval [M, N ]. In fact, for n

3

in the interval [M, N ] we have pw (n + 1) − pw (n) = −1.
Now for a finite sequence w we desire that an approximation of topological entropy Htop (w)
should have the following properties:
1. 0 ≤ Htop (w) ≤ 1
2. Htop (w) ≈ 0 if and only if w is highly repetitive (contains few subwords)
3. Htop (w) ≈ 1 if and only if w is highly complex (contains many subwords)
4. For different length sequences v, w, Htop (w) and Htop (v) should be comparable
It should be noted that item 4 on this list is of utmost importance when implementing topological
entropy. It is very important to normalize with respect to length since otherwise when counting the
number of subwords, longer sequences will appear artificially more complex simply due to the fact
that since the sequence is longer, there are more chances for subwords to show up. This explains
the “linear correlation” between sequence length and the implementations of topological entropy
used in Karamanos et al. (2006) and Kirillova (2000). This also hints at the incomparability of the
notions of entropy contained in Karamanos et al. (2006), Colosimo and de Luca (2000), Kirillova
(2000), and Schmitt and Herzel (1997).
Recall that an approximation of topological entropy should give an approximate asymptotic
exponential growth rate of the number of subwords. With this and the above properties in mind,
it is immediately concluded that we can disregard the values of pw (n) for n in the interval [m, N ]
mentioned in proposition 1. In fact, as in Colosimo and de Luca (2000) the only information
gained by considering pw (n) for n in the interval [m, N ] has to do with the specific combinatorial
arrangement of “special factors” and has little to do with the complexity of a sequence.
We define the approximation to topological entropy as follows
Definition 3 (Topological Entropy). Let w be a finite sequence of length |w|, let n be the unique
integer such that
4n + n − 1 ≤ |w| < 4n+1 + (n + 1) − 1
n

Then for w14

+n−1

the first 4n + n − 1 letters of w,
Htop (w) :=

log4 (pw4n +n−1 (n))
1

n

The reason for concatenating w to the first 4n + n − 1 letters is due to the following two facts
whose proofs are omitted.
Lemma 1. A sequence w over the alphabet {A, C, T, G} of length 4n + n − 1 can contain at most
4n subwords of length n. Conversely, if a word w is to have 4n subwords, it must have length at
least 4n + n − 1.
Thus if we had taken an integer m > n in the above definitions and instead utilized
w would not be long enough to contain all different possible subwords.

log4 (pw (m))
,
m

Lemma 2. Say a sequence w has length 4n + n − 1 for some integer n, then if w contains all
possible subwords of length n formed on the alphabet {A, C, T, G}, then Htop (w) = 1
4

Thus if a sequence of length 4n + n − 1 is “as random as possible” (i.e. contains every possible
subword), its topological entropy is 1, just as we would expect in the infinite sequence case. Similarly,
if w is “as nonrandom as possible”, that is, if w is simply the repetition of a single letter 4n + n − 1
times, then Htop (w) = 0.
Furthermore, if we had not used concatenation in definition 3, then for a sequence v such that
|v| > |w|, the topological entropy of v would on average be artificially higher due to v being a longer
sequence and thus has more opportunity for the appearance of subwords. Thus, by concatenating
we have allowed sequences of different lengths to have comparable topological entropies.
This definition of topological entropy serves as a measure of the randomness of a sequence: the
higher the entropy, the more random the sequence. The justification for this finite implementation
giving an approximate characterization of randomness is given in Ornstein and Weiss (2007) in
which it is shown that functions of entropy are the only finitely observable invariants of a process.

2.2

Expected Value

While topological entropy has been well studied for infinite sequences, very little has been done by
way of mathematically analyzing topological entropy for finite sequences. This lack of analysis is
most likely due to topological entropy as in the literature (Kirillova 2000; Crochemore and Renaud
1999; Schmitt and Herzel 1997) being considered not as a single number to be associated to a DNA
sequence, but rather the entire function log4 pnw (n) is considered for every n. This approach turns
topological entropy (which should be just a single number associated to a DNA sequences) into a
very high dimensional problem. In fact, as many dimensions as is the length of the DNA sequence
under consideration. Our definition given above (definition 3) does in fact associate just a single
number (instead of an entire function) to a sequence, and so is much more analytically tractable.
We now utilize the results of Gheorghiciuc and Ward (2007) to compute the expected value of
the above topological entropy. This will assist us in determining what constitutes “high” or “low”
entropy. First, we calculate the expected value of the complexity function pw (n). As is commonly
assumed (Lio and Goldman 1998; Hasegawa et al. 1985; Jukes and Cantor 1969), we now assume
that DNA sequences evolve in the following way: each state in a Markov fashion independent of
neighboring states. We do not assume a single model of molecular evolution, but rather just assume
that there is some set of probabilities {πA , πC , πT , πG } such that the probability of appearance of
a sequence w is given by the following: for nA the number of occurrences of the letter A in w, nC
the number of occurrences of the letter C in w, etc., the probability of the sequence w appearing is
given by:
nA nC nT nG
P(w) = πA
πC πT πG
This assumption regarding the probability of appearance of a DNA sequence is used only to
procure a distribution against which we may calculate the expected number of subwords. The actual
calculation of topological entropy as in definition 3 does not make any such assumption about the
probability of appearance.
Theorem 1 (Expected Value of the Complexity Function). The expected value of the complexity
function pw (n) taken over sequences of length |w| = n + k − 1 is given by
X
E[pw (n)] = 4k −
(1 − P(w))n + O(n−ǫ µn )
(1)
w

where the summation is over all sequences w of length n, and 0 < ǫ < 1, µ < 1 (these are explicitly
computed constants based on the πi defined above, see (Gheorghiciuc and Ward 2007)).
5

Proof. See (Gheorghiciuc and Ward 2007).
This theorem has a particularly nice reduction when one assumes that the probability of appearance of each subletter is the same (equivalent to the the expected value being computed with
a uniform distribution on the set of all sequences of a certain length).
Corollary 1. Assuming that πA = πC = πT = πG = 1/4, the expected value of complexity function
taken over sequences of length |w| = n + k − 1 is given by
1
E[pw (n)] = 4k − 4k (1 − ( )k )n + O(n−ǫ µk )
q

(2)

While clearly there is a mononucleotide bias for different genomic regions and DNA sequences
do not occur uniformly randomly, we do assume equal probability of appearance of each nucleotide
as then the calculation of the expected number of subwords reduces in computational complexity
from exponential to linear in the length of the sequence.
It is a straightforward calculation to combine formula 2 with definition 3 and compute the
constants ǫ and µ as set forth in Gheorghiciuc and Ward 2007. Doing so, we obtain the following
expected value for the topological entropy.
Theorem 2 (Expected Value of Topological Entropy). The expected value of topological entropy
taken over sequences of length |w| = 4n + n − 1 is given by
n

E[Htop ] =

log4 (4n − 4n (1 − 1/4n )4 + O(( √12 ))n )
n

(3)

We now present in table 1 the calculated estimation of the expected value of Htop using the
above formula. Keep in mind that the convergence of this calculation to the actual expected value
is exponentially quick (the term O(( √12 ))n ) as n increases (and so also the length of the sequence).
We thus ignore the O(( √12 ))n term in the following calculation.

Summarizing this table, the topological entropy of randomly selected sequences is tightly centered around the expected value which itself is close to one. Furthermore, the distribution of
topological entropy is very close to a normal distribution as can be observed from the histogram

Algorithm

An implementation of this approximation to topological entropy is available at:
http://www.math.psu.edu/koslicki/entropy.nb
We mention a few notes regarding this estimation of topological entropy. First, if a sequence w in
consideration has a length such that for some n, 4n + n− 1 < |w| < 4n+1 + n it will be more accurate
to use a sliding window to compute the topological entropy. For example, if |w| = 16000, we would
normally concatenate this sequence to the first 4101 letters. This might misrepresent the actually
topological entropy of the sequence. Accordingly, we could instead compute the average of the
topological entropy of the following sequences (where wnm means the subsequence of w consisting
of the nth to mth letters of w):
16000
w14101 , w24102 , w34103 , . . . , w11899

This is computationally intensive, so for longer sequences, one might instead choose to take nonoverlapping windows, so finding the average of the topological entropy of the sequences

The above website includes serial and parallel versions of the algorithm. The fastest version utilizes
Nvidia CUDA GPU computing, has complexity O(n) for a sequence of length n, and takes an
average of 5.2 seconds to evaluate on a DNA sequence of length 16,777,227 when using an Intel
i7-950 3.6 GHz CPU and an Nvidia GTX 460 GPU.

3.1

Comparison to Traditional Measures of Complexity

Other measures of DNA sequence complexity similar to this approximation of topological entropy
include: previous implementations of topological entropy (Kirillova, 2000), special factors (Colosimo
and de Luca, 2000), Shannon’s metric entropy (Kirillova, 2000; Farach et al., 1995), Rènyi continuous entropy (Vinga and Almeida, 2004; Rènyi, 1961), and linguistic complexity (LC) (Troyanskaya
et al., 2002; Gabrielian and Bolshoy, 1999).
The implementation of topological entropy in Kirillova (2000) does not produce a single number
representing entropy, but rather an entire sequence of values. Thus while the implementation of
Kirillova (2000) does distinguish between artificial and actual DNA sequences, Kirillova notes that
the implementation is hampered by high-dimensionality and finiteness problems.
In Colosimo and de Luca (2000), it is noted that the special factors approach does not differentiate between introns and exons.
Note also that the convergence of our approximation of topological entropy is even faster than
that of Shannon’s metric entropy. Shannon’s metric entropy of the sequence u for the value n is
defined as
−1 X
µu (w) log(µu (w))
Hmet (u, n) =
n w
where the summation is over all words of length n and µu (w) is the probability (frequency) of the
word w appearing in the given sequence u. Thus Shannon’s metric entropy requires not only the
appearance of subwords, but for the actual frequency of appearance of the subwords to converge
as well. As can be seen from definition 3, our notion of topological entropy does not require the
use of the actual subword frequencies. So topological entropy will in general be more accurate than
8

Shannon’s metric entropy for shorter sequences. Accordingly, the convergence issues mentioned in
Farach et al. (1995) (even with the clever Lempel-Ziv estimator) can be circumvented.
Furthermore, it is not difficult to show (as in Blanchard et al. (2000), Proposition 1.2.5) what
is known as the Variational Principle, that is, topological entropy dominates metric entropy: for
any sequence u (finite or not) and integer n
Hmet (u, n) ≤ Htop (u, n)

(4)

Thus topological entropy retains connections to the information theoretic interpretation of metric
entropy as set forth by Shannon (1948). Since topological entropy bounds metric entropy from
above:
Low topological entropy of a sequence implies that it is “less chaotic” and is “more
structured.”
This connection to information theory is also an argument for the use of topological entropy over
Rènyi continuous entropy of order α (see Vinga and Almeida (2004) for more details). Rènyi
(1961) showed that for α 6= 1, one cannot define conditional and mutual information functions and
hence Rènyi continuous entropy does not measure “information content” in the usual sense. So
while Rènyi entropy does allow for the identification of statistically significant motifs (Vinga and
Almeida, 2004), one cannot conclude that higher/lower Rènyi continuous entropy for α 6= 1 implies
more/less information content or complexity in the usual sense.
Thus LC is the only other similar measurement of sequence complexity that produces a single
number representing the complexity of a sequence. Like our implementation of topological entropy,
the implementation of LC contained in Troyanskaya et al. (2002) also runs in linear time. A
comparison of our implementation of topological entropy and LC is contained in section 4.4.

Application to Exons/Introns of the Human Genome
Method

We now apply our definition of topological entropy to the intron and exon regions of the human
genome.
We retrieved the February 2009 GRCh37/ hg19 human genome assembly from the UCSC
database and utilized Galaxy (Blankenberg et al. 2010; Blankenberg et al. 2007) to extract the
nucleotide sequences corresponding to the introns and exons of each chromosome (including ChrX
and ChrY). Now even though as argued above topological entropy converges more quickly than
metric entropy, one must be careful to not use this definition of topological entropy on sequences
that are too short as this would lead to significant noise. For example, the UCSC database contains
exons that consist of a single base and it is meaningless to attempt to measure topological entropy
of such sequences. Hence we selected the longest 100 different intron and exon sequences from each
chromosome.
After ensuring that each sequence consisted only of letters from {A, C, T, G}, we then applied
the approximation of topological entropy found in definition 3 to the resulting sequences. For
comparison’s sake we also applied the approximation of topological entropy to the longest 50, 200,
and 400 sequences, as well as to all the intron and exon sequences. The salient observed features
9

persist throughout. Though as expected, when shorter sequences are allowed, the results become
noisier.
To investigate in more detail the relationship between regions under selective pressure and the
value of topological entropy, we also selected each 5’ and 3’ UTR on chromosome Y that consisted
of more than 43 + 3 − 1 = 66 bp.

Analysis and Discussion

We first discuss the results regarding intron and exon regions. As figure 4 demonstrates, the
topological entropies of intron regions of the human genome are larger than the topological entropies
of the exon regions. For example, the mean of the entropies of the introns on chromosome 21 is
more than 11 standard deviations away from the mean of the entropy of the exons on the same
chromosome. This result supports the commonly held notion that intron regions of DNA are
mostly free from selective pressure and so evolve more randomly than do exon regions. We thus
suggest that the observation of Karamanos et al. (2006), Troyanskaya et al. (2002), Mantegna
et al. (1995), and Stanley et al. (1999) that intron entropy is smaller than exon entropy is due

to the aforementioned finite sample effects and high-dimensionality problems related to previous
implementations of entropy.
Interestingly, even though we observe that intron entropy is larger than exon entropy, the
entropies of both regions are much lower than expected (here expectation is as calculated in table
1). Indeed, of the longest 100 sequences, the average intron length is 180880 and the average exon
length is 2059, so according to tables 1 and 2, we would expect the entropies to be .966914 and
.933853 respectively. We find, though, that the average entropy for introns is .9323166 and for
exons is .897451. Note that the largest intron sequence entropy (Htop = .943627 for an intron of
length 1.1Mbp found on chromosome 16) is significantly lower than the expected value of .969921
(at least 60 standard deviations from the expectation). This is not too surprising considering
that the expectation as calculated in theorem 2 uses the uniform distribution. This supports the
conclusion that while intron regions do evolve more randomly than exon regions, introns do not
evolve uniformly randomly.
Note the disparity between the entropies of the sex chromosomes: The entropy of chromosome
X in both intron and exon regions is significantly higher than in chromosome Y. In fact, the mean
of chromosome X intron entropies is 3.5 standard deviations higher than the mean of chromosome
Y intron entropies; the mean of chromosome X exon entropies is 1 standard deviation higher
than the mean of chromosome Y exon entropies. Thus the X chromosome has intron and exon
entropy similar to that of the autosomes, but chromosome Y has significantly differing exon and
intron entropy. This is a particularly puzzling result considering that chromosome Y is known
to have a high mutation rate and a special selection regime (Wilson and Makova 2009a; Wilson
and Makova 2009b; Graves 2006), and so one would expect the entropy of chromosome Y (both
11

intron and exon regions) to be much higher than it is. In fact, the chromosome Y introns have
the lowest mean topological entropy of any intron region across the entire genome. This would
suggest that the accumulation of “junk” DNA and the massive accumulation of retrotransposable
elements mentioned in Graves (2006) have some underlying function or structure. More specifically,
it appears that the intron regions in chromosome Y might fall into two categories: the truly “junk”
DNA consisting of the introns with topological entropy greater than .910, and the introns that have
hidden structure consisting of those sequences with entropy less than .910. We present in figure 4.3
a histogram of the topological entropy on chromosome Y demonstrating the distinction between
the two categories.

Htop

Remaining on chromosome Y, we now present evidence that topological entropy can be used to
detect sequences that are under selective pressure. Note that Siepel et al. (2005) showed that both
5’ and 3’ UTRs are among the most conserved elements in vertebrate genomes. Thus one would
expect that the topological entropy of these regions would be very low (as this is indicative of a
high degree of structure). As indicated in figure 5, the entropy of both the 5’ and 3’ region are low
in comparison to the entropy of the intron and exon regions across the autosomes. In fact the mean
of the topological entropy of the 5’ and 3’ UTRs (.871545 ± .0290619 and .879163 ± .0219371) are
lower than the mean entropy of any intron or exon region across every chromosome. The lowest
mean topological entropy for an autosome is .927802 ± .00539 on chromosome 19, this is more than
nine standard deviations higher than the mean of topological entropy for either the 3’ or 5’ UTRs.
This lends support to the assertion that topological entropy can be used to detect functional regions
and regions under selective constraint.

Comparison to Linguistic Complexity

As mentioned in section 3.1, LC is the only other similar measurement of sequence complexity
that produces a single number to represent the complexity of a sequence. We applied the algorithm
described in Troyanskaya et al. (2002) and written by Larsson (1999) to the same data set contained
in section 4.1 of this paper. To obtain directly comparable results, we used a window size as big
as the given sequence is long. As can be seen in figure 8, LC does distinguish between introns
and exons to an extent, though not to the same quality of resolution as that of topological entropy
(compare to figure 4). For example, while topological entropy consistently measures introns as
more random than exons, LC does not. This discrepancy is most likely due to linguistic complexity
being effectively utilized (Troyanskaya et al., 2002) as a sliding window method to detect repetitive
motifs, not as a holistic measure of sequence information content. So we also applied LC using a
sliding window of 2000bp, taking the average value of LC on a given sequence, and then averaging
on a given chromosome (see figure 9). Using the sliding window, LC does give a higher value to
introns than to exons (except on chromosome 5). While the separation between the LC of introns
and exons becomes more pronounced, the resolution is still not nearly as clear as with topological
entropy since a large amount of error persisted. The LC values amongst introns and exons are well
within one standard deviation of each other across the entire genome.

Conclusion

This implementation of topological entropy is free from issues that other implementations have
encountered. Namely, this definition allows for the comparison of sequences of different length
and does not suffer from multi-dimensionality complications. Since this definition supplies a single

14

value to characterize the complexity of a sequence, it is much more capable of being mathematically
analyzed. Beyond measuring the complexity or simplicity of a sequence, we presented evidence that
our approximation to topological entropy might detect functional regions and sequences free from or
under selective constraint. The speed and simplicity of this implementation of topological entropy
makes it very suitable for utilization in detecting regions of high/low complexity. For example, we
observe the novel phenomena that the introns on chromosome Y have atypically low and bi-modal
entropy, possibly corresponding to random sequences and sequences that posses hidden structure
or function.
