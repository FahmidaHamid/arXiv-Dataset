Abstract
Structuring of DNA counterions around the double helix has been studied by the molecular
dynamics method. A DNA dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in water solution with the alkali
metal counterions Na+, K+, and Cs+ has been simulated. The systems have been considered in the
regimes without excess salt and with different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or CsCl) added. The
results have showed that the Na+ counterions interact with the phosphate groups directly from
outside of the double helix and via water molecules at the top edge of DNA minor groove. The
potassium ions are mostly localized in the grooves of the double helix, and the cesium ions
penetrate deeply inside the minor groove being bonded directly to the atoms of nucleic bases. Due
to the electrostatic repulsion the chlorine ions tend to be localized at large distances from the
DNA polyanion, but some Cl- anions have been detected near atomic groups of the double helix
forming electrically neutral pairs with counterions already condensed on DNA. The DNA sites,
where counterions are incorporated, are characterized by local changes of double helix structure.
The lifetime of Na+ and K+ in complex with DNA atomic groups is less than 0.5 ns, while in the
case of the cesium ions it may reach several nanoseconds. In this time scale, the Cs+ counterions
form a structured system of charges in the DNA minor groove that can be considered as ionic
lattice.

1. Introduction
Under the natural conditions, the DNA double helix is surrounded by water molecules and positively charged
ions (counterions). The counterions (usually, Na +, K+, or Mg2+) condense on DNA polyanion neutralizing the
negatively charged atomic groups of the macromolecule [1-5]. The neutralization of negative charge by
counterions is the key point in stability of DNA double helix. The relative disposition of counterions on
macromolecule is modulated by double helical structure of DNA. Structuring of counterions around DNA
macromolecule is a necessary stage in many mechanisms of conformational transformation of the double
helix, such as DNA condensation, formation of microscopic textures on the surface, and others [6-11]. The
study of dynamical structure of counterions is important for understanding the molecular level of biological
processes where DNA macromolecule is involved.
The localization of counterions on the macromolecule can be determined definitely only in the case of
solid samples of DNA [12-14]. In solution the counterions are mobile, therefore they are detected
experimentally as the cloud that they form around DNA double helix [15-18]. At the same time, the
molecular dynamics method (MD) can provide detailed information about the interaction of counterions with
DNA and about the changes in the double helix structure [19-22]. In this regard the MD study of DNA
systems is indispensable for understanding the organization of counterions around the double helix.
Starting with the early MD simulations, the counterions are known to interact to the phosphate groups of
double helix backbone, the atoms of nucleic bases, and the oxygen atom of deoxyribose [23-26]. The
character of counterion interaction essentially depends on the counterion type, concentration, and sequence
1

of nucleic bases [27-35]. The results for alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) show that the sodium
ions interact mostly with the phosphate groups [29, 30]. They can be also localized at the top edge of the
minor groove and interact with phosphates via water molecules. The potassium ions are usually localized in
the groves of the double helix close to the negative base sites [22]. The heavy ions of Rb+ and Cs+ penetrate
deeply inside the minor groove and interact directly to the atoms of nucleic bases and the oxygen atoms of
deoxyribose [27, 34, 35]. The smallest ions Li+ squeeze through water molecules surrounding the phosphate
group and form stable complexes with phosphate groups of the DNA backbone [27]. The counterion
organization around DNA macromolecule induce different structure changes that are the key factors in
conformational transitions between A-, B-, and Z-forms of the double helix [36-38].
Due to the regularity of DNA structure the counterions should form a regular structure around the
double helix. In the previous studies, the counterions tethered to the phosphate groups of DNA backbone
have been showed to form a structure resembling an ionic crystal lattice (ion-phosphate lattice) [39-43].The
existence of ion-phosphate lattice has been confirmed by modes of counterion vibrations with respect to the
phosphate groups observed in the Cs-DNA low-frequency spectra ( < 200 cm-1) [44]. Effects of counterion
ordering have been also observed in conductivity experiments of DNA water solutions with KCl salt [45]. To
elucidate the lattice arrangement of counterions around the DNA double helix it is necessary to conduct
molecular dynamics studies.
The goal of the present research is to study the counterion structuring around the DNA double helix
using the molecular dynamics method. To solve this problem, the MD simulations of DNA with Na+, K+, and
Cs+ counterions have been made. The description of modelled systems and MD simulation procedure is
given in the second section. In the third section, the typical positions of counterions have been determined by
analyzing the calculated radial distribution functions. The influence of counterions on the double helix
structure has been studied in the fourth section. In the fifth section, the features of counterions structuring
around the DNA macromolecule have been discussed.

2. Model and methods
A DNA fragment d(CGCGAATTCGCG), known as the Drew-Dickerson dodecamer [46], has been
simulated. The atomic and schematic structures of the modelled DNA dodecamer are showed in Fig. 1.

of the fragment [46]. b) Schematic structure of the DNA fragment. The numeration of nucleotides is shown.

The counterions Na+, K+, and Cs+ are added to the system. The ions are considered in two concentration
regimes: i) the number of positively charged ions is equaled to the number of negatively charged phosphate
groups of DNA backbone; ii) the chloride salt (NaCl, KCl, or CsCl) with a concentration of 0.5 M is added
to the system of DNA with counterions neutralizing phosphate groups of the double helix. The oligomer is
2

emersed into rectangular box (42Å x 42Å x 62Å) with about 2990 TIP3P water molecules. The periodic
boundary conditions in all directions are used. Thus, three systems without added salt (Na0, K0, and Cs0)
and three systems with added salt (Na05, K05, and Cs05) have been modelled. The parameters of these
systems are showed in the Table 1.

The computer simulations are performed within the framework of NAMD software package [47] and
the CHARMM27 force field parameter set [48]. The integration time step is equaled to 2 fs. All bond length
are fixed using SHAKE algorithm [49]. The long-range electrostatic interactions are treated using particle
meshed Ewald method [50]. The switching and cutoff distances for the long-range interactions are taken
equaled to 8 Å and 10 Å, respectively. The simulations are performed at the constant pressure (101325 Pa)
and temperature 300 K. For pressure and temperature control Langevin dynamics is used for all heavy atoms
(damping constant 5 ps-1. The oscillation time and damping time constants for the Langevin piston are 100 fs
and 50 fs, respectively.
The simulation protocol analogical to [29] is used. At the first stage of simulation, the minimization
is made for the system with fixed heavy atoms (1000 steps). Then the system is minimized with fixed DNA
atoms (2000 steps). At the second stage, the solvent is heated to a temperature of 300 K (15 ps) and
equilibrated during 100 ps. At the third stage, the minimization is performed for the system with restrained
DNA atoms by harmonic potential (2000 steps). Restrain coefficient is equaled to k=5 kcal/mol Å2. Then the
system is heated to a temperature of 300 K (30 ps) and equilibrated during 100 ps. After that, the atoms of
DNA are set free and the system is equilibrated during 1 ns. The total duration of the MD trajectory is 12 ns.
The first nanosecond is not taken into consideration in the further analysis of modelled systems.

RMSD for different systems are shown by different colours.}

To perform the complete characterization of counterion dynamics around the DNA double helix the
length of MD trajectory should be about several hundreds nanoseconds [21, 22,34]. However, for the
comparative study of the dynamics of counterions of different type (in our case Na+, K+, and Cs+, the length
of MD trajectory may be shorter. Taking into consideration that the characteristic residence time of
counterion in complex with the DNA atomic groups is usually about 1 ns [19-21], the MD trajectory of about
10 ns length may be appropriate. Thus, in the present study the lengths of MD trajectories for the modelled
systems are taken equal to 12 ns.

To characterize the equilibrium state of the systems the deviation of DNA structure from the initial
structure is analyzed using root mean square deviation (RMSD). The RMSD is defined as

R (t )

N

N

r (t ) r (0)

where N is the number of considered atoms,

(t) and

(0) are the

coordinates of atom at the time t and t = 0, respectively. RMSD of systems is derived using VMD program
[51]. The obtained dependence of RMSD on time for all simulated systems is showed in Fig. 2. One can see
that at the first nanosecond the RMSD values increase from 0 Å to about 2 Å and then fluctuate with respect
to the average value. The amplitude of RMSD fluctuations is about 1 Å during all simulation trajectory. The
obtained RMSD are appropriate for equilibrated systems at the nanosecond time scale.

3. Distribution of ions around DNA double helix
To analyze the distribution of counterions with respect to the DNA double helix the radial distribution
functions (RDFs) of two type have been calculated using VMD program [51]. The first RDF type (phosphate
RDF) characterizes the distribution of ions with respect to oxygen atoms O1 and O2 of the phosphate groups.
The second RDF type (central RDF) characterizes the distribution of ions with respect to the atoms that are
localized close to the center of B-DNA double helix (atoms N3 of purine and N1 of pyrimidine bases). The
RDFs are calculated for all nucleotide pairs except that belonging to the ends of DNA fragment. To avoid the
end effects the 1-21, 2-23, 12-13, and 11-14 nucleotide pairs (Fig. 1b) (ends of the dodecamer) are not
considered. Using the obtained series of functions the averaged RDFs of each type have been defined. The
averaged RDFs are showed in Fig. 3.
The phosphate RDFs describe the distribution of counterions outside the double helix. The obtained
phosphate RDFs usually have two prominent and one weak maximums. The position of the first maximum is
within the distance range (2.2 ÷ 3.1) Å (Table 2) which correlates with the ion size. The first peak
characterizes the direct binding of ions to the oxygen atoms of the phosphate groups of DNA backbone. The
second maximum at about (4.5 ÷ 7.3) Å characterizes the localization of ions in the grooves of the double
helix and in the ion-hydrate shell of macromolecule. The third weak peak (at about 10 Å) characterizes the
ions in the ion-hydrate shell of DNA.

The central RDFs feature the localization of counterions with respect to the double helix axis. The
obtained central RDFs may have one or two peaks. The first peak is at about the distance 5 Å, while the
second peak is at about 7 Å from the helix center. These peaks characterize the localization of counterions in
the grooves of the double helix. The first peak arises due to the ions contacting with the atoms of bases
directly at the bottom of the grooves. The second peak characterizes the localization of ions at the top edge
of the grooves.
Our results have showed that the distribution of Na+ counterions in the both Na0 and Na05 systems
is characterized by the first intensive and the second small maximums in the phosphate RDF (Fig. 3a). The
positions of these peaks are at about 2.2 Å and 4.5 Å from the phosphate group, respectively (Table 2). The
central RDF has a band with low intensity at about 7 Å from the double helix center. The first intensive peak
in the phosphate RDF and the band in the central RDF indicate that sodium counterions interact with the
phosphate groups and do not enter the grooves deeply. The Na+ ions with water molecules of its hydration
shell may be localized at top edge of the grooves.

respectively. The phosphate RDFs are shifted for 10 Å to illustrate the characteristic radius of B-DNA. The

systems. b) The RDFs of K+ counterions in K0 and K05 systems. c) The RDFs of Cs+ counterions in Cs0 and
Cs05 systems. In insets the RDFs for Cl- ions are shown.

In the case of K0 and K05 systems, the maximums of phosphate RDFs are not as intensive as in the
systems with sodium ions (Fig. 3b). At the same time, the central RDF has two peaks at the distances about 5
Å and 7 Å (Table 2) characterizing a direct interaction of the ions with atoms of bases and localization of ion
at the top edge of grooves, respectively. The interaction of K+ with the phosphate groups is not dominant.
5

The radial distribution functions of Cs0 and Cs05 systems are characterized by an intensive peak in
the central RDF at the distance about 5 Å and by a shoulder at about 7 Å (Fig. 3c). The phosphate RDFs are
characterized by low first and second peaks and a rather strong band at about 7 Å (Table 2). Such structure of
RDFs indicate that Cs+ ions are localized mostly in the grooves of the double helix and interact directly with
the atoms of bases.
The distribution of Cl- ions in the Na05, K05, and Cs05 systems is rather similar. The central RDFs
have no maximums and gradually increase as the distance from the double helix center grows. The phosphate
RDFs are characterized by a low maximum at a distance of about 5 Å that is more than twice greater than the
ion radius (insets in Fig. 3). Thus chlorine anions tend to be localized at large distances from the DNA
double helix.

K0, and Cs0 systems, respectively. b) DNA with added NaCl, KCl, and CsCl salts in Na05, K05, and Cs05
systems.

The analysis of the radial distribution functions shows that the counterions usually interact with the
atoms O1 and O2 of phosphates, the atoms N3, N7, and O2 of nucleic bases, and the atom O4 of
6

deoxyribose. The snapshots illustrating the localization of Na +, K+, and Cs+ counterions on DNA double
helix are showed on Fig. 4. A visual examination has showed that in the case of salt free system, the sodium
counterions are localized near the phosphate groups from the outside of the double helix and in the grooves
of the macromolecule (Fig. 4a). In the minor groove of the double helix, the Na+ ions can be localized
between phosphate groups of different strands at the top edge of the groove. The interaction of sodium ions
with the atoms of nucleic bases occurs via water molecules. The potassium ions in the K0 system can interact
mostly to the phosphate groups from the grooves side of macromolecule. In contrast to the Na+ ions, the K+
ions an also interact directly with the atoms of nucleic bases. The cesium counterions in the Cs0 system can
penetrate deeply into the grooves. In the minor groove, they interact with N3 and O2 atoms of purine and
pyrimidine bases. From time to time, the regular structure of Cs+ counterions are observed in the minor
groove of the double helix. The distance between structured Cs+ ions in the minor groove of the double helix
is about 7 Å.
In the systems with added Mt+Cl- salt (Na05, K05, and Cs05), the interaction sites of counterions
with DNA double helix are the same as in salt free solutions. The chlorine ions form the associates with the
metal ions. The cation-anions pairs can approach rather close to macromolecule and even be incorporated
into the double helix (Fig.4b). The interaction of cations with the central base pairs of DNA fragment is more
intensive, while the anions more often come to the ends of the double helix.
The analysis of obtained results shows that derived RDFs have the shape similar to that obtained in
MD studies with much longer simulation trajectory [21, 22, 28, 30, 34], but the intensities of RDFs
maximums are slightly different. The detected DNA-counterion contacts and their lifetimes correlate with
the values obtained earlier [21, 28-30]. Thus, the conducted MD research describes well (at least, in terms of
qualitative aspects) the features of counterion structuring around DNA double helix.

4. Transformations of the double helix structure under the influence of
counterions
The counterions interacting with DNA atoms induce the conformational changes of the double helix. To
analyze the influence of counterions on conformational state of the macromolecule, the structure parameters
of the double helix have been calculated. The DNA conformational parameters have been derived with the
help of Curves+ program [52]. Using the obtained data the averaged on time parameters of the double helix
grooves have been calculated. The dependence of groove widths and depths on the base pair level are
showed in Figs. 5 and 6.
The obtained dependence of groove parameters on base pair level and the influence of counterions
correlate with the results of early molecular dynamics simulations [27, 29-32, 34]. In the case of salt free
systems, the width of the major and minor grooves changes within the range (8 ÷ 12) Å and (5.5 ÷ 11) Å,
respectively (Fig. 5a, 6b). The minimal values of groove width correspond to the central base pairs, while the
largest values are characteristic for the ends of the DNA fragment. For the central base pairs the values of
groove width are the lowest in the case of Cs+ ions. In the case of Na+ and K+ ions width of the grooves is
almost similar.
The width of the grooves in the case of systems with added salt varies within the range (6 ÷ 13) Å
and has the same character of dependence on base pair level as that in the salt free systems (Figs. 6a, 6b).
The groove depth is approximately constant in the central part of the dodecamer (about 6 Å) and changes in
its ends for all systems (Figs. 5c, 5d and Figs. 6c, 6d).
To characterize the macromolecule elasticity the time averaged angle of the double helix bending has
been calculated for DNA in the modelled systems (Table 3). One can see that the average angle values are
rather large and vary within the range (10 ÷ 21)°. The bending angle is especially large in the case of K05
and Cs0 systems, while in the case of Na0 and K0 systems it has the lowest value. The bending angle is
related with the persistence length of the macromolecules. Increasing the double helix bending angle should
induce a decrease in the persistence length of DNA. The dependence of persistence length on counterion type
and concentration has been observed experimentally [4].

Our analysis of DNA structure parameters has showed that the conformational changes of the double
helix are the most prominent in the center of the modelled DNA dodecamer where the localization of
counterions is the most often. At the same time, the conformational changes may occur due to the length
effects of the polynucleotide and due to the intrinsic properties of the AATT sequence of DNA that is in the
central part of Drew-Dickerson dodecamer (Fig.1). All these factors of the double helix structural
transformations may be interrelated.

5. Discussion
The results of conducted MD study have showed that Na +,K+, and Cs+ counterions interact with DNA in
different manner and the relative position of ions on double helix is essentially different. Sodium ions are
bound mostly to the phosphate groups of the DNA backbone and may enter the grooves of the double helix
with water molecules of the hydration shell. The potassium ions are localized mostly in the grooves of the
double helix. The interaction of K+ with the phosphates is not so essential as in the case of Na+. The cesium
ions penetrate deeply into the grooves of the double helix and interact directly to the atoms of bases.
The reason for such different character of interaction of alkali metal ions with DNA is considered
due to different size of ions and their different solvation type [19]. The radiuses of alkali metal ions are
known to increase in the following order: Li+<Na+<K+<Rb+<Cs+, while their hydration radiuses have
opposite gradation [53]. As the result, energy of hydration is positive in case of Li+ and Na+ ions, and is
negative in case of K+, Rb+ and Cs+ ions [54]. That is why, the water molecules of hydration shell of the
sodium and lithium ions are constrained that does not allow the ions to enter the grooves of the double helix
deeply and to interact directly with the atoms of bases. The smallest alkali metal ion Li+ interacts with the
oxygen atoms of DNA phosphates and form the common hydration shell which provides a long living
complex with the double helix [19]. In contrast, the water molecules around the cesium ions are not so
constrained by ions, and Cs+ can be easily dehydrated and pass to the bottom of DNA grooves. The
properties of the rubidium ions in DNA solutions have been showed to be rather similar to the Cs+ ions [19,
34, 35].
Due to the electrostatic repulsion, the negatively charged chlorine ions tend to be localized at large
distances from DNA polyanion. However, some Cl- ions has been detected close to DNA surface and even
inside the grooves of the macromolecule. Intrusion of the Cl- into the double helix occurs due to the
formation of neutral cation-anion pairs with the counterions already condenses on DNA. A recent MD study
of ionic aggregates in DNA solutions has showed that the formation of large ionic clusters is characteristic
for different force fields, but not for the CHARMM force field used in the present work [55]. Thus the
formation of cation-anion pairs in our MD simulations is not an artifact of the method.
The structure of the DNA double helix is not uniform for all base pairs. The grooves of the double
helix shrink at the center of the macromolecule fragment and the double helix is bent as a whole. The
observed conformational transformations of the macromolecule occur due to both intrinsic properties of the
AATT sequence of the DNA fragment and the influence of the counterions interacting with the double helix.
The length effects of DNA fragment may be also essential.
The relative disposition of Na + and K+ ions on DNA macromolecules change dynamically. The
lifetime of these ions tethered to the phosphate groups of the double helix is equal or less then 0.5 ns. The
cesium ions can spend rather long time in complex with DNA atomic groups (about several nanoseconds)
and, from time to time, form a regular structure in the minor groove of the double helix. The characteristic
distance between structured Cs+ ions is about 7 Å. The structure of Cs+ counterions with DNA may be
considered as the ionic lattice. The existence of such lattice structure for DNA with alkali metal ions was
predicted in the previous works [39-43].

6. Conclusions
In the present research, the dynamical and structural features of DNA-counterion system have been studied
by the molecular dynamics method. The MD simulations have been made for different systems consisting of
the molecular fragment d(CGCGAATTCGCG) and counterions of some type (Na +, K+, or Cs+). The systems
have been considered in the regimes without excess salt and with the different salts (0.5 M of NaCl, KCl or
CsCl) added. The results have showed that the Na+ ions interact mostly to phosphate groups of the DNA
backbone. The K+ ions are localized mostly in grooves of the double helix, while the Cs+ ions penetrate
deeply inside the grooves of the double helix and interact directly to the atoms of bases. The difference in
counterion interactions with DNA is considered as a consequence of different ion hydration. The addition of
extra salt to the system does not change the character of interaction of counterions with DNA. The chlorine
anions are usually localized at large distances from DNA polyanion, but some Cl- ions have been detected
near atomic groups of the double helix that is due to the formation of neutral pairs with the counterions
already condensed on DNA. The interactions of counterions with DNA induce local changes in the double
helix structure. The counterions dynamically change their positions on DNA macromolecule. The lifetime of
Na+ and K+ ions near the phosphate groups of the double helix is equal to or less than 0.5 ns. In contrast, the
lifetime of cesium ions in DNA minor groove may reach several nanoseconds. In this time scale, the regular
structure of Cs+ in the DNA double helix is formed, which may be considered as ionic lattice.
