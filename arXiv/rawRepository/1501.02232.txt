ABSTRACT
This work examines the relevance of the one-dimensional models used to study the influx and
the cumulative uptake of nutrient by roots. The physical models studied are the fixed boundary
model (Barber and Cushman 1981) and an improved version of our moving boundary model
(Reginato et al. 2000). A weight averaged expression to compute influx on root surface and a
generalized formula to estimate the cumulative nutrient uptake are used. The moving boundary
model problem is solved by the adaptive finite element method. For comparison of simulations
of influx and cumulative uptake versus observed results six set of data extracted from literature
are used. For ions without limitations of availability fixed and moving boundary models
produces similar results with small errors. Instead, to low concentrations, the fixed boundary
model over predicts while the moving boundary model always produces better results mainly
for K. For the P uptake the moving boundary model produces better results only when the
concentrations are very low and their predictions are comparable to the obtained by a 3Darchitectural model. The obtained improvements would explain any failures of previous models
for ions of low availability. Therefore, our model could be a simpler alternative due to its low
computational burden.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past four decades different mechanistic nutrient uptake models have been
developed to simulate nutrient uptake. Usually, these models consist of three basic components
(Rengel 1993): (i) solute movement in the soil toward plant roots described by a continuity
equation; (ii) nutrient uptake kinetics described by the Michaelis-Menten equation; (iii) nutrient
uptake as a result of root growth and inter-root competition by introducing root growth and
morphology parameters. Two categories of models have evolved: steady state and transient
models (Tinker and Nye 2000). NUTRIENT UPTAKE (Oates and Barber 1987) and NST 3.0
(Claassen et al. 1986) are examples of a transient model with a numerical solution, while
SSAND (Li and Comerford 2000) and PCATS (Smethurst et al. 2004) are steady state models.
Transient models using numerical solutions are a well-established approach to mechanistic
nutrient uptake models (Tinker and Nye 2000). The Barber-Cushman model is a well-known
and widely-used model in this category. The model treats the system as two concentric
cylinders, where the inner is the root (with constant radius, and no extensions like branching,
lateral roots, root hairs or mycorrhizal hypha), whose center is the spatial reference to the soilroot system, with radial orientation. The soil, (assumed homogeneous and isomorphic, with
constant moisture content) forms an external cylinder around the root, also with a constant
radius. Movement of water and solutes in the soil system is radial to the root only, by massflow and diffusion, following Nye and Marriott 1969. Water flow, controlled by the
transpiration demand (assumed constant with time), obeys the radial geometry of the system
and mass conservation. Nutrient uptake rate is a function of concentration of the ion in question
in the soil solution at the root surface, assuming that uptake occurs from a solution only,
without interaction with other solutes. Updates to this basic feature include moving boundaries,
the external radius (the available soil extent to each root) to account for root growth with time
and consequent increase in root density (Reginato et al 2000). NUTRIENT UPTAKE model
and NST 3.0 are the personal computer version of the Barber-Cushman model. In 1983 Itoh
and Barber developed a submodel to the Barber-Cushman model to include nutrient uptake by
root hairs. In 1986 Claassen et al. published NST 1.0 model. In 1987 Oates and Barber
published NUTRIENT UPTAKE model. Both were based on the Barber-Cushman model.
2

Later Claassen and his colleagues developed NST 2.0 and NST 3.0, which were not published
in a journal (Claassen, N. Personal communication. 2003, 24 June). NST 3.0 incorporates the
Freundlich isotherm into the model so that the buffer power (b) changes as the nutrient
concentration in soil solution changes (Steingrobe et al. 2000). Further refinements of the Nye
and Marriott derived models consisted to upscale from the root segment to the whole root
system, and accounted for root growth (Baldwin et al. 1973; De Willigen et al. 2002). By using
upscaling Roose et al. (2001) and Roose & Kirk (2009) provide a fully explicit ‘approximate’
analytical solution to the Nye–Tinker–Barber model and applied this solution to more complex
root branching structure. Roose et al. (2001) showed that the method used to upscale may lead
to substantial differences in the predicted uptake of nutrients between their models and NST 3.0
model. When applied to nutrients such as K and P, such models have generally proved quite
efficient at predicting the acquisition over time scales of days or weeks for soils receiving high
K or P inputs, but almost systematically failed in low input conditions (Brewster et al. 1976;
Claassen et al. 1986; Lu and Miller 1994; Mollier et al. 2008; Samal et al. 2010; Schenk and
Barber 1980). Under such conditions, those models actually underestimate the observed uptake
flux, which suggests that other processes than those accounted for by the models could be
operating, and ultimately driving nutrient acquisition. More recent versions started to take into
account the effects of fertilizer inputs and nutrient uptake by mycorrhizae (Comerford et al.
2006; Lin and Kelly 2010). However, a comparison of nutrient uptake predictions against
experimentally measured values showed that the last version of three process-based models
(NST 3.0, SSAND, and PCATS) largely underestimated P uptake for three woody plant
species, except under large P fertilizer additions for the transient state model NST 3.0
developed by Claassen and co-workers (e.g.Claassen et al. 1986; Steingrobe et al. 2000). This
pattern showed that including mycorrhizal uptake in the simulations was not sufficient to
predict accurately nutrient uptake under the low nutrient concentrations. These results
suggested that rhizospheric effects, not yet taken into account in these models, could be carried
out to improve their predictive ability. Further 3D root system architecture models were
RootTyp, SimRoot, ROOTMAP, SPACSYS, R-SWMS, and RootBox (Dunbabin et al., 2013)
and they are being used to study how specific root traits affect the uptake of a variety of soil
3

resources such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and water. Limitations of current models also infer the
future directions in research. Though root system architecture modeling is being used to
understand plant uptake of soil resources, there are problems with upscaling from single roots
to the whole system. Current models do not include rhizosphere processes or soil
microorganisms that are known to be important for resource uptake and root growth. From
other point of view, heat and mass transfer with phase change problems such as evaporation,
condensation, freezing, melting, sublimation, have wide application in separation processes,
food technology, heat and mixture migration in soils and grounds, etc. They have been studied
in the last century due to their wide scientific and technological applications [AlexiadesSolomon, 1993; Cannon, 1984; Carslaw-Jaeger, 1959; Crank, 1984; Lunardini, 1991]. This
kind of problem are known in the literature as free or moving boundary problems depending if
the interface is unknown or known a priori. A large bibliography and a review of explicit
solutions on free and moving boundary problems for the heat-diffusion equation were given in
[Tarzia, 2000, 2011]. Due to the non-linearity of the problems, solutions usually involve
mathematical difficulties and analytical methods can only be developed for idealized systems or
for those with plain structure and constant properties. Numerical methods, instead, allow
considering the structural and compositional characteristics through detailed models. The
methodology of free and moving boundary problems have been also applied to agronomic
problems. Thus, there are previous papers in this area for which the nutrient uptake has been
implicitly modeled by moving boundary problems, for example, Abbes et al., 1996, Huguenin
and Kirk, 2003. Explicit one-dimensional free and moving boundary model applied to root
growth and nutrient uptake was presented in Reginato et al., 1990, 2000, Jonard et al., 2010.
The goal of this paper is to consider an improved version of the moving boundary model
applied to uptake of ions of low, medium and high availability by roots. In particular, we will
revise and compare the uptake of ions through model NST 3.0, and the moving boundary
model. For both models, we use a new generalized cumulative uptake formula and the moving
boundary model is solved by the adaptive finite elements method. Moreover, we also compare
the cumulative uptake predicted by a more complex root branching system model with ones
obtained by our moving boundary model.

The moving boundary model
This model is based on the same assumptions formulated by the Barber-Cushman model
but, now, the model incorporates a new boundary condition for root competition (among roots
of root system) which represents the net flux on the moving boundary R(t). This moving
boundary is given by the instantaneous half distance between roots axis which is the result of
the root length variation. Thus, moving boundary R(t) is a function of the instantaneous root
length

(t) which is a known function of time. A representation of the new condition can be

visualised assuming a fixed volume of soil in which the root system is distributed like a
homogenous piling up by roots, i.e., we propose an idealized total root system submerged in a
fixed volume of soil (pots) instead of a single root in an infinite volume of soil (Figure 1). The
conditions of humidity, light and temperature are assumed to be controlled (as in a growth
chamber). Based on these assumptions and using root length density as a function of t, R(t) (the
moving boundary), the following set of equations and boundary conditions in cylindrical
coordinates are used:

 kt with units of k in [cm s-1] and the exponential growth

ekt with units of k in [s-1]. We denote x+ as the part positive of x defined by

x+ = Max (0;x). Equation (1) is the equation of diffusive and convective transport of ions in soil
and condition (2) corresponds to the initial profile of concentrations. Condition (4) represents a
null flux on the moving limit of not-transference or instantaneous half mean distance between
roots R(t). We remark that the null flux condition imposed in this paper by equation (4) is a
more realistic condition and a corrected version with respect to the similar one used in our
previous model (Reginato et al., 2000). Condition (3) represents the mass balance on the root
surface and the expression (5) represents the moving boundary R(t) as a function of the
instantaneous root length (t) . Expression (5) for the moving boundary is an improved version
of a similar condition used in our previous model and introduces minor error in the
computational algorithm designed to solve the problem. Unlike the expression proposed for
R(t) in the previous version of our model which was based on considerations of constant
volume of soil including roots (If the total volume of root plus soil remains constant then the
amount of soil available to root will not be constant over time, i.e., the root grows at the
expense of the decrease of the volume of soil), is now considered a constant volume of soil
(See Appendix I). A schematic diagram of the problem (1) – (5) is shown in the Figure 2.
The solution of problem (1) – (5) is obtained by the application of the finite element method by
using a dimensionless formulation through the following change of variable (similar to the one
proposed by Roose (2009), but now scaling the difference of coordinates (r-so) by the
difference of coordinates (R(t)-so), i.e., transforming the variable interval (so,R(t)) in a fixed
interval (0,1) for all t > 0:

We remark that the moving boundary problem (1)-(5) was transformed in a fixed boundary
problem, but the partial differential equation (7) now takes into account the moving boundary
R(t) (or R*(t*) in the dimensionless domain).
We remark that, the dimensionless equation (7) reduces to the dimensionless equation of
Roose (Roose et al., 2009) when R(t) = Ro = constant (fixed domain) and the root radius so is
small with respect to the half distance among roots Ro. Thus, our moving boundary formulation
is a generalization of the fixed boundary model (Cushman, 1979, Roose, 2001) (See Appendix
III). The solution of the nutrient uptake problem (7) – (11) in an inmobilized domain is

7

obtained by a more stable and efficient numerical method that satisfies the mass balance among
the ions taken by the root system and the ions remaining in soil. Thus, we apply the finite
element method by using the FlexPDE software (http://www.pdesolutions.com, Schnepf et al.,
2002). Once the influx values on the root surface are obtained we estimate the cumulative
nutrient uptake by our growing root system by the following generalized formula valid for any
range of concentrations (See Appendix IV):
tf

U  U(t f )  U(t i )  2so  J(t) (t)d
ti

(14)

where J is given in mol cm-2 s-1, (t) in cm and U in moles. The influx J(t) is given by

J(t)  J m C(so , t)  Cu  / K m   C(so , t)  Cu  .
Moreover, and based in this generalized formula; we define a weight averaged influx which
is consistent with the experimental William´s formula (Williams, 1946, 1948). This averaged
influx is given by (See Appendix V):



where J is given in mol/cm2-s. This weight averaged influx is more realistic because takes into

The Simulations
For comparison of simulations of influx on root surface and cumulative uptake versus
observed data we use six set of input data sets extracted from literature. First, we compute the
influx on root surface of Cd by maize, sunflower, flax and spinach for two levels of
concentration (Stritsis et al. 2014) and the results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3. The
influxes obtained by our MB-FE model are averaged by using the formula (15). Second, we
compute the cumulative K and P uptake by pine seedling (Kelly et al. 1992) and the cumulative

8

NO-3 uptake by wheat; both to high nutrient concentrations (Jia-Xiang et al. 1991) and the
results are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Third, we compute the influx on root surface and
cumulative K uptake by maize, wheat and sugar beet for low K soil and soil with K addition
(Samal et al. 2010) and the results are shown in Tables 4, 5 and 6. Fourth, we compute the
influx on root surface and cumulative P uptake by peanut for low, intermediate and high soil
concentrations (Singh et al. 2003) and the results are shown in Tables 7, 8 and 9. Finally, in
order to verify the reliability of our moving boundary model and a 3D-dimensional
architectural model we compute the P uptake by wheat to low concentrations (Heppel et al.
2014) and the results are shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. From now on, we denote the simulations
as:
FB-NST 3.0: Original fixed boundary model NST 3.0,
FB-NST 3.0*: Fixed boundary model NST 3.0 with generalized nutrient uptake formula (14),
MB-FE: Moving boundary model solved by finite element method with generalized nutrient
uptake formula (14).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
From Table 1, we conclude that MB-FE model predicts the average influx on root surface
better than the FB-NST 3.0 always for different plants for two levels of concentrations. From
Figure 3, we obtain that the correlation factor for the linear regression among the observed and
predicted influxes is 0.73 for FB-NST 3.0 model and 0.89 for the MB-FE model. From Table 2
for high concentrations and immobile ions (K, P), very low Peclet numbers and low variation of
root length density (arboreal species) FB-NST 3.0, FB-NST 3.0* and MB-FE methods produce
similar results with small errors for the influx on root surface and the cumulative nutrient
uptake. From Table 3 for high concentrations and mobile ions ( NO3 ), very low Peclet numbers
and moderate variation of root length density FB-NST 3.0, FB-NST 3.0* and MB-FE models
produces similar results for the influx on root surface and the cumulative nutrient uptake. From
Table 4 for low and increasing level of P concentration the fixed (original NST 3.0 and
NST3.0*) and moving MB-FE models over predicting always except in the soil without P

9

addition (low concentrations). In this last case, MB-FE under predict with an acceptable error.
From Table 5, we conclude that to low concentrations both models FB-NST 3.0 (with temporal
average influx) and MB-FE (with weight average influx) under predict the average influx. For
increasing level of P addition both models over predict the average influx. In Table 6, we show
the average predicted/observed ratio for influx and cumulative uptake obtained by NST 3.0,
NST 3.0* and MB-FE models. We conclude that MB-FE predict better the average
predicted/observed ratio for the influx and the cumulative nutrient uptake. From Table 7, we
conclude that for ions as K the MB-FE model is the best numerical method to compute the
cumulative K uptake on a low K soil with K addition and without K addition for all cases. From
Table 8, we conclude that in almost all cases, FB-NST 3.0 produces better predicted influxes
except for maize without K addition. From Table 9, we conclude that the average/predicted
ratio of influx on root surface are similar although for the average predicted/observed ratio of
cumulative K uptake our MB-FE model presents a remarkable improvement in the predictions
showing an average predicted/observed ratio of cumulative K uptake (1.25) in front of those
obtained by NST 3.0 (15.6) and NST 3.0* (10.9). From Figure 4, we conclude that our MB-FE
model predict better the final cumulative P uptake at 10 days. Although cumulative uptake
predicted by the 3D model best fit to the experimental data we remark that this setting is
obtained by choosing the best branching mode that fits to the experimental curve. Thus, the 3D
model depends of the branching model while our MB-FE model is not depending but both
models produce the same final value for the cumulative uptake (see Figure 5)
The reason for which the MB-FE model is better than the other schemes (FB-NST 3.0 and
FB-NST 3.0*) is that these last methods do not satisfy the mass balance among the ions taken
by root and the ions remaining in soil. For the finite element method the ions remaining in soil
were calculated by the following expression:

N(t)  2(1  b) (t) 

R (t )

which, in the dimensionless interval (0, 1), is transformed in:

The mass balance for the program NTS 3.0 is not considered here because, obviously, to
10

compute the ions remaining in soil, the operation must be done with concentration profiles as a
function of time which has been calculated in fixed domain, but this result must be compared
with the cumulative uptake by a growing root, i.e., which has been calculated by integration in a
variable domain (the root growing in an volume of soil available that is variable in the time).
We remark that NTS 3.0 model satisfies the mass balance only in the case when the roots are
not growing. That is, the ion transport dynamics in a fixed soil domain is only consistent with a
fixed root domain; thus, our MB-FE model is a more realistic description because the nutrient
uptake by a variable root domain is consistent with the ions transport dynamics in a variable
soil domain. Figure 6 show the mass balance for the results obtained by the finite elements
method. The calculus was done with data extracted from Heppel (2014) for the P uptake by
wheat to low concentration. Loss mass is the difference among ions remaining in soil and
cumulative uptake, and it is produced by the implicit errors propagation in the numerical
method employed. Figure 7 illustrate the differences between the fixed boundary model and our
moving boundary model. Graph a shows the ion concentration on root surface C( s o ,t), Graph b
shows the influx on root surface J( s o ,t), Graph c shows the instantaneous nutrient uptake
2π s o J(t) (t) , and Graph d shows the cumulative nutrient uptake obtained being all the
graphics for the two models. Graph e shows the mass balance for the MB-FE model. The data
used were taken from Samal (2010) for the K uptake by maize without addition of K. For
comparison of Figure 6 and Figure 7e the loss mass is more pronounced for the K uptake by
maize although this is a known issue of finite element method when high gradients of
concentration are present.
The obtained improvements by our model are mainly due to three factors: a) the use of a
generalized formula for the cumulative nutrient uptake, b) the influxes obtained by the moving
boundary model and the cumulative uptake, which are obtained through integration in a
variable domain, while for the fixed boundary model the influxes are obtained in a fixed
domain and the cumulative uptake by integration is on a variable domain, c) the use of a
numerical method (finite element method) that ensures the balance of mass among the absorbed
ions and the remaining ions in soil while the finite difference method does not satisfy it. Finally,

11

in the light of these findings, conclusions drawn by previous papers (Hinsinger, 2011) could be
reinterpreted and our model could be included in larger field/catchment/climate scale models
something which is not practically possible with the 3D numerical simulations due to their high
computational burden. Using the model presented in this paper we have been able to give a new
insight into the discrepancies and inaccuracies present in previous models. However, to clarify
and verify this, more accurate simultaneous measurements of nutrient and water uptake together
with root branching structure development should be carried out. With this article we have
developed an alternative and consistent form to compute the absorption of nutrients by the root
system, thus allowing the results of the experiments can be analyzed in an easily interpretable
way and resolve some problems with the up scaling of single roots to the whole system through
the mass balance. Moreover, our moving boundary model open a new perspective for the study
of nutrient uptake in variable soil volume (to field) in order to solve the differences between
predicted uptake in fixed and variable soil volume (Silberbush, 2013), which it is not possible
with fixed boundary models and 3D architectural models based in concentrations and influxes
calculated in fixed domains.

APPENDIX IV: Simulations of transport and nutrient uptake by roots generate a set of
influxes data at the interface root-soil. From these inﬂuxes the cumulative nutrient uptake is
calculated integrating on a variable and growing domain (the root). The formulas used for these
integrals up to now are the following: The Claasen-Barber formula (1976)

where ti and tf are the initial and final times respectively, so is the root radius, (t i ) is the initial


root length, J(t) is the inﬂux on the root surface as a function of the time t and (t) is the rate of
root growth as a function of time. The product 2so J(t) (t) is the instantaneous nutrient uptake
by unit of time.
The last formula (21) can be also obtained from basic physics principles owing to J(t) is the
amount of nutrient by unit of time and unit of area that the root takes. That is to say that if we

15

multiply J(t) by the instantaneous lateral root area ( 2so (t) ) we get the instantaneous amount
of nutrients per unit of time that takes the root, integrating this versus time we get the proposed
formula (21).
In order to determine the range of validity of the formulas (18), (19) or (20) (or his equivalent
simplified expression given by (21)) a mass balance is performed according to the following
procedure: if we subdivide the integration interval (t i , t f ) from t i until an intermediate time t
and from this time until the final time t f then the formulas satisfy the mass balance when the
cumulative nutrient uptake U verify the following equality:

U(t i , t f )  U(t i , t)  U(t, t f )  SUM CUMULATIVE UPTAKE, for all t i  t  t f .

(22)

First, we analyse the Claassen-Barber formula (18). In order to make easier this study, we first
simplify the referred formula integrating by parts:

which is, in general, non-null.
In the particular case that the influx is constant, i.e. J(τ) = J in the interval (t i , t f ) , the last
expression (25) reduces to:

(26)

 2s0 J  (t)(t f  t i )  (t i )(t f  t)  (t f )(t  t i )
which is also, in general, non-null. Moreover, if we define the function

g(t)  (t)(t f  t i )  (t i )(t f  t)  (t f )(t  t i ) in the interval (t i , t f ) ,




we can see immediately that the derivative of g(t) is given by g(t)  (t)(t f  t i )  (t i )  (t f )




and therefore g(t)  0 if and only if (t) 

(t f )  (t i )
 Const. in the interval (t i , t f ) , that is,
tf  ti

the law of root growth must be linear, and then the function g(t)  g0  Const. in the interval

(t i , t f ) and therefore the expression (26) reduces to
UCB (t i , t)  UCB (t, t f )  UCB (t i , t f )  2s0 Jg0  Const.
in the interval (t i , t f ) . For this reason, for any law of root grow, different to the linear case, the
expression (25) is not null.

17

In the particular case that the influx is constant, i.e. J(τ) = J in the interval (t i , t f ) , and the law
of root growth is linear, i.e.,

(t)  (t i )  k(t  t i ) in the interval (t i , t f ) , then the last

expression (26) reduces to:

U CB (t i , t)  U CB (t, t f )  U CB (t i , t f ) 

 2s0 J  (t i )  k(t  t i )  (t f  t i )  (t i )(t f  t)   (t i )  k(t f  t i )  (t  t i )

(27)

 2s0 J  (t i )(t f  t i )  k(t  t i )(t f  t i )  (t i )(t f  t)  (t i )(t  t i )  k(t f  t i )(t  t i )  0
Thus, we have proved analytically that, for the Claassen-Barber formula (18) the condition (22)
is not satisfied, in general, except when the influx J is constant and the length of root grows
linearly with the time.

which is, in general, non-null.
In the particular case that the influx is constant, i.e. J(τ) = J in the interval (t i , t f ) , the last

18

expression (30) vanishes because the two brackets in the previous expression are null.
Therefore, when J is constant then UC verifies expression (22) regardless of the law of root
growth.
Finally, the simplified formula Reginato-Tarzia (21) and its original version (20) obviously
always verify condition (22) because of the linearity of the integral, that is:



t

ti

tf

tf

t

ti

J(t) (t)d   J(t) (t)d   J(t) (t)d

(31)

Thus, the formula of Reginato-Tarzia always verifies the condition (22) whatever be the
representative functions for the influx J(t) and the root length l(t). The obtained results show
that the Claassen-Barber and Cushman cumulative nutrient uptake formulas do not satisfy, in
general, the mass balance condition (22). In summary:
•

The Claassen-Barber formula (18) only verifies the mass balance when the influx is

constant (high concentrations) and the root grows linearly.
•

The Cushman formula (19) verifies the mass balance when the influx is constant

regardless of the law of growth.
•

The Reginato-Tarzia formula (20) and his simplified version (21) are formulas which

verify always the mass balance whatever be the representative functions for the influx and the
law of root growth.
APPENDIX V: In order to compare observed and simulated influx on the root surface, a more
adequate averaged influx is defined as (15). With this expression and taking into account the
cumulative nutrient uptake formula (21) we obtain the experimental formula of Williams
(1948). Thus, replacing (21) in (15) results:

Therefore, replacing this last expression in J we obtains the formula of William for the linear
case:

2so J 

Thus, cumulative uptake formula (21), the redefinition of averaged influx (15) and the
experimental formula of Williams are well posed. We remark that the formula of Williams is a
consequence of our definition of weight averaged influx (15) for all root growth law
expressions. This result cannot be obtained by using the temporal averaged influx except in the
constant influx case (for high concentrations). This result has been partially corroborated by an
experimental work of Silberbush and Gbur (1994).
Then, it is not convenient to choose the simulated temporal averaged influxes as an indicator of
a good prediction for the cumulative nutrient uptake when the concentration are low, because
by equation (21) the cumulative nutrient uptake U is proportional to the influx J only when this
is constant. Some papers in the literature use erroneously the simulated temporal averaged
influxes as a good prediction for low concentrations (Stritsis et al, 2014, Samal et al., 2010, and
Singh et al. 2003).
