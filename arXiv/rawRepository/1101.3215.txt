Abstract
Biophysical models are often populated by a large number of input parameters that are difficult to
predict or measure experimentally. The validity and robustness of a given model can be evaluated by a
sensitivity test to its input parameters. In this study, we performed local (based on a Taylor-like method)
and global sensitivity (based on Monte Carlo filtering techniques) analyses of a previously derived PAR1mediated activation model of endothelial cells. This activation model previously demonstrated that
peptide-activated PAR1 has a different receptor/G-protein binding affinity that favors Gαq activation over
Gα12/13 by approximately 800-fold. Interestingly, the present study shows that the parameter regulating
the binding rate of activated PAR1 to Gα12/13 is indeed important to obtain the expected RhoGTP
response. Moreover, we show that the parameters representing the rate of PAR1 deactivation and the
rate of PAR1 binding to Gq , are the most important parameters in the system. Finally, we illustrate
that the kinetic model considered in this study is robust and we provide complementary insights into the
biological meaning and importance of its kinetic parameters.

Introduction
Mathematical models of biophysical phenomena often involve a large number of input parameters [1–5],
such as reaction rates and initial concentrations, that must be either measured experimentally or inferred
from similar biological systems. Moreover, experimentally measured parameters carry uncertainties due to
experimental limitations, statistical analysis and different experimental conditions. One of the major goals
in systems biology is to estimate how sensitive a computational model is to variations of its parameters

2
and study the effect of the parameter uncertainties on the model response. Sensitivity analysis aims
at determining which parameters have the most influence on a predicted system behavior [6–9]. When
the notion of “influence” is made quantitatively precise, sensitivity analysis can constitute a reliable
robustness test for computational models [10].
In this study, we performed sensitivity analysis on the mathematical model of PAR1-mediated activation of endothelial cells of [4]. A schematic representation of the main signaling pathways analyzed in [4]
is shown in Fig. 1. A specific PAR1 agonist, SFLLRN, simultaneously activates two classes of G proteins:
Gq and G12/13 [11]. The α subunit of the Gq protein activates the β isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCβ),
which hydrolyze the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the second messengers
inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) [12]. The second messenger IP3 regulates the
activity of the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3 R) on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
allowing the rapid release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm [13,14]. Simultaneously, the α subunit of the G12/13
protein activates the small GTPase RhoA, known to promote cytoskeletal changes [15].
The signaling pathways described above are also common to a number of transduction systems mediated by G-protein coupled receptors in other cell types. We have recently published a model of PAR1
signaling in platelets ( [13]).
In [4], several kinetic parameters had to be inferred because they were unknown and/or difficult to
measure. In this work, we analyzed the influence of the chosen parameters to the system’s output. We
performed a sensitivity test based on the Taylor expansion of the output functions around the chosen
input parameters (local analysis) and a sensitivity test based on Monte Carlo sampling techniques of the
system parameters (global analysis). Our results show that although the two techniques implemented are
conceptually different, they lead, at least qualitatively, to consistent results. We show that the system
is not sensitive to the majority of the parameters chosen in [4] and we identify three important nodes in
the model. These results represent a further test for the validity of the model in [4]. Additionally, this
analysis will help design more refined computational models, and will have the ultimate goal of identifying
influential parameters and key signaling nodes with possible applications in biology and medicine.

Figure 1. Pictorial representation of PAR1-mediated signaling pathways in endothelial
cells. Upon cell stimulation by a PAR1 agonist peptide such as SFLLRN, PAR1 simultaneously
activates the two classes of G proteins, Gq and G12/13 . The α subunit of the Gq protein activates the β
isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCβ), which hydrolyze the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) to generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 then regulates the
activity of the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3 R) on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
allowing the rapid release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Simultaneously, the α subunit of the G12/13
protein activates the small GTPase Rho to promote cytoskeletal changes. Reproduced from [4].

that is, the variation of y caused by a variation ∆k in k is

∆y(t, k) = y(t, k̄ + ∆k) − y(t, k̄),

where y(t, k̄) is a solution of (1) at time t with parameters k = k̄. Assuming |∆k| ≪ 1, by the Taylor’s

5
expansion in the variables k about k̄,
∆y(t, k) = D(t, k̄)∆k + O(|∆k|2 )

(2)

where O(|∆k|2 ) is a q-dimensional vector infinitesimal of order no less than 2 with respect |∆k|, and
D(t, k̄) is the n × q matrix of the partial derivatives at k̄ of entries

Then one takes a dimensionless version of D(t, k̄) as a measure of the sensitivity of the system at time t,
with respect to the set of parameters k. Precisely one introduces a sensitivity matrix S(t, k̄) of entries

and takes Sij (t, k̄) as a measure of the sensitivity of the system state yi (t, k) at time t with respect to the
kinetic parameter kj about the nominal values k̄. In the context of the kinetic model in [4] we selected
the states
yi (t, k) = [Ca2+ ](t, k)

yi (t, k) = [RhoGTP](t, k)
and computed Sij (ti , k̄) at time ti where the nominal [Ca2+ ](t, k̄) and [RhoGTP](t, k̄) attain their maximum values, e.g.,
yi (ti , k̄) = max yi (t, k̄).

The variance is a measure of the influence, and relative importance, of the input k to the output y(t, k)
( [10]).
In practice the process is implemented in a less quantitative way, by trading the information coming from the variances σi (t) with those coming from a biologically motivated objective functional, gobj
depending on one or several yi (t, k) [26]. Having chosen an objective functional gobj, one identifies a
biologically acceptable range for the objective function gobj . For example for a threshold value g thres of
the objective functional gobj one might define [26]
gobj ≤ g thres

as the acceptable range

gobj > g thres

as the non acceptable range.

(9)

Then for each kj one determines the probability distributions f1 (kj ) and f2 (kj ) of those values of kj that
output the system in the acceptable or non acceptable range respectively. For each of these, and for each
kj , calculate the cumulative frequency distributions

cfℓ (kj ) =

Z

kj

kjmin

max

fℓ (η)dη

[kjmin ,kjmax ]

fℓ (kj )

,

ℓ = 1, 2

(10)

and calculate the Kolmogorov-Smirnov coefficients d1,2 (kj ) by the maximum distance function

d1,2 (kj ) =

sup

|cf1 (kj ) − cf2 (kj )|.

(11)

kj ∈[kjmin ,kjmax ]

These coefficients are taken as a measure of the relative importance of each parameter kj on the model
output. The larger the value of d1,2 (kj ), the more important is kj in producing the pre-defined system
output [6–8, 26].
In the context of the kinetic model of [4] the method is implemented as follows:

1. Select nominal values k̄ = k̄1 , . . . , k̄n as those originally adopted in the model of [4] (see Table 3).

As ranges in (8) we take intervals spanning from 1/10 to 10 times these nominal values, e.g.,
kjmax = 10k̄j ,

and

kjmin =

1
10 k̄j .

10
On a log10 scale these are symmetric intervals about log10 k̄j .
2. Generate M random n-tuples of numbers

km = (k1,m , . . . , kn,m )

for m = 1, . . . , M

by uniformly sampling the ln kj from their respective symmetric uncertainty ranges defined above. In
the simulations we used M = 10, 000. Different sampling distributions (e.g. gaussian, exponential) were
seen not to qualitatively affect the results.
3. Solve the system (1) for each random choice of km , and compute the functions y(t, km ). Solve also
(1) for the nominal values k = k̄ to get the functions y(t, k̄). Then for each i = 1, . . . , q introduce two
kinds of objective output functions of the mth trial as follows:
Objective Function at Times ti :
gobj;i (ti ; m) = [yi (ti , km ) − yi (ti , k̄)]2

(12)

where m ∈ {1, . . . , M } is the mth random trial described in the previous step and the times ti are defined in (5). For the states in (4), this function measures the variations of the of [Ca2+ ](tCa2+ , k) and
[RhoGTP](tRho , k), from their nominal maximum values. (see Table 4 columns two and three respectively).
Objective Function for Total Time:
Let z(k) be the total state output as in (6) and for i = 1, . . . , q set
Gobj;i (m) = [zi (km ) − zi (k̄)]2

(13)

where m ∈ {1, . . . , M } is the mth random trial. For the states in (4), the function Gobj;i (m) measures
the perturbation of the total outputs of Ca2+ and RhoGTP over the time course T of the experiment,
from their nominal values. The results are compared in Table 5 in columns two and three.

Dose responses for different concentrations of agonists are measured at tpeak

For small variations of k about its nominal vector k̄, the sensitivity of yimax (k) could be theoretically
“measured” as in (3), by the sensitivity matrix of entries

where the vector km is the output of the mth random trial. Threshold values and distribution functions

by tpeak

Rho respectively, and set

nominal values, whereas the second of (16) measures the variation of their times to peak tpeak

respectively, from their nominal values tCa2+ and tRhoGTP . The results are reported in Tables 6 and 7
respectively.

Results and Discussion
We performed sensitivity analysis of a previously derived PAR1-mediated activation model of endothelial
cells. We used two different techniques, one based on the Taylor expansion of the system’s output around
the nominal values of its input parameters kj and the second based on Monte Carlo sampling techniques
of the model parameters. The analysis based on the Taylor expansions (2) and leading to the sensitivity
matrices Sij (ti , k̄) in (3) and Σij (k̄) in (7), imposes two restrictions. The first is that |∆k| ≪ 1 with
the notion of “smallness” depending on a predefined notion of smallness of |∆y|. The second is that
these matrices measure the relative variation of yi and zi with respect to kj , by keeping all the remaining
parameters fixed, thereby neglecting the cumulative effects of ∆k.
The analysis based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, does not require the range of k to be small,
however it does require that the uncertainty distributions p(k) be known. The method leaves open the
choice of the objective function. This on the one hand affords the flexibility in tailoring the objective
function to specific experimental processes, and on the other hand allows non quantitative elements in

The two methods being complementary, we performed a sensitivity analysis by using both of them,
on the states in (4) arising from the mathematical model of [4].
First we analyzed the sensitivity of Ca2+ and RhoGTP at their nominal peak values (5) to variations of
the parameters k. Using the Taylor expansion method, we computed the sensitivity coefficients Sij (ti , k̄)
introduced in (3) and reported them in Table 1. Using the Monte Carlo filtering method, starting from
the objective function gobj;i (ti ; m) introduced in (12), we computed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov coefficients
by the distance function in (11), and reported them in Table 4.

respectively (12), (13), and (16) defined in Methods.
Then we analyzed how parameters fluctuations affect the total response of Ca2+ and RhoGTP over
the whole time course T of the experiments, quantified by the integrated states (6). We computed first
the sensitivity coefficients Σij (k̄) in (7), and reported in Table 2. Then, starting from the objective
function Gobj;i (m) introduced in (13), we computed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov coefficients as in (11) and
reported in Table 5.
Finally, by the same Monte Carlo filtering procedure we investigated the sensitivity of the peak values
of Ca2+ and RhoGTP and their relative times to peak for cumulative variations of all the parameters kj in
intervals of 2 orders of magnitude with respect to k̄j . The results are in Table 6 and Table 7 respectively.

Figure 4. Cumulative distribution functions of the influential kinetic parameter k26 for the
output yi = RhoGTP. The red curves indicate the distributions relative to the “acceptable” sets of
parameters, whereas the blue ones denote those corresponding to the “unacceptable” set of parameters
(see Methods). Panel A: Monte Carlo filtering method results at the nominal peak time ti . Panel B:
Monte Carlo filtering results for the entire time-course of the simulation, T = 600 s. Panel C: Monte
Carlo filtering results for the peak values [RhoGTP]max of the output function. Panel D: Monte Carlo
filtering results for the peak times tpeak
of the output function. The maximum distances between the
i
acceptable and unacceptable distributions, d1,2 are reported in Tables 4–7 respectively and are defined
in (11). The nominal peak time ti is defined in (5) and the objective functions used are respectively
(12), (13), and (16) defined in Methods.
As a way of analyzing and comparing the results in these tables, we deemed a parameter important for a given state yi (t, k) if its fluctuations about the nominal values k̄ produced sensitivity coefficients or Kolmogorov-Smirnov coefficients larger than 10%. Equivalently the state yi was deemed not
to be sensitive to variations of those parameters kj for which the Taylor sensitivity coefficients or the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov sensitivity coefficients were smaller than 10%.
The two methods are conceptually different and hence the sensitivity coefficients Sij (ti , k̄) and Σij (k̄)
introduced in (3) and (7) respectively, are not expected to be numerically similar to the KolmogorovSmirnov coefficients relative to the same processes. Nevertheless they exhibit similar qualitative results,

19
in the sense that most of the parameters that are important by the Taylor expansion method, are
likewise important by the Monte Carlo filtering method. We first discarded those parameters to which
neither Ca2+ and RhoGTP are sensitive by the quantitative criterion indicated above. Then in Table 8
we cross-listed those parameters to which Ca2+ or RhoGTP or both were sensitive. According to the
adopted criterion of importance, our analysis shows that k7 and k8 are the most important parameters
to reproduce the expected system behavior, because they respectively have ten and six entries in Table 8.
In Figs. 2 and 3 ,as an example, we show the cumulative distribution functions (10) calculated by Monte
Carlo filtering for the parameter k7 in the case yi = Ca2+ and yi = RhoGTP respectively. The red curves
represent the distribution of “acceptable” parameters, whereas the blue ones represent the distributions of
“unacceptable” parameters. In panel A we report the results relative to the sensitivity test performed with
the objective function calculated as in (12), panel B shows the results of the Monte Carlo filtering method
with the objective function estimated according to (13), and panel C and D are relative to the choice
of the objective functions in (16) respectively. Similarly, In Fig. 4, we show the cumulative distribution
functions (10) calculated by Monte Carlo filtering for the parameter k26 in the case yi = RhoGTP.
Examination of Tables 1–8 permits one to classify the input parameters into three broad categories:
RhoGTP-Only Sensitivity Parameters (four or more entries in Table 8)
k26 PAR1 to G13 binding rate;
k36 G13GTP-GEF dissociation rate;
k37 GEF hydrolyzing G13GTP;
k40 GEFG13∗ to Rho binding rate;
k43 Rho deactivation rate.
Variations of these parameter affect only RhoGTP and its functionals

introduced in (4)–(6), and (17). Neither small variations (Taylor’s expansion), nor large variations
(Monte-Carlo filtering) of these parameters about their nominal values affect Ca2+ and its functionals. This is an expected result as these parameters only belong to the RhoGTP module downstream of
G13 (see Fig. 1).
Interestingly, our sensitivity analysis found, independently of [4], that k26 , which represents PAR1
binding rate to G12/13 , is a key factor in this model to reproduce the experimental data. This emerges
from two different sensitivity analysis methods and constitutes a further test of validity for the signaling
model adopted in [4].
Ca2+ -Only Sensitivity Parameters (four or more entries in Table 8)
k19 rate of hydrolysis of GqGTP by PLCβ;
k22 PLCβ-PIP2 binding rate;
k25 IP3 rate of consumption;

introduced in (4)–(6), and (17). Small variations (Taylor’s expansion) or large variations (Monte-Carlo
filtering) of these parameters about their nominal values do not affect RhoGTP or its functionals. Again,
this is an expected result as these parameters only belong to the Ca2+ signaling module downstream Gq.
The presence of parameters that affect the Ca2+ output but not the RhoGTP output and viceversa
is due to the modular structure of the model in [4]. In this model, Gq and G13 pathways are described
by two separate computational modules with a common input, i.e. the activated PAR1 (Fig. 1).
The Ca2+ functionals in (19) are not sensitive to small variations of k25 (rate of IP3 consumption)
about its nominal value k̄25 (Taylor’s method for |∆k25 | ≤ 5%). They are however severely sensitive for
variations of k25 in the range (10−1 k̄25 , 10k̄25 ) (Monte Carlo filtering method).
In all cases however, the notion of “sensitivity” and “relevance” is the same by both methods, pointing
to a robustness and self-consistency of the model in [4].

Comparison of the sensitivity analysis results for the most important parameters reported in bold font in Tables 1–7. The symbols ×
mark the importance of a given parameter kj according to the different sensitivity test. Parameters k7 and k8 are important in the
majority of the sensitivity tests performed.

22
Ca2+ -RhoGTP Sensitivity Parameters
k7 PAR1 deactivation rate;
k8 PAR1-Gq binding rate;
k14 rate of release of βγ by Gq;
PAR1 acts on the common part of the Ca2+ and RhoGTP pathways and accordingly both of them and
their functionals are sensitive to both these parameters. While PAR1 deactivation rate k7 is important
to both Ca2+ and RhoGTP, the various components of the system respond differently to variations of
this parameter. First, Ca2+ and its functionals (19), are not sensitive to small variations of k7 about its
nominal value k̄7 (Taylor’s methods for |∆k7 | ≤ 5%). On the other hand all the Ca2+ functionals are
very sensitive for variations of k7 in the range (10−1 k̄7 , 10k̄7 ) (Monte Carlo filtering method).
Contrarily RhoGTP and its functionals are very sensitive to any variation k7 , small or large, and by
whatever method sensitivity is evaluated (Taylor or Monte Carlo filtering).
Finally, we observe that the pathways analyzed in this work are shared in a number of signaling
cellular systems. In a recent work, we devised a mathematical model of PAR1-mediated signaling in
human platelets [2] that shares several features with the model in [4]. For these reasons and for the
generality of the methods adopted in this work, the conclusions of this study can, at least qualitatively,
be extended to the model in [2].
