Abstract. Dynamics in biological networks are in general robust against several
perturbations. We investigate a coupled map network as a model motivated by
gene regulatory networks and design systems which are robust against phenotypic
perturbations (perturbations in dynamics), as well as systems which are robust against
mutation (perturbations in network structure). To achieve such a design, we apply
a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Analysis based on the maximum Lyapunov
exponent and parameter sensitivity shows that systems with marginal stability, which
are regarded as systems at the edge of chaos, emerge when robustness against network
perturbations is required. This emergence of the edge of chaos is a self-organization
phenomenon and does not need a fine tuning of parameters.

1. Introduction
Complex dynamical behaviors on a network can be found in a variety of biological
networks, such as gene regulatory networks, neural networks and food-web. Such
systems share a common characteristic: observed dynamics are robust against
disturbance introduced in its dynamics, as well as against disturbance in its network [1,
2, 3]. For example, gene expression patterns obtained thorough transcription-translation
regulations are kept stable in spite of extrinsic noises (i.e., perturbations in dynamics)
and mutations (i.e., perturbations in a network). It seems reasonable to think that
robustness against environmental perturbations has been evolutionarily developed for
adapting to noisy environments. There are also several advantages in having mutational
robustness - it buffers against deleterious mutations. Recently, robustness in biological
networks has attracted much attention of many researchers and has been thought to be
one of fundamental properties of life [1, 2, 3, 4].
This point of view naturally gives rise to the question: what kind of system emerges
when only robustness is required ? The answer to this question will be helpful for
understanding the design principle of living systems. In this paper, we investigate
a coupled chaotic map network motivated by gene regulatory networks and show that
systems at the edge of chaos are selected with only the requirement of robustness against
network perturbations.
It has long been hypothesized that living systems favor the edge of chaos, where
stability and chaoticity coexist. Originally, Kauffman [5] introduced the Boolean
network model (N-K model) as a model of a gene regulatory network, and proposed
the hypothesis that living systems prefer the edge of chaos because it allows systems
to have complex behaviors [5]. Here we propose an alternative scenario, specifically
that the requirement of having robustness against network perturbations drives living
systems to the edge of chaos, regardless of whether or not staying at the edge of chaos
is beneficial for living systems. In other wards, the edge of chaos can emerge as a
byproduct of the robustness.
2. Model
We propose a coupled map system motivated by gene regulatory networks. Unlike
the N-K model, each element in this model has its own dynamics. Assuming that
xti ∈ {−1 ≤ xti ≤ 1} is the gene expression of the i-th gene at time step t, the single
gene dynamics are written as xt+1
= G(xti ). These dynamics mimic multiple processes
i
in an expression of a single gene. In the presence of N genes, the dynamics of xti are
expressed as
xt+1
= (1 − ǫ)G(xti ) + ǫ

where ǫ is a coupling constant. Wij describes the strength of the interaction acting from

for each i. We call the matrix W , whose ij element is Wij , a network. Here we choose
the logistic map g(x, a) = 1 − ax2 as G(·). We use the model parameters a and ǫ as
(a, ǫ) = (1.8, 0.1). This choice indicates that a single disconnected gene exhibits chaotic
dynamics. A reason of this choice of G(·) is that a single gene expression is expected to
be complex due to multiple processes underlying it We impose an additional constraint
on W : the number of input links k to each gene is fixed. We note that in the case of
Wij = 1/(N − 1) for all (i, j), the system becomes the globally coupled map (GCM) [6]
and it shows highly chaotic behaviors at the parameters (a, ǫ) = (1.8, 0.1). In contrast
to the N-K model, variables of this model take continuous values and a linear stability
analysis can be applied.
In this model, the network W is regarded as a genotype while the attractor
of dynamics xt is regarded as a phenotype. Our goal is to design networks under
the two different design principles: robustness against phenotypic perturbations (i.e.,
perturbations in the dynamics of gene x) and robustness against genotypic perturbations
(i.e., perturbations on network W ). In both cases, only network W is tuned.
3. Design of Robust Network Against Perturbations in Dynamics
Let us start with the first design principle, namely robustness against perturbations in
dynamics. In other words, we are aiming to design a system with a stable attractor.
For this end, we use Lyapunov exponent analysis and a multicanonical Monte Carlo
method [7, 8].
Once a network W is given, the finite time maximum Lyapunov exponent λ1 [9] is
calculated for the dynamical system in Eq. (1), starting from a given initial state x0∗
i §.
′
We perform the simulation up to T = 1500 and regard the first T = 1000 steps as
transient and discard them.
Our aim here is to sample networks with negative λ1 , which indicates that dynamics
of a network is stable. Such networks are expected to be rare for large N, because
dynamics tend to be chaotic at the present parameters. We define the probability
density of λ1 as
D(λ) =

Z

0

δ(λ1 (W ) − λ)p(W ) Πi,j dWij ,

where δ is the Dirac δ-function, and p(W ) is the prior probability density that a network
W appears under random sampling. We consider here a network ensemble in which p(W )
P
is a uniform distribution under the constraints of Wii = 0 and N
j Wij = 1, given by
p(W ) ∝ Πi δ(

θ(Wij ) − k)δ(Wii ),

where θ(z) is a function that satisfies θ(z) = 1 for z 6= 0 and θ(z) = 0 for z = 0.
If a random sampling method is adopted in order to sample a network with “rare”
value of λ1 with probability D(λ1 ), 1/D(λ1) samples are required at least. If an annealing

i = sin(i) is used. We confirm that the choice of the initial state does not
affect the results.

method or an steepest descent method is adopted instead, we would obtain only a
network with negative λ1 but could not estimate D(λ1 ), which plays a key role in the
further analysis. Alternatively, we apply multicanonical Monte Carlo method [7, 10, 11],
which has been used in fields of statistical physics, such as spin glass [12, 13] and other
studies [14, 15]. This method allows us to sample networks with negative λ1 efficiently
and to estimate D(λ1 ).
Our multicanonical Monte Carlo strategy adopted in this study is to perform
random walks in λ1 space by generating a Markov chain, where each step is biased
inversely proportional to the probability D(λ1), and thereby it enables us to obtain a
flat histogram in λ1 space, namely to equally sample λ1 whose D(λ1 ) are many orders
of magnitude different. In order to generate the Markov chain in multicanonical Monte
Carlo, a key quantity is the weight function w(λ1 ) of λ1 . If we have w(λ1 ) that is
inversely proportional to D(λ1 ), networks with various λ1 value are generated one after
another, using the Markov process described in the Appendix (i). As a consequence,
a uniform distribution of λ1 (i.e., a flat histogram of λ1 ) is obtained. We call these
procedures as “random walk in λ1 space”. Details of the algorithm are given in the
Appendix (i) and (ii). However, neither w(λ1 ) nor D(λ1 ) are known a priori. In this
study, the Wang and Landau algorithm [12, 13] is used to construct and to tune the
weight function w(λ1 ). Details of the implementation are given in Appendix (ii).
Figure 1 shows the calculated densities D(λ1 ) of λ1 for the fixed input degree
k = 2 − 5. Using density D(λ1 ) in Fig. 1, the probability that networks with negative
R
λ1 are observed under random sampling is calculated by P (λ1 < 0) = λ0a D(λ1)dλ1 . We
estimate P (λ1 < 0) with k = 2 − 5 and k = N − 1, which are shown in Fig. 2. Each
P (λ1 < 0) shows that a stable attractor becomes increasingly rare as N or k increases,
indicating that these systems are in the chaotic phase (we define that a system is in the
chaotic phase when only positive values of λ1 appear as N → ∞). These results are
consistent with the behavior of GCM with (a, ǫ) = (1.8, 0.1) [6].
4. Design of Robust Network Against Perturbations in Network
Using the second design principle, we design systems that are robust against genotypic
perturbations (i.e., network perturbations). In other words, we design, using a
multicanonical Monte Carlo method, networks W whose trajectory on the attractor
hardly changes when a small network perturbation δW is added. We define the
parameter sensitivity and use it as a guiding function of the robustness.
Sensitivity analysis using parameter sensitivity has been developed and applied in
various fields [16, 17]. While most of these studies have dealt with continuous time
systems, we define the parameter sensitivity for discrete time systems as follows.
Let us denote the set of elements in W in Eq. (1) by a vector W . When a small
network perturbation δW is introduced into W at t = T ′ , the displacement between
unperturbed trajectory xt (W ) and perturbed trajectory xt (W + δW ) is approximated
by (∂xt /∂W )δW , where ∂xt /∂W is a N×N 2 matrix. We call this matrix the sensitivity

Robustness Leads Close to the Edge of Chaos in Coupled Map Networks

matrix ∆t , and the time evolution of ∆t is given by
∂F
∂F t
∆ +
,
∆t+1 =
∂x
∂W
where ∂F /∂x is the Jacobian matrix and ∂F /∂W is the parametric Jacobian matrix.
It should be noticed that the two trajectories xt (W ) and xt (W + δW ) coincide for
t ≤ T ′ , and thus ∆t = 0 for t ≤ T ′ . The growth rate of the displacement between
xt (W + δW ) and xt (W ) with respect to the perturbation vector δW is obtained by
∆t δ Ŵ , where δ Ŵ = δW /|δW |. The maximum value of |∆t δ Ŵ | at time step t is given
by the maximum singular value σ1t of ∆t matrix. σ1t can be obtained by performing
the singular value decomposition of ∆t . σ1t diverges for t → ∞ when the maximum
Lyapunov exponent of the trajectory is positive. On the other hand, σ1t oscillates or
converges to a constant value when the maximum Lyapunov exponent is negative. Note
that no parameters except for W are perturbed in this study. Once a network W is
given, ∆t and its σ1t are estimated for each time step. We define parameter sensitivity
γ as the logarithm of an average of σ1t along the trajectory:
γ = ln

PTmax −1

Tmax − T ′
t=T ′

!

Here, we regard the first T ′ − 1 steps of the trajectory as transient, and discard them.
We use T ′ = 1000 and Tmax = 1500.
Our goal is to sample networks with small γ. However, networks with positive
λ1 tend to have large γ. For this reason, and because almost all networks sampled
by random sampling should have positive λ1 , random sampling is not suitable for the
sampling of networks with small γ. Thus, we again apply multicanonical Monte Carlo
and perform random walks in λ1 space with the same w(λ1) estimated above. These
random walks facilitate efficient sampling of the networks with small γ, because networks
with negative λ1 are efficiently sampled. We also obtain the two-dimensional density
D(λ1 , γ) of λ1 and γ as follows: we construct the two-dimensional histogram h(λ1 , γ)
through the random walks, and, after h(λ1 , γ) is constructed, D(λ1 , γ) is calculated by
D(λ1 , γ) ∝

h(λ1 , γ)
.
w(λ1 )

Figure 3 shows D(λ1 , γ) for N = 10 and 20 with k = 2 and 5. These results show
that although networks with small γ can take various values for λ1 , the vast majority of
such networks with small γ have negative but near zero λ1 (see red rectangles in Fig. 3).
Figure 5 shows an example of an optimized network with small γ. Although we have
examined network topology of optimized networks sampled by multicanonical Monte
Carlo, no characteristic difference was found in topology between networks with small
γ and those with large γ.
This indicates that, when robustness against network perturbations is optimized
(i.e., when γ is minimized), networks with negative but near zero λ1 will appear with
high probability. This appearance of systems with marginal stability can be interpreted

as self-organization of the edge of chaos. In this scenario, the system automatically
comes close to the edge of chaos without tuning parameters.
In order to confirm that optimization of obustness against network perturbations
leads to the emergence of the edge of chaos, we perform simulated annealing. Here, we
define a parameter sensitivity Γ without the linear approximation:
* PT

max

Γ=

t=T ′

|xt (W + δW ) − xt (W )|
Tmax − T ′

+

,

δW
where hiδW represents an average over realization of δW . We minimize this Γ using the
simulated annealing. The average is taken over 100 samples of δW , and the parameters
T ′ = 1000 and Tmax = 1500 are used. In each step of the simulated annealing, a
transition from the current state W to a proposed candidate W ′ is accepted if and
only if the ratio exp[−β(Γ(W ′ ) − Γ(W ))] is smaller than a random number uniformly
distributed in (0, 1]. Here, temperature 1/β is lowered with the progress of simulation
step n. We choose this β as β = 10n/3 (for n < 30000) and β = ∞ (for n ≥ 30000).
Note that the function Γ that we aim to minimize fluctuates due to the finite sample
size of δW , and thus occasionally an inferior network could be accepted or a suitable
network could be rejected, even for β = ∞.
In Fig. 4, we plot λ1 and Γ for networks that are sampled during the simulated
annealing. These results indicate that most networks obtained in the last half of the
simulations (n ≥ 30000) are in the region −0.05 ≤ λ1 < 0, and we regard this region as
the edge of chaos.

5. Discussion
In summary, using multicanonical Monte Carlo method, we have observed emergence
of the systems at the edge of chaos as a self-organization phenomenon with only the
requirement of robustness against network perturbations, which can be interpreted as
mutational robustness in the context of the gene regulatory network. We have also
performed simulated annealing and confirmed this scenario. We emphasize that no
fine tuning of other parameters, such as number of input links k or model parameters
(a, ǫ), is needed. The emergence of the edge of chaos with the requirement of
mutational robustness is somehow counterintuitive because robustness against network
perturbations (mutational robustness) seems to be positively correlated with dynamical
stability. The mechanism of the emergence of the edge of chaos, revealed by a
multicanonical Monte Carlo method, is as follows: when mutational robustness is
required, selected systems need to have λ1 ≤ 0 because γ for λ1 > 0 diverges as t → ∞.
The density D(λ1) is an increasing function for λ1 ≤ 0. Therefore, the density of
networks becomes largest at λ1 ∼ 0 under the condition λ1 ≤ 0 (see Fig. 1 and 3, red
rectangles in Fig. 3 indicate the degeneracy of a large numbers of networks with small
γ). Due to this degeneracy, systems have a high probability of being at the edge of
chaos.

Similar results have been found in recent numerical studies of gene regulatory
network [18, 19, 20], indicating that systems that have the ability to reach a stable fixed
point with transient chaotic behavior appear with only the requirement of robustness
against genotypic perturbations. These results can be also interpreted as the emergence
of the edge of chaos. However, it has not until now been explained why such systems
are selected. In this paper, we have proposed a mechanism for the emergence of the edge
of chaos, namely that the vast majority of networks that are robust against network
perturbations have marginal dynamical stability, and thus networks at the edge of chaos
are selected when robustness against network perturbations is required. Note that
the converse is not necessarily true: networks with marginal dynamical stability are
not always robust against network perturbations. It is reasonable to think that this
degeneracy of marginally stable networks appears whenever parameters are set in the
chaotic phase, in which chaotic systems are obtained under random construction of
systems for N → ∞. Based on the fact that similar results were found in the previous
studies [18, 19, 20, 21], most of what we discussed here seems not to depend on the
details of the specific model.
Mutational robustness seems to be a natural requirement for living systems. The
present study provides the following possible scenario for the emergence of the edge of
chaos: the requirement of mutational robustness drives organisms to the edge of chaos,
whether or not staying in such a regime is preferable for living systems. In fact, several
recent studies have suggested that gene networks of real organisms stay at the edge of
chaos [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. We also expect that the scenario is also applicable for the
explanation of criticality in neural dynamics [27, 28, 29], because synaptic connections
seem to be designed so that neuron firing patterns do not change radically due to
perturbations in the connection. The concept presented here that robustness against
network perturbations leads to the edge of chaos may also provide insights into the
design of artificial robust networks.

Appendix: (i) details of the implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm
We start from a randomly generated network W with N genes and k input links for
each gene. In each step of the Monte Carlo method, we generate a candidate of a
new network W candidate by (1) exchanging two links or by (2) resampling interaction
strengths. We choose (1) or (2) with probability 1/2. Process (1) (Exchanging links)
is performed as follows: a nonzero element of Wij is randomly chosen and the another
element in j-th row Wi′ j that satisfies both i′ 6= i and i′ 6= j is chosen randomly and
then these two links are exchanged. Process (2) (resampling interaction strengths) is
performed as follows: two nonzero elements Wij and Wi′ j are randomly chosen, and
then Wij and Wi′ j are replaced by resampled elements Wij′ and Wi′′ j , where Wij′ is drawn
from a random number uniformly distributed in (0, Wij + Wi′ j ] and Wi′′ j is calculated by
Wi′′ j = Wij + Wi′ j − Wij′ . After a new candidate W candidate is obtained, λ1 (W candidate )
is calculated from the dynamical system in Eq. (1). A transition from the current state
W current to a proposed candidate W candidate is accepted if and only if the Metropolis
ratio [30, 31], R = w(λ1 (W candidate ))/w(λ1(W current)) is smaller than a random number
uniformly distributed in (0, 1]. By this procedure, we update the current state to a new
state W new . Note that we adopt W current as W new when the W candidate is rejected.
Appendix: (ii) details of the construction of w(λ1 ) (the Wang-Landau
algorithm)
We divide the given prescribed interval λa < λ1 < λb into small bins of width δλ,
and assume that w(λ1 ) is same within each bin. We start from a uniform w(λ1 ) in

Robustness Leads Close to the Edge of Chaos in Coupled Map Networks

λa < λ1 < λb . One step of the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm using w(λ1 ) is performed
as described in the Appendix (i), and then, w(λ1 ) is modified as w(λ1 (W new )) →
w(λ1 (W new ))/f , where f is the modification factor. By this modification, w(λ1 )
of frequently visited bins are made smaller, and thus the appearance of such λ1 is
suppressed. The modification factor is set as f = e at the beginning of the simulation,
and the factor is gradually reduced through the simulation to approach to unity in the
manner described in [12, 13]. We accumulate the number of samples in λ1 ∼ λ1 + δλ1
to make a histogram h(λ1 ). The Metropolis - Hastings step and the modification of
w(λ1 ) are repeated until the histogram h(λ1 ) is sufficiently flat in λa < λ1 < λb . This
procedure allows us to construct w(λ1 ) that is inversely proportional to D(λ1 ). Once
such w(λ1) is obtained, w(λ1) is fixed. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using this
w(λ1 ) enables a uniform sampling in λ1 space (i.e., a random walk in λ1 space) by
generating a Markov chain, because each step is biased proportional to D(λ1 )−1 and
probability of the candidate λ1 is proportional to D(λ1 ). Note that in this study we
determine λa and λb so that P (λ1 < 0) is precisely calculated; we adopt the criteria that
P (λa )/P (λ1 = 0) ∼ 10−2 and P (λb)/P (λ∗ ) ∼ 10−2 , where λ∗ is the value of λ1 for the
peak of D(λ∗ ) (see Fig. 1).

N = 4 ∼ 14 and −0.15 < λ1 < 0.35 for N = 20. (c) Densities are calculated in the
prescribed interval −0.28 < λ1 < 0.35 for N = 6 ∼ 14 and −0.15 < λ1 < 0.35 for
N = 20. (d) Densities are calculated in the prescribed interval −0.28 < λ1 < 0.35 for
N = 6, −0.28 < λ1 < 0.37 for N = 8 ∼ 10, −0.20 < λ1 < 0.37 for N = 12 ∼ 14 and
−0.1 < λ1 < 0.37 for N = 20.

Figure 2:
Network size dependence of the probability P (λ1 < 0) of networks with negative λ1 .
The logarithms of P (λ1 < 0) for k = 2 − 5 decrease linearly or slightly faster than linear
as functions of N. The logarithm of P (λ1 ) for k = N − 1 decreases quadratically.

Figure 3:
The two-dimensional density D(λ1 , γ) of λ1 and γ for (a) N = 10, k = 2, (b) N = 10,
k = 5 (c) N = 20, k = 2 (d) N = 20, k = 5. A large fraction of networks with small γ
degenerate in the region indicated by the red rectangles. The black lines indicate λ = 0.
It should be noted that γ of λ1 > 0 diverges, when (Tmax − T ′ ) → ∞.

Figure 4:
Time series of sensitivity Γ (upper panel) and the maximum Lyapunov exponent λ1
(lower panel) in the course of simulated annealing. The red and blue lines indicate
results for N = 10 with k = 2 and N = 10 with k = 5, respectively. λ1 and Γ are
calculated in the same simulations. The inverse temperature is set to be β = ∞ in the
last half of these simulations.

Figure 5:
An example of an optimized network with small γ for N = 10 and k = 2. λ1 and γ
calculated from this network are λ1 = −0.068 and γ = −0.008, respectively. Thickness
of allows indicate strength of connection Wij .
