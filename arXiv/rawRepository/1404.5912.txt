Abstract
When there is conspicuous under-exploitation of a limited resource it is worth asking,
what mechanisms allow presumably valuable resources to be left unused? Evolutionary
biologists have generated a wide range of hypotheses to explain this, ranging from interdemic group selection to selfishly prudent individual restraint. We consider a situation
in which, in spite of high intraspecific competition, individuals leave most of a key resource unexploited. The parasitic wasp that does this finds virtually all host egg clusters
in a landscape, but parasitizes only about a third of the eggs in each, and then leaves
a deterrent mark around the cluster. We first test, and reject, a series of system-specific
simple constraints that might limit full host exploitation, such as asynchronous maturation of host eggs. We then consider classical hypotheses for the evolution of restraint.
Prudent predation and bet-hedging fail as explanations because the wasp lives as a large
well-mixed population. Also, we find no individual benefits to the parasitoid of developing in a sparsely parasitized host nest. However an optimal foraging model, including
empirically measured costs of superparasitism and hyperparasitism, can explain through
individual selection, both the consistently low rate of parasitism and marking.

Introduction
Under strong resource competition, a limiting resource is predicted to become entirely
depleted. However, because of population level responses to resource availability, this
does not generally occur, especially in persistent predator-prey or host-parasite interactions (Abrams, 2000; Hassell, 2000). Here we consider an animal that, at an individual
rather than population level, consistently does not deplete an apparently available resource. We examine the consistently low resource use by a parasitoid, Hyposoter horticola
(Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). This wasp parasitizes the butterfly Melitaea cinxia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in Åland, Finland. It locates host egg clusters in the landscape
during the weeks before they are ready to be parasitized (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten,
2004), and monitors the egg clusters, using memorized visual landmarks (van Nouhuys
and Kaartinen, 2008). The wasp parasitizes a portion of nearly every host egg cluster in
the landscape, with the great majority of the parasitism in each cluster due to one female
(Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript a). This behavior leads to a uniform rate of parasitism, largely independent of scale of observation and host density (van Nouhuys and
Hanski, 2002). Here we address why individual H. horticola, which are clearly resource
limited, parasitize just a fraction of the hosts available to them, mark the clusters they
parasitize, and are deterred by the markings left by others.
We use a combination of empirical and theoretical methods to assess nine mechanisms
that could potentially lead to a rate of parasitism that is systematically low. Aspects of this
topic have been addressed for parasitoid wasps empirically (Cronin and Strong, 1993a,b;
1

Bouskila et al., 1995) and theoretically (Ayal and Green, 1993; Rosenheim and Mangel,
1994; Driessen and Bernstein, 1999). Here we present a broad integrated analysis in one
empirical research system. The interaction between M. cinxia and H. horticola is especially
suitable for this study because it is simple, with a parasitoid supported by a single host
species. Additionally, the population and behavioral ecology for both the host (Hanski,
2011; Ojanen et al., 2013) and parasitoid (van Nouhuys and Hanski, 2002; van Nouhuys
and Kaartinen, 2008) have been well studied on a large spatial scale.

Research System
The host butterfly M. cinxia has a Eurasian distribution. In the Åland islands of Finland
it lives as a metapopulation in a network of 4000 small meadows over an area of 3500
km2 . The meadows are surveyed annually, with three to five hundred of them occupied
by the butterfly in any given year (Ojanen et al., 2013). Individual butterflies lay clusters
of eggs on the host plants (Plantago lanceolata and Veronica spicata: Plantaginaceae) in June
(Kuussaari et al., 2004). The eggs take two to three weeks to develop, then, shortly before
hatching, essentially all of the egg clusters are parasitized by H. horticola (van Nouhuys
and Hanski, 2002; van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004). The wasp is solitary and mobile,
foraging on a larger scale than does the host (Kankare et al., 2005). It has no hosts other
than M. cinxia (Shaw et al., 2009). Typically females spend 20 to 60 minutes parasitizing
a host egg cluster (Couchoux and van Nouhuys, 2014), ovipositing in about a third of
the eggs (field conditions: N = 43, x̄ = 0.31 (±0.12 SD); laboratory: N = 10, x̄ = 0.32
(±0.07 SD); comparison of field to laboratory conditions using Welch’s t-test: t22.7 = 0.279,
p = 0.393) (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004). Afterwards the wasp marks the leaves
around the egg cluster, which deters conspecifics, and perhaps itself, from parasitizing the
remaining hosts (Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript a).

Plausible explanations for partial resource use
Physical limitations to parasitism
Multiple physical and physiological limitations might restrict the wasp’s ability to parasitize an entire host egg cluster. These are: Wasp egg limitation – an individual may have
few eggs available at a given time, or it may only have enough eggs to parasitize a small
fraction of hosts encountered over a lifetime (Bouskila et al., 1995; Mangel, 2006; Rosenheim, 2011); Host egg cluster architecture – not all of the host eggs in a cluster may be
accessible to the parasitoid ovipositor (Weseloh, 1972; Hondo et al., 1995); Host immune
defense – a fraction of hosts may kill the wasp eggs through immune defense (Lavine and
Strand, 2002); and Ephemeral resource availability – if host eggs develop asynchronously
within a cluster, only a fraction may be susceptible while the wasp is present (Briggs and
Latto, 1996). Alternatively, if the eggs mature synchronously, while they are susceptible

2

the wasp may only have enough time to parasitize some of them (Nakamichi et al., 2008).
Although each physical/physiological constraint could explain fractional parasitism, none
would explain why a wasp applies or respects deterrent markings of the host egg clusters.
Behavioral limitations to parasitism
We next consider classical ecological and evolutionary scenarios that have been used to
explain behavioral restraint in other resource-exploiter systems.
Prudent predation (parasitism). Restrained harvesting strategies increase resource
availability for future generations. This would only benefit the specific individuals practicing restraint if the species lived in small populations with limited mixing (Slobodkin, 1974;
Smith, 1964). Prudence has been used to explain reduced predation in some predator-prey
interactions (Wilson, 1978). However, the M. cinxia - H. horticola system does not meet the
requirements for this. While the host butterfly does live as networks of local populations
in a fragmented landscape (Hanski, 2011), individual wasps are dispersive (van Nouhuys
and Hanski, 2002), with overlapping ranges, and only very weak geographic genetic structure (Kankare et al., 2005). Thus there is no opportunity for the evolution of prudence.
Bet-hedging. Another possible mechanism for partial resource exploitation is distribution of reproductive effort. This can reduce variability in the expected number of surviving
offspring. For instance, in temporally varying environments an organism may decrease
year-to-year variation by spreading reproductive effort over multiple time periods (Gillespie, 1977; Rajon et al., 2014). While conditions do vary between years for H. horticola
(Hanski and Meyke, 2005; van Nouhuys et al., 2003), an individual can only reproduce in
a single season, so temporal risk spreading between years is not possible.
In spatially structured heterogeneous environments, individuals in very small populations may increase fitness by spreading offspring over the landscape. This would decrease
the probability of extinction of a particular genotype. But, in large well mixed populations there is no long term selective benefit to such reduced variance of individual success
(Gillespie, 1977; Mangel, 2006; Hopper, 1999). Melitaea cinxia larval nest mortality varies
spatially (Hanski and Meyke, 2005; van Nouhuys et al., 2003). However, as noted, the population of H. horticola wasps is large and well mixed, so bet-hedging individuals would not
predominate. Because we rule out both prudence and bet-hedging, neither are considered
further.
Cooperative benefits. Cooperatively feeding gregarious caterpillars such as M. cinxia
rely on each other for survival (Kuussaari et al., 2004; Costa, 2006). If parasitized caterpillars perform poorly, then the performance of highly parasitized groups would be low,
decreasing individual parasitoid fitness, perhaps below the threshold necessary for the
survival of the parasitoids in a host nest. Selection due to this would favor restraint in
oviposition by parasitoid females.

Optimal foraging, including mortality due to superparasitism and avoidance of hyperparasitism. The final hypotheses for evolution of behavioral restraint are based on a
classical optimal foraging model, wherein an individual is predicted to stop using a resource patch once the marginal benefit turns negative. For instance, the marginal value
theorem predicts that individuals balance time or energy spent at a given resource patch
with that spent traveling to a new resource patch (Charnov, 1976). As a forager depletes
a resource patch it experiences diminished returns. At some point the expected gain of
leaving to find a new patch will exceed the reward of remaining, even taking into account
transit time, and the forager is predicted to leave. There are many examples of consumers
leaving resource patches because of diminished returns (Sih, 1980), and this has been modeled for parasitoid wasps (Wajnberg, 2006; Eliassen et al., 2009). We first consider a basic
optimal foraging model that assumes H. horticola experiences diminishing returns with
increased time at a host egg cluster (resource patch). The longer it stays, the more likely
it is to encounter host eggs that it has already parasitized. Superparasitism is costly to
solitary parasitoids (Rosenheim and Mangel, 1994). We measure the actual amount of superparasitism that occurs, and compare the outcome of the model when one parasitoid
successfully develops within a superparasitized host, and when superparasitism causes
mortality of all parasitoid eggs in a host. We then consider the risk of hyperparasitism
(parasitism of the parasitoid), which is another potentially density dependent factor leading to diminishing returns. In order to do this realistically we use field data to measure
the association of rate of hyperparasitism with rate of parasitism, and determine how it
changes the outcome of the optimal foraging model.

Methods and Results
In the following sections we present both the experimental tests of, and results for, each
potential mechanism of partial parasitism, excluding prudent parasitism and bet-hedging
which were eliminated above. We start by considering the four simple biological explanations.
Species specific biological constraint: wasp egg limitation

Egg-limited parasitoids do not produce sufficient eggs to parasitize all of the hosts they
can encounter in a patch or during a lifetime. They must thus choose which hosts to
use (Jervis et al., 2001; Rosenheim, 2011). Melitaea cinxia egg clusters contain only about
150 eggs (Saastamoinen, 2007). Couchoux and van Nouhuys (2014) found that female
H. horticola contain x̄ = 550 (±173 SD) mature eggs in their oviducts under laboratory
conditions. Because H. horticola is synovigenic, it is likely to mature new eggs to replace
those that are used (Jervis et al., 2001). A large-scale study of the genetic structure of H.
horticola in Åland (Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript b) showed that, on average,

4

a successful mother parasitizes about four egg clusters, two of which survive the winter
(van Nouhuys et al., 2003). So, although evolutionary pressures may have brought H.
horticola to this point, at present in Åland the wasp is not strongly egg limited. Most
individuals successfully parasitize significantly fewer hosts than they have eggs, and egg
limitation cannot dictate the average foraging behavior. Additionally, if host egg clusters
differed in quality and wasps were choosey, then the rate of parasitism is predicted to vary
greatly from cluster to cluster, which it does not, even with respect to egg cluster size (van
Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004; Couchoux and van Nouhuys, 2014).
Species specific biological constraint: Host egg cluster architecture

Melitaea cinxia lay eggs in mounds. For some insect species the inner eggs in mounds are
inaccessible to the parasitoid ovipositor (Weseloh, 1972; Hondo et al., 1995), with up to
half of the eggs in the protected inner layers (Friedlander, 1985). To find out if H. horticola
is restricted to the outer eggs we compared parasitism rates of inner and outer layers
of host egg clusters. Eleven egg clusters were exposed to parasitism by H. horticola in
the laboratory (see Appendix A for methods). Seven wasps were used, with three each
parasitizing a single cluster, and the other four each parasitizing two clusters. Immediately
after parasitism the outer layer of eggs was separated from the rest of the cluster. Both
categories were then dissected to determine the fractions parasitized. The inner and outer
eggs were parasitized equally (outer eggs x̄ = 0.43 (±0.16 SD), inner eggs: x̄ = 0.48 (±0.22
SD)) (paired t-test: t8 = 1.1929, p = 0.2604), indicating that mounding does not protect the
inner host eggs from parasitism.
Species specific biological constraint: Host egg immunological defense

Insects can defend themselves against endoparasitoids by encapsulating or otherwise preventing development of parasitoid eggs or larvae (Lavine and Strand, 2002). For instance,
M. cinxia caterpillars encapsulate up to half the larvae of the parasitoid Cotesia melitaearum
(Hymenoptera: Braconidae) (van Nouhuys et al., 2012). If the majority of M. cinxia were
resistant to parasitism by H. horticola, then the low rate of successful parasitism would be
explained by host immunity. However, encapsulation of H. horticola would have to occur
early in host development (before the host hatches from the egg) which is both unlikely
and costly (Schmid-Hempel, 2005; Ardia et al., 2012). Furthermore, there is no evidence
of encapsulation. For instance, no dead parasitoid eggs were found in M. cinxia caterpillars dissected within hours of hatching, such as those used used in this study. These early
dissected caterpillars also did not have a higher incidence of parasitism (N = 64, x̄ = 0.30
(±0.13 SD)) than in previous studies in which the caterpillars were dissected later in development (34%) (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004), or upon adult emergence (36%) (van
Nouhuys and Punju, 2010).
Nonetheless, we approached this idea comparatively. Assuming resistance to para5

sitism is costly, hosts from places where the parasitoid occurs may have evolved resistance, whereas without the parasitoid there would be no or low resistance (Kraaijeveld
et al., 2002). In the laboratory we compared the rate of successful parasitism of M. cinxia
from Åland with those from Morocco, which lacks H. horticola. The only known parasitoid
of M. cinxia caterpillars in Morocco is C. melitaearum (van Nouhuys, Pers. Obs.), which
parasitizes older caterpillars (van Nouhuys and Punju, 2010). In this experiment 11 egg
clusters from butterflies from Åland and 15 from Morocco were parasitized in the laboratory, each by a different by H. horticola individual from Åland. For methods see Appendix
A. Eggs from both origins were parasitized at the same frequency (28% ± 17% SD, Welch’s
t-test t19.46 = −0.0047, p = 0.9963, Table 1), indicating no local resistance in Åland.
Species specific biological constraint: Ephemeral resource availability

Temporal asynchrony of the adult parasitoid with the susceptible stage of the host can
create a short opportunity for parasitism (Briggs and Latto, 1996). The window of time H.
horticola has to parasitize eggs within a host cluster depends on the length of time individual eggs are susceptible, and on the degree of synchrony of hatching within a cluster.
Melitaea cinxia eggs start out bright yellow. After 12 to 15 days the eggs change to a
creamy color, develop dark specks, turn grey, and then just before the caterpillar hatches,
the top of the egg becomes nearly black. Wasps do not probe clusters of bright yellow
eggs, and once the caterpillars start to hatch, the wasps are no longer attracted to the cluster (Castelo et al., 2010). In order to determine the association of developmental stage of
the host eggs with the rate of parasitism, we observed which visible phases of egg development were parasitized by the wasp. Thirty-four host egg clusters of different stages of
maturity (starting with all of the eggs creamy) were exposed to parasitism in the laboratory
(Appendix A). Each of eleven wasps was used several times (two to seven). Immediately
after parasitism, the eggs within each cluster were separated into four categories: creamy,
speckled, grey topped, and black topped. Upon hatching the caterpillars were dissected
to determine which were parasitized.
We analysed the association of parasitism with egg maturity category using logistic
regression in JMP (JMP, 2012). The explanatory variable was egg maturity (creamy, speckled, grey-topped, and black-topped). Egg cluster ID and wasp ID were included in the
model to account for intra-cluster or intra-individual correlation in responses. The number of replicates was too unbalanced to include observation number for each wasp in
the analysis. Previous experience is known to affect wasp behavior generally (Vet et al.,
1990), however it is unlikely to influence the outcome here because, in similar experiments using H. horticola, no change in rate of parasitism was detected after the first oviposition experience (Castelo et al., 2010). We found that parasitism differed among wasps
(χ210 = 68.1924, p < 0.0001) and among host egg clusters (χ28 = 55.3932, p < 0.0001) but
did not significantly differ between the four egg maturity classes (χ23 = 4.1523, p = 0.2455).

6

Summed over the egg clusters (each containing only some of the maturity classes), the rate
of parasitism was 0.15 creamy, 0.27 speckled, 0.27 grey topped, and 0.30 black topped.
To determine the amount of time a cluster contains susceptible eggs, we took hourly
photographs of ten egg clusters over the last one to five days of development, and calculated the amount of time that at least 95% of the eggs in the cluster were in one of the last
three visible stages of development (speckled, grey topped, black topped). The minimum
interval of susceptibility for these ten egg clusters was approximately 28 hours, and the
mean was x̄ = 64 (±38 SD). To demonstrate the pattern of development within an egg
cluster we video-taped an egg cluster over 80 hours, from when the first eggs became susceptible until hatching (Fig. 1). In this case, the susceptible period lasted at least 40 hours,
which is much greater than the 20 minutes to one hour spent at a cluster. Because a wasp
can probe approximately one egg per minute (computed in Appendix D), H. horticola is
not constrained by rate or synchrony of egg development in a cluster.
In sum, H. horticola has enough mature eggs in its ovaries and oviducts to parasitize
multiple whole clusters. All of the eggs in the cluster are physically accessible to the
ovipositor, and the eggs are susceptible to parasitism for much longer than a wasp attends to the cluster. Although some other physical or physiological factor could keep a
parasitoid from parasitizing more hosts, we have tested those that seem plausible.
Cooperative benefits of unparasitized hosts

Melitaea cinxia caterpillars live in gregarious family groups until their final instar (Kuussaari et al., 2004). The fitness of a cooperative group depends on the performance of each
individual. Thus, if parasitized caterpillars contribute less to the group than unparasitized
caterpillars, increasing the group rate of parasitism would decrease the performance of
parasitoids developing within the hosts. We determined the effect of rate of parasitism on
parasitoid performance by manipulating the fraction of caterpillars parasitized per nest
in a replicated laboratory experiment, measuring the rate of development, weight at diapause, size at pupation of the host and parasitoid, and production of silk by the hosts at
diapause. For methods, including the statistical models used, see Appendix B.
At the prediapause stage the rate of parasitism ranged among nests from 12% to 65%
(x̄ = 36%, ±15% SD) among the 30 caterpillar groups. Parasitized caterpillars developed
from second instar to diapause in x̄ = 29.28 days (±2.82 SD). The development time
differed among replicate groups, but was unrelated to the rate of parasitism in a group
(F1,24.72 = 0.0092, p = 0.9242). The pre-diapause development time of unparasitized
caterpillars was about the same and also did not differ with rate of parasitism of the group
(F1,24.72 = 0.0110, p = 0.9172). At diapause parasitized caterpillars weighed x̄ = 9.47 mg
(±5.93 SD), which did not vary with rate of parasitism (F1,36.88 = 1.9877, p = 0.1670).
Very few caterpillars died in this experiment so mortality was not analyzed. Upon molting to diapause the caterpillars produced silk to make a winter nest. Groups with a high

7

rate of parasitism produced the most silk (F4,34 = 8.9052, p < 0.0001). This effect was
due to the especially high production of silk by the most parasitized groups (post-hoc test
F1,34 = 32.51, p < 0.0001).
For the post-diapause caterpillars the rate of parasitism ranged from 5% to 61%
(x̄ = 32% (±13% SD)). There was nearly 30% mortality due to a viral infection that came
late in the experiment. The mortality of parasitized caterpillars due to the virus differed
among replicate groups (maximum likelihood χ236 = 70.6167, p = 0.0005), but was unrelated to rate of parasitism (χ21 = 0.00013, p = 0.9971). Parasitized caterpillars developed
from diapause to pupation in x̄ = 27.55 (±2.79 SD) days, which increased marginally with
rate of parasitism (F1,30.5 = 3.5813, p = 0.0680). There was no association of development
rate of unparasitized caterpillars with parasitism rate (F1,21.36 = 1.1915, p = 0.2872). Parasitoid pupae weighed x̄ = 48.96 mg (±12.08 SD), and did not vary with rate of parasitism.
Butterfly pupae weighed x̄ = 177.13 mg (±28.18 SD). In contrast to the parasitoid, butterfly pupal weight decreased with increasing parasitism rate (F1,26.94 = 5.5352, p = 0.0262).
Based on these experiments, we see no great benefit for H. horticola of being in a nest
with low parasitism. It is unlikely, but possible of course, that the one day (3%) increase
in development rate between the lowest and highest rate of parasitism could have a large
negative effect over a one year lifecycle. The positive association of parasitism with silk
production warrants further study, because silk is positively associated with winter nest
quality which is important for overwintering success of the host (Kuussaari et al., 2004),
and hence the wasp. Because of the experiment design we could measure the effects of
abnormally low, but not extremely high parasitism. Thus, our treatments safely span the
normal range (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004), but do not address the possible negative
effects of very high parasitism (greater than twice the normal rate).
Optimal foraging

Optimal foraging models are used to predict how an animal should partition limited time
between procuring resources and using them (Charnov and Skinner, 1984, 1985). Hyposoter
horticola has a limited time to forage for host egg clusters distributed in a landscape and
parasitize them, so an optimal foraging model seems appropriate. At a host egg cluster
H. horticola probes host eggs unsystematically, making haphazard passes across the cluster (Montovan, Pers. Obs.). Because only one H. horticola larva can develop within each
caterpillar, foraging efficiency diminishes over time as the wasp increasingly encounters
previously parasitized hosts (Fig. 2). The wasp is predicted to ultimately leave. Other
within-patch density dependent factors, such as host mortality due to superparasitism
and hyperparasitism, would further decrease the marginal benefit from continuing to parasitize a host cluster.

8

Observed superparasitism rates. For solitary parasitoid species, superparasitism results

in mortality of parasitoids, and sometimes hosts. Some species are able to avoid superparasitism while others are not (Godfray et al., 1994). To determine the potential cost of
superparasitism, we assessed its frequency. Host egg clusters were exposed to parasitism
naturally in the field (N=5) and in the laboratory (N=25), and the caterpillars were dissected upon hatching to count the number of parasitoid eggs. These dissections showed
that although only one wasp reaches maturity within a given host (van Nouhuys and
Punju, 2010), superparasitism occasionally occurs (Fig. 3). We used these data to estimate
the probability of superparasitism (Appendix C), and found that when a wasp encounters
a previously parasitized egg it successfully avoids parasitizing that egg again 77% of the
time (dotted line in Fig. 3). The strong avoidance of superparasitism suggests that it is
costly, either due to risk associated with superparasitism or (if it had not been excluded as
a possibility), egg limitation.
Optimal foraging modeling. The expected number of host eggs in a cluster parasitized

singly, or multiple times, is
Np ≈ N (1 − e−bt/N ),

(1)

where N is the total number of hosts in a cluster, b is the probing rate (taken from laboratory data, Appendix D), and t is the time spent probing the cluster.
The parasitism frequency function (Eqn. 1) predicts the number of parasitoid offspring
in a cluster. It assumes that each probe by the wasp is independent and random (Appendix
C), only one wasp parasitizes each cluster (Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript a),
and if an egg is superparasitized, exactly one wasp larva will survive (Eqn. 1). We were
not able to experimentally determine whether one offspring survives or all offspring die in
superparasitized hosts, so we also used a model in which superparasitism kills both wasps
so the number of parasitoid offspring is the expected number of host eggs parasitized
exactly once:
N1 ≈

N e−bt/N btz/N
(e
− 1),
z

(2)

where z is the probability of avoiding multiparasitism, calculated in Appendix C. The
average fitness is then defined as the parasitism rate (similar to the net energy intake functions in Charnov (1976)), which is the number of eggs parasitized in each cluster (Np or
N1 ) divided by the time the wasp spends ’searching for’ (ts ) and parasitizing (t) a cluster.
The search time ts , in its simplest form, is the time it takes a wasp to reach the next available host egg cluster. Natural selection acts upon t, the time spent probing each cluster.
The fitness functions (generically w(t)) representing parasitism efficiency without mortality of multiply parasitized eggs (w1 (t)), and assuming complete mortality of multiply

To maximize the fitness (w(t)) with respect to time spent parasitizing, t, we differentiate
w(t) and solved for t when

d2 w(t)

< 0, finding the optimal value of t

numerically and then using this value in the expressions for Np or N1 .
Figure 4 shows the resulting optimal fraction parasitized for both parasitism functions.
Over realistic ranges of egg cluster size (N) (Fig. 4A), and probing rate (b) (Fig. 4B), the
optimal fraction parasitized is fairly insensitive to changes in the number of eggs or probing rate. Because the expected time it takes a wasp to reach another host egg cluster (ts )
is unknown, we tested the model over a large range of searching times. For intermediate
values of ts (0.25 < ts < 1 hr) and realistic values of N and b, both models predict an optimal fraction parasitized close to the observed 30% (Fig. 4C). Including mortality due to
superparasitism (bold black dashed line) lowers the optimal parasitism rates and creates a
larger range of search times, ts , for which we would expect to see the wasp parasitize close
to 30% of hosts. Thus, optimal foraging with diminishing returns due to random probing
(with or without superparasitism as entirely lethal), can explain the observed parasitism
frequencies if the wasp’s searching time is intermediate (about a half hour). A search time
of a few minutes leads to a very low rate of parasitism of less than 30%. Long search time
(> 2 hrs) (Fig. 4D) leads to a parasitism rate above 60%.
Avoiding hyperparasitism.

Parasitoids might also behave so as to reduce the risk of

mortality of their offspring, imposed by natural enemies (Ayal and Green, 1993). The hyperparasitoid Mesochorus stigmaticus (Hymenoptera: Ichnuemonidae) parasitizes H. horticola larvae within M. cinxia caterpillars. Multiple M. stigmaticus females visit a caterpillar
nest over several weeks during the summer, spending from minutes to hours there (Reichgelt, 2007). Most host egg clusters are hyperparasitized, at a rate of up to 50%. We
empirically determined the association of rate of hyperparasitism with rate of parasitism
by H. horticola, and included this in the optimal foraging model. We also compared parasitism frequencies of H. horticola from populations with M. stigmaticus (Åland) and without
(Estonia), to see if the H. horticola from Åland have evolved low parasitism frequency in
the presence of the hyperparasitoid.
We measured the hyperparasitism frequency over a range of parasitism frequencies
using two data sets. The first was 16 field-collected naturally parasitized and hyperparasitized nests. To extend the range of parasitism rate and standardize for nest size and
location, we also constructed nests of 60 M. cinxia caterpillars, as in the experiment on
cooperative benefits (Appendix B). We left nests containing naturally parasitized caterpil-

10

lars undiluted (N= 12), diluted 1:1 (N= 10), and diluted 2:1 (N=11), this resulted in 10% to
60% parasitism. We then placed the randomized nests in ten different habitat patches to
be naturally hyperparasitized by M. stigmaticus. After three weeks in July when M. stigmaticus was active, we retrieved the nests reared the caterpillars. The following spring we
recorded the numbers that produced adult butterflies, H. horticola or M. stigmaticus.
We used logistic regression to estimate the relationship between the fraction of the
cluster that was parasitized by H. horticola and the probability that those parasitoid larvae
were hyperparasitized. The dependent variable measured whether each parasitized host
egg was also hyperparasitized by M. stigmaticus, where p = Np /N is the fraction of parasitized host caterpillars (Fig. 5A). The independent variable was the fraction of the cluster
that was parasitized by H. horticola. The intercept was estimated as −1.86 (SE = 0.27,
p < 0.001), and the coefficient associated with the parasitism frequency was 2.7 (SE = 0.5,
p < 0.001). Combining these estimates, the probability that a parasitized egg was hyperparasitized is thus fit as
h(p) = 1/(1 + e1.86−2.7p ).

Under this pressure of hyperparasitism, the expected number of parasitoid offspring
per cluster Nps is:
Nps = N · p(1 − h(p)).
Nps /N is shown in Fig. 5B. This leads to a new version of the optimal foraging model with
the following fitness function (using Eqn. 1):

The same numerical methods described for the basic optimal foraging model were
used to determine the optimum parasitism frequencies (dashed grey lines in Fig. 4). The
predicted optimal fraction parasitized is similar to that in which all parasitoid larvae in
superparasitized hosts all die (black dashed lines in Fig. 4).
As a second approach to the potential effects of hyperparasitism on rate of parasitism,
we compared H. horticola from Åland with those from Estonia (250 km by sea from Åland),
which is free of hyperparasitism (van Nouhuys, Pers. Obs.). If H. horticola has evolved to
parasitize at a low frequency to avoid a density dependent hyperparasitism in Åland, then
we might expect individuals from Estonia not to exhibit such restraint, and to parasitize a
larger fraction of the hosts in a cluster.
In a fully crossed experiment H. horticola from Åland and Estonia were offered M. cinxia
eggs from Åland and Estonia (Appendix A). We compared the frequency of parasitism
using a generalized linear model in R (R Development Core Team, 2011). Parasitism rate
was modeled as a function of egg cluster origin (Åland, Estonia), wasp origin (Åland,

11

Estonia) and the interaction between wasp and egg origin. See table 1 for the number of
replicates, and results for each treatment. On average, 36% of the eggs in a cluster were
parasitized. There was no significant difference between wasp (t1,47 = 0.891, p = 0.377)
or egg (t1,47 = 1.763, p = 0.085) origins, and no interaction between them (t3,45 = 1.093,
p = 0.280). Thus, in spite of evidence from the optimal foraging model that the wasp is
predicted to decrease rate of parasitism to avoid hyperparasitism, this experiment does
not support the hypothesis that H. horticola from Åland have evolved restraint because of
pressure from the hyperparasitoid.

Discussion
Hyposoter horticola forages in a competitive environment in which virtually all host egg
clusters are found, and many are monitored by multiple females until they become susceptible to parasitism. Yet only about a third of each host egg cluster is parasitized, each
primarily by one female. Here we examined explanations for why the wasp does not further exploit its host, using experiments, comparative studies and mathematical modeling.
Simple biological and physiological constraints

Host egg cluster architecture, synchrony or asynchrony in the development rate of host
eggs within a cluster, or the early immune response of the host do not appear to limit the
wasp. An individual female also contains more eggs than needed to parasitize a single
host egg cluster, and because it does not parasitize many egg clusters in its life and can
probably make new eggs as they are used, a wasp, on average, is unlikely to be egg limited
over a lifetime. Because H. horticola has specialized biology and an extremely narrow
host range it is unsurprising that the wasp is not limited in these ways. We would only
expect simple biological limitations to be effective constraints if, instead, the parasitoid
were poorly adapted to the host.
Behavioral restraint: Prudent parasitism, risk spreading, cooperative benefits

When individuals are physically and physiologically able to further exploit a resource, but
do not, they are exhibiting behavioral restraint. We rejected prudence and risk-aversion as
explanations because in Åland H. horticola has a large population that is well-mixed across
the landscape (Kankare et al., 2005). We also found that wasps do not benefit from developing in host nests with low parasitism: although M. cinxia caterpillars live gregariously
and rely on cooperative behavior to survive, the fraction parasitized did not significantly
affect the pre-diapause or post-diapause developmental rates, weight or survival of the
wasps. The lack of a measurable fitness-cost of parasitism is unsurprising because a parasitoid larva stays extremely small (1st instar) throughout most of the development of the

12

host caterpillar, and then grows rapidly, consuming the entire host, just before it would
have pupated (van Nouhuys and Punju, 2010).
Behavioral restraints: Optimal foraging

Unlike the previous scenarios, optimal foraging shows promise as an explanation for partial resource use by H. horticola. In the most basic model, efficiency at a host egg cluster decreases solely because the wasp probes randomly, and only one larva can develop within
each host. As the wasp spends more time at the cluster it finds fewer and fewer unparasitized eggs and thus benefits from leaving the cluster to find another (Fig. 2). Such a
model has been used to predict the very low rate of parasitism by Anagrus delicatus, a tiny
parasitoid of leaf hoppers (Rosenheim and Mangel, 1994), which is unable to distinguish
between parasitized and unparasitized host eggs (Cronin and Strong, 1993a). Although
H. horticola can avoid superparasitism with 77% accuracy, it still experiences diminished
returns as the rate of parasitism increases. If superparasitized hosts die, then there are
eventually even negative returns as parasitism increases. The key general principle is
that extreme under-exploitation of resources can occur when exploitation progressively
reduces the value of the remaining resources in the patch (Charnov, 1976).
Any other factors that add cost with increased parasitism, or time at a cluster, effect
predictions of the optimal foraging model. We hypothesized that the time at a cluster
would be reduced due to density dependent hyperparasitism (Ayal and Green, 1993). This
is a compelling multitrophic behavioral explanation (Sullivan and Völkl, 1999) which does
indeed reduce the optimal rate of parasitism. In our models, both risk of superparasitism
and hyperparasitism similarly reduced optimal rate of parasitism with respect to search
time, egg cluster size (N) and probing rate (b) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in spite of this cost
there is no evidence that wasps from Åland have evolved a lower parasitism rate than
wasps from Estonia, where there are no hyperparasitoids.
The optimal foraging model is sensitive to the search time between clusters, ts , and
predicts that the rate of parasitism is about 30% when ts is about a half hour. On the one
hand we know that H. horticola successfully parasitizes only a few clusters in a few weeks
(Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript b), so the ts = 30 minutes is too short. On the
other hand, the wasp knows the locations of the clusters ahead of time, and most travel
times are only seconds to minutes (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004; van Nouhuys and
Kaartinen, 2008), so ts = 30 minutes is too long. In order for the optimal foraging (time
budget) model to be applicable to this research system we have to interpret ts differently,
taking into account activities associated with the strong intraspecific competition among
foraging females (van Nouhuys and Ehrnsten, 2004; Hardy et al., 2013; Couchoux and van
Nouhuys, 2014). For H. horticola, a successful individual is one who is a strong competitor,
devoting a large fraction of its time to monitoring and attending host egg clusters that are
not yet ready to be parasitized. Any time the the wasp spends parasitizing is time not

13

spent competing, thus reducing future gain. Under this scenario ts represents time that
must be invested to protect, on average, one future egg cluster.
Behavioral restraint: The role of deterrent marking

After H. horticola has finished parasitizing, it applies a chemical mark on the leaves around
the cluster (Couchoux et al., unpublished manuscript a). Other parasitoid species are
known to mark individual hosts or clusters and modify their search behavior in response
their own marking or the marks of conspecifics (Höller and Hörmann, 1993; Bernstein
and Driessen, 1996). None of the simple biological explanations for consistently low parasitism could provided explanations for deterrent marking by H. horticola. Nor could prudence, bet-hedging, or cooperative benefits. The optimal foraging model does. If a wasp
leaves when additional parasitism would reduce its expected fitness (due to risk of selfsuperparasitism or hyperparasitism) it may benefit by leaving a mark to assist itself in
avoiding further parasitizing the same cluster (Mangel, 1989; Varaldi et al., 2005). A second wasp that approaches the same cluster would also maximize its fitness by leaving to
search for an unused cluster. This makes it intuitive that a wasp might both mark and respect a deterrent mark left by another wasp (Roitberg and Mangel, 1988; Hoffmeister and
Roitberg, 1997). As an aside, just as it is adaptive for some solitary parasitoids to engage in
superparasitism (van Alphen and Visser, 1990; Speirs et al., 1991), surely some individuals
would benefit from further parasitizing a previously used cluster. We might then expect
that the effectiveness of the deterrent mark decreases with increasing competition for host
egg clusters.

Conclusion
Any time an individual exercises extreme restraint in the use of an apparently available
yet limiting resource, we wonder why. This paper illustrates that, while there are multiple
potential explanations for the evolution and maintenance of low exploitation of available
resources, many turn out to be implausible. None of the simple physical or physiological mechanisms examined explain the pattern. Two well known behavioral mechanisms,
prudence and bet-hedging, are also not relevant because the wasp population is large and
well mixed. We also found no indication that individuals benefit from being in a sparsely
parasitized cooperatively feeding host group. The surviving candidate explanation is that
H. horticola practices partial parasitism and deterrent marking as a way to forage optimally
for hosts and avoid superparasitism, with the avoidance of density dependent hyperparasitism as a further incentive for restraint. The plausibility of the optimal foraging hypothesis depends on a ts of about a half hour, which in this system should be considered not
as search time, but as the time not spent parasitizing or competing for hosts. In this study
we found, as has been found in many circumstances by others, that individual selection
is a stronger force than bet-hedging or prudence through group selection, and should be
14

carefully disentangled when thinking about the evolutionary causes of any surprisingly
low resource use.

A

General Experimental procedures

Unless noted otherwise, the hosts used in experiments came from a laboratory population
of M. cinxia maintained in Finland, as described in Couchoux and van Nouhuys (2014).
Hyposoter horticola were obtained by placing unparasitized hosts in natural populations in
Åland to be parasitized. After parasitism they were brought back into the laboratory and
reared under the same conditions as the unparasitized hosts.
Upon adults emergence, female H. horticola were maintained in the laboratory and fed
honey water (3:1). The adult butterflies were also fed honey water (3:1) and placed in cages
(3 females + 8 non-sibling males) for one day to mate. After mating, two female butterflies
were put in a cage with a host plant (Veronica spicata) to lay eggs. When an egg cluster
was laid, the plant with the egg cluster was stored until the eggs were close to susceptible
to parasitism. Depending on the experiment, they were then exposed to parasitism in the
laboratory or placed in a habitat patch in the field to be parasitized by H. horticola.
For the comparison of rate of parasitism in populations from Åland vs. Morocco (with
and without a history of parasitism, respectively) and Åland vs. Estonia (with and without a history of hyperparasitism, respectively), host caterpillars were collected from each
locality. Nine nests were collected from both the Moroccan highlands and Åland in the
autumn 2011 and kept in diapause under laboratory conditions until spring 2012. In the
spring of 2012, we collected 11 post-diapause M. cinxia nests from Paldiski, Estonia. We
then reared all the caterpillars in the laboratory until they pupated. This produced adult
M. cinxia from Åland, Morocco and Estonia, and adult H. horticola from Åland and Estonia.
To obtain host egg clusters from all three origins, M. cinxia butterflies from each region
were then allowed to mate and oviposit in the laboratory, as explained above. Each female
was mated to a non-sibling male from its own origin. For each trial of the experiment,
a female wasp was put in a 40 by 40 by 50 cm cage containing a plant (V. spicata) with a
susceptible egg cluster on it. The host plant species V. spicata is common to all three collection sites. In order to reduce variation of behavior, each individual was given parasitism
experience before being used in an experiment. A different wasp was used for each observation, and we observed each parasitism from when the wasp started to probe the egg
cluster until it flew off the plant. This lasted from 10 to 90 minutes. For details see Couchoux and van Nouhuys (2014). Afterward we moved the egg cluster to a Petri dish and
waited one to three days for the host eggs to hatch. Host caterpillars were then dissected to
25

determine the parasitism rate in each egg cluster. In total 64 egg clusters were parasitized.
See table 1 for a summary of number of replicates for each treatment and results.

Measuring the fitness cost of living in a highly parasitized host
nest

Parasitized and unparasitized caterpillars from Åland were obtained as described in Appendix A. To assess the effects of rate of parasitism on the performance of H. horticola
in pre-diapause caterpillars (instars one to five), we put newly hatched caterpillars in 40
composite replicated groups of 40 caterpillars. We made a well-distributed range of parasitism frequencies by mixing caterpillars from field parasitized clusters with caterpillars
from the same laboratory origin that had not been exposed to parasitism. We made aggregate groups of unparasitized caterpillars left undiluted, those mixed 1:1 with caterpillars
from nests exposed to parasitism, or entirely from caterpillars from field parasitized nests.
We could not create nests parasitized at extremely high rates (> 0.60). Young parasitized
and unparasitized M. cinxia caterpillars are indistinguishable from the outside so we did
not know the actual fraction parasitized within each constructed nest until the end of
the experiment. Caterpillars developed in these groups under laboratory conditions, and
built their silken winter nests. To assess the quantity of winter silk, we sorted the groups
of caterpillars (blind to the level of parasitism) into five groups based on the amount of
silk produced. Then we weighed the caterpillars and dissected them to determine which
individuals were parasitized.
To assess the effects of parasitism rate on parasitoid performance in post-diapause
caterpillars we used a second set of 37 laboratory-reared and field-parasitized composite
groups. We obtained the caterpillars as described above, and reared them until diapause
in their original family groups. After breaking diapause, we mixed families of caterpillars
to avoid differences between families, and then put them composite groups as described
above. We then measured days until pupation, and the butterfly and wasp pupal weights.
Some caterpillars died in the last instar due to a viral infection. We dissected these to
determine whether they were parasitized or not.
We analyzed the association of pre-diapause and post-diapause growth rates, weight at
diapause and weight at pupation for hosts and parasitoids separately using standard least
squares ANOVA with a REML approach (JMP, 2012). The explanatory variable was rate of
parasitism of the group, and group ID was included as a random effect. We analyzed the
association of mortality with rate of parasitism using logistic regression with individual
survival (0/1) modeled as a function of rate of parasitism of the group and group ID.
Finally, the association of rate of parasitism with amount of silk produced was analyzed
using ANOVA with silk production (level one to five) as an explanatory class variable and
group ID as a random effect.

Modeling how reliably wasps avoid superparasitism

We assume that at each probe the wasp randomly chooses a host egg from all the eggs in
the cluster, and it probes in each cluster many times. Because about 30% of each roughly
200 egg host cluster is parasitized the wasp must probe, on average, more than 60 eggs
per cluster. We use the Poisson probability distribution, assuming the number of probes is
sufficiently large, to estimate the number of probes a host egg will receive. The probability
that the number of times (n) a particular host is probed k times is
P (n = k) =

λk −λ
e ,
k!

(7)

where λ is the mean number of probes per host, or the total number of times the wasp
probes the cluster divided by the number of eggs in the cluster, λ = Nprobe /N = bt/N ,
where t is the time the wasp spends at the cluster and b is the number of eggs probed per
minute.
No avoidance of superparasitism.

If every probe by the wasp results in an egg being

laid, then the expected numbers of unparasitized hosts Nnp and singly parasitized hosts
Ns can be calculated using equation 7:
E[Nnp ] = N · P (n = 0) = N e−bt/N

(8)

E[Ns ] = N · P (n = 1) = bte−bt/N .

(9)

These expected values can be used to compute the expected number of parasitized Np =
N − E[Nnp ], and superparasitized Nsup = E[Np ] − E[Ns ] hosts.
The resulting parasitism as a function of time is shown in Fig. 2. At given time t the
plot shows the numbers of probes Nprobe , parasitized hosts Np , singly parasitized hosts
Ns , singly probed hosts N1 and superparasitized hosts Nsup . As time goes on the expected
number Nnp of unparasitized hosts tends to zero and Np → N . The number N1 of singly
probed hosts increases with time, then decreases towards zero with a maximum of N1 =
N/e ≈ 0.37(N ) which occurs when Nprobe = N at t = N/b.
Avoidance of superparasitism. We continue to assume that the wasp lays eggs in any
unparasitized host. But now we assume that superparasitism can be avoided by the detection of a previously deposited parasitoid egg while probing. The expected fraction of
the cluster that remains unparasitized is p0 = E[Nnp ]/N . If the wasp detects prior parasitism with probability z and does not lay an egg when prior parasitism is detected, then

27

the probability that a host egg is parasitized only once is
p1 = P (n = 1) + zP (n = 2) + z 2 P (n = 3) + . . .

The probability that an egg is multiply parasitized (superparasitized) is pm = 1 − p0 − p1 .
Using data (Fig. 3) we estimate the probability of avoiding multiparasitism (z), by maximizing the multinomial log-likelihood for the model (p0 (λ), p1 (λ, z), pm (λ, z)) given observations on the counts of unparasitized (p0 ), singly parasitized (p1 ), and multiply parasitized hosts (pm ) in each cluster. The data were fit using the mle function from the Stats4
package in the statistical package R (R Development Core Team, 2011). We find that z is
significantly different from zero (p < 0.0001). The estimate is z = 0.767, with SE = 0.036,
that is, we estimate that the wasps detect previous parasitism approximately 77% of the
time (dotted line in Fig. 3).

D

Probing efficiency b

We assume that an individual wasp, at an egg cluster of N hosts, probes hosts at a constant
rate of b probes per unit time. After time t the total number of probes is Nprobe = bt.
At each probe we assume that the probability that a given host will be probed is 1/N ,
independently of whether it was probed before or not. Once probed, we assume a given
host egg is parasitized. If, while probing, the wasp detects previous parasitism, it may or
may not withhold from superparasitizing, as discussed in Appendix C.
Because we cannot clearly identify a probing event visually (cannot distinguish it from
general exploration with the ovipositor), we estimate the probing rate b from the duration
of time t spent at a host cluster and the number of hosts parasitized (counted by dissection)
Np . With random probing the probability of a host having been probed is 1−p0 = 1−e−λ =
1 − e−Nprobe /N (using Eqn. 7 in Appendix C).
Experiment. We observed H. horticola from Åland probing and ovipositing into 36 host
egg clusters in the laboratory. These were the same egg clusters used to determine which
developmental stages of the eggs are parasitized. The total time spent probing the eggs (t)
was recorded for each cluster. After all N caterpillars in a cluster hatched we dissected and
counted the number parasitized Np . We performed logistic regression using a GLM with a
binomial error function and logit link function in the statistical package R (R Development
Core Team, 2011). We fit the data to the model for Np (Appendix C) and estimate b = 0.96
eggs per minute (p < 0.001), with 95% CI of 0.81 < b < 1.12.
