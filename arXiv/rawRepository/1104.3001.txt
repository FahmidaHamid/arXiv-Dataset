Abstract
We propose a hybrid dynamical system approach to model the evolution of a pathogen that experiences different selective pressures according to
a stochastic process. In every environment, the evolution of the pathogen
is described by a version of the Fisher-Haldane-Wright equation while the
switching between environments follows a Markov jump process. We investigate how the qualitative behavior of a simple single-host deterministic system
changes when the stochastic switching process is added. In particular, we
study the stability in probability of monomorphic equilibria. We prove that
in a “constantly” fluctuating environment, the genotype with the highest
mean fitness is asymptotically stable in probability while all others are unstable in probability. However, if the probability of host switching depends
on the genotype composition of the population, polymorphism can be stably
maintained.

1. Introduction
Living organisms face changing environmental conditions. Parasites are
a case in point: after each transmission event they find themselves in a new
host that may be quite different from the previous one. For example, the
immune system of the new host may respond differently to the parasite, and
the new host may have a different genotype or even belong to a different
species. Thus, a parasite genotype that is characterized by a high fitness in
one host may have a low fitness in a different host. The question therefore
arises how parasites evolve under the fluctuating selective pressures imposed
on them through transmission events to different hosts.
Most of the studies so far have focused on models for host-pathogen interactions in a deterministic context [11, 12]. In some applications however it
is natural to assume that environment (and hence fitness landscape) switching is not deterministic. For example, a pathogen could switch to a different
host. Evolution of the pathogen then takes place in the new host (or environment), where the pathogen genotypes face different selective pressures, hence
the dynamics of the pathogen genotypes are different. We remark that the
evolving organism need not be a pathogen, nor is the environment necessarily
a “host”.
Evolution of organisms in deterministically and randomly varying environments has been studied by many authors, see [2] for an early review.
Karlin and collaborators [5, 6] introduced both deterministic and stochastic
models for the evolution of haploid and diploid organisms under changing
selection intensities for fixed and varying population sizes. In case of a deterministic two-allele model they showed that the genotype with higher selection
intensity goes to fixation and the time to fixation varies according to the selection intensities. Furthermore, they investigated a stochastic model where
generational selection intensities are identically distributed independent random variables. They focused on the question how the probabilities of fixation
and the times to fixation change in the stochastic model. In [7], Kirzhner et
al. considered a 4-dimensional system of difference equations for the haplo2

type frequencies of a two-locus model. Typical two-locus models show either
fixation in one or both loci or stable polymorphic cycles, with period equaling the period of the environmental changes, i.e. the periodic fitness values.
They however showed the existence of so called supercycles that have 1100
times the period of the periodically changing environment. The questions
of structural stability, i.e. sensitivity in terms of the fitness parameters and
the size of the basin of attraction of these cycles were investigated. Similarly, Nagylaki [10] investigated the existence of genetic polymorphisms for
two-allele models with periodically varying fitness values. He showed that in
a continuous differential equation model genetic polymorphism will persist
with periods equaling the periods of the varying fitness values, however in a
discrete model fixation is also possible.
Hybrid switching differential equations and more generally hybrid switching diffusions have found many applications in wireless communications,
queuing networks, ecology [15] and financial mathematics, to name but a few;
see [14] and the references therein. The word “hybrid” refers to the coexistence of continuous dynamics and discrete events, see also the related concept
of piecewise deterministic processes [1]. In this paper we study a simplified
version of the continuous time Fisher-Haldane-Wright equation (also known
as standard replicator equation, [3]) subject to fitnesses driven by a Markov
jump process. It is well known that in the deterministic Fisher-HaldaneWright model the pathogen genotype that has the highest fitness value will
go to fixation. The coupling of different Fisher-Haldane-Wright equations by
a Markov process however requires a new definition of the concept of “highest
fitness”. Hence we study the possible changes to the stability behaviors of the
monomorphic equilibrium states depending on the stationary distribution of
the switching Markov process. First we establish analytical results for the
stability/instability of equilibria in the hybrid model. We show that in the
case of a state-independent switching process, the monomorphic equilibrium
of the genotype with highest mean fitness is asymptotically stable in probability while the monomorphic equilibria of all other genotypes are unstable in
probability. As the stationary distribution of the switching Markov process
varies, so does the mean fitness of each genotype. This results in exchanges
of stability without the merger of the equilibria during the transition process.
We may call this a “stochastic transcritical bifurcation”. Finally, we present
some numerical simulations to illustrate our result and also an example of a
state-dependent switching process.

2. The switching differential equation
We consider a model for m genotypes of a pathogen evolving in n possible environments. Let wik > 0 denote the fitness value of genotype i in
environment k. We assume for simplicity that for any fixed environment k,
the fitness values wik are all different. We write wi for the vector of all fitness
values of genotype i. Let Pi denote the frequency of pathogen i, so that the
dynamics in each environment takes place in the (m−1)-dimensional simplex

Tm−1 = P ∈ Rm
Pi = 1 .

We write P (t) = (P1 (t), P2 (t), . . . , Pm (t)) for the state of the system at time
t. The frequency dynamics of pathogen genotype i in environment k is given

This equation is the Fisher-Haldane-Wright equation for frequencies of genotypes of asexually proliferating organisms. The rate of growth or decay of a
genotype is determined by the difference of its fitness and the average fitness
of the population. Observe that the simplex Tm−1 and any of its subsimplices
are invariant under the dynamics given by equation (2.1). It can be shown
by straightforward computation that the average fitness in environment k

with equality if and only if P is an equilibrium. It follows from the global
existence of solutions and LaSalle’s theorem that every trajectory of (2.1)
approaches one of the finitely many equilibria situated at the vertices of the
simplex, see [8].
The environment switches according to a continuous time stochastic process α(t) that takes values in the set M = {1, 2, . . . , n}. The switching process α is a Markov process with (possibly state-dependent) generator matrix
Q(P ) whose entries qkl (P ) are defined by
P{α(t+∆t) = l | α(t) = k, (P (s), α(s)), s ≤ t} = qkl (P (t))∆t+o(∆t). (2.3)
The
X elements qkl of the generator matrix Q satisfy qkl ≥ 0 for all k 6= l and
qkl = 0 for every k ∈ M (such a matrix is said to have the q-property,
l∈M

see [13]). The complete hybrid switching ordinary differential equation can
be cast in the form
dP
= F (P (t), α(t)),
dt
P (0) = p ∈ Tm−1 , α(0) = α ∈ M,

(2.4)
a. s.,

where α(t) = k determines the environment k at time t and F = (F1 , . . . , Fm )
are defined by (2.1). The right hand side of the differential equation in
(2.4) is globally Lipschitz continuous on the compact set Tm−1 × M. This
implies global existence and uniqueness of solutions in the sense of stochastic
processes, see [14, Theorem 2.1].
For the equation (2.1) restricted to a fixed environment k, the vertices
ei of the simplex Tm−1 (i.e. the unit vectors of Rm ) are all the equilibrium
solutions. It is easy to show that all but one of these equilibria are unstable
and that the stable equilibrium in environment k is the one for which the
fitness value wik is the largest. In the following section we investigate how
this result generalizes to the case that stochastic switching is introduced. For
this of course, we need to first generalize the concept of stability to switching
ordinary differential equations.
3. Stability and instability in probability
In this section we establish results concerning the stability and instability of monomorphic steady states of the hybrid model. We first recall the
following definition [14, Definition 8.1].
5

Definition 3.1. Let (X x,α (t))t≥0 be the solution of a hybrid switching ordinary differential equation
Ẋ(t) = F (X(t), α(t)),
P{α(t + ∆t) = l | α(t) = k, (X(s), α(s)), s ≤ t} = qkl (X(t))∆t + o(∆t),
X(0) = x, α(0) = α a. s.,
and let (without loss of generality) x = 0 be an equilibrium solution, i.e. a
solution of the equation F (0, α) = 0 for every α ∈ M. We say that 0 is
stable in probability if


x,α
lim P sup |X (t)| > r = 0
x→0

t≥0

for every α ∈ M and every r > 0. We say that 0 is asymptotically stable
in probability if it is stable in probability and
n
o
lim P lim X x,α (t) = 0 = 1
x→0

t→∞

for every α ∈ M. Finally, 0 is unstable in probability if it is not stable
in probability.
For n-tuples of functions g( · , k) ∈ C 1 (Rm ) one defines a linear operator
L, the stochastic Lie derivative (see [14, Equation (8.3), p. 219])
Lg(x, k) = F (x, k) · ∇g(x, k) +

n
X

qkl (x)g(x, k),

l=1

where ∇ denotes the gradient with respect to the x-variable for fixed k ∈ M.
This is a natural generalization of the derivative of a scalar function along a
vector field well known in the theory of ordinary differential equations. The
following is Proposition 8.6, [14, p. 223].
Theorem 3.2. Let D ⊂ Rm be a neighborhood of 0 and assume that there
exists a function V : D × M → [0, ∞) with the following properties
• V ( · , k) is continuous and vanishes only at 0,
• V ( · , k) is continuously differentiable in D \ {0}, and
6

• there exists a function κ : (0, r) → (0, ∞) such that for all k ∈ M and
|x| > %,
LV (x, k) ≤ −κ(%) < 0.
Then the equilibrium x = 0 is asymptotically stable in probability.
A function that satisfies the conditions of the theorem is called a Lyapunov
function (for asymptotic stability).
Throughout the remainder of this section we consider the case of a stateindependent generator matrix Q with a universal stationary distribution π =
(q1 , . . . , qn ). This is the solution of the equations
π · 1 = 1,

and πQ = 0.

If qkl > 0 for all k 6= l then the matrix Q is irreducible and π > 0 is unique
[13, p. 21].
Theorem 3.3. Let P1 be the genotype with the highest mean fitness, that is
π · w1 > π · wi

for all i = 2, . . . , m

(3.5)

Then the equilibrium e1 is asymptotically stable in probability.
Remark 3.4 For almost every stationary distribution π ∈ Tn−1 , exactly
one genotype satisfies a condition similar to (3.5).
Proof. For i = 2, . . . , m we set aki,1 = wik − w1k for the difference of fitness values with respect to genotype 1 and ai,1 = (a1i,1 , . . . , ani,1 ). Using the
m
X
constraint
Pj (t) = 1, we eliminate P1 and obtain the reduced systems

for i = 2, . . . , m and k = 1, . . . , n. Notice that for fixed environment k the
linear part of this system has a diagonal structure. We define
βi := −π · ai,1 > 0,

7

with the last inequality holding true since genotype 1 has the higher mean
fitness compared to every other genotype. For i = 2, . . . , m we solve the
systems of equations
Qci = ai,1 + βi 1
for the vector ci = (c1i , . . . , cni ) where 1 is the column vector with n entries
1. The right hand sides of these equation are orthogonal to the kernel of Q
which is spanned by 1, hence there exist solutions. For i = 2, . . . , m and
k = 1, . . . , n, we define
Vi (Pi , k) = (1 − γcki )Piγ ,

Pi > 0,

with 0 < γ < 1 yet to be selected, in such a way that all coefficients are
positive. We have

where we have made use of the fact that the row sums of Q are zero. In order
to make all the factors in parentheses negative, we have to choose 0 < γ < 1
such that the inequality
π · ai,1 < γcki aki
(3.7)
holds. By assumption (3.5), the left hand side of inequality (3.7) is negative.
Therefore, for those indices i and k for which cki aki,1 ≥ 0, no condition arises
for γ. If on the other hand cki aki,1 < 0, then we can select

and the condition of Proposition 8.6 in [14] follows from the linearity of the
operator L and the choice of γ.

Instability in probability of an equilibrium can be proved similarly. The
following is Proposition 8.7, [14, p. 223]. Notice however that the Lyapunov
function does not vanish but has a pole at the unstable equilibrium.
Theorem 3.5. Let D ⊂ Rm be a neighborhood of 0 and assume that there
exists a function V : D × M → [0, ∞) with the following properties
• V ( · , k) is continuously differentiable in D \ {0}, and
• there exists a function κ : (0, r) → (0, ∞) such that for all k ∈ M and
|x| > %,
LV (x, k) ≤ −κ(%) < 0,
• for all k ∈ M,
lim V (x, k) = ∞.

|x|→0

Then the equilibrium x = 0 is unstable in probability.
Theorem 3.6. Under the assumption (3.5) of Theorem 3.3, the equilibrium
ei , i = 2, . . . , m is unstable in probability.
Proof. The proof is very similar to that of Theorem 3.3, so we only give
a sketch here. This time it is Pi that is being eliminated from the system
containing P1 and Pi . This results in the reduced systems

We set
V (P1 , . . . , Pi−1 , Pi+1 , . . . , Pm , k) = V (P1 , k) = (1 − γcki )P1γ ,

P1 > 0,

where 0 > γ > −1 has yet to be selected, small enough that all coefficients

The expressions whose maximum is taken are all negative since π · a1,i > 0 by
assumption (3.5). The condition of Proposition 8.7 in [14] is thereby verified.

Remark 3.7 The notion of “highest mean fitness” requires that the generator matrix Q is independent of the state and so has a universal stationary
distribution π. If Q depends continuously on P , it is still possible to formulate the corresponding “local” stability results for the equilibria ei by taking
π to be a stationary distribution of Q(ei ).
4. Numerical simulations and examples
The following is an interesting example of how stability can arise through
stochastic coupling. Let the fitness values of three genotypes in two environments be given by

w11 = 1, w21 = , w31 = ,
10
10

11 2

2
w1 = 1, w2 = , w3 = .
10
10
Although genotype 1 does not have the highest fitness in any environment,
it has the highest mean fitness for stationary distributions (q, 1 − q) with
10

< q < 34 , see Figure 1. If the generator matrix Q of the Markov process does
not depend explicitly on the state P (t), we can determine the switching times
a priori according to ti+1 = ti + τ , where τ is an exponentially distributed
random variable with mean 1 (for example).

To finish this section, we present two example with a state-dependent
generator matrix Q(P ). Let n = m = 2,
w11 = w22 = 1, w21 = w12 =

This choice of the generator matrix means that the jump process favors jumps
into the environment that is beneficial (in case Q1 ), respectively disadvantageous (in case Q2 ) for the genotype that currently dominates. In contrast
to the previous simulations with state-independent generator matrix, it is
now necessary to update the transition matrix of the Markov chain, namely
11

exp(Q(P )∆t) during each time step of length ∆t. Following [14, Chapter
5.3], we use the approximation I + Q(P )∆t. The stationary distribution of
Q1 (ei ) is, incidentally, ei for i = 1, 2. It follows from Theorem 3.3 and Remark 3.7 that both equilibria are locally asymptotically stable in probability.
Conversely, the stationary distribution of Q2 (e1 ) is e2 and vice versa. Under
this regime, both equilibria are locally unstable in probability. The results
in Figure 2 show that stochastic bistability may arise (for the choice Q1 (P ),
left panel) or that solutions do not converge to a monomorphic steady state
(for the choice Q2 (P ), right panel).

whereas matrix Q2 (P ) results in failure to converge to an equilibrium (right panel). Parts

parts of the trajectory in blue indicate that environment 2 is active (when e2 is attracting).

In terms of biological interpretation, one can conceive of competing pathogen
genotypes that cause different behaviors in the affected host. For example, if
the dominating pathogen genotype has only mild effects on their host’s wellbeing, infected individuals may retain their usual mobility and thereby make
a transition into a new environment more likely. On the other hand, if the
dominating pathogen genotype causes severe morbidity, the host may exhibit
restricted mobility so that a transition into a new environment becomes less
likely.

5. Conclusions
In this work we consider the dynamics of a simple host-pathogen system,
where pathogen genotype frequencies evolve according to a simple deterministic model. The selective pressures switch according to a Markov process.
We use the framework of switching differential equations to compare the evolution of the pathogen in a single deterministic versus a hybrid system. In
the switching system interesting new stability patterns emerge, depending
on the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov process. We assume
a fixed number of environments (and corresponding fitnesses), in contrast to
previous works. For example, Karlin and collaborators [5, 6] assumed that
the fitnesses during each generation are independent identically distributed
random variables. Gillespie on the other hand in [4] proposed a stochastic
differential equation where the fitness is a process with continuous sample
paths.
In the case of a state-independent generator matrix of the Markov process Q, we have a partition of the simplex Tn−1 of all possible stationary
distributions π into regions where one genotype has a greater mean fitness
than all others, except for a set of measure zero where two genotypes have
equal mean fitness (where bifurcations occur). This complete classification
relies on the diagonal structure of the Jacobian of the reduced system (??)
at the equilibrium 0. Due to this decoupling, it is possible to use a sum
of Lyapunov functions that all depend on one variable only. In this way,
we obtain a condition for asymptotic stability using convex combinations of
corresponding elements of the spectra of the Jacobians in the different environments. We expect such a result to hold in the greater context of switching
ordinary differential equations and diffusion processes with regime switching.
Our work can be refined and extended in various ways. Firstly, we use a
very simple deterministic competition model (2.1), where the pathogen genotypes are ordered according to their fitness values and the only equilibria are
the vertices of the simplex Tm−1 . A straightforward extension would be
to consider the continuous time Fisher-Haldane-Wright equation for diploid
organisms for which there exist equilibria in the interior of Tm−1 . Other
competition models may lead to deterministic bistability or to periodic orbits (for example the rock-paper-scissors game [3]). Secondly, although the
host switching process is stochastic, we model within-host evolution in a deterministic way. A more realistic approach would incorporate random genetic
drift into the model. This may be particularly important during transmis13

sion events, which often involve population bottlenecks due to small inoculum
sizes. Finally, our model only considers a single chain of transmission events
and neglects between-host selection as well as superinfections. It may be
possible to also consider multiple (branching and coalescing) transmission
chains and thus fully couple within-host and epidemiological dynamics [9].
