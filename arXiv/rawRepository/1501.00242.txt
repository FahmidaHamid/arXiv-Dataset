Abstract—New imaging techniques are in great demand for
investigating underground plant roots systems which play an
important role in crop production. Compared with other nondestructive imaging modalities, PET can image plant roots in
natural soil and produce dynamic 3D functional images which
reveal the temporal dynamics of plant-environment interactions.
In this study, we combined PET with optical projection tomography (OPT) to evaluate its potential for plant root phenotyping.
We used a dedicated high resolution plant PET imager that has
a 14 cm diameter transaxial and 10 cm axial field of views, and
multi-bed imaging capability. The image resolution is around
1.25 mm using ML-EM reconstruction algorithm. B73 inbred
maize seeds were germinated and then grown in a sealed jar
with transparent gel-based media. PET scanning started on the
day when the first green leaf appeared, and was carried out
once a day for 5 days. Each morning, around 10 mCi of 11 CO2
was administrated into a custom built plant labeling chamber.
After 10 minutes, residual activity was flushed out with fresh air
before a 2-h PET scan started. For the OPT imaging, the jar
was placed inside an acrylic cubic container filled with water,
illuminated with a uniform surface light source, and imaged by
a DSLR camera from 72 angles to acquire optical images for
OPT reconstruction. The same plant was imaged 3 times a day
by the OPT system (morning, noon and evening). Plant roots
growth is measured from the optical images. Co-registered PET
and optical images indicate that most of the hot spots appeared
in later time points of the PET images correspond to the most
actively growing root tips. The strong linear correlation between
11
C allocation at root tips measured by PET and eventual root
growth measured by OPT suggests that we can use PET as a
phenotyping tool to measure how a plant makes subterranean
carbon allocation decisions in different environmental scenarios.

the solution to this worldwide challenge. While modern
sequencing technologies offer unprecedented information
about genotype, the phenotypic outcomes of plant x
environment interactions are hardly predictable. To close
this knowledge gap, plant phenotyping is an increasingly
important area of research. Many imaging based technologies
have been adapted to measure multiple parameters of
a plant under various conditions with high-throughput.
For example, the Scanalyzer (LemnaTec GmbH) benchtop system can image hundreds of arabidopsis grown in
well plates each day, while a custom imaging system at the
Danforth Center (Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility,
http://www.danforthcenter.org/scientists-research/core-technologies/phenot
can image a thousand plants in the growth chamber a day by
automated conveyor system and imaging stations.
While imaging of leaves and structures above ground have
been made easier by these technologies, studying of belowground roots remain a challenge. Some groups use transparent media such as gel to grow plants to visualize root
structure. Most of the current root imaging systems are lightbased[1][2] and can only provide morphological information
of the subjects. Thus, imaging methods that reveal physiological information non-invasively with good temporal resolution
are of great value to enrich the tool sets for future plant
pheontyping[3].
PET is a functional and molecular imaging technique that
provides in vivo measurement of dynamic radio-tracer distribution in a whole plant non-invasively. These dynamic PET
images reveals the temporal physiological process happening
inside plant. With plants grown in a transparent gel media,
the anatomical change of plant root can be precisely captured
by a low-cost optical imaging system[4]. The study presented
here explores the potential applications of this combined multimodality imaging system on plant root phenotyping.
II. M ATERIALS AND

METHODS

A. Plant PET imaging system
The dedicated plant PET system[5] as shown in Figure 1
is designed with two unique features: (1) configurable system
geometry to accommodate plants of different sizes and shapes;
(2) the ability to control the environment in which the plants
will be grown and studied.
This plant PET system also provides ∼1.25 mm spatial
resolution, which is especially important for imaging of small
young plants with complex roots structure. The system sensitivity at center of field of view (FOV) is 1.3%. The imager has

15 cm trans-axial and 10 cm axial FOV. With the automatic
radio-active gas delivery system, the same subjects can be
imaged repeatedly without disturbance which is important for
plant studies that are very sensitive to environmental change.
B. Optical projection tomography system
Figure 2 shows the setup of the optical projection tomography (OPT) system in our plant imaging lab. A maize plant is
germinated and grown inside a glass cylindrical jar filled with
transparent gel. During an optical imaging experiment, this jar
is seat inside a rectangle water tank to compensate refraction
induced distortion in optical images. A small rotation stage
controls the rotation angle of the glass jar through magnetic
coupling. A DSLR camera captures projection images from
different angles with a laptop PC synchronizing object rotation. With the captured projection images (usually from 72
angles with 5 degree step size), a 3D root image can be
reconstructed with some specific reconstruction codes like
Rootwork[6] or RootReader3D[7]. Some traits analysis can
be conducted in 3D, like root system volume, surface area,
total root length, number of branches, etc.
C. Imaging protocol
Figure 3 shows a young maize plant with structural image
acquired from the OPT system and functional image acquired
from the plant PET system with 11 CO2 labeling. Those two
modalities of root images exhibit the similar root structure,
but also indicates some difference, such as the hot spots representing photosynthetic carbon molecules (mainly sucrose)
that appear around the root tips in PET image at a later
time point (around 111 minutes). Intuitively, these hot spots

should be correlated with the most actively growing roots,
since the plant must allocate carbon resources to these root
tips. With the optical images, the actual root growth rate can
be measured. A series of studies with a total of 3 subjects have
been carried out consecutively with the same imaging protocol
to figure out the correlation of root growth rate and activity
concentration around root tips. PET scanning started on the
day when the first green leaf appeared, and was carried out
once a day for 5 days. Each morning, around 10 mCi of 11 CO2
was administrated into a custom built plant labeling chamber.
After 6 minutes labeling, residual activity was flushed out with
fresh air before a 2∼3 hours PET scan. The same plant was
imaged 3 times a day by the OPT system (morning, afternoon
and evening with 8 hours apart).

D. Image processing
The OPT images are reconstructed using photos from
72 angles. PET images are reconstructed with an ML-EM
algorithm[8]. The PET and OPT images are aligned using
the AMIDE open source software[9]. Figure 4 shows the
reconstructed 3D OPT and PET images and the co-registered
images which are well aligned. Small fine root structures
shown in optical image can not be clearly seen in PET image,
which partly attributes to the relatively low spatial resolution
and partial volume effect in PET imaging[10] and is also likely
related to biological fact that less carbon is allocated. Some
root tips growing close to the wall of glass jar are absent in
the optical image, but can be clearly seen in PET images. This
relates to the refraction induced distortion in optical images
that can not be fully compensated with the rectangular water
tank.
The main roots of each subject are selected from optical
images and these images are also used to guide the region of
interest (ROI) contouring with PET images. The 3D coordinates of the main roots are tracked with different time points
and growth rate (mm/day) of the selected roots are calculated
based on these time series data points. PET images are first
decay corrected and the activity concentration is measured
with the ROIs each has a size of 6.4 mm x 6.4 mm x 6.4
mm (8 x 8 x 8 pixels in image).

III. R ESULTS
A. Dynamic 3D PET images
Each PET image is created with data from 3 different bed
positions to cover the entire plant (providing ∼28 cm axial
FOV). Time presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6 are referenced
to the beginning of the 11 CO2 injection time. The duration of
the first 6 image frames is 12 minutes, which is divided into
0.5 minute for the first bed position to cover the shot part
of a plant, 5 minutes for the other two positions to image
the stem and root parts and 0.5 minutes for completing the
needed mechanical motion. The duration of the last 4 frames is
increased to 22 minutes (1 minute, 10 minutes, 10 minutes for
the 3 bed positions respectively and 1 minute for mechanical
motion) to collect enough events for reconstructing clear PET
images. The total duration including the labeling and PET
scan reaches 2.5 hours to make sure enough activity is already
translocated to the root tips.
Figure 5 shows the 3D dynamic PET images of Subject 1
acquired on Day 8. Translocation of the 11 C to the root part
starts around 30 minutes post-labeling and activity distribution
reaches a relatively stable status after two hours. In the last
frame of PET images, clear root structure is shown and hot
spots appear around the main roots tips. These 5-day PET
studies for the 3 subjects show similar dynamic change of
11
CO2 translocation pattern. For these young maize plants,

carbon starts to transfer to the root part only after reaching
some plant development stage and hot spots appear after that.
Figure 6 shows the last frame of PET images for Subject 1
of all the 5 days and the actual root growth can be clearly
observed for PET images directly.

B. Correlation of activity concentration and roots growth rate
As shown in Figure 6, the root growth rate is measured
with 8 selected ROIs of Subject 1 from optical images of Day
7 and Day 8 and the corresponding activity concentration is
measured with PET data of Day 7. A good linear correlation
is shown in Figure 7 between activity concentration and root
growth rate in this 24 hour window. These data clearly suggest
that the activity accumulated at root tips represents carbon
allocation by the plant that drives root growth.
As mentioned above, with these high spatial resolution PET
images, the clear root structure appears at later time point of
image frames. The 3D coordinates of roots tips can also be
measured from the PET images and the roots growth rate can
be calculated accordingly. Figure 7 also shows the the similar
linear correlation between activity concentration around roots
tips and roots growth rate measured from PET data directly.
The result indicates that these kind of studies can be carried
out with regular soil using PET only, which may provide
more precise data for modeling the relation between carbon
allocation and actual root growth.

6 selected main roots measured from Day 6 to Day 8.

C. Environmental stress induced root growth rate change
Many of the subjects show the similar linear correlation
between activity concentration and roots growth rate while
some data sets show different and changing relations. Figure 8
shows the change of correlation between activity concentration
at root tips and root growth rate with Subject 3 during the
study. The PET data is from Day 6 to Day 8 and optical
data is from Day 6 to Day 9. Good correlation still exists
between activity concentration at root tips and roots growth
rate on Day 6. But on Day 7, the growth rate for root 5
and 6 decreased a lot and a tremendous growth rate decline
happened on the following day for those two roots. The answer
to this change can track back to the corresponding optical
images. Figure 9 shows the growth tracks of root 5 and 6 from
different projection planes with time stamp marked. The root
5 encountered the wall of the glass jar, and started to change
its growth direction and this kind of change happened even a
bit earlier for root 6 with the optical image viewed from X-Y
plane. These results suggest that the root apical meristem may
need to consume more carbon to change its growth direction.
This new observation demonstrates the potential of combined imaging technique in measuring the up/down modulation
of molecular processes in plants study when environmental
stress arise.
D. Temporal information released with PET image predicates
the root growth ahead
PET provides near real-time in situ measurement of molecular processes in plants that often precede visible morphological
change. This is also observed by our preliminary studies
with maize plant. Figure 10 shows that signatures of carbon
allocation can predict lateral root outgrowth around 48 hours
prior to the micro-morphological change.

of lateral root emergence 48 hours prior to morphological change can be

IV. D ISCUSSION

AND

C ONCLUSION

PET provides in vivo measurement of dynamic radiotracer
distribution in a whole plant non-invasively. Combined PET
and optical imaging study of maize roots shows correlation
between the activity concentration in the root tips and root
growth rate over days. PET also aid in revealing the answer
for some plant physiological puzzles by providing 3D dynamic
and functional information of a whole plant.
More applications will be explored by collaborating with
plant biologists, combining more imaging modalities, like xray CT and hyper-spectral imaging[11][12].
