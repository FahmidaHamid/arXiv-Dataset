Many single molecule experiments for molecular motors comprise not only the motor but also
large probe particles coupled to it. The theoretical analysis of these assays, however, often takes
into account only the degrees of freedom representing the motor. We present a coarse-graining
method that maps a model comprising two coupled degrees of freedom which represent motor and
probe particle to such an effective one-particle model by eliminating the dynamics of the probe
particle in a thermodynamically and dynamically consistent way. The coarse-grained rates obey
a local detailed balance condition and reproduce the net currents. Moreover, the average entropy
production as well as the thermodynamic efficiency is invariant under this coarse-graining procedure.
Our analysis reveals that only by assuming unrealistically fast probe particles, the coarse-grained
transition rates coincide with the transition rates of the traditionally used one-particle motor models.
Additionally, we find that for multicyclic motors the stall force can depend on the probe size. We
apply this coarse-graining method to specific case studies of the F1 -ATPase and the kinesin motor.

INTRODUCTION

In many single molecule experiments beads that are attached to molecular motors are used to infer properties
of the motor protein from the analysis of the trajectory
of these probe particles. In particular, external forces
can be exerted on the motor via such a probe particle
[1, 2]. In the theoretical analysis of such assays, the motor is usually modelled as a particle hopping on a discrete
state space with transitions governed by a master equation [3–8]. Alternatively, the so called ratchet models
combine continuous diffusive spatial motion with stochastic switching between different potentials corresponding
to different chemical states [9, 10]. These approaches often comprise only one particle explicitly, representing the
motor. The contribution of external forces which in the
experiments act on the motor only via the probe are then
included in the transition rates [5, 6, 11–17] (or Langevin
equation for the spatial coordinate [18, 19]) of the motor
particle directly. However, theoretical models that are
used to reproduce the experimental observations should
comprise at least two (coupled) degrees of freedom, one
for the motor and one for the probe particle. Such models
consisting of one degree of freedom hopping on a discrete
state space representing the motor coupled to a continuously moving degree of freedom representing the probe
are discussed in [20–27]. While multi-particle models are
more precise and better represent the actual experimental setup, one-particle models are widely-used toy models
often applied to illustrate basic ideas.
Simplifying the description of systems consisting of
many degrees of freedom with a concomitant large state
space while still maintaining important properties is commonly known as coarse-graining. In the context of
stochastic thermodynamics [28], various coarse-graining
methods have been applied, e.g., lumping together states
of a discrete state space among which transitions are fast
[29–32], averaging over states for discrete [33] or continuous processes [32, 34], eliminating single states from a

network description [35–37] or eliminating slow (invisible) degrees of freedom [38–40]. It was found that, in
general, coarse-graining has implications on the entropy
production and, in particular [41], dissipation. In the
context of biological systems and especially molecular
motors, coarse-graining procedures mostly focus on eliminating selected states of the motor [37, 42] or on reducing continuous (ratchet) models to discrete-state models
[43–47].

In the present paper, we introduce a coarse-graining
procedure that allows to reduce molecular motor-bead
models to effective one-particle models with discrete motor states with the external force acting directly on the
effective motor particle. We eliminate the explicit dynamics of the probe particle completely still maintaining
the correct local detailed balance condition for the effective motor transition rates and preserving the average
currents of the system. As a main result, we find that the
coarse-grained rates show a more complex force dependence than the usually assumed exponential behaviour
and a more complex concentration dependence than mass
action law kinetics.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we
introduce our coarse-graining method on the basis of a
simple motor-bead model with only one motor state and
apply it to a model for the F1 -ATPase [26]. In section III,
we generalize the procedure to motor models with several
internal states and apply it to both a refined model for
the F1 -ATPase and to a kinesin model. A possible experimental implementation of our method is presented in section IV. We show that entropy production and efficiency
remain invariant under this coarse-graining procedure in
section V, discuss implications on the stall conditions in
section VI and conclude in section VII.

GENERAL ONE-STATE MOTOR MODEL
A.

Explicit motor-bead dynamics

The general model for motor proteins with only one
chemical state consists of one degree of freedom representing the motor which jumps between discrete states
n(t) separated by a distance d. The motor is coupled
with the second degree of freedom representing the probe
particle via some kind of elastic linker, see Fig. 1 [26].
The motion of the probe particle with continuous coordinate x(t) is described by an overdamped Langevin
equation with friction coefficient γ and constant external
force fex ,
ẋ(t) = (−∂x V (n − x) − fex ) /γ + ζ(t),

(1)

including the potential energy of the linker V (n − x)
and thermal noise ζ(t) with correlations hζ(t2 )ζ(t1 )i =
2δ(t2 − t1 )/γ. Throughout the paper, we set kB T = 1.
This choice implies that the product of force fex and
distance d appearing in the figures below is measured
in units of kB T . The (instantaneous) distance between
motor and probe is denoted by y. The system is characterized by the pair of variables (n,x) and is “bipartite” in
these variables since transitions do not happen in both
variables at the same time. The transition rates of the
motor fulfill a local detailed balance (LDB) condition

particle hopping between states separated by d. We
thus have to eliminate the x-coordinate from the (n,x)description resulting in a system characterized only by
n.
For the coarse-grained model, we impose the following
conditions. The coarse-grained transition rates Ω± which
advance the effective particle by d should obey a LDB

as the force is now assumed to act directly on the effective
motor particle. Furthermore, we require that the coarsegrained particle moves with the same average velocity
in the steady state as the motor and the probe in the
original model, i.e.,
v = d(Ω+ − Ω− ).

transition rates of the motor are denoted by w+ (n, x) and
w− (n, x). The load sharing factors θ+ and θ− indicate the
position of an underlying unresolved potential barrier relative
to the minimum of the free energy landscape of the motor.

Coarse-graining procedure

In the coarse-grained description of the model we want
to map the motor-bead system to one effective motor

Solving the linear system of equations (5, 6) yields the
coarse-grained rates

The coarse-grained rates can be interpreted as effective
transition rates that correspond to a transition process
after which both particles, motor and probe, have advanced a distance ±d. In principle, there are (for any y)
many possible displacement processes to advance both
particles by d, including ones with l forward and l − 1
backward motor jumps. The coarse-grained rate corresponds to the rate with which one such effective displacement will happen.
In general, the coarse-grained rates depend (via v) on
all model parameters, including the friction coefficient of

3
the probe particle and the specific potential of the linker.
If one had chosen coarse-grained rates by just averaging
over the positions of the probe particle, i.e., by

one would have obtained rates that yield the correct average velocity but do not fulfill the LDB condition, as
discussed in section II E below.
For a more explicit analysis, we must specify the forward and backward rates of the motor. We choose [26]
w+ (y) = w0 exp[µ+ − V (y + dθ+ ) + V (y)]
−

w (y) = w0 exp[µ − V (y − dθ ) + V (y)]

(10)
(11)

where θ+ and θ− are the load-sharing factors with
θ+ + θ− = 1 and µ+ = µT , µ− = µD + µP . We assume
an exponential dependence of the transition rates on the
potential difference of the linker according to Kramers’
theory. This exponential dependence on the potential difference is similar to one-particle models where the rates
of the motor typically depend exponentially on the external force with a corresponding load-sharing factor [3, 5].
C.

Time-scale separation

In this section, we will investigate under which conditions the coarse-grained rates (7, 8) can be expressed using a single exponential dependence on the external force
as typically assumed for mechanical transitions within
one-particle models [3, 5].
Inserting eqs. (10, 11) in eq. (3) in the NESS shows
that the contribution due to motor jumps is weighted
with a (dimensionless) prefactor
2
ε ≡ w0 exp[µeq
T ]d γ.

(12)

Here, w0 exp[µeq
T ] determines the timescale of the transitions of the motor while γd2 determines the timescale of
the dynamics of the probe particle. The latter is mainly
governed by the size of the bead and the step size of the
motor whereas w0 exp[µeq
T ] is determined by the attempt
frequency and also by the absolute nucleotide concentrations.
If the dynamics of the bead is much faster than the
transitions of the motor, time-scale separation holds with
ε → 0 [31, 48]. In this limit of fast bead relaxation,
denoted throughout by a caret, the stationary solution
of eq. (3) in the NESS becomes
p̂s (y) = exp[−V (y) + fex y]/N

(13)

with N ≡ −∞ exp[−V (y) + fex y] dy. The average velocity is then given by

independent of any specific linker potential V (y). Since
this force dependence is purely exponential with the correct load sharing factor, these expressions represent exactly the rates typically used in one-particle models. We
notice that within this approximation Ω+ = hw+ (y)i and
Ω− = hw− (y)i holds true, which is in agreement with
other coarse-graining procedures in the time-scale separation limit, e.g., [31–33].
Note that only transition rates of the motor whose dependence on the linker potential is chosen accordingly in
the Kramers form (eqs. (10, 11)) lead generically to consistent coarse-grained and averaged rates when using the
fast-bead limit of ps (y).
D.

Example: F1 -ATPase

In general, a strong time-scale separation between motor and probe is not necessarily realistic. In this case, eq.
(3) must be solved numerically. We will use the model
introduced in [26], see Fig. 1, with a harmonic potential V (y) = κy 2 /2 as a simple example to illustrate our
coarse-graining procedure.
In Fig. 2, the results for Ω+ and Ω− are shown for various values of the friction coefficient γ. With decreasing γ,
the rates approach their corresponding fast-bead limits,
Ω̂+ and Ω̂− . These values are upper bounds because decreasing γ implies smaller probe particles which exert less
drag on the motor. For finite γ, the coarse-grained rates
do not show a single exponential dependence on fex over
the whole range of external forces. Such a dependence,
however, is usually assumed to hold within one-particle
models. Moreover, the coarse-grained rates depend on γ,
which is a parameter not incorporated explicitly in many
one-particle models.
The experimentally accessible values of γ cover a wide
range of the values chosen in Fig. 2. A dimer of
polystyrene beads (≃ 280 nm) as used in [49–52] corresponds to γ = 0.5 s/d2 (red (dark gray) line with
squares) while a 40 nm-gold particle [52–54] corresponds
to γ = 5 · 10−4 s/d2 (yellow (light gray) line with triangles). Especially for large external forces, the coarsegrained rates deviate strongly from their asymptotic values even for a probe as small as the gold particle.
The average velocity as shown in Fig. 2 also strongly
depends on the friction coefficient of the probe particle,
especially for large external forces. In this regime, for
large γ, the velocity is dominated by the friction experienced by the probe while for small γ the probe relaxes
almost immediately and the velocity is dominated by the
timescale of the motor jumps.
Another option to reach the fast-bead limit is to use
very small nucleotide concentrations. In Fig. 3, we show

the coarse-grained rates for various ATP and ADP concentrations. With decreasing nucleotide concentration
(at fixed ∆µ), the rates approach the asymptotic Ω̂+ and
Ω̂− . However, it is very hard to do experiments at concentrations smaller than ≃ 10−7 M as jumps of the motor
are then very rare.
In Fig. 2 and in Fig. 3 the dependence of the coarsegrained rates on the external force exhibits two different
regimes. Up to values of the external force of roughly
15/d, the coarse-grained rates can be well approximated
by a single exponential dependence on fex with the same
slope as in the fast-bead limit, dθ+ or dθ− , respectively.
However, for large γ and large cT , even in this regime, the
absolute values of the coarse-grained rates deviate up to
two orders of magnitude from their fast-bead approximation. For such parameters, assuming a mono-exponential
dependence on fex with the above slope would not be
appropriate either.
For large external forces, all coarse-grained rates deviate significantly from their fast-bead limits. We find
again a mono-exponential decay for Ω+ but now with
slope −d whereas Ω− grows only linearly with increasing
fex . This so far unaccounted for behaviour can be understood by considering the limit fex → ∞ as discussed in
detail in the Appendix. The crossover from one regime
to the other occurs beyond the stall force fex = ∆µ/d.

In summary, we find that for the F1 -ATPase under
realistic experimental conditions the rates in a coarsegrained description comprising only one effective particle
that satisfy the LDB condition eq. (5) and reproduce the
correct average velocity v can not be written in the form
of a single exponential dependence on the external force.

E.

Comparison of coarse-grained with averaged
rates

Instead of defining the coarse-grained rates according
to eqs. (7, 8), one might be tempted to use the averaged
rates (9) as a definition for the coarse-grained rates. In
Fig. 4, we show the averaged rates of our F1 -ATPase
model as well as their ratio corresponding to the LDB
condition. We find that both hw+ i and hw− i (for the latter less visible in the plot) exhibit non-monotonic dependence on the external force. For external forces slightly
larger than the stall force, hw+ i increases with increasing fex due to the fact that in this region the system
moves backward with motor jumps following the probe
which leads to a peak at small y in ps (y). On the other
hand, hw− i exhibits a minimum around stall conditions
for large γ since in this region, ps (y) misses a peak at
large y ≃ 1.
A severe issue appears regarding the LDB condition.
The corresponding ratio of the averaged rates is also plotted in Fig. 4 where it can be clearly seen that the LDB
condition is not fulfilled (except in the fast-bead limit).

F.

Without external force

Even though we have motivated this paper by emphasizing that external forces are typically applied to probe
particles, it should be obvious that our approach holds
true for molecular motors transporting cargo subject to
Stokes friction in the absence of external forces.

(solid black lines). Bottom: Ratio of + and − rates. In contrast to Ω+ , Ω− (large red dots), the averaged motor rates do

For one-particle models, the friction coefficient of the
probe can not be taken into account explicitly. One
rather has to incorporate the drag effect of the bead into
the motor rates [46]. If one wants to analyze experimental data obtained from probe particles of different sizes,
one then has to use different values of the motor rates for
each data set.
For the rather dilute solutions used in experiments
[49, 51, 55] one generally assumes that the motor dynamics is subject to mass action law kinetics, i.e., that
the transition rates depend linearly on the corresponding concentration of nucleotides. Obviously, this linear
dependence holds for all concentrations and beads of all
sizes for one-particle models. When keeping cD and cP
fixed, the average velocity of a one-state motor will show
a purely linear dependence on cT .
The experimental analysis of the average velocity of the
F1 -ATPase as function of cT (for fixed cD , cP ) reveals a
saturation of the velocity for large ATP concentrations
which sets in earlier for large beads [53]. While such a
saturation is usually attributed to the hydrolysis step, we
find that a sub-linear dependence of the velocity can also
be caused by the drag of the probe particle.
In Fig. 5, the coarse-grained rates as well as the velocity are shown as a function of the ATP concentration.
With decreasing γ, the coarse-grained rates approach the
fast-bead limit and the mass action law kinetics. The ve-

locity is then linear in cT as in a one-particle model. For
large γ, eliminating the cargo by coarse-graining yields
coarse-grained rates that are not linear in the concentrations although the motor rates are still subject to mass
action law kinetics. Moreover, the velocity then exhibits
a sub-linear dependence reminiscent of the typical saturation effect for large cT .

G.

Comparison of full and coarse-grained
trajectories

Trajectories of motor and probe generated by a simulation of the complete model of the F1 -ATPase are shown
in Fig. 6. Additionaly, Fig. 6 contains a trajectory obtained from simulating the corresponding coarse-grained
model. The average velocity of both models is the same
(by definition, see eq. (6)), whereas the coarse-grained
model produces trajectories that are “more random”.
This behavior occurs since the coarse-grained rates are
constant (for fixed parameters) and produce a simple biased random walk. The motor transition rates of the
complete model, however, depend on the actual position
of the probe and are therefore implicitly time-dependent.
Since fast successive motor jumps are suppressed, the trajectory of the complete model is less random [21, 56].

The influence of parameters like the probe size or the
ATP concentration on the dynamics is visible in the bottom panels of Fig. 6. While the average velocity is almost
the same, the trajectories of the complete model differ
significantly. Using a small probe with a small friction
coefficient, the probe relaxes to the potential minimum
of the linker before the next motor jump occurs, whereas
the large probe cannot relax [25]. Large ATP concentrations induce many forward and succesive backward motor jumps that are absent at lower ATP concentrations.
These details are not captured in the coarse-grained trajectories.

MOTOR MODELS WITH SEVERAL
INTERNAL STATES
Explicit motor-bead dynamics and
coarse-graining procedure

In this section, we will generalize the model taking into
account several different internal states of the motor labelled by i. The motor states represent the nodes and the

state space of the probe particle (left). Each row of black dots
represents one motor state while the dots themselves represent
specific distances y accessible to the probe particle (via the

between motor states either leave y the same (horizontal green
lines) or can advance the motor by dα

coarse-grained version of this model (right).

transitions the edges of a network. Transitions between
the motor states i and j change the free energy by

(17)

where Fj − Fi is the free energy difference of the interα
nal states of the motor and ∆µα
ij = −∆µji is the free
energy change of the solvent. Depending on the transition, ∆µα
ij is given by µT , µD , µP or any combination
thereof or 0. Transitions may also advance the motor
α
a distance dα
ij = −dji . Since we allow for several transitions connecting two states, we assign an additional index
α to the transitions indicating which link between i and
j is used. An example for the network of a full system
comprising motor and probe particle is shown in Fig. 7,
where the state space of the probe is discretized for better
presentation.
The Fokker-Planck-type equation for such models is
given by

The coarse-grained version of such a model should take
into account the different states of the motor as well as

7
the several possible α-transitions between i and j. Thus,
the motor network (including all motor cycles) should be
conserved under coarse-graining. To account for the several internal states, we require that the coarse-grained
rates should obey a LDB condition and the operational
current [57] from motor state i to motor state j via edge

sum over all y-dependent net transition currents that
contribute to the transition i → j. Conserving the operational currents corresponds to the condition of reproducing the correct mean velocity for the one-state model.

Time-scale separation

Similar to the one-state-model, we explore the consequences of a putative time-scale separation between the
dynamics of motor and probe for each motor transition.
In the limit γ → 0 (formally equivalent to ε → 0 but
here one would have several εij within the Fokker-Planck
equation and all go to 0) the solution of eq. (18) in the
NESS becomes, analogously to [29, 32],
p̂si (y) = P̂i exp[−V (y) + fex y]/N .

The 120 step of the F1 -ATPase is known to consist of
a 90◦ and a 30◦ substep [53]. Such a stepping behavior
can be modelled with a unicyclic motor with two internal
states. A schematic representation of a system comprising a probe particle and a motor with two internal states
is shown in Fig. 8. The two different pathways for transitions between the states 1 and 2 correspond to the 90◦
and 30◦ substeps of the F1 -ATPase, respectively.
Like in section II D for the one-state model, we examine
the coarse-grained rates for the 90◦ and 30◦ steps and the
velocity which are shown in Fig. 9. Similar to the 120◦ scenario, the rates approach their fast-bead limit with
decreasing γ.
As in the one-step model, the dependence of the coarsegrained rates on the external force shows two regimes.
For small external forces, the rates can be well approximated by a single exponential dependence on fex with
α,±
slope ±dα
in most cases. For large probe partiij θij
cles, however, the rates neither match the absolute value
nor show mono-exponential dependence on fex with the
above slope. For large forces, the forward rates decay

faster whereas the backward rates grow more slowly than
in the fast-bead limit.
Concerning the average velocity, strong deviations
from the fast-bead limit occur only for the largest friction coefficients. Using small beads, the force-velocity
relation resulting from our coarse-graining procedure coincides well with the one obtained from a one-particle
model due to the fact that the velocity involves only differences of the rates multiplied with the marginal distribution rather than the rates themselves. For large
external forces and small γ, the velocity is significantly
smaller than in the one-state model since the motor has
to take two successive steps to cover the full d. The
force-velocity relations for the two-state as well as for

9
the one-state model reproduce very well the exerimentally determined force-velocity relation from [51] for the
corresponding value of the friction coefficient γ.
The limiting cases fex → ±∞ are more involved here
than in the one-state model since one has to account
for the dependence of the Pi ’s on the external force.
However, as long as the Pj ’s do not decay faster than
exp[−fex dα

For the F1 -ATPase model, the numerical analysis in

2.

Without external force

Just as for the one-state-model, we examine the dependence of the coarse-grained rates on the ATP concentration in the absence of external forces.
Fig. 10 shows the coarse-grained rates for the 90◦ and
the 30◦ substeps as well as the avergage velocity. With
decreasing γ, the coarse-grained rates approach the mass
action law kinetics for the corresponding one-particle
rates. In contrast to the one-state model, even in this
limit, the velocity shows saturation. This is due to the
fact that the timescale of the hydrolysis reaction is independent of the ATP concentration and represents the
limiting effect for the velocity. The dependence of the average velocity on the ATP concentration is reminiscent
of a Michaelis-Menten kinetics and coincides well with
experimenal results for several different probe particles
as shown in [53].
For large beads, the coarse-graining process yields
rates that are no longer linear in the corresponding concentrations. In this regime, the sub-linear dependence of
the velocity on the ATP concentration appears already
for smaller ATP concentrations. Comparing the velocity
curves of the two-state model with the one-state model,
we find that for large beads the velocity curves almost
coincide since in this regime the limiting effect for the
velocity is the friction experienced by the bead. Thus,
using large probe particles it is not possible to infer the
underlying motor dynamics from the characteristics of
the velocity as a function of the ATP concentration [25].
Fig. 11 shows the coarse-grained forward rates for
three different nucleotide concentrations and for various
γ chosen as in the experiment [52]. We find that the 90◦

rate depends only weakly on γ for small ATP concentrations which is reminiscent of the experimental observation that the ATP binding rate to the motor depends
only weakly on the size of the probe [52]. However, for
large ATP concentrations that were not investigated in
the experiment, the 90◦ rate shows a strong dependence
on γ. This is due to the fact that for small ATP concentrations the relaxation times of all probe particles are in
the order of, or even faster than, the motor jump rates.
The results for the 30◦ rate are consistent with experimental results for the hydrolysis rate [52]. Increasing
cP decreases the Pi release rate in the experiment as it
decreases the 30◦ rate here.

As a final more complex example, we apply our coarsegraining method to a model with a multi-state motor. We

the probe particle and an elastic linker V (y), we adopt
the transition rates of the motor from [5] and replace the
dependence on the external force by the dependence on
the elongation of the linker,

The change of chemical free energy µ±

The coarse-grained rates for the mechanical transition
are shown in Fig. 13. With decreasing γ, the rates
approach their fast-bead limit which corresponds to the
rates used in [5] while strong deviations occur for finite γ
especially for assisting external forces. The friction coefficient of a probe of size 500 nm as in [55] can be calculated
using Stokes’ law yielding γ ≃ 7.7 · 10−5 d2 /s. For friction coefficients in this range (light green (light gray) line
with triangles), our coarse-grained rates show a distinct
deviation from the one-particle rates (solid black lines).

However, the average velocity (obtained from our coarsegrained rates) as function of the external force coincides
very well for almost all γ with the velocity curve obtained
from the bare motor model, see Fig. 14. Like for the
F1 -ATPase model discussed in section III C, this agreement is due to the fact that the velocity involves only the
difference of the rates multiplied with the marginal distribution. If one investigates only force-velocity curves,
the discrepancies between the coarse-grained rates and
the one-particle rates are hardly visible.

ATPase models, the coarse-grained rates for the mechanical transition of the kinesin model show more structure especially for negative, i.e., assisting external forces.
Since the kinesin model contains several internal motor
cycles, depending on the external force the dominant cycle can change leading to crossover regimes with changing
weight of the probabilities Pi .
The dependence of the coarse-grained rates for chemical transitions on the external force is visible in Fig.
14. Although there is no explicit dependence on external
α
forces for pure chemical rates since dα
ij = 0, jij and Pi depend on fex via y. The operational current for transitions
within the F -cycle in + direction decreases with increasing fex whereas the operational currents within the Bcycle in + direction slightly increase with fex which can
be explained intuitively since the motor prefers “backward” cycles for large opposing forces. However, all
coarse-grained rates decrease with increasing fex similar to the bare motor rates (41, 42) which decrease with
larger y; a situation that is more likely to appear for large
external forces.

IV.

EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION

In order to practically apply the coarse-grained description, one has to determine the marginal distribuα
tions Pi , the operational currents jij
and the free enα
ergy differences ∆Fij . For multi-state motors, this is a
rather challenging task since only a few quantities can
be extracted reliably from the experimentally measured
trajectory of the probe. Note, however, that this problem does not happen exclusively in our approach but is
inevitable whatever method is used to infer motor properties from such trajectories.
In the following, using the 90-30 model for the F1 ATPase, we will illustrate how these quantities can be
estimated. If all motor transitions involve mechanical
transitions with different step sizes, the plateaus in the
probe trajectory can be assigned to specific correspond-

ing motor states. Since after a large enough time interval all possible transitions will have occured, one is also
able to reconstruct the links connecting the states. The
marginal distributions Pi are then given as the fraction of
time that the corresponding motor state is occupied. For
the two-state model of the F1 -ATPase, we assign plateaus
in the probe trajectory that are followed by a fast 90◦ forward or 30◦ backward displacement to motor state i = 1
and plateaus that are followed by fast 90◦ backward or
30◦ forward displacement to i = 2. In principle, there
are several possibilities to reconstruct hidden variables
from partially visible trajectories [59–61]. Here, we will
use a simple algorithm which sets i = 2 if four consecutive data points are within a specific range around 90◦
and otherwise i = 1. The marginal distributions P1 , P2
are then represented by the fraction of data points with
assigned i = 1, 2.
If the motor is not very complex, the operational curα
rents jij
can be obtained rather easily since they are precisely the net currents between two motor states. For
unicyclic motors, all operational currents are equal to the
average velocity divided by d, the operational current of
an ATP binding transition is the net disappearance rate
of ATP in the solution (given that there are no other ATP
binding reactions), etc.. If all motor transitions involve
mechanical transitions with different step sizes, the operational currents between any two states can be obtained
by counting the number of transitions of a specific step
α
size from i → j, nα
ij , and j → i, nji . The (time) average
of this current using one long trajectory of length ttot is
then given by
α
α
= (nα
jij
ij − nji )/ttot .

(43)

90
In our example, in order to estimate j12
we have to count
the number of sudden displacements of “size” 90◦ either
from the trajectory of the probe directly or from the reconstructed trajectory of the motor using the assignment
rule mentioned above. If the time resolution of the trajectory is very coarse or if the reconstruction method is
rather inaccurate, jumps that consist of fast consecutive
90 and 30 jumps with apparent step size 120◦ will appear
which have to be included in the number of 90◦ (and also
30◦ ) jumps. Fig. 15 shows a reconstructed motor trajectory obtained with the algorithm mentioned above. We
have used a trajectory of the probe from our simulations
as “experimental data”. Compared to the original motor
trajectory, this reconstruction captures the average dynamics quite well. Large fluctuations of the probe can
generate additional apparent motor jumps in the reconstructed trajectory that are absent in the original one.
Finally, the estimation of the free energy difference
∆Fijα = Fj − Fi − ∆µα
ij is slightly more involved. In
equilibrium (∆µ = 0, fex = 0), detailed balance holds,

∆µα,eq

binding or release of nucleotides. Thus, the equilibrium
α
free energy difference ∆Fij
(which explicitely depends
on the equilibrium concentrations) can be obtained from
the ratio of the marginal distributions under equilibrium

conditions. Using µi = µeq

with k = T, D, P and the sign depending on which binding or release event corresponds to the transition ij, α

the coarse-grained rates can be expressed by the equiα
librium free energy difference ∆Fij
obtained from experimental data at equilibrium conditions and the nucleotide concentrations with respect to the equilibrium
concentrations corresponding to the conditions used to

obtain ∆Fij

µT − µD = −F2 + F1 + µP = −∆F12 since ∆µ = 0 in

Once these quantities have been estimated, there are
no additional fit parameters needed or left. All concentrations as well as the external force are usually known
from the experimental setup. To obtain the coarsegrained rates from the probe trajectory of our 90-30
model, we then proceed as follows. First, we choose

The 90-30 model thus provides a useful demonstration
of the experimental applicability of the coarse-graining
method showing that it is possible to estimate the coarsegrained rates from experimental accessible data if the underlying motor network is not too complex. Considering
the simplicity of the applied reconstruction method, the
accuracy of the estimates is rather encouraging.

INVARIANCE OF ENTROPY PRODUCTION
AND EFFICIENCY

An important question for any coarse-graining method
concerns its effect on entropy production. In general,
a coarse-grained description without imposed time-scale
separation or detailed balance for the eliminated variables often underestimates the entropy production of the
system [29–32, 40]. In this section, we show that for

13
the type of models considered here, our coarse-graining
method conserves the entropy production even if there
is no time-scale separation between the eliminated and
remaining degree of freedom.
Since transitions can be uniquely attributed to motor
or probe particle, the total entropy production of the system [28] can be split in two parts, analogous to bipartite
or partially masked systems [63, 64],

Obviously, both Ṡtot

(52)

Using partial integration, it can be easily seen that the
parts involving V (y) cancel, i.e., the energy of the linker
is constant on average. The total entropy production is
then given by the chemical free energy consumption that
is not transformed into mechanical power.
For the coarse-grained description, the total entropy
production contains only contributions from the effective
jump process,

which is precisely (52). For these models for which the
state space of the eliminated degree of freedom does not
contain entropy producing internal cycles, the average
total entropy production in the NESS remains invariant
under our coarse-graining procedure.
It is also instructive to apply the entropy-splitting
scheme introduced in [31] to our coarse-graining procedure. In [31], it was shown that the total entropy production can be written as a sum of the coarse-grained

entropy production (53) plus a contribution of the microstates corresponding to a mesostate (which are eliminated during coarse-graining) plus a contribution due to
the fact that jumps between mesostates can occur involving different microstates. In our framework, the total
entropy production is already recovered by the coarsegrained entropy production. The two additional contributions which correspond to the total entropy production
of the probe particle and the average total entropy production of the motor minus the coarse-grained entropy
production cancel each other.
We finally show that our coarse-graining procedure
also preserves the energy transduction, or thermodynamic, efficiency ηT defined as the ratio of the extractable

For motor models with tight coupling or multi-state
models with a single motor cycle, the rate of chemical
˙ = v∆µ/d and the
energy input equals the velocity ∆µ
efficiency reduces to ηT = fex /∆µ. In general, however,
any idle cycles of the motor increases the rate of chemical input over the velocity and therefore reduces the efficiency.

VI.

STALL FORCE AND RATE ANOMALY

Coarse-graining multicyclic motor models as developed
here reveals a remarkable feature concerning the stall
force with significant implications on the interpretation
of experimental data. For an example, consider the kinesin motor for the parameters chosen in Fig. 13. Fig.
16 shows that the stall force is a function of the size of
the attached probe particle. Generally speaking, the stall
force can indeed depend on the size of the probe since the
network of the full system comprises more cycles than the
coarse-grained or bare motor network, see Fig. 7. Varying the size of the probe, the relative weight of the cycles
in the full system and hence their contribution to an operational current can change yielding a varying stall force.
Thus, the experimentally obtained stall force corresponds
to the stall conditions of the motor-probe complex but
does not necessarily represent the stall conditions of the
bare motor. If one is interested in the latter one should

the probe, stall conditions are reached for different values of
the external force. Parameters as in Fig. 13.

use very small probe particles since the limit of vanishing
friction coefficient γ is equivalent to applying the force directly to the motor. As discussed below, the stall force
is independent of γ for one-state or unicyclic multi-state
motor models. Hence, an experimentally observed variation of the stall force with probe size can be used as proof
that the motor is indeed multicyclic.
The varying stall force has also implications on the
transition rates. In Fig. 13, a close look around fex d = 14
shows that these data points are missing for the following reason. For all investigated models, we find that
if, as a function of the external force, the sign change
of an operational current depends on the friction coefficient γ, the coarse-grained rates corresponding to this
transitions can become piecewise negative. This phenomenon occurs
when the

An isolated sign change in the denominator of eqs. (24,
25) leads to a pole in the corresponding rate. Such an
anomaly in Ωα
ij necessarily implies a corresponding one
in Ωα
ji since the ratio of the effective rates obeys the local detailed balance condition which enforces the same
sign for both rates. In this range, the coarse-graining
scheme introduced here fails to produce physically acceptable rates. In practice, one should discard the results
at least when either a rate is negative or becomes larger
than the rate for vanishing bead size. In Fig. 17, where
we zoom into the range around the stall force, this range
is shaded gray. Taken at face value, this phenomenon
looks like a short-coming of our approach. It is the price
to pay for requiring over the full parameter range both
the local detailed balance condition and the correct net
currents from any one motor state to any other. While
the negative rates do not allow for a sensible physical
interpretation, they can nevertheless be used to calculate average quantities and yield, e.g., the correct entropy
production as shown in section V.
This stall force anomaly with a corresponding range
of negative rates occurs neither for any one-state motor
model nor for unicyclic motors around stall conditions
since only one motor cycle contributes to all cycles of the

to occur for the same fex . We also found several multicyclic motors that do not lead to negative rates, e.g.,
the kinesin model if one assumes the chemical rates to
be independent of y. A derivation of the precise conditions under which for multi-cyclic motor models a pair
of effective rates diverges or becomes negative must be
left to future work. We stress, however, that in all examples shown in this study, this anomaly occurs only in
the narrow range shown in Fig. 17. From a practical
point of view, it may therefore not be as relevant as it is
intriguing from a theoretical perspective.

VII.

CONCLUSION

Most experiments on molecular motors comprise some
kind of probe particle. Therefore, any theoretical modelling with parameters estimated from experimental data
will explicitly or implicitly contain characteristics of the
probe particle.
In this paper, we have introduced a systematic coarsegraining method that allows to reduce motor-bead models to effective one-particle motor models. This coarsegraining procedure provides a compromise between a oneparticle description that is simple to handle and a detailed model comprising the dynamics of the full system. It yields an effective one-particle model maintaining the true motor network, where the influence of the
probe is naturally incorporated without any additional
assumptions since the simplification of the description
takes place a posteriori. Any external force acting on the
probe is then acting on the effective motor directly. The
coarse-grained rates obey a LDB condition and yield the
correct net currents. Fixing the marginal distribution
and the average currents, there is still freedom on how
to choose the rates. Only with the LDB condition the
effective rates are determined uniquely.
Applying the coarse-graining procedure to motor-bead
models, we find that in general the coarse-grained rates

15
do not show a single exponential dependence on the external force in contrast to what is often assumed for mechanical transition rates in one-particle models. Only in
the often unrealistic limit of fast bead relaxation, the
coarse-grained rates reduce to the corresponding oneparticle rates.
In the absence of external forces, in general the coarsegrained rates are not proportional to the ATP concentration even if the motor rates obey mass action law kinetics. This feature originates from the drag effect of
probe (due to friction) that is incorporated in the coarsegrained rates. For the same reason, the average velocity
shows a sub-linear dependence on the ATP concentration
even for a one-state motor model. Assuming an a priori
one-state model with external force acting directly on the
motor, one would have either to use a rather counterintuitive complex force-dependence of the transition rates
or to introduce additional motor states in order to obtain
a sublinearly growing velocity caused by the drag of the
probe. In a one-particle description, the effect of large
probe particles on the dwell time distributions could also
be mistaken as signature of additional motor states thus
leading to an overly complex motor network [21, 56].
Considering the influence of the coarse-graining procedure on the stochastic thermodynamics of the system, we
show that the total entropy production remains invariant
under coarse-graining. This is due to the fact that, on
the one hand, the state space of the eliminated degree of
freedom contains no entropy producing cycles. On the
other hand the design of the coarse-graining procedure
is also important. It has to conserve the motor network
as well as the net currents and provide transition rates
fulfilling a LDB condition. Likewise, the thermodynamic
efficiency remains invariant in our scheme.
Our coarse-graining method conserves average quantities like the entropy production or operational currents
although eliminating the dynamics of the probe particle
strongly affects the cycle structure of the full system. In
order to preserve also fluctuations of current observables
in the long-time limit it was found that coarse-graining
methods should conserve the cycle structure of the full
system [36, 37].
From the experimental point of view, in order to obtain
the simpler effective model, the underlying mesoscopic
modelling need not to be known since all these quantities enter the coarse-grained description via the net currents and the marginal distributions which, in principle,
can be extracted from the experimental data as we have
demonstrated using a two step model for the F1 -ATPase.
The main advantage of the coarse-graining procedure
introduced here is that once the rates have been obtained
from experimentally accessible quantities, they automatically fulfill a LDB condition and provide the correct average currents, i.e., velocity, entropy production, hydrolysis
rate etc..
For multicyclic motors, the coarse-graining procedure
can yield rates that can have poles and become (piecewise) negative. If this scenario occurs, the coarse-grained

rates lack a physical interpretation as transition probabilities in this range but they can still be used to calculate
average quantities. For this class of motors the stall force
typically depends on the size of the probe particle, i.e.,
the friction coefficient. Applying naively a one-particle
model to such an experimental setup would not allow
to determine the energy transduction mechanism of the
motor correctly. For one-state motors, the coarse-grained
rates are always positive.
So far, we have discussed coarse-graining only under
NESS conditions. In principle, the coarse-graining procedure as introduced in sections II B and III A can also
be applied to non-stationary states, e.g., if the nucleotide
concentrations are not constant and ∆µ decreases with
time [62, 66]. Such a scenario would yield time-dependent
Pi ’s, net currents, LDB conditions and therefore also
time-dependent coarse-grained rates.
Further generalizations might include other types of
models representing the full system. While developed
here for discrete motor models, the coarse-graining procedure should be also applicable to continuous motors
moving in a tilted periodic potential where the potential minima will become the discrete states of the coarsegrained effective motor. The introduction of the index α
in principle also accounts for more involved potentials or
free energy surfaces that depend on both the motor and
the probe state.

Appendix: Limiting case: Large applied force

In the limit of large external forces, fex → ∞, the
coarse-grained rates (7, 8) can be expressed as
Ω+ ≈ − v exp[∆µ − fex d]/d
−

Ω ≈ − v/d.

(A.1)
(A.2)

While ∆µ is independent of the external force, the average velocity is a function of the external force
v = h∂y V (y) − fex i/γ = κhyi/γ − fex /γ.

(A.3)

It becomes negative for forces larger than the stall force
∆µ/d which ensures that both Ω+ and Ω− are positive.
If there is no time-scale separation between the dynamics
of motor and probe, hyi grows linearly in fex for fex → ∞
with a smaller slope than 1/κ. On the other hand with
time scale separation, we have hyi = fex /κ. Note that
within time scale separation, the average velocity has
to be calculated using the average velocity of the motor, eq. (4), since the “average velocity” of the probe
h∂y V (y) − fexi/γ is zero as a result of the fast-bead limit

16
of eq. (3). Due to the linear dependence of hyi on fex ,
the average velocity, and therefore also Ω− , are then proportional to the external force whereas the exponential
factor dominates for Ω+ ,
+

(A.4)

−

(A.5)

Ω ∼ fex exp[∆µ − fex d]/(γd)
Ω ∼ fex /(γd).

As above, the average y grows linearly and the velocity
is proportional to fex if there is no time-scale separation
which leads to
Ω+ ∼ |fex |/(γd)
−

Ω ∼ |fex | exp[−∆µ + fex d]/(γd).

(A.8)
(A.9)

(A.7)

This simple analysis clearly shows that the coarse-grained
rates do not coincide with the often a priori assumed
single exponential force-dependence of one-particle rates.
Within our numerical analysis, the asymptotic behaviour
appears for |fex | & 500/d. The regime for large forces
shown in Figs. 2 and 3 is not the asymptotics yet. However, since hyi is also linear in fex in this region yet with
different slope, v is still proportional to fex .
