Nonlinearity arising from noncooperative transcription factor binding
enhances negative feedback and promotes genetic oscillations
Iván M. Lengyel,1 Daniele Soroldoni,2, 3 Andrew C. Oates,2, 3 Luis G. Morelli1∗
We study the effects of multiple binding sites in the promoter of a genetic oscillator. We
evaluate the regulatory function of a promoter with multiple binding sites in the absence
of cooperative binding, and consider different hypotheses for how the number of bound
repressors affects transcription rate. Effective Hill exponents of the resulting regulatory
functions reveal an increase in the nonlinearity of the feedback with the number of binding
sites. We identify optimal configurations that maximize the nonlinearity of the feedback.
We use a generic model of a biochemical oscillator to show that this increased nonlinearity
is reflected in enhanced oscillations, with larger amplitudes over wider oscillatory ranges.
Although the study is motivated by genetic oscillations in the zebrafish segmentation clock,
our findings may reveal a general principle for gene regulation.

I.

Introduction

Cells can generate temporal patterns of activity
by means of genetic oscillations [1, 2]. Genetic oscillations are biochemical oscillations in the levels
of gene products [3–14]. They can be produced
by negative feedback regulation of gene expression,
in which a gene product inhibits its own production directly or indirectly [15]. Such autoinhibition is often performed by transcriptional repressors, proteins or protein complexes that bind the
promoter of a gene and inhibit the transcription of
new mRNA molecules [16,17], see Fig. 1. A theoret∗ Email:

ical description of biochemical oscillations requires
a delayed negative feedback, together with sufficient nonlinearity and a balance of the timescales
of the different processes involved [18]. Delays may
occur naturally in transcriptional regulation, since
the assembly of gene products involves intermediate steps [16,19,20]. Nonlinearity refers to the presence of nonlinear terms in the equations describing
the dynamics. Such nonlinear terms may occur in
the equations due to the presence of cooperative
biochemical processes, where cooperativity is understood as a phenomenon in which several components act together to orchestrate some collective
behavior [21]. Although some processes giving rise
to nonlinear terms are known, in general it is still
an open question how nonlinearity is built into genetic oscillators.
A compelling model system for genetic oscillations is the vertebrate segmentation clock [22–25].
This is a tissue-level pattern generator that controls
the formation of vertebrate segments during embryonic development [25, 26]. The spatiotemporal
patterns generated by the segmentation clock are

thought to be initiated by a genetic oscillator at the
single cell level [7,9,10,27–29]. In this genetic oscillator, negative feedback is provided by genes of the
Her family, which code proteins that form dimers
and can act as transcriptional repressors [30–34].
The time taken from transcription, translation and
splicing may introduce the necessary feedback delays in zebrafish and mouse [19,34–37]. One source
of nonlinearity in the segmentation clock oscillator is the dimerization of gene products that bind
the promoter of cyclic genes [32]. However, this
may be insufficient to generate the observed oscillations in the levels of gene products. One way to
increase nonlinearity would be cooperative binding
of repressors to regulatory binding sites at the promoter [21, 38, 39]. Cooperative binding to multiple binding sites can make the negative feedback
steeper [40]. A similar effect occurs with ultrasensitivity in phosphorylation cascades [41]. The
presence of clusters of binding sites for transcription factors may be a common motif in gene regulation [42], and cooperativity in transcription factor
binding has been reported for some systems [43].
In zebrafish, multiple binding sites for Her dimers
have been identified in the promoter region of
Her1, Her7, and other genes of the Notch pathway [32, 44, 45]. However, there is no evidence for

cooperative binding of transcriptional regulators in
the case of the zebrafish segmentation clock. Therefore, although cooperative binding is not ruled out,
this lack of evidence raises the general question of
what contribution could be expected from the multiple binding sites reported in the promoter of segmentation clock cyclic genes. Here we use theory to
study how multiple binding sites affect nonlinearity
and biochemical oscillations in a generic description
of a genetic oscillator.

II.

A promoter with multiple binding sites

We first evaluate the regulatory function of a promoter that contains N binding sites for a transcriptional repressor, see Fig. 2. We consider transcriptional repressors although the results in this section
are more general and would apply to other types of
transcription factors. We focus on a single transcriptional repressor for the sake of simplicity, and
assume that all binding sites are identical. That
is, binding and unbinding of repressors to the different sites occur at the same rates for all sites.
Moreover, we assume that there is no cooperativity
in repressor binding. This means that binding and
unbinding rates are not affected by the presence of
bound factors to any of the other sites.

where b is the basal production rate, c is the decay
rate of products, P relates to the number of gene
copies, τ is the total delay for product assembly,
and x0 is the product concentration that halves the
basal transcription rate. The regulatory function
Eq. (8) is parametrized by N and M . This genetic
oscillator is a reduction of the models proposed by
Lewis [19], and other authors [48, 49]. It describes
the protein concentration, but does not include the
mRNA; the duration of transcription and translation are both included in the delay τ . Furthermore,
it does not describe effects present in theories that
include more than one regulator [32, 50, 51], but
here it is enough to illustrate the effects of multiple
binding sites in a simpler context.
We integrate Eq. (9) numerically and evaluate
the resulting dynamics by calculating the amplitude and period of oscillations. In all numerical
simulations, we use the function dde23 from MATLAB [52]. Scanning the values of N and M , we
determine whether the system oscillates in steady
state: when the difference in the maxima over the
last ten cycles falls below 0.01, the simulation is
stopped and we record the output.
The amplitude of oscillations grows with the
number of binding sites N , Fig. 4C. The range
where the system oscillates grows with the number of binding sites N . The amplitude is nonmonotonic in M : for a fixed number of binding sites
N , there is an optimal value for M that maximizes
the amplitude of oscillations, Fig.4C. The period
of oscillations grows with N and decreases with M .
These results show how the change in nonlinearity observed in the regulatory functions is reflected
in the oscillations as the number of binding sites
change.

we do not have detailed knowledge of how these
transcriptional repressors affect transcription rates
when bound to the promoters of cyclic genes. There
is evidence from transcriptional analysis of the Hes1
gene in mouse indicating that inhibition is gradual [30]. While the wildtype Hes1 promoter containing all three N Box elements that are bound by
Hes1 proteins showed a 30-fold inhibition of transcription in the presence of Hes1, mutations in one,
two, and three of the N Box elements showed impaired inhibition with 14-, 7-, and 2-fold inhibition,
respectively [30].
Motivated by these results, we consider here a
scenario where additional bound repressors gradually reduce transcription rate until it drops to zero,
Fig. 5A. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that
transcription rate drops linearly as a function of
bound repressors, from a basal rate b, to zero for

see Fig. 5B. As in the previous case, it is clear that
the effective inhibition threshold shifts to the right
as k increases, but it is not so clear if the steepness
of the regulatory function changes and, if so, how.
Performing fits to Hill functions, we find that the
nonmonotonic behavior of the effective Hill exponent h is observed again as k increases, Fig. 6A,B.
Oscillations are similarly affected by noncooperative binding with gradual inhibition, Fig. 6C,D.

gle bound dimer inhibits transcription completely,
they used the data from the transcriptional analysis
of the Hes1 gene to estimate an effective Hill coefficient for the Mouse Hes1 oscillator, obtaining an
upper bound of about 3. More recently, the effect
of two binding sites as compared to a single binding
site was discussed together with differential decay
of the monomers [57].
Our theory predicts how changing the number
of binding sites N , and the number M of bound
repressors that produce full inhibition affects a single cell oscillator. Although an experiment that
changes the value of M may currently be challenging in a cellular system, the number of binding sites
N is more amenable to experimental manipulation.
For example, binding sites could be mutated [30], or
deleted from the promoter, or they could be interfered with using genome editing strategies such as
TALEN [58] or CRISPR [59] to alter or delete specific binding sites. To assess the effects of these perturbations in experiments may also pose some challenges. Dropping the number of binding sites from
N = 12 to N = 6 introduces a period change of
about 2.5%, while amplitude halves over the same
range, Fig. 4C,D. Experiments will require at least
such precision to reliably detect changes.
Our results suggest a possible evolutionary mechanism to increase nonlinearity in gene regulatory
systems. In this mechanism, point mutations in the
promoter that increase the number of binding sites
for transcription factors may increase the steepness
of regulatory functions. If the resulting steeper regulation performs some function better, such mutations would have a good chance to be conserved
by natural selection. In the case of the segmentation clock, the amplitude of oscillations could increase with the number of binding sites, possibly
reducing the signal to noise ratio. Furthermore,
the range for oscillations would be wider, making
the oscillatory regime less sensitive to slow extrinsic fluctuations of parameter values. Remarkably,
it may happen that after an increase in N , an increase in M also raises nonlinearity, see Fig. 4A.
This means that weaker repressors would result in
better oscillations. This evolutionary mechanism
would provide a simple way to gradually increase
the nonlinearity of a feedback or other regulatory
function.
The theory for the zebrafish regulatory function
could be refined using the experimentally measured

additional roles. For example, it could serve as a
buffer for fluctuations in gene expression [20,60–64],
augmenting the precision of genetic oscillations.
This will be the topic of future work.

we include an explicit factor 2 in the exponent to
account for the dimerization of the transcriptional
repressors. One advantage of Hill functions is that
they are very simply parametrized. In the main
