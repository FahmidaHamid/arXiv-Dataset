In living cells, motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein can move processively along microtubule
(MT), and also detach from or attach to MT stochastically. Experiments have found that, the traffic
of motor might be jammed, and various theoretical models have been designed to understand this
traffic jam phenomenon. But previous studies mainly focus on motor attachment/detachment rate
dependent properties. Recent experiment of Leduc et al. found that the traffic jam formation of
motor protein kinesin depends also on the length of MT [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 61006105 (2012)]. In this study, the MT length dependent properties of motor traffic will be analyzed.
We found that MT length has one critical value Nc , traffic jam occurs only when MT length N > Nc .
The jammed length of MT increases with total MT length, while the non-jammed MT length might
not change monotonically with the total MT length. The critical value Nc increases with motor
detachment rate from MT, but decreases with motor attachment rate to MT.

INTRODUCTION

Motor proteins are essential for biophysical functioning of living cells [1–4]. Processive motors, such as kinesin and dynein, can transport organelles and vesicles
along microtubule (MT) unidirectionally [5–10]. Experiments found that the traffic of motors along MT might
be jammed [11], and actually, this jammed phenomenon
has been predicted by various theoretical models [12–17].
This traffic problem can be described by totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), in which the
track (MT) of motors is regarded as a one-dimensional
lattice of size N . Each lattice site can be either empty
or occupied by one motor. In the bulk, motors can hop
from site i to site i + 1 with constant rate v (for simplicity, v = 1 is usually used), provided the target site is
empty. At site 1, motors can enter the lattice from cell
environment with density α , provided the site is empty.
At site N , motors can leave the lattice into environment
of density β with rate 1 − β. Meanwhile, motors can attach to bulk sites of MT with rate ωa , and detach from
bulk site of MT with rate ωd . The TASEP has been
studied extensively [14, 16, 18–20]. However, previous
studies about TASEP mainly focus on rates α, β, ωa , ωd
dependent properties in long MT length limit, such as the

existence and properties of domain wall (DW), which is
defined as the interface of high motor density and low
motor density [14, 16, 21–26].
One surprising finding in the recent experiment of
Leduc et al. is that, different from macroscale vehicle
traffic, the formation of traffic jam of motor protein kinesin (Kip3) depends not only on rates α, β, ωa , ωd but
also on the length of MT [27, 28]. For given rate constants α, β, ωa , ωd , there exists one critical value Nc of
MT length, DW occurs only if the MT length N > Nc .
If there is no DW for N → ∞, there will be no DW for
any finite value N . But, even if DW occurs for N → ∞,
there will be no DW for MT length N < Nc . In cells, MT
length N is always finite, so it is biophysical necessary
to study MT length N dependent properties of motor
traffic. Since the rates α, β, ωa , ωd dependent properties
have been extensively analyzed [14, 16, 18–20, 25], only
the MT length N dependent properties of motor traffic,
especially the rates α, β, ωa , ωd dependent critical MT
length Nc , will be discussed in this study.

METHOD

Let ρi be the probability that MT site i is occupied by
one motor, then ρi is governed by the following equations
[16]
dρi /dt = vρi−1 (1 − ρi ) − vρi (1 − ρi+1 ) + ωa (1 − ρi ) − ωd ρi ,
(1)

2
for 2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1, and at the boundaries i = 1, N ,
dρ1 /dt = α(1 − ρ1 ) − vρ1 (1 − ρ2 ),
dρN /dt = vρN −1 (1 − ρN ) − βρN .

(2)

For kinesin Kip3 studied in [27], i = 1 is the minus-end
of MT, and i = N is the plus-end of MT. For N large
enough, Eq. (1) can be approximated as the following
differential equation
ǫρ′′ (x) + v(2ρ(x) − 1)ρ′ (x) = (Ωa + Ωd )ρ(x) − Ωa , (3)
with boundary conditions ρ(0) = α/v, ρ(1) = 1 − β/v.
Where Ωa,d = lim N ωa,d , and ǫ → 0 is a small parameter
[14]. For the special case v = 1, the properties of motor traffic, especially the existence of DW and boundary
layer (BL) of motor density ρ(x), have been detailed discussed, see Tab. I or [16]. Let ρlα and ρrβ be solutions of
(2ρ(x)−1)ρ′ (x) = (Ωa +Ωd )ρ(x)−Ωa but with boundary
conditions ρlα (0) = α and ρrβ (1) = β respectively. The
results listed in Tab. I can be roughly summarized as
follows, (I) if 0 < α < 0.5 and there exists x0 such that
ρlα (x0 ) + ρrβ (x0 ) = 1, then (a) DW occurs at x = x0
if 0 < x0 < 1, (b) BL occurs at left boundary x = 0 if
x0 ≤ 0, and (c) BL occurs at right boundary x = 1 if
x0 > 1. Meanwhile, BL always occurs at right boundary
x = 1 if 0.5 < β < 1. (II) Otherwise, BL always occurs at left boundary x = 0, and will also occur at right
boundary x = 1 if 0.5 < β < 1.
However, as mentioned before, recent experiment of
Leduc et al. found that motor traffic depends also on
MT length N , DW occurs only when MT length N large
enough [27]. Therefore, the mean field results listed in
Tab. I might not be reasonable. The MT length N dependent properties of motor traffic should be discussed.
The results listed in Tab. I indicate that, for N → ∞,
one necessary condition of DW formation is 0 < α < 0.5.
So in this study, we will mainly focus on this special case,
and discuss the critical MT length Nc .

III.

the formation of DW and the ratio of jammed MT length
dependent on MT length N . For 1/(K + 1) < β < 1, the
ratio of jammed MT length increases with MT length N
[see Figs. 1(a, c)], but for 0 < β < 1/(K + 1) this ratio
does not change monotonically with N [see Fig. 1(b)].
The results plotted in Fig. 1(d) show that the formation
of BL also depends on MT length N . Let NL and NH
be the length of MT with low and high motor densities
respectively (in calculations, low density means motor
density ρ < 0.5, and high density means ρ ≥ 0.5). The
results plotted in Fig. 2 (a-d) show that, for the cases (2)
(3), both the high density length NH and its ratio NH /N
increases with MT length N , the low density length NL
first increases and then decreases with MT length N , but
its ratio NL /N decreases monotonically with MT length
N . However, for the case (1), neither NH /N nor NL /N
changes monotonically with MT length N , though NH
and NL increase with N for almost everywhere, see Fig.
2 (e) (f).
One meaningful question about the MT length dependent traffic of motors is that when DW will occur, provided DW occurs in large N limit. Let Nc be the critical value of MT length, i.e. DW occures iff MT length
N > Nc . The curves plotted in Fig. 3 show that, Nc
decreases with motor attachment rate α to the first site
of MT, but increases with detachment rate β from the
last site of MT. Meanwhile, Nc increases with attachment rate ωa and deceases with detachment rate ωd . This
means that, motors will be more likely to be jammed for
high motor attachment rates (α and ωd ) and low motor
detachment rates (β and ωd ).
Finally, the curves plotted in Fig. 4 show that both the
non-jammed MT length NL and its ratio NL /N increase
with motor velocity v, while the jammed MT length NH
and its ratio NH /N decrease with v. So slow motors are
more likely to be jammed. One can easily deduce that the
critical length Nc of MT increases with motor velocity v,
which means that long MT is needed to block the traffic
of fast motors.

RESULTS

The results of long MT limit listed in Tab. I indicate
that, there are three typical cases in which DW might
occur, (1) 0 < α < 0.5, 0 < β < 1/(K + 1), where K =
ωa /ωd , (2) 0 < α < 0.5, 1/(K + 1) < β < 0.5, and (3)
0 < α < 0.5 0.5 < β < 1. The motor densities plotted in
Figs. 1(a, b, c) show that, for any of the three cases, both

CONCLUSIONS

Since the motor traffic along microtubule (MT) depends not only on motor attachment/detachment rates
[16], but also on MT length [27], the previous results obtained by assuming MT length N tends to infinity might

3
be misleading. Therefore, in this study, the MT length
dependent properties of motor traffic are studied. We
found that, for given attachment and detachment rates
the MT length has one critical value Nc , domain wall
occurs only when MT length N > Nc . This critical
length Nc increases with detachment rate but decreases
with attachment rate. The jammed MT length NH increases with MT length N , but depending on the motor detachment rate β from the last MT site, the nonjammed MT length NL might not change monotonically
with N . Meanwhile, for not too small motor detachment
rate, β > 1/(K + 1), the ratio of jammed MT length
increases monotonically with MT length N . Calculations also show that, both the non-jammed MT length
NL and its ratio NL /N increase with motor velocity v.

In a words, the motor traffic will be more likely to be
jammed for slow motors, or motors with high attachment rate to MT and low detachment rate from MT.
The results in this study are helpful to understand corresponding experimental observations [27]. This study also
tells us that we should be more careful to draw conclusions from continuous theoretical models for microscopic
biophysical process.

FIG. 1: Four typical examples of motor density along MT with different length. For the sake of comparison, the MT length
is normalized. (a) α = 0.24, β = 0.48, ωa = 0.001, ωd = 0.0002. Motor traffic is not jammed for short MT, but for MT length
N ≥ 120, motor is jammed from the right boundary. The ratio of jammed MT length NH /N increases with MT length N . (b)
α = 0.01, β = 0.1, ωa = 0.001, ωd = 0.0002. Similarly, motor traffic is not jammed for short MT, but as MT length N increases,
motor is jammed from the right boundary. However, the ratio of jammed MT length NH /N does not change monotonically
with MT length N . (c) α = 0.25, β = 0.7, ωa = 0.001, ωd = 0.0002. Similar as in (a), but BL occurs at the MT end for long
MT. (d) α = 0.8, β = 0.9, ωa = 0.001, ωd = 0.0008. There is no DW but BL occurs at the both end of MT for long MT. (a) (b)
(c) are examples of 1/(K + 1) < β < 0.5, 0 < β < 1/(K + 1), 0.5 < β < 1 respectively. (d) is an example of 0.5 < α < 1 and
