TRANSITIONS IN ACTIVE ROTATOR SYSTEMS:
INVARIANT HYPERBOLIC MANIFOLD APPROACH
GIAMBATTISTA GIACOMIN, KHASHAYAR PAKDAMAN, XAVIER PELLEGRIN,
AND CHRISTOPHE POQUET
Abstract. Our main focus is on a general class of active rotators with mean field
interactions, that is globally coupled large families of dynamical systems on the unit
circle with non-trivial stochastic dynamics. The dynamics of each isolated system is
dψt = −δV ′ (ψt ) dt + dwt , where V ′ is a periodic function, w is a Brownian motion and δ
is an intensity parameter. It is well known that the interacting dynamics is accurately described, in the limit of infinitely many interacting components, by a Fokker-Planck PDE
and the model reduces for δ = 0 to a particular case of the Kuramoto synchronization
model, for which one can show the existence of a stable normally hyperbolic manifold
of stationary solutions for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (we are interested
in the case in which this manifold is non-trivial, that happens when the interaction is
sufficiently strong, that is in the synchronized regime of the Kuramoto model). We use
the robustness of normally hyperbolic structures to infer qualitative and quantitative
results on the |δ| ≤ δ0 cases, with δ0 a suitable threshold: as a matter of fact, we obtain
an accurate description of the dynamics on the invariant manifold for δ 6= 0 and we link
it explicitly to the potential V . This approach allows to have a complete description of
the phase diagram of the active rotators model, at least for |δ| ≤ δ0 , thus identifying for
which values of the parameters (notably, noise intensity and/or coupling strength) the
system exhibits periodic pulse waves or stabilizes at a quiescent resting state. Moreover,
some of our results are very explicit and this brings a new insight into the combined
effect of active rotator dynamics, noise and interaction. The links with the literature on
specific systems, notably neuronal models, are discussed in detail.

1. Introduction
1.1. Coupled excitable systems. There are diverse examples of threshold phenomena
in natural systems. Dynamics of excitable systems, as exemplified by neuronal membranes
(to which we restrict for sake of conciseness), constitute one of the common forms of
threshold behavior. Excitable systems are characterized by their nonlinear response to
perturbations. In the absence of inputs, they remain at a resting state. This state is
locally stable in the sense that the system returns rapidly to it after small perturbations.
However, for inputs beyond a critical range, the response of the system takes on a very
different form, before regaining the resting state. In the phase portrait of the system,
subthreshold responses correspond to monotonic returns to the stable equilibrium while
suprathreshold ones appear as excursions that take the system transiently away from the
stable equilibrium. Excitability is one of the key neuronal properties at the heart of

signal processing and transmission in nervous systems. Motivated by their ubiquity and
numerous experimental observations attesting to their functional importance, there has
been a characterization of various forms of excitability in terms of the geometry of the
phase portrait of dynamical systems [9].
Excitable systems are particularly sensitive to noise because such random signals contain
consecutive sub and suprathreshold segments that occur in an unpredictable manner. The
interplay between the nonlinearity inherent in the threshold mechanisms and the noise
induced fluctuations can produce a large variety of dynamics in excitable systems, some of
which are reviewed in [12]. In this paper, we consider one of these, namely, noise induced
synchronous coherent oscillations in assemblies of coupled excitable systems.
Noisy excitable systems display irregular repetitive suprathreshold excursions henceforth referred to as firing. In ensembles of such units receiving independent noise, the
firings of the units remain independent from one another as long as there are no interconnections between them. Coupling the units with one another introduces correlations
between their firings. Synchrony is the extreme form of such correlations when the units
fire almost simultaneously. However, synchronous firings can be irregular. One of the surprising effects of noise in assemblies of interacting excitable systems is that for some range
of coupling strength and noise intensity, units fire synchronously and regularly. The wide
occurrence of these noise induced coherent dynamics and their underlying mechanisms are
well documented as explained below. Their putative functional role in nervous systems is
to participate in rhythm generation in the absence of pacemaker units (see for instance
[10]). Despite the large number of numerical explorations devoted to this phenomenon, it
has not been analyzed from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the present paper
is to deal with this aspect.
Two key elements are at play in the occurrence of noise induced regular synchronous
firing in assemblies of interacting excitable units, one is that interacting excitable units act
globally like a single excitable system at the population level, the other is that noise driven
excitable systems undergo coherence resonance [17]. How the combination of these two
phenomena leads to noise induced regularly synchronous firing has been first highlighted
in an analysis of networks of an elementary neuronal model [18, 19], see also [5, 20].
The important point is the generality of this mechanisms. It neither relies on the refined
properties of specific classes of excitable systems nor on the types of coupling. In fact,
noisy assemblies of all common neuronal models, irrespective of the type of excitability,
and whether coupled diffusively or through excitatory pulses or synapses, readily produce
noise induced regular synchronous firing. To our knowledge, one of the earliest reports of
this phenomenon goes back to the explorations of MacGregor and Palasek of randomly
connected populations of neuromimes incorporating a large array of individual neuronal
properties [13]. More recent examples include the description of the same phenomenon
in common neuronal models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley [30], the FitzHugh-Nagumo
[29], the Morris-Lecar [5], the Hindmarsch-Rose [4] and others implementing detailed
biophysical properties [10]. In these references, besides differences in the models there are
also differences in coupling and network architecture: in some the units are diffusively
coupled, in others they are coupled through excitatory pulses; in some connectivity is allto-all, while others deal with random networks. Our enumeration, which does not intend
to be exhaustive, illustrates the ease with which assemblies of excitable units generate
noise-induced synchronous regular activity, irrespective of model and network details.
The ubiquity of the phenomenon strongly supports investigating its key characteristics
through the mathematical analysis of a minimal model that captures its essence. The

model we consider is a general version of the so-called active rotator (AR) which is representative of the so-called class I excitable systems [9].
1.2. Active rotator models. The AR is a variant of the Kuramoto model for excitableoscillatory systems that evolve on a unit circle [1]. Precisely, the AR model can be introduced via the stochastic equations

dψj (t) = −δV (ψj (t)) dt −
sin (ψj (t) − ψi (t)) dt + σ dwj (t) ,

where j = 1, . . . , N , N is a (large) integer, K, σ, and δ are non-negative constants, the
wj ’s are IID standard Brownian motions and V is a smooth function (in the applications
the case in which V ′ is a trigonometric polynomial will play an important role, so me may
as well think of this case). We look at ψj as an element of S := R/2πZ, that is ψj is a
phase, and, of course we have to supply an initial condition for (1.1): for example we can
take {ψj (0)}j=1,...,N to be independent identically distributed random variables.
This set of equations defines a diffusion on SN describing the evolution of N noisy
interacting phases: note that since K ≥ 0 the interaction has a tendency to synchronize
the ψj ’s and let us stress from now that such an N -dimensional diffusion reduces for δ = 0
to a dynamics
that is reversible with respect to the Gibbs measure with Hamiltonian given

the name of “mean field classical XY model”: we refer to [3] for more details, but we point
out that for δ > 0 (of course the case δ < 0 is absolutely analogous), unless V is a periodic
function (which we do not assume: consider for example V ′ (ψ) = 1), the dynamics is not
reversible. Nevertheless, it is well known that the large N behavior of such a system can
be described in terms of the Fokker-Planck or McKean-Vlasov PDE (the literature on this
issue is very vast: see for example the references in [3]):

where J(·) := −K sin(·) and θ ∈ S. To be precise, pδt (·) is a probability density and it

captures the N → ∞ limit of the empirical (probability) measure N1 N

δa is the Dirac delta measure on a. Actually, one can even describe with great accuracy
(as N → ∞) the dynamics of each unit system (in interaction!): it evolves following a nonlocal diffusion equation, called at times non-linear diffusion. The non-locality comes from
the fact that ψj is subject not only to the force field V ′ , but also to the field corresponding
to the interaction with all other unit systems, and it all boils down to
dψ(t) = −δV ′ (ψ(t)) dt + (J ∗ pδt )(ψ(t)) dt + σ dw(t) ,

(1.3)

with w a standard Brownian motion, and it turns out that the probability distribution of
ψ(t) is precisely pδt if ψ(0) has distribution pδ0 .
In mathematical terms, the question that we want to tackle is: what is the relation
between the simple deterministic one dimensional dynamics ψ̇ = −V ′ (ψ) (Isolated Deterministic System: IDS) and the behavior of the associated N dimensional diffusion, for N
large? The question is actually twofold. First, given a potential V for the IDS, what is the
collective dynamic of the N large limit (1.2)? Conversely, what are the possible collective
dynamics of (1.2)? In order to be more concrete let us ask the following sharper questions:
is it possible that

4

G. GIACOMIN, K. PAKDAMAN, X. PELLEGRIN, C. POQUET

• the IDS has only one stable point, for example if V (ψ) = ψ − a cos(ψ) for a > 1,
but the N → ∞ system exhibits stable periodic behavior, that is there is a stable
periodic solution to (1.2)?
• the IDS has only periodic solutions, but the N → ∞ system has stable stationary
solutions?
The fact that the answer to these questions is positive is, to a certain extent, known.
Notably, in their numerical investigations of the dynamics of coupled noisy ARs, Shinomoto and Kuramoto reported the existence of collective periodic oscillations, the same
phenomenon we have referred to as noise induced regular synchronous activity [26]. They
also performed numerical explorations of the transitions to and from this coherent state.
The key ingredient in such analyses has been to consider the bifurcations of the associated
Fokker-Planck equation (we anticipate that our results make rigorous some of their predictions, see Section 3). To clarify how noise generates such time-periodic global activity
in coupled excitable ARs, Kurrer and Schulten approximated the solutions of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations by Gaussian distributions [11]. Under this assumption, they
obtained closed ordinary differential equations for the mean and variance of the distribution and used the bifurcation diagram of these to investigate the regimes where the model
generates periodic oscillations. Related work can be found for example in [6, 14], where
finite N analysis has been performed, or in [15, 16, 27], where variants of the model have
been considered.
However, from a mathematical viewpoint this phenomenon is only very partially understood. We are aware of the contributions [21, 22, 23, 28] that are somewhat close in spirit
to what we are doing: these references deal with periodic behavior in nonlinear Markov
processes and, more generally, with the effect of the noise on (mean field) interacting dynamical systems. We also deal with nonlinear Markov processes – the evolution equation
(1.3) contains the law of the process itself – even if this aspect is not emphasized in the
remainder of the paper. In particular, Scheutzow [22] provides examples of mean-field type
systems in which periodic behavior arises in the N → ∞ system, even if it is not present
in absence of noise. The ingenious model set forth in [22] is however rather particular: for
example the author plays with some stochastic differential equations of nonlinear Markov
type that admit also Gaussian solutions and the analysis boils down to studying the behavior of the expectation and covariance of these solutions. This is close to the approach
taken by Touboul, Hermann and Faugeras [28], who extensively exploit the preservation
of the Gaussian character that holds for certain nonlinear Markov processes and they do
so for models that aim at describing neural activity. We stress that in their approach the
IDS dynamics is linear, while for us the nonlinearity of the IDS is a key feature. Rybko,
Shlosman and Vladimirov in [21] study a connected network of servers that behaves in a
periodic fashion in the infinite volume limit, when there are sufficiently many customers
per server (load per server): in this regime there is an effective synchronization between
servers and the load per server plays a role which is similar to the parameter K in our
work, cf. (1.1).
1.3. Informal presentation of approach and results. The purpose of this work is
to show that for general AR systems one can systematically (at least for some range of
the parameters) and quantitatively exhibit the relation between the IDS and the infinite
system. This is done by showing that the (infinite-dimensional!) AR system does behave
like a one dimensional AR, and the latter can be throughly analyzed. We obtain such a
drastic reduction of dimension by exploiting the fact that for the δ = 0 case of (1.2) one

TRANSITIONS IN ACTIVE ROTATOR SYSTEMS

can perform a rather detailed analysis (due to the fact that it is the grandient flow of a
free energy functional [3]). In that case and when K > Kc := σ 2 , stationary solutions of
1
which is unstable, and a circle M = {q(· − θ0 ) : θ0 ∈ S}, which is
(1.2) are the constant 2π
a manifold of non-constant invariant solutions: these solutions describe the synchronized
state of the oscillators that have a tendency to be close to θ0 . The function q : S → (0, ∞)
is explicitly known and one can show that M is stable. In fact it has been shown that
M is stable in the sense that it is a stable normally hyperbolic manifold for the δ = 0
evolution (See Section 2.1). A deep result in dynamical systems theory guarantees the
robustness of normal hyperbolicity under suitable perturbations [8], see also [2, 24]: this
means that, if δ > 0 is not too large, there exists an invariant manifold Mδ which is stable
and normally hyperbolic for the evolution (1.2), and Mδ is a smooth deformation of M .
In particular, for small enough δ, Mδ is still a one dimensional manifold diffeomorphic to
a circle, and the phase along this manifold plays the role of the natural phase ψ ∈ S of
the IDS ψ̇ = −V ′ (ψ). This makes clearly a direct link between the (one dimensional) IDS
and the N = ∞ system (1.1), which is an infinite dimensional dynamical system.
The type of results that we obtain is well exemplified in the most basic of the active
rotator models, namely the one in which we take V (ψ) = ψ − a cos(ψ) (without loss of
generality: a ≥ 0): note that, for a < 1, the IDS describes just a rotation on the circle,
1
while for a > 1 the IDS has a stable point (ψ = − arcsin
 a ), to which it is driven, unless
1
sitting on the unstable stationary point ψ = arcsin a + π. Let us keep in mind that Mδ
is close to M , which is a circle, so that also the dynamics on Mδ can be reduced to the
dynamics of a phase (see Fig. 1). We are going to show in particular that
(1) there exists (in fact, we give it explicitly) a0 > 1 such that for a ∈ (1, a0 ) (so the
IDS has a stable stationary point!) there exist K− , K+ > 1, with K− < K+ such
that for K ∈ (K− , K+ ), and δ > 0 sufficiently small (1.2) has a stable periodic
solution – a pulsating wave – which corresponds to the fact that the dynamics on
Mδ is periodic. For K ∈ (1, K− ) or K > K+ instead the dynamics on the manifold
Mδ has (only) one stable stationary point, so (1.2) has a stable stationary solution
(like the IDS).
(2) for every a ∈ (0, 1), that is the IDS is rotating, one can find K0 > 1 (sufficiently
close to 1) such that whenever K ∈ (1, K0 ) for δ sufficiently small the dynamics
on Mδ has (only) one stable stationary point.

Actually, these examples are just instances of results that we will establish for general
potentials V . For example we will show that for any V such that V ′ changes sign (so
the IDS has a stable point), for K large enough, the dynamics on the invariant curve
stabilizes at an equilibrium for small δ. Or that for any V such that V ′ > 0 (so the IDS
is rotating), but with nonzero first harmonic coefficient(s), for K close to 1 the dynamics
on the invariant curve stabilizes at an equilibrium for small δ.
Finally, regarding the inverse problem, that is the range of possible dynamics, we show
that given a noise and a coupling strength such that the δ = 0 system exhibits synchronization, any (phase) dynamics can be produced on Mδ , for δ sufficiently small, by a suitable
choice of the IDS dynamics (that is, of V ) and the relation between these two dynamics
is explicit.

Figure 1. For δ sufficiently small the solutions of (1.2) with an initial condition in a
L2 -neighborhood of M (in the figure on the left M is drawn by a dashed line), that is an
initial condition close to a qψ (·) = q(· + ψ), stay close to M for all times. In fact, they
are attracted by a manifold Mδ (solid line, still on the left) that is a small (and smooth)
deformation of M . For every function qψ (·) in M one associates only one function p(·)
on Mδ . While the image on the right stresses the function viewpoint, the one on the left
stresses the geometric viewpoint: M is a circle and it is hence parametrized just by one
parameter (the phase ψ), but Mδ can also be reduced simply to ψ. The dynamics on the
two manifolds is hence reduced to the dynamics of ψ, with the substantial difference that
even if the dynamics for δ = 0 is trivial in the sense that M is a manifold of stationary
solutions of (1.2) with δ = 0, for δ > 0 the dynamics on Mδ can be non-trivial. As a
matter of fact, we are going to show that by playing on the choice of V (·) essentially any
phase dynamics can be observed on Mδ , and this for every K and σ such that K > σ 2 .

where J(θ) := −K sin(θ). Note that we have set σ = 1: there is of course no loss of
generality in doing this. We start by introducing the weighted H−1 spaces that are going
to play an important role in the sequel.

Basic features and the stationary solutions of the reversible Kuramoto PDE. The reversible
Kuramoto PDE has a number of features that we recall here. First of all, the reversible
Kuramoto PDE has strong regularizing properties [7], so that we can safely talk about
classical smooth solutions for all positive times, for example whenever the initial condition
is in L2 . In particular, (2.1) defines an L2 -semigroup. Actually, the conservative character
of the dynamics and the fact that we are dealing with probability distributions naturally
lead to work on the affine space
Z
2
2
L1 := {f ∈ L :
f = 1} ,
(2.4)
with the L2 distance. One of the main feature of (2.1), directly inherited from being the
limit of a reversible stochastic dynamics, is that it is the gradient flow of a free energy
(which is therefore a Lyapunov functional for the evolution). These properties underlie
what follows but we do not directly use them, and so we refer to [3], see also [7] for related
results.
What plays a direct role in our analysis is the fact that all the stationary solutions of
(2.1) can be written as
1
exp(2Kr cos(· − ψ)) ,
(2.5)
Z
where ψ ∈ S (this accounts for the rotation invariance of (2.1)), Z is the normalization
constant (fixed by the requirement of working with probability densities) and r ≥ 0 is a
solution of the fixed point problem
R
cos(θ) exp(x cos(θ)) dθ
.
(2.6)
r = Ψ(2Kr)
with Ψ(x) := S R
S exp(x cos(θ)) dθ

1
Ψ(0) = 0, so that r = 0 is a solution of the fixed point problem and 2π
is a stationary
solution. Moreover Ψ(·) is increasing and concave on the positive semi-axis, so that there
exists at most one positive fixed point r and such a fixed point exists if and only if
K > Kc = 1 (see [3] and references therein). So for K > 1 (that we assume from now on)
there is a manifold, in fact a curve, of stationary solution, besides the constant solution:

M := {qψ (·) = q0 (· − ψ) : ψ ∈ S}

with q0 (θ) := R

exp (2Kr cos(θ))
,
S exp (2Kr cos(θ)) dθ

(2.7)

where r = r(K) is the positive fixed point of (2.6). We will come back to the manifold
structure of M , but we point out that the main result in [3] means that M is a stable
normally hyperbolic manifold ([24, p. 494]: we are going to detail this just below): we
stress that M is actually a manifold of stationary solutions and not only an invariant
manifold. The key point is that if p0t = q ∈ M the linearized evolution operator
− Lq u :=

1 ′′
u − [uJ ∗ q + qJ ∗ u]′ ,
2

(2.8)

R
with domain {u ∈ C 2 (S, R) : S u = 0} is symmetric in H−1,1/q and its closure, that we
still call Lq , is a self-adjoint operator operator with compact resolvent, hence the spectrum
is discrete. Actually the spectrum is in [0, ∞): Lq q ′ = 0 and q ′ generates the whole kernel
of Lq : the spectral gap is therefore positive and it will be denoted λK (see [3] for a proof
of all these facts and for an explicit lower bound on λK ).

8

In such a framework it is useful to take advantage of some of the interpolation spaces
associated to Lq . For us the (Hilbert) spaces Vq and Vq2 with norms

kvkVq :=  1 + Lq v

where here (and below) cK denotes a suitable positive constant that depends only on K
(it will not keep the same value through the text: in particular, in this case it is the same
for every q ∈ M ). Note that if v ∈ R(Lq ), R(·) denotes the range of ·, the spectral gap

At this point it is also worth observing also that, by (2.2), there exists cK > 0 such that

K kvk−1,1/qψ .

Of course, we have the analogous estimates in the case in which 1/qψ2 , or 1/qψ1 , is replaced
by 1.
Stable normally hyperbolic manifolds. We now quickly review the notion of stable normally
hyperbolic manifold, in the L21 set-up, because it will play a central role in our results. For
this we need a dynamics: what we have in mind is (2.20) but for the moment let us just
think of an evolution semigroup in L21 that gives rise to {ut }t≥0 , with u0 = u, to which
we can associate a linear evolution semigroup {Φ(u, t)}t≥0 in L20 , satisfying ∂t Φ(u, t)v =
A(t)Φ(u, t)v and Φ(u, 0)v = v, where A(t) is the operator obtained by linearizing the
evolution around ut .
For us a stable normally hyperbolic manifold M ⊂ L21 (in reality we are interested only
in 1-dimensional manifolds, that is curves, but at this stage this does not really play a role)
of characteristics λ1 , λ2 (0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 ) and C > 0 is a C 1 compact connected manifold
which is invariant under the dynamics and for every u ∈ M there exists a projection P o (u)
on the tangent space of M at u, that is R(P o (u)) =: Tu M , which, for v ∈ L20 , satisfies the
properties
(1) for every t ≥ 0 we have
Φ(u, t)P o (u0 )v = P o (ut )Φ(u, t)v ,

(2.13)

kΦ(u, t)P o (u0 )vk2 ≤ C exp(λ1 t)kvk2 ,

(2.14)

kΦ(u, t)P s (u0 )vk2 ≤ C exp(−λ2 t)kvk2 ,

(2.15)

(2) we have
and, for P s := 1 − P o , we have

for every t ≥ 0;
(3) there exists a negative continuation of the dynamics {ut }t≤0 and of the linearized
semigroup {Φ(u, t)P o (u0 )v}t≤0 and for any such continuation we have
kΦ(u, t)P o (u0 )vk2 ≤ C exp(−λ1 t)kvk2 ,

for t ≤ 0.

As an example – for us a crucial example – let us show that M is a stable normally
hyperbolic manifold for the L21 -semigroup associated to (2.1) (in Section 2.2 we give some
details on this semigroup in the general case). As we have seen, M is an invariant manifold:
it is in fact a set of stationary solutions, so that the dynamics has a (trivial) negative
continuation, and it is easy to provide an explicit atlas, compatible with the L2 topology,
for which M is a C ∞ manifold and Tq M0 = {aq ′ : a ∈ R} = R(Pqo ). The projection P o
we choose is defined by
(v, q ′ )−1,1/q q ′
P o (q)v = Pqo v :=
,
(2.17)
(q ′ , q ′ )−1,1/q
and, since Lq q ′ = 0 for every q ∈ M , we see that λ1 can be chosen equal to zero and any
value C ≥ 1 will do. Moreover if we set vt := Φ(q, t)Pqs v ∈ R(Pqs ) then
p

where we have used (2.12), then (2.11), then the spectral gap and finally (2.10). Therefore
λ2 can be chosen equal to λK , C ≥ c′K , and therefore M is a stable normally hyperbolic
manifold in L2 for the reversible Kuramoto evolution, with characteristics 0, λK and
C = max(c′K , 1).

For the sequel we observe also that u 7→ Puo , a map from M to the bounded linear
operators on L20 , is C ∞ as it can be easily verified by using for v ∈ L20 the formula

where δ ≥ 0 and for G we assume
(1) p 7→ G[p] is a function from L21 to H−1 ;
(2) there exists η > 0 such that G is C 1 (L21 , H−1 ) for every p at L2 distance at most
η of M and the derivative DG is uniformly bounded (in the η-neighborhood of M
that we consider).
Note that p 7→ (pJ ∗ p)′ is also in C 1 (L21 , H−1 ), in fact even in C ∞ , so that the evolution
equation can be cast in the abstract form ∂pδt = Apδt + F [pδt ] + δG[pδt ]. A complete theory
of this type of equations can be found in [24, Ch. 4], in particular for pδ0 ∈ L21 such that
dL2 (pδ0 , M ) < η there exists of a unique mild solution in C 0 ([0, T ), L20 ), for some T > 0.
Examples include:
(1) the AR case, that is (1.2), with G[p](θ) = ∂θ [p(θ)U (θ)] and kU k∞ < ∞;
(2) the case of
G[p](θ) = ∂θ [p(θ)Je ∗ p(θ)]
with Je ∈ L∞ ;

In all these examples actually one can prove global well-posedness for arbitrary initial
condition in L21 . But the key point of our analysis is that if the initial condition is sufficiently close to M , then for δ smaller than a suitable constant, the solution will stay in a
neighborhood of M for all times. More precisely, our approach is based on the following
result, that is essentially contained in [24, Main Theorem, p. 495]. We say essentially
because the result we need is more explicit for what concerns the various small constants
that are involved: in Section 5 we detail this issue.
Theorem 2.1. There exists δ0 > 0 such that if δ ∈ [0, δ0 ] there exists a stable normally
hyperbolic manifold Mδ in L21 for the perturbed equation (2.20). Moreover we can write
Mδ = {qψ + φδ (qψ ) : ψ ∈ S} ,

(2.23)

for a suitable function φδ ∈ C 1 (M, L20 ) with the properties that
• φδ (q) ∈ R(Lq );
• there exists C > 0 such that supψ (kφδ (qψ ) k2 + k∂ψ φδ (qψ )k2 ) ≤ Cδ.
We are now interested in the dynamics on Mδ , which is a curve and, given the mapping
φδ , the position on the manifold is identified by the phase ψtδ . A more detailed description
demands information on nδt := φδ (qψtδ ): of course ψt0 = ψ00 and n0t ≡ 0 for every t.
We have the following:
Theorem 2.2. For δ ∈ [0, δ0 ] we have that t 7→ ψtδ is C 1 and

A sharper control on the dynamics on Mδ can be obtained, under a slightly stronger
assumption on the perturbation G: it all boils down to go beyond (2.24) and for this note
that the left-hand side can be written as Rδ (ψtδ ) where

3. Dynamics on Mδ : analysis of the active rotators case
Let us use the results of the previous section to tackle the questions we have raised in
the introduction for the active rotators case and that, ultimately, boil down to: what is the
relation between the Isolated Deterministic one dimensional System ψ̇ = −V ′ (ψ) (IDS)
and the behavior of the associated N dimensional diffusion, for N large? So we focus on
(2.20) with G[p] = (pV ′ )′ and regularity assumptions on V ′ are going to appear along the
way. Theorem 2.1 tells us that if kV ′ k∞ < ∞, at least when δ is small enough, the N → ∞
limit system – ruled by (2.20) – is described by a dynamics on a one dimensional smooth
and compact manifold Mδ equivalent to a circle and, via Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3,
we have a sharp control on this dynamics.
In order to be precise on this issue let us speed up time by 1/δ in (2.24). If we keep
just the leading terms we are dealing with the dynamics
where f is

ψ̇ = −f (ψ) ,

f (ψ) :=

.

(3.2)

We say that f ∈ C 1 (S, R) – not necessarily the f in (3.2) – is generic, or hyperbolic,
if it has a finite number of zeroes on S and all of them are simple, i.e. for all ψ for
which f (ψ) = 0, we have f ′ (ψ) 6= 0. Notice that the set of generic functions is open
in C 1 (S, R) and dense: if the C 1 distance of f and g is less than (a constant times) ǫ,
we say that the dynamics generated by f and g are ǫ-close. Note that if ǫ is sufficiently
small then the two dynamics are topologically equivalent. By this we mean that there
exists a homeomorphism h : S → S such that {h(ψ(ψ0 , t)) : t ∈ R}, where ψ(ψ0 , ·) solves
ψ̇ = −f (ψ) and ψ(ψ0 , 0) = ψ0 , coincides with {(φ(h(ψ0 ), t) : t ∈ R}, where φ(φ0 , ·)
solves φ̇ = −g(φ) and φ(φ0 , 0) = φ0 . Moreover we require that h(·) preserves the time
orientation, that is for a > 0 sufficiently small and t, |s| ∈ (0, a] we have that ψ(ψ0 , t) 6= ψ0
and h(ψ(ψ0 , t)) = φ(h(ψ0 ), s) imply s > 0.
Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 guarantee therefore that for δ sufficiently small the phase
dynamics on the Mδ manifold speeded up by δ−1

is δ-close to the dynamics generated by f (·).
The layout of the remainder of this section is, first, to show that even if we fix K > 1, by
playing on the choice of V ′ (·), one can generate arbitrary generic phase dynamics on Mδ .
In this part we will make also more explicit the link between V ′ and f . Afterwards, we will
work out in detail a few particular cases and expose some a priori surprising behaviors,
notably that IDS with periodic behavior (active state) may lead to a N → ∞ dynamics
that settles down to a fixed point (quiescent state) or that IDS without periodic behavior
may give origin to periodic N → ∞ behaviors.

Theorem 3.1. For any generic dynamics on the circle ψ̇t = −f (ψt ) with f ∈ C 1 (S; R)
and for any value of K > 1 there exists a trigonometric polynomial V ′ (·) (see Remark 3.2
for an explicit expression) such that for δ small enough, the phase dynamics on Mδ (3.3)
is δ-close to ψ̇ = −f ′ (ψ).
Proof. Let f be a generic function in C 1 . By the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, for every
ε > 0 there exists a trigonometric polynomial P (·) such that kf ′ − P k∞ ≤ ε. If c0 is such
R 2π
R 2π
that 0 (P − c0 ) = 0 then, since 0 f ′ = 0, |c0 | ≤ ε. Thus if we define the trigonometric
Rψ
polynomial Q(ψ) := f (0) + 0 (P (θ) − c0 ) dθ we have
kQ − f kC1 = kQ − f k∞ + kP − c0 − f ′ k∞ ≤ (2π + 1)kP − c0 − f ′ k∞ ≤ (4π + 2)ε , (3.5)

so it suffices to consider functions f which are trigonometric polynomials:

f (θ) = A0 +

and (3.11) can be applied also in the case in which f is not a trigonometric polynomial. It
tells us that, for δ small, the effective force that drives the N → ∞ system is, in a sense,
obtained by smearing V ′ via the probability kernel q0 . To be precise, V ′ − a0 is smeared
and multiplied by D(K), while the 0th order Fourier coefficient is left unchanged. This is
telling us that the effect of noise and interaction, to leading order, boil down to the size of
D(K) and to the smearing effect of the probability kernel q0 (·) (that depends on K too!).
While (3.11) is quite explicit, it is not always straightforward to read off it the qualitative
properties of f . We start by analyzing the case of K very large and the case of K close to
one, before moving to treating in detail some particular cases.
The K → ∞ limit. It is straightforward to see that the probability density q0 (·) converges to the Dirac delta measure at the origin. Moreover limK→∞ D(K) = 1, since
limK→∞ r(K) = 1 and limx→∞ I0 (x) = ∞. Therefore f and V ′ get closer and closer as
K becomes large. More precisely one has that for every s ∈ N and every trigonometric
polynomial V ′ (·) there is C such that
C
(3.13)
kf − V ′ kC s ≤ √ .
K
The proof can be obtained for example by using (3.9) that, with (3.12), tells us that Aj /aj ,
as well as Bj /bj , that is the ratio of the (non-vanishing) sine and cosine Fourier coefficients
of f and V ′ , is

(j = 1, 2, . . .) and limK→∞ D(K) = 1 we
so that by using (Ij (x)/I0 (x)) − 1 ∼ 2x
th
readily obtain that the j -Fourier coefficients of f (·) are, to leading order, j 2 aj /(4K) and
j 2 bj /(4K). Since we are just dealing with trigonometric polynomials and the estimate of
the L2 norm of arbitrary derivatives of f − V ′ , via Parseval formula, is straightforward,
we get to (3.13). This means in particular that given a potential V such that V ′ has sign
changes (so that the IDS has stable points), for any K large enough, the N → ∞ system
has stable stationary solutions, for δ small enough. We will encounter this phenomenon
in the particular cases that we treat below.

The K ց 1 limit. This time we use r(K) ∼

that D(K) ∼ (4(K − 1))−1 , since I0 (x) − 1 ∼ x2 /4. Once again we analyze the Fourier

Notably, the first Fourier coefficients of f are enhanced with respect to the corresponding
coefficients of V ′ by a factor that diverges like (K − 1)−1/2 . The second Fourier coefficients
of f are (asymptotically) just proportional to the ones of V ′ , while higher coefficients in
the K ց 1 limit are depressed passing from IDS to N → ∞ behavior (recall that the
0th -order coefficient is unchanged). A quantitative estimate in the spirit of (3.13) is easily
established from these estimates.

14

G. GIACOMIN, K. PAKDAMAN, X. PELLEGRIN, C. POQUET

What we retain from this K ց 1 analysis is that if the first Fourier coefficients are
present, that is |a1 | + |b1 | > 0, then for K sufficiently close to one f (ψ) = 0 has two
solutions and the dynamics will eventually settle to a fixed point (quiescent state). If
instead |a1 | + |b1 | = 0, then it depends on the relative size of a0 and a2 or b2 whether the
system is in an activated or quiescent regime. But if also a2 = b2 = 0 (and a0 6= 0) then
for K sufficiently close to one we have that f (ψ) is close to a0 and therefore f (ψ) 6= 0 for
all ψ, so that the dynamics is periodic. Again, we will discuss in more detail these issues
below, in specific examples.
Remark 3.3. The analysis for K large and close to one is helpful to get an idea on the
relation between f and V ′ , but the reader should keep in mind that the δ-closeness of the
dynamics holds for fixed K, that is for δ < δ0 (K). Quantitative estimates on how δ0 (K)
behaves for extreme values of K is an interesting issue that we do not approach here.
3.2. Active rotators with V (θ) = θ − a cos(θ). Without loss of generality we assume
a ≥ 0. Let us start the analysis by making a remark on the a = 0 case: the potential
becomes just a straight line, and (2.20) reads
h
i
1
(3.17)
∂t pδt (θ) = ∂θ2 pδt (θ) − ∂θ pδt (θ)(J ∗ pδt )(θ) − δpδt (θ) .
2
In this case pδt (θ − δt) solves (2.1), thus Mδ = M and the dynamics on Mδ is a rotation
for all δ.
If a > 0 we exploit the analysis we have developed for Theorem 3.1 that tells us that
the N → ∞ phase dynamics is lead by the effective force

Therefore if a < ac (K), then the dynamic on Mδ is periodic for δ small enough ( depending
on K ) and if a > ac (K), there are two fixed points. From this observation and the graph
of ac (·) (see Figure 2) we draw the following conclusions (see also Figure 3):
• Set âc := maxK ac (K)(> 1). If a > âc then for every K we have that f (θ) = 0 has
two solutions, so that the phase dynamics has two stationary hyperbolic point: one
is stable and the other is unstable. In this case the dynamics of the IDS resembles
to the phase dynamics of the N → ∞ system.
• If a ∈ (1, âc ) then ac (K) = a has two solutions K− (a) < K+ (a) and for K ∈
(K− (a), K+ (a)) we have a < ac (K), that is f (θ) < 0 for every θ, and the motion
is periodic: in this case the dynamics of the IDS, that has two fixed points, differs
from the N → ∞ phase dynamics. For K > K+ (a) and for K < K− (a) instead
the phase dynamics is driven to a (unique) stable fixed point (unless it starts from
the unstable fixed point).
• If a ≤ 1 instead ac (K) = a has only one solution K(a) and the periodic behavior
sets up for K > K(a), otherwise (K < K(a)) the system eventually settles on a
fixed point: this second case is another instance in which the dynamics of the IDS
and the N → ∞ system differ.
When the phase dynamics is periodic we can explicitly integrate the evolution equation
(3.1) and compute the first order approximation the period Tδ (a, K) of the dynamics on
Mδ :

Actually, it is possible to replace in this formula O(1) with O(δ): in fact it is possible to
show by induction that the phase speed on Mδ admits an expansion in (integer) powers of
δ to any order (but with coefficients less explicit than the first order one), and it is easy
to see that ψ̇δ is an odd function of δ. We have tested numerically this approximation and
we report the result in Table 1.

the text). Moreover, for j = 2 and a > 4 the dynamics has just two fixed points, but for
j ≥ 3 for arbitrarily large values of a one can observe periodic motion if K is sufficiently
close to 1 (and, of course, δ sufficiently small).

Remark 3.4. Theorem 3.1 already tells us that one can produce arbitrary dynamics,
so a very large variety of phenomena is observed. Here is a case that can be of some
interest since it shows that playing on only one parameter one can produce three different
dynamics (and the reader will directly infer how to induce arbitrarily many): if V (θ) =
θ − a(cos(θ) + cos(2θ)) the N → ∞ phase dynamics is lead by
f (ψ) = 1 + a

(3.22)

and in this case there can be two transitions as a varies. For example for K = 2 we have
periodic behavior for a < 0.600 . . ., two fixed points if a ∈ (0.600 . . . , 2.107 . . .) and four
fixed points (of course two stable and two unstable ones) if a > 2.107 . . ..
4. Perturbation arguments
In this section we assume that δ ∈ (0, δ0 ] (cf. Theorem 2.1) and that we are on the
invariant manifold Mδ of (2.20), that is pδt ∈ Mδ for every t. The result [24, Main Theorem,
p. 495] actually contains also some estimates on the regularity of the semigroup on Mδ and
e 1 ) and that it is (strongly) differentiable as a map
notably that t 7→ pδt belongs to C 0 (R; H
e −1 . One directly sees that ku − vkH = ku′′ − v ′′ k−1 , so that the right-hand

side in (2.20) is C 0 (R; H−1 ) and, in turn, t 7→ pδt is C 1 (R, H

Since we are working in a neighborhood of M it is useful to introduce from now a
parametrization of this region that will be particularly useful in the next section, but that
we are going to use from now. The following facts are proven in Lemma 5.1: for every u
in a sufficiently small H−1 neighborhood of M there exists a unique q = v(u) ∈ M such
that

5. On the persistence of normally hyperbolic manifolds
In this section we prove theorem 2.1. The proof in a more general case can be found in
[24] but we pay more attention on the relation between the various small parameters that
enter the proof. We first give a lemma which defines a parametrisation in a neighbourhood
of M using the scalar structure given by the operators Lq . The proof of this lemma is in
[24, p. 501].
Lemma 5.1. There exists a σ > 0 such that for all p in the neighborhood
Nσ := ∪q∈M BL2 (q, σ) ,

of M there is one and only one q = v(p) ∈ M such that
the mapping p 7→ v(p) is in C ∞ (L21 , L21 ), and

(p − q, q ′ )−1,1/q

(5.1)
= 0. Furthermore

o
Dv(p) = Pv(p)
.

(5.2)

Moreover, the analogous statement holds if Nσ is replaced by ∪q∈M BH−1 (q, σ) and this
e −1 , H
e −1 ).
time p 7→ v(p) is in C ∞ (H

For the proof we look for conditions on δ in order to get a manifold, which is invariant
for for (2.20), at distance ε from M : the condition in the end is going to be that δ needs
to be smaller than a suitable constant times ε (and ε sufficiently small too), so that the
invariant manifold is in a neighborhood of order δ of M . To simplify notations, we will
write F [u] = ∂θ (uJ ∗ u), and (2.20) becomes:
1
(5.3)
∂t pt = ∂θ2 pt − F [pt ] + δG[pt ] .
2
We will consider solutions with initial condition p0 satisfying kp0 − v(p0 )k2 6 ε. We need
asumptions on ε and δ such that the solution stays in Nσ for a sufficiently long time. If q
is in M , wt := pt − q satisfies

∆p := p1 − p2 ,

∆v := v1 − v2 ,

∆n := n1 − n2 .

In the following lemma we compare the quantites we have just introduced with the initial
conditions. It corresponds to Lemma 74.7 (page 507) in [24]. We remark that is in this
lemma ε and δ play the same role and we stress that these are just preliminary estimates:
some of them are going to be refined later on.
Lemma 5.3. For all α > 0, there exist C0 = C0 (T ) and ε1 6 ε0 such that if ε 6 ε1 and
δ 6 ε1 we have the following properties:

Proof of Lemma 5.3 For what concerns part (1) note that the first of the three inequalities
in (5.25) is given above (see (5.15) with t0 = 2T ). The other inequalities come from the
fact that the mapping q 7→ v(q) of Lemma 5.1 is Lipschitz, taking, if necessary, a bigger
value for C0 .
For part (2)notice that, since v20 ∈ M , we can write the evolution in mild form around

We now move to the main body of the proof which is based on introducing a family of
transformations of the manifold M by using the full dynamics and we aim at identifying
the transformation that maps M to the manifold that is stable for the full dynamics
and this is achieved by applying the Banach fixed point Theorem in a relevant space of
functions.
Define the set C(M, L20 ) of continuous functions from M to L20 provided with the norm
kf k∞ = sup{kf (v)kL2 , v ∈ M }

(5.45)

and consider the subset F(ε, l) of C(M, L20 ) of functions f satisfying :

Notice that F(ε, l) is a complete subset of C(M, L20 ). We will now define a set of mappings

Notice that the third point of (5.3) and an argument of connexion ( see [24] page 513 )
show that for all f ∈ F(ε, 1) and t ∈ [0, 2T ], the mapping q 7→ gt,f (q) := v(t, f (q)) is a
bijection of M . So we can define the mappings

satisfying for all q ∈ M

(5.49)

where p0 = q + f (q). We can see Xt (f ) as the distance (in the sense of (5.1)) of the
trajectory pt from M , starting at the time 0 at a distance f from M .
In the following, we will first prove that (5.46) and (5.47) imply that there exists an
invariant manifold Mε for (5.3) at distance ε of M . Then we will prove (5.46) and (5.47)
in three lemmas, paying attention on the relations between the different parameters.
Suppose that the mappings Xτ satisfy (5.46) for τ ∈, [T, 2T ] and that XT satisfies (5.47).
Then XT has a unique fixed point in F(ε, 1), which will be noted f0 . Define φε = id + f0
on M and Mε = φ0 (M ). Since f0 is a fixed point of XT , if p0 ∈ M0 , then pkT ∈ M0 for
all k ∈ N. Then to prove that Mε is an invariant manifold of (5.3), it is sufficient to prove
that for all t ∈ (0, T ), the functions ft defined by ft = Xt (f0 ) are equal to f0 . Using the
property of semi-group and XT (f0 ) = f0 it is easy to see that ft = XT +t (f0 ), and thus
(5.46) implies that ft ∈ F(ε, 1). But the same arguments show that ft is a fixed point of
XT for all t ∈ (0, T ). In conclusion, Mε is invariant for (5.3).

Now we prove (5.46) and (5.47) in the three following lemmas, which correspond to
Lemmas 74.8, 74.9 and 74.10 in [24].
Lemma 5.4. There exists a ε3 6 ε1 such that if ε 6 ε3 , there exists a δ3 (ε) of the form
min(Cε, ε3 ) such that if δ 6 δ3 (ε), we have for all τ ∈ [T, 2T ] and f ∈ F(ε, 1)

We bound the first term using the spectral gap of Lv20 , the second term using the smoothness of P s and Lemma 5.3, and the third term in a similar way as (5.43). We use a Taylor

using the part (3) of Lemma 5.3 we deduce

Proof of Theorem 2.1. In these three lemmas, we see that if ε is small enough, we can take
δ proportional to ε, thus adding a perturbation of type δG[pt ] to (2.1) creates an invariant
manifold Mδ situated at a distance O(δ) from M . It is proven in [24, (theorem 74.15,
p. 531)] that the manifold Mδ is C 1 in L21 and normally hyperbolic. Remark furthermore
−1
that φδ
(p) = v(p) for all p ∈ Mδ . So to prove that φδ is C 1 , it suffices to prove
that v satisfies the hypothesis of the local inverse theorem between manifolds, that is Dv
is a bijection between the tangent spaces of de two manifolds. Since the manifold is of
dimension one, this property is implied by the lipschitz property of φδ . Furthermore we
can estimate the differential of φδ : (5.60) for φδ gives an inequality for the local Lipschitz
constant lδ of φδ on all neighborhoods M ∪ B2 (q, ρ0 ) (ρ0 is introduced right before (5.56)):

and we get that for a C8 > 0

which yields the bound we claim on the differential of φδ .

and

with C > 0. Remark that by changing the constant C we get an equivalent norm. Since
the norms k · k−1,1/q and k · k−1 are equivalent, we will study k(C + Lq )uk−1 . We write
X
u(θ) =

J ∗ q is of the type αeiθ − αe−iθ , thus we can write

Suppose now that u ∈ H1 . It is easy to see that there exists c > 0 such that kukVq2 6 ckukH1 .

Thus
n |an |2 < ∞ implies that k(C + Lq )uk−1 < ∞ and so H1 ⊂ Vq2 . By expanding

But H1 is dense in

there exists a

sequence vn in H1 such that vn → v for the Vq norm. Then vn is a Cauchy sequence for
the H1 norm, and since H1 is complete, v ∈ H1 . In conclusion Vq2 and H1 have the same
elements.
Remark A.1. By replacing (1 + n2 )−1 by (1 + n2 )k , we can prove in the same way that
k(C + Lq )ukHk is equivalent to kukHk+2 . Thus kukVqn = k(1 + Lq )n/2 uk−1,1/q is equivalent
to kukHn−1 .
