Abstract
Although, several factors have been attributed to thermostability, the stabilization strategies used
by proteins are still enigmatic. Studies on recombinant xylanase which has the ubiquitous (β/α)8
TIM (Triosephosphate isomerase) barrel fold showed that, just a single extreme N-terminus
mutation (V1L) markedly enhanced the thermostability by 5 °C without loss of catalytic activity
whereas another mutation, V1A at the same position decreased the stability by 2 °C. Based on
computational analysis of their crystal structures including residue interaction network, we
established a link between N- to C-terminal contacts and protein stability. We demonstrate that
augmenting of N- to C-terminal non-covalent interactions is associated with the enhancement of
protein stability. We propose that the strategy of mutations at the termini could be exploited with
a view to modulate stability without compromising on enzymatic activity, or in general, protein
function, in diverse folds where N- and C-termini are in close proximity. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our results for the development of therapeutics involving proteins and for
designing effective protein engineering strategies.

Introduction
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of protein stability at high temperature continues to
attract and fascinate researchers over a broad range of disciplines and has still remained a
challenging puzzle. A number of approaches have been employed to develop stable proteins for
biotechnological applications1, 2. Site directed mutagenesis is an attractive approach to provide
valuable insights into the structural features that govern protein thermostability. Locating the
target site of mutagenesis for stability-improvement can reduce the screening effort required to
find stable mutant(s) by orders of magnitude as compared to random directed evolution
methods3.
Enzyme stability and activity often appear to trade off at the level of individual mutations.
For example, while flexibility is required for the catalytic activity of most enzymes, higher
thermostability necessitates an increase in the rigidity of the structure. As a result, mutants with
increased stability often lose catalytic efficiency4. In addition, engineering protein
thermostability at the expense of losing enzymatic activity is not a biotechnologically desirable
outcome. Generally, industrial processes are performed at high temperature. Therefore,
improving the stability of an already stable enzyme could be advantageous for industrial
applications. Besides, even a modest increase of stability could lead to >10-fold longer
lifetime5,6.
The N and C terminal regions are often overlooked from the point of view of enhancing
protein stability. This may be because the terminal regions of a protein structure are more
flexible as compared to interior regions. Further, in a majority of cases, the terminal residues are
exposed to solvent with low number of nearest neighbors-residues and hence considered to have
little influence on thermostability7. Nevertheless, certain experimental and computational studies

3

suggest the importance of protein termini on their structure-stability and functions8, 9. An in silico
analysis of a set of two-state folding proteins revealed the presence of N-C motif (N- to Cterminal contacts) and suggested its possible role in initial protein folding and native state
stability10. However, there is hardly any available experimental evidence, which clearly brings
out in a focused manner the role and importance of interactions between termini in protein
stability and how changes in the terminal regions influence stability.
Here, we investigate how, just a single mutation at the extreme N-terminus affects the
structure and interactions to change the thermal stability of a biotechnologically important
enzyme xylanase, having the ubiquitous TIM (Triosephosphate isomerase) barrel fold. Based on
computational analysis including residue interaction network of crystal structure of recombinant
xylanase (RBSX) and its mutants, we established the link between protein stability and N- to Cterminal non-covalent interactions. We demonstrated that augmenting of N-to C-terminal noncovalent interactions is associated with the enhancement of stability of protein in fold-specific
manner where N- and C-terminus are in close proximity. We observed that even though the
mutation was at the extreme N-terminus of the protein, changes are not confined to the terminal
regions and they occur throughout the protein including the terminal regions. We show that the
cumulative effect of a network of non-covalent interactions which include N-to C-terminal
interactions, modulate the thermal stability of the protein. We propose that the mutagenesis at the
termini could be exploited with a view to enhance stability without compromising enzymatic
activity or protein function. This may be effective especially in situations where the N- and Ctermini come close in three-dimensional (3D) space, thereby enabling long-range interactions
(interactions between distantly separated residues in primary sequence), as demonstrated with the
example of the TIM barrel fold, and the same can be extrapolated to diverse folds in both

4

globular and membrane proteins. Further, the work may elucidate the underlying mechanism
dictating the evolution of functional repertoire of the TIM barrel fold. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our results for development of therapeutics involving proteins or for designing
effective protein engineering strategies.

Results
Structure based rationalization of protein stability. BSX, an extra-cellular endo-xylanase is a
monomeric (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold enzyme composed of 354 amino acid residues11 (Fig. 1). The
TIM barrel fold is a common tertiary fold, occurring in many glycosyl hydrolases and is present
in approximately 10% of all enzymes12. Biophysical/biochemical analysis of different extreme
N-terminus mutants of recombinant BSX (RBSX) in our group showed that, a single amino acid
substitution, V1→L (V1L) markedly enhanced the thermostability of RBSX from 70 °C to 75 °C
without compromising its catalytic activity and showed higher cooperativity in the thermal
unfolding transition13. On the other hand, substitution of V1→A (V1A) at the same position
decreased the stability of the protein from 70 °C to 68 °C13. To understand the structural reasons
as to how a seemingly unimportant mutation modulates BSX thermal stability, we solved the
structure of RBSX and its mutants (V1L and V1A). A brief summary of crystallization, data
collections, structure solutions, and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Crystal structure
comparison of mutants with RBSX shows no significant changes in the overall 3D structure of
proteins despite their difference in thermal stabilities. The overall Cα root mean square deviation
(RMSD) between RBSX and V1L is 0.393 Å whereas that between RBSX and V1A is 0.265 Å.
So the question arises, what may be the mechanism of thermal stabilization/destabilization,
considering there is only a minimal change in their overall 3D structures? The location of the

5

mutation lies on an extended loop in the extreme N-terminus region and no dominant interaction
exclusively made by this first residue (L1 in V1L and V1 in RBSX) is observed. This
observation raises the possibility about the effects of non-covalent interactions network that
transmits changes near and far from the site of mutation and changes the overall stability of
RBSX. In a folded protein, a network of interactions brings the distal residues in a sequence
space to close approach in 3D space. This extensive network of interactions gives proteins,
structural flexibility, integrity, and thermal-stability14-16. Therefore, we focused on residue
contacts and residue interaction network (RIN) in the protein structures to capture this
cumulative nature of thermo stabilization/ destabilization and to identify the changes in both
local and non-local interactions. The aim of the present work is not to obtain the most stable
structure by carrying out all possible mutations at the extreme N-terminus, but to gain structural
insights into the modulation of stability caused by mutations in the terminal region.
Although, there was an increase of about 5 °C in the thermostability due to a single Leucine
mutation, crystal structure analysis showed that L1 in V1L structure has similar type of
interactions (van der Waals) as V1 in RBSX structure. However, because of its greater bulk and
better conformational accessibility in comparison to V1 in RBSX, Leucine side chain forms
more van der Waals contacts with side chain atoms of R344 in the structure (Fig. 2, Table S1). It
is possible that these additional interactions help in maintaining the overall protein stability at
high temperature. Further, these additional cohesive contacts made by L1, influenced the relative
decrease of solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of R344 by 19.6% in V1L in comparison to
R344 in RBSX. The decrease of SASA of R344 is even pronounced (29.8 %) when compared
between V1L and V1A structure. On the other hand, the decreased stability of V1A structure
may be due to the significant lack of van der Waals contacts by A1 in V1A mutant in comparison

6

to V1 of RBSX (Fig. 2 and Table S1). We then looked into the contribution of non-covalent
interaction score17, 18 (which is proportional to the strength of non-covalent interactions) between
the mutated residue and R344. We found a higher non-covalent interaction score between L1 and
R344 (2.66) for V1L structure than V1 and R344 (0.063) for RBSX structure and A1 and R344
(0.00) for V1A structure.

The metrics, Cβ Contact density, and Cβ Contact order relate to protein stability. A marked
tendency of side chain atoms of L1 to be in close proximity with side chain atoms of R344 in the
folded 3D structure was observed. Despite the introduction of such a bulky amino acid residue
(L1), we found that the distance between Cβ-atoms of L1 and R344 in V1L mutant structure is
smaller (6.48 Å) than that between the corresponding residues in RBSX structure (7.12Å) and
V1A structure (7.21 Å). Thus, it may be seen that the distance between Cβ-atoms is shorter in the
more stable mutant than the less stable mutant, suggesting that metrics based on Cβ-atoms could
be used to study stability changes in the protein. To look into the extent of packing interactions
of Cβ-atoms and to assess the effect of Cβ contact networks due to mutation, we computed and
analyzed two Cβ-based structural metrics, Cβ contact density (CβCD) and Cβ contact order
(CβCO). CβCD is indicative of close packing of Cβ-atoms in the 3D space whereas CβCO values
depend on degree of long-range interactions in terms of the average magnitudes of residue
separation in the primary sequence between the pairs of contacting residues (contribution to
CβCO will be large, by pairs of residues that have large separation in the primary sequence, see
Methods). The analysis of CβCD showed that V1L has a higher value of CβCD (7.17) than RBSX
(7.14) and V1A (7.09) (Table 2). A comparison of Cβ contacts between V1L and V1A structures
reveals that there are 3167 (95.9%) common Cβ contacts between these two structures, whereas

7

76 (2.3%) contacts are unique to V1L and 59 (1.8%) are unique to V1A. We observed a
substantial difference of long-range Cβ contacts between V1L and V1A structures. Interestingly,
considerable changes are noticed in the N-to C-terminal Cβ contacts (Fig. S1).
In addition, comparison of CβCO between RBSX and its mutants reveals that CβCO correlates
well with the observed changes in RBSX thermostability. V1L has higher CβCO (26.82)
followed by RBSX (26.56) and V1A (26.33) (Table 2). CβCO can capture both local and nonlocal contacts in the 3D structure. To know the influence of each type of contacts in overall
value of CβCO, we computed CβCO using contacts that are unique to a given structure, e.g. that
are only present in one structure and absent in another structure and vice-versa to obtain a better
picture about the structural rearrangement of Cβ contacts upon mutation. Considering only those
unique contacts, we observed a much higher difference of CβCO (75.39/53.8) between V1L and
V1A structures (Table 2). This result indicates that V1L mutation affects the spatial
arrangements of Cβ contacts via both local and non-local non-covalent interactions and non-local
Cβ contacts are majorly affected. This result is further supported by the higher values of longrange CβCO (LRCβCO) for V1L than RBSX and V1A structures, evaluated at different range of
residue separations (10, 30, and 50) (Table S2). Taken together, these observations collectively
suggest that the substantial increase of V1L thermostability could be a result of better non-local
Cβ contact network that trigger a cascading effect of intra-molecular interactions network
throughout the structure.

Contacts with N-C terminal regions play a role in the protein stability. We further examined
the CβCO at a local, residue level to look at the regions contributing to CβCO by computing
residue wise Cβ contact order (RWCβCO). RWCβCO value primarily reflects the extent of long-

8

range contacts in terms of residue separation between contacting residues in a protein structure
whereas its properties are based on the residue level. It is apparent that higher values of
RWCβCO belong to the termini of the protein (Fig. S2). This should be due to the occurrence of
a number of contacts between N- and C-terminal regions, and as they are in close proximity in
their 3D structure. We then turned our attention to compute ∆RWCβCO (RWCβCOLRWCβCOA), the difference of RWCβCO value between V1L and V1A to look into the
measurable changes in the region of protein structure due to mutation and plotted along the
primary sequence. Notably, it is observed that there is a net increase of RWCβCO in the terminal
regions, although small differences are present that mostly correspond to the secondary structure
elements (Fig. 3). This is one piece of evidence that terminal regions are majorly affected in
comparison to the other parts of the protein structure due to mutation and play an important role
in the overall stability of RBSX through long-range interactions.
To assess the contribution of chain termini in RWCβCO values and relate them to RBSX
stability, we considered in more detail as to how the terminal regions differ in terms of atomatom contacts. We used a distance cut off 5Å (the higher cutoff for attractive London-van der
Waals forces19) to capture only effective physical contacts within and between the terminal
atoms. Examination of atom-atom contacts between N-terminal segment (residues 1-25; up to
second secondary structural elements (SSEs) from N-terminal) and C-terminal segment (residues
319-354 ; up to second SSEs from C-terminal end) for each structure reveals that V1L mutant
has a higher value of normalized atom-atom contacts between termini in comparison to V1A
(Table S3, Fig. S3). We observed that there is a much larger increase (~11.3%) of contacts
between N-terminal segment and C-terminal segment than within the N-terminal segment

(~3.4%) in V1L structure compared to V1A structure indicating a cosying up of the terminal
regions in the stable mutant.

Network parameters and protein stability. Protein structures contain a variety of weak and
strong non-covalent interactions that integrate different parts of the structure and interplay of
these interactions provides the structural stability to proteins. Here, we analyze this using a
network representation of protein structure by generating residue interaction network (RIN)
which considers all non-covalent interactions between pairs of interacting residues (see
Methods). We also decomposed the network into different sub networks based on the strength of
interaction score (Is) between the interacting residues and analyzed their global topology and
corresponding network parameters. The analysis reveals that the more stable mutant, V1L has a
higher magnitude of most of the network parameters (total number of edges or links (E),
edge/node (E/N) ratio; where N is the total number of residues in the protein structure, average
nearest neighbors (<k>)) than the less stable mutant, V1A (Table S4). The values of these
network parameters are very similar to each other. This may be because, all these structures have
the same size (354 amino acids), and there is only one amino acid difference in their primary
structures. However, it is relevant to compare their network parameters as they show different
thermostability scale. We notice that all three parameters (E, E/N and <k>) are relatively higher
for V1L than RBSX or V1A (Table S5) at all interaction score cut-off (Ismins). This may indicate
that presence of higher number of interactions (higher E and E/N values) and better connectivity
within network (<k>) at different Ismins are likely to be involved in the structural stability and
provides the extra stabilizing force for V1L structure in comparison to RBSX or V1A structures.
We can infer that the observed difference in network parameters is a result of combined effect of

10

various subtle interactions (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, ion pairs etc.) manifested throughout
the structure due to a single mutation.
Apart from analyzing the different topological properties, we found that there is a gradual
decrease of size of largest strongly connected component (LSCC) with respect to increase of Ismin
in an edge-weighted RIN of each structure. It is observed that V1L structure has not only higher
number of edges and edge/node ratio at different residue interaction sub networks in comparison
to V1A, but also larger size of strongly connected components in their network. The cooperative
nature of these stabilizing interactions positively influences other interactions as evidenced by
largest size of connected component in the more stable mutant structure. Furthermore, a sharp
transition in the size of LSCC begins around Ismin = 1 and lies within a narrow range of Ismin (1 to
2), with no major change towards the side of higher interaction cut-off (Fig. S4). This sharp
transition in LSCC is attributed to the loss of different non-covalent interactions in the networks
as Ismin increases, thus quickly generating large number of small clusters. Then we turned our
attention to compare the network of largest cluster of amino acid residues at Ismin=1 for V1L and
V1A. The generation of combined comparison network of V1L and V1A based on the
superposition alignment of the corresponding 3D structures at Ismin = 1, results 28 unique residues
that correspond to V1L whereas there are 14 unique residues that correspond to V1A (Table S6).
In the comparison network, we found 535 number of identical edges that correspond to noncovalent interactions for both V1L and V1A. On the other hand, V1L has considerably higher
number of non-identical non-covalent interactions (192 edges) than V1A (125 edges). These
numbers reflect that there is a perturbation in the residue interaction networks brought by
extreme N-terminus mutation. It is notable that the many of these unique residues are distributed
in and around the terminal regions of the protein (Fig. 4). We found that ~25% of these unique

11

residues in V1L and ~14% of unique residues in V1A correspond to the termini. Thus, it may be
surmised that terminal residues are important in maintaining the structural stability of these
protein structure networks and could be considered for mutation(s) with a view to enhance
protein stability. Since the residues, not belongings to the terminal regions are also affected; it
would imply that the mutation, apart from directly influencing the interactions between N- to Cterminal regions (Fig. 2), also indirectly influences the interactions involving non-terminal
residues (Fig. 4).

Discussion
The picture which emerges from our study is that mutation(s) at the extreme N-terminus can be
either stabilizing or destabilizing and may be important in a fold such as the TIM barrel fold
where the N-terminus and C-terminus come close in 3D space, though separated in sequence.
Here, we consider the structural aspects based on crystallographically determined coordinates of
RBSX and its mutants, with a view to rationalize the difference in the protein stability due to an
extreme N-terminus mutation. Our study establishes that terminal regions should also be
considered for mutations for enhancing protein stability in folds where N-terminus and Cterminus come together in 3D structure.
The present findings provide valuable insights into the role of direct non-covalent interactions
between N- to C-termini in protein stabilization. Fig. 2 provides an example of such interactions
that are enhanced in the more stable mutant. The direct N- to C-terminal contacts in V1L mutant
involving L1 shows a clear difference in the degree of packing interactions of the side chain
atoms in comparison to V1 in RBSX and A1 in V1A structures (Fig. 2, Table S1). It appears that
these additional interactions might be playing a role in tying down the extreme N-terminus

12

during the thermal unfolding at high temperature12. Furthermore, we observed an enhancement in
the number of overall N- to C-terminal direct contacts in more stable mutant structure (V1L),
whereas the absence of many N-to C-terminal contacts could increase local unfolding of the
peptide chain at these weak links, and results in a lower unfolding temperature for the V1A
mutant (Fig. S3 and Table S3).
Though the mutation is at the extreme N-terminus, the C-terminal region is also affected which
shows that changes are not restricted to terminal regions (Fig. 3). We observed that there is
structural rearrangement of contacts throughout the structure more so within and between
terminal regions. The cooperative nature of these stabilizing interactions indirectly or
allosterically propagates to the other parts of the structure and positively influences other
interactions as evidenced by network analysis where the largest strongly connected component is
bigger in size for the more stable mutant structure (Fig. S4). Thus, it is likely that the increased
stability displayed by V1L mutant is a cumulative effect of small changes rather than solely
effect of the interactions involving the substituent amino acid. This effect is reminiscent of the
concept in economics of ‘comedy of the commons’ like in property resources20 applied here to
protein stabilization in which a cumulative effect of many contributions leads to a desired
outcome, in this case protein stability. In addition, the residues placed at long separation in the
primary structure plays an important role in stability of the protein as evidenced by the analysis
of LRCβCO, CβCD, and RINs (Table S3 and Fig. S1). Obviously, N- to C-terminal contacts are
the longest-range interactions possible in terms of sequence separation in any given protein
(Table S4). These results suggest that the overall increase of long-range interactions (primarily
through N- to C-terminal contacts) in V1L structure upon mutation is one of the primary sources
of increase in thermal stability. Our results are consistent with the earlier findings that long-range

13

interactions, connecting different parts of the protein structure, have a major role in folding and
stabilizing the tertiary structure of the protein16,21. However, what is remarkable is that all these
structural changes are elicited by just a single mutation at the extreme N-terminus of the protein.
The current study extends our knowledge of the nature of the N-terminal to C-terminal
interactions and their role in the stability of a protein. The N and C-termini come together in 3D
space and enable stabilization through mutual interactions, a distinct possibility in the TIM barrel
fold as demonstrated in the present report. An in silico analysis which was restricted to a set of
two-state folding proteins including TIM barrel fold showed the presence of N-C motif (Nterminal to C-terminal contacts) and suggested the possible role in initial protein folding and
stability10. This view is supported by our findings and crucially provides the experimental
evidence in a focused manner through mutations and crystal structure analysis, in reiterating the
importance in general of N- to C-terminal interactions on the stability of a protein. Fraying of the
terminal regions may make a protein susceptible to unfolding at high temperature. The terminal
regions may be stabilized if they interact separately with different parts of the proteins. However,
it may be more advantageous if the terminal regions dock with each other and mutually stabilize,
thereby reducing susceptibility to unfolding at high temperature.
Our work argues that augmenting N-to C-terminal non-covalent interactions enhances protein
stability. Such stabilization presumably insures against unfolding of an already folded protein
and it may aid the folding process. Although, it is clearly possible to stabilize proteins with other
mechanisms/factors as reported22,23, we demonstrate that proteins can be stabilized without
compromising their biological functions through optimization of N- to C-terminal non-covalent
interactions. This apparent stabilization through N- to C-terminal interactions seems to be
implicated in the structures of TIM (EC 5.3.1.1) isolated from different organisms. We found

14

higher normalized N- to C-terminal contacts (6.17) for hyperthermophilic TIM from Thermotoga
maritima (PDB ID: 1B9B, optimum growth temperature (OGT) = 80 °C) than thermophilic TIM
(6.15) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB ID: 1BTM, OGT= 65 °C) and mesophilic
TIM (5.64) from Escherichia Coli (PDB ID: 1TRE, OGT= 37 °C) when compared across
monomers, despite their similar 3D structures (Fig. S6). In the case of the TIM barrel fold, the NC terminal region that can contribute to protein stability belongs to the scaffold region24,25 and is
usually away from the active site region (Fig. 1). This might have contributed to the evolvability
of the fold due to which approximately 10% of all enzymes have the TIM barrel fold.
Furthermore, apart from TIM barrel fold proteins, a comparative analysis of an NAD(P)binding Rossmann-fold domain protein, GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
from different bacterial species in which N- and C-terminal are close together reveals higher
normalized N- to C-terminal contacts in accordance to their OGT of the organisms. We observed
that GAPDH from hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (OGT = 80 °C) has a
higher normalized N-to C-terminal contacts than thermophilic GAPDH Thermus aquaticus(OGT
=70 °C), Geobacillus Stearothermophilus (OGT = 65 °C), and mesostable GAPDH from
Escherichia Coli (OGT = 37 °C) (Table 3). Further, we analyzed N- to C-terminal contacts for
other thermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs from different folds (in which N-and C-terminal are
in close proximity) and the results are consistent with our findings (data not shown). These
observations, taken together affirm the connection between N- to C-terminal non-covalent
interactions and protein stability.
It seems interesting that a number of important folds and super folds26 have their N- and Ctermini in contact with each other. Examples drawn from both globular and membrane proteins
include, Tata Box Binding Protein-like fold (1PCZ), both the variable and constant domains of

15

immunoglobulin fold (1DBB), β-lactemase fold (1ZG4), Aspartate/ornithine carmoyltransferase
like fold (1A1S), rubredoxin-like fold (1BRF), beta-Trefoil (1I1B), Tumor necrosis Factor
(TNF)-like fold (1TNF), beta-Grasp (Ubiquitin-like) fold (1UBQ), haloacid dehydrogenase-like
fold (1NF2), Ferredoxin-like fold (1VJW), Phosphoglycerate kinase fold (1PHP), armadillo
repeat protein (4DB6), Globin-like fold (1BZ0), Lysozyme-like fold (1REX),Thioredoxin fold
(1U3I), transmembrane beta-barrels fold (4GCP) and family A G Protein-coupled receptor-like
fold (1BRX). ‘Making the both ends meet’ seems to be a feature common to all these proteins.
Proteins might have evolved the N- and C-terminal interactions as one of the strategies to
stabilize their structures in a fold specific manner27. Thus, it is apparent that in diverse
folds/proteins the terminal regions are in close proximity suggesting that they could be
considered as candidates for modulating stability by mutation(s) focusing on terminal regions
and hence our results should have wider applicability.
Sequence and structure-based bioinformatics analyses have delineated a methodology to
identify target positions for mutagenesis that would enhance protein thermostability. In this
context, our study reveals that protein termini are one of the regions of interest (ROI) for
mutational studies. Mutations focusing on the terminal regions could be considered to modulate
the protein stability particularly in folds where terminal regions come together in 3D space,
contrary to the general belief that terminal residues are very flexible and hence have less effect
on stability7. Our work provides the insights into the nature of N- to C-terminal interactions and
adds to the repertoire of approaches for increasing thermal stability of proteins. The need to
stabilize proteins continues to grow in importance. For example, therapeutic proteins from betatrefoil fold, Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) involved in ischemic disease and type-2 diabetes
and Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) involved in wound healing have terminal regions in close

16

proximity. It is reported that the efficacy of these proteins are limited due to low in vivo stability
and poor bio-stability27, 28. It is rather tempting to suggest that such proteins could be potential
candidates for stability enhancement by strengthening N-to C-terminal non-covalent interactions,
even though this needs to be established through experimental work. Mutational experiments in
future, on both biotechnologically and therapeutically important proteins could benefit from the
knowledge that N-C terminal region is also relevant for enhancing protein stability in a foldspecific manner. It is important to investigate more proteins from diverse organisms to decipher
other biological significances of N- to C-terminal contacts. Eventually, such studies should help
in understanding the evolution and utilization of interactions between termini in the protein
universe and for designing effective protein engineering strategies.

Methods
Crystallization and Data Collection. The purification of recombinant BSX (RBSX) and other
N-terminal mutants was carried out as described previously8. The RBSX crystals were grown in
a reservoir solution containing 0.1M NaCl, 120mM MgCl2, 0.1M Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and 16 %
PEG 8000. Similarly, other two mutants V1A and V1L were grown by hanging drop method
varying the concentration of MgCl2 and PEG 8000. All the crystals were obtained at 20°C-22°C
by setting up protein and reservoir solution in the ratio of 1µl:1µl drop. Home source data sets
were collected for RBSX and V1A mutant whereas synchrotron data sets were collected for V1L
mutant crystals. All the data sets, RBSX, V1A, and V1L were collected at 100K and data sets
were processed using mosflm29.

Structure Solution and Refinement. The structures were solved by the molecular replacement
method with program PHASER-MR from the PHENIX program package30 using the native
crystal structure [PDB ID: 2f8q] as the search model. Then Phenix AutoBuild wizard was used
for model rebuilding and completion31. The AutoBuild Wizard uses RESOLVE, xtriage and
phenix.refine to build an atomic model, refine it, and improve the same with iterative density
modification, refinement, and model building32. Further refinement and model building were
carried out using REFMAC533, 34and COOT from the CCP4 program35. Five percent of randomly
selected observed reflections were kept aside for cross-validation. The stereochemistry of the
final models was analyzed with PROCHECK36 and RMS deviations resulted in the proper values
(Table 1). MolProbity37was used to validate the final models. None of the models contain
residues in the generously and disallowed region of the Ramachandran (φ, ψ) map38 (Table 1).

Cβ Contact order (CβCO). The concept of contact order (CO) was originally used to define the
topological complexity of the native protein to explain the differences in folding rates of
different protein families39:

the distance exclusively between the

Cβ atoms (Cα atoms for Glycine) of residues i and j in the protein structure. Two residues are
considered to be in contact if their Cβ atoms are closer than a threshold radius rd

 10 Å. Here, L

is the length of the protein and N is the total number of Cβ contacts within the distance threshold.
In addition, we have excluded the trivial contacts between the nearest and second nearest
residues. Earlier studies in which Cβ atoms are considered prominently include the definition of
half sphere exposure to characterize exposed and buried residues40, structural alphabets for fold
recognition41 and in the prediction of deleterious mutations42. In general, contact order (CO) is
used to describe the topological complexity of protein structure and has been reported in
connection with protein folding rate and thermostability39, 43. The structural metric CβCO, used in
the current analysis is different from CO. The essence of CβCO is that it considers only the Cβ
atoms instead of all atom models for a residue, while it can retain the intrinsic signature of CO.
The main advantage of using only the Cβ atoms in the calculation is that it is more robust to the
poorly defined side chain conformations and simultaneously it has the ability to measure a
residue’s local side chain environments. This will also be true for those low resolution crystal
structures in which side chain density of residues is not well defined and for ab initio model
structures or any modelled structures where side chain conformations are not accurately
modelled. Moreover, contrary to Cα, which is a backbone atom, Cβ belongs to the side chain
atoms of a residue and can provide a side chain centric view of the structure. In addition, CβCO
value has a dependency on the direction of a residue’s side chain atoms. At the same time, CβCO
is easy to compute, conceptually simple to interpret and importantly our works bring out that it
correlates with the stability changes of the mutants. Our analysis is presumably among the first

19

studies in which Cβ atoms are used to study the effect of the long-range order and its implication
for protein thermal stability.

Residue-wise Cβ contact order (RWCβCO). Kinjo and Nishikawa44 first introduced the concept
of residue-wise contact order, which is the sum of the sequence separation of contacting residues
as given in equation (i). For a protein of length L, the RWCβCO values of the i-th residue is
defined as,

RWC COi 

1
L

N

 | i  j | (ri , j )

(3)

j:|i  j |  2

where ri , j is the distance between the Cβ atoms of the i-th and j-th residues (Cα for Glycine) in the
protein structure as given in equation (ii). We set

rd  10Å as a threshold distance.

Cβ contact density (CβCD). We have defined Cβ contact density as,

C CD 

1

L

L

  ni , j

(4)

L i 1 j 1

Where n is the total number of Cβ-Cβ contacts (Cα atoms for Glycine) within a distance cut off
ij

(10 Å) and L is the length of the protein structure. We have not used obvious contacts between
the nearest and second-nearest residues.

Structural analysis. The solvent accessible surface area was calculated using the NACCESS
program45. Contacts were found using NCONT of the CCP4 suite (CCP4-6.4.0)46. Secondary
structures were assigned by DSSP47.All the figures of molecules were generated using PyMOL
(http://www.pymol.org).

Residue Interaction Networks (RINs). Protein structure can be represented as a residue
interaction network between amino acid residues. In this analysis, protein structures were
modelled as undirected graphs in which amino acids are considered as nodes and they are
connected by edges or links that correspond to non-covalent interactions between these nodes.
These edges of this RIN can be either weighted or un-weighted based on non-covalent
interaction strength (Is) between two connecting nodes and/or distances. Here, we used
RINerator48 modules to generate the residue interaction networks for each protein structure.
RINerator first adds hydrogen atoms to the original protein structure by using REDUCE17, and
then Probe18 is used to identify non-covalent residue interactions. Here, the edges are labelled
with different interaction types e.g. inter-atomic contacts (cnt), hydrogen bonds (hbond),
overlapping van der Waals radii (ovl) and generic residue interactions (combi). Probe also
computes interaction score for each edge in which the weight is proportional to the strength of
the interaction. It is suggested that in contrast to the other protein network14, 16, RINerator is
capable of generating a more realistic residue interaction networks by sampling atomic packing
of each atom using small probe contact dot surface49.
We constructed different sub networks based on the strength of interaction score (Is) evaluated
by Probe between all pairs of amino acid residues in which any pair of amino acid residues is
connected by an edge, if their interaction score (Is) is higher than a threshold value (Ismin). Then,
RINs of all three structures were constructed at different Ismin values and their network topology
and various network parameters were analyzed. All these networks are visualized using
Cytoscape50. Network Analyzer51 plugin and RINalyzer49 plug-in of Cytoscape were used to
calculate simple topological parameters and comparison of two RINs respectively.

21

Strongly Connected Component (SCC). Further, we calculated strongly connected component
for each network at different cut-off of interaction score by BiNoM2.552 module in Cytoscape.
BiNoM uses the algorithm of Trojan to decompose the network into strongly connected
components53. The giant cluster, defined here, as largest strongly connected component (LSCC)
is the size of largest group of connected nodes (in terms of number of residues) in the network.
The size of the SCC in the network depends on the interaction score cut-off of between two
nodes. Hence, the size of SCC is a function of interaction score cut-off (Ismin). We then calculated
the size of largest SCC by varying the cut-off of interaction score and plotted as a function of
Ismin. Here, the size of LSCC is normalized with respect to the total number of residues in the
protein.

Fig. 1. Overview of RBSX crystal structure. The crystal structure of RBSX (PDB ID: 4QCE)
is shown in cartoon representation. Because of TIM barrel fold, N-terminus (blue region) comes
close to the C-terminus (red region) and their proximity is implicated in stability enhancement.
The location of mutation is away from the active site (sphere and stick in firebrick) residues
(E149 and E259).
