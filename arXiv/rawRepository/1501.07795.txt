Abstract
Apoptotic death pathways are frequently activated by death ligand induction and
subsequent activation of the membrane proximal signaling module. Death receptors
cluster upon binding to death ligands, leading to formation of a membrane proximal
death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC). In this membrane proximal signalosome,
initiator caspases (caspase 8) are processed resulting in activation of both type 1 and type
2 pathways of apoptosis signaling. How the type 1/type 2 choice is made is an important
question in the systems biology of apoptosis signaling. In this study, we utilize a Monte
Carlo based in silico approach to elucidate the role of membrane proximal signaling
module in the type 1/type 2 choice of apoptosis signaling. Our results provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the formation of DISC signalosome and caspase 8 activation.
Increased concentration of death ligands was shown to correlate with increased type 1
activation. We also study the caspase 6 mediated system level feedback activation of
apoptosis signaling and its role in the type 1/type 2 choice. Our results clarify the basis of
cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptosis activation and ramifications of this issue is
further discussed in the context of therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

Introduction
Apoptosis, a programmed mode of cell death, is used in a variety of cellular and
physiological situations ranging from developmental regulations to tissue homeostasis.
Apoptosis is frequently mediated by death ligands (DL) that are known to cluster death
receptors (DR) and membrane proximal adaptor proteins in a signaling complex called
DISC (death inducing signaling complex). Procaspase 8 is recruited by adaptor molecules
in the DISC and gets cleaved to its active form caspase 8, which in turn, activates both
type 1 and type 2 pathways of apoptosis. However, a clear mechanistic understanding of
DISC formation and caspase 8 activation, under death ligand induction, is lacking. In
addition to its relevance in the biology of apoptosis, such mechanistic understanding can
be key to developing therapies for apoptosis related diseases. Death ligand (such as FasL)
induced apoptosis has been shown to be the mode of cell death in activation induced cell
death (ADCC) in lymphocytes (Elmore 2007). In addition, killing of pathogen infected
cells or tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells is
frequently mediated by death ligands (Elmore 2007). TRAIL, a death ligand found on the
plasma membrane of NK cells (Takeda et al. 2001), has emerged as a promising agent in
cancer chemotherapy (Falschlehner et al. 2007; Shirley et al. 2011; Kurita et al. 2011;
Picarda et al. 2012). Recent experiments have shown that the fraction of melanoma (skin
cancer) stem cells is much higher in NOD SCID IL2rg-/- mice than that found in regular
NOD SCID xenotransplantation assays (Quintana et al. 2008). Mice lacking the IL2rg
receptor chain are known to be depleted of NK cells, thus, indicating an important role
for TRAIL mediated killing of tumor cells. DISC formation and Caspase 8 activation
have also been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as in Alzheiemer’s disease
where Aβ (amyloid beta) oligomers and aggregates provide the apoptotic stimuli (Picone
et al. 2009; Di Carlo 2010). In addition to apoptosis, death receptor activation has been
shown to be involved in other forms of cell death such as necrosis and necroptosis (Kim
et al. 2000; Daniels et al. 2005).
Death ligand induction leads to caspase 8 activation and thus could activate both type 1
and type 2 pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of type 1/type 2 regulation remains
an important problem in the biology of apoptosis. Some of the initial experiments
classified cells as either type 1 or type 2 depending on their mode of activation (Scaffidi
et al. 1998; Scaffidi et al. 1999). It was indicated that DISC formation and caspase 8
activation is stronger in type 1 cells (Scaffidi et al. 1998). Even though initial studies
found that increased caspase 8 activation can switch the activation from type 2 to type 1
(Scaffidi et al. 1998; Hua et al. 2005), a clear mechanistic understanding of such a
correlation was lacking as caspase 8 molecules activate both type 1 and type 2 pathways
(Okazaki et al. 2008). Crucial insight into the problem can be provided by considering the
kinetic rate constants for reactions involving caspase 8 with its immediate binding
partners in type 1 and type 2 pathways. Preferential binding of capsase 8 with Bid (type 2
pathway) explains the type 2 phenotype in cells exhibiting low caspase 8 activation
	  

2	  

(Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2013). The levels of initiator
caspases (pro-caspase 8 and pro-caspase 9) have also been shown to be key regulators of
the type 1/ type 2 choice (Okazaki et al. 2008). In a previous work, we have shown that
type 1/type 2 choice is regulated at a systems level (Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri
2013). How fast the activation signal propagates through the type 1 and type 2 pathways,
to finally activate effector caspases (caspase 3/7), was shown to determine the type 1/type
2 choice. Therefore, it becomes clear that both caspase 8 activation and systems level
regulation downstream of caspase 8 activation determine the type 1/type 2 choice. Even
though an important regulatory role of active caspase 8 in the type 1/type 2 choice has
been established, the mechanism of caspase 8 activation (such as by death ligand
induction) remains to be clearly elucidated. In this context, one may ask whether
concentration of death ligands can impact the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptosis signaling.
One also needs to consider the effect of inherent state of the membrane proximal module
on the type 1/type 2 choice. Due to its crucial role in the regulatory mechanisms of
apoptosis signaling, the question of type 1/ type 2 choice has important ramifications for
cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. We have recently studied the possibility of
switching the activation from type 2 to type 1 by targeting the membrane proximal
apoptotic signaling module in cancer cells (Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2013).
Recent experiments also explored how a type 2 to type 1 transition can be achieved in the
context of TRAIL induced apoptosis (Kurita et al. 2011). The problem of type 1/type 2
choice also has important ramifications for neurodegenerative disorders such as in
Alzheimer's disease. Aggregated form of Aβ peptides were shown to activate the type 1
pathway of apoptosis, whereas Aβ oligomers mainly activated the type 2 pathway
(Picone et al. 2009). Caspase 8 activation was observed under the action of both Aβ
oligomers and aggregates (even though Aβ oligomers may enter the cytosol and mediate
its dominant apoptotic effect). Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the activation of
the membrane proximal signaling module and its role in the type 1/type 2 choice, during
apoptotic activation, can have profound implications for therapies for cancer and
neurodegenerative disorders.
Activation of the membrane proximal apoptotic module, hence the type 1/type 2 choice,
is further impacted by a systems level feedback mechanism mediated by caspase 6. It is
known that active caspase 3 can proteolytically cleave pro-caspase 6 and generate active
caspase 6 molecules. Caspase 6 has effector activities (similar to other effector caspases
such as caspase 3/7) but they are also capable of activating caspase 8. Thus caspase 8
activation, upon death ligand induction, can propagate the activation signal through the
type 1/type 2 loop network finally leading to activation of caspase 3 -> caspase 6 ->
caspase 8 in a systems level feedback loop (Figure 1). Here, we study the effect of
caspase 6 mediated feedback activation and elucidate the role of caspase 6 on the type
1/type 2 choice. Caspase 6 has attracted much recent attention in the context of neural
cell apoptosis neurodegenerative disorders (Leblanc 2013). However, activation of
caspase 6 in some of these cases might be through non-canonical pathways (different
from the usual caspase 8 -> caspase 3 -> caspase 6 activation).
Cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis signaling has been established as an important
regulatory mechanism in apoptotic cell death (Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri

	  

3	  

2010; Albeck et al. 2008; Dussmann et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2010). Expression levels of
pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins are usually cell-type specific (Lopez-Araiza et al. 2006),
but significant cell-to-cell variability (within a population of a given cell type) in protein
levels has been observed (Spencer et al. 2009). Such cellular variability in apoptotic
molecules can generate single cell variability in apoptotic activation (Spencer et al. 2009;
Skommer et al. 2010). However, even when all the cellular parameters are identical, cellto-cell variability can result from inherently stochastic signaling reactions (Raychaudhuri
et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri 2010; Skommer et al. 2010). Interestingly, cell-to-cell inherent
variability can have important implications for diseases in which apoptosis is
dysregulated (Raychaudhuri et al. 2010; Skommer et al. 2010; Brittain et al. 2010;
Skommer et al. 2011a; Skommer et al. 2011b). In a recent work, we have shown that low
probability activation of Bax by BH3 only activators (such as Bid) is a mechanism for
generating cell-to-cell variability (Raychaudhuri and Das 2013). We have also found that
cell-to-cell variability in this situation is remarkably sensitive to the Bcl-2 to Bax ratio
(Bcl2 to Bax ratio > 1 was linked to slow apoptotic activation with cell-to-cell stochastic
variability). In cancer cells, high Bcl2 to Bax ratio is frequently observed and is a
mechanism for apoptosis resistance of cancer cells (Certo et al. 2006). In contrast, in
Alzheimer's diseases a recent study has shown that the Bcl2 to Bax ratio (to < 1) can be
altered by Aβ peptides to favor apoptotic activation, which can then be reversed by the
application of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) to protect neural cells (Sun et
al. 2012). Therefore, novel chemotherapeutic strategies (in cancer and neurodegenerative
disorders) might be possible to design that would rely on modulating cell-to-cell
stochastic variability in apoptotic activation. Our previous works have indicated that the
problem of type 1/type 2 choice is linked to the issue of cell-to-cell stochastic variability
in apoptosis (as activation through the type 2 pathway is frequently associated with
stochastic variability while type 1 activation remains deterministic) (Raychaudhuri et al.
2008; Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2013). Hence, elucidating the role of death
ligands and the membrane proximal signaling module in the type 1/type 2 choice can
have major implications for understanding cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptosis
activation and also for apoptosis related diseases.
In this work, we develop a hybrid Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to study the question of
type 1/type 2 choice in apoptosis activation. Specifically, we address how the following
parameters impact the type 1/type 2 choice: (1) concentration of death ligands and (2) the
inherent state of the membrane proximal module. Our results indicate increased death
ligand concentration increases type 1 activation and may lead to a type 2 to type 1
transition for a given cell type. The expression levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins
in the membrane proximal signaling module are also shown to be crucial in caspase 8
activation and the type 1/type 2 choice. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the
process of DISC clustering and caspase 8 activation (upon induction of death ligands). In
addition, we consider the systems level feedback mechanism mediated by caspase 6
activation and elucidates its role on type 1/type 2 choice. We discuss the implications of
our results for cell-to-cell stochastic variability in apoptotic activation and show how
such stochastic variability can be utilized to design therapies for cancer and
neurodegenerative disorders.

Methods
The signaling model for apoptotic cell death
We carried out a computational study of death ligand induced apoptosis using Monte
Carlo (MC) simulations. A simplified network model of apoptotic death signaling (Figure
1) was studied utilizing controlled in silico experiments. Both type 1 and type 2 pathways
were simulated.
In our model, casapse 8 (initiator caspase) activation initiates signaling through both type
1 and type 2 pathways. Death ligands (such as FasL / TRAIL) undergo binding /
unbinding reactions with death receptors with nanomolar affinity. Probability parameters
Pon and Poff are used to simulate binding / unbinding between death ligands and receptors
(those presumably vary depending on the receptor type). Ligand binding supposedly
induces a conformational change in the death receptors leading to their oligomerization
(Scott et al. 2009). In our model, two ligand bound death receptors reduce their free
energy (Edd is taken to be -2 KBT unless specified otherwise) when occupying
neighboring lattice sites and thus induce clustering of death receptors. Adaptor proteins
(such as FADD / TRADD for Fas receptors) could bind to ligand bound death receptors,
with moderately high 108 M-1 affinity, using an interaction between their death domains
(DD). Affinity for this receptor-adaptor interaction was assumed to be similar to that
between the adaptor molecule and pro-caspase 8. Adaptor molecules could also bind to
free death receptors albeit with a low probability (affinity ~ 1 M-1) so that significant
apoptotic activation does not occur without ligand induction. Death effector domains
(DED) of the adaptor molecules are known to bind with the DED domains of pro-caspase
8 molecules (kon: 3.5 × 106 M-1 s-1 and koff: 0.018 s-1) (Hua et al. 2005). However, this
interaction takes place only when adaptors are already bound to death receptors.
Therefore, ligand binding could induce clustering of death receptors and recruitment of
adaptor molecules to clustered death receptors. Procaspase 8 molecules are then recruited
to the clustered adaptor proteins to generate the assembly of DISC (death-inducingsignaling-complex), ultimately leading to active caspase 8 molecules through
autoprocessing (Peter and Krammer 2003). In this work, DISC formation was simulated
using a hybrid simulation scheme between kinetic Monte Carlo model for signaling
reactions with an explicit free energy based model for the clustering of death receptors
(Raychaudhuri 2013).
Active caspase 8 initiates signaling through both type 1 and type 2 pathways. In the type
1 pathway, caspase 8 directly processes procaspase 3 (effector caspases) to generate
active caspase 3. In the type 2 pathway, caspase 8 cleaves Bid to an active form (tBid)
which translocates to mitochondria to bind with Bax. We have earlier shown that higher
affinity of active caspase 8 for Bid, compared with that for pro-caspase 3, leads to
preferential activation of the type 2 pathway (at early times) (Raychaudhuri and

	  

5	  

Raychaudhuri 2013). Additional complexities, in the initial type 1/type 2 choice, might
arise from cell type specific rate of Bid cleavage (such as due to Bid phosphorylation
status in a given cell type) (Ozoren and El-Deiry 2002), but are not considered here.
When two Bax molecules are bound to tBid (on the mitochondrial membrane) they could
detach as an active Bax dimer. Apoptotic inhibitor Bcl2 molecules bind with tBid and
Bax and thereby inhibit formation of active Bax dimers. It is also possible for Bid to
directly activate Bax albeit with a low probability (Raychaudhuri and Das 2013).
Cytochrome c is released into the cytosol in an all-or-none manner when the number of
active Bax dimers reaches a pre-assigned threshold value (Goldstein et al. 2000;
Dussmann et al. 2010). Cytochrome c release leads to cytochorme c-Apaf binding and the
subsequent formation of multi-molecular cyto c-Apaf-ATP complex apoptosome.
Formation of the apoptosome complex is modeled in a simplified manner (by a cyto cApaf-Apaf-cyto c complex) where Apaf represents the Apaf-ATP complex. In our Monte
Carlo simulations, effective low probability of apoptosome formation generates
stochastic variability in apoptotic activation, but once formed, induces rapid activation of
downstream caspases 9 and 3 (Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2010; Bagci et al.
2006). Caspase 9 is an initiator caspase (similar to caspase 8), which gets activated in the
clustered assembly of apoptosome (whereas caspase 8 gets activated in DISC). The
CARD domain of pro-caspase 9 interacts with the Apaf CARD domain (Sheridan et al.
1997; Pan et al. 1997; Mantovani et al. 2001). Active caspase 9, in turn, cleaves
procaspase 3 to its active form caspase 3. Apoptotic inhibitor XIAP binds to procaspase
9, caspase 9, and caspase 3 using its BIR domains (Riedl et al. 2001; Shiozaki et al.
2003), thus it could inhibit apoptotic activation in both type 1 and type 2 pathways.
However, the release of mitochondrial Smac can antagonize the inhibition of XIAP
(Huang et al. 2003; Sun et al. 2002). Smac is released simultaneously with cytochrome c
in an all-or-none type manner. Active Caspase 3 can process pro-caspase 6 to
proteolytically active caspase 6, another effector caspase but it also has the ability to
activate pro-caspase 8 (Sun et al. 2002). Thus caspase 6 provides a systems level
feedback loop for both type1 and type 2 apoptotic activation. The details of all the
reaction moves that are downstream of caspase 8 and considered in our current
simulation (of the apoptosis pathway) are provided in our earlier works (Raychaudhuri
and Raychaudhuri 2013). Activation of caspase 3 (effector caspase) closes the type 1/type
2 activation loop (that is initiated by active caspase 8) and thus can be taken to be a
downstream readout of apoptotic cell death signaling; MC simulations were carried out to
measure the time-course of caspase activation at a single cell level.
Even though the present model can capture some of the essential systems level regulatory
mechanisms of the apoptotic signaling pathway, it has several simplifying assumptions.
In our model, effects of functionally similar proteins are coarse-grained by a
representative protein. Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma protein 2), for example, represents all the
Bcl-2 family proteins (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) with similar anti-apoptotic
properties. In this context, it should be noted that the death receptors / ligands simulated
here capture the effect of only one type of receptor / ligand (such as Fas / FasL or DR4 /
TRAIL), not the combined effect of all the death receptors / ligands. In our present study,
DISC formation has been modeled in a simplified manner. Different isoforms of cFLIP
have been implicated in differential regulation of apoptotic activation (Safa and Pollok
2011; Fricker et al. 2010). A role of cleavage product of cFLIP (such as p43-FLIP) in
	  

6	  

NF-kB activation has also been studied using mathematical modeling (Neumann et al.
2010). Here, we consider only the anti-apoptotic action of cFLIP (such as by cFLIPs that
competitively binds with adaptor proteins in the DISC signalosome). In our study, the
threshold of apoptotic activation, such as the threshold death ligand needed to trigger
apoptosis, is governed by the level of apoptotic inhibitors such as cFLIP, Bcl2 and XIAP.
In addition, the rate of synthesis and degradation of signaling molecules (such as
caspases) can modify the threshold of activation (Gu et al. 2011) but is not considered
here.

Monte Carlo Simulation of Cell Death Signaling
Monte Carlo approach has been shown to capture some of the complexities of signaling
reactions such as the effect of spatial heterogeneity (Raychaudhuri 2013). Each run of our
Monte Carlo simulation corresponds to apoptotic activation in a single cell, thus, Monte
Carlo can capture cell-to-cell stochastic variability including inherent variability. We
utilize a hybrid Monte Carlo simulation scheme that combines the following approaches:
(1) a probabilistic rate constant based (implicit free energy) kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation for various reaction moves such as diffusion, binding/unbinding and catalytic
cleavage; (2) an explicit free-energy based model that captures clustering of ligand-bound
death receptors utilizing energy-function based diffusion moves. Both of the above
approaches have been utilized in previous works from this lab (Raychaudhuri 2013). At
each Monte Carlo (MC) step molecules are randomly sampled N number of times, where
N is the total number of molecules (either free or complexed) present in the system.
Therefore, at each Monte Carlo (MC) step, one molecule is sampled (on average) once to
allow for either diffusion or a reaction move. All the intracellular reaction moves
(considered in our current simulations) and the corresponding kinetic rate constants can
be found in our earlier works. Diffusion moves are carried out to one of the randomly
chosen neighboring sites (4 for membrane bound molecules and 6 for cytosolic
molecules) provided the condition of mutual physical exclusion is satisfied. In the kinetic
Monte Carlo part of the simulation, once a diffusion/reaction move is randomly sampled
it is accepted only if a randomly generated number in [0,1] is less than the pre-defined
probability constant for that particular move (otherwise the move is rejected). The
detailed balance condition is satisfied through the ratio Pon/Poff, the probability constants
for the binding and unbinding reactions, respectively (Raychaudhuri 2013). In the explicit
free energy based part of the simulation, diffusion moves are accepted based on
Metropolis criterion (Paccept = min[1,exp(-ΔE/KBT)], where ΔE is the free energy
difference between the new and the previous configuration (Newman and G.T. 1999).

Estimation of Parameter Values (used in Our Monte Carlo Simulation)
A simulation volume of 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.2 µm3 (corresponding to a 60 × 60 × 60 lattice with
lattice spacing Δx ~20 nm) is chosen in such a manner that the number of molecules (for
each molecular species) is equal to the nanomolar concentration. Death receptors are
placed on one surface of the simulation lattice (1.2 × 1.2 µm2); death ligands are placed
	  

7	  

on a surface parallel to the surface on which death receptors are placed. Cytochrome
c/Smac is initially contained in a mitochondrial volume of 0.36 × 0.36 × 0.36 µm3 (18 ×
18 × 18 lattice). Utilization of a small system size significantly reduces the computational
cost of the simulation. Each MC step (ΔT) is chosen to be 10-4 s based on known mobility
of cytosolic molecules. This allows us to take the probability of diffusion (Pdiff) for the
fastest diffusing species (cytosolic molecules) to a value 0.5 (an approximate diffusion
constant can be estimated D ~ (1/2) × Pdiff × (Δx)2/(ΔT) ~ (1/2) × 0.5 × (Δx)2/(ΔT) ~ 1
µm2/s). Consistent with lower diffusion constants known for membrane proteins,
probability of diffusion for molecules on the plasma membrane (or the mitochondrial
membrane) is taken an order of magnitude lower than that is used for cytosolic
molecules. It is reasonable to expect that the multi-molecular complex apoptosome will
have significantly reduced mobility and its Pdiff is assumed to be zero. Kinetic reaction
rates (such as kon/koff) and molecular concentrations are obtained from values reported in
the literature (mostly from (Hua et al. 2005)) and utilized in our previous work
(Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri and Das 2013; Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri
2013) (unless specified otherwise). Even though Hua et al. considered activation by Fas
ligands, the binding affinities for other death receptor-ligands are known to be similar (in
the nano-molar range). Probabilistic reaction rate constants used in this study are
obtained from kinetic rate constants using a previously described parameter-mapping
scheme (Raychaudhuri 2013). Poff (or Pcatalysis) simulation parameters are obtained by
multiplying koff (or kcatalysis) values by 10-4 s (1 MC time-step). Probabilistic parameters
for association reactions are determined using the following relation: Pon = 102 × kon nM-1
s-1 (Raychaudhuri 2013). A typical simulation is run for 2 × 108 MC steps. Controlled
Monte Carlo experiments are carried out for specific parameter values (such as molecular
concentrations). Each run of the simulation corresponds to activation at a single cell
level. We define the following parameters for quantitatively assessing the extent of type 1
and type 2 activations: Ntype1/( Ntype1 + Ntype2) and Ntype2/( Ntype1 + Ntype2), where Ntype1 and
Ntype2 represents the number of active caspase 3 molecules generated by caspase 8 and
caspase 9, respectively.

Results
Expression levels of death receptor and other molecules in the membrane proximal
signaling module are key determinants of the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptosis
Expression levels of death receptors (DRs), death adaptor proteins, apoptotic procaspase
8 and anti-apoptotic cFLIP define the inherent state of the membrane proximal signaling
module. Death ligand induction perturbs the membrane proximal module leading to
clustering of death receptors and adaptor proteins in the form of DISC and subsequent
activation of caspase 8. We first consider the effect of variation in death receptor
concentration on apoptotic activation keeping other molecules (including the ones in the
membrane module) fixed. Death receptor expression is known to be cell type specific
though cell-to-cell variability in death receptor level can be significant (Meng et al.

	  

8	  

2011). The cell-type specific variability in death receptor expression has recently been
shown to be a regulator of the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptotic death signaling (Meng et
al. 2011). Here, we explore the mechanistic basis of the observed correlation between
death receptor expression and the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptosis signaling. We studied
apoptotic activation as the number of death receptors was varied in the following manner:
2, 10 and 100 molecules. Death ligand concentration was kept constant at 10 molecules in
these simulations. In Fig. 2 we show the fraction of type 1 activation which increased
with increasing expression of death receptor levels. Consistent with this, the time-todeath (averaged over 60 single cells) decreased with increasing level of death receptors:
Td = 1.08 × 108 MC steps for DR = 2, Td = 0.73 × 108 MC steps for DR = 10 and Td =
0.72 × 108 MC steps for DR = 100. Type 1 cells are known to have high death receptor
expression (SKW 6.4 has ~225 molecules/µm2 and H9 has ~190 molecules/µm2) (Meng
et al. 2011). In our simulation, type 1 activation was observed for lower concentration of
death receptors (than found in typical type 1 cells), but we simulate an effective
expression of death receptors and some of the anti-apoptotic factors, such as the
expression of decoy receptors (Pan et al. 1997), are not explicitly considered. In addition,
lipid mediated interactions and other complexities of DISC formation may modify the
type 1/type 2 choice. However, increased type 1 activation with increasing expression of
death receptor levels, as observed in our in silico studies, should be robust. In our
simulations, increased death receptor expression led to more rapid and increased
generation of active caspase 8 molecules (Fig. 2) and thereby increased type 1 signaling.
Previous studies including that carried out in this lab have indicated a key role of active
caspase 8 molecules in the type 1/type 2 choice (Scaffidi et al. 1998; Hua et al. 2005;
Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2013). However, strong
caspase 8 activation may not always lead to type 1 activation as, for example, type 2
signaling has been observed in caspase 3 deficient MCF-7 cell line despite significant
active caspase 8 generation in those cells (Scaffidi et al. 1998).
Consistent with our earlier findings (Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri and
Raychaudhuri 2013), type 2 activation was accompanied by large cell-to-cell stochastic
variability (Fig 3a). Interestingly, cell-to-cell variation in the caspase 8 activation (within
a cell population) provides a mechanism for generating cell-to-cell stochastic variability
in apoptosis, especially when the death receptor concentration is low (~ 2 molecules) (Fig
3b). Clearly, cell-to-cell variability in caspase 8 activation contributes to cell-to-cell
variability in effector caspase activation. In Fig. 3c, we show that the time to initial
caspase 3 (10% of total) activation, at the level of single cells, is correlated with the
initiation of caspase 8 activation.
It is reasonable to expect that the inherent state of the membrane proximal signaling
module is cell type specific and combined effect of all the molecules in the membrane
module impact the type 1/ type 2 choice. In our simulations, we varied the number of
molecules in the membrane proximal signaling module in the following manner: (1)
FADD = 10, cFLIP = 10 and procaspase 8 = 10, (2) FADD = 100, cFLIP = 100 and
procaspase 8 = 100 and (3) FADD = 100, cFLIP = 10 and procaspase 8 = 100.
Concentrations of both death ligands and death receptors were kept constant at 10
molecules. In our simulations, FADD represents the adaptor proteins that bind to both
death receptor and intracellular signaling molecules such as pro-caspase 8 (see Methods).

In Fig. 4, we show the type 1 fraction of activation as the membrane proximal signaling
module is varied. Increased type 1 activation correlated well with increased DISC
formation and generation of active caspase 8 molecules (Scaffidi et al. 1998). The timeto-death decreased with increasing type 1 activation: Td = 4.3 × 107 MC steps for FADD
= 10, cFLIP = 10, procaspase 8 = 10; Td = 3.9 × 107 MC steps or FADD = 100, cFLIP =
100, procaspase 8 = 100 and Td = 1.4 × 107 MC steps for FADD = 100, cFLIP = 10,
procaspase 8 = 100.
In our simulations, increased cFLIP level (or the cFLIP/procaspase 8 ratio) led to reduced
level of active caspase 8 generation resulting in decreased apoptosis and increased type 2
signaling. When we simulated Jurkat T cell (leukemia cell line) parameters obtained in
(Hua et al. 2005), type 2 signaling dominated apoptotic activation. However, when cFLIP
level was inhibited, there was marked increase in type 1 activation. Increased cFLIP level
has been observed in certain cancer cells and also been correlated with cancer
chemoresistance (Safa and Pollok 2011). However, when cFLIP level was low but FADD
and procaspase 8 levels were high, fast and robust type 1 activation was observed in our
simulations (Fig 4). Thus it might be possible to induce strong apoptotic activation in
cancer cells, by application of death ligands, when cFLIP level is low (or inhibited) but
other molecules in the membrane module are robustly expressed.

Increase in death ligand concentration increases type 1 activation and crucially
regulates the type 1/type 2 choice
Concentration of death ligands presumably varies in vivo and the effect of such
concentration variation needs to be studied in a systematic manner. We carried out
controlled in silico experiments where the concentration of death ligands was varied
keeping all other parameters constant. Death ligand concentration was varied in the
following manner: 2, 10 and 100 molecules. For each of these death ligand
concentrations the level of death receptor was varied in a similar manner: 2, 10 and 100
molecules. We observed that increased level of death ligand induction led to enhanced
type 1 activation (Fig 5). When both death ligand and death receptor concentrations were
high, rapid deterministic activation of the type 1 pathway has been observed. However,
for low level of death ligand induction (~ 1-2 molecules), apoptotic activation was
dominated by the type 2 pathway with large cell-to-cell variability (Fig. 6). Therefore,
even in cells that are known as type 1 cells (equipped with high level of death receptor
expression) it might be possible to alter the signaling phenotype from type 1 to type 2 by
decreasing the death ligand concentration (Especially when the interaction between death
domains of the death receptor and the adaptor molecule is high affinity with Kd ~ 10 nM
(Miyazaki and Reed 2001)). In a similar manner, large amount of death ligand induction
might increase type 1 activation in type 2 cells. However, in type 2 cells having very low
expression of death receptors, such as hepatocytes (Meng et al. 2011), it becomes
difficult to activate the type 1 pathway and activation of a second initiator caspase
(caspase 9) becomes essential for robust activation of effector caspases. For type 2 cells
equipped with very low death receptor expression it might still be possible to activate the
type 1 pathway in the following manner: (1) when the type 2 pathway is blocked

	  

10	  

resulting in a slow type 1 activation, (2) by enhancing expression of pro-apoptotic
membrane molecules especially the death receptor expression (Meng et al. 2011), (3) by
inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins such as cFLIP or XIAP (Jost et al. 2009; Raychaudhuri
and Raychaudhuri 2013). Other cell-type specific mechanisms for type 2 to type 1
transition are possible, such as, removing sequestration of c-MET bound Fas receptors by
application of HGF (hepatocyte growth factors) (Accordi et al. 2007) or enhancing the
expression of caspase 3 in caspase 3 deficient cell line MCF-7 (Scaffidi et al. 1998).
Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that both type 1 and type 2 pathways can get
activated irrespective of cell types.
It is expected that death ligand concentration and the inherent state of the membrane
module would regulate the clustering of DISC and thereby govern caspase 8 activation.
The parameter (Edd) governing the free-energy reduction of two neighboring death-ligand
bound receptors should also be a regulator of DISC generation. Varying this free-energy
parameter, resulted in altered clustering of death receptors and DISC generation. The
effect of death ligand concentration on the type 1 / type 2 choice is frequently mediated
by variation in death receptor clustering and DISC generation. Increased clustering was
observed in the case of high death ligand level (100 molecules), which seems to correlate
well with activation of caspase 8 (Supplemental Fig. 1). The effect of increased death
ligand concentration on receptor clustering was more pronounced when the free energy
parameter Edd = -3 KBT (Supplemental Fig. 1b). As mentioned earlier (Methods section),
Edd is an effective parameter and may vary depending on the cell type. In addition, it
might be possible to enhance Edd (Legembre et al. 2005; Thome et al. 2012) selectively in
cancer cells and induce apoptosis by death ligand induction or generating DISC
formation by some other mechanisms.
Caspase 6 provides a system level feedback loop for apoptotic pathways and thereby
impacts the type 1/type 2 choice
Caspase 8 activation initiates signaling through the type 1 and type 2 pathways ultimately
resulting in activation of effector caspases (caspase 3/7), thus creating a loop network
structure at the systems level. Caspase 6 is another effector caspase that is activated by
active caspase 3, but once activated it could also activate caspase 8 providing a
mechanism for systems level feedback regulation. It is expected that a significant amount
of active caspase 3 will be utilized to carry out their effector functions and only a fraction
of it will be available for processing pro-caspase 6. We do not explicitly model the
effector activities of active caspase 3, instead, a lower rate effective rate constant is
assumed for caspase 3 activation of caspase 6. In our simulations, the rate constants for
binding (Pon: between caspase 3 and pro-caspase 6) and catalytic activation (Pcat:
generation of active caspase 6 from caspase3-pro-caspase 6 complex) were taken to be
0.1 times that was used for caspase 3 activation by caspase 9. Similar rate constants were
assumed for binding and catalytic activation for caspase 6 – pro-caspase 8 reaction. It is
reasonable to expect that, similar to active caspase3, a significant portion of active
caspase 6 will engage its effector substrates (such as lamin A) resulting in effective lower
rate constants for its activation of caspase 8.
Caspase 6 activation led to increased generation of active caspase 8 molecules and thus
favored the type 1 activation. In Fig 7a, we show the type 1 fraction of activation for two
	  

11	  

different combinations of death ligand and death receptor concentrations, with and
without caspase 6. When both death ligand and death receptor concentrations were
moderate (~ 10 molecules or higher), rapid generation of active caspase 8 molecules led
to fast deterministic activation of the type 1 pathway and the effect of caspase 6 was to
slightly reinforce the fast type 1 activation. For low levels of death ligand concentrations
(~ 2 molecules), caspase 6 mediated feedback loop assisted in enhancing type 1
activation. For such low death ligand concentrations, especially when death receptor
concentration is also low, apoptotic activation was dominated by the type 2 pathway with
large cell-to-cell variability and slow activation of caspase 3; Caspase 6 activation was
also slow in accordance with slow activation of Caspase 3. Time-course of caspase 6
activation is provided in Fig. 7b. At the level of single cells, caspase 6 activation was
prominent only when robust caspase 3 activation was achieved after apoptosome
formation and caspase 9 activation. Thus Caspase 6 activation led to strong caspase 8
activation only after capsase 3 activation reached a significant level (at ~ 5 × 107 - 108
MC steps) (Fig. 7b and 7c). Consistent with our findings, robust activation of both
caspase 8 and caspase 3 has been shown to be delayed (~ hour) in type 2 cells (Scaffidi et
al. 1998) (though in those experiments apoptotic activation was probed at the population
level). In some of our simulations, such as when death ligand ~ 2 molec. and death
receptor ~ 100 molec., dominant mode of activation was altered from type 2 to type 1 due
to caspase 6 activation (type 1 fraction: 0.37 ± 0.22 for caspase 6 = 0 and type 1 fraction:
0.52 ± 32 for caspase 6 = 30 molec.). Thus caspase 6 inhibition can be used as a strategy
to switch the activation from type 1 to type 2 and to increase cell-to-cell variability. Such
a strategy can have important ramifications for the recently explored role of caspase 6
inhibition in treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (Leblanc 2013).

Discussion
In this work, we elucidate that the concentration of death ligand and the inherent state of
the membrane proximal signaling module affect the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptotic
activation. We demonstrate that the inherent state of the membrane proximal module,
such as the expression level of death receptors, can make cells of a given type prone to
either type 1 or type 2 activation. However, concentration of the death ligand also
emerges to be a key parameter in the type 1/type2 choice. Increased concentration of
death ligand induction increases type 1 activation and may lead to a type 2 to type 1
transition in a given cell type. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of caspase
6 activation mediated systems level feedback regulation (through caspase 8 activation)
and its impact on the type 1/type 2 choice. Results obtained in this study also indicate an
important role of cell-to-cell stochastic variability in caspase 8 activation. Such stochastic
variability cannot be captured by ODE based models of caspase 8 activation. Majority of
previous studies exploring the type 1/ type 2 choice in apoptosis did not consider the
effect of cell-to-cell variability in apoptotic activation.
In this study, formation of DISC and capsase 8 activation was modeled in a simplified
manner. Additional complexities might arise from variation in the mode of ligand
presentation (such as valency) (Huang et al. 1999), explicit simulation of decoy receptors

	  

12	  

(Pan et al. 1997) and lipid mediated interactions (George and Wu 2012; Song et al. 2007).
Presentation of oligomeric death ligands might lead to more robust DISC formation and
induction of type 1 activation in type 2 cells such as hepatocytes (Huang et al. 1999).
Taken together with our results, strength of death ligand mediated apoptotic stimuli
seems to be a crucial regulator of the type 1/type 2 choice, irrespective of cell types
(Raychaudhuri 2010). In this context, it should be noted that membrane bound death
ligands might be more effective in inducing receptor clustering in the restricted geometry
of the 2-dimensional cell-cell contact. Lipid mediated interactions have been implicated
in death ligand induced apoptotic activation even though a complete mechanistic
understanding is lacking. Some studies indicate that Fas receptors are localized in
sphingolipid rich regions of the plasma membrane in type 1 cells (Sanlioglu et al. 2005).
In our current model, clustering of ligand bound death receptors was modeled in an
effective manner and is governed by a free energy parameter (Edd). Explicit simulation of
lipid-mediated interactions would allow us to simulate novel strategies to target the
membrane proximal signaling modules in cancer cells (Gajate and Mollinedo 2011; Song
et al. 2007; Thome et al. 2012; Xiao et al. 2011; Gulbins and Kolesnick 2003).
We considered the effect of cell-type specific variations in the membrane module on
death ligand induced apoptotic activation. However, cell-to-cell variations in the
expression levels of signaling molecules (such as the level of death receptors (Meng et al.
2011)) can be significant even within a specific cell type. Such cellular variability may
arise from epigenetic regulations and stochastic gene expressions. Based on our results it
can be inferred that cell-to-cell variations in the membrane module for a given cell
population (of the same type) should also impact the type 1/type 2 choice in apoptotic
activation. Therefore, even within a cell population of the same type, one cell equipped
with higher level of death receptor and membrane proximal pro-apoptotic molecules may
activate the type 1 pathway whereas another cell having lower level of death receptor and
other pro-apoptotic membrane molecules might exhibit the type 2 signaling phenotype.
Interestingly, such type 1/type 2 variations at the level of single cells can also result from
inherent stochastic variability, even when all the cellular parameters (such as the
concentrations of membrane molecules) remain identical. Cell-to-cell variability in the
time-to-caspase 8 activation (resulting from inherent stochastic fluctuations), for
example, can impact the type 1/type 2 choice at the level of single cells. The regulation of
type 1/ type 2 choice at the level of single cells is an unexpected feature that emerged
from stochastic Monte Carlo modeling.
Cell-to-cell stochastic variability has emerged as a key systems level regulatory
mechanism in type 2 apoptosis. Thus the question of type 1/type 2 choice, in apoptotic
activation, is frequently linked to the choice between stochastic (large cell-to-cell
variability) and deterministic activation. In this work, we elucidated that the inherent state
of membrane proximal signaling module and concentration of death ligand affect cell-tocell variability in apoptotic activation. How cell-to-cell variability can be utilized to
target the apoptotic pathway in treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders
remains to be explored. In our previous studies, we have explored potential options for
inducing stochastic to deterministic transition (or at least minimize stochastic variability),
selectively in cancer cells (Skommer et al. 2011a; Raychaudhuri and Das 2013;
Raychaudhuri and Raychaudhuri 2013). It was also indicated that cell-to-cell inherent
	  

13	  

variability should help protect normal cells during cancer chemotherapy. In a similar
manner, strategies based on utilization of cell-to-cell variability might be effective in
protecting cells from apoptosis in neurodegenerative disorders.
Application of death ligands (such as TRAIL), to induce apoptotic activation in cancer
cells, has been established as a chemotherapeutic strategy (Picarda et al. 2012; Shirley et
al. 2011; Kurita et al. 2011). However, one needs to consider how to selectively target
cancer cells and minimize fractional cell killing. In certain cancer cells, increased
expression of death receptors and/or decreased amount of decoy receptor can enhance
susceptibility of the cancer cell’s membrane module to external apoptotic stimuli (Pan et
al. 1997; Sheridan et al. 1997). Such a mechanism presumably explains selective killing
of cancer cells observed under TRAIL induction. In addition, vulnerability of the
membrane module can be selectively induced (or increased) in some types of cancer
cells, such as by increasing the death receptor expression by genetic mechanisms (Ho et
al. 2010). However, anti-apoptotic molecules in the membrane proximal signaling
module, such as cFLIP, are also frequently over-expressed in cancer cells imparting
apoptosis resistance in those cancer cells (Safa and Pollok 2011). In those cases, selective
killing of cancer cells can be achieved by simultaneous targeting of a susceptible
membrane module and inhibition of cFLIP. In this context, recombinant death ligands or
monoclonal antibodies to death receptors (Picarda et al. 2012), having low affinity for
death receptors, can be utilized to increase specificity of targeting cancer cells. When we
simulate apoptotic activation of susceptible cancer cells having increased death receptor
expression (~ 100 molecules) but no cFLIP (also over-expressed Bcl2 family pro- and
anti-apoptotic proteins), under the application of small amount of death ligands (~ 2
molecules) with low affinity (~ 103 M-1 compared to 109 M-1 for typical death ligands),
rapid type 1 dominant activation was observed (82% cell death in 108 MC steps). In
contrast, apoptotic activation in a normal cell with lower death receptor expression (~10
molecules) but significant cFLIP (~ 30 nM) expression was much lower (7% cell death in
108 MC steps). In addition, the slow activation was dominated by the type 2 pathway
with large cell-to-cell stochastic variability. There might exist other mechanisms of
perturbing the susceptible membrane module of the apoptotic pathway, such as by
combined targeting of death receptors and lipid rafts in a synergistic manner, to induce
selective activation in cancer cells. Such selective targeting of the cancer cells can be
achieved if only weak type 2 activation is induced in normal cells (where slow activation
with large cell-to-cell variability should provide protection).
Caspase 6 activation has been frequently observed in neural cells undergoing
degeneration and caspase 6 inhibition is emerging as a promising novel strategy in
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (Leblanc 2013). In this study of
death ligand induced apoptosis, we considered systems level feedback regulation
mediated by active caspase 6. Even if the apoptotic trigger is located in the intrinsic (type
2) pathway, caspase 6 mediated activation of caspase 8 can start direct processing of procaspase 3 (type 1 activation). Here, we showed how the activation can be switched from
type 1 to type 2 under caspase 6 inhibition. Such a strategy, based on systems level
regulatory mechanisms and cell-to-cell stochastic variability, could protect a large
fraction of cells by minimally perturbing the apoptotic pathway and might turn out to be
effective under certain situations. How regulation of cell-to-cell variability can be utilized
	  

14	  

to protect cells in neurodegenerative disorders remains to be explored. Recent studies
indicated the possibility of caspase 6 self-activation in the context of neurodegenerative
disorders (Leblanc 2013). However, over-pressed caspase 6 was thought to be required
(for such self-processing) which would implicate low probability of activation and a role
of stochastic variability (Raychaudhuri et al. 2008; Raychaudhuri and Das 2013). In silico
studies, such as the Monte Carlo simulations carried out in this work, can be utilized to
design optimal strategies for targeting of the apoptotic pathway based on elucidation of
its systems level regulatory mechanisms.

Figure 1. Schematic of the apoptotic death signaling network. Death ligand induction
activates apoptosis through two distinct pathways: type 1 (intrinsic) and type 2
(extrinsic). The type 1-type 2 signaling loop is initiated by generation of active caspase 8
and ultimately converges on caspase 3/7 activation. Caspase 6 provides a systems level
feedback activation.
Figure 2. Type 1 activation fraction (upper panel) and caspase 8 activation (lower panel)
for increasing death receptor levels. Type 1 activation is estimated when active caspase 3
concentration reaches 90 nM (90% activation). Death receptor concentration is varied in
the following manner: 2, 10 and 100 molecules (death ligand concentration is kept fixed
at 10 molecules). Type 1 activation correlates well with caspase 8 activation at T = 108
MC steps (lower panel). For caspase 8, activation is normalized to its maximal value (~
30 nM). Data is obtained from 60 single cell experiments (Monte Carlo runs).
Figure 3. (a) Time-course of caspase 3 activation for low death receptor concentration.
Data is shown for 6 representative (type 2 dominant) cells when DR = 2 molecules. Each
color corresponds to apoptosis activation for a single cell (Monte Carlo run). (b) Caspase
3 and caspase 8 activation at a single cell level. Data is shown for 3 representative (type 2
dominant) cells (DR = 2 molecules). Caspase 8 activation precedes caspase 3 activation
and contributes cell-to-cell variability in apoptosis activation. (c) Time-to-caspase 8
activation is correlated to time-to-caspase 3 activation at a single cell level. Time-tocaspase 8 activation captures the initiation of caspase 8 activation (caspase 8 = 1); Timeto-caspase 3 activation is for initial (10% of total) caspase 3 activation. Data is shown for
60 single cell experiments (Monte Carlo runs). A straight line fit to the data indicates
high degree of correlation between initiation of caspase 8 activation and early caspase 3
activation.
Figure 4. Type 1 activation fraction (upper panel) and caspase 8 activation (lower panel)
as the membrane proximal signaling module is varied. Simulations were carried out for
the following parameters: (1) FADD = 10, cFLIP = 10 and procaspase 8 = 10, (2) FADD
= 100, cFLIP = 100 and procaspase 8 = 100 and (3) FADD = 100, cFLIP = 10 and
procaspase 8 = 100 (DL = 10 molecules and DR = 10 molecules). Type 1 activation is
estimated when active caspase 3 concentration reaches 90 nM (90% activation). Type 1
activation correlates well with caspase 8 activation at T = 5 × 107 MC steps. For caspase
8, activation is normalized to a value of 30 nM. Data is obtained from 60 single cell
experiments (Monte Carlo runs).
Figure 5. Type 1 activation fraction for various death ligand concentrations. Death ligand
concentration is varied in the following manner: (a) 2 molecules, (b) 10 molecules and (c)
100 molecules. For each of the death ligand concentration death receptor concentration is
varied in a similar manner: 2 molecules, 10 molecules and 100 molecules. Type 1
activation is estimated when active caspase 3 concentration reaches 90 nM (90%
activation). Data is obtained from 60 single cell experiments (Monte Carlo runs).

Figure 6. Time-course of caspase 3 activation for low death ligand concentration. Data is
shown for 6 representative (type 2 dominant) cells for DL = 2 molecules (DR = 100
molecules). Each color corresponds to apoptosis activation for a single cell (Monte Carlo
run).
Figure 7. (a) Effect of caspase 6 activation on type 1 mode of activation. Type 1
activation is estimated when active caspase 3 concentration reaches 90 nM (90%
activation). Data is shown for two different receptor-ligand concentrations: (1) DL=2
molecules, DR=2 molecules and (2) DL=10 molecules, DR=10 molecules (with and
without caspase 6; for each receptor-ligand concentration histogram on the right is with
caspase 6). (b) Activation of caspase 6 as the receptor-ligand concentration is varied.
Data is shown for three different time-points (T = 5 × 107, T = 1 × 108 and T = 2 × 108
MC steps) and two different receptor-ligand concentrations: (1) DL=2 molecules, DR=2
molecules and (2) DL=10 molecules, DR=10 molecules. Activation of caspase 6 is
normalized to its maximal value (~ 30 nM). Data is obtained from 60 single cell
experiments (Monte Carlo runs). (c) Activation of caspase 8 (upper panel) and caspase 3
(lower panel) with and without caspase 6. Data is shown for three different time-points (T
= 5 × 107, T = 1 × 108 and T = 2 × 108 MC steps) and two different receptor-ligand
concentrations: (1) left panel: DL=2 molecules, DR=2 molecules and (2) right panel:
DL=10 molecules, DR=10 molecules. Activation is normalized to respective maximal
values (30 nM for caspase 8 and 100 nM for caspase 3). Data is obtained from 60 single
cell experiments (Monte Carlo runs).
