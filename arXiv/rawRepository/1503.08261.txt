Dynamics of p53 is known to play important roles in the regulation of cell fate decisions in response
to various stresses, and PDCD5 functions as a co-activator of p53 to modulate the p53 dynamics.
In the present paper, we investigate how p53 dynamics are modulated by PDCD5 during the DNA
damage response using methods of bifurcation analysis and potential landscape. Our results reveal
that p53 activities can display rich dynamics under different PDCD5 levels, including monostability,
bistability with two stable steady states, oscillations, and co-existence of a stable steady state and
an oscillatory state. Physical properties of the p53 oscillations are further shown by the potential
landscape, in which the potential force attracts the system state to the limit cycle attractor, and
the curl flux force drives the coherent oscillation along the cyclic. We also investigate the effect of
PDCD5 efficiency on inducing the p53 oscillations. We show that Hopf bifurcation is induced by
increasing the PDCD5 efficiency, and the system dynamics show clear transition features in both
barrier height and energy dissipation when the efficiency is close to the bifurcation point. This
study provides a global picture of how PDCD5 regulates p53 dynamics via the interaction with the
p53-Mdm2 oscillator and can be helpful in understanding the complicate p53 dynamics in a more
complete p53 pathway.

INTRODUCTION

The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in cellular responses to various stress, including oxidative stress,
hypoxia, telomere erosion and DNA damage [1, 2]. In
unstressed cells, p53 is kept at low level via its negative regulator Mdm2 [3]. Under stressed conditions,
such as DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and activated
to induce the express of downstream genes, including
p21/WAF1/CIP1 and GADD45 that are involved in cell
cycle arrest, and PUMA, Bax and PIG3 that can induce apoptosis [4–6]. The cell fate decisions after DNA
damage are closely related to the p53 dynamics that is
regulated by p53-Mdm2 interactions [7, 8]. Oscillations
of p53 level have been observed upon IR induced DNA
damage at the population level in several human cell lines
and transgenic mice [7, 9, 10]. More interestingly, pulses
of p53 level were revealed in individual MCF7 cells, and
it was suggested that the cell fate is governed by the

number of p53 pulses, i.e., few pulses promote cell survival, whereas sustained pulses induce apoptosis [11, 12].
Fine control of p53 dynamics is crucial for proper cellular
response. Mutations and deregulation of p53 expression
have been found to associate with various cancer types
[13, 14].
Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5), formerly referred
to as TFAR19 (TF-1 cell apoptosis-related gene 19), is
known to promote apoptosis in different cell types in response to various stimuli [15]. Decreased expression of
PDCD5 has been detected in various human tumors [16–
18], and restoration of PDCD5 with recombinant protein
or an adenovirus expression vector can significantly sensitive different cancers to chemotherapies [18, 19]. PDCD5
is rapidly upregulated after DNA damage, interacts with
the apoptosis pathway, and translocates from the cytoplasm to nucleus during the early stages of apoptosis
[20–22]. Recently, novel evidence indicates that PDCD5
is a p53 regulator during gene expression and cell cycle [23]. It was shown that PDCD5 interacts with p53
by inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and accelerating the Mdm2 degradation. Hence, upon DNA
damage, PDCD5 can function as a co-activator of p53 to
regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
A series of computational models have been con-

structed to investigate the mechanism of p53-mediated
cell-fate decision [7, 8, 11, 12, 24, 25]. In these models
the p53-Mdm2 oscillation was considered to be crucial
for cell-fate decision after DNA damage. After DNA
damage, such as double strand breaks (DSBs), active
ATM monomer (ATM*) become dominant. In the nucleus, ATM* active p53 in two ways: ATM* promotes
the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 [26] and accelerates the degradation of Mdm2 in nucleus (Mdm2nuc ) [27].
In the cytoplasm, active p53 induces the production of
Mdm2cyt , which in turn promotes the translation of p53
mRNA to form a positive feedback. The p53-Mdm2 oscillation is a consequence of the two coupled feedback loops:
the negative-feedback between p53 and Mdm2nuc , and
the positive-feedback between p53 and Mdm2cyt . Recently, mathematical models of how PDCD5 interacts
with the DNA damage response pathway to regulate cell
fate decisions have been developed [28, 29]. In our previous study [29], a model for the effect of PDCD5 to the
p53 pathway has been established through a nonlinear
dynamics model that is developed based on the module of p53-Mdm2 oscillator in [11, 12] and experimental
findings in [23]. It was shown that the p53 activity can
display different dynamics after DNA damage depending on the PDCD5 level. The p53 protein shows low
activity in case of PDCD5 deletion, sustain intermediate
level for medial PDCD5 expression, and pulses when the
PDCD5 level is upregulated [29]. Nevertheless, little is
known about the global p53 dynamics upon PDCD5 interactions with changes in the expression levels of p53
and PDCD5, which is often seen in tumors.
Here, we investigate, based on the mathematical model
proposed in [29], how the dynamics of p53 activity after
DNA damage depend on changes in the levels of p53 production and PDCD5. A global bifurcation analysis shows
that p53 activity can display various dynamics depending on the p53 production and PDCD5 levels, including
monostability, bistability with two stable steady states,
oscillations, and co-existence of a stable steady state and
an oscillatory state. These dynamics are further investigated through the method of potential landscape. The
stability of the oscillation states are characterized by the
potential force and the probability flux. We also discuss
the effect of PDCD5 efficiency on p53 dynamics. PDCD5
efficiency can induce p53 oscillation by Hopf bifurcation,
and the transition of p53 dynamics near the Hopf bifurcation are charaterized by barrier height and energy
dissipation.

nents: active p53 in the nucleus [p53], Mdm2 in the
nucleus [Mdm2nuc ] and in cytoplasm [Mdm2cyt ]. After
DNA damage, ATM is activated and promotes the degradation of Mdm2nuc so that the p53 level is unregulated.
Active p53 promotes the production of Mdm2cyt , which
promotes the translation of p53 mRNA to produce p53
and hence form a positive-feedback loop. In the nucleus,
active p53 is degraded slowly at a rate dp53 by weakly
binding to Mdm2nuc , and the interaction is disrupted
by PDCD5. Moreover, PDCD5 can also accelerate the
degradation of Mdm2nuc . Mdm2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm can shuttle between the two compartments at
rates kin and kout , respectively. These interactions give
the following differential equations:

Potential landscape and probability flux

The ideas of potential landscape have been introduced
for uncovering global principles in biology for protein
dynamics [30], interactions [31, 32], and gene networks
[33–35]. For a non-equilibrium open systems such as the
p53-Mdm2 oscillator that exchanges energies and informations with outside environments, the potential and
non-equilibrium probability flux are able to reveal insights for the global robustness and physical mechanisms

RESULTS

Codimension-two bifurcation analysis

To investigate how PDCD5 interacts with p53 to regulate cell fate decision dynamics after DNA damage, we
performed codimension-two bifurcation analysis with respect to the two parameters P0 and v̄p53 . The bifurcation diagrams were computed with AUTO incorporated
in XPPAUT [36]. The main bifurcation diagram is shown

4
at Fig. 2 and detailed below, with Fig. 2b the enlarge of
the dashed square region in Fig. 2a.
The parameter plane (v̄p53 , P0 ) is divided into ten regions labelled I –X each with different dynamical profiles
and marked with different colors in Fig. 2 (refer Fig. 2b
for regions V III-X). Typical dynamics of each region is
shown at Fig. 3 and described below:

and the unstable steady state with low p53 level
becomes stable, but the unstable limit cycle immediately disappear due to homoclinic bifurcation
(refer the curve hc1 in Fig. 2a which is very close
to subh1 ). From region I and crossing the boundary f1− , a pair of stable and unstable steady states
appear due to fold bifurcation of equilibria.

1. Region I corresponds to monostability with a single
stable steady state of low p53 activity despite the
expression level of PDCD5.

8. There are three regions (VIII -X ) around
(v̄p53 , P0 ) = (1.06, 0.41) which share the same
phase diagram with a stable limit cycle and three
steady states (Fig. 2b). In region VIII the
three steady states are unstable, two of them (a
saddle and an unstable focus) come from the fold
bifurcation (f1+ ) that separates regions III and
VIII. In region IX the steady state with high
p53 level becomes stable and is surrounded by an
unstable limit cycle. The change is originated from
the subcritical Hopf bifurcation subh2 from region
VIII. Finally, the unstable limit cycle disappear
in region X due to the homoclinic bifurcation hc2
between regions IX and X. We note that in regions
IX and X, there are bistable states of a stable
steady state and a stable limit cycle, similar to the
region IV.

2. In region II there is a stable steady state and two
unstable steady states. Regions I and II are separated by a curve f1∗ of saddle-node bifurcation,
across which an unstable node and a saddle appear
due to fold bifurcation.
3. Region III is on the right of region II. Crossing the
curve snic from region II, the stable node and the
saddle collide and disappear, accompanied by the
emergence of a stable limit cycle that surrounds an
unstable steady state. Meanwhile, parameters can
also change from region I to III crossing the boundary suph1 or subh1 , respectively (Fig. 2b). The
curve suph1 represents supercritical Hopf bifurcation at which the stable steady state in region I
becomes unstable and a stable limit cycle appears.
The curve subh1 represents subcritical Hopf bifurcation. Before crossing the curve subh1 , two limit
cycles, stable and unstable ones, come out due to
fold bifurcation of limit cycles that is represented
by the curve lpc1 (Fig. 2b). Next, the unstable
limit cycle disappear and the stable steady state
lose its stability when at the curve subh1 .
4. Regions III and IV are separated by a subcritical
Hopf bifurcation curve subh2 by which an unstable
limit cycle appears and locates between the stable
limit cycle and the steady state, and the steady
state that is unstable at region III becomes stable
at region IV.
5. Region V, similar to region I, has a stable steady
state which corresponds to a state of high p53 concentration. The two limit cycles at region IV collide and disappear when parameters cross the fold
bifurcation curve lpc2 that separates regions IV
and V.
6. Three steady states arise in region VI, two of them
are unstable and appear while crossing the fold bifurcation curve f2 of equilibria between regions VI
and V.
7. Region VII gives bistability in p53 activity, including two stable steady states with low or high
p53 concentrations, and an unstable steady state.
There are two ways to reach this bistable region.
From region VI and crossing the subcritical Hopf
bifurcation subh1 , an unstable limit cycle emerges

In addition to the above ten regions, there are four
codimension-two bifurcation points denoted by black
dots in Fig. 2: two cusp points (CP1 and CP2 ), one
Generalized Hopf bifurcation (GH) and one BogdanovTakens bifurcation (BT). The cusp point CP1 locates
at (v̄p53 , P0 ) = (0.6464, 0.508) where the fold bifurcation curve f1∗ and the saddle-node homoclinic bifurcation
curve snic meet tangentially. The other cusp point CP2
is given by (1.0220, 0.4267) by the two fold bifurcation
curves f1 and f2 , where two fold bifurcations coalesce and
disappear. The point GH at (1.0071, 0.4) corresponds to
the meeting point of suph1 and subh1 from where a fold
bifurcation curve of the limit cycle (lpc1 ) occurs. At the
BT point (1.0885, 0.3873) the fold bifurcation curve f1
and subh2 meet tangentially to give a homoclinic bifurcation curve hc2 . The BT point separates f1 into two
segments f1− and f1+ . Crossing f1− from left to right
gives a stable equilibrium and a saddle, while crossing
f1+ gives an unstable equilibrium and a saddle [37].
In summary, by manipulating the expression level of
PDCD5 and the maximum production rate of p53, the
system displays four types of stable dynamics: a single
stable steady state (regions I, II, V, and VI ), two stable
steady states (region VII ), a stable limit cycle (regions
III and VIII ), and coexistence of a stable steady state
and a stable limit cycle (regions IV, IX, and X ). The
bifurcation diagram is zoomed out by codimension-one
bifurcations with seven P0 values marked by a-g in Fig.
2 and are detailed at the next section.
From Fig. 2, during DNA damage and when the
PDCD5 is upregulated (P0 > 0.3873), the system shows
either low p53 activity, p53 oscillation, or sustained high
p53 level with the increasing of p53 production rate. p53

oscillations have been known to be essential for cellular response to DNA damage including DNA repair and
apoptosis [8, 11, 38, 39]. Our analyses suggest that
proper cell response to DNA damage with p53 oscillation
is possible only when PDCD5 is highly expressed and the
p53 production rate takes proper value. To further investigate the oscillation dynamics, Fig. 4 shows the period
and amplitude of the stable limit cycles corresponding to
regions III and IV in Fig. 2. The results show that the
oscillation periods decrease with the maximum p53 production rate (v̄p53 ), while the amplitudes increase with
v̄p53 . This is consistent with the experimental observations [40]. However both periods and amplitudes are insensitive with the PDCD5 level over a wide parameter
range. These results indicates that upregulated PDCD5
and a proper p53 expression level are essential for producing proper p53 oscillation that regulates the cellular
response to DNA damage.
When PDCD5 is downregulated (P0 < 0.3873), the
system has either a single steady state with low p53 activity or bistability with either low or high p53 activity after
DNA damage depending on the maximum p53 production rate. Experiments have shown that cells exposed to
sustained p53 signaling frequently underwent senescence
[39].
B.

Codimension-one bifurcation analysis

To get a clear insight into the codimension-two bifurcation diagram in Fig. 2, we considered a codimension-

one bifurcation of the concentration of p53 with respect
to the p53 production rate v̄p53 . The bifurcation diagram is shown at Fig. 5, with panels a-g for given values
P0 = 0.3, 0.39, 0.41, 0.42, 0.48, 0.51, 0.8, respectively, as
marked at Fig. 2. Diagrams for each P0 value is detailed
below.
(a). For low PDCD5 level (P0 = 0.3), the equilibrium
show a S-shaped bifurcation diagram with bistability
(Fig. 5a). There are three branches of the equilibrium depending on v̄p53 . The upper branch is composed of stable nodes, states at the middle branch
are saddles, while the lower branch consists of stable
nodes and foci which are separated near the subcritical Hopf bifurcation point H1 (v̄p53 = 2.315). There
is a fold bifurcation of equilibria F1 (v̄p53 = 1.143)
where a stable node and a saddle appear, so that
bistability occurs with v̄p53 between F1 and H1 .
With the increasing of v̄p53 , an unstable limit cycle
appears from a homoclinic bifurcation point HC1 at
a saddle (v̄p53 = 2.239), and the unstable limit cycle disappears via the subcritical Hopf bifurcation
H1 . Crossing H1 , stable focus at the lower branch
change to unstable one. The saddle and the lower
unstable focus collide and disappear via another fold
bifurcation F2 at v̄p53 = 3.305.
(b). When P0 increases (P0 = 0.39) (Fig. 5b), the fold
bifurcation F1 becomes larger than the subcritical
Hopf bifurcation H1 so that the bistability of equilibrium vanishes. With the increasing of v̄p53 , an unstable limit cycle arises from the Hopf bifurcation H1 .

branch) and an unstable focus (the upper branch)
(Fig. 5b inset). The unstable focus on the upper
branch becomes stable and an unstable limit cycle
appears via the subcritical Hop bifurcation H2 . The
unstable limit cycle develops until it meet the saddle at the homoclinic bifurcation point HC2 . The
stable focus and stable limit cycle coexist with v̄p53
between H2 and LP C2 , which gives the region X in
Fig. 2.

(c). When P0 increases to 0.41 (Fig. 5c), the diagram
is similar but the Hopf bifurcation H1 changes from
subcritical to supercritical, so that stable limit cycles
exist with v̄p53 taken values over a wide range from
H1 to LP C2 .

The limit cycle becomes stable at the fold bifurcation

(e). For a larger P0 (Fig. 5e), the two fold bifurcation
points F1 and F2 coalesce and disappear due to a
codimension-two cusp point CP2 in Fig. 2.
(f). With the further increasing of P0 (Fig. 5f), another
two fold bifurcation points (F1∗ and F2∗ ) arise from
the Hopf bifurcation H1 due to the cusp point CP1
in Fig. 2.
(g). Further increasing P0 to higher level (P0 = 0.8), the
supercritical Hopf bifurcation point H1 moves to the
left and collides with F2∗ to give a fold-Hopf bifurcation point (ZH ), and then F2∗ changes to a saddlenode homoclinic bifurcation point SNIC, from which
the saddle and the node collide and disappear to generate a stable limit cycle.
The above bifurcation analyses present the global dynamics of the whole system, which is further explored below through the underlying potential landscape [30, 31].

cell fate decision in response to various stresses. To further analyze the potential landscape when the system
display stable p53 oscillations, we examined the case at
region III by calculating the potential force (−∇U ) and
the probability flux (Jss ) (see Fig. 7). As shown at
Fig. 7, the potential has local minimum valley along
the deterministic oscillation trajectory. The values of
potential are not uniformly distributed along the cycle.
There is a global minimal potential at a state around
([p53, [Mdm2]) = (1, 0.02), which with small curl flux
forces are large potential forces. The states with larger
[p53] or [Mdm2] have higher potential, larger curl flux
forces and smaller potential forces. We note that the
potential forces are mostly vertical to the cycle path,
and the curl flux forces are along the cycle. These results suggest that potential forces tend to attract the
system states to the oscillation trajectory, while the curl
flux forces drive the oscillation along the cyclical trajectory. The obvious low potential value at the global
minimum indicates a pulse dynamics in each cycle the
system states mostly stay at the state of global minimum while go through the other part of the limit cycle
quickly. This pulse dynamics is in agree with previous
studies in [11, 29].

Potential landscapes and global dynamics

To explore the global dynamics from the potential perspective, we projected the potential function to two independent variables, the p53 concentration [p53], and
the total Mdm2 concentration [Mdm2] = [Mdm2cyt ] +
[Mdm2nuc ]. The potential landscapes for parameter values taken from the 10 typical regions are shown at Fig.
6.
The potential landscapes show that when there is a
single stable steady state (I, II, V, VI ), the potential is
funnelled towards a global minimum which corresponds
to the global stable steady state.
In region VII, there are two stable steady states, and
the potential has two local minimum, corresponding to
high or low p53 levels, respectively. The landscape at low
p53 state has wide attractive region and shallow slop,
while at the high p53 state has small attractive region
and deep slope. These suggest that a cell from randomly
select initial state is more likely to response with low p53
state because of the wider attractive region.
In other regions with p53/Mdm2 oscillations (III, IV,
VIII, IX, X ), the potential landscapes show an irregular
and inhomogeneous closed ring valley that corresponds to
the deterministic stable limit cycle trajectory. It is obvious that the landscape is not uniformly distributed along
the limit cycle path due to the inhomogeneous speed on
the limit cycle [33, 41]. We also note that in the landscapes for regions IV, IX and X, in addition to the closed
valley, there is a deep funnel towards a local minimum.
These local minimum show the coexistence of the stable
steady state (marked by P and the arrows in Fig. 6).
The regions with p53 oscillations are the most interested because the oscillation dynamics are essential for

D.

Effects of PDCD5 regulation efficiency

PDCD5 interacts with the p53 pathway by promoting p53 stability through the disruption of the reaction
between p53 and Mdm2nuc . In our model, the p53 degradation rate function is given by a Hill-type function and
the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) is dependent on PDCD5 concentration given by Eq. (4). In
this function, the efficiency of PDCD5 is represented by
the coefficient α1 , larger α1 indicates higher efficiency. To
investigate the effects of PDCD5 regulation efficiency, we
took (v̄p53 , P0 ) = (0.85, 0.8) and changed α1 from zero to
triple the default value to examine its effect on system
dynamics.
Fig. 8a shows the bifurcation diagram of p53 with respect to the efficiency α1 . There is a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation (α1 = 1.612) as α1 increases, where a stable
limit cycle appears to yield p53 oscillations. The oscillation amplitude is insensitive with α1 . The period increase
rapidly near the Hopf bifurcation transition, and then decreases to 350min when α1 increases away the bifurcation
point (Fig. 8b).
To further study the stability of p53 oscillation, we
calculated the barrier height in the potential landscape,
which is a good measure of the stability of limit cycles
[33]. The barrier height (BH) is defined by the potential
function as BH = Umax − Umin , where Umax is the maximum potential inside the stable limit cycle, and Umin
is the minimum potential along the cycle [33]. Higher
barrier height means more stable. Fig. 8c shows the
barrier height versus α1 . In our simulation, the barrier height is highly fluctuated near the Hopf bifurcation

(1.612 < α1 < 2.6), and then decreases towards a value
of about 8.78.
Next, we considered the effect of α1 to the dissipation
of energy, which measures the inevitability for an open
nonequilibrium system due to exchanging information
and energies with its surrounding. The
R mean rate of energy dissipation (hd ) is give by hd = F(X) · J(X, t)dX,
where F is the driving force, and J the probability flux
vector. According to [42], the energy dissipation is equal
to the entropy production rate (ep ) at equilibrium state.
Therefore, the energy dissipation can be used to obtain
a global physical characterization of the nonequilibrium
systems. Fig. 8d shows the dissipation versus α1 . The
dissipation equals zero when α1 is smaller than the Hopf
bifurcation value and there is a single steady state. This
shows the detail balance at equilibrium state, in consistent with the fact that the least dissipation cost gives a
more stable system in general [43]. When α1 increases

beyond the Hopf bifurcation (α1 > 1.612), the energy
dissipation increases rapidly to maximum at α1 = 2.6,
and then decreases to and sustain at 2 × 10−7 with α1
increasing.

In summary, these results show clearly transition dynamics when the system switches from a single stable
steady state to a stable limit cycle with the increasing
of PDCD5 efficiency. During the transition, the steady
state is destabilized to yield p53 oscillations, both oscillation periods and energy dissipations first increase rapidly
and then decrease to a sustain level, and the barrier
height shows large fluctuation in the transition region.
After the PDCD5 efficiency increases beyond the transition region, the system dynamics is insensitive to the
efficiency.

CONCLUSIONS

The dynamics of tumor suppressor p53 plays important
roles in the regulation of cell fate decision in response to
various stresses[44]. PDCD5 is known to interact with
the p53 pathway and functions as a co-activator in p53
regulations. In p53 pathways, the p53-Mdm2 oscillator is
crucial for cell response to DNA damage. In this study,
we have systematically studied effects of PDCD5 to the
p53-Mdm2 oscillator by methods of bifurcation analyses and potential landscapes. Our results reveal that the
p53-Mdm2 oscillator can display monostability and bistability under low PDCD5 expression. When PDCD5 level
is upregulated (for example, by DNA damage), p53 oscillations emerge by Hopf bifurcation, and bistability with
the coexistence of both stable oscillation and a stable
steady state is possible for proper PDCD5 level and p53
synthesis rate. These results were further verified by the
potential landscapes, which clearly show the transition
of landscapes with changing parameter values. We have

also investigate the effects of PDCD5 efficiency in the
interaction with p53 pathway, we showed that p53 oscillations can only be induced only when the efficiency
is larger than a critical values of Hopf bifurcation, and
the system dynamics show clear transition features in
both barrier height and energy dissipation when the efficiency is close to the bifurcation point. Such abnormal
behaviours at the transition region have been highlighted
in recent years in the application of prediction and early
diagnosis of complex diseases [45–47].

In this study we have focused on the PDCD5-regulated
p53 dynamics in the p53-Mdm2 oscillator. Our results reveal global p53 dynamics mediated by PDCD5 and the
levels of p53 production. However, a more complete p53
pathway is certainly necessary in understanding cell fate
decisions in response to DNA damage. Further consideration of the effects of PDCD5 on a complete p53 network
is certainly required in future studies.
