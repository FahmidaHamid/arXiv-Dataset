We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study the effect of variable rigidity on plectoneme formation
and localization in supercoiled dsDNA. We show that the presence of soft sequences increases the
number of plectoneme branches and that the edges of the branches tend to be localized at these
sequences. We propose an experimental approach to test our results in vitro, and discuss the possible
role played by plectoneme localization in the search process of transcription factors for their targets
(promoter regions) on the bacterial genome.

The conformational properties of double-stranded (ds)
DNA molecules are usually modeled by treating these
biopolymers as semi-flexible chains with uniform rigidity
that can be represented by a single persistence length
(rigidity is proportional to persistence length), lp '
50nm in physiological conditions (1, 2). This is justified when one is interested in large-scale properties of dsDNA for which one can replace the sequence-dependent
distribution of the elastic rigidity by its average over the
chain. When one is interested in small and intermediatescale phenomena one has to consider the full sequencedependence of the rigidity. While some studies suggested
that the rigidity of bare dsDNA varies across a limited
range 40nm < lp < 75nm (3, 4), experiments on cyclization of short dsDNA fragments (≈ 100bp) reported much
higher cyclization ratios than expected (5, 6). This led to
the proposal of DNA kinks – pointlike highly flexible domains (7) – perhaps due to formation of “DNA bubbles”
(8, 9). Such sequence-dependent rigidity is a property
of bare dsDNA and it has been suggested that the effect
can be utilized for the design of promoter sequences in
order to control the DNA binding affinity of transcription factors that are sensitive to DNA bendability (10).
It may also arise as the consequence of the binding of
proteins to specific DNA sequences; indeed, in vivo DNA
is partially covered by proteins that affect its flexibility
(3, 11–14) and/or its local curvature (15, 16). For example, RecA bacterial proteins polymerize along DNA
to give an effective persistence length of hundreds of nm
to the RecA-dsDNA complex (3, 14). Other positivelycharged proteins (e.g., HMGB) and polyamines, increase
DNA’s flexibility significantly (11, 17, 18). Thus, the
variability of DNA rigidity may be even higher in vivo
than that of bare DNA in vitro.
In this work we study the interplay between local rigidity and plectoneme localization in supercoiled dsDNA.
When circular DNA is subjected to sufficiently large torsional stress, the minimization of the free energy yields
strongly-writhed conformations known as plectonemes
(see e.g. Fig. 1). We show that the number of plectonemic branches and the locations of the edges (end
loops of the branches in Fig. 1) are affected by nonuniform DNA rigidity. This applies not only to circular
chains (e.g., bacterial and mitochondrial DNA, and DNA

localized at the soft domains.

plasmids), but to topologically-constrained linear dsDNA
molecules as well, such as eukaryotic chromosomes that
are attached to the nuclear lamina.
We performed Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of topology-conserving worm-like rod (WLR) model
that accounts for bending and twist elasticity of dsDNA.
A circular dsDNA molecule was modeled as a closed chain
of N segments of length 30bp ' 10nm each. The twist
persistence length of the chain was taken to be ltw =
74nm (corresponding to ˜ltw = 7.4 in units of segment
length). The effective diameter of dsDNA was assumed
to be 5nm, taking into account the screened electrostatic
repulsion at physiological conditions (19, 20). The degree
of supercoiling of DNA was characterized by the superhelix density σ that is proportional to the amount of torsional stress per unit length of the molecule (20, 21). Bacterial cells have an enzymatic mechanism that keeps the
superhelix density of the genome at an almost constant
value, typically in the range −0.03 < σ < −0.09 that
corresponds to somewhat unwound DNA (21, 22) and,

unless stated otherwise, we assumed that σ = −0.06.
For more details about the energy form used for accepting/rejecting the Metropolis MC steps see Sec. S1 in the
SI.
In the simulations we used the pivot (or crankshaft)
moves described in detail in ref. (5). The angle of rotation around the pivot was tuned in order to achieve the
desired acceptance rate of 50%. To make sure that the
simulation was not stuck in a specific plectonemic conformation, we used the linking number inversion method
described in ref. (24). We ran our simulations for 5400bp
long chains with segments of two different rigidities distributed along the chain such that most of the chain had
(h)
a higher rigidity (lp ), and a smaller part of the chain
(l)
had a lower rigidity (lp ). For each chain conformation
taken into account, we determined the number and the
locations of plectoneme edges (end loops). The algorithm
used for this analysis is described in the SI. The chains in
the simulations were unknotted and we made sure that
this topology was fixed during the simulation by calculating the Alexander polynomials and Vassiliev invariants
after each move, and rejecting topology-changing moves.
We first considered the effect of non-uniform rigidity
distribution on plectoneme localization in the case where
both the stiff and the soft domains are relatively large (as
for example in the RecA-DNA complexes). The soft domain was chosen to occupy 1/3 of the chain and consisted
of several domains of identical size, equally-spaced along
the contour. In order to model sequence-dependent rigid(l) (h)
ity of bare dsDNA we took (lp , lp ) = (40nm, 55nm) (as
in ref. (4)) and (55nm, 75nm) (as in ref. (3)). For modeling rigidity induced by protein polymerization along
(l) (h)
DNA we used (lp , lp ) = (50nm, 200nm) (even though

polymerization of proteins such as RecA yields rigidities
in the range of 600nm − 800nm (3, 14), the effect of
(h)
(l)
lp  lp on the localization of plectoneme edges is al(h)
ready clear for lp = 200nm). In Fig. 2 we plotted a histogram of the locations of the centers of plectoneme edges
for a chain with 4 soft domains. Even for the pair with
the smallest difference between rigidities (40nm, 55nm),
there is noticeable localization of the edges to the softer
segments of the chain. As the difference between rigidities increases, the localization becomes much more pro(l) (h)
nounced. For (lp , lp ) = (50nm, 200nm), the edges are
almost exclusively located in the soft domains. While
high superhelix density is a necessary condition for the
formation of plectonemes (21), we found that increasing
σ beyond the plectoneme formation threshold does not
have a noticeable effect on the localization of the edges
of these branches (see Fig. S5 in the SI).
For chains of uniform rigidity the number of plectonemic branches was shown to increase with σ (5). In order
to understand how the dependence of the number of chain
branches on σ is affected by non-uniform rigidity, we compared chains with 4 soft domains with uniform chains of a
single persistence length (weighted average of the pair of
the corresponding persistence lengths). We observed that
for the (50nm, 200nm) pair, the presence of soft domains
leads to two-fold enhancement compared to homogeneous
chains with an average value of lp = 150nm (the effect
is much weaker both for chains with lower rigidities and
those with a smaller difference between higher and lower
rigidities- see Fig. S3 in the SI). The origin of this effect is
that a chain with lp = 150nm has to pay a large bending
energy penalty in order to create a tight loop/edge and,
as a consequence, the number of edges is small. The presence of soft domains with lp = 50nm (even when the stiffness of the rest of the chain is increased), allows the edges
to be localized in these domains, thus decreasing the
bending energy penalty, and the number of branches increases significantly. The number of plectoneme branches
is also affected by the number of soft domains. We calculated the average number of branches as a function of the
number of soft domains for (40nm, 55nm), (55nm, 75nm)
and (50nm, 200nm), where the softer part of the chain
was divided into 2 − 6 domains of equal length, uniformly
distributed along the chain (Fig. S4 in the SI). As expected, only a minor effect is observed in the first two
cases where the difference between rigidities is small but
in the case of large rigidity contrast, the number of edges
increases by nearly 50% as the number of soft domains
increases from 2 to 6.
Next, we proceeded to characterize the effect of DNA
kinks (soft local defects) on the localization and the
number of plectoneme edges. We simulated 5400bp-long
chains with lp = 50nm, and with 2 − 6 kinks at which
the persistence length dropped to a value of 4nm (about
twice the rigidity of ssDNA, (9, 25)). As can be seen in

σ = −0.05 (light blue), σ = −0.06 (light green), σ = −0.07
(orange) and σ = −0.08 (red).

Fig. 3 for the 4-kink case (and for 2 − 6 kinks in Fig.
S6 in the SI), plectoneme edges tend to form at the locations of kinks. Another effect observed in Fig. 3 is that
in the 4-kink case the fraction of edges that contain kinks
decreases monotonicaly with |σ|, presumably because of
the number of branches increases monotonically with |σ|.
In the 6-kink case the decrease in the fraction of kinkcontaining edges is observed only for |σ| = 0.07 − 0.08
(Fig. S9 in the SI). This concurs with the observation
(Fig. S8 in the SI) that while in the 6-kink case the
number of edges is only slightly greater than the number
of kinks in the chain even for the highest value of |σ|, in
the 4-kinks case the number of edges exceeds the number
of kinks already for moderate |σ|s.
In Table I and in Figs. S6-S7 in the SI, we show that
as the number of kinks, nkink , increases, the number of
branches, nbranch , also grows, but this increment is accompanied by an even more rapid increase in the frac(tot)
tion of edges that include a kink, Pkink , and in the total
number of edges containing a kink, n∩ . Even though
plectonemes have branches even in the absence of kinks,
when supercoiled DNA contains kinks, the edges of the
branches are localized preferentially at the kinks; this reduces the bending energy penalty for creating edges and
promotes the formation of new branches.
As expected from experience with linear worm-like
chains, the presence of a kink affects the local fluctuations
of the chain in which it is imbedded. This effect is clearly
observed in Fig 4(a) where we compare the distribution
of the end-to-end distance d of a short DNA sequence
(in a long circular chain) of uniform rigidity, with that
of a DNA sequence of the same length and rigidity but
containing a kink at its center. Since the length of the
sequence is only twice the persistence length of dsDNA,

both distributions are asymmetric, with a peak closer
to the fully stretched (100nm) state. The introduction
of the kink shifts the maximum of the distribution from
80nm to 70nm and results in dramatic enhancement of
the ends contact probability (d ≤ 10nm), an effect that
has been invoked to explain the anomalously high cyclization probability of short dsDNA molecules(5–7). The
difference between the distributions becomes much more
pronounced in the presence of supercoiling. Since the end
loops of plectonemes tend to form around the kinks and
the size of the end loop is of order lp , we expect the ends
of the 100nm segment to be preferentially localized in
the stem of the plectoneme and the most probable endto-end separation will be below 10nm. This expectation
is fully confirmed in Fig. 4(b) in which we presented the
corresponding end-to-end distance distributions of supercoiled DNA for σ = −0.06 (the histograms for σ in the
range between 0 and −0.07 are shown in Fig. S10 in
the SI). While the distribution for the no-kink case is
qualitatively similar to that for σ = 0 (Fig 4(a)), the
peak of the distribution of a kink-containing segment is
shifted towards contact. In principle, this prediction can
be tested by FRET experiments by attaching donor and
acceptor molecules to the ends of a short (of order lp )
sequence in a long circular dsDNA molecule, provided
that one is able to design a sequence that has a high
propensity for forming a kink (26–29). In the absence
of supercoiling, the donor and acceptor will be separated
by tens of nanometers and there will be no FRET signal.
As torsional stress is introduced into the chain, e.g., by
raising the concentration of intercalators in the solution
(30, 31), plectonemes will form with end loops localized
at the kinks and the distance between the donor and
acceptor will approach the 6nm limit at which energy
transfer will take place and a FRET signal will be observed.
This localization effect may also play a significant role
in the search process executed by transcription factors
(TFs) that attach to specific sequences in promoter regions of DNA. Since bacterial DNA is supercoiled, DNA
segments that reside in the stems of the plectonemes

4
cording to our results, such sequences will tend to nucleate plectonemes and to be positioned at their edges. Finally, we would like to mention that although we are not
aware of direct experimental proof of our proposed mechanism of plectoneme localization to low-rigidity DNA sequences, there has been a recent experimental study of
the effects of torsional stress on stretched linear dsDNA
in which repeated hopping of plectonemes between specific locations along DNA was reported. (34).

are pressed against each other and one expects binding of proteins to these segments to be suppresed. The
looped ends of plectonemes are more accessible and, combined with the fact that many bacterial DNA-associated
proteins have a higher binding affinity to bent DNA
(16, 32, 33), this suggests that TFs may have a higher
affinity for end loops of plectonemes. Whether nature
utilizes such effects to facilitate the search of TFs for
their DNA binding sites depends on whether promoter
sites tend to be localized at the edges of plectonemes.
Indeed, many bacterial promoters contain TATA-box sequences that are known for their lower rigidity and higher
tendency to create DNA bubbles (kinks) (26–29) and, ac-

The Energy Form for the MC Process

In a discrete worm-like rod (WLR) model that accounts for both the bending diversity and twisting elasticity of
the DNA, the energy of a chain (in units of kB T ) with N segments is given by:

where ˜lp,n is the dimensionless bending persistence length corresponding to the (n, n + 1) dimer of segments, ˜ltw is the
dimensionless twist persistence length (both measured in units of the segment’s length ∆s), and κ̃n = 2[1−cos(θn,n+1 )]
(0)
is the dimensionless curvature between the nth and the (n+1)th segments. δ ω̃tw,n = ω̃tw,n − ω̃tw defines the difference
(0)
between the nth twist angle, ω̃tw,n , and its spontaneous value, ω̃tw . The twist angle is the sum of the first and the
third rotation angles (ω̃tw,n = ϕ + ψ) of the Euler transformation that rotates the nth segment to the (n + 1)th
segment, while the bending angle, θn,n+1 , is the second Euler rotation angle.
Topologically, supercoiled dsDNA could be described as a closed chain made of two strands infinitesimally closed
to each other. This kind of a chain obeys two topological constraints, i.e., the closure of each of its strands. Another
description for these topological constraints is given in terms of the closure of the center-line of the chain, and the
closure of the cross-sectional plane. These two constraints are fully accounted by the Fuller-White relation (1–3):
Lk = W r + T w.

(S2)

where the writhe W r is a measure of the deviation of the center-line from planarity, and the twist T w is proportional
to the the sum (in the discrete description) over all the twist angles along the chain. The continuum expressions for
T w and W r are given e.g., in (3). In their discrete version they take the forms:
1 X
Tw =
ω̃tw,n ,
(S3)
2π n
and:
Wr =

1 X
Wn,m ,
4π n,m

(S4)

S6
where Wn,m is the discrete pair-of-segments contribution to the W r, calculated e.g., in (4) (W r depends only on the
coordinates of the center-line of the chain).
For a circular chain, Lk is a topological invariant (an integer) that does not change as long as the topology of the
chain is maintained. A supercoiled dsDNA is overwound or unwound depending whether its Lk is higher or lower
P (0)
(0)
than the preferred value of overall twist, T w(0) = 1/2π n ω̃tw = N ω̃tw /2π. When the value of this difference,
(0)
∆Lk ≡ Lk − T w differs from zero, the chain becomes torsionally stressed and attempts to minimize its total free
energy by transforming some of its twist energy into bending energy and, when a critical value of torsional stress is
reached, plectonemes appear in the chain.
Since the twist angles of different segments are independent, one may average the twist along the chain by calculating
hδ ω̃tw,n i ' 2πT w/N = 2π(Lk − W r)/N , where Lk is a pre-determined topological constant, and the W r is calculated
using the center-line coordinates of the chain. The resulting twist energy, using ∆T w ≡ T w − T w(0) = ∆Lk − W r,
is then given by:
ET '

2π 2 ˜ltw
2π 2 ˜ltw
∆T w2 =
(∆Lk − W r)2 .

(S5)

Thus, the twist energy in our simulations is obtained by using only the coordinates of the center-line of the chain for
calculating W r, and plugging this value of W r (and the constant ∆Lk) into Eq. S5 to calculate ET .
Methods for Identifying Plectoneme Edge Location

The number and locations of plectoneme edges (end loops) were determined by two methods. In the first analysis
we used the method of calculation of local writhe, W r(loc) described in ref (5). Although W r of a chain is strictly
defined only for closed chains, one may calculate the Gauss double integral along shorter linear segments of length l
along the chain to obtain the local writhe associated with the jth monomer, W r(loc) (j). As shown in Fig. S1, the
function W r(loc) (j) has maxima at end loops (edges) of the plectoneme, and when the value of such a maximum
exceeds a threshold, W r(threshold) (the horizontal black dashed line in the figure), this monomer is marked as an edge
of the plectoneme (a sphere on the chain in the figure). The height of the peaks of W r(loc) depends both on the
length l of the segments for which we calculate the local writhe and on the superhelix density σ, since higher |σ|s
yield tighter loops resulting in higher local writhe values. Since we want the same threshold value, W r(threshold) , to
distinguish between edges to other segments for different σs, l must compensate for the σ-dependence of the heights
of the peaks. While in ref (5) the authors flattened the conformations to nearly planar ones before calculating the
number of edges, we wanted to analyze the three dimensional structures of the plectonemes, and hence, we used a
different function for l(σ) and a different value of W r(threshold) . In our simulations the choice l = 18lp /(1 + 80|σ|)
yielded about the same average heights for the peaks when varying σ, and W r(threshold) = 0.75 was found to be an
appropriate value to identify the edges from other segments.
For our second analysis we started from the jth segment, and measured the distance Dj (1) between the (j + 1)th
and (j − 1)th segments, the distance Dj (2) between (j + 2)th and (j − 2)th segments, and in general, the distance
Dj (m) between (j + m)th and (j − m)th segments. Plotting D for different js along the chain for a specific realization
one gets curves such as in Fig. S2. If j is a segment somewhere on the stem of the plectoneme, D will increase almost
linearly with m as demonstrated, e.g., by the violet curve in Fig. S2, whereas j corresponding to a segment in the
center of an end loop will behave differently, i.e., it will slightly increase and then will oscillate with a minimal value
very close to the (excluded) diameter of the chain, d. Running along specificPplectonemic conformation (j = 1, 2...), we
mcut
identified the segments that yield local minimum of the sum of distances m=1
Dj (m) (for mcut = 12 and accepted
only minima under a threshold value of 20 in units of ∆s) as the segments in the center of a loop. An advantage of
this analysis is that by examining the shape of Dj (m) for the center points of an edge, one may determine the lengths
of the branches as well, since when the two chain parts depart from each other (for some m), there is an abrupt change
in the slope of Dj (m). However, for our purposes the two methods of analysis agreed in more than 95% of the cases.

FIG. S6. (Color online) Histograms of the locations of the centers of the plectoneme edges, Pedges , for a circular chain of
L ' 5400bp ' 180seg with point-like kinks with lp = 4nm where the rest of the chain has lp = 50nm. (a) two kinks located at
j = 45 and j = 135 (b) three kinks located at j = 31, j = 91 and j = 151 (c) four kinks located at j = 23, j = 68, j = 113 and
j = 158 (d) five kinks located at j = 19, j = 55, j = 91, j = 127 and j = 163 (e) six kinks located at j = 16, j = 46, j = 76,
j = 106, j = 136 and j = 166 (f) the overall probability for an edge to contain a kink as a function of the number of kinks.
The existence of higher number of kinks effectively “sucks” the probability from the other parts of the chain, and as can be
seen in (a)-(e) the difference between the probabilities of kink-containing and kink-free edges increases.
