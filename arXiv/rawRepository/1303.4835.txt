Abstract
The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for human food production
and as a model organism for biological research. The genetic diversity contained in the
global population of yeast strains represents a valuable resource for a number of fields,
including genetics, bioengineering, and studies of evolution and population structure.
Here, we apply a multiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (known as RADseq) to genotype a large collection of S. cerevisiae strains, isolated from a wide range of
geographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the sequencing of
the same 1% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence alignment of 116,880 bases
across 262 strains. We find diversity among these strains is principally organized by
geography, with European, North American, Asian and African/S. E. Asian populations
defining the major axes of genetic variation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from
cacao, olives and sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One
population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high levels of
heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian populations, indicating
an admixed origin for this group. In the context of this global diversity, we demonstrate
that a collection of seven strains commonly used in the laboratory encompasses only
one quarter of the genetic diversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring
the relatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab strains. We
propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by human-associated admixture,
primarily between European and Asian populations and more recently between
European and North American populations. The large collection of genotyped yeast
strains characterized here will provide a useful resource for the broad community of
yeast researchers.

Author Summary
Baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a simple single-celled fungus important for
producing fermented foodstuffs such as bread, wine and beer. S. cerevisiae is also
widely used in the laboratory where it has served as a powerful model for understanding
basic cellular processes that are common to many organisms, including humans.
However, compared to the relatively small set of laboratory strains, the global population
of yeast represents a much more extensive source of DNA sequence variation. To

2

explore the genetic diversity of the global population of yeast, we used a cost effective
genotyping method that permits the sequencing of a common ~1% of every strain's
genome. Our results suggest that major subpopulations of yeast correspond to
geography (Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa, Europe, North America) and confirm that
human activity has dispersed strains around the globe. Strains used in the laboratory are
mostly related to European strains and represent only about one quarter of the
sequence diversity in the whole population.

Introduction
The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used by humans for
thousands of years to produce food and drink products that rely on fermentation, such as
bread, beer, sake and wine. In recent decades, S. cerevisiae has also proved to be a
powerful model organism for the study of eukaryotic biology. Many cellular processes
are highly conserved from yeast to higher eukaryotes, and the ease of propagating and
manipulating this simple single-celled organism has led to its use in a wide variety of
research areas. Yeast is a particularly powerful model system for genetics. S. cerevisiae
was the first eukaryote to have its genome fully sequenced [1], and nearly 85% of yeast
genes have functions that are characterized to some extent, a much higher fraction than
any other eukaryotic organism. S. cerevisiae has also been used to develop many of the
modern high-throughput tools to study the genome, transcriptome and proteome [2].
Together, these advantages have positioned S. cerevisiae as the eukaryotic organism
that we have come closest to understanding at a global or systems level.
Research using S. cerevisiae has traditionally focused on a small number of wellstudied laboratory strains. However, in recent years, interest in natural isolates has
increased as it has become clear that many non-laboratory strains (including those
adapted to various food/industrial processes) have properties absent from the lab
strains, such as the ability of several wine strains to ferment xylose [3]. The wider
population of yeast strains represents a deep pool of naturally occurring sequence
variation that has been leveraged to investigate the genetic architecture of polygenic
traits [4-10]. In addition, the polymorphisms that are observed in the global yeast
population have been acted upon by evolution, making this set of sequences a powerful
tool for investigating protein and regulatory sequence function as well as evolution [11].

3

Understanding the genetic diversity of yeast is therefore relevant to both the
food/industrial roles of yeast and its role as a model organism in scientific research.
The question of the global population structure of S. cerevisiae is itself an ongoing
topic of research. Several publications in the past few years have explored the genetic
diversity and population structure of yeast using techniques such as multi-gene
sequencing [12-15], whole genome sequencing [16], tiling array hybridization [17] and
microsatellite comparisons [18-21]. These studies demonstrated that S. cerevisiae is not
a purely domesticated organism but can be isolated from a variety of natural
environments around the globe. While there appears to be some clustering of yeast
genotypes by geography [16], it also appears that yeast involved in particular human
food-industrial processes are often genetically similar to one another. For example, wine
strains isolated from around the world display a very high degree of sequence similarity
[12, 16, 17, 21]. Unfortunately, several of the most diverged groups identified in these
studies were represented by relatively small numbers of strains, suggesting that analysis
of additional strains might help clarify the structure of global yeast diversity.
Whole genome sequencing of a large, diverse set of individuals is the most
comprehensive approach to exploring the population structure and genetic diversity of
an organism. However, despite the falling costs of DNA sequencing, complete genome
sequencing of several hundred yeast strains is still a significant expense. In contrast,
methods that compare strains by genotyping relatively small numbers of loci, such as
microsatellites or a small number of genes [12], are less expensive, but the results may
not reflect the relationships between strains genome-wide. A genome reduction strategy
referred to as restriction site associated sequencing (RAD-seq) [22, 23] directs
sequence reads to genomic locations adjacent to particular restriction sites. However,
because most restriction sites are common across strains of the same species, nearly
the same subset of every genome is sequenced. Finally, because the sequenced
regions are spread across the genome, comparisons should reflect the pattern that
would be observed from comparisons of whole genome sequences. Thus, the RAD-seq
approach should accurately capture the relationships seen with whole genome
sequencing, but at a fraction of the cost.
In this work, we apply a multiplexed RAD-seq reduced genome sequencing strategy
to explore genetic diversity and population structure in S. cerevisiae. Using this

4

approach we sequenced more than 200 strains over ~1% of the yeast genome. The
strains include multiple representatives from six continents, 38 different countries and
were isolated from disparate sources, including fruits, insects, plants, soil and a variety
of human fermentations, such as ragi, togwa, cacao, and olives. From analysis of the
resulting multiple alignment, we observed a clear geographical stratification of strains
along with evidence of admixture between populations and human-associated strain
dispersal.

Results
In an effort to expand the number and diversity of characterized S. cerevisiae strains
available to the yeast community, we assembled and characterized a collection of >200
strains (Materials and Methods, Table S1). This strain set covers a diverse range of
ecological niches and geographical locations, including strains used in previous studies
of yeast global and local population structure [12, 16-19] and strains with published
whole genome sequence (WGS) data. We sequenced each of these strains using a
RAD-seq strategy to produce an initial multiple alignment (Materials and Methods).
Strains with published WGS data were then added to the alignment to facilitate
comparison between the results generated using WGS and RAD-seq data (Materials
and Methods). The final dataset contained 262 strains genotyped across 116,880 base
positions of which 5,868 sites were polymorphic (Supplemental Dataset 1).

Genetic Relationship Among Strains
To visualize the phylogenetic relationships between the strains, we generated a
neighbor-joining tree from the reduced genome multiple alignment (Figure 1 and
Supplemental Dataset 2). The tree agrees well with the geographic origins of the strains
and, for the subset of strains in common, is also consistent with a previous study that
used WGS [16]. The most distantly related populations of North America, Europe, South
Asia and East Asia form clear and well-separated clusters on our tree. We also identified
a small isolated cluster of strains from Ghana involved in cacao fermentation and
another discrete cluster of strains from the Philippines.
A clear exception to this geographical stratification is the dispersal of European/wine

5

strains around the globe, a result that is also consistent with the previous study [16]. We
identified two clusters of strains that appear closely related to the European/wine cluster,
one isolated from European olives and another consisting primarily of a collection of
environmental isolates from New Zealand [19]. Results for this second group are
consistent with the hypothesis that the strains largely reflect a population brought to New
Zealand as a consequence of European settlement. Together with the main
“European/Wine” cluster, these two groups of strains appear to identify a “greaterEuropean” region of the tree.
Strains isolated from North America fell into two highly diverged regions of the tree.
One set of strains (Figure 1, “North America Wild”) defines a cluster of strains almost
universally isolated from North America (largely environmental samples from soil and
vegetation). The second set is genetically similar to the European/wine strains, with
strains scattered within the main European/wine cluster and related groups (Figure 1
and Table S1). There are also a small number of strains isolated from North American
environments in the “New Zealand” cluster. As previously observed [24], North American
strains isolated from even the same locale (e.g. a single vineyard) split into subsets from
both the North American Wild cluster and greater-European regions of the tree. These
results are consistent with the assertion that in many locations across North America
(particularly vineyards), a native population of yeast strains coexists sympatrically with a
population introduced by European settlement [24].
Another instance in which highly diverged strains were isolated from a single small
geographical location is provided by the set of strains isolated from “Evolution Canyon”,
a well-studied location in Mount Carmel National Park of Israel [18]. These strains fell
into one large and two smaller clusters on the tree (Figure1, Israel 1, Israel 2, and a third
cluster within a diverse set of strains labeled “Mixed”). The genomic diversity of these
strains is remarkable, given that they were collected within a few hundred meters of
each other.

Strains Widely Used in the Laboratory
Included in the multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree is a group of seven strains
widely used in the laboratory (S288c, W303, RM11-1a, FL100, Sigma 1278b, SK1, Y55),
several of which are known to be closely related [25]. The strains SK1 and Y55 are

6

closely related to the West African cluster while S288c, FL100 and W303 are related and
close to the European/Wine cluster. The position of these strains on the tree agrees with
two previous studies [16, 17], both of which described the limited sequence diversity of
the lab strains. For example, none of the commonly used lab strains are derived from
certain major populations, including the Asian group and the North America Wild group
(Figure 1). Together, these results suggest that the total sequence diversity of the yeast
global population is poorly sampled by this set of strains in common laboratory use.
To compare the total sequence diversity captured by the full set of 262 strains
relative to that present in the subset of laboratory strains, we analyzed all alleles
(defined as single base pair polymorphisms) that occurred in more than one strain.
Alleles found in only one strain (singletons) were ignored to reduce the effect of
sequencing errors, as were heterozygous calls. The results show a total of 3,321
polymorphic loci with 6,680 total alleles (3,283 bi-allelic, 38 tri-allelic, and 0 tetra-allelic
positions). Only 1,703 of these 6,680 alleles were observed in the set of lab strains, and
thus the set of strains assembled in our panel represents a significant increase (~4-fold)
in sequence diversity over the set of lab strains.

Population Structure
The infrequent sexual cycle of S. cerevisiae, combined with its high rate of selfmating, promotes the establishment of strong population structure and enables clonal
expansion of admixed populations. To infer population structure and admixture between
populations while accounting for selfing, we applied a Monte Carlo Markov chain
algorithm, InStruct [26], to the 759 sites with an allele frequency of 10% or more. On the
basis of the deviance information criterion, we inferred the most likely number of
populations to be nine (Materials and Methods) and labeled each population by the most
common geographic location and/or substrate from which the strains were originally
isolated (Table S2). The relevant genotypes of each strain along with their inferred
population ancestry are shown in Figure 2 and Table S1. The nine populations consist of
two North American oak populations, an Asian food and drink population, a European
wine & olive population, an African/S. E. Asian population, a New Zealand population, an
Israeli population and two populations associated with industrial/food processes. These
populations match well with the major groupings seen on the phylogenetic tree, with the

7

two North American populations identified by InStruct corresponding to the “North
America Wild” grouping (Figure 1 and Figure S1). It is notable that these two
subdivisions do not reflect a clear geographic pattern within North America (Figure 2 and
Table S1). The New Zealand population clearly shares many alleles with the European
strains, but harbors a small number of sites that make it unique. One of the two humanassociated groups contains the majority of laboratory strains, emphasizing the uneven
sampling of yeast populations represented by the set of laboratory strains.

Admixture
For each population, strains were observed with high levels of ancestry to that
population. However, 38% of strains showed appreciable levels of admixture, defined as
less than 80% ancestry from a single population. To assess the overall coincidence of
mixture between pairs of populations we tabulated the number of strains with at least
20% ancestry from each pair of populations (Figure 3). Most admixed strains involved
the European, Asian or African populations. However, not all pairs of populations were
equally likely to admix. Admixture was detected between the European population and
the first North American (InStruct #1), but not the second North American (InStruct #2)
populations. More generally, admixture with the two North American populations was
largely restricted to the African and European populations or to admixture between the
two populations themselves. Like the European population, the Asian population showed
admixture with most other groups. The two human-associated populations were largely
admixed with either the Asian or European populations. Finally, the New Zealand
population only admixed with the European population, and the Israeli population was
largely admixed with the Asian and one of the human-associated populations.

Heterozygosity
Matings within or between populations can result in strains with a large proportion of
heterozygous sites. Most strains in this study had zero or a relatively small number of
such sites. These strains could be naturally occurring homozygotes, haploids, or
converted to homozygous diploids, a standard practice in some laboratories. However,
we did identify 65 strains with more than 20 heterozygous sites (Table S1). The two

8

strains with the highest number of heterozygous sites DCM6 (n= 305) and DCM21 (n=
288) were isolated from cherry trees in North America and appear to be hybrids between
the European and North American populations [24]. Other strains with a large number of
heterozygous sites (Table S1) were also isolated from fruit-related sources, including
three from cacao fermentations, one from banana fruit, one from fruit juice and one from
a spontaneous grape juice fermentation. Across these 65 strains, 42 also exhibit notable
admixture, defined by less than 80% ancestry from a single population. The proportion of
heterozygous strains exhibiting appreciable admixture (65%) is significantly greater
(Fisher's Exact Test, P = 1.5x10 -4) than strains with little or no heterozygosity (38%),
suggesting that heterozygosity was derived in part by admixture between populations.
Among the heterozygous strains, the highest proportion of ancestry comes from one of
the human-associated populations (#4, 31%), followed by the European (20%), Asian
(17%) and African (14%) populations. To examine rates of heterozygosity across
populations, we compared expected to observed heterozygosity within each population
(Table S1). While most populations exhibit a deficit of observed, compared to expected
heterozygosity,

the

populations

show

more

heterozygosity than the other populations.

Relatedness Between Populations
Whereas heterozygosity and admixture can provide information about strain
ancestry, relatedness between populations can provide information about the history of
entire populations, some of which may themselves be derived from historical admixture
events. To examine relatedness between populations, we applied multidimensional
scaling (Materials and Methods) to the entire dataset (Figure 4). The first principal
coordinate differentiates the European population from the other populations; the second
principal coordinate distinguishes the two North American populations from the Asian
population; and the third principal coordinate differentiates the African/S. E. Asian
population from the others. The remaining populations and most of the admixed strains
lie between these four major groups (Figure 4). Consistent with their positions on the
neighbor-joining tree (Figure 1) and their genotypes (Figure 2), the New Zealand and
Israeli populations are most closely related to the European population, and the two
human-associated populations lie between the European and Asian populations. The

9

results, combined with its high rates of heterozygosity, also suggest that the first humanassociated population (population #4) appears to be a recently derived population
originating from hybrids between the European and Asian populations.

Subpopulations
Low frequency alleles (<10%) can sometimes define subpopulations not captured by
inference of population structure based on common alleles. Two-dimensional
hierarchical clustering of the low frequency alleles identified a number of such subgroups
(Figure 5 and Table S1). These subgroups include a previously described
Malaysian/Bertram Palm population [16], but also groups of strains from Philippines/Nipa
palm, togwa, olives, sake and cacao. While the number of strains in each group is small,
the number of sites defining the groups is not. In support of these groups representing
populations that have been isolated from other populations for some time, many of the
rare variants that define these groups are not present in other strains but, in at least
some cases, are variable within the subgroup. Interestingly, the subpopulations defined
by the largest numbers of alleles are strains with primary membership to the African/ S.
E. Asian population, suggesting that there may be undiscovered subpopulations and
diversity among strains of African or Southeast Asian origin.

Discussion
Genetic variation within S. cerevisiae has been shaped by a complex history,
influenced by human-associated dispersal and admixture. Understanding this history
and the resulting patterns of diversity is important for capturing and harnessing its
fermentative capabilities as well as for quantitative and population genetics research. In
this study, we used a reduced genome sequencing strategy to characterize the genetic
diversity among a global sample of 262 strains isolated from a wide range of ecological
habitats and environmental substrates. Our findings indicate that the major axes of
differentiation correspond to broad geographic regions. In addition to previously
described populations and patterns of differentiation [12, 16, 17, 19, 21, 27], two new
patterns indicative of human influence also emerge. First, we find a population
represented by multiple human-associated strains that contains a mixture of European

10

and Asian alleles. Second, we find human-associated subpopulations from togwa, olive,
cacao and sake fermentations that are defined by a unique set of variants not present
elsewhere in the global population. While inferences of population structure can depend
on sampling, indeed our analysis points to areas of uncertainty, the structure of S.
cerevisiae described here is based on the largest collection of strains typed across the
genome. This work also provides a foundation for studying the genetic underpinnings of
complex traits, the origin and evolution of strains used by humans, and the relationships
between such traits and population history.

Geographic Differentiation
A major unanswered question in the study of yeast population structure has
been the relative importance of geography versus ecological niche. While the strains in
this study were isolated from many different ecological habitats, a number of lines of
evidence suggest that the groups they form are defined better by geographic
differentiation than by ecological niche. The two North American populations contain
predominantly oak-associated strains, but they also contain strains from plants and
insects. Similarly, the European population contains primarily vineyard-associated
strains, but also contains a number of European soil and clinical isolates [16]. The Asian
population also includes strains isolated from multiple countries and several different
habitats, including strains used in Sake fermentation and several strains isolated from
food. The Asian population shares many alleles with the North American populations, but
is genetically distinct and includes only a handful of strains from outside of Asia. What is
less clear is how this Asian population is related to a number of diverged lineages
represented by strains from primeval and secondary forests in China [13].
In comparison to the European, North American and Asian populations, the
African/S. E. Asian population is not as well defined. Most of the strains are inferred to
have mixed ancestry, and the strains that are most representative of the population
(>80% ancestry) combine previously separated populations [16] of West Africa and
Malaysia, two populations that are also separated on our tree (Figure 1). Because the
trees are consistent, the different results of the two population analyses could be a result
of differences in the methods of analysis (e.g. Structure versus InStruct), the larger
number of strains used in this study, or the larger number of sites used by Liti et al. [16].

11

Admixture
Evidence of admixture was seen in a large fraction of strains and in every
population. While admixture is most common among the European, African and Asian
populations (Figure 3), the smaller number of admixed strains from the North America
and New Zealand populations may represent the more recent establishment of
European strains in these locations or may be related to the frequency of mating in the
oak tree or soil environment. Some of the admixed strains also exhibit high rates of
heterozygosity, indicating a relatively recent mating between strains with different
ancestries. Interestingly, many of the heterozygous strains were isolated from fruits or
orchards, an observation that is consistent with the isolation of admixed (mosaic) strains
from fruits and orchards in China [13].
Because yeast can grow asexually, entire populations can arise as a
consequence of even rare admixture events. The two human-associated populations
bear a strong signature of an admixed origin as they carry alleles from both European
and Asian populations and lie between these two groups in the principal coordinate
analysis (Figure 2 and Figure 4). Human-associated population #4 bears the additional
signature of high rates of heterozygosity, implying relatively recent mating events in the
origin of this group. In contrast, human-associated population #5 harbors fewer
heterozygous strains, but also contains multiple laboratory strains (Sigma 1278b, FL100,
W303, S288C and FY4), some of which show mosaic patterns across their genome
indicative of an admixed origin [16, 25, 28].
The New Zealand and Israeli populations may also have an admixed origin.
These two populations carry a large subset of the European alleles, similar to many of
the admixed European strains, but also carry a small number of alleles present at high
frequency in the North American or Asian populations. This pattern is consistent with
New Zealand and Israeli populations being derived from an admixture event between the
European and these other populations followed by clonal (or nearly clonal) expansion.
However, the New Zealand and Israeli populations also carry a small number of alleles
that are not present in either the North American or Asian populations (Figure 2). This
raises the possibility that the New Zealand and Israeli populations were derived from
admixture between the European and as yet undiscovered populations, or instead,

12

rather than derived from an admixture event, that they represent lineages with roots in
an ancestral European population (similar to the “Olive” grouping). The diversity of
strains sampled from Evolution Canyon in Israeli is particularly notable. Of the 15 Israeli
strains, seven define the nearly clonal Israeli population, three are assigned with 100%
ancestry to the human-associated population #4, and four show comparable
percentages of ancestry from the Asian, Israeli and human-associated (#5) populations.

Derived Subpopulations
The use of common sites to infer population structure eliminates the detection of
small populations defined by rare variants. With clustering based solely on rare variants,
we identified a number of such subpopulations (Figure 5). Although many of these
groups were isolated from human-associated fermentations, the number of strains is too
small to clearly indicate whether they are related by geographic or environmental origin.
For example, the olive strain group contains isolates from Spanish olives imported to
Seattle and one from olives in Spain. Yet, this group does not contain two strains
isolated from the brine of olives from Mexico and one from an olive tree in California.
The two North American groups contain strains from different states, and the togwa and
cacao strains were each sampled from the same country. While some of these
subpopulations may be the result of recently expanded clones, several of them are
defined by sites that are variable within the subpopulation. This latter observation points
to the establishment of small groups that have remained isolated due to either
geographic or ecological barriers to gene flow.

Prospects for Future Studies
As our understanding of S. cerevisiae population history increases, so does the
need to incorporate such information into quantitative and population genetic studies.
Our results highlight the complex relationships between strains and populations, but also
characterize a set of strains and sequences that can be used by the community. Using
whole-genome sequencing or a reduced genome sequencing strategy, such as the
RAD-seq method used here, new strains can be readily placed in the context of global
population structure. We anticipate that new genetic diversity will be discovered,

13

particularly in Africa for which we found less certain relationships and a number of
derived subpopulations. Our results may also prove useful to studies of existing strains,
either by controlling for population history in genome-wide association studies or by
aiding the selection of strains for linkage analysis. In both cases, strain choice is an
important consideration as the results can depend on what variation is captured and the
structure of this variation across strains. While many quantitative genetic studies have
been based on crosses with laboratory strains, our results underscore the presence of
additional variation that is available beyond those strains. Finally, the global diversity and
increased variation uncovered by our study highlight the potential for identifying novel
properties which could prove valuable to the improvement of existing strains or the
engineering of new strains for use in industrial fermentations.

Materials and Methods
The S. cerevisiae strains analyzed in this study were obtained from a variety of
sources, including the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection (http://www.phaffcollection.org/),
the ARS (NRRL) Culture Collection (http://nrrl.ncaur.usda.gov/), published strains from
individual laboratories or our own isolates from wild or domesticated sources. Details,
including references and information about strain requests, are included in Table S1.
While analyzing the data we came across a small number of anomalies, such as two
dissimilar genome sequences for strain 322134S. These are likely to represent errors in
strain labeling.

Yeast Isolation
Soil, bark and leaves or food samples were bathed in medium consisting of 2 g/L
Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (Difco, BD,), 5 g/L ammonium sulfate and 80
g/L glucose. Chloramphenicol (30 µg/ml) and carbenicillin (50 µg/ml) were added to the
medium to suppress bacterial growth and cultures were incubated at 30ºC. When
necessary to suppress mold overgrowth, cultures were sub-cultured to liquid medium
containing 1-5% ethanol. Cultures were examined by microscopy at 3 days and 10 days,
and those harboring budding yeast were plated onto CHROMagar Candida (DRG
International, Inc.) and incubated at 30ºC for 3-5 days. CHROMagar Candida is a culture

14

medium containing proprietary chromogenic substrates that can aid the identification of
clinically important yeast [29]. On CHROMagar Candida, S. cerevisiae colonies are
known to range in hue from white to lavender to deep purple with most exhibiting the
“purple” phenotype (Ludlow and Dudley, unpublished result; [30]). Colonies exhibiting
these color phenotypes were picked and saved for further study.

RAD-Sequencing and Alignment
A subset of strains were RAD-sequenced previously [24]. For the rest, RADsequencing was carried out as previously described [24, 31]. Briefly, yeast genomic DNA
was extracted in 96-well format and fragmented by restriction enzyme digestion with
MfeI and MboI. P1 and P2 Adaptors were then ligated onto the fragments. The P1
adaptor contains the Illumina PCR Forward sequencing primer sequence followed by
one of 48 unique 4- nucleotide barcodes and finally the MfeI overhang sequence. The
P2 adaptor contains the Illumina PCR Reverse primer sequence followed by the MboI
overhang sequence. After ligation, the barcoded ligation products were pooled,
concentrated, and size selected on agarose gels, with fragments from 150 to 500 base
pairs extracted from the gel. Gel-extracted DNA was further pooled to multiplex 48
uniquely barcoded samples in one sequencing library. The multiplexed DNA library was
then enriched with a PCR reaction using Illumina PCR Forward and Reverse primers.
Sequencing runs were performed on the Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina) for 40 base pair
single-end reads, with one library of 48 multiplexed samples per flow cell lane, yielding
20-40 million reads. The read sequences generated for this study are available at <Upon
acceptance, sequences will be deposited to DRYAD and SRA>, and for the subset of
strains that were RAD-sequenced previously, DRYAD entry doi:10.5061/dryad.g5jj6.
Multiple sequence alignments were generated by mapping reads to the S288c

reduced-genome sequences for each strain. The tagged reads were split into strainpools by their 4 base prefix barcodes. Reads with N’s or with Phred quality scores less
than 20 in the barcode sequence were removed. Any reads with more than 2 Ns outside
the barcode were also removed. Reads were aligned to the S288c reference using BWA

15

(V0.5.8, [32]) with 6 or fewer mismatches tolerated. Samtools (V0.1.8, [33]) was then
used to generate a pileup from the aligned reads using the “pileup” command and the “c” parameter . Base calls were retained if they had a consensus quality greater than 20.
Positions with root mean squared (RMS) mapping qualities less than 15 and
insertion/deletion polymorphisms were ignored. After filtering there was an average of
209,765 bp for each strain. Sequences from each strain were combined into a multiple
sequence alignment via their common alignment to the S288c genome. Sites with more
than 10% missing data were removed, resulting in a multiple sequence alignment of
116,880 base pairs.

RAD-seq dataset for population genetic analysis. For genomes with an S288c NCBI
coordinate system, sequences were extracted directly based on S288c reference
coordinates. For genomes using an alternative coordinate system (SGRP), blat was
used to convert from the S288c NCBI reference coordinates to the alternative coordinate
system prior to extracting sequences. For assembled genomes without S288c
alignments, coordinates were obtained by blast. A fasta file of the S288c reference
sequence was generated for each contiguous segment in the multiple sequence
alignment. The resulting files were used to query each genome assembly using blast.
When quality scores were available, sites with sequence quality less than 20 were
converted to “N,” prior to blasting or following sequence retrieval.

Duplicated Strains
Some strains were sequenced by both WGS and RAD-seq. For duplicate strains with
pairwise divergence less than 0.0005 substitutions per site, excluding singleton alleles
(i.e. found in only 1 strain), only the RAD-seq data was retained for analysis. For
duplicate strains that exceeded the threshold, both RAD-seq and WGS data were
retained and strain names were labeled with an "r" and "g", respectively.
Population Analysis
Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree construction was carried out using MEGA [34]
(V5.0), based on P-distance with pairwise deletion. Population structure was inferred
using InStruct [26]. Because InStruct failed to converge using all sites, it was instead run

16

on 759 sites with allele frequency greater than or equal to 10%. Polymorphic sites were
made biallelic by treating third alleles as missing data. InStruct was run with the
parameters "-u 40000 -b 20000 -t 10 -c 10 -sl 0.95 -a 0 -g 1 -r 1000 -p 2 -v 2" with K
(number of populations) ranging from 3 to 15. While the lowest deviance information
criterion (DIC) was obtained from a chain with K = 15, there was substantial variation
among independent chains. We chose K = 9 as the optimal model to work with based on
the average DIC for K = 10 being nearly identical to that of K = 9 and subsequent drops
in DIC for larger values of K being small compared to the standard deviation in DIC
among chains (Table S3). Consensus population assignments for K = 8, 9 and 10 were
obtained for the five chains with the highest likelihood using CLUMPP (V1.1.2) [35] with
parameters “-m 3 -w 0 -s 2” and with greedy option = 2 and repeats = 10,000. The
similarity among the five chains (H') was 0.995 for K = 9. Compared to K = 9,
populations 6 (African, S. E. Asia/Palm, Cocoa, Fruit) and 7 (Israel/Soil) were merged for
K = 8, and a new population was inferred within populations 3 (Asian/Food, Drink) and 6
(African, S. E. Asia/Palm, Cacao, Fruit) for K = 10 (Figure S1). Multidimensional scaling
was performed on all 5868 sites and 262 strains using the identity by state distance
between each pair of strains and the "cmdscale” function in R with three dimensions.
Hierarchical clustering of either sites or strains was performed using the "hclust" function
in R with complete linkage and the euclidean distance of identity by state.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Neighbor-joining tree of the 262 S. cerevisiae strains based on multiple
alignment of 116,880 bases. Branch lengths are proportional to sequence divergence
measured as P-distance. Scale bar indicates 5 polymorphisms/ 10kb of sequence.
Geographical and environmental clusters of strains are named and are indicated by blackoutlined/grey-filled ovals. Colored ovals with numbering refer to strain populations
identified in Figure 2. Seven strains widely used in the laboratory are labeled.
Figure 2. Clustered genotypes with inferred population structure and membership. Sites
were clustered by complete heirarchical clustering using the euclidean distance of allele
sharing (identity by state). Strains were grouped by population structure and
memberships inferred using InStruct. Minor alleles are shown in red, heterozygous sites
in yellow, common alleles in black, missing data is gray. Populations are labeled by the
most common source and/or geographic location from which they were originally
isolated.
Figure 3. Coincidence of admixture between pairs of populations. Each bar shows the
number of strains with at least 20% ancestry from a reference population (bar labels) and
20% ancestry with another population (indicated by color in the legend). For comparison,
grey filled circles show the number of strains with more than 80% ancestry from each
population.
Figure 4. Relatedness among strains and the inferred populations to which they belong.
The first and second principal coordinates (A) and the first and third principal coordinates
(B) obtained from multidimensional scaling. Each circle shows a strain with color
indicating the population contributing the largest proportion of ancestry and size
indicating the proportion of ancestry from that population (see legend). Circles ringed in
black show strains with more than 20 heterozygous sites.
Figure 5. Subpopulations defined by clustering of low frequency alleles. Twodimensional hierarchical clustering of low frequency sites and strains. InStruct
assignments are shown on the left, clustered genotypes are shown in the middle, with
minor alleles in red, heterozygous sites in yellow, common alleles in black, and missing
data in gray. Selected subpopulations are labeled on the right.
