Abstract
Recent advance in nanotechnology has led to rapid advances in nanofluidics, which has been established as a
reliable means for a wide variety of applications, including molecular separation, detection, crystallization and
biosynthesis. Although atomic and molecular level consideration is a key ingredient in experimental design and
fabrication of nanfluidic systems, atomic and molecular modeling of nanofluidics is rare and most simulations
at nanoscale are restricted to one- or two-dimensions in the literature, to our best knowledge. The present work
introduces atomic scale design and three-dimensional (3D) simulation of ionic diffusive nanofluidic systems. We
propose a variational multiscale framework to represent the nanochannel in discrete atomic and/or molecular
detail while describe the ionic solution by continuum. Apart from the major electrostatic and entropic effects,
the non-electrostatic interactions between the channel and solution, and among solvent molecules are accounted
in our modeling. We derive generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for nanofluidic systems.
Mathematical algorithms, such as Dirichlet to Neumann mapping and the matched interface and boundary
(MIB) methods are developed to rigorously solve the aforementioned equations to the second-order accuracy
in 3D realistic settings. Three ionic diffusive nanofluidic systems, including a negatively charged nanochannel,
a bipolar nanochannel and a double-well nanochannel are designed to investigate the impact of atomic charges
to channel current, density distribution and electrostatic potential. Numerical findings, such as gating, ion
depletion and inversion, are in good agreements with those from experimental measurements and numerical
simulations in the literature.
Keywords: Channel design, Atomic design, Charge gating, Unipolar channel, Bipolar channel, Double-well
channel.

1. Introduction
Nanofluidics refers to the study of the transport of ions and/or molecules in confined solutions as well
as fluid flow through or past structures with one or more characteristic nanometer dimensions [26, 75]. The
dramatic advances in microfluidics in the 1990s and the introduction of nanoscience, nanotechnology and
atomic fabrication in recent years have given its own name to nanofluidics [32]. Nanofluidic systems have been
extensively exploited for molecule separation and detection, nanosensing, elucidation of complex fluid behavior
and for the discovery of new physical phenomena that are not observed or less influential in macrofluidic or
microfluidic systems [82]. Some of such phenomena include double-layer overlap, ion permitivity, diffusion,
ion-current rectification, surface charge effect and entropic forces [75, 107].
One major feature of a nanofluidic system is its structural characteristic. Nanofluidic structures can be
classified into nanopores and nanochannels and, in fact, these two terms are exchangeable in many cases [107].
A nanopore has comparatively short length formed perpendicularly through various materials, such as a bipore
consisting of proteins, i.e., α-hemolysin and a solid-state pore [9, 107]. An example of solid-state pore is a
set of nanopores in a silicon nitride membrane which enables the detection of folding behaviors of a single
double-stranded DNA [62]. On the other hand, a nanochannel has relatively larger dimensions of depth and
width, usually fabricated in a planar format, and is often equipped with other sophisticated devices to control
or influence the transport inside the channel [107]. For instance, Perry et al. demonstrates the rectifying
effect of a funnel-shape nanochannel based on different movements of counterions at its tip and base [71]. A
nano-scaled channel usually has either a cylindrical or a conical geometry [107]. In a cylindrical channel, the
flow direction does not influence on current, but surface charges and applied external voltage alter the flux
of ions with opposite sign charges. However, the difference in the size of pores in a conical channel brings
different ionic conductance patterns depending on the flow direction.
The other major feature of a nanofluidic system is its interactions. It is the interaction at nanoscale that
distinguishes a nanofluidic system from an ordinary fluid system. Certainly, most interactions are directly
inherited from the chemical and physical properties of the nanostructure, such as the geometric confinement,
steric effect, polarization and charge. Some other interactions are controlled by flow conditions, i.e., ion
composition and concentration, and applied external fields. Therefore, the interactions of a nanofluidic system
is determined by its structure and flow conditions. The function of a nanofluidic system is in turn determined
by all the interactions. Usually, most nanofluidic systems do not involve any chemical reactions. In this
case, steric effects, van der Waals interactions and electrostatic interactions are pivoting factors. Therefore,
in nanofluidic systems, microscopic interactions dominate the flow behavior, while in macroscopic flows and
some microfluidics, continuum fluid mechanics governs and microscopic effects are often negligible. Typically,
microscopic and macroscopic behaviors co-exist in a microfluidic system.
Characteristic length scales, such as Reynolds number, Biot number and Nusselt number, are important to
the macroscopic fluid flows.
qFor most nanofluidic systems, one of most important characteristic length scales
BT
is the Debye length λD = Pεε0Ckα0
2 , where ε is the dielectric constant of the solvent, ε0 is the permittivity
qα
α
of vacuum, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Cα0 and qα are, respectively,
the bulk ion concentration and the charge of ion species α [26]. The Debye length describes the thickness (or,
precisely, 1e th reduction) of electrical double layer (EDL). Essentially, ionic fluid behaves like a microscopic
flow within the EDL region, while acts as a macroscopic flow far beyond the Debye length. By the GouyChapman-Stern model, the EDL is divided into three parts: the inner Helmholtz plane, outer Helmholtz
plane and diffuse layer [75]. While the inner Helmholtz plane consists of non-hydrated coions and counterions
that are attached to the channel surface, the outer Helmholtz plane contains hydrated or partially hydrated
counterions. Moreover, the part between the inner and outer Helmholtz planes is called the Stern layer.
Note that the EDL applies not only to the layer near the nanochannel, but also the layer around a charged
biomolecule in the flow. Consequently, many microfluidic devices with quite large channel dimensions exhibit
microscopic flow characteristic when the fluid consists of large macromolecules and solvent. The possible
deformation, aggregation, folding and unfolding of the macromolecules in the fluidic system make the fluid flow
behavior complex and intriguing [40]. Nevertheless, for rigid macromolecules, the effective channel dimensions
can be estimated by subtracting the macromolecular dimension from the physical dimension of the channel.
The resulting system may be approximated by simple ions for most analysis.
Specifically, the charge on the wall surface derives electrostatic interactions and electrokinetic effects when
ions in a solution are sufficiently close to channel wall [83, 103]. Since the surface-to-volume ratio is excep-

2

tionally high in a nanoscale channel, surface charges induce a unique electrostatic screening region, i.e., EDL
[75]. In fact, it attracts ions charged oppositely (counterions) and repels ions having the same charge (coions)
to sustain the electroneutrality of an aqueous solution confined in a channel. Physically, the EDL region only
contains bound or mobile counterions and typically covers the nano-sized pore of a channel. Therefore, the
oppositely charged ions mainly constitute the electrical current through a micro- or nano-channel [75, 88].
The rectification of ionic current, which is one of the distinct transport properties of nanofluidic channels,
can further elucidate the flow pattern and formation of the fluid through a nanochannel [56]. This phenomenon
usually occurs when surface charge distribution, applied electric field, bulk concentration and/or channel
geometry are properly manipulated along the channel axis [21]. Pu et al. conducted experiments to present
ion-enrichment and ion-depletion effects on nanochannels to show that the rectification begins with these two
effects [73]. In their design, an applied field gave rise to accumulation of all ions at the cathode and absence
of all ions at the anode of the channels. Ion selectivity is another important feature which enables nano-sized
channels to work as an ionic filter [88]. It is defined as the ratio of the difference between currents of cations and
anions to the total current delivered by both ions. Vlassiouk and his colleagues examined the ion selectivity
of single nanometer channels under various conditions including channel dimension, buffer concentration and
applied voltage [88].
Nanofluidics has been extensively studied in chemistry, physics, biology, material science, and many areas
of engineering [75]. The primary purpose of most studies is to separate and/or detect biological substances
in a complex solution [69]. A variety of nanofluidic devices have been produced using extraordinary transport behaviors caused by steric restriction, polarization and electrokinetic principles [1, 57]. For instance, a
nanofluidic diode is an outstanding tool to take the advantage of the rectifying effect of ionic current through
a nanochannel [56]. The nanofluidic diodes have been developed to govern the flow inside the channel by
breaking the symmetry in channel geometry, surface charge arrangement and bulk concentration under the
influence of applied voltage [1, 21]. Additionally, the design and fabrication of nanofluidics for molecular biology applications is a new interdisciplinary field that makes use of precise control and manipulation of fluids
at submicrometer and nanometer scales to study the behavior of molecular and biological systems. Because of
the microscopic interactions, fluids confined at the nanometer scale can exhibit physical behaviors which are
not observed or insignificant in larger scales. When the characteristic length scale of the fluid coincides with
the length scale of the biomolecule and the scale of the Debye length, nanofluidic devices can be employed for
a variety of interesting basic measurements such as molecular diffusion coefficients [54], enzyme reaction rates
[31, 45], pH values [65, 97], and chemical binding affinities [54]. Micro- and nanofluidic techniques have been
instrumented for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications [8], macromolecule accumulator [22, 98],
electrokinetics [4, 50], biomaterial separation [41, 58], membrane protein crystallization [63], and micro-scale
gas chromatography [92]. Nanofluidic dynamic arrays have also been devised for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping [90]. Nanofluidic devices have also been engineered for electronic circuits
[101], local charge inversion [46], and photonic crystal circuits [35]. Microchannels and micropores have been
utilized for cell manipulation, cell separation, and cell patterning [52, 72]. Efforts are given to accomplish
all steps, including separation, detection and characterization, on a single microchip [75]. Despite of rapid
development in nanotechnology, the design and fabrication of nanofluidic systems are essentially empirical at
present [81]. Since nanofluidic device prototyping and fabrication are technically challenging and financially
expensive, it is desirable to further advance the field by mathematical/theoretical modeling and simulation.
The modeling and simulation of nanofluidic systems are of enormous importance and have been a growing
field of research in the past decade. When the width of a channel is less than 5nm, the transport analysis
requires the discreteness of substances and, in particular, molecular dynamics (MD) is a useful tool in this
respect [26]. Typically, the MD determines the motion of each atom in a system using the Newton’s classical
equations of motion [68]. A simplified model is Brownian dynamics (BD), in which the solvent water molecules
are treated implicitly, so this method costs less computationally than the MD and is able to reach the time
scale of physical transport [64, 68, 74]. The BD describes the motion of each ion under frictional, stochastic
and systematic forces by means of Langevin equation [64, 68]. Further reduction in the computational cost
leads to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) theory, which is the most renowned model for charge transport
[6, 12, 24, 28, 33, 34, 47, 59, 104, 105]. The PNP model describes the solvent water molecule as a dielectric
continuum, treats ion species by continuum density distributions and, in principle, retains the discrete atomic
detail and/or charge distribution of the channel or pore [6, 33, 59, 104, 105]. The performance of the PB
model and the PNP model for the streaming current in silica nanofluidic channels was compared [13]. The

3

Brownian dynamics of ions in the nanopore channel was combined with the continuum PNP model for regions
away from the nanopore channel [2]. The reader is referred to the literature [26, 33, 68, 74, 104, 105] for a
comprehensive discussion of the PNP theory. A further simplified model is the Lippmann-Young equation,
which is able to predict the liquid-solid interface contact angle and interface morphology under an external
electric field [81].
Most microfluidic systems involve fluid flow. If the fluid flow through a microfluidic pore or channel is
also a concern in the theoretical modeling, coupled PNP and the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations can be utilized
[16, 17, 23, 25, 53, 88, 89, 91, 94, 96, 106, 108]. These models are able to provide a more detailed description
of the fluid flow away from the microscale pore or channel, i.e., beyond the Debye screening length.
Recently, a variety of differential geometry based multiscale models were introduced for charge transport
[94–96]. The differential geometry theory of surface provides a natural means to separate the microscopic
domain of biomolecules from the macroscopic domain of solvent so that appropriate physical laws are applied
to appropriate domains. Our variational formulation is able to efficiently bridge macro-micro scales and
synergically couple macro-micro domains [94]. One class of our multiscale models is the combination of
Laplace-Beltrami equation and Poisson-Kohn-Sham equations for proton transport [14, 15]. Another class of
our multiscale models utilizes Laplace-Beltrami equation and generalized PNP equations for the dynamics and
transport of ion channels and transmembrane transportors [94, 96]. The other class of our multiscale models
alternate the MD and continuum elasticity (CE) descriptions of the solute molecule, as well as continuum fluid
mechanics formulation of the solvent [94–96, 100]. We have proposed the theory of continuum elasticity with
atomic rigidity (CEWAR) [100] to treat the shear modulus as a continuous function of atomic rigidity so that
the dynamics complexity of a macromolecular system is separated from its static complexity. As a consequence,
the time-consuming dynamics is approximated by using the continuum elasticity theory, while the less timeconsuming static analysis is carried out with an atomic description. Efficient geometric modeling strategies
associated with differential geometry based multiscale models have been developed in both Lagrangian Eulerian
[36, 37] and Eulerian representations [99].
Nevertheless, in nanofluidic modeling, computation and analysis, there are many standing theoretical
and technical problems. For example, nanofluidic processes may induce structural modifications and even
chemical reactions [55, 86], which are not described in the present nanofluidic simulations. Additionally,
although the PNP model can incorporate atomic charge details in its pore or channel description, which is
vital to channel gating and fluid behavior, atomic charge details beyond the coarse description of surface
charges are usually neglected in most nanofluidic simulations. Moreover, as discussed earlier, Stern layer and
ion steric effect are significant for the EDL, and are not appropriately described in the conventional PNP
model. Furthermore, nanofluidic simulations have been hardly performed in 3D realistic settings with physical
parameters. Consequently, results can only be used for qualitative (i.e., phenomenological) comparison and
not for quantitative prediction. Finally, the material interface induced jump conditions in the Poisson equation
are seldom enforced in nanofluidic simulations with realistic geometries. Therefore, it is imperative to address
these issues in the current nanofluidic modeling and simulation.
The objective of the present work is to model and analyze realistic nanofluidic channels with atomic charge
details and introduce second-order convergent numerical methods for nanofluidic problems. We present a
new variational derivation of the governing PNP type of models without utilizing the differential geometry
formalism of solvent-solute interfaces. As such a domain characteristic function is introduced to represent the
given solid-fluid interface. Additionally, we investigate the impact of atomic charge distribution to the fluid
behavior of a few 3D nanoscale channels. We demonstrate that atomic charges give rise specific and efficient
control of nanochannel flows. Moreover, we develop a second-order convergent numerical method for solving
the PNP equations with complex nanochannel geometry and singular charges. Furthermore, the change of the
distribution in atomic charge distribution is orchestrated with the variation of applied external voltage and
bulk ion concentration to understand nanofluidic currents. Therefore, we are able to elucidate quantitatively
the transport phenomena of three types of nano-scaled channels, including a negatively charged channel,
a bipolar channel and a double-well channel. These flow phenomena are analyzed in terms of electrostatic
potential profiles, ion concentration distributions and current-voltage characteristics. To ensure computational
accuracy and efficiency for nanofluidic systems, we construct a second order convergent method to solve
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with dielectric interface and singular charge sources in 3D realistic settings.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a new variational derivation of PNP
type of models using a domain characteristic function for nanofluidic simulations. In Section 3, we develop a

4

Dirichlet to Neumann mapping for dealing with charge singularities and the matched and boundary interface
(MIB) method for material interfaces. These methods are employed to compute the PNP equations with 3D
irregular channel geometries and singular charges. Section 4 is devoted to validate the present PNP calculation
with synthetic nanoscale channels. We first test a cylindrical nanochannel with one charged atom at the middle
of the channel and then examine the channel with eight atomic charges that are placed around the channel.
Since PNP equations admit no analytical solution in general, we design analytical solutions for a modified PNP
system which has the same mathematical characteristic as the PNP system. In Section 5, we investigate the
atomic scale control and regulation of cylindrical nanofluidic systems. Three nanofluidic channels, a negatively
charged channel, a bipolar channel and a double-well channel, are studied in terms of electrostatic potential
profile, ion concentration distribution and current. Finally, this paper ends with concluding remarks.
2. Theoretical Models
Unlike the charge and material transport in biomolecular systems, the charge and material transport in
nanofluidic systems induces a negligible reconstruction of the solid-fluid interface compared to the system scale.
Therefore, instead of using our earlier differential geometric based multiscale models [94–96] which allow the
modification of the solvent-solute interface, we adopt a fixed solid-fluid interface in the present work. To this
end, we introduce a domain characteristic function in our variation formulation.
Let us consider a total computational domain Ω ⊂ R3 . We denote Ωm and Ωs respectively
S the
S microscopic
channel domain and the solution domain. Interface Γ separates Ωm and Ωs so that Ωm Γ Ωs = Ω. We
introduce a characteristic function χ(r) : R3 → R3 such that Ωm = χΩ and Ωs = (1 − χ)Ω. Obviously, χ and
(1−χ) are the indicators for the channel domain and the solution domain, respectively. Unlike the hypersurface
function in our earlier differential geometry based multiscale models, the interface is predetermined in the
present model. In the solution domain Ωs , we seek a continuum description of solvent and ions. In the channel
or pore domain Ωm , we consider a discrete atomistic description. A basic setting of our model can be found
in Fig. 1.

2.1. Generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory
Although the PNP theory is quite standard [6, 16, 17, 23, 25, 53, 85, 88, 89, 91, 94, 106, 108], it does
not include non-electrostatic interactions. Here we present a generalized PNP theory by incorporating nonelectrostatic interactions between the solution and the nanoscale channel pore, and between solvent molecules,
i.e., waters and ions. We utilize a variational formulation to derive generalized PNP equations.
2.1.1. Energy functional
Electrostatic energy functional. Electrostatic interactions are ubiquitous at nanoscale and are the dominate
effects for nanofluidic behaviors. The electrostatic interactions are typically modeled by a number of theoretical

5

approaches, such as the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory [29, 39, 60, 77], the polarizable continuum theory
[67, 84] and the generalized Born approximation [3, 30]. Among these methods, the PB theory is the most
popular and has a sound origin, i.e., the Maxwell’s equations [7, 48, 70]. A variation formulation of the
Poisson-Boltzmann theory was originally introduced by Sharp and Honig [76] in 1990 and was extended to an
electrostatic force derivation [43] and a multiscale formalism [94, 95]. In the present work, we consider the
following electrostatic energy functional

Qk δ(r − rk ),
with Qk denoting the partial charge of the kth atom in the solute and Nf the total number of fixed charges.
Here Cα and qα , respectively, denote the concentration and the charge valence of the αth solvent species,
which is zero for an uncharged solvent component. Moreover, Nc represents the number of mobile ion species
through the solution domain. Note that the domain characteristic function χ in Eq. (1) is different from the
hypersurface function S used in our earlier work [94–96].
Non-electrostatic interactions. Non-electrostatic interactions refer to van der Waals interactions, dispersion
interactions, ion-water dipolar interactions, ion-water cluster formation or dissociation, steric effects, et cetera.
Some of these interactions are studied in terms of size effects in the past [4, 5, 10, 15, 44, 51, 57, 61, 87]. Size
effects in solvation analysis were accounted with the WCA potential for the solvation [18–20]. Pair particle
interactions in the Boltzmann kinetic theory and impact to transport equations were formulated by Snider
et al. in 1996 [79, 80]. To account for solution-channel interactions, as well as ion-water interactions, the
non-electrostatic interaction energy functional takes the form

where Cα (r) is the density of αth solvent component, which may be either charged or uncharged, and Uαk is
an interaction potential between the kth atom of the channel molecule and the αth component of the solvent.
For water that is free of salt, Cα (r) is the density of the water molecules. Here Uαβ (r) is a potential for
solvent-solvent non-electrostatic interactions, including possible ion-water interactions.
The solvent-solute interactions in solvation analysis have been represented by the Lennard-Jones potential
[18–20]. The Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) decomposition of the Lennard-Jones potential [93] was utilized
to split the Lennard-Jones potential into attractive and repulsive parts

The solvent-solvent interaction term Uαβ (r) in the total interaction potential Uα (r) does not affect the
derivation and the form of other expressions. More detailed description of Uαβ (r) for ion channel transport
can be found in our earlier work [15, 96].

where the first row is the electrostatic free energy functional, the second row is the free energy functional of

electrostatic free energy functional is the same as the polar solvation free energy functional [18, 19, 94]. Here
λα is a Lagrange multiplier, which is included to ensure appropriate physical properties at equilibrium [38].
Although it appears that the characteristic function χ is quite similar to the hypersurface function in our
earlier work [94–96], χ is just an indicator for a given molecular domain Ωm with a fixed interface Γ. In
contrast, the hypersurface function in our earlier work not only as a characteristic function for the molecular
domain, but also plays the role of a moving interface whose dynamics is driven by mechanical and electrostatic
forces, i.e., the Laplace-Beltrami equation. However, the fixed interface Γ in the present work is a reasonable
approximation for nanochannels.
An important feature of the present total free energy function formulation (9) is that the free energy
functional U of the non-electrostatic interactions is employed for nanofluidics. Therefore, the present theory
is able to deal with a variety of non-electrostatic interactions. Consequently, the solvent microstructure near
the channel can be predicted correctly.
2.1.2. Governing equations
The total free energy functional (9) is a function of electrostatic potential Φ and ion concentration Cα .
Unlike our earlier formulations [94–96], the solvent-channel interface Γ is given in the present work. Like our
earlier work, governing equations for the system are derived by using the variational principle.

relative generalized potential consists of contributions from the entropy of mixing, electrostatic potential,
solvent-solute interaction and the relative reference chemical potential. In practice, the nanofluidic system is
out of equilibrium due to applied external field and/or inhomogeneous concentration across the nanochannel.

Note that Eq. (19) does not involve the characteristic function χ because it has already been restricted
to solution domain Ωs . In contrast, generalized Poisson equation (10) is defined on the whole domain (Ω).
The nature boundary condition is assumed in our derivation. However, due to the experimental setup, mixed
boundary conditions are typically employed in our simulations.
3. Mathematical Algorithms
The geometric setting of the ionic diffusive nanofluidic system employed in the present investigation is
described. In this work, we develop a second-order PNP solver for 3D ionic diffusive nanofluidic channels
with irregular geometry and material interface. To this end, we appropriately modify the computational
algorithms developed in our earlier work [104] for nanofluidic systems. To emphasize the primary effects of
atomic charges in ion diffusive nanofluidic channel design and the use of interface techniques in 3D nanofluidic
systems, we neglect the non-electrostatic interactions, i.e., assuming U = 0, in the rest of this work. However,
since non-electrostatic interactions are important for nanofluidic systems [4, 5], the situation that U 6= 0 will
be investigated in our future work. To avoid confusion, our generalized PNP model works for all kinds of
ion species. However, our model is designed based on realistic transmembrane channels. Since potassium
and chloride are most important ion species in cellular charge transport, we use the potassium chloride (KCl)
system as an example in our model.
3.1. A schematic diagram of ionic diffusive nanofluidic channels
In the present work, we construct a cuboid nanofluidic system whose dimensions are 16 × 16 × 56Å3 . It
contains a cylindrical nanochannel which is placed at the center of the system as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The
radius of the channel pore is 5Å and the length of the channel is 49Å as depicted in Fig. 1(b). Each of
the channel ends is connected to a reservoir of potassium chloride (KCl) solution. In our simulation, the
computational domain Ω is the nanofluidic system and it is mainly divided into ion inclusion region Ωs and
ion exclusion region Ωm . The ion inclusion region is the region inside the channel and the two reservoirs where
ions may penetrate and travel through. The ion exclusion region is the rest where there is no mobile ion,
but has fixed charged particles. In contrast to our differential geometry based multiscale models [94–96], the
interface between two regions Ωs and Ωm is denoted by Γ, which is predetermined by the channel structure
and does not change during our simulation.
A number of properly charged atoms about 1.8Å apart are positioned around the channel so that the
channel flow can be regulated by electrical charges. In reality, these charged atoms can be realized by appropriate dopants. The z-coordinate of the atoms along the channel length is determined first and then at each
cross section perpendicular to the channel axis, the atoms are aligned along a concentric circle whose size is
sufficiently bigger than that of the channel pore. The locations of the atoms are equally spaced according to
the circumference of the circle. Figure 2 shows an example of placing four negative charges around the channel
at z = 0Å. In the cross section on the xy-plane, we divide a concentric circle with radius 6.5Å into four parts
and then locate each anion as described in Fig. 2(a). Managing the number, magnitudes and signs of charges
enables one to generate various types of atomic charge distributions for the cylindrical nanofluidic channel.
3.2. Iterations of Poisson and Nernst-Planck equations
The MIB method is utilized to solve the interface problems Eqs. (10) and (19). Since these equations
are coupled, an iterative procedure is required to obtain convergent results. Here we outline this solution
procedure. To ensure that the iteration is convergent, Φ and Cα are updated by a successive over relaxation
(SOR)-like iterations
( new
Φ
= (1 − wp ) Φnew + wp Φold
Cαnew = (1 − wc ) Cαnew + wc Cαold ,
where wp and wc are appropriately selected between 0 and 1. This iterative procedure is efficient for ion
channel problems [18, 104]. The relaxation parameters wp and wc should be sufficiently close to 1 to ensure
the convergence. They have little influence on computational results as long as the iteration is convergent [18].
Although the change of applied voltage or bulk ion concentration may requires a number of iteration steps,
the convergence is still maintained [104]. In this computation, the values for both relaxation parameters are
fixed at wp = wc = 0.9. If the iteration is divergent, we adjust these values to wp = wc = 0.8.

After the electrostatic potential Φ and the ionic concentration Cα are iteratively solved, the electric current
is computed at each cross section inside the channel along the channel axis [104]. For each ionic species α, its
current is calculated by

where S is the cross section in the xy-plane. The total current is the sum of two ionic currents. Actually,
there is no significant change along the location of the cross section and hence the current through the center
of the channel axis is usually chosen to elucidate the current-voltage (I-V) relation.
4. Convergent Validation
In this section, we construct analytically solvable systems to validate the proposed numerical methods.
The analytic solution of the PNP equations is unknown for realistic geometries. However, it is a standard
procedure to design analytical solution for slightly modified PNP equations which share the same mathematical
characteristic with the original PNP equations [104]. Consequently, the numerical convergence of designed
solution algorithms can be validated.
We first present the analytical solution to a set of PNP-like equations. Additionally, we consider two simple
examples, one with a single atomic charge, and the other with eight atomic charges, to verify the second order
convergence of our numerical methods. Finally, both a negatively charged nanofluidic channel and a bipolar
nanofluidic channel are utilized to further validate the proposed numerical methods.
We set m = 1 and s = 80 in all the numerical tests in this section. Therefore, there is a sharp discontinuity
in the dielectric coefficients across the solvent-solute interface.
4.1. Analytical solution system
We consider a set of Nf charged atoms at rk with fixed charge Qk , where k = 1, 2, · · · , Nf in Ωm . The
geometry of the analytically solvable system can be arbitrary in principle. However, one can refer to the
cylindrical geometry described in Section 3.1 with the cross section of the cylinder illustrated in Fig. 3. We

Figure 4: Illustration of the geometries of two test cases. (a) A cylindrical nanochannel with a single negative charge;
(b) A cylindrical nanochannel with eight negative charges.

We first test the cylindrical channel with a single atomic charge which is placed at (6.5, 0, 0) and whose
charge is −0.08ec as shown in Fig. 4(a). The set of analytical solutions of the PNP equations introduced in
Section 4.1 is used to compare with numerical results by solving Eq. (??). Table 1 demonstrates numerical
errors and convergence orders for different number of computational nodes. The fixed charge of the atom
influences on the accuracy of the electrostatic potential Φ and the negative charge of the atom enhances the
errors and reduces the orders of the negative ion concentration C2 . It is interesting to note that the simulation
attains a good second order convergence.
4.3. A cylindrical nanochannel with eight atomic charges
Next, we explore this cylindrical channel with eight atomic charges outside the nanochannel. Consider two
cross-sections perpendicular to the channel length at z = −11Å and z = 11Å as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). In
order to put negative ions same distance away from the cylinder surface and same angle difference between
two atoms, we employ the polar coordinate system. The distance between each atom and the origin is always
6.5Å and the angle from the positive x-axis is increased by a right angle. Therefore, the coordinates of these
atoms are as follows:

for i = 1, 2, 3, and 4. At each cross section, we obtain four point charges that are equally spaced. As shown
in Table 2, the errors and orders in solving the PNP equations with this atomic charge setting generates
little difference from those with a single atomic charge. This validation test also indicates the second order
convergence of our methods.

4.4. A negatively charged nanofluidic channel
Now, we perform another numerical test to verify the convergence and accuracy of the proposed PNP calculation on nanofluidic channels. A negatively charged nanochannel, or a unipolar nanochannel is constructed.
The channel length on the z-axis is divided into 27 subdivisions. At each circular cross section, eight charged
atoms which are 1.5Å apart from the cylinder surface are equally spaced. Each atom has a charge of −0.08ec
and is about 1.8Å apart from other charges.
First of all, we examine colored surface plot and contour plots of electrostatic potential distributions
along the negatively charged channel by computing Eq. (??). The computational results are demonstrated in
Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 6. Figure 5 is useful to understand the atomic charges of the nano-scaled channel. Moreover,
it is interesting to notice that our proposed PNP solver works very well with nanofluidic channels from the
fact that the boundary line of the channel are obvious to identify in contour plots.
Figure 5(a) shows the electrostatic potential profiles over the surface of the negatively charged channel.
Most of the parts of the channel surface have blue colors. Since the blue colors indicate the negative electrostatic
potential values, it is obvious that the channel surface possesses negative charge. Additionally, three contour
plots are described in Fig. 6 at z = −10Å, z = 0Å and z = 10Å. In every picture, the right outside of the
channel is dark blue, which also implies the channel surface is negatively charged.
Then we use the same analytical solutions (??) and (??) to find the numerical errors and orders. The results
are given in Table 3. Through this test, we observe that our proposed PNP numerical schemes achieve the
second order accuracy in computing the potential and ion concentrations for the negatively charged channel.
4.5. A bipolar nanofluidic channel
We also consider a bipolar nanofluidic channel which functions as a nanofluidic diode. It is a nano-sized
channel whose atomic coordinates are the same as those of the aforementioned negatively charged nanochannel.

Figure 6: Three contour plots of electrostatic potential profiles of the negatively charged channel at z = −10Å,
z = 0Å and z = 10Å on the xy-plane when the mesh size is h = 0.2Å.

However, its charges are altered from positive to negative or vice versa at the middle of the channel axis [21, 27].
In our bipolar channel, the first half cylinder is affected by atoms with charge of 0.08ec and the atomic charges
on the other half are −0.08ec .
The computational results of the electrostatic potential through the bipolar channel is shown in Fig. 5(b)
and Fig. 7. From Fig. 5(b), we are able to see that the atomic charges are changed from positive to negative.
Such properties of the bipolar channel are also clearly manifested in the cross-sectional results in Fig. 7. When
we compare the contour plots in Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(c), it is a little bit difficult to distinguish the colors of
the outside of the bipolar channel. However, the channel inside clearly shows different colors, which indicates
that the change of atomic charges influences the ion transport through the channel.
The validation of our numerical methods for the bipolar channel is given in Table 4. Again, we see a good
second-order convergence for this test problem. In the next section, we apply our PNP simulator to study
three nanochannels.

increased. Consequently, more K+ ions (dashed line) are accumulated at the left part of the inner channel. However,
there is little change in the concentration of Cl− ion (solid line).

bution and bulk ion concentration. We investigate ion concentration distributions and electrostatic potential
profiles along the channel direction (z-direction) and their values are averaged over the xy-cross section at
each z. We also illustrate current-voltage (I-V) curves in which the current at the center of the channel pore is
used. Particularly, ion concentration distribution describes the movements of two different ion species through
a channel in detail and current-voltage characteristic clearly shows electrical features of a nanochannel. We
examine three kinds of nano-scaled channels, namely a negatively charged channel, a bipolar channel and a
double-well channel. We have used m = 2 and s = 80 for all computations in this section.
5.1. A negatively charged nanofluidic channel
In order to clarify the role of atomic charges in nanofluidic systems, we first consider a negatively charged
channel described in Section 4.4. The atomic charges of the channel are specified in Section 4.4. Here, all
of the ions around the channel have the negative sign. We vary the voltage at the end of the right reservoir
and keep bulk ion concentrations of both reservoirs unchanged. Therefore, applied voltage is the driving force
to relocate potassium ions and chloride ions within the nanochannel. The atomic charges determine the ion
selectivity of the nanochannel and bulk ion concentration affects the current migrated through the channel.
5.1.1. Effect of applied voltage
First, we study the impact of applied external voltage to behavior of ions traveling within a negatively
charged nanochannel. We set the bulk ion concentrations of K+ and Cl− as C0 = 0.01M and the charge of
each atom placed around the channel surface as Qk = −0.08ec . The voltage applied at left end of the system,
ΦL , is fixed at 0V and the voltage applied at right end of the system, ΦR , is increased gradually from 0V to
1V. The ∆Φ represents the difference between ΦR and ΦL , where ∆Φ = ΦR − ΦL . Figure 8 illustrates the
electrostatic potential and ion concentrations along the z−axis at the center of the channel pore in response to
the external voltage difference. In Fig. 8(a), as ΦR gets increased, the electrostatic potential at the right part
of the inner channel becomes dramatically higher. As a result, more cations are accumulated at the left part
of the inner channel as shown in Fig. 8(b). In fact, the negative atomic charges of the channel electrostatically
repel anions and attract cations, which makes the solution within the channel almost unipolar.

Figure 9: Ionic current for each ion species versus the applied potential difference ∆Φ. (a) The transport behavior of
the nanochannel without atomic charge; It should be noticed that we use different relative reference chemical potential
µα0 for different ion species, Therefore there is a small current difference between potassium and chloride ions. (b)
The transport behavior of a negatively charged channel when Qk = −0.08ec . Here, the bulk ion concentrations at
both reservoirs C0 = 0.01M are fixed. When Qk = 0ec , both current-voltage graphs are linear and the positive current
is roughly double of the negative current; on the other hand, when Qk = −0.08ec , the positive current-voltage graph
(square) is nonlinear and the negative current-voltage graph (triangle) is almost always zero. Moreover, the positive
current is much larger than the negative current and the difference gets increased as the voltage increases.

By comparing the current-voltage (I-V) curve of the negatively charged channel with that of an uncharged
one, we are able to clarify the effect of atomic charges in a nanometer channel. In these two graphs, the
current values are obtained using Eq. (??) at the cross section inside the channel which lies in the xy-plane
when z = 0Å. Figure 9(a) gives the relationship between current and voltage of each ion species for the same
dimensional nanochannel without atomic charge (Qk = 0ec ). Both of the ionic currents are proportional to the
applied voltage and the K+ current is roughly double of the Cl− current. In this case, the nanochannel obeys
the Ohm’s law and is non-selective. However, the negative atomic charges destroy the linearity of the positive
current-voltage characteristics and generate a large difference between two ionic currents as shown in Fig. 9(b).
This nonlinearity or deviation from the Ohm’s law is closely related to the non-proportionality between the
potential change within the channel and the applied voltage [28]. Since the negative atomic charges near the
channel surface hinder the access of Cl− ions, the negative current is almost zero for every applied voltage.
Thus we can conclude that a nanochannel with unipolar atomic charges generates a charged current mostly
composing of counterions which can be increased by providing more external voltage.
5.1.2. Effect of atomic charges near the channel surface
Next, we examine the effect of atomic charges on ionic flow through the negatively charged channel. Except
for the magnitude of Qk , we fix the bulk ion concentrations for both ion species at C0 = 0.01M and the applied
voltage difference at ∆Φ = 1V. A stronger negative atomic charge, i.e., a larger value of |Qk |, encourages the
cation accumulation inside the channel and prevents the anions from entering the channel. As a result, the
K+ current is increased and the Cl− current is decreased to near zero. In fact, the positive current is not
directly proportional to the magnitude of atomic charge because of a stronger diffusion induced by the larger
concentration gradient [28]. It is interesting to note that the channel current can be controlled by the atomic
charge amplitude. When the amplitude reaches a suitable threshold, almost all ions with the same sign of
charge with the channel atomic charge cannot penetrate through the inlet of the nanochannel. Therefore, the
proposed nanochannel has a near perfect ion selectivity.

17

Figure 10: Effect of atomic charges on a negatively charged nanochannel. The ionic current in response to the change of
the charge Qk of the atoms placed around the channel surface is depicted. Six different charges Qk = 0ec , Qk = −0.02ec ,
Qk = −0.04ec , Qk = −0.06ec , Qk = −0.08ec and Qk = −0.1ec are simulated when the bulk concentration is C0 = 0.01M
and the applied voltage difference is ∆Φ = 1V. Here, |Qk | is the magnitude of the charge of the atoms. As the magnitude
of the atomic charges is increased, the ionic current of K+ is sharply amplified as well. However, the ionic current of
Cl− is reduced to near zero.

Figure 11: Effect of bulk ion concentration on a negatively charged nanochannel. The total channel current versus
the external voltage difference (I-V) is shown at five different bulk concentrations C0 = 0.01M (square), C0 = 0.05M
(triangle), C0 = 0.1M (diamond), C0 = 0.2M (circle) and C0 = 0.4M (plus sign) when Qk = −0.08ec . As the bulk ion
concentration is increased, the total current gets higher and the I-V characteristics becomes near linear.

18

5.1.3. Effect of bulk ion concentration
Another important aspect which is necessary to understand the transport within a nanofluidic channel is the
bulk ion concentration. The electrical double layer produces a unique difference between a nanofluidic channel
and a microfluidic one. The bulk ion concentration is a crucial factor to determine the thickness of the double
layer. In fact, when double layers overlap inside a nanochannel, the aqueous solution confined in the channel
expresses charge opposite to the atomic charges of the nanochannel [26]. Figure 11 shows the total current as
a function of the applied voltage difference for five different bulk ion concentrations C0 = 0.01M, C0 = 0.05M,
C0 = 0.1M, C0 = 0.2M and C0 = 0.4M when the atomic charge Qk is assumed to be −0.08ec . As the bulk
ion concentration is increased, more cations penetrate through the channel and thus the total channel current
is dramatically increased. A higher bulk ion concentration reduces the double layer and the channel surface
becomes neutralized by the pulled counterions within the layer [28]. Consequently, the I-V graph becomes near
linear, i.e., obeying Ohm’s law. It is noted that a charged channel with high bulk ion concentration behaves
like an uncharged one, due to the decrease in the Debye length. This phenomenon is obviously manifested in
the positive ion concentration distributions in Fig. 12. Figure 12(a) shows the concentration profiles of the K+
ion along the x-direction at four different bulk ion concentrations C0 = 0.01M, C0 = 0.05M, C0 = 0.1M and
C0 = 0.2M. Figure 12(b) demonstrates the normalized concentration profiles, which are generated by scaling
each ion concentration with its bulk value C(r)/C0 . As illustrated in the figure, the Debye screening effect
can be observed by the concentration distributions, which are higher at the channel boundary and lower at
the channel center. Additionally, for the normalized concentration profiles, the lower the bulk concentration,
the higher the normalized concentration, which indicates the larger Debye-Layer.

and C0 = 0.2M with Qk = −0.08ec and ∆Φ = 0.4V being fixed. (b) Normalized ionic concentration distributions of
(a)indicates the large Debye-Layers for lower bulk ionic concentrations.

The normalized current is considered to assure that a higher bulk ion concentration weakens the role of
atomic charges. The normalized current is computed by dividing the current through the negatively charged
channel by that through the uncharged one at several bulk ion concentrations. Excluding the atomic charges,
both channels have the same voltage difference and the same bulk ion concentration. Figure 13(a) represents
the normalized ionic current for each ion species and Fig. 13(b) shows the normalized total channel current.
In both figures, the normalized values get close to one as the bulk ion concentration is increased, which implies
that the charged channel with a high bulk ion concentration does not demonstrate much atomic charge effect
in the transport phenomena.

concentration. The atomic charge Qk = −0.08ec and the applied voltage difference ∆Φ = 1V are fixed. The normalized
current is the quotient of the current of the negatively charged channel and the current of the uncharged channel when
Qk = 0ec . As the bulk ion concentration gets larger, the normalized value becomes almost one. The negatively charged
channel with a sufficiently larger bulk ion concentration behaves like a uncharged channel.

5.2. A bipolar nanofluidic channel
In this section, we examine a bipolar channel whose size and atomic charge constitution are described in
Section 4.5. In this channel, the first half of the channel is positively charged and the second half is negatively
charged. A bipolar channel can behave like a p-n junction. Therefore, it is interesting to explore the transport
properties of the bipolar nanochannel.
5.2.1. Effect of applied voltage
We first consider three types of voltage bias across the channel length. One case is called no bias in which
both ends of the system have zero voltage. Another case is named a forward bias, for which the voltage applied
at the right end of the system is 1V. The other case, on the contrary, is referred a reverse bias, for which the
voltage at the left end of the system is 1V. Additionally, we fix the bulk ion concentration of KCl at 0.1M and
set the amplitude of atomic charge |Qk | to 0.08ec . Figure 14 compares the electrostatic potential profiles and
ion concentration distributions along the z-direction in each case.
As shown in Fig. 14(i-a), when ∆Φ = 0V, the electrostatic potential is high under the positive atomic
charge, but it is low under the negative atomic charge. Subsequently, the ion concentration is plotted in the
opposite way in Fig. 14(i-b). Generating the potential gap ∆Φ between two ends of the system brings about
two peculiar phenomena within the bipolar channel. At the forward bias with ∆Φ = 1V, the electrostatic
potential is gradually increased (Fig. 14(ii-a)), but at reverse bias with ∆Φ = −1V, it is sharply decreased
(Fig. 14(iii-a)). These two results are quite conjunctive with the ion concentration curves in the way that the
flux is invariable along the channel axis at steady state and thus the main factor altering the potential is the
ion distribution [27]. As plotted in Fig. 14(ii-b), under the forward bias, both ion species are attracted to
the junction, so the peak value of the ion concentration is greater than that under no bias. However, under
the reverse bias, both ion species are moved away from the junction and each one produces a small pile at
the opposite atomic charge as presented in Fig. 14(iii-b). Accordingly, the forward bias brings about an ion
accumulation zone at the channel junction, whereas the reverse bias creates an ion depletion zone there.
Figure 15 shows the current-voltage curves of each ion species in the bipolar channel. While both current
graphs are almost zero at every reverse bias, they are monotonically increased as the potential difference gets
bigger. This result comes from the two facts that the ion-depletion zone under reverse bias terminates the
flow inside the bipolar channel, but the ion-accumulation zone under forward bias encourages more ions to

∆Φ = 0V, (ii) forward bias ∆Φ = 1V and (iii) reverse bias ∆Φ = −1V, where ∆Φ = ∆ΦR − ∆ΦL . We assume the
bulk ion concentration C0 to be 0.1M and the atomic charges of the channel at left and right halve, respectively, to be
0.08ec and −0.08ec . With forward bias, both ions tend to be accumulated at the middle of the channel length, whereas
with backward bias, both ions tend to be depleted at the junction of the channel.

|Qk | = 0.08ec and the bulk ion concentration C0 = 0.1M are assumed. Under reverse bias, both ion species cannot
pass through the channel. However, under forward bias, the currents of both ion species get enlarged. Especially, the
cation current (square) increases faster according as ∆Φ increases.

pass through the channel. Moreover, the positive ionic current enhances more abruptly. Another remarkable
discovery from the current-voltage characteristics is that a higher applied voltage reduces the gradient of the
curve, which is analytically discussed in the literature [27]. Therefore, by managing the external voltage, one
can turn on and off the current through the bipolar nanochannel.
5.2.2. Effect of atomic charge
Figure 16 depicts the channel current in response to the applied voltage difference at |Qk | = 0.04ec ,
|Qk | = 0.08ec and |Qk | = 0.12ec . Here, we set the bulk ion concentration at two reservoirs to 0.1M. In every
case, the total current gets enlarged as ∆Φ becomes larger. Moreover, the rate of change of the current with
respect to the voltage difference gets slower. The highest atomic charge amplitude, that is, |Qk | = 0.12ec has
the greatest amplitude of the current curve. In contrast, the lowest atomic charge amplitude does not fully
draw both ion species at either sides under the reverse bias and thus at some negative voltage differences the
current is nonzero. It is interesting to note that the channel current within a bipolar nanofluidic channel can
be perfectly regulated if the atomic charges satisfy an appropriate threshold.
5.2.3. Effect of bulk ion concentration
We also test our bipolar channel at two different bulk ion concentration, namely, C0 = 0.05M and C0 =
0.2M, and compare the total current-voltage graphs with that at C0 = 0.1M as described in Fig. 17. Every
current-voltage curve nearly vanishes when ∆Φ is negative, but significantly increases when ∆Φ is positive.
At higher bulk ion concentration, more ions are accumulated at the middle of the bipolar channel, so the total
current gets bigger. Moreover, it has the maximum amplitude and gradient of the current alteration with
respect to the voltage difference. To this end, it is expected to surmise that bulk ion concentration promotes
the quantity of the total current through the bipolar channel. Our computational outcomes are in a good
agreement with other numerical studies in the literature [27].
5.3. A double-well nanofluidic channel
Finally, we consider a double-well nanofluidic channel which is named after the shape of the electrostatic
potential curve. The electrostatic potential through the channel axis in a cylindrical channel may have several

i.e., |Qk | = 0.04ec (square), |Qk | = 0.08ec (triangle) and |Qk | = 0.04ec (diamond) are studied. Here, the bulk ion
concentration C0 of K+ and Cl− is fixed at 0.1M. All I-V curves increase when ∆Φ varies from −1V to 1V. Greater
magnitude of the atomic charges results in higher channel current with forward bias, but insufficient atomic charge
may weaken the depletion zone with reverse bias and so there is a leakage.

bulk ion concentrations, i.e., C0 = 0.05M, C0 = 0.1M and C0 = 0.2M are studied. The atomic charges are given by
|Qk | = 0.08ec . As the bulk ion concentration gets higher, the amplitude and gradient of the current-voltage relationship
gets maximized.

potential wells by modifying atomic charge distribution. In fact, one of the most well-known biological channels,
Gramicidin A channel, has a double-well transmembrane ion channel [104]. In this section, we design a
cylindrical channel whose electrostatic potential curve has a double-well structure by varying the sign of

of the applied voltage between two ends of the system. The bulk concentration is C0 = 0.05M for both ions K+ and
Cl− . Two dashed vertical lines indicate the ends of the cylindrical channel. The electrostatic potential graphs shows
two potential wells, which brings about two piles of K+ ions along the channel axis. Moreover, higher applied voltage
at the left end of the system, ΦL , breaks the symmetry of the potential wells. The left well becomes weaker and the
right well becomes stronger. Consequently, the concentration of K+ ions (dashed line) at the left pile becomes lower,
but there is little change in the concentration of K+ ions at the right pile.

atomic charges. As illustrated in Fig. 18, the middle section of the nanochannel is positively charged, but the
other parts of the channel are negatively charged.

Figure 20: Effect of bulk ion concentration on the channel current for a double-well nanofluidic channel. The total
channel current versus the external voltage difference (I-V) are studied at four different bulk concentrations: C0 = 0.01M
(square), C0 = 0.05M (triangle), C0 = 0.1M (diamond), and C0 = 0.2M (circle). With a high bulk ion concentration,
the total current gets increased and the I-V characteristics becomes linear.

5.3.1. Effect of applied voltage
At first, we alter the applied voltage, but fix bulk ion concentration at C0 = 0.05M and the atomic charge
distribution as described in Fig. 18. Here, ΦR is set to be 0V and ΦL is increased gradually from 0V to 1V.
Figure 19 presents the electrostatic potential and ionic concentration along the channel length. On the left
hand side of the inner channel, the electrostatic potential becomes higher, which results in moderating the left
potential well as in Fig. 19(a). Subsequently, the positive ion concentration shows a dramatic change on the
left hand side. Moreover, the small change in the potential at the right hand side of the channel corresponds
to the small change in the concentration profile on the right.
5.3.2. Effect of bulk ion concentration
As in Fig. 20, the increase in the total current through the double-well channel is derived from the increase
in the bulk ion concentration. Herein, the external voltage difference is the same (∆Φ = −1V). Like the
negatively charged channel, the I-V relation becomes linear as the bulk ion concentration gets multiplied.
These results are consistent with those observed from both numerical simulations [104] and experimental
measurements [11] of the Gramicidin A channel. Therefore, atomic design of 3D nanofluidic channels proposed
in the present work can be used to study biological channels, which is particularly valuable when the structure
is not available.
6. Concluding Remarks
Recently the dynamics and transport of nanofluidic channels have received great attention. As a result,
related experimental techniques and theoretical methods have been substantially promoted in the past two
decades [4, 8, 90]. Nanofluidic channels are utilized for a vast variety of scientific and engineering applications,
including separation, detection, analysis and synthesis of chemicals and biomolecules. Additionally, inorganic
nanochannels are manufactured to imitate biological channels which is of great significance in elucidating

25

ion selectivity and ion current controllability in response to an applied field in membrane channels [68, 78].
Molecular and atomic mechanisms are the key ingredients in the design and fabrication of nanofluidic channels.
However, atomic details are scarcely considered in nanofluidic modeling and simulation. Moreover, previous
simulation of transport in nanofluidic channels has been rarely carried out with three-dimensional (3D) realistic
physical geometry. Present work introduces atomistic design and simulation of 3D realistic ionic diffusive
nanofluidic channels.
We first proposes a variational multiscale paradigm to facilitate the microscopic atomistic description of
ionic diffusive nanochannels, including atomic charges, and the macroscopic continuum treatment of the solvent
and mobile ions. The interactions between the solution and the nanochannel are modeled by non-electrostatic
interactions, which are accounted by van der Waals type of potentials. A total energy functional is utilized
to put macroscopic and microscopic representations on an equal footing. The Euler-Lagrange variation leads
to generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Unlike the hypersurface in our earlier differential
geometry based multiscale models [94–96], the solid-fluid interface is treated as a given profile. A domain
characteristic function is introduced to replace the hypersurface function in our earlier formulation.
Efficient and accurate numerical methods have been developed to solve the proposed generalized PNP
equations for nanofluidic modeling. Both the Dirichlet-Neumann mapping and matched interface and boundary
(MIB) methods employed to solve the PNP system in 3D material interface and charge singularity. Rigorous
numerical validations are constructed to confirm the second-order convergence in solving the generalized PNP
equations.
The proposed mathematical model and numerical methods are employed for 3D realistic simulations of ionic
diffusive nanofluidic systems. Three distinct nanofluidic channels, namely, a negatively charged nanochannel,
a bipolar nanochannel and a double-well nanochannel, are constructed to explore the capability and impact
of atomic charges near the channel interface on the channel fluid flow. We design a cylindrical nanofluidic
channel of 49Å in length and 10Å in diameter. Several charged atoms of about 1.8 angstrom apart are equally
located outside the channel to regulate nanofluidic patterns. For the negatively charged channel, all of the
atoms have the negative sign; on the other hand, for the bipolar channel, half of them has the negative sign
and the other half has the positive sign. A double-well channel has positively charged atoms at the middle
and negatively charged atoms on the remaining part of the channel. Each end of the channel is connected
to a reservoir of KCl solution and both reservoirs have the same bulk ion concentration. Asymmetry in the
applied electrostatic potentials at the ends of two reservoirs gives rise to current through these nanochannels.
We perform numerical experiments to explore electrostatic potential, ion concentration and current through
the channels under the influence of applied voltage, atomic charge and bulk ion concentration.
The negatively charged channel generates a unipolar current because the negative atomic charge attracts
counterions, but repels coions. The current within the nanochannel increases when external voltage, magnitude of atomic charge and/or bulk ion concentration are increased. However, the bulk ion concentration
has a limitation in its growth because a larger bulk ion concentration shortens Debye length and thus the
charged channel may behave like an uncharged one showing the Ohm’s law. The bipolar channel can create
accumulation or depletion of both ions in response to the current direction. When the right end has a higher
voltage, both ions are stored at the junction of the channel length. On the contrary, when the left end has a
higher voltage, both ions are moved away from the junction. Applied voltage, atomic charge and bulk ion concentration affect the amplitude and gradient of the current-voltage characteristic. At last, the special atomic
charge distribution of the double-well channel produces the electrostatic potential profile with two potential
wells. Increasing applied voltage at the left hand side of the system results in an obvious change in the left
potential well and the K+ concentration on the left.
The present study concludes that the properties and quantity of the current though an ionic diffusive
nanochannel can be effectively manipulated by carefully altering applied voltage, atomic charge and bulk ion
concentration. Our results compare well with those of experimental measurements and theoretical analysis in
the literature. Since the physical size of model is close to realistic transmembrane channels, the present model
can be utilized not only for ionic diffusive nanofluidic design and simulations, but also for the prediction of
membrane channel properties when the structure of the channel protein is not available or changed due to the
mutation.
Non-electrostatic interactions, are considered in our theoretical modeling but are omitted in the present
numerical simulations to focus on atomistic design and simulation of 3D realistic ion diffusive nanofluidic
channels. However, non-electrostatic interactions can be a vital effect in nanofluidic systems. A systematical

26

analysis of non-electrostatic interactions is under our consideration.
