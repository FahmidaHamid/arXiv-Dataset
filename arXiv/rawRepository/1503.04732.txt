Abstract
We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is responsible for periodic
sometogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is one of the main regulators of various cellular
functions, and switching of various oscillating states by investigating p53−Wnt model. The variation
in Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to different states,
stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin
concentration in Wnt could able to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set
of coupled ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state approximation. We,
further, demonstrate the change of p53 and Gsk3 interaction rate, due to hypothetcal catalytic reaction
or external stimuli, can able to regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control
their dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).
Keywords: p53 activation, Fixed point oscillations, Nutlin,Wnt, Sustain oscillations.

Introduction
p53, one of the largest hub in cellular network [1, 2], is considered to be one of the most important
key regulators of cellular metabolic pathways [3, 4], regulates a number of cellular functions [5] and its
dynamics control even the fate of the cell when stress is given to the cell [6]. Further, p53 suppression is
observed in various types of cancer either due to mutations or by ambiguous expression of control systems
like M DM 2 (or HDM 2 its human equivalent) [7]. It is negatively regulated by the M DM 2 [8], and
functions as an E3 ligase which mediates the proteosomic degradation of p53 [9,10], facilitates the diffusion
of p53 in the nucleus [11], which in turn lowers the level of p53 within the cell [12]. In stressed cells, the
p53 triggers the cell to cell cycle arrest forcing it to choose its fate, either to repair or apoptosis [13–15].
p53 dynamics is regulated by various signaling molecules as evident from various experimental and
theoretical reports [16]. On of the most important inhibitor of p53−M DM 2 is nutilin [17]. It is a selective
small molecule which directly binds to binding pocket of M DM 2 [18], to activate p53 pathway [18, 19],
and inhibiting p53 binding to M DM 2 [20]. N utilin − 3a and 3b are the two most active enantiomorphs
that are found to up-regulate the p53 in p53 dependent manner [21]. Further, it is also demonstrated
that nutlin-3 induces anti-angiogenic activities in endothelial cells probably via three mechanisms; first
by inhibiting endothelial cell migration; second by inducing cell cycle arrest; and third by increasing
apoptotic tendency in endothelial cells [22]. Further, it was also shown that nutlin-3 treatment in these
cells leads to accumulation of p53 [23], indicating the important impacts of nutlin-3 which interferences
the p53-M DM 2 regulatory mechanism. As a consequence, it was shown that N utilin-3 stabilizes the
p53 dynamics and causes the activation of survival pathways [23].
Somitogenesis in vertebrates is periodic formation of somites (vertabrae precursors) in the anterior
presomitic mesoderm tissue (PSM) controlled by complex gene network known as segmentation clock [24],

2
where, Notch, Wnt pathways [25, 26] and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are the main components [27].
Further, it has been shown that these three main pathways generate rhythms of specific oscillation relationships [27], and cross-talk among them [28] as a basis of spatio-temporal self-organization of patterns
during sometogenesis [29]. This physiological oscillations is responsible for periodic spacing of somites,
dynamic structures and regular segmented development in vertebrates [29]. In some studies in normal
(stress) and cancerous cells, it has been reported that p53 and Wnt modules are being coupled and
cross-talk between them via different intermediate proteins or genes or signaling molecules [30–32]. The
studies also reported that p53 network suppresses the Wnt signaling cascade [31]. The Wnt signaling
plays a pivotal role in determination of cell fate, which may probably through p53 interaction [31, 32],
but still it is not clear yet. Further, several other works reported that the intercellular signaling of Wnt
depends on the β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) [33]. Moreover, p53 can regulate the
dynamics of Axin2 and GSK-3 [34]. Recently, it is also reported that the miR − 34 family, which is
directly transcribed by the p53, links p53 with Wnt signaling [32], in this process, and a set of GSK-3related Wnt genes, are directly targeted by p53 and miR-34. These observations clearly suggest the close
connection between the p53 functionalities and Wnt in stress and cancer cells [30, 32]. However, the way
how p53 interacts with Wnt during sometogenesis and its impact on somite organization/reogranization
at molecular level is still an open question.
GSK-3, which is an important coupling molecule between p53 and Wnt pathways, is widely expressed
in broad range of cellular processes and being a Ser/Thr kinase it is a multifunctional protein [35, 36]. It
is active under resting condition and act as a core regulator in various disease pathways like cancer [35].
Being a kinase, it confers selectivity and substrate specificity [35]. It also largely acts as a phosphorylating
and an important signaling agent for the degradation of large number of proteins, such as β-catenin in
Wnt pathway [37]. Further, it is a central player in Wnt signaling pathway recruited with the Axin2 at
the Frizzle receptor for the activation of Wnt signaling [38]. In absence of Wnt signals GSK-3 shows its
activity in the protein destruction complex with Axin2, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and other
partners mediating the destruction and phosphorylation of β-catenin [39]. GSK-3 also mediates p53
dependent apoptosis signaling by suppressing p53-AKT pathway. The role GSK − 3 as a mediator of p53
and Wnt cross-talk is not fully understood. The impact of other Wnt regulators in Wnt pathway and
how they regulate p53 dynamics, and vice versa, are needed to be investigated in order to understand
how segmentation clock works.
We study the coupling of Wnt oscillator which is one of the three important clocks in sometogenesis in
vertabrates and p53 regulatory network to understand how does these two oscillators regulates each other
and process information during somite formation and pattern organization. Since p53 interferes various
other cellular functions, it will be interesting to understand its regulating impacts on segmentation clock
and vice versa. Presently we study these phenomena by modeling this p53-Wnt two oscillator model
with updated interaction between them from various experimental reports and how do they regulate each
other. We organize our work as follows. The detailed description of the model and techniques is provided
in materials and methods section. It is followed by mathematical treatment of the model, the numerical
simulation results and its discussion in the next section. We then draw come conclusions based on the
results we obtained and discussion on it.

Materials and Methods
A. Coupling p53-Wnt Oscillators Model
The Wnt signaling pathway is authorized by β-catenin regulation via various intermediate interaction
steps (Fig. 1) [40,41]. In this signal processing, Wnt promotes the synthesis of Dishevelled (Dsh) protein,
and then inhibits GSK3 protein kinase [27]. GSK3, then interacts with Axin (with rates k1 and k2 for
forward and backward reactions as in Fig.1) in the presence of β-catenin to form transient complex which

in turn phosphorylates β-catenin into β-catenin-P (with rate rate k6 ) [27, 41]. The β-catenin-P degraded
quickly with rate k14 , on the other hand it is dephosphorylated with rate k3 to form freed β-catenin and
then degraded with a rate k13 [42]. The free β-catenin is then transported to nucleus (β-catenin-n) with
rate k4 , on the other hand β-catenin-n is transpoted from nucleus to cytoplasm with another rate k5 .
Then β-catenin-n promotes the transcription of set of target genes including mAxin (mRNA of Axin,
specifically homolog Axin2 in PSM tissue) at the rate k15 , with rate k16 , and mAxin also degrades with a
rate k18 [43]. On the other hand mAxin translates to Axin with a rate Axin protein which also degrades
with a rate k23 . This mechanism of Axin is just like a negative feedback loop which drives the oscillations
in the network components. Thus Axin2 is the essential target of the Wnt pathway because it inhibits
the Wnt signals by degrading the β-catenin by forming a negative feedback loop [44].
The Wnt pathway communicates with the p53 Oscillator [45–47] through GSK3 by formation of a
binary complex p53 − GSK3 with the free available p53 at the rate k39 . Then this complex p53 − GSK3
degrades at the rate k40 to the free p53 and GSK3 proteins [48]. p53 and M DM 2 regulate each other

4
with feedback mechanism where formation and decay of various intermediate complexes are involved with
different rates (Fig. 1) as described in Table 1 and 2 [45]. The freely synthesized Nutilin directly interacts
with M DM 2 with a rate k36 to form a complex N utM DM 2, and then this complex dissociates to release
back free Nutlin and M DM 2. Then Nutilin indirectly interacts with p53 via M DM 2 by affecting the
feedback mechanism between p53 and M DM 2. The Nutilin then degrades with rate constant k38 . Thus
the activated p53 can now go to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of a number of target genes
including M DM 2. M DM 2 is essential in controlling the concentration of p53 through a positive feedback
loop mechanism by making complex [49, 50].

Mathematical model of the network: Quasi steady state approximation
The stress p53 − W nt regulating network we study is defined by N = 13 molecular species (Table 1)
corresponding to the reaction network description provided in Table 2. The state of the system at any
instant of time t is given by the state vector, ~x(t) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xN )T , where, N = 13 and T is the
transpose of the vector. By considering feedback mechanism of in p53 and Wnt oscillators and coupling
reaction channels of the two oscillators, we could able to reach the following coupled ordinary differential

The coupled ODEs (equation (1)) are very difficult to solve analytically. However, one can get approximate analytical solution of these equations by using quasi-steady state approximation [51, 52]. In

5
general, any biochemical reactions network involves two basic types of reaction, namely slow and fast
reactions [51]. Therefore, the N = 13 variables in the system can be divided into sets of slow and fast
variables respectively. If ~xs (t) = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xl )T and ~xf (t) = (xl+1 , xl+2 , . . . , xN )T are slow and fast
T
variable vectors, then ~x(t) = ~xs , ~xf . Then from equation (1)-(14) along with Table I, we have,

Since the rate of complex formation is fast, and after this fast complex formation, the fast variables
immediately retain steady state (equilibrium). Then using Henri-Michaelis-Menten-Briggs-Haldane approximation [53], one can take quite fair assumption that the ODEs of variables of complex molecular
species reach steady state equilibrium quite fast compared with the time evolution of slow variables [51].

The thirteen ordinary differential equations are now reduced to six ordinary differential equations. This
allows to simplify the complex mathematical model to get approximate solutions of the system numerically
saving computational cost or analytically fron the reduced system if possible.
We used standard Runge-Kutta method (order 4) of numerical integration to simulate equation (refode) to find the solution of the variables listed in Table 1 for the parameter values given in Table 2. We
then analysed the constructed mathematical model to get possible approximate analytical solutions of
the variables (slow variables) using quasi-steady state approximation.

Results and Discussion
The cross talk between p53 and Wnt via Gsk3 subjected to different stress conditions induced by nutlin,
as well as Axin concentrations available in the system. In order to understand how they regulate each
other, we numerically simulated the coupled ordinary differential equations (1) with the parameters listed

in Table 2. The simulation results for the variable in the model are presented and compared to understand
the switching of different oscillating states induced by different stress conditions. The reason is that these
states of the oscillations in Wnt network are responsible for different behavior of regular somite formation,
and many other periodic phenomena during sometogenesis. The roles of Axin2, Gsk3, β-catenin and
Nutilin on the p53 network dynamics is discussed in the context of the model we presented. Further,
the signal processing between the two coupled network modules via the Gsk3 during sometogenesis is
studied under the stress p53 generating effect due to N utilin-3a. On the other hand, we also studied the
regulation of p53 by Wnt due to available Axin concentration in the system.

Driving Wnt oscillating states by p53
The p53 in p53 regulatory network can be induced stress by the available concentration of stress inducer
molecular species, N utlin−3a. The concentration level of N utlin−3a is proportional to the creation rate
constant of N utlin − 3a, k35 (Fig. 1). Therefore, computationally we can able to monitor the amount of
stress induced to p53 by changing the value of parameter k35 and supervising the dynamical behavior of
p53 (Fig. 2 and 3).
The dynamics of p53 (Fig. 2 upper left panels) for small values of k35 (k35 h0.07) show single spike due
to sudden stress, and due to small k35 values, the dynamics become stabilized indicating normal nature
of the system. Then, as the value of k35 increases, p53 dynamics show damped oscillation indicating
the inducing oscillation for certain interval of time (t ≈ [0, 4000] minutes for k35 = 0.18), and then its
dynamics become stabilized. The time interval of damped oscillation regime depends on the value of k35
and increases as k35 . This indicates that if the stress given to the system is small, the system first will go
to the stress or excited state (indicated by oscillatory behavior), repair back the changes in the system

and come back to the normal condition. For sufficiently large values of k35 (0.23 ≤ k35 ≤ 0.55) the p53
dynamics become sustain oscillation, where the responsed stress is optimal and sustains the stress for
t → ∞. Further increase in the value of k35 (k35 > 0.55) force the sustain oscillation of p53 to damped
oscillation whose time interval of damped oscillation decreases as k35 increases. This indicates that excess
stress in p53 due to Nutlin may become toxic to the system reflected in p53 dynamics. If we increase the
value of k35 (k35 > 1.3) the p53 dynamics become stabilized. This may probably the case of apoptosis
of the system. The results obtained are in consistent with the experimental observations which indicates
that acetylation of p53 is responsible for its activation and stabilization [54]. If we further increase the
value ofk35 ,p53 activation decreases maintainingp53 stability, but at higher values (≤35).
The two dimensional plots between p53 and Nutlin (Fig. 2 upper right panels) for different values
of k35 show different behaviors of the system, namely stable fixed point, damped oscillation towards a
fixed point, sustain oscillation, then damped and stabilized fixed point. This behaviors show the same
behaviors as shown in p53 dynamics for different values of k35 .
Similarly, we study the dynamics of Gsk3 as a function of k35 (Fig. 2 lower left panels) for corresponding values which we took for the case of p53. In this case also we found the similar behaviors as
we got in p53 case (Fig. 2), namely, stabilized, damped, sustain, then damped and stabilized states for
the corresponding values of k35 taken in p53 case. The two dimensional plots of Gsk3 and Nutlin (Fig.
2 lower right hand panels) show the evidence of the existence of the mentioned states.
Now we study the dynamics of Axin (Fig. 3 upper left panel) imparted by stress p53 via Gsk3 induced
by Nutlin concentration in the system. The signal of the stress p53 is processed by Axin via Gsk3 and
reflected the same states in Axin dynamics as obtained in p53. The Axin and β − Catenin dynamics
as a function of k35 , as well as two dimensional plots of these two molecules with Nutlin are similar

and β-catenin with Axin for same set of k22 and k35 parameter values.

qualitatively with the dynamics of stress p53 and Gsk3 (Fig. 2 and 3). This means that depending on
the values of k35 the stress p53 can able to generate and arrest the Axin and β − Catenin cycles. Thus the
dynamics of Axin and β − Catenin can be regulated by p53 and probably can control the Wnt oscillator.
This means that p53 regulation has strong impact on Wnt oscillation, and regulate various mechanisms
during sometogenesis.

Dynamics of p53 regulated by Wnt
The activation of Axin occurs after the Gsk initiation from the signal received at the membrane. The
Nutilin synthesis rate (k35 ) is kept constant in this case (k35 = 0.36), giving a slight stress to the system.
In order to understand how does Wnt oscillator regulate p53, we allow to change Axin synthesis rate k22
and see the dynamical behavior of p53 induced by Axin, which is one of the most important molecular
species in Wnt network module. The dynamics of the Axin and p53 for different values of k22 (Fig. 4).
For small values of k22 (k22 < 0.0002), Axin dynamics maintains lowest constant level, showing stabilized
state of the Axin dynamics (Fig. 4 lower left panels). The increase in the value of k22 allows the Axin
dynamics to switch from stabilized state to damped state for certain range of time and then become
stabilized. The co-existence of these two states (damped and stabilized states) takes place for a certain
range on k22 (0.0003 < k22 < 0.008). If we increase the value of k22 , the duration of damped oscillation
also increases. The switching of damped state to sustain oscillation state takes place for certain range of
k22 , 0.0087 < k22 < 0.015. Further increase in k22 force the sustain oscillation state to damped oscillation
state again, where the time interval of damped oscillation becomes smaller as k22 increases. If we increase
k22 value, then Axin dynamics landed to stabilized state.

We then show the dynamics of β− Catenin as a function of k22 (Fig. 4) which indicates the switching
of the three different states driven by k22 . In this case we could able to find sustain oscillation very quickly
indicating that the β−Catenin can be quickly switch to stress condition and easily. Similarly, β−Catenin
can reach second stabilized state (probably cycle arrest) quickly and easily as compared to other molecular
species. The dynamical behavior of β−Catenin is supported by two dimensional plots of β−Catenin and
Axin (Fig. 3 middle right panels) which exhibit fixed point oscillations (corresponding to two stabilized
states), attractor towards the stable fixed points (corresponding to two damped oscillations), limit cycle
(corresponding to sustain oscillation).
Now the dynamics of p53 as a function of k22 (Fig. 4 upper left panel) show that the patterns in
the dynamics of molecular species in Wnt oscillator are well captured in the p53 dynamics. The p53
dynamics exhibit the corresponding states, namely, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, as
observed in Axin and β−Catenin as a function of k22 with similar patterns and dynamics.
The important dynamical behaviors those have been captured in p53 dynamics due to change of
states in molecular species in Wnt oscillator are synchronous in states and time periods of dynamics. If
we look at the dynamics of Axin and β−Catenin as a function of k22 , we can easily observe two important
changes, (1) change in time period of oscillations of the molecular species, and (2) change in the pattern
of states. The increase in k22 force to decrease the time period of the Axin and β−Catenin dynamics. At
the same time the switching of the various states takes place. These changes in the Axin and β−Catenin
are systematically and synchronously well captured in qualitative sense in the p53 dynamics (Fig. 4)
during the communication of the two p53 and Wnt oscillators via Gsk3.

Amplitude death driven by Gsk3 and p53 interaction
We now study the impact of interaction of Gsk3 and p53 (k46 ) on Wnt and p53 cross talk driven by
Nutlin concentration level in the system (Fig. 5). The rate of interaction of p53 and Gsk3 can modulated
by external catalytic action or external stimuli regulating the interaction in the system.
Wnt cycle arrest induced by Nutlin
We calculated amplitudes of four molecular species Axin, β−Catenin, Gsk3 and M dm2 as a function
of k35 for five different values of k46 (Fig. 5 upper two rows). The amplitudes of the molecular species
for every values of k42 are calculated by averaging the amplitudes within the interval of time [100, 1500]
minutes. From the results we observe three different regimes for each value of k46 : first amplitude death
(AD) regime (for small k35 ); second finite amplitude or oscillation regime (OR) (for moderate k35 ); and
third amplitude death regime again (for large k35 ). The first AD regime may correspond to normal state
(stable state) of the system, and second AD regime may correspond to apoptosis (cycle arrest) of the
system. Further, we calculated maximum values of molecular species Axin, β−Catenin, Gsk3 and p53
for the correponding values taken above (Fig. 6 lower two rows of plots). The patterns obtained in these
plots are similar to the patterns of the amplitude plots of the corresponding molecular species.
In OR, the amplitude is finite and increases monotonically as a function of k42 , then reaches a
maximum amplitude, after which amplitude decreases slowly and then decreases monotonically. This is
the regime where the system is in activated or stress condition. It is also to be noted that as k46 increases
the amplitude also increases and the range of activated regime also increases. This means that increasing

11
k46 force the system to get activated quickly and protects the system from next stabilized regime (cycle
arrest or apoptosis regime). Therefore, even though increase in Nutlin concentration drives the system to
apoptosis regime quickly, one can modulate the interaction of p53 and Gsk3 to protect the system from
apoptosis upto significant range of Nutlin concentration level, so that the system can repair back from
toxic due to excess Nutlin to come back to normal condition.
p53 cycle arrest induced by Axin
Now we study the impact of p53 and Gsk3 interaction on the condition of activation of molecular species
of both the p53 and Wnt oscillators. We calculated the amplitudes of these molecular species as a function
of Axin concentration level in the system (k22 ) (Fig. 6 first two rows) for the same parameter values as
we had taken in the case of calculation of amplitudes of these molecular species with the variation of
Nutlin concentration in the system. For the same parameter values we also calculated the maxima of
these molecular species (Fig. 6 lower two rows).
The change in k22 drives the amplitudes of all the molecular species to different oscillation states
(AD, OR, AD) as we have obtain in the case of Wnt cycle arrest by k42 variation. The increase in
Axin concentration level in the system forces amplitudes of the molecular species variables to pass the
trajectories of first AD (normal condition), then OR (stress condition) and then second AD (cycle arrest
condition). However, in this case the amplitudes of the variables do not change much as a function k22 ,
but significant change in the range of second AD as a function of k46 . The results indicate the Axin
induced p53 cycle arrest, however, interaction of p53 and Gsk3 can able to protect the system from
apoptosis upto significant range of k22 so that the system can repair back to its normal condition.

Steady state solution of the system
Since the direct and exact analytical solution of the set of coupled nonlinear differential equations (1),
we used quasi steady state approximation [51, 52] to obtain approximation solution of the system. Using
steady state values of the fast

The equation (18) shows that x1 becomes constant (steady state) as t → ∞. However, x1 depends on
various other steady state variables as shown in equation (18) and (19).
We then solve ODE of x3 (t) in equation (16) for x3 , and the result is given by,
x3 (t) ≈

k3 − k14 x∗4

(20)

where, C2 is a constant. Here, in this solution, we can get that x3 stabilizes to a constant value at
sufficiently large time limit (t → ∞).

Conclusion
The cross talk between p53 and Wnt oscillators can influence each other such that the dynamics one
oscillator can regulate the dynamics of the other and vice versa. The concentration level of Nutlin can
drive the p53 network module to different oscillating states corresponding to different stress states of the
system. This changes in the oscillating states can be well communicated to Wnt network module via
Gsk3 and could able to regulate the Wnt functionalities. Further, this changes can well interfere and
give impact on the process of sometogenesis of Wnt network module. On the other hand, the available
concentration level of Axin in Wnt network module can also influence the dynamics of molecular species
variables in Wnt network module at different stress states. Then the information of these changes is well
process by the p53 network module via Gsk3 and capture the changes accordingly. This means that the
p53 and Wnt network modules can cross talk between them and regulate each other due to changes in
each oscillator by processing information between them. However, excess changes in each network module
can act as toxic to each module and arrest the cycle of the other, and vice versa.
We then demonstrate that any other changes in the regulation of the network module, may probably
by catalytic reaction or external stimuli which alters the rate of the reaction of a particular reaction, can

13
probably try to protect the system from apoptosis upto certain range of system’s condition within which
the system can repair back the changes to come back to normal condition. We attempt to numerically
demonstrate this phenomena by allowing the change in the rate constant of p53 and Gsk3 interaction and
clearly give a chance to both the p53 and Wnt network modules upto certain range of excess concentration
levels of Nutlin and Axin to protect themselves from cycle arrest, namely apoptosis. This means that one
important role of catalytic reaction and external stimuli (which do not affect the reactions and network
but rate of reactions) is to protect the system from apoptosis or system’s failure by giving a chance of
repair the failure or defect by itself within the system automatically. Therefore, we need to find out
various such reactions and stimuli in cellular network in order to control and prevent the cell from cell
death, due to cellular breakdown by diseases or other external mechanisms, by regulating these important
reactions and stimuli.
