Fundamental properties of macroscopic gene-mating dynamic evolutionary systems are investigated. A model is studied to describe a large class of systems within population genetics. We focus
on a single locus, any number of alleles in a two-gender dioecious population. Our governing equations are time-dependent continuous differential equations labeled by a set of parameters, where
each parameter stands for a population percentage carrying certain common genotypes. The full
parameter space consists of all allowed parameters of these genotype frequencies. Our equations are
uniquely derived from four fundamental assumptions within any population: (1) a closed system; (2)
average-and-random mating process (mean-field behavior); (3) Mendelian inheritance; (4) exponential growth and exponential death. Even though our equations are nonlinear with time-evolutionary
dynamics, we have obtained an exact analytic time-dependent solution — we have an exactly solvable model. Our findings are summarized from phenomenological and mathematical viewpoints.
From the phenomenological viewpoint, any initial parameter of genotype frequencies of a closed system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under time evolution, we show (1) the monotonic
behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) any genotype or allele that appears in the population will
never become extinct, (3) the Hardy-Weinberg law, and (4) the global stability without chaos in the
parameter space. To demonstrate the experimental evidence for our theory, as an example, we show
a mapping from the data of blood type genotype frequencies of world ethnic groups to our stable
fixed-point solutions. From the mathematical viewpoint, our highly symmetric governing equations
result in continuous global stable equilibrium solutions: these solutions altogether consist of a continuous curved manifold as a subspace of the whole parameter space of genotype frequencies. This
fixed-point manifold is a global stable attractor, attracting any initial point in any Euclidean fiber to
the fixed point where this fiber is attached. The stable base manifold and its attached fibers form a
fiber bundle, which fill in the whole genotype frequency space completely. We can define the genetic
distance of two populations as their geodesic distance on the equilibrium manifold. In addition, the
modification of our theory under the process of natural selection and mutation is addressed.

INTRODUCTION

Time evolution of population percentages labeled by
biological traits or genetic characteristics in a population
system is a main subject of studies for population
genetics and evolutionary biology ([1–6] and references
therein). Their governing laws may involve classical
genetics, which can be traced back to Mendel’s seminal
work [7]. Both the birth rate and death rate of a system
will change the population number. Also the mating
mechanism and inheritance laws will determine the
percentage weight of newborn biological traits. There
are abundant past researches and advance studying
population genetic questions and equations ( [1–6]). For
example, Wright and other pioneer researchers [1] favor
use of discrete difference equations to label each generation and the reproduction. However, the difference
equation does not manifest the dynamical properties as
transparently as the continuous differential equations,
pioneered by Fisher, Crow and Kimura, et al. [2, 3]. In
this work, we will formulate a set of exactly solvable
nonlinear differential equations with a first-order time
derivative to address population genetic questions.
Out of curiosity, the authors had posed the following
questions to ourselves many years ago [8]:
• How should we characterize an ecological or macroscopic biological system consisting of a large population
of many living beings within a mathematical framework?
• How can we characterize the time-dependent evolution of genetic diversity and genotype percentage of a
population driven by the mating process and population
growth?
• Is there a mathematical definition of genetic distance
between two population groups even within the same
species under the biological taxonomy? For example,
can we quantitatively define the mathematical genetic
distance of different ethnic groups of Homo sapiens,
human beings? What would be the genetic distance of
ethnic groups: Taiwanese, Cantonese, Japanese, Jewish,
Irish people, etc.? Similarly, can we quantitatively define
the relative genetic distances of other animal or plant
species (within the same species), such as Darwin’s
finches, studied in Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of
Species” [9]?

tions together with our four fundamental assumptions.
• Our theory incorporates exactly solvable models and
their mathematical properties describing population
genetic systems.
• Our theory provides an answer to each of the questions
we posed above.
To the best of our knowledge, the analysis closest to
ours in the literature is Ref.[10]. In Ref.[10], some exact
solvable models within a gene pool are analyzed, where
the monotonic evolutionary behavior is found. Our
model is similar to Ref.[10]’s model: Ref.[10]’s studies
a single locus for an arbitrary number of alleles with
or without distinguishing the sex; we study a single
locus, arbitrary number alleles in a two-gender dioecious
population. Though Ref.[10] reaches results similar to
ours, we find several new ingredients:
(1) The stable equilibrium solutions as a manifold.
(2) The parameterization of the equilibrium manifold.
(3) The experimental evidence of the model, such as
the blood type of human ethnic groups. We present the
experimental data of phenotype (Oexp ,Aexp ,Bexp ,ABexp )
in Table.I, III, IV. We present our corresponding theoretical prediction of genotype (Ot ,AAt , Ait ,BBt ,Bit ,ABi )
in Table.II, V, VI. See Sec.VIII for figures.
(4) The proposal to define the genetic distance of two
populations as their geodesic distance on the equilibrium
manifold in the genotype frequency space.
(5) The exact analytic solution in terms of a Euclidean
fiber bundle.
(6) Our work may be viewed as a unified framework
combining the exact analytic solutions of Ref.[10] with
the stability analysis of the Hardy-Weinberg law [11, 12],
together with a proper parameterization of stable
equilibrium manifold.
We believe that our work adds value to the literature.

To our amusement, however, even without any necessity of deep biological knowledge, we can independently
derive, from scratch, a set of exactly solvable governing
equations describing a universal large class of systems
addressing the issues of population genetics and evolutionary biology:

We will work out our model step by step. To characterize a population genetic system, the first step is to
find a good biological parameter to label the system.
The biological trait can be a genotype or phenotype.
Here we will use the genotype, the genetic makeup of
an individual. The genotype contains a set of choices of
possible alleles. We will focus on a genotype determined
by a single locus and an arbitrary number of alleles.
We will use the genotype frequency, the number of
individuals with a given genotype normalized by the
total number of individuals in the population. A set of
genotype frequencies provides the normalized parameter
to label the given population. Throughout the text,
we may also term this genotype frequency concept as
“percentage parameter ” or simply “parameter ” of the
given population. The full parameter space consists
of all allowed genotype frequencies of the population.
Under governing principles, the genotype frequency can
evolve under the time evolution.

tions in Sec.II. In Sec.III, IV: we derive the dynamical
governing equations under time evolution. We solve the
time-dependent exact analytic solution (see Fig.1 for an
illustration) from a set of coupled nonlinear differential
equations with first-order time derivatives. We are able
to show global stability, monotonic evolution, and no
chaos for any population system. We prove that any
genotype or allele that ever presents in the population
will never become extinct and also derive the HardyWeinberg law [11, 12] in Sec.IV.

In addition to the analytical work, we also found
experimental data strongly consistent with our study to
confirm the validity of our theory. Specifically, we examine the experimental data of the genotype frequency
of blood type [13] for (1) different ethnic groups and (2)
different countries, in Sec.III B. With strong evidence
and some expected error bars, the data can be rigorously
fitted into our stable equilibrium solutions of governing
equations. The stable equilibrium manifold can be
mapped to a continuous two-dimensional quadrant map.
This gives a panorama of how each ethnic group relates
to another one. See FIG.2 for an illustration. Our
result demonstrates that the laws of inheritance tend
to approach stable equilibrium rather than with the
usual chaos or complexity occurring in other nonlinear
systems. In addition to this standard case, we further
briefly analyze the case incorporating natural selection
and mutation.

FIG. 2. Here we take the blood type evolution model (3 alleles) presented in Sec.III B as an example. In this work, we establish
the mapping from (a) the stable equilibrium curved manifold (see Fig.1) to (b) the stable fixed-point quadrant parametrized
by (θ1 , θ2 ) defined in Sec.III B, see FIG.14,15. Our mapping parameterization may find its use for a correspondence to (c) the
geographical map of ethnic groups in the world, see FIG.13. We can define the genetic distance of ethnic groups using the
method presented in Sec.III B.

We anticipate that our analytical solutions may be a
good starting basis for understanding more sophisticated
models. With the experimental evidence between the
the world-ethnic-group blood type genotype frequency

data and our stable solutions, we believe that our stable
solutions and exact dynamical analytic solutions can be
applied to other macroscopic population genetic systems
(including human ethnic groups as well as other animals

4
or plants), as long as the system is approximately
obeying the assumptions we made. We hope that our
parameterization of analytic stable fixed-point solutions
can be an efficient map to characterize the stabilized
genotype frequencies. Our mapping may find its home
in the textbooks of population genetics and evolutionary
biology in the future.

II.

FOUR ASSUMPTIONS FROM
FUNDAMENTAL VIEWS

Here we start from scratch, by introducing the four
fundamental assumptions used to construct our model.
Our purpose lies in knowing how the genotype frequencies evolve under the mating process of a certain population system.
First, we focused on a system where the mating process is approximately closed inside itself. Hence, the
newborn generation is totally a production from the old
generation of the system. We should be aware that it
does not matter whether the population locates together
geographically. In this way, we could associate our model
to different ethnic groups of humans, because the mating process of each ethnic group is approximately closed
in each system. Hybrids between different ethnic groups
are usually minorities compared to the majority ethnic
groups.
Second, to determine the mating procedure, we assume
the mating is overall average and random, which is
intuitively reasonable under mean-field approximation.
This assumption would not be far away from reality, considering the balance within an overall large population
system. This assumption states no preference for the
mating in a certain system. For example, we consider
a system of n genotypes. Suppose Pi is the population
amount of the genotype i, and assume a half-male-halffemale population. The random mating mechanism of
the male amount Pk /2 mates with all types of the feP i /2
P
) = P2k ( PPi ), where P
male amount Pi /2 is P2k ( PP/2
is the total population. We interpret this expression as
the male amount multiplied by the probability to meet
certain types of female. On the other hand, we have
the female amount Pk /2 to meet all types of the male
amount Pi . Notice that the interchangeable Pk Pk term
counts only once (male k with female k); however, Pk Pj
(j 6= k) counts twice (male k with female j, and male j
with female k). The only mating dependence on a certain genotype is the population number of that genotype
- if the population number for a certain genotype is large,
then, it will have a greater chance to mate and also to be
mated with by other genotype; and vice versa. Overall,
this mechanism gives quadratic forms to the governing
equations. The mating within the same ethnic groups or
in a local geographical region plausibly obeys this second
assumption.
Third, we consider the simplest inheritance law, the

classical genetics: Mendelian inheritance, to relate the
transmission of hereditary traits (alleles) from the parents to the newborn generation. Although there is much
new progress in genetics study, Mendelian inheritance is
still a primary principle for capturing the main properties
of heredity.
Fourth, in order to make the system dynamic under
the time evolution, there must be a guideline for population growth. Here we consider the exponential growth —
Malthusian growth model. Again, this law adumbrates
the main feature of population growth with some acceptable deviations from the experiment. We will find later
that these assumptions are beneficial for having analytically exactly solvable solutions.
One can apply the model to other animal or plant mating systems under a similar inheritance law, if it basically
satisfies the above assumptions.
We summarize our four assumptions as follows:
(a) The mating of gene-holders is (approximately)
closed in a population system.
(b) The mating probability for a certain genotype
to another genotype, due to average-and-random
mating mechanism, is proportional to the product of
their population (quadratic form). It evolves under the
mean-field assumption.
(c) The probability of a genotype for the newborn
generation obeys the Mendelian inheritance.
(d) The accumulation of human population obeys the
exponential growth law, for both the birth and the
death processes.
We should be aware of the fourth assumption that
the exponential growth includes the balance between the
newborn and the dead. We denote the birth rate kb
and the death rate kd . The overall net growth rate is
k = kb − kd .
To derive the governing differential equations, implicitly we have another hidden assumption: the continuous
limit. Throughout our work, we will take the continuous
time t. The discrete positive integer population number
can be treated approximately as a continuous real number in a large population.

MODEL

Model of 2 Alleles: 1 Dominant Gene and 1
Recessive Gene
1.

Governing equations for population

We first consider the simplest model of our theory,
which begins with two alleles and a single locus, such
as one dominant gene A and one recessive gene a. We

5
take the hairstyle being curly or straight as an example,
which roughly obeys this kind of inheritance law. Dominant gene A shows the curly property; only inheritance
of no dominant gene shows the straight property. Curl
hair owners indicate their genotype must be either AA or
Aa. Straight hair owners’ genotype must be aa. Below
we denote the population parameters: H for AA, x for
Aa, and h for aa. H stands for the number of people in
the population carrying AA, x stands for the number of
people in the population carrying Aa, and h stands for
the number of people in the population carrying aa.
We now can write down the governing differential equations under a time t evolution of population number for
hairstyle based on 4 assumptions in Sec.II:

We denote the total population to be H + h + x = P .
d
,
These equations have a first-order time derivative dt
associating the left-hand-side (LHS) population changes
to the right-hand-side (RHS) birth and death effects.
Linear terms on the RHS represent the death amount per
unit time. Quadratic forms on the RHS represent the
newborn population per unit time following Mendelian
2
inheritance. Taking HP of dH
dt , for example, it represents
our second assumption that the probability for male H
to meet female H is H
P . The offspring of those parents
2
is definitely H. So there must be a term HP in the RHS
of the equation dH
dt , up to a constant factor. Now considering the Hx term, it can be either male H to meet
female x, or male x to meet female H. So the overall
effect must be 2Hx for the RHS newborn generation.
The 2Hx is separated into two parts: Hx for dH
dt and
,
because
Mendelian
inheritance
shows
the
offHx for dx
dt
spring of H and x parents has a half probability to be
H and another half to be x. Similarly, we can determine
all the other coefficients of quadratic terms by the same
arguments. The sum on the newborn part of the RHS
must be all the possibilities for any pair of genes (alleles),
(H + h + x) (H+h+x)
, and this is equal to P . We notice
P
that the sum of RHS is dP
dt , LHS is (kb − kd )P . This perfectly obeys assumption (d): dP
dt = (kb − kd )P = kP . We
next check that the model is self-consistent, and uniquely
determined by our four assumptions listed in Sec.II.

2.

Governing equations for percentages

Now we revise our equations via normalizing each
gene carrier population by the total population, using the percentage parameters, so called genotype fredP/dt
d G
quencies. Consider, dt
( P ) = P1 dG
dt − G P 2 , where
G is any one of H, h, x.
This turns out to be

have the governing equations for genotype frequencies:

(2)
x).

We notice that the death rate kd takes no effect on the
percentage governing equations. That is because the
death effect does not rearrange the percentage parameters, every percentage parameter just universally dies
away. Although the population parameter changes under
death effect, the genotype frequency does not.
For both Eq.(1) and Eq.(2), there is a permutation
symmetric group S2 symmetry by exchanging H ↔ h.

3.

Equilibrium solutions

We should be aware that there is a constraint H +
h + x = 1, and the limited range for each parameter.
The total degree of freedom is 3 − 1 = 2. Namely the
whole parameter space of population parameters are 3
dimensional, but the whole parameter space of percentage
parameters, the genotype frequencies, are 2 dimensional.
Our aim is to realize the time evolution properties of
this dynamical model. We first narrow down to see the
equilibrium solution, which is the solution fixed in the
parameter space without evolving under time evolution.
The solution are solved by setting the RHS algebraic
equations Eq.(2) to be zero. Among all expressions of
the algebraic solution, we find the following one is the
most appropriate representation:



 Heq (θ) =
heq (θ) =


 x (θ) =
eq

cos2 (θ)
(cos(θ)+sin(θ))2 ,
sin2 (θ)
(cos(θ)+sin(θ))2 ,
2 sin(θ) cos(θ)
(cos(θ)+sin(θ))2 .

(3)

It gives an one-to-one mapping between the equilibrium
solution (Heq , heq , xeq ) and θ, and shows the solution is
a 1-dimensional continuous manifold. This representation also shows the symmetry of H and h in governing equations relates to the symmetry of H and h in
equilibrium solution. The symmetry of θ1 ↔ π2 − θ1
relates to the S2 symmetry of H ↔ h. The S2 symmetry also results in a number of time-independent conserved quantities under Eq.(2). We find, for example,
d(H−h)
= d(2H+x)
= d(2h+x)
= 0. By the constraint
dt
dt
dt
H + h + x = 1, the three quantities H − h, 2H + x, and
2h + x are indeed the same equivalent conserved quantity. We can say the S2 symmetry results in 1 conserved
quantity, thus the dimensionality of fixed-point solutions
is 1, here parametrized by θ.

From the linear stability analysis to the exact analytic
time-dependent dynamical solution

By doing the linear stability analysis on the dynamical Eq.(2) with a small perturbation around this equilibrium solution Eq.(3), we find that it is stable with
eigenvalues 0, −1 [14] for the entire two-dimensional parameter space. The first eigenvector for the eigenvalue
0 corresponds to the marginal tangent direction [14] of
1-dimensional equilibrium solution. Surprisingly, the second eigenvector for the eigenvalue 1 is irrelevant and stab +b
ble perturbation [14] along the fixed direction H
h − 2b
x.
b
b
We define a new basis sb = H + h − 2b
x, and s is the
coordinate along sb.
It is well-known that nonlinear equations may have
complicated global properties, such as chaotic behaviors.
Usually the numerical simulation is required, and there
are seldom cases which analytic solution for time evolution is exactly solvable. However, below we will show
how to obtain the exact analytic time-dependent solution of Eq.(2). Our method is to change the description
of parameters in Cartesian coordinates (H, h, x) to parameters in curvilinear coordinates (θ, s). We transform
H, h, x to θ, s by the following:

 H(θ, s) = Heq (θ) + s,
h(θ, s) = heq (θ) + s,
(4)
 x(θ, s) = x (θ) − 2s.
eq
The transformation is well-defined for a 2-dimensional
one-to-one mapping with an inverse function:
(
2h+x
θ = tan−1 ( 2H+x
),
(5)
x2
s = Hh − 4 .
We could substitute this inverse transformation into
the equilibrium solution Eq.(3) to obtain the equilibrium
solution Heq , heq , xeq as the parameterizations of H, h, x:

 Heq = 14 (2H + x)2 ,
heq = 14 (2h + x)2 ,
(6)

xeq = 12 (2H + x)(2h + x).
This indicates two lessons. First, once we know the original set of genotype frequencies H, h, x as the initial condition, remarkably we can deduce the final equilibrium
Heq , heq , xeq . Second, (2H + x) and (2h + x), these two
numbers determine the final equilibrium. This implies,
for the same number set of (2H + x) and (2h + x), even
for different H, h, x, their final equilibriums are the same.
Substituting the reparameterization Eq.(4) to the governing equations Eq.(2), this not only decouples the parameters, but also decodes the equations to one timedependent equation and the other time-independent
equation:
 d
dt s = −kb s,
(7)
d
dt θ = 0.

Both are exactly solvable. Remarkably, we have transformed the nonlinear coupled differential equations Eq.(2) to the linear decoupled differential
equations Eq.(7).
We foresee in advance the equilibrium solution is a
global attractor, attracting all the points on the line direction of a certain given initial θ to the equilibrium point
of the same θ in the exponential decay way along the s
direction. Because each line direction for a θ is independent to each other with no intersection, this makes
our solution well-defined everywhere in the parameter
space. The global picture of time evolution is: giving
any initial value in the parameter space, there is only
one corresponding θ with a line direction of s connecting
that equilibrium point to the initial value; the time evolution of parameters will go along the line direction to
the equilibrium point in the exponential decay to reduce
the distance away from the equilibrium point.
The method for deriving the analytic solution is the
e e
following: for any given initial value H,
h and x
e, find
e
the corresponding set of θ, se. By Eq.(7),We then have

(H + h − 2b

old and new coordinate is well-defined, we can further
solve the new equations and replace the parameters from
θ, s to H, h, x by Eq.(5).
Hence, we achieve our exact analytic solution:

attracted to the thick black curve under time evolution.

Intuitively we would like to compare this model and its

7
analytic solution to experimental numerical data. It will
be more appropriate to fit the experimental data into the
equilibrium solution, because we can imagine that the
genotype frequencies have been more-or-less stabilized
within a closed population under the sufficient amount
of time-evolution.
For
this
1-Dominant-Gene-and-1-Recessive-Gene
(hairstyle) model, the observables of available experimental data are the phenotypes, the representative
biological characters, of curl (AA and Aa) and straight
(aa) hairs. The two phenotype frequencies with one
constraint, has 1 degree of freedom; this is the same
as the 1 degree of freedom of the continuous equilibrium solution. The fitting can be perfectly with no
error bar; however, this is due to the same degree of
freedom of correspondence, rather than the evidence of
successful description of this model. Hence, the hairstyle
experimental data cannot illustrate the validity of the
theory.
In the next, we shall turn to the next-simplest model:
3 alleles, such as 2 dominant genes and 1 recessive gene
case, for example, the blood-type model, to check the
experimental evidence of our theory.

We can further make the above 2-dimensional equilibrium parameterization an one-to-one mapping to (θ1 , θ2 ),
if we define that θ1 = 0, ∀θ2 shrinks into a point. Namely,
(θ1 , θ2 ) can be a well-defined one-to-one reparameterization of the equilibrium solution Eq.(11).
The linear stability analysis shows this system is again
locally stable with five eigenvalues 0, 0, −1, −1, −1 [14].
Here two 0 eigenvalues correspond to two eigenvectors
along the marginal tangent plane [14] of 2-dimensional
equilibrium solutions, three −1 eigenvalues correspond to
the stable perturbation [14] along the three eigenvectors
ob + b
a − 2b
x, ob + bb − 2b
y, b

c. Defining those eigenvectors as sb01 , sb02 , sb12 with coordinates s01 , s02 , s12 , we could
transform (o, a, b, x, y, c) of the whole parameter space (6dimensions with 1 constraint o+a+b+x+y +c = 1) to a
set of 5-dimensional new coordinates (θ1 , θ2 , s01 , s02 , s12 ):

There are four kinds of representative phenotypes

Eq.(11), which is mapped to (c) the 2-dimensional quadrant (θ1 cos(θ2 ), θ1 sin(θ2 )) parametrized by (θ1 , θ2 ), detailed
shown in FIG.5.

The dimensionality: We shall explain the physical
meaning on the dimensionality of the fibers and the stable base manifold. For both Eq.(9) and Eq.(10), there
is a permutation symmetric group S3 symmetry by exchanging A, B, i and their corresponding genotypes. The
S3 symmetry also results in time-independent conserved
quantities, spanned by o+a−2x, o+b−2y and a+b−2c,
with a constraint o + a + b + x + y + c = 1. There are
totally 2 independent degrees of freedom. We can say the
S3 symmetry results in the dimensionality of fixed-point
solutions is 2, here parametrized by θ1 , θ2 .

Experimental evidence - data fitting

As we mentioned, we would like to fit the available
blood type data - blood type population percentages
as genotype frequencies of any ethnic group, into
our equilibrium solutions on the stable 2-dimensional
manifold of Eq.(11). For a set of genotype frequencies (ii, AA, BB, Ai, Bi, AB), it totally forms a set
of 5-dimensional degrees of freedom (due to 6 numbers with 1 constraint). We could correlate this with
(o(θ1 , θ2 ), a(θ1 , θ2 ), b(θ1 , θ2 ), x(θ1 , θ2 ), y(θ1 , θ2 ), c(θ1 , θ2 ))
for a 2-dimensional parameterization (θ1 , θ2 ).
In
this way, there would be a correspondence between
5-dimensions and 2-dimensions, the validity of experimental fitness to our theoretical (θ1 , θ2 ) prediction
would be a strong evidence for the validity of our model.
However, current available experimental data we found is
just (Oexp ,Aexp ,Bexp ,ABexp ), which is 3-dimensional (4
numbers with 1 constraint) (ii, AA + Ai, BB + Bi, AB);
we would then correlate this to (o(θ1 , θ2 ), a(θ1 , θ2 ) +
x(θ1 , θ2 ), b(θ1 , θ2 ) + y(θ1 , θ2 ), c(θ1 , θ2 )) for certain 2dimensional parameters (θ1 , θ2 ).
The test for the
validity of this theory now becomes a correspondence
between 3-dimensions to 2-dimensions.
We fit the
3-dimensional experimental data into our 2-dimensional
equilibrium solutions. Although this is not as stringent
as the 5-dimensional to 2-dimensional correspondence,
there remains one degree of freedom for experimental
data to deviate from our equilibrium solution. If the
error bar for this 3-dimensional to 2-dimensional correspondence is tiny, then our theory shows consistency
to the level of predicting the stability of genotype
frequencies.
Our fitting procedure is to solve (θ1 , θ2 ) from two
equalities:

Aexp = a(θ1 , θ2 ) + x(θ1 , θ2 ),
(16)
Bexp = b(θ1 , θ2 ) + y(θ1 , θ2 ).

Then, with applicable (θe1 , θe2 ) as solutions of equalities,
we can further know o(θe1 , θe2 ) ≡ Ot and c(θe1 , θe2 ) ≡ABt .
Since Aexp =At and Bexp =Bt by Eq.(16), we could test
the differences and error bars of O and AB as follows:

Ot − Oexp ≡ Diff%(Ot − Oexp ),



 ABt − ABexp ≡ Diff%(ABt − ABexp ),
Ot −Oexp

As we mention the 2-dimensional equilibrium parameterization is an one-to-one mapping if we define that θ1 =
0, ∀θ2 shrinks into a point. Hence, we can introduce the
(θ1 cos(θ2 ), θ1 sin(θ2 )) polar coordinates mapped from the
Eq.(11) of the parameter (θ1 , θ2 ). In other words, we define that θ1 represents the radial direction(0 ≤ θ1 ≤ π2 ),
θ2 represents the angle direction(0 ≤ θ2 ≤ π2 ) for our

9
stable equilibrium solution diagram, show in FIG.5 as
our blood type mapping chart. This chart is a quadrant:
one fourth of a circle. Inside the quadrant consists of all
stable fixed points mapping from the 2-dimensional manifold Eq.(11). At three corners of the quadrant, there are
o≡O(ii), a≡A(AA), and b≡B(BB). For specifying their
Cartesian coordinates (o, a, b, x, y, c), each of these is
100% of that specified type - e.g. O(ii) = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
A(AA) = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0), B(BB) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0). Similarly, at the midpoints of the three edge sides, we have
X(Ai) = ( 12 , 14 , 0, 12 , 0, 0), Y(Bi) = ( 12 , 0, 14 , 0, 12 , 0), and
C(AB) = (0, 0, 0, 14 , 14 , 21 ). The blue line represents the
symmetric line invariant under switching a, x to b, y.
From Eq.(11), we could easily see the blue line is θ2 =
π
4 . The green curve represents the symmetry invariant
under switching a, c to o, y. This gives the green curve
parameterization:
p

p
θ1 (θ2 ) =

2 + 2 sin(2θ2 )
(18)
The red curve represents the symmetry invariant under
switching b, c to o, x. This gives the red curve parameterization:
p
( 3 − cos(2θ2 ) + 2 sin(2θ2 )(1 + cot(θ2 )))
p
θ1 (θ2 ) =

The intersection of three color lines, is ( 29 , 92 , 29 , 19 , 19 , 19 ),
which is the most symmetric mid point.

Explanation and application of the chart - relations of
different ethnic groups by geodesic distances

The experimental data that we implemented is mainly
from two data resources [13]. We fit the experimental
data [13] for both (1) different ethnic groups and (2)
different countries. We present the experimental data
(Oexp ,Aexp ,Bexp ,ABexp ) in Table.I, III, IV. We present
our corresponding theoretical prediction, the data
(Ot ,AAt , Ait ,BBt ,Bit ,ABi ) in Table.II, V, VI.

Type B.
(4) Diff% and Error% for islanders, like Irish and
Japanese, are smaller than races living in a larger continent, like Hindus. Thus, we can say that the closed
system assumption plays an important rule such that the
data of islanders are more close to the stable fixed-point
equilibrium solutions.
In our plots (see Figures in Sec.VIII), θ1 represents the
radial direction (0 ≤ θ1 ≤ π2 ), θ2 represents the angle direction (0 ≤ θ2 ≤ π2 ). We invent the chart to organize
the data - for the blood type model, we have a quadrant spanned by θ1 and θ2 with the horizontal and vertical coordinates as (θ1 cos(θ2 ), θ1 sin(θ2 )). We propose
the distribution of different ethnic groups (marked with
numbers) in our plots would reveal their relative distance
correlations. More precisely, to quantitatively define
the distance between two ethnic groups, we propose a mathematical method to achieve this by
solving the geodesic equation numerically from the
given metric of stable-solution manifold.
For the model of 2 alleles studied here in Sec.III A, we
can write down the intrinsic metric of 1-dimensional equilibrium manifold Eq.(3). This can be done by considering
the infinitesimal distance ds in the genotype frequency
space by transforming the Euclidean (H, h, x) space to
the curved space (θ1 ):

For example, for the model of 3 alleles studied in
Sec.III B, we can write down the intrinsic metric of 2dimensional equilibrium manifold Eq.(11). This can be
done by considering the infinitesimal distance ds in the
genotype frequency space by transforming the Euclidean
(o, a, b, x, y, c) space to the curved space (θ1 , θ2 ):
ds2 = do2 + da2 + db2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dc2
≡ gθ1 ,θ1 dθ1 2 + 2gθ1 ,θ2 dθ1 dθ2 + gθ2 ,θ2 dθ2 2 = gµν dθµ dθν , (21)

)dθ2 , etc.
in terms of (θ1 , θ2 ), e.g. do = ( ∂θ

We propose that:

Data fitting for ethnic groups is much promising, because random mating assumption is approximately true
for a certain given ethnic group. On the other hand, a
country may possess multi-ethnicities where the random
mating assumption generally fails for the country with
multi-ethnic groups.

The genetic distance between two ethnic
groups with stabilized genotype frequencies can
be defined as the geodesic length by solving
the geodesic equation on the stable equilibrium
manifold.

We also investigate the data distribution of different
ethnic groups and countries under our (θ1 , θ2 ) domain
space. We found some facts:
(1) American aboriginals possess large portion of Type
O.
(2) Europeans or Caucasians possess much more Type A
than others.
(3) Mongolians, like Buryats, possess comparably more

On one hand, we could further define this least distance
as the “genetic distance” between any pair of two ethnic
groups. On the other hand, by comparing the geographical distribution of ethnic groups and the distribution of
ethnic groups on our equilibrium-solution chart, we find
their strong correlation and certain meaningful pattern.
The details of the data of geodesic distance shall be left
for the future.

TABLE I. ETHNIC GROUP.1 This table shows available experimental data of blood type ratios of O,A,B, and AB (denoted
with a sub-indices “exp.”) for 55 different ethnics (ethnic groups) around the world [13]. The index of certain ethnic corresponds
to the specified number of a data point distributed on the plots of FIG 6, FIG 7, FIG 14 and FIG 15. We fit blood type population
percentage of avalable experimental results to the 2 parameter spaces θ1 and θ2 of our equilibrium solution. The error bar is
comparably small. The FIG 6, 7, 14 and 15 (the mappings of equilibrium solutions) may be a good way of data organization
for revealing the relations of different ethnic groups.

TABLE II. ETHNIC GROUP.2 This table continues from the previous TABLE I. This TABLE II shows our theoretical
prediction corresponding to the experimental data of TABLE I. The experiment data fitting procedure is that we use two
constraints type A (AA and Ai) and type B (BB and Bi), comparing these with 2-dimensional equilibrium solution, and
finding out total 6 different blood types by our theoretical stable fixed-point prediction. In this table, we compute the
error bar of O and AB. In addition, we compute our theoretical prediction on the population ratio of AA and Ai, BB and Bi.
For the usual blood type test, these data may not be easily determined. However, we compile our theoretical prediction data
here which may be testable data for future experiments.

TABLE IV. COUNTRY.1-2. This table shows available experimental data of blood type ratios for another 52 different
countries around the world, where totally 114 different countries’ data are available [13], continued from TABLE III. Be aware
that each country may consist of many different ethnic groups, so these fittings are some approximate examples. For a country
with multi-ethnicities such as USA, the theoretical prediction does not work as well as a country with a pure ethnic group.

We can generalize our model and theory of Sec.III to
n + 1 alleles. Alternatively, one may say n dominant alleles and 1 recessive allele in a single locus. For dominant
gene with a label α, we denote it as Dα ; and for the only
recessive gene we denote as r. We denote biological traits
of Dα Dα as Gαα , Dα Dβ as Gαβ (≡ Gβα ) for α 6= β, Dα r
as Gα0 (≡ G0α ), rr as G00 (≡ G00 ). Indeed, whether the
genotypes we studied have dominant or recessive alleles
do not matter, we can simply label them as Gαβ generically. We derive the governing equations for population
parameters as:

We are confident to anticipate that the linear stability
analysis
 of the system would give n eigenvalues 0, and
n+1
b αα +G
b ββ −2G
b αβ ≡
eigenvalues −1 [14]. Note that G
2
sbαβ (while symmetrically we define sij ≡ sji ) would be
the eigenvectors corresponding to −1 eigenvalues. We

can parameterize the whole space of Gij (n + 1 + n+1
2 dimensions with one constraint) by a new set of n+ n+1
2

e ij from
where θei and seαβ can be solved in the form of G
Eq.(26). The key to obtain our exact analytic
solution is to transform the nonlinear coupled
Eq.(23) to the decoupled linear Eq.(27).
The dimensionality: We explain again the physical
meaning on the dimensionality of the fibers and the
stable base manifold, shown in Fig.1. For Eq.(23), there
is a permutation symmetric group Sn+1 symmetry by
permuting Gαβ . The Sn+1 symmetry also results in
time-independent n + 1 conserved quantities, spanned
n
P
2Gk−1,j ) with k = 1, . . . , n + 1.
by (2Gk−1,k−1 +
j=0
j6=k−1

P
Since there is a 1-dimensional constraint
Gjk = 1,
overall there is n independent degrees of freedom. We
can say the Sn+1 symmetry results in the dimensionality
of fixed-point solutions is n, here parametrized by
θ1 , . . . , θn . The stable equilibrium
base manifold is

n-dimensional, the fibers are n+1
-dimensional.

The geodesic distance as the genetic distance:
Again, as stated in Sec.III B 3. we can solve the geodesic
distance of of two populations on the manifold Eq.(24)
in the genotype frequency space to define the genetic distance of two populations. Note that the intrinsic metric
gθµ ,θν can be derived from
X

1-1 mapping and the well-defined manifold

Recall that in Sec.III B, we are aware that in order to
have an one-to-one (denoted as 1-1) mapping, we have
to specify the valid domain of (θ1 , θ2 ). From Eq.(11),
(θ1 = 0, ∀ θ2 ) would map to o = 1 case, this is many-toone mapping. Topologically we could shrink (θ1 = 0, ∀
θ2 ) as a point to make it a well-defined 1-1 mapping 2dimensional manifold. Similarly, we should perform an
analogous operation on the general case of Eq.(24):

θ1 = 0, ∀(θ2 , θ3 , . . . , θn ) shrink into a point.

θ1 6= 0, θ2 6= 0, . . . , θn−2 6= 0, θn−1 = 0, ∀θn shrink into a
(31)
For the same reason, the inverse functions Eq.(13) and
Eq.(26) are not one-to-one defined at those few points.
Nonetheless, we could follow the rule of Eq.(31) to make
them one-to-one well-defined.
C. Equilibrium solutions as a global attractor,
monotonic behavior, non-extinction and the
Hardy-Weinberg Law

Now we can prove several fundamental common
properties of macroscopic gene-mating dynamical evolutionary systems. Our proofs are straightforward since we
have the time-evolutionary analytic solution in Eq.(28).
(1) The global stability of the system: as the time approaches infinity (approximately), the LHS parameters
of Eq.(28) will evolve to an equilibrium solution through
n
P
a 1-dimensional line direction
sαβ sbαβ .
0≤α<β≤n

(2) Monotonic: Time-evolution of parameters in
Eq.(28) is also monotonic through the exponential decay
along the ŝαβ direction to the corresponding equilibrium
fixed-point on the stable manifold Eq.(24).
(3) Non-extinction and the Hardy-Weinberg law:
Based on our model, here we further claim that our following non-extinction statement shows a proof of the
Hardy-Weinberg law [11, 12] for a gene-mating system.
Our non-extinction statement states that any genotype
or an allele that ever appears in the population will never
become extinct. The Hardy-Weinberg law states that in
the absence of other evolutionary influences, the population genetics will obtain an equilibrium.
We prove that our model not only have the stable fixed
points as a continuous manifold in Eq.(24), but also verify
a stronger claim from a dynamical viewpoint — if there
ever exists a certain genotype, no matter how tiny a portion it is in the total population, it will never become
extinct under time-evolution. Here is our proof. The
extinction evolution approaches zeros for certain genotypes. Zeros are a final state, which must be located at
some equilibrium point. This is easy to verify by moving
an equilibrium point (those points with a certain genotype percentage equal to zero) away from the equilibrium
manifold through the time-reversal evolution direction
(the line direction of Eq.(25)). We find that it is impossible because there must be another genotype going to
a value less than 0, but the population percentage cannot be smaller than 0 at any moment. The contradiction
shows time-evolution never brings genotype frequencies
to approach extinction points. We have proven the nonextinction statement and the Hardy-Weinberg law for the
genotype frequency.
We can prove the non-extinction for the allele frequency from the fact that the time-evolution direction in
the genotype frequency space always conserves the allele
point.
b αα + G
b ββ −
frequency. Namely, in Eq.(25), along the (G
b
2Gαβ ) ≡ sbαβ direction on the fiber, the allele frequency
is conserved independently of time. We have thus proven
the non-extinction statement for both genotype frequencies and allele frequencies.
Based on these three proven facts above, we know the
global properties of genotype frequency space of the evolutionary system; and we also know the topological properties of genotype frequency space from the fiber bundle
picture, shown in Fig.1.

V.

MUTATION AND NATURAL SELECTION

Let us consider a more generic model beyond Eq.(22)
and Eq.(23) to include the process of mutation and natural selection.
Mutation, for example, corresponds to enlarging the
parameter space through adding a new gene type (genotypes or alleles). Natural selection, for example, corre-

ponds to perturbe the birth rate, the death rate, and the
inherited factor of our governing equations. The population governing equations with various independent birth
rates kbij and various death rates kdij can be:

birth rates or death rates. The original continuous manifold of stable equilibrium solutions Eq.(24) will reduce to
discrete points once we tune any birth or death rate. This
shows that the symmetry breaking of governing equations
results in the discrete degeneracy of stable solutions.
The discrete degenerated stable solution will become
the sink, source, or saddle point of the phase diagram
(rather than just an attractor of stable fixed-points, as
in the previous case in Sec.IV). These bring up more interesting and complicated phenomena, especially for the
case with more genes with a larger parameter space.

CONCLUSION

We have proposed a set of time-dependent coupled
nonlinear differential equations as the governing equations to describe a class of gene-mating dynamical
evolutionary systems within the disciplines of population
genetics and evolutionary biology. Our model consists
of the set of governing equations derived from the fundamental assumptions in Sec.II. The specific models for
2 alleles and 3 alleles (blood type) evolutionary systems
are derived in Sec.III, and the more generic systems

with arbitrary (n + 1)-alleles with ((n + 1) + (n+1)
)2
genotypes are studied in Sec.IV. We find the exact
analytic solutions for our models, where the solutions
show their most generic forms in Sec.IV.
Based on the exact analytic solutions, we have proved
the common properties of gene-mating evolutionary
systems: (1) global stability, (2) monotonic evolution,
and (3) non-extinction and the Hardy-Weinberg law,
under the assumption of no mutation and no natural
selection.
More generally, our model in Sec.IV describes the
phenomena of the many-body reaction or the many-body
collision process. In our work, we interpret the governing
equations (23) as the population evolution within a
given gene pool. It may be possible that one can also
extend Eq.(23) as certain chemical compounds reactions
in the chemical reaction pools — such as reactions
involving enzymes. Another possible interpretation is to
regard Eq.(23) as a discretized variant of the Boltzmann
equations. Further extensions of our work will be
reported elsewhere.
After the completion of our work, by searching for
similar studies in the literature, we became aware of a
closely relevant model studied in a pioneer work Ref.[10]
where they obtain the exact solutions in a different
parameterization. There is also a theoretical proof
in [15] of a generalized model of Ref.[10], where the
birth rates (fertilities) and the death rates of different
genotypes need not to be the same.
There is another study in Ref.[16] concerning the

19
blood groups (blood type) and their Hardy-Weinberg
law, nonetheless their perspective is rather different from
ours. Ref.[16]’s model is parameterized by phenotype
(instead of our genotype) and its model is discrete model
(instead of our continuous model).

The new ingredients for our study are the emphasis on
stable fixed-point manifold. We believe that our findings
of (1) a unified parameterization of the stable manifold
together with the time-dependent evolution and (2) the
Euclidean fiber bundle description of exact analytic solutions are new to the literature. We hope that our work
can contribute to the population genetics and mathematical biology study.

This is the first paper for a sequence of three related
studies. The second [17] and the third paper [18] will be
reported elsewhere.
