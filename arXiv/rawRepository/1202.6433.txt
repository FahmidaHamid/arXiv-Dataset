We give a new explanation for why some biological systems can stay quantum coherent for long
timeS at room temperatures, one of the fundamental puzzles of quantum biology. We show that
systems with the right level of complexity between chaos and regularity can increase their coherence
time BY orders of magnitude. Systems near Critical Quantum Chaos or Metal-Insulator Transition
(MIT) can have long coherence times and coherent transport at the same time. The new theory
tested in a realistic light harvesting system model can reproduce the scaling of critical fluctuations
reported in recent experiments. Scaling of return probability in the FMO light harvesting complex
shows the signs of universal return probability decay observed at critical MIT. The results may
open up new possibilities to design low loss energy and information transport systems in this Poised
Realm hovering reversibly between quantum coherence and classicality.

Discovery of room temperature quantum coherence in
the avian compass[1] of birds, in the olfactory receptors[2]
and in light harvesting complexes[3‚Äì6] in the last few
years indicate that quantum effects might be ubiquitous
in biological systems. While the quantum chemical understanding of the details of light harvesting systems is
almost complete, no organizing principle has been found
which could explain why quantum coherence is maintained in these systems for much longer than the characteristic decoherence time imposed by their room temperature environment. Here we propose that at the critical edge of quantum chaos coherence and transport can
coexist for several orders of magnitudes longer than in
simple quantum systems. Quantum systems changing
from integrable to quantum chaotic pass through critical quantum chaos[7‚Äì10] which is also a metal-insulator
transition from Anderson localization to extended wave
functions. By extending the semiclassical theory of decoherence from chaotic[11‚Äì17] and integrable systems[18]
to the transition region we show that coherence decay
changes from exponential to power law behavior and coherence time is amplified exponentially from its environmentally determined value. We demonstrate our theory
on a ring of chromophores passing through the critical
point and show that coherence in the critical point decays with the same non-trivial power law as in the FMO
complex experiment[5]. Our results also suggest that loss
of coherence is not permanent in these systems and they
can re-cohere via coherent external driving such as the
arrival of photons in case of the light harvesting systems
and can continuously hover in the ‚ÄùPoised Realm‚Äù[19]
between the coherent quantum and the incoherent classical worlds. Using this new critical design principle from
biology might open the way to build lossless quantum
coherent energy and information processing devices op-

erating at room temperature.

FIG. 1. Purity decay of the chromophore ring with 1D Harper
hamiltonian. Below the metal-insulator transition W < Wc =
2 curves can be fitted with exponentials P (t) = exp(‚àít/œÑc ).
In the parameter range W = 0.1 ‚àí 1.9 the fitted coherence
time changes in the range œÑc = 182 ‚àí 248. In and above
the transition W ‚â• Wc the curves can be fitted with P (t) =
(œÑŒ± /(œÑŒ± + t))Œ± . In the parameter range W = 2.0 ‚àí 4.0 the
exponent changes in the range Œ± = 2.01‚àí0.479 and œÑŒ± = 451‚àí
1651. The estimate for the decoherence time P (œÑc ) = 1/e =
37% above the transition is œÑc = œÑŒ± (e1/Œ± ‚àí 1) = 266 ‚àí 16051.

Quantum biology is dealing with open quantum systems closely coupled to their many degrees of freedom
environment. The environment exerts time dependent
forces on the system through the coupling. Some of these
forces change very rapidly compared to the excitation fre-

2
quencies of the system and look random from its point
of view. This ‚Äùheat bath‚Äù destroys quantum coherence
and moves the system into a mixed state rapidly. The
average effect of the random forces can be described as
a non-unitary time evolution of the system‚Äôs density matrix.
At room temperature the phonon environment has
characteristic energy ET = kB T ‚âà 4 ¬∑ 10‚àí21 J and frequency ŒΩT = kB T /h ‚âà 6T Hz in the infrared spectrum.
The typical phonon thermal wavelength is determined
by the speed of sound of the material the system is embedded in. Its typical value for water and non-specific
proteins is c = 1500m/s yielding ŒªT = c/ŒΩ ‚àº 2.5AÃä.
Molecules within a thermal wavelength distance can feel
the same environment and some of their states can be almost decoherence free[20] and can preserve coherence for
long time. In light harvesting systems the light absorbing
and emitting chromophores are embedded in a protein
scaffold which can suppress thermal fluctuations more
effectively. The thermal wavelength can be increased to
10 ‚àí 13AÃä by raising the effective speed of sound [21] with
a factor of 3-5 to 7 ‚àí 8000m/s. Protective environments
cannot extend the size of coherent patches further and a
different mechanism is needed to extend it further, which
we propose next.

FIG. 2. Probability that the exciton stays on the chromophore
it started in represented by the density matrix element %1,1 .
Below the transition (W = 0.1) coherence dies out quickly
and the probability reaches its asymptotic value 1/25. The
peak at time ‚âà 13 is the result of the interference of waves
going clock and anti-clockwise along the the circle and meeting again after turning around the structure. The rest of the
structure comes from interference of waves scattering back
from other chromophores. In the transition point and above
coherent beats occur and the probability stays elevated for
a very long time (not shown here). These are beats due to
genuine quantum coherent superposition states .

The speed of environmental decoherence can be char-

acterized by the decay rate of the off diagonal (n 6= m)
elements of the reduced density matrix of the system
%nm ‚àº e‚àít/œÑc ,Pwhere œÑc is the coherence time. Purity
P = T r[%2 ] = mn |%nm |2 has been shown to be a good
overall measure. It is P = 1 when the system is in a pure
state and decreases monotonically as the system decoheres into a mixed state. P (t) ‚àº 1/N + const ¬∑ e‚àít/œÑc ,
where N is the number of quantum states of the system. The logarithm of the purity is the Renyi entropy
S2 = log T r[%2 ] of the system. The long time entropy
production rate of the system[12] and the rate of decoherence are then closely related dS2 /dt ‚àº 1/œÑc for
t ‚Üí ‚àû. Entropy production on the other hand is determined by the dynamical properties of the system. It has
been derived via semiclassical approximation and then
proven by direct simulations that the entropy production rate becomes environment independent and is determined by the classical dynamical Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy of the system[11‚Äì17]. It is in turn the sum of the
positive Lyapunov exponents Œª+
i characterizing the exponential divergence
of
chaotic
trajectories
in the system
P
dS2 /dt ‚àº hKS = i Œª+
i . This relation between coherence
decay and generalized Lyapunov exponents has been confirmed in strongly chaotic systems. Another implication
of this result is that the rate of decoherence vanishes in
systems where the Lyapunov exponent is zero. This has
also been confirmed in integrable systems. These are
completely solvable systems with fully predictable regular dynamics and zero Lyapunov exponents. Purity
shows power law decay typically like P (t) ‚àº 1/t2 and
asymptotic decoherence rate is zero dS2 /dt ‚àº 1/t ‚Üí 0.
Zero Lyapunov exponent and entropy production can
also emerge in systems at the border of the onset of global
chaos in the classical counterpart of the system. Suppose, we have a parameter  of the mechanical system
which characterizes its transition from regular dynamics to chaos[22, 23] H = HR + HC , where HR is the
Hamiltonian of a fully integrable system and HC is fully
chaotic. Classically HR is a solvable system and it can be
described by action-angle variables. It does only simple
oscillations in the angle variables while the action variables do not change and remain conserved restricting the
dynamics for the surface of a torus in the phase-space.
When  6= 0 but small the system is not integrable classically and the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory
describes the system[22, 23]. The chaotic perturbation
breaks up some of the regular tori in the phase-space and
chaotic diffusion emerges localized between unbroken, so
called KAM tori. Chaotic regions are localized in small
patches in the phase-space surrounded by regular boundaries represented by the KAM tori. At a given critical c
even the last KAM tori separating the system gets broken and the chaotic patches merge into a single extended
chaotic sea. In the transition region  ‚âà c the Lyapunov
exponent shows a second order phase transition[24] with
power law scaling Œª0 () ‚àº ( ‚àí c )Œ≤ slightly above  > c

where Cnm = hF (xn , t)F (xm , t)i is the correlation function of the environmental coupling. We assume that
the correlation function depends only on the periodic
distance of the chromophores in a simple way Cnm =
D(L/œÄ)2 cos2 (œÄ(n‚àím)/L) and is quadratic for small distances.
The transition described here is more general than just
the transition from regular to quantum chaotic behavior.
It is also a transition from the localized states of the regular system to the extended states of the chaotic system.
The two are separated by the metal-insulator transition
(MIT) point[7, 9] between quantum mechanical Anderson localization and globally delocalized metallic phase.
The transition point can be identified with the emergence
of the semi-Poissonian[9] level statistics. In the transition point the wave functions are neither fully localized
nor extended and have an intriguing multi-fractal spatial
character. The fractal structure allows them to develop a
hairy localized structure but also an extended structure

with long range overlap correlations.
Merging the pieces of classical, semiclassical and quantum aspects a new picture emerges. Systems well below
the critical point have non-chaotic dynamics with zero
generalized Lyapunov exponents and quantum localization lengths extending only for few states. Decoherence
in these systems is slow and purity follows a power law
decay P (t) ‚âà 1/tŒ± with some exponent Œ± making possible
the presence of anomalously long living coherent dynamics in the system. But coherently evolving states remain
localized and long distance quantum coherent transport
is not possible. Systems well above the critical point have
chaotic dynamics with positive Lyapunov exponents and
delocalized states extending for the entire system. Coherence dies out exponentially fast. Near the critical point
exponential decay of coherence crosses over to long living
power law behavior and localized states become delocalized. In finite systems there is always a narrow region
around criticality, where long living coherence and sufficiently extended states can exist at the same time.

the system is chaotic characterized by a positive largest
Lyapunov exponent Œª0 > 0.
On the quantum mechanical level we can follow the
transition in the statistical distribution of the energy levels. The Hamilton operator of the regular system HR is
a separable with diagonal matrix elements. The consecutive energy levels of the regular system look random
and follow a Poisson process. The nearest neighbor level
spacing distribution is then exponential p(s) = exp(‚àís),
where sn = (En+1 ‚àíEn )/‚àÜ(En ) is the level spacing measured in the units of local mean level spacing ‚àÜ(E) at
energy E. The Hamiltonian operator HC corresponding
to the fully chaotic system is best approximated by a random matrix. The energy level statistics of HC can be described by Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the level
spacings follow the Wigner level spacing distribution[25]
p(s) = (œÄs/2) exp(‚àíœÄs2 /4) in systems with time reversal symmetry. As the parameter  is increased from zero
the level spacing statistics changes from a Poissonian to
a Wigner distribution. Critical quantum chaos[10] sets
up at the critical value c in between. Below the critical
point p(0) is finite, at the critical point and above the
spacing distribution starts linearly p(s) = As for s ‚Üí 0,
a characteristic feature of chaotic systems with strongly
overlapping eigenfunctions. The tail of the distribution
remains exponential below the critical point exp(‚àíBs)
for s ‚Üí ‚àû which is a characteristics of regular systems
whose eigenfunctions do not overlap for larger energy separations. It turns to gaussian exp(‚àíCs2 ) then above the
critical point. At the critical point the level statistics is
semi-Poisson[10] p(s) = 4s exp(‚àí2s) which starts linearly
and decays exponentially combining the two main aspects
of the level statistics of regular and chaotic systems.

FIG. 3. Probability that the exciton started on chromophore
1 is on chromophore 13 %1,13 . Below the transition (W = 0.1)
coherence dies out quickly and the probability reaches its
asymptotic value 1/25. The beats at times 6.5 and at 19.5
reflect interference from clock and anti-clockwise traveling
waves interfering after taking half and 1.5 rounds. In the
transition point and above we can see that due to the localization it takes much longer time for the excitation to arrive
at the opposite end. If we are just slightly above the transition coherent beats smear out by the time they arrive. The
reason is that propagation becomes mostly classical as localization stops quantum diffusion. In the critical point however
quantum propagation and coherence is possible at the same
time.

We demonstrate this theory on a simplified model of
chromophores in light harvesting complexes and argue
that it is very likely that biological systems use this
mechanism to tune their parameters[26] near the criti-

simplicity we take a simple ring of L chromophores coupled by constant Vnm = 1 for neighboring sites n and
m and zero otherwise and take quasi random on site energies given by
‚àö En = W cos(2œÄœÉn), where the irrational
number œÉ = ( 5 ‚àí 1)/2 is the golden mean. This hamiltonian is known as the one dimensional Harper model. At
Wc = 2 the infinite system L ‚Üí ‚àû goes through a MIT
with delocalized states below and localized states above
criticality. At the critical point it has been shown to
have semi-Poisson level statistics[29]. The system is coupled
P to the phononic environment via the Hamiltonian
i F (xi , t)|iihi|, where F (x, t) is the randomly fluctuating phonon field including the chromophore site energy
coupling constant. The reduced density matrix of the
chromophore system can be described in Markovian approximation by the Lindblad equation[28]
Next we show results for L = 25 (in dimensionless units
~ = 1), which is a realistic number of chromophores in
experimentally investigated systems[27]. In Fig. 1 we
show purity of the system. Below the critical point purity decays exponentially. At and above the critical point
the curves can be fitted with power law exponents changing from Œ± ‚âà 2 at criticality towards zero as W increases
and the curves flatten out. In Fig. 2 we show the probability %1,1 to find the exciton on the chromophore in
which the exciton was initialized. Below criticality the
probability reaches its asymptotic value of 1/L = 0.04
quickly after decaying coherent oscillations. Above criticality the probability stays above the asymptotic value
for a long time indicating the presence of localization.
Quantum beats can be observed which also relax in a
very slow fashion. Based on the simulations we can establish the rule of localization assisted amplification of
coherence time. In the delocalized regime purity decays
exponentially determined by the timescale dictated by
the environment. In the localized regime we can define
an effective coherence time by looking at the point where
purity decays to 1/e of its original value P (œÑc ) = 1/e.
Above the critical point purity can be well approximated
by function P (t) = (œÑŒ± /(œÑŒ± + t))Œ± (see Fig. 1). The
effective length of coherence then can be approximated
as œÑc = œÑŒ± ¬∑ (e1/Œ± ‚àí 1). This function grows very fast
when Œ± ‚Üí 0 in the strongly localized limit. In our example this is a 60-fold increase between criticality and
W = 4. In Fig. 3 we show the probability %13,13 of finding the excitation at the opposite end of the ring. For
subcritical values the excitation arrives very quickly due
to delocalization and shows beats due to the interference
of excitons traveling clock and anti-clockwise. Coherent
beats die out quickly and we reach the asymptotic probability. For supra-critical values far from the critical point

FIG. 4. Power law decay of the population probability %1,1
for the chromophore model and for the real FMO complex.
The population decay for a modified version of our model
is shown (red) on log-log scale at the critical point W = 2,
where each site is fully correlated with its next neighbors and
not correlated with the rest of the chromophores. The same
quantity is shown for the FMO complex (green). Time scales
are in arbitrary units. Both curves oscillate around a trend
which decays with the same exponent of about ‚àí0.23. While
the geometry is different for FMO and the ring, both of them
seem to follow the same, perhaps universal, scale free trend
observed at the critical point of the MIT.

the probability to reach site 13 remains astonishingly low
due to the localization of the system. For values near at
and below criticality we get the most optimal results for
quantum coherent transport of excitations, when excitations can still reach the opposite end of the circle but can
preserve a degree of coherence as well.
At criticality not only purity changes from exponential to power law decay but so does the population of
the chromophores. In Fig. 4 we show the population
%1,1 (t) in a version of our model where three neighboring
chromophores along the circle are always fully correlated
Cnm = C while they become totally uncorrelated otherwise Cmm = C ‚Üí ‚àû. This model can describe the real
situation where neighboring chromophores are shielded
from the environment by their protein scaffolds and approximately three chromophores can be placed within
the protected thermal wavelength of 10-13AÃä . We can
see that the trend of the population follows a shallow
power law decay. We show also the experimental data
of Ref. 5 on the FMO light harvesting complex kindly
provided by the authors. Both curves follow a similar
scale free trend with approximately the same exponent
‚àí0.23. This exponent is very close to ‚àí0.25 which is the
power law decay exponent of the average return probability p(t) = hpn (t)in ‚àº t‚àí1/4 at the critical point of
MIT as it was shown in Ref.[30]. The return probability

5
pn (t) = h| œàn (t) |2 i is the probability of return assuming
that the wave function was localized on the site initially
œàn (0) = 1. In the decoherence free case it coincides with
the density matrix element %nn (t) assuming %nn (0) = 1,
which is shown in our model and for the FMO complex.
It seems likely that the FMO complex follows the universal scaling of critical MIT indicating that the hamiltonian
of the FMO complex is tuned to critical quantum chaos
in order to realize optimal coherent transport, what we
show elsewhere.
The findings support a new approach to quantum biological systems. They are not just under the influence of
environmental decoherence due to random noise but also
driven by the coherent waves of the incoming photons.
The photons are absorbed by one of the chromophores
which can be interpreted as a measurement process selecting one of the chromophores randomly. Then the system is set into an initial state which is concentrated on
the selected chromophore. The purity of the system becomes P = 1 as this is a pure state and the partially decoherent evolution starts again decreasing the purity in
time. The system can hover in the ‚ÄùPoised Realm‚Äù[19]
between clean quantum and incoherent classical worlds.
By tuning the timings of re-coherence events and the coherence time during decoherence via tuning the system
on the chaos-regularity axis can be kept in high level of
purity.
We hope that the mechanism discovered here makes it
possible to create new quantum devices working at room
temperature tuned to critical MIT capable of nearly frictionless quantum transport of energy and information.
