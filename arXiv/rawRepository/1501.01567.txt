Abstract
We use a large single particle tracking data set to analyze the short time and small
spatial scale motion of quantum dots labeling proteins in cell membranes. Our analysis
focuses on the jumps which are the changes in the position of the quantum dots between
frames in a movie of their motion. Previously we have shown that the directions of
the jumps are uniformly distributed and the jump lengths can be characterized by a
double power law distribution.
Here we show that the jumps over a small number of time steps can be described
by scalings of a single double power law distribution. This provides additional strong
evidence that the double power law provides an accurate description of the fine scale
motion. This more extensive analysis provides strong evidence that the double power
law is a novel stable distribution for the motion. This analysis provides strong evidence
that an earlier result that the motion can be modeled as diffusion in a space of fractional
dimension roughly 3/2 is correct. The form of the power law distribution quantifies
the excess of short jumps in the data and provides an accurate characterization of the
fine scale diffusion and, in fact, this distribution gives an accurate description of the
jump lengths up to a few hundred nanometers. Our results complement of the usual
mean squared displacement analysis used to study diffusion at larger scales where the
proteins are more likely to strongly interact with larger membrane structures.

Introduction

Our goal is to better understand the fine scale motion of proteins in cell membranes. We
do this by studying a large single particle tracking data set for the IgE high affinity receptor F cǫRI tagged with quantum dots (QDs) [10, 27] which were taken from movies of
the positions of the QDs. Standard time series analysis requires the analysis of the jumps
which are the changes in the positions of the QDs between frames in the movie as was done
in [10, 27]. The components of the jumps in a Brownian random walk in two dimensions are
normally distributed if and only if the directions of the jumps are uniformly distributed and
the lengths of the jumps have a chi, or equivalently, Weibull distribution. A main result of
the previous studies is that the directions of the jumps are uniformly distributed, just as in
Brownian motion, but the jump lengths do not have a chi distribution. Instead the studies
provide evidence that the jumps can be described using a double power law distribution. It
was also shown in [10], that a double power law fits the jump data better than general chi
or general Weibull distributions. Our power law distribution has two power law behaviors,
most importantly one for small jumps and another less important power law behavior for
large jumps.
Here we study the jumps over a few time steps, not just one time step, and provide
much stronger evidence that the previous descriptions of the motion are accurate. It came
as a surprise to us that the double power laws for multiple time steps are related to the one
time step power law by a square root of time scaling law, just as in Brownian motion. This
allows us to characterize the diffusion on short time and small spatial scales using a single
double power law probability distribution function with scaling and is the key to providing
stronger evidence for the previous characterization of the motion. Actually the double power
law is surprisingly accurate for moderate spatial and temporal scales, does not have a heavy
tail [8, 17] and, in fact, has many finite moments.
An important point is that the measured motion of the quantum dots has several components one of which is the actual motion of the protein. These include movement of the
dot while the image is being taken, noise in the imaging equipment, and the super resolution imaging process. These errors have been studied extensively in the context of MSD
analysis, see e.g. [4, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 24]. However, it is reasonable to assume that all
these random processes are independent, and all but the underlying motion of the protein
are normally distributed. If the underlying motion of the protein was normally distributed,
then the measured motion would also be normally distributed, but it is not. The most likely
and cause of the double power law behavior is the motion of the proteins.
This work has important implications for modeling protein motion. The Central Limit
Theorem implies that if we could model our data as an random walk in a homogeneous
medium that has independent and identically distributed (IID) jumps with double power
law distributed jump lengths, then the components of the jumps over many time steps
should approach a normal distribution, or equivalently, the jump angles must be uniformly
distributed and the jump lengths must have a chi distribution. We can view our data as
sampling the motion after the protein has made many smaller time steps. If the motion
4

could be described as an IID random walk then jump lengths must have a chi distribution,
which they do not have. We view this to mean that the diffusion of proteins in the cell
membrane is a complex process that cannot be accurately modeled using an IID random
walk in a homogeneous medium. We note that previous work [10] supports the assumption
that the jumps are independent. Collaborators have recently made simulations of random
walks in non-homogeneous mediums that have statistics similar to our data [7].
To understand why we view the motion as diffusion in a space of dimension 3/2, one
needs to know that in dimension n, IID random walks where the components of the motion
are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σ, the motion can also
be characterized as uniform on the unit sphere and radially by the chi distribution with n
degrees of freedom and scale factor s, c(r, s, n) = c(r/s, n)/s where [10]
c(r, n) =

n−1 − r2
r

,
2n/2 Γ(n/2)

(1.1)

r ≥ 0, n s2 = σ 2 > 0 and n ≥ 1. In two dimensions this is known as the chi or Weibull
distribution while in dimension three it is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. For small r,
this distribution has the from
c(r, n) ≈ C r n−1 ,
where C is a constant. Consequently, for the fine scale motion, if a probability distribution
function for the lengths of jumps has the form
p(r) ≈ C r d−1 ,
for small r and where C is a constant, then we say that the motion can be modeled as being
in a space of dimension d. For our data, d ≈ 3/2. This is a quantitative measure of the
restrictions on the motion of the protein on small spatial and temporal scales.
Our results complement those obtained by mean squared displacement analysis which
involves using data from more time steps than used here and consequently are appropriate
to temporal and spatial scales where the proteins may have strong interactions with other
membrane structures [1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 20, 22, 26].
The biology and microscopy involved in creating the data are described in detail in [2, 3],
so we will not repeat this here. We will use the same notation as in [10], which we now
summarize.

Random Variables

We model the QDs positions using vector valued random variables:
~ n = (Xn , Yn ) ,
P

1≤n≤N,

N > 0,

where Xn and Yn are real valued random variables and N and n are integers. The jumps
are also random variables:
~Jn = P

In polar coordinates, the lengths of the jumps Ln and the angles Θn between the jump
vectors and the x-axis are also real valued random variables:
q
~
Ln = kJn k = ∆X2n + ∆Y 2n , Θn = arctan(∆Y n , ∆Xn ) , 2 ≤ n ≤ N ,
where arctan gives a value in (−π, π] such that if Ln 6= 0, then cos(Θn ) = ∆Xn /Ln and
sin(Θn ) = ∆Y n /Ln , and consequently, tan(Θn ) = ∆Y n /∆Xn if ∆Xn 6= 0. If ~J = (0, 0),
then Θ = 0 (in matlab).

1.2

Tracking Data

The analyzed data were taken from unstimulated cells where a subset of the FcǫRI on the
cell membrane were labeled with QDs. We studied two large data sets called A and B. We
analyzed each data set individually as it is useful to see the differences between the two sets
but for our new results we combine the data sets to obtain better accuracy. The data contain

Figure 2.2: The PDFs for data sets A and B
Our first step in analyzing the data is to plot the cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) and probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the jump lengths which are shown
in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. The CDF is computed by first sorting the lengths into increasing
size. Assuming that there are I > 0 lengths ri , 1 ≤ i ≤ I then increasing size means that
ri ≤ ri+1 , 1 ≤ i ≤ I − 1. The CDFs shown in Figure 2.1 are determined by the pairs (ri , i/I).
This method of determining the CDFs is helpful as it makes use of all of the data without
any averaging like that which occurs when binning the data. Next we find the PDFs shown
in Figure 2.2 by the standard method of binning the data using 200 bins, thus averaging over
about 1/2% of the data for each value of the PDF. These plots use all of the valid jumps
7

in each of the data sets and n is the number of time steps determining the jumps. Observe
that as the number of time steps increase, the height of the PDFs decreases while the width
increases, suggesting that the PDFs are related by a scaling. As can be seen in Figure 2.2
and noted in [10], for the single time step jumps (n = 1), the data for r > 346nm have
significant errors and consequently are not used in our analysis. As we are most interested
in short jumps, this does not cause a problem.

We tried scaling the data for 1, 2 and 3 time step jumps by 1 = 1, 2 and 3 which
is done by dividing the jumps by the scale factor. The results of the scaling are shown in
Figures 2.3 and 2.4. It is a surprise that the scaled CDFs and PDFs are so similar and the
scaling property is the same as for Brownian motion. Thus, even though the components of
the jumps are not normally distributed, the angles of the jumps can be modeled as uniformly
distributed
and the jump lengths can be modeled by a single PDF or CDF that is scaled by
√
t. We now turn to quantifying this idea.
Because of the errors in the single time step jumps for for r > 346nm we only analyze the
scaled data for r ≤ 346nm which corresponds to the unscaled jumps satisfying r ≤ 346nm
when n = 1, r ≤ 489nm when n = 2 and r ≤ 599nm when n = 3. However, we plot
our results for scaled data satisfying r ≤ 500nm which scales to r ≤ 500nm when n = 1,
r ≤ 707nm when n = 2 and r ≤ 866nm when n = 3 to emphasize that are results are quite
good even for large jumps

Fitting the Data

We begin by describing the double power law distribution and it’s scaling law. We then
show how to generate random numbers having the double power law probability distribution
function and finish by using the double power law to fit the jump data.

3.1

The double power law distribution

In order for the parameters to have a more intuitive meaning we will change the notation
from that in [10]. The functional form is chosen in a way that the PDF p(r) is a power law
for both small and large r, which is substantially more restrictive than having only one of
these conditions hold. Additionally, we required that the PDF has a simple CDF so that it
is easy to simulate random numbers with the given PDF. The result is our double power law.
For small r ≥ 0, we require
p(r) ≈ C1 r α−1 ,

α ≥ 1,

because then α corresponds to the dimension of the space (see (1.1)) in which the diffusion
is occurring. For large r we want the PDF to decay rapidly, so we choose
p(r) ≈

C2
,
rβ

β > 1.

The condition on β guarantees that the PDF has a finite integral. We find a good choice for
the PDF p and corresponding CDF P is
P (r) = 1 −

1
,
α
(1 + r )(β−1)/α

p(r) =

(β − 1) r α−1
,
(1 + r α )(α−1+β)/α

r ≥ 0.

Also, to make the values of the parameters easy to interpret, we need to find a scale
factor S so that the second moment of the scaled power law will be one. The first and
second moments of any distribution p are:
Z ∞
Z ∞
m1 =
r p(r) dr , m2 =
r 2 p(r) dr .

As is well known, if r is a uniformly distributed random number in [0, 1], then solving
P (r) = u will produce random number with the given CDF P and associated PDF p.
Therefore, we can generate random number with the pl distribution by solving
P L(r) = u

Figure 3.2: Plots of the fits of both the PDF and CDF of the data. The vertical red line
indicates the cut off used for fitting the data.
We now use least-squares data fitting to find a double exponential power law that fits
the jump data, that is, we must estimate the parameters α and β and the scale parameter
s. To obtain maximal accuracy for the parameters, we combine all the scaled jumps sizes
from data sets A and B and scaled jumps sizes for 1, 2 and 3 time steps. As noted above,
and can be seen in Figure 3.2b, the data for r > 346nm have significant errors, so we only
fit jumps for r ≤ 346nm which gives 1,971,537 values that can be used for the fits, which are
excellent for r ≤ 346nm.
12

In fact, we fit both the PDF and CDF independently to obtain
αCDF ,
αPDF ,

βCDF ,
βPDF ,

sCDF ,
sPDF .

But the parameters of the fit of the PDF can be used in the fit to the CDF and conversely.
As is common with fitting problems, the solution is not unique, as shown in Table 3.1, but
the graphs of the fits are essentially the same. We consider the fit with β ≈ 40 the simplest
and thus the better fit. We plot both of these fits in Figure 3.2. We are most interested in
the parameter α which describes the short jumps and is unique. Also, the square root of
the second moment of all of the scaled jumps is 143.85nm and indeed the scale factors, as
expected, are close to this this value.

Results and Discussion

We have shown that the small spatial and short time motion of QDs labeling proteins on
the cell membrane can be characterized by a single double power law and square root of
time scaling. In fact, this distribution is a good fit for all of the scaled jumps under 340nm.
This power law quantifies the idea that this motion has substantially more short jumps than
if the motion was a Brownian random walk. Another way to say this is that the motion
can be viewed as diffusion in a space of dimension 3/2, which also quantifies the small scale
restrictions of the motion. We note that this notion of diffusion seems not to be closely
related to diffusion on fractals [19] where the MSD was used to characterize the motion.
On the other hand, the fact that the jumps over a few time steps are all described by one
probability distribution and a scale factor suggests that this distribution is stable [17] and
thus captures important properties of the motion.
To accuratly study the interaction of molecules on a cell membrane one can use a stochastic simulator where the time step is chosen so the the proteins typically move only a few
nanometers. Our results can be extend to provide the probabilty that two proteins will
interact in time intervals where the proteins move a few hundred nanometers, providing a
tool for significantly reducing the simulation cost.
We note that the Central Limit Theorem puts a strong restrictions on modeling the
motion. To confirm this, we used our double power law random number generator combined
with uniformly generated angles to simulate random walks. For a 100 walkers going 10 time
steps, the distribution of the distance moved over the 10 steps is now normally distributed as
predicted by the Central Limit Theorem. This implies that the motion cannot be accurately
modeled as a IID random walk in a homogeneous medium.
Researchers associated with the New Mexico Center for the Spatiotemporal Modeling
of Cell Signaling have created models of the cell membrane that include models of actin
filament barriers and lipid rafts where the jump data has properties similar to the jump data
analyzed here. It is hoped that these models will provide a connection between the statistics
of the membrane structure and the resulting PDF of the jump sizes.
Our results complement recent results on the analysis of the motion of proteins on longer
time scales using mean squared displacement ideas. For example: [4] uses k-space image
correlation spectroscopy analysis to study single molecule density data of lipids and proteins labeled with quantum dots; [18] uses variational Bayesian treatment of hidden Markov
models to analyze many short tracks identifying several diffusion states; [14] uses nonergodic motion, fractal structures, and multifractional random motion to study the motion of
proteins; [15] uses Basian statistics to better quantify noise from sampling limitations and
biological heterogeneity; [25] shows that both ergodic and a nonergodic process exist in the
plasma membrane and that the ergodic process resembles a fractal structure originating in
the macromolecular crowding in the cell membrane; [9] uses hidden Markov models are used
to identify multiple states of diffusion within experimental trajectories.

In this section we show how well the computed PDF power laws fit the unscaled data for 1,
2 and 3 jumps and data sets A and B. Again we see that the fits are excellent, but now the
noise in the data is more apparent.
