Abstract
We present a simple model to study Lévy-flight foraging in a finite landscape
with countable targets. In our approach, foraging is a step-based exploratory random search process with a power-law step-size distribution P (l) ∝ l−µ . We find
that, when the termination is regulated by a finite number of steps N , the optimum value of µ that maximises the foraging efficiency can vary substantially in
the interval µ ∈ (1, 3), depending on the landscape features (landscape size and
number of targets). We further demonstrate that subjective returning can be another significant factor that affects the foraging efficiency in such context. Our
results suggest that Lévy-flight foraging may arise through an interaction between
the environmental context and the termination of exploitation, and particularly
that the number of steps can play an important role in this scenario which is overlooked by most previous work. Our study not only provides a new perspective on
Lévy-flight foraging, but also opens new avenues for investigating the interaction
between foraging dynamics and environment as well as offers a realistic framework
for analysing animal movement patterns from empirical data.

Introduction

Understanding animal movement is crucial for understanding ecological and evolutionary
processes in nature and has a wide range of applications such as ecosystem management,
species conservation and disease control [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
In the last decade it has been widely observed that the movements of many animal
species, from albatrosses [6, 7] to spider monkeys [8], honey bees [9] to deer [10], and
marine predators [11] to human foragers [12, 13], appear to exhibit Lévy-flight patterns,
i.e. the step-size distribution can be approximated by a power-law P (l) ∝ l−µ with
1 < µ ≤ 3. Despite this apparent similarity, there is an ongoing debate in the scientific
community over the existence of Lévy-flights in animal movement and the methodology
of verifying Lévy-flights from empirical data [15, 16, 17]. In the meanwhile, scientists,
especially theorists, are keen on a question from a theoretical perspective: if the existence
of Lévy-flight in animal movement is true, why do animals perform Lévy-flight? This
question fascinates researchers from various disciplines from ecology to physics [18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23].
One common approach to the origin of animal movement patterns is to use the scheme
of optimizing random search [24, 25, 26]. In a random search model, single or multiple
individuals search a landscape to locate targets whose locations are not known a priori,
which is usually adopted to describe the scenario of animals foraging for food, prey
or resources. The locomotion of the individual has a certain degree of freedom which
is characterised by a specific search strategy such as a type of random walk, and is
also subject to other external or internal constraints, such as the environmental context
of the landscape or the physical and psychological conditions of the individual. It is
assumed that a strategy that optimises the search efficiency can evolve in response to
these constraints, and the movement is a consequence of the optimisation on random
search.
A seminal work by Viswanathan et al. [27] first studied Lévy-flight foraging through
the scheme of optimizing random search. In their model, a forager searches for targets
using a random walk with the aforementioned power-law step-size distribution. The
forager will keep moving until a target is ’encountered’, i.e. a target lies within its limited perception range . The search efficiency is defined as the encounter rate of targets,
namely the number of visited targets per unit moving distance. The model considers
2

two scenarios: (i) non-destructive foraging, in which the targets are revisitable, and (ii)
destructive foraging, in which the targets are depleted once visited. For non-destructive
foraging, when the targets are sparsely distributed, there exists an optimum exponent
µopt ≈ 2 that maximises the search efficiency, corresponding to the Lévy-flight strategy.
For destructive foraging, µopt → 1, corresponding to the ballistic motion, is the optimum solution. It is worth noting that this model only captures an idealised scenario in
which learning and prey-predator relationships are ignored [27], and other random search
strategies such as intermittent random search can outperform the Lévy-flight strategy in
some scenario [28].
Recent studies also turn attention to the substantial difference of the value of µopt
observed in empirical data. In fact the value of µopt among different species can range
from µopt ≈ 1.59 for human beings [29] to µopt ≈ 2.4 for bigeye tuna [11]. µopt can also
varies significantly among individuals within the same species, e.g. the value of µopt can go
from 1.18 to 2.9 in jellyfish [30]. It has been shown that intermediate values of the optimal
exponent 1 < µopt ≤ 2 can emerge in the crossover regime between non-destructive and
destructive foraging in which targets are regenerated after a period τ once depleted [31],
or arise in response to the landscape heterogeneity [32]. A recent study by Palyulin et al.
[33] shows that, in the case of searching for a single target in a infinite one-dimensional
space, when an external drift (underwater current, atmospheric wind and etc.) is present,
µopt can also vary in the interval 2 ≤ µopt ≤ 3.
In this paper, we propose a simple model to study Lévy flight foraging in a finite twodimensional landscape with countable targets. In our model, we consider foraging to be
a step-based exploratory search process for distinct targets subject to termination. The
forager can revisit the targets and the foraging efficiency is defined as the total number
of discovered targets per unit moving distance in this process. We find that, different
optimal search strategies can emerge in adaption to different termination conditions. In
particular, when the termination is regulated by a finite number of steps N, optimum
Lévy-flight strategies with various exponent µopt can emerge due to the exploitation of
the landscape. In this case, the value of N, along with the landscape features such as
the landscape size and the number of targets, can play an important role in determining
the value of µopt . When the termination is regulated by a finite moving distance L,
the best strategy is always ballistic motion corresponding to µopt → 1. To capture more

3

complex foraging dynamics, we also consider subjective returning in our model through an
exploration-return mechanism [34], and demonstrate that this returning can be another
factor that affects the foraging efficiency. Our study not only sheds new light on the the
understanding of Lévy-flight foraging, but also provides a new modelling framework to
study animal movement patterns.

Model

The foraging takes place in a finite two-dimensional L × L squared landscape with periodic boundary conditions (when the forager moves across the boundary it will continue
the movement on the opposite side of the landscape). There are K targets distributed
uniformly over the landscape, corresponding to a density ρ = L2 /K. The forager can
detect a target within its perception range rv . The mean free path of the system λ is
therefore given by λ = (2ρrv )−1 , which indicates the average straight-line moving distance
of detecting or ‘encountering’ a target in the landscape. Without loss of generality we
set rv = 1, so λ = (1/2ρ). In this paper, we assume the targets are revisitable, analogous
to the case of non-destructive foraging [27]. The goal of the forager is to explore the
landscape to find new targets.
The foraging process is a step-based stochastic process with an exploration-return
mechanism. At each step n, the forager first decides the type of the step movement:
exploration or return. Let us denote the probability of choosing exploration by pn and
the probability of choosing return by qn = 1 − pn . Moreover, we use Sn to denote the
number of distinct targets discovered by the forager up to step n, Lf to denote the
accumulated moving distance since the forager leaves its last visited target, ln to denote
the moving distance of step n, and Ln =

P

ln to denote the total moving distance up to

step n. The foraging movement at step n is performed as follows (illustrated in Figure
1):
1. If the decision is exploration, the forager will perform random search in this step.
The step-size l and the turning angle θ are drawn randomly from the pre-defined
distribution functions P (l) and P (θ). During the step movement, the forager will
continuously detect targets. If a target is detected during the step movement, the
forager will move to the target in a straight line and the step movement will be
4

truncated. The actual moving distance ln = l − ∆l in this case is smaller than
the probabilisic moving distance l and we set Lf → 0. There are two situations
of detecting a target: (a) The target is a new target that has not been discovered
before. Then we update Sn by Sn → Sn + 1 and the location of this new target is
memorised by the forager. (b) The target is a previously visited target. In this case
we do not update Sn . One should note that if this step is the first step the forager
leaves a target, the forager will ignore that target in detection to avoid trapping. If
no target is detected in this step, we update Lf by Lf → Lf + l.
2. If the decision is returning, the forager will move to one of the previously visited
targets in a straight line. Note that the forager does not attempt to detect targets in
a return step, which is analogous to the ‘blind’ phase in intermittent random search
[28]. We assume that the forager can memorise the locations of all previously visited
targets and randomly decide on the target of the return phase. In this initial model
we focus on this simple approach to modelling memory and leave more complicated
memory process to future work.
Here we assume that the foraging process starts at a random target in the landscape.
That target can be understood as the base of the forager, and its location is recorded in
the initial memory of the forager. Therefore the forager can have at least one location
to choose in the return phase. We use an indicator function Θn ∈ {0, 1} to characterise
the termination condition of the process. When a step is performed, we update n by
n → n + 1 and check the value of Θn . The process will be continued if Θn = 0, and be
terminated once Θn=N = 1 where N denotes the total number of steps upon termination.
We then define the search efficiency η as the ratio of the total number of distinct
targets discovered by the forager to the total moving distance upon termination, which
yields
η≡

One should note that, besides the subjective returning in the return phase, the forager can
also revisit a previously discovered target if it lies within the forager’s perception range
in the exploration phase. The revisitation during exploration may occur in two scenario:
(1) the forager taking advantage of the chance proximity of a previously discovered target
to relieve movement constraints (e.g. to rest or supplement energy) prior to reinitiating
5

exploration; (2) the forager can detect a target within its perception range, but is not
able to identify the resource availability in the detected target without a revisitation. In
such context, the target can be understood to be a site that contains resource (e.g. a
tree with fruits). The random search dynamics in the exploration phase in our model
resembles the non-destructive foraging in [27], while the definition of search efficiency
that only accounts for distinct targets discovered by the forager resembles the case of
destructive foraging with exploitation.
Finally, we specify the random search dynamics and the exploration-return mechanism. In this paper, we use a power-law step-size distribution for the random search,
which yields
µ−1
P (l) =
l0

l
l0

!−µ

, l ≥ l0

(2)

where 1 < µ ≤ 3 is the power-law exponent which serves as a control parameter of the
random search foraging strategy. The lower bound l0 represents the natural limit of stepsize. The movement converges to the Gaussian (Brownian motion) when µ ≥ 3, and to
ballistic motion when µ → 1. For simplicity in this paper we set l0 = rv = 1 and we use
a uniform distribution P (θ) = 1/2π for the turning angle.
To specify pn and qn , we assume that the forager makes a decision between exploration
and return according the following rule: the longer it has traveled since it leaves the last
visited target, the more likely it will decide to return. The decision rule here reflects
the accumulated resistance on the forager’s will for exploration as the moving distance
increases, such as the decline of energy level, accumulated stress of finding no new targets,
or other behavioural regularities. Therefore pn can be represented by a non-increasing
function of Lf . Specifically in this paper we define pn as an exponential function

pn = exp(−βLf )

(3)

where β is a control parameter for tuning the intensity of such returning. A higher β
leads to a higher likelihood of subjective returning during exploration, which models
more conservative foraging behaviour. Similar dynamics have been observed empirically
in both animals [35] and human [36]. The subjective returning can be used to model
the home-return patterns [34] or the central-place foraging dynamics [37, 38]. When
β = 0 such that pn = 1, the model is without an return phase and the foraging dynamics
resembles the non-destructive foraging in [27].
6

In summary, the foraging in our model is tuned by five parameters, namely µ, N,
L, K, and β. The power-law exponent µ characterises the random search strategy. The
landscape size L and the number of targets K represent the environmental features.
The number of steps N regulated by the indicator function Θn specifies the termination
of the foraging. The intensity of subjective returning β is an additional parameter to
characterise more complex foraging dynamics.

Results and Discussions
The case with β = 0

We first discuss the simple case without the subjective returning by setting β = 0 and
pn = 1. To gain better insight into the model, we derive a closed-form expression for the
search efficiency η using mean-field approximation. We then investigate the relationship
between the optimal exponent µopt and other parameters of the model using a mixture
approach of numerical simulations and analytical evaluation.
3.1.1

Approximate mean-field solution

To evaluate Eq.(1), we first calculate the numerator SN . We denote by N (S) the mean
number of steps from the beginning to the discovery of the S th new target, and ∆N (S) ≡
N (S + 1) − N (S) the mean number of steps between the discovery of the S th target and
the (S + 1)th target. Intuitively, since the foraging is confined in a finite landscape with
limited number of targets, as the forager explores the landscape more, the number of
undiscovered targets decreases and discovering new targets becomes more difficult. If the
forager detects a target at step n, the probability that the detected target is new, denoted
by pnew , should be approximately proportional to the number of undiscovered targets at
step n, namely pnew = (K − Sn )/γK where γ is a constant coefficient. Therefore, to
discover one more new target, the forager has to make 1/pnew detections on average,
which gives
∆N ≈

where nd is the mean number of steps between two consecutive detections. The assumption that ∆N ∝ (K − S)−1 indicated by Eq.(4) is supported by the numerical simulation,

Then we calculate the denominator LN . In mean-field approximation, LN can be

Via Eq.(6) and Eq.(7) we are able to calculate the search efficiency η.
To evaluate Sn analytically through Eq.(6) we still need to know nd and γ. Unfortunately obtaining an exact closed-form expression for nd and γ is still a difficult mathematical issue to date. Therefore we use curve fitting to obtain the value of C = γnd in Eq.(6)
from simulation. The advantage of this approach is that both γ and nd remain approximately constant as n increases. Therefore we can obtain the value of C by performing
the simulation up to a small number of steps (e.g. up to 20% targets in the landscape
have been discovered in our study), and then use the analytical solution to extrapolate
the results for large n. Sn evaluated by Eq.(6) with a fitting parameter C is in good
agreement with the numerical simulation, as shown in Figure 2(a). With L and K given,
to obtain a continuous curve for η(µ) by performing numerical simulations for a small
number of discrete values of µ, we can also use curve fitting to find γ(µ) and nd (µ), as
shown in Figure 2 (c) - (d). In particular we find that γ(µ) can be well approximated by
a cubic polynomial function, and nd (µ) can be well approximated by nd (µ) ∼ A(µ)λ

µ−1
2

as suggested by [27, 39] where A(µ) can be fitted by a fifth degree polynomial function.
Our results also suggest that, with µ given, γ depends on both L and K while nd only
depends on λ, as shown in Figure 2 (c) - (d).
We note that both the denominator and numerator in Eq.(1), denoting the total
moving distance LN = Nhli and total number of discovered targets SN , respectively, are
a decreasing function of µ. Intuitively this is easy to understand. In an N-step truncated
Lévy flight, decreasing µ not only leads to a larger mean step-size as indicated by Eq.(7),
8

but also enlarges the searched area so that more new targets can be discovered by the
forager. However their rates of increase with respective to the decrease of µ differ, which
may lead to an optimal value for µ that maximises their ratio. In the following we study
how the optimal exponent µ depends on the number of steps N, the landscape size L and
the number of patches K.
3.1.2

Number of steps N

To study the influence of the number of steps N, we use an indictor function Θn = δ(n−N)
such that the foraging process is terminated at n = N step for any given value of µ. Here
δ(x) is the Kronecker delta function such that δ(x) = 0 if x = 0 and δ(x) = 1 if x = 0. We
perform numerical simulation with L = 103 , K = 5000, λ = 100. The search efficiency η
is then fully determined by the number of foraging steps N and the power-law exponent
µ, which yields η = η(µ, N). We observe that for a given value of N, there exists an
optimal exponent µopt which maximises η. Surprisingly we find that the value of uopt
shifts substantially as N varies and is overall an increasing function of N, as shown in
Figure 3(a).
A simple explanation for the presence of such optimality relates to the increased
difficulty in discovering new targets later in the foraging process, particularly for smaller
µ. Recall that the forager can discover new targets more rapidly in the beginning (highefficient stage) but then enters into a difficult stage for discovering new targets in the
latter steps (low-efficient stage) as the number of new targets drops. The random search
with smaller µ will enter this low-efficient stage earlier in the foraging process, as shown
in Figure 2(a). The gain in SN from reducing µ will decline steadily, and will eventually
no longer compensate for increases in LN ; at that point, η reaches its maximum.
The optimal exponent µopt as a function of N can be obtained by solving



∂η(µ,N ) 
∂µ 

=
µ=µopt

0, as shown in the inset of Figure 3(b). We note that when N → 1 the optimal exponent
will approach µopt → 1 approximately corresponding to ballistic motion. The optimal
exponent can also approach µ = 3 for a sufficiently large N, which means the optimal
random search can go through a transition from Lévy-flight (1 < µ < 3) to Brownian
motion (µ ≥ 3) as N increases.

3.1.3

Landscape size L and number of patches K

We then study how the foraging efficiency depends on the landscape size L and number
of patches K under the termination condition Θn = δ(n − N). We evaluate the search
efficiency by varying the landscape size L and the number of patches K in three different
combinations, as shown in Figure 4: (1) varying L and K simultaneously with the mean
free path λ = L2 /2K kept constant; (2) varying L with K kept constant; (3) varying K
with L kept constant.
Intuitively, with N and λ given, as K increases, the optimal exponent µopt will shift
to a smaller value since the foraging can stay in the high-efficient stage for longer total
moving distance, accounting for the situation in combination (1). Similarly, with N
and K given, as λ decreases, µopt will shift to a larger value, since the average distance
for discovering new targets becomes shorter and the low-efficient stage comes earlier for
smaller µ, accounting for the situation in combination (2). The couple effect of increasing
K and decreasing λ is studied through combination (3). In this case, as K increases,
µopt still shifts to a smaller value, but the shifting is not as significant as the case in
combination (1).
Our results suggest that the foraging efficiency and the optimal foraging strategy
characterised by µopt can have an interesting dependence on the landscape features under
specific termination condition.
3.1.4

Termination condition Θn

The foraging defined in our model is considered to be an individual search process in a
finite area subject to termination. This setting can account for two scenarios in the realworld: (1) foraging within a restricted area during a certain foraging season; (2) foraging
in a fractal landscape (where resources are clustered in patches) such that searching each
patchy area can be viewed as a single process. In scenario (2), due to the depletion of
new targets, the forager has to decide on when to terminate the foraging. The indicator
function Θn , which characterises the termination condition and regulates the number of
steps N, can reflect the animal’s prior experience, its physical conditions or behavioural
regularity, or other environmental conditions such as seasonal variation that can has an
influence on the forager’s decision on changing foraging area. In this context, various
optimal strategies may evolve in response to different termination conditions coupled
10

with the environmental context of the foraging area.
For comparison, we study another termination condition Θn = θ(Lf − L), where θ(x)
is the step function such that θ(x) = 0 if x < 0 and θ(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0. In this case, the
foraging is terminated once the the accumulated moving distance Lf exceeds a threshold
L, and the best strategy is always ballistic motion corresponding to µopt → 1, as shown
in Figure 5. The results here implies that, if the forager always prefers exploring the
landscape with a prefixed length of moving distance L (or a certain amount of energy for
exploration if we consider energy expenditure is proportional to L), the optimal search
strategy will evolve to ballistic motion regardless of the choice of L. On the other hand,
if the forager explores the landscape with a random moving distance LN (or a random
amount of energy) regulated by a certain number of steps N, various optimal search
strategies from ballistic motion to Lévy-flight to Brownian motion can emerge depending
on the landscape features. This situation is more likely to occur in scenario (1), in which
the animal may subject to daily regularity during the foraging season. For instance,
the animal may only perform a regular number of foraging steps (trips/bouts) per day,
and the moving distance in each step is randomly distributed. It is also interesting to
note that, the optimality under the termination condition Θn = δ(n − N) can emerge
before the landscape has been fully exploited. Therefore, the optimality we observe
here remain valid even if we introduce an additional condition to the termination, i.e.
Θn = δ(n − N) + δ(Sn − K), such that the foraging will be terminated once the forager
discovers all targets (or we assume that the forager has prior knowledge of the number
of targets) and will not fall into the ’zero-gain’ regime.

3.2

The general case with β > 0

We now turn our attention to the case with β > 0 and briefly study this case with the
simple termination condition Θn = δ(n − N). We perform numerical simulation with
various intensity β and exponent µ, as shown in Figure 6(a). As might be expected, β
has a significant impact on the search efficiency. When β increases, the optimal exponent
µopt will shift to a smaller value.
The result here indicates that an optimal Lévy-flight search strategy can be tuned
by the subjective returning which is widely observed in animals. This finding is consistent with the results in [40] that the optimal exponent which maximises the entropy of
11

visited locations in Lévy-flight is reduced by incorporating more frequent returns in the
movement.
One should note that, the subjective returning here is a constraint for the random
search. With µ and N given, the search efficiency η is a monotonically decreasing function
of β, which indicates that a higher intensity of returning is harmful to the search efficiency.
Such constraint can be associated with a wide range of intrinsic physical or psychological
features of the forager or external environmental context of the landscape. For example,
a high value of β can represent a harsh foraging environment that drives the forager to
do more frequent subjective returnings.
We also look at the two components SN and LN that gauge the search efficiency. As
shown in Figure 6(b), with β given, SN is a decreasing function of µ which aligns with
the results for β = 0 that smaller µ leading to longer steps gives rise to more discovered
targets in the end. Meanwhile, with µ given, SN is a decreasing function of β. This is
also intuitive since more frequent returns reduce the portion of exploration steps in the
whole foraging process and the success rate of discovering new targets in each exploration
step. We find that, for a given β, LN remains a decreasing function of µ, as shown in
Figure 8(a). Similarly to the case with β = 0, the emergence of the optimal exponent for
exploration-return can be also explained by considering the tradeoff between increasing
SN and increasing LN .
Finally, we discuss some interesting characteristics regarding LN . In the presence of
subjective returning, LN is composed of two parts corresponding to two distinct phases
ret
respectively. In particular we can write LN = Lexp
N + LN where the superscript denotes

the corresponding phase. LN can be also written as LN = Nhli = N exp hliexp + N ret hliret
where the superscripted N and hli denote the number of steps and mean step-size in
exp
ret
each phase, and we have Lexp
hliexp , Lret
hliret and N = N exp + N ret . The
N = N
N = N

values of these quantities with respect to µ and β are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.
We find that, for a given value of µ, hli and LN are also a increasing function of β, which
indicates high intensity of returning leads to larger mean-step size. We then find that, as
expected, hliexp as a function of µ (described by Eq.(7)) does not change with respect to
β since the characteristics in the exploration phase is not affected by β, and with µ fixed
Lexp
N is a decreasing function of β since the portion of exploration steps decreases as β
increases. The increase of LN with respect to β is mostly contributed by the returns since

12

hliret is much larger than hliexp . Interestingly we find that Lret
N , as well as the portion
of return steps N ret/N , are not a monotonic function of µ and exhibit a maximum. A
possible explanation for this peak is that the value of µ determines the balance between
intended return and accidental rediscovery of a known target. A lower µ results in longer
steps, leading to higher likelihood of the forager deciding to return. A higher µ results
in shorter steps, leading the forager to revisit the same target many times consecutively
by accidentally rediscovering targets (the trapping phenomenon in the model). Following
this reasoning, the peaks in Lret
N may reflect the value of µ that maximises the aggregated
return distance due to the intended and accidental returns. Fully understanding these
phenomena is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future study.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented a simple model to study Lévy-flight foraging as an
exploratory process subject to termination in a finite landscape with countable targets.
The first important message of our results is that, the interplay between the termination of
exploiting the landscape and the environmental features such as the landscape size and
resource distribution, can have an significant influence on the development of optimal
foraging strategy. In particular, when the number of steps (or trips/bouts in foraging)
plays a role in the termination condition, various values of µopt that captures foraging
dynamics from ballistic motion to Lévy-flight to Brownian motion, can evolve in response
to other constrained factors such as the landscape size, the number of targets as well as
the intensity of subjective returning.
It would be interesting for researchers to test our model in empirical data. One
direct observable consequence suggested by our study is that, the value of µopt may
have a relationship with some dependent quantities such as the total moving distance
(energy expenditure) or the number of steps (trips/bouts) of a foraging process, as well
as the size or the resource distribution of the foraging area. This dependence may be
tested by measuring the correlation between the value of µopt and these quantities among
individuals.
This idealised model allows a variety of future extensions. In the current approach,
we do not consider energy intake and consumption, and simply assume that the forager

13

always has enough energy to perform long flights. One important improvement to the
model is to incorporate an adaptive foraging strategy based on available energy. As a
supplement to this work, one can also study other termination conditions to capture
more complex internal regularity, memory mechanisms or decision-making of foraging
[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. Moreover, one can consider time-variant and heterogenous distribution
of targets in the landscape, which can lead to a study of how the foraging strategy adapts
to the environmental changes in the presence of cognition and memory. It is also worth
extending the model to incorporate multiple foragers and studying the collective process
of competition and cooperation in foraging [46]. Finally, although it is initially proposed
to study animal foraging, our model can be generally used in other random search or
biological encountering processes as well.

Figure 1: A schematic diagram of the model. This diagram shows a foraging process
with N = 4 steps. The red dots represent targets. The cylinder formed by black dashed
boundaries indicates the detection area during an exploration step. In step one, the
forager leaves a target and detects no new target during this step. Note that the forager
ignores the departure target. In step two, the forager decides to do exploration and
detects a target during this step. Therefore the original probabilistic step (the green
dashed-dotted line) is truncated to a shorter actual step l2 (the green solid line). Step
three is similar to step one. In step four the forager decides to return and it flies straight
back to the departure target in step one. In a return step, the forager is not attempting
to detect targets.
