Abstract
In this paper we provide the derivation of a super compact pairwise model with
only 4 equations in the context of describing susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)
epidemic dynamics on heterogenous networks. The super compact model is based on
a new closure relation that involves not only the average degree but also the second and
third moments of the degree distribution. Its derivation uses an a priori approximation
of the degree distribution of susceptible nodes in terms of the degree distribution of
the network. The new closure gives excellent agreement with heterogeneous pairwise
models that contain significantly more differential equations.

Keywords: SIS epidemic; pairwise model, triple closure

Introduction

While networks have provided a new modelling paradigm for population dynamics [1, 2, 3],
these are still used in conjunction with mean-field models of various types. The most
frequently used and well-known mean-field models for network epidemics are the degreebased mean-field (DBMF) model, also known as heterogeneous mean-field [4, 3] and pairwise model [5, 6, 7]. Both continue to provide a productive framework for approximating
expected values of random variables emerging from explicit network-based stochastic simulations in different contexts and networks with different properites. The major advantage
of such mean-field models stems from the fact that often these allow us to analytically
determine quantities such as the basic reproduction number, final epidemic size or endemic equilibrium [4, 6]. Such analytic expressions then lead to a significantly better
understanding of the interplay between network and disease characteristics.
Pairwise models have originally been introduced in the context of mathematical ecology [8] followed by natural extensions to epidemiology [6]. The original simple model for
undirected and unweighted networks has been subsequently extended to networks with heterogenous degree [9], directed networks [10], weighted networks [11], networks displaying
motifs [12] and even combined with the edge-based compartmental modelling framework
for an even more compact treatment [7].
The closure in the most basic or fundamental pairwise model is based on the assumption on homogeneity of the degree distribution, i.e., all nodes have approximately the same
degree n. Hence the traditional pairwise model cannot be applied for graphs with heterogeneous degree distribution, such as bimodal graphs or networks with power law degree
distribution. This is shown in Figure 1. For heterogeneous networks, a corresponding pairwise model was introduced in [9]. This gives excellent agreement with simulations for all
configuration-like random networks [13], see Figure 1. The heterogeneous pairwise model
consist of order N 2 differential equations, where N denotes the number of nodes in the
network. An approximation of pairs leads to a simpler system, called compact pair-wise
model that consist of only order N equations [7] and still gives very good agreement with
simulations, see Figure 1.
The aim of this paper is to introduce an even simpler model with only four equations
that performs well for large heterogeneous networks. The system is derived from the
compact pairwise model by introducing a further approximation, and using a closure
relation that contains not only the average of the network’s degree distribution but also
its second and third moments.

2.1

Derivation of the super compact paiwise (PW) model
Pairwise model for homogenous networks

We start from the exact PW model. For the SIS epidemic on an arbitrary undirected
network the expected values of [S], [I], [SI], [II] and [SS] satisfy the following system of

2

differential equations
˙ = γ[I] − τ [SI],
[S]
˙ = τ [SI] − γ[I],
[I]
˙
[SI]
= γ([II] − [SI]) + τ ([SSI] − [ISI] − [SI]),
˙
[SS]
= 2γ[SI] − 2τ [SSI],
˙
[II] = −2γ[II] + 2τ ([ISI] + [SI]),

(1)

(5)

where [X], [XY ] and [XY Z] denote the expected number of nodes in state X, edges in state
X − Y and triples in state X − Y − Z, respectively, with counting according to all possible
edge directions. This effectively means that for undirected networks [XY ] = [Y X], [XX]
is double the number of unique edges in state X − X, and similarly X − Y − X accounts
twice for a unique X − Y − X triple, where X, Y ∈ {S, I}. This system is derived directly
from master equations in [14] and hence exact. We note that some of the equations can
be omitted by exploiting conservation identities, such as [S] + [I] = N .
It is well known that in order to transform Eqs. (1)-(5) into a self consistent solvable
system closures need to be applied in order to break dependency on higher order moments.
Particularly useful are closures at the level of triples. As it is well-known, the simplest
closure is
n − 1 [AS][SI]
,
(6)
[ASI] ≈
n
[S]
where n = hki is the average degree of the network, and A stands for S or I. This closure
leads to the traditional pairwise system
˙ p = γ[I]p − τ [SI]p ,
[S]
[I]˙ p = τ [SI]p − γ[I]p ,

Here the subscript p is used to emphasize that the solution of this system is different from
the exact values of the expected variables. As Figure 1 shows, this system cannot capture
network heterogeneities, hence closure (6) needs improvement.

2.2

Pairwise models for heterogenous networks: the heterogeneous, precompact and compact pairwise models

The problem with closure (6) is that it assumes that each node has degree n, which is
obviously a crude approximation for heterogeneous networks. This has led to several
heterogeneous mean-field models, where the state space is much extended to account for
the expected number of nodes in different states and with a given degree, e.g., [Sk ](t) and
[Ik ](t) for the expected number of susceptible and infected nodes of degree k, respectively.
These new variables will induce or require further variables at pair level, such as [Sk Il ](t)
which denotes the expected value of the number of edges connecting susceptible nodes of
3

degree k to infected nodes of degree l. In this spirit, the following heterogeneous models
were developed in historical order:
• heterogeneous pairwise model [9],
• pre-compact pairwise model [9] and
• compact pairwise model [7].
Instead of presenting the systems of differential equations of these models and working
from the most explicit or complex to the more compact one, we start from the simplest
model and show in an intuitive way how the more sophisticated models arise. Since closure
(6) uses the degree of the middle node, it is useful to express the triple as
[ASI] =

K
X

[ASk I],

k=1

where the different degrees occurring in the graph are k = 1, 2, . . . , K. The closure for the
the triples in the right hand side can be written as
[ASk I] ≈

k − 1 [ASk ][Sk I]
.
k
[Sk ]

(12)

In order to use this closure in the exact system (1)-(5) one needs differential equations for
[Sk ], for [Sk I] and for [Sk S]. The exact differential equations for [Sk ] are
[S˙k ] = γ[Ik ] − τ [Sk I],

k = 1, 2, . . . , K,

(13)

where the substitution [Ik ] = Nk − [Sk ] can be used. The simplest heterogeneous model [7]
uses only [Sk ] as new variables and introduces an algebraic expression that approximates
[Sk I] and [Sk S] in terms of [Sk ], [SI] and [SS] as follows:
k[Sk ]
,
[Sk I] ≈ [SI] PK
l=1 l[Sl ]

(14)

which can be interpreted as showing that the ratio of the number of edges connecting
degree k susceptible nodes to infected nodes and the number of SI edges is almost the
same as the ratio of the number of stubs starting from degree k susceptible nodes and the
total number of stubs starting from susceptible nodes. Using this approximation, closure
(12) can be simplified as given below
[ASk I] ≈

where S1 =

k − 1 [ASk ][Sk I]

k[Sk ] is the first moment of the distribution of susceptible nodes. This

k=1

leads to the so-called compact pairwise model, in which the variables are: [SI], [SS],
[II] and [Sk ] for k = 1, 2, . . . , K, i.e., it contains K + 3 differential equations. In fact,
the system consists of equations (13), and (3)-(5) with the above mentioned closures and

4

approximations, namely (14) and (15). Thus it takes the form

Here the subscript c, referring to the word ‘compact’, is used to emphasize that the solution
of this system is different from the exact expected values.
The next level of complexity is represented by the pre-compact pairwise model, in
which the variables [Sk I] and [Sk S] are kept as independent variables and differential
equations for these are written down. Thus the systems can be formulated in terms of
variables such as, [Sk ], [Sk S], [Sk I], [Ik S] and [Ik I], i.e., resulting in a total of 5K variables.
This can be done by considering the closure introduced in [9] which is
P
[An B][An B] [Nn Nm ] q q[Nq ]
,
(22)
[An Bm ] =
[AB]
n[Nn ]m[Nm ]
where Nk denotes the number of nodes of degree k. It is wroth noting that this system is
not able to account for preferential mixing.
The most complex system, which we call heterogeneous pairwise model, uses all combinations of pairs as variables, namely [Sk Sl ], [Sk Il ] and [Ik Il ]. Hence, it consists of 2K 2
differential equations. At the price of having a system with the number of equations of
quadratic order, we do not need any extra approximations (besides the closures), such as
(14) in the compact pairwise model, or (22) for the pre-compact pairwise model. Without
explicitly including the closures, the most complex system can be written as

2.3

Super compact pairwise model with heterogeneous triple closure

We now show that the network heterogeneity can be captured by a small system, containing
only four differential equations, just as in the simplest pairwise model. Consider a random
5

network with degrees d1 , d2 , . . . , dK and denote the number of nodes of degree dk by Nk
for k = 1, 2, . . . , K, i.e., N1 + N2 + . . . + NK = N . We note that denoting degrees as dk
instead of k will prove to be advantageous in the derivation below. The degree distribution
of the graph is then given by pk = NNk . The average degree and the second moment of the
degree distribution are
K

dk Nk ,
hki =

In order to arrive to our new even more simplified system, the super compact PW
model, we start from a triple and the closure given in (15)

where we used closures (12) and (14), and where S2 =

k=1

d2k [Sk ] is the second moment

of the distribution of susceptible nodes. Thus in order to use this closure in the exact
system (1)-(5) one needs an algebraic expression of S2 and S1 in terms of variables [S], [I],
[SI], [II] and [SS] only. Expressing the total number of stubs starting from susceptible
nodes we get S1 = [SI] + [SS] as an exact relation. Thus the problem arises from the
fact that such an exact relation is not available for the second moment S2 . Our heuristic

is the following. Dividing the equation

[Sk ] by [S] we get that [Sk ]/[S] is a probability distribution. The expected value

of this distribution is known, it is

k=1

dk

[Sk ]

or in other words the average degree of susceptible nodes. Our idea is to use an a priori
approximating distribution for [Sk ]/[S] that will be denoted by sk . This approximating
distribution satisfies
s1 + s2 + . . . + sK
d1 s1 + d2 s2 + . . . + dK sK

= 1,

(29)

= nS .

(30)

In order to get an a priori approximating distribution we determined [Sk ]/[S] numerically
from the compact pairwise model and compared it to pk = Nk /N , the degree distribution
of the graph. Numerical results show that these are linearly related, meaning that sk /pk is
a linear function of the degree dk . More precisely, sk /pk can be written as A(t)dk + B(t),
where A and B are time dependent with this relation assumed to hold for all degrees. This
allows to deal with the heavily under determined linear system given by Eqs. (29)-(30).
Introducing the notation qk = sk /pk the assumption on linearity can be formulated as
qK − q1
qk − q1
=
,
dk − d1
dK − d1

k = 1, 2, . . . , K.

This yields an expression for qk in terms of q1 , qK and the degrees dk as
(dK − d1 )qk = (dk − d1 )qK + (dK − dk )q1 .
6

Multiplying this equation by pk we get the following relation between sk and pk
(dK − d1 )sk = pk (dk − d1 )qK + pk (dK − dk )q1 .

(31)

Observe that q1 and qK can be determined from system (29)-(30) by substituting the
above expression for sk . Namely, we obtain
(dK − d1 ) = (n1 − d1 )qK + (dK − n1 )q1 ,
(dK − d1 )nS = (n2 − n1 d1 )qK + (n1 dK − n2 )q1 ,
where ni =

K
P

k=1

(32)
(33)

dik pk is the i-th moment of the degree distribution. (It is more convenient

to use n1 and n2 instead of hki and hk2 i.) Solving the linear system (32)-(33) for q1 and
qK we get
(n2 − n21 )q1 = n2 − n1 nS + d1 (nS − n1 ),
(n2 −

n21 )qK

= n2 − n1 nS + dK (nS − n1 ).

(34)
(35)

Substituting these expressions into (31) leads to
(dK −d1 )(n2 −n21 )sk = pk (dk −d1 )(n2 −n1 nS +dK (nS −n1 ))+pk (dK −dk )(n2 −n1 nS +d1 (nS −n1 )).
Now we are in the position of determining the approximate second moment of the distribution sk . Multiplying the above equation by d2k and summing from k = 1 to k = K some
simple algebra yields
(n2 −

n21 )

K
X

d2k sk = n2 (n2 − nS n1 ) + n3 (nS − n).

k=1

Note that the third moment n3 of the degree distribution comes into play. Thus the desired
quantity S2 can be approximated as
S2 =

K
X
k=1

d2k [Sk ] ≈

K
X

d2k [S]sk = [S]

k=1

n2 (n2 − nS n1 ) + n3 (nS − n)
.
n2 − n21

Hence using S1 = [SI] + [SS] = nS [S] we get


S2 − S1

n2 (n2 − nS n1 ) + n3 (nS − n)

Therefore, the new closure relation is


[AS][SI] n2 (n2 − nS n1 ) + n3 (nS − n)
−1 .
[ASI] =
nS [S]
nS (n2 − n21 )

(36)

We note that in the case of a homogeneous network, where each node has degree n,
we have nS = n and the average degree is n1 = n. Hence, the expression in the bracket
simplifies to nn2 − 1. Moreover, the second moment is n2 = n2 . Therefore, this term is
[AS][SI]
simply (n − 1) and leads to the traditional closure [ASI] = n−1
n
[S] .

Using the new closure (36) in the pairwise model (1)-(5) gives the super compact PW
model in the following form:
˙ s = γ[I]s − τ [SI]s ,
[S]
(37)
[I]˙ s = τ [SI]s − γ[I]s ,
(38)
˙ s = γ([II]s − [SI]s ) + τ [SI]s ([SS]s − [SI]s )Q − τ [SI]s ,
[SI]
˙ s = 2γ[SI]s − 2τ [SI]s [SS]s Q,

In the next section we show that this new super compact pairwise model gives an as accurate output as the compact pairwise model, despite of the fact that it contains significantly
fewer differential equations.

Performance of the new closure for different networks

As it was shown in the Introduction in Figure 1, the heterogeneous PW and compact PW
models give very good agreement with simulations, hence we compare the super compact
PW model with the new closure to the compact PW model. This comparison will be done
for different heterogeneous networks. Thus systems (7)-(11), (16)-(20) and (37)-(41) will
be solved numerically and the time dependence of [I]p , [I]c and [I]s are compared, where
N
P
[Ik ]c is the total number of infected nodes in the compact PW model. The
[I]c =
k=1

parameters of the epidemic are fixed at γ = 1 and τ = 3γhki/hk 2 i. The later is chosen in
such a way that the ratio of τ and its critical value τcr = γhki/hk2 i is a given constant.
Here, this ratio is chosen to be 3, its actual value has only a minor influence on the results,
generally this need to be greater than 1 to have an epidemic.
Let us consider first the case of bimodal random graphs, where there are two different
degrees d1 and d2 , N1 denotes the number of nodes with degree d1 and N2 denote the
number of nodes with degree d2 , that is N1 + N2 = N . In order to investigate the effect
of graph structure the ratio of low and high degree nodes, i.e., N1 and N2 is varied.
The degrees are fixed at k1 = 5 and k2 = 35. In Figure 2 the curves [I]p , [I]c and [I]s
are shown in three cases. The average degree and the standard deviation of the degree
distribution is shown in Table 1. One can see that the new system agrees with and is
almost indistinguishable from the compact pairwise model, in fact for bimodal graphs [I]s
coincides with [I]c since Eqs. (29)-(30) provide a unique solution without involving any
approximations. Figure 2 shows that the traditional pairwise model performs relatively
well only in the case when the standard deviation is small, that is the graph is nearly
homogeneous.
Consider now the case of configuration random graphs with cutoff power law degree
distribution. These random graphs are given by a minimal degree kmin , a maximal degree
kmax and a power α. The degree distribution of the graph is p(k) = Ck−α for k =
kmin , kmin + 1, . . . , kmax with the normalisation constant C given by
kX

k−α .

In Figure 3 again the functions [I]p , [I]c (t) and [I]s (t) are shown for a sparse (lower curves)
and a dense (upper curves) power law configuration graph with power α = 2. Table 1
again shows the average degree and the standard deviation of the degree distribution of
the sparse and dense networks. The value of τ in both cases is τ = 3γhki/hk2 i. We can
see again that the super compact PW model gives excellent agreement with the compact
pairwise model.

kmin = 1 and kmax = 35, for the dense one kmin = 10 and kmax = 140, the power is α = 2.

Discussion

In this short paper, we derived a super compact pairwise model consisting of only 4
equations for SIS dynamics and for heterogenous networks constructed according to the
configuration model. This represents an improvement of going from order K, where K
is the number of distinct degrees in the network, to order one equations, namely 4. We
note that the closure that made the reduction possible relies on the observation that the
distribution of susceptible nodes of degree k, which is time dependent, can be related to
the original degree distribution of the network via a simple linear relation. We note that
the linear relation may not be the single or unique choice, more sophisticated functional
forms could be used based on combinatorial arguments. Moreover, the closure will not only
encompass the first and second moment of the degree distribution but also the third. The
new super compact model gives excellent agreement with the previously derived compact
pairwise model.
The accuracy of the new closure can be estimated in a semi-analytic way. The numerical solution of the compact PW will allow to evaluate
E=

S2 − S1
− Q,
S12

which quantifies the performance of the newly derived closure, upon using the compact
PW model as a benchmark. Moreover, it can be shown analytically that the difference
|[I]s (t) − [I]c (t)| can be estimated by a constant multiple of E. Further work on this model
will include a detailed bifurcation study of the closed super compact pairwise system and
we will aim to determine the stability of the disease free and endemic steady states. We
will also investigate whether an explicit formula for the endemic steady state is possible.
9

If these calculations will be tractable, the stability of the disease free steady state should
also yield R0 or at least an R0 -like quantity for the super compact PW model.

Figure 1: SIS epidemic propagation on a bimodal configuration random graph: simulation
(gray thick curve), pair-wise (black dashed), compact pair-wise (black continuous), heterogeneous pair-wise (red continuous). The two latter curves are nearly indistinguishable.
The parameter values are N = 1000, N1 = N2 = N/2, k1 = 5, k2 = 35, γ = 1 and
τ = 3γhki/hk2 i.

Figure 2: The curves [I]p (dashed), [I]c (continuous) and [I]s (circles) for a bimodal
graph with different ratios of the number of low and high degree nodes. The upper
curves correspond to N1 = 0.1N , N2 = 0.9N , the middle ones are based on N1 = 0.5N ,
N2 = 0.5N and the lower are for N1 = 0.9N , N2 = 0.1N . The parameter values are
N = 1000, k1 = 5, k2 = 35, γ = 1 and τ = 3γhki/hk 2 i.

Figure 3: The curves [I]p (dashed), [I]c (continuous) and [I]s (circles) for sparse (lower
curves) and a dense (upper curves) power law configuration graphs. The lower curves
belong to the sparse case with kmin = 5 and kmax = 30. The upper curves belong to the
dense case with kmin = 10 and kmax = 140. The power is α = 2 in both cases. The
parameter values are N = 1000, γ = 1 and τ = 3γhki/hk2 i.
