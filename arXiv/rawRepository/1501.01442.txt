ABSTRACT

Superoxide reductase (SOR) is a small metalloenzyme which catalyzes
reduction of O2.- to H2O2 and thus provides an antioxidant mechanism against
superoxide radicals. Its active site contains an unusual mononuclear ferrous
center, which is very efficient during electron transfer to O 2.- [Lombard, M.,
Fontecave, M., Touati, D., and Nivière, V. (2000) Journal of Biological
Chemistry 275, 115-121]. The reaction of the enzyme from Desulfoarculus
baarsii with superoxide was studied by pulse radiolysis methods. The first step
is an extremely fast bi-molecular reaction of superoxide reductase with
superoxide, with a rate constant of (1.1±0.3)x109 M-1 s-1. A first intermediate is
formed which is converted to a second one at a much slower rate constant of
500±50 s-1. Decay of the second intermediate occurs with a rate constant of
25±5 s-1. These intermediates are suggested to be iron-superoxide and ironperoxide species. Furthermore, the role of glutamate 47 and lysine 48, which are
the closest charged residues to the vacant sixth iron coordination site, has been
investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of glutamate 47 into alanine
has no effect on the rates of the reaction. On the contrary, mutation of lysine 48
into an isoleucine led to a 20-30-fold decrease of the rate constant of the bimolecular reaction, suggesting that lysine 48 plays an important role during
guiding and binding of superoxide to the iron center II. In addition, we report

3

that expression of the lysine 48 sor mutant gene hardly restored to a superoxide
dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli mutant the ability to grow under aerobic
conditions.

Superoxide radical (O2.-) is the univalent reduction product of molecular
oxygen. It belongs to the group of the so-called toxic oxygen derivatives, which
also include hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals (1). For years the only
enzymatic system known to catalyze the elimination of superoxide was the
superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1, which catalyzes dismutation of superoxide
radical anions to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen (2) :
O2.- + O2.- + 2 H+ H2O2 + O2
Very recently, a new concept in the field of the mechanisms of cellular
defense against superoxide has emerged (3, 4). It was discovered that
elimination of O2.- could also occur by reduction, a reaction catalyzed by an
enzyme thus named superoxide reductase (SOR) :
SORred + O2.- + 2 H+ SORox
SORox + 1e- SORred
Two classes of SOR have been described. The first one is a small protein found
in anaerobic sulfate-reducing and microaerophilic bacteria, initially called
desulfoferrodoxin (Dfx). It is a homodimer of 2x14kDa, which has been
extensively studied (3, 5-8), and the protein from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans
has been structurally characterized (9). The monomer is organized in two protein
domains. The N-terminal domain has a fold similar to that of desulforedoxin
(10) and contains a mononuclear ferric iron, center I, coordinated by four

5

cysteines in a distorted rubredoxin-type center (9). In the SOR from the
microaerophilic bacteria Treponema pallidum only one of these cysteines is
conserved and the N-terminal domain does not chelate iron (8). The second
domain of SOR contains a different mononuclear iron center, center II,
consisting of an oxygen-stable ferrous iron with square-pyramidal coordination
to four nitrogens from histidines as equatorial ligands and one sulfur from a
cysteine as the axial ligand (9). The midpoint redox potentials have been
reported to be 2-4 mV for center I, and 90-240 mV for center II (6, 7).
It has been demonstrated that the iron center II of SORs from
Desulfoarculus baarsii and Treponema pallidum is the active site as it reduces
superoxide very efficiently, without significant SOD activity (3, 8). A second
order rate constant for the reaction of iron center II with superoxide has been
determined to be 0.7-1x109 M-1 s-1 (3, 8), a value comparable to the value of the
rate constant determined for SODs (11, 12). In addition, the active site of SOR is
specific for O2.- since the reduced iron center II is not oxidized by O2 and only
very slowly by H2O2 (3, 8). How a reduced iron center II is regenerated for a
second cycle with O2.- has not yet been clearly demonstrated and the electron
donor to SOR remains to be identified.
Although SOR is not naturally present in E. coli it was demonstrated that
expression of SORs from D. baarsii and T. pallidum in E. coli could totally
replace the SOD enzymes to overcome a superoxide stress (8, 13). That SOR

6

was an efficient antioxidant protein also in sulfate-reducing bacteria, its natural
host, was further shown from the observation that a Desulfovibrio vulgaris
Hildenborough mutant strain lacking the sor gene was very oxygen-sensitive
during transient exposure to microaerophilic conditions (14).
A second class of SOR has been characterized from the anaerobic
archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus (4). The homotetrameric protein presented strong
homologies to neelaredoxin (Nlr), a small protein containing a single
mononuclear center, earlier characterized from sulfate-reducing bacteria (15).
Very recently, the three-dimensional structure of the P. furiosus SOR has been
determined at high resolution (16). The overall protein fold is similar to that of
the iron center II domain of SOR from D. desulfuricans and the structure of the
unique mononuclear iron center is similar to that of the iron center II.
Obviously, there is no rubredoxin-like center I domain in SOR from P. furiosus.
This again is consistent with the notion that center II is the active center.
Interestingly, the crystal structure of SOR from P. furiosus suggested that the
sixth iron coordination site of center II might be occupied by a glutamate,
strongly conserved among all the primary known sequences of SORs, only in
the oxidized state. In the reduced form instead, this site is vacant or occupied by
solvent molecules and is thus potentially accessible to O2.- (Scheme 1).
However, whether this observation was an artifact of crystallization or the
manifestation of an important feature of the enzymatic mechanism of SOR

7

needs further investigation. In addition, the presence of a strictly conserved
lysine residue, close to the vacant sixth iron-coordination site, suggests that this
position may play a role in facilitating the binding of superoxide to the iron
center (9, 16) (Scheme 1).
In this work, in order to learn more about the mechanism of action of
SOR, we have studied the reaction of the enzyme from Desulfoarculus baarsii
with superoxide by the mean of pulse radiolysis and site-directed mutagenesis.
Pulse radiolysis, which allows specific and quantitative production of
superoxide, when coupled with spectrophotometric detection, is particularly
adapted to study such a reaction. We have found that during reaction of the iron
center II with superoxide, at least two successive reaction intermediates are
formed. Furthermore, the role of Glu47 and Lys48 which correspond to the Glu
and Lys residues discussed above (Scheme 1) has been investigated by sitedirected mutagenesis and pulse radiolysis. Only Lys48 seems to play an
important role for catalysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. 1-2 mM KO2 stock solutions were prepared in anhydrous
Me2SO as described in (3). Xanthine oxidase Grade IV from milk (0.19
unit/mg), catalase from Aspergillus niger (6600 units/mg), cytochrome c from
bovine heart, CuZn SOD from bovine erythrocytes (6000 units/mg) were from
Sigma. For pulse radiolysis experiments, sodium formate and Tris base were of
the highest quality available (Prolabo Normatom or Merck Suprapure). Oxygen
was delivered by ALPHA GAZ. Its purity is higher than 99.99%. Water was
purified using an Elga Maxima system (resistivity 18.2 MΩ).
Bacterial Strain and PCR-Based Site-directed Mutagenesis. E. coli strain
QC 2375 (sodA sodB recA) was previously described (13). SOR mutants were
generated from the plasmid pMJ25, in which the sor gene from Desulfoarculus
baarsii was cloned (13). Six primers were designed and used for PCR-based
site-directed mutagenesis to create the two mutants, Glu47Ala SOR and
Lys48Ile SOR.

Primer 1 (5'AGAATTCGAGCTCAAGTGCG), and primer 2

(5'AAAAGCTTAAATCTCCAGAGAGTGAAC), were used to generate the entire Dfx
coding region (515 bp) with an EcoR1 and a HindIII restriction site
(underlined), respectively. Primers 3 (5'GTGCTTGGCCTTGGCCGCATC for
Glu47Ala and 5'CGGCACGTGGATTTCCTTGGC for Lys48Ile) and primers 4
(5'GCCAAGGCCAAGCACGTG

for

9

Glu47Ala

and

5'GCCAAGGAAATCCACGTGCCG for Lys48Ile) contained the mutation of
interest (underlined). For each mutation, two separate PCR reactions were used
to amplify the 5' portion (primers 1 and 3) and 3' portion (primers 2 and 4) of the
sor DNA from pMJ25. The PCR products were purified and used as a template
DNA for a second round of PCR using primers 1 and 2. The resulting Glu47Ala
and Lys48Ile sor PCR products were double digested with EcoRI and HindIII
and inserted into the corresponding sites of the expression vector pJF119EH,
under ptac promotor control (13). The two resulting plasmids, pMLE47A and
pMLK48I were transformed in E. coli DH5. The constructs and the mutations
were verified by DNA sequencing.
Purification of SORs. The wild-type and mutant SOR proteins were
purified according to the same procedure. E. coli QC 2375/pMJ25 or
DH5/pMLE47A or DH5/pMLK48I cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C in
M9 minimal medium complemented with 0.4 % glucose, 2 µg/ml thiamin, 1
mg/ml casamino acid, 1 mM FeSO4 7H2O and 100 µg/ml ampicilin (8 x 1000 ml
in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask). 2 mM IPTG were added at OD 600 nm of 0.3. At
OD 600 nm of about 2.0, cells were chilled and collected by centrifugation. All
the following operations were carried out at 4 °C and pH 7.6. The cell pellet was
suspended in 3 volumes (w/v) of 0.1 M Tris/HCl and sonicated. After
ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm during 90 min in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor, the
supernatant was treated with streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 2% w/v),

10

and after centrifugation was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate (final
concentration 80 % w/v). The pellet was dissolved in 12 ml of 25 mM Tris/HCl
and loaded onto an ACA 54 column (360 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer.
A low molecular weight fraction was collected. Protein fractions of 20-30 mg
were further chromatographed onto an anion exchange column Uno Q-6 (BioRad), equilibrated with 10 mM Tris/HCl, using a Bio-Rad Biologic system. A
linear NaCl gradient was applied (0-0.15 M NaCl) with the same buffer, with a
flow rate of 2 ml.min-1 during 50 min. Fractions (about 7 mg) were eluted at 70
mM, 50 mM and 80 mM NaCl for SOR wild-type, SOR Glu47Ala and SOR
Lys48Ile, respectively. In all cases, the fractions exhibited a A280nm/A503nm ratio
of 4.8-4.9. At this stage, the three SOR proteins appeared to be homogeneous, as
shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (15% acrylamide). Protein concentration was
determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (17). Protein-bound iron
was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Mass spectra were obtained
on a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped
with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray source operating at atmospheric pressure.
EPR measurements were made on a Bruker EMX 081 spectrophotometer
equipped with an Oxford Instrument continuous flow cryostat.
Steady-State Measurement of the Kinetic Parameters of the oxidation of
SOR by O2.-. The kinetics of the oxidation of SOR by O2.-, generated by the
xanthine-xanthine oxidase system, was followed spectrophotometrically, in the

11

absence or in the presence of different amounts of CuZn SOD, as reported
previously (3). At the concentration of SOD which decreases by 50% the rate of
oxidation of SOR, one can write : kSOD [SOD] = kSOR [SOR] (Eq. 1) where kSOR
and kSOD are the second-order rate constants of the reaction of SOR and SOD
with O2.-, respectively. Taking into account the known second-order rate
constant of the reaction of O2.- with CuZn SOD at low [O2.-], 2x109 M-1 s-1 (11),
the second order rate constant of the oxidation of SOR by O2.-, kSOR, was
calculated using Eq. 1 (3).
Pulse Radiolysis Experiments. Free radicals were generated by the
application into an aqueous solution of a 200 ns pulse of high energy electrons,
ca. 4 MeV from a linear accelerator located at the Curie Institute, Orsay France
(18). The doses per pulse (2-15 Gy) were calibrated from the absorption of the
thiocyanate radical SCN•- obtained by radiolysis of thiocyanate ion solution in
N2O-saturated phosphate buffer ([SCN-] =10-2 M, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7,
G(SCN•-)= 0.55 µmol. J-1, 472 nm, = 7580 M-1 cm-1) (19). Superoxide radicals
were generated during scavenging of radiolytically generated HO. free radicals
by 100 mM formate, in O2 saturated solution :
H2O + hv  HO•, eaq-, H•, H2O2, H2, H3O+
HO• + HCO2- CO2- + H2O
H• + HCO2- CO2- + H2

12

CO2- + O2 CO2 + O2•eaq- + O2 O2•H• + O2  HO2•
HO2• H+ + O2•- (pKa = 4.7)
This radical is obtained in pure form in less than one microsecond (20).
Unless otherwise stated, samples to be irradiated were made up in 10 mM
Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mM sodium formate, and saturated with pure O2.
The doses per pulse were ca. 5 Gy ([O2.-] ≈ 3 µM). The O2.- concentration and
self-decay were also assayed from its own absorbance at 271 nm (molar
extinction coefficient of 1400 M-1 cm-1) and compared to literature data (21).
The protein concentration was always between 70 and 150 µM. The reaction
was followed spectrophotometrically between 450 and 750 nm, in a 2 cm path
length cuvette designed for pulse radiolysis experiments. Time-dependent
difference absorbances were recorded on a digital oscilloscope from two
different experiments at two different time scales. Kinetics were always
analyzed at different wavelengths. The traces could always be fitted according
to a first order kinetic law. For the reaction of superoxide with SOR or any
mutant, apparent rate constants were always proportional to protein
concentration (between 70 and 150µM), hence the rate constants were equal to
the slopes of straight lines kapp versus [protein]. The spectra of the intermediates

13

were reconstructed from the absorbances at maxima in the wavelength range
investigated.

RESULTS

Expression and Purification of the SOR mutants. The level of expression
in E. coli of the Glu47Ala and the Lys48Ile mutant forms of SOR from D.
baarsii was similar to that of the recombinant wild-type enzyme (3). The two
mutants were purified by following a similar protocol to that for the wild-type
SOR (3) and were both obtained in homogeneous form, as shown by SDSPAGE electrophoresis. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis showed a major
species at 13,968 Da and at 14,011 Da for the Glu47Ala and the Lys48Ile
mutant forms of SOR, respectively, corresponding to the molecular masses
expected from the amino acid sequences, without the N-terminal Met residue
(13). The iron content of both SOR mutants was determined by atomic
absorption spectroscopy. Values of 2.0 and 1.9 iron atoms per polypeptide chain
were found for the Glu47Ala and the Lys48Ile mutants, respectively. No
evidence for the presence of zinc or manganese atoms was found in both mutant
proteins (data not shown).
Spectral Properties of Glu47Ala and Lys48Ile mutants. As shown in Fig.
1, the UV-visible spectra of the as-isolated Glu47Ala and the Lys48Ile mutants
exhibited the usual absorption bands at 370 nm and 503 nm, contributed by the
ferric iron from center I (5, 7). The ratio A280 nm/A503 nm was about 4.8 for both
mutant proteins and a value of the molar extinction coefficient at 503 nm was

15

determined to be 4,400 M-1 cm-1 in both cases, similar to that reported for the
wild-type SOR (3). When treated with successive additions of stoichiometric
amounts of O2.-, both mutants exhibited an increase of the absorbances in the
500-700 nm range, reflecting oxidation of iron of center II (3, 7) (Fig. 1). Full
oxidation was achieved after addition of 4 to 8 molar excess of O 2.-, as in the
case of the wild-type protein (3).
The oxidized Lys48Ile mutant (Fig. 1B) exhibited a spectrum comparable
to that of the oxidized wild-type protein (Fig. 1A) (so-called gray form), with
absorption bands contributed by the ferric irons from both centers I and II (7).
However, the band specific for center II was centered at 635 nm, a value slightly
different from that observed in the case of the wild-type protein (max = 644 nm)
(3). The molar extinction coefficient at 635 nm was found to be 1,400 mM -1 cm1

, a slightly lower value with respect to that for the wild-type SOR at 644 nm

(1,900 mM-1 cm-1) (3).
In the oxidized Glu47Ala mutant (Fig. 1C), the absorption band specific
for center II was even more blue-shifted (max = 580 nm). The value of the molar
extinction coefficient at 580 nm was 1,600 mM-1 cm-1, again slightly lower than
that for the wild-type SOR. With both mutants, comparable spectra were
obtained when O2.- was provided by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (data
not shown).

16

Oxidation of wild-type and mutant SORs by a slight molar excess of H2O2
gave spectra comparable to those obtained with O2.- as an oxidant (data not
shown). Addition of sodium ascorbate in excess to the O2.--fully oxidized
Glu47Ala and Lys48Ile mutants restored the visible spectra of the as-isolated
proteins (data not shown).
EPR Spectroscopy Analysis. The 4 K EPR spectra of Glu47Ala and
Lys48Ile mutants displayed resonances at g = 7.7, 5.7, 4.1 and 1.8, similar to
those obtained for the wild-type SOR (3) (data not shown). These resonances are
typical of those for a distorted FeS4 center and are assigned to center I (5, 7).
The 4 K EPR spectrum of the O2.--oxidized Lys48Ile mutant presented an
additional signal at g = 4.3 (data not shown), as also observed for wild-type
SOR (3), attributed to the oxidized center II (7). The 4 K EPR spectrum of the
oxidized Glu47Ala mutant also displayed a signal at g = 4.3 corresponding to
oxidized center II. However, this signal was more complex with an additional
feature at g = 4.2 (data not shown).
Steady-state kinetics of the reaction of the Glu47Ala and Lys48Ile mutants
with O2.-. The effect of the Glu47Ala and Lys49Ile mutations on the rate
constant for the oxidation of Dfx by O2.- was tested using a methodology
developed earlier (3). The kinetics of the oxidation of the iron center by O2.-,
generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system in the presence of catalase,
was followed spectrophotometrically at 575 or 635 nm for the Glu47Ala and

17

Lys48Ile mutants, respectively, in the absence or in the presence of different
amounts of SOD (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, in the case of the Glu47Ala
mutant, addition of large amounts of SOD resulted in the decrease of the initial
rate of oxidation. The inset shows a linear plot of the reciprocal of the initial rate
of oxidation of the iron center (vox) as a function of SOD concentration. From
this plot, the concentration of SOD that decreased by 50% the rate of the
reaction was determined to be 13±3 µM. The second order rate constant of the
oxidation of the iron center by O2.- was calculated using Eq. 1 (Materials and
Methods) and a value of (1.4±0.4)x109 M-1 s-1 was obtained. This value is close
to that determined for the wild-type protein under the same experimental
conditions, (0.8±0.2)x109 M-1 s-1 (data not shown and (3)), suggesting that the
Glu47Ala mutation has almost no effect on the reaction of SOR with O2.-.
In Fig. 2B is shown the kinetics of the oxidation of the Lys48Ile mutant by
O2.- and the effect of increasing amounts of SOD. The reaction goes much
slower and

the concentration of SOD that decreased by 50% the rate of

oxidation of the iron center was determined to be 0.38±0.04 µM. The second
order rate constant of the oxidation of the iron center by O 2.- was calculated to
be (4.2±0.5)x107 M-1 s-1. This value is about 20-fold lower than that determined
in the case of the wild-type protein (see above), clearly showing that the Lys
residue at position 48 plays an important role in the oxidation of center II by
O2.-.

18

Complementation of E. coli SOD-deficient strains by Glu47Ala and
Lys48Ile mutant forms of SOR . The ability of the SOR mutated proteins to
complement E. coli SOD deficiency was tested as described in (13). The E. coli
sodA sodB recA mutant cannot grow in the presence of oxygen because of the
combined lack of superoxide dismutase activity (sodA sodB) and the DNA
strand break repair activity (recA) that results in lethal DNA oxidative damage
(22, 23). As shown in Table I, the production of the Glu47Ala mutated SOR
protein restored aerobic growth of sodA sodB recA mutant with nearly the same
efficiency as that of the wild-type SOR protein. In contrast, production of the
Lys48Ile SOR mutated protein did not permit colony formation after 24 h.
However colonies appeared after further incubation, reaching normal size only
after 72 h. Furthermore, less than 20% of anaerobically growing bacteria
producing the mutated SOR were able to grow aerobically, compared to 70% of
those producing wild type SOR. This indicates that production of Lys48Ile SOR
can compensate for the SOD deficiency, but with much less efficiency than
wild-type and Glu 47Ala SOR forms.

Pulse radiolysis experiments and observation of reaction intermediates.
In order to study the reaction of SOR wild-type or mutant proteins with
O2.- in the µs-ms time range and to detect reactive intermediate species, we have
carried out pulse radiolysis experiments. Under our experimental conditions,

19

proteins were present in large excess with regard to superoxide ([protein] = 70150 µM, [O2.-] = 3 µM).
i) Reaction of the wild-type SOR with superoxide. Absorbances between
450 and 700 nm increased and reached a maximum ca. 50 µs after the pulse. The
absorbances then remained stable for at least 300 µs. Kinetics were analyzed at
different wavelengths and were all found qualitatively identical. Fig. 3 shows
two representative traces, at 550 and 630 nm. A second-order rate constant for
the reaction of (1.1±0.3)x109 M-1 s-1 was determined. These data are consistent
with the very fast formation of a first reaction intermediate during the first 50 µs
of the reaction. The spectrum of this intermediate could be reconstructed from
the absorbances at different wavelengths obtained after 50 µs reaction (Fig. 4).
This intermediate species exhibits a maximum at 610 nm and a shoulder at 550
nm (Fig. 4). The molar extinction coefficient at 610 nm for this first
intermediate, is equal to 4700 M-1 cm-1, assuming that the reaction of SOR with
3 µM of O2.- is quantitative.
This first intermediate underwent transformations on the millisecond time
scale. Fig. 5 shows two representative traces (up to 15 ms) at 580 and 630 nm.
All traces between 450 and 700 nm can be described as the sum of two
exponential processes, both independent of the protein concentration at all
wavelengths investigated. These processes have rate constants of 500±50 s -1 and
25±5 s-1, respectively. Unfortunately, the final absorbances could not be

20

determined because of the lamp instability after about 0.1 s and the reaction
could not be further investigated after about 35 ms reaction time.
The spectrum of the second intermediate species formed at a rate of
500 s-1 at its maximum concentration is shown on Fig. 5. It exhibited a spectrum
with a sharp band centered at 630 nm (Fig. 4). When compared with the
previous intermediate formed after 50 µs reaction (Fig. 4), the shoulder at 550
nm has vanished and the absorbance at 630 nm has increased. The extinction
coefficients of the second intermediate were calculated from the fitting values,
since deconvolution of the two first-order kinetic processes was necessary. A
value of 6500 M-1 cm-1 at 630 nm was calculated.
At the end of the reaction, the difference spectrum (pulse radiolysistreated SOR minus initial SOR) indicated that about 6 µM SOR iron center II
had been oxidized (data not shown). This is likely to be the result of an initial
oxidation of SOR with 3 µM of O2.- generated by pulse radiolysis, followed by a
further oxidation with 3.35 µM of H2O2. 3 µM H2O2 comes from the reaction of
reduction of O2.- and 0.35 µM from the radiolytic process (G(H2O2)=0.7µmolJ1

).
ii) Reaction of the Glu47Ala mutant SOR with superoxide. Absorbance

changes reached a plateau 50 µs after the pulse, at all wavelengths between 450
and 700 nm (data not shown), as observed in the case of the wild-type SOR
(Fig. 3). It displays a peak at 630 nm and a broad shoulder at around 580 nm,

21

comparable to that of the first intermediate during the reaction of wild-type
SOR. The rate constant for the formation of this first intermediate is equal to
(1.2±0.2)x109 M-1 s-1. This value is identical to that found for the wild-type
protein. The extinction coefficient of this species at 630 nm was found to be
5830 M-1 cm-1, assuming a quantitative reaction of SOR with 3 µM O2.-.
On a longer time scale, absorbance changes could be fitted with two
successive first order reactions, at all the wavelengths investigated between 500
and 680 nm (data not shown). The observed rate constants for both reactions did
not vary with the protein concentration and values of 440±50 s -1 and 20±5 s-1,
respectively, were determined (data not shown). These rate constants are
comparable to those determined for the wild-type protein. The spectrum of a
second intermediate reached a maximal intensity 5 ms after the pulse (Fig. 6)
and was found roughly comparable to the spectrum of the second intermediate in
the case of the wild-type SOR. However, for the former, a smaller extinction
coefficient value for the peak at 630 nm and a more visible shoulder at 570 nm
were observed.
iii) Reaction of the mutant Lys48Ile mutant SOR with superoxide. In the
case of the Lys48Ile mutant, at all the wavelengths observed between 475 and
700 nm, the initial absorbance changes occurred much more slowly. Fig. 7
shows a representative trace of the time-dependent absorbance change at 600
nm. All kinetic traces between 475 and 700 nm could be described by the sum of

22

two exponential processes, with a maximum of absorbances at all wavelengths
obtained 1 ms after the pulse. The rate of formation of this first 1 ms
intermediate is equal to (3.8±0.6)x107 M-1 s-1. This value is more than one order
of magnitude lower than that determined in the case of the wild-type and the
Glu47Ala mutant. The reconstituted spectrum of this intermediate shows one
broad band centered at 600 nm without any shoulder (Fig. 8). It differs clearly
from that found for the wild-type SOR (Fig. 4). This species then underwent a
transformation, which seems to be complete about 10 ms after the pulse. The
rate constant of this transformation did not depend on the protein concentration
and was found to be 300±30 s-1. The reconstituted absorption spectrum, 10 ms
after the pulse, is shown on Fig. 8. It is comparable to the spectrum of the 1 ms
intermediate, albeit with a smaller intensity and a significant red shift from 600
nm to about 615 nm for the max. It is followed by a much slower transformation
which however is difficult to follow with our device (data not shown). The final
absorbances were then measured on a UV-visible spectrophotometer, when the
reaction was completed. The difference spectrum (pulse radiolysis treated SOR
minus initial SOR) was consistent with the oxidation of the iron center II with
O2.- generated by pulse radiolysis, plus an oxidation with H2O2, coming from
superoxide reduction and from its radiolytic formation (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

In the present work, we have investigated the reaction of SOR from D.
baarsii with superoxide by pulse radiolysis experiments. Pulse radiolysis is one
of the rare techniques that allow instantaneous and specific production of
superoxide, in a dose-controlled manner, and is then particularly appropriate to
study the reaction of SOR. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically in
the 450-750 nm region, since the active site of SOR, the iron center II, exhibits
one absorption band at 644 nm in its oxidized redox state, assigned to a
cysteinyl ligand to iron (III) charge transfer transition (7).
The data presented here are consistent with a very fast bi-molecular
reaction of iron center II with superoxide, with a second order rate constant of
about 1 x 109 M-1 s-1, followed by the formation of two successive transient
intermediate species, with spectral absorbances in the 500-750 nm range. The
rate constants for the formation and disappearance of the two intermediates are
summarized in Table II. Unfortunately, because of the lamp instability of the
apparatus, we were not able to investigate the last part of the reaction, which
gives the final product of the reaction, i.e. the oxidized iron center II of SOR and
H2O2. On the basis of the rates of appearance and decay of the observed
transient species and of their independence on protein concentration, we

24

conclude that these species are true active site intermediates formed during the
reaction of SOR with O2.-.
Although the UV-visible absorption properties cannot provide enough
information in order to identify the observed intermediates, we make the
proposal that these transient species are the corresponding iron (II)-superoxide
and iron (III)-peroxide species, as illustrated in Scheme 2. The first intermediate
is suggested to be an iron (II)-superoxide species, resulting from the very fast
binding of O2.- to the solvent accessible coordination site of the reduced iron
center II (9, 16). The second intermediate is proposed to derive from an electron
transfer from the iron to O2.- to give a species which would probably be an iron
(III)-peroxide complex. Nonheme mononuclear peroxo-iron(III) species, which
have been characterized in the case of several model compounds, are known to
exhibit electronic transitions in the 500-600 nm region, associated with the
peroxo to the iron (III) charge transfer transition (24, 25, 26). Finally, the last
slowest part of the reaction, which is partly lacking from our analysis, would
correspond to the release of H2O2. Further studies are required to identify the
steps where protonation of the peroxide takes place.
In order to further characterize these intermediate species, clearly more
investigations are required. However, because of the very rapid kinetics of
formation and disappearance of the first intermediate, it might be difficult or
even impossible to accumulate and stabilize it in order to apply other

25

spectroscopic techniques for more detailed characterization. In the case of the
second intermediate, rapid freeze quench techniques, coupled to EPR or Raman
spectroscopies may give valuable information on the nature of this species.
In previous work and here, we have shown that the rate constant for the
oxidation of center II by O2.-, determined by steady-state measurements, is
almost identical to the value obtained by pulse radiolysis for the formation of the
first intermediate species (Table II). Although the overall process of the
oxidation of center II by O2.- (rate-limited at least by the disappearance of the
second intermediate at 25 s-1) is much slower than the initial bimolecular
process, the steady-state experiments are in very good agreement with the pulse
radiolysis data. As a matter of fact, during the steady-state kinetics, competition
with SOD allows to determine a rate constant only for the direct bimolecular
reaction between O2.- and the iron center II. No kinetic information for the
following intramolecular steps that will produce the oxidized form of iron center
II could be deduced from these experiments.
In order to get deeper insight into the mechanism of SOR, we have
investigated the role of two amino-acid residues, Glu47 and Lys48. The two
available

three-dimensional

structures

of

SORs

from

Desulfovibrio

desulfuricans (9) and Pyrococcus furiosus (16) show that the two residues
homologous to Glu47 and Lys48 in the case of D. baarsii are the charged
residues closest to the sixth free coordination position of the iron center II and

26

thus are potentially important for catalysis (Scheme 1). In order to evaluate the
importance of these residues, we have changed Glu47 and Lys48 into Ala and
Ile, respectively. The purified mutant proteins were correctly folded and fully
metallated. They were both reactive towards superoxide, allowing comparison to
the wild-type SOR.
The reactivity of the Glu47Ala mutant with regard to superoxide is similar
to that of the wild-type protein. As shown by pulse radiolysis experiments, the
two observed intermediate species were characterized with formation rate
constants and visible spectra comparable to those observed in the case of the
wild-type SOR (Table II). This suggests that Glu47 does not participate to the
first steps of the reaction. Accordingly, from the three-dimensional structure of
P. furiosus, it was suggested that Glu14, corresponding to Glu47 in D. baarsii,
did not bind to the reduced iron center II (16) (Scheme 1). Thus, in both wildtype and mutant SORs, a coordination position is available. The only difference
between the mutant and wild-type SOR resides in the spectroscopic properties of
the final product. The absorption band of center II of the oxidized mutant is
blue-shifted with respect to wild-type SOR, from 644 to 580 nm, and the 4 K
EPR spectra display slight differences. The three-dimensional structure of SOR
from P. furiosus also suggested that in the oxidized state, Glu14 occupies the
sixth coordination site of the iron center (16). It is thus not surprising that

27

removal of Glu47 would result in significant modifications of the electronic
properties and geometry of the oxidized iron center II.
Finally, in agreement with the absence of effects of the mutation on the
reactivity of iron center II towards superoxide, we have found that expression of
the sor Glu47Ala mutant gene restores the capability for aerobic growth of an
oxygen-sensitive sodA sodB recA E. coli mutant strain as efficiently as does the
wild-type sor gene. Thus the mutant gene still provides strong protective effects
against oxidation stress. In conclusion, Glu47 does not appear to be absolutely
required for a functional SOR within the cell.
During submission of this work, Coulter et al. reported a similar
investigation on the SOR from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and made the appealing
suggestion that Glu47 might nevertheless participate to the release of the
peroxide by protonation or nucleophilic substitution (27).
The Lys48Ile SOR mutant exhibits a 20-fold smaller second order rate
constant for the reaction with superoxide with regard to the wild-type protein
when measured by steady-state kinetics (Table II). During pulse radiolysis
experiments, two intermediates species were also observed, as in the case of the
wild-type SOR. However, the second order rate constant for the formation of the
first species is 30 times lower than the corresponding value found for the wildtype protein (Table II). This is in line with the value determined from the steadystate kinetics. The reconstituted spectrum of the first intermediate of the

28

Lys48Ile mutant is slightly different from that of the wild-type protein. On the
other hand, the kinetics of the formation of the second intermediate in the case
of the Lys48Ile mutant was comparable to that found with the wild-type SOR
(Table II). The spectrum of the second intermediate is similar to that of the wildtype, except for a smaller extinction coefficient of the absorption band. Once
again, the following steps of the reaction ending up with the formation of the
reaction products, H2O2 and iron (III), could not be observed by our techniques,
and possible effects of the Lys mutation on these steps could not be investigated.
From the data presented here, we can conclude that the Lys48 mutation
greatly affects the rate of the direct reaction of O2.- with the iron center II and
that of the formation of the first intermediate, without notably disturbing the rate
of formation of the second intermediate. It is tempting to suggest that Lys48, the
positively charged residue closest to the iron center II, plays a role in directing
and stabilizing O2.- to the active site, and is then required to allow the very fast
reaction of SOR with superoxide. The physiological importance of Lys48 was
confirmed from the observation that the Lys48Ile sor mutant gene has a very
poor antioxidant protective effect on the sodA sodB recA E. coli mutant strain,
as compared to wild-type and Glu47Ala sor genes. A similar phenotype was
indeed observed when the wild-type sor gene was induced by very low levels of
IPTG, resulting in a low production of SOR wild-type protein ((13) and
unpublished data).

29

Superoxide reductases are exquisite systems for understanding how
biological iron centers deal with superoxide at the molecular level. As a matter
of fact, they are much simpler than superoxide dismutases as O2.- is implicated
in only one step, oxidation of ferrous iron. The work reported here, with the
original observation of reaction intermediates and the investigation of the first
site-directed mutants, provide the foundation of further investigations for a
better understanding of the chemistry of this new class of antioxidant enzymes.
