ABSTRACT
We examine possible sources of a substantial increase in tree ring 14C
measurements for the years AD 774-775. Contrary to claims regarding a coronal
mass ejection (CME), the required CME energy is not several orders of magnitude
greater than known solar events. We consider solar proton events (SPEs) with
three different fluences and two different spectra. The data may be explained by
an event with fluence about one order of magnitude beyond the October 1989 SPE.
Two hard spectrum cases considered here result in moderate ozone depletion, so
no mass extinction is implied, though we do predict increases in erythema and
damage to plants from enhanced solar UV. We are able to rule out an event with a
very soft spectrum that causes severe ozone depletion and subsequent biological
impacts. Nitrate enhancements are consistent with their apparent absence in ice
core data. The modern technological implications of such an event may be extreme,
and considering recent confirmation of superflares on solar-type stars, this issue
merits attention.

1. Introduction
Miyake et al [2012] found that tree ring data imply a strong increase in the rate of
production of 14C during AD 774-775. They put it in the context of supernovae and
solar proton events. We extend that consideration here. Additional candidate extrasolar
events lie within the class of unidentified or poorly-understood high-energy transients
[Gehrels and Cannizzo, 2012], some of which made measurable modifications to the
ionization state of the Earth’s atmosphere. A short gamma-ray burst (hereafter GRB)
may have provided the source, but the probability of an event with the terrestrial fluence
as estimated by Miyake et al. [2012] is about 10-7 y-1 [Melott and Thomas, 2011], so the
probability of an event in the last 1250 years is about 10-4 [Melott and Thomas, 2012].
Hambaryan and Neuhaeuser [2013] emphasize uncertainties in the short-burst GRB rate
estimates. Eichler and Mordecai [2013] suggest a solar comet impact, but without
questioning the Miyake energy scaling, which we have argued is unnecessary and
unlikely [Melott and Thomas, 2012].
Miyake et al. [2012] concluded that a recent supernova near enough to produce
this effect should have left a conspicuous remnant. We agree. They further argued that
the energy implied for a solar proton event (SPE) was many orders of magnitude
beyond anything known on the Sun [Schaeffer, 2012], and therefore implausible. We
disagree.
The scaling from the SPE to the CME energy in Miyake et al. [2012] was
incorrect [Melott and Thomas, 2012]. They assumed CMEs propagated isotropically,
but they are primarily confined to opening angles of 24° to 72° [Bothmer and Zhukov,
2007], with smaller angles much more common [Schrijver, 2010]. The few wide angle
CMEs are much less likely (per steradian) to produce an SPE [Park et al., 2012],
suggesting considerably lower fluences. Such “global” CMEs are rare, and account for
many fewer SPEs than implied by their angular coverage. The largest observed SPEs
have not corresponded to wide angle CMEs. Assuming 0.1 steradian, the implied CME
energy is reduced below the Miyake et al. [2012] estimate by two orders of magnitude
to about 2 x 1026 J. The energy deposition at the Earth estimated by Miyake et al. [2012]
in 30 MeV units and divided by the surface area is 3 x 1011 protons cm-2, about 71 times
the fluence of the October 1989 SPE [McCracken et al., 2001], one of the most intense
SPEs in modern times.
Usoskin and Kovaltsov [2012] estimated the fluence of the 774 AD event to be
about 3 x 1010 protons cm-2, assuming a spectrum associated with the extremely hard
1956 SPE. This is about 30 times their estimate of the time-averaged annual solar
energetic particle fluence. Their substantial differences with Miyake et al. [2012] on the
estimated fluence are based on the choice of fitting spectrum—one is soft, the other
very hard. They state that a soft spectrum like that of the August 1972 SPE may have a
fluence 40 times greater than their 1956 (extremely hard) spectrum taken as a standard

in order to produce the same 14C increase. As there is no independent data on pre-space
era events, we will deal with this uncertainty by conducting simulations of atmospheric
affects using the October 1989 SPE spectrum with two different E > 30 MeV proton
fluence values, as well as a third fluence case using the August 1972 SPE spectrum.
The October 1989 spectrum is relatively hard, but lies between the very soft 1972 SPE
and the very hard 1956 SPE.

Be enhancements may also be expected. However, they are strongly
precipitation dependent, possibly connected more to local weather than to atmospheric
concentrations, and reliably correlated with 14C only for centennial scale variation
[Finkel and Nishiizumi 1997]. Transport to Greenland and the Antarctic are
fundamentally different, and peak at different times of year [Pedro et al. 2011a],
possibly only reflecting cosmic ray activity in the previous 10 months [Pedro et al.
2011b]. They also show extreme geographic variability [Berggren et al. 2012] and are
therefore suspect as compared with 14C. Beer et al. [2012] show that they are useful and
reliable for enhancements which arise on a timescale of 10 years or longer, which is not
useful for SPEs or possible enhancement from a comet impact [Overholt and Melott,
manuscript in preparation, 2012].
2. SPE and stellar flare event rates
The probability of such an event can be studied using the statistics of rare events
[Love, 2012]. Using the 774 AD event as an example, we must ask when such events
occurred earlier. Usoskin and Kovaltsov [2012] argue based on the 14C record that there
were no such events for 11,000 years. We are primarily interested in the fluence for
purposes of atmospheric ionization, and as noted by them, a softer (1972) type spectrum
with the same fluence would deposit 40 times less 14C. Therefore we regard constraints
on earlier possible events as not very reliable. The best we can do is use the frequency
of events that show up in the 14C record, and then compare it with best-estimates from a
variety of terrestrial radionuclides [Schrijver et al. 2012] and stellar [Maehara et al.
2012] records. Love [2012] uses both Bayesian and conventional frequentist statistics to
derive rate probabilities and their uncertainties from rare or even single events. The two
methods give nearly identical results, and the primary effect of small numbers of events
is, as expected, larger uncertainty in the rate estimates. Assuming only the information
that there was just one such event within ~1250 years, 1σ confidence intervals on the
mean rate lie from 2 x 10-4 yr-1 to 1.8 x 10-3 yr-1. Using the best estimate of the mean
rate of such an event, 8 x 10-4 yr-1, the probability of such an event within the next
decade is 0.8%, which may be considered as small. However, this is insufficiently small
for safety in view of such a threatening event. We note that probabilities based on
Usoskin and Kovaltsov [2012] would be about an order of magnitude lower, but these
would be probabilities of equivalent 14C production, not of equivalent proton fluence.

Schrijver et al. [2012] recently evaluated the frequency of extremely energetic
solar events from a variety of records. We find that the event rates and energetics we
propose here are consistent with their CME and flare energy rates and proposed
extrapolations in their Figures 2 and 3.
We can also compare our results with newly available estimates of the rate of
flares on solar-type stars. There is a rough correlation with a great deal of scatter
between flare energy and SPE energy. Maehara et al. [2012] use bolometric luminosity
(visible light for G-type main sequence stars), to estimate the rate of occurrence for
superflares (E > 3 x 1026 J) for slowly rotating (T > 10 d) stars with surface
temperatures close to that of the Sun to be 2.9 x 10-3 yr-1. This is greater than the rate we
estimate, but within 2σ of it. However, they estimate their detection efficiency to be
impaired at this, the lower bound of their detectable flare energy, implying a likely rate
much larger than we estimate above. They suggest a rate power-law for these higherenergy events of order E-2, which is slightly steeper than that for lower-energy Solar
flares. Their observations support no role for “hot Jupiters” in triggering the observed
events, so the Sun remains a candidate for superflares similar to those observed on other
G-type main sequence stars. Extrapolating their rates to high energies suggests moderate
extinction events (see below) every million years or so.
3. A possible eighth century event in context
Solar flares are emission of photons, usually including and up through X-ray
energies. They are often associated with CMEs, but it is possible to have each without
the other [e.g. Gosling 1993]. In recent large events the total of magnetic, kinetic, and
total radiated energy is on average a bit more than twice the kinetic energy [Emslie et al.
2004, 2005, 2012], so that flare energies are typically roughly comparable to CME
proton energies. For the proposed AD 774-775 event, our corrected scaling from the
Miyake et al. [2012] fluence estimates implies that the proposed CME energy is within
the lower range of flare energies for solar-type stars [Schaeffer et al., 2000; Maehara et
al., 2012], which ranges from 1026-1033 J. Usoskin and Kovaltsov [2012] made a lower
estimate using the 1956 event, an extreme outlier with a hard spectrum. Clearly there
are sunlike stars with energy available to push CMEs many orders of magnitude beyond
that implied for an AD 774-775 event. Given the poor constraints on the rates of such
events at the Sun [Melott and Thomas, 2011; Reedy, 1996], it would be wise to consider
the possibility. An event significantly more energetic than that of 1989 would be a
disaster for electromagnetic technology [NRC Space Studies Board, 2008], causing
widespread damage to satellites as well as transformers linking the power grid.
4. The SPE threat in view of the data

We have emphasized the hazard to our electromagnetic technological
infrastructure. Here we consider effects on the biota. Atmospheric ionization by
charged particles makes possible large increases in stratospheric NOx (N, NO, NO2),
which depletes ozone and allows increases in the dangerous solar UVB that reaches the
ground [Thomas et al., 2007; Ejzak et al., 2007]. Miyake et al. [2012] argue against the
superflare hypothesis by noting that there was no mass extinction at that time.
We now provide information to assess the biological consequences by computing
the changes in atmospheric chemistry induced by the irradiation implied by their 14C
computations. We used the Goddard Space Flight Center two-dimensional (latitude,
altitude) time-dependent atmospheric model that has been used extensively to model the
effects of solar flares, as well as supernovae and GRB burst effects. Space constraints
forbid a full description, but extensive accounts are given elsewhere [Thomas et al.
2005, 2007; Ejzak et al. 2007]. Atmospheric ionization is computed following methods
described in Thomas et al. [2005], Rodger et al. [2008], Verronen et al. [2005], and
Jackman et al. [1980]. All proton fluences discussed below are for 30 MeV < E < 500
MeV. The ionization method used here becomes inaccurate below an altitude of about
20 km. However, we are interested primarily in changes in total column density O3, so
this is not a major uncertainty for the results presented here.
We have modelled three SPE cases. For two cases we use the relatively hard
spectrum associated with the SPE of 19 October 1989 [Rodger et al. 2008]. Usoskin
and Kovaltsov [2012] infer a fluence of 3 x 1010 protons cm-2 for the extremely hard
1956 SPE spectrum. We use this fluence as a lower bound, since the 1989 spectrum is
not as hard and a higher fluence is required to get the same radiocarbon yield. As a
second case we use the 1989 spectrum with a fluence of 3 x 1011 protons cm-2; this
corresponds to our estimate based on Miyake et al. [2012]. Finally, Usoskin and
Kovaltsov [2012] state that for a soft spectrum such as that associated with the 4 August
1972 SPE, the fluence should be about 1.2 x 1012 protons cm-2 (40 times their estimated
fluence given a 1956 SPE spectrum). We therefore take this as a third case. The
October 1989 SPE is one of the most intense on record, and the measured E > 30 MeV
proton fluence is 4.2 x 109 [McCracken et al., 2001]. Our three modelled cases
correspond to 7.1, 71, and 285 times this 1989 fluence.
Figure 1 shows the globally averaged % change (comparing simulation runs with
and without additional ionization input) in O3 column density for the three SPE cases
described above. We find maximum globally averaged depletions of 5%, 22% and 32%
for the 1989-spectrum cases with fluence of 3 x 1010 and 3 x 1011 protons cm-2, and the
1972-spectrum case with fluence 1.2 x 1012 protons cm-2, respectively. In Melott and
Thomas [2012] we considered the case of a short GRB and reported a maximum
globally averaged O3 depletion of about 10%, which is intermediate between the two

lower fluence SPE cases considered here. For comparison, current anthropogenic
globally averaged depletion is about 3-5%.
In order to quantify surface-level impacts of UV under the ozone-depleted
atmosphere we have used version 4.6 of the publically available Tropospheric
Ultraviolet and Visible (TUV) atmospheric radiative transfer model, downloaded from
http://cprm.acd.ucar.edu/Models/TUV/ [Madronich and Flocke, 1997]. Here we report
computed values at 55° North latitude. We find a maximum increase in UVB irradiance
of about 30% for the low-fluence case, 160% for the mid-fluence case, and 317% for
the high-fluence (soft spectrum) case. These values correspond to maximum increases
in erythema (skin damage due to solar UV) of 14%, 87%, and 160%, respectively.
Some research [e.g. Björn et al. 1996] has been done on UVB effects to land plants, and
suggests possible disruption to plant growth and to interactions within ecosystems, but
suggests that at least for current anthropogenic levels of depletion, agriculture should
not be strongly impacted. We have used a weighting function [Flint and Caldwell
2003] to compute UVB damage to terrestrial plants and find maximum increases at 55°
North latitude of 2%, 14%, and 25%, respectively.
For the two lower fluence (hard spectrum) cases, these results suggest mild to
moderate effects on the biota: some reduction of primary photosynthesis in the oceans
and probably with land plants, increased risk of erythema and skin cancer [Sweet et al.,
2012], but no major mass-extinction level effects as implied by Miyake et al. [2012].
However, our results for a fluence of 1.2 x 1012 protons cm-2 with the soft August 1972
spectrum imply severe damage to the biosphere. Given the lack of historical evidence
for such damage, we can rule out such a high fluence that would be associated with a
soft-spectrum event.
The main mechanism of recovery of the atmosphere following an ionization event
is by incorporation of NOx into water (forming nitric acid) that is then rained or snowed
out, usually deposited in ice cores. More details on our modelling of nitrate deposition
can be found in Melott et al. [2005] and Thomas et al. [2007]. We have examined the
GISP2 [Mayewski et al. 1997] ice core data, and find no large nitrate enhancements
within 50 yr of their dating to 775. However, this data has a sampling interval of about
2.5 yr at the time in question, so that any period of nitrate enhancement may have been
missed. That question aside, this observation is consistent with our modelling, which
predicts only about 2% enhancement in nitrate deposition at maximum, which would be
down in the noise. Our conclusion using nitrate deposition combined with the 14C data
(and previous GRB work [Melott and Thomas, 2012]) is that the event is consistent with
either an SPE or a GRB in A.D. 774-775.
5. Discussion

There are at least three possible astrophysical sources for the observed 8th century
14
C enhancement. First, a galactic GRB could be sufficiently distant, but still provide
the necessary irradiation, so that its remnant might not have been observed. However,
the a priori probability is quite small [Melott and Thomas, 2011, 2012; Hambaryan and
Neuhaeuser, 2013]. We cannot evaluate the probability of a solar comet impact
[Eichler and Mordecai 2013].
Data on the rates of CMEs with energy an order of magnitude or more greater
than modern events such as October 1989 are lacking, and without spectral data to
establish any firm pattern of fluences, but our energy estimates are consistent with the
estimates and extrapolations of Schrijver et al. [2012] for events that occur every ~1000
years. It is consistent (and even possibly somewhat low) compared with recent
observations of solar-type stars. Our simulations assuming a relatively hard spectrum
and fluences consistent with estimates from Miyake et al. [2012] and Usoskin and
Kovaltsov [2012] show moderate ozone depletion, which would have some deleterious
effects on the biota for a few years, but is not a mass extinction level event. The soft
spectrum case can be ruled out due to much more intense ozone depletion and
subsequent biological impact. This conclusion regarding spectral hardness is in
agreement with conclusions based on cosmogenic isotope production from Miyake et al.
[2012], as well as Hambaryan and Neuhaeuser [2013] (who considered the case of a
GRB). The enhancement to atmospheric nitrate deposition is small, consistent with its
non-observation in the GISP2 ice core for the time period in question. The SPE appears
to be the more reasonable possibility, which demands further exploration of a potential
massive threat to modern civilization.
