The paper uses mesoscopic, non-linear lattice dynamics based (Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois, PBD)
modeling to describe thermal properties of DNA below and near the denaturation temperature.
Computationally efficient notation is introduced for the relevant statistical mechanics. Computed
melting profiles of long and short heterogeneous sequences are presented, using a recently introduced
reparametrization of the PBD model, and critically discussed. The statistics of extended open
bubbles and bound clusters is formulated and results are presented for selected examples.
Keywords: DNA melting; denaturation bubbles; Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model

1. Introduction
Thermal denaturation, i.e. separation of the two strands as a result of heating, is one of the
oldest established physico-chemical results pertaining to the DNA molecule. The “melting”of DNA was first observed [1] very soon after the determination of the double helical structure. Theoretical descriptions in the sixties, proposed by Poland and Scheraga (PS) [2, 3],
largely based on the concept of the helix-coil transition [4], were subsequently refined and
developed in considerable detail, incorporating known enthalpic data on controlled oligomer
thermodynamics and, when combined with appropriate software, can claim significant predictive power in regard to actual experimental melting profiles [5,6]. Helix-coil models adopt
a mesoscopic description of DNA, describing the open (coil) or closed (helix) state of an individual base pair in terms of a discrete, Ising-type variable. By virtue of their construction
they cannot describe any dynamic phenomena.
An interesting alternative was proposed two decades ago by Peyrard, Bishop and Dauxois (PBD) [7, 8]. In accordance with contemporary soft mode concepts related to structural
phase transitions, they attempted a reduced, also mesoscopic, lattice-dynamics motivated
description of the double helix. In their case, the relevant degree of freedom is a transverse
displacement which represents how far an individual base pair is from equilibrium. This is
locally determined by a nonlinear (typically Morse-like) potential which accounts for the
effective hydrogen bonding linking bases together. The motion of neighboring base pairs
is coupled in a way which favors double-helical ordering (DNA stacking interaction). As it
turns out, this minimal nonlinear lattice-dynamics (also proposed in the context of wetting
phenomena [9]) generates one of the simplest known one-dimensional models with shortrange interactions which exhibit an exact phase transition in the thermodynamic limit.

The PBD model of DNA does more than a “demonstration of principle” regarding the
denaturation transition. As shown by Cule and Hwa [10] the randomness introduced by basepair heterogeneity results in a structured rounding of the transition (multistep melting) in
qualitative accordance with experimental observation. Recently, using improved computational methods and a new, global set of model parameters, it has been possible to compute
detailed, multipeak melting profiles of long DNA chains using only sequence information and
salt concentration as input; although further parameter optimization is probably needed,
agreement with experiment is impressive [11]. The model has also been used to calculate
neutron scattering structure factors, also in very good agreement with recent experimental
results [12]. Furthermore, as will be noted in this work, the low-frequency optical phonons of
the model are in the range where Raman spectroscopy has located some vibrational activity
in DNA [13].
Important issues remain open. One of the key advantages of the PBD approach is its
potential ability to describe local openings (“denaturation bubbles”) of the double helix,
such as those known to occur during the initial stage of the transription process. The relatively slow dynamics involved in these events would be consistent with the coarse graining
implicit in the model. Bubble statistics has been extensively studied in the framework of the
PBD model, and some specific correlation with transcription initiation sites has in fact been
claimed [14] and debated [15, 16]. On a more modest - and yet quite fundamental - level,
the formation of a single bubble has been observed by studying the melting of specially
designed oligomers [17]. As the results reported here will show, although the process and its
rough temperature dependence are correctly accounted for by the PBD model, important
details, notably the asymmetric biphasic character of the profile, are missing. This may be
due to the fact that the global parameter set used in PBD modeling is either (i) not yet
fully optimized or (ii) lacking in detail, e.g. in not taking proper account of the variations
in stacking interaction between different sets of neighboring base pairs.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the model and introduces system parameters to be used. Section 3 presents thermodynamics, including some necessary
background material, and focuses on (i) issues related to finite chains and (ii) heterogeneity.
Section 4 presents computed melting profiles for both long and short chains and compares
theoretical vs. experimental results. Section 5 discusses the statistical properties of extended
objects, i.e. bubbles and clusters consisting, respectively, of consecutive open and bound
base pairs. Section 6 summarizes results and perspectives.
2. Model, Notation, Parameters
I will use the version of the PBD model proposed in [8]. The total potential energy of a
chain of N base pairs can be represented as a sum of local and nonlocal contributions

models the nonlinear base-stacking interaction. The parameter k describes the strength of
the linear stacking interaction, i.e. the “residual stacking” which characterizes the disordered
state. Most of the stacking energy which favors values yj ∼ yj+1 ∼ 0 comes from the
nonlinear term which is parametrized by its dimensionless strength ρ and its range 1/b.
In view of the very large ratio of double-stranded and single-stranded DNA persistence
lengths [18], a value of ρ = 50 appears reasonable. A stacking interaction range 1/b = 5A
is consistent with the double helical geometry (diameter 21A). The other parameters are
the depth Dj and the range 1/αj of the Morse potential. This work follows the choice of
parameters made in [11], i.e. k = 0.45 meV/A2 , αGC = 6.9A−1 , αAT = 4.2A−1 and

where c is the molar salt concentration. It may be noted that although these particular
parameters were derived by fitting melting profiles, the resulting optical frequencies (with
an effective mass per site equal to 618 amu) are about 83 cm−1 for GT and 44 cm−1 for AT.
These values compare favorably with the results of low-frequency Raman spectroscopy [13]
which identify a broad band below 85 cm−1 .
3. Thermodynamics
3.1. Definitions
The thermodynamics of the model (2.1) is determined by the interplay between the elastic
interaction and the Morse potential. At low temperatures, the displacements {yn } oscillate
around the minima of the Morse potential, yn = 0; phonon spectra have a gap. At high
temperatures displacements are large, oscillations occur on the flat top of the Morse potential, phonons are essentially gapless. As a result, thermodynamic properties are those of
the harmonic chain. The classical partition function develops an infrared divergence, due
to contributions from long-wavelength phonons. Some consequences of this divergence are
fairly trivial, e.g. the emergence of a divergent temperature-independent, entropic contribution. Others, in particular when it comes to oligomers, are critical. In order to keep proper
track of this divergence, I will introduce the size of the allowed phase space L explicitly.
The classical partition function of an open-ended chain with N base pairs is thus defined
by
ZN (L) =

where β = 1/(kB T ), kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the system temperature. Note
that, because of the repulsive core of the Morse potential, contributions to the partition

4

function for negative displacements decay quite rapidly. Thus, even though numerical computations always involve a lower cutoff ymin of the integrations, if the cutoff is appropriately
chosen, the values of the integrals remain practically independent of the particular value of
that cutoff.
A quantity which is of direct experimental interest is the fraction of bound (or, respectively, open) pairs. The microscopic average which is necessary to compute this is the
probability that the nth base pair is bound, i.e.
pn =

unity. Fig. 1 shows the numerically calculated lowest eigenvalues for different values of L.
The discretization of the integral equation was performed using Gauss-Legendre quadratures
in the interval (ymin = −1.5A, L), where L varies between 100 and 400 A and the density
of the mesh has been kept constant at 4 points per A. The figure provides a numerical
illustration of the existence of a well defined limit L → ∞ of the integral equation (3.4).
Note in particular the rapid (quadratic) convergence of the successive numerical estimates
of the critical temperatures to the limiting value.

the result of a numerical calculation performed with a cutoff and on a grid.

The above form is useful because it illustrates important limiting behavior.
3.2.3. The infinite chain
In the thermodynamic limit, N → ∞, terms of order 1/N in (3.7) vanish. This kills all
infrared-divergent terms and leaves only the contribution from the highest eigenvalue; for

6

N. Theodorakopoulos

that contribution however, the limit L → ∞ exists (Fig. 1). The singularity of the spectrum of (3.4) where the bound state merges into the continuum generates an infrared-free
singularity of the thermodynamic properties of the infinite chain. The question of the order
of the transition has been extensively discussed in the literature. The dichotomy between
apparent (first-order) and exact limiting (continuous) behavior has been presented in some
detail in the case of the helicoidal version of the PBD model [19]. The distinction is generic
and applies to the model used here as well.
3.2.4. The finite chain
Fig. 2 (left panel) shows numerical results for the free energy per site in the case N = 20.
The transition is much more rounded, as would be expected from finite-size corrections.
Moreover, the infrared divergent terms are significant on a visible scale. The concomitant
effect on the melting profile can be seen on the right panel. There is no sign of convergence
of the melting curve; as the inset indicates, the sequence of effective melting temperatures
cannot be used in a straightforward way to produce a limit.

variety of upper cutoffs L. The right panel shows the melting fractions for N=20 and varying L; the inset
illustrates the dependence of the critical temperature (estimated by the peak in the temperature derivative
of the melting curve) on the cutoff L.

3.2.5. The long chain
The difficulties encountered in the previous section would encourage the following “fundamentalist”argument regarding melting of any finite chains: since, for any finite N , the

Bubbles, clusters and denaturation in genomic DNA

7

integral in (3.2) remains finite in the limit L → ∞, whereas the partition function diverges,
pn should vanish at any nonzero temperature; it would follow that θ = 1 for any T > 0.
How watertight is this formally correct “proof”?
In order to make this quantitative, let me go back to the free energy function. Suppose
I would like the finite-size, infrared divergent corrections (cf. Fig. 2) to remain very small,
e.g.
1
ln L < ǫ
N

,

(3.8)

where ǫ is some small number. On the other hand, one must note that the L’s used are not
entirely arbitrary. L must be large enough to ensure proper convergence of the TI equation
(3.4). For the set of parameters used here, it seems that values between 300 and 400 A
should be sufficient. One may then argue that if, in addition, (3.8) holds, the thermodynamic
properties of the finite chain with values of L in this order will be numerically stable, i.e. Lindependent. What might happen at “astronomic”values of L can have no practical bearing
to DNA melting.
A typical choice of ǫ = 0.01 and L = 400 A suggests that N > 600 is a long enough chain
to produce such numerically stable melting profiles within the PBD model. Interestingly, this
is in line with what model-independent estimates based on analyzing melting temperatures
of natural DNA classify as the limit of a long chain. This may however be too conservative
a choice when it comes to PBD model considered here. Fig. 3 shows that for N = 100 the
melting profiles are numerically stable in the sense described above and produce a linearly
convergent sequence of melting temperatures.
3.2.6. The double-stranded ensemble
It is possible to define an infrared divergence-free thermodynamic average quantity by considering the conditional probability of any base pair being open, subject to the condition that
the strands are not totally separated [20]. The use of such a “double stranded ensemble”is
standard procedure in analyzing DNA melting profiles of oligomers in terms of statistical
(Poland-Scheraga type) models, because there the theory is entirely formulated in terms
of this conditional probability (internal melting fraction). The probability of fulfilling this
condition (external melting fraction), which is necessary in order to analyze experimental
data, must then be obtained or estimated by other means. Within the PBD formalism
the internal melting fraction can be calculated by first considering the (infrared-divergent)
statistical weight corresponding to “total melting”, i.e. [20].

I will return to a constructive use of the double-stranded ensemble in Section 4.2.
3.3. Thermodynamics of the heterogeneous case
3.3.1. From multiple integrations to matrix products
In the absence of translational invariance the partition function (3.1) must be calculated
directly as an N -dimensional integral; to do this in real-space, with a typical mesh of 1201
points (which is what acceptable numerics demands, corresponding to an L = 300 A) is an
almost impossible task for N > 100. This is not just a matter of computing time, but also
of maintaining numerical accuracy.

A useful alternative is to exploit the eigenfunction expansion of the reference (AT) kernel

3.3.2. Further improvements in computational efficiency
Computing pn for all sites involves heavy duplication of matrix multiplications. It is computationally much more efficient to define, compute and store intermediate results in vector
form. Moreover, it is necessary to renormalize vectors to unity at every stage of a matrixvector multiplication. The latter procedure minimizes numerical error because it keeps computed scalar products in the order of unity.
Let the unit vectors at the ends be defined via
1
|v(1) > = R |A(N ) >
(3.18)
µ1
1
< u(1) | = < A(1) | L
(3.19)

where the µ’s are the norms of the respective unnormalized vectors. I then store the result
of each successive matrix-vector multiplication in vector form, as a unit vector and a norm,
i.e.

Computing and storing the necessary intermediates for a melting profile of a chain with N
base pairs in vector form is a process with O(N ) computational steps.
4. Computed melting profiles
4.1. Long chains
The procedure described in the previous sections has been used [11] to compute melting
profiles of large genomic sequences. As an example I show in Fig. 5 the melting profile of
the T7 phage, a sequence of 39937 base pairs with a 48.4% GC content. The experimental
data from [21] is also included for comparison. Note that the depths of the Morse wells have
been fitted to the data; in fact, this is one of the two sets of data which were used in [11]
to derive the parameters entering Eqs. (2.3).
In order to relate melting profiles to sequence details, it is customary to draw a melting
map, in which each site is characterized by its melting temperature, defined via pi (Tm (i) =
1/2. The melting map for the T7 phage is shown in the right panel of Fig. 5, along with
the moving 200-pt average of local GC-content.

based on the PBD model, the dashed curves experimental results redrawn from [21]. Right panel: the melting
map (left y-scale), 200-site moving average of GC content (right y-scale). The inset shows a zoomed region
of the melting map.

Two comments are in order here. First the obvious. Genomic heterogeneity destroys the
sharp first order transition characteristic of the homogeneous PBD model (and of actual
melting profiles of long polynucleotide chains). Remnants of multistep melting can be seen
in the inset of Fig. 5, which suggests melting of 200-bp chunks. This is in general accord with

12

N. Theodorakopoulos

theoretical expectations on the effect of disorder on phase transitions (reduction of effective
dimensionality, hence enhancement of the role of fluctuations, rounding of an incipient
transition). On the other hand, in an interesting analysis of the effects of heterogeneity
within the PBD model context, it has been argued [10] that multistep behavior should be
self-averaging, albeit with a large crossover length. I have not detected any systematic signs
of self-averaging, even in genomic sequences of much larger lengths than the one presented
here.
The second comment concerns the change in entropy. The left panel of Fig. 5 shows
the dependence of the entropy derivative on temperature (right y-scale). The curve is
almost perfectly superimposed on the melting profile. The total entropy change, 4.4kB
per base pair, is considerable smaller than the typical experimental values [6] of 12kB (24
cal/mol/bp/K), but represents a considerable improvement from the 1kB obtained using
previous parametrizations [22] of the PBD model.

4.2. Short chains
An interesting example of a short chain is the L48AS sequence, which exhibits biphasic
melting behavior at c = 50mM salt concentration [17]. Fig. 6 shows the (L-dependent)
melting curves in the left panel. The curves were obtained using Morse potential depths
according to (2.3). The extracted sequence of melting temperatures (inset, left panel) is
regular. Melting behavior is of the single-phase type. This disagrees with experimentally
observed behavior, which is not surprising; it should be quite clear that physical separations
of the two DNA strands of the order of 300 − 400 A should be totally irrelevant to the study
a fluctuating 48-bp molecule (which has a total length of 170 A).
The obvious alternative within the context of the PBD model is the double-stranded
ensemble (cf. 3.2.6). Melting profiles are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 6; they are
practically L-independent. In the same panel I have included an estimate (dotted curve)
which mimics the experimentally observed θext [17], in terms of relative temperature position
and width. Making use of this estimate it is possible to calculate the total melting profile,
which does indeed exhibit biphasic behavior. The differential melting curve is shown in the
right panel, along with the corresponding experimental results of Ref. [17].
In spite of this qualitative agreement, there are still considerable problems with the
theoretical description of this exemplary case of biphasic melting in DNA oligomers. First,
the predicted peaks in the melting profiles lie more than 10 degrees higher than the experimentally observed ones. Second, the predicted biphasic behavior is of the wrong type, i.e.
melting accelerates at higher temperatures (rather than slowing down, as experimentally
observed). This may well signal a fundamental difficulty of describing oligomer melting
behavior in terms of the PBD model.

bubble of length k at site n is (cf. (3.17))
Q(n|k) =

< A(1) |B(2) · · · B(n−k) B̃ (n−k+1) · · · B̃ (n) B(n+1) · · · B(N −1) |A(N ) >
< A(1) |B(2) · · · B(N −1) |A(N ) >

,

(5.1)

where B̃ (n) is the complement of B (n) , i.e.
B̃ (n) = B(n) − B (n)

(5.2)

and n = k + 1, · · · , N − 1, i.e. this is a backward-counted, “internal” bubble. In terms of
the stored unit vectors and norms of section 3.3, this can be rewritten in the form
Q(n|k) =

< u(n−k) |B̃ (n−k+1) · · · B̃ (n) |v(N −j) >

< u(n) |v(N −n) >

(5.3)

Note that a strict definition of a bubble should include the demand that the enclosing sites
n − k and n + 1 should be occupied by bound base pairs. The probability for this to occur
will be
Q̂(n|k) = Q(n|k) − Q(n + 1|k + 1) − Q(n|k + 1) + Q(n + 1|k + 2)
For very long chains, it is possible to average over all sites (N ′ < N to exclude boundaries)
and obtain the site-averaged probability
Qk =

1 X
Q̂(n|k)
N′ n

Fig. 7. A schematic view of the bubble size probability distribution. Starting at the nth site (bound base
pair, upward pointing arrow), all possible sequences to the left of n are shown. Either there is no bubble (no
downward pointing arrows), or the bubble terminates after 1, 2, · · · k sites. Since the list is exhaustive, the
sum of all probabilities must equal the probability of the nth site being in the bound state. Similarly, if the
first row is excluded, the sum of all remaining probabilities must equal the joint probability of the nth site
being in the bound and the (n − 1)st in the unbound state (flip density).

In fact, as the figure suggests, the sum rule is valid also for the non-averaged probabilities,
i.e.
∞

Q̂(n|k) = pn

(5.6)

since the sequences shown exhaust all configurations in which the nth base pair is bound
(“up”).
Another quantity of interest is the density of neighboring bound / unbound pairs (spin
flips). Going back to Fig. 7 it is straightforward to identify the flip density - which, owing
to the topology of the one-dimensional chain, is equal to the average bubble density - with
∞

Qk = 1 − θ − Q0 ,

(5.7)

where Q0 is the joint probability of two successive sites being in the bound state (the
zero-size bubble).

Noting that the product of average bubble size and density is just the fraction of open
base pairs leads to a second sum rule,

k=1

The above sum rules (5.5) and (5.9) represent exact properties of the infinite chain.
They have been explicitly verified in the homogeneous case [23]. Moreover, since (5.5) can
be derived by finite-averaging of (5.6) it will hold exactly for finite, heterogeneous sequences.
(5.9) is expected to hold for a long heterogeneous sequence, provided that average bubble
number and size allow for meaningful statistics.
As an example of (non-averaged) site bubble distribution in genomic DNA, Q̂(n|10)
has been calculated in the case of the T7 phage and is shown in Fig. 8. Note that the
probability of 10-site bubble occurrence can be substantial, i.e. only slightly smaller than
the probability of single base-pair opening (estimated to be in the order of 1 ppm by imino
proton exchange measurements [24]). Clearly, this can only happen in AT-rich regions. The
figure includes known [25] promoter sites for (a very qualitative and at the present stage
by no means systematic) comparison.
5.2. Double-stranded clusters
Equivalently, one may define the probability of a number of successive base pairs being in
the bound state. Such a k-size double-stranded cluster (in brief: cluster) ending on the nth
site, and surrounded by open base pairs at the ends, would be associated with a probability
P̂(n|k) = P(n|k) − P(n + 1|k + 1) − P(n|k + 1) + P(n + 1|k + 2)
where
P(n|k) =

< u(n−k) |B (n−k+1) · · · B (n) |v(N −j) >
L
< u(n) |v(N −n) >
µL

.

(5.10)

and all the arguments of the previous subsection related to bubbles apply mutatis mutandis
to clusters. Again, for long genomic sequences, one may perform a site average and obtain
the probability of occurrence of a k-size cluster anywhere along the chain,
1 X
Pk = ′
P̂(n|k) .

Fig. 8. Probability of occurrence of 10-site bubble in the T7-phage. The circles denote published promoter
sites [25].

Note that the latter sum includes a quantity P0 which is the (unconditional) probability of
two successive sites being in the open state (the zero-size cluster).
The average size of a cluster is
ξc =

1−θ
θ − P0

.

(5.13)

The quantity θ − P0 expresses the probability of finding an open base pair, followed by a
closed base pair. Similarly, the quantity 1 − θ − Q0 is equal to the probability of finding a
closed base pair, followed by an open base pair. These “flip” probabilities must be equal:
1 − θ − Q0 = θ − P0

;

(5.14)

furthermore, the average length of a combined cluster and the bubble which follows it, is,
from (5.8) and (5.13),
ξc + ξb =

1
θ − P0

,

(5.15)

i.e. θ − P0 = 1 − θ − Q0 expresses the number density of bubbles and/or clusters.
Site-averaged probabilities of cluster occurrence are important in understanding experiments performed with macroscopic samples of genomic DNA, e.g. neutron or X-ray scattering. Fig 9 shows typical behavior of Pn as a function of n for a variety of temperatures.

The sequence used was that of the T 7 phage. Note the strictly exponential behavior. The
slope increases as one approaches melting - and beyond -. Absolute probabilities increase
slightly with increasing temperature in the ordered phase since, according to the definition
of a strict cluster, it must be surrounded by open sites. Table 1 provides a quantitative test
of the averaging process in terms of the sum rules (5.12). Summation beyond the explicitly
calculated values (k = 112) has been extended to infinity using the numerically determined
slopes.

6. Conclusions and Outlook
Mesoscopic lattice-dynamics modeling of DNA has been described in this paper as a powerful tool for the description of thermal properties. In particular, it has been shown that
efficient computational techniques can be used to calculate melting profiles of very long
genomic sequences. The resulting - not yet fully optimized - parametrization is in (full or
at least partial) accord with results from other independent measurements, e.g. stiffness,
Raman spectroscopy, calorimetry, neutron diffraction. On the basis of these findings, it
appears that further work is needed in at least three directions. First, a full-scale optimization of model parameters should be undertaken, involving a significantly larger amount of
melting data on long chains. Second, an effort should be made to include the computationally intensive, physically important effect of heterogeneous stacking [26, 27] on bubbles
in long genomic chains . Third - not necessarily independent of the other two - would be
to achieve an improved understanding of the collective (static and dynamic) properties of
specially designed oligomers.
