Abstract
Dengue is one of the major international public health concerns. Although progress
is underway, developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging. Thus, the main
approach to fight the disease is vector control. A model for the transmission of Dengue
disease is presented. It consists of eight mutually exclusive compartments representing
the human and vector dynamics. It also includes a control parameter (insecticide) in
order to fight the mosquito. The model presents three possible equilibria: two diseasefree equilibria (DFE) and another endemic equilibrium. It has been proved that a
DFE is locally asymptotically stable, whenever a certain epidemiological threshold,
known as the basic reproduction number, is less than one. We show that if we apply a
minimum level of insecticide, it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction number
below unity. A case study, using data of the outbreak that occurred in 2009 in Cape
Verde, is presented.

Introduction

The first recognized Dengue epidemic occurred almost simultaneously in Asia,
Africa and North America in the 1780s, shortly after the identification and
naming of the disease in 1779. It has spread especially in the tropical and
subtropical regions around the world, and nowadays is a disease widely found
in urban and semi-urban areas.
According to the World Health Organization, 50 to 100 million Dengue infections occur yearly, including 500,000 Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever cases and
22000 deaths, mostly among children [27]. Growing awareness of global climate
change has stimulated several assessments of its likely effects on vector-borne
disease as well as on health outcomes. Some of these studies have indicated that
countries with a mild climate, such as in the Mediterranean, are at risk due to
future climate conditions that may be favourable to this kind of disease [13].
This risk may be aggravated further due to the volume of international tourism
and trade that this region experiences [20, 23]. Travellers play an essential role
in the global epidemiology. They act as viraemic travellers, carrying the disease
into areas with mosquitos that can transmit the infection. This is particularly
true with respect to the reality in the archipelago of Cape Verde, where it is believed that the insects responsible for the outbreak that occurred in 2009 came
from Brazil, transported by means of the frequent air transport [2].
There are two forms of Dengue: Dengue Fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever. The first one is characterized by a sudden fever without respiratory
symptoms, accompanied by intense headaches and lasts between three and seven
days. The second has the previous symptoms but additionally also nausea,
vomiting and fainting due to low blood pressure, and can lead to death in two
or three days [8].
There are four distinct, but closely related, viruses that cause Dengue. Recovery from infection by one virus provides lifelong immunity against that virus
but confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection
by the other three viruses. There is good evidence that sequential infection
increases the risk of developing Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF). Activities,
such as triage and management, are critical in determining the clinical outcome
of Dengue. A rapid and efficient front-line response not only reduces the number
of unnecessary hospital admissions but also saves lives.
There is no vaccine to protect against Dengue. With four closely related
viruses that can cause the disease, a vaccine would need to immunize against
all four types to be effective. There is limited understanding of how the disease
typically behaves and how the virus interacts with the immune system. Another challenge is that some studies show that some secondary Dengue infection
can leave to DHF, and theoretically a vaccine could be a potential cause of
severe disease if a solid immunity is not established against the four serotypes.
Research to develop a vaccine is ongoing and the incentives to study the mechanism of protective immunity are gaining more support, now that the number
of outbreaks around the world is increasing [28].
The spread of Dengue is attributed to expanding geographic distribution
of the four Dengue viruses and their mosquito vectors, the most important of
which is the predominantly urban species Aedes aegypti; some notes about it are
presented in Section 2. A mathematical model of the interaction between human
and mosquito populations is presented in Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with

the basic reproduction number, the equilibria of the epidemiological model and
their stability. In Section 5, previous results are applied to a case study. Finally,
concluding notes are given in Section 6.

Biological notes on Aedes aegypti

The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a tropical and subtropical specie widely distributed around the world, mostly between latitudes 35o N and 35o S, which
corresponds, approximately, to a winter isotherm of 10o C [4]. The life cycle of
a mosquito has four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. In the case of
Aedes aegypti, the first three stages take place in or near water whilst air is the
medium for the adult stage [17]. The eggs of Aedes aegypti can resist desiccation
and low temperatures for up to one year. Although the hatching of mature eggs
may occur spontaneously at any time, this is greatly stimulated by flooding.
The larva moults four times in a period of a few days which culminates in the
pupal stage. The pupal stage lasts from one day to a few weeks, depending on
the temperature. At the end of this stage, the adult emerges from the pupal skin
[7]. Studies suggest that most female mosquitoes may spend their lifetime in or
around the houses where they emerge as adults. This means that people, rather
than mosquitoes, rapidly move the virus within and between communities.
The adult stage of the mosquito is considered to last an average of eleven
days in the urban environment. Dengue is spread only by adult females that
require a blood meal for the development of eggs; male mosquitoes feed on nectar
and other sources of sugar. In this process, the female acquires the virus while
feeding on the blood of an infected person. After virus incubation for eight to
ten days, an infected mosquito is capable, during probing and blood feeding, of
transmitting the virus for the rest of its life. Aedes aegypti is one of the most
efficient vectors for arboviruses because it is highly anthropophilic, frequently
bites several times before complete oogenesis and thrives in close proximity to
humans [28].
It is very difficult to control or eliminate the Aedes aegypti mosquito because
it adapts to the environment and becomes resistant to natural phenomena, e.g.,
droughts, or human interventions and control measures. Vector control is a
key for combating mosquito-borne diseases and the major tool available for
tackling the transmission of Dengue, a disease for which there is no vaccine
nor prophylaxis. There are two main methods for primary prevention: larval
control and adult mosquito control, depending on the intended target [15]. In
urban areas Aedes mosquitos breed on water collections in artificial containers
such as cans, plastic cups, used tires, broken bottles, flower pots, etc. Proper
solid waste disposal and improved water storage practices, including covering
containers to prevent access by egg-laying female mosquitoes, are methods that
are encouraged through community-based programmes [6]. Active monitoring
and surveillance of the natural mosquito population should accompany control
efforts to determine programme effectiveness.

The mathematical model

The mathematical model is based on [10, 9]. The novelty in this paper is the
presence of the control parameter related to adult mosquito insecticide.

3 The mathematical model

4

The notation used in our mathematical model includes four epidemiological
states for humans:
Sh (t)
Eh (t)
Ih (t)
Rh (t)

susceptible (individuals who can contract the disease)
exposed (individuals who have been infected by the parasite
but are not yet able to transmit to others)
infected (individuals capable of transmitting the disease to others)
resistant (individuals who have acquired immunity)

It is assumed that the total human population (Nh ) is constant, so, Nh =
Sh + Eh + Ih + Rh . There are also four other state variables related to the female
mosquitoes (the male mosquitoes are not considered in this study because they
do not bite humans and consequently they do not influence the dynamics of the
disease):
Am (t)
Sm (t)
Em (t)
Im (t)

aquatic phase (that includes the egg, larva and pupa stages)
susceptible (mosquitoes that are able to contract the disease)
exposed (mosquitoes that are infected but are not yet able
to transmit to humans)
infected (mosquitoes capable of transmitting the disease to humans)

In order to analyze the effects of campaigns to fight the mosquito, there is
also a control variable:
c(t)

level of insecticide campaigns

Some assumptions in this model:
• the total human population (Nh ) is constant;
• there is no immigration of infected individuals into the human population;
• the population is homogeneous, which means that every individual of a
compartment is homogenously mixed with the other individuals;
• the coefficient of transmission of the disease is fixed and does not vary
seasonally;
• both human and mosquitoes are assumed to be born susceptible; there is
no natural protection;
• for the mosquito there is no resistant phase, due to its short lifetime.
The parameters of the model are:

Notice that the equation related to the aquatic phase does not have the
control variable c, because the adulticide does not produce effects in this stage
of the life of the mosquito. To combat the larval phase, it would be necessary
to use larvicide. This treatment should be long-lasting and have World Health
Organization clearance for use in drinking water. As we want to study only a
short period of time, this type of treatment has not been considered here.
With the condition Sh + Eh + Ih + Rh = Nh , one can, in the example given,
use Rh = Nh − Sh − Eh − Ih and consider an equivalent system for human
population without considering the Rh differential equation.

be the region of biological interest, that is positively invariant under the flow
induced by the differential system (1)-(2) (see Appendix A).
Theorem 1. Let Ω be defined as above. Consider also
M = − (c(ηA + µA ) + µA µm + ηA (−µb + µm )).
The system (1)-(2) admits at most two disease free equilibrium points:
• if M ≤ 0, there is a Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), called Trivial Equilibrium, E1∗ = (Nh , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
• if M >
Disease-Free Equilibrium (BRDFE),
 0, there is a Biologically Realistic

∗
E2 = Nh , 0, 0, ηA µb , µb µm , 0, 0 .

Proof. See Appendix B.

Remark 1. The condition M > 0 is equivalent, by algebraic manipulation, to
(ηA + µA )(µm + c)
< 1, where the left-hand side corresponds to
the condition
µb ηA
the basic offspring number for mosquitos. Thus, if M ≤ 0, then the mosquito
population will collapse and the only equilibrium for the whole system is the
trivial equilibrium. If M > 0, then the mosquito population is sustainable.
It is necessary to determine the basic reproduction number of the disease,
R0 . This number is very important from the epidemiologistic point of view.
It represents the expected number of secondary cases produced in a completed
susceptible population, by a typical infected individual during its entire period
of infectiousness [11, 12]. Following [25], we prove:
Theorem 2. If M > 0, then the square of the basic reproduction number asB 2 Sh Sm βhm βmh ηm νh
. The
sociated to (1)-(2) is R20 = 2
Nh (ηh + µh )(c + µm )(c + ηm + µm )(µh + νh )
equilibrium point BRDFE is locally asymptotically stable if R0 < 1 and unstable
if R0 > 1.
Proof. See Appendix C.
Remark 2. In our model, we have two different populations (human and vector), so the expected basic reproduction number reflects the infection humanvector and also vector-human, that is, R20 = Rhm × Rmh with
Rhm =

Rmh =

When R0 < 1, each infected individual produces, on average, less than one
new infected individual, and therefore it is predictable that the infection will
be cleared from the population. If R0 > 1, the disease is able to invade the
susceptible population.

From a biological point of view, it is desirable that humans and mosquitoes
coexist without the disease reaching a level of endemicity. We claim that proper
use of the control c can result in the basic reproduction number remaining below
unity and, therefore, making BRDFE stable.
In order to make effective use of achievable insecticide control, and simultaneously to explain more easily to the competent authorities its effectiveness, we
assume that c is constant. The goal is to find c such that R20 < 1.

Dengue in Cape Verde

An unprecedented outbreak was detected in the Cape Verde archipelago in
September 2009 [29]. This is the first report of Dengue virus activity in that
country. A total of 17 224 cases, including six deaths, were reported from 18
of the 22 municipalities in Cape Verde by the end of 2009. The municipality of Praia, on Santiago island, notified the highest number of cases (13000
cases) followed by São Felipe in Fogo Island (3000 cases). We used the data
for human population related to Cape Verde [6]. There have been no cases of
Dengue in all the West African countries near Cape Verde islands since 2000

[2]. They speak explicitly about mosquitoes coming from Brazil. Also the information that comes from the Ministry of Health in the capital of Cape Verde,
Praia, confirms that the insects responsible for Dengue came most probably
from Brazil, transported by means of air transport that perform frequent connections between Cape Verde and Brazil, as reported by José Rosa in the Radio
of Cape Verde. With respect to Aedes aegypti, we have thus considered data
from Brazil [24, 30].
The simulations were carried out using the following values: Nh = 480000,
B = 1, βmh = 0.375, βhm = 0.375, µh = 1/(71 × 365), ηh = 1/3, µm = 1/11,
µb = 6, µA = 1/4, ηA = 0.08, ηm = 1/11, νh = 1/4, m = 6, k = 3, K = kNh .
The initial conditions for the problem were: Sh0 = Nh − Eh0 − Ih0 , Eh0 = 216,
Ih0 = 434, Rh0 = 0, Am0 = kNh , Sm0 = mNh .
Considering nonexistence of control, i.e. c = 0, the basic reproduction number for this outbreak in Cape Verde is approximately R0 = 2.396, which is in
agreement to other studies of Dengue in other countries [16]. The control c affects the basic reproduction number, and our aim is to find a control that puts
R0 less than one.
Proposition 1. Let us consider the parameters listed above and consider c as
a constant. Then R0 < 1 if and only if c > 0.156961.
Several computational investigations were carried out. The software used
was Scilab [5]. It is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational
package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language. For our
problem, we used the routine ode to solve the set of differential equations. By
default, ode uses the lsoda solver of package ODEPACK. It automatically selects
between the non-stiff predictor-corrector Adams method and the stiff Backward
Differentiation Formula (BDF) method. It uses the non-stiff method initially
and dynamically monitors data in order to decide which method to use. The
graphics were also obtained using this software, using the command plot.
Figures 1 and 2 show the curves related to human population, with and
without control, respectively. The number of infected persons, even with a
small control, is much less than without any insecticide campaign.
Figures 3 and 4 show the difference between a region with control and without control.
When the control is applied, the number of infected mosquitoes is close to
zero. Note that the intention is not to eradicate the mosquitoes but instead the
number of infected mosquitoes.

Conclusions and future work

In this paper, a model based on two populations, humans and mosquitoes,
with insecticide control has been presented. It has been shown that with a
steady insecticide campaign, it is possible to reduce the number of infected
humans and mosquitoes and can prevent an outbreak that could transform an
epidemiological episode to an endemic disease.
It has been proved algebraically that, if a constant minimum level of a control
is applied, it is possible to maintain the basic reproduction number below unity,
guaranteeing the BRDFE. This is corroborated in another numerical study [19].
In this work, we considered a constant control. In future work, using a
theoretical approach [18], we intend to find the best function c(t), using optimal

control theory. Instead of finding a constant control, it will be possible to
study other types of control, such as piecewise constant or even continuous but
not constant. Numerical methods can be used to solve the model [21, 22, 26].
Additionally, we could consider another strategy, a more practical one: due to
logistics and health reasons, it may be more convenient to apply insecticide
periodically and at some specific hours at night.
The rapid increase in mosquito resistance to several chemical insecticides,
and the damage caused by these to the environment, has resulted in the search
for new control alternatives, such as the use of biological agents. Among the
alternatives available, the use of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) has been
adopted by several countries [14]. Laboratory testing shows that Bti has a high
larvicide property and its mechanism of action is based on the production of an
endotoxin protein that, when ingested by the larvae, causes death. So, in future
work, we will also take into account the use of larvicide control.
To ensure the minimization of the outbreaks, educational programmes that
are customized for different levels of health care and that reflect local capacity
should be supported and implemented widely. The population should also be
educated regarding Dengue in order to minimize the breeding of the mosquito.
Educational campaigns can be included as an extra control parameter in the
model.

and F = (µh Nh , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) . As M (X) has all off-diagonal entries nonnegative, M (X) is a Metzler matrix.
Using the fact that F ≥ 0, system (3) is positively invariant in R7+ [1], which
means that any trajectory of the system starting from an initial state in the
positive orthant R7+ remains forever in R7+ .

Using the Mathematica software to solve system (4), we obtained four solutions.
The first one is known as the Trivial Equilibrium, since the mosquitoes do
not exist, so there is no disease:
E1∗ = (Nh , 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
In the second one, mosquitoes and humans interact, but there is only one
outbreak of the disease, i.e., over time the disease goes away without being
necessary to kill all the mosquitoes. We have called this equilibrium point
a Biologically Realistic Disease-Free Equilibrium (BRDFE), since it is a more
reasonable situation to find in nature than the previous one:

kNh (− (c(ηA + µA ) + µA µm + ηA (−µb + µm )))

This is biologically interesting only if M is greater than 0.
The third solution corresponds to a situation where humans and mosquitoes
live together but the disease persists in the two populations. So the disease is
not anymore an epidemic episode, but transforms into an endemic one. With
some algebraic manipulations, we obtain the following point:

As before, this equilibrium is only biologically interesting if M > 0.
With the Mathematica software we obtained a fourth solution. However,
some of its components are negative, which means that it does not belong to
the Ω set.

The basic reproduction number: proof of Theorem 2

The basic reproduction number is calculated in a disease free equilibrium. In
this case we consider the most realistic one, BRDFE.
Following [3, 25], we consider the vector xT = (Eh , Ih , Em , Im ), which corresponds to the components related to the progression of the disease. Thus, the
subsystem used is:
dEh
Im
dt (t) = Bβmh Nh Sh − (νh + µh )Eh
dIh
dt (t) = νh Eh − (ηh + µh )Ih
Ih
dEm
dt (t) = Bβhm Nh Sm − (µm + ηm )Em
dIm
dt (t) = ηm Em − µm Im − cIm .

x = (Eh , Ih , Em , Im ), F (x) represents the components related to new cases of
disease (in this situation in the exposed compartments) and V(x) represents the
other components. Thus, the subsystem (5) can be rewritten as

This subsystem can be written as partitioned,

Let us considerer the Jacobian matrices

According to [25], the basic reproduction number is R0 = ρ(JF (x0 ) JV −1 (x0 ) ),
where x0 is a disease free equilibrium (BRDFE) and ρ(A) defines the spectral
radius of a matrix A. Using Mathematica
R20 =

B 2 kβhm βmh ηm νh M
,
µb (ηh + µh )µm (c + µm )(c + ηm + µm )(µh + νh )

and we obtain the value for the threshold parameter, with M > 0.
