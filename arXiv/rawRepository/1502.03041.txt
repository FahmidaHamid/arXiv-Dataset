Abstract. Carey’s Equality pertaining to stationary models is well known. In this paper, we have
stated and proved a fundamental theorem related to the formation of this Equality. This theorem
will provide an in-depth understanding of the role of each captive subject, and their corresponding
follow-up duration in a stationary population. We have demonstrated a numerical example of a
captive cohort and the survival pattern of medfly populations. These results can be adopted to
understand age-structure and aging process in stationary and non-stationary population population
models. Key words: Captive cohort, life expectancy, symmetric patterns.

1. Introduction
The motivation to explore the question from which Carey’s Equality ultimately emerged stemmed
from the lack of methods for estimating age structure in insect populations in particular, and in a
wide range of animal populations generally. Although various methods exist for estimating the age
of individual insects, including the use of mechanical damage, chemical analysis and gene expression, many are costly, most require major training and calibration efforts and none are accurate
at older ages. Because of these technical constraints, our concept was to explore the possibility
of using the distribution of remaining lifespans of captured insects (e.g. fruit flies) to estimate
age structure statics and dynamics. The underlying idea was that the death distribution of all
standing populations must necessarily be related to the population from which it is derived, ceteris
perabus.
James Carey first observed the symmetric survival patterns of a captive cohort and follow-up
cohort of medflies (see for example in [2, 1]). Later it was referred to as Carey’s Equality [3]
although a formal mathematical statement on a generalized Equality of Carey’s type was missing.
The phenomena of Equality of mean length of life lived by a cohort of individuals up to a certain
time, and the mean of their remaining length of life in a stationary population, was well established
[12, 11]. Proof of Carey’s Equality in [3] is based on the stationary population property explained in
[11] although similar phenomena were also found to be useful in understanding the renewal process,
see Chapter 5 in [13]. We have formally stated a fundamental theorem to justify Carey’s Equality
under a stationary population model, which would allow us to obtain expected lifetimes of a captive
cohort of subjects in which each subject is captured at a different age, starting at birth. Further, we

have proved our statement under a certain combinatorial and stationary population modeling setup. These results are extended to two dimensions for estimating age-structure of wild populations
and understanding internal structure of aging process, age-structure of wild populations [4]. One
also needs to understand the implications of our results for estimating the age structure in stable
populations [5].

2. Main Theorem
Theorem 1. Suppose (X, Y, Z) is a triplet of column vectors, where X = [x1 , x2 , · · · , xk ]T , Y =
[y1 , y2, · · · , yk ]T , Z = [z1 , z2 , · · · , zk ]T representing capture ages, follow-up durations, and lengths
of lives for k−subjects, respectively. Suppose, F (Z), the distribution function of Z is known
and follows a stationary population. Let G1 be the graph connecting the co-ordinates of SY , the
survival function whose domain is N(k) = {1, 2, 3, ..., k} i.e. the set of first k positive integers and
SY (j) = yj for j = 1, 2, ..., k. Let G2 be the graph connecting the co-ordinates of CX , the function of
∗
capture ages whose domain is N(k) and CX (j) = xj for all j = 1, 2, ..., k. Suppose CX
(−j) = xj
∗
for all j = 1, 2, ..., k. Let H be the family of graphs constructed using the co-ordinates of CX

consisting of each of the k! permutations of graphs. Then one of the members of H (say,Hg ) is a
vertical mirror image of G1 .
Proof. In the hypotheses, the information on capture ages, follow-up durations, and lengths of
lives are given as column vectors. For analyzing data collected from life table studies on different
organisms (including life expectancy), column vectors are used for representing a convenient data
structure, where the matrix of interest has only one column. Capture ages of all subjects in our
paper are arranged in a column such that it will be suitable to do addition operations on these
ages with a column vector consisting of lives left for corresponding subjects. One also can compute
inner product of these two column vectors, but the resultant scalar obtained by such operation is
not of interest in the present context. Life table analysis in demography considers column-wise
information and each column has a special purpose even though the information obtained from the
last column has the key data needed for actuarial modeling, mortality analysis, etc, Using these
column vectors of capture ages and follow-up durations from the hypothesis, we have constructed
two sets, I1 and I2 .

Let I1 = {(i, yi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} and I2 = {(i, xi ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} . G1 is constructed using specific
ordered pairs of I1 , explained later in the proof, and G2 is constructed by corresponding ordered
pairs of I2 . There are two criteria, U1 and U2 , that govern the one-to-one correspondence properties
of the two functions, S and CX .

U1 = {No two subjects are captured who are of the same age and
there are no two subjects whose follow-up times until death are identical} .

U2 = {There is more than one subject which has the same capture ages, and
there is more than one subject which has the same follow-up durations until death} .
Suppose f1 and f2 are probability density functions of capture times and follow-up times to
death, then by [3], we will have f1 (a) = f2 (a), which is the probability of an individual who lived
a years is the same as probability that this individual lives ′ a′ years during the follow-up [3]. For

an infinite population in a continuous time set-up for each x ∈ CX there exists a y ∈ SY such that

of the age at capture of ith − subject (i.e. xi ) and the follow-up duration (or time left in the current
context) of ith −subject (i.e. yi ) is equal to the total length of the life (i.e. zi ) for the ith −subject.

Let’s define max {yi }ki=1 = yt1 for some tth
1 − subject out of k−subjects,
max {yi : for all i ∈ N(k) and i 6= t1 } = yt2 for some tth
2 −subject out of k − 1 subjects and so on
until we arrive at,

	
max yi : for all i ∈ N(k) and i 6= t1 , t2 , ..., t(k−1) = ytk .

G1 is constructed by joining the co-ordinates of the set S on the first quadrant, where

(2.3)

S = {(t1 , yt1 ) , (t2 , yt2 ) , · · · , (tk , ytk )} .

We call each co-ordinate of S as a cell of S. One can visualize, cells in S are made up of ordered
pair of co-ordinates, where abscissa is the subject captured and ordinate is the life left for this
subject after capture. Here, the graph, we mean by a curve obtained by joining the cells in S.
Each cell, except the first and the last cell of S are joined to both sides of its neighboring cells.
In case there is more than one subject with a maximum value at one or more stage above, it will
lead to two or more identical co-ordinates that are used in G1 . When S satisfies U1 , G1 is a graph
of decreasing function; when S is satisfies criterion U2 , G1 is a graph of combination of decreasing
and non-decreasing functions.
We can construct a sequence of quantities xu1 ,xu2 , · · · ,xuk similarly to S to form the set T , given
below:

(2.4)

T = {(u1 , xu1 ) , (u2, xu2 ) , · · · , (uk , xuk )}

Corresponding to (t1 , yt1 ) ∈ S there exists a (j, xj ) ∈ I2 which could be (u1 , xu1 ) or some other cell
∗
in T. Note that, CX
= {(−j, xj ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ k}. Corresponding to (t1 , yt1 ) ∈ S if there exists a cell
∗
(|−i| , xi ) ∈ CX
such that |t1 − |−i|| = 0 and |yt1 − xi | = 0 then we call (t1 , yt1 ) and (|−i| , xi ) are a
∗
pair of equidistant cells from a vertical axis. We can construct a graph H1 using cells of CX
in the

natural order of integers. In total, we can have k! permutations of orders to construct H1,··· , Hk! .

Our theorem establishes existence of graph depicting mirror images of the pre- and post-capture
longevity distributions in Figure 5.1. In general, in the area of population biology where survivorship curves of captive cohort obey Carey’s Equality, there is a need for understanding the pattern
within the data structure. The results by [3, 11] explain functional symmetries as an application of
renewal theory. We do not depend on any of the classical works on renewal equation and renewal
theory proposed by Lotka [14, 15, 16, 17] and by Feller [18] (also see Chapter XI in [19]). Our inspiration is purely from experimental observations demonstrated by James Carey and a statement
on stationary populations in the equation (1) in the paper by Vaupel [3]. However, our theory
and method of proof uses sequentially arranged data of captive individuals, which was also usually
done in renewal theory analysis or proving renewal-type of equations.

Hence our method provide an alternative and independent approach for such kind of sequentially
arranged captive subjects. Besides relating the captive ages and corresponding follow-up durations
of subjects in a stationary population, the principles of the theorem helped to visualize personyears in a follow-up starting at birth, in a stationary population model in which subjects of each
age are captured.

2.1. Life expectancy. First we construct the age structured survival function using l(s), the
number of captured subjects at age s and l(s0 ), the number of subjects at the beginning of the
follow-up. Suppose s0 is the time at the beginning of the follow-up, si is the time at the ith time
point of observation for i = 1, 2, · · · , k. Suppose each of the yti for i = 1, 2, · · · , k fall exactly in
one of the time intervals (si−1 , si ), then the expectancy of life is
over the time period are q(si ) =

k−i

k+1
.
2

The probability of death

with the survival pattern, l(si ) = k − i for i = 1, 2, · · · , k − 1

and l(sk ) = 0, q(sk ) = 1. Suppose there are ni number of yti falling within (si−1 , si ) such that
Pk
i=1 ni = k and l(si ) follows the previous construction. If ni > 1 in one or more of the (si−1 , si )

then there must exist empty cells where the event of death is avoided. Let us define a number c1
as follows:

c1 = {Number of cells (si−1 , si ) for i = 1, 2, · · · , k where exactly one of the yti falls }

If c1 = k, then the life expectancy is

k+2
.
2

If c1 6= k, then at least one of the (si−1 , si ) is empty.

There could be several combinations of distribution of yt1 in (si−1 , si ) when the event c1 6= k occurs,
and we explain in the following remark one possible situation in which deaths are concentrated in
the early ages and at late ages. Other combinations can be evaluated using similar constructions.

Remark 1. Suppose n1 = n2 = · · · = nr1 = 1; nr1 +1 = nr1 +2 = · · · = nr2 = 0; and nr2 +1 = nr2 +2 =
P
· · · = nk = 1 such that ki=1 ni = k for some 1 < r1 < r2 < k. The probability of death at various
ages, q(si ), is,

We state a theorem for the total person-years to be lived by all the subjects in a birth cohort.

Theorem 2. Suppose subjects of each age of life in a population are captured. Then, using the
constructions in c(0) and E[c(0)], the total person-years, say, T (a, c(0), E[c(0)]), that will be lived
by newly born subjects in a stationary population can be expressed as

3. History and Related Results
An Equality arising out of symmetries of life lived and life left was named as Carey’s Equality by
James Vaupel [3], to highlight the discovery of certain symmetries in his biodemographic experiments by James Carey (see, for example, [2, 1]). Vaupel [3] and Goldstein [11] have proved equality
on such symmetries as a direct application of renewal theory. Our main theorem in this article
is not inspired by renewal theory, but we conceptualized our approach directly from experimental results shown by James Carey and then used equation (1) from Vaupel [3] in our hypothesis.
Renewal theory has long history even before the seminal works on population dynamics by Alfred
Lotka (see, for example, [14, 15, 16]), who has used an integral equation of type (3.1) to link
number of births at time t > 0 with number of births a women has at time t = 0.

(3.1)

B(t) =

ˆ

t

G(t, a)da + H(t)
0

where B(t) is total number of births at time t, G(t, a) is number of births from a women who
is at age a and alive at time t and H(t) is number of births from a women who is alive at t = 0.

GENERALIZATION OF CAREY’S EQUALITY AND A THEOREM ON STATIONARY POPULATION

11

Usually, we compute B(t) from a = α to a = β, where α is lower reproductive age and β is upper
reproductive age. G(t, a) can be written as,

(3.2)

G(t, a) = B(t − a)s(a)

where B(t − a) is total number of births at time (t − a) and s(a) is chance of surviving to exact
age a. 3.1 is also referred as renewal equation. Combining 3.1 and 3.2, we can write B(t) within
reproductive ages as,

(3.3)

B(t) =

ˆ

β

B(t − a)s(a)da

William Feller [19] provided foundations of renewal theory in his book (see Chapters VI and XI)
as did authors of other books which were written exclusively on renewal theory (see for example,
[13]) or contained chapters devoted to basic renewal theory (for example, see Chapter 6 in [9] and
Chapter 12 in [20]). Several applications of convolutions of independent random variables which
we see in renewal theory can also be found in understanding disease progression between one stage
to another stage, epidemic prediction and so forth (for example, see [21] and [22]).

4. Example and visualization
We provide here a practical application based on the medfly population with a visual depiction
of Carey’s Equality (Figure 5.1). Note the symmetry of the pre- and post-capture segments of the
lifespans of individuals in the population that underlies the equivalency of life-days which, in turn,
underlies the equivalency noted by [3], "If an individual is chosen at random from a stationary
population...then the probability the individual is one who has lived a years equals the probability
the individuals is one who has that number of years left to live.”
Carey’s Equality is important because it both builds on and complements the properties of
one of the most important models in demography: the stationary population model. Stationary population model is fundamental to formal demography because it is a special case of the
stable population model, and provides explicit expressions that connect the major demographic

GENERALIZATION OF CAREY’S EQUALITY AND A THEOREM ON STATIONARY POPULATION

12

parameters to one another, including life expectancy, birth rates, death rates and age structure,
see Chapter 3 in [7]. A graphical depiction of Carey’s Equality, shown in Figure 5.2, shows the
interconnectedness of these parameters. Note that the shape of the stationary population 5.2(a)
as well as both its age and death distributions 5.2(b) are identical, and that the proportion of
each age class in the captive population 5.2(c) is identical to the proportions within the whole
population (i.e. due to the symmetrical distributions of pre- and post-capture lifespans in 5.2(b)).
5. Discussion
The approach we used in this paper to demonstrate the mathematical identity underlying Carey’s
Equality is fundamentally different than that used by previous authors. Originally James Carey
created a simple life table model (Table 1 in [2]) to demonstrate the equality of age structure
and post-capture deaths in a stationary population, the identity of which was then formalized by
statisticians Hans Müller and Jane-Ling Wang [2]. Vaupel [3] and Goldstein [11] followed by using
mathematical first principles to derive the equality.
Our approach differs from the one we just outlined. Instead of first formulating and then deriving
the equality, we justified the constancy of post-capture patterns of death in stationary medfly
populations in the following two steps. The first was to conjecture that in stationary populations
the ordered pre- and post-capture life course segments of individuals will be symmetrical (Theorem
1) and that total person-years in a captive cohort can be formulated (Theorem 2). The second
was to prove these relationships using a series of mathematical assumptions (i.e. the respective
proofs).
Our approach contributes to the demographic literature in general and specifically to an understanding of Carey’s Equality in several ways. First, our theorems provide an independent method
for formulating a mathematical relationship in formal demography. Indeed we are unaware of any
other models in formal demography that have involved proofs from mathematical conjectures (theorems). Second, our proofs allow us to state unequivocally that the Carey Equality will be true in
all stationary populations. Although this is a logical outcome from all of the earlier approaches,
our approach makes this result both explicit and conclusive. Third, our proofs required that we
draw on set theory, an area of mathematics involving logic that is not commonly used in demography. As a consequence of the problem framed in fundamental mathematics, Carey’s Equality is

better situated both to draw from and be extended into other areas of basic mathematical theory.
Fourth, using the ideas of the main theorem, we are positioned to obtain further results related
to Carey’s Equality such as for higher dimensions and probabilistic and deterministic results for
multiple captive cohorts.
6. Conclusions
Our paper offers new sets of tools, techniques and theoretical framework in terms of visualization
of the demographic data involving capture ages and development of new theoretical ideas for

analyzing data obtained by captive cohorts. Such approaches will have applications in other
demographic situations, for example, understanding aging patterns in a captive cohort data when
information on lives left is right truncated, projecting various scenarios of demographic transition,
etc,
The main result of our paper will be useful in understanding the relationship between average
lengths of lives of captured, follow-up, and total lengths of the lives in a stationary population.
Our method of re-structuring the follow-up durations of captive cohort can be adopted also for
non-stationary populations, which can be used for understanding the internal structures of the
population with respect to the age at capture. This will enable us to look deeper into the aging
process of stationary and non-stationary populations. For each captive cohort of subjects there

GENERALIZATION OF CAREY’S EQUALITY AND A THEOREM ON STATIONARY POPULATION

15

exists an associated, exact configuration of a combination of coordinates of the survival graphs, and
this association is dynamic. The right combination of coordinates is dependent on the formation
of the captive cohort. The idea of a proof through formation of symmetric graphs, combined
with captive age distribution is novel. We have demonstrated the utility of such thinking in
understanding symmetric patterns formed of a captive cohort and associated follow-up lengths.
This strategy was also helpful for us in deriving formulae for expectation of life in a stationary
population, discretely, and also using multiple integrals. The theory explained here can be adopted
to both human and non-human populations.
