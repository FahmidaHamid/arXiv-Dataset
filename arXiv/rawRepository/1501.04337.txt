Abstract — The aim of this paper is to give an introductory
review of the cryoelectron microscopy as a complex data source
for the most of the system biology branches, including the most
perspective non-local approaches known as "localomics" and
"dynamomics". A brief summary of various cryoelectron microscopy methods and corresponding system biological approaches is given in the text. The above classification can be
considered as a useful framework for the primary comprehensions about cryoelectron microscopy aims and instrumental
tools. We do not discuss any of these concepts in details, but
merely point out that their methodological complexity follows
only from the structure-functional complexity of biological
systems which are investigated in this manner. We also postulate that one can employ some of the cryoelectron microscopic
techniques not only for observation, but also for modification
and structural refunctionalization of some biological and similar
soft matter objects and microscopic samples. In other worlds,
we start with the cryoelectron microscopy as a tool for the system biology and progress to its applying as an instrument for
system biology and functional biomimetics; i.e. "system cryobiology" goes over into "synthetic cryobiology" or "cryogenic
biomimetics". All these conclusions can be deduced from the
most recent works of the latest years, including just submitted
foreign papers. This article provides an up-to-date description of
the conceptual basis for the novel view on the computational
cryoelectron microscopy (in silico) approaches and the data
mining principles which lie at the very foundation of modern
structural analysis and reconstruction.

I.

TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS OF
CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY

Since its development in early 1980s [31]
cryo-electron microscopy has become one of
the most functional research methods providing
the study of physiological and biochemical
changes in living matter at various hierarchical
levels from single mammalian cell morphology
[108] to nanostructures [69] and even the structure of biomacromolecules with a near-atomic
resolution [19], i.e. at an all-atom configuration
reconstruction [72]. In recent papers the cryoelectron microscopic techniques were reported
to achieve the effective resolution up to several
angstroms [12,71,130] and about 2-5 nm in a
3D representation [29]. To date the structural
methods of cryo-electron microscopy have been
involved in characterization of a number of
supramolecular structures and complexes: from
the well-studied fibrillar collagen structures
[92], intraflagillar transport complexes of protozoa [91], tubulin in microtubules [125] and
some other fibrillar and filamentous structures
with the relative molecular weight of about
gigadalton [101] up to such subtle elements of
biological machinery as ribosomal complexes
(e.g. those involved in cotranslational folding

and translocation [62]), elements of secondary
[95] and supersecondary protein structure [7],
as well as the conformational effects in molecular mechanisms of their folding [25] and the
mechanisms of expression in the complexes of
encoding semantides [109] (in terms of
Zuckerkandl and Pauling [133]). In addition to
the conventional cryo-electron microscopy,
modern structural analysis, particularly the determination of the protein secondary structure,
requires the use of its precision 3D analog –
cryo-electron tomography [9], which enables
structure visualization at a wide scale / range of
sizes, including the all-atom mapping [88] and a
nanoscale cytophysiological ultrastructure analysis (so-called nanoimaging [63]. There is also
an inherently close method of cryo-tomography
– X-ray tomography with cooling under high
pressure [123], which demonstrates approximately the same metrological characteristics.

II.

ALGORITHMIC TOOLS FOR
CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY

It is noteworthy that the ultra-high measurement accuracy requires the use of advanced
mathematical apparatus and algorithmic processing: even the so-called direct methods of
improving the image quality in cryo-electron
microscopy are implemented only through the
optimization of the number of summed and corresponding files with the unary cryo-electron
micrographs [65,46]. This procedure requires a
significant amount of computer time and robust
high-performance mathematical processing systems. The modern trend in the hardware for
such processing places a special emphasis on
the CUDA technologies using video cards /
graphics processing units (GPUs) providing the
improvement of calculations [52], while for the
purposes of data processing in cryo-electron
microscopy in addition to the standard principles of machine learning in the pattern recognition [105,85] it is also useful to apply the following approaches:
1. flexible variants of the parameter fitting
achieved by retraining during the search for extremes [3],
2. Bayesian probabilistic approaches in
cryo-electron structural analysis [97],

3. algorithms of subtomogram analysis
and in cryo-electron tomography [15,54],
4. eigen analysis with the search for eigenvectors in order to enable classification of
the cryoelectron images upon their angular
characteristics [106],
5. wavelet methods using multivariate
functions and the Toeplitz structures [115], etc.
Except the above mentioned methods
there are also a number of widely used conventional methods of structural and chemical profiling (e.g. "cryo-ultra-low-angle microtomy")
[45] and other similar methods, underlying the
CEDX
(quantitative cryo-analytical
scanning electron microscopy) approaches [78]. In
other words, modern cryo-electron microscopic
techniques are mostly automated data processing and interpretation methods, rather than
data acquisition.
The above statement can be illustrated using the data provided by M. Stowell from the
University of Cоlоrаdо. It is seen from the Fig.
1 that even the similar structures with the
equivalent morphometric parameters can
demonstrate a high dispersion of geometrical
characteristics, and in the case of different iterations of the mathematical and statistical data
processing one can expect to obtain different
morphologies and even different topologies (according to the number of connections) of the
object under 3D reconstruction. The dynamics
of the increase in accuracy of the measurements
and morphological reconstructions from 1990 to
2000 was demonstrated by J. Frank in 2006 (see
Fig. 2), which may be attributed to the improvement of the mathematical data processing
methods. Thus, it is clear that the ambiguity of
the structures' morphology after reconstruction
in cryo-electron microscopy and tomography is
characterized not only by quantitative (morphometric), but also by qualitative (geometric
and topological) transformations.
Moreover, an ambiguous data interpretation in cryo-electron microscopic structure
analysis necessitates the use of various mathematical models which determine the
morphostructural representation of the result
obtained, i.e. the above models may be one-toone corresponded to the methods of data processing. Thus, there are several reports on cryo-

electron microscopy using molecular dynamics
simulations corresponding to flexible fitting
methods [23]; pseudoatomic models corresponding to various approaches to the interpretation of full-atom structural analysis data on
the angstrom resolution [84]; probabilistic 3D
models of single particles, corresponding to the
probabilistic (partly Bayesian) methods of data
processing [35], etc. The simulation process
should consider or derive ab initio the sample
characteristics (namely, its solvation shell or a
hydration layer [100]), as well as the noise simulation and the correction of the metrological
readings drift [102] considering the process of
image capturing [116]. With the increasing role
of the model interpretation in cryo-EM data
processing [76] there is a significant increase in
the level of conjugation between modeling,
docking (selection of the most favorable molecular orientation for the stable complex formation) and fitting of the full-atomic
biomolecular structures in 3D mapping [4] (see
Fig. 3), including the approaches and algorithms of the so-called cyclic or iterative refinement (see Fig. 4, 5) [127].

III.

CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AS A
TOOL FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY.

Cryo-electron microscopy, as well as cryoelectron tomography combine the principles of
the computer systems-biological and structuralbiological analyses in silico, ex vivo [81] and in
situ [75]. Actually, among the numerous structural-biological «-omics», i.e. disciplines systematically studying individual classes of organic compounds in accordance with their biological role, cryo-electron microscopy and cryoelectron tomography can provide comprehensive 3D dynamical structural information about
almost all of them, that in correlation microscopy is often called «localomics microscopy» and
«dynamomics» (according to the classification
of J. Parkinson). Such methods allow to study
not only the different development phases or
life cycles of individual biological objects[80],
but also to perform the direct mapping of several characteristics of the molecule dynamics in
molecular assemblies, visualized using the maximum-likelihood method [120], correlation microscopy for 3D structural analysis of the intra-

cellular dynamic interactions using cryoelectron tomography [59] and a so-called "4D
cryo-electron microscopy of proteins" [37]. Furthermore, in immunomics [16,112], considering
the traditional use of a synchronous time-lapse
cinematographic equipment in immuno-electron
microscopy [8], it is reasonable to introduce
dynamic cryo-electron measurements into cryoimmuno-electron microscopy [89], which at the
same time will allow to avoid the image "blurring" artifacts by using the previous frames as
the references for the reconstruction of the object shape and structure [18].
It would be also useful to consider some
more examples illustrating the applicability of
cryo-electron microscopy as a multivariate instrument in systems biology. First of all it concerns the investigations in membranomics and
viromics.
Ultrastructural
studies
of
membranomes [103] using cryo-electron microscopy [70] (despite the lipid / phospholipid
composition of the membranes [26], studied in
the framework of classical lipidology) can not
be directly attributed to the area of lipidomics
or phospholipidomics [68,124], as well as
lipoproteomics [53] (although it is possible to
perform cryo-electron microscopic analysis of
the lipoprotein structures [128] and membrane
proteins [33]), since they predominantly consider the ultrastructural morphophysiological
level of organization rather than the chemical
composition of the sample. In addition to the
applicability in membranomics, cryo-electon
microscopy and tomography allow the study of
membranous cytoplasmic organelles [50,28],
including endosomes and autophagosomes involved in the recycling of the membrane material and its recyclization as a whole [32]. From
the standpoint of computer lipidomics [38],
concerning the dynamic changes in the membrane lipid content under signal transduction, of
great significance is the problem of determination of the payload in the transport nanovesicles
and clathrin-coated vesicles in the brain functional activity, successfully performed by cryoelectron tomography [51]. Current research in
the field of system-biological and applied
viromics [77] also can not be reduced to a
common viral genomics [60] due to the main
focus on the structural aspects of data interpre-

tation in cryo-electron microscopy, tomography
and similar conventional methods [22]. Emphasis is placed on the structure of the viral complexes with exogenous factors, such as the
membrane protein DAF [127], conformational
shift in a poliovirus antigen [74], capsid structural analysis [131], subvirus particles in membranes [44] and the entire virus particles [2], as
well as on the studies of structural and biochemical affinity using specific selective affinity grids [61]. The above studies do not concern
the genetic aspects of the viral structure, hence
they can not be reduced to the structural genomics. In other words, there are specific areas
of application for cryo-electron microscopy in
systems biology, which fail to find a more suitable analytical tool than cryo-electron microscopy
with
further
multiparametric
(multivariative) data interpretation on a computer. Therefore, the complexity of many areas
concerning the problem under investigation determines the complexity of the parameters studied.

IV. MULTIPARAMETRIC CROSSVERIFICATION AS A CONSEQUENCE
OF THE CELLULAR COMPLEXITY.
To confirm the systems nature of the approach proposed it is necessary to demonstrate
the compatibility of cryo-electron microscopy
with the other methods of structural analysis in
order to provide a comparative cross-validation
of the results obtained [36]. Let us consider
such an approach with reference to the comparative studies using cryo-electron and optical
microscopy [14,129], hybridization of cryoelectron microscopy with fluorescent techniques [57,96] and Raman microspectroscopy
with laser tweezers [110]. It is also noteworthy
that cryo-electron microscopic data should be
comparable with the results of the other fine
methods of structural analysis, such as smallangle
neutron
scattering
[11]
and
spectrochemical methods important in the determination of the molecular / supramolecular
structure.

V.

CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AS A
TOOL FOR STRUCTURAL
MICROMACHINING

The structural analysis of a biological
sample at the electron microscope resolution
provides its electron or ion beam micromachining in situ, as reported in a recent paper describing the focused ion beam micromachining of
the eukaryotic cells (Dictyostelium discoideum)
under cryo-electron tomography [93]. The major trend of this approach is the experimental
scheme which allows a simultaneous imaging
and micromachining [94], and the prospects of
such hybridization make it possible to design
molecular machines (mimetics for molecular
cell machinery [34]) and perform various research manipulations with them using cryoelectron microscopy [27,39]. Such controlled
micromanipulations become possible due to the
fact that the registration of the particle beaminduced microscale structure mobility at a nearatomic resolution has yet been achieved in cryoelectron microscopy [73], providing a feedback
between the registration systems and the controller of the microbeam impact. Neither cryoelectron microscopy itself, nor the similar
methods based on it posses significant restrictions on the chemical composition of the
samples. Both organic biological structures and
biomineralized or biomimetic objects –
magnetosomes [1], and even non-biological
zwitterionic systems such as binary surfactants
[86] can be successfully studied by cryoelectron microscopy. Therefore, there are also
no restrictions on the composition of the structures formed under cryogenic electron microscopic micromachining.

VI. THE ANALYTE DISTRIBUTION
MAPPING AND THE DESCRIPTOR
IMAGING IN PHENOMES.
A system-biological approach in cryoelectron microscopy together with the absence
of
the
cryo-EM-micromachining
and
microstructuring product classification according to their chemical composition are expected
to provide mapping and qualitative distribution
of various analytes, both specific within the particular area of systems biology or "-omics" [5]

and nonspecific. To date, numerous synthetic
compounds of either biochemical or nonbiological nature are used as imaging agents in
cryo-electron microscopy [13,87], but even in
pure biological and biomimetic research the
main aim of the combined structural and chemical analysis is to perform non-destructive testing, i.e. ultrastructure visualization without any
chemical modifiers and specific markers [43].
Meanwhile, the mapping procedure can be
easily performed without any external imaging
agents – according to the sample extinction parameters (electron or optical density) controlled
by resolvometry with the quantitative data output in numerical form [64] using model validation [30]. Since the single values without considering the context digital information are insufficient from the metrological standpoint [20],
the comparative mapping (which assumes several points as references in density) may be
aimed at the analysis of the local sample electron density variations (and, hence, the image
optical density) and distribution gradients. The
corresponding data acquisition for some purposes (in particular, the protein structure analysis with cryo-EM maps using flexible fitting
methods [90]) can be easily automated and partially delegated to the PC connected to the network servers with databases and libraries for the
structure analysis and identification.

VII. ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES TO
THE TARGET MAPPING & CONTRAST?
By analogy with the confocal microscopy
which allows using a non-fluorescent imaging
for the intracellular components in the absence
of fluorescent labels, based on the intrinsic
properties of the sample and the light beam
(e.g., differential interference contrast), in cryoelectron microscopy there is a number of
methods which allow the imaging of samples
inappropriate for cryo-EM studies. One of them
is Zernike phase contrast method which is used
both in cryo-electron microscopy and cryoelectron tomography [41,118]. A similar result
can be obtained using the frozen-hydrated biological samples with a Boersch phase plate
[10,117]. It should be noted that Zernike phase
contrast is achieved in a similar way in X-ray
cryomicroscopy [121], so the microparticle vis-

ualization in both cases leads to mathematically
similar results and can be subjected to computer
processing using the algorithms similar to those
applied for the confocal "tomographic" images
of various scales in visible, ultraviolet and nearinfrared spectral ranges [66,67]. In this case
during the image processing one needs not only
to eliminate the digital registration artifacts obvious in cryo-electron microscopy and tomography [107], but also to avoid the beam-induced
blurring reducing the image contrast [83]. The
image quality can be also improved by using
the algorithms of the astigmatism and defocus
estimation through the modulation transfer
function - contrast transfer function (CTF)
[114], based on the power spectra analysis with
a quadrature filter, which is directly related to
the nature of the phase contrast [132].

VIII. FROM SYSTEMS TO SYNTHETIC
BIOLOGY THROUGH CRYOELECTRON MICROMACHINING.
Various factors reducing the image clarity
obviously reduce the analytical quality of the
3D cryo-EM images and the focused ion beam
(FIB) positioning accuracy during the biological
object modification under cryo-electron fixation, particularly in "cryo-FIB" technique with
cryo-EM registration [119] and its quintessence
– "cryo-FIB-SEM" [98]. The development of
complex systems with a synchronized sample
analysis and modification is expected within the
modern tendency to the combination of the systems biology as an analytical approach with the
reverse constructive approach – synthetic biology or the design of some arbitrary artificial biological / biomimetic structures. Thus, the analysis of natural biological structures (e.g., flagella
and ciliary structures of the protozoa [17]) and
semi-synthetic objects (those synthesized artificially from the biochemical components), such
as 3D protein crystals for crystallographic studies [82], lays the foundation for cryo-electron
3D-morphological analysis of synthetic DNAorigami [6] and even more complex hybrid artificial structures, such as an artificial synaps
[43]. Despite the fact that in some cases due to
the planar 2D structure of the sample a less dimensional analysis may be sufficient enough to

obtain the morphological data (cryo-electron
microscopy instead of cryo-tomography)
[58,126], the increase in the analysis dimension
generally leads to the enlargement of the data
amount, and hence, improves its heuristic value,
providing new opportunities for the quantitative
analysis [113].

on the combinatorial testing of various sample
compositions and preparations. Biological nondestructive analysis safe for both the sample
and its environment using low dose techniques
and cryo-electron microscopy has been also
successfully performed [40].

X. CONCLUSIONS.
IX. THE PROSPECTS OF FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT, SIMPLIFICATION &
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE METHOD.
As a result of the above advantages the
prevalence of cryo-electron microscopy in Europe, the USA, Japan and China, as well as the
number of studies performed using cryo-EM
has been continuously increasing in recent
years, and most of the corresponding methods
and setups developed at the end of the last century are considered now retrospectively [111].
Creating a system infrastructure for highthroughput high-resolution cryogenic electron
microscopy [104], implementation of novel advanced analytical methods, such as selfpressurized rapid freezing (SPRF) technique
[49]; design of portable plungers for intact cryoelectron microscopy sample preparation in natural environments [24] and development of hybrid instruments for complex structural analysis
based on cryo-EM and cryo-tomographic techniques are among the most recent problems to
be addressed in this area. A breakthrough in the
above research was the development of correlative cryogenic X-ray tomography with cryolight and electron microscopy [21]. As a result
of the increasing infrastructure and technical
availability of cryo-electron techniques there is
a strong need in popularization of these methods for biologists, physicians and other specialists who are not directly engaged in working
with cryogenic or cryoelectron microscopy. For
this purpose there is a special kind of papers "primers" [79] with specific recommendations
on the organization of research work using
combined methods of cell or tissue analysis and
modification [55], individual molecular biological protocols for the analysis of particular compounds specific for different "-omics" by cryoelectron microscopy [42], guidelines for grid
preparation for the sample fixation [48], based

Nowadays cryo-electron microscopy has
become a usual method of biological research
and ultrastructural control in bioengineering
adapted for specific parameters under investigation. The already achieved image quality, spatial resolution and sensitivity is of applied character [99] and does not affect the physical,
technical and engineering basis of the method.
The introduction of additional axes, sources and
data acquisition systems [47] to the basic construction is similar to the same process in optical microscopy, where the two-, three- and even
four-objective multi-axis systems have recently
emerged due to the progressive tendency of the
image dimension increase providing a quantitative empowerment of the known method
[56,122]. According to the private communications of the foreign colleagues, the new
achievements in cryo-electron microscopy may
be attributed to the variations of the sample environment, the chamber pressure, selection of
useful combinations of detecting and imaging
methods, the operation parameter optimization
for the instrumentation and new robust algorithms of adaptive manipulation control. There
is also a prospect of designing novel scanning
cryogenic systems with the sweep output using
alternative variables: cryoscopic analogs of
Lorenzian magnetic microscopes capable of
single magnetosome mapping; accelerator
"synchro-cryo-micro-mass-spectrometers"
which allow to determine the sample composition in situ during its structure analysis and / or
micromanipulations with it; functional analogs
of scanning thermal and thermoelectric microscopy based on the gradients of thermal and dynamic properties under low temperatures, allowing to distinguish between the living and
non-living objects on a submicron scale and at
the relatively short time intervals from the start
of the sample preparation), etc. One of the most
promising prospects of the aforementioned re-

search performed mainly abroad is to develop
cryobiology at a supramolecular level and to
expand the range of problems in systems biology addressed within the electron microscopic
cryobiology using the methods of multivariate
biophysical screening.
The authors are grateful to their colleagues from Europe and the USA for helpful
discussions, providing the full texts of their papers (including the unpublished ones) and for
their kind permission to use original illustrations in our review.
