Abstract. Quantum integrable systems have very strong mathematical properties that allow an exact
description of their energetic spectrum. From the Bethe equations, I formulate the Baxter “T-Q” relation,
that is the starting point of two complementary approaches based on nonlinear integral equations. The
first one is known as thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, the second one as Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destride Vega. I show the steps toward the derivation of the equations for some of the models concerned. I
study the infrared and ultraviolet limits and discuss the numerical approach. Higher rank integrals of
motion can be obtained, so gaining some control on the eigenvectors. After, I discuss the Hubbard model
in relation to the N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory. The Hubbard model describes hopping electrons
on a lattice.
In the second part, I present an evolutionary model based on Turing machines. The goal is to describe aspects of the real biological evolution, or Darwinism, by letting evolve populations of algorithms.
Particularly, with this model one can study the mutual transformation of coding/non coding parts in a
genome or the presence of an error threshold.
The assembly of oligomeric proteins is an important phenomenon which interests the majority of
proteins in a cell. I participated to the creation of the project “Gemini” which has for purpose the
investigation of the structural data of the interfaces of such proteins. The objective is to differentiate the
role of amino acids and determine the presence of patterns characterizing certain geometries.

Résumé. Les systèmes intégrables quantiques ont des propriétés mathématiques qui permettent la
détermination exacte de leur spectre énergétique. A partir des équations de Bethe, je présente la relation
de Baxter «T-Q». Celle-ci est à l’origine des deux approches que j’ai prioritairement employé dans mes
recherches, les deux basés sur des équations intégrales non linéaires, celui de l’ansatz de Bethe thermodynamique et celui des équations de Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega. Je montre le chemin qui
permet de dériver les équations à partir de certain modèles sur réseau. J’évalue les limites infrarouge et
ultraviolet et je discute l’approche numérique. D’autres constantes de mouvement peuvent être établies,
ce qui permet un certain contrôle sur les vecteurs propres. Enfin, le modèle d’Hubbard, qui décrit des
électrons interagissants sur un réseau, est présenté en relation à la théorie de jauge supersymétrique
N = 4.
Dans la deuxième partie, je présente un modèle d’évolution darwinienne basé sur les machines de
Turing. En faisant évoluer une population d’algorithmes, je peut décrire certains aspects de l’évolution
biologique, notamment la transformation entre parties codantes et non-codantes dans un génome ou la
présence d’un seuil d’erreur.
L’assemblage des protéines oligomériques est un aspect important qui intéresse la majorité des protéines dans une cellule. Le projet «Gemini» que j’ai contribué à créer a pour finalité d’explorer les donnés
structuraux des interfaces des dites protéines pour différentier le rôle des acides aminés et déterminer la
présence de patterns typiques de certaines géométries.

Preface
The text that I present in the next pages aims at giving some flavour of the researches I have carried
on after my degree in physics, obtained in 1995. I tried to give to these notes the style of a comprehensible presentation of the ideas that have animated my researches, with emphasis on the unity of the
development. The single steps are here presented in a correlated view. The calculation details are usually available on my original papers, therefore they have been omitted here considering space and time
constraints too.
For many years, I have been interested in quantum integrable systems. They are physical models
with very special properties that allow to evaluate observable quantities with exact calculations. Indeed,
exact calculations are seldom possible in theoretical physics. For this reason, it is instructive to be able
to perform exact evaluations in some specific model. B. Sutherland entitles “Beautiful models” his book
[15] to express the elegant physical and mathematical properties of integrable models. Thus, in the
Introduction to Part I, I define and present, in a few examples, a number of basic properties of quantum
integrable systems. These examples will be used in the following three chapters. I will describe the work
I did on Destri-de Vega equations, in the first chapter, on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz in the second
one, on the Hubbard model in the third one. In each chapter I also give one or few proposals for the
future, to show that the respective field is an active domain of research. Of course, I had to make a choice
of the subjects I presented and, forcedly, others were excluded to keep the text into a readable size.
Particularly, I regret I could mention very little of the physical combinatorics of TBA quasi-particles,
work that I have carried on with P. Pearce and that would have required several additional pages.
Around 2006, I started to follow lectures and seminars delivered by people that, coming from a
theoretical physicist background, were starting to work on genome, proteins and cells. Two colleagues
of my laboratory, L. Frappat and P. Sorba, were working on a quantum group model for the genetic
code. I was curious: how can someone even think to apply quantum groups or let say integrable systems,
to the genetic code? Now I know that beyond the application of the apparatus of theoretical physics
to biology, it is important to find the new ideas, the new equations, the new models that are needed to
better capture the properties of biological systems. In the Part II of this text I will clarify this attitude,
especially with the motivations at page 81. After a series of lectures by M. Caselle, I started to experiment
with an evolutionary model based on Turing machines. The model, created by a colleague of mine, F.
Musso, and myself, will be presented in Chapter 5. Near the end of 2007, Paul Sorba was contacted by
a biologist interested in finding theoretical physicists for collaboration. This was an unusual request so
Paul organized a meeting with C. Lesieur, to listen to her researches and projects. I immediately accepted
to participate and the team “Gemini” was created. A few months later a regular collaboration was on,
especially after my primitive but successful attempts to use the art of computer programming to search
for the protein interfaces. The two projects on biophysics are now my main research activities, and the
time I dedicate to integrable systems has been considerably reduced.
I think the changes I made in my activities reflect more than a personal event and highlight the new
horizons theoretical physics is called to explore.

Introduction
The study of integrable models is the study of physical systems that are too elegant to be true but too
physical to be useless.
Take water in a shallow canal (φ is the wave amplitude) and you will find the known example of
the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV, formalized in 1895 but the first observation of solitary waves in a
canal dates to 1844 by J. Scott-Russel)
∂t φ + ∂x3 φ + 6φ∂x φ = 0.

(1.1)

This equation is nonlinear thus different waves are expected to interact each other. Its speciality is
that it admits “solitonic” solutions, namely wave packets in which each component emerges undistorted
after a scattering event. This rare property is similar to free waves motion, in which different wave
components move independently, but is dramatically broken when interactions are switched on, unless
there are some special constraints that forbid the distortion. For the sake of precision, notice that the
KdV equation has also “normal” dispersive waves. The wave propagation conserves an infinite number
of integrals of motion. This makes more clear the presence of the constraints that force the unusual
solitonic behaviour. It is a general theorem of Hamiltonian mechanics that if a (classical) system of
coordinates qi , pi , i = 1, . . . , N and Hamiltonian H(q, p) possesses N independent functions Ii (q, p)
such that
{H, Ii } = 0 = {Ii , Ij }
(1.2)
then there exist N angle-action variables φi , Ii . The Hamiltonian is a function of the Ii only H(Ii ) and
the equations of motion can be explicitly solved by just one integration. This is the origin of the name of
integrable models.
This theorem is lost when N → ∞ or for a quantum system, but somehow its “spirit” remains: the
presence of several integrals of motion, as is (1.2), over-constraints the scattering parameters of waves
or particles and special behaviours appear.
In 1 + 1 quantum field theory, this has been made precise by showing [2, 1] the absence of particle production and the factorization of the scattering matrix when there are at least two local conserved
charges that are integrals of Lorentz tensors of rank two or higher. This theorem has very strong consequences. It implies for example that the scattering is elastic, namely the set of incoming momenta
coincides with the set of outgoing momenta. As an example, the factorization is written here for a four
particles scattering

but the generalization is simple [2]. The sum goes over internal indices as in Figure 1.1.
The message is clear: an N particles scattering factorizes in N (N − 1)/2 two-particle interactions.
This means that a scattering event always decomposes into independent two-particle events, without

multi-particle effects. Internal indices can only appear when there are particles within the same mass
multiplet, otherwise the conservation of momenta forces the conservation of the type of particle i1 =
k1 = l1 = j1 and so on. This means that particle annihilation or creation are forbidden outside a mass
multiplet.
The factorization comes from the presence of higher rank integrals of motion and from the peculiar
property of a two-dimensional plane that non-parallel lines always meet [1]. In a Minkowski space,
integrals of motion that are integrals of Lorenz tensors act by parallel shifting trajectories. For example,
they parallel shift lines in Figure 1.1. In 1 + 1 dimensions, two non parallel straight trajectories will
always have a cross point but in higher dimensions a parallel movement can suppress the cross point.
This geometrical fact indicates that the constraints imposed in higher dimensions are stronger that in
1 + 1 and the theory will be a free one, as shown by Coleman and Mandula [4]. Therefore, factorization
is a very strong property that has no equal in a general field theory. The example of the sine-Gordon
model [2] will be presented later, in which the full S-matrix is known.
In order to construct a scattering formalism, we need to use asymptotic states namely we need the so
called IN states (t → −∞) and OUT states (t → ∞).
A two-particles scattering then takes the form

where it has been taken into account that Lorentz boosts shift rapidities1 of a constant amount so the
amplitude depends on the difference only.
By parallel shifting lines in Figure 1.1, it is possible to appreciate that there are two possible factorizations for a 3 → 3 particles scattering. Their consistency implies the following equation known as
Yang-Baxter equation or factorization equation

This equation characterizes quantum integrability. It first appeared in the lattice case as the star-triangle
relation obtained in the context of the Ising and six-vertex models (see for example [9]). In the lattice
context, scattering amplitudes are replaced by Boltzmann weights.
A fully general definition of integrable theories is difficult because integrable models are found in
a variety of cases and contexts from lattice models to continuum theories, from classical to quantum

dynamics. Therefore, rather than trying to give a general definition, I prefere to indicate the most relevant
features. Indeed, the three key ingredients of an integrable theory, both apparent in the KdV and in the
sine-Gordon case (see after), are:
P1 incoming parameters of waves or particles are left unchanged by the scattering event, apart for
time shifts,
P2 there are infinite integrals of motion in involution,
P3 a Yang-Baxter equation holds.
The first one expresses the conservation of the incoming momenta. The second characterization generalizes the original notion of integrability for classical Hamiltonian systems with finite degrees of freedom.
The third property expresses the mathematics of integrability.

1.1

The sine-Gordon model

The sine-Gordon model will be used here as a complete example of several “integrable” ideas. Later it
will be used to introduce the nonlinear integral equation of type Klümper-Pearce-Destri-de Vega.
The Lagrangian density is
L[φ] =

1
µ2
∂µ φ ∂ µ φ + 2 (cos βφ − 1)

β

(1.6)

and will be considered in 1+1 dimensions (signature of the metric (1, −1)). The corresponding equation
of motion is
∂2φ ∂2φ
µ2

sin βφ
(1.7)
∂t2

β
At small β this model appears as a deformation of the Klein-Gordon equation in which µ plays the role
of a mass. Expanding the cosinus function in the Lagrangian (or the sinus in the equations of motion)
the coupling β first appears with the fourth order term −βφ4 , while β = 0 is precisely the Klein-Gordon
equation. The sine-Gordon equation (1.7) admits solitonic solutions, satisfying property P1, that are
distinct in three types2
1. the solitons, characterized by φ(+∞, t) − φ(−∞, t) =
2. the antisolitons, φ(+∞, t) − φ(−∞, t) =

2π
β m,

2π
β m,

m > 0, integer;

m < 0, integer;

3. the breathers, with φ(+∞, t) = φ(−∞, t) = 0.
Solutions that combine an arbitrary number of these three elementary types do exist and they are all
known [3]. They all behave as indicated in property P1. Precisely for this reason, one can think the soliton
as an entity “in its own”: it is recognizable and well identified even if it participates to a multicomponent
wave.
The name, soliton or antisoliton, suggests that these two waves are distinct because they have opposite sign of the “topological charge”: φ(+∞, t) − φ(−∞, t). Having the breather zero topological
charge, it can be interpreted as a bound state of soliton and antisoliton.
The single soliton state at rest is
φs (x) =
2

4
atan exp(µx)
β

It is usual to interpret as equivalent those fields that differ by multiples of 2π/β.

13

(1.8)

and the single antisoliton
is simply given by φa = −φs . By Lorentz boost, the single soliton at speed u
√
2
is φs ((x − ut)/ 1 − u )
An example of soliton-antisoliton state is given by
sinh √µut
4
1−u2
φsa (x, t) = atan

β

(1.9)

This state is not the breather (see later). Indeed, at large |t| this state decomposes into a soliton and an
antisoliton solution travelling in opposite directions (and non bounded)

(1.10)

Notice that √
each wave maintains its initial speed, as indicated by property P1, just experiencing a phase
shift of −2 1 − u2 (log u)/u > 0, being 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. The phase shift is positive namely the two
interacting waves accelerate with respect to their asymptotic motion. This acceleration indicates an
attraction, consistently with the idea that solitons and antisolitons have opposite charge.
The simplest breather-like solution

(1.11)

is a time periodic solution that takes its name from the fact that it resembles a mouth that opens and
closes. Curiously, it can be formally obtained from the soliton-antisoliton state (1.9) by rotating to an
imaginary speed u → i u. This type of solution can be interpreted as a bound state of a soliton and an
antisoliton because it has zero topological charge and because the soliton and antisoliton can attract each
other. It is significantly different from the soliton-antisoliton state because, asymptotically, it does not
decompose into two infinitely separated wases as it does the soliton-antisoliton state (1.10).
Finally, the sine-Gordon model admits an infinite number of conserved integrals of motion in involution (property P2).
The sine-Gordon model discussed so far is strictly classical namely the field φ is a real function of
space and time. Nevertheless, the model can be quantized with fields becoming operators on an Hilbert
space leading to a scattering theory of quantum particles. Notice that the various solutions given so far
do not survive the limit β → 0 namely they aren’t perturbative solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation
(see after 1.7). The coupling β is not very important in the classical theory and could be removed by
redefinition of the field and the space-time coordinates. On the contrary, in the quantum theory, it will
play a true physical role.
In [5],[6],[7] some interesting steps of the quantization procedure are performed. In particular, the
need to remove ultraviolet divergences and the existence of a lower bound for the ground state energy
lead to observe that outside the range
0 ≤ β 2 ≤ 8π
(1.12)
the theory seems not well defined, missing a lower bond for the Hamiltonian. Within the range, the
theory describes two particles, charge conjugated, that carry the same name of the classical counterparts,
soliton and antisoliton, and other particles, corresponding to the breathers.
Within this interval, the theory shows up to coincide with the massive Thirring model, in the sector
of even number of solitons plus antisolitons (“even sector”):
L[ψ] = ψ̄iγµ ∂ µ ψ − mF ψ̄ψ −

1
g jµ j µ ,

14

with jµ = ψ̄γµ ψ

(1.13)

The equivalence of the two models is better stated by saying that they have the same correlation functions
in the even sector, provided the respective coupling constants are identified by
β2

=
4π
1 + g/π
Another useful coupling will be

(1.14)

β2

γ=

1−

(1.15)

β2
8π

Notice that there is no equivalence outside the even sector because the soliton does not correspond to the
fermion [10]: the transformation between the two is highly nonlocal. In other words, there are states of
sine-Gordon that do not exist in Thirring and vice versa.
The relation between the Thirring and sine-Gordon couplings reveals that the special point g = 0 or
β 2 = 4π describes a free massive Dirac theory. This free point separates two distinct regimes
repulsive − π2 < g < 0
attractive 0 < g < ∞

8π > β 2 > 4π
4π > β 2 > 0

∞ > γ > 8π
8π > γ > 0

(1.16)

The repulsive regime is so called because no bound state of the Thirring fermions or sine-Gordon bosons
is observed. Vice versa, in the attractive regime the quantum fields corresponding to the classical
breathers describe bound states between solitons and antisolitons. The attractive regime admits small
values of beta, where the theory is close to a φ4 theory (1.6) but with an unusual attractive sign

16

n = 1, 2, . . . , <

γ

(1.18)

where M is the mass of the soliton. In the repulsive regime, no integer is in the range, indicating that
breathers do not exist; this mass formula makes sense in the attractive regime only. The interpretation
of breathers as bound states comes also from the fact that the breather masses are below the threshold
Mn < 2M . These breathers originate in the quantization of the classical breather solutions and, from
(1.17), they correspond to the perturbation of the Klein-Gordon particles. Indeed, given that the soliton
mass at leading order is
8µ
M=
(1.19)
γ
the smallest breather mass M1 for in the weak coupling β 2 → 0 is
M1 = 2

8µ γ
=µ
γ 16

(1.20)

So, the lowest breather originates in the perturbation of the Klein-Gordon boson. Notice that the breather
is a bound state while the Klein-Gordon model has no bound states at all. This is true even for the nth
breather
Mn = n µ
(1.21)
so the Klein-Gordon free multiparticle states become bound states in sine-Gordon. Differently from the
breather, the soliton doesn’t emerge from the Klein-Gordon theory: its mass diverges in this limit (1.19)
so this particle is considered decoupled from the theory.
The relations (1.14, 1.16) indicate a strong/weak duality between sine-Gordon and Thirring: strong
interactions in one model correspond to weak interactions in the other. Can we see a physical track of
15

this? Yes, for example in the weak sine-Gordon regime β 2 → 0. Indeed, the nth breather appears to be a
bound state of n Klein-Gordon particles (1.21). It is a stable state that takes its stability from the strong
fermionic coupling g  0 of Thirring. Moving to higher values of β 2 , the fermionic coupling decreases
therefore we expect to have less and less stable breathers, consistently with the mass expression (1.18).
In the same weak regime β 2 → 0, the soliton is decoupled from the theory as it has an almost infinite
mass (1.19). It is strongly coupled in the repulsive regime where its mass is small.
The most important feature is that the quantum sine-Gordon model is still integrable. This was first
seen by showing that conservation laws do survive perturbative quantization. Now this result is known
beyond perturbation theory [8] and grants the already discussed necessary conditions for the factorization
of scattering (1.3). Thus, all the properties P1, P2, P3 hold.
Particle annihilation and creation are forbidden. Consequently, all the bound states in (1.18) are
stable particles even when there are breather states above the creation threshold Mn > 2 M1 . This
happens for some n and for sufficiently small γ. Notice that in the attractive regime the lowest breather
is always the lightest particle. Moving toward the repulsive regime, one observes that the nth breather
disappears into a soliton-antisoliton state when 8π/γ is a positive integer
lim

γ→( 8π
)−
n

(1.22)

Mn = 2 M

The lowest breather disappears at the free fermion point γ = 8π.
If one can show the existence of conserved charges as required in the factorization theorem, the two
particles scattering amplitudes can be evaluated on the basis of their symmetries. In other words, the
Yang-Baxter equation (1.5) supplemented with usual analytic properties (poles from mass spectrum),
unitarity and crossing symmetry, is (often) enough to find the scattering amplitudes. This avoids a much
more lengthy calculation based on the evaluation of Feynman diagrams to all orders. For the sine-Gordon
model, this has been done in [2].
The notation in (1.4) is now used to write down the amplitudes. For the solitonic part only, there are
three 2 → 2 particle processes
As + As → As + As
(1.23)

As + As̄ → As + As̄
As̄ + As̄ → As̄ + As̄

where As (As̄ ) indicates a soliton (antisoliton) momentum state. Charge conjugation symmetry makes
the first and the last processes to have identical amplitude. Using θ = θ1 − θ2 , we have
|As (θ1 )As (θ2 )iin = S(θ) |As (θ1 )As (θ2 )iout
|As (θ1 )As̄ (θ2 )iin = ST (θ) |As (θ1 )As̄ (θ2 )iout + SR (θ) |As̄ (θ1 )As (θ2 )iout

(1.24)

|As̄ (θ1 )As̄ (θ2 )iin = S(θ) |As̄ (θ1 )As̄ (θ2 )iout
There are just three independent amplitudes to be determined, that we organize in a 4 × 4 matrix to be
used in the Yang-Baxter equation (1.5)

S(θ)

ST (θ) SR (θ)
S=

SR (θ) ST (θ)





S(θ)

(1.25)

Notice that, in the Yang-Baxter equation, the conservation of the set of momenta forbids amplitudes
describing particles with different mass to mix each other. In sine-Gordon, there are just two particles
with identical mass, the soliton and the antisoliton, with interactions listed in (1.23). This means that the
16

scattering processes involving a breather do no mix with those in (1.23). As the breathers have different
mass, the following processes are of pure transmission, reflection being forbidden
As + Bn → As + Bn
(1.26)

As̄ + Bn → As̄ + Bn
Bm + Bn → Bm + Bn
The whole knowledge of the scattering amplitudes is not needed. The soliton part is given by

the six-vertex model.

1.2

The six-vertex model

It is a two dimensional classical statistical mechanics model in which interactions are associated with a
vertex: the four bonds surrounding a vertex fix the Boltzmann weight associated with it. In the present
model the possible vertices are those shown here:

1

2

3

4

6

A bond can therefore be in either one of two states, that will be indicated by “0” or “1” (0 associated to
up and right, 1 associated to down and left). Initially, this model was introduced as a two dimensional
idealization of an ice crystal and called ice-type model. Indeed, the vertex represents the oxygen atom
and the four bonds connected to it represent two covalent bonds and two hydrogen bonds. The arrows
indicate to which oxygen the hydrogen atom is closer, thus differentiating the covalent bonds from the
hydrogen bonds.
The Boltzmann weights for a vertex are nonnegative values indicated by w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 .
Hereafter I will put w1 = w2 = a, w3 = w4 = b and w5 = w6 = c, as in [9]. Their product on the whole
lattice vertices is summed on all the configurations to build up the partition function
Z=

(1.28)

conf

where Ni is the number of occurrences of the type i vertex in the lattice. Periodic boundary conditions
will now be uses in the vertical and horizontal directions. The expression for the partition function takes
a useful form if one introduces the transfer matrix and the so called R matrix. The transfer matrix T is a
2N × 2N matrix that describes how the system “evolves” from a row to the next one of the lattice. The
R matrix somehow summarizes the possible behaviours on a single vertex or lattice site. On a given row,
the vertical bond at site i is associated with a local vector space Vi = C2 . Also, A represents an auxiliary
17

space A = C2 . The R matrix is a 4 × 4 matrix acting on A ⊗ Vi (or else on A ⊗ A)

where the lower line indicates how the entries are interpreted with respect to the two possible bond

where the trace is taken on the auxiliary space A3 . The partition function can be written as the trace of
the product of M transfer matrices (if M is the number of rows of the lattice)
(1.31)

Z = Tr TM

having now taken the trace on V, namely on all the horizontal sites. It turns out that if the Boltzmann
weights have an appropriate form, the transfer matrix generates an integrable system. The following
parametrization makes the game
a = a(θ) = sinh

γ6v
(θ + iπ),
π

b = b(θ) = sinh

γ6v

π

c = c(θ) = i sin γ6v

(1.32)

and gives an R matrix function of the spectral parameter4 θ, R(θ), and also of the coupling γ6v . The
R matrix satisfies a Yang-Baxter equation (see later).
It turns out that this parametrization is very much the same as in (1.27), except for the identification
of the couplings that requires some care and will be done later. This means that the integrable sineGordon model and the six-vertex model have something in common. Anticipating a later discussion, one
can use the six-vertex model for a lattice regularization of the sine-Gordon. In other words, sine-Gordon
appears as a certain continuum limit of the six-vertex model, provided a mass scale is introduced.
The disadvantage of the parametrization (1.32) is that is introduces complex Boltzmann weights
and this looks odd in statistical mechanics. However, this is not a serious problem, first because the
statements that concern integrability do hold for arbitrary complex parameters, second because it is easy
to get a real transfer matrix, simply by using an imaginary value for θ.
The Yang-Baxter equation satisfied by the R matrix (1.32) is
R12 (λ − µ)R13 (λ)R23 (µ) = R23 (µ)R13 (λ)R12 (λ − µ)

(1.33)

where λ, µ are arbitrary complex spectral parameters. Thus, property P3 above also holds for the lattice
case. From this equation, a very general construction shows that the transfer matrix forms a commuting
family
[T(θ), T(θ0 )] = 0
(1.34)
3
Here, the standard notation of of lattice integrable systems is used such that the lower indices of the matrix do not indicate
its entries but the spaces on which the matrix acts (namely the auxiliary space and one of the horizontal lattice sites, enumerated
fro 1 to N ).
4
The spectral parameter is a complex number that is used to describe a sort of off-shell physics; usually it is fixed to a
specific value or interval to construct a physical model.

for arbitrary values of the spectral parameters. Now, any expansion of the transfer matrix produces
commuting objects. In particular, it is possible to evaluate the logarithmic derivative of the transfer
matrix

and all the higher derivatives. The operators obtained with this procedure are local and commutative
therefore we conclude that property P2 is satisfied for the lattice model. The logarithmic derivative is
manageable, at least for the six-vertex model, and leads to a very interesting expression (the overall factor

∆ = cos γ6v

The σij , j = 1, 2, 3 are Pauli matrices acting on the site i, where, by definition, different site matrices
always commute. This one-dimensional lattice quantum Hamiltonian is known as XXZ model. The
more general version with three different coefficients and three spatial dimensions was introduced by
W. Heisenberg (1928) as a natural physical description of magnetism in solid state physics. Indeed, the
Heisenberg idea was to consider, on each lattice site, a quantum magnetic needle of spin 12 fully free
to rotate. The magnetic needle is assumed sensitive to the nearest neighbor needles with the simplest
possible coupling of magnetic dipoles. At γ6v = 0 it is fully isotropic with rotational su(2) symmetry.
As soon as γ6v 6= 0 is introduced, the model acquires an anisotropy.
The XXX Hamiltonian is free of couplings apart from the overall sign. Given the present sign choice,
it is apparent that adjacent parallel spins lower the energy. This explains the name “ferromagnetic”
attributed to the Hamiltonian in (1.36), if ∆ = 1. The Hamiltonian with opposite sign is known as
“antiferromagnetic”.
The presence of ∆ 6= 1 in the XXZ model spoils this distinction because the ferromagnetic or
antiferromagnetic behavior depends by the coupling and the name cannot be attached to the Hamiltonian
itself but to the phases it describes. The phases of the two models are indicated in table 1.1.
Finally, as the XXZ model is embedded in XYZ, the six-vertex is embedded in the more general
eight-vertex model, that is still integrable.
The XXZ model is presented in the review [14] and also in the book [15].

1.2.1

The Baxter T-Q relation

The one-dimensional XXZ model has the merit of having inaugurated the studies of quantum integrable
systems and of the methods known as Bethe ansatz, in the celebrated Bethe paper [12].
19

Indeed, his idea was to try to guess, or ansatz, the appropriate eigenfunctions for the Hamiltonian
(1.36), from a trial form, then show that the guess is correct. This approach is called coordinate Bethe
ansatz and produces a set of constraints on the parameters of the wave function known as Bethe equations.
Baxter [9], from the Bethe equations, was able to show the existence of a T-Q relation (3.6) for the
transfer matrix. After, he could reverse the approach and, with a more direct construction, he derived the
T-Q relation from the Yang-Baxter equation. Therefore, he obtained the Bethe equations from the T-Q
relation. The presentation will follow the second approach.
Following Baxter, the transfer matrix satisfies a functional equation [9] for periodic boundary conditions on a row of N sites. This means that there exist a matrix Q(u) such that

The coupling and spectral parameters are related to the previous ones by

(1.38)

(1.39)

The new operator Q(u) forms a family of matrices that commute each other and with the transfer matrix
[Q(u), Q(v)] = [Q(u), T (v)] = 0. This implies that the same functional equation (1.37) holds true
also for the eigenvalues T (u) and Q(u). Moreover, all these operators have the same eigenvectors
independent of u. The eigenvalues of Q are given by
Q(u) =

M
Y

sin(u − uj )

(1.40)

j=1

where uj are the Bethe roots and appear now as zeros of the eigenvalues of Q(u). The Bethe ansatz
equations result by imposing that the transfer matrix eigenvalues on the left are entire functions. Indeed,
when Q(u) = 0, being T (u) entire, the right hand side must vanish. This forces the constraints (Bethe
equations)
 !N
sin u + λ2
Q(u + λ)

(1.41)
λ

sin u − 2
The T-Q relation (1.37) shows that the columns of Q(u) are eigenvectors of T so this equation actually
provides both information on eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
The Bethe equations have a finite number of solutions in the periodicity strip
Re(u) ∈ [0, π]

(1.42)

This is easily seen because they can be transformed into algebraic equations in the new variables
zj = exp(i uj )
Notice that the lattice model also has a finite number of states: indeed,
dim V = 2N
This is the size of the transfer matrix and is also the number of expected solutions of the Bethe equations.
Indeed, it has been possible to show that the Bethe equations have the correct number of solutions and
that the corresponding Bethe eigenvectors form a base for V, see [22], [23] and references there. This is
referred to as the “completeness” of the Bethe ansatz. One feature observed is that Bethe roots satisfy
a Pauli-like principle, in the sense that they are all distinct: there is no need to consider solutions with
uj = uk for different j 6= k.
20

1.3

Conformal field theories

Conformal field theories (CFT) are scale invariant quantum field theories. They were introduced for two
main reasons, one being the study of continuum phase transitions and the other being the interest of
describing quantum strings on their world sheet, a two-dimensional surface in a ten-dimensional space.
This second point strongly motivated the treatment of the two dimensional case, initiated in the fundamental work [16]. Curiously, the subsequent development of the two-dimensional case, instead, was
much more statistical mechanics oriented. Two-dimensional conformal field theories are very close to
the subject of quantum integrability because they also are integrable theories and, often, they appear in
certain limits of lattice or continuum integrable theories. These topics and some connections between
conformal field theory and integrability will be discussed later, in relation to several of the investigations
that I have carried on: nonlinear Destri-de Vega equations, thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations and
so on.
Four-dimensional conformal field theories are studied in the Maldacena gauge/string duality framework. In particular, the superconformal gauge theory N = 4 appears in relation to some integrable
theories, after the work [17]. In particular, in that paper the XXX model appeared. As the paper [16]
created the bridge between integrable models and two-dimensional field theories, [17] inaugurated the
interchange between (some) aspects of integrable models and four-dimensional superconformal field
theories.
In the two-dimensional case, the generators of the conformal symmetry are the modes of the Virasoro
algebra (V)
c
[Lm , Ln ] = (m − n)Lm+n + (m3 − m)δm+n,0
(1.43)
12
where the constant c that appears in the central extension term is called conformal anomaly or often
central charge. For a physical theory on the Minkowski plane or on a cylinder geometry in which the
space is periodic and the time flows in the infinite direction, the algebra of the full conformal group is the
tensor product of two copies of (1.43) V ⊗ V̄. For other geometries, it can be different. For example, on
a strip (finite space, infinite time) there is a single copy. According to this, the Hamiltonian is L0 + L̄0
for the plane or cylinder and is L0 in a strip. We need this distinction because, later on, we will use both
types of space-time. Somehow, the presence of two copies in the plane and in the cylinder with periodic
space is justified because there are two types of movers: left and right movers, namely massless particles
moving at the speed of light toward left or right5 . In a strip, corresponding to a finite space with spatial
borders, movement is not allowed, thus just one copy remains.
All the states of a CFT must lie in some irreducible representation of the algebra (1.43). Physical
representations must have the Hamiltonian spectrum bounded from below, i.e. they must contain a so
called highest weight state (HWS) |∆i for which
L0 |∆i = ∆|∆i

,

Ln |∆i = 0

,

n>0

(1.44)

These representations are known as highest weight representations (HWR). The irreducible representations of V are labelled by two numbers, namely the central charge c and the conformal dimension ∆. We
shall denote the HWRs of V by Vc (∆). For a given theory, the Hilbert space H of the theory is built up
of all possible representations Vc (∆) with the same c, each one with a certain multiplicity:
H=

are not fixed by conformal invariance alone as they depend on the geometry and on possible boundary
conditions.
Every HWS (1.44) in the theory can be put in one-to-one correspondence with a field through the for¯ = A ¯ (0, 0)|0, 0i, where the vacuum |0, 0i is projective (i.e. L0 , L̄0 , L±1 , L̄±1 ) invariant.
mula |∆, ∆i

They are called primary fields. Non primary fields (secondaries) do have much more involved transformations. A basis for the states can be obtained by applying strings of Ln , n < 0 to |∆i. The commutation
relations imply
L0 Lkn |∆i = (∆ + nk)Lkn |∆i
(1.47)
Therefore L0 eigenvalues organize the space Vc (∆) (called a module) so that the states lie on a “stair”

one, c = 12 , is the universality class of the Ising model. The next one c = 10

Potts model and so. The limit p → ∞ is also a CFT; it is one point of the class of the free massless boson
with c = 1.
Indeed, c = 1 is a wide class of unitary conformal field theories, all derived from a free massless
boson compactified in the following way
φ ≡ φ + 2πmR ,

and radially quantized. A full description of this theory would be very long. A sketch is presented in
[20]. The theory turns out to be characterized by certain vertex operators

Each pair (n, m) describes a different sector of the theory; its states are obtained by the action of the
modes of the fields, ∂z φ and ∂¯z φ̄, in a standard Fock space construction.
It is important to stress that a particular c = 1 CFT is specified by giving the spectrum of the quantum
numbers (n, m) (and the compactification radius R) such that the corresponding set of vertex operators
(and their descendants) forms a closed and local operator algebra. The locality requirement is equivalent
22

to the fact that the operator product expansions of any two such local operators is single-valued in the
complex plane of z.
By this requirement of locality, it was proved in [33] that there are only two maximal local subalgebras of vertex operators: Ab , purely bosonic, generated by the vertex operators
V(n, m) : n, m ∈ Z

(1.52)

and Af , fermionic, generated by

Other sets of vertex operators can be built, but the product of two of them gives a nonlocal expression

Perturbed conformal field theory

We may think to define a quantum field theory as a deformation of a conformal field theory by some
operators [51], i.e. to perturb the action of a CFT as in the following expression
Z
n
X
S[Φi ] = SCF T +
λi d2 x Φi (x)
(1.54)
i=1

Of course, the class of two-dimensional field theories is larger than the one described by this action.
Nevertheless, this class of perturbed conformal field theories has a special role because it describes the
23

vicinity of critical points in the theory of critical phenomena. The main goal is to be able to compute
off-critical correlation functions by
Z
Z
Z


−S[Φ]
hXi = Dϕ Xe
= Dϕ X exp − SCF T − λ d2 x Φ(x)
(1.55)
Indeed, expanding in powers of λ one can express hXi as a series of conformal correlators (in principle
computable by conformal field theory techniques). The perturbed theory is especially important if it
maintains the integrability of the conformal point. If so, the perturbed theory has a factorized scattering.
The possible perturbing fields are classified with respect to their renormalization group action as
• relevant if ∆ < 1. If such a field perturbs a conformal action, it creates exactly the situation
described above, i.e. the theory starts to flow along a renormalization group trajectory going to
some IR destiny.
• irrelevant if ∆ > 1. Such fields correspond to perturbations which describe the neighborhood of
non trivial IR fixed points. It is more appropriate to refer to them as attraction fields because the
perturbation is not able to move off the critical point; it actually always returns to it. We shall not
deal with this case in the following, but the interested reader may consult, for example, [18] to see
some possible applications of this situation.
• marginal if ∆ = 1. Their classification requires investigation of derivatives of the beta function.

Conclusion

A typical phenomenon of integrable systems emerges, namely the fact that different models can transform
the one into the other in some conditions and also shown to be equivalent. Firstly, the equivalence of
the bosonic sine-Gordon model with the fermionic massive Thirring has been presented. After, the
correspondence of the six-vertex model and the XXZ model has been shown. Moreover, these lattice
models share the same R or S matrix as the sine-Gordon model. At this point, it is natural to expect that a
proper continuum limit on the six-vertex model could produce sine-Gordon; indeed, this is the case and
will be discussed later in the context of the nonlinear integral equation. This “game” of models that are
related one to the other can be pushed forward. For example, if ∆ = 0, the XXZ model reduces to the
XX model, that can also be written as a lattice free fermion (one fermionic species). If ∆ → ±∞, one
obtains the one-dimensional Ising model. More important for what follows, the XXX model emerges in
the high coupling limit of the Hubbard model, that is a lattice quantum model of two fermionic species
(namely, spin up, spin down).
The deep reason of these strong connections between different models is that, for a given size of the
R matrix, there are very few solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. In other words, there are very few
classes of integrability, classified by the solution of the Yang-Baxter equation.

2.1

Light-cone lattice

In this section I present a lattice regularization of the Sine-Gordon model which is particularly suitable
to study finite size effects. It is well known to lattice theorists that the same continuum theory can often
be obtained as limit of many different lattice theories. This means that there are many possible regularizations of the same theory and it is customary to choose the lattice action possessing the properties
that best fit calculational needs. In the present context the main goal is to have a lattice discretization
of the Sine-Gordon model that preserves the property of integrability. The following light-cone lattice
construction is a way (not the unique!) to achieve this goal.
In two dimensions, the most obvious approach would be to use a rectangular lattice with axes corresponding to space and time directions. Here, a different approach [19] is adopted where space-time is
discretized along light-cone directions. Light-cone coordinates in Euclidean or Minkowski space-time
are
x+ = x + t , x− = x − t
(2.1)
When discretized, they define a light-cone lattice of “events” as in figure 2.1. Then, any rational and not

greater than 1 value is permitted as particle speed, in an infinite lattice. The shortest displacement of the
particle (one lattice spacing) is realized at light speed ±1 and corresponds, from the statistical point of
view, to nearest neighbors interactions. Particles are therefore massless and can be right-movers (R) or
left-movers (L) only. Smaller speeds can be obtained with displacements longer than the fundamental
cell and correspond to higher neighbors interactions. They will not be used here. With only nearest
neighbor interactions, the evolution from one row to the next one, as in figure 2.1, is governed by a
25

transfer matrix. Here there are four of them. Two act on the light-cone, UR and UL , the first one shifting
the state of the system one step forward-right, the other one step forward-left. The remaining U and V 2
act in time and space directions respectively
V 2 = e−i α P = UR UL†

U = e−i α H = UR UL ,

(2.2)

so they actually correspond to the Hamiltonian (forward shift) and the total momentum (right shift).
Their action is pictorially suggested in figure 2.2. Also, the relations hold

(2.4)

where the operators Li are associated to a vertex. To remove ambiguity, one has to associate odd numbers
to the lower vertex, even numbers to the upper vertex, compare with Figure 2.1. Θ for the moment
is a free parameter. Its presence corresponds to make the lattice model inhomogeneous such that the
interaction on each site is tuned by the presence of the inhomogeneity. This does not change integrability.
The standard construction of (1.30) suggest to take
Li (θ) = RAi (θ)

(2.5)

using the R matrix of the six-vertex model (1.32). The forward-right and the forward-left operators are
obtained by
UR = T(Θ, Θ, γ6v ) ,
UL = T(−Θ, Θ, γ6v )
(2.6)
One can interpret these expressions by noticing that to switch from a right mover to a left mover one has
to change the sign of rapidity. The transfer matrices depend on Θ and on the coupling γ6v , whose values
are not yet specified. The methods of Bethe ansatz can be used to diagonalize these operators as in the
subsection 1.2.1. The specific case is treated in [21] and gives the following results. The eigenvalues of

called “quasiparticles”. Quasiparticles are usually distinct from physical particles. They are degrees of
freedom that do not appear in the Hamiltonian (1.35) but are “created” by the Bethe ansatz and incorporate the effects of the interactions. Indeed, their dispersion relation is not Galilean nor relativistic1 .
Quasiparticles can have complex “rapidities”.
With this quasiparticle nature of Bethe roots in mind, the left hand side of the Bethe equations (2.8)
is precisely the jth momentum term that one can extract from (2.14). The right hand side represents the
interaction of pairs of quasi-particles.
In this Bethe ansatz description, the third component of the spin is given by
Sz = N − M

(2.16)

where the reference state for the algebraic Bethe ansatz is taken with all spins up or all spins down and
it is described by M = 0 in (2.8): it is the ferromagnetic state. Then, every Bethe root corresponds to
overturning a spin: it is a “magnon”, because it carries a unit of “magnetization”. It is also called spin
wave. It is the smallest “excitation” of the ferromagnetic state. When M = N , all roots are real and one
has the antiferromagnetic state, that is an ordered state with zero total spin but with a nontrivial local spin
organization. Here, with the present sign conventions, it is also the ground state. Its actual expression
is complicated. Just to give an idea of what it can look like, in the simplest case of an homogeneous
(Θ = 0) XXX (γ6v = 0) model for a two-site chain it is
| ↑↓i − | ↓↑i

(2.17)

| ↑↑↓↓i + | ↓↑↑↓i + | ↓↓↑↑i + | ↓↑↑↓i − 2(| ↑↓↑↓i + | ↓↑↓↑i)

(2.18)

while for four sites it is

Excitations of the antiferromagnetic state are: (1) “real Bethe holes”, namely real positions corresponding to real roots in the antiferromagnetic state but excluded in the excitation, (2) complex roots.
In what follows, only the antiferromagnetic ground state and its excitations will be considered, because it has one important property: in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ it can be interpreted as a Dirac
sea and the its excitations, holes and complex roots, behave as particles.
For later convenience, the coupling constant γ6v is expressed in terms of a different variable p:
π

0<p<∞

and I will work in the range of 0 < γ6v < π. Notice that, in (1.36) and in table 1.1, this is the choice that
corresponds to the critical regime. In this new parameter, the strip becomes

A nonlinear integral equation from the Bethe ansatz

In this section the fundamental nonlinear integral equation driving sine-Gordon scaling functions will be
presented. In the literature it is known with several names, following the different formulations that have
been done: Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce equation or Destri-de Vega equation. It has also been indicated
with the nonspecific tetragram NLIE (nonlinear integral equation). It was first obtained in [24] for the
vacuum (antiferromagnetic ground state) scaling functions of XXZ then, with different methods, in [25]
for XXZ and sine-Gordon. I will follow the Destri-de Vega approach applied to the sine-Gordon model.
The treatment of excited states was pioneered in [26] and refined in [27, 28], to arrive to the final
form in [29, 20].
It is important to stress that this formalism is equivalent to the Bethe equations but is especially
indicated to the antiferromagnetic regime. In general, it adapts to regimes where the number of Bethe
roots is of the order of the size of the system. Indeed, the key idea is to sum up a macroscopically large
number of Bethe roots for the ground state or for the reference state and replace them by a small number
of holes to describe deviations near the reference state, as holes in a Dirac sea.

2.2.1

Counting function

First, it is possible to write the Bethe equations (2.11) in terms of a counting function ZN (ϑ). I introduce
the function
1
sinh p+1
(iπν + ϑ)
φν (ϑ) = i log
,
φν (−ϑ) = −φν (ϑ)
1
sinh p+1 (iπν − ϑ)
The “oddity” on the analyticity strip around the real axis defines a precise logarithmic determination.
The counting function is defined by
ZN (ϑ) = N [φ1/2 (ϑ + Θ) + φ1/2 (ϑ − Θ)] −

M
X

φ1 (ϑ − ϑk )

(2.23)

k=1

The logarithmic form of the Bethe equations (2.11) takes now a simple form in terms of the counting
function
ZN (ϑj ) = 2πIj ,

Ij ∈ Z +

1+δ
,
2

δ = (M )mod 2 = (N − Sz )mod 2 ∈ {0, 1}

(2.24)

Notice that the counting function is not independent of the Bethe roots. Said differently, one cannot
separate the construction of ZN and the solution of (2.24). Now it is possible to give a formal definition
of “holes”: they are solutions of (2.24) that do not appear in (2.23). I will not make use of nonreal holes.
Bethe roots and holes are zeros of the equation
1 + (−1)δ eiZN (ϑj ) = 0

(2.25)

once the counting function is known. More, they are simple zeros because Bethe roots/holes exclude
each other.

2.2.2

Classification of Bethe roots and counting equation

From Bethe Ansatz it is known that a solution of (2.11), namely a Bethe state, is uniquely characterized
by the set of quantum numbers {Ij }j=1,...,M , 0 ≤ M ≤ N that appear in (2.24). Notice that M ≤ N
means S ≥ 0.
Bethe roots can either be real or appear in complex conjugate pairs. Complex conjugate pairs grant
the reality of the energy, momentum and transfer matrix. In the specific case (2.8), there is another
possibility, due to the periodicity (2.9): if a complex solution has imaginary part Im ϑ = π2 (p + 1), it
29

can appear alone (its complex conjugate is not required). A root with this value of the imaginary part is
called self-conjugate root.
From the point of view of the counting function, a more precise classification of roots is required:
• real roots; they are real solutions of (2.24); their number is MR ;
• holes; real solutions of (2.24) that do appear in the ground state but not in the excitation under
examination; in practice, they are real of (2.24) that do not enter in the counting function (2.23);
their number is NH ;
• special roots or holes (special objects); they are real roots or holes whose counting function deriva0 (ϑ ) is negative, contrasted with normal roots or holes, whose derivative is positive; their
tive ZN
j
number is NS ; they must be counted both as “normal” and as “special” objects;
• close pairs; complex conjugate solutions with imaginary part in the range 0 < |Im ϑ| < π min(1, p);
this range is dictated by the first singularity (essential singularity) of the function φ1 (θ), when
moving of the real axis; their number is MC ;
• wide roots in pairs: complex conjugate solutions with imaginary part belonging to the range
π min(1, p) < |Im ϑ| < π p+1
2 namely after the first singularity of φ1 (θ);
• self-conjugate roots: complex roots with imaginary part Im ϑ = π p+1
2 ; they are wide roots but
miss the complex conjugate so they are single; their number is MSC .
The total number of wide roots appearing in pairs or as single is MW . The following notation will be
used, sometimes, for later convenience, to indicate the position of the solutions: hj for holes, yj for
special objects, cj for close roots, wj for wide roots.
Complex roots with imaginary part larger than the self-conjugates are not required because of the
periodicity of Bethe equations (2.10). A graphical representation of the various types of solutions is
given in figure 2.3.
The function ZN (2.23) has a number of branch point singularities produced by the presence of the
logarithms. The largest horizontal strip containing the real axis and free of singularities is bounded by
the singularities of the various terms φν (ϑ). The strip is at the largest size when no complex roots are
introduced, otherwise it is narrower because the imaginary part of the complex roots in φν (ϑ − ϑk )
displaces the position of the singularities.
An important property follows from this classification: the ZN function is real analytic in a strip that
contains the real axis
ZN (ϑ∗ ) = (ZN (ϑ))∗
(2.26)
By considering asymptotic values of φν (ϑ) and ZN (ϑ) for ϑ → ±∞, it is possible to obtain an
equation relating the numbers of all the various types of roots. I refer the reader interested in the details
of the derivation to [27, 20]. Here I only mention the final result, in the form where the continuum limit
N → ∞, a → 0 and L = N a finite, has already been taken
NH − 2NS = 2Sz + MC + 2 θ(p − 1) MW

(2.27)

where θ(x) is the step function: θ(x) = 0 for x < 0 and θ(x) = 1 for x > 0. Recall that Sz is a
nonnegative integer and the right hand side only contains nonnegative values. From this, it turns out that
NH is even (MC is the number of close roots, and is even). This counting equation expresses the fact
that the Bethe equations have a finite number of solutions only. There are also other constraints, once N
is fixed:
Sz ≤ N ,
M C + MW ≤ N ,
NH ≤ N.

6v
Close roots are located within the blue lines, wide roots lie outside. The holes are indicated
by the circles on the real axis.
Moreover, the various types of roots/holes do respect the mutual exclusion principle. This means that, in
order to accommodate complex roots, one has to “create” space by inserting holes, or vice versa.
Notice also that in the attractive regime the wide roots do not participate to the counting and that at
the free fermion point p = 1, or β 2 = 4π, they do exist as self-conjugate only, namely there are no wide
roots in pairs. This suggests that the role of wide roots is different in the two regimes.
The most important fact is that the number of real roots does not appear in this equation: they have
been replaced by the number of holes. This, together to what will be explained in the next paragraph,
allows to consider the real roots as a sea of particles, or Dirac sea, and all other types of solutions, holes
and complex roots, as excitations above it.

is a modification of the source term due to the analytic continuation over the strip 0 < |Im ϑ| <
π min{1, p}, i.e. in the so called II determination region.
Such equation, together with the quantization condition (2.24), is equivalent to the original Bethe
Ansatz (2.8). The NLIE for ZN is not independent of the Bethe roots: it and the quantization conditions
must be solved at the same time. Once the Bethe roots are known, one can use them into eqs.(2.13) to
compute the energy and momentum of a given state.

2.2.4

Continuum limit

Although such NLIE is already a precious tool for the lattice model itself, its importance becomes essential when a continuum limit is done.
The continuum limit has the objective to transform a lattice system into a continuum model. As
already mentioned, one has to take the lattice size N → ∞ (that would be the normal thermodynamic
limit of statistical mechanics) and the lattice edge α → 0 simultaneously, in such a way that the product
L = N α stays finite. In this way one obtain a continuum theory with finite size space, namely a
cylindrical geometry. However, the lattice spacing is not present in the Boltzmann weights and in the
transfer matrix (2.4, 1.32) so we have no way to use it. Moreover, one can convince himself, by explicit
calculations, that if the limit is taken by keeping the Θ parameter fixed, the lattice NLIE blows up
to infinity and looses meaning. This reflects the fact that the number of roots increases as N in the
thermodynamic limit. However, as shown in ref.[19], if one assumes a dependence of Θ on N of the
form
4N
Θ ≈ log
.
(2.34)
ML
it is possible to get a finite limit out of the lattice NLIE. This limit is exactly the one that was used
in [19] to bring a lattice fermion field into the Thirring fermion field on the continuum. Notice that
sending Θ → ∞ in this way naturally introduces a renormalized physical mass M. This is the deep
reason of the use of the light-cone lattice and of the inhomogeneity in (2.4). In other words, without
the inhomogeneity, the continuum system would be a critical one, massless, with central charge c = 1
([24]).

The parameter δ can be both 0 or 1. On the lattice it was determined by the total number of roots, which

state, corresponds to the choice δ = 0.

With a procedure analogous to the one sketched above, it is possible to produce integral expressions
for energy and momentum. Starting from (2.13), one has to isolate an extensive term, proportional to N ,
to be subtracted. The remaining finite part of energy and momentum takes the form

Therefore, energy and momentum can be evaluated once the counting function Z(ϑ) and the source
positions ϑj have been obtained from (2.36, 2.38). All these equations are exact, no approximation has
been introduced in deriving them.
In practice, these equations can be treated analytically in certain limits (l → 0 or l → ∞) and
numerically for intermediate values, where we actually lack a closed formula for them. Numerical computations are done without any approximation other than the technical ones introduced by the computer
truncations. In calculations, one starts from an initial guess for the counting function, Z (0) (ϑ), uses it in
(2.38) to get the roots/holes positions then evaluates a new Z (1) (ϑ) from (2.36) and so on, up to the required precision. This iterative procedure is conceptually very simple and inclined to good convergence,
as one can easily estimate. Indeed, the following term appears within integration
eiZ(x+iη) ≈ eiZ−η l cosh x

(2.41)

The presence of a negative cosh at the exponent makes the support of the integral compact and the integral
itself subdominant with respect to all the other terms, speeding up the convergence of the iteration,
especially for large l.
So, at least for the cases where holes only are considered, and no complex roots or no special roots,
finding numerical solutions can be quite easy. The whole procedure takes few seconds of computing on
a typical Linux/Intel platform without resorting to any supercomputer or other technically advanced tool.
When complex roots are present, things are much more complicated and the computation time increases dramatically. Also, convergence at small l can be problematic because those real roots or holes
that are closer to the origin can become “special”. In practice, they emanate one or two “supplementary”
sources in consequence of a local change of sign of Z 0 (x). They have not been extensively treated. A
similar phenomenon has been discussed in [56], in the frame of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz.
The limit procedure described here is mathematically consistent, but the question is if from the
physical point of view it describes a consistent quantum theory and allows for a meaningful physical
interpretation.
The first indication comes from the emergence, in [19], of the fermionic massive Thirring fields from
the six-vertex diagonal alternating lattice of section 2.1. This indicates that the procedure points toward
a sine-Gordon/massive Thirring model.
Before going on, an important remark must be made about the allowed values for the XXZ spin Sz .
From (2.16), only nonnegative integer values can be given to Sz .
As shown in [30], one is led to include also the half-integer choice for Sz , in order to describe the
totality of the spectrum. This choice seems not justified on the light-cone lattice of section 2.1 because
it would require adding one column of points to the lattice, thus spoiling periodicity. Most probably the
way to introduce it would be by inserting a twist in the seam or some other nontrivial boundary condition.
34

In any case, half-integer values for Sz are necessary and seem fully consistent with the rest of the model
to describe odd numbers of particles.
At this point the following physical scenario appears.
1. The physical vacuum, or ground state, of the continuum theory comes from the antiferromagnetic
state of the lattice so is characterized by the absence of sources, holes or complex roots.
2. All the sources are excitations above this vacuum.
3. This theory describes at least the sine-Gordon and the massive Thirring model on a cylinder; the
circumference describes a finite space of size L; the infinite direction is time Sz is the topological
charge and can take nonnegative integer or half-integer values.
4. This theory describes also states that are not in sine-Gordon or in massive Thirring.
As already observed, the real roots have disappeared from the counting equation in the continuum
limit. They actually become a countable set and are taken into account by the integral term, both in the
NLIE and in the energy-momentum expressions. They can be interpreted as a sort of Dirac sea on which
holes and complex roots build particle excitations. Of course, the presence of holes or complex roots
distorts the Dirac sea too, through the source term g(ϑ|ϑj ).
Observe that it has been indicated that only nonnegative values of Sz are required to describe the
whole Hilbert space of the theory. Indeed the lattice theory is assumed charge-conjugation invariant
so negative values of Sz , namely states with negative topological charge, have the same energy and
momentum as their charge conjugate states.
The assumption that all the sine-Gordon and all massive Thirring states can be described by the
NLIE is absolutely not trivial and still misses a mathematical proof even if all the analyses done so far
are consistent with this assumption.

2.2.5

The infrared limit of the NLIE and the particle scattering

The first task in order to understand the physics underlying the NLIE is to characterize the scattering of
the model, by reconstructing the S-matrix. As we started from an integrable model, we assume that the
continuum one remains integrable. We will find that this hypothesis is extremely reasonable because it
is related to the structure of the source term g(θ|θi ). Indeed, the function χ can be written as
χ(ϑ) = −i log S(ϑ)

(2.42)

where S(ϑ) is the soliton-soliton scattering amplitude in sine-Gordon theory 1.27, if the parameters are
fixed as in (2.19). This means that the exponentiation of the source (2.37) term is the product of several
sine-Gordon two-particle scattering amplitudes, as it appears in the factorization theorem.
One has to remember that the theory has been constructed on a cylinder therefore the connection
with the factorization theorem can emerge only in the limit where the circumference becomes infinite.
In this limit, the cylinder becomes indistinguishable from a plane. Here the only external parameter is
the adimensional “size” l = ML. It will be pushed to infinity l → ∞. This can be interpreted as a very
large volume or a very large mass, thus explaining the name of infrared limit (IR).
In this limit, the integral terms in (2.36) and in (2.39, 2.40) vanish exponentially fast, so they can be
dropped and one remains with the momentum and the source term. Indeed, one can estimate that
log(1 + (−1)δ eiZ(x+iη) ) ≈ log(1 + (−1)δ eiZ−η l cosh x ) ≈ (−1)δ eiZ−η l cosh x

(2.43)

The presence of a negative cosh at the exponent produces an exponentially fast decay for large l in the
integral terms.

S(hk − hj ) = ±1

which is the energy of NH free particles of mass M. The identification with the particular element
S(θ) of the S-matrix forces to give to these solitons a topological charge Q = +1 each, which is consistent with the interpretation that Q = 2Sz . An analogous interpretation is possible in terms of pure
antisolitons, reflecting the charge conjugation invariance of the theory.
When considering two holes and a complex pair, the source terms can be arranged, thanks to some
identities satisfied by the functions χ, in the form
Z(ϑi ) = l sinh (ϑi ) − i log S+ (ϑi − ϑj ) = 2πIj , i , j = 1, 2
where

which is the scattering amplitude of a soliton on an antisoliton in the parity-even channel. The quantum
numbers I+ , I− of the two complex roots are constrained to be I± = ∓ 12 for consistency of the IR limit.
This state has Sz = 0, with topological charge Q = 0.
There is an analogous parity-odd channel in singe-Gordon [2], with an S− amplitude. It is realized
by the state with two holes and a selfconjugate root. In the same way, it has been possible to treat more
complex cases, with different combinations of roots [32]. See also [31] for details of the calculation.
In the attractive regime one has also to consider the breather particles that appear as soliton-antisoliton
bound states. It turns out that the breathers are represented by self-conjugate roots (1st breather) or by
arrays of wide roots (higher breathers).
Thus, the whole scattering theory of sine-Gordon can be reconstructed in the IR limit, thanks to the
structure of the source term. It is now difficult to argue that the NLIE does not describe sine-Gordon.

2.2.6

UV limit and vertex operators

It is interesting to study the opposite limit l → 0, where one expects to see a conformal field theory;
indeed, in this limit the masses vanish and scale invariance appears. This reproduces the UV limit of
sine-Gordon/massive Thirring, namely the c = 1 conformal field theory described in section 1.3 and in
the Figure 1.2.
The UV calculations are usually more difficult to perform than the IR ones, as they require to split
the NLIE into two independent “left” and “right” parts, called kink equations. They correspond to the
left and right movers of a two-dimensional conformal field theory. A similar manipulation is done on the
energy and momentum expressions, that can finally be expressed in a closed form, thanks to a lemma
36

presented in [25]. For the details, the reader is invited to consult the thesis [20] where all the calculations
are shown in detail. In the present text, I give only the main results and the physical insight they imply.
A first important result is that the c = 1 CFT quantum number m of the vertex operators (1.51), which
is identified with the UV limit of the topological charge, can be related unambiguously to the XXZ spin
by ±m = 2Sz . Of course, the ± reflects the charge conjugation invariance of the theory. Then, by
examining the states already “visited” at the IR limit, one can establish a bridge between particle states
and vertex operators of c = 1 theory.
1. The vacuum state has no sources, namely no holes or complex roots: only the sea of real roots is
present. There are two possible choices: δ = 0 or 1. The result of the UV calculation gives
for δ = 0 :
for δ = 1 :

∆± = 0
∆± = 8R1 2

i.e. I
i.e. V(±1/2,0)

i.e. the physical vacuum is the one with δ = 0. The other state belongs to the sector IV that does
not describes a local CFT, as in Figure 1.2.
2. The two-soliton state, described by two holes, with the smallest quantum numbers, gives
(a) for δ = 0 and I1 = −I2 =

1
2

=⇒ ∆± =

R2
2

i.e. V(0,2) .

(b) for δ = 1 and I1 = −I2 = 1 =⇒ a V(±1/2,2) descendent, not in UV sG spectrum, as it also
belongs to sector IV.
3. The symmetric soliton-antisoliton state (two holes and a self-conjugate root), δ = 1, I1 = −I2 =
1 and Ic± = 0 =⇒ ∆± = 2R1 2 i.e. V(±1,0)
4. The antisymmetric soliton-antisoliton state (two holes and a complex pair)
δ = 0, I1 = Ic− = −I2 = −Ic+ = 21 =⇒ ∆± = 2R1 2 i.e. V(±1,0)
It is obvious that these last two give two linearly independent combinations of the operators V(±1,0) ,
one with even, the other with odd parity.
5. The one hole state with I = 0, δ = 1 =⇒ ∆± = 8R1 2 i.e. the vertex operator V(0,1) , belongs
to sector II. For δ = 0 there are two minimal rapidity states with I = ± 21 . They are identified
with the operators V(±1/2,±1) . As these states belong to sector III, they are of fermionic nature and
actually one identifies them with the components of the Thirring fermion.
These examples, taken all together, suggest the following choice of δ to discriminate between sineGordon and massive Thirring states
for Sine-Gordon
for massive Thirring

2Sz + δ + MSC ∈ 2Z
δ + MSC ∈ 2Z

(2.47)

where MSC is the number of selfconjugate roots. This selects the sectors I and II for sine-Gordon states,
and the sectors I and III for the Thirring ones, as in section 1.3. The NLIE describes also the sector IV,
that does not contain local operators. The correct interpretation of Coleman equivalence of Sine-Gordon
and Thirring models is that even topological charge sectors are identical, the difference of the two models
shows up only in the odd topological charge sectors, for which the content of Thirring must be fermionic
while that of Sine-Gordon must be bosonic.
To conclude these remarks, I briefly add a comment about the special objects that were introduced
in the classification of roots but not really used later. I need to recall their definition: they are real roots
or holes yi having Z 0 (yi ) < 0. Now, the function Z is globally monotonically increasing. Indeed its
asymptotic values for ϑ → ±∞ are dominated by the term l sinh ϑ which is obviously monotonically
increasing. Also, for l large, this term dominates. Therefore at IR the function Z is surely monotonic
37

and no special objects can appear. However, these global asymptotic estimations can fail at small l
and finite ϑ. In that case the derivative Z 0 (x) can become locally negative. Thus, a real root or hole
with negative derivative becomes “special” (and splits in three objects). At the critical value lcrit of the
parameter l, at which the derivative become negative moving from IR towards UV, the convergence of
the iterative procedure breaks down, thus revealing that some singularity has been encountered. For the
scaling function to be consistently continued after this singularity, one needs to modify the NLIE adding
exactly the contributions that have been called special objects. A more careful analysis [20] reveals
that these singularities are produced by the logarithm in the convolution term going off its fundamental
determination: “special” objects are an artifact of the description by a counting function, they do not
exist in the Bethe equations. A treatment of these objects can be found in [20]. See also the discussion
at page 34. I don’t know of successful numerical calculations in presence of special objects. In [56]
a similar case occurred in the TBA formalism, in presence of boundary interactions, and was treated
numerically because it was localised in some asymptotic region.

2.3

Discussion

In this chapter I have introduced the formalism of Destri-de Vega to study the sine-Gordon model on a
cylinder with finite size space and infinite time. The presentation proposed here has mainly the purpose
to show that this method is effective in treating finite size effects in quantum field theory and creating a
bridge from a massive field theory on Minkowski space-time (visible in the IR limit) to a conformal field
theory.
As typical in treating integrable models, different systems meet on the way: lattice systems, scattering
theory and conformal field theory all participate to the scenario described by the NLIE.
The formalism was introduced by Klümper et al. in [24] and by Destri and de Vega in [25]. After, a
number of other people participated to its development. Particularly, my involvement characterized my
PhD years from 1996 to 1999, with the Bologna group.
I directly contributed to four papers, [28], [29], [30], [32] and I wrote my PhD thesis on this subject
[20]. The main steps of my contribution are
• The whole formulation was revisited and corrected.
• The study of the IR and UV limits was done systematically.
• The spectrum of the continuum theory was carefully described, using both UV, IR and numerical
calculations. also adding the odd particle sector.
• Many cases were studied numerically, to gain a complete control of the whole region that separates
the IR and the UV.
• The results were compared with perturbative calculations done with the truncated conformal space
approach, giving a confirmation of the methods.
• The introduction of a twist allowed to describe the restrictions of sine-Gordon, namely the perturbation of conformal minimal models by the thermal operator. These are massive theories that are
described by the same sine-Gordon NLIE after the introduction of an appropriate twist.
Later, other groups profited of this NLIE to investigate a variety of models. An inexpected development will be presented in chapter 4 and investigates integrability-related problems in gauge theory
(especially N = 4 SYM).
Are there other things to be done? Even if the degree of difficulty is very high, the gain would
be great, if one could succeed in the description of the eigenvectors in the continuum theory, or of
some correlation function. Their knowledge is important because they enter into the evaluation of many
38

physical quantities (diffusion amplitudes, magnetic susceptibility) whose values can be compared with
experiments.

Chapter 3

Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
The first treatment of Bethe equations in their thermodynamic limit was done by Yang and Yang in [34],
for a system of nonrelativistic bosons interacting by a repulsive delta-function, on a line. The Bethe
equations were obtained from the model Hamiltonian by the coordinate Bethe ansatz calculation, one of
the several implementations of the Bethe ansatz methods. Then, the objective of that treatment was to
evaluate the thermodynamic limit of the Bethe equations. The authors succeeded and were able to get
the partition function of this interacting gas. They also showed the partition function analyticity in the
temperature and the chemical potential, indicating the absence of phase transitions.
This method was generalized by Al.B. Zamolodchikov [35] for relativistic particles interacting with
a factorized scattering matrix. His goal was to create a contact between a factorized scattering theory
of a given S matrix to its ultraviolet limit, typically a conformal field theory in two dimensions. The
author reasonably assumes that, at a finite temperature, the equilibrium states of the particles in a box are
described by some Bethe-like wave functions (asymptotic wave function), precisely as in the Yang and
Yang approach. A quantization condition inspired to Bethe equations (1.41, 2.8) is thus imposed. Indeed,
in the Bethe equations structure we have recognized a momentum term and an interaction term, see near
(2.15). Zamolodchikov assumes that the interaction term is given by a factor of S matrix amplitudes and
the momentum is the usual relativistic one. Notice, however, that the true Bethe wave functions obtained
within Bethe ansatz calculations involve “quasiparticles”, as described near (2.15), while the scattering
theory involves physical particles. For example, the Bethe roots can be complex while physical particle
rapidities are always real. The assumption works and the Zamolodchikov “thermodynamic Bethe ansatz”
has been applied to a variety of models. It allows to study the theory obtained by perturbing a conformal
field theory with a relevant operator, under the condition that the perturbation maintains integrability.
Later, Pearce and Klümper in [36] introduced another approach to “calculate analytically the finitesize corrections and scaling dimensions of critical lattice models” (quoted from [36]). These authors
do not make use of Bethe equations; instead, they start from the transfer matrix of an integrable lattice
model and, knowing the arrangement of the zeros of its eigenvalues, are able to solve certain identities
satisfied by the transfer matrix itself. Then, one can evaluate the continuum limit of lattice models.
In the following, I will mainly talk about the last approach. All of them have triggered several
further investigations. Indeed, the TBA serves as an interface between conformally invariant theories
and massive or massless integrable theories, in particular when these massive or massless theories are
obtained as deformations of the conformal ones.

3.1

Lattice TBA

I start by defining a family of models on a square lattice of N horizontal cells (faces) and with many
rows (their number will not be used) using the following diagrammatic representation for the double row

I use a double row transfer matrix [42] because, in presence of boundary interactions, it is needed to
ensure integrability. In fact, it is a transfer matrix that acts from the row i to the i + 2 while in a more
standard single row transfer matrix it would act from i to i + 1.
The diagrammatic representation is a mean to simplify the notation and to reduce the use of indices; it
is also quite effective to realize a sort of “graphical algebra”, useful to verify a number of properties [37].
An entry of the transfer matrix, D(N, u, ξlatt )σ σ 0 , is obtained by multiplying the Boltzmann weights of
each cell and summing on the indices indicated, namely summing on the central row of sites. The dashed
triangle is a Boltzmann weight associated to the three corresponding border sites; it actually introduces
an interaction that is fully localized on the border of the lattice. As the actual lattice is just the one formed
by the square cells, the triangle has been represented with dashed lines to indicate that is not a lattice
cell. The Boltzmann weights associated to one face are

where the integers associated to every vertex are called heights and must satisfy the adjacency rule of the

I also use a crossing parameter
π
(3.4)

L+1
There are more general forms for these weights and also periodic boundary conditions are possible. Here
we have chosen those that are more indicated to our development. Indeed, they are critical weights
namely they describe the system at its critical temperature. Moreover, the right boundary weight is kept
fixed.
In these lattice models the interaction is characterized by the four sites around a face so nearest
neighbors and next-to-nearest neighbors interact. On the contrary, in the six-vertex and XXZ models the
interaction was between nearest neighbors only. The phase diagram has been studied in [38] by using
corner transfer matrix techniques. It is common to call these models from the authors of the paper, ABF
models. More precisely, I treat here the AL models, from the adjacency rules that are used.
These models have a number of useful properties. Indeed, from direct inspection of (3.2) and (3.3)
it appears that the transfer matrix is an entire function of the spectral parameter u, that means that its
entries are free of poles or other singularities in the whole complex plane.
42

Transfer matrices at different spectral parameter commute, thus insuring integrability
[D(N, u, ξ), D(N, u0 , ξ)] = 0

(3.5)

Indeed, with a standard construction, one can expand in u and generate integrals of motion.
In spite of a different formulation based on faces instead of vertices, the present AL models are very
deeply related to the six-vertex one. The original T-Q relations of Baxter and the six-vertex Bethe ansatz
can be modified to hold for the present case.
The double row transfer matrix satisfy a T-Q functional equation that is fully similar to the one that
holds in the periodic case (1.37), with small modifications to account for the boundary

The double row transfer matrix is the one in (3.1) but, when not strictly necessary, I omit the dependence
by N and ξ.
These expressions hold for a fixed border on the left and the right of (3.1), namely when r = 1 and
τ0 = r + 1 = 2. In this case the boundary coupling ξ disappears. Of course, they can be modified to
include other cases. The goal here is not to reach the largest generality but to show how the methods
work and how the TBA appears in lattice systems. For this reason, I follow the approach of [43] in order
to introduce the fusion and the TBA hierarchy.
The new operator Q(u) is a family of matrices that commute each other and commute with the
transfer matrix [Q(u), Q(v)] = [Q(u), D(v)] = 0. This implies that the same functional equation holds
true for the eigenvalues D(u) and Q(u). The eigenvalues of Q are given by


Q(u) =

n
Y
sin(u − uj ) sin(u + uj )

(3.8)

where uj are the Bethe roots. The Bethe ansatz equations result by imposing that the transfer matrix is
an entire function. Indeed, when Q(u) = 0, being D(u) entire, the right hand side must vanish. This
forces the following Bethe equations

With this convention, the transfer matrix is Hermitian in Re(u) = 0. Given the position of its zeros, that
will be presented later, the relevant analyticity strip is
D̃(u) = D(u +

− λ < Re(u) < λ

(3.11)

Using a standard notation, I let D(u) = D 10
D qk = D q (u + kλ),

(3.12)
For “historical” reasons, this notation is customary here: the upper index is not an exponent but just an
index. The T-Q relation implies that the eigenvalues D(u) are determined by the eigenvalues Q(u) in
the compact form

3.1.1

Fusion hierarchy and TBA hierarchy

From the T-Q relation (3.6) one can construct a hierarchy of models namely a set of transfer matrices D q
recursively defined one after the other. The process, called fusion, was introduced in [39] as a method
of obtaining new solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, by combining R matrices of a known solution.
Fusion for the ABF models has been done in [40] and studied in detail in [41], in the case of periodic
boundary conditions. The construction holds for the open boundary case for which the fusion has been
done in [37]. For what follows, the presence of the hierarchy has very important consequences because
it imposes a very particular organization of the zeros of the transfer matrix eigenvalues in the complex
plane of the spectral parameter u. At the end, this will lead to “solve” the eigenvalue problem.
From [37], the fusion hierarchy for the transfer matrices is
sq−2 s2q−1 D q0 D 1q = sq−3 s2q fq D q−1
+ sq−1 s2q−2 fq−1 D q+1
0
0 ,

q = 1, 2, . . . , L − 1

(3.14)

Notice that the level q + 1 is extracted from the right hand side, by knowing the levels q, q − 1, 1. This
equation is obtained for the eigenvalues, by extracting the transfer matrix eigenvalue from (3.6) and
multiplying by itself after a shift. This procedure is repeated. The second term on the right hand side is
the higher fusion level q + 1 and is fixed by the levels q, q − 1, 1. This expresses the idea of hierarchy1 .
The initial conditions of the recurrence are
D −1
0 = 0,

(3.15)

D 00 = f−1 I,

and there is a closure condition: the fusion process is upper limited by L that is the largest value of the
“heights” located on the corners of a lattice face
(3.16)

DL
0 =0

This fusion makes sense because the obtained higher fusion level transfer matrices still have the remarkable properties of the original q = 1 transfer matrix. Indeed, they are entire functions and they commute
each other. This last property implies that they all have the same set of eigenvectors. Then, they can be
interpreted as transfer matrices of new lattice models.
Starting with the fusion hierarchy (3.14), one can use induction to derive the T-system of functional
equations [44, 37]

0 D1 ,

q = 1, 2, . . . , L − 1

(3.17)

For q = 1, the rightmost term vanishes because of the initial conditions and what remains is just an
inversion identity. If we further define

(3.25)

that means that within a periodicity strip (Re(u), Re(u) + π) we will use only the analyticity strip (3.25)
to solve for the eigenvalues. This choice is related to the position of the zeros and will be presented later.

Functional equations as the T-system and Y-system hold for the periodic boundary case, the open
case, and off-criticality. They are a true feature of the this type of lattice models. The same hierarchy
holds for the six-vertex model but it is unlimited so there is no truncation.
Notice that my goal is to find the eigenvalues of the nonfused double row transfer matrix D(u). The
T-Q relation (3.6) offers us one way: solve the Bethe equations (3.9), put the Bethe roots in (3.8) and
use (3.6) to find the eigenvalues T (u). The fusion hierarchy offers another path: solve the whole family
of TBA functional equations (3.22) at all orders of fusion; this gives d˜1 (u) that appears as the rightmost
term in (3.17) when q = 1 then this equation can be inverted to find D1 (u) = D(u), as wanted. The two
paths, albeit mathematically equivalent, offer different levels of difficulty. Solving or at least classifying
all solutions of the Bethe equations can be an hard task, given that Bethe roots are complex numbers. It
turns out that it is simpler, in this case, to follow the second approach. This will require to control the
zeros of the fused transfer matrices.

3.1.2

Functional equations: Y-system, TBA

In the previous section I have presented several systems of functional equations for the transfer matrices.
I try now to motivate their relevance in relation to the Zamolodchikov approach to thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz.
The Y-system in the form (3.22) can also be written as

(3.27)

where Aqr = δq,r−1 + δq,r+1 is the incidence matrix of the Dynkin diagram AL−2 . This equation has
now the form of the one obtained by Zamolodchikov in [45] for the RSOS scattering theories. These
theories are obtained by perturbing a unitary conformal field theory of the minimal series (1.49) by the
operator φ1,3 . This operator is relevant and it preserves integrability namely the perturbed theory is still
integrable. There are two possible directions of perturbation, according to the sign of the coupling. One
(−)
gives rise to a massive model Am whose scattering matrix factorizes according to the factorization
theorem discussed in the Introduction. The other direction of the perturbation gives a massless theory
45

(+)

Am . The name of “RSOS theories” for these models come from the fact that their two particle scattering
matrix, apart overall factors, is the R-matrix of the ABF models of [38], that are also called RSOS.
For these theories in the massive regime, Zamolodchikov wrote the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
equations in [45] for the ground state and showed that they are particular solutions of a Y-system with
the same structure of (3.27). The approach of Zamolodchikov does not describe excitations above the
ground state but it is reasonable to imagine that the Y-system, more that the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz,
describes the symmetries of the model and all its excited states. Y-systems emerge in most (or possibly
all) the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations that have been derived: see [46] but also one of 135
citations to it, for example [47], that is a recent review on the integrability in AdS/CFT, containing many
recent citations to Y-systems.
Now, it is curious to see if the Y-system can emerge, in field theory, in a direct way that avoids the
tortuous method of [45]. Indeed, in the series of papers opened with [48], the authors formulated a continuum version of the transfer matrix, of the T-Q relation and of the subsequent functional equations for
the minimal series M2,2n+3 . This latter is a family of non-unitary conformal field theories with central
2
charge c = 1 − 3 (2n+1)
2n+3 . The formulation has been also modified in [49] to describe the perturbation
by the operator φ1,3 . So, the Y-systems can be obtained constructively from the conformal field theory
operators, at the critical point and off criticality.

3.1.3

Zeros of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix

The conclusion of section 3.1.1 was an indication to solve the Y-system (3.22) to obtain the eigenvalues
of the transfer matrix. Before engaging in this calculation, one has to know the analytic properties of the
transfer matrices, especially in relation to zeros (and poles, if any).
The eigenvalues D̃q (u) of the transfer matrices have many zeros in the complex plane. They can be
easily counted from (3.1), considering that each face contributes with a trigonometric term sin(a + u)
(with some a) and the triangular face with two such terms. This means that D̃q (u) is a polynomial in
z = exp(iu) and z̄ = exp(−iu) of degree 2N + 2 so we have to expect 4N + 4 zeros in a periodicity
strip. This counting can be slightly different in presence of other boundary conditions.
Many analytical and numerical observations, and also the “string hypothesis” formulated in [41] for
the Bethe roots, indicate that the zeros have a peculiar structure within the strip indicated in (3.25) as
analyticity strip. Indeed, zeros can be on the middle axis of the strip, such that their real part vanishes
Re(u) = 0

(3.28)

(these are called 1-strings) or on the border of the strip. In that case they appear as pairs
Re(u1 ) = −Re(u2 ) = λ ,

Im(u1 ) = Im(u2 )

(3.29)

and are called 2-strings, in the usual Bethe ansatz meaning of “string”. This pattern holds for all transfer
matrices, with q = 1, 2, . . . , L − 2. The matrix D L−1 is proportional to the identity so its strip is empty.
Moreover, these are always simple zeros, because Bethe roots are mutually exclusive.
Numerical examples showing this peculiar behaviour of 1- and 2-strings have been presented in
a number of papers, starting from the one [52] in which the methods were established. This pattern
holds in presence of boundary interactions [53], [54] and with off-critical transfer matrices [55], with
massive or massless perturbations. In [43] there is a whole “art gallery” of images of the zeros of the
transfer matrix eigenvalues for the critical A5 model with fixed boundaries. In Figure 3.1 there are three
examples of states from the tricritical Ising model A4 . As it has just two levels of fusion, q = 1, 2, it has
two analyticity strips. The transfer matrices were not shifted so strips are not centered as in (3.25). In
the figure, arrows indicate the dynamics of the zeros, namely their displacement after tuning a boundary
coupling.

Figure 3.1. Three states for the tricritical Ising model are shown. The arrows indicate three
different mechanisms of displacement of the zeros triggered by the change of the boundary
coupling constant from one to another conformal boundary condition B(2,1) 7→ B(1,2) . Note
that this is the reverse of the physical flow which actually goes from the UV point (1, 2) to
the infrared point (2, 1). The states are A, (0|0) 7→ (0)+ ; B, (1|0) 7→ (0)− ; C, (0 0 0|1) 7→
(0 0 0 |0 0)− . In this image, taken from [54], the shift (3.21) is not used. Strip 1 is on the
left, strip 2 on the right.
In some case, often because of the normalization factors in (3.14), some zeros at intermediate positions occur, like
λ
Re(u) = ±
(3.30)
2
I will not consider these cases here. Actually, they do not modify the general ideas that follow, especially
because they do not have dynamics: they appear in a fixed number, they show up in all states and have a
fixed position.
In addition to (3.28, 3.29), several numerical investigations show that the relative order of the zeros in
the L − 2 fundamental strips (3.25) is sufficient to identify a common eigenstate of the transfer matrices
D 1 to D L−2 . Indeed, the state is fixed by the order of appearance of 1- and 2-strings, from the real axis
to the asymptotic region. As an example, in Figure 3.1 the state A is given by:
• strip 1: four appearances of 2-strings behind one 1-string
• strip 2: one appearance of 1-string
This means that such an eigenstate is uniquely characterized by a topological information and that the
corresponding geometrical data, namely actual positions of zeros, can be inferred by other means. The
relative order between different strips has no relevance. Eigenstates/eigenvalues are thus classified by
combinatorial rules.
This phenomenon is at the origin of the nomenclature of the states by a set of non-negative quantum
(q)
numbers {Ik }; considering the upper half-plane, in a strip the lower 1-string carries number 1 and so on
(q)
counting upward; given the k-th 1-string of strip q, Ik is the number of 2-strings above it. This definition
allows an easy reconstruction of the sequence of 1- and 2-strings in the strip (see also Figure 3.1).
Indicating with mq , nq the number of 1-strings, 2-strings respectively in strip q (above the real axis),
one clearly has
(q)
(q)
(q)
nq ≥ I1 ≥ I2 ≥ . . . ≥ Im

(3.31)
q
It is important to mention that, even if the general scheme proposed here is only true “asymptotically”
(large N ), deviations are very small and already with a lattice of six faces the general picture appears.
Deviations consist in the displacement of the zeros by their asymptotic position (3.28 or 3.29). This
phenomenon is also observed in the Bethe ansatz framework: the “string hypothesis” is asymptotic and
there are deviations in a finite size lattice.
The number of zeros is expected to grow with the lattice size, according to the counting done at the
beginning of this section. Notice first that N growths in steps of 2, because of adjacency rules. Given
47

a certain set of zeros with their relative order, the addition of an even number of new columns to the
lattice has the only effect to add 2-strings to strip 1, near the real axis. In other words, the real axis of the
first strip is a source of 2-strings, when N increases. The definition of the quantum numbers has been
chosen consistently with this: the quantum numbers of a state do not depend by N . The addition of new
2-strings in the first strip pushes the other zeros (in all strips) far and far from the real axis. This trend is
very important for the scaling limit that will be used to get contact with the conformal theory. Indicating
a 1-string position by

Even if the relative orders and positions of different strips do not matter, there are constraints between
the composition of the different strips. They originate in the Y-system and will be presented later.

3.1.4

Solving the Y-system

Aiming at finding the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, the functional system (3.22) has been “solved”
in [52] by taking Fourier transform of the logarithmic derivative. This method requires to control the
zeros and poles within the analyticity strip (3.25). After, the method was adapted to several other cases,
as in [53] for fixed boundaries, in [54], [56] and [57] for interacting boundaries, in [55] for off-critical
lattices and finally in [43] for the whole series of AL models and for the XXX model. Therefore, there
is no need to repeat all the long calculations here.
The final result will be written after taking a scaling limit or continuum limit

where the matrices of (3.21) are used. The lattice size has been indicated and a new spectral parameter
x has been introduced, rotated and dilatated by respect to u2 . The size N appears in the limit (3.34) first
explicitly, counting the number of faces, second implicitly, by the “scaling” positions of the zeros (3.33).
There are two important reasons to require the continuum limit: first, the positions of the zeros in
(3.1.3) are “asymptotically” correct therefore exact results can be obtained in the limit only, second
because one is usually interested in comparing with conformal field theory data. Conformal field theory
is defined on a continuous space, not on the lattice.
From [43], the transfer matrix eigenvalues are

In (3.38), two ingredient are still missing: the transfer matrix dˆ1 and the zeros ŷk . Thanks to the
limit (3.34), I can give them an expression. This is not possible before the limit, namely on the lattice,
because the positions indicated in section 3.1.3 are only asymptotically correct.

(q)

where a new family of quantum numbers has been introduced nk . They are odd integers. These two
sets of equations close the problem. Indeed by simultaneously solving the TBA equations and the quantization conditions one has the transfer matrices in the center of the strips (3.25) and the position of the
zeros. Those with label q = 1 enter in the energy expression (3.38) namely in the original transfer matrix
eigenvalues. Equations (3.41) and (3.42) are now exact and describe the whole spectrum of the transfer
matrix.
The Y-system controls the structure of the equation, namely the appearance of the integral with a
difference-like integration kernel and the hyperbolic cosine. The equations still show the full AL−2
structure of the Y-system (3.27), in which a strip is coupled with the two neighboring ones. The specific
form of the driving term −4 δ1,q e−x comes from the initial condition for D 0 in (3.15) and indicates
how the degrees of freedom with fusion index 1 participate to the energy. The hyperbolic tangent for the
zeros and the convolution kernel 1/ cosh(x − y) are specific of a critical lattice and they become elliptic
functions in the off-critical case. They are mainly fixed by the form of the left side of the Y-system. In
presence of boundary interactions, one also adds a specific term as in [56], [57].
The positivity condition
1 + dˆj (x) > 0
(3.44)
holds on the whole real axis therefore the integral terms are always real. The zeros terms can produce an
imaginary part that corresponds to taking the logarithm of a negative value of dˆq (x).
The equations (3.41) are legitimately called thermodynamic Bethe ansatz because they correspond
to the equations of Zamolodchikov [45] for the RSOS scattering theories. His equations are obtained for
the massive case with periodic boundary conditions while here the model is lives on a open strip and the
bulk is critical. More importantly, the equations of Zamolodchikov only hold for the ground state while
the present lattice approach provides all the states. Notice that the Zamolodchikov equations are usually
expresses in terms of the pseudo-energy q (x) = − log dˆq (x).
In the general case, there is no explicit solution of this functional equations. For this reason, sometimes numerical solutions were used. It is true that, near a critical regime, it is possible to obtain a closed
form for the energy. Indeed, after long calculations, one has a very short form for the conformal energy

and mT = (m1 , m2 , . . . , mL−2 ) is a vector with the number of 1-strings. In this case, a completely
explicit expression for the energies has been obtained. Notice that the solution of the TBA system is still
unknown. One arrives at the expression for the energy by manipulation, not by actually solving the TBA
or quantization conditions.
In noncritical cases, one can arrive at equations like (3.45) only in the UV and IR limits already
described in section 2.2.5 and 2.2.6.

3.2

NLIE versus TBA

Two formalisms have been introduced. One, directly derived from the Bethe ansatz equations, leads to
a Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega equation. The other, derived from functional equations for
the transfer matrix, leads to the (full spectrum) thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. Both produce
50

one or a system of exact nonlinear integral equations of Freedholm type that allow the evaluation of
energy, momenta and other observables. Both equations have the structure
f (x) = ν(x) + χ(x, θi ) + K ? log(1 + exp(αf ))
ν(x) = driving term

(3.47)

χ(x, θi ) = sources, to be fixed by quantization conditions
with quantization conditions given by
f (θ̂ + θi ) = Ii ,

(3.48)

Ii ∈ Z

(θ̂ is a fixed shift that appears in the TBA case but not in the DdV one). The function f itself can carry an
index, thus participating to a system of coupled equations. The two approaches complement each other,
precisely as the T and Q operators complement each other in Baxter T-Q relation (1.37). Indeed, the
main message is that the Q operator is behind the Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega approach
while the T operator gives rise to the TBA equations.
In spite of the many analogies, the two approaches offer different paths to evaluate the main observables. The choice of using one or the other is mainly dictated by the available initial information: Bethe
roots/holes or zeros of the transfer matrix eigenvalues. Notice that the Klümper-Pearce-Destri-de Vega
equation is exact in both the finite lattice and the continuum limit while the TBA equations exist only in
the continuum limit. Indeed, the first approach does not assume a “string hypothesis” for the zeros/holes
while the second one uses the notion that zeros have a fixed real part. This is true in the large size limit
and is very much like a “string hypothesis” for the transfer matrices. Actually, it is even more than an
hypothesis as it has been widely tested.
Another major difference is in the number of equations. For the sine-Gordon case, one Destri-de
Vega equation describes the spectrum. A corresponding TBA set would couple an infinite number of
equations. This is better understood if one defines a counting function (see (2.23)) by
F = exp(iZ(u)) =

Q(u + λ)f (u − λ2 ) sin(u − λ)
Q(u − λ)f (u +

λ
2 ) sin(u

κ(u)
κ(λ
− u)
+ λ)

(3.49)

such that Bethe equations (3.9) reduce to
(3.50)

F(uj ) = −1
The function κ(u) is the solution of
κ(u)κ(u + λ) = f1 f1 s−2 s2

(3.51)

κ(u) = κ(λ − u)

and is given in [58]. This function has mainly a normalization role and is not very important to the
present purposes. Notice that in the definition of the counting function the rightmost factor is actually 1.
The first case of the T-system (3.17) can be written as
1 + d1 (u) =

s−1 s1
D1 D1
f1 f1 s−2 s2 0 1

(3.52)

(3.53)

Now it is obvious that the TBA approach has to solve for the whole hierarchy, here represented by the
left hand side, while the counting function of the DdV equation (right hand side) is just related to the
51

first fusion level. This last equation is very important because it makes the bridge between the two
formalisms. Here is has been written for the AL models but, taking its limit λ → 0 and rescaling u
as done in the second part of [43], one adapts it to the XXX model. In that case the hierarchy has no
truncation, that means that q is not upper bounded. The six-vertex untruncated hierarchy holds for the
sine-Gordon model; this makes clear that the TBA equations for sine-Gordon form an infinite system, as
previously indicated. I have derived (3.53) following the paper [64].
The Zamolodchikov scattering formulation of TBA equations [45] was based on a dressed Bethe
ansatz, namely a Bethe ansatz based on physical particles and not on quasi-particles; that formulation
was not able to treat excited states. An interesting but extremely lengthy method to describe excitations
was formulated by Dorey and Tateo [59]. It is based on analytic continuations of the ground state TBA
equations by the adimensional parameter r = M R, that is the product of the mass of the fundamental
particle and of the space size. This parameter enters the TBA equations as
(3.54)

ν(x) = r cosh x

and represents the momentum of a particle with (real) rapidity x. Analytic continuation along a path
that encloses the singularities of the equation and returns to the real axis produces equations for the
excited states: pictorially, moving around branch point singularities let one change the Riemann sheet
and access a new excitation level. The difficulty of this approach is in finding systematic classifications
of these singularities. Clearly, the lattice formulation given here has no such difficulty and all excitations
are easily described.
The work of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov [48], [49] was motivated by the need of describing excitations in a more systematic way by constructing a Y-system ab-initio for a quantum field
theory formulation of transfer matrices and Q operators. They could get the Y-system. The methods
shown in this chapter are an efficient way to solve the Y-system, for the ground state and all the excitations.
There is another important difference, in the role of the function f (x). Indeed, in the TBA case
α = −1, the function exp(−f ) indicates how the energy is distributed among the degrees of freedom
and is real, as it is a transfer matrix eigenvalue. In the Klümper-Pearce-Destri-de Vega case, f is a
counting function namely it controls the density of Bethe roots (indicated with ρ)

and is especially related to the momenta of the particles. α = i so exp(if ) is a complex function.

Integrals of motion

The DdV equation and the TBA equations allow the evaluation of energy, momenta and other integrals
of motion. For the TBA equations, the equations for high integrals of motion have been obtained in [60]
thus providing explicit expressions in the case of the tricritical Ising model with boundary perturbations

The case n = 1 gives the energy E = I1 (ξ) as in (3.38). The TBA equations and quantization conditions
are as in (3.41) and (3.42) with L = 4 and with the addition, on the right hand side of log dˆq (x), of the
52

boundary interaction term log gq (x, ξ). In particular, for the boundary flow (1, 2) → (1, 1) the choice is
g1 (x, ξ) = tanh

g2 (x, ξ) = 1

(3.58)

with ξ = −∞ corresponding to the boundary condition (1,2), namely an unstable UV point, and ξ = +∞
to the (1,1), a stable IR point. This perturbative flow is triggered by the boundary operator φ1,3 , namely
by an operator that acts on the border of the strip. Notice also that t̂1 and ĝ1 of [60] correspond to dˆ2 and
ĝ2 of the present paper; analogously t̂2 and ĝ2 correspond to dˆ1 and ĝ1 . These equations are strategically
important to fix the correspondence with basis vectors in the conformal field theory. Indeed, the difficulty
with TBA equations is that they provide expressions for the energy but no indication of the states. In
conformal field theory, given the high amount of symmetry, typically many states have the same energy.
For example, in a standard cylinder quantization, the vacuum sector of the tricritical Ising model has
level degeneracies
1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, . . .
(3.59)
How can one match lattice states and conformal field theory states? The first few conformal field theory
conserved charges are given in [8], obtained after quantization of classical integrals of motion of the
modified KdV and sine-Gordon models. This derivation is very important because it is naturally related
to φ1,3 perturbations and to the structure of the Y-system (3.22). The integrals of motion are

Expressions for the following cases become quickly very complicated. In terms of the generators of the
Virasoro algebra, the space of states is built by linear superpositions of the states (1.48). A conceptually
simple (but technically very difficult) problem of linear algebra is to find common eigenstates of the
integrals of motion on the Virasoro basis (1.48). For the first few levels, an explicit expression has been
evaluated in [60], together with the corresponding eigenvalues, providing a list of eigenvalues InCFT . At
higher energy, the eigenvalues are given by solving algebraic equations of degree equal to the degeneracy.
Using the eigenvalues (3.56), one has another list InTBA . Matching the two lists creates a one-to-one
dictionary that in [60] was appropriately called lattice-conformal dictionary. The wording is inspired
from [61]. I’m not aware of closed expressions for the integrals (3.56), like the energy expression (3.45),
even if I believe they should exist. For this reason, numerical evaluations have been used. Notice that,
even if InTBA and InCFT are evaluated numerically, the matching is exact because the spectrum is discrete,
as one can appreciate looking at the values given for the vacuum sector in table 3.1.
One can wonder about the fate of such integrals of motion when a relevant perturbation is switched
on. In the present case, where the φ1,3 boundary perturbation is concerned, the TBA formulation is
preserved because, as already discussed, this perturbation generates flows for which the Y-system and
the functional equations still hold. This is well known on the lattice side. It is also know that at special
points of the sine-Gordon coupling, one describes the φ1,3 perturbations of the minimal models (1.49)
therefore it is natural to expect that the quantities (3.60) are compatible with such a perturbation, being
derived from the sine-Gordon integrals of motion. Among the possible families of involutive integrals
of motion allowed in the CFT, they are those whose ranks (or Lorentz spins, namely the indices n) are
predicted to be preserved, by the counting argument in [51]. The perturbed operators are given in [49].
Numerical investigations of I3 (ξ) were done in [60].

The expressions (3.56) actually work for all the other models described by (3.41). I would like to
mention that very similar expressions hold in the DdV formalism [62]. Also these authors do not find
a closed form for (3.56), except at a free fermion point. In the Ising case A3 a closed form is known in
terms of poly-logarithms [63], but this is a free fermion!

3.4

Numerical considerations

The form of equations (3.47) is particularly suited to be solved by iteration. Indeed, starting from an
initial guess
f0 = ν(x)
(3.61)
one iterates by
fk+1 (x) = ν(x) + χ(x, θi ) + K ? log(1 + exp(αfk ))

(3.62)

up to the required precision. This looks very easy and, sometimes, it is so. The difficulties come when
there are sources to fix, in particular when they are outside the real axis, in which case one experiences
also a big increase of the computational time. The difficulty is due to the mixing of the “functional”
problem, namely finding a function f , with the “sources” problem, namely finding the sources. Then,
one has to iterate at the same time on f and on θk .
The numerical approach has been used in many occasions. In [56], there is a wide discussion in
relation to the TBA case. See also the paper [67] for the DdV case. Here I would like to discuss about
the question of convergence. Is the iteration (3.62) converging? Is it converging to the good solution, if
there are multiple solutions?
The contraction mapping theorem states that if a mapping M : V → V on a complete metric space
V is a contraction then there exists a unique fixed point f0 = M(f0 ) and all the sequences obtained
under iteration starting from an arbitrary initial point f ∈ V converge to the fixed point. In practice,
the derivative |M0 (f )| measures the strength of the contraction and the rate of convergence. The case
|M0 (f )| < 1 is a contraction while |M0 (f )| > 1 is a dilatation. Values close to 0 converge quickly,
values close to 1 converge slowly.
If one could show that the mapping fk+1 = M(fk ) is a contraction, then the answer to the previous
questions would be affirmative. Unfortunately, the mapping is not easy to evaluate. Restricting to the
TBA case, one can do some steps forward. By varying f in (3.62) one has
Z
1
− exp(−fk )
δfk+1 (x) =
δfk (y) dy
(3.63)
2π cosh(x − y) 1 + exp(−fk )
By the integral

−∞

cosh t

the first fraction sums up to 21 therefore “in average” is a contraction. If fk is real, as it happens in
the ground state, the last fraction has absolute value lower than 1. This suggests that the integration
acts globally as a contraction with factor smaller than 12 therefore iteration is convergent to the unique
solution.
Numerical calculations have shown that, in absence of sources, the convergence of the iteration
equations is usually fast. In the L = 4 case, namely the tricritical Ising model, 30 iterations are sufficient
to reach 9 significant digits, that confirms the estimate of a contraction factor of 1/2
2−30 ∼ 10−9

(3.64)

In presence of sources, the intuitive evaluation breaks down because one has to iterate on the sources
position. This is related to the fact that fk can acquire an imaginary part multiple of π, although 1 +
exp(−f ) > 0 as in (3.44). On numerical calculations, one immediately observes the need to iterate
55

longer, up to hundred times when several sources are considered. Moreover, in [56] it was pointed out
that certain algorithms to fix sources do not converge. The problem does not appear for the function f
itself. When algorithms for sources do not converge, they appear to be dilatations, in which case the
iteration takes away from the fixed point and the solution must be found by other means. This fact is
curious and could become more serious in other models with different kernel or sources structure, up to
the point of preventing the unicity of the solution.
In the models considered here, an incomplete possible argument goes as follows. In (3.42) one
neglects the integrals, that often appear to be much smaller that the source terms. Then, an equation with
q > 1 looks like

If this derivative is larger that 1, (3.68) becomes a dilatation. Evaluating it is not easy. If the sources can
(q)
be arranged in such a way that Y (ŷk ) is sufficiently close to ±1, the denominator can be made close to
zero. This probably means that the derivative can be quite large and be a dilatation, but this analysis is
not conclusive. Several numerical investigations have shown that there are sources arrangements where
iterative algorithms as (3.68) do not converge at all. In these cases, other methods are needed. For
example, one first estimates the interval in which the source is expected then locates it by the bisection
method. Of course, this uses much more computer time than an iterative method.
In [56] a similar situation was described in relation to a boundary function g(x, ξ). The treatment
given here is complementary to that one and, in some sense, is more general because it does hold even
when boundary parameters are absent.
In the frame of the DdV equation, in [29] and [32] the case of “special holes” was left unsolved: in
that case, the functional equation itself seems to fail to converge, or better, it converges to a nonsense,
possibly for the reasons indicated here.
The lesson of this analysis is that iterations can give rise to unexpected problems and this could have
consequences about the unicity of the solution. On the other hand, in my numerical TBA calculations, I
never observed problems of unicity.

3.5

Discussion

I have introduced the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method, sketched its lattice derivation and discussed
the relevance of the Y-systems to summarize the symmetries of the model. I have presented the integrals
56

of motion. The methods of DdV and TBA have been compared and numerical considerations have been
shown.
Personally, I have worked on TBA equations for a fair amount of time (2000 to 2006). My contribution has been important.
• I have derived and treated TBA equations for the boundary flows of the tricritical Ising model.
• I have established the lattice-conformal dictionary.
• I extended the TBA to all AL models and also to the XXX model.
• I analyzed how the zeros move in consequence of boundary flows.
• I derived the conformal characters (conformal partition functions) from TBA.
• I have done extensive high precision numerical calculations with TBA equations, in presence of
many sources and of several coupled equations.
• I worked on the physical combinatorics of quasi-particles. They form a lattice gaz whose partition
function is the conformal character.
The first development that I propose is to make systematic the lattice-conformal dictionary. This is
probably related to the realization of a lattice Virasoro algebra. It will lead to a better understanding of
the space of states.
The second is related to the quasi-particles and the physical combinatorics. I have already experimented, in [65], algebraic formalisms to express these quasi-particles. The formulation was primitive but
other authors worked on it and proposed more effective formalisms, see [66] and the papers that followed
it. I think the clarification of an algebraic formalism for the quasi-particles would help to work on the
space of states of the minimal models and their perturbations.

Chapter 4

Hubbard model and integrability in N = 4
SYM
The Hubbard model was introduced in order to investigate strongly correlated electrons in matter [68, 69]
and since, it has been widely studied, essentially due to its connection with condensed matter physics.
It has been used to describe the Mott metal-insulator transition [70, 71], high critical temperature Tc
superconductivity [72, 73], band magnetism [74] and chemical properties of aromatic molecules [75].
The literature on the Hubbard model being rather large, I refer to the books [76, 77] and references
therein. Exact results have been mostly obtained in the case of the one-dimensional model, which enters
the framework of our study. In particular, the 1D model Hamiltonian eigenvalues have been obtained by
means of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz by Lieb and Wu [78].
One of the main motivations for the present study of the Hubbard model and its generalisations is
the fact that it has unexpectedly appeared in the context of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. This is a
superconformal gauge theory in four dimensions, conjectured to be dual to a string theory in a AdS5 × S5
background, a ten dimensional space.
Indeed, it was noticed in [79] that the Hubbard model at half-filling, when treated perturbatively in
the coupling, reproduces the long-ranged integrable spin chain of [82] as an effective theory. It thus
provides a localisation of the long-ranged spin chain model and gives a potential solution to the problem
of describing interactions which are longer than the length of the spin chain. The Hamiltonian of this
chain was conjectured in [82] to be an all-order description of the dilatation operator of N = 4 super
Yang-Mills in the SU (2) sector. That is, the energies of the spin chain where conjectured to be proportional to the anomalous dimensions of the gauge theory operators in this sector. After, it was shown that
starting with the fourth loop terms, the Hubbard model is incomplete in describing the dilatation operator
[80], certain highly nontrivial phase factors being required. But this wasn’t the end of the story! The
full factorized scattering matrix of the gauge theory has been studied and Beisert has shown the relation
of this S-matrix with the Shastry R-matrix of the Hubbard model [81]. This means that the integrable
structure of the Hubbard model enters in the conjectured integrable structure of the SYM theory.
In this chapter, I will present two different approaches to the Hubbard model, one based on the
Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega method [96, 67] and one based on R-matrices [94]. The first
one has led to the evaluation of energies for the antiferromagnetic state. It allows also to control the order
of the limits of high coupling and high lattice size. The large size of the model is easily treated at all
values of the coupling. This is important as in the SYM frame it corresponds to very long monomials of
local operators, totally inaccessible with ordinary diagrammatic techniques. For the second approach, in
2005-2006 I thought there may be the possibility that some integrable extension of the Hubbard model
could be put in relation to other subsectors of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory given that the Hubbard
model itself was observed in relation to the sector SU (2). Here I will discuss a general approach to construct a number of supersymmetric Hubbard models. Each of these models can be treated perturbatively
and thus gives rise to an integrable long-ranged spin chain in the high coupling limit.
59

Other symmetric or supersymmetric generalizations of the Hubbard model have been constructed,
see e.g. [93]. These approaches mainly concern high Tc superconductivity models. They essentially
use the gl(1|2) or gl(2|2) superalgebras, which appear as the symmetry algebras of the Hamiltonian of
the model. The approach I have adopted in [94] however is different, being based on transfer matrices
and quantum inverse scattering framework. It ensures the integrability of the model and allows one
to obtain local Hubbard-like Hamiltonians for general gl(N |M ) superalgebras. After a Jordan-Wigner
transformation, these Hamiltonians appear to describe one or more families of charged and chargeless
fermions.

4.1

The Hubbard model

The Hubbard model, introduced in [68, 69], describes hopping electrons on a lattice, with an ultralocal
repulsive potential that implements a screened Coulomb repulsion, with U > 0. The 1-dimensional
Hamiltonian is given by
H = −t

L X 

(4.1)

i=1

where c , c† are usual fermionic operators, i indicates the lattice site and ρ is the “spin orientation”. I
will always use periodic boundary conditions.
The physical idea behind this Hamiltonian is that the metallic positive ions create the crystalline
structure. Each ion puts up to two electrons in the conductive band. Ions are much heavier than electrons
so for most investigations they can be considered as static thus the lattice has no dynamics. Electrons
in the conductive band repel each other (of course!) but they also experience major screening effects.
Indeed, an electron feel the repulsion of the other electrons but also the strong, periodic, attraction by the
ions. This makes the Coulomb repulsion short-ranged. In the Hubbard model, the electronic repulsion is
modeled with an ultralocal term: electrons interact only if they are on the same site. Pauli exclusion then
implies that they interact if they have opposite spin only. Pauli exclusion implies also that a maximum
of 2L electrons can be accommodate in the lattice, in which case it is “fully filled”. I will often use
the “half filled” case that contains precisely L electrons. The phase φ in the Hamiltonian represents a
uniform magnetic field. For many purposes, one can put it to zero. In the approach of [67] this phase
was introduced to fit with the Hubbard model used in [79].
There are some features that can be explored without too much calculative effort. If U = 0, the
Hamiltonian describes free fermions (electrons). The first term in (4.1) describes hopping between nearest neighbor sites in such a way that electrons can freely move around, yielding a conductor. On the
other hand, when U becomes very large, it appears that
 the totalenergy is lower if one can make negative
the contribution from the potential term 1 − 2n↑,i 1 − 2n↓,i , namely if on each site there is just one
electron. At half filling and large U , the ground state has precisely this form with one electron per site,
no empty sites and no doubly occupied sites. At zero temperature and large U this state is fully frozen
because overturning a spin would require an amount of energy of U to create a state with a doubly occupied site. This “frozen” state describes a Mott insulator namely a system whose conductive band is
not empty but the Coulomb interaction forbids any electronic displacement. At positive temperature, the
ground state is always conductive because thermal excitations can provide the amount of energy needed
to create vacances and double occupances.
The large U regime is the spin chain limit. Indeed, the Hubbard model looks very close to an
Heisenberg XXX model: one (quantum) spin per site, up or down. Notice that if the lattice is not half
filled, there is conduction whatever is the value of U .
The underling algebraic structure leads to superalgebras. In a first instance, I consider a single
fermion
{c , c† } = I ,
n = c† c
(4.2)
60

where I is the identity operator, n is the number operator and {, } is the anticommutator. The operators
c , c† , I, n form a realization of a gl(1|1) superalgebra. One way to see this is to write down the whole
set of “commutation rules”
[n, c† ] = c† ,

[n, c] = −c ,

[X, I] = 0 for X ∈ {n, c, c† }

(4.3)

These and (4.2) can be realized by the two dimensional matrices of gl(1|1)

On each site of the Hubbard lattice there are two “spin polarizations” so on each site there is a gl(1|1) ⊕
gl(1|1) superalgebra and, on the whole lattice, the fermionic structure

{cρ,i , cρ0 ,j } = {c†ρ,i , c†ρ0 ,j } = 0

is L-times the tensor product of the one site structure. I can easily represent the fermionic structure by a
graded tensor product of the matrices
E12;ρ,i = cρ,i ,

E21;ρ,i = c†ρ,i ,

E22;ρ,i = nρ,i = c†ρ,i cρ,i ,

E11;ρ,i = 1 − nρ,i = cρ,i c†ρ,i

(4.5)

When it occurs, the second pair of labels ρ, i indicates the spin polarization ρ and the site i. The matrices E12 , E21 are taken of fermionic character (they satisfy anticommutation relations whatever their
spin and space labels are) and E11 , E22 are taken of bosonic character (they always enter commutation
relations whatever their spin and space labels are). The relation (4.5) is a graded Jordan-Wigner transformation1 and respects periodic boundary conditions2 . I now rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian in the

It turns out that the breaking of (4.7) into the Hamiltonian of two XX models plus a potential term
allows one to generalise this model to higher algebraic structures by maintaining integrability4 .
Exact investigations on the Hubbard model required many years of work. A first hint of integrability
came from the coordinate Bethe Ansatz solution obtained by Lieb and Wu [78] in 1968 but a full understanding of it by an R-matrix satisfying a Yang-Baxter equation came much later. An R-matrix was first
constructed by Shastry [83, 84] and Olmedilla et al. [85], by coupling the R-matrices of two independent
XX models, through a term depending on the coupling constant U of the Hubbard potential. The proof
of the Yang-Baxter relation for the R-matrix was given by Shiroishi and Wadati [86] in 1995.
The construction of the R-matrix was then generalised to the gl(N ) case by Maassarani et al., first
for the XX model [87] and then for the gl(N ) Hubbard model [88, 89]. Later, I will use this approach to
generalize to gl(N |M ) models.
The Lieb-Wu equations [78, 79] for the Hubbard model are, in the half-filling case,

Starting from these “Bethe equations”, I will present two coupled nonlinear integral equations for the
antiferromagnetic state of the model. These equations are derived in [67] in the same framework of the
Klümper-Batchelor-Pearce-Destri-de Vega approach of the chapter 2.
For reason of completeness, it is important to point out that the thermodynamics (infinite length L, but
finite temperature) of the Hubbard model has been studied in [90, 91] by means of three nonlinear integral
equations. This approach was based on the equivalence of the quantum one-dimensional Hubbard model
with the classical two-dimensional Shastry model. The work presented here was oriented to gauge theory
understanding. The objective was to obtain energies of the Hubbard model at zero temperature but at any
value of the lattice size L therefore the approach of [90, 91] was not appropriate.
There are some features of (4.9) that deserve some attention. In the large coupling limit (large U ),
the second set of equations decouples form the first one and coincides with the XXX Bethe equations
(1.41), once the limit λ → 0 has been taken. This is consistent with the argument, given earlier, that the
spin chain limit of the Hubbard model is the XXX model. On the opposite, if U = 0 the second group
becomes useless because the first group is enough to fix k̂j and the energy. The first group reduces to
eik̂j L = 1

(4.11)

that is the box quantization of free particles. The momenta are all different, as usual in Bethe ansatz,
therefore particles are fermions. Indeed, in this limit the Hamiltonian describes free fermions.
From this analysis, one can see that the Lieb-Wu equations describe the phenomenon of spin-charge
separation. Indeed, the momenta k̂j are as many as the electrons so they carry charge. Instead, the
“rapidities” u` are as many as the down spins so they carry sping. In the spin limit the quasiparticles
described by k̂j disappear from the equations while at the free fermion point U = 0 it is the opposite.

The flux φ does not affect integrability properties.

This superconformal field theory in its planar limit, namely the limit of an infinite number of colors, is
probably an integrable theory. It seems related to the Hubbard model, as it was first observed in [79].

Yang-Mills operators in the scalar sector SU (2) by
γSYM =

(4.13)

The lattice size L is identified with the “length” of the operators in terms of the fundamental scalar fields
of the theory.
This theory is believed to be dual to a type II string theory on a AdS5 × S 5 background. This
and other dualities between quantum field theory and string theory are known as AdS/CFT dualities,
after Maldacena [97]. The duality has a very nice and curious feature: it exchanges strong and weak
couplings. As strong coupling calculations are usually difficult, the duality makes them accessible via
weak coupling calculations in the dual theory.
After the important work of Minahan and Zarembo [17], there has been an explosion of researches
in this domain. The AdS/CFT duality has been enriched of tools and new calculation methods by recognizing that there are integrable models, on both sides of the duality.

4.2

Universal Hubbard models

Following the methods of [87] and [92], it has been possible to generalize the Hubbard model to include
more general symmetries than the original SU (2) one. In a first stage, the XX model is generalized to
(almost) arbitrary vector spaces and symmetries. Secondly, two copies of the XX model are “glued” to
form a Hubbard model. This is the usual construction of the R-matrix of the Hubbard model.
I will use the standard notation in which the lower index indicates the space on which the operator
acts. For example, to A ∈ End(V ), I associate the operator A1 = A ⊗ I and A2 = I ⊗ A in End(V ) ⊗
End(V ). More generally, when considering expressions in End(V )⊗k , Aj , j = 1, . . . , k will act as the
identity in all spaces End(V ) except the j th one.
To deal with superalgebras, I will also need a Z2 grading [.] on V , such that [v] = 0 will be associated
to bosonic states and [v] = 1 to fermionic ones.
The construction of a universal XX model is mainly based on general properties of projectors and
permutations. The needed projectors π, π
e select a proper subspace of V
π: V → W,

f with V = W ⊕ W

e =I −π : V → W

In the tensor product of two vector spaces I take the possibly graded permutation

and also Σ12
Σ12 = π1 π

(4.16)

It is easy to show that Σ12 is also a projector in V ⊗ V : (Σ12 )2 = Σ12 . The operator C will also be used
later
C =π−π
e.
(4.17)
It obeys C 2 = I and is related to Σ12 through the equalities
1

Σ12 = (1 − C1 C2 ) and I ⊗ I − Σ12 = (1 + C1 C2 )

2

(4.18)

From the previous operators, one can construct an R-matrix acting on V ⊗ V and with spectral parameter
λ
R12 (λ) = Σ12 P12 + Σ12 sin λ + (I ⊗ I − Σ12 ) P12 cos λ
(4.19)
Several properties of the R-matrix are given in [94], [95]. The most important is the Yang–Baxter equation
R12 (λ12 ) R13 (λ13 ) R23 (λ23 ) = R23 (λ23 ) R13 (λ13 ) R12 (λ12 )
where λij = λi − λj .

(4.20)

With a very standard construction, from the R-matrix one constructs the (L sites) transfer matrix (1.30)
t1...L (λ) = strace R01 (λ) R02 (λ) . . . R0L (λ)

(4.21)

0

by taking the supertrace in the auxiliary space. So far, the calculation has been very general and no
special properties of the space V are required. Now, if V has infinite dimension, it is necessary to
assume the existence of a trace or supertrace with the cyclic property. If V has finite dimension, the trace
always exists. The relation (4.20) implies that the transfer matrices commute for different values of the
spectral parameter, thus granting integrability.
Since the R-matrix is regular (namely in λ = 0 it is a permutation), logarithmic derivatives in λ = 0
give local operators as in (1.35). The first one can be chosen as XX-Hamiltonian

where periodic boundary conditions have been used, i.e. the site L + 1 is identified with the first one.
For example, the original XX model (related to the algebra gl(2)) is obtained without gradation with
local vector space V = C2 and 2 × 2 matrices
π = E1,1 ,

For this reason, (4.22) defines generalized XX models that in [95] were called universal. With the same

because the matrices E12 and E21 are both “fermionic”; they anticommute on different sites so the
fermionic realization (4.5) can be used. The index ρ here is not necessary. The relation between the XX
model and the Hubbard model is now more clear.

model. The R-matrices of two universal XX models are distinguished by the arrow R12

where λ12 = λ1 − λ2 and λ012 = λ1 + λ2 . Moreover, h012 = h(λ1 ) + h(λ2 ) and the choice of the function
h(λ) is fixed within the proof of the Yang-Baxter equation. Indeed, when the function h(λ) is given by
sinh(2h) = U sin(2λ) for some free parameter U , the R-matrix (4.25) obeys the Yang-Baxter equation:
R12 (λ1 , λ2 ) R13 (λ1 , λ3 ) R23 (λ2 , λ3 ) = R23 (λ2 , λ3 ) R13 (λ1 , λ3 ) R12 (λ1 , λ2 ) .

(4.26)

Notice that, this time, the equation is not of difference type. As remarked in [94] the proof relies only
on some intermediate properties that are not affected by the choice of the fundamental projectors (4.14).
The proof follows the steps of the original proof by Shiroishi [86] for the Hubbard model. The same
proof has been used for general gl(N ) algebras in [77].
The Hubbard R-matrix is regular but non symmetric. It satisfies unitarity. A commuting family of
transfer matrices is obtained by fixing one of the two spectral parameters

Any other choice for µ is possible but, at least in view of obtaining a local Hamiltonian, they do not give
new information. The ‘reduced’ R-matrices that enter in the previous equation take a particularly simple

by two graded gl(1|1) models as in (4.23). Its local (one site) vector space is

V = V↑⊗V↓,

V ρ = C2

(4.31)

The universal Hamiltonian (4.30) has the same structure of the Hubbard model. What can make different
the dynamics is the fact that the projectors π, π
e seem to introduce several types of particles.
These models were introduced in relation to their symmetries. In [94, 95] it has been shown that the
transfer matrix admits as symmetry (super)algebra the direct sum of the symmetry algebras of the XX
components

counts how many up fermions are in a given state. Similarly, the operator Ê2,2;↓ counts the number of

size
Ê1,1;↑ + Ê2,2;↑ = Ê1,1;↓ + Ê2,2;↓ = L
(4.38)
so in the symmetry algebra (4.35) there is an amount of redundancy.
It is well known that the Hubbard symmetry algebra is su(2) and becomes su(2) × su(2) if the
number of sites is even. Indeed, the cases where V σ is two dimensional are special because, in addition
to the list of generators contained in (4.32, 4.36), they have new generators given by

j = σ↑j ⊗ σ↓j .

(4.39)

To be precise, the first commutes with the Hamiltonian in all cases and promotes the Hubbard symmetry
algebra to su(2), where the third generator would be Sj3 = 12 (Ê2,2;↑j − Ê2,2;↓j ). The operators M±
j
commutes only if L is even enhancing the symmetry to su(2) ⊕ su(2). In that case, the third generator
is M3j = 12 (Ê2,2;↑j + Ê2,2;↓j ).
Unfortunately, this strongest symmetry doesn’t extend to higher dimensional cases. Some enlargement of the symmetry appears at large coupling in perturbative calculations but it does not survive at
higher orders.

equivalent to the ordinary Hubbard model. A Russian doll structure is appearing: if the projectors are
well chosen, a larger model contains the small ones.
If there are primed particles only, the energy vanishes but not the momentum. This actually means
that primed particles do not have a dynamics independent of the unprimed. This fact is curious and I am
not aware of other cases in which it has been observed. If the potential term is interpreted as a Coulomb
repulsion, then unprimed particles only carry electric charge so primed particles are neutral.
The compound objects formed by c†σ,i c0σ,i † are rigid: no other term in the Hamiltonian can destroy
them. In this sense, there are four types of carriers, with the same charge but different behaviours: two

polarisations.

generalized models can describe many different fermionic particles, all living in the same lattice, some

A system of two non-linear integral equations for the Hubbard model

Following the methods of Chapter 2, the system of equations for the Hubbard model is introduced. The
full derivation is given in the original paper [67]. The main purpose of this work was to study certain
super Yang-Mills operators; this has conditioned some choices, as the systematic use of the phase φ,
which is related to a global magnetic field; of course, the whole construction holds for the Hubbard
model itself. Looking at the Lieb-We equations (4.9), I define the function

W (kj ) = π(M + 2Ijw ) ,
Z(ul ) = π(M − L + 1 +

(4.51)

From now on, the treatment focuses on the highest energy state, consisting of the maximum number
M = L/2 of real roots ul and of L real roots kj . For simplicity reasons, it is useful to restrict the
calculation to the case M ∈ 2N (the remaining case M ∈ 2N + 1 is a simple modification of this case),
which obviously implies L ∈ 4N.

The two equations (4.54, 4.56) are coupled by integral terms and are completely equivalent to the Bethe
equations for the highest energy state.
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (4.1) on the Bethe states are given by (4.10), that can now be
expressed in terms of the counting functions. I use the Bessel function

and

EW ≡ EW 1 + EW 2 .

(4.58)

The first line of (4.58), namely EL + EZ , coincides formally with the expression of the highest energy
of the BDS chain as given in equation (3.24) of [96]. However, in this case Z satisfies a NLIE which is
different from that of the BDS model. On the other hand, the second line, i.e. EW = EW 1 + EW 2 , is a
completely new contribution.
This system of equations can be extended to include all excitations. Indeed, one has to include
appropriate sources for the real holes and for all the complex roots that can appear, precisely as in (3.47).
The main goal of the papers [96, 67] was, however, to use the nonlinear integral equations for a careful
investigation of several limits: large volume (large L expansion, namely a thermodynamic limit), strong
(U → +∞) and weak coupling (U → 0) and possibly to study the effect of interchanging the order
of the limits. At the beginning of this work (2005-2006) the belief was that the Hubbard model could
represent anomalous dimensions of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. Within this correspondence
between Hubbard and super Yang-Mills, the study of the large volume limit corresponds to study very
long super Yang-Mills operators. In Figure 4.3, the energy (4.58) is plotted as function of the coupling
constant, for a lattice of 12 sites.

Discussion

I have presented two different works on the subject of the Hubbard model in relation to the N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory. Both of them have been developed in the years 2005-2007 and were amongst the first
attempts to use integrability techniques in the gauge theory.
The integrable generalizations of the Hubbard model were introduced in [94]. In [95] I have started
to work on the derivation of the Bethe equations. The scattering matrix is fully presented in that article.
The full set of Bethe equations has been obtained more recently by colleagues of mine [98].
The work on the nonlinear integral equations for the Hubbard model in [67] was actually the continuation of a work presented in [96] on the XXX model with excitations of type hole, on the BDS Bethe
ansatz [82] and on the SO(6) spin chain. I treated these models in the frame of the integrability within
the N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. Today we know that these models are at best approximations of
the correct Bethe equations [81]. In spite of this, it was important to start working with the methods
presented here. The work of [67] has shown to the community of SYM that the methods of nonlinear integral equations are effective in treating certain questions starting from Bethe equations. For this reason,
my co-authors are still active in the field. They have treated a number of new cases, including models
with non-compact symmetry groups, large number of holes, etc. [99].
After these publications, my research activities have taken a new direction, that will be presented in
the next chapters.

Figure 4.3. The behaviour of the energies for Hubbard and BDS model from small to
strong coupling is plotted here for a lattice of 12 sites. The left branches of the curves are
obtained by solving numerically the NLIE while the right branches are plotted using the the
strong coupling expansion from the NLIE. In the small picture there is a zoom of the region
where the branches overlap. The approximated match is due to numerical errors in the left
curve.

Biophysics: quantitative methods for
biology

79

Motivations
The application of quantitative methods to biology is presently the object of a large amount of theoretical
studies. Theoretical study and modeling of biological phenomena are not a substitute to biological in
vivo investigation. Instead, they are a very “economical” way to formulate quantitative relations between
relevant quantities and to make predictions with them.
Nowadays, modeling biological phenomena corresponds to the approach that has been adopted innoumerous times in other domains of science, especially physics. Weren’t the three Kepler’s laws a
model? Of course they were. Kepler was not aware of more fundamental and general laws to use
(namely Newtonian mechanics and gravity), he just formulated a quantitative description of his observations. The Bohr-Sommerfield quantization of adiabatic invariants was a model for old quantum theory.
In these examples the model preceded the theory and somehow helped formulating it. Of course, the
model can follow the theory and somehow simplify it, as the Ising model for magnetism simplifies a full
quantum mechanical approach to the problem. The power of computers makes it possible to develop
theoretical tools and models to elaborate and speculate on the vast amount of data accumulated on the
genome and on the proteome.
Strongly motivated by this, in collaboration with Dr. F. Musso of the University of Burgos, in 2006 I
introduced a model of evolution based on a population of “Turing machines”. Each machine is actually
defined by a finite number of “states” that form its own code or genome. This code undergoes stochastic
evolution with certain rates that implement different aspects of genome mutation. Then, a performance
based selection process creates a new generation of machines with increased performance. The process is
repeated for a large number of generations. The goal of this model is to explore features of the Darwinian
evolution with a full control of the parameters that participate to it. Indeed, in silico evolution and
mathematical modeling are ideal environments to test evolutive hypotheses that are otherwise difficult to
test in the real biological environment.
In a similar spirit, in 2007 I co-founded the Gemini team in Annecy, with C. Lesieur, biologist, and
other collaborators from the mathematical-physical background of the “Federation de recherche Modelisation, Simulation, Interactions Fondamentales”. The team agreed to work on questions of assembly in
oligomeric proteins6 . The team biologist had already approached the subject with standard experimental
tools but needed to use theoretical methods describe the problem in general terms through the analysis
of a larger number of cases.
A mathematician, L. Vuillon, is part of the Gemini team. This is a signal that the project on the
oligomeric proteins has a sufficiently high degree of “synthesis”, in the Greek sense, to be effective in
biology and to require a theoretical development as a complex system.
The approach that we carry on is inductive, based on the systematic analysis of structure data of
oligomeric proteins. I will present it later. The research is revealing features related to the process of the
interface formation and to the process of the assembly of different chains.
The inductive reasoning, which goes from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories, is not always applied in mathematical and theoretical physics. Indeed, it is typical of the periods
when a paradigm, or theory, is missing but a scenario is emerging from observations, that forces to move
toward a more accurate and complete understanding. Deductive reasoning is common when the paradigm

81

is established and can be applied to predict a variety of phenomena. Modelization is intermediate because the construction of the model often comes from empirical knowledge but the model allows one to
deduce further effects.
I hope the next two chapters on biophysics will suggest why a theoretical physicist, like me, is
engaging in research on evolution and proteome, and how he can help in the inductive reasoning towards
a paradigm.

Chapter 5

Modelling Darwinian evolution
Darwinian evolution is the today paradigm that unifies paleontological records with modern biology.
It creates a bridge between the microscopic view (genome, proteome) and the macroscopic features of
the living organisms (phenotype). The phenotypic, or macroscopic, mechanism of Darwinian evolution
is natural selection namely a differential scrutiny of the phenotypes by environment. The microscopic
mechanism is genome mutations. In neodarwinism, it is very important to appreciate the fact that even
if the genome is a physical memory that is transmitted from the parent(s) to the offspring, the phenotype
of a single organism is not inherited: if a person looses a leg, its children will still have both of their legs.
Notice that the physical memory or genome is also under control of the selection so it is correct to say
that the genome is part of the phenotype. The opposite is false: the phenotype is not contained in the
genome, otherwise it would be automatic to inherit acquired characters, as in Lamarkism.
The basic functioning of the genome1 is to record long sequences of four letters that later on can be
mapped into amino acid sequences by a known mapping that biologists call “the genetic code”. This
means that the biological function of proteins, intrinsically three-dimensional and based on physicochemical properties of atomic aggregates, can be described by a discrete and finite amount of information.
It’s unavoidable to imagine that amount of information as being an algorithm that, executed with given
rules, realizes some tasks. This analogy between genome and algorithm pervades the whole domain of
the artificial life [2] namely the tentative of realizing in silico organisms that exploit the main features of
living organisms2 .
The need of modeling Darwinian evolution, or else the need of creating an artificial life, comes
from several directions all related to the difficulty to make quantitative experimental studies: we cannot
rewind the Earth history to study past organisms “alive”, the fossil record is incomplete, in vitro evolution
experiments are long and expensive and only few of them have successfully been done. Moreover, the
biggest difficulty is to keep apart the different causes that produce the observed evolutionary dynamics. In
this scenario, in silico evolution can help precisely where observation biology fails: in silico experiments
can be done on today’s calculus grids, the control on the parameters is complete and the full record of
the evolution is available. I cannot avoid a comparison with cosmology: we know a single universe, we
cannot rewind its history and observational data on far objects (in remote time and in space) are few.
The difference is that artificial cosmological experiments are just impossible while artificial evolution
experiments are possible and will slowly be realized. In this sense, biological evolution is much more
affordable than cosmology. From Maynard Smith, one reads: “...we badly need a comparative biology.
So far, we have been able to study only one evolving system and we cannot wait for interstellar flight
to provide us with a second. If we want to discover generalizations about evolving systems, we will
have to look at artificial ones.” Modeling evolution has definitely not the goal to replace observatory or
experimental biology but has the goal to help finding “universal” features in the evolutionary dynamics
1

Here a possible distintion between genome and DNA is not needed
More or less, one can summarize them in: existence of a separation interior/exterior, existence of a metabolism, response
to external stimuli, self-identical reproduction.

and in the mechanisms of mutation, selection. After all, universality is the way critical phenomena are
studied in statistical mechanics: specific details do not participate in determining universal features. This
point has been particularly stressed in my recent article [1].
The existence of a small genome within a much larger phenotype and the basic functioning by the
genetic code are strategic for modelization purposes because they allow to investigate at least some of
the features of evolution without paying too much attention to the whole organism and its proteome but
just focusing on algorithm features.

5.1

The model

The idea is to have a population of algorithms that evolve with generations. At each generation, each
algorithm undergoes mutation (possibly in several flavours). The algorithm is then executed, which
corresponds to the life of the organism. The output represents the phenotype and the interaction with the
environment, therefore selection acts on it. The selection, precisely as in the biological case, evaluates
differentially two or more phenotypes retaining the best fitted for reproduction. This creates an artificial
life cycle, as in Figure 5.1, that can be repeated a large number of times, to study the evolution of the
population features.
In my Turing machines model, the algorithms are precisely the Turing machines. This choice was
mainly motivated by the generality attained by the Turing machines language, in spite of a very simple
set of basic instructions. This aspect is extremely important as it allows to do some theoretical investigation of the model. Many other formalizations of algorithms have actually been adopted in evolutionary
computation [2].
Turing machines are abstract symbol-manipulating devices that implement a “one-point” discrete
evolution law. Given a finite alphabet or list of symbols A and given the total number of internal “states”
Nt , one defines a Turing machine by giving the evolution law Q
Q

(r, s) 7→(r0 , d0 , s0 ) ,

r, r0 ∈ A ,

d0 ∈ {R, L} ,

s, s0 ∈ {1, 2, . . . Nt }

(5.1)

It is the set of actions that the machine performs, determined by the value read on the tape r = r(t),
at a position x0 (t), and by the internal state of the machine s = s(t). These variables depend on the
execution time, so r0 = r(t + 1) and so on. Notice that the mapping Q does not depend on the old
displacement right/left d(t) but it produces the new displacement d0 = d(t + 1). The mapping Q is the

core of the Turing machine and can be represented by the triplets “write,displace,call” (w, d, c) acting on
a tape, as in table 5.1 and in figure 5.2:
1. write: it writes a new symbol at position x0 (t),
2. displace: it moves right R or left by one cell L,
3. call: it changes its internal state.
An initial configuration is given by assigning the function T (x, 0) ∈ A , ∀ x ∈ Z. Recursively, a new
configuration T (x, t + 1) ∈ A , ∀ x ∈ Z is computed from T (x, t) with the mapping Q in such a way
that only a single mutated position x0 (t) can exist at each time
T (x, t + 1) = T (x, t)

∀ x 6= x0 (t)

T (x0 (t), t + 1) could be 6= T (x0 (t), t)
and such that x0 (t + 1) = x0 (t) ± 1. Here I will use the binary set of symbols A = {0, 1}. This choice
is mainly dictated by the simplicity of coding it offers. Representing T (x, t) ∀ x by a tape of cells at
position x ∈ Z, one has the familiar representation of figure 5.2.

Considering that the general characterization of Turing machines is not needed here, for computational reasons the tape is taken of finite length usually fixed to L = 300 boxes. In some simulations the
tape has been “periodized”, by identifying the last cell+1 with the first one. Periodic boundary conditions
were also used in lattice models. Moreover, as it is extremely easy to generate machines that run forever,
the maximum of 4000 temporal steps is imposed. When a machine reaches it, it is stopped and its tape
is taken without further modification.
The simulations start with a population of npop = 300 Turing machines each with just one state of
the following form
1
0 0 − R − Halt
1 1 − R − Halt
85

and go on for ngen = 50000 generations or more. At each generation every TM undergoes the following
three processes, in the order:
1. (insertion) states-increase,
2. (point) mutation,
3. selection and reproduction.
In the states-increase process, with a probability pi , the TM passes from Nt to Nt + 1 states by the
addition of the further state
Nt + 1
0 0 − R − Halt
1 1 − R − Halt
This state will be initially non-coding since it cannot be called by any other state. Indeed, the Turing
machine cannot call a state that does not exist. The only way this state can be activated is if a mutation
in an already coding state changes the state call to Nt + 1. Notice that, when called, this particular state
does not affect the tape but halts the machine. Consequently the activation of this state is mainly harmful
or neutral and it can be advantageous only in exceptional cases therefore the TM can benefit from the
added states only if they are mutated before their activation. This form of mutation vaguely resembles
DNA insertion.
During point mutation, all the entries of each state of the TM can be randomly changed with a
probability pm . The new entry is randomly chosen among all corresponding permitted values excluded
the original one. The permitted values are:
• 0 or 1 for the “write” entries;
• Right, Left for the “move” entries;
• The Halt state or an integer from 1 to the number of states Nt of the machine for the “call” entries.
This mechanism of mutation is reminiscent of the biological point mutation. Notice that the statesincrease process is actually a form of mutation. Here it has been chosen to keep the two mutations
separate in order to differentiate their roles. Other biological mechanisms like traslocation, inversion,
deletion, etc. are not implemented.
In the selection and reproduction phase a new population is created from the actual one (old population). The number of offspring of a TM is determined by its “performance” and, to a minor extent, by
chance. The performance3 of a TM is a function that measures how well the output tape of the machine
reproduces a given “goal” tape starting from a prescribed input tape. It is computed in the following way.
The performance is initially set to zero. Then the output tape and the goal tape are compared cell by cell.
The performance is increased by one for any 1 on the output tape that has a matching 1 on the goal tape
and it is decreased by 3 for any 1 on the output tape that matches a 0 on the goal tape.
As a selection process, I use what in the field of evolutionary algorithms is known as “tournament
selection of size 2 without replacement”. In it, two TMs are randomly extracted from the old population
and let run on the input tape. At the end, a performance value is assigned to each machine on the basis of
its output tape. The performance values are compared and the machine which scores higher creates two
copies of itself in the new population, while the other is eliminated. This reproduction is fully asexual. If
the performance values are equal, each TM creates a copy of itself in the new population. The two TMs
that were chosen for the tournament are eliminated from the old population and the process restarts until
the exhaustion of the old population.
3

The word “performance” is preferred to “fitness” as this last one indicates two different concepts in biology and in the field
of algorithms. The word “fitness” will be used in the biological sense.

86

The goal tapes are chosen according to the criterion of providing two difficult and qualitatively different tasks for a TM. The distribution of the “1” on the goal tape has to be extremely non-regular since
a periodic distribution would provide a very easy task for a TM.
In the various simulations several goal tapes have been used. The tape “primes” has “1” on the cell
positions corresponding to prime numbers, with 1 included for convenience, and zeros elsewhere:
1110101000.1010001010.0010000010.1000001000.1010001000.0010000010.1000001000.1010000010.

In the previous expression I inserted a dot every ten cells to facilitate the reading. The second goal tape
π is given by the binary expression of the decimal part of π, namely (π − 3)bin :
0010010000.1111110110.1010100010.0010000101.1010001100.0010001101.0011000100.1100011001.

Notice that while for prime numbers the “1” become progressively rarer so that the task becomes progressively more difficult, in the case of the digits of π they are more or less equally distributed. Another
difference is that prime numbers are always odd (with the exception of 2) therefore in the goal tape two
“1” are separated by at least one “0”. On the contrary, the digits of π can form clusters of “1” of arbitrary
length; this feature is actually visible only in very long tapes of thousands of cells or more and is not
important here.
According to the definition, the maximal possible value for the performance is 63 for the prime
numbers and 125 for the digits of π.
In [3], the objective was introduced of gathering “1” on the left side of the output tape, simulating the
process of resources accumulation. The actual definition of the score is involved so it will not be written
here.

5.2

Results

In [4] the dependence of the performance by the external parameters pm , pi was studied with both the
output tapes indicated. The two series of simulations show very similar features. The most evident effect
is that having a large amount of non-coding states speeds up evolution and allows to reach larger values of
the population performance, as in Figure 5.3. It is important to remember that when new states are added
by the states-increase process, they are and remain non-coding until activation by point mutation. Of
course, the model has a bias toward the growth of the number of states, because no deletion is introduced
and no cost for large genomes is used. This bias is on the total number of states, not on the actual number
of coding triplets. The latter is not biased, it can both increase and decrease. This bias
1. implies that the total number of states Nt cannot decrease but
2. does not imply that the performance grows faster if Nt is large. For this reason, there is no need
to add deletion or metabolic costs for large genomes.
The total number of triplets is approximately
Nt ≈ 2(1 + ngen · pi )

(5.2)

If Nc is the number of coding triplets, the ratio Nc /Nt has been measured and it is of the order of few
percent, often less, so approximately Nnc = Nt − Nc ≈ Nt is the number of non-coding triplets. The

ratio Nc /Nt is observed to decrease with the growth of the performance. This enhances the effect of
“reservoir” of the non-coding triplets: simulations show that the performance grows faster if Nnc is
large, Figure 5.3 (a) and (c), Figure 5.4. This means that the non-coding triplets are used to explore
new strategies. While the phenomenon in itself is not totally unexpected, its amplitude and persistence
surprises. Several simulations, in part not yet published, seem to indicate that the phenomenon continues
at higher pi with a ratio Nc /Nt < 0.5 namely with an enormous excess of non-coding versus coding
triplets. It is important to stress that Nt is positively selected, namely it is larger that the value attained in
the absence of selection (random evolution). Also, Nnc is larger than in the random choice case. As the
bias is present with and without selection, the effect on Nt is not produced by the bias. It is a real effect,
indirectly produced by selection. It is indirect because the algorithms of selection do not act on Nt .
88

Besides numerical investigations, the model allows one to perform some analytical evaluations. The
spirit of the papers [5, 1] has been precisely to develop a mathematical description of the mutationselection dynamics and complete it with numerical data. The mutation-selection dynamics is the set
of rules that are used by the Turing machines evolving population during simulations. They can be
treated mathematically, thus showing the presence of an error threshold. This is a value of the mutation
probability p?m such that if pm > p?m the highest performance class degrades faster than it is generated;
said otherwise, the occupation number of the highest performance class reduces to zero in such a way that
the population performance decreases. Degradation is due to harmful mutations, that are very frequent
events. Generation is due to rare good mutations and mainly to the selection mechanism, that favours the
replication of high performance individuals. Moreover, the population evolves toward the error threshold;
this means that, granted a sufficiently large number of generations, the population will occupy all the
performance classes up to the error threshold.

evolving by random mutation and performance based selection: the effect of random mutations is to
put an upper bound to the size of the genome. The only way to escape this fate is to reduce the effect
of mutations by using reparation mechanisms, optimization, small coding part in a large non-coding
genome...
Other effects studied with the Turing machine model include the extinction time of the machines and
the evolutive effect of punctuated equilibria.

Discussion

The Turing machines model has been introduced by myself and F. Musso in 2007. From the first paper [4] on, the model has been used for mathematical evaluations and several numerical investigations
[5, 1, 3]. One of the next challenges will be to introduce recombination and study the evolution and
maintenance of sexual reproduction, a very general reproductive form in nature that is still theoretically
poorly understood. Work in this direction has been carried on during the internship of my master student
[3].
At the very beginning of this Turing machines program, it wasn’t clear to me if the model was just
a personal exercise or if it could be of some use. The positive answer came later, by comparing with
other evolutionary models and also by appreciating that the TM model could be developed in several
directions, for example the one already cited of sexual reproduction.
There are not many other evolutionary models designed to study Darwinian evolution, the most famous one being Avida [6] with its ancestor Tierra [7]. They both are elegant and complete platforms that
create an in silico life. Organisms are programs that live on computer grids and compete for resources:
CPU time and memory. The simplicity is not the feature of these models, neither is the parsimony in
terms of computer resources.
A model that is much closer to TM has been developed by some members of the Institute of complex
systems in Lyon [8]. Their model “Aevol” has both a genome and a proteome therefore it implements
the transcription/translation mechanism.
In common, all these models have the idea that the genome is an algorithm that is created by random
mutations and is selected on the basis of its performance, as in Figure 5.1, measured by the ability of
realizing some task: self-replication in the Avida platform, evaluation of some complex mathematical
function in Aevol and Turing. Of course, they all have an incomparably lesser degree of complexity than
living organisms. More importantly, they do not try to describe the DNA by some “close” description or
the protein functions by some catalytic process. Is this a real difficulty? Probably it would be of interest
to describe a “realistic” genome, with four bases, the genetic code, the mRNA and amino acid sequences.
90

One could try to simulate the evolution of very basic enzymatic functions in bacteria. To do that, one
should find the “functional site” of a protein from its amino acid sequence, with one of the prediction
tools that are known to work. In perspective, this project offers an interesting development but, so far, it
has not been realized. Instead, all the cited models claim that a certain algorithm can simulate a genome;
they claim that a mathematical function can represent the phenotype and work with these simplifying
hypotheses.
Given that, the problem of knowing if realistic results can emerge from non-realistic models is conceptually extremely important. I think the answer that all these authors implicitly assume is very deep
and smart: no matter the details of the model, results are universal if universal hypotheses have been
formulated. “Universal” is employed in the sense of Kadanoff and Wilson, as it is used in statistical
physics and in the renormalization group. Therefore, having different models is important because the
comparison of their features and predictions leads to understand which are the universal features of evolution.

Protein assembly
A large number of proteins become biologically functional only after association of a number of amino
acid chains. The ensuing structures are called oligomers. In addition to folding, the oligomers need to
assemble, which takes place through the formation of interface areas that are mutually interacting. From
[9], one learns that 20% of the proteins in Escherichia coli are monomeric, the rest oligomeric/polymeric,
with a clear preference for dimers (38%) and tetramers (21%). Amongst oligomers, the large majority
is homooligomeric. Few are true polymers. In general, polymers differ from oligomers by their variable stoichiometric number, that can take values of hundred to millions of subunits. In the Protein Data
Bank (PDB), 20% only of the recorded proteins are oligomers. It has been noticed, however, that the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) over-represents small monomers, because of the difficulties in protein crystallization, thus the value of 20% is underestimated. Given all these data, the importance of investigations
of oligomeric proteins is apparent.
Folding and assembly are two processes that occur in oligomeric proteins after ribosomal synthesis.
It is believed that in most cases at least a partial folding is required before the assembly can start. The
reason for this is that assembly requires the encounter of at least two parts that are in solution in the cell;
this process is diffusion limited and can be quite lengthy. In spite of this, it is known that sometimes a
“fly-casting” mechanism takes place in which assembly comes very early and the several subunits fold
together only after assembly. Thus, the two processes cannot be considered as separated and independent
from each other. Moreover, in the first case, it is reasonable to expect at least a partial rearrangement of
the structure after assembly.
Even if the microscopic description of folding and assembly undergoes the principles of molecular
dynamics-molecular mechanics approaches, it would be of great value to obtain a more macroscopic
understanding. Some of the relevant questions are now indicated. What does differentiate two amino
acid sequences, one incapable of association, the other capable? Namely, given an unknown sequence,
can one predict if it will give rise to a monomer or to an oligomer? Is it possible to predict, from the
sequence, which amino acids will constitute the interface? What will be the interface three-dimensional
form?
These questions are not so different from those of protein folding. For example, given the sequence,
it is possible to do secondary structure predictions because it has been shown that certain groups of few
amino acids have particular propensities to one or other possible secondary structure. For example, this
has lead to formulate the Chou-Fasman rule. These predictions, however, are not free of errors.
In a similar fashion, it is reasonable to imagine that groups of amino acids or perhaps certain secondary elements have a propensity to form or not interfaces. Or else, there is a propensity for interfaces
of a specific geometric form. Are there propensities for a preferred association mechanism? Notice that
examples are known where sequences with 90% of identity follow different association patterns. This
means that few key amino acids can actually decide the association mechanisms and, why not, the folding
itself. These and other questions motivate the present studies on oligomeric proteins.
Important is to focus on the interfaces. In an oligomeric protein the interface has a high degree of
93

specificity and is very stable. Indeed, the mutual recognition of the two sides of the interface is extremely
accurate. Early it was recognised that this happens if the interface is made of many weak “contacts” [10],
namely hydrogen bonds, and if the geometric and chemical arrangements of atoms on the two parts are
complementary [11]. Indeed, strong contacts, as in a ionic bond, would be able to attract and fix several
different molecules so they would be non specific. Absence of complementarity would increase the
interatomic distance thus reducing the strength of the contacts and possibly creating space for spurious
molecules of water.
The project that I will detail in the next sections focuses on the interfaces of trimeric and higher
stoichiometry proteins. Using experimental approaches, it has been observed that few residues, located
on the interface of a protein oligomer, are crucial for its assembly. Some of them control the formation
of interfaces (association steps) while others control the stability of the oligomer (maintenance of the
associated state) [13]. These key residues are not necessarily conserved among proteins of identical
function or even of similar fold [14]. This could mean that the few residues dedicated to protein assembly
would have to be identified experimentally, for each particular case. Alternatively, a theoretical approach
could reveal which features characterize interfaces, by a systematic investigation of the known three
dimensional structures of protein interfaces. There are about 4000 cases deposited on the PDB data
bank, from the trimeric to the dodecameric stoichiometry. The aim is to identify key residues involved
in the different steps of the protein assembly and possibly to derive some of the basic principles that
manage protein assembly.
To this purpose, I have created a series of programs (Gemini) that sort out the protein interfaces
and describe them as interaction networks (graphs). The interface structure is thus efficiently coded
into graphs that allow to identify (or at least propose) the chemical links responsible for the interface’s
formation. At present, 3000 cases have been screened. The programs have been successfully tested on
known protein interfaces.

6.1

Gemini

It is a series of programs and database utilities that have been created under the common name of Gemini
to investigate properties of the interfaces of oligomers: presently, the most important are GeminiDistances, GeminiRegions, GeminiGraph and GeminiData [15].
These programs come from the need to make systematic the analysis of oligomeric interfaces in
three-dimensional protein structures. The main criterion followed has been to propose a framework of the
amino acid interactions involved in an interface so their role in providing the interface its specificity and
in regulating the mechanism of assembly can be addressed, for example by comparing protein interfaces
of similar geometry. The objective is to find all pairs of atoms (one atom per chain) located at distances
small enough for intermolecular interaction, and to reduce this set of interaction pairs to a minimum: the
smallest set that still describes the protein interface.

6.1.1

GeminiDistances

This program has the main goal to recognize the interface between two adjacent chains M and M+1 in
an oligomeric protein from its 3D structure.
A first screening is done on the backbone α carbons of adjacent chains: all pairs of amino acids (one
per chain), whose Cα are separated by a distance lower than a given cut-off, fixed to cut1=20 Å, are
retained for the next step, the others are discarded. This has the unique goal to speed up the calculation
and is legitimated by the observation that the maximal amino acid theoretical length is about 8 Å. With
smaller distance cuts-off (e.g. 10 Å), some of the amino acids of the interfaces were missed.
In the second screening all the atoms of the amino acids previously retained are examined and the
pairs at distance lower than cut2=5 Å are kept to form the so-called raw interface. This 5 Å distance
covers the range of distances that corresponds to weak chemical bonds involved in interfaces: Van der
94

Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds. Notice that these cuts-off can be freely modified. The presence
of the second cut-off makes the raw interface de facto independent of the first one: values of cut1 of 17,
20, 25 Å and higher give identical results.
The raw interface is a long list of pairs of atoms that may form chemical bonds. For example, the
interface of the heptamer co-chaperon 10, produced by Mycobacter tuberculosis (PDB code: 1HX5),
has 328 pairs of atoms selected in the raw interface. Because the aim of GeminiDistances is to propose
a framework with a minimum of interactions, it is necessary to add another constraint to deselect a
maximum number of pairs. The deselection is performed by a symmetrization procedure which only
retains a single interaction per atom, the one involving the closest partner, even for atoms having more
than one partner on the adjacent chain. Precisely, for each atom of M, in the raw interface, only the
closest atom on M+1 is retained, yielding a set of pairs L1. Similarly, for each atom of M+1, in the raw
interface, only the closest one on M is retained to form a second set of pairs L2. The pairs common to
both lists, L1 ∩ L2, form the interface used for the investigations of this paper, also called symmetrized
interface. In other words, a pair of atoms (i, j) is in the interface if both i is the closest to j and j is the
closest to i.
The symmetrization makes the symmetrized interface almost cut-off independent. Indeed, values in
the range cut2=4.5 to 6 Å have been explored. In the former case, some interactions are lost and the raw
interface forms a subset of the raw interface obtained with cut2=5 Å. Vice versa, in the latter case the raw
interface is bigger. After symmetrization, one observes remarkably small variations: in average, they do
not exceed 10% of the interface in the indicated range for cut2. Variations are even smaller if only amino
acids and not atoms are considered.
It is important to keep in mind that the symmetrization discards many atoms at distances for which a
chemical interaction is plausible. Therefore, the output generated by GeminiDistances may miss atoms,
that will be called false negative. It may also select atoms which are not chemically the most plausible,
indicated as false positive. But the selection of the most chemically plausible interactions is a more
difficult task than the geometrical selection performed by GeminiDistances. A more chemical selection
would be necessarily slower and might not necessarily be more accurate. Such a method may be better
for a case-to-case study, but the symmetrization is more appropriate for comparing the interfaces of many
oligomers.
For example, from the 328 pairs of atoms selected for the raw interface of 1HX5, only 18 pairs remain
after symmetrization. In a more coarse grained interpretation, the atoms of the symmetrized interface
are replaced by the amino acids they belong to. This amino acids interface is used by the next program
GeminiRegions.
GeminiDistances is written in C and runs in less than 0.2 s for an average size protein, on a normal
desktop computer.

6.1.2

GeminiRegions, GeminiGraph

This program separates the amino acids interface, given by GeminiDistances, into regions, understood as
elementary interaction networks between the amino acids of two adjacent chains. Many criteria can be
used: the one adopted so far considers that amino acids in a region must be “close” along the sequence, in
addition to be close in space as considered in the construction of the interface itself. Another interesting
criterion that is implemented in Gemini is based on connected components in graph theory. According
to it, atoms are grouped if there are paths that connect them by steps shorter than a given distance. This
criterion ignores the sequential nature of the proteins.
This C++ program runs in the infinitesimal time of 2 ms per protein.
By construction, a region, or an interaction network, contains the interactions expressed by the pairs
of the amino acids that form the interface; this corresponds to the notion of graph. In mathematics,
a graph is a set of vertices (here the amino acids) connected by a set of links (here the weak chemical
bonds). Therefore, it is natural to introduce the following graphical representation, done with the program

Figure 6.1. The largest region of the pentamer 1EFI (subunit B of the heat-labile enterotoxin
of Escherichia coli) is represented here. The ladder structure formed by backbone-backbone
interactions is present in most of the interfaces formed by the alignment of two parallel or
antiparallel β strands.
GeminiGraph. Vertices are the amino acids; for reader’s ease, those involved in a weak chemical bond
are symbolised by a cross “×” whereas those not involved in weak chemical bonds are symbolized by
a dot “·”. Dashed-dotted lines indicate backbone-backbone interactions, solid lines indicate side chainbackbone or side chain-side chain. Amino acid type and number are indicated. See Figures 6.1, 6.2.
The interaction networks have been extensively compared with known cases in literature, observing
a good assessment of the amino acids involved in protein interfaces. The comparison shows that Gemini
detects rather accurately the amino acids geometrically and chemically involved in the interfaces. The
chemical accuracy is particularly remarkable since the GeminiDistances selection is based on the geometry of the interface and no chemical selection is done. This recalls Crick’s concept that he formulated
observing α-coiled coil interfaces: the analysis of the geometry of a protein interface leads to its chemical
specificity [16].

6.2

Developments

There are basically three lines of development that emerge from the Gemini interaction networks. I will
briefly present them.
Firstly, the interaction networks must be analysed and systematically compared, looking for patterns.
Many parameters can matter. The polarity of the residues has been preliminarily studied in [19]. Some
statistics on the length of the side chain and the differential use of the amino acids has been presented
in [17] and, previously, in [20]. This research continues with the main focus on the interfaces formed
by the alignment of two parallel or antiparallel β strands. Nearly 60 representatives have been collected
for this geometry that I will call 2β. Indeed, the ladder structure of Figure 6.1 is extremely frequently
observed in this type of interface but is not observed in other interface geometries, thus it is a candidate
to be a distinctive feature. This is a good example of the patterns that I would like to trace in the Gemini
graphs: features that allow to distinguish geometries and to characterize their chemical properties. The
preliminary analyses cited indicate that the amino acids are “flexible”, they adapt to play different roles;
this suggests that specific features will not be at the amino acid level but possibly to the lower level of
atomic groups in the side chain. Moreover, the investigations point toward the joined structure, in which
both the sides of an interface are important. Patterns or elementary blocks must appear in an interface,
not just in a sequence.
Secondly, interaction networks can be used to propose amino acid substitution and test the effects
with in vitro experiments. Moreover, the principles itself that I have adopted in designing the Gemini

Figure 6.2. The top image enlights the α and β structures of the interface of the trimeric
membrane protein TolC (PDB: 1EK9) of Escherichia coli. The bottom image contains the
Gemini graph of the interface. The right part shows the same ladder structure of Figure 6.1;
the left part instead is characterized by more separated amino acids, with a distance along
the sequence that oscillates between 3 and 4 residues, and the presence of structures like
the letter “V”, with angular separation of 3-4 residues. Indeed, this left part is an interface
formed by two α-helices. Actually, it is a big α-coiled coil interface of 12 α-helices winded
up in a big helix.

programs can be tested against these experiments. Given a network of interactions, it is reasonable to
expect that the effect of a mutation will be different according to which amino acid is modified. In
particular, little effect is expected on amino acids marked by a dot, big effect is expected for amino acids
with many connections. The experimental part is of pertinence of C. Lesieur and is performed at the
facilities of the BioPark of Archamps. One indication that has been found is that some interfaces are
“active” even in the absence of the rest of the chain. This means that the subunits can recognize each
other even when the rest of the chain has been removed. An opposite result would have indicated that
the whole chain is always needed for the assembly, thus showing a marginal role of the interface.
Thirdly, one can imagine to simulate the process of association of two subunits. For this, a software
is available, Simulation of Diffusional Association SDA [21]. This software implements the Langevin
equation for Brownian motion and allows to trace Brownian trajectories of two molecules in water.
Statistics on the trajectories produces the association rates, namely the number of encounters per time,
and the residence time. Clearly, these simulations can replace in vitro experiments of association. The
interest, for the Gemini team researches, is to test artificially created interfaces and study their interactions. My student J. Zrimi has invested his internship in simulating the association of different subunits
of three proteins [18, 22], leading to the confirmation of a role of the four histidine in the association of
these proteins.
97

I am directly involved in the first and third of these projects, the second being based on experimental
manipulations.

Discussion

The Annecy team groups the competences and the facilities to work on both the theoretical and the
experimental aspects of protein assembly, to understand the mechanisms of assembly, the sequencestructure-interface relationship, and the structural determinants of the interface geometry. I have created
the team and I am the main responsible of the theoretical part. The most important result has been the
creation of the programs Gemini [12], of which I am the main author (80%). For the graphical part, I
asked the collaboration of my internship student [23]. The creation of these program was, more than just
writing lines of code, the search of the correct ideas to translate a three-dimensional all atoms information
into a synthetic description of the most relevant interactions. This process lasted for more than one year.
Of course, the principles implemented in Gemini have been largely discussed with C. Lesieur and also
with L. Vuillon. I have tutored several internship students. In particular, J. Zrimi has been here for a five
months internship. He was student of Master 2 at the Master “Production et Valorisation des Substances
Naturelles et Biopolyméres” of the Faculty of sciences and techniques of Marrakech. He will come again
to our laboratory for his PhD studies.
A very important event, of which I am promoter and co-organizer, is the conference “Theoretical
approaches for the genome and the proteins”, TAGp2010, that will take place in Annecy-Le-Vieux in
October 2010. This conference follows two previous meetings, 2008, 2006, that were focused on the
genome.
