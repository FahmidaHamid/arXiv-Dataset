A mathematically assisted reconstruction of the initial focus of the yellow
fever outbreak in Buenos Aires (1871)
M L Fernández,1 M Otero,2 N Schweigmann,3 H G Solari2∗
We discuss the historic mortality record corresponding to the initial focus of the yellow
fever epidemic outbreak registered in Buenos Aires during the year 1871 as compared
to simulations of a stochastic population dynamics model. This model incorporates the
biology of the urban vector of yellow fever, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, the stages of
the disease in the human being as well as the spatial extension of the epidemic outbreak.
After introducing the historical context and the restrictions it puts on initial conditions and
ecological parameters, we discuss the general features of the simulation and the dependence
on initial conditions and available sites for breeding the vector. We discuss the sensitivity,
to the free parameters, of statistical estimators such as: final death toll, day of the year
when the outbreak reached half the total mortality and the normalized daily mortality,
showing some striking regularities. The model is precise and accurate enough to discuss the
truthfulness of the presently accepted historic discussions of the epidemic causes, showing
that there are more likely scenarios for the historic facts.

During the end of the XVIII and the XIX centuries, YF caused large urban outbreaks in the
Americas from Boston (1798), New York (1798)
and Philadelphia (1793, 1797, 1798, 1799) in the
North [3] to Montevideo (1857) and Buenos Aires
(1858, 1870, 1871) [4] in the South. These historical
episodes arise as ideal cases for testing the capabilities of YF models in urban settings. Is it possible to
reconstruct the evolution of one of these epidemic
outbreaks? Can enough information be recovered
to produce a thorough test on the models? This

is seldom the case, for example, for the study of
the Memphis (1878) epidemic, with over 10000 casualties, only 1965 were considered potentially usable [5]. In contrast, the records of the outbreak in
Buenos Aires 1871, unearthed and digitized for this
work, left us with an amount of 1274 death cases
located in time and space for the initial focus in
the quarter of San Telmo, about 78% of the total
mortality in the quarter [6]. According to the 1869
national census [7] Buenos Aires had 177787 inhabitants, 12329 of them living in San Telmo, about half
of them just immigrated into the country mostly
from Europe.
In this work, we will compare the initial development of the epidemic outbreak (Buenos Aires,
1871) with the simulations resulting from an ecoepidemiological model developed in Refs. [8–10],
testing the worth of the predictive model.
The simulations were performed under a number
of assumptions, most of them essentially forced by
the lack of better information. We will assume that:
1. Now and before, YF is the same illness, i.e.,
we can use current information on YF development such as: the average extent of the incubation, infection, recovery, and toxic periods, as well as the mortality level in 1871. In
other words, the virus presents no substantial
changes since 1871 to present days. We do
not expect this hypothesis to be completely
correct: the YF virus is an RNA-virus as opposed to the stable DNA-viruses, as such, mutations in about 140 years of continuous replications in mosquitoes and primates can hardly
be ruled out. Furthermore, present-day YF
has been subject to different evolutionary pressures than the YF in the XIX century. While
in the XIX century yellow fever circulated continuously in human populations, today the
wild part of the cycle involving wild populations of monkeys plays a substantial role.
2. The epidemic was transmitted by Aedes aegypti. There is no evidence of this fact since
the scientific society and medical doctors in
general were not aware of the role played by
the mosquito until the confirmation given by
Reed [3] of Finlay’s ideas [11]. 1
1 According to other sources, it was Beauperthuy [12]
the first one to accurately describe the transmission of YF

We assume that Aedes aegypti has not changed
since then, and/or there are no substantial
changes in the life cycle, vector capabilities
and adaptation between the (assumed) population in 1871 and present-day populations
in Buenos Aires city. After the eradication
campaign (1958–1965) [14], Aedes aegypti was
eradicated from Buenos Aires [15]. Hence, the
present populations result from a re-infestation
and they are not the direct descendants of the
mosquitoes population of 1871.
3. Lacking time statistics for the duration of the
different stages in the development of the illness, reproduction of the virus and life cycle
of the mosquito, we use, as distribution for
such events, a maximum likelihood distribution subject to the constrain of the average
value for the cycle. In short, we use exponentially distributed times for the next event for
all type of events.
4. Finally, and most importantly, we assume that
the human population mobility is not a factor
in the local spread of the disease. We anticipate one of our conclusions: this assumption
is likely to be false for the full development of
the epidemic outbreak but seems reasonable
for the early (silent) development. The study
of the secondary foci of the epidemic outbreak
merits a detailed analysis of the social and political circumstances related to human mobility
and it is beyond the possibilities of this study.
Since we want the test to be as demanding as
possible, more information is needed to simulate
the outbreak eliminating sources of ambiguity and
parameters to be fitted using the same test data.
We recovered the following information:
1. Estimations of daily temperatures. They are
relevant since the temperature regulates the
developmental rates of the mosquitoes.
2. A very rough, anecdotal, estimation of the
availability of breeding sites (BS) that, ultimately, control the carrying capacity of the
by mosquitoes, as observed in the epidemic outbreak at
Cumaná, Venezuela (1853), as well as the efficient measures
of protection taken by Native Americans, the use of nets to
prevent the spread of the epidemic [13].

environment, the number of vectors and the

and controlled by mass vaccination campaigns.

3. Human populations discriminated by block in
the city.

The first symptoms of the disease usually
appear 3–6 days after infection. The first,
or acute, phase is characterized by fever,
muscle pain, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. After 3–4
days, most patients improve and symptoms disappear. However, in a few cases,
the disease enters a toxicphase: fever
reappears, and the patient develops jaundice and sometimes bleeding, with blood
appearing in the vomit (the typical vomito
negro). About 50% of patients who enter
the toxic phase die within 10–14 days”.

4. Estimations of the date of arrival of the virus
to the city, putting bounds to the reasonable
initial conditions for the simulation.
This climatological, social and historical information represents a determining part of the reconstruction as it is integrated into the model jointly
with the entomological and medical information
to produce stochastic simulations of possible outbreaks to be compared with the historic records of
casualties.
We will show that the model predicts large probabilities for the occurrence of YF in the given historical circumstances and it is also able to answer
why a minor outbreak in 1870 did not progress towards a large epidemic. The total number of deaths
and the time-evolution of the death record will be
shown to agree between the historical record and
the simulated episodes as well, within the original
focus.
The rest of the manuscript will be organized as
follows: we will begin with the description of YF in
section II, including the eco-epidemiological model.
In section III, we will address the relevant climatological, social and historical aspects. In section IV,
we will explore the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions and the number of available breeding sites, discussing the statistics more clearly influenced by vector abundance. The historic mortality
records and the simulated records are compared in
section V.. We will finally discuss the performance
of the model in section VI.

We add that the remission period lasts between 2
and 48 hours [17], and as it was mentioned in the
introduction, not only Aedes mosquitoes transmit
the disease.

The model

The yellow fever model is rather similar to the already presented dengue model [10], the similarity
corresponds to the fact that dengue is produced
by a Flavivirus as well, it is transmitted by the
same vector and follows the same clinical sequence
in the human being, although with substantially
lesser mortality.
The model describes the life cycle of the mosquito
[8] and its dispersalafter a blood meal, seeking
oviposition sites [9]. The mosquito goes through
several stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult (non parous),
flyer (i.e., the mosquito dispersing) and adult
(parous). In each stage, the mosquito can die or
continue the cycle with a transition rate between
the subpopulations that depends on the temperature. The mortality in the larva stage is nonlinear

pupae and non parous adults are always susceptible.
The humans are subdivided in subpopulations
according to their status with respect to the illness as: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infective (I),
in remission (r), toxic (T) and recovered (R). The
temporary remission period is followed by recovery
with a probability between 0.75 and 0.85 or a toxic
period (probability 0.25 to 0.15) which ends half of
the times in death and half of the times in recovery.
The yellow fever model differs in the structure from
the dengue model in Ref. [10], as the human part
of the dengue model is SEIR and the yellow fever
model is SEIrRTD. However, the additional stages
do not alter the evolution of the epidemic since the
“in remission”, toxic and dead stages do not participate in the transmission of the virus. The YF
parameters are presented in Table 1.

The model is compartmental, all populations

evolve by a stochastic process in which the time
of the next event is exponentially distributed and
the events compete with probabilities proportional
to their rates in a process known as densitydependent-Poisson-process [18]. The model can be
understood qualitatively with the scheme of the

human is infective and the other susceptible (red

Historical, social and climatological information

When and how the epidemic started

The YF outbreak in Buenos Aires (1871) was one
of a series of large epidemic outbreaks associated
to the end of the War of the Triple Alliance or
Paraguayan war. The war confronted Argentina,
Brazil and Uruguay (the three allies) on one side

oners from Brazil (where YF was almost endemic
at that time) to Asunción triggered a large epidemic outbreak [4]. The allied troops received their
main logistic support from Corrientes (Argentina),
a city with 11218 inhabitants according to the 1869
census [7], located about 300 km south of Asunción (following the waterway) and 1000 km north
of Buenos Aires along the Paraná river (see Fig.
3). On December 14, 1870, the first case of YF
was diagnosed in Corrientes [19], and a focus developed around this case imported from Asunción.
According to some sources, the epidemic produced
panic, resulting in about half the population leaving the city between December 15 and January 15
[20]. However, other historical reasons might have
played a relevant role since the city of Corrientes
was under the influence and ruling of Buenos Aires,
while in the farmlands, the General Ricardo López
Jordan was commanding a rebel army (a sequel of
Argentina civil wars and the war of the Triple Alliance). The subversion ended with the battle of
Ñaembé, about 200 km east of Corrientes, on January 26, 1871.
Putting things in perspective, we must realize
that in those times, YF was recognized only in its
toxic stage associated to the black vomit, it is then
perfectly plausible that recently infected individuals would have left Corrientes and Asunción reaching Buenos Aires, despite quarantine measures that
were late and leaky [4,22].2 The death toll in Corrientes was of 1289 people in the city (and about 700
more in places around the city) [20], representing
a 11,5% of the population (notice that this number is not consistent with current numbers in use
by WHO [17] which indicate a 7.5% of mortality
in diagnosed cases of YF but is well in line with
historical reports [23] of 20% to 70% mortality in
diagnosed cases —the statistical basis has changed
with the improved knowledge of early, not toxic,
YF cases.
According to this historical view, the initial arrival of infectious people to Buenos Aires happened,
more likely, during December 1870 and January
1871. In his study of the YF epidemic, written
twenty three years after the epidemic outbreak,
José Penna (MD) [4] quotes the issue of the journal
2 On December 16, a sanitary official from Buenos Aires
was commissioned to Corrientes to organize the quarantine,
a measure that was applied to ships coming from Paraguay
but not to those with Corrientes as departing port.

and computer representation. The red colored area
in district 14 (San Telmo) are the two blocks where
the 1871 epidemic started. The green colored area
in district 3 is the block where the Hotel Roma was
and where the 1870 focus began (see section V.iii.).
The red and green lines sourround the region simulated for the 1871 epidemics and the 1870 focus,
respectively. Notice that districts 15 and 13 disagree in the maps. The computer representation
follows the information in Ref. [21] from where the
population information was obtained.

“Revista Médico Quirúrgica”, published in Buenos
Aires on December 23, 1870 [24], which presents a
report regarding the sanitary situation during the
last fifteen days, indicating the emergence of a “bilious fever” and a general tendency of other fevers
to produce icterus or jaundice. In the next issue,
dated January 8, 1871, the “Revista” indicates an
important increase in the number of bilious fever

cases reported [22]. In a separate article, the doctors call the attention on how easily and how often the quarantine to ships coming from Paraguay
is avoided, and calls for strengthening the measures. Penna indicates that the “bilious fever” (not
a standard term in medicine) likely corresponded to
milder cases of YF. We will term this idea “Penna’s
conjecture” and will come back to it later.
For our initial guess, we considered this information as evidence that the epidemic outbreak started
during December, 1870. Exploring the model, and
arbitrarily, we took December 16, 1870, as the
time to introduce two infectious people with YF in
the simulations, at the blocks where the mortality
started. Yet, an educated guess for Penna’s conjecture is to consider the 3–6 days needed from infection to clinical manifestation and the 9–12 days
of the extrinsic cycle. Hence, since the first clinical manifestations of transmitted YF happened between December 11–23, we would guess the infected
people arriving somewhere between November 21
and December 11.

ity committee in charge during the YF epidemic.
Wilde and Mallo advocated for the spontaneous
origin of the disease, very much in line with the
theories of miasmas in use in those times, theories that guided the sanitary measures taken [19].
Wilde and Mallo also argued that Asunción could
not be the origin of the epidemic, because of their
belief that the ten or fifteen days quarantine (counting since the last port touched) was enough to avoid
the propagation of the disease. This belief contrasts
with the experience of 1870 (in Buenos Aires) where
a ten day quarantine was not enough to prevent a
minor epidemic [4]. Nevertheless, the quarantine
measures werefully implemented in Corrientes by
December 31, 1870. The measures were later lifted
because of the epidemic in Corrientes and implemented at ports down the Paraná river, being completed nearby Buenos Aires (ports of La Conchas,
Tigre, San Fernando and “La Boca” within Buenos
Aires city) by mid-February when the epidemic was
in full development in Buenos Aires according to
the port sanitary authorities, Wilde and Mallo [19].
Being Corrientes the source of infected people
can hardly be disregarded. With about 5000 people
leaving the city between December 15 and January
15 [19], a city where YF was developing.
According to Wilde and Mallo [19], there were
(non-fatal?) YF cases in Buenos Aires as early
as January 6, 1871, reported by MDs Argerich
and Gallarani as well as documented cases of YF
death after disembarking in Rosario (200 km North
of Buenos Aires along the Paraná river) having
boarded in Corrientes.

Breeding sites

One of the key elements in the reconstruction
and simulation of an epidemic transmitted by
mosquitoes is to have an estimation of their numbers which will be reflected directly in the propagation of the epidemic. In the mosquito model [8],
this number is regulated by the quality and abunFigure 3: A 1870 map [25] showing Asunción next dance of breeding sites. The production of a single

the number of sites available for breeding today is
already a difficult task, the estimation of breeding
sites available in 1871 is a nearly impossible one.
In what remains of this subsection, we will try to
get a very rough a-priori estimate.

Mortality data

For this work, the daily mortality data recorded
during the 1871 epidemic outbreak [6] is key. This
statistical work has received no attention in the
past, and no study of the YF outbreak in Buenos
Aires made reference to this information. We have
cross-checked the information with data in the 1869
national census [7], as well as with data in published
works [4], and the details are consistent among
these sources.
The data set is presented here closing the historic
research part.

Revising the clinical development of yellow fever.

A YF epidemic outbreak happened in Buenos
Aires, in 1870, developing about 200 cases [4] (the
text is ambiguous on whether the cases are toxic
or fatal). The epidemic outbreak was noticed by
February 22 (first death), a sailor who left Rio de
Janeiro (Brazil) on February 7, and presumably
landed on February 17 (no cases of YF were reported on board of the Poitou —the boat).

Daily mortality (historic)

eggs for July 1, 1868 is used to initialize the code,
and then run over a transitory of two years. Such
procedure has been found to give reliable results
[8]. There are several factors in the biology of Ae.
ae. that indicate that the biological response to
air-temperature fluctuations is reflected in attenuated fluctuations of biological variables. First, the
larvae and pupae develop in water containers, thus,
what matters is the water temperature. This fact
represents a first smoothing of air-temperature fluctuations. Second, insects developmental rates for
fluctuating temperature environments correspond
to averages in time of rates obtained in constant
temperature environments [29], an alternative view
is that development depends on accumulated heat
[30]. Such averages occur over a period of about 6
days at 30◦ C and longer times for other temperatures and non-optimal food conditions [31]. Third,
the biting rate (completion of the gonotrophic cycle) depends as well on temperatures averaged over
a period of a few days. Last, mosquitoes actively
seek the conditions that fit best to them and more
often than not, they are found resting inside the
houses.

Figure 5: Daily mortality cases in the police district

This well documented case allows us to see the
margins of tolerance that have to be exercised in
taking medical information prepared for clinical
use as statistical information. Assume, following
Penna, that the sailor was exposed to YF before
boarding in Rio de Janeiro, according to information in Table 1 collected from the Pan American

the sailor was close to the limit of his infectious period. He was not toxic, according to the MD on
board who signed a certificate accepted by the sanitary authority. Yet, five days later, he was dying,
making the remission plus toxic period of 5 days,
shorter than the range of 7–12 days listed in Table 1 and substantially shorter than the 10–15 days
(remission plus toxic) communicated in Ref. [16].
Shall we assume as precise the values reported in
Ref. [16, 17] we would have to conclude that the
disease was substantially different, at least in its
clinical evolution, in 1871 as compared with present
days.
In clinical studies performed during a YF epidemic on the Jos Plateau, Nigeria, Jones and Wilson [32] report a 45.6% overall mortality and a
significant difference in the duration of the illness
for fatal and non-fatal cases with averages of 6.4
and 17.8 days. Série et al. [33] reports for the
1960–1962 epidemic in Ethiopia a mortality rang-

Papers in Physics, vol. 5, art. 050002 (2013) / M L Fernández et al.
ing from 43% (Kouré) to 100% (Boloso) and 50%
(Menéra) with a total duration of the clinic phase
of the illness of 7.14, 2.14 and 4.5 days, respectively
(weighted average of 4.6 days in 18 cases).
We must conclude that the extension of the toxic
period preceding the death presents high variability. This variability may represent variability in the
illness or in medical criteria. For example, Série
[33] indicates that the 100% mortality found at the
Boloso Hospital is associated to the admission criteria giving priority to the most severe cases. In
correspondence with this extremely high mortality
level, the survival period is the shortest registered.
The minimum length of the clinical phase is of 10–
14 days or 13–18 days, depending of the source
(adding viremic, remission and toxic periods). We
note that not only the toxic period of fatal cases
must be shorter than the same period for non-fatal
cases, but also the viremic period must be shorter
in average, if all the pieces of data are consistent.
The time elapsed between the first symptoms and
death is probably longer today than in 1871, since
it, in part, reflects the evolution of medical knowledge. The hospitalization time is also rather arbitrary and changes with medical practices which do
not reflect changes in the disease.
A rudimentary procedure to correct for this differences is to shift the simulated mortality some
fixed time between 5 and 8 days (the difference between our 13 days guessed (Table 1) and the 4.5–
6.4 reported for Africa [32, 33]). Such a procedure
is not conceptually optimal, but it is as much as
it can be done within present knowledge. We certainly do not know whether just the toxic period
must be shortened or the viremic period must be
shortened as well, and in the latter case, how this
would affect the spreading of the disease.
A second source of discrepancies between
recorded data and simulations are the inaccuracies
in the historic record. Can we consider the daily
mortality record as a perfect account? Which was
the protocol used to produce it? We can hardly
expect it to be perfect, although we will not make
any provision for this potential source of error.

of the police districts 14 (San Telmo), 16, 2 and
4, corresponding to Concepción, Catedral Sur and
Montserrat; and part of the districts 6, 18, 19, 19A
and 20 (see Fig. 2), and totalized for each police district to obtain daily mortality comparable
to those reported in Ref. [6] and picture in Fig.
5. Numerical mosquitoes were not allowed to fly
over the river. At the remaining borders of the
simulated region, a Stochastic Newmann Boundary Condition was used, meaning that the mosquito
population of the next block across the boundary
was considered equal to the block inside the region;
but the number of mosquito dispersion events associated to the outside block was drawn randomly,
independently of the events in the corresponding inner block. Larger regions for the simulations were
tested producing no visible differences.
The time step was set to the small value of 30
s, avoiding the introduction of further complications in the program related to fast event rates for
tiny populations [34], although an implementation
of the method in Ref. [34], not relying on the smallness of the time step so heavily, is desirable for a
production phase of the program.
Before we proceed to the comparison between
the historic mortality records of the epidemic and
the simulated results, we need to gain some understanding regarding the sensitivity of the simulations to the parameters guessed and the best forms
of presenting these results. We performed a moderate set of computations, since the code has not
been optimized for speed and it is highly demanding for the personal computers where it runs for
several days. Here, we illustrate the main lessons
learned in our explorations. Poor people, unable to
buy large quantities of water, had to rely mostly
on the cisterns and other forms of keeping rain water. Since 1852, when the population of Buenos
Aires was about 76000 people, there was an important immigration flow, increasing the population
to about 178000 people by 1869 [7]. The immigrants occupied large houses where they rented a
room, usually for an entire family, a housing that
was known as “conventillo” and was the dominant
form of housing in some districts such as San Telmo,
where the epidemic started [20]. In some police
chronicles of the time, houses with as many as 300

presentation will let us realize that most of the fluctuation is concentrated in the total epidemic size,
while the daily evolution is relatively regular, except, perhaps, in the time taken to develop up to
50% of the mortality (depending on the abundance
of vectors and the initial number of infected humans and chance).
i.

Total mortality (epidemic size)

Since historical records include mostly the number
of causalities, it appears sensible for the purposes
of this study to use the total number of deaths as
a proxy statistics for epidemic size.

Frequency in 100 runs

has to be counted as orders of magnitude larger
than present-day available sites.
An a-priori and conservative estimation is to consider about ten times the number of breeding sites
estimated today. Thus, we assume, as a first guess,
300 breeding sites per block in San Telmo. We
will have to tune this number later as it regulates
mosquito populations and the development of the
epidemic focus. The number of breeding sites is the
only parameter tuned to the results in this work.
More precisely, the criteria adopted was to make
the number of (normalized) BS proportional to the
number of houses per block taken from historic
records [21], adjusting the proportionality factor to
the observed dynamics. We introduce the notation
BSxY to indicate a multiplicative factor of Y.
The population of each police district was set
to the density values reported in the 1869 census
[7, 21] and the police districts geography was taken
from police records [36] and referenced according
to maps of the city at the time [37–40].
Table 2 shows the average population per block,
initially estimated number of breeding sites and
number of houses for the district of the initial focus,
San Telmo #14 and nearby districts (# 16, 4, 2).
A sketch of Buenos Aires police districts according
to a 1887 map [37] is displayed alongside with the
computer representation in Fig. 2.
It is a known feature of stochastic epidemic models [41] that the distribution of totals of infected
people has two main contributions. One is that the
small epidemic outbreaks when none or a few secondary cases are produced and the extinction time
of the outbreak comes quickly. The otheris that the
large epidemic outbreaks which, if the basic reproductive number is large enough, present a Gaussian
shape separated by a valley of improbable epidemic
sizes from the small outbreaks.
While the present model does not fall within the
class of models discussed in Ref. [41], the general considerations applied to stochastic SIR models qualitatively apply to the present study. Yet,
simulations started early during the summer season
follow the pattern just described in Ref. [41], but
simulations started later do not present the probability valley between large and small epidemics.
We have found useful to present the results disaggregated in the form: epidemic size, daily percentage of mortality relative to the total mortality
and time to achieve half of the final mortality. This

The total mortality depends strongly on the
stochastic nature of the simulations, initial conditions and ecological parameters guessed. Qualitatively, the results agree with the intuition, although
this is an a-posteriori statement, i.e., only after seeing the results we can find intuitive interpretations
for them.

people. For our original guess, factor 1, the epidemic is limited by the seasonal presence/absence
of vectors. However, for higher factors, there is
a substantial increase in large epidemic outbreaks
with larger probabilities for larger epidemics. Only
for the factor 4 (BSx4) the most likely bin includes
the historical value of 1274 deaths.
A second feature, already shown in the Dengue
model [10], is that outbreaks starting with the arrival of infectious people in late spring will have a
lesser chance to evolve into a major epidemic. Yet,
those that by chance develop are likely to become
large epidemic outbreaks since they have more time
to evolve. On the contrary, outbreaks started in
autumn will have low chances to evolve and not
a large number of casualties. The corresponding
histograms can be seen in Fig. 7. Figure 7 also
shows how the outbreaks that begin on December
16, as well as simulations starting on January 1,
present higher probabilities of large epidemics than
of small epidemics, but this tendency is reverted
in simulations of outbreaks that start by February
16. This transition is, again, the transition between
outbreaks regulated by the number of available susceptible humans and those regulated by the presence or absence of vectors.

ii.

Mortality progression

One of the most remarkable facts unveiled by the
simulations is that when the time evolution of the
mortality is studied as a fraction of the total mortality, much of the stochastic fluctuations are eliminated and the curves present only small differences
(see Fig. 8). The similarity of the normalized evolution allows us to focus on the time taken to produce half of the mortality (labelled T1/2 ).
We notice, in Fig. 8, that the T1/2 in these runs
lay between 69–110, compared to the historic values
of T1/2 =73.
The latter observation brings the attention to a
remarkable fact of the simulations: not only the
normalized progression of the outbreaks are rather
similar but also, there is a correspondence between
early development and large mortality. Drawing
T1/2 against total-mortality (Fig. 9), we see that
even for different number of breeding sites, all the
simulations indicate that the final size is a noisy
function of the day when the mortality reaches half
its final value. This function is almost constant for
small T1/2 and becomes linear with increasing dispersion when T1/2 is relatively large. Once again,
the two different forms the outbreak is controlled.

To achieve this goal, we need to compare the
daily mortality in the historical record and the simulations. Since, in the model, the mortality proceeds day after day with independent random increments (as a consequence of the Poisson character of the model), it is reasonable to consider the

V.

Real against simulated epidemic

We would like to establish the credibility of the
statement: the historic mortality record for the San
Telmo focus belongs to the statistics generated by

Tuning of the simulations

Before we proceed, we have to find an acceptable
number of breeding sites, a reasonable day for the
arrival of infected individuals (assumed to be 2 individuals arbitrarily) and adjust for the uncertainty
in survival time. Actually, moving the day of arrival
d days earlier and shortening the survival time by
d will have essentially the same effect on the simulated mortality (providing d is small), which is to
shift the full series by d days. This is, assigning to
the day i the simulated mortality SM of the day
i + d, (SM (i + d)). Hence, only two of the parameters will be obtained from this data.
As we have previously observed, the total mortality presents a large variance in the simulations.
Moreover, in medical accounts of modern time
[32, 33], the mortality ranges between 46% and
100% while in historical accounts the percentage
goes from 20 to 70 [23]. Hence, a simple adjustment
of the mortality coefficient from our arbitrary 50%
within such a wide range would suffice to eliminate
the contributions of the total epidemic size. The
average simulated epidemic for BSx4 is of ≈ 1248
deaths while the historic record is of 1274 deaths.

1, the value of the statistic χ2 , the number of degrees of freedom, and the probability P (x > χ2 ) for
a random variable x distributed as a χ2 -distribution
with the indicated degrees of freedom. The standard reading of the χ2 test indicates that, for BSx3
and BSx4, the statement “the deviations from the
simulations mean of the historic record (deviations
assumed to be distributed as χ2 with the indicated
degrees) belong to the simulated set” is not found
likely to be false by the test in the cases BSx3 and
BSx4.
Hence, to match the mean with the historic record,
it would suffice to correct the mortality from 50%
to 51%.
We can disregard the idea that the epidemic
started before December 20, 1870 (Penna’s conjecture), since it is not possible to simultaneously
obtain an acceptable final mortality and an acceptable evolution of the outbreak. Our best attempt
corresponds to an epidemic starting by December
14, 1870, which averages ≈ 1212 deaths and with a
deviation of the mortality of χ2 = 219.1 with 175
degrees, giving a probability P (x ≥ 219, 1) = 0.01.
We focus on arrival dates around January 1,
1871. We can also disregard, for this initial condition, the original guess BSx1 corresponding to 300
breeding sites per block in San Telmo, since it produces too small epidemics. We present results for

Final mortality, 1870

Except for the precise initial condition, corresponding to one viremic (infective) person located
at the Hotel Roma (district 4 in Fig. 2), the information is too imprecise to produce a demanding
test for the model.
We performed a set of 100 simulations introducing one viremic (infective) person at the precise
block where the Hotel Roma was, on February 17.
The number of breeding sites was kept at the same
factor 4 with respect to the values tabulated in Table 2 that was used for the best results in the study
of the 1871 outbreak. Needless to say, this does not
need to be true, as the number of breeding sites may
change from season to season.
The distribution of the final mortality is shown
in Fig. 11. As we can see, relatively small epidemics of less than 200 deaths cannot be ruled out,
although there are much larger epidemics also likely
to happen.

For the smallest epidemics simulated, the secondary mortality starts after March 30. Hence, the
1870 focus can be understood as a case of relative

translation of the mosquito’s biology into a computer code has been performed earlier [8,9] and the
basis for the spreading of a disease by this vector
has been elaborated in the case of Dengue previously [10]. The present model for YF is then an
adaptation of the Dengue model to the particularities of YF, and the present attempt of validation
(failed falsification) reflects also on the validity of
this earlier work.
The present study owes its existence to the work
of anonymous police officers [6] that gathered and
recorded epidemics statistics during the epidemic
outbreak, in a city that was not only devastated by
the epidemic, but where the political authorities
left in the middle of the drama as well [20].
We have gathered (and implemented in a model)
entomological, ecological and medical information,
as well as geographic, climatological and social information. After establishing the historical constraints restricting our attempts to simulate the
historical event, we have adjusted the density of
breeding sites to be the equivalent to 1200 halfliter pots as those encountered in today Buenos
Aires cemeteries (the number corresponds to San
Telmo quarter). Perhaps a better idea of the number of mosquitoes present is given by the maximum of the average number of bites per person
per day estimated by the model, which results in 5
bites/(person day) (to be precise: the ratio between
the maximum number of bites in a block during a
week and the population of the block, divided by
seven).
The population of the domestic mosquito Aedes
aegypti in Buenos Aires 1870–1871 was large
enough to almost assure the propagation of YF
during the summer season. The only effective
measures preventing the epidemic were the natural quarantine resulting from the distance to tropical cities were YF was endemic (such as Rio de
Janeiro) and the relatively small window for large
epidemics, since the extinction of the adult form
of the mosquito during the winter months prevents
the overwintering of YF. In this sense, the relatively
small outbreak of 1870 is an example of how a late
arrival of the infected individual combined with a
touch of luck produced only a minor sanitary catastrophe.
By 1871, as a consequence of the end of the
Paraguayan war and the emergence of YF in Asunción, the conditions for an almost unavoidable epi-

demic in Buenos Aires were given. The intermediate step taken in Corrientes, with the panic and
partial evacuation of the city, adding the lack of
quarantine measures, was more than enough to
make certain the epidemic in Buenos Aires. On the
contrary, Penna’s conjecture of an earlier starting
during December, 1870 are inconsistent with the
biological and medical times as implemented in the
model. We can disregard this conjecture as highly
improbable.
The historic mortality record is consistent with
an epidemic starting between December 28 and
January 5, being the symptomatic period (viremic
plus remission plus toxic) of the illness between 13
and 5 days. Furthermore, the existence of nonfatal cases of YF by January 6 mentioned by some
sources [19] would be consistent, provided the cases
were imported.
In retrospect, the present research began as an
attempt to validate/falsificate the YF model and,
in more general terms, the model for the transmission of viral diseases by Aedes aegypti using the
historic data of this large YF epidemic. As the research progressed, it became increasingly evident
that the model was robust. In successive attempts,
every time the model failed to produce a reasonable
result, it forced us to revise the epidemiological and
historical hypotheses. In these revisions, we ended
up realizing that the accepted origin of the epidemic
in imported cases from Brazil, actually hides the
central role that the epidemics in Corrientes had,
and the gruesome failure of not quarantining Corrientes once the mortality started by December 16,
1870, about two weeks before the deducted beginning of the outbreak in Buenos Aires.
The same study of inconsistencies between the
data and the reconstruction made us focus on the
survival time of those clinically diagnosed with YF
that finally die. The form in which the illness
evolves anticipates the final result. Jones and Wilson [32] indicate the symptoms of cases with a bad
prognosis including the rapidity and degree of jaundice. This information suggests, in terms of modeling, that death is not one of two possible outcomes
at the end of the “toxic period”, as we have first
thought. Separation of to-recover and to-die subpopulations could (should?) be performed earlier
in the development of the illness, each subpopulation having its own parameters for the illness. Yet,
while in theory this would be desirable, in prac-

050002-15

Papers in Physics, vol. 5, art. 050002 (2013) / M L Fernández et al.
tice it would have, for the time being, no effect,
since the characteristic periods of the illness have
not been measured in these terms.
Epidemics transmitted by vectors come to an end
either when the susceptible population has been
sufficiently exposed so that the replication of the
virus is slowed down (the classical consideration in
SIR models) or when the vector’s population is decimated by other (for example, climatic) reasons.
The model shows that both situations can be distinguished in terms of the mortality statistics.
We have also shown that the total mortality of
the epidemic is not difficult to adjust by changing
the death probability of the toxic phase, and as
such, it is not a demanding test for a model. The
daily mortality, when normalized, shows sensitivity
to the mosquito abundance, specially in the evolution times involved, since the general qualitative
shape appears to be fixed. In particular, the date in
which the epidemic reaches half the total mortality
is advanced by larger mosquito populations. However, only comparison of the simulated and historical daily mortality put enough constraints to the
free data in the model (date of arrival of infected
people and mosquito population) to allow for a selection of possible combinations of their values.
As successful as the model appears to be, it is
completely unable to produce the total mortality
in the city, or the spatial extension of the full epidemic. The simulations produce with BSx4 less
than 4500 deaths, while in the historic record, the
total mortality in the city is above 13000 cases.
The historical account, and the recorded data, show
that after the initial San Telmo focus has developed, a second focus in the police district 13 (see
Fig. 2) developed, shortly several other foci developed that could not be tracked [4]. Unless the
spreading of the illness by infected humans is introduced (or some other method to make long jumps
by the illness), such events cannot be described.
It is worth noticing that the mobility patterns in
1871 are expected to be drastically different from
present patterns, and as such, the application of
models with human mobility [43] is not straightforward and requires a historical study.
One of the most important conclusions of this
work is that the logical consistency of mathematical modeling puts a limit to ad-hoc hypotheses, so
often used in a-posteriori explanations, as it forces
to accept not just the desired consequence of the

hypotheses, but all other consequences as well.
Last, eco-epidemiological models are adjusted
to vector populations pre-existing the actual epidemics and can therefore be used in prevention to
determine epidemic risk and monitor eradication
campaigns. In the present work, the tuning was
performed in epidemic data only because it is actually impossible to know the environmental conditions more than one hundred years ago. Yet, our
wild initial guess for the density of breeding sites
resulted sufficiently close to allow further tuning.

Appendix
Populations and events of the stochastic
transmission model

We consider a two dimensional space as a mesh
of squared patches where the dynamics of vectors, hosts and the disease take place. Only adult
mosquitoes, Flyers, can fly from one patch to a
next one according to a diffusion-like process. The
coordinates of a patch are given by two indices, i
and j, corresponding to the row and column in the
mesh. If Xk is a subpopulation in the stage k, then
Xk (i, j) is the Xk subpopulation in the patch of
coordinates (i, j).
Population of both hosts (Humans) and vectors
(Aedes aegypti) were divided into subpopulations
representing disease status: SEI for the vectors and
SEIrRTD for the human population.
Ten different subpopulations for the mosquito
were taken into account, three immature subpopulations: eggs E(i,j) , larvae L(i,j) and pupae P(i,j) ,
and seven adult subpopulations: non parous adults
A1(i,j) , susceptible flyers F s(i,j) , exposed flyers
F e(i,j) , infectious flyers F i(i,j) and parous adults

in the three disease status: susceptible A2s(i,j) , exposed A2e(i,j) and infectious A2i(i,j) .
The A1(i,j) is always susceptible, after a blood
meal it becomes a flyer, susceptible F s(i,j) or exposed F e(i,j) , depending on the disease status of
the host. If the host is infectious, A1(i,j) becomes
an exposed flyer F e(i,j) but if the host is not infectious, then the A1(i,j) becomes a susceptible flyer
F s(i,j) . The transmission of the virus depends not
only on the contact between vector and host but
also on the transmission probability of the virus.
In this case, we have two transmission probabilities: the transmission probability from host to vector ahv and the transmission probability from vector to host avh.
Human population N h(i,j) was split into seven
different subpopulations according to the disease
status: susceptible humans Hs(i,j) , exposed humans He(i,j) , infectious humans Hi(i,j) , humans in
remission state Hr(i,j) , toxic humans Ht(i,j) , removed humans HR(i,j) and dead humans because
of the disease Hd(i,j) .
The evolution of the seventeen subpopulations is
affected by events that occur at rates that depend
on subpopulation values and some of them also on
temperature, which is a function of time since it
changes over the course of the year seasonally [8,9].
ii.

Events related to immature stages

Table 4 summarizes the events and rates related to
immature stages of the mosquito during their first
gonotrophic cycle. The construction of the transition rates and the election of model parameters related to the mosquito biology such as: me mortality
of eggs, elr hatching rate, ml mortality of larvae, α
density-dependent mortality of larvae, lpr pupation
rate, mp: mortality of pupae, par pupae into adults
development coefficient and the ef emergence factor were described in detail previously [8, 9].
The natural regulation of Aedes aegypti populations is due to intra-specific competition for food
and other resources in the larval stage. This regulation was incorporated into the model as a densitydependent transition probability which introduces
the necessary nonlinearities that prevent a Malthusian growth of the population. This effect was incorporated as a nonlinear correction to the temperature dependent larval mortality.
Then, larval mortality can be written as:

mlL(i,j) + αL(i,j) × (L(i,j) − 1) where the value of α
can be further decomposed as α = α0 /BS(i,j) with
α0 being associated with the carrying capacity of
one (standardised) breeding site and BS(i,j) being
the density of breeding sites in the (i, j) patch [8,9].
iii.

Events related to the adult stage

Aedes aegypti females (A1 and A2) require blood
to complete their gonotrophic cycles. In this process, the female may ingest viruses with the blood
meal from an infectious human during the human
Viremic Period V P . The viruses develop within
the mosquito during the Extrinsic Incubation Period EIP and then are reinjected into the blood
stream of a new susceptible human with the saliva
of the mosquito in later blood meals. The virus
in the exposed human develops during the Intrinsic incubation Period IIP and then begin to circulate in the blood stream (Viremic Period), the
human becoming infectious. The flow from susceptible to exposed subpopulations (in the vector
and the host) depends not only on the contact between vector and host but also on the transmission
probability of the virus. In our case, there are two
transmission probabilities: the transmission probability from host to vector ahv and the transmission
probability from vector to host avh.
The events related to the adult stage are shown
in Table 5 to 8. Table 5 summarizes the events and
rates related to adults during their first gonotrophic
cycle and related to oviposition by flyers according
to their disease status.
Table 6 and Table 7 summarize the events and
rates related to adult 2 gonotrophic cycles, exposed
Adults 2 and exposed flyers becoming infectious
and human contagion.
Table 8 summarizes the events and rates related
to non parous adult (Adult 2) and Flyer death.
iv.

Events related to flyer dispersal

Some experimental results and observational studies show that the Aedes aegypti dispersal is driven
by the availability of oviposition sites [44–46]. According to these observations, we considered that
only the Flyers F(i,j) can fly from patch to patch
in search of oviposition sites. The implementation
of flyer dispersal has been described elsewhere [9].

Developmental Rate coefficients

The developmental rates that correspond to egg
hatching, pupation, adult emergence and the
gonotrophic cycles were evaluated using the results
of the thermodynamic model developed by Sharp
and DeMichele [47] and simplified by Schoofield et
al. [48]. According to this model, the maturation
process is controlled by one enzyme which is active in a given temperature range and is deacti-

Mortality coefficients

Egg mortality. The mortality coefficient of eggs is
me = 0.01 1/day, independent of temperature in
the range 278 K ≤ T ≤ 303 K [49].

Larval mortality. The value of α0 (associated to
the carrying capacity of a single breeding site) is
α0 = 1.5, and was assigned by fitting the model
to observed values of immatures in the cemeteries
of Buenos Aires [8]. The temperature dependent
larval death coefficient is approximated by ml =
0.01+0.9725 exp(−(T −278)/2.7035) and it is valid
in the range 278 K ≤ T ≤ 303 K [50–52].
Pupal mortality. The intrinsic mortality of a
pupa has been considered as mp = 0.01 +

daily mortality in the pupal stage, there is an additional mortality contribution associated to the
emergence of the adults. We considered a mortality
of 17% of the pupae at this event, which is added to
the mortality rate of pupae. Hence, the emergence
factor is ef = 0.83 [53].

The evolution of the subpopulations is modeled by

Fecundity and oviposition coefficient

Females lay a number of eggs that is roughly
proportional to their body weight (46.5 eggs/mg)
[55, 56]. Considering that the mean weight of a
three-day-old female is 1.35 mg [2], we estimated
the average number of eggs laid in one oviposition
as egn = 63.
