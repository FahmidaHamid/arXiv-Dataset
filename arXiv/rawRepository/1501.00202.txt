Introduction

A comb is a simplified model for various types of natural phenomena which belong to the
loopless graphs category. The comb consists of a backbone along the horizontal axis and
fingers or teeth along the perpendicular direction (see Figure 1.1 for a two sided comb).
Comb like models have been applied to mimic ramified structures as spiny dendrites
of neuron cells [MI13, IM13] or percolation clusters with dangling bonds [WH86]. We are
interested in the first example, where a comb structure with one sided teeth of infinite
length can be used to describe the movement and binding dynamics of particles inside the
spines of dendrites. These spines are small protrusions from many types of neurons located
on the surface of a neuronal dendrite. They receive most of the excitatory inputs and their
physiological role is still unclear although most spines are thought to be key elements in
neuronal information processing and plasticity [Yus10]. Spines are composed of a head (∼ 1
µm) and a thin neck (∼ 0.1 µm) attached to the surface of dendrite (see Fig. 1.2).

The heads of spines have an active membrane, and as a consequence, they can sustain
the propagation of an action potential with a rate that depends on the spatial density of
spines [EB09]. Decreased spine density can result in cognitive disorders, such as autism,
mental retardation and fragile X syndrome [NSS02]. Diffusion over branched smooth dendritic trees is basically determined by classical diffusion and the mean square displacement
(MSD) along the dendritic axis grows linearly with time. However, inert particles diffusing along dendrites enter spines and remain there, trapped inside the spine head and then
escape through a narrow neck to continue their diffusion along the dendritic axis. Recent experiments together with numerical simulations have shown that the transport of
inert particles along spiny dendrites of Purkinje and Pyramidal cells is anomalous with an
anomalous exponent that depends on the density of spines [SWDA06, SWDA11, DH11].
Based on these results, a fractional Nernst-Planck equation and fractional cable equation
have been proposed for electrodiffusion of ions in spiny dendrites [HLW08]. Whereas many
studies have been focused to the coupling between spines and dendrites, they are either
phenomenological cable theories [HLW08, CB03b] or microscopic models for a single spine
and parent dendrite [BS05, SMS01]. More recently a mesoscopic non-Markovian model for
spines-dendrite interaction and an extension including reactions in spines and variable residence time have been developed [FM08, MFH10]. These models predict anomalous diffusion
along the dendrite in agreement with the experiments but are not able to relate how the
anomalous exponent depends on the density of spines [SWDA11, DH11]. Since these experiments have been performed with inert particles (i.e., there are not reaction inside spines
or dendrites) one concludes that the observed anomalous diffusion is due exclusively to
the geometric structure of the spiny dendrite. Recent studies on the transport of particles
inside spiny dendrites indicate the strong relation between the geometrical structure and
anomalous transport exponents [SWDA11, BBZ09, BWK11]. Therefore, elaboration such
an analytic model that establishes this relation can be helpful for further understanding
transport properties in spiny dendrites. The real distribution of spines along the dendrite,
their size and shapes are completely random [NSS02], and inside spines the spine necks
act as a transport barrier [BS05]. For these reasons one may reasonably assume that the
diffusion inside spine is anomalous. In this chapter, we describe some models, based on
comb-like structure that mimic a spiny dendrite; where the backbone is the dendrite and
the teeth (lateral branches) are the spines. The models predict: i) anomalous transport
inside spiny dendrites, in agreement with the experimental results of Ref. [SWDA06], ii)
also explain the dependence between the mean square displacement and the density of
spines observed in [SWDA11] and iii) the mechanism of translocation wave of CaMKII

(Ca2+ - calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a key regulator of the synaptic function).
The chapter is organized as follows. First we study the statistical properties of combs and
explain how to reduce the effect of teeth on the movement along the backbone as a waiting time distribution between consecutive jumps. Second, we justify an employment of a
comb-like structure as a paradigm for further exploration of a spiny dendrite. In particular,
we show how a comb-like structure can sustain the phenomenon of the anomalous diffusion, reaction-diffusion and Lévy walks. Finally, we illustrate how the same models can be
also useful to deal with the mechanism of ta translocation wave / translocation waves of
CaMKII and its propagation failure. We also present a brief introduction to the fractional
integro-differentiation in appendix at the end of the chapter.

1.2

Random walks in combs

The statistical properties of comb-like structures have been widely studied in the last century. The first passage-time and the survival probability were studied by some authors
[WH86, Red01]. More recently the interest has been centered in the waiting time distribution
equivalent to perform a random walk along the teeth [VdB89, CM05, DBMZ07, MFH10],
the mean encounter time between two random walkers [ABC14] and the occupation time
statistics [RB13]. In this section we illustrate two methods to compute the waiting time
distribution that mimics the effect of a random walk along a teeth.
We first consider the case of a discrete 1D chain where the nearest neighbors are separated by a distance a. A random walk, where each walker moves only to one of its nearest
neighbors with equal probability after a fixed waiting time τ , is characterized by the following probability distribution functions (pdf)s for the waiting times and jump lengths,
respectively,
φ(t)

=

w(x)

=

δ(t − τ ),
1
[δ(x − a) + δ(x + a)] .

(1.1)

In this way, systems with discrete time and space can be analyzed in terms of the
Continuous-Time-Random -Walk (CTRW). Next, we add to every site of the backbone a
secondary branch of length l, to produce a one sided comb-like structure (see Fig. 1.3).
On such a structure, a walker that is at a given site of the backbone, can spend a certain
amount of time in the secondary branch before jumping to one of the nearest neighbor sites
on the backbone. If we are only interested in the behavior of the system in the direction of
the backbone, then the secondary branches introduce a delay time for jumps between the
neighboring sites on the backbone. The random walk on the comb structure can be modelled
as a CTRW with (1.1) and a renormalized waiting pdf φ(t) that includes the effect of the
delay due the motion along teeth.
To determine analytically the effect of the teeth, we invoke convolution rules that were
introduced in [VdB89] for the case of homogeneous lattices:
(i) Consider a walker that is initially at a certain site within a tooth. If the walker
proceeds further into a tooth, i.e., moves away from the backbone, its probability to return
to the initial site after a time t is a convolution of factors, i.e., a product in the Laplace
space.
(ii) The total probability for that walker to return to the initial site is determined by
summing over all t from 0 to ∞.
(iii) When the walker reaches a crossing, where it can choose between different directions,
the total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each possible direction.

symbols A, A′ , A′′ ... denote sites on the lattice (see text).

The teeth have no other additional crossings. It is as shown in Fig. 1.3. For the sake
of generality, we consider the case that when the walker is at a site on the backbone, it
can jump to another site on the backbone with probability α, or move onto the secondary
branch with probability 1 − α.
Without loss of generality, we assume that initially the walker is located on the backbone,
and we apply the rules (i) – (iii) to determine φ(t). We study three specific cases.
(a) Comb structure with l = a. In this case there is only one site on the tooth, A′ . The
walker can only jump in the direction of the backbone with probability α or move onto the
branch with probability 1 − α and then return to the initial site at the next jump. The time
it takes to reach one of the nearest neighbors on the backbone is t = τ with probability α,
t = 3τ with probability (1 − α) × 1 × α, t = 5τ with probability (1 − α)2 × 12 × α, and so
on. We can write intuitively the general form φ(t) as
φ(t) =

∞
X
j=1

α(1 − α)j−1 δ [t − (2j − 1) τ ] .

(1.2)

The rules listed above for φ(t) should reproduce this behavior. For this purpose we need
to work in the Laplace space. Let φ̂(s) be the Laplace transform of φ(t). The rules (i) – (iii)
lead to the expression
∞ h
ij
X
αφ̂0
,
(1.3)
φ̂(s) = αφ̂0
(1 − α)φ̂20 =
1 − (1 − α)φ̂20
j=0
where φ̂0 is the probability distribution for a single jump, φ̂0 = e−τ s , which is the Laplace
transform of (1.1).
Equation (1.3) is derived as follows. The term (1 − α)φ̂20 in the sum represents, according
to rule (i), the probability function for each occurrence of the walker moving onto the
secondary branch. This expression must be summed up to infinity, according rule (ii), to
take into account that the walker can move onto the tooth 1, 2, ..., ∞ times. The factor αφ̂0
accounts for the final jump to the nearest neighbor on the backbone.
It is easy to see that the expression (1.3) may be written as a Taylor series,
φ̂(s) =

∞
X
j=1

 2j−1
,
α(1 − α)j−1 φ̂0

(1.4)

which is the Laplace transform of (1.2). The method for determining φ̂(s) is shown to be
valid in this case.

(b) Comb structure with l = 2a. The secondary branch is two-sites long, A′ and A′′ .
Similarly to the previous case we can write the distribution for the time probabilities as

In this equation a new sum over the index k appears, because the walker can move away
from the backbone twice. For each such occurrence we must apply rule (i). We also assume
that jumps to the nearest neighbor occur with probability 1/2 on the linear teeth.
(c) Comb structure with l → ∞. Each time the walker moves away from the backbone, a
new convolution factor appears in φ̂(s). For the case l → ∞, we have in principle infinitely
many convolution factors in the expression for φ̂(s). Fortunately, we can simplify this situation considerably. Assume that the walker is at the first site on the secondary branch, point
A′ in Fig. 1.3, and moves away from the backbone. Let ηA′ be the probability distribution
of returning for the first time to the point A′ after a time t. Now suppose the same situation
but for the initial point A′′ . It is easy to see that as l → ∞ the limit ηA′′ → ηA′ has to
hold, and we can again use the rules (i) – (iii) to determine ηA′ . Doing so, we obtain the
expression
j

ηA = φ̂0

This expression is equivalent to the form (1.3) with α = 1/2; on the secondary branch
every jump to a nearest neighbor occurs with probability 1/2. Introducing the condition
ηA′′ = ηA′ , which is strictly correct for l = ∞, and solving (1.6), we find
q
1 − 1 − φ̂20
ηA′ =

In finding the waiting time pdf associated with the comb structures, it is assumed that
we are only interested in the dynamical behavior along the backbone and the rest of the
structure is considered as secondary.
The second method consists in finding the master equation for the random walk moving
along the backbone. This master equation has to have incorporated the movement along
the teeth. Consider first the simplest case of a one sided comb with a single node as shown
in Figure 1.4
Let α be the probability of moving along the backbone, when the walker is at a node of
the backbone and 1 − α is the probability of jumping to the teeth, if the walker is at the
backbone. So, if the movement along the backbone is considered isotropic, the probability
of jumping to the right or to the left is α/2. The master equation for the probability of
finding a walker located at the node i of the backbone at time t is (see Figure 1.4)
α

P (i, t) = P (i + a, t − τ ) + P (i − a, t − τ ) + P (1, t − τ ) ,

where we have taken into account that the walker waits a constant time τ at every node
between consecutive jumps. The master equation for the node 1 of the tooth reads
P (1, t) = (1 − α)P (i, t − τ )

where b = z τ . Inserting (1.12) into (1.11) and rearranging terms we get the following master
equation for the movement along the backbone

It is convenient to stress that (1.13) is actually the master equation for a walker moving
on a comblike constructed by repeating the element depicted in Figure 1.4. Finally, we can
write Eq. (1.13) in the Laplace space for time by taking into account that z = e−s , so that
b = e−sτ . Hence, (1.13) becomes

backbone. So that, the teeth have to have an infinite length to predict anomalous diffusion
along the whole comb at the asymptotically large times.

Draw of a smooth dendrite and a spiny dendrites

Comb-like models mimic spiny dendrites

As shown in previous studies, the geometric nature of spiny dendrites plays essential role
in kinetics [SWDA06, SWDA11, DH11, BKH07, BBZ09, BWK11]. The real distribution of
spines along the dendrite, their size and shapes are completely random [NSS02], and inside
spines, not only the spine necks but the spine itself acts as a transport barrier [SWDA11,
BWK11, BS05]. Therefore a reasonable assumption is a consideration of anomalous diffusion
along both the spines and dendrite. So, we propose models based on a comb-like structure
that mimics a spiny dendrite, where the backbone is the dendrite and teeth (lateral branches)
are the spines, see Fig. 1.6 (We distinguish between a smooth and a spiny dendrite). In this
case dynamics inside teeth corresponds to spines, while the backbone describes diffusion
along dendrites. Note that the comb model is an analogue of a 1D medium where fractional
diffusion has been observed and explained in the framework of the CTRW [WH86, AB91,
MK00, LZ98] and making use of macroscopic descriptions [ZPRC08] .
Before embarking for the CTRW consideration in the framework of the comb model, let
us explain how anomalous diffusion in the comb model relates to the CaMKII transport
along the spiny dendrite, and how geometry of the latter relates to the anomalous transport.
As admitted above, the spine cavities behave as traps for the contaminant transport. As
follows from a general consideration of a Markov process inside a finite region, the pdf of
lifetimes inside the cavity with a finite volume and arbitrary form decays exponentially
with time t (see, for example, [Red01]) ϕ(t) = τ1 exp(− τt ). Here τ is a survival time (mean
life time), defined by the minimum eigenvalue of the Laplace operator and determined by
geometry of the cavity. For example, in Refs. [BBZ09, BWK11], for spines with a head of
volume V and the cylindrical spine neck of the length L and radius a, the mean life time is
τ = LV /πa2 D = L2 /D, where D is diffusivity of the spine. Therefore, the mean probability
to find a particle inside the spine after time t, (i.e, the survival probability inside the cavity
from 0 to t) averaged over all possible realizations of τ is given by the integral
Z ∞Z ∞
Ψ(t) =
ϕ(t′ /τ )f (τ )dτ dt′
(1.31)

where f (τ ) is a distribution function of the survival times τ (recall that size and shape of
spines are random [NSS02]). Finally, the waiting time pdf can be easily calculated from Eq.
(1.31), as follows
Z
φ(t) = −∂t Ψ(t) =

∞

ϕ(t/τ )f (τ )dτ.

(1.32)

In the simplest case, when the distribution is the exponential f (τ ) = (1/τ0 ) exp(−τ /τ0 ),

1-10
one obtains from Eq. (1.32) that the general kinetics is not Markovian and the waiting time
pdf is a stretched exponential for large times

The situation is more interesting, when the distribution of the survival times is the power
law f (τ ) ∼ 1/τ 1+α , (0 < α < 1). In this case the waiting time pdf is the power law as
well φ(t) ∼ 1/t1+α that leads to subdiffusion motion along the dendrite. This result follows
from the CTRW theory, since all underlying micro-processes are independent Markovian
ones with the same distributions [MK00].
Now we explain the physical reason of the possible power law distribution φ(t). At this
point we paraphrase some arguments from Ref. [bAH05] with the corresponding adaptation
to the present analysis. Let us consider the escape from a spine cavity from a potential
point of view, where geometrical parameters of the cavity can be related to a potential U .
For example, for the simplest case, mentioned above, it is U = V L/πa2 , which “keeps”
a particle inside the cavity, while Dτ0 plays a role of the kinetic energy, or the “Boltzmann temperature”. Therefore, escape probability from the spine cavity/well is described
by the Boltzmann factor exp(−U/Dτ0 ). This value is proportional to the inverse waiting,
or survival time

(1.33)
t ∼ exp

As admitted above, potential U is random and distributed by the Poisson distribution
P (U ) = U0−1 exp(−U/U0 ), where U0 is an averaged geometrical spine characteristic. The
probability to find the waiting time in the interval (t, t + dt) is equal to the probability to
find the trapping potential in the interval (U, U + dU ), namely φ(t)dt = P (U )dU . Therefore,
from Eq. (1.33) one obtains

dendrites in the framework of the CTRW consideration.

1.3.1

Anomalous diffusion in spines

Geometry of the comb structure makes it possible to describe anomalous diffusion in spiny
dendrites structure in the framework of the comb model.
Usually, anomalous diffusion on the comb is described by the 2D distribution function
P = P (x, y, t), and a special behavior is that the displacement in the x–direction is possible
only along the structure backbone (x-axis at y = 0). Therefore, diffusion in the x-direction is
highly inhomogeneous. Namely, the diffusion coefficient is Dxx = Dx δ(y), while the diffusion
coefficient in the y–direction (along teeth) is a constant Dyy = Dy . Due to this geometrical
construction, the flux of particles along the dendrite is
Jx = −Dx δ(y)

∂P
∂x

(1.35)

and the flux along the finger describes the anomalous trapping process that occurs inside
the spine

The Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative in Eq. (1.40) is not convenient for the Laplace
transform. To ensure feasibility of the Laplace transform, which is a strong machinery for
treating fractional equations, one reformulates the problem in a form suitable for the Laplace
transform application.
To shed light on this situation, let us consider a comb in the 3D [bAH05]. This model
is described by the distribution function P1 (x, y, z, t) with evolution equation given by the

A relation between P (x, y, t) and P1 (x, y, z = 0, t) can be expressed through their Laplace

P̂1 (x, y, z = 0, s) =
P̂ (x, y, s) ,
(1.43)
2
where P̂ (x, y, s) = L̂[P (x, y, t)] and P̂1 (x, y, z, s) = L̂[P1 (x, y, z, t)].
Equation (1.43) establishes a relationship between the distributions P1 (x, y, z = 0, t)
and P (x, y, t) in the Laplace space. Both distributions are related through the expression
Z ∞
P (x, y, t) =
P1 (x, y, z, t) dz .
−∞

If we transform the above equation by Fourier-Laplace we get
P̂ (kx , ky , s) = P̂1 (kx , ky , kz = 0, s) .

(1.44)

1-12
Then, Eq. (1.43) is nothing but a relation between P̂1 (kx , ky , kz = 0, s) and P̂1 (kx , ky , z = 0, s).
To find P̂1 (kx , ky , kz , s) we transform Eq. (1.41) by Fourier-Laplace and after collecting
terms we find
P̂1 (kx , ky , kz , s) =

1 − Dx kx2 P1 (kx , y = 0, z = 0, s) − Dy ky2 P1 (kx , ky , z = 0, s)

s + kz2

(1.45)

where the initial condition has been assumed P1 (x, y, z, t = 0) = δ (x) δ (y) δ (z) for simplicity. Setting kz = 0 one gets
1 − Dx kx2 P1 (kx , y = 0, z = 0, s) − Dy ky2 P1 (kx , ky , z = 0, s)
.
s
(1.46)
Inverting Eq. (1.45) by Fourier over kz we obtain
P̂1 (kx , ky , kz = 0, s) =

P̂1 (kx , ky , z, s) =

Then setting z = 0, one obtains

Combining Eqs. (1.46) and (1.47), one has
P̂1 (kx , ky , z = 0, s) =

then the Fourier inversion over kx and ky yields Eq. (1.43). Finally, performing the Laplace

Equation (1.58) predicts subdiffusion along the spiny dendrite that is in agreement with

in dendrites, or backbone with the transport exponent less than in usual comb, since these
two processes are strongly correlated. But this correlation is broken due to the fractional
integration It1−γ in Eq. (1.51). On the other hand, if we invert (1.56) by Fourier-Laplace we

that is φ(t) ∼ t−2+ 2 as t → ∞. Let us employ the notation for a dynamical exponent dw
used in [SWDA06, SWDA11]. If dw = 4/(2 − γ) then the MSD grows as t2/dw . On the other
hand, it has been found in experiments that dw increases with the density of spines ρs and
the simulations prove that dw grows linearly with ρs . Indeed, the experimental data admits
almost any growing dependence of dw with ρs due to the high variance of the data (see Fig
5.D in [SWDA11]). Equation (1.58) also establishes a phenomenological relation between
the second moment and ρs . When the density spines is zero then γ = 0, dw = 2 and normal
diffusion takes place. If the spine density ρs increases, the anomalous exponent of the pdf
(1.60) 1 − γ/2 = 2/dw must decrease (i.e., the transport is more subdiffusive due to the
increase of ρs ) so that dw has to increase as well. So, our model predicts qualitatively that
dw increases with ρs , in agreement with the experimental results in [SWDA11].

1.3.2

Lévy walks on fractal comb

In this section we consider a fractal comb model [Iom11] to take into account the inhomogeneity of the spines distribution. Here, we consider the comb model for a phenomenological
explanation of an experimental situation, where we introduce a control parameter which
establishes a relation between diffusion along dendrites and the density of spines. Suggesting
a more sophisticated relation between the dynamical exponent and the spine density, we
can reasonably suppose that the fractal dimension, due to the box counting of the spine
necks, is not integer: it is embedded in the 1D space, thus the spine fractal dimension is
ν ∈ (0, 1). According the fractal geometry (roughly speaking), the most convenient parameter is the fractal dimension of the spine volume (mass) µspine (x) ≡ µ(x) ∼ |x|ν . Therefore,
following Nigmatulin’s idea on a construction of a “memory kernel” on a Cantor set in the
Fourier space |k|1−ν [Nig92] (and further developing in Refs. [LMNN, RLWQ03, BI11]), this
leads to a convolution integral between the non-local density of spines and the probability distribution function P (x, y, t) that can
 be expressed by means of the inverse Fourier
transform [Iom11] F̂x−1 |kx |1−ν P (kx , y, t) . Therefore, the starting mathematical point of
the phenomenological consideration is the fractal comb model

where β = 3/2 + ν/2.
Contrary to the previous analysis expression (1.57) does not work any more, since superlinear motion is involved in the fractional kinetics. This leads to divergence of the second
moment due to the Lévy flights. The latter are described by the distribution ∼ 1/|x|1+β ,
which is separated from the waiting time probability distribution φ(t). To overcome this deficiency, we follow the analysis of the Lévy walks suggested in [ZKB90, ZK95]. We consider

Comb models for transport along spiny dendrites

1-15

our exact result in Eq. (1.62) as an approximation obtained from the joint distribution of
the waiting times and the Lévy walks. Therefore, a cutoff of the Lévy flights is expected
at |x| = t. This means that a particle moves at a constant velocity inside dendrites not all
times, and this laminar motion is interrupted by localization inside spines distributed in
space by the power law.
Performing the inverse Laplace transform, we obtain solution in the form of the MittagLeffler function [BH55]

Fractional reaction-diffusion along spiny dendrites

Geometrically, spiny dendrites in the 3D space are completely described by a comb structure
in the 2D, where the spine density on the cylinder surface is projected on the 1D axis (say
the x axis): ρ(x, r = const, θ) → ρ(x). Here ρ(x, r = const, θ) is the spine density, while
ρ(x) is the density of the comb teeth. In what follows, we consider ρ(x) = g = const, which
is, probably, the most realistic case. Fractional diffusion inside the spines is described by
fractional diffusion inside the teeth. Therefore, one considers a two-sided comb model as in
Figure 1.1, and the starting mathematical point of the phenomenological consideration is
the Fokker-Planck equation obtained in [MI13].
It reads,
∂P
∂2P
∂2P
(1.68)

This equation is obtained by the re-scaling with relevant combinations of the comb parameters Dx and Dy , such that the dimensionless time and coordinates are Dx3 t/Dy2 → t
√
Dx /Dy → x, Dx /Dy → y/ g, correspondingly [IB05], and parameter g can be considered
as a constant density of the fingers.

1-16
As admitted above a variety of interactions inside spines leads to correlated noises in
dendritic spines [ZH10]. The strong correlations of that leads to anomalous (subdiffusive)
motion inside the spines. Following a phenomenological description by the CTRW, this
subdiffusion is controlled by a waiting-time pdf φ(t) decaying according to the power law.
Therefore, normal diffusion of the contaminant density P (x, y, t), for example activated
CaMKII, in spines is replaced by the anomalous transition term

K̂(s) = s1−γ .
One may recognize that Eq. (1.69) is a formal expression for the anomalous transport
with very complicated form in the time domain, which in turn, is very inconvenient for the
analytical treatment. Therefore, the comb model may be presented in the Laplace domain.
Substituting Eq. (1.69) in Eq. (1.68), then performing the Laplace transform and taking
into account Eq. (1.27), one obtains the comb model in the Laplace domain

CP (x, y, t)[1 − P (x, y, t)] [Bre13]. Integration with the power law kernel t−γ ensures anomalous diffusion in both the dendrite and spines.
In what follows we use convenient notations of fractional integro-differentiation given

Front propagation in combs

Recently, a mechanism of translocation wave of CaMKII has been suggested [EB10]. As
shown, activated CaMKII contaminant travels along dendrites with additional translocation
inside spines. Process of activation (the conversion of primed CaMKII to its active state)
corresponds to the irreversible reaction that, in absence of spines, is described by the FisherKolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (FKPP) equation (It relates also to the logistic kinetic
term) [EB10]. Therefore, in the framework of the suggested above scheme of the dispersive
subdiffusive comb (1.73), nonlinear reaction at subdiffusion in dendrites takes place along
the x-axis bound, while subdiffusion in fingers describes the translocation inside spines.
Therefore, reaction-transport equation (1.73) now reads

Note that a specific property of these transformations is an irreversibility with respect to
the Laplace transform, since, as well known, the Laplace transform of the Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivative involves the (quasi) initial value terms like P1 (t = 0) = δ(x) [MK00].
To evaluate the overall velocity of the asymptotic front, let us introduce a small parameter, say ε, at the derivatives with respect to the time and space
 [Fre96]. To this end we
re-scale x → x/ε and t → t/ε, and P1 (x, t) → P1ε (x, t) = P1 xε , εt . Therefore, one looks for
the asymptotic solution in a form of the Green approximation,

Theh main strategy
of implication of this construction is the limit ε → 0, one has

Gε (x,t)
= 0, except the condition when Gε (x, t) = 0. This equation determines

the position of the reaction spreading front, see Eq. (1.74). Moreover, we consider the limit
G(x, t) = limε→0 Gε (x, t) as the principal Hamiltonian function [Fre96] that makes it possible to apply the Hamiltonian approach for calculation of the propagation front velocity.
In this case partial derivatives of G(x, t) with respect to time and coordinate have physical
senses of the Hamiltonian and momentum:

and

(1.85)

Now the method of the hyperbolic scaling, explained above, can be applied. Therefore,
we have the ansatz (1.84) for the probability distribution function inside dendrites. Inserting
expression (1.84) in Eq. (1.82), one considers fractional integrations in time. Let us start
from the last term in Eq. (1.82), which is the reaction term. We rewrite it in the following

It should be admitted the absence of the failure of the activation front propagation. It
has a simple explanation due to the absence of a reaction “sink” term −hP in Eq. (1.75)
by neglecting the possibility of spines to accumulate a large amount of Ca2+ [KS06, Seg05],
where h is a translocation/accumulation rate [EB10]. Introducing this term in Eq. (1.75),
our anticipation is that the hyperbolic scaling for this new equation yields a solution similar
to Eq. (1.91) with H = 0 that corresponds to the failure of the front propagation. Moreover,
this asymptotic solution for P1 (x, t) always takes place, as one of possible solutions.

For C > 2hg 2 there is no failure and the front asymptotically propagates with a constant

reaction rate necessary to sustain propagation along the spiny dendrite due to the presence
of translocation. Analogously, (C/2h)2/3 can also be viewed as the minimum value for the
density of spines necessary to have propagation failure. Both results are in agreement with
the results obtained from very different models based on the cable model [CB03a].
γ
In general case, one compares the interplay between the activation CH 2 and the translo3
cation −2hg 2 H 1−γ terms in Eq. (1.96) in the limit H → 0. For γ ∈ [ 23 , 1), the translocation
term is dominant and leads to the solution with H = 0 and the failure of the front propagation, correspondingly. When 0 < γ < 23 , the activation in dendrites can be dominant. This
situation is more complicated, and the activation-translocation front can propagate with an
asymptotically finite velocity.
Finally, let us consider the linear counterpart of Eq. (1.75) with the linear reaction term
Ĉ(P ) = CP . This analysis will be useful to uncover the behavior of the tail of the total
distribution and check if the front accelerates or travel with constant velocity. Rewrite the
equation for the total distribution P1 (x, t). As follows from the fractional differentiation of

Conclusion

In this chapter we show that a comb is a convenient model for analytical exploration of
anomalous transport and front propagation phenomena along spiny dendrites. We have
studied the properties of a random walk motion along the backbone in presence of teeth.
Teeth are lateral branches crossing the backbone and we have shown here that their effect
on the movement along the whole structure can be reduced to a waiting time distribution at
the nodes of the backbone during the movement of the random walker. Recent experiments
and numerical simulations have predicted anomalous diffusion along spiny dendrites.
We have shown here that this anomalous phenomenon can be explained in the framework
of a comb model with infinitely long teeth. Moreover, due to the random distribution of
spines along the parent dendrite and the presence of binding reaction inside spines one can
present a physically reasonable justification of the power law of the waiting time distribution
that leads to subdiffusion in both the teeth and the backbone.
We have shown how to predict anomalous diffusion in spines by constructing a fractionaldiffusion equation. By using the CTRW formalism we have computed the mean square displacement for the transport along the whole comb. We presented an illustration of how
to take into account the inhomogeneous distribution of spines along the dendrite by using
a fractal comb. We have also constructed the corresponding fractional-diffusion equations
and computed the mean square displacement. From the other hand, the constructed toy
models are simple enough, like the comb model that makes it possible to suggest and understand a variety of reaction-transport schemes, including anomalous transport, by applying
a strong machinery of fractional calculus and hyperbolic scaling for asymptotic methods.
This approach allows to suggest an analytical description of reaction-transport scenarios
in spiny dendrites, where we consider both a linear reaction in spines, see Eqs. (1.72) and
(1.73), and nonlinear reaction along dendrites, considered in the framework of the FKPP
scheme [Fis37]. To this end we suggest a fractional subdiffusive comb model, where we
apply a Hamilton-Jacobi approach to estimate the overall velocity of the reaction front
propagation. We proposed an alternative approach of a recently suggested mechanism of
translocation wave of CaMKII [EB10], where activated CaMKII contaminant travels along
dendrites with additional translocation inside spines, and process of activation corresponds
to the irreversible reaction described by the FKPP equation (1.82). One of the main effect,
observed in the framework of the considered model, is the failure of the front propagation
due to either the reaction inside spines, or interaction of reaction with spines. In the first
case the spines are the source of reactions, while in the latter case the spines are a source
of damping, for example they act as a sink of an activated contaminant (CaMKII). The
situation is controlled by three parameters CaMKII activation C, CaMKII translocation
rate h and the fractional transport exponent γ. The latter reflects the geometrical structure
of the transport system: when 0 < γ < 32 , the activation in dendrites can be dominant,
and the activation-translocation front can propagate with an asymptotically nonzero and
constant velocity. For γ = 2/3 we have found a criteria for the emergence of propagation
failure or for the sustain of the propagation in terms of the reaction rate, the translocation
rate and the spine’s density.
It should be admitted, in conclusion, that physical arguments suggested above, explain
why anomalous transport, namely subdiffusion, of either CaMKII or neutral particles is
possible and support implementation of the comb model. These arguments are based on

1-22
geometry of dendritic spines that determines an expression for the transport exponent in
Eq. (1.34). This situation becomes more sophisticated in a case of the nonlinear FKPP reaction. Indeed, as shown, the power law kernel of the transition probability considered due
to the geometry arguments is insensitive to the nonlinear reaction. This consideration differs completely from a mesoscopic non-Markovian approach, developed in [FM08, MFH10],
where spines-dendrite interaction and an extension including reactions in spines have been
described in framework of variable residence time. This leads to essential complication of
the transition probability due to the nonlinear reaction term [Fed10, MFH10].

Appendix: Fractional integro–differentiation

The consideration of a non-Markovian process in the framework of kinetic equations leads
to the study of the so-called fractional Fokker-Planck equation, where both time and space
processes are not local [MK00]. In this case, derivations are substituted by integrations with
the power law kernels. One arrives at so-called fractional integro–differentiation.
A basic introduction to fractional calculus can be found, e.g., in Ref. [Pod98]. Fractional
integration of the order of α is defined by the operator
Z t

(1.102)
a It f (t) =
Γ(α) a
where Γ(α) is a gamma function. There is no constraint on the limit a. In our consideration,
a = 0 since this is a natural limit for the time. A fractional derivative is defined as an inverse

Eq. (1.105) is the fractional derivative in the Caputo form [Mai96]. Performing integration
