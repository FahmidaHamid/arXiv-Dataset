Abstract
The objective of this research was to identify factors affecting tree
damage in the historical Minot flood of 2011. We hypothesized that
tree height, identity, origin, and maximum water height affect in the
severity of damage sustained by a tree in a flood event. All these factors
were significant but highly interactive. The results from this research
can influence planting practices in valleys and other flood prone areas
to mitigate future damage.

Introduction

Various effects of flooding can drastically alter an ecosystem. Some of the
factors that could potentially harm trees include alteration of soil factors,
disturbance of plant life, and degeneration of habitat. During a flood, soil is
altered by erosion, deoxygenation, and reconfiguration (Kozlowski 1997; Lake
2011). Erosion is caused by the continuous circular and turbulent motion of
the water. This motion carries particles of the soil away, resulting in a loss
of topsoil, loss of nutrients, and an exposure of plant roots; all three of these
factors severely harm plants (Shafroth et al. 2000). The topsoil is reconfigured with the finer particles that were carried with the flood, such as sand
and silt, which may to compact into finer arrangements. This compacted soil
1

restricts the ability to hold gases such as oxygen, causing deoxygenation of
the soil (Parrett 1964).
Flooding disturbs not only the abiotic factors of the environment, but
also the biotic factors. Plants suffocate and decompose due to the flood
waters (Parolin & Wittmann 2010). This can result in stunting, damaging,
or even killing of trees (Joly & Crawford 1982). The warm, stagnant water is
a suitable habitat for several bacteria and fungi. This can cause tree rot as
the bacteria and fungi in the water inhibit the trees’ natural ability to carry
nutrients and water (Coder 1994). Because the part of a tree is submerged,
the tree is likely to undergo suffocation if it is submerged for a long period of
time. The suffocation of trees is caused by the lack of oxygen in the stagnant
flood waters. If there is a faster flowing current, the water can also damage
a tree’s structure by breaking off branches or uprooting it altogether.
Considering both abiotic and biotic factors, flooding substantially distorts
the original environment. Damage to native plant life during the flood and
the change in soil configuration after the flood may provide a more suitable
environment for foreign species (Yanosky 1982). Since the postdiluvian soil
determines the species of plants present, a flood can restructure an ecosystem
(Bratkovich 1993).
Minot, North Dakota, is positioned in the Souris River Valley. The
Souris River originates in Canada, flows south into the United States at
North Dakota, passes through Minot, and then turns north again to re-enter
Canada. Flooding of varying severity is common along the Souris River.
Despite numerous previous floods, none were as large as the flood of 2011.
Record water levels from the 1969 flood were surpassed as water rose to 457.8
m above sea level. This record flood event submerged houses and crested
bridges. Warm, stagnant, and hypoxic waters from summer rains covered
the valley for approximately 23 days in June and July (“Timeline...”). The
river banks are presently wider and contain more silt than the antediluvian
banks; this was caused by erosion of the banks. The flood has also affected
the plant life present in the flood plain. Vast areas of the Minot flood plain
were drastically over-saturated during the flood, causing a degeneration of
suitable habitats for most indigenous plant species (“Timeline...”).
Studying tree species in Minot has allowed for better understanding of
the extent of damage suffered by trees during floods. By determining which
trees are best adapted to survive in flooding situations, informed decisions
can be made when planting trees in areas prone to flooding. This knowledge
will allow for the least sustained damage of habitats after future floods.
2

Here, we analyze data collected regarding the impact of a flood event on
tree damage. We hypothesize that tree height, genus, and maximum water
level are all determining factors in the severity of damage sustained by a tree
in a flood event.

Materials and Methods

We used the Minot flood plain for research. We sampled trees across the
Minot flood plain in September 2011 and in Oak Park in July 2014 with
tools such as clinometers, logger’s tape, and a GPS device. For each tree
we recorded height, water level, identity, and damage. Damage was visually
accessed on a scale of 0 to 5: 0 = no damage, 1 ≤ 25% of the tree was
damaged, 2 = 25–50% of the tree was damaged, 3 = 50–75% of the tree was
damaged, 4 = 75–90% of the tree was damaged, and 5 = 100% of the tree
was damaged.
We measured tree heights with a clinometer and recorded to nearest meter. Maximum water level was measured using the still visible line of water
on objects surrounding the tree, such as houses or fences. We identified
(Herman & Chaput 2003) to the level of genera and measured 288 trees.
The second part of the research explored the relationship between the
maximum water level and tree damage. We made a virtual transect along
the 8th Street (which comes almost perpendicular from the river to the undamaged part of city) and use apple trees (Pyrus) as a standard indicator of
damage. We recorded the damage and distance from the river in meters of
Pyrus trees along this route.
In the Oak Park section, the exact GPS coordinates of trees were also
recorded. This measurement will allow for accurate and consistent reevaluation over time. The damage rating has been recorded annually.
We used the R statistical environment (R Core Team 2014) for all calculations and plots. Data categories were analyzed in various combinations in
order to thoroughly evaluate relationships (Dalgaard, 2008). We analyzed the
relationship between height and genera, water level and genera, tree height
and water level, tree height and damage, water level and damage, genera and
damage, conifers and damage, angiosperms and damage, and damage and
time. Relationships between the data were all determined after inputting
the data. We analyzed the data through these various combinations in order
to fully understand the relationships between the factors.

Results

288 studied trees belonged to 12 different genera; the majority being Fraxinus
and Ulmus. Damages recorded were mostly below 3; less than 40% trees were
damaged >50%.
We measured interactions between the data recorded. Both height of tree
and maximum water level were significantly correlated with the taxonomy
(Kruskall-Wallis tests p-values  0.05 in both cases). Tree height and water
level were also weakly but significantly correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.282, p
 0.05). Consequently, on next steps of the data analysis we focused on the
interaction between factors.
The linear models of damage included two continuous (tree height and
water level) and one categorical variable (tree genus), and were different
with and without interactions. With interactions, only one term (Quercus
genus) was significant whereas the model without interactions had multiple
significant terms, namely tree height, water level, and Prunus, Pyrus and
Quercus genera (all p-values < 0.05). Prunus and Pyrus sustained damage
more than other trees (median damage 3 while the median damage for the
all data was 2), but Quercus was damaged on the median level.
Both linear models were significant (Fisher tests p-values  0.05), but
the adjusted R2 in both cases was low (0.167 and 0.111, respectively). The
second model was more optimal (AIC = 1027.387 vs. AIC = 1036.728 for
the first model with interactions). Attempts to remove any terms in order
to simplify the second model resulted in an increased AIC.
The damage was weakly but significantly negatively correlated with the
tree height (Spearman ρ = −0.285, p-value  0.05) but not with water level
(Spearman ρ = 0.022, p-value = 0.703).
Post hoc pairwise comparisons of damage level between different tree genera did not reveal any significant patterns (Nemenyi test p-values >> 0.05),
only damages to Pyrus and Populus were significantly different (Nemenyi
test p-value = 0.045).
Various contrasts were applied to our set of tree species. While native
and non-native trees were not significantly different in the level of damage
(Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.452), conifers were damaged significantly more
4

than angiosperm trees (Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.033). However, without
Juniperus (i.e., only for pine family, Pinaceae trees) this significant pattern
disappeared (Wilcoxon test p-value = 0.316). Rosaceae trees (Pyrus and
Prunus) also suffered damage more than others (Wilcoxon test p-value =
0.003) but this could have been influenced by their significantly smaller sizes
(Wilcoxon test p-value  0.05).
To understand how damage is related with water level, we used transect
data less influenced by interactions since it focused on only one genus (Pyrus)
and location. The linear model for the damage vs. maximum level of water
on the transect returned all terms significant, adjusted R2 = 0.551 and Fisher
test p-value  0.05.
While there was a decreasing trend of the tree damage in Oak Park (from
3.0 in 2011 to 2.0 two years later), this pattern was not significant (Friedman
test p-value = 0.905).

Discussion

The patterns observed suggest several conclusions. First of all, the assumption of a greater tolerance to flooding of native species than nonnative species
is not supported by the data. Others have observed a relationship between
indigenous species and damage resistance in response to locally common disasters (Zamora-Arroyo et al. 2001), but this was not supported by our flood
data. This is probably because at least some of the foreign species originated
from areas with similar flooding occurrences as the Minot flood plain.
A significant inverse relationship between tree height and damage sustained was found. While tree height contributes greatly to the amount of
damage trees sustain after a flood, the data also shows the separate relationships between the taxonomy and damage. The result that certain genera
show greater resistance to flooding than other genera is consistent with previous research (Parolin & Wittmann 2010; Kozlowski et al., 2015). Conifers
(Pinopsida) and Pyrus and Prunus (both of Rosaceae family) sustained significantly more damage than other genera. These results allow for educated
decisions in the future when planting trees inside a flood zone.
The factors measured were highly interactive in determining flood damage. Water level, tree height, and genus all had significant effects on tree
damage; the removal of any of these terms from the model decreased optimality. While it appears that a combination of all factors determines damage,
5

tree height seems to exhibit the greatest influence.
The study of damage to Oak Park trees over time is still in its early
stages. As it stands, the data suggest promising regeneration rates for most
of the trees involved. Continued research will be conducted on these trees
to gain further insight regarding tree regeneration. Drawing upon similar
research, we predict that native trees will show a greater rate of regeneration
than nonnative trees (Zamora-Arroyo et al. 2001).
