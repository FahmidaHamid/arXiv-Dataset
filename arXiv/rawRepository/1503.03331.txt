Abstract
The water uptake by roots of plants is examined for an ideal situation, with an
approximation that resembles plants growing in pots, meaning that the total
soil volume is fixed. We propose a coupled water uptake-root growth model. A
one-dimensional model for water flux and water uptake by a root system growing
uniformly distributed in the soil is presented, and the Van Genuchten model for
the transport of water in soil is used. The governing equations are represented
by a moving boundary model for which the root length, as a function of time,
is prescribed. The solution of the model is obtained by front-fixing and finite
element methods. Model predictions for water uptake by a same plant growing
in loam, silt and clay soils are obtained and compared. A sensitivity analysis to
determine relative effects on water uptake when system parameters are changed
is also presented and shows that the model and numerical method proposed
are more sensitive to the root growth rate than to the rest of the parameters.
This sensitivity decreases along time, reaching its maximum at thirty days. A
comparison of this model with a fixed boundary model with and without root
growth is also made. The results show qualitative differences from the beginning
of the simulations, and quantitative differences after ten days of simulations.

1. Introduction
In the development of a theory to describe plant water uptake, electrical
analogues of the system have been used for analysis [1, 2, 3]. The analogues
are based on the assumption that rooting patterns are uniform and constant in
each soil layer. Steady flow is presumed in both the soil and the plant over the
period of calculation. In this approach the plant water potentials are primarily
the result of an imposed value of transpiration rate and its variations. Later
papers [4, 5, 6] have presented detailed reviews on plant water uptake. In those
papers the Richards equation is used, with a sink term. Another approach is to
model the water movement and uptake over large areas, using individual plant
[7], or global behavior [8]. A microscopical approach has also been proposed [9],
where the total water uptake is calculated based on using a constant value for
the entire rooting profile. In more recent papers [10, 11, 12] the root growth has
been taken into account, still using a fixed domain. The root growth is inscribed
on a domain that is not a function of time. Some other papers about nutrient
uptake consider root growth and instantaneous coupling with the nutrient flux
by using a variable domain approximation [13]. In this last model [13] a variable
root length, and consequently, a variable available volume of soil to each root of
a root system is considered using a moving boundary model. In this model the
root system is uniformly distributed in the soil and the variation of available soil
volume per unit of root length is modeled by a moving boundary. The approach
presented here is based on that in [13] . In the proposed model plants growing
in controlled conditions, as in a growth chamber, are assumed. A constant
temperature and evapotranspiration rate is presumed. In this situation, the
water potential at the root surface is determined by the soil water potential,
and consequently determines water uptake by the growing root system. The
proposed model considers an uniform root water uptake for all the root system.
The goal of this paper is to present a simplified model of water uptake coupled
with a growing root system and analyze the influence of system parameters on
water uptake using typical values.

volume is fixed (as in pots), therefore the soil volume per unit of root length is
decreasing as in Figure 1. Based on these assumptions, and taking into account
the root length density as a function of time (t) the following moving boundary
model in cylindrical coordinates [9, 13] is proposed

(33) which contains the variation of the moving boundary. In order to solve
the model (33–36) the non-linear finite element method [16] is applied and the
resulting model is solved by using the software FlexPDE [17] with an adaptive
mesh of around 400 nodes.
3. Results
All simulations were performed by a same hypothetical plant in three types
of soils (loam, silt and clay) for the same soil-root volume (4000cm3) with the
same total water content (θi = 0.30). This initial condition is fixed using the
”field capacity” concept given by Ritchie [18]. Hydraulic soil data selected were
those for loam, silt, and clay based on [9]. The soil parameters used are shown
in Table 1. For the plant parameters different sources were used. The values
of Ψ2 and Ψ3 were taken from [19], the value of Ψ1 was chosen to assure that
wateruptake was possible at the beginning of the simulation. s0 and V are
typical values from the literature [20], and l0 was chosen to be 1 cm to simulate
a plant at the start of growth. The plant and soil volume parameters are listed
in Table 2. Table 3 shows parameters of soil and plant properties and the initial
“available water”(U0). This last parameter is approximated as
U0 = [θi − θ(Ψ3 )] × 4000cm3,

(37)

and represents how much water can be extracted from the soil before it reaches
an uniform water potential at the wilting point. Beyond this point the root
cannot extract more water.
Figures 4, 5, and 6 show the soil water potential profiles at different times,
with an initial moisture condition equivalent (θ = 0.30), for the loam, silt and
clay soil, respectively. The curves reveal that a high water potential gradient is
developed in a very small time period for the clay soil, while for the loam and silt
soil the development of the water potential gradient is more gradual. For loam
and silt soil the root dries the soil near the root surface on the first 30 days. After

that period these soils show a water potential on the root surface close to the
wilting point. The root starts to retrieve water near the moving boundary R(t).
This is shown by an increase of the modulus of the water potential (decrease of
his value) at x = 1 for the dimensionless domain, or r = R(t) for the physical
domain. The clay soil shows a similar behavior but the time period at which
the potential near root zone reaches potentials close to the wilting point is 10
days.
Figure 7 shows the relative water uptake (G(Ψ(s0 , t))/Smax ) per unit of root
length as a function of time for the three types of soil, at different root growth
rate. At the initial time the water uptake for loam and silt soil develops at the
zone of maximum uptake (zone (a) in Figure 2), while clay soil does the same
for the linear uptake zone (zone (b) in Figure 2). The figure shows that the
water uptake does not vary much for the first 20 days as a function of V for

loam soil, after that period loam soil enters on the linear regime at different
times depending on the value of V . After 40 days the gap among the curves
on the log scale remains almost constant and all the curves are in the linear
uptake regime. This means that the instantaneous root water uptake curves
have a multiplicative constant among them. Silt soil has a very similar behavior
to loam soil but the linear regime occurs at shorter times. For clay soil the
period of similar water uptake is 10 days and after that period the curves begin
a gradual separation that continues until the end of the simulation. Clay soil
also shows a very sharp initial decrease on the curve (one order of magnitude),
this is due to the linear regime and a large decrease of Ψ(s0 , t) at the beginning
of the simulation.
To compare the above simulations with those for a constant root length
density in a fixed domain model a simulation with V = 0 (R(t) = R0 ) was made.
For the comparison to be useful the root length was taken to be the average root
length (l0 = ¯
l = 389.8cm). Using this value the domain is fixed and the moving
boundary model then becomes the model proposed by Personne [9]. The influxes
on the root surface estimated by the fixed boundary model are then integrated
using (14) with the fixed root length, to compute the cumulative uptake. This
model will be referred to as Fixed Boundary Fixed Length (FBFL). Similar to
published results on nutrient uptake (e.g. Claasen and Barber [21], Cushman
[22]) the influxes obtained with the fixed boundary model can be integrated
using equation (14) with a variable root length, to compute the cumulative
uptake. This model will be referred to as Fixed Boundary Variable Length
(FBVL). Figure 8 shows the instantaneous root system water uptake against
time (i.e. G(Ψ(s0 , t)) × l(t)), for the three models. The time at which the
instantaneous water uptake is maximum is called the Maximum Uptake time
(MUT). The MUT is only present when the roots are growing. The straight line
in the beginning is caused by the assumption of linear root length growth and
the constant water uptake (G(Ψ) = Smax ), on the models with root growth. In

contrast when the root is taking up water in the water stressed (linear zone) of
the water uptake function the instantaneous water uptake as a function of time
is non linear, in all models. We also observe that in the clay soil for the models
with root growth the water uptake initially decreases given the large decrease
in soil water potential at the root surface. This variation is shown in the inset,
the later increase in water uptake is due to the root growth. The models with
growing roots have a similar course in time, but the differences between the
MUT-values are consistently showing that the MUT in the FBVL occurs earlier
after the start of root growth. The instantaneous water uptake of the FBFL
model and the FBVL models differs only by the multiplicative factor l(t)/l̄.
Figure 9 shows the cumulative water uptake as a function of time for the
three models. The cumulative water uptake at 90 days (U (90)) is close to the
amount of water initially available (U0 ) for the FBFL and the moving boundary
models (see Table 3). For the FBVL model the cumulative water uptake is lower
than that predicted by the other. This difference is due to the smaller value
of the MUT. After 90 days 20% of the initially available water in the clay soil
is remaining, whereas for the silt and loam soil it is in the order of 10%. The
clay soil does not trend to a constant value due to the less water uptake. It
is expected that over a longer period the moisture content in the clay soil will
asymptotically approach to a lower value, that might be on the proximity of the
values found on the other soils.
To analyze the effect of parameter variation on model output variables, several sensitivity diagrams were made using a local approach [23]. The results
are presented in Tables 4, 5, 6 and 7 as a function of the multiplicative factor of each parameter for the loam soil. The more relevant parameters are V
and Smax , having both positive correlation on the water uptake at 30, 60 and
90 days and negative correlation with the MUT. As for the WUMUT, Smax
has a negative correlation and V has a positive correlation. s0 has an almost
constant sensitivity and always positive correlation. Therefore the experimental measurement errors on those parameters would be more amplified on the
output of the model. For the silt soil there is a very similar pattern than for
the loam soil. For the clay soil there are some differences. Smax is no longer a
relevant parameter and s0 is a relevant parameter with positive correlation to
the accumulative water uptake. For the MUT and WUMUT s0 has a negative
correlation. The behavior of V is left unchanged with respect to the loam soil.
MUT shows almost no sensitivity to Smax but the WUMUT shows that this
parameter is very relevant with positive correlation. All the sensitivities are non
linear with some exceptions for s0 .
Mass conservation implies that the total water volume must be the same at
the beginning and at an arbitrary time of the simulation. Since the water

only be in the soil or inside the root, therefore the total water volume T cm3
at time t would be
T (t) = U (t) + W (t)
(38)
with U (t) and W (t) defined as in equations (14) and (16) respectively. At the
beginning of the simulation the cumulative water uptake is null, therefore the

total water is the water in soil. With the above considerations the change of the
cumulative water uptake plus the water remaining in the soil minus the initial
water content (W (t)+U (t)−W (0)) as a function of time was calculated. For the
FBVL model the mass balance cannot be done because to compute the water
remaining in soil, the operation must be done with pressure head profiles as a
function of time which has been calculated in fixed domain, but this result must
be compared with the cumulative uptake by a growing root, which has been
calculated integrating in a variable domain. The results of those calculations
are shown in Figure 10. It shows that there is an effect of water mass loss for the
moving boundary model that is not present on the fixed boundary model. There
are two possible causes for this mass loss. The first cause is the assumption of
total volume constant
of the model, reflected in the moving
 in the formulation
q 
l0
, i.e., the volume that is kept constant is
boundary formula R(t) = R0 l(t)

the soil plus root volume, being the volume occupied by the root is VR = πs20 l(t).
Then the soil volume is the total volume minus the root volume, therefore the
root occupies a bigger fraction of the total volume as time increases (see Figure
1). The water content in the volume of soil removed by the root is not taken
into account in the calculation of the water in the soil volume (W (t)). This
means, in other words, that, for the model, the root is “eating” the soil, and
the water which is in that portion of the soil. The second cause is the numerical
errors. This case is similar for both models and does not contribute a large mass
loss. An important remark is that the FEM is used to solve the water potential
(Ψ), not the water content (θ), on a discretized space with a finite precision,
and cumulative errors could lead to a mass creation or loss depending of the
parameters. Figure 10 shows the soil volume loss effect plus the water mass loss
due to the used numerical method in each integration step. In each soil for the
moving boundary model the water loss is around 1% of the total water. For the
clay soil the total loss is around 15% of the total water uptake, while for the
other soils the loss is less than 2%. The water loss for the fixed boundary model
is negligible compared with the total water or the cumulative water uptake.

4. Conclusions
An important remark is that all the results presented before are computed
for a single plant, in a fixed soil volume with initial soil water content equal for
all simulations, to compare the effect of the different soils on the water uptake.
The parameters used represent traits of the plant. V can be regarded as the
response to nutrient and water uptake and is influenced by the plant genetics.
Smax is linked to atmospheric factors and to genetic variation. s0 is the constant
root radius. l0 is a growing stage trait, changes in it only means a change in
the development of the rooting system when the simulation begins.
There is a large difference in behaviour among the silt and loam soil on one
hand and the clay soil on the other hand. Initial pressure head (Table 3) and
pressure head profiles are different (Figures 4, 5 and 6), and instantaneous water
uptake is much smaller (Figures 7 and 8). This can be explained in terms of
the water uptake function (G(Ψ)). For the clay soil the water uptake function
is on the linear regime (zone (b) of Figure 2) and the water potential is sharply
decreasing (drying the soil) at the root-soil interface. Once the time variation
of the water potential at the interface is stabilized the root growth has the
dominant effect on uptake and the curve is similar to the other curves, although
it shows a non linear behavior.
From Figure 10, the mass balance is not exactly zero owing to the numerical
method used. For the FBFL model the differences are due to numerical errors
only and are very low compared with the water volume loss on the moving
boundary model. The mass variation is produced on the high instantaneous
uptake zone, this is a known flaw of the finite elements method. The moving
boundary model has a higher mass variation compared with the FBFL model by
the accumulation of two factors, numerical errors as in FBFL model, and a soil
volume loss effect. The soil volume loss effect is introduced by the assumption
of constant total volume (roots grows at the expense of a decrease in the soil
volume), which is reflected on the formula of the moving boundary (12). For the
moving boundary model the differences on the total values of water mass loss by
a soil volume loss effect and numerical errors are due to the different variations
of the soil water contents. The clay soil has low available water (see Table 3),
but the total water mass loss is similar to the other soils, and it represents
about 10% of the initial total water. The assumptions that generate the soil
volume loss effect should be revised when soils for which the initial potential
is on the linear zone (i.e., low water availability) are studied. The water mass
loss is consistent with the model assumptions, and the numerical induced errors
are low compared to the water uptakes (< 15% for clay soils, and < 2% for the
other soils). There are two main actions to avoid the volume loss effect. The
first one is to keep the soil volume constant and not the root-soil volume. The
second one is to evaluate the mass loss and put it back into the soil using a
source function or a modification of the boundary conditions. Each procedure
will have its advantages and disadvantages, but, since the water loss is very low
compared with the water uptake for the studied cases, the revision is left for a
specific work on low initial available water.
19

The obtained results shows a global consistency with the structure of soils
studied, becoming a valuable tool to study the water uptake in a more complex
situation (for example when the effect of a variable evapotranspiration on Smax
is considered).
Obviously, the results would change when plants not growing in pots but in
the field (in this case equation (12) is invalid) are considered. Here is necessary to
develop a new rooting development function R(t). One change in this model to
be useful in a field situation is the use of a coordinate representing the depth and
water transport by gravity. Here R(t) should incorporate the root architecture.
Moreover, since this is a first approach a simple water uptake function has been
used. This function could be changed to a more complex function [24, 25].
Moreover the effect of V and Smax could change substantially after the first 30
days in field conditions, since there will be circadian and climatic effects that
will alters the root water uptake function (G), and the evapotranspiration will
be a parameter to be measured or calculated before the simulation.
The differences among models with and without root growth can bee seen in
figures 8 and 9. The dynamics of water uptake for the fixed boundary models
are very different from those of a moving boundary model. The maximum instantaneous water uptake is achieved much faster for the fixed boundary model.
Also a difference in the beginning and end of the simulation for the values of
the instantaneous water uptake can be observed, while for the FBFL and the
moving boundary model the instantaneous water uptake reaches values close to
zero as time goes by, is not clear that the FBVL model has the same behavior.
This difference is because the influx on root surface is computed for a single root
in a fixed domain and the cumulative uptake by the growing root is calculated
using these influxes. From a physical point of view, to compute the cumulative uptake influxes calculated in a variable domain should be used. Therefore
the mass balance cannot be calculated for the FBVL. For those considerations
of mass conservation the FBVL approach should be avoided on water uptake
models.
