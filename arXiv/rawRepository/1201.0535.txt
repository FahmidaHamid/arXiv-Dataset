Abstract
One of the more interesting themes of the mathematical ecology is the description of the mutualistic
interaction between two interacting species. Based on continuous–time model developed by Holland
and DeAngelis 2009 for consumer–resource mutualism description, this work deals with the application
of the Mickens Nonstandard Finite Difference method to transform the continuous–time scheme into a
discrete–time one. It has been proved that the Mickens scheme is dynamically consistent with the original
one regardless of the step-sizes used in numerical simulations, in opposition of the Forward–Euler method
that shows numerical instabilities when the step size overcomes a critical value.

Introduction

The mutualism is acknowledged as a fundamental process in ecological systems: it is an interaction between
individuals of different species, from which the interacting populations have beneficial effects. Like predation
and competition, is now recognized as a consumer–resource (C–R) interaction [7]. The C–R interaction
relates the process of nutrient transfer between a consumer and a resource: is a mechanism that describes the
way by which individuals interact with each other [6]. All the types of mutualism belong to one of the three
general forms of C–R interaction: uni–directional, bi–directional and indirect C–R mutualisms [5].
From a mathematical point of view only few authors have been attempts to modelize the mutualism,
probably because it is difficult to retrieve the experimental data. One of the first attempts is based on Lotka–
Volterra competition equations [10], but it conducts to the boundless growth of the interacting population.
Subsequently, other models are proposed where a stable equilibrium for populations are reached [19], [3].
Holland and DeAngelis [6] developed a general continuous–time model to describe the population dynamic
for two mutualistic species; whose model is based on a modified version of the Rosenzweig–MacArthur [18]
model of predation.
Although a continuous–time model based on differential equations constitutes the first step to modelize
a population evolution problem, for the more complexes issues investigated in mathematical biology, the
numerical method is the only practicable way. Also, discrete–time models become essential when one wants
to describe experimental data that have been collected with a certain interval of time. One of the critical
aspects of the discretization methods is just the dependence from this interval, the time step. Since the
time step should be selected only in relation to the characteristics of the problem under examination, it is
necessary to choose a reliable discretization method that allows to make this transformation without any
restriction on time step, as well as not to introduce artifacts, change the linear stability properties etc.. Since,
in general, these requirements are not satisfied from all the discretization methods (see i.e., [14]), in this paper
is presented the application of the Nonstandard Finite Difference scheme [11] to the system of differential
equations discussed by Holland and DeAngelis in the articles [5] and [7]. In this work are only considered the
equations describing the population dynamic for the bi–directional C–R mutualism since the uni–directional
problem is easily solved once the bi–directional one is solved.

Time Continuous Approach

A mathematical model for population growth can be generally described by a system of first order of
autonomous ordinary differential equations:
 dξ
 dt = f (ξ, k)
(1)

ξ(t0 ) = ξ0 ,
with f : Rn −→ Rn is supposed to be sufficiently smoothed; ξ = ξ(t) : [0, +∞) −→ Rn are the coordinates,
with initial condition ξ0 ∈ Rn ; finally k = (k1 , k2 , ...) represents the system parameters. If f is globally
Lipschitz then there exists a unique solution ξ for all t ≥ t0 , hence the eq. (1) defines a dynamical system on
Rn . For a system defined with eq. (1) we define a steady state solution (or also fixed point of f ) a point
ξ˜ ∈ Rn that satisfies the relation:
˜ = 0,
f (ξ)

(2)

˜ (ξ)
˜ = 0, ξ˜ ∈ Rn } to refer to the set of steady
In the continuation of the text will be used the set Γc = {ξ|f
states solutions.
If f ∈ C 1 it is possible to calculate the n × n Jacobian matrix as here indicated with Jf . In term of the
Jacobian matrix, as given σ(Jf ) the set of its eigenvalues, a theorem ensures that a steady–state ξ˜ ∈ Rn for
which J has no eigenvalues with zero real parts (hyperbolic steady–state) is [9]:
• asymptotically stable if and only if <λ < 0, for all λ ∈ σ(Jf ),
• unstable if and only if <λ > 0, for all λ ∈ σ(Jf ).
The same is not true for a non–hyperbolic steady–state.

Finite Difference Approaches

To transform a continuous–time model into a discrete one, the continuous variable t ∈ [0, ∞) must be
replaced by the discrete variable n ∈ N and the variable ξ must take discrete values ξn . The result is a
difference equation. Let f : Rn −→ Rn , consider a sequence {ξn }∞
n=0 : it can be defined by a mapping
Λ : Rn × Rn −→ Rn of the form H(ξn+1 , ξn ). In some case, such as the one discussed on this paper, is possible
that ξn+1 is given explicitly in terms of ξn :
ξn+1 = F (ξn ),

(3)

where F : A ⊆ Rn −→ Rn .
For a dynamical discrete system defined by eq. (3) a steady–state ξ˜n ∈ Rn respects the following
conditions:
F (ξ˜n ) = ξ˜n .

(4)

Likewise to the continuous case, also in discrete case it is useful to define with Γd = {ξ˜n |F (ξ˜n ) = 0, ξ˜n ∈ Rn }
the set of steady–states.
To check the stability of the system described by eq. (4) the procedure is similar to the continuous case.
If F ∈ C 1 is possible to calculate the n × n Jacobian matrix, indicated with JF . Given σ(JF ) the set of the
Jacobian eigenvalues, a theorem (see i.e., [4]) ensures that a steady–state ξ˜n ∈ Rn is:
• locally asymptotically stable if and only if <λ < 1 ∀ λ ∈ σ(JF ): this point is an attractor.
• unstable if and only if <λ > 1 ∀λ ∈ σ(JF ): this point is a repeller.
• no conclusions on stability if <λ > 1 for some λ ∈ σ(JF ).

2

The finite difference method is called elementary stable if, for any value of the time step ∆t, the linear
stability of each ξ˜n ∈ Γd is the same as the stability of each ξ˜ ∈ Γc .
From a theoretical point of view this criterion is good in every case to control the stability of the
steady–states. Nevertheless, in the case of multi–dimensional systems, expecially in two and three dimensions,
it is more convenient to use an alternative method, the so–called Jury criterion [8]. Let J˜F := JF (ξ˜n ), for
two dimensional systems the characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian can be written as:
λ2 − λ tr(J˜F ) + det(J˜F ).

(5)

In order to have <λ < 1 for all λ ∈ σ(JF ), the Jury condition states that:
| tr(J˜F )| < 1 + det(J˜F ) < 2.

(6)

Therefore, this criterion establishes that exists a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the steady–state solutions.
The Forward–Euler Method. This is one of the oldest way to derive a finite difference equation from a
differential equation. This numerical procedure requires that the system (1) is transformed by introducing
these substitutions:
ξ(t) −→ ξn ,

(7)

dξ(t)
ξn+1 − ξn
−→
,
dt
∆t

(8)

where ∆t is the step size and ξn+1 ≈ ξ(t + n∆t). As showed by Mickens (see i.e., the reference [15]), in
many cases the transformation of eq. (8) leads to numerical instabilities which occur as solutions of the finite
difference equations, steady–states, bifurcations etc. that do not appear in the originary differential equation.

3.1

Nonstandard Finite Difference method

To avoid these potential problems, Mickens [11] suggests what is known as the Nonstandard Finite Difference
(NSFD) method. An important concept on which the NSFD schemes is based is the Dynamic Consistency
[16]. This criterion states that, let the first–order autonomous ODE
dξ
= f (ξ, k),
dt

(9)

and given U its set of properties, the difference equation
ξn+1 = F (ξn , k, ∆t),

(10)

is dynamically consistent with (9) if it respects the same set of properties. As indicated in [1], the dynamic
consistency is verified when a difference equation possesses the same stability, bifurcations and chaos of the
original differential equation.
A finite difference method is called a NSFD scheme is almost one of the following conditions is satisfied:
I. The order of the discrete derivative should be equal to the order of the corresponding derivatives of the
differential equation.
II. Denominator functions for the discrete rapresentation must be non–trivial. The following replacement
is then required:
∆t −→ φ(∆t) + O(∆t2 ),
where φ(∆t) is such that 0 < φ(∆t) < 1, ∀∆t > 0.

3

III. Nonlinear terms must be replaced by non–local discrete representations, i.e.,
ξ 2 −→ ξn ξn+1 .
IV. Special conditions that hold for the solutions of the differential equations should also hold for the
solutions of the finite difference scheme.
V. The scheme should not introduces spurious solutions.
The NSFD scheme incorporates the principle of Dynamical Consistency.
A very important characteristic of dynamical systems, especially in those of biological interest, is that
all solutions must remain non–negative in order to maintain the problem well–posed, from biological and
mathematical points of view. A method that respects the Mickens rules (I to V) and preserves the solution
positivity is called Positive and Elementary Stable Nonstandard (PESN) method. The appropriate non–local
approximation that provides a such scheme is constructed by using the indications suggested by Patankar [17].
Applying these expedients, the discrete scheme will comply with the physical properties of the differential
equations, without any restriction on the step size ∆t.

An Elementary Application: the Logistic Population Model

The logistic equation, originally due to Pierre François Verhulst [20], is the law that regulates with good
approximation the growth rate of a certain population number as function of time. The model is based on
the assumption that the population evolves in an environment with limited resources with no immigration or
emigration phenomena. Let x(t) the population at instant t, the law that regulates it can be expressed from
the following first–order autonomous ODE:
rx2 (t)
dx(t)
= rx(t) −
,
(11)
dt
E
where E is the carrying capacity of the system and r is the intrinsic growth rate (r = b − d, where b is the
instantaneous birth rate and d the instantaneous death rate); also we assume r, k > 0. The eq. (11) is the
same as (1) assuming ξ = x(t) and f coinciding with the right hand term. In this equation the term rx(t) is
the intrinsic population growth rate, while −rx2 (t)/E is the self–limitating term. These two factors of f
have opposite sign then f can be greater, lesser or equal to zero: this determines respectively the increase,
the decrease or the constancy of the population.
Applying the condition dicted by eq. (2), is simple to calculate the two steady–states: a trivial solution
x̃1 = 0 and a non–trivial x̃2 = E. Substituting these solutions in the Jacobian J(x) = 1 − 2x/E the following
inequalities J(x̃1 ) > 0 and J(x̃2 ) < 0 hold. We can deduce that only the solution x̃2 = E is asymptotically
stable.
This can be deduced also by an alternative way. The differential equation (11), solved by variables separation
technique, admits the following solution:
x(t) =

E
x0

1+


.
− 1 e−rt

(12)

Calculating the limit of eq. (12) for t −→ +∞ the population has just E as its asymptotic value.

4.1

Discrete model of logistic equation.

Following the NSFD rules, the logistic model of eq. (11) can be transformed in the discrete scheme:
rx2 (t)
∆x(t)
= rx(t) −
,
φ(∆t)
E

(13)

where ∆x(t) = xn+1 − xn and φ(∆t) is a function of the time step in respect of the rule II; in accord with
rule III, x2 −→ xn xn+1 . Therefore xn+1 can be so explicited:
xn+1 =

1 + rφ(∆t)
1+

rφ(∆t)
xn
E

4

xn ,

(14)

where x0 = x(t = 0) is the initial population. It is simple to show that the condition of positiveness xn+1 ≥ 0
is automatically satisfied if φ satisfy the rule II of the NSFD scheme. The steady–states of eq. (14) are x̃1 = 0
and x̃1 = E: for the trivial steady–state, J(x̃1 ) = 1 + rφ > 1 for r > 0 and 0 < φ < 1, then is unstable;
for the non trivial one, J(x̃2 ) = 1/(1 + rφ) < 1, then is asimptotically stable. We conclude that the NSFD
scheme well reproduces the behavior of the differential equation (13).
In opposition, the Euler and Runge–Kutta discretization methods are dynamically inconsistent with the
original differential equation [12], showing numerical instabilities. Also in [2] is remarked that the application
of these two standard schemes produces a not correct monotonicity and oscillations for particular values of
the mesh ∆t.

Mutualistic Interaction Between two Species

It is now considered a more complex case respect to the logistic equation: this is the formulation introduced
by Holland and DeAngelis 2009 [5] for the mutualism description, based on Rosenzweig–MacArthur model
of predator–prey interactions. After a brief review of the problem in continuous–time domain, two discrete
schemes will be proposed.

5.1

Continuous–time domain

Subsequently it will be denoted with x(t) and y(t) the numbers (or densities) of the mutualistic species. In a
mutualistic model, the growth rate of each species must involves the same terms of the logistic equation (11)
that represent effect separate from mutualism: a linear term that represent the intrinsic population growth
rate and a quadratic one to modify the growth rate with density dependent self–limitation. Also, for each
species, in case of bi–directional mutualism, other two terms are required:
• a positive term that quantify the advantages that the presence of a species induces on the growth of
the other (αij in eq. (15)),
• a negative term that describes the disadvantages that the presence of a species induces on the growth
of the other (βi in eq. (15)).
With these two conditions, a community of two mutualistic species can be described by the following system

It is worth noting that the above system is not unconditionally positive due to the presence of negative terms
that can allow the generation of negative solutions. This feature is considered to be precursor for numerical
instabilities. For the calculation of the fixed points, the following system must have resolved:

rules:
• II rule: denominators of left–hand side are replaced with φ = φ(∆t);
• III rule and PESN criterion: the terms on the right of the equations are replaced with a non–local

Numerical Simulations

In this Section are presented some numerical simulations to test the dynamic consistence of the NSFD and
the Forward–Euler schemes found in Subsection 5.2 with the continuous–time one described by the system
(15).

6.1

Steady–states analysis

In continuous–time domain the problem is largely discussed in [7] and [5]: these authors have performed
many simulations assuming different values for the model’s parameters, i.e., assuming different types of
mutualism. In this paper a unique simulation for steady–state analysis is reported, hypothesizing for the
involved parameters r1 , r2 , α12 , α21 , β1 , β2 , e1 , e2 , d1 and d2 the same values used by Holland and DeAngelis
[5] for bi–directional mutualism. The steady–states have been calculated applying the condition (2) to the
system of differential equation (15). From graphical point of view, the steady–states are found plotting
the zero–growth isoclines of each system’s equation and are represented by the points where the isoclines
intersect between them. The phase–plane diagrams for the x–y dynamics is showed in Figure 1a where the
zero–growth isoclines are depicted.
In the discrete case, NSFD derived scheme has been compared with the Euler one calculating the
solutions of the systems (25) and (18) respectively. The Figure 1b represents the isoclines described by the
Euler and NSFD schemes for ∆t = 10−3 . From those graphs can be seen that, for the assumed parameters,
the dynamical system has 6 steady–states, indicated with Γ0 , Γ1 ,.., Γ5 in counterclockwise sense. Also,
none of the two discretization methods introduces spurious solutions: the coordinates of the steady–states
are the same and the isoclined are perfectly superimposed. The Table 1 summarizes the results of these
simulations and the conclusions on steady–states stability for continuous and discrete–time schemes. From
the examination of the signs of the eigenvalues, it emerges that Γ0 , Γ2 and Γ4 are repellers (indicated in
figure with a black square) and Γ1 , Γ3 and Γ5 are attractors (black circle).

Figure 1: Comparison between phase–plane diagrams for continuous–time and discrete–time cases. (a) Zero–growth isoclines
for system of eq. (15) are represented as black (dx/dt = 0) and red (dy/dt = 0) lines. (b) Zero–growth isoclines come from
the system (25): black dotted line for first equation and red dotted line for the second equation; zero–growth isoclines come
from system (18): in blue the first equation and in green the second one (completely superimposed to the NSFD lines). For the
discretization parameters, the following values have been used: ∆t = 10−3 , q = 10. The steady–states are marked with letters
Γ0 to Γ5 : the squares (Γ0 , Γ2 , Γ4 ) indicate the repellers of the system as well as the circles (Γ1 , Γ3 , Γ5 ) indicate the attractors.
The value assigned at each parameter is [5]: r1 = r2 = 0.3, α12 = α21 = 0.6, q1 = q2 = 1, β1 = β2 = 0.2, d1 = d2 = 0.01,
h1 = h2 = 0.3 and e1 = e2 = 0.3.

However, when ∆t is increased up to 8.445 · 10−2 we observe that the Euler scheme converges toward
wrong steady–states or the two populations have a boundless growth. On the contrary the phase–plane of
the NSFD remains unchanged.
Since one of the requisites for the dynamic consistence is the invariance of the stability conditions
regardless to the discretization step–size, has been checked for NSFD scheme if the Jury condition is guaranteed
or not independently from the value of ∆t. This check is not performed for Euler scheme because, as explained
above, it fails the convergence to the correct fixed points for certain values of the step–size.
In order to verify this, the condition (6) is splitted in two inequalities that will be proved for all ξ˜ ∈ Γd ,
making explicit the dependence of the Jacobian elements from ∆t:
˜
det(J(∆t))
− 1 < 0,


˜
˜
 > 0.

+ 1 −  tr(J(∆t))

(28)

The Figures 2a and 2b represent respectively the left term of eq. (27) and (28), both evaluated as function
of ∆t: in both graphs every curve is related to at least one steady–state Γ0 , Γ1 , ..., Γ5 . Only for reasons of
correct graphic visualization the two figures have different scales on abscissa. It is easy to see that both the
inequalities (27) and (28) are satisfied for NSFD schemes only from Γ1 , Γ3 and Γ5 steady–states for each
value of ∆t represented. Nevertheless, has been checked that all the curves are monotone for 0 < ∆t ≤ 10,
then the conclusions about the steady–states stability are unchanged up to ∆t = 10.

6.2

Transient dynamics

In this Section a transient analysis has been performed with the purpose to emphasize the possible criticalities
of the two considered discretization schemes.
The phase–plane portraits of NSFD and Forward–Euler difference equations has been shown in Figure 3a
and b respectively: all the used parameters are the same used for computation of Figure 1, exception for
the time step that now is ∆t = 6 · 10−2 . From the comparison it is possible to observe some differences
highlighted by red rectangles in the Figure 3b named with D1 and D2 . The subplots 3c and d represent the
magnification of what happens in D1 and D2 respectively: it is possible to note that in subdomain D1 the
population x assumes negative values for about y ≥ 45 and the population y assumes negative values for
about x ≥ 45. All these negative values appear during the transient.
The Figures 4a and c show a plot of the populations vs the iteration number using respectively (17)
and (20) schemes. In order to show as the numerical instabilities arise for larger values of ∆t a comparison
between Euler and NSFD schemes has been performed by assuming respectively ∆t = 10−3 (see Figure 4a)
and 8.44 · 10−2 (see Figure 4c) with initial populations (x0 , y0 ) = (30, 10). It can be seen from the Figure
4a that for both Euler and NSFD equations, after a transient in which the populations x and y reach their
maximum values, about 72 and 11 individuals, they converge smoothly toward x = 30 and y = 0 individuals
(steady–state Γ1 ). The relative phase–plane is depicted in the Figure 4b, where the two trajectories are
perfectly superimposed. By increasing the time step up to ∆t = 8.44 · 10−2 the populations behave as
in Figure 4c, calculated keeping all other parameters unchanged. The remarkable fact is that, while for
NSFD the transient preserves the same aspect of Figure 4a, the Euler scheme shows jumps for both x and y
populations around the 40th iteration and an anomalous behavior that also continues in later iterations. In
Figure 4d is plotted the relative phase–plane where the difference between NSFD and Euler trajectories are
particularly evident; also note the difference of the Euler trajectories between the subplots b and d.
From the tests that have been performed it is possible to infer that the first numerical instabilities in
Forward–Euler scheme occur when ∆t overcomes the critical value of ∆tc ' 5 · 10−2 . The reason is that
in Forward–Euler the step sizes larger than ∆tc are greater than some characteristic time relevant of this
physical problem. The same is not true employing the NSFD technique, in which the numerical instabilities
are eliminated since the selected step size of eq. (23) is never larger than the smallest time scale of the system.

Conclusions

On the base of the work published by Holland and DeAngelis in 2009, in which is constructed and analyzed a
population dynamic continuous–time model linking the consumer functional responses of one mutualistic

species with resources supplied by another, in this paper a strong nonstandard finite difference scheme to
solve the continuous–time model is constructed. As shown by numerical simulations, the NSFD framework
reproduces the dynamical features of the continuous–time analogous. In particular, it is proved that the
method guarantees the correct asymptotic behavior regardless from the size of the time step. It was shown
that, with the same initial conditions, the Forward–Euler induces scheme–dependent numerical instabilities
for ∆t greater than a critical values, that manifest as jumps in the population evolution in time domain
and convergence toward wrong steady–state solutions. On the other hand, in tests that were performed, the
NSFD scheme shows none of these problems, confirming the versatility of the method.
