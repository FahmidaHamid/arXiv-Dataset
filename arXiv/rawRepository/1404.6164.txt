Enhanced dynamical fluctuations of RNAs, facilitated by a network of water molecules with
strong interactions with RNA, are suspected to be critical in their ability to respond to a variety of
cellular signals. Using atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations at various temperatures
of purine (adenine)- and preQ1 sensing riboswitch aptamers, which control gene expression by
sensing and binding to metabolites, we show that water molecules in the vicinity of RNAs undergo
complex dynamics depending on the local structures of the RNAs. The overall lifetimes of hydrogen
bonds (HBs) of surface bound waters are more than at least 1–2 orders of magnitude longer
than bulk water. Slow hydration dynamics, revealed in non-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation
time, arises from high activation barriers to break water hydrogen bonds with a nucleotide and
by reduced diffusion of water. The relaxation kinetics at specific locations in the two RNAs show
a broad spectrum of time scales reminiscent of glass-like behavior, suggesting that the hydration
dynamics is highly heterogeneous. Both RNAs undergo dynamic transition at T = TD & 200 K
as assessed by the mean square fluctuation of hydrogen atoms hx2 i, which undergoes an abrupt
harmonic-to-anharmonic transition at TD . The near universal value of TD found for these RNAs
and previously for tRNA is strongly correlated with changes in hydration dynamics as T is altered.
Hierarchical dynamics of waters associated with the RNA surface, revealed in the motions of distinct
classes of water with well-separated time scales, reflects the heterogeneous local environment on the
molecular surface of RNA. At low temperatures slow water dynamics predominates over structural
transitions. Our study demonstrates that the complex interplay of dynamics between water and
local environment in the RNA structures could be a key determinant of the functional activities of
RNA.

INTRODUCTION

Water, the most abundant constituent in living organisms, is an essential determinant of the structure
and dynamics, and hence the functions of biomolecules
[1–7]. In the well understood case of proteins the
thermodynamic driving force that minimizes the free
energy of proteins arises from the simultaneous requirements to sequester hydrophobic residues from
water, and increase the extent of hydration of the
surface-exposed hydrophilic residues. Interactions of
hydrophilic residues with water enhance the dynamical fluctuation of proteins, promoting enzymatic activity [2–5, 8, 9]. Dynamic fluctuations of solvated
folded proteins, quantified by the motion of hydrogen
atoms using neutron scattering measurement, in aqueous D2 O solution exhibit qualitative difference from
dry proteins, the latter of which can be experimented
in a dry powder form, in glycerol solvent [10], or in
cryosolvent CD3 OD/D2 O, DMSO/D2 O mixed in various proportions [9]. Temperature dependence of protein fluctuation shows that at low temperature mean
square displacement (MSD) of hydrogen atoms hx2 i
in both wet and dry proteins increases in an identi-

cal fashion, but hx2 i of wet proteins begins to deviate
from its linear temperature dependence at the so called
dynamical transition temperature TD ≈ 200 K, which
coincides with the temperature range where functions
of most hydrated proteins begin to emerge [9, 11]. Although the origin of enhanced amplitude of motion of
above TD continues to be debated, it is clear that there
is correlation between enzyme activity and abrupt increase in hx2 i above TD .
Although not as extensively investigated as proteins,
there are a number of studies on the hydration effects on DNA, focusing on hydration-induced conformational change from A- to B-form as well as on the
variation in conductivity [1, 12–14]. In contrast, much
less is known about the nature of water dynamics on
RNA molecules and its role in modulating their functions. Despite a few early studies [15, 16] the potential similarities and differences in hydration effects between proteins and RNA were first pointed out using a
combination of quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments complemented by preliminary simulations [6, 7].
These and more recent experimental [17, 18] and simulation studies on tRNA [7] and hairpin ribozyme [19]
have emphasized the role of relaxation of water local-

2
ized at the surface of RNA in inducing the dynamical
transition at TD .
There are many reasons to undertake a detailed
study of the impact of water on the native state fluctuations of RNA. First, in executing many of their
functions RNA accesses low lying excitations, which
often might involve local melting of bases as a function of temperature. For example, in prokaryotes there
are temperature sensitive elements in the 50 untranslated regions (UTRs) which form base pair with ribosome recognition sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) at
low temperatures, thus suppressing translation. Recent NMR experiments [20, 21] suggest that the melting of these strategically located RNA sequences in
response to elevation in temperature, needed for initiating translating, involves potential pre-melting of the
hydration shell. Second, the versatile functional capacity of RNA can be attributed to their ability to
access low free energy conformational excitations, as
demonstrated by probing site specific motions in two
regulatory forms of RNAs from HIV-1 [22]. By undergoing such motions on time scales on the order of
a few nanoseconds RNA molecules adopt a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations, which poises them
to recognize and bind a diverse set of ligands. The key
study on RNAs from HIV-1 shows that the ability to
access such states on a relatively short time scale shows
the ability of RNA to adapt to changing environmental stimuli, and is encoded in the sequence. Thirdly,
binding of metabolites to riboswitches to control gene
expression is likely linked to local fluctuations in specific regions of co-transcriptionally folded UTR regions
of mRNA. In all these examples hydration of RNA is
likely to play an important role.
We expect that the unique capacity of a single RNA
to change conformations rapidly (plasticity of RNA)
should lead to complex solvent dynamics of water
[7, 23, 24] and counterions [25–30] that strongly interact with RNA surface. RNA, which has almost an
identical chemical composition with DNA except for
an additional hydroxyl group in the 2’-position of ribose ring, displays far more complex structure and
dynamics than DNA. Unlike double-stranded DNA,
characterized with a homogeneous repeat of WatsonCrick base pairs, structures of RNA in native state
are highly heterogeneous, which could give rise to a
great amount of variations in dynamics of water [6, 7]
and ions [25, 26, 28–31] depending on the location on
RNA surface. In order to elucidate this aspect and to
establish the “universal” structural basis of, particularly, the water-induced dynamical transition in RNA,
we focus our study on water dynamics near RNA using two RNA molecules, purine- [32–37] and preQ1 riboswitches [23]. Because the water dynamics at the

RNA surface is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster
than dynamics of monovalent counterions, water dynamics occurs effectively on a static electrostatic environment. Due to their small size both riboswitch aptamers, containing key structural elements (kissing interactions, non-canonical base pairs, and pseudoknot),
are ideal systems to simulate and to address general
features of temperature dependent changes in RNA hydration dynamics. Besides usual secondary structural
elements such as stack and loop, the purine riboswitch
has a three-way junction motif where three helices intersect (Fig.1a, left). Binding of a purine metabolite
into the junction motif consolidates these three helices
into a compact structure. Similarly, preQ1 ligand and
Ca2+ ions forge the preQ1 -riboswitch into a compact
conformation that adopt H-type pseudoknot in which
the nucleobases, composing the main helix (P1), stabilize the adenine-rich 3’-tail via Hoogsteen interaction
(Fig.1a, right) [23, 38].
In this study, we investigate the water dynamics at
various locations in the vicinity of folded RNA surface
as a function of temperature (T ) in the range of 100 K
≤ T ≤ 310 K using atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations. To study the relaxation dynamics
of water molecules, we computed the number of water
hydrogen bonds (HBs) made with each part of RNA
structure, and calculated the correlation function to
quantify the kinetics and time constant of relaxation
(τ ) at each temperature. To establish the universality
of TD , we calculated the T -dependence of hx2 i (see
Methods) and showed that RNAs also undergo dynamic transition at T = TD ≈ 200 K. Over the broad
range of temperature above T = TD the relaxation
time of water HB, τ , obeys the Arrhenius relation,
which allows us to extract the corresponding activation
energy and attempt frequency for the hydrated water
around RNA. The dynamics of water fluctuations near
the riboswitches is highly heterogeneous, reminiscent
of glass-like behavior, and is suggestive of low free energy of excitations around the putative folded state.
By comparing these parameters from the Arrhenius-fit
with those of bulk water, we show that there are distinct classes of water molecules (not all waters are the
same!) near RNA surface. The heterogeneous behavior of RNA dressed with water molecules, with dynamics in the nanosecond time scale, might have functional
importance.

unit of ps. The decay of the HB correlations on a log-log
scale is in the box.

average number of water molecules coordinating the
riboswitch aptamers after equilibrating the entire system composing of RNA and solvent at T = 310 K.
We find that within 3.5 Å from the surface (nonhydrogen heavy atoms) of the purine riboswitch there
are on average NH2 O = 744 water molecules (water
oxygens), which corresponds to nH2 O = 10.5 waters
per nucleotide. For preQ1 -riboswitch, NH2 O =361 and
nH2 O =10.0. These water molecules can be defined as
those in the first hydration shell around the aptamers.
We find that in our simulations that the hydration

level, h, defined as the amount of hydrated water in
gram per 1 g of RNA, is h ≈ 0.59 for the purine riboswitch, and h ≈0.56 for preQ1 riboswitch. The relation hpurine > hpreQ1 indicates that preQ1 riboswitch is
more compact than purine riboswitch. The calculated
values of h are similar to the experimentally measured
value for hydrated tRNA (h ≈ 0.61) [7]. Thus, generic
aspects of hydration dynamics can be inferred from
our simulations.
To reveal dynamic features of water near the RNA
surface in further detail, we counted the average number of water HBs formed with the riboswitch aptamers.
Although there are many ways of defining hydrogen
bonds [39], we use a geometric criterion, which is often
used to analyze hydrogen bonds in proteins and RNA
structures. We assume that a hydrogen-bond is formed
when, in addition to the distance criterion (< 3.5 Å),
the angle between the hydrogen donor-acceptor axis
and the donor-hydrogen bond (O-H/N-H) is < 30o .
With this definition, there are NHB ≈ 543 HBs formed
between water molecules and the purine-riboswitch
during the simulations, which corresponds to nHB ≈
7.7 water HBs per nucleotide. For preQ1 -riboswitch,
we find NHB ≈ 252 and nHB ≈ 7.0. Our previous simulations of tRNAP he [7], whose size is comparable to
add -riboswitch, showed a similar value for the number.
We find that the formation of HB with RNA is
heterogeneous. In particular, the propensity to make
H-bond with water varies depending on the position of
a given atom in the nucleotide. In the native state, (i)
the O1P and O2P atoms of phosphate group (Fig. 1b),
which are the most exposed parts of the nucleotide to
the solvent, form about 2 − 2.5 hydrogen bonds with
water molecules. (ii) In most of the residues, atoms
O3’, O4’, and O5’ in the ribose group are less solvent
accessible, and form only about 0.5, 0.5, and 0.3 HBs,
respectively, whereas O2’ atoms form ≈ 1 HB with
water hydrogens (Fig.1b). (iii) In the base groups,
unprotonated nitrogen and oxygen (N/O) atoms
form about 0.5-1 HB with water hydrogens, but the
protonated nitrogen and oxygen (NH/OH) form < 0.5
HBs with water oxygen. As expected, the average
number of HBs with water for protonated sites are
smaller than unprotonated sites because many protonated sites participate in the formation of base pairs.
Kinetics of water hydrogen bond near RNA
surface: The abundance of water molecules around
phosphate group is easily anticipated because phosphate groups are not only negatively charged, but are
also the most exposed to the solvent environment in
both the native and unfolded states. Thus, it may be
tempting to conclude that the residence time of water molecules near phosphate groups should be longer

4
than ribose or base groups. However, our simulations
show that water dynamics around RNA is considerably more complicated reflecting complex structure of
RNA. Surprisingly, it turns out that instead of phosphate groups, water exhibits the slowest relaxation dynamics near bases. To elucidate the complex water
dynamics near the surface of RNA, we quantify the
relaxation dynamics of the number of water HBs as
a function of time using the time correlation function
(c(t)) (see Methods).
As shown in Fig.1c, the relaxation kinetics of water HB at T = 310 K with different nucleotide groups
(B:base, R:ribose, P:phosphate) of purine riboswitch
aptamer can be described
using a multi-exponential

with

i=1 φi = 1,
ξ =B, R, and P. (It is possible to fit c(t) using stretched
exponential function. However, we find that depending on T the fit might require more than one stretched
exponential function, making the interpretation difficult.) The multi-phasic kinetics implies that various types of interactions with distinct time scales govern the dynamics of water molecules with nucleotides.
In Fig.1c, up to the 99.9 % of the decay of cξ (t)
can be described with N=4. Among the four phases,
the time scales of relaxation and the corresponding
weights satisfy an inequality τ1 < τ2 < τ3 < τ4 with
φ1 > φ2 > φ3 > φ4 . The values of φi , satisfying
φ1 + φ2 > 0.9 and τ1 < τ2 < 100 ps, indicate that
most of water H-bond dynamics (≈ 90 %) occur on the
time scale of ∼ (1 − 100) ps. The correlation function
(or survival probability) of water H-bonds drops below
10% when time t is greater than ∼ 100 ps. At short
times (t < 100 ps), hydrogen bonding of phosphate
groups with water has a longer relaxation time than
that of ribose or base with water, but at longer times
(t > 100 ps) slow water dynamics is dominated by water molecules trapped near base and ribose although
such contribution is made by less than 10R % of the
∞
hydrated water population. From hτξ i = 0 cξ (t)dt,
the average lifetime of water H-bond at each group
is calculated as hτP i = 163 ps, hτR i = 81 ps, and
hτB i = 289 ps. It is worth emphasizing that the lifetime of water H-bond with base group is twice longer
than that with ribose or phosphate group. Compared
with the lifetime of HBs in bulk water (∼ 5 ps) at 310
K (see Fig.4c), the overall relaxation time of hydrogen
bonds between nucleotides and water is 1 − 2 orders
of magnitude longer, which suggests that the slow dynamics of water near RNA is due to stronger interactions with the nucleotide or reduced diffusion constant
of water on the RNA surface. Although counterions
also play a central role in modulating RNA structure
[28–30] and binding or release dynamics of Na+ ions
at the surface of RNA would certainly perturb the wa-

ter environment, the time scales of such events are far
slower than the time scale of hydration. The relaxation
time of counterion dynamics at the surface of RNA is
hτB i ≈ 9.2 ns, hτR i ≈ 62.6 ns, and hτP i ≈ 294 ns,
which are more than two orders of magnitude slower
than that of water molecules, the details of which we
will report elsewhere. Due to the large time scale separation between water and ion dynamics, the hydration
dynamics around RNA is expected to occur effectively
in a static quenched counterion environment.
The hierarchy of time scales needed to describe
the slow hydration dynamics is reminiscent of glassy
dynamics. As stated above, it is also possible to
fit the relaxation data using stretched exponential.
Nevertheless, the multi-phasic kinetics, originating
from the heterogeneity of conformations that RNA
samples on fast time time scales facilitated by water
(acting as a lubricant), should be distinguished from
glass-like behavior in highly supercooled materials
at low temperatures (see below, Fig.4). At T =310
K, we show that the majority (&90 %) of water HB
dynamics are well described by considering double
exponential function with two distinct time scales.
Just like proteins [40, 41], water molecules interacting
with RNA exist in diverse forms, which leads to a
broad temporal scale in dynamics. Based on the
well-separated time scales describing the decay of c(t)
we classify water molecules into bulk (∼ O(100 − 101 )
ps), surface (∼ O(101 − 102 ) ps), cleft (∼ O(102 − 103 )
ps), and buried water ( O(103 ) ps) [42] groups.
Hydrogen bond dynamics varies in different
RNA regions: For adenine riboswitch we performed
a similar analysis of HB relaxation dynamics by focusing on the paired helices P1, P2, P3 and the junction
region (Fig.1a left). The relaxation kinetics of hydrogen bond at T = 310 K can be quantitatively fit using,
cP 1 (t) = 0.65e−t/4.8 + 0.29e−t/42.3 + 0.06e−t/532
cP 2 (t) = 0.61e−t/4.9 + 0.30e−t/52.8 + 0.09e−t/403
cP 3 (t) = 0.62e−t/4.8 + 0.29e−t/52.1 + 0.09e−t/456
cJ (t) = 0.57e−t/5.4 + 0.29e−t/65.5 + 0.14e−t/932 (1)
where t is in the unit of ps, which gives hτP 1 i = 88.6
ps, hτP 2 i = 96.3 ps, hτP 3 i = 88.7 ps, and hτJ i = 416
ps. Longer lifetime of water H-bond kinetics in the
junction region (hτJ i > hτP 1 i, hτP 2 i, hτP 3 i) implies a
greater population of water molecules trapped around
the junction region, which is stabilized by the three
helices through binding of the purine metabolite. Due
to the stronger electrostatic potential and the extent
of water molecules being buried at the junction where
the three helices meet, the dynamics of waters at the

junction are less dynamic than on the paired helices.
Dynamical Transition of RNA at around 200
K: A number of studies have confirmed the existence
of dynamic transition of proteins at TD ≈ 180−220 K,
above which the temperature response of hx2 i of proteins changes from harmonic to anharmonic [8, 9, 43].
Similarly, starting with our early studies it is now
known that RNA molecules also undergo a similar
transition at TD . It is likely that the transition in
RNA is induced by the solvent [6, 19] although there
are differences in the dependence of TD on the extent
of hydration (h). In order to establish the universality
of the previous findings, established for tRNA, we calculated MSD of hydrogen atom using the time scale of
0.1 ns for both purine- and preQ1 riboswitches. In accord with the previous study using t-RNA [6], our simulations also confirm that the dynamical transition at
T ≈ TD (Fig.2). At low temperature range (T . 180
K), MSD for both riboswitches increase almost linearly with the identical amplitude, but there is an onset of deviation between the two MSDs at T ≈ 190 K.
The amplitude of MSD for purine riboswitch (71 nt)
is larger than that of preQ1 riboswitch (36 nt), which
is consistent with an expectation of hx2 i ∼ N .
The harmonic-to-anharmonic transition of MSD in
response to an increasing temperature is reminiscent

of the interpretation for proteins that the folded
protein samples alternate conformations in the rugged
free energy landscape [44]. In the case of RNAs, it
is well known that their folding landscape is rough
implying that there are easily accessible (on the
time scale of nanoseconds) excitations around the
native state [45]. Thus, it is likely that the mobility
of the water molecules in the vicinity of the RNA
surface at T > TD enables structural relaxation
[46]. Recent experimental studies using dielectric and
two-dimensional infrared spectroscopies that directly
probe both the hydration and protein dynamics
provide evidence that protein dynamics is slaved to
the surrounding solvent environment [47, 48]. For
proteins, the structural interpretation of the change
in dynamics at TD has been controversial with some
ascribing it to the rotational motion of methyl group
[49], while others argue that it is due to solvent
dynamics. In contrast to the dynamics of proteins,
the situation in RNA is simpler. Nucleic acids do
not contain methyl groups, and hence it does not
seem plausible that the change in the dynamics at TD
is mediated solely by structural transition in RNA.
It is likely that the dynamical transition RNA is
“induced” by a change in water dynamics [6]. The
hypothesis that the dynamical transition of both
protein and RNA is water-induced is also supported
by the observation that the H-bond relaxation time of
bulk water undergoes dynamic transition at T ≈ 200
K, which is comparable to the dynamic transition
temperature of surface water (Fig.4c, see below).
Enhanced ordering of surface water: Even at
T = 310 K, compared with radial distribution function
(RDF) of bulk water, the first peaks of surface water
O-H and H-H RDFs display significantly sharpened
peaks (Fig.3), suggesting that there is an enhanced ordering in the surface water. The first peaks of surface
water RDF, corresponding to the intramolecular bond
and geometry of water (O-H and H-H), have an order
of magnitude greater amplitude than those of bulk
water (Fig.3b), whereas the first peak of O-O pair
distribution, which is due to purely intermolecular
interactions with bulk water molecules, has almost no
difference. The enhanced ordering of surface water
is due to stronger interaction with specific atoms
on the RNA surface resulting in suppression of the
fluctuations of water molecule directly coordinated
to the nucleotides. This static picture of water RDF
with sharpened peak, is indicative of the enhanced
ordering of surface water molecule, also manifests itself in the water dynamics near the surface (see below).

and the electrostatic potential calculated by numerically solving nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann equation
in 150 mM-monovalent salt condition as a reference

groups, fully exposed to the solvent environment, have
a small electrostatic potential at the water-contacting
surface due to screening by counterions. The base
groups are hidden deep inside the neighboring basestacks, and are not easily accessible to the solvent. In
24U and 35A, the base groups are accessible to the solvent although the base group of 35A is located in the
interior of the pocket formed with the L1 loop [23], and
hence has high negative charge (Fig.4a). By studying
the relaxation dynamics around these nucleotides with
differing local environment, we establish that water dynamics is heterogeneous.

Fig.4b shows the correlation function (c(t)) of water HB in the bulk (left) and around 35A (right) at
various temperatures. Similar to the c(t) calculated
for B, R, P group of nucleotides at T = 310K, both
c(t) in the bulk and near the nucleotides 35A and
33C arePwell described by multi-phasic kinetics, i.e.,
N
c(t) = i=1 φi e−t/τi . For water hydrogen-bond both
in the bulk and near 35A and 33C, at high temperature, population of fast dynamics is dominant, but as
temperature decreases the influence of slow dynamics
grows (see Appendix and Fig.A1 for the bulk water
and the caption of Fig.4 for the waters near 35A and
33C).
Dynamics of bulk water: Aside from the water dynamics near the surface of biopolymers, dynamical behavior of bulk water as a function of temperature is
also a complex topic. Thus, it would be useful to discuss the bulk water property prior to discussing the
behavior surface water. The correlation times of HB
for supercooled water in the bulk are described either
with multi-phasic kinetics up to & 90 % of the population (the left panel on the Fig.4b) or conventionally
with stretch exponentials [50]. The time scale for the

HB relaxation times calculated for the water molecules near 33C, 35A of preQ1 -riboswitch, and for the bulk water. The
onset of deviation from Arrhenius-like behavior (τ Arr ∼ eA/T ) is displayed as temperature (T ) decreases below T = 200
K. The linear regression using log τ Arr = log τo + A/T , made for the data points with T ≥ 200 K, i.e., T0 /T ≤ 1, results
in (Abulk , τobulk ) = (4.14, 0.088), (A24U , τo24U ) = (7.24, 0.018), (A29A , τo29A ) = (3.41, 6.11), (A33C , τo33C ) = (3.75, 4.65), and
(A35A , τo35A ) = (7.17, 0.021), where A has the unit of kB Tr with kB being the Boltzmann constant and Tr = 310 K, and
τo has the ps unit.

slow relaxation mode reaches O(1011 ) ps at T = 130 K.
The water dynamics, governed by short time dynamics
(τ ∼ O(1) ps), is most dominant at high temperature,
T ≈ 300 K (see APPENDIX), but the anomalies of water dynamics, characterized by long relaxation times,
are further amplified as temperature is decreased. This
observation signifies that motions of water is governed
by very different types of phenomenology depending on
the time scale of observation, such as short-time free
diffusion, intermediate dynamics due to cage effect,
followed by long-time free diffusion. It is noteworthy
that even at low temperatures the contribution of fast
relaxation mode (τ ∼ O(1) ps), which could be considered as the bulk water property at high temperatures,
does not completely vanish but still remains finite at
relatively long times.
As long as T & 200 K, when the average relaxation
R ∞ time of water HB (τ ) is calculated using τ =
dtc(t), the dependence of τ on the inverse tem0
perature (1/T ) can be described using “Arrheniuslike” kinetics (Fig.4c). The linear regression using
log τ Arr = log τobulk + A/T , made for the data points
with T ≥ 200 K, i.e., T0 /T ≤ 1, results in Abulk = 4.14
kB Tr with Tr = 310 and τobulk = 0.088 ps. Of particular note is that the value of τobulk is similar to
Eyring’s transition theory estimate h/kB Tr ≈ 0.15 ps
[51]. The HB relaxation time of supercooled water
can be described over the entire temperature range
(150 ≤ T ≤ 310 K) by using the Vogel-FulcherTamman (VFT) equation often used to analyze temperature dependence of shear viscosity in glass forming materials. When the τ vs T plot for bulk water
is fitted to Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation,
DTc
τ VFT = τoVFT e T −Tc (dashed line in Fig.4c), we obtain
D = 3.00, Tc = 116.3K, and τoV F T = 0.95 ps. The
small value of D suggests that bulk water may be a
strong liquid at low temperatures.
Dynamics of surface water: Compared with bulk
water, the dynamics of water molecules near RNA
is slower by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the studied
temperature range (Figs.4b, c). Water molecules hydrated near RNA surface, however, also have a hierarchical structure in dynamical property (Fig.4). At
T = 300 K, the water HB dynamics is well fit using
c(t) = 0.26e−t/0.14ps + 0.60e−t/20.7ps + 0.14e−t/109ps ,
suggesting that the water HB dynamics is governed by
the time scale of O(101 ) − O(102 ) ps with the contribution from bulk water-like property being only ≈ 26
%. It would be more appropriate to interpret the hydrated water near RNA surface with longer time scale
by using, RNA structure-dependent description such
as, “surface”, “cleft”, and “buried”-water instead of
“cage effect” in supercooled water in the bulk. As temperature is decreased, the contribution of the “bulk”-

water (τ ∼ O(1) ps) diminishes and the contributions
from “surface”, “cleft”, and “buried”-water becomes
more dominant in the population of water interacting
with RNA.
The relaxation dynamics of HB for surface water can also be analyzed using Arrhenius equation
over the temperature range T > 180 K (Fig.4c): (i)
A24U , A35A ≈ 2A29A , 2A33C , 2Abulk suggests that the
activation energies associated with breaking water Hbond from 24U and 35A are twice larger than those associated with 29A, 33C or bulk waters; (ii) Each class
of τobulk , τo24U , τo35A (≈ (0.01−0.08) ps) and τo29A , τo33C
(≈ (4 − 6) ps) has the time constant in a similar range.
Note that 24U and 35A have a base group accessible
to the solvent environment, while 29A and 33C do not.
The similarity of time constants of 24U and 35A with
that of the bulk water indicates that the diffusional
property of water interacting with 24U and 35A are
effectively identical to that of bulk water. Therefore,
the above analysis allows us to divide the water dynamics near RNA at least into two classes. One is the
class in which activation barrier for water HB disruption is increased but the time constant for vibration
remains identical to bulk water (water around 24U,
35A); the other is the class in which activation barrier
remains identical but the time constant for vibration
is reduced by two orders of magnitude from that of
bulk water (water around 29A, 33C).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Despite fundamental difference between the chemical composition of RNA and proteins (for example
RNA with limited chemical diversity in the nucleotides
is highly charged along the phosphodiester backbone
whereas there is considerable diversity in the makeup
of natural protein sequences), we find that globally
there are some similarities in the hydration dynamics
in these biopolymers. Similar to proteins, RNA displays a dynamical transition signaling a harmonic-toanharmonic change in the MSD at the near universal
dynamical temperature, TD ≈ 200 K. This near universal value for TD suggests that the dynamical transition has more to do with solvent dynamics than with
any conformational fluctuations associated with RNA
or protein, as this study and others previously have
surmised [6, 52].
Water molecules interacting with RNA surface exhibit a broad spectrum of time scales, reflecting the
underlying architecture of the folded RNA. At the
ambient temperature, dynamics of bulk water occurs
on the time scale of ∼ O(1) ps as assessed in terms
of hydrogen bond formation and disruption [53]. In

9
sharp contrast, near RNA surface the time scale of
water HB with nucleotides exceeds ∼ O(102 ) ps. Although bulk and surface water molecules constitute
the major population near RNA surface, there is nonnegligible population of water molecules whose time
scale of interaction with nucleotide extends beyond
nsec. From the simulation trajectories we find that
these water molecules are either trapped in the narrow space formed between base-base stack, coordinated with multiple phosphate oxygens simultaneously
or with specifically bound multivalent counterions [54].
Fluctuations in these regions, which clearly require
coordinated motion of several water molecules, must
play an important role in ligand recognition by RNA,
as suggested by NMR experiments [22]. We classify
these as functional water molecules because the dynamics associated with these discrete waters might be
responsible for the motions identified in experiments
[20, 21].
Our focus here was restricted to the elucidation of
very slow dynamics associated with surface waters and
those discrete molecules in the cleft of RNA, which remains folded. An intriguing question is: what role do
these water molecules play in the folding process? It
is known that the persistence length of RNA decreases
dramatically as RNA folds [55, 56]. This implies that
the ordered state of RNA is more flexible than the
unfolded state, which is drastically different compared
to proteins. Based on the present study, we speculate
that in the unfolded state, with exposed phosphate and
bases, the dynamics of water associated with RNA is
also slow, perhaps even more so than when RNA is
folded. In this case, we expect that water molecules
have to disorder to some extent before ions can stabilize the folded state. Thus, in the folding of RNA
water molecules should exhibit rich dynamics.
The dynamics of nucleic acids spans far greater time
scales than proteins. Consequently, over a period of
time RNA samples a larger class of conformations with
ease because of the small stability gap [45] separating
the folded states and alternate structures. As a result
it is likely that RNA, even in the functional state, exhibits persistent heterogeneity or molecule-to-molecule
variations [57–59]. It is plausible that in conjunction
with ion dynamics, temporal scale spanned by water
in association with RNA also stretches out over many
orders of magnitude. If this were the case then discrete water molecules whose motions are coordinated
with RNA structural transitions might be involved in
function as well.
Structural motions lubricated by the discrete water
molecules associated with RNA are pivotal in facilitating molecular interactions with cosolvents as well
as with ligands or metabolites. Recently, we showed

that water molecules are critical for “inducing” the
base pair fluctuations, so that urea molecule can interact more easily with nucleobases [23]. In the absence of surface water, the urea concentration required
for denaturing nucleic acids rises to as high as 10 M
[60]. Similarly, dehydration of water around RNA due
to stabilizing osmolytes such as TMAO involves interplay of interactions between water and cosolvents [61].
These aspects are worthy of future investigations.

METHODS

All-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation:
We used the molecular dynamics package
NAMD [62] to perform atomically detailed simulations
for the 71-nt adenine riboswitch (PDB code: 1Y26)
[34] and 36-nt preQ1 riboswitch (PDB code: 2L1V)
[23] aptamers under CHARMM27 force field. For adenine riboswitch containing five bound Mg2+ ions, we
added 60 sodium ions by placing each ion around the
phosphate group of RNA backbone, to make the whole
system charge neutral. The system is then solvated using the SOLVATE program in the VMD package [63]
in an explicit TIP3P water solvent box. A buffer of
water are added around the molecule for at least 15
Å in all directions, resulting in total 63,632 atoms in
the system. PreQ1 riboswitch is solvated in a 60 Å ×
60 Å × 60 Å box containing 6267 TIP3P water. To
neutralize the charges on the phosphates and the two
Ca2+ -bound to the aptamer we placed 51 Na+ and 20
Cl− ions, which results in ∼ 150 mM salt concentration
in the bulk, randomly in the box. The resulting system was equilibrated as described elsewhere [23]. Nonbonded interactions are smoothly switched to zero between 10 and 12 Å yielding a cutoff radius of 12 Å.
The systems are periodically replicated. The particlemesh Ewald algorithm is used for treating long-range
electrostatic interactions with a grid spacing smaller
than 1 Å [64]. The integration time step is 2 fs with
the SHAKE method being used [65]. The energy of
the system is first minimized and gradually heated to
the desired temperature. We generated a 5−10 ns production run at each temperature under constant N , P ,
and T conditions.
Despite inaccuracies (especially for divalent cations
such as Mg2+ ) in the current force field for nucleic
acids [54, 66], our simulation and analysis on hydration dynamics show semi-quantitative agreements
with experimental measurements. Our conclusion on
water dynamics near RNA surface as well as at the
bulk still holds.

where ~xi is the position of i-th hydrogen atom, NH is

used to compute the MSD.

The function h(t) describes whether a HB is formed
between an atom in RNA and a water molecule at
time t. If a HB is formed, the value of h is 1, otherwise,
h = 0. The symbol h. . .i, which is explicitly written
in the second line, denotes a time average along the
trajectory and an ensemble average over the number
of HBs (N ) we are interested in. The correlation
function c(t) corresponds to the survival probability of the HB at time t, given that it is intact at time 0.

Correlation function to probe water

of water HB at the surface of RNA quantitatively, we
