We solve numerically a kinetic model of chiral polymerization in systems closed to matter and
energy flow, paying special emphasis to its ability to amplify the small initial enantiomeric excesses
due to the internal and unavoidable statistical fluctuations. The reaction steps are assumed to
be reversible, implying a thermodynamic constraint among some of the rate constants. Absolute
asymmetric synthesis is achieved in this scheme. The system can persist for long times in quasistationary chiral asymmetric states before racemizing. Strong inhibition leads to long-period chiral
oscillations in the enantiomeric excesses of the longest homopolymer chains. We also calculate the
entropy production σ per unit volume and show that σ increases to a peak value either before or in
the vicinity of the chiral symmetry breaking transition.

INTRODUCTION

There is a growing consensus that the homochirality of biological compounds is a condition associated to life that
should have emerged in the abiotic stages of evolution through processes of spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking
(SMSB). This could have proceeded in a prebiotic stage, incorporating steps of increasing complexity thus leading to
chemical systems and enantioselective chemical networks [1–3]. An important issue is therefore to identify processes
of chirality amplification in chemical reactions. In this regard, a recent kinetic analysis of the Frank model in closed
systems applied to the Soai reaction [4] has taught us that in an actual chemical scenario, reaction networks that
exhibit SMSB are very sensitive to chiral inductions owing to the presence of tiny initial enantiomeric excesses,
as previously shown theoretically [5]. The stochastic scenario implies the creation of chirality from intrinsic chiral
fluctuations and its later transmission and amplification. This can occur in far-from-equilibrium systems that undergo
dynamic phase transitions.
The process must be coupled to others which preserve, extend, and transmit the chirality. Biological homochirality
of living systems involves large macromolecules, therefore a central point is the relationship of the polymerization
process with the emergence of chirality. This hypothesis has inspired recent activity devoted to modeling efforts
aimed at understanding mirror symmetry breaking in polymerization of relevance to the origin of life. The models so
proposed [6–14] are by and large, elaborate extensions and generalizations of Frank’s original paradigmatic scheme
[15]. Heading this list, Sandars [6] introduced a detailed polymerization process plus the basic elements of enantiomeric
cross inhibition as well as a chiral feedback mechanism in which only the largest polymers formed can enhance the
production of the monomers from an achiral substrate. He treated basic numerical studies of symmetry breaking and
bifurcation properties of this model for various values of the number of repeat units N . All the subsequent models
cited here are variations on Sandars’ original theme. Soon afterwards, Brandenburg and coworkers [8] studied the
stability and conservation properties of a modified Sandars’ model and introduce a reduced N = 2 version including
the effects of chiral bias. In [7], they included spatial extent in this model to study the spread and propagation of chiral
domains as well as the influence of a backround turbulent advection velocity field. The model of Wattis and Coveney
[9] differs from Sandars’ in that they allow for polymers to grow to arbitrary lengths N and the chiral polymers of all
lengths, from the dimer and upwards, act catalytically in the breakdown of the achiral source into chiral monomers.
An analytic linear stability analysis of both the racemic and chiral solutions is carried out for the model’s large N
limit and various kinetic timescales are identified. The role of external white noise on Sandars-type polymerization
networks including spatial extent has been explored by Gleiser and coworkers: the N = 2 truncated model introduced
in [7] is subjected to external white noise in [10], chiral bias is considered in [11], high intensity and long duration noise
is considered in [12] and in [13], modified Sandars-type models with spatial extent and external noise are considered
both for finite and infinite N , with an emphasis paid to the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking. By contrast, Saito
and Hyuga’s [14] model gives rise to homochiral states but differs markedly from Sandars’ in that it does not invoke

the enantiomeric cross inhibition, allowing instead for reversibility in all the reaction steps. Their model requires
open flow, which is the needed element of irreversibility. A different model which stands apart from the above group
is that due to Plasson et al. [16]. They considered a recycled system based on reversible chemical reactions and open
only to energy flow and without any (auto)catalytic reactions. A source of constant external energy –the element of
irreversibility–is required to activate the monomers. This energy could be introduced into the system in a physical
form, say, as high energy photons. A system of this kind, limited to dimerizations, was shown to have nonracemic
stable final states for various ranges of the model parameter values and for total concentrations greater than a minimal
value.
The polymerization models referred to above are defined only for open flow systems which exchange matter and
energy with the exterior. A constant source of achiral precursor is usually assumed. An unrealistic consequence is
that homochiral chains can grow to infinite length. By contrast, most experimental procedures are carried out in
closed and spatially bounded reaction domains and are initiated in far-from equilibrium states [3, 17–24]. It is thus
crucial to have models compatible with these experimentally realistic boundary and initial conditions. The most
immediate consequences are that polymer chains can grow to a finite maximum length and that the total system
mass is constant. These two properties are of course intimately related. An original aspect of our work is that we
consider the polymerization process in a closed system and include reversible reactions. This enables us to explore
absolute asymmetric synthesis in thermodynamically closed systems (closed to matter flow) taking into account the
backward reaction steps, which we call here ”reversible reactions/reversible models” in spite of the fact that the
values of the forward and reverse rate constants can be very different. As we are eloquently reminded by Mislow,
mirror asymmetric states are in practice unavoidable on purely statistical grounds alone [25], even in the absence
of chiral physical forces. Absolute asymmetric synthesis is the ability of a system to amplify these statistical and
minuscule enantiomeric biases up to observably large excesses. Thus a major goal of this work is assess the ability of
such polymerization schemes to amplify these initial excesses, albeit if only temporarily. Asymmetric amplification is
demonstrated to occur obeying microscopic reversibility in a reversible model closed to matter flow. This is of great
practical interest as the racemization time scale can be substantially longer than that of the transformation of the
initial reagents, depending on the strength of the mutual inhibition, or direct interaction between the enantiomers.
And regarding chemical evolution, this obviates the need to invoke chiral physical fields and lends further support to
the conviction that homochirality is a “stereochemical imperative” of molecular evolution [26].
The behavior of entropy in polymerization models is rarely discussed [27], and has not been addressed for mirror
symmetry breaking in chiral polymerization. The entropy produced in a chemical reaction initiated out of equilibrium
gives a measure of the dissipation during the approach to final equilibrium. In this paper, we calculate the rate of
entropy production in chiral polymerization. Depending on the enantiomeric mutual inhibition, the entropy production
undergoes a rapid increase to a peak value either before, or else in the vicinity of the chiral symmetry breaking
transition, followed by an equally dramatic decrease. The system racemizes at time scales greater than that of
polymerization, and is accompanied by a final decrease of entropy production to zero, indicating that the system has
reached a final stable state (not to be confused with a stationary state, which must be accompanied by a nonzero
constant entropy production). Computation of the average length homopolymer indicates that the final racemic state
is dominated by the longest available chains.
II.

THE POLYMERIZATION MODEL

The model we introduce and study here is modified and extended from that of Wattis and Coveney [9] which
is in turn, a generalization of Sandar’s scheme [6]. Two salient differences that distinguish our model from these
and other previous ones [6–14] are that we (1) consider polymerization in closed systems [28]–, so that no matter
flow is permitted with an external environment– and (2) we allow for reversible reactions in all the steps. A third
difference is that we also include the formation (and dissociation) of the heterodimer. While heterodimer formation was
originally contemplated in [6], it has been silently omitted from all the subsequent models [7–13] that derive therefrom.
Fragmentation in a Sandars type model has been considered previously, but was shown to yield a maximum average
polymer length of only N = 3 repeat units [29].
We assume there is an achiral precursor S which can directly produce the chiral monomers L1 and R1 at a slow
rate ǫ as well as be consumed in processes in which homopolymers of all lengths catalyze the production of monomers.
The specific reaction scheme we study here is composed of the following steps, where the ǫ, (ǫ− ), k (k− ), etc., denote

represent a measure of the total concentrations of left-handed and right handed polymers. The amount of each chiral
monomer produced is influenced by the total amount of chiral oligomer already present in the system. We allow for
the monomers themselves to participate in these substrate reactions: hence N ≥ n ≥ 1, where N is the maximum
chain length. The central top and bottom reactions in Eq. (1) are enantioselective, whereas those on the right hand
side are non-enantioselective. The model therefore contains the features of limited enantioselectivity, first proposed
as an alternative to the mutual inhibition of Frank [1].
An important observation is that differences in the Gibbs free energy ∆G0 between initial and final states should
be the same in all the reactions listed in Eq.(1), which implies the thermodynamic constraint on the following forward

These upper limits for n specified in Eqs.(4,5) ensure that the maximum length for all oligomers produced (or
consumed) by these reaction sets, both the homo- and heterochiral ones, is never greater than N . In the remainder of
this paper we will consider here the natural and chiral symmetric rate assignments kaa = kbb , kab = kba and likewise

where kh = (kab + kba )/2 and kh− = (kab

)/2. Note that these latter two rate constants are automatically
determined from the above choice and that L1 R1 = R1 L1 of course. This completes the specification of the model’s
reactions.
The model is left-right symmetric, that is, possesses a discrete Z2 symmetry [30], which is manifest in the elementary
reaction steps, in the rate constants, and in the corresponding differential rate equations (see below). This symmetry
can be broken spontaneously by the dynamical solutions of the differential rate equations. This model is thus apt for
investigating spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. Though not considered here, the effects of explicit chiral bias
(e.g., that induced by external physical fields) can also be studied with this model by lifting the Z2 degeneracy in
the reaction rates, e.g., allowing for kaa 6= kbb , etc., leading to a maximum of eight independent rate constants for
describing the reaction set in Eqs. (4,5).
Rate-equation theory as employed in chemical kinetics is used to describe the differential rate equations of the
achiral source, the monomers, as well as the homo- and heterochiral oligomers belonging to this reaction network.

The kinetic equations for the concentrations that follow from these elementary steps are as follows. We begin with

ENTROPY PRODUCTION

The entropy production rate in an irreversible process is a measure of the dissipation in that process. At equilibrium,
the entropy production rate vanishes and is an extremum [32]. This production has been investigated recently for
reversible versions of the Frank model [33, 34]. In those simple models, the behavior of the entropy produced near the
chiral symmetry breaking transition as well as its subsequent temporal development, depends on whether the chemical
system is open or closed to matter flow. We will return to this important point below. Here we consider the behavior
of the entropy produced by polymerization reactions and monomer catalysis when the system undergoes a chiral phase
transition as well at the later stages when the system reaches final chemical equilibrium upon racemization.
For reactions obeying mass action kinetics, the entropy produced in any chemical reaction can be calculated straightforwardly in terms of the individual elementary reaction rates [32, 35]. The rate of entropy production is the sum
over the difference of the forward (Rjf ) and reverse (Rjr ) reaction rates multiplied by the natural logarithm of the
ratio of the forward and reverse rates [35]:

where the sum runs over each elementary reaction step j, and R∗ = 8.314 J mol−1 K−1 is the gas constant. Since
our reaction scheme is set up for closed systems, equilibrium is reached after a racemization time scale tracem is
reached, which suggests a further measure is provided by the total net entropy produced from the start of the
reactions through chiral symmetry breaking, then on to final racemization, when the system reaches chemical and
thermodynamic equilibrium and σ(t > tracem ) = 0

This quantifies the total dissipation over the complete history of the chemical transformations under study.
The sum in Eq.(18) contains 2N + 4 terms. In order to determine which specific steps of the full reaction network
provide the leading contributions to σ, we group the forward and reverse reaction rates as follows:

RESULTS

As discussed in the Introduction, we are interested in testing the model’s ability to amplify the initial small statistical
deviations about the idealized racemic composition [25], in systems closed to matter flow and taking microscopic
reversibility fully into account. In order to study the sensitivity of the above reversible polymerization network to
these minuscule initial enantiomeric excesses, a very dilute initial concentration of a scalemic (non racemic) mixture
was employed in the calculations: the initial monomeric concentrations of [L1 ]0 = (1 × 10−6 + 1 × 10−15 )M and
[R1 ]0 = 1 × 10−6 M yielding an initial chiral excess of ee0 = 5 × 10−8 %. This is actually slightly lower [25, 36]
than the excess corresponding to the initial monomer concentrations (ee0 = 6.1 × 10−8 %). The initial concentration
of the achiral substrate is [S]0 = 2M , whereas those corresponding the homo- hetero-oligomers are all set to zero:
[Ln ]0 = [Rn ]0 = 0, for 2 ≤ n ≤ N , [H]0 = 0, and [LRn ]0 = [RLn ]0 = 0 for 2 ≤ n ≤ N − 1. We choose ǫ = 2 × 10−5 ,

illustrative purposes, we consider chains that can grow to a maximum length of N = 12. This N value is intended
as a mean “ball-park” figure suggested by recent experiments yielding homochiral chains anywhere from N = 5 [18]
up to N = 18 [24] chiral repeat units, depending on the amino acids employed and the experimental conditions. The
differential rate equations Eqs. (7-16) were numerically integrated with the version 7 Mathematica program package
and using a level of numerical precision, typically twenty or more significant digits, to ensure the numerical significance
of these initial concentrations and enantiomeric excess. The results were monitored and verified to assure that total
system mass Eq. (17) remained constant in time.
Results are quantified in terms of a variety of convenient chiral measures. The percent enantiomeric excess values
of the oligomers with homochiral sequence are calculated according to (2 ≤ n ≤ N )

The importance of the enantiomeric excess is that it provides the order parameter for the symmetry breaking transition:
the |ee| ≥ 0 is zero for chiral symmetric states and nonzero otherwise. In the latter case, the Z2 symmetry is broken.

The angular brackets <> denote averaging with respect to the ensemble n ([Ln ] + [Rn ]), similar to Eq.(33). It is
important to remember that these are all time-dependent quantities.
Temporary but rather long lived asymmetric amplification can take place, as shown in Figure 1; note the logarithmic
time scale. The enantiomeric excess η averaged over all chain lengths Eq. (32), from the dimer on up to the maximum

7
length chain N = 12 starts off at zero value until a time on the order of t ∼ 10 at which the excess increases rapidly to
nearly 100% at SMSB. This is followed by a gradual stepwise decrease or chiral erosion characterized by the appearance
of quasi-plateaus of approximate constancy: η falls to about 90% at t ∼ 103 , then to about 60% at t ∼ 106 , staying
approximately level until the final decrease to zero occurring at a time on the order of t ∼ 1011 − 1012 . The system
has racemized on this time scale. No appreciable differences in η can be discerned when we include the monomer, that
is, start the sums at n = 1: we still observe slow chiral erosion proceeding though quasi-steady plateaus. The rate
of the entropy produced Eq. (18) exhibits an initial increase followed by a dramatic burst coinciding with the mirror
symmetry breaking transition. This production then decreases rapidly to an exceedingly tiny but non zero value
that remains constant during the entire period of slow chiral erosion, spanning more than ten orders of magnitude in
time. The entropy production then goes strictly to zero when the system racemizes in complete accord with the fact
that the system has reached chemical equilibrium. Although not displayed in Figure 1, the substrate concentration
falls from its initial value to zero approximately coincident with the peak structure of the entropy production, thus
suggesting a connection between the sharp production of the latter and the change in S. The total entropy produced
Eq.(19) is σT = 378.4 J mol−1 K−1 . We can identify the major contributions to the entropy production in this
process, see Figure 2, from calculations of the partial entropies. In this way we find that the leading contribution
comes from the monomer catalysis steps Eq.(1), followed by the polymerization itself Eq.(4), next by the mutual
inhibition reactions: heterodimer formation Eq.(6) and the “end-spoiled” cross-inhibition reactions Eq.(5). The least
important contribution comes from the direct production of monomers from the achiral substrate. The first three
partial contributions all display a peak structure in the neighborhood of the symmetry breaking transition, with the
corresponding peak values being displaced in time, see Figure 2. The exception to this is the entropy rate due to
direct monomer production, which decreases monotonically.

A finer or more detailed measure of the degree of symmetry breaking and amplification is provided by the individual
percent chain-length dependent enantiomeric excesses, Eq.(31). A remarkable and complex dynamic behavior is
revealed here. The time dependence of these n-dependent ee’s is plotted in Figure 3; note the logarithmic time scale.
The individual ee’s follow a common curve from initialization to chiral symmetry breaking, at about t ∼ 10, and remain
together at nearly 100% until about t ∼ 100 at which time the common curve begins to split up into its constituents.
Then, the percent chiral excess of each length homochiral chain behaves differently, until they again coalesce into a
single curve upon final racemization, occurring at around t ∼ 1011 . There is a common tendency for all the ee’s to
decrease at intermediate time scales, with the largest length chains (here, N = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) passing from positive
then to negative values of the excess. The N = 12, 11, 10 chains exhibit nearly −100% excess during the period
from 103 to 104 and beyond: there has been a chiral sign reversal in the excess corresponding to the largest chains.
This holds also for the monomer ee1 , plotted in the dashed curve. Except for the monomer, the individual excesses
then all increase back to positive values at t ∼ 106 , then from t ∼ 107 to t ∼ 1011 , the excess increases sequentially
as a function of the chain length n until racemization, where they all collapse to zero. The temporal behavior of
the enantiomeric excesses of the largest chains n = 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 is reminiscent of strongly damped oscillations.

constants as in Fig. 1.

This oscillatory behavior in the enantiomeric excess can be understood in terms of the evolution of the individual
concentrations of the longest chains. To illustrate this, we focus on the time dependence of the concentrations [L12 ]
and [R12 ], the corresponding ee experiences the largest amplitude damped oscillations, see Figure 4. For reference
the inset diagram shows the enantiomeric excess over the entire time interval of the simulation, compare to Figure 3.
As shown in Figure 4, the dominant concentration shifts back and forth between [L12 ] and [R12 ], respectively, until
racemization when both concentrations converge to a common value. This leads to the chiral oscillations depicted in
the inset. The shorter chains do not experience this oscillation, as illustrated for example by the concentrations [L5 ]
and [R5 ] plotted in Figure 5. There, the dominant concentration is always [L5 ], all the way from symmetry breaking
at t ∼ 10 to racemization, at approximately t & 1011 . The corresponding ee suffers a dip near t = 103 (see inset), due
to the concentration [R5 ] momentarily increasing at that time, see left hand graph of Figure 5. This dip becomes more
pronounced the longer the chain, see the sequence of curves around t ∼ 104 in Figure 3, and becomes a fully-fledged
damped chiral oscillation for the longest chains in the system.

time at around t = 103 when the curves intersect, and then turns over such that now R12 dominates the chiral excess, see right

two curves intersect again (compare to inset). Then from about 106 to 1011 the L12 chains again dominate the chiral excess
until racemization, when the two curves collapse to a common curve (anti-bifurcation). Same initial concentrations and rate

for the largest homochiral chains. The following graph, corresponding to t = 109 shows the monotone increase of
ee with chain length. Finally, the righthand most graph shows that racemization has set in by t = 1013 . These
should be contrasted with Figure 3. It is interesting to point out that both the qualitative behaviors depicted in
the second and third snapshot have been reported in two recent and independent polymerization experiments. The
tendency of the sign reversal in ee (from positive to negative values) as a function of chain length has been observed
in the polymerization of racemic valine (Val-NCA) and leucine (Leu-NCA)in water subject to chiral initiators [23].
By contrast, the monotonic increase of the percent ee with chain length has been measured in independent chiral
amplification experiments using leucine and glycine in water [18] starting with a 20% initial enantiomeric excess of
the L1 monomer. These static snapshots also raise the important question of when to observe the chiral amplification
and the enantiomeric excesses. In nonlinear reaction schemes such as this one, the enantiomeric excesses one measures

can depend strongly on when the measurement or observation is made, that is, when one decides to terminate the
experiment.
Additional information regarding the homo-oligomer composition of the chemical system is provided by the average
homochiral chain length < n >, see Eq.(33). We plot this in Figure 7 along with the standard deviation about
the mean, Eq. (34). The mean chain length starts off at 2, corresponding to the homodimer and then increases
monotonically after the symmetry breaking transition, reaching a constant plateau at t = 107 where it remains constant
all the way through to racemization and beyond. The final mean value < n >= 11.0. The corresponding root mean
square indicates that the fluctuations in the mean chain length increase as the mean chain length increases but then
drops down to a constant value (n2 )1/2 ∼ 1.4 when the average value stabilizes. This indicates that the final racemic
composition is dominated by the longer chains: nf inal = 11.0 ± 1.4. The racemization time scale depends on how
“irreversible” the model is. By way of example, if we increase the rate k− of the reverse catalysis steps in Eq.(1), keeping
everything else constant, then the increased recycling of monomers back into achiral precursor S lowers this time scale
as follows: (k− , tracem ) = (10−6 , 5 × 1012 s), (10−5 , 5 × 1011 s), (10−4 , 5 × 1010 s), (10−3 , 1 × 1010 s), (10−2 , 5 × 109 s). By
the same token, if we make k− smaller, we can postpone racemization.
The enantiomeric cross inhibition kab = kba is a determining factor in this model. By way of contrast, we consider
a second N = 12 run with a much lower mutual inhibition than employed above, namely kab = kba = 20, and with the

most interestingly, the entropy production now peaks well before the mirror symmetry is broken, see Figure 8. Figure

contributions are now formation of end-chain spoiled oligomers followed by the polymerization, exactly opposite to
the previous run employing the much higher mutual inhibition. The peak in σ is due principally to monomer catalysis,
and not symmetry breaking.
The time dependence of these n-dependent ee’s is plotted in Figure 10; note the logarithmic time scale. The
individual ee’s follow a common curve from initialization to chiral symmetry breaking, at about t ∼ 300, and remain
together at nearly 100% until about t ∼ 1000 at which time the common curve begins to split up into its component
parts. Note how the shorter homopolymers tend to racemize before the longer ones, there is a sequential chiral erosion
in the individual enantiomeric excesses that is more pronounced the shorter the chain length. This holds as well for
the monomer, plotted in the dashed curve (contrast to the monomer behavior in Fig. 3). Then, the percent excess of
each length homochiral chain behaves differently, until they again coalesce into a single curve upon final racemization,
occurring at around t ∼ 1014 . The final approach to racemization is qualitatively very similar to the case treated
above, compare the sequence in the right hand graph of Figure 10; to the sequence of curves in Figure 3 from roughly
t ∼ 107 to 1012 . A sequence of snap-shots of the een ’s at selected times is displayed in Figure 11.
Finally, we plot the average homochiral chain length < n >, see Eq. (33) in Figure 12 along with the standard
deviation. The mean chain length starts off at 2, corresponding to the homodimer and then increases monotonically
after the symmetry breaking transition, reaching a constant plateau at about t = 109 where it remains constant all

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated that a strong chiral amplification can take place in a reversible model of chiral polymerization
closed to matter flow and subject to constraints imposed by micro-reversibility. The inherent statistical fluctuations
about the idealized racemic composition are modeled by an initial minuscule enantiomeric excess in a system dilute
in the monomers. These results are important, because they suggest that spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking in
experimental chiral polymerization can take place, and with observable and large chiral excesses without the need to
introduce chiral initiators [24] or large initial chiral excesses [18]. Instead, the needed chiral monomers (i.e., amino
acids) can be produced directly from an achiral precursor and amplified via catalysis. Strong mutual inhibition is
required to amplify the initial ee to large values, very similar to what we found for the reversible Frank model in
closed systems [4]. The chain-length dependent enantiomeric excesses depend on time in a highly nontrivial way. The
essential rate constant is that corresponding to the enantiomeric inhibition. A most intriguing novel feature revealed
here for appreciable enantiomeric cross inhibition is the tendency for the chain length dependent enantiomeric excesses
to exhibit a damped oscillatory behavior before the onset of final racemization. In these conditions, the observed
chiral excess is clearly a time dependent phenomena, though the “period” of the chiral oscillations can be quite
long. Oscillatory dynamics in chemical reactions has been observed experimentally, and analyzed theoretically and

numerically in simple model systems [38, 39]; as far as we are aware, this behavior has not been revealed previously
as a valid dynamical solution in polymerization models. The implications for chirality transmission are far reaching:
“memory” of the sign of the initial chiral fluctuation is washed-out by the oscillations in the enantiomeric excess,
adding another heretofore unexpected element of randomness to the process. While the sign of the initial chiral
fluctuation is entirely random, any subsequent chiral oscillations can further “erase” the memory of the sign of this
initial enantiomeric excess. These oscillations cease as the system approaches its equilibrium state. Moderate values
leads to strong temporary symmetry breaking and larger values can lead to long period damped chiral oscillations
before final racemization takes over.
We have also shown that the rate of entropy production per unit volume exhibits a peak value either before or
near the vicinity of the chiral symmetry breaking transition. This increase to a peak value is mainly due to the
catalytic production of the chiral monomers, followed next by the stepwise polymerization reactions, and then by
the chain-end termination reactions and lastly, by the direct monomer production. The rate falls to a vanishingly
small but constant nonzero value maintained during the intermediate time scales, then drops to zero once the system
has racemized. Previous calculations of the entropy produced in chiral symmetry breaking transitions have been
carried out in the Frank model. In [33], σ was evaluated for a reversible open flow Frank model with a constant
inflow of achiral substrate and a constant outflow of the mutual inhibition product. In that situation, the entropy
production rises from small initial value and then levels off to a constant plateau after symmetry breaking. As the
open flow keeps this system far from equilibrium, it can never racemize, and entropy is produced at a constant rate, in
sempiternum. In [34], the rate of entropy production was evaluated for a reversible open flow Frank model including
limited enantioselectivity. Mirror symmetry is broken incompletely, and σ increases sharply from the start of the
reaction, remains at a constant level during the lifetime of the initial racemic state and then decreases to a new
stationary value once symmetry breaking sets in. These latter authors also consider the reversible Frank model with
constant concentration of substrate but freely varying inhibition product. The entropy production increases, a peak
value is reached when symmetry breaking is almost complete, then decreases to very small values. On the other hand,
for a reversible Frank model closed to matter flow, and with strong mutual inhibition, the rate of entropy production
exhibits a sharp peak at the onset of symmetry breaking, falling to a tiny positive value until the system racemizes,
at which time σ goes to zero [37]. This latter behavior is qualitatively similar to what we find in our polymerization
model for large inhibition.
For sake of computational simplicity, we have considered a model wherein no generally mixed heteropolymers were
formed, only the heterodimer LR = RL and LRn−1 and RLn−1 for 3 ≤ n ≤ N . The corresponding number of
differential equations grows linearly with the length N as 4N − 2 . A more realistic model should of course include the
formation of all the possible heteropolymers of a given length n, i.e., those heterochiral chains of length n containing
r ≥ 1 copies of L1 and s ≥ 1 copies of R1 such that r + s = n. It is possible to build such a system, for example,
starting with the copolymerization model of [40], where the concentration variables are denoted as cL

number of individual L and R’s making up the chain, respectively. The number of differential equations in this case
grows quadratically with polymer length N as N (N + 1), and is mathematically more involved. Detailed studies
employing a reversible copolymerization scheme in closed systems will be presented elsewhere [41].
