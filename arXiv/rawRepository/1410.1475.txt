Abstract. We analyze the effects of additive, spatially extended noise on spatiotemporal patterns in continuum neural fields. Our main focus is how fluctuations impact patterns when they
are weakly coupled to an external stimulus or another equivalent pattern. Showing the generality of
our approach, we study both propagating fronts and stationary bumps. Using a separation of time
scales, we represent the effects of noise in terms of a phase-shift of a pattern from its uniformly translating position at long time scales, and fluctuations in the pattern profile around its instantaneous
position at short time scales. In the case of a stimulus-locked front, we show that the phase-shift
satisfies a nonlinear Langevin equation (SDE) whose deterministic part has a unique stable fixed
point. Using a linear-noise approximation, we thus establish that wandering of the front about the
stimulus-locked state is given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Analogous results hold for
the relative phase-shift between a pair of mutually coupled fronts, provided that the coupling is
excitatory. On the other hand, if the mutual coupling is given by a Mexican hat function (difference
of exponentials), the linear-noise approximation breaks down due to the co-existence of stable and
unstable phase-locked states in the deterministic limit. Similarly, the stochastic motion of mutually
coupled bumps can be described by a system of nonlinearly coupled SDEs, which can be linearized
to yield a multivariate OU process. As in the case of fronts, large deviations can cause bumps to
temporarily decouple, leading to a phase-slip in the bump positions.

1. Introduction. Several previous studies have explored the impact of fluctuations on spatiotemporal patterns in neural field equations by including a perturbative
spatially extended noise term [5,19,21,26]. Utilizing small-noise expansions, it is then
possible to develop effective equations to describe the stochastic motion of spatiotemporal patterns that emerge in the noise-free system [30]. Typically, these effective
equations are linear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) [5, 22], although there
have been derivations of stochastic amplitude equations in the vicinity of bifurcations [19, 23] or nonlinear SDEs in spatially heterogeneous networks [21]. Here we
demonstrate methods for deriving nonlinear SDEs for the effective motion of patterns
in stochastic neural field equations, focusing on fronts and bumps in particular.

where u(x, t) represents neural population activity at position x ∈ Ω and time t, where
Ω is a one-dimensional domain such as R or the ring [−π, π]. The function F is a
nonlinear firing-rate function. Synaptic connectivity in the network is represented by
the function w(x − y), which describes the polarity (sign) and strength (amplitude)
of connection from location y to x. The stochastic forcing is assumed to be weak by
taking 0 < ǫ ≪ 1. Expressing R(x, t) in terms of a spatially extended Wiener process,
one can formulate the neural field equation as a stochastic integro-differential equation
on a suitable function space such as L2 (R). Suppose that the deterministic neural

field equation (ǫ = 0) supports a wave solution U0 (ξ) with ξ = x − ct and c the wave
speed (c ≡ 0 for stationary waves such as bumps [21]). Motivated by perturbation
methods for analyzing fronts in stochastic reaction-diffusion equations [2, 29, 30], we
used a separation of time-scales to decompose the effects of noise into (i) a slow,
diffusive-like displacement ∆(t) of the wave from its uniformly translating position,
and (ii) fast fluctuations in the wave profile. More explicitly,
√
u(x, t) = U0 (ξ − ∆(t)) + ǫΦ(ξ − ∆(t), t).
(1.2)
Substituting this decomposition into the neural field equation and carrying out an
asymptotic series expansion Φ = Φ0 + O(ǫ1/2 ), one finds that boundedness of Φ0
leads to a self-consistency condition for ∆(t), which takes the form of a stochastic
ODE. One thus establishes that ∆(t) undergoes Brownian motion. There have been
several subsequent developments of the theory, both in terms of applications and in
terms of more rigorous mathematical treatments. Bressloff and Weber have applied
these methods to study the effects of noise in binocular rivalry waves, showing that
wandering of the wave associated with perceptual switching is diffusive [32]. Second,
Kilpatrick and Ermentrout have analyzed the wandering of stationary pulses (bumps)
in stochastic neural fields [21], and Kilpatrick has shown how weak interlaminar coupling can regularize (reduce the variance) of stationary pulses and propagating waves
in a multi-layered, stochastic neural field [22, 23]. Regarding rigorous treatments,
Faugeras and Inglis [14] have addressed the issue of solutions and well-posedness in
stochastic neural fields by adapting results from SPDEs, whereas Kruger and Stannat [25] have developed a rigorous treatment of the multi-scale decomposition of
solutions.
One feature that has emerged in some applications of stochastic neural fields is
that the displacement variable ∆(t) can satisfy an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process
rather than pure Brownian motion. For example, this occurs in the case of stimuluslocked fronts [5] and in the regularization of waves in multi-layer networks, where ∆(t)
now represents the relative displacement of fronts in different layers [23]. However,
one assumption in the derivation of the OU process is that the displacement ∆(t)
is small. In this paper, we show that this assumption can break down and, in fact,
∆(t) evolves according to a nonlinear SDE. It turns out that in the aforementioned
applications, the deterministic part of the SDE has a unique stable fixed point, so
that one can carry out a linear-noise approximation and recover an OU process, but
with modified expressions for the drift term. More significantly, the nonlinear nature
of the SDE also raises the possibility of a breakdown in the linear-noise approximation
due to the coexistence of multiple phase-locked states.
Our results are organized as follows. In §2, we demonstrate how a nonlinear SDE
can be derived for the stochastic motion of a stimulus-locked front driven by additive
noise. The shape of the nonlinearity is determined by both the spatial profile of the
stimulus as well as the front profile. We extend our methods in §3 to derive a nonlinear
system of SDEs for the motion of two reciprocally coupled fronts in two separate layers,
rather than truncating to linear order as in [22]. While coupling tends to regularize
the propagation of fronts by pulling their positions close together, large deviations
in noise can decouple fronts leading to an instability in the case of lateral inhibitory
interlaminar coupling (§4). Lastly, we show in §5 that our analysis can be applied to
study wandering bumps in reciprocally coupled laminar neural fields. Similar to the
case of fronts, the nonlinear system of SDEs we derive can be used to predict the mean
waiting time until a large deviation wherein bumps become temporarily decoupled,
leading to a phase-slip.

It can be shown graphically that in the case of a sigmoid rate function, it is possible

decreasing function of ξ that crosses threshold at a unique point. We are free to take
the threshold crossing point to be at the origin, since equation (2.6) is equivariant
with respect to uniform translations. That is, U0 (0) = κ, so that U0 (ξ) < κ for ξ > 0
and U0 (ξ) > κ for ξ < 0. Taking F (u) = H(u − κ) in equation (2.8) then gives

In summary, for a Heaviside rate function and no external input there exists
a unique stable front solution of equation (2.6) whose wave speed c is an explicit
function of various physiological parameters such as the range of synaptic connections
and the firing threshold. Stability of the front can be established by constructing
the associated Evans function whose zeros determine the spectrum of the resulting
linear operator [7, 9, 33]. If one now includes an external stimulus in the form of a
step function of height I0 and speed v, one finds that the traveling front can lock
to the stimulus provided that v − c lies within a certain range that depends on I0 ,
where c is the natural wave speed in the absence of inputs [16]. Although it is not
possible to obtain explicit traveling wave solutions in the case of a smooth firing rate
function, it is possible to prove the existence of a unique front with or without an
external stimulus [11, 12]. In this paper, we develop our analysis of wandering fronts
in stochastic neural fields using a smooth sigmoid rate function F . However, we
illustrate the theory by taking the high-gain limit, since this yields explicit formulae
for the nonlinear Langevin equation describing wandering in the weak noise limit.

2.1. Stimulus-locking in the presence of noise. We want to determine from
equation (2.1) how the combination of a weak moving stimulus and weak additive
noise affects the propagation of the above traveling front solution in the small ǫ limit.
Suppose that the input is given by a positive, bounded, monotonically decreasing
function of amplitude I0 = I(−∞) − I(∞). From the theory of stimulus-locked fronts
in deterministic neural fields [16, 32], we expect that in the absence of noise, the
resulting inhomogeneous neural field equation can support a traveling front that locks
to the stimulus, provided that the stimulus speed v is sufficiently close to the natural
speed c of spontaneous fronts, that is,
√
v = c + ǫv1 .
On the other hand, following recent studies of wandering fronts [5, 32] and bumps
[21–23] in stochastic neural fields, we expect the additive noise term in equation
(2.1) to generate two distinct phenomena that occur on different time–scales: a slow
stochastic displacement of the front, and fast fluctuations in the front profile. Both
stimulus-locking and stochastic wandering can thus be captured by decomposing the
solution U (x, t) of equation (2.1) as a combination of a fixed wave profile U0 that is
b
displaced by an amount ∆(t)
= ∆(t) + (v − c)t from its uniformly translating mean
position ξ = x − ct, and a time–dependent fluctuation Φ in the front shape about the
instantaneous position of the front:

(2.15)

Here U0 is the front solution in the absence of inputs moving with natural speed c, see
b and Φ also
equation (2.9). (For ease of notation, we have suppressed the fact that ∆
depend on ǫ.) It is important to note that as it stands, the decomposition (2.15) is nonb and Φ. Hence, from a functional analytic
unique with regards the separate functions ∆
perspective, one has to impose an additional constraint involving, for example, the
b
difference kU (·, t) − U0 (· − ∆(t)k
with respect to an appropriate norm [25]. In the
b
case of the formal perturbation method developed below, we determine ∆(t)
uniquely
to leading order in ǫ by applying the Fredholm alternative, whereas the leading order
expression for Φ is non-unique. The same comments apply to the decompositions
carried out in subsequent sections.

writing Φ = Φ0 + ǫΦ1 + O(ǫ). Self-consistency of this asymptotic expansion will
then determine ∆(t). Substituting the series expansion for Φ into equation (2.16),

2 Note that the ǫ expansion of the Langevin equation (2.22) under the linear noise approximation
is distinct from the original ǫ expansion of the neural field equation. That is, the Langevin equation
is an exact self-consistency condition for the phase shift ∆(t) obtained by applying the Fredholm
alternative to the leading order terms in the ǫ expansion of the neural field equation, see equation
(2.17). The corresponding solution Φ0 of (2.17) is non-unique, since it can be shifted by A0 U0′ (ξ)
with A0 arbitrary. In order to determine A0 , it is necessary to consider the self-consistency condition
obtained by applying the Fredholm alternative to the O(ǫ) equation for Φ1 . However, this does not
modify the equation for ∆(t).

In particular, the variance approaches a constant ǫD/A in the large t limit and the
mean converges to the fixed point ξ0 .
In summary, it is necessary to modify the analysis of stimulus-locked fronts in [5]
by noting that ∆(t) actually evolves according to the nonlinear SDE (2.22) rather than
an OU process. In order to obtain an OU process one then has to model Gaussian-like
fluctuations about a stable fixed point ξ0 of the deterministic part using a linear-noise
approximation. This is reasonable provided that the deterministic equation does not
exhibit multistability, which holds for stimulus-locked fronts. One additional feature
of the nonlinear theory is that an explicit condition for the existence of a stimuluslocked front can be obtained in terms of the fixed point ξ0 .
2.2. Explicit results for Heaviside rate function. We now illustrate the
above analysis by taking F (u) = H(u − κ) so that the null vector V can be calculated

region yields a function I0 = I0 (v ∗ ) whose tangent in the limit I0 → 0 is given by the straight
line I0 = σ(v ∗ − c)σ/2(c + σ)2 ). (b) Corresponding existence region for c = −18.

It follows that for a given stimulus velocity there exists a unique stimulus-locked
front with shift ξ0 satisfying G(ξ0 ) = 0, that is,

Note that equation (2.34) is consistent with the non-perturbative result obtained

so the fixed point is stable. In Fig. 2.1(a) we plot an example of an existence region for
stimulus-locked fronts in the (v, I0 )-plane and c > 0. In the limit of small inputs the
tangent to the existence curve approaches the straight line obtained using perturbation
theory. An analogous calculation can be carried out for c < 0 - an example existence
region is shown in Fig. 2.1(b). The stationary variance about the fixed point takes
the explicit form

Hence, increasing the stimulus velocity reduces the variance. Note that the singularity
in the limit v → c reflects the fact that the stimulus-locked front becomes unstable.
3. Fronts in weakly-coupled stochastic neural fields. Another example of
wandering fronts exhibiting an OU process occurs in a laminar neural field model [23].
As in the previous example of stimulus-locked fronts, we will show that the noiseinduced wandering is described by a nonlinear SDE, and it is only by linearizing
about a stable fixed point of the SDE that one obtains an OU process. For the sake

mutually coupled via the interlaminar weight distributions J1 (x) and J2 (x):

Here W1 (x, t) and W2 (x, t) represent spatially extended Wiener processes such that
hdWj (x, t)i = 0,

hdWi (x, t)dWj (x′ , t′ )i = 2Cij (x − x′ )δ(t − t′ )dtdt′ .

(3.2)

Note that the interlaminar coupling is assumed to be weak and asymmetric (unless
J1 = J2 ). As with the intralaminar coupling, the distributions Jj (x) will be taken to
be positive exponentials:
Jj (x) = αj e−|x|/σj .

(3.3)

As shown by Kilpatrick [23], in the absence of noise, the interlaminar coupling phaselocks the fronts propagating in each of the two networks, resulting in a composite
front with fixed relative shift ξ0 . We wish to derive conditions for such locking and
determine how the presence of noise induces wandering of the composite front relative
to ξ0 .
3.1. Interlaminar coupling of fronts in the presence of noise. In the
absence of interlaminar coupling and noise (ǫ = 0), each neural field independently
supports a traveling front solution U0 (ξ) along the lines outlined in §2 with ξ = x − ct.
Since each neural field is homogeneous the threshold crossing point of each front is
arbitrary. Following our analysis of stimulus-locked fronts, we can simultaneously
investigate the effects of weak coupling and noise by considering the decompositions
Uj (x, t) = U0 (ξ − ∆j (t)) + ǫ1/2 Φj (ξ − ∆j (t), t), j = 1, 2
(3.4)
√
with Φj = Φj0 + ǫΦj1 + O(ǫ). Substituting into equations (3.1a) and (3.1b), Taylor
expanding the nonlinear function F , and imposing the homogeneous equation (2.10)
for U0 leads to the following equations for Φj0 :

It is clear that if we allow correlations between the noise in different layers, then the
diffusion matrix depends on the phase difference ∆1 − ∆2 , and the noise terms in the
SDE (3.6) are multiplicative. In order to avoid issues regarding the interpretation of
the noise in terms of Ito or Stratonovich, we will simplify the correlation matrix by
setting
Cij (ξ) = δij C(ξ).
It follows that Djk = δjk D with D given by equation (2.26).
11

In the original analysis of interlaminar neural fields [23], ∆ ≡ ∆1 −∆2 was assumed
to be small, and equations (3.5a) and (3.5b) were Taylor expanded to first-order in
∆, resulting in a multivariate OU process. However, as we found for stimulus-locked
fronts, ∆(t) is not necessarily small. Therefore, one should proceed by looking for a
stable fixed point of the ODE
d∆
= −ǫ1/2 G− (∆),
dt

(3.11)

which is obtained by subtracting the deterministic parts of the pair of equations (3.6)
and setting G± (∆) ≡ G1 (∆) ± G2 (−∆). Suppose that there exists a ξ0 for which
G− (ξ0 ) = 0 and G′− (ξ0 ) > 0. This represents a stable phase-locked state in the
absence of noise, with ξ0 the relative shift of the fronts in the two networks. One can
establish the existence of a unique phase-locked state using the properties of Gj (∆)
given by equation (3.7). Since the interlaminar coupling is taken to be excitatory,
Jj (ξ) > 0 for all ξ, and U0 (ξ) is a monotonically decreasing function of ξ, the following
properties hold:
(i) Gj (∆) < 0 for all ∆
(ii) Gj (∆) is a monotonically increasing function of ∆ with Gj (∆) → 0 as ∆ → ∞
and Gj (∆) → Gj as ∆ → −∞
(iii) The functions G1 (∆) and G2 (−∆) intersect at a unique point ∆ = ξ0 with the
sign of ξ0 determined by the relative strengths of J1 and J2 . By symmetry, if J1 = J2
then ξ0 = 0.
Given the stable fixed point ξ0 , one can now apply a linear-noise approximation
to the full SDE (3.6) and derive a multivariate OU process. Let
∆(t) = ξ0 + ǫ1/2 Y (t),

S(t) = ∆1 (t) + ∆2 (t)

and write
∆1 (t) =

Here S(t)/2 represents the “center-of-mass” coordinate. Equations (3.6) become

[dS(t) + dY (t)] + G1 (ξ0 + ǫ1/2 Y (t))dt = dW

(3.13a)

dY (t) + ǫ1/2 G′− (ξ0 )Y (t)dt = dW− (t),

(3.13b)

(3.12a)

We can now Taylor expand the nonlinear function G with respect to ǫ1/2 Y (t). Adding
and subtracting the above equations then yields the linear system of SDEs

where
c1 (t) ± W
c2 (t).
W± (t) = W

W± (t) are also independent Wiener processes with
hdWa (t)i = 0,

hdWa (t)dWb (t)i = 4Dδa,b dt,

a, b = ±.

Under the linear-noise approximation, fluctuations in the phase difference ∆(t) about
the fixed point ξ0 satisfy a one-dimensional OU process, which in turn drives fluctuations in the center-of-mass variable S(t). If ξ0 = 0, then we recover the results of
Kilpatrick [23].
It immediately follows that the mean and variance of Y (t) are given by the equations (cf. equation (2.28))

ǫA
(3.14)
with A = G′− (ξ0 ) ≡ G′1 (ξ0 ) − G′2 (ξ0 ) and Gj defined by equation (3.7). This implies
that in the limit t → ∞ the mean of the phase-shift ∆(t) converges to the√
deterministic
fixed point ξ0 and the variance about the fixed point converges to 2D ǫ/A. In the
case of S(t), equation (3.13a) can be integrated explicitly to give (with S(0) = 0)

Furthermore, in the presence of additive noise, fluctuations in the phase-shift are given
by an OU process, whereas fluctuations in the center-of-mass are given by Brownian
diffusion in the large-time limit.

σ1 = σ2 = 1. It can be seen that there exists a unique zero ξ0 for which G− (ξ0 ) = 0 and
G′ (ξ0 ) > 0. If the interlaminar weights are stronger (weaker) in the direction 2 → 1 then
ξ0 > 0 (ξ0 < 0). In the case of symmetric inter laminar connections we have ξ0 = 0.

3.2. Explicit results for Heaviside rate function. Since the uncoupled, deterministic neural field equations (ǫ = 0) are given by equation (2.6), the calculation
of the null vector V(ξ) and diffusivity D for the Heaviside rate function proceeds as in
§2.2. That is, V(ξ) = −H(ξ)e−ξ/c . Therefore, we only have to calculate the nonlinear
function Gj (∆) of equation (3.7). First note that

a unique zero ξ0 . In the case of symmetric weights (α = 0) we have ξ0 = 0, whereas
for 0 < α < 1 (1 < α) we find that ξ0 > 0 (ξ0 < 0). Recall that the stationary
variance about the phase-locked state is

ξ0 is fixed by fixed the degree of asymmetry α in the inter laminar connections.
However, G′− (ξ0 ) scales with α1 , which establishes that increasing the strength of
interlaminar coupling can reduce the variance, as previously highlighted by Kilpatrick
[23]. Upon considering weight spatial scale σ = σj = 1, symmetric connectivity
α = 1, and cosine noise correlations C(ξ) = cos(ξ) then D is given by (2.32), ξ0 = 0,

We compare the formula (3.21) to numerical simulations in Fig. 3.2, demonstrating
how the variance decreases with α1 as well as the threshold κ.
4. Breakdown of linear-noise approximation. So far we have considered
examples of stochastic phase-locked fronts, in which there is a unique, stable phaselocked state in the deterministic limit. This allowed us to carry out a linear-noise
approximation and thus show that fluctuations about the phase-locked state can be
characterized in terms of an OU process. Here we consider an example where the
linear-noise approximation breaks down due to the existence of an additional unstable
phase-locked state in the absence of noise. We again consider a pair of coupled neural
fields given by equations (3.1a) and (3.1b), but now take the interlaminar coupling to
be given by a difference of exponentials: J1 = J2 = J with
h
i
J(x) = α1 e−|x| − βe−|x|/γ , 0 ≤ β < 1, γ > 1.
(4.1)
15

This distribution represents short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. For
the sake of illustration, we assume that the interlaminar coupling is symmetric. The
analysis of stochastic phase-locking proceeds along identical lines to §3, and we obtain
the nonlinear SDE (3.6). In the absence of noise, the phase-difference ∆(t) evolves
according to equation (3.11) with G− (∆) = G(∆) − G(−∆) and

In Fig. 4.1, we plot G− (∆) for various values of β with σ = c = 1 and γ = 4. It can
be seen that for a range of β values, there exist three fixed points, a stable fixed point
at ∆ = 0 and a pair of unstable fixed points at ∆ = ±ξ1 (β). Note, the lower bound
value of β at which the unstable fixed points emerge is where

or where β = γ −1 . For sufficiently large β (strong mutual inhibition), the system
undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation, resulting in a single unstable phase-locked state.
This occurs when G′− (0) = 0, equivalently at
β = βpitch :=

γ(c + 1)

(4.5)

Let us focus on the regime where the stable phase-locked state at zero coexists
with a pair of unstable states. If we now carry out a linear-noise approximation
about the stable state, then the resulting OU process will capture the Gaussian-like
fluctuations within the basin of attraction of the phase-locked state on intermediate
time-scales. However, on longer time-scales, large fluctuations (rare events) can lead
to an escape from the basin of attraction due to ∆(t) crossing one of the unstable fixed
points ±ξ1 . Destabilization of the noise-free system is illustrated in Fig. 4.2. Noiseinduced escape from the stable state (as in Fig. 4.3A) cannot be captured using
the linear-noise approximation. The full SDE for ∆(t) is obtained by subtracting
equations (3.6a) and (3.6b), which yields
d∆(t) = −G− (∆)dt +

a pair of unstable fixed points at ∆ = ±ξ0 (β).

the basin of attraction of the zero state is given by the interval (−ξ1 , ξ1 ). For small
but finite µ, fluctuations can induce rare transitions out of the basin of attraction due
to a metastable trajectory crossing one of the points ±ξ1 . Assume that the stochastic
system is initially at ∆0 = 0. In order to solve the first passage time problem for escape
from the basin of attraction of the zero fixed point, we impose absorbing boundary
conditions at ±ξ1 , that is, we set p(±ξ1 , t) = 0. Let T (∆) denote the (stochastic)
first passage time for which the system first reaches one of the points ±ξ1 , given that
it started at ∆ ∈ (−ξ1 , ξ1 ). The distribution of first passage times is related to the

Fig. 4.2. Decoupling of fronts in the case of laterally inhibitory connectivity in (3.1a 3.1b) with no noise. (A) For a symmetric network, starting the front positions ∆1 and ∆2
within the basin of attraction of the coupled state (∆1 (0) − ∆2 (0) = 3) leads to long term
coupling: limt→∞ |∆1 (t) − ∆2 (t)| = limt→∞ |∆(t)| = 0. (B) Starting front positions ∆1 and
∆2 outside the basin of attraction of the coupled state (∆1 (0) − ∆2 (0) = 4) leads to long term
decoupling: limt→∞ |∆1 (t) − ∆2 (t)| = limt→∞ |∆(t)| = ∞. Threshold κ = 0.4 so c = 0.25;
no noise (W1 = W2 ≡ 0); coupling parameters are ǫ = 0.005, α = 1, β = 0.4, γ = 4.
This results in the unstable fixed point (separatrix) occurring at ∆ = ∆1 − ∆2 ≈ 3.78. In all
figures, the pink (blue) curve represents the leading edge of the front (trajectory of threshold
crossing point) for j = 1 (j = 2).

The first passage time density can thus be interpreted as the total probability flux
leaving the basin of attraction through the absorbing boundaries.
Using standard analysis, one can show that the mean first passage time (MFPT)
τ (∆) = hT i satisfies the backwards equation [18, 31]

This is identical to the formula for the MFPT for escape from the interval [0, ξ1 )
starting at ∆ = 0 with a reflecting boundary at ∆ = 0 and an absorbing boundary
at ∆ = ξ1 . We compare our theory for the mean first passage time hT i = τ (0) to
numerical simulations for symmetric lateral inhibitory connectivity (4.1) and cosine
noise correlations so D satisfies (2.32), showing in Fig. 4.3 that the marginal rare
event statistic is captured for low enough values of coupling strength α1 . However,
as expected, our theory breaks down as the coupling strength α1 is increased. Our
perturbation analysis is built upon the assumption of weak coupling between layers,
so the reduced system will be a poorer characterization of the full integrodifferential
system’s dynamics for stronger coupling. For example, our reduced system does not
account for the reshaping of the front profile by the interlaminar coupling, which
likely impacts the waiting time until front decoupling. Fronts’ shapes may be altered
in ways such that there are multiple crossings of the the firing rate threshold κ, and
capturing this feature would require a more detailed reduced system.
Using steepest descents, one can now derive the classical Arrhenius formula [18]

The above analysis provides another example where knowledge of the nonlinear
nature of the phase-shift dynamics is crucial for determining the effects of noise.
In §2 and §3, the nonlinearity determined the unique phase-locked state ξ0 about
which we could carry out a linear-noise approximation. Here, the explicit form of the
nonlinearity is required in order to determine the rate of escape from a (meta)stable
phase-locked state that coexists with a pair of unstable states. Note that, as expected,
the mean escape time is exponentially large in the weak noise limit µ → 0, since
U (ξ1 ) > U (0).
5. Bumps in weakly-coupled stochastic neural fields. Kilpatrick has previously shown that interlaminar coupling can reduce the long term diffusion of bumps in
stochastic neural fields [22,24]. Effective equations for the stochastic motion of bumps
derived in this work tended to be linear SDEs, such as OU processes. However, in [21]
it was shown how the impact of spatial heterogeneities can be accounted for by a nonlinear SDE that incorporates the effective potential bestowed by the heterogeneity.
20

Here, we extend this previous work as well as our analysis of coupled fronts by considering nonlinear contributions to the effective dynamics of bumps coupled in laminar
neural fields. We focus on a pair of identical neural fields on the ring x ∈ (−π, π],
labeled j = 1, 2 and mutually coupled by interlaminar weight distributions J1 (x) and
J2 (x):

The spatially extended Wiener processes W1 (x, t) and W2 (x, t) are defined on x ∈

hdWj (x, t)i = 0,

hdWi (x, t)dWj (x′ , t)i = 2C(x − x′ )δi,j δ(t − t′ )dtdt′ .

(5.2)

Coupling within a layer w(x−y) is assumed to be an even function of lateral inhibitory
type [1, 9, 21]. For comparison with numerical simulations, we assume intralaminar
coupling
w(x) = cos(x)

(5.3)

and interlaminar coupling Jj (x) may be asymmetric
Jj (x) = αj cos(x),

(5.4)

and we will allow αj to be negative or positive. We will also set the timescale τ = 1.
In the absence of interlaminar coupling and noise (ǫ = 0), it can be shown that
each neural field independently supports a stationary pulse solution (bump), which
satisfies the equation
Z π
U0 (x) =
w(x − y)F (U0 (y))dy
(5.5)
−π

(see [21] for details). Each neural field is translationally symmetric, so each bump
U0 (x) is centered at an arbitrary location in the neural field. The nonlinear effects
of noise and weak coupling upon the position of the bumps can then be analyzed
along identical lines to that of traveling fronts in §3, after setting c = 0 and taking
x ∈ [−π, π] rather than x ∈ R. In particular, writing
Uj (x, t) = U0 (x − ∆j (t)) + ǫ1/2 Φj (x − ∆j (t), t),

j = 1, 2,

(5.6)

we find that the displacements ∆j (t) satisfy the Langevin equation (3.6) with V(x)

for any function A(x) ∈ L2 ([−π, π]) and U0 a bump solution. (The integrals in
equations (3.7), (3.8) and (3.10) are now taken with respect to the circle rather than
the real line.) Continuing along identical lines to §3, we can show that the phase
difference ∆(t) = ∆1 (t) − ∆2 (t) evolves according to equation (3.11). Hence, a stable
phase locked state ∆(t) = x0 will satisfy G− (x0 ) = 0 and G′ (x0 ) > 0. Finally, carrying
out a linear noise approximation establishes that fluctuations about the phase-locked
state are given by an OU process, whereas fluctuations in the center-of-mass are
given by Brownian diffusion in the large-time limit, as was previously found in [22].

Fig. 5.1. A The variance in the phase difference h∆2 i (note the mean h∆i ≡ 0) saturates in the limit t → ∞. Variance is computed as a function of time using numerical
simulations (dashed line) and asymptotic theory (solid line) predicts the saturation value
(5.20). Threshold κ = 0.5; interlaminar connectivity strength α1 = α2 = 1; noise amplitude
ǫ = 0.01. B The stationary variance decreases as a function of interlaminar connectivity
strength α1 = α2 in numerical simulations (circles) and theory (solid line). Other parameters are as in A. Variances are computed using 5000 realizations each.

Moreover, noting that
Z π

−π

(5.16)

and taking cosine interlaminar connectivity (5.4), we have Gj (∆) = αj sin ∆, so that
G± (∆) = (α1 ∓ α2 ) sin ∆.

(5.17)

A related result was derived in [21], demonstrating that weak nonlinear spatial heterogeneities can be inherited by the underlying dynamics of stochastically moving bumps
in single layer neural fields. Hence, w can immediately identify the two fixed points
¯ = 0, π. Their stability is easily computed
on ∆ ∈ (−π, π], where G− (∆) ≡ 0 at ∆
λ0 ≡ −G′− (0) = −(α1 + α2 ),
λπ ≡ −G′− (π) = (α1 + α2 ),

(5.18)
(5.19)

so if α1 + α2 > 0, x0 = 0 (x1 = π) is stable (unstable), and if α1 + α2 < 0, x1 = 0
(x0 = π) is unstable (stable). Thus, for locally inhibitory connectivity, the bumps’
positions can be driven apart (x0 = π) so they are anti-phase relative to one another.
Either way, we can compute the stationary variance about the phase-locked state

Thus, we recover the result from [22], showing the strength of interlaminar coupling
reduces variance in stochastic bump motion. We demonstrate in Fig. 5.1 that the
variance in the phase difference is well approximated by (5.20) as compared with
numerical simulations.
5.2. Noise-induced phase slips. As in the case of fronts, noise not only causes
the center-of-mass of both bumps to wander diffusively, it can also lead to rare events,
23

where the bumps temporarily become uncoupled. Typically, noise will perturb the
phase-difference ∆(t), while the local dynamics of the stable fixed point will pull the
phase difference back to x0 . However, on longer time-scales, large fluctuations can
lead to ∆(t) crossing the separatrix given by the unstable fixed point x1 . These events
cannot be captured by a linear noise approximation. Note, a similar observation was
made by Kilpatrick and Ermentrout in [21] in a single layer network with periodic
spatial heterogeneity in the weight function.
The nonlinear SDE describing the stochastic motion of the phase-difference ∆(t)
is given by equation (4.6). Let p(∆, t) be the probability density of the stochastic
process ∆(t) given initial condition ∆(0) = ∆0 . The corresponding Fokker-Planck
(FP) equation takes the form

where
J(∆, t) = −

and p(∆, 0) = δ(∆ − ∆0 ). As in the case of fronts, we suppose that the deterministic
˙ = −G− (∆) has a stable fixed point at ∆ = 0 and a pair of unstable
equation ∆
fixed points at ∆ = ±x1 . Thus the basin of attraction of the zero state is given by
the interval (−x1 , x1 ). For small but finite µ, fluctuations can induce rare transitions
where trajectories cross through one of the unstable separatrices ±x1 . To solve the
first passage time problem for these phase-slips, starting with ∆(0) = 0, we impose
absorbing boundary conditions at ±x1 , that is, we set p(±x1 , t) = 0. Let T (∆) denote
the (stochastic) first passage time for which the system first reaches one of the points
±x1 , given that it started at ∆ ∈ (−x1 , x1 ). As in the case of fronts, one can show
that the mean first passage time (MFPT) τ (0) = hT (0)i is given by the formula

6. Discussion. In this paper we have explored the impact of stimuli and coupling on the stochastic motion of patterns in neural field equations. Our main advance
is to demonstrate nonlinear contributions to the effective stochastic equations for the
position of wandering patterns. In order to achieve this, we have assumed that the
25

stimuli or the coupling between multiple layers of a neural field are weak, namely
having comparable amplitude to the spatiotemporal noise term that forces the system. Then, utilizing a small noise and small coupling expansion, we have derived
nonlinear Langevin equations whose effective potentials are shaped by the spatial
profile of coupling. This allows us to approximate the statistics of rare events, such
as large deviations whereby waves become decoupled from one another, analogous to
the well-hopping of bumps observed in spatially heterogeneous neural fields [21]. Such
stochastic dynamics would not be captured by a linear system of SDEs.
As with all perturbation methods, our results are dependent on the particular
choice of scaling with respect to ǫ. We have chosen the scaling of the external inputs,
noise amplitudes and interlaminar coupling so that all the terms contribute to the
amplitude equation obtained by applying the Fredholm alternative. If one changed
the scaling then one or more of these contributions would disappear at this level of
perturbation theory. Unfortunately, not enough is known biologically to determine
the “correct” scaling. However, there are biological reasons for treating these various
contributions as weak (see the review [7]). First, neural systems tend to adapt to
constant stimuli and amplify weak fluctuations about a constant background via recurrent connections (weak external inputs). Second, there are long-range connections
within cortex that play a modulatory role in neuronal firing patterns (weak interlaminar connections). Third, although individual cortical neurons tend to be noisy, at
the population level fluctuations tend to be relatively weak (weak noise).
In §3–§5 we considered a pair of one-dimensional (1D) neural fields that are homogeneous when ǫ = 0 (no interlaminar coupling nor external noise). This means that
each unperturbed neural field supports a 1D pattern (front, bump) with a marginally
stable degree of freedom (also known as a Goldstone mode), which reflects the underlying translation symmetry. The incorporation of weak interlaminar coupling and noise
breaks the translation symmetry of each neural field, resulting in a pair of nonlinear
Langevin equation for the positions of the two patterns. Carrying out a linear noise
approximation of the dynamics in the neighborhood of a phase-locked state shows that
the center-of-mass (CoM) of the two patterns exhibits Brownian dynamics, whereas
the separation of the two patterns satisfies an OU process. A natural generalization
of our analysis is to consider N neural fields. There are now N Goldstone modes
when ǫ = 0, arising from the fact that each neural field is equivariant with respect to
local uniform shifts. Introduction of weak pair-wise interlaminar coupling and noise
would result in N coupled Langevin equations, specifying the individual positions of
the N coupled patterns. Again, under a linear noise approximation, we expect the
CoM of the N patterns to exhibit Brownian dynamics, whereas the N − 1 remaining
degrees of freedom satisfy an OU process as shown in [22]. The existence of Brownian
dynamics is a consequence of the fact that in the presence of interlaminar coupling
but no noise, the N Goldstone modes reduce to a single Goldstone mode representing
translation symmetry with respect to a global shift of all the fields. Addition of a
weak external input to one of the neural fields would break this remaining symmetry,
and the CoM could phase-lock to the stimulus. Under a linear noise approximation,
the CoM would now satisfy an OU process.
Another obvious extension of our theory would be to consider two-dimensional
(2D) neural fields, reflecting the laminar-like structure of cerebral cortex [28]. For
example, one could extend the theory of radially symmetric bumps developed in
Ref. [15] to the case of multi-layer neural fields. In this case each neural field has two
marginally stable modes when ǫ = 0, corresponding to translation symmetry in the
26

plane. One could also consider the stochastic motion of more intricate spatiotemporal
patterns such as spiral waves, which occur when some form of slow adaptation is
included [27]. In particular, the methods developed here could be employed to study
how noise shapes the angular velocity and tip location of spiral waves coupled to
external stimuli or other patterns. Finally, our approach might be utilized to study
stochastic switching in neural field models of binocular rivalry [6,20]. Since switching
is brought about by a combination of adaptation as well as fluctuations, multiple
timescale methods could be combined with our small noise approximation to calculate
the distribution of switching times [3]. More generally, it would be interesting to
develop a large deviation theory for phase-locked patterns in stochastic neural fields,
see for example Kuehn and Riedler [13].
