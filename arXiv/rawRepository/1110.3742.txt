Abstract. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins is involved in regulating cellular fate activities such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Their fundamental
importance has attracted considerable attention on different aspects of the MAPK signaling dynamics; this is particularly true for the Erk/Mek system, which has become the canonical example
for MAPK signaling systems. Erk exists in many different isoforms, of which the most widely
studied are Erk1 and Erk2. Until recently, these two kinases were considered equivalent as they
differ only subtly at the sequence level; however, these isoforms exhibit radically different trafficking between cytoplasm and nucleus. Here we use spatially resolved data on Erk1/2 to develop
and analyze spatio-temporal models of these cascades; and we discuss how sensitivity analysis can
be used to discriminate between mechanisms. We are especially interested in understanding why
two such similar proteins should co-exist in the same organism, as their functional roles appear to
be different. Our models elucidate some of the factors governing the interplay between processes
and the Erk1/2 localization in different cellular compartments, including competition between isoforms. This methodology is applicable to a wide range of systems, such as activation cascades,
where translocation of species occurs via signal pathways. Furthermore, our work may motivate
additional emphasis for considering potentially different roles for isoforms that differ subtly at the
sequence level.

Introduction
Cellular decision making processes require balanced and nuanced responses to environmental,
physiological and developmental signals. Especially in eukaryotes this involves the interplay and
concerted action of a number of molecular players, that receive external signals, broadcast them
further into the cytoplasm, and, if a transcriptional response is called for, shuttle into the nucleus
and activate the transcriptional machinery. The mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) are
important relays in many of these signal transduction processes. They are, for example, involved
in regulating cellular fates such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [1]. The most widely
studied MAPK, Erk1/2, is activated through phosphorylation by Mek, its MAPK kinase (MAPKK),
and Mek in turn is activated by its cognate kinase; ultimately, the activator of the cascade of MAPK
kinases is an initiator signal, such as Ras (MAPKK kinase). Activated kinases, such Erk or Mek,
are deactivated via dephosphorylation by their respective phosphatases.
In the active state Erk can shuttle into the nucleus where it can induce the relevant cellular
responses. But continuous nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of Mek/Erk has been demonstrated even
in the absence of activation [2, 3, 4, 5]. Mek is believed to play a central role in the shuttling
mechanism of Erk using its nuclear export sequence; however, due to its nuclear exclusion sequence,
Mek is found mostly in the cytoplasm whereas Erk can accumulate in the nucleus [5, 4].

The two distinct isoforms of Erk, Erk1 and Erk2, appear to have distinctly different biological characteristics. Transgenic gene knockout mice lacking Erk2 (Erk2−/− ) result in embryonic
lethality, whereas Erk1−/− are viable, fecund and suffer from only subtle deficiencies, e.g., reduced
T cell development [6, 7]. Erk2 can compensate in Erk1 deficient mice through as yet unclear
mechanisms. Although Erk1/2 share approximately 85% of the same amino acid sequence, both
activated by Mek, and considered to behave similarly, shuttling of Erk1 from cytoplasm to nucleus
is approximately three times slower than that of Erk2, regardless of whether the cell is starved
or stimulated [8, 5]. The rate of shuttling results from differences in the N-terminal domain of
Erk1 and Erk2 [9]. In addition to different trafficking speeds, Erk1 is approximately four times less
abundant than Erk2 in NIH 3T3 cells [10]. It is also believed that competition exists between Erk
isoforms in binding to Mek [11].
Activation cascades have been studied extensively, but given that experimental results often
rely on incomplete or indirect observations of the underlying dynamics, and in light of sometimes
partially contradictory experimental results, mathematical models have become increasingly important for understanding these cascades. Published models of activation cascades, such as MAPK,
typically use a three tier structure, where the top tier is activated by a single phosphorylation,
and the remaining two tiers are activated via double phosphorylation cycles. This structure can
incorporate positive feedback loops and the most widely studied model by Huang and Ferrell predicted ultrasensitivity in the MAPK signal [12, 13, 14]. Their work initiated the development of
several alternative MAPK cascade models, which exhibit cell switching [15, 16, 17] and provide
conditions for bistability (e.g., via double phosphorylation through a distributive mechanism [18]
or MAPKK sequestration [19]). Subsequent models have also included inhibition by the doubly
phosphorylated MAPK onto the initial signal Ras, either directly or implicitly between cycles, via
a negative-feedback loop. These models predicted sustained oscillations [20, 21], which were then
verified by further modeling and experimental work [22]. Additionally, other studies have found
that parameter regions affect the dynamical behavior of the system which may yield multi-stability
or oscillations [23, 24, 25]. Although many models resemble the form of the Huang–Ferrell model,
many authors have explored the cascade in a linear manner [26, 27, 28] in order to study the effects
of cascade length, signal transduction and adaptation, in the presence of MAPK specific feedback
structures.
Shuttling may play a role in the activation/deactivation activity of Mek/Erk in both the nucleus
and cytoplasm, which has motivated the recent development of spatio-temporal models [29, 24,
22, 30, 31]. A compartment model of MAPK using single phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
loops [29] was extended to include double phosphorylation of kinases and phosphatases which
dephosphorylate the kinases [22]. Models have also been developed to study the differences between
Erk isoforms [32, 5, 24]. A tiered MAPK model with Erk1, Erk2, Mek and upstream species of the
MAPK cascade was developed identifying that Erk isoforms cross-regulate each other and may be
linked to cell fate decisions [32]. Another model focused on Erk1 dimerization using data from Erk1
wild type and the Erk1-∆4 mutant (unable to dimerize) and improved the nuclear transport model
of [29] by exploring different methods of phosphorylation [24]. Finally, a simple model including
only Erk1 and Erk2 species was constructed to study the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling speeds [5].
The existence of two genetically nearly identical isoforms of Erk is hard to explain, especially
in light of the above results. Here we seek to understand potential dynamical reasons for the
existence of the Erk1 and Erk2 isoforms. To do so we have to consider their interactions with Mek
and nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling, which appear to be important in Mek/Erk mediated cellular
decision making processes. We integrate these different processes into a single model and compare it
to recent spatio-temporally resolved data and consider and contrast the behavior in two cell types,
HeLa and NIH 3T3, and under different conditions. We find that shuttling, i.e., hitherto often
ignored spatial aspects, exert great influence over the cellular response phenotypes and are able to
2

provide a rationale for the existence of different Erk isoforms. Furthermore, our model supports
the recently posed hypothesis [11] of the importance of competition between the Erk isoforms.
This study also lays the ground work for understanding a complex system in the biological
sciences by developing an appropriate abstractions; in this case, through the development and
analysis of a minimal model. In addition, these approaches are suitable in contexts where transport
and/or different roles of molecules are unclear.
Materials and Methods
A spatio-temporal model of Erk signalling. A reaction network of the spatio-temporal model
is built around three species: Erk1, Erk2, and Mek are allowed to exist in different activation states,
as complexes and in different cellular compartments (see Fig. 1A and find equations in Supplementary Material). We assume Erk isoforms (Erk1/Erk2) exist in one of three states: inactive (Erk),
bound to Mek (M-Erk), or active (Erkp). Erk transitions from inactive to active through Mek
whereby free phosphorylated Mek (Mek) reversibly interacts with inactive Erk. Upon Mek-Erk
binding and formation of an intermediary complex (M-Erk), Mek phosphorylates Erk resulting
in activated Erk (Erkp) and then dissociates from Erkp. In order for Erkp to revert back to its
inactive form, it must undergo dephosphorylation by a phosphatase. To denote the subcellular
compartment of Erk, species are denoted by a subscript n to indicate nuclear localization, i.e.,
Erk1n is Erk1 in the nuclear compartment. The biochemical reactions of the full system are given
in Table 1 with a description in Table 3. Shuttling rates of Erk in HeLa cells have previously been
established; however, to determine the shuttling of Erk species in NIH 3T3 cells, we performed
FRAP experiments, as shown in Fig. 2, and these data enabled us to estimate transport rates.
Cell culture and transfection. NIH 3T3 cells were plated on glass disks cultured in modified
Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and were transfected using Lipofectamine (GenePORTER 2, Genlantis, San Diego, CA). To inactivate the ERK pathway, cells were
starved by keeping them in 1% FBS for 24 h before imaging. Further details and the design of the
ERK-GFP fusion proteins are found in [5, 8].
FRAP measure of nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling. Photo bleaching was preceded by the acquisition of a pre-bleach image that was used to estimate the loss of fluorescence due to bleaching and
for data normalization. The nucleus of the cell was photobleached by repeated scans of the nucleus
at high laser power. Bleaching was applied for approximately 8 s, which was sufficient to quench
most of the nuclear fluorescence. Bleaching was followed by time-lapse acquisition to measure the
recovery. Fluorescence was normalized by
FTot FNuc (f )
·
F (t) =
FNuc FTot (t)
where FTot indicates the fluorescence (corrected for background) measured before bleaching in the
entire cell and FNuc indicates the same measure in the nucleus. This normalization corrects for
bleaching caused by imaging. All imaging experiments were performed on a Olympus Fluoview 300
and Leica SL confocal microscopes.
Model parameterization. We focus our analysis on HeLA cells and mouse NIH 3T3 cells. Phosphorylation, shuttling rates and initial conditions have previously been specified for HeLa cells
[29, 33] whereas shuttling rates here have been measured in mouse NIH 3T3 cells [5, 8]. We use the
kinetic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation parameters for an initial estimate for Erk2 from the
compartment model of Erk2 in HeLa cells using a single phosphorylation loop [29]. Erk1 phosphorylation was assumed to occur slightly faster than Erk2 in primary erytheroid progenitor (CFU-E)
cells [32] and we adjusted the baseline parameter values for the complete model accordingly (Table 1).

Figure 1. Model construction. (a) Schematic of full Erk/Mek shuttling model. Inactive Erk
can bind to Mek to form the M-Erk complex. Mek phosphorylates Erk into Erkp, then Mek
dissociates and Erkp can be dephosphorylated to Erk. This behavior is symmetric for both Erk1
and Erk2 isoforms. These reactions (solid arrows) can occur in either the cytoplasm (yellow region)
or nucleus (orange region) and all model species (gray boxes) can shuttle between compartments
(dashed arrows). (b) Time course of nuclear Erk1pn and Erk2pn that reaches steady-state for

(Mek = 0.2). (iii) Time course at equal Erk1/2 (Erk1 = Erk2 = 0.5).

Both HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells are 15-20 microns in diameter and have approximately the same
volume. The import and export shuttling rates of species between the cytoplasm and nucleus include
the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear volume as used in other compartment models [29, 22, 24]. We
use the Erk2 shuttling rates in HeLa cells from [29] and then calibrated the shuttling rates to satisfy
that Erk1 shuttles three times slower than Erk2 as seen in Fig. 2 and [5]. In starved cells there is
no phosphorylation by Mek and primarily inactive Erk is shuttled; stimulated cells, on the other
hand, (which have Mek/Erk activation) shuttle predominantly phosphorylated (Erkp) species. The
shuttling time constants (τ ) were calculated by first photobleaching the nucleus and then measuring
the recovery of fluorescence of Erk in NIH 3T3 cells (see [5, 8] for more details and Supplementary

Figure 2. Measure of the nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking of Erk-GFP in living cells. a) Imaging of
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with Erk2-GFP. Trafficking rates have been measured by analyzing
the speed of recovery of fluorescence after bleaching of the nucleus (red dots in the first image): the
faster is the recovery the higher is the rate of trafficking. Nuclear fluorescence was bleached at time
0 and the time lapse sequence shows its recovery. Cells were starved in 1% fetal bovine serum for 24
hrs before performing the experiment. After compete recovery the cell were stimulated with 10%
serum and, after allowing 15 min for maximal Erk activation, a second bleach-recovery sequence
was acquired. The calibration bar is 10 microns. b) Time course of the fluorescence recovery
acquired for the illustrated cell before (red) and after activation of the Erk pathway (green). The
continuous lines are fitting exponentials of time constants 152 and 49 s respectively. c) Erk1 and
Erk2 have different trafficking rates: The four exponentials indicate the normalized time course of
the fluorescence recovery for Erk1 (dotted lines) and Erk2 (continuous lines) in the starved condition

30-60 cells in each condition (5).

0.1 − 3 µM [29]. In HeLa cells, the ratio of Mek to Erk at the initial conditions is approximately
1.46 [33, 29]. We do not include inactive Mek in this model and we estimate that the ratio of active
phosphorylated Mek to total Erk is one. Since Erk in previous models had been assumed to be
approximately 1 µM [33, 29] we assume the relation total (phosphorylated) Mek ≈ total Erk1 +
total Erk2, and the baseline initial concentrations of Erk also satisfy the condition that Erk1 is
four times less abundant than Erk2 in NIH 3T3 cells [10]. We also take into account that HeLa
cells may have a different ratio of Erk1/Erk2 or different concentrations of active Mek either due to
initial activation of the MAPK cascade or Mek sequestration effects, etc., than the baseline initial
conditions as given in Table 4.
Steady-state analysis. We investigate the behavior of the system for the relevant baseline parameters and find that only one permissible and biologically relevant steady-state exists. Further
exploration of the parameter space of the models using latin-hypercube sampling [34] confirms that
there is only one biologically permissible steady-state across the biophysically plausible parameter
space. This finding of the minimal model is in line with previous studies that looked into the
classification of single and double phosphorylation cycle networks in terms of whether they yield
multistability [35].
Sensitivity analysis. To study the effects of the parameter values on the dynamics of Erk1pn
and Erk2pn , we performed a detailed and comprehensive sensitivity analysis. We used a standard

method based on the Fisher information [36], which assesses the change in system output as parameters are varied. Suppose that we are interested in the values Erk1pn (t) and Erk2pn (t), denoting

As the trajectories x· (t) are given by solutions of ordinary differential equations their derivatives
∂x· (t)
∂ki can be easily calculated [37]. We have used this type of sensitivity coefficients as they have a
clear information geometric interpretation as the infinitesimal distance in the state space, behave
locally as the Kullback-Leibler divergence [38], and allow us to determine directions of trajectories
change resulting from parameters changes. Treating the initial conditions as parameters provides
us with their sensitivities in an equally simple way [36].
Results
Assuming a constant stimulus, as is the case for our experimental set-up, we simulate the model
equations (see (Tables 1-4) for details) until steady-state. The time course of active nuclear Erk is
given in Fig. 1a, and total nuclear Erk1 and total nuclear Erk2 abundances are shown in Fig. S1a
in the Supplementary Material. We take into account cell variability by studying the behavior
at different initial concentrations of Erk and Mek within the known constraints; activation of the
system is determined by the initial condition of active Mek. Mek then activates Erk, which can
then traffic in and out of the nucleus; we are therefore interested in both the transient activation
time (time until a species reaches steady-state) and the realised steady-state values of Erk1pn and
Erk2pn (phopho-nuclear Erk isoforms). We consider the realistic scenario of a smaller stimulus
activating the system and take this into account by decreasing the initial level of activated Mek,
which decreases the steady-state values of Erkp (Fig. 1b)).
The overarching question is really why do nearly identical Erk 1/2 isoforms exist? In particular we
seek to address this question by considering two related questions in more detail: (1) How does the
behavior of these isoforms differ in different cell-types and under different physiological conditions?
(2) How does nuclear shuttling differ between the two isoforms and how does this affect the overall
nuclear activity levels of Erk? More generally, we develop a flexible mechanistic description of
Erk mediated signaling that includes the nuclear translocation dynamics. This framework can
be adapted to other molecules, e.g., NFAT, Stat3/5 [39] etc where we have distinct biochemical
isoforms with different nuclear shuttling dynamics.
Minimal model. To address the above questions, the behavior of Erk isoforms under varying physical conditions is more closely studied in the absence of transport (Fig. 3a). Sensitivity analyses identify Erk1p and Erk2p concentrations as most sensitive to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (k6 /k11 ) rates of Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the initial conditions
also show that the available phosphorylated Mek increases in importance at lower signal strength
(limited Mek) (Fig. 3b,c), which in an experimental context, is what we expect. The percentage
of Mek that is usually phosphorylated depends on signal strength and this enzyme would greatly
affect the steady state of Erkp. The balance between phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rates and
initial conditions provides a setting for a competition scheme between Erk isoforms for its activator
Mek; furthermore, available evidence shows that there is a close match between Mek and Erk1/2
concentrations.
We investigate the effects of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rates on the relative abundances of Erk2p to Erk1p at baseline Mek and limited Mek conditions. By defining a log-scale
indicator


Erk2p
,
ϕ = log
Erk1p
the sign of ϕ signifies the dominance of a specific phopho-Erk isoforms as physical conditions are
changed. For example, given that the value of ϕ identifies the change of phospho-Erk isoforms
by orders of magnitude, a value of one indicates ten times more Erk2p than Erk1p whereas a
negative value of −1 establishes there is ten times more Erk1p than Erk2p at steady state. The
phosphorylation rates and dephosphorylation rates are each varied separately from 10−3 to 101 in

line with biophysical considerations and ϕ is evaluated (Fig. 4a,b). As the rate of phosphorylation
of Erk1 increases, values of ϕ become negative indicating dominance by Erk1p (see bottom right
corner of Figs. 4a (ii)), whereas an increase in the Erk2 phosphorylation rate demonstrates Erk2
prevalence. The effect of the phosphorylation rate on ϕ is asymmetric, meaning that there is a larger
parameter space of values giving rise to Erk2p dominance (see non-overlapping curves in Fig. 4a
(i)). Notably, the competition is exacerbated under limited Mek conditions where the maximum/
minimum values of ϕ are larger and smaller, respectively than the baseline conditions. Inspection
of the dephosphorylation rates shows that an increase in dephosphorylation rate of Erk1 results
in a larger positive ϕ, or an Erk2p steady-state bias, and vice versa for Erk2 dephosphorylation.
This is also reflected in the heat map representation which reveals an asymmetry, with a bias
towards Erk2p, which is more easily activated than Erk1p. This is also apparent in the time course
(Fig. 4b (i)) where equality between Erk1p and Erk2p steady state values exists for low Erk1
dephosphorlation rate, but not for low Erk2 dephosphorylation in Fig. 4b (i). Under limited Mek
conditions, both Erk1p and Erk2p steady-state values are much smaller and activation time increases
(Fig. 4a,b (iv)). Moreover, for limited Mek conditions, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
rate parameter space has a larger region for possible competition scenarios (see largest (white) and

Figure 4. Competition in minimal model at baseline and limited Mek (Mek=0.2) conditions.
Competition scenarios are studied using heat maps (middle columns) and a time course (outside
columns) of steady state. Heat maps (ii-iii) of parameter /initial condition values are given along
the horizontal axis (j) and vertical axis (k) are varied and the associated color at each (j, k)parameter/initial condition correspond to ϕ = log(Erk2p/Erk1p) where a positive value denotes
more Erk2p than Erk1p and a negative value indicates more Erk1p than Erk2p. Solid circle and
open circle in heat map are shown in time course of Erk1p (blue) and Erk2p (red) in (i, iv) where
a solid circle corresponds to a solid line and an open circle corresponds to a dotted line. (a) Effects
of phosphorylation rates on Erk1/2p. Values of (k2 , k6 ) are varied, solid circle (solid line) is high
k2 = 0.6, low k6 = 0.1 and open circle (dotted line) is low k2 = 0.1, high k6 = 0.6. (b) Effects of

and it gives the expected result that as total Erk1 in the system increases, the total Erk1p also
increases (Fig. 4c). Unlike the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cases, however, the ϕ indicator
10

value at a given total (Erk1, Erk2) point does not change as Mek becomes limited (heat map
indicator colors are nearly identical).
The minimal model provides a number of insights, specifically that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
rates play an important role in the steady-state behavior of Erk1p and Erk2p, whereas under limited Mek conditions, the parameter rate space suggests there is a stronger effect (larger |ϕ|) on the
response. The value of the initial conditions can induce a Erk2p or Erk1p dominated response and
limited Mek alters the steady-state value of this response. More generally, this model provides a
simple framework for gaining insight into the components which control the competition between
Erk1 and Erk2 for its kinase Mek, and we provide a indicator ϕ for giving Erk1p or Erk2p cell
response.
Complete system. The minimal model provides preliminary insights into the behavior of Mek
and Erk isoforms. Even though the analysis of the minimal model is useful, further analysis of the
complete system must be performed to acquire information about the role of translocation between
the two cellular compartments (cytoplasm and nucleus).
As shown in Fig. 5a, the equilibration dynamics and the steady state of Erk1pn and Erk2pn in
HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells are most sensitive to the import shuttling rates of Erk1p, Erk2p, and
M-Erk2 (s4 , s7 , s3 ); and the only sensitive biochemical reaction rate is the dephosphorylation rate
of Erk2pn (k12 ). The primary difference between the cell types is the sensitivity of Erk isoform
shuttling speeds. Specifically, HeLa cells are more sensitive to Erk2p import shuttling whereas NIH
3T3 cells are more responsive to changes in Erk1p. Overall, both cell types are quantitatively most
sensitive to the shuttling of Erk2. This analysis also highlights the similarities and differences in
sensitivity between initial conditions of the minimal model and the complete system (Fig. 5b). The
intermediary complex of Mek-Erk2 are sensitive in both models and the nuclear complexes are also
sensitive. The drastic difference in steady state concentrations between the two cell conditions (limited Mek and baseline) that was observed in the minimal model does not transpire in the complete
model. As shown in Fig. 5a,b, the sensitivity index of the most important parameters are nearly
100 times those of the initial conditions. Investigating the stimulus-response curve reveals that
unlike the minimal model Mek(0) = 1 does not saturate Erk2pn and requires a stronger stimulus
(compare Fig. 3c and Fig. 5c). The sensitivity analysis was repeated for limited Mek conditions,
which did not present any difference in the importance of parameters or initial conditions.
Given the importance of the shuttling rates on Erk1pn and Erk2pn concentrations, we investigate
the response of HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells to different conditions affecting shuttling. For both cell
types, we find that increasing the Erk1p shuttling rates (Fig. 6a), Erk2p shuttling rates (Fig. 6b),
and Mek shuttling (Fig. 6c) by an order of magnitude increases the steady-state and the activation
time. While the sensitivity analysis suggests that NIH 3T3 cells are more sensitive to Erk1p
shuttling, the differences between Fig. 6a (i-ii) are slight. In NIH 3T3 cells, the activation time of
Erk1pn is shorter and the steady state is slightly larger. As shown in Fig. 6a,b, Erk1p shuttling rates
only affect Erk1pn shuttling and Erk2p shuttling only affect Erk2pn steady state. By increasing
and decreasing the Erk2p shuttling rates, we find a quantitatively larger difference in steady state
value of Erk2pn . This difference confirms why Erk2p shuttling is most important in the complete
system. By examining the effects of Mek shuttling on Erk1/2pn steady states, it is clear that Erk2pn
responds more than Erk1pn both in activation time and steady state value. While it is well known
that Mek has a nuclear exclusion sequence that exports it from the nucleus, studies have suggested
that Mek may play an active role in transport of Erk [40, 41]. Our findings that the shuttling of
Mek is less sensitive than Erk1p/Erk2p, yet result in the same effect on steady state and activation
time (compare Fig. 6b and Fig. 6c) is somewhat counterintuitive. Evidence suggests that the
Mek mediated contribution to Erk export is at most marginal under physiological conditions, only
contributing to the steady-state in unphosphorylated conditions [8]. This may be due to the very
11

low rate supported by the CRM1 mediated export. Despite the numerous studies to understand
the role Mek plays in regulating Erk, our analysis gives a juxtaposition: Mek shuttling sensitivity
is relatively small compared to Erk1p/Erk2p shuttling sensitivity while simulations predict that
Mek and Erk shuttling have the same effect on activated nuclear Erk.
The effects of dephosphorylation on phospho-nuclear Erk steady-states is more pronounced than
the effect of phosphorylation rates. By varying the dephosphorylation rates of Erk2 (k12 =
1.4 × 10−1 baseline) a decrease by an order of magnitude remarkably affects the steady state
value of Erk2pn . Increasing the dephosphorylation rate more than four-fold (k12 = 6 × 10−1 )
decreases the steady state approximately half of the baseline; however the potential for increasing
the activation time and steady state value by changing the dephosphorylation confirm the findings
from the minimal model. By studying the effects of phosphorylation rates on the steady-state values, the phosphorylation rates do not exhibit a notable change in either activation or steady-state,
which is a significant difference between the minimal and complete models.
The complete system is consistent with the main finding that the shuttling rates of phosphorylated Erk affect the steady-state values of Erk1pn and Erk2pn (Fig. 5a). The sensitivity analysis
for HeLa cells suggests it is more sensitive to Erk2p shuttling whereas NIH 3T3 cells are more
sensitive to Erk1p shuttling; however our simulations do not show remarkable differences between
the two cell types. We also observe that both cell types are responsive to Mek shuttling speeds
although Mek shuttling parameters are not overly sensitive in analysis, which may explain the
ongoing investigations of the role of Mek shuttling on Erk.
Discussion. Our analysis suggests that transport of Erk is most important for determining activity levels. Competition between Erk1 and Erk2 for Mek is induced as biochemical rates and
total concentrations of Erk and Mek change; our minimal model and analysis may also offer an
explanation of why the Mek–Erk stochiometry is close to one. Finally, analysis of the complete
model highlights the unexpected result that as Mek shuttling rates are less sensitive in analysis,
the simulation of the solution curves provides the same effects as varying the Erk2p shuttling rate.
The differences between cell types are also illuminating: since the shuttling rates are the most
sensitive parameter one may be led to think that differences in trafficking are at the basis for
heterogeneity. There are two additional points that we feel are pertinent in this context: (1) the
composition and amount of nucleoporins changes during the cell cycle, which bring about changes
in trafficking rates and in levels of Erk activation; (2) in neuronal cells, where trafficking rates
are maximally different between Erk1 and Erk2 (unpublished data), we may expect enhanced
difference between Erk1 and Erk2 activation levels. This is notable (it is certainly enthralling
from a neurobiological point of view) since the only clear phenotype of the Erk1 knockout is
neurophysiological. Although beyond the scope of this study, considering changes in transient
changes in Erk isoform concentration as well as exploring the effects of downstream substrates may
pin down the physiological implication of the shuttling mechanisms discussed here.
In response to a given stimulus the different activation times are mostly due, not to differences
in the phospho-dephospho rates, but to differences in shuttling speed. The FRAP experiments
show that there is a large variability in trafficking speed, likely due to the variable density of
nucleoporins, and this could go a long way towards justifying the different kinetics. In view of
the large individual differences between cells, this seems to be interesting and hitherto neglected
aspects of studies of cell-to-cell variability. Through the development of these abstractions and
sensitivity analysis as performed might help to understand what are the most likely parameters
responsible for the heterogeneous responses within a cell population.
More generally, our results highlight the important aspect of spatial localization of specific isoforms that has hitherto often been neglected in models and experiments. Similarly to MAPK studies, NFAT has been found to have different behavior based on stimuli duration (sustained, pulsed

Note, continuous shuttling is dependent on Mek activation [8]; therefore, we assume that Mek
activation is sustained in the system such that total active Mek is constant,
MekT = Mek + Mekn + M-Erk1 + M-Erk1n + M-Erk2 + M-Erk2n .
Since this study only focusses on the short timescales of Erk1 and Erk2 activation and not ensuing
gene expression processes, we assume that total Erk1 and Erk2 are also constant and satisfy the
conservation relations,
Erk1T = [Erk1] + [Erk1n ] + [Erk1p] + [Erk1pn ] + [M-Erk1] + [M-Erk1n ] ,
Erk2T = [Erk2] + [Erk2n ] + [Erk2p] + [Erk2pn ] + [M-Erk2] + [M-Erk2n ] ,
where Erk1T and Erk2T are total Erk1 and Erk2, respectively.
The reactions of the minimal model are given in Table 1 and the relevant reactions are identified
by only cytoplasmic reactions, corresponding to the first seven differential equations in the full
model system, except the terms with a coefficient of sj are disregarded. Thus the model in Eqs. 1−7

Estimation of transport parameters and initial conditions. Before photobleaching, the cells
are assumed to be in equilibrium and that influx and efflux of the Erk species are equal. After
bleaching, the flux continues in and out of the cell, and fluorescence is measured. We introduce two
equations to describe the bleached nuclear Erk species (FnB ) and recovered fluorescence of nuclear
Erk species (Fn ):
d[FnB ]
d[Fn ]
= −s−j FnB and
= α − s−j Fn
dt
dt
where s−j is the rate at which bleached species leaves the nucleus and α is the rate at which
n]
unbleached, fluorescent species enters the nucleus. At equilibrium ( d[F
= 0 = α − s−j [Fn ]),
dt
fn = [Fn ] ,
we have [Fn ] = α/s−j . As before, we normalize by the steady-state of Fn (α/s−j ): F
α/s−j
α f
fn = 1, and dFfn = s−j − s−j F
fn . Then the solution is
Fn , so at equilibrium F
giving [Fn ] = s−j
dt
fn = 1 − e−t·s−j . If at t = τ , and F ∗ is the measured fluorescence (F
fn = F ∗ ), then F ∗ = 1 − e−τ ·s−j
F
ln(1−F ∗ )
and the nuclear export rate is given by s−j = −
. Here, the F ∗ is the recovered fluorescence
τ

at the time constant τ . In NIH 3T3 cells we have for starved Erk1 τ = 653s, stimulated Erk1p
τ = 266s, starved Erk2 τ = 178s, and stimulated Erk2p τ = 84s when F ∗ ≈ 0.75 normalized
fluorescence [5]. Given that the sizes of HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells are similar (the ratio of molecules
in cytoplasm/nucleus is 1.5 ± 0.2 for Erk and 1.1 ± 0.72 for Erkp) the import rates (sj ) can be
estimated as export rate divided by the molecular number ratio, as calculated by [29]. Without the
shuttling rates of Mek for NIH 3T3 cells, we assume the values as calculated by [29] for HeLa cells.
Initial conditions of the transport model are the same as the full model. The initial conditions of
the biochemical model follow the normalization such that Erk1(0)=1, Erk2(0)=1 and Mek(0)=1,
and the total concentrations of Erk1 (Erk1T ) and Erk2 (Erk2T ) are set to maintain that Erk2 is
four times more abundant than Erk1.
