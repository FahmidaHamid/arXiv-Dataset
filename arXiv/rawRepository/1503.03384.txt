Abstract
Aedes aegypti is known as the responsible vector in transmitting
dengue flavivirus. Unavailability of medication to cure the transmission in human blood becomes a global health issue in recent decades.
World epidemiologists are encouraged to focus on inves- tigation toward an effective and inexpensive way to prevent dengue transmission,
i.e. mosquito control. In this paper, we present a model depicting the
dynamics of mosquito population based on indoor?outdoor life cycle classification. The basic mosquito offspring number is obtained
and analysis of equilibria is shown. We bring along a discussion on
application of optimal control model which engineers two simultaneous schemes. The first scheme is done by disseminating chemical like
Temephos in spots where eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the second scheme is done by conducting fumigation through areas where
adult mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as well as outdoor. A version of gradient-based method is presented to set down a workflow
in minimizing the objective functional with respect to control variable. Numerical results from analysis of the basic mosquito offspring
number with constant control and from optimal control suggest that

1

one has to enhance the usage of fumigation rather than Temephos. It
is also suggested that applying both control schemes simultaneously
gives the most significant reduction to the population.
Keywords: mosquito population dynamics; mosquito reduction management; the basic mosquito offspring number; optimal control.

Introduction

It is known that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes be the primary transmitters of
dengue fever in the world [2]. This species were predominantly tropical
species and confined to coastal areas. Now they are widespread inland and
cause deadly morbidities by means of dengue fever in mostly Southeast Asia,
Africa, USA, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Caribbean Islands, China, India,
Japan, Portugal, etc [19, 9]. The areas where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes most
probably prevalent in which have tremendous threat of dengue outbreaks are
densely urbanized areas [3, 4]. Several studies confirmed that eradicating
mosquito population had constricted the area of dengue endemicity throughout the globe, beside it helped to bring down the cost as regards a high
number of surveillance. Even vector control has been considerably inexpensive, a government tendency to take out of concern the funding to attempt
it continuously leads to a necessity of a more efficient and effective control
management. In order the mosquito population to be precisely managed, one
needs to model the dynamics of such population and further to investigate
effectivity of a control scheme which is acted to it.
Aedes aegypti belongs to species which inhabit in domestic water containers: bath vessels, flowerpots, drums, tins, unused tyres, untreated swimming
pools, or even in curved broads where it is possible for water to last on for
long time [14]. Both male and female adult mosquitoes feed on nectar. Only
females require additional blood sources to obtain nutrients before producing
eggs and during eggs maturation. Note that a single female can lay down at
one time about 100–200 immersing eggs in water [6]. Potential eggs can be
produced by Aedes aegypti females up to five batches during their lifetime.
An egg needs 2–5 days to maturate its living embryo, depending on water
temperature [13, 17]. In an advanced growth, each egg turns to a larva which
posteriorly withstands for 5–10 days depending on water temperature and
air humidity [11]. This living larva usually eats algae and microorganisms in
2

water surface, making each individual competes with its owns for logistics.
A discussion on competitions amongst larvae can become important after
the fact that in a joint container, Aedes albopictus larvae outcompete Aedes
aegypti larvae, thus the winners develop at a faster rate [1]. In the prescribed
range of lifetime, each larva undergoes four times skin exfoliation and turns
to a pupa at the very end of the processes. An idle pupa needs to wait for
1–5 days before it metamorphoses into an adult [16]. In addition, the living
adult can generally survive for 10 days, or in some extreme cases for 2–4
weeks [23].
Tabachnick et al. [20] found three polytypic origins where Aedes aegypti
breeds: domestic (urban housing including its narrowing environment), sylvan (rural areas, some cases in tree holes and leaf axils), and peridomestic
(artificial plantation areas such as coconut groves and farms). In general,
separation of the origins as indoor and outdoor had also been highlighted.
In [12], the authors notified that the number of Aedes aegypti differed based
on indoor-outdoor classification and heterogeneity of containers. A brief corresponding result showed that Aedes aegypti species constituted as the most
abundant in indoor containers compared to the other tested species. Some
reference also mentioned that in indoor containers, competition amongst larvae had not always been the case since a particular tendency made Aedes
aegypti grew more than Aedes albopictus [5].
By a basic idea of incorporating control measures to a mathematical
model of mosquito population dynamics, several control schemes were tested
toward fighting the spread of Aedes aegypti. We highlight, for instances,
utilization of ultra-low-volume (ULV) insecticide [15] also combined with
Temephos dissemination [22] and the sterile insect technique (SIT) [7, 18,
21, 10] as a Genetic-based Vector Control (GVC). However, in this paper we
do not take the epidemiology of mosquito population or infection exposures
amongst individuals into account. Therefore, a susceptible-infected segregation is no longer in use. We accentuate a model of mosquito population
dynamics based on indoor-outdoor life cycle classification and introduction
of control intervention as well as investigation to the best strategy for reducing the population with cost as cheap as possible. As control devices, we
highlight utilization of Temephos (mainly used to kill larvae) and fumigation
(used to kill adults by blocking respiration process) after the fact that they
have already been well-known schemes in an integrated mosquito eradication
programme.
We organize the rest of the paper as the following. In Section 2, we set
up a mathematical model for depicting the dynamics of multi-age-segregated
mosquito population based on indoor-outdoor life cycle classification. We
add two control measures to the system in order to check how the popu3

lation trajectories response to such control. In Section 3, we examine the
biological meaningfulness of the model based on positivity of the system’s
solution and existence and stability of equilibria. So far we use plausible
constant value for the control. In Section 4, we discuss the optimal control
model which generates a time-variant control solving the proposed optimization problem. In seeking an optimal solution, we first use the so-called indirect method to generate state-adjoint-gradient systems of equations and
then utilize a gradient-based method to solve the generated systems in an
algorithmic workflow. As the rest of the paper, in Section 5, we do numerical
tests for bringing forward some visualizations of the model.

The mathematical model

To capture the dynamics of mosquito population, let us first classify the
population based on age-segregation: egg E, larva L and adult A. We outconcern the dynamics of pupa by our assumption that there will be no deaths
and imbalance in- and outflow occurring amongst pupae, since then the population of pupa remains constant. Based on indoor-outdoor classification,
the eggs and larvae differ from indoor E1 , L1 and outdoor E2 , L2 . No more
segregation for the adults since every individual can fly to wherever it prevalents, indoor as well as outdoor. We introduce the control measures u1 and
u2 denoting the impact rate of utilization of Temephos dissemination and
fumigation respectively. Let [0, T ] be the range of observation time t and
x = (E1 , E2 , L1 , L2 , A)⊤ ∈ L2 ([0, T ], IR5 ) be the state variable. Our model is
preliminarily exhibited by the following equation
ẋ(t) = f(x(t), u(t)),

x(0) = x0  0.

(1)

We assume that adult mosquitoes will select indoor breeding sites with
the probability p and, therefore, select outdoor breeding sites with the probability 1 − p. Alongside with introduction of the tendency-based probability,
we denote µ as the corresponding rate of the adults to lay eggs. It is assumed that natural deaths can occur in all classes, thus we denote η{1,··· ,5} as
the corresponding rates. In average periods, both indoor and outdoor eggs
metamorphose into corresponding larvae with the transition rates α{1,2} . The
same situations hold for respectively indoor and outdoor larvae, that they
metamorphose into adults with the transition rates β{1,2} . As an underlying
discussion, we introduce the two logistic coefficients σ{1,2} to accommodate
phenomena of competition amongst larvae. Assume that all in- or outdoor
water containers are treated as homogeneous such that σσ21 proportionates to
4

some constant M. The fact that suitable choice for M > 1 leads to the situation where outdoor breading sites have M-times larger carrying capacity
than indoor. After all, the model (1) is unfolded as
Ė1 = µpA − (α1 + η1 )E1 − qu1 E1

(2a)

Ė2 = µ(1 − p)A − (α2 + η2 )E2

(2b)

L̇1 = α1 E1 − σ1 L21 − (β1 + η3 )L1 − u1 L1

(2c)

L̇2 = α2 E2 − σ2 L22 − (β2 + η4 )L2

(2d)

Ȧ = β1 L1 + β2 L2 − η5 A − u2 A.

(2e)

Two control measures are added into the model. Temephos is practically disseminated into indoor water containers to kill larvae and eggs. The weighting
factor q ∈ 0, 12 accounts for the fact that the dissemination has less impact
on eggs. Meanwhile fumigation is directly targeted to adult mosquito population.
It is assumed that all the control u belongs to a set of admissible control
U ⊂ L2 ([0, T ], IR2+ ). Define
D := {x : ẋ(t) = f(x(t), u(t)), t ∈ [0, T ], x(0) = x0  0, u ∈ U}

(3)

as the feasible set of solutions. It is intuitively believed that the higher u
plugged into the model, the lesser the number of all classes. On the other
hand, the lesser u, the more the population tends to explosion. The more u
means that a policy maker needs to spend more fund, otherwise there will
be no significant reduction to the mosquito population size. Given positive
trade-off constants ωx,{1,··· ,5} and ωu,{1,2} , the following objective functional
accommodates the necessity of balancing situation between significant population reduction and limitation of fund:

Now our optimization problem is stated as

Model analysis

We need to ensure that our model is biologically meaningful. The following
theorem gives a primary meaningfulness of the model: whenever the initial
condition is positive, then evolution of the solution points in forward time
stays positive.
5

Theorem 1 Consider the model (1) where u ∈ U. If x0  0 then x(t)  0
for all t > 0, or particularly on the observation range (0, T ].
Proof Following the steps in [22], we let n be (5 × 5)-matrix representing
a collection of all normal vectors (by rows) to the boundary of nonnegative
orthant ∂IR5+ . Thus we have n = −I5 where I5 denotes the identity matrix.
To ensure that the trajectory of solution does not walk out of the nonnegative
orthant, one only needs to check the trajectory of points in the boundary.
Notice that at i-th boundary, ∂i IR5+ ,
[nf (x, u)]i |x∈∂i IR5 ,u∈U ≤ 0.
+

This means the direction of evolution of such points in a boundary is in
counter-direction or at least perpendicular to the corresponding normal vector. Thus it follows that the solution must not leave IR5+ for all t > 0.

Let us first consider the autonomous system of nonlinear differential equations (1) with constant control u ∈ IR2+ . For abbreviate purpose, let s1 = µp,
s2 = µ(1 − p), s3 = α1 , s4 = α2 , s5 = β1 , s6 = β2 and d1 = α1 + η1 + qu1 ,
d2 = α2 + η2 , d3 = β1 + η3 + u1 , d4 = β2 + η4 , d5 = η5 + u2 . In order to
obtain equilibria of the system, we need to solve f (x, u) = 0. It follows from
this process, one holds

Definition of Q2 and Q3 only makes sense in biological point of view if only
a1 , a2 are negative. The definition simply means that after very long time,
the class of either in- or outdoor larvae tends to extinction while the other
classes stay alive. In biological context, such situation can hardly happen.
In the next writing, we demonstrate that the choice of a1 , a2 to be positive
leads to a more interesting discussion. First, we introduce a measure whose
cubic value is given by

Using unity as a threshold value, the following theorem justifies the stability
of zero equilibrium Q1 by considering the nominal of R(u) relative to the
threshold. Meanwhile, the next theorem shows the existence of a positive
nontrivial equilibrium (also well-known as coexistence equilibrium).
Theorem 2 The zero equilibrium Q1 is locally asymptotically stable if R(u) <
1 and is unstable if R(u) > 1.
Proof Checking the stability of the zero equilibrium in local view, it is
similar to see behavior of solution of the linearized system (1) in the neighborhood of Q1 , i.e. ẋ = J(Q1 , u)(x − Q1 ). In this case, J(Q1 , u) stands for
Jacobian of f evaluated at Q1 . Unfolding this J(Q1 , u), we get

Q1 is locally asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of J(Q1 , u)
have negative real part. To see this, a simple cofactorization method computes determinant of J(Q1 , u) − λI5 as the sum of all its cofactors, given by
negative of

coeff (λ2 ) = d1 d2 d3 + · · · + d3 d4 d5 − s1 s3 s5 − s2 s4 s6 .

If R(u) < 1, or equivalently ds51ds31sd53 + ds52ds42sd64 < 1, one can see that coeff λ{0,1,2,3,4,5}
are real positive. Since limλ→±∞ −det(J(Q1 , u)−λI5 ) = ±∞, −det(J(Q1 , u) − λI5 )|λ=0 >

then det(J(Q1 , u)−λI5 ) can not have zero that has positive real part. Moreover, all zeros of det(J(Q1 , u) − λI5 ) have negative real part. If R(u) > 1,
then coeff(λ0 ) < 0. Then for however the values of coeff (λ1 ) and coeff (λ2 ),
it follows that there must be at least one real positive zero. This means Q1 is
unstable. If R(u) = 1, then a similar step can prove that det(J(Q1 , u)−λI5 )
has one zero with the value 0 and the other zeros remain with negative real
part. In this case, Q1 is considerably still stable but not asymptotical. 

Theorem 3 If a1 and a2 are positive, a unique coexistence equilibrium Q4
exists if R(u) > 1 and does not if R(u) ≤ 1. If a1 and a2 are negative,
then there always exists a coexistence equilibrium for any value of R(u). If
else, then it always holds R(u) > 1, and therefore, there always exists a
coexistence equilibrium.
Proof One simple substitution in (6d)-(6e) makes the equilibrium state L1
to follow
L41 + 2a1 L31 + (a21 − b1 a2 )L21 + (b21 b2 − a1 b1 a2 )L1 = 0.
As L1 = 0 results to equilibria that has been discussed before, now let us
consider the remaining cubic
P (L1 ) := L31 + 2a1 L21 + (a21 − b1 a2 )L1 + (b21 b2 − a1 b1 a2 ).
Since coefficient of L31 is 1 > 0, then limL1 →±∞ P = ±∞. We prove this
theorem by parity.
Case 1 a1 and a2 are positive. In this case, three possibilities are carried
out: R(u) > 1, R(u) < 1 and R(u) = 1. If R(u) > 1, then by identity (8) it
holds that b1 b2 > a1 a2 . Thus we have 0 > b21 b2 − a1 b1 a2 = P (0) since b1 < 0.
It follows from the value of P (0) and limL1 →∞ P = ∞ that P must have at
1)
least one positive root. Now we have to check that L2 = L1 (L−b1 +a
> 0. To
1
2
see this, let L1 = ρ be the corresponding root, where ρ ∈ IR\{0}. Extracting
(L1 − ρ2 ) out of the cubic, we get L21 + (2a1 + ρ2 )L1 + N where
N := (a21 − b1 a2 ) + ρ2 (2a1 + ρ2 ).

> 0 then together with the claim of uniqueness of
Since N =

2
positive root L1 = ρ , we need (2a1 + ρ2 ) > 0 to ensure that the remaining
quadratic function does not have real positive root. Since a1 > 0, then
(ρ2 + a1 ) > 0. Now we have proved that L2 is positive, and by (6), the other
states are also positive. If R(u) < 1, then P (0) > 0. Since limL1 →−∞ P =
−∞, this means there exists at least one negative root L1 = −ε2 of the cubic,
where ε ∈ IR\{0}. Now extract (L1 + ε2 ) out of the cubic and we get the
remaining quadratic function L21 + (2a1 − ε2 )L1 + M where

M := (a21 − b1 a2 ) − ε2 (2a1 − ε2 ).
b2 b −a b a

It turns out that M = 1 2 ε21 1 2 = Pε(0)
> 0. Thus further analysis confirms
2
that a positive root exists whenever (2a1 − ε2 ) is strictly less than zero and
the discriminant ∆ = (2a1 − ε2 )2 − 4M ≥ 0. One can see that ∆ = (2a1 −
ε2 )2 − 4(a21 − b1 a2 ) + 4ε2 (2a1 − ε2 ) = (2a1 + 3ε2 )(2a1 − ε2 ) − 4(a21 − b1 a2 ) < 0
since a1 , a2 > 0 and b1 < 0. This contradicts the necessity that ∆ ≥ 0. Then
there does not exist positive root of the cubic. At last, if R(u) = 1, then
b21 b2 −a1 b1 a2 = 0 and we get the remaining quadratic L21 +2a1 L1 +(a21 −b1 a2 ).
Since a1 , a2 > 0 and b1 < 0, it is clear that the quadratic does not have any
real positive root.
Case 2 a1 and a2 are negative. If R(u) > 1, then it is easily seen that one
1)
positive root exists. Now we have to check that L2 = L1 (L−b1 +a
> 0. To see
1
this, as it is previously done together with the claim of uniqueness of positive
root L1 = ρ2 , we need (2a1 + ρ2 ) > 0 to ensure that the remaining quadratic
function does not have real positive root. Then (ρ2 + a1 ) > (2a1 + ρ2 ) > 0
since a1 < 0. Now we have proved that L2 is positive, and therefore, the
other states are also positive. If R(u) = 1, we have b21 b2 − a1 b1 a2 = 0
and the remaining quadratic function is L21 + 2a1 L1 + (a21 − b1 a2 ). Since
∆ = 4a21 − 4(a21 − b1 a2 ) = 4b1 a2 > 0 and 2a1 < 0, then a positive root exists
whose uniqueness is confirmed by the value of (a21 − b1 a2 ). Thus we need to
1)
proof that L2 = L1 (L−b1 +a
> 0. Let L1 = η 2 be such root, then the other root
1
(a21 −b1 a2 )
.
η2
a1 > η 2 +

must be L1 = −(2a1 +η 2 ) where (2a1 +η 2 ) = −

However, the positive
(a2 −b a )

root is unique if (a21 − b1 a2 ) ≤ 0, then η 2 +
2a1 = − 1 η21 2 ≥ 0.
This confirms that L2 > 0. If R(0) < 1, then as before, we have at least one
negative root L1 = −ε2 and the remaining quadratic L21 + (2a1 − ε2 )L1 + M.
Observe that M > 0 and (2a1 − ε2 ) < 0 since a1 < 0. Some factorization
(1,2)
confirms that there exist two remaining positive roots L1 = {ρ2 , ξ 2} where
ξ 2 = −(2a1 − ε2 + ρ2 ) and ρ2 ξ 2 = M. Then we have to check the result
(1,2)
of L1 + a since this confirms positivity of L2 , or furthermore, existence of
positive equilibrium. Since (ρ2 + a1 ) + (ξ 2 + a1 ) = −(2a1 − ε2 ) + 2a1 = ε2 > 0,
9

this ensures that at least one of the roots is greater than −a1 , since then at
least one root makes L2 positive.
Case 3 Else. Since it always holds b1 b2 > a1 a2 , then this implies R(u) > 1
and P (0) = b21 b2 − a1 b1 a2 < 0. Therefore, there is always (not necessarily
unique) coexistence equilibrium. This completes the proof.

All classes have responsibility to generate offsprings in sense that newborns are impossible whenever one class in the system remains zero for all
time. In line with this sense, we define the mosquito-free equilibrium (MFE)
as a static condition when all classes can not reproduce for the next offsprings.
This means MFE is equivalent to the zero equilibrium Q1 . Following the next
generation method [8], we define two matrices F (u), V (u) where F (u) is a
matrix with zeros in the main diagonal and V (u) is a positive diagonal matrix such that J(Q1 , u) = F (u) − V (u). Then we define the so-called next
generation matrix G(u) = F (u)V (u)−1 which is nothing but

(i, j)-th element of this matrix represents the average number of new individuals in compartment i produced by a single individual from compartment
j during compartment j’s average individual lifetime period. It is easy to see
that the spectral radius of G(u) is given by
max{|ρ| : u ∈ R2+ , det(G(u) − ρI5 ) = 0} = R(u).

(10)

This R(u) is often called as the basic mosquito offspring number. Formulation in (7) provides dependency of the basic mosquito offspring number on
several parameters and the control u. In Section 5, we check behaviour of the
basic mosquito offspring number with respect to the control and to several
unknown empirical parameters.
Theorem 4 The existing coexistence equilibrium Q4 is globally asymptotically stable in the nonnegative orthant IR5+ if R(u) > 1.
Remark We omit writing the detail for the proof of the theorem. Furthermore, it requires the use of the so-called Krasovskii–LaSalle principle. As another reference, one can further see from numerical results that the solution
of the model is monotonic and tends asymptotically to Q4 , by supplemented
condition that the set of parameters is chosen such that R(u) > 1.

Optimal control problem

Recall our optimization problem:
find (x, u) ∈ D × U such that J(u) → min .

(OC)

Denote by U a set of admissible controls Rwhere it is assumed to be compact.
T
Let g be a functional such that J(u) = 0 g(x, u) dt. Let ū be an optimal
control that solves (OC). Consider a small variation around the optimal
control
uǫ (t) = ū(t) + ǫκ(t), |ǫ| ≪ 1.
(11)
Plugging this variation into (1) together with positive initial condition, we
have the resulting perturbed state xǫ , where it holds
ẋǫ − x̄˙ = f(xǫ , uǫ ) − f (x̄, ū).

(12)

Note that f ∈ C 1 (IR5 × IR2 , IR5 ), thus we have the following Taylor approach
d ǫ
(x − x̄) = f x (x̄, ū)(xǫ − x̄) + ǫf u (x̄, ū)κ + O(ǫ2 ).
dt

(13)

Working at O(ǫ2 ), we let ϕ be the solution of the differential equation
ϕ̇ = f x (x̄, ū)ϕ + f u (x̄, ū)κ,

ϕ(0) = 0.

(14)

Thus some algebraic computations show that our perturbed state is given by
xǫ = x̄ + ǫϕ + O(ǫ2 ).

(15)

Further it can be proved that the solution of (14) exists and therefore the
ǫ
exists.

It is essential that U is bounded as this supports meaningfulness in practical
implementation of the control. For the sake of simplicity, we consider U =
L2 ([0, T ], [v1 , w1 ] × [v2 , w2 ]) and the according projection
sat(u) = max (v, min (w, u))

(21)

mapping any control u into U.
To solve the optimal control problem (OC) for bounded control u ∈ U,
we first consider the unconstrained convex optimization problem
find (x, u) ∈ L2 × L2 such that J(u) → min
and use the projection (21) to map the control into a convex set U. Since U is
a constriction of L2 , the projection leads us to the optimal solution of (OC).
After all, Algorithm 1 illustrates our scheme to solve (OC).

Numerical results

Several discussions in this section aims at determining the impact of control
intervention to the abundance of mosquito population in visual statements.
We accentuate in this paper that significant reduction of the population
evolution in forward time be a carry-over from only a cheap optimal control.
Realistically, optimal control still suffers from practical drawbacks that one
can not easily implement it in real situation. The reason is slightly supported
by undisciplined executors in the field to implement the programme as it
looks as in optimal control result. On the other hand, a constant control
benefits from its easy-to-implement scheme as the executors only need to
13

deal with fixed-fund allotment problem with flat daily distribution. Another
benefit from using constant control is that nominal of the basic mosquito
offspring number can explicitly be computed. This computation educes some
important statements regarding endemicity of the observed area. It has been
preliminarily known that whenever the basic mosquito offspring number is
less than unity, then two facts arise: the zero equilibrium is stable but the
coexistence equilibrium does not exist. If this number is greater than unity,
then the zero equilibrium is unstable and the coexistence equilibrium exists
and is stable. This roughly means that the endemic situation will emerge
and stay uninterruptible. Otherwise, constant control result always emerges
with a higher cost compared to optimal control.
In order to do numerical tests, all the parameters involved in the model
have to be represented in numerics. Table 1 gives an estimate for all parameters.

Constant control

To some reasons, the basic mosquito offspring number R(u) reflects the hierarchy of endemicity of dengue. The higher R(u), the more rapid mosquito’s
growth, and therefore the higher the number of dengue incidences. In this
case, we demonstrate primary impacts of using constant control to R(u).

14

Alongside with this illustration, we show a dependence of R(0) to some unknown parameters that may be hard to find, or at least hard to estimate.
Such parameters can be like p (the prevalence probability of mosquito adult
to breed indoor) and µ (the percapita birth rate of eggs). The following
figures give the illustrations.

(p, µ)-plane.
From Fig. 1, some conclusions are highlighted. It is clear from the figure
that u2 gives a more significant decrease to nominal of the basic mosquito
offspring number compared to u1 . In constant control case, each value of
control taken in the set of real positive numbers can roughly represent a
negative return. A negative return u1 of 1 simply means that, 100% the
number of individuals as in the previous step (in day) has to be killed in the
current step by Temephos dissemination. In practice, this requirement seems
hard to achieve due to several arising technical and spatial heterogeneity
problems. From Fig. 1, a suitable choice of constant control pair in the range
[0, 1] × [0, 1] still gives insignificant reduction to the number of mosquitoes.
In an extreme case, killing 100% the number of individuals as in the previous
step in both Temephos dissemination and fumigation schemes still arises
endemic situation in the observed area. However, to achieve the condition
R(u) < 1, one has to produce a high value of negative return. For example,
killing 40% (for indoor larvae and q times indoor eggs) and 180% (for adults)
as in the previous step will produce R(u) ≈ 0.9. With the same definition,
killing respectively 60% and 120% leads to R(u) . 1, meaning that there
15

will be a possibility for the mosquito population to be completely eradicated
for long time.
Meanwhile from Fig. 2, for whatever the values of (p, µ) are taken in
the range [0, 1] × [1, 5], the mosquitoes will never die out. The choice of
all parameters in the model seems suitable with real situation in endemic
region, that is, the basic mosquito offspring number with the absence of
control must be greater than unity. This is another reason why we need
control intervention. In the figure, µ appears with similar sensitivity as u2
in Fig. 1. It can be seen that µ is very sensitive, as its slight changes lead
to the significant differences of the hierarchy of endemicity. In reality, µ
can be a number that depends on meteorological parameters. It is believed
that the more environmental condition sustain mosquitoes’ life, the higher
µ. The result as in Fig. 2 can be another way to confirm that meteorology
distribution gives a significant impact to the mosquito abundance in the field.
The figure also tells us that, based on our model, to where adult mosquitoes
prevalent to breed is not really a big deal.

5.2

Time-variant optimal control

Initially, we consider the trajectory of solution to the equation ẋ = f (x, 0), x0 
0, defined as x(t; 0). It can numerically be shown that x(t; 0) is monotonic
and tends to the coexistence equilibrium Q4 for very long time. Set t1 = 0,
t2 = 50, t3 = 100 and
Di := {x : ẋ = f (x, u), t ∈ [0, T ], x0 = x(ti ; 0), u ∈ U},

i = 1, 2, 3.

(22)

We divide our numerical scheme based on three scenarios:
(Sc-1) find (x, u) ∈ D1 × U such that J(u) → min,
(Sc-2) find (x, u) ∈ D2 × U such that J(u) → min,
(Sc-3) find (x, u) ∈ D3 × U such that J(u) → min.
It is supposed that we want to check the dynamics of mosquito population in house-scale including its nearest neighborhood. On average proportion, we let x(t1 ; 0) = [8, 8, 6, 6, 5]. Thus we obtained from our preliminary simulation that x(t2 ; 0) = [200.41, 354.84, 73.82, 134.85, 30.56] and
x(t3 ; 0) = [283.12, 514.21, 91.19, 168.22, 39.16] respectively.
One purpose of dividing initial condition for our simulations is to check
which scenario arising with the cheapest cost, the one which is applied in T
days after t = t1 (the earliest growth time), t = t2 (the peak of outbreak) or
t = t3 (the population almost reach the coexistence equilibrium). It may also
16

be the case that the cost increases with respect to the magnitude of initial
condition. Another purpose is to check which scenario giving the least total
endpoints kx(T ; ū)k1 and if the optimal control results in positive value for
kx(0; ū)k1 − kx(T ; ū)k1 , then there is a number n > 1 such that continuation
of optimal control scheme will completely eradicate mosquito population in
nT days. Concerning definition of the total cost C(u), we define a weighting
factor A > 0 such that

At first look, it is clear from Figs. 3-7 that the optimal control makes
significant reduction to all classes of mosquito population. With the same
scheme, we can find similar results for both Sc-2 and Sc-3. It turns out that
by using the data from Table 1, fumigation relatively needs to be enhanced
rather than Temephos dissemination during application of the control. Figs. 1
and 8 tell us so. For further managerial reference, Table 2 represents the performance of optimal control in each scenario. We also highlight the optimal
control performance when one scheme vanishes.
From the table, we conclude:
1. A complete control intervention using two schemes appears with the
highest cost for each of three tested scenarios compared to the ones

when one scheme vanishes. It is also noted that the cost slightly increases from Sc-1 to Sc-3, meaning there is a positive correlation between initial condition taken for simulation and the cost. If we consider
epidemiology of dengue amongst humans and mosquitoes, this fact can
help us to decide when we should start to conduct eradication programme. It appears as well in the table that there is a huge difference
between the cost for maintaining only Temephos dissemination and
only fumigation. Mathematically, this phenomenon arises due to the
choice of the trade-off coefficient ωx . In this case, we assume that the

adults need to be accounted for more attention, hence we put a higher
value for ωx,5 . However, this does not always mean that taking more
consideration to reduce adult trajectory requires a higher value of fumigation measure rather than Temephos dissemination measure. In our
simulation, even if we take ωx,5 similar to the others, the result is more
or less similar to the one as in Fig. 8. A reader can play around with
this coefficient in order to get the result which suits the real situation
best.
2. From the table, it is seen that a complete combination of two control
measures can extremely reduce the total endpoints of mosquito population. Maintaining only Temephos dissemination leads us to the worst
case, i.e. there will be up to 800 total individuals remaining alive after
T days of treatment. Meanwhile, maintaining only fumigation results
in moderate total endpoints. If we compute kx(0; ū)k1 − kx(T ; ū)k1 ,
then we would highly recommend to apply both control schemes as an
integrated programme.
P
3. We interpret T1 5i=1 kxi (t; ū)kL1 as the average number of total population size at each time during observation. The higher its value,
the higher the number of dengue incidences that may probably occur.
Again, maintaining only Temephos dissemination leads to the worst
case. We highlight that the complete control with two measures gives
the best reduction. Now from the table we know that a preventive act
of starting the control programme when the number of individuals is
19

small and a simultaneous combination of both control measures will
bring us tthe best results: least cost, fewest total endpoints and fewest
number of individuals living during treatment. However, due to practical limitations, this ideal situation may not be achieved. Knowing the
density of mosquito population in average house, we can refer to which
column in the last three columns of Table 2 in order to give the best
decision for a suitable control management.

Conclusion

We have an optimal control model for mosquito population dynamics with
indoor-outdoor life cycle classification. This model initiates the depicting
situation in most dengue endemic areas where mosquitoes originate from indoor as well as outdoor. Two schematic control measures are added to the
model as regulators in reducing the evolution of mosquito population in forward time. The first measure represents a negative return that is earned by
maintaining Temephos dissemination to some indoor spots where immature
phases live. Temephos dissemination aims at killing larvae and a small percentage of eggs. Meanwhile the second measure is represented by a negative
return earned from fumigation that targets directly to adults.
Some brief underlying results from the work in this paper are:
In constant control case, the proposed model enumerates a primary biological meaningfulness, i.e. the evolution of mosquito population in forward time results in positive values. With the given estimate of parameters and initial condition, it can numerically be seen that the evolution
of total population remains bounded for all t > 0 by the positive number
max{kx(0; u)k1 , kQ4 k1 }.
If the basic mosquito offspring number is less than unity, then two conditions arise: (i) the zero equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and (ii)
the coexistence equilibrium does not exist.
If the basic mosquito offspring number is greater than unity, then three
conditions arise: (i) the zero equilibrium is unstable, (ii) the coexistence
equilibrium exists and (iii) is globally asymptotically stable in nonnegative
orthant.
The optimal control results as displayed in Table 2 can be used as a
reference in decision-making process. A brief conclusion states that: in an
endemic situation, the best mosquito control impacts are produced if the
control is started when the number of individuals is as small as possible, also
with combination of the two simultaneous schemes proposed in this paper.
Both in constant control and optimal control cases, one has to enhance
20

implementation of fumigation rather than Temephos dissemination.
