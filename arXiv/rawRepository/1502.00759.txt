Abstract
The Gompertz law of mortality quantitatively describes the mortality rate of humans and almost
all multicellular animals. However, its underlying kinetic mechanism is unclear. The Gompertz
law cannot explain the effect of temperature on lifespan and the mortality plateau at advanced
ages. In this study a reaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to
describe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent mortality function was
derived. The new mortality function becomes the Gompertz mortality function with the same
relationship of parameters prescribed by the Strehler-Mildvan correlation when age is smaller
than a characteristic value δ, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than δ. A
closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average lifespan with
temperature and other equations are derived from the new mortality function. The derived
equations can be used to estimate the limit of average lifespan, predict the maximal longevity,
calculate the temperature coefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of survival curve. This
prediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories for single-year birth
cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process results from the imbalance between
damaging energy and protecting energy for the critical chemical substance in the body. The rate
of senescence of the organism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality
plateau is reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The decreasing
rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent. This study is exploring the connection
between biochemical mechanism and demography.

Introduction
The human mortality rate can be fit by an exponential formula that was proposed by Benjamin
Gompertz in 1825 (1). This formula is known today as the Gompertz “law of mortality” that
describes the process of senescence in almost all multicellular animals (2). Searching for the
mechanism underlying the mortality law started as early as Gompertz publishing his paper on the
law of mortality (3, 4). At the present, there are three main strands of demographic theories,
mutation accumulation, stochastic vitality, and optimal life histories, in studying aging process
(5). Furthermore, changes in certain substances and inherent energy were also considered to be
related to aging process (3, 6-8). Nearly a century ago, it was demonstrated that the ambient
temperature might change the lifespan of the aseptic flies of Drosophila (9) and that the
temperature coefficient for Drosophila’s lifespan is close to that of a chemical reaction,
indicating that chemical substances play an important role in the aging process. A few years later,
Brownlee conjectured that the inherent energy of certain substances in the body is gradually
being destroyed throughout life (6). However, in the same paper, he also pointed out “Various
formulas in physical chemistry, which might be considered possibly applicable, were tried
without success”. Up to now, it is unclear whether Brownlee’s conjecture is correct or not. Lines
of evidence show that the real mortality rate at very advanced ages levels off from the
exponential formula of mortality rate (10-16), and the Gompertz law of mortality cannot be used
to predict the effect of temperature on lifespan because temperature is not a variable or parameter
in the Gompertz function. In this study, the author will explore the following questions: What is
the biochemical mechanism underlying Gompertz’s law of mortality? Why does a mortality rate
plateau exist at very advanced ages? How can the effect of temperature on lifespan be explained?
A new mortality rate function will be presented. This new morality function predicts the
mortality plateau appearing in the period of age greater than δ, consistent with the most recent
human mortality data demonstrated by (17). Analytical expressions for describing the
relationship of average lifespan with temperature and some other equations will be derived from
this new function.
Theoretical methods
Considering that a molecule has an initial concentration c0 and its decomposition rate (dc/dx)
follows first-order kinetics as below:

dc( x)
dN ( x)
= −kc( x) = −k '(e− Ea / RT )c( x) or
= −kN ( x) = −k '(e− Ea / RT ) N ( x) (1)
dx
dx
where c is the concentration of the molecules at time x, k is the rate constant, Ea is activation
energy for the decomposition reaction, k' is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, T is
the absolute temperature, and N is the number of molecules at time x (N0 is initial number of the
molecules). The above two equations can be converted to each other by a factor of the volume V
containing these molecules. Assuming that the life process is a chemical process and that a large
number of people (s0) with identical biological and chemical properties are born on the same day
at time 0, the rate of change in the population (ds/dx) is similar to Eq. (1):
ds ( x)
(2)
= − ms ( x) = −( Ae − El / RT ) s ( x)
dx
where m is the rate coefficient, A is the pre-exponential factor, and El is the activation energy
relating to the rate of decrease of the survival function s. El can be also considered as the living
energy that is required for survival. Unlike the normal simple molecules, humans will age and
their death rate varies with age, so m is a function of x.
3

Hypothesis: The living energy El, which is proportional to the quantity of a vital molecular unit
that linearly decreases with time, is the energy to protect the chemical substance that is critical
for life from being impaired by damaging energy (the magnitudes of challenges (7)) from other
molecules or from itself. This hypothesis suggests that aging results from the imbalance between
damaging energy and protecting energy for the critical chemical substance. The rate of
senescence of the organism increases while the protecting energy decreases.
Under this hypothesis, we assume that the initial quantity of this vital molecular unit is l0 and its
decrease rate is b. At time x, the quantity (L) of this molecular unit is:
(3)
L(x)=l0-bx
The identity of this vital molecular unit is unclear. Telomeres, which protect DNA (the critical
chemical substance) from degradation, may be one of candidates. It has been showed that the
length of the shortest telomeres is the major determinant of the onset of senescence (18, 19).
Since average length of telomeres and the shortest 5% of telomeres are shortened at a rate nearly
linear with time (20, 21), we can assume that the length of the shortest telomeres (such as the
shortest 5% (21)) also decreases linearly with time. In this case, L, l0 and b can be considered as
the length of the shortest telomeres at time x, the initial length of the shortest telomeres, and the
shortening rate of telomeres. Based on the above hypothesis, the living energy El is proportional
to L:
El(x)=k0L(x)= k0 (l0-bx)
(4)
where k0 is the coefficient for converting the length of telomeres into the living energy. Eq. (4)
defines the conversion relationship from the vital molecular unit to the living energy. In the real
world, a person’s death is usually caused by some diseases. The diseases may be prevented by
some medicines, physical exercise, and good personal hygiene. If a person becomes ill with a
disease, the disease may be medically treated. As a result, these external “forces” can enlarge or
reduce the living energy. Therefore, k0 has included the effect of these external “forces”.
In Eq. (4), b is a rate constant of telomere shortening, so it can be written in the following form
based on Arrhenius equation:

b = b0 e − Et / RT

(5)
where Et is the activation energy independent of time x in the telomere shortening process.
Eq. (4) can be written as:
(6)
El ( x ) = k0 (l0 − bx ) = β '− α ' x = β '− (α 0' e − Et / RT ) x
where β՛=k0l0 and
k0b = α ' = α 0' e − Et / RT = k0b0 e − Et / RT
(7)
Since the effective length of the telomere cannot be less than 0, we have:
l0-bx≥0 or El=β' -α'x≥0
(8)
Substitution of Eq. (6) into Eq. (2) gives:
α 'x − β '
(9)
m( x ) = A exp(
) = A exp(α x − β ) = A exp(α ( x − δ )) , for x ≤ β/α=δ
RT
At x=δ, El becomes zero and m(x) becomes the constant A. In this situation, m(x) is no longer
dependent on time x because the effective telomere length or the living energy has dropped to
zero already. So m(x) will remain at the constant A as x continuously increases:

In Eq. (9), β=β'/RT and
α = α ' / RT = (α 0' / RT )e− Et / RT = k0b0 e − Et / RT

δ = β / α = β ' / α ' = l0 / b = l0 /(b0 e− E / RT ) = β ' /(α 0' e − E / RT )

Based on the definition of mortality rate, m(x) is the mortality rate. Substitution of Eqs. (9) and
(9)´ into (2) gives:

(14)
In many cases, such as for human survival functions, αδ>>1, so (A/α)exp(-αδ) is close to 0 or the
parameter B is close to one. Thus, B can be omitted in the following derivation of equations.
Eq. (13) has the same form as the Gompertz survival function. When x≥δ, the decay rate of S(x)
follows first order kinetics (Eq. (13)´). The decay rate constant is A and the half-life t1/2 of S(x) at
very advanced ages can be calculated from the following half-life formula for the first-order
reaction:

From the above equations, we can see that δ is an important characteristic value representing the
average time that a human body uses up all its living energy. Therefore, δ can be looked at as the
characteristic value for life. Eq. (9) can be rewritten in the form: m(x)=Rexp(αx), where
R=Aexp(-αδ), or
ln(R)=ln(A)-αδ
(16)
Eq. (13) is the same as the SM correlation (linear relationship between ln(R) and α) derived by
Strehler and Mildvan (General theory of mortality and aging, 1960) if the symbols R, A and δ in
Eq. (16) here are replaced by R0, K and 1/B in Eq. (16) in SM’s paper (7), respectively. Taking
logarithms on both sides of Eq. (9), we have
ln(m( x)) = ln( A) + α ( x − δ ) = (ln( A) − αδ ) + α x , for x ≤δ
(16)´
Taking logarithms on both sides of Eq. (9)՛, we have
ln(m(x))=ln(A), for x≥δ
(16)´´
Eq. (16)´ shows that the plot of ln(m(x)) vs. x is a straight line with a slope of α and the intercept
of ln(A)-αδ. At x=δ, all plots of ln(m(x)) vs. x will intersect at the point (δ, lnA) regardless of the
value of α if both A and δ are constants. Eq. (16)´ is known as compensation law of mortality
(22). The mortality plateau will appear when x≥δ as described by Eq. (16)´´.
Results
Finding the life characteristic value δ
Eq. (13) was used to fit survival curves of 11 countries around the world (23, 24) for the past
100-200 years. Since the data points are not stable at younger ages, we used data points for ≥ 40
5

years of ages in the curve-fitting analysis. The parameters B, α and x0 were determined from the
best fitting lines. These determined parameters were used to further calculate the parameter δ
from Eq. (14). The determined
values of x0 and the calculated
values of the parameter δ for
the 11 countries (males) are
plotted in Fig. 1. These data
show that x0 (x0 is proportional
to the life expectancy at birth)
increased linearly in the past
200 years, but δ is almost a
constant (100.4 ± 2.0 years) in
the same period. The average
value of δ between 1820 and
1900 is 101.3±1.4 years. It
slightly decreased in the period
from 1900 to 1940 and
increased from 1960 to the
present. The average value of δ Fig. 1. Determination of parameters x0 and δ. Values of x0 are
between 1940 and1960 is determined from the survival data of 11 countries (male) (Australia,
99.0±1.6 years, but it increases Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway,
to 102.5±1.9 years between Sweden, Scotland and USA) for the past 100-200 years. The plotted
data points show that x0 (●) linearly increases in the past 200 years, but
2000 and 2011.
δ (▲) is almost independent of time.
Mortality plateau at very advanced ages
An examination of mortality rate in the United States from 1999 to 2007 shows that the plot
of logarithm of mortality rate vs. age (x) for the ages greater than 80 years old for each of these 8
years is similar. The logarithm of the mortality rate reaches a plateau at age ~104 (Fig. 2A). The

star. The dashed line is the mortality plateau predicted from Eq. (16)´´ for the 1898 birth cohort.

mortality rate plateau was also seen in other animals (11, 25). However, the mortality plateau or
deceleration at old age was not clearly seen in a number of studies on mammals (22, 26, 27). One
6

may ask: Is there no mortality plateau at all, or is there a mortality plateau that appears at very
advanced ages that was not shown in earlier studies? In a recent paper, Gavrilova and Gavrilov
showed that the logarithms of mortality rates for 1895 and 1898 birth cohorts of U.S. women
linearly rose with age up to very advanced ages, no mortality plateau appeared for the 1895
cohort, but a mortality plateau appeared for the 1898 cohort (HMD data) after 104 years of age
(17). Their data are very helpful for answering the above question. To compare the two
mortality trajectories, we read the data points from their paper and re-plotted these data points in
Figs. 2B & 2C. The two linear plots intersect at a very advanced age (Fig. 2B). To determine the
intersection point, we re-plotted the two sets of mortality data in Fig. 2C, but only the data with
ages greater than 80 are shown. The solid lines are the best-fitting lines for the data points (1895
and 1898 birth cohorts) between 80 to 90 years. The two fitting lines intersect at the point (104.2,
-0.495) designated by the red star. The dashed line is the mortality plateau predicted from Eq.
(16)´´ for the 1898 birth cohort.

If the mortality plateau occurs at the tail part of a survival curve (such as human survival curve
(Fig. 2) or other animals (28)) or the difference of the last two terms in the right side of Eq. (17)
is small enough comparing to the first term, then the last two term can be ignored. Under this
approximation, LE0 can be approximately expressed by the first term in Eq. (17). Let y=α(x-x0),
dy=αdx. Eq. (17) can be rewritten as:

The negative sign indicates that LE0 decreases as T increases. Eq. (22) shows that θ of a
species is proportional to the activation energy and LE0 of the species and inversely proportional
to T squared.
To test Eq. (21), we examined literature data regarding the effects of temperature on LE0 of
poikilotherms such as flies. The results show that ln(LE0/T) (▲, Drosophila (30); ●, Calliphora
stygia (31)) is linear with 1/T. From the slope of the best fitting lines (solid lines in Figs. 3A &
3B), we can determine the value of g2, which is close to 10,000 (K). Assuming T=293 K (20 ºC)
and g2 is 10,000 K, the calculated temperature coefficient from Eq. (22) is θ≈-0.12LE0. This
indicates that the life will increase ~0.12LE0 when temperature decreases by one degree and will
double the average lifespan when temperature decreases by eight degrees.

Discussion
Based on the hypothesis on the living energy and the vital molecular unit, such as the average
length of the shortest telomeres, the author derived a new mortality rate equation. This new
equation has two branches (Eqs. (9) & (9)´) which are divided by the characteristic value for life,
δ. At x≤ δ, the equation has the same form as the Gompertz mortality rate equation and leads to
the same parameter relationship (Eq. (16)) as the one described by the Strehler-Mildvan
correlation. However, the new mortality rate equation contains two new terms. One is the
mortality rate in the x≥δ branch (Eq. (9)') that predicts the mortality plateau at very advanced
ages, and the other is the temperature-dependent parameter (Eqs. (10) and (11)) describing the
temperature dependence of the mortality rate function. In addition to Eq. (16), several other
equations have been derived from Eq. (9).
The derived Eq. (14) gives the relationship between δ and other parameters that can be obtained
from the survival (x0 and α) and mortality (A) curves. The values of x0 determined from survival
curves of 11 countries and the values of δ calculated from Eq. (14) are demonstrated in Fig. 1. It
can be seen that x0 gradually increases during the period in the past centuries, but δ is close to a
constant (100.4 ± 2.0 years) with a slightly but continuously increase since 1950-1960. If x0
continuously increases and δ remains at a constant, α will increase based on Eq. (14). In this case,
the upper part of the survival curve expressed by Eq. (9) will shift to the right side quicker than
the lower tail part. This tendency of change in x0 and δ is consistent with the tendency
(rectangularization (32, 33)) of change in the patterns of human survival curves in the past
centuries. An example of Norway survival curves is shown in Fig. 4. This rectangularization is
also a result prescribed by Strehler and Mildvan theory of mortality because the theory assumed
8

that δ (or 1/B) is a constant (7, 34). However, analysis on the survival data of the last century
shows that this process continued with a slight tendency to derectangularization of the survival
curves in the developed countries
after 1950-1960 (34, 35). This
derectangularization is deviated
from the Strehler and Mildvan
theory of mortality. In contrast,
the value of δ is not required as a
constant in the new mortality
equation presented above, because
δ is dependent on body
temperature. It is interesting that
this derectangularization process
proceeds with the increase in δ in
the same period (after 1950-1960).
The new mortality rate equation
shows that the age-dependent rate
coefficient or mortality rate Fig. 4. Period patterns of survival improvement in Norway.
increases exponentially with age
until age reaches the characteristic value of life, δ. As x≥δ, ln(m(x)) is a constant, ln(A) (Fig. 2).
This type of mortality rate can be seen in some organisms such as seed beetle species (10, 36). It
was also demonstrated that the logarithm of mortality rate is linear with age up to very advanced
ages when mortality data of single-year birth cohorts are used (17). The mortality trajectories for
1895 birth cohort and 1898 birth cohort of U.S. women intersect at 104 years of age (Fig. 2B and
Fig. 2C). From Eqs. (16)՛and (16)´´, we know that the value of x at the intersection is equal to δ,
and the mortality plateau (the value of y at the intersection) will appear when the age x is greater
than δ. It is interesting to note that the mortality plateau does show up for the 1898 birth cohort
after 104 years of age, and there is no plateau in the mortality curve for the 1895 birth cohort
before 104 years of age. Thus, mortality trajectories shown in Fig. 2B and 2C are an excellent
example for the new mortality function (Eqs. (16)՛and (16)´´). To see a mortality plateau for
humans, the initial sample size needs to be large enough to ensure enough samples at very
advanced ages. Furthermore, human health needs to improve so that more people can survive to
very advanced ages. As more and more people can live over 100 years, the mortality plateau will
be more easily observed from mortality curves in the future.
The derived Eq. (20) gives the relationship between LE0 and the parameters in survival and
mortality functions (α, δ and A). Eq. (20) shows that LE0 approaches δ, as α approaches infinity.
The average δ in the past 200 years for the male population is nearly constant (~101 years),
indicating that the ratio of l0 to b (the time it takes to use up the living energy) did not
significantly extend. Therefore, based on Eq. (20), the LE0 increase in the past 200 years was
mainly caused by α relating to those external “forces”, such as improvement in health and
medical services, which contributed to k0 for enlarging the living energy. This indicates that the
maximal LE0 will be limited by the characteristic value of life δ if biomedical technology in the
future can only increase α but are not able to extend δ (δ ranges from 102 to 105 years between
2004 and 2011). The mortality will reach its maximal rate at age δ, implying that the mortality
will not increase exponentially with age, but will remain in a constant A after age δ. As a result,
the mortality rate for human with ages greater than δ will significantly slower than that predicted
9

by Gompertz mortality law. Despite with this slow mortality rate, if there are 10,000 people at
105 years of age, only one of them may be alive at 120 assuming A=0.64. Therefore, the
probability of living up to 120 years for a human being is extremely low(37), if δ is not extended.
To significantly extend human maximal lifespan, δ needs to be elongated and/or the life decay
rate constant A needs to decrease. The life decay is likely a characteristic of the human body. It
may not be cured by modern medicine at this point (38). However, we hope that this may be
changed in the future. Since δ is the ratio of the average initial length of the shortest telomeres (l0)
to the shortening rate of telomeres (b), the increase in δ implies the decrease in b if we assume
that l0 does not change in humans. Decrease in b can be reached through either physical methods
(such as room temperature) or biochemical methods. It is interesting that the average δ value has
been slowly increasing in the past 50 years from its minimum (1940-1960). From Eq. (5) we
know that decrease in b can be caused by the decrease in body temperature, and the decrease in
body temperature may be related to the continuous improvement of working and living
conditions (such as the broad application of air conditioners in the developed countries). A line
of evidence has showed that temperature reduction in both poikilotherms and homeotherms
extends lifespan (39-44). To test if the new mortality equation can explain the effect of
temperature on lifespan, a simple expression, Eq. (21), for describing the relationship between
the average lifespan (LE0) and body temperature was derived from the new mortality rate
equation. This expression is similar to the empirical formula proposed by Shaw et al (8). As
shown in Fig. 3, the linear relationship of ln(LE0/T) with 1/T is consistent with published
experimental data.
Humans are homeothermic with a core body temperature at 37 ºC. Usually, a living person’s
body temperature is not uniform (45). Research has shown that when room temperature changes
from 35 ºC to 15 ºC, core body temperature can decrease by ~0.7 ºC, and the change in skin
temperature is relatively larger (46). Thus, the change in average body temperature should be
greater than 0.7 ºC when room temperature varies from 35 ºC to 15 ºC. While humans can
normally live at ambient temperature between 15 ºC and 35 ºC without largely life-threatening
risk if they have enough water, food, clothes, and suitable medical services, their average body
temperature may have 1 ºC difference between the people living in a place with an average
temperature of 35 ºC and the people living in another place with an average temperature of 15 ºC.
Provided that the LE0 for humans is 75 years and the temperature coefficient for humans is close
to poikilotherms (~0.12LE0), the 1 ºC difference in body temperature will result in ~9 years
(0.12x75=9) difference in average lifespan under health cold conditions.
Conclusions
The author proposed a new mortality rate function. This mortality equation can explain the
mortality plateau at advanced age and the effect of temperature on lifespan. Several closed-form
analytical expressions have been derived from the new mortality function. Eq. (14) provides a
method for determining δ. The determined δ from 11 developed countries is near a constant in
the past centuries, but shows a continuous increase after 1950-1960. This continuous increase in
δ in the past 50-60 years is consistent with the derectangularization of survival curves in the
developed countries in the same period. The derived Eqs. (16) and (16)´ have the same forms to
the related equations from the Strehler and Mildvan theory of mortality for age x≤δ. The
mortality plateau, as described in Eq. (16)´´, appears when x≥δ . This indicates that the new
mortality rate function can not only explain the mortality and survival data for x≥δ as
demonstrated in Fig. 2, but also is consistent with the previous well-known mortality rate

equations for x≤δ. The derived Eq. (21) defines a linear relationship between ln(LE0) and 1/T,
which is validated by published experimental data. The derived Eq. (22) is the closed-form
expression for temperature coefficient of average lifespan.
Author Contributions
