We study the response of an autoregulated gene to a range of concentrations of signal molecules.
We show that transcriptional leakage and noise due to translational bursting have the opposite
eﬀects. In a positively autoregulated gene, increasing the noise converts the response from graded
to binary, while increasing the leakage converts the response from binary to graded. Our ﬁndings
support the hypothesis that, being a common phenomenon, leaky expression may be a relatively easy
way for evolutionary tuning of the type of gene response without changing the type of regulation
from positive to negative.

INTRODUCTION

Leaky transcription (also called basal transcription)
occurs when there is no tight control over the promoter
and some level of transcription is maintained even when
the promoter is in the off state. To date, the role of transcriptional leakage has been underappreciated. Leaky
expression is most often described as unfavorable from
the point of view of an experimenter [1–3], while little
is known about its evolutionary benefit for cells. An obvious fact is that some basal transcription is necessary
to initiate the positive feedback [4]. Yanai et al. [5] note
that, in general, the selection against “unnecessary” transcription is low and hypothesize that leakiness of the promoters may be evolutionarily neutral [6–8]. On the other
hand, Ingolia et al. [9] put forward a hypothesis that, being a common phenomenon, leaky expression may be a
relatively easy way for an evolutionary conversion of gene
expression from binary to graded and vice versa. They
qualitatively demonstrated in the experiments on yeast
and in simulations that mutations in the PF US1 promoter
sequence entail changes in the basal level of expression of
the autoregulated gene, which produces different expression patterns: unimodal or bimodal.
The effectors (signaling molecules) bind or cause phosphorylation of the transcription factors (TFs) thus changing the strength of gene repression or activation [10–
12]. We define the response to the increasing effector
concentration as graded when the stationary distribution
of responses of individual cells is unimodal for any effector concentration. If bimodal distribution occurs for
any range of those concentrations, then the response is
binary [13, 14]. It became a common knowledge that

positive autoregulation serves as a mechanism of differentiation of the cell population into phenotypically distinct groups [15] (which may increase the chances of survival in a changing environment through the bet-hedging
strategy [16, 17]), while negative autoregulation may be
preferred when a precise response is needed [18, 19].
Let us consider, however, an evolutionary adaptation
from the conditions where binary response was favorable
to the conditions where graded response is more preferred [9]. The evolutionary change of the nature of gene
regulation from positive to negative may be more difficult
than fine-tuning of the parameters of positive regulation,
such as transcriptional leakage, e.g. due to point mutations in the promoter sequence [9, 20].
Self-regulated genes often occur in two-component signaling systems (TCS) [21, 22]. These systems respond to
external stimuli: Signal molecules bind to the membranebound receptors that phosphorylate the TFs, which enables the TFs to bind to the promoter of the target gene.
TCS occur mostly in prokaryotes, and are less common
in eukaryotes. The majority of TCS are positively autoregulated, but not all of them display bimodal expression [22]. Known are the TCS with positive feedback
and a significant basal transcription, e.g.: hrpXY in E.
amylovora [23], CpxR in E. coli [24], V irG in Agrobacterium tumefaciens [25, 26].
Becskei et al. [14] first used the term “conversion
from graded to binary response”, but the conversion in
their engineered tetR gene circuit was obtained by artificially introducing a feedback loop into an otherwise openloop system. Mitrophanov et al. [20] studied numerically and experimentally the positively autoregulated
TCS P hoP/P hoQ in Salmonella enterica with promoter
mutations resulting in different basal expression levels.
They did not test a wide range of stimulus concentrations
but only examined two cases of a low and high stimulus,
and the binary response was not found. It is possible that
these two stimulus levels represented the extreme cases
(near-maximum and near-zero regulation) where the distributions are unimodal, and one should seek for the bimodal response by scanning the intermediate stimulus

2
levels. Mitrophanov et al. [20] hypothesized that different evolutionary niches may favor higher or lower levels
of basal expression and, consequently, different response
levels.
We propose a simple quantitative model (Fig. 1) of an
autoregulated gene that allows one to calculate the conditions for conversion between binary and graded response
without changing the type of feedback. We show the key
role of intrinsic noise and leakage in this “binary-graded”
conversion.

MODEL OF AN AUTOREGULATED GENE

We start from the kinetic scheme shown in Table I
and make the simplifying assumptions, following Friedman et al. [27]: (i) mRNA is short-lived compared to
proteins. This means that our simplified model may be
suitable for average prokaryotic genes but also for a subset of eukaryotic genes. The Escherichia coli proteome
shows insignificant degradation [28] with a protein lifetime longer than the duration of a cell cycle but mRNA
molecules are short-lived on the time scale of a cell cycle
[29]. In yeast, there is a certain percentage of genes that
produce unstable mRNAs [30], and the mRNA stability
in general depends on environmental conditions [31]. At
the same time, a substantial percentage of yeast proteins
are long-lived [32]. For example, the mean ratio kdm /kdp
in budding yeast is > 10 (the median ≈ 3) for the set of
∼ 2000 genes [33], showing that the model assumptions
are widely met in this eukaryotic organism. (ii) The kinetics of TF binding and unbinding is fast enough to be
compressed to the form of the Hill function
H(P ) =

1
,
1 + cP n

where ǫ = kml /km . The function h(P ), which describes
the deviation from the maximum possible transcription
rate due to regulation and leakage, will be called the
transfer function [34]. The deterministic equation for
protein synthesis gives kp M = kdp P at the steady state,
where kp is the protein transcription rate and kdp is the
protein degradation rate. The deterministic stationary
numbers of proteins can be then found by a geometric
construction [34], as the points of intersections between
the transfer function h(P ) and a straight line, H(P )(1 −
1
ǫ) + ǫ = αβ
P , with α = km /kdp and β = kp /kdm . If the
straight line intersects the transfer function more than
once, then the deterministic model is bistable.

(1)

where P is the total number of TFs, n is the cooperativity index, n > 0 for repression and n < 0 for activation.
(iii) The cooperativity is very strong, such that only the
nth power of P is present in Eq. (1). The signal of a certain strength activates a certain fraction of TFs (due to
phosphorylation, as in TCS, or due to binding of signal
molecules). The signal parameter c depends on the fractions of active and inactive TFs as well as on their binding
and unbinding rates to the operator (see Appendix A).
The assumptions (i–iii) are necessary to make the model
analytically tractable.
The operator effectively switches at a high frequency
between the two states, O and OPn , one of which is inactive and the other is active. The operator is active with
the probability H(P ), and then the mRNA is synthesized
at the rate km . Alternatively, the operator is inactive
with the probability 1 − H(P ), and then the leaky transcription proceeds at the rate kml < km . Therefore, at
the steady state, km H(P )+ kml (1 − H(P )) = kdm M . We
write the left-hand side divided by km as
h(P ) = H(P )(1 − ǫ) + ǫ,

EXTREMA OF THE PROTEIN
DISTRIBUTION

Based on the work of Friedman et al. [27] we calculate
the stochastic distribution of P in the autoregulated gene
with exponentially distributed translational bursts. We
note that in [27] the description of leakage in their transfer function, h̃(P ) = H(P )+ǫ, is only correct when ǫ ≈ 0,
or if the parameters are reinterpreted (k̃m ≡ km − kml ,
ǫ̃ ≡ kml /(km − kml ), α̃ ≡ (km − kml )/kdp ; see Appendix
C), since otherwise the probabilities of the active and inactive states of the operator would not sum up to 1. Our
description is the most natural, as the parameters are
simply the reaction rates that follow directly from the
kinetics (Table I). Therefore, the protein distribution in
our model differs from that in [27]:

that α should be interpreted as the maximum mean frequency of translational bursts that can be achieved by
the system in the theoretical limit of c = 0 (see Appendix D). In a certain range of the regulation strength
c, the distribution p(P ) can be bimodal. The conditions
for bimodality can be determined by calculation of the

The geometric construction is almost the same as in the
deterministic case but there appears the noise term 1/α.
It shifts the positions of the extrema with respect to the
deterministic stationary states. Therefore, the noise may
induce a bifurcation in the parameter range in which the
deterministic model does not predict bistability [37]. Interestingly, this noise-induced shift depends on the maximum burst frequency α only, and not on the burst size β.
In the limit of infinitely frequent bursting, the stochastic
term 1/α disappears and the extrema of the protein distribution overlap with the deterministic stationary states.
Therefore, we will use 1/α as a measure of the minimum
noise that can be achieved by the system at the theoretical limit of c = 0.

BINARY AND GRADED RESPONSE TO A
SIGNAL

Using the geometric construction (4), we examine how
the protein distributions behave when the regulation
strength c is varied. The change in c corresponds to the
change in the effector concentration which controls the
strength of gene regulation. To obtain precise regulation,
the gene response should be graded for the whole possible range of c. The following conclusions follow from the
geometric construction (see Appendix E for a detailed
analysis): Transcriptional leakage narrows the range of
regulation. Negative feedback allows for a graded response only, because at most one intersection of L(P )
and h(P ) is possible due to their different monotonicity.
When the feedback is positive, binary response is possible. For ǫ < 1/α < 1, the response is always binary (also
for n = −1, consistently with the results of [27], the case
not predicted by the deterministic model).
Our central result is that transcriptional leakage counteracts the stochastic effect of bursting, by converting binary response into graded response. This is because ǫ > 0
shifts the base of the transfer function upwards, in such a
way that, if the leakage is sufficiently large, it may enable
only one intersection of h(P ) and L(P ). Below, we calculate the condition for the graded response in the general
case of n < 0, when 1/α < 1. We note that for given α

4
and β there exists a value c = c∗ for which L(P ) intersects h(P, c∗ ) in its inflection point. The inflection point
is the point in which h(P ) has the greatest slope, and this
slope increases monotonically as c decreases. Therefore,
if the slope of L(P ) intersecting h(P, c∗ ) in its inflection
point is greater than the slope of h(P, c∗ ), then L(P )
will intersect h(P, c) only once for any c. We write this
condition as:
h(Pp , c∗ ) =

would require multiple mutations (within the TF’s effector binding site and its DNA-binding domain) while
simultaneously keeping the TF function. Our findings
may therefore provide a quantitative support for the experimentally based hypothesis [9, 20] that, being a common phenomenon, leaky expression can be an easier way
of adaptation of the gene response type to different evolutionary niches than the change of the feedback type from
positive to negative.

The above condition says that if the transcriptional leakage ǫ is greater than the threshold ǫthr , then the positively autoregulated gene will produce a graded response.
For the leakage below that threshold, the response will
be binary (Fig. 2). The condition (6) depends only on
the cooperativity n and the maximum burst frequency α,
but not on the burst size β. Since n < 0 for activation,
both the noise and the cooperativity increase ǫthr , which
makes the graded response more difficult to obtain. This
finding is consistent with the experimental observation of
Ingolia et al. [9] that bimodal distributions are found for
low basal expression and high induced expression (which
corresponds to a steeper transfer function).

V.

CONCLUSIONS

The above calculation based on a geometric construction reveals the constructive role of transcriptional leakage in gene regulation: The leakage in a positively autoregulated gene acts against the translational noise as
a factor that controls the conversion between binary and
graded response. While increasing the noise induces binary response, increasing the leakage recovers graded response. However, this conversion is obtained at the cost
of narrowing the range of regulation. Therefore, the leakage can be disadvantageous in the case of negative autoregulation (because the response is anyway graded),
but it can be beneficial in the case of positive autoregulation, when it is needed to prevent the binary response.
Leakage strength can be tuned by single mutations in the
promoter [9], whereas keeping the same direction of the
response after the positive to negative feedback conversion would also require the reversal of the signal effect
on the TF (if a high concentration of signal molecules
strengthened the binding of the activator to the promoter, now it should cause a weaker binding of the repressor). The conversion of the feedback type is thus
a much less probable evolutionary scenario because it

strength. For simplicity, we take the example of n = 1.

fa denotes the active fraction of all TFs, e.g. the fraction
of phosphorylated TFs in the case of a two-component
system (assuming that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates are such that this fraction remains constant on the time scales of other reactions). In the case
of binding of a signal molecule (effector) E, fa = g(E)
is a Hill function describing the effector binding to the
TF (under the assumption that E ≫ P and that the
effector-TF binding and unbinding rates are much faster
than the time scales of other reactions in the system).
For n > 1, H(P ) is constructed in an analogous
way under the assumption of very strong cooperativity. Although mixed terms may appear [e.g. for n = 2,

the subscript denotes binding of the first or the second
TF], they can still be written in the form of P n · const.
And therefore, the coefficient c will still contain the particular binding/unbinding rates and the details of the
TF-effector interactions.

FIG. 3: (Color online) When bursts are rare, α < 1, then
the maximum of the protein distribution p(P ) is always at
Pmax = 0 independently of the leakage rate ǫ and the regulation strength c. This is because there is no intersections between the straight line L(P ) and the transfer function h(P ).
Parameter values are as follows: n = 2, α = 0.8, β = 60,
ǫ = 0.3. Arrows mark the mean values of the shown distributions.
Appendix B: Limiting cases

Note that c = c(fa ) varies between finite values as the
fraction fa varies from 0 to 1. In the case of n = 1, as in

the example (A1), c(fa = 0) = kon

kon /kof f . This means that H(P ) = 0 and H(P ) = 1
are the theoretical limits for an extremely strong or weak
signal when the binding of active TFs is infinitely fast and
the binding of inactive TFs is infinitely slow compared to
unbinding. These two limits correspond to non-regulated
genes [27, 33], i.e. Gamma distributions with the means
αβ and αβǫ.
Appendix C: Reinterpretation of the parameters of
the formula used in [27]

The formula proposed by Friedman et al. [27] to describe the protein distribution produced by an autoregulated gene,
p(P ) = AP α̃(1+ǫ̃)−1 e−P/β H(P )α̃/n ,

(C1)

can be made formally equivalent to our formula (3), if
the parameters of (C1) are reinterpreted.
In our model, the total transcription rate is:
km H(P ) + kml (1 − H(P )) =

where km is the transcription rate in the case when the
operator is in the active state. This is the maximum
possible transcription rate, which can be achieved if the
operator is on all the time. kml is the transcription rate
in the case when the operator is in the inactive state
(leaky transcription). ǫ = kml /km measures the ratio of
the transcription rate in the inactive state to the transcription rate in the active state. The transfer function
h(P ) measures the deviation from the maximum possible
transcription rate due to regulation and leakage.
Friedman et al. use a different transfer function:
h̃(P ) = H(P ) + ǫ̃. The total transcription rate is then
k̃m [H(P ) + ǫ̃] ≡ k̃m h̃(P ).

(C3)

In order to make it equivalent to (C2), one must assume
k̃m = km − kml and ǫ̃ = kml /k̃m . With this interpretation of the parameters, the formulas (C1) and (3) for
the protein distributions will be equivalent, provided that
α̃ = k̃m /kdp , whereas in our model α = km /kdp .
It should be noted that k̃m is not the transcription
rate km shown in the kinetic scheme (Table I in the main
manuscript). Therefore, our notation (without tilde) is
more natural because it follows directly from the kinetics.
At this point, we note that neither the interpretation
of α̃ nor α as “the mean number of bursts per cell cycle”
(as in [27]) is fully accurate. We clarify the interpretation
of α in the next section.

FIG. 6: (Color online) (a) On the contrary to the deterministic model, binary response is possible in the stochastic model
due to transcriptional bursting, even when there is just one

achieved by the system. This occurs in the theoretical
limit of c = 0, i.e. when H(P ) = 1 (see Appendix B
above). The parameter 1/α is then interpreted as a measure of the minimum noise that can be achieved by the
system.
Appendix E: Detailed analysis of the geometric
construction

(1) When the bursts are rare, α < 1, then, for both
negative and positive feedback, the maximum of the protein distribution is always at Pmax = 0 independently
of the leakage rate ǫ and the regulation strength c. In
the deterministic model there always exist values of c at
which a peak occurs at Pmax 6= 0. But the presence of
the stochastic term 1/α > 1 makes it impossible for the
straight line L(P ) to intersect h(P ) for any value of c
(Fig. 3). Varying c makes the distributions only narrower or wider, which varies the mean protein number in
the range (αβǫ, αβ).
(2) Negative feedback allows for graded response only.
When the bursts are frequent, α > 1, there always is one
intersection of L(P ) and h(P ) because of their different
monotonicity. Transcriptional leakage narrows the range
of regulation (Fig. 4): the maximum of p(P ) has the
range Pmax ∈ [max(0, ǫαβ−β); αβ−β], and the mean has
the range hP i ∈ [αβǫ; αβ]. However, when the noise term
1/α > ǫ, then the range of Pmax does not depend on ǫ

(Fig. 5). Therefore, a sufficiently strong noise (long mean
time between random bursts) counteracts the negative
effect of leakage on the range of maxima at the cost of
wider distributions (at a given αβ), but not on the range
of mean values.
(3) When the feedback is positive and ǫ < 1/α < 1,
binary response is always present because there always
is a range of the signal levels in which the protein distribution is bimodal [Fig. 6A]. Note that, consistently
with the results of [27], the bursting term 1/α makes it
possible to obtain binary response also for n = −1 [Fig.
6A], the case not predicted by the deterministic model.
(4) Transcriptional leakage counteracts the stochastic effect of bursting, by converting binary response into
graded response. This is because ǫ > 0 shifts the base
of the transfer function upwards, in such a way that, if
the leakage is sufficiently large, it may enable only one
intersection of h(P ) and L(P ). When the regulation is

positive with n = −1, it suffices that the transcriptional
leakage ǫ > 1/α to obtain graded response [Fig. 6B].
This condition is insufficient when n < −1. In the main
text (Sec. IV), we calculated the condition for graded
response in the general case of n < 0, when 1/α < 1.

Appendix F: Simulation parameters

Reaction rate constants used in the mesoscopic simulations (Gillespie algorithm [38]) of the gene regulation kinetics have been shown in Table II. We model
the signal parameter c as the ratio of effective rate constants (kon,1 ...kon,n )/(kof f,1 ...kof f,n ) for TF association
and dissociation to the binding sites 1..n on the operator.
The effective rates mimic the influence of the effectors or
phosphorylation on the ratio of active TFs.
