Abstract. The two-species population dynamics model is the simplest paradigm
of interspecies interaction.
Here, we include intraspecific competition to
the Lotka-Volterra model and solve it analytically.
Despite being simple
and thoroughly studied, this model presents a very rich behavior and some
characteristics not so well explored, which are unveiled. The forbidden region in
the mutualism regime and the dependence on initial conditions in the competition
regime are some examples of these characteristics. From the stability of the steady
state solutions, three phases are obtained: (i) extinction of one species (Gause
transition), (ii) their coexistence and (iii) a forbidden region. Full analytical
solutions have been obtained for the considered ecological regimes. The time
transient allows one to defined time scales for the system evolution, which can
be relevant for the study of tumor growth by theoretical or computer simulation
models.

1. Introduction
The ecological community is composed by a complex interaction network from
which the removal of a single species may cause dramatic changes throughout the
system. The interactions between species only became better formalized in population
dynamics with the Lotka-Volterra equations, in the 1920’s [1]. This simple theoretical

Verhulst-like two-species population dynamics model

model explains prey-predator behavior and others range of natural phenomena, for
instance, the oscillatory behavior in a chemical concentration in chemistry or in fish
catches in ecology, cells of the immune system and the viral load (in immunology) [2]
econophysics [3] etc.
Besides the predation interaction described by Lotka-Volterra equations, there
are many other different kinds of interaction taking place between biological species.
If species unfavor each other, for instance, when two species occupy the same
ecological niche and use the same resources, there is competition. If species favor
each other, as in pollination/seed dispersion by insects, there is mutualism - also
called symbiosis. If only one of these species is independent of the other, there are
two possibilities: amensalism, if the considered species has a negative effect on the
other; and commensalism, otherwise. As an example of amensalism, consider that an
organism exudes a chemical compound as part of its normal metabolism to survive,
but this compound is detrimental to another organism. An example of commensalism
is the remoras that eat leftover food from the shark. Finally, when species do not
interact at all there is the so-called neutralism.
The Verhulst-like two-species population model incorporates limit environmental
resources, logistic growth of one species in the absence of the other, and interspecific
interaction. It is described by the following equations [1, 4]: dN1 /dt = κ1 N1 (1 −
N1 /K1 + α1 N2 /K1 ) and dN2 /dt = κ2 N2 (1 − N2 /K2 + α2 N1 /K2 ), where Ni ≥ 0,
κi and Ki > 0 are the number of individuals (size), net reproductive rate, and the
carrying capacity of species i (= 1, 2), respectively. The term −κ1 N12 /K1 represents
the competition between individuals of the same species (intraspecific competition),
and −κ1 N1 N2 /K1 represents the interaction between individuals of different species
(interspecific interaction). The carrying capacity represents the fact that both species
are resource-limited. In fact, K1 represents the restriction on resources that comes
from any kind of external factors, but the ones relative to species 2, similarly for
K2 . To use non-dimensional quantities in the Verhulst-like two-species model, write
pi = Ni /Ki ≥ 0, for i = 1, 2. Time is measured with respect to the net reproductive
rate of species 1, τ = κ1 t ≥ 0. Here, we restrict ourselves to the case κi > 0. The scaled
time is positive since we take the initial condition as t0 = 0. Moreover, the two net
reproductive rates form a single parameter ρ = κ2 /κ1 > 0, fixing a second time scale to
the system: τ 0 ≡ ρτ = κ2 t. The parameters α1 and α2 represent the interaction degree
and also the kind of interaction between species. The non-dimensional population
interaction parameters are given by 1 = α1 K2 /K1 and 2 = α2 K1 /K2 , which are not
restricted and represent the different ecological interactions. With these quantities,
the Verhulst-like two-species model become:
dp1
= p1 [1 − p1 + 1 p2 ] = f (p1 , p2 )
(1)
dτ
dp2
= ρp2 [1 − p2 + 2 p1 ] = g(p1 , p2 ) .
(2)
dτ
Contrary to ρ, which has no major relevance to this model (since we consider only
ρ > 0), the product 1 2 plays an important role, so that 1 2 < 0 means predation;
1 2 = 0 means commensalism, amensalism, or neutralism; and 1 2 > 0 means either
mutualism or competition as depicted in the diagram of Figure 1.
The novelty of the present work is two-fold. We give a new interpretation of the
Verhulst-like two-species model, since we do not restrict the interaction parameter
i , as it is usually done in previous studies [5, 6, 7]. This absence of restriction
on the interaction parameters allows us to display many different ecological regimes

(competition, predation, and mutualism) in the same phase diagram, which are
obtained by the steady state solutions [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Nevertheless, we point
out the existence of a survival/extinction transition, as well as a transition for a
forbidden region in the mutualism regime. Also, based on the result of Ref. [14],
we have been able to find the complete analytical solution for this model. From
the analytical solutions, the transient time allows one to establish characteristic
times [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] which can be relevant, for instance for tumor
growth models [23, 24, 25]. Also transient solutions may be used as a guide to
validate numerical simulation algorithms, giving to Monte Carlo time steps a real time
scale [26]. Furthermore the analytical solutions may be used in stochastic theoretical
modeling of two-species systems to give insight when averages are done [27].
The text is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, the steady state solution of the
interspecific competition in the Lotka-Volterra equations is presented. These solutions
correspond to the stable ecological regimes in the parameter space diagram, where we
point out the existence of the survival/extinction transition and of a non-physical
region in the mutualism regime. We show that although our model is simpler, it is
able to reproduce the four scenarios found in more complete tumor growth models.
In Sec. 3, the analytical solutions for the trivial case neutralism and the non-trivial
ones amensalism and comensalism are presented. Next, the full analytical solutions
are obtained for the mutualism, predation, and competition regimes. Our conclusions
are described in Sec. 4.
2. Steady state solutions
To obtain the steady state solution p∗1 = p1 (τ → ∞) and p∗2 = p2 (τ → ∞)
of Equation (1) and Equation (2), we have to impose dp1 /dτ = dp2 /dτ = 0,
which implies f (p∗1 , p∗2 ) = g(p∗1 , p∗2 ) = 0 and leads to p∗1 (1 − p∗1 + 1 p∗2 ) = 0 and
p∗2 (1 − p∗2 + 2 p∗1 ) = 0. One has the following trivial (“t”), semi-trivial (“st”), and
non-trivial (“nt”) pairs of solutions: (i) p∗1,t = 0 and p∗2,t = 0; (ii) p∗1,st = 1 and
p∗2,st = 0 or p∗1,st = 0 and p∗2,st = 1 and (iii) p∗1,nt = (1 + 1 )/(1 − 1 2 ) and
p∗2,nt = (1 + 2 )/(1 − 1 2 ). These asymptotic solutions characterize the system
according to theirstability. Thestability matrix, also called community matrix [1],
∂p1 f ∂p2 f
is: A(p∗1 , p∗2 ) =
. The steady state solutions p∗1 and p∗2 are
∂p1 g ∂p2 g p∗ ,p∗
1 2
stable if the trace and the determinant of the community matrix are negative and
positive, respectively. One has: Tr[A(p∗1 , p∗2 )] = 1 + ρ + (ρ2 − 2)p∗1 + (1 − 2ρ)p∗2 and
Det[A(p∗1 , p∗2 )] = ρ{1 + p∗1 [2 − 2(1 + 2 p∗1 )] + p∗2 [1 − 2(1 + 1 p∗2 )] + 4p∗1 p∗2 }. One must
analyze the possible cases given p∗1 and p∗2 .
2.1. Stability analysis
Let us start with the stability analysis of the trivial solutions of p∗1,t = 0 and p∗2,t = 0,
which means extinction of both species (synnecrosis). One has: Tr[A(0, 0)] = 1 + ρ
and Det[A(0, 0)] = ρ. Since ρ > 0 , Det[A(0, 0)] > 0 but Tr[A(0, 0)] > 1. The pair
of trivial solution is not stable anywhere in the parameter space, so synnecrosis never
occurs in our model.
The semi-trivial solutions are given by p∗1,st = 1 and p∗2,st = 0 or p∗1,st = 0 and
∗
p2,st = 1 and they mean that one of the species is extinguished. Considering the
species 1 extinction, one has: Tr[A(0, 1)] = 1 + 1 − ρ and Det[A(0, 1)] = −ρ(1 + 1 ).

For these solutions to be stable, it is necessary that 1 < −1, regardless of the ρ value.
A similar analysis leads us to conclude that species 2 extinction is stable only for
2 < −1.
The non-trivial solutions p∗1,nt = (1 + 1 )/(1 − 1 2 ) and p∗2,nt = (1 + 2 )/(1 − 1 2 )
lead to: Tr[A(p∗1,nt , p∗2,nt )] = [1 + 1 + (1 + 2 )ρ](1 2 − 1) and Det[A(p∗1,nt , p∗2,nt )] =
−(1 + 1 )(1 + 2 )ρ/(1 2 − 1). On one hand, if 1 2 < 1, the denominator is positive
and the numerator of p1,nt and p2,nt must vanish or be positive. From the condition
(c)
p∗1,nt ≥ 0, this solution is only stable if 1 ≥ 1 = −1; otherwise, p∗1,t = 0 is the
stable solution. This produces a transition from the regime where species 1 coexists
with species 2 to the regime where species 1 is extinguished (Gause transition). The
same transition occurs for the parameter 2 . On the other hand, if 1 2 > 1, the
denominator is positive and the numerator of p1,nt and p2,nt must be non-negative.
(c)
From the condition, p∗1,nt ≥ 0, this solution is only stable if 1 < 1 = −1; otherwise,
∗
p1,t = 0 is the stable solution. This produces a transition from the regime where
species 1 coexists with species 2 to the regime where species 1 is extinguished. The
same transition occurs for 2 .
From the stability criteria, species can coexist only if 1 > −1 and 2 > −1.
According to the values of 1 and 2 , the various ecological regimes may present a
stable non-trivial solution, as in Figure 1.
2.2. Phase diagram
In Figure 1, the stable steady state solutions of Equation (1) and Equation (2) are
represented in the parameter space. This diagram presents the reflexion symmetry
about 2 = 1 and summarizes our findings: the coexistence phase and one species
extinction phase can be seen. These phases span on different ecological regimes, which
means that different ecological interactions may lead to the same phase.
For 1 > −1, 2 > −1, the non-trivial solutions are stable. They span on four
considered ecological regions, around the origin of the phase diagram [see the circle in
Figure 1]. For mutualism, the first quadrant of the diagram of Figure 1, as 1 2 → 1− ,
the mutual cooperation conducts to unbounded growth of both populations, so that
−β
pi,nt ∼ (1 − 1 2 )
diverges with the exponent β = 1 (see Figure 2). The region
2 > 1/1 is forbidden; since p∗i,nt < 0, it does not have ecological reality.
The Figure 2 also tell us that there is a transition between extintion and
coexistence regimes. Keeping 2 fixed, this transition occurs at 1 = c1 = −1. A
Taylor expansion of the non-trivial solution allow us to write p∗1,nt = (1 − c1 )/(1 +


2 ) + O (1 − c1 )2 , whith means that near c1 (the critical point) species 1 linearly
goes extinct, that is p∗1,nt ∼ (1 − c1 ). The critical exponent related to the order
parameter is β = 1 Analogous process happens to the species 2.
For 1 ≤ −1 or 2 ≤ −1 and 1 2 < 1, the remaining regions of the diagram are
characterized by the stability of the semi-trivial solutions. For 1 < −1 and 2 < −1,
differently from all the other regions in the phase diagram, the steady state solutions
depend on the initial condition. There is a separatrix for the initial conditions, in this
region [1].

Figure 1. Diagram of ecological interaction between two species according to the
pair (1 , 2 ). In this diagram, each quadrant represents one kind of interaction:
I:mutualism; II and IV: predation ; III: competition. The abscissa and ordinate
represent either ammensalism or commensalism. The origin represents neutralism.
The non-trivial solutions (1 > −1, 2 > −1, and 1 2 < 1) correspond to the
coexistence phase. In this phase mutalism, comensalism, amensalism, predation,
competition, and neutralism can occur, for instance, around and inside the dashed
circe. The complementary region is characterized by an extinction phase and a
forbidden region. The extinction phase (1 < −1 and/or 2 < −1) reveals a region
for 1 < 0 and 2 < 0 where, contrary to the other cases, the steady state solutions
depend on the initial condition. For 1 > 1 and 2 > 0 and 2 > 1/1 , there exists
a forbidden region with non biological reality (negative number of individuals).

2.3. Cancer modeling
In cancer therapy, tumor-selective replicating viruses offer remarkable advantages
over conventional therapies and are a promising new approach for human cancer
treatment. An oncolytic virus is a virus that preferentially infects and lyses cancer
cells. Theoretical models of the interaction between an oncolytic virus and tumor
cells are attainable using adaptations of techniques employed previously for modeling
other types of virus-cell interaction [2]. A Lotka-Volterra like model that describes
interaction between two types of tumor cells (the cells that are infected by the
virus and the cells that are not infected but are susceptible to the virus so far as
they have the cancer phenotype) and the immune system has been presented by

p∗2,nt = (1 + 2 )/(1 − 1 2 ) of the model [Equation (1) and Equation (2)] as a
function of 1 , keeping 2 = 1 fixed. In these plots one sees two phase transitions.
The first one is the extinction-coexistence (predation) transition, which occurs at
1 = −1. Near c1 , the critical point, the species 1 go to extinction by a linear
form, that is p∗1,nt ∼ (1 − c1 ). The second one is the transition from coexistence
(mutualism) to a forbidden region (with no ecological reality), which one with
critical exponent β = 1.

Wodarz [23, 24]. This model can be written as [25]: dx/dτ = x [1 − (x + y)] − βxy;
dy/dτ = γy [1 − (x + y)]−βxy−δy,where, x and y are the population of uninfected and
infected cells respectively, γ is the ratio between infected and uninfected cells growth
rates, β is related to the interaction parameter between uninfected and infected cells
and δ is related to the rate of infected cell killing by the virus. Using Equation (1),
Equation (2) and making: 1 = −(1 + β), 2 = (β/γ − 1) and γ  δ, one retrieves
Wodarz model. Besides being simpler, our model presents all the qualitative behavior
shown by Wodarz model, i.e. four different scenarios for the asymptotic states: (i)
absence of infected cells, (ii) absence of uninfected cells, (iii) coexistence of both types
of cells and (iv) dependence on initial conditions (all cells infected or uninfected).

3. Model analytical solution
Here we present the analytical solution of the Verhulst-like Lotka-Volterra model. We
start presenting the known solutions when one of the interacting parameter vanishes.
Next we present the solution for the complete model.
3.1. Vanishing of one interaction parameter (1 2 = 0)
This section is restricted to the particular case 1 2 = 0, where one or both interaction
parameters vanish. This corresponds to the axis of the parameter space 2 × 1
[see Figure 1]. Thus, three ecological regimes are allowed in this specific situation:
amensalism: 1 = 0 and 2 < 0 (species 2 extinction, if 2 ≤ −1 and species coexistence
otherwise) or 2 = 0 and 1 < 0 (species 1 extinction, if 1 ≤ −1 and species coexistence
otherwise); neutralism: 1 = 2 = 0; and comensalism: 1 > 0 and 2 = 0 or 1 = 0
and 2 > 0.
In these cases, one can obtain a simple full analytical solutions of Equation (1)
and Equation (2). Below we address each case in more detail.
3.1.1. Neutralism Consider a special case where each population grows independent
from the other. This ecological regime is represented by Equation (1) and Equation
(2), with 1 = 2 = 0, leading to two independent Verhulst models: dp1 /dτ = p1 [1−p1 ]
and dp2 /(ρdτ ) = p2 [1 − p2 ]. The solutions, with different time scales and parameters,
−τ
−ρτ
for each species are [14]: p1 (τ ) = 1/[1+(p−1
] and p2 (τ ) = 1/[1+(p−1
],
1,0 −1)e
2,0 −1)e
where pi,0 = pi (0) is the initial condition for species i = 1, 2.
The Verhulst solutions are driven by different characteristic times τ = κ1 t and
τ 0 = ρτ = κ2 t, respectively. For τ  1, so that ρτ  1, the asymptotic behaviors
p∗1 = p1 (∞) = 1 and p∗2 = p2 (∞) = 1 are obtained, so that species end exploring all
the available environmental resources. The case 2 = 0 in Figure 3 shows the dynamics
of the population given by the Verhulst solutions. For κ2 > κ1 ; i.e., ρ > 1, species 2
grows more rapidly than species 1, given the same initial condition. For κ2 < κ1 ; i.e.,
ρ < 1, the inverse occurs.
3.1.2. Comensalism and amensalism Consider that two species interact asymmetrically. For instance, consider that individuals of species 1 are unaffected by species
2, although, individuals of species 2 are adversely affected by species 1. This is the
amensalism regime. The commensalism regime has the same structure as amensalism,
except that one species is favorably affected by the other. These interactions can be
mathematically represented by the following equations:
dp1 (τ )
= p1 (τ ) [1 − p1 (τ )]
(3)
dτ
dp2 (τ )
= p2 (τ ) [1 − p2 (τ ) + 2 p1 (τ )] ,
(4)
ρdτ
where 2 is negative for amensalism and positive for commensalism.
In this kind of interaction, species 1, described by Equation (3), follows the
−τ
Verhulst model, whose solution is p1 (τ ) = 1/[1 + (p−1
] . The dynamics
1,0 − 1)e
of species 2 follows the time-dependent Verhulst-Schaefer model [Equation (4)], whose
solution is [14]:

e−ρτ [1+2 p1 (τ )] (1 − p2,0 + 2 p1,0 )

(7)

The plots of p2 (τ ) for several 2 values are depicted in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Plots of the solution of Equation (4), given by Equation (7), for
different values of interaction parameter 2 and ρ = 1. The comensalism regime
is obtained for 2 > 0, where the asymptotic value, due to the other species,
is greater than unity. The neutralism regime is retrived for 2 = 0. The
amensalism regime is obtained for 2 < 0, where the asymptotic value does not
vanish (meaning species coexistence) for 2 > −1 and vanishes (meaning species
extinction) for 2 ≤ −1.

The steady state solutions of Equation (3) and Equation (4) are, respectively:
p∗1 = p1 (∞) = 1 and p∗2 = p2 (∞) = 1 + 2 , if 2 > −1 or vanish otherwise. One sees
(c)
that 2 = −1 is a critical value that separates two distinct phases: 2 ≤ −1, where
species 2 is extinguished; and 2 > −1, where species 2 coexists with species 1. The
former case occurs in the amensalism regime, while in the latter one it may occur in
the amensalism (2 < 0), neutralism (2 = 0), or in the comensalism (2 > 0) regimes.

Verhulst-like two-species population dynamics model

The same conclusions are valid for 2 = 0 and 1 6= 0. One finds the same
(c)
(c)
behaviors and a critical point 1 = −1, so that similarly for 1 < 1 species 1 is
extinguished.
3.2. Mutualism, competition and predation (1 2 6= 0)
In the following, we deal with the case 1 2 6= 0, which addresses mutualism,
competition, and predation. If
• 1 2 > 0, each species has the same kind of influence on the other. This
corresponds to either the competition or the mutualism regime. The following
regimes occur:
– 1 > 0 and 2 > 0, mutualism, which corresponds to the first quadrant of the
space parameter phase space, restrict to the region 2 < 1/1 (see Figure 1;
– 1 < 0 and 2 < 0, competition, which corresponds to the third quadrant of
the space parameter phase space (see Figure 1).
• If 1 2 < 0, the predation regime occurs, which belongs to the second and fourth
quadrants of the parameter space (see Figure 1).
(c)

For 2 > 0 and 1 < 0, there is species coexistence for 1 > 1 = −1 and species 1
(c)
extinction for 1 ≤ 1 .
These ecological regimes are special cases of Equation (1) and Equation (2), whose
solutions can be worked out to have the form:
1
e−τ [1+1 p2 (τ )] (1 − p1,0 + 1 p2,0 )
1
=
+
(8)
p1 (τ )
1 + 1 p2 (τ )
p1,0 + 1 p1,0 p2,0
where p2 (τ ) is given by Equation
(5), and the relative populations
sizes mean values
Rτ
Rτ
up to instant τ are p1 (τ ) = 0 dτ 0 p1 (τ 0 )/τ and p2 (τ ) = 0 dτ 0 p2 (τ 0 )/τ .
Using Equation (5) in Equation (8), we obtain a quadratic equation for p1 (τ ),
eliminating its dependence on p2 (τ ). In fact, we can write p1 (τ ) as dependent only
on the initial condition and p2 (τ ). The population size p2 (τ ) behaves analogously.
Thus, the coupling between the two population sizes is given only by the mean values.
The solutions Equation (8) and Equation (5) are presented in Figure 4 for the three
regimes where 1 2 6= 0. As τ → ∞, the steady state solutions of Equation (1) and
Equation (2) are reached.
With the analytical solution, one can access the transient behavior of a given
population. Transient dynamics can be an important aspect of the coexistence of
predators and preys, and also of competitors [15]. Studies of outbreaks (insects or
diseases) focuses greatly on the transient dynamics [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In
tuberculosis treatment for example, it can reveal important aspects beyond asymptotic
states such as how drug resistance emerges [28]. In the present study Figure 4
illustrates the importance of the transient in the time evolution of the species densities.
Consider the case of competition, for τ < 5 species 1 population is greater than species
2, however the steady state solution for this system is just the opposite (species 2
population is greater than species 1). In this case, a simple steady state analysis
would not be coherent with reality if the observation time scale is not appropriate. In
other words, if the observed system has not yet reach equilibrium, the steady state
analysis can be misleading.
Notice that considering 1 = 0 in Equation (8) and Equation (5), one retrieves
the Verhulst solution and Equation (5), and Equation (6), which correspond to the

Verhulst-like two-species population dynamics model

10

amensalism, neutralism, and comensalism regimes. In this way, these evolution
equations can be seen as a general solution that is valid for all kinds of interaction
regime.

Figure 4. Plots of the evolution equations Equation (8) and Equation (5),
which are solutions of Equation (1) and Equation (2). The initial condition is
p1,0 = p2,0 = 1/100 and ρ = 1. The species interaction parameters 1 2 6= 0 so
that for competition: 1 = −1/2 and 2 = −1/10; mutualism: 1 = −1/2 and
2 = −1/10; and predation: 1 = 1/2 and 2 = −1/2.

4. Conclusion
The simple model we addressed here illustrates that one can interpret the interaction of
a two species system at several levels. From the interaction parameters 1 and 2 , which
act at the individual level of species, one is able to tell about the different ecological
regimes, classified in a higher level according to the product of the interaction
parameter 1 2 . If it vanishes, one or two species are independent from each other.
If 1 2 > 0, one has either mutualism (both positive) or competition (both negative).
For 1 2 < 0, one has predation. A collective level is obtained from the stability
of the steady state solution, from where one obtains three phases: extinction of one
species (i < −1) (synnecrosis is not a stable phase in our model), species coexistence,
and a forbidden phase (2 > 1/1 ). Although the studied model has been considered
in several isolated instances, our study reveals the very general aspect of a simple
mathematical set of equations, which represents very rich ecological scenarios that

can be described analytically. In this manuscript we focused on a Verhulst term
for the population growth in the Lotka-Volterra equation. All the results presented
here can be extended using a more general growth model, for instance the Richards’
model [29, 30, 31] and implications of such generalizations will be detailed in a brief
future.
