Many neuronal systems and models display a certain class of mixed mode oscillations (MMOs) consisting
of periods of small amplitude oscillations interspersed with spikes. Various models with different underlying
mechanisms have been proposed to generate this type of behavior. Stochastic versions of these models can
produce similarly looking time series, often with noise-driven mechanisms different from those of the deterministic models. We present a suite of measures which, when applied to the time series, serves to distinguish
models and classify routes to producing MMOs, such as noise-induced oscillations or delay bifurcation. By
focusing on the subthreshold oscillations, we analyze the interspike interval density, trends in the amplitude
and a coherence measure. We develop these measures on a biophysical model for stellate cells and a phenomenological FitzHugh-Nagumo-type model and apply them on related models. The analysis highlights the
influence of model parameters and reset and return mechanisms in the context of a novel approach using noise
level to distinguish model types and MMO mechanisms. Ultimately, we indicate how the suite of measures
can be applied to experimental time series to reveal the underlying dynamical structure, while exploiting
either the intrinsic noise of the system or tunable extrinsic noise.

INTRODUCTION

Mixed mode oscillations (MMOs), composed of welldefined periods of subthreshold oscillations (STOs) separating spikes, appear in biological rhythms, neural dynamics, chemical oscillations, and network oscillators,
with many models proposed to capture this phenomenon
in these and other applications5 . One question in applications is the significance of the STOs – that is, do
the interspike intervals (ISIs) and STOs encode important information for the system (e.g., Refs. 8 or 23). An
element in the answer is identifying the mechanisms that
drive the STOs. A challenge in this identification is that
noisy time series generated by structurally different models can appear hardly distinguishable from each other,
even quantitatively. Experimentally observed behavior
can be captured with different types of models with different noise levels, so that model identification and calibration requires consideration of several classes of models
over wide parameter ranges.
Previous studies indicate that a minimum of three degrees of freedom is necessary to produce MMOs in deterministic models (see examples in Ref. 5), while stochastic
van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo-type models illustrate
how noise can drive MMOs in simple 2D models26,27 .
Similarities in MMO signals often stem from an underlying Hopf bifurcation and canard structure in the system7,26,30 . In periods where the system is in some sense

close to the Hopf bifurcation, STOs can be both supported and disrupted by noise. In these models it is possible to choose parameters so that the MMOs are driven
by the deterministic dynamics, while for other parameter choices the appearance of MMOs relies on stochastic
fluctuations.
While on the one hand noise can make it difficult to distinguish between different models with various routes for
producing stochastic MMOs, it is nevertheless possible
to use noise as a way to identify underlying mechanisms.
In this paper we compare a suite of measures at different
noise levels to extract the structure of the model, and
thus the mechanism for the STOs and MMOs.
The choice of measures is partly motivated by the presence of multiple time scales, an important feature that
allows both well-defined periods of STOs and more than
one mechanism for MMO generation. As described in
more detail in the next section, the common substructure of the models we consider corresponds to a subsystem with a slowly varying control parameter. Depending
on the combination of the other model parameters, that
control parameter can slowly vary through a Hopf bifurcation, in which case the STO-spike transition exhibits
the dynamics of bifurcation delay (Ref. 6 and references
therein). For other parameter combinations corresponding to quiescence in the deterministic system, noise excites subthreshold coherent oscillations with a frequency
near that of the Hopf bifurcation. The weak damping of
these oscillations is due to the presence of multiple time
scales, observed for parameters near a Hopf bifurcation.
These noise-induced STOs are just one type of oscillation
appearing in the context of coherence resonance (CR). In
its broadest sense CR is observed when a range of noise

2
levels excites coherent oscillations in a system that is quiescent without noise, with a maximum coherence at an
optimal noise level. This phenomenon is most commonly
cited for transitions between steady equilibria with large
excursions, such as relaxation oscillations22,28 , but in this
paper it refers to the noise-induced STOs near a HB, also
exhibiting CR-type behavior.
Whether the STOs appear via slow passage through a
Hopf bifurcation (SPHB) or via a CR-type mechanism,
the impact of the noise on the MMOs is concentrated in
the interspike interval (ISI) where the STOs arise and
eventually transition to a spike. It is no accident that
this is also the interval where the slow dynamics are
most prominent, and it is well known that noise can
have a significant impact in such intervals4,12,24 . The
suite of measures used in this paper focuses on the STOs
and the ISI behavior, capitalizing on previous analytical
and computational studies of noise sensitivity of SPHB4
and CR-driven oscillations17,36 . These previous analyses show how noise can enhance or suppress the STOs
through interactions with the fast-slow dynamics inherent in the MMOs, and these characteristics are captured
by the behavior of the suite of measures. Focused on the
noise sensitive STOs in the ISI, these measures can isolate differences between models and identify mechanisms
for the MMOs as noise levels and bifurcation and control
parameters vary.
An additional advantage of these measures is that they
are based on features that are easy to analyze in time
series data, making them amenable for use on experimental and simulated data. Furthermore, recognition of
the multiple time scales of the MMOs suggests ways to
experimentally introduce fluctuations into the system as
a tunable extrinsic noise. When scaled appropriately by
considering the ISI dynamics, this extrinsic noise can be
used to mimic the effects of other intrinsic noise sources.
Then this introduction of noise, combined with the suite
of measures, can be applied both to identify the likely
mechanism for MMOs and limit the variety of models
one must consider for calibration.
Summary of results
We use a combination of amplitude trend, ISI density, and coherence measure based on power spectral density (PSD) to classify and differentiate mechanisms for
MMOs. We compare phenomenological and physiological
models to explore the types of STO and MMO behaviors
that can be captured by simplified or reduced stochastic
models over a range of noise levels. We then analyze these
results within intra-model comparisons to get a deeper
understanding of those MMO characteristics related to
model structure, those dictated by deterministic dynamics, and those driven by noise. We focus particularly on
cases where CR and/or SPHB are key mechanisms. In
the conclusion we give a detailed list of identifying characteristics of MMO mechanisms obtained from this suite
of measures. Understanding the dynamical features reveals the sensitivity in model calibration on bifurcation
structure and on model choice, and illustrates ways that

noise can be used to help to differentiate between models.
For STOs of the CR-type we observe longer tails in
the ISI density together with stronger peaks in the coherence measure vs. noise, and no trend in the average STO amplitude leading up to the spike. In contrast,
SPHB-dominated STOs have different behaviors in all
three measures.
Simplified low dimensional integrate and fire (IF) models can be used to capture some STO and ISI behavior
over a range of noise levels through adjustment of the
speed of the control variable and reset. However, they
can not mimic differences observed from underlying bifurcation structure, particularly in the case where a combination of CR and SPHB are at play.
Models with voltage-dependent control variables can
have a rich variety of underlying deterministic behavior, allowing possibilities for both CR- and SPHB-driven
MMOs. These differences can drive significantly different stochastic behavior in the ISI and PSD behavior as
compared to simple IF models.
Related to this last observation, our analysis also illustrates how refractory dynamics, dynamics following
the spike at the initial stage of the ISI, can influence ISI
density for increasing noise, and disrupt the coherence
of the STOs in MMOs. The influence of the reset or
return mechanism, as well as the underlying deterministic behavior, observed in the measures considered here is
consistent with the influence of these modeling aspects
observed for noise-driven clusters of spikes, that is, repeated spikes without STOs in the ISI19 .
The article is organized as follows: In Section II we
first give a brief overview of two mathematical models in
the literature – one physiological, the other phenomenological – that have been used to explain MMOs in neural
systems, and discuss different mechanisms for MMOs in
these stochastic systems. In the same section we present
a number of different computational measures for analyzing important characteristics of the time series in order to
identify the underlying model structure. In Section III we
generate and classify MMOs with the physiological model
and find matching MMOs generated by the phenomenological model. We then apply the measures to these time
series and provide a set of features that – in combination – make the time series distinguishable. Secs. IV
and V focus on the comparison of time series generated
by the same model with varying parameters, to further
highlight differences in the computational measures that
appear with different model or bifurcation structure. We
also highlight the dramatic effect of weak noise on different families of MMOs that are close in parameter space.
In Sec. VI we outline how tunable extrinsic noise can be
introduced to mimic the effect of intrinsic noise, based
on the inherent multiple time scales and the fact that
the noise impact is concentrated in the ISI. We also illustrate the applicability of our analysis to another MMOgenerating model.

MODELS AND MEASURES

We review the setup and dynamics of two models
whose STO dynamics will be analyzed in this paper: A
detailed biophysical model for MMOs in stellate cells
(‘SC’ model) as well as a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo
model (‘MFN’). The two main MMO-generating mechanisms in these noisy models are slow passage through a
Hopf bifurcation (SPHB) and coherence resonance (CR).
A.

Biophysical model – SC

We consider a biophysical model for the MMOs observed experimentally in the layer II stellate cells of the
medial entorhinal cortex introduced in Ref. 1. It consists of a voltage equation that includes the three usual
Hodgkin-Huxley currents for sodium, potassium and a

1h

V̇ =
C

leak current together with a persistent sodium current
and a hyperpolarisation-activated current. Together with
the dynamical equations for six gating variables, this
model is a system of seven coupled ordinary differential
equations (‘7DSC’), given in App. B.
Since we focus on the STO dynamics, for most of this
paper we analyze a reduced, three-dimensional version
(3DSC) of the full model, introduced in Ref. 30, consisting of only the equations for the voltage and two gating
variables rf and rs (In the equation for rs , we use the
term from the original work1 (see footnote in Ref. 30).).
This 3DSC model provides a good approximation of the
ISI dynamics of the full 7D model30 . Throughout this
article, we refrain from giving units in the equations or
for parameters (see App. B for the original units and parameter values). The three equations considered for the
reduced model are:

ṙs = [1/[1 + exp ((V + 71.3)/7.9)] − rs ] / [5.6/[exp ((V − 1.7)/14) + exp (−(V + 260)/43)] + 1] .

Eq. 1 contains a noise term η(t) representing white
noise, corresponding to fluctuations in the persistent
sodium current. According to Ref. 35, this current gives
the main stochastic contribution in stellate cells, due to
the low number of channels. The model (Eqs. 1–3) is
treated as an integrate and fire (IF) model, where spiking and refractory dynamics of the full (7D) model are
replaced by a reset value once the trajectory of the system
crosses a threshold defined in terms of V . The value of
reset is chosen such that the trajectory is placed close
to a post-spike value of the full deterministic system
(V = −80, rf = rs = 0 as in Ref. 30). The deterministic
(D = 0) version of this reduced model has been analyzed
in detail30,31,34 , and there have been also studies of the
noisy (D 6= 0) case19,30 .
Both the full 7D and the 3DSC deterministic system produce attracting states of either a steady state,
MMOs, or tonic spiking, depending on Iapp . In the 3DSC
model these different long time patterns are observed for
Iapp . Iapp,H ≈ −2.575, −2.575 . Iapp . −2.241, and
Iapp & −2.241, respectively. These values are slightly
shifted in the 7D version of the model, e.g., the Hopf bifurcation value Iapp,H separating steady state solutions
7D
from MMOs lies at Iapp,H
≈ −2.702 when using the alternative Eq. B9 for the dynamics of rs (see App. B).
As discussed in Ref. 30, the 3DSC system can be
viewed as a 2D subsystem in V -rf with slowly varying

(2)
(3)

control parameter rs . In the nondimensionalized version
of the 3DSC model analyzed in Ref. 31, the ratio of time
scales for V and rf is approximately 0.02, with the time
scale for rs even slower than that of rf by a factor of 0.3.
From that viewpoint, Fig. 1 shows the relevant part
of the bifurcation diagram (with fixed Iapp ) of the underlying 2D subsystem with rs treated as the bifurcation
parameter. For the parameters considered, there is a subcritical Hopf bifurcation at rs,H and a canard transition
at rs,c (rs,H ≈ 0.08437, rs,c ≈ 0.08271 for Iapp = −2.45
and rs,H ≈ 0.09241, rs,c ≈ 0.09078 for Iapp = −2.58 –
obtained with XPPAUT10 ).
In the stochastic 3DSC model (D > 0), MMOs are
observed for a broader range of Iapp values than listed
above, generated by two mechanisms: a slow passage
through a Hopf bifurcation and coherence resonance. For
intermediate values of Iapp and noise, mixtures of both of
these mechanisms are observed. One of the purposes of
this paper is to provide measures that characterize and
identify these different mechanisms in various settings.
The top panel of Fig. 1 shows the stochastic dynamics of the 3DSC model when the deterministic dynamics corresponds to a SPHB, or delay bifurcation. The
dependent variable V is attracted to a steady state for
rs < rs,H . As the variable rs slowly ramps through rs,H ,
the full system does not immediately make the transition to spiking. Instead, there is a delayed transition,

Modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model – MFN

In Ref. 26, a FitzHugh-Nagumo-type (FN) model is
given by the following pair of coupled nonlinear stochastic differential equations:
ǫu̇ = u(u − a)(1 − u) − v,
√
v̇ = g(u − b) + 2Dξ(t).

(4)
(5)

We follow Ref. 26 and use ǫ = 0.005, a = 0.9 and
g(x) = 7x2 + 0.08(1 − e−x/0.08 ), chosen to give a ratio
of the time scales of the STOs and the spikes (relaxation
oscillations) that is close to that typically observed experimentally and in the SC model. The parameter b is a control or bifurcation parameter. We refer to this model as
the modified FN model (MFN). Taking a = −1, D = 0,
adding a constant term in Eq. 4 and a v-dependent term
in Eq. 5 yields the general FN model16 . With a = −1,
g(x) = x, b = D = 0 and a simple rescaling Eqs. 4 and 5
are the original van der Pol (vdP) model14 .

as STOs increase gradually about the unstable steady
state. It is well known from previous studies that for
delay bifurcations, or more generally for certain systems
with alternating slow/fast dynamics, certain characteristics of the slow dynamics are exponentially sensitive
to noise. That is, for noise levels above those exponentially small in terms of the parameter of the slow time
scale, the behavior of the slow dynamics is qualitatively
changed by the noise, as has been discussed for examples of delay bifurcations and resonance2–4,15,27 and in
other slow systems12,21,24 . In the example in Fig. 1 the
stochastic model typically has shorter intervals of STOs
as compared with the deterministic model, as even small
noise typically drives faster transitions to spiking.
The example in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 corresponds to STOs of the CR-type. The underlying deterministic system has a steady state corresponding to
rs = rs,0 < rs,H , so STOs are damped. In the stochastic system coherence resonance (CR) occurs when noise
amplifies the STOs in the presence of weak damping (see
Refs. 11, 17, 20, 36 and references therein; note that
this type of CR is different to what is described, e.g.,
in Refs. 22 or 28). These STOs have a frequency corresponding to that of the Hopf bifurcation at rs,H of the
2D subsystem. Results in Ref. 36 indicate that CR drives
STOs in the range of noise levels where coherence is optimal, that is, where the PSD is relatively narrow with
significant power. The analysis in Ref. 36 shows that
the amplification factor of the STOs is inversely proportional to the proximity to the Hopf bifurcation, so that
the STOs are a prominent and prolonged feature in the
ISI for rs near rs,H . Variability in the amplitude of these
STOs yields a nontrivial probability of spiking, leading
to frequent appearance of MMOs, even for Iapp < Iapp,H
if noise is strong enough30 .

large amplitude relaxation oscillations. Depending on the
value of the control parameter b, the deterministic system (D = 0) takes one of three solutions: a stable steady
state for b < bH ≈ 0.31535 where bH is the Hopf bifurcation value, stable small amplitude oscillations (STOs)
for bH < b < bc ≈ 0.31854 with bc the canard value
(see, e.g., Ref. 18), and large amplitude oscillations for
values above the canard value b > bc . As discussed in
Ref. 26, applying noise to this system (D 6= 0) can produce MMOs as noise drives the system between small and
large amplitude oscillations.
The influence of noise on the MMO dynamics of the
vdP model has been studied recently in detail27 , providing scaling relationships between the proximity to the
Hopf value and the noise levels that lead to different types
of behavior. Here we use the model given by Eqs. 4 and 5
as a basis for comparison with the biophysical model for
two reasons. First, the use of g(x) gives control over
the time scale and shape of the spike (see above). The
other important effect that the nonlinearity has on the
system is a shift of the canard point, enlarging the parameter region of stable STOs (i.e., bc −bH ) by a factor of
roughly 1.5. This leads to MMOs with well-defined STOs
over significant parameter ranges even in the presence of
stronger noise values, in contrast to the vdP model studied in Ref. 27. One other difference, compared to the
vdP model, is that the choice of g(x) yields a less abrupt

5

transition from STOs to relaxation oscillations, allowing
for a greater probability of observing spikes with reduced
amplitude, an effect rarely observed in the SC model.
As in Ref. 19 we augment the MFN model (Eqs. 4
and 5) with a slow variation in the control parameter
given by an additional dynamical equation for b. The
presence of a slowly varying control parameter is a feature
common to a number of MMO models including the SC
model, and is necessary to reproduce some of the features
observed in IF models. Additional comments about the
model of Eqs. 4 and 5 relative to the augmented models
are included in Subsec. V A.
The first augmented model we consider is an IF model

This augmentation allows for a comparison of cases where
the dependence of the control variable on u results in
qualitatively different stable behaviors for the deterministic system. Fig. 2 shows the three possible long time
deterministic behaviors (D = 0) depending on the parameter cb , keeping the other constants in Eq. 7 fixed.
For cb > cb,H ≈ 1.53 there is a stable steady state, for
intermediate values 1.04 . cb . 1.53 there are sustained
STOs, and for cb . 1.04 the attracting state is MMOs.
The number of STO periods between spikes depends on
cb and on the other constants in Eqs. 4, 5, and 7. We
refer to this augmentation of the MFN model as nonlinearly augmented modified FN (NLMFN) and in the noisy
version of this model similar patterns as in the SC model
can be observed. For cb > cb,H noise can excite CR-type
STOs and for cb . 1.04 the trajectory passes through the
underlying HB and canard transition thereby displaying
features of the SPHB.

Once the trajectory surpasses uth , b is reset to brs and
we choose to reset u and v such that the system is on the
nullcline (urs = brs and vrs = brs (brs − a)(1 − brs )) or very
close to it (see Subsec. V A for a discussion of the dynamics when reset values are off of the nullcline). This system, which we reference as the linearly augmented modified FN model (LMFN), generates only MMOs within
the parameter values considered. The stochastic LMFN
model exhibits features of both a SPHB and CR, depending on the value of ǫ2 as well as where the trajectory is
reset. This allows for a comparison with simple IF models, highlighting the effect of noise on the dynamics for
different ramp speeds of the control parameter b and reset
values.
The second augmentation of the MFN model considered is a nonlinear u-dependent equation for b(u) with a

Measures

For the analysis of the MMOs and specifically the
STOs in the ISIs, we use a number of measures: ISI
density, amplitude of the STOs preceding a spike, power
spectral distribution (PSD) of the STOs, and a coherence
measure. The time series were generated by numerically
integrating the coupled differential equations given in the
preceeding subsections using a simple Euler-forward routine with constant time step. For the output, it was
ensured that the data was sampled at a high enough
rate 1/∆t, such that the STOs could clearly be identified (40∆t . TSTO ).
The density of the interspike intervals (ISI) was obtained in the following way: In IF-type models (3DSC
and LMFN), ISI duration is measured from the reset to
the crossing of the threshold corresponding to initiation
of the spike. The typically long refractory period without STOs in the 3DSC model was removed. In spiking

where fp is the frequency of the peak in the PSD corresponding to the STOs, hp is its associated maximal
power and ∆f is its full width at half maximum. Since
the different models use different units, a comparison of
the absolute value of β across models was not performed.
For details regarding the computation of the PSD and β,
see App. C.

III. ANALYSIS OF MMO CHARACTERISTICS:
INTER-MODEL COMPARISON

In this section we present an analysis of the characteristics of MMOs with computational measures, focusing on the STOs, produced by the different models as
introduced in Section II. STO amplitude trend before
a spike and average ISI provide a coarse classification of
the MMOs in the subsections below. For each class of behavior the parameters of the 3DSC model are chosen to
produce a type of STO observed in the 7DSC model, and
the parameters for the FN-type models are chosen such
that they reproduce the mean ISI and amplitude trend
similar to the 3DSC. The results illustrate features of the
MMOs that can be reproduced by both the biophysical
and phenomenological models. The measures introduced
in Subsec. II C provide a finer comparison of the three
broad classes. We introduce different noise levels to highlight the mathematical elements of both the underlying

models (7DSC, NLMFN), it is measured as the time between two consecutive crossings of a threshold (i.e., the
time between two spikes including a spike).
To compare the different models (with different time
scales), we measure the ISI duration in TSTO , the approximate mean STO period. For simplicity, we use only
one TSTO for each of the model versions and obtain these
approximately from one time series. We use the following approximate values for TSTO : 3DSC: 107.5, NLMFN:
0.47, LMFN: 0.45, but note that the actual average TSTO
vary by about ±5% among the classes introduced in the
next section. Average ISI duration is used as a coarse
measurement to calibrate FN-type models to the biophysical (SC) model, and the ISI density is used to compare models and parameter choices, including influence
of the noise.
A second characteristic of the STOs used to calibrate
FN-type models to the biophysical model is average STO
amplitude trend before a spike. For this, the maxima
of the low-pass filtered time series were extracted and
averaged over many ISIs (for details see App. C).
To obtain the power spectral distribution (PSD) of the
STOs, the spikes were removed from the time series and
it was ensured that the normalization of the PSD is consistent within each model. From the PSD, we compute a
measure of coherence, namely11

deterministic model and stochasticity that influence the
MMO characteristics.
A.

Class 1: Short ISI, increasing STO amplitude

In Class 1, we analyze MMOs with short ISIs during
which the amplitude of the STOs increases. Examples
for this class of MMOs are shown in Fig. 1 (top panel)
for the 3DSC model and Fig. 3 for the LMFN model.
The comparison of the amplitude dynamics of the STO
and ISI density is shown in Fig. 4, for 3DSC and LMFN,
where the ISI density and mean agree up to a shift due
to different reset conditions. This Class 1 behavior is not
readily reproducible within the NLMFN model where the
choices of cb needed for short ISIs lead to STOs with a
larger amplitude throughout the ISI.
As shown in Sec. II, the underlying dynamics for both
the 3DSC and the LMFN model corresponds to a slow
passage through a Hopf bifurcation. In the SC model, the
increasing amplitude of the STOs are generated when the
system spirals away from an unstable fixed point for rs
values beyond the subcritical HB. In the LMFN model,
the trajectory passes through the underlying supercritical HB at bH followed by an increasing STO amplitude,
with escape from STOs to a spike appearing for relatively
large b (around 0.34) beyond the canard point bc . The
significance of the speed of variation of b in the LMFN
model is discussed further in Subsec. V A.
The noise levels shown in Figs. 1 (top panel) and 3
are among the lowest at which stochastic effects are observed, with the STO dynamics dominated by the deterministic trend of increasing amplitude. Increasing the
noise strengths has very similar effects in both models.
• Typical for a SPHB, increased noise drives an earlier
escape, indicated by shorter ISIs (Fig. 6) and lower average amplitude before escape (Fig. 5). Differences due
to the nature of the underlying Hopf bifurcation (sub/supercritical) are evident only in the amount of reduction of the amplitude of the STOs. This reduction is
more significant in the 3DSC, where the STOs are unstable for the underlying 2D system with rs > rs,H , as

Class2: Long ISI, increasing STO amplitude

Next we analyze STOs appearing in longer ISIs with
a characteristic increasing amplitude before a spike. We
consider two examples from the 3DSC model that have
similar amplitude trends but different ISI behavior in the

compared to the LMFN model, where the supercritical
Hopf bifurcation yields stable STOs for b > bH .
• Increased noise shifts the ISI density to include peaks
at shorter durations, consistent with earlier escape described above. Contributions at longer ISIs are due to a
small fraction of trajectories for which the noise disrupts
the transition and lengthens the ISI. Class 1 behavior
survives only for low to moderate noise levels, as larger
noise regularly eliminates the STOs. This is illustrated
by the considerable spread of both the ISI density and
the PSD (Fig. 7) for large noise levels.
• The coherence measure β is not clearly defined for
MMOs of Class 1, since the strong amplitude trend of
the deterministic dynamics within the short ISI periods
yields PSDs with many well-defined peaks (one of them
at the STO frequency – see Fig. 7). The SC model shows
more peaks due to larger amplitudes of the STOs across
the ISI. The strong peak at low frequencies comes from
the spiking (i.e., thresholding and concatenation).

presence of noise. As discussed in Sec. II the choice of
Iapp for these two examples, Iapp = −2.55 and Iapp =
−2.58, corresponds to different underlying deterministic
behavior, regular MMOs and stable steady state, respectively. We refer to these as Class 2A and Class 2B, respectively.

(bottom panel) and 8 for the 3DSC, NLMFN, and
LMFN, respectively. These time series were calibrated
for similar average amplitude trend and average ISI durations. Fig. 9 shows that for low noise levels, it is possible to find parameter values for LMFN that compare well
in amplitude behavior with 3DSC for both Class 2A and
Class 2B. For NLMFN, the amplitude behavior is similar
to 3DSC for Class 2B but differs in Class 2A for STOs
well before the spike. In the refractory period following
the spike in the NLMFN the system relaxes near but not
on the left null cline with b < bH , yielding slowly damped
STOs in the first part of the ISI. For the LMFN, the reset value for u and v is chosen very close to the fixed
point, avoiding this part of STOs with decaying amplitude. Comparable average ISIs are easily obtained in the
LMFN with ǫ2 chosen an order of magnitude smaller than
in Class 1, and for NLMFN with cb near unity for weak
noise. Differences in the ISI density are apparent from
Fig. 10 and are related to differences in the deterministic
dynamics as discussed in Secs. IV and V.
As we see below, by tuning parameters and noise levels, the FN-type model can capture some but not all of
the amplitude, ISI and coherence behavior for Class 2.
Results for different noise levels point to differences in
the underlying structure of the models.
• For noise levels increased by an order of magnitude,
both subclasses for 3DSC show roughly a 20-30% decrease in the average amplitude of the largest STO immediately preceding a spike, while the FN-type models show
a slightly greater decrease (Fig. 11). For Class 2B, the
entire average amplitude curve of 3DSC shifts to lower

levels with increased noise, while both FN-type models
show both shifts and changes in the average amplitude
curve shape. For Class 2A, both 3DSC and LMFN show
an increase of the average amplitude of STOs well before the spike for increased noise, indicating STOs driven
both by CR and by SPHB. For the NLMFN model, the
return sets b < bH following an earlier spike, so that the
combination of damped STOs for b < bH and CR effects
yields robust STOs with less variation with noise level
than for for the LMFN model.
• In Class 2B, the 3DSC model has longer tails in the
ISI density for both small and intermediate noise levels.
These longer tails are not seen in the FN-type models due
to differences in the underlying deterministic dynamics
(see Sec. IV). For weak noise, the multi-modal ISI density for the NLMFN is due to the stronger attraction
to the underlying deterministic MMO or STO dynamics, with larger STOs initially in the ISI. In the LMFN
model the reset onto the nullcline avoids damped STOs
initially in the ISI, allowing a unimodal ISI density. For
both Class 2A and 2B, 3DSC and LMFN show a shift
to shorter ISIs and a similar shape of the ISI density for
larger noise, with a larger variance for LMFN in Class
2A. For NLMFN there is no shift in the ISI density with
increased noise, just an increased variance both for Class
2A and 2B, reflecting the dynamic return mechanism following the spike.

In the top row, middle panel, values for large p are cut off.

• Fig. 13 shows the differences between the coherence
measure β (Subsec. II C) for the three different models
for various noise levels. For 3DSC in Class 2B the STOs
are driven by CR and there is a peak in β (indicating
CR), while for Class 2A noise reduces β in general, since
the STOs are driven by a SPHB. For low noise levels in
NLMFN, the robust STOs are represented by a multipeaked PSD (equivalent to the ISI density – see above),

for which β is not defined. For larger noise levels in Class
2, β is defined, but noise only disrupts the underlying
STOs, so β decreases with noise. For LMFN, a moderate noise level can enhance the STOs, particularly at
the beginning of an ISI, yielding an optimal noise level
for coherence in both types of Class 2. The influence
of the underlying bifurcation structure on the coherence
measure is discussed further in Sec. IV.

Class 3: Long ISI, constant average STO amplitude

Here we analyze STOs with an average ISI similar in
length to Class 2, but with a constant average amplitude
preceding a spike. Fig. 14 shows the trajectories from the
3DSC, NLMFN, and LMFN calibrated for similar average amplitude behavior and average ISI duration. Class
3 can be observed in 3DSC only at higher noise levels
compared with Classes 1 and 2.
Fig. 15 shows that the average STO amplitude for
Class 3 is constant for at least the last ten periods of
STOs with a slight amplitude increase in transition to
the spike. This nearly constant average amplitude results from strong variation in amplitude with a constant
ensemble average. A clear single peak in the PSD (data
not shown) confirms well-defined STOs with variability
in phase and amplitude.
The amplitude and average ISI characteristics of these
MMOs are readily reproduced with the FN-type models

at stronger noise levels with the average amplitude lower
by roughly a factor of two compared to Classes 1 and 2.
Class 3 behavior can also be obtained for the MFN model
(Eqs. 4 and 5) with constant control parameter b as in
Ref. 26. The ISI densities shown in Fig. 15 are similar
to each other, with a slightly more significant tail in the
ISIs for 3DSC.
Figs. 16 and 17 show the trend of the STO amplitude
and the density of ISI when noise levels increase.
• For stronger noise the increase in amplitude directly
before the spike in the FN-type models is eliminated,
with stronger noise levels rather than deterministic dynamics dominating the transition to spikes. At higher
noise levels, distinguishing stochastic fluctuations from
regular STOs is less dependable, so that the amplitude
dynamics for the largest noise levels are not shown in
Fig. 16. In the 3DSC model, there is a slight increase
in average amplitude during the ISI which is due to our
algorithm (Subsec. II C) not fully eliminating the trend
of increasing V in steady state with increasing rs for
rs < rs,H .

• The ISI densities for 3DSC and LMFN are more concentrated at shorter ISI durations, while the ISI density
for NLMFN remains spread over a large range of ISIs.
This is due to the underlying stable STOs for NLMFN,
together with the nonlinear return mechanism that typically returns b to values well below bH following a spike,
thus allowing for a range of ISI durations. With the
ISI density concentrated at low values, clustered spikes
are more frequent in 3DSC and LMFN with nearly tonic
spiking at the higher noise level (cf. Ref. 19).
• For Class 3, β for the 3DSC model shows a similar
behavior as for Class 2B (Fig. 13), with a clear maximum.
The values of β in Class 3 are lower than in Class 2 for
3DSC, mainly because of smaller amplitudes of the STOs
(being inversely proportional to the distance from rs,H for
CR36 – also see Subsec. II C). Similarly, the trend for β
in Class 2B and 3 is the same in LMFN. For the NLMFN
model, the value of cb is the same for Class 2B and Class
3 and the behavior of β is shown in Fig. 13.

IV. INTRA-MODEL COMPARISONS FOR STELLATE
CELLS

The comparisons in the previous section point to the
role of the underlying bifurcation structure on the characteristics of the STOs and MMOs. We summarize the results for the 3DSC model from Sec. III, comparing within
that model. We also discuss alternative values of Iapp for

the 7DSC model in order to compare with previous studies of the full model.

A.

Comparison for different ranges of Iapp

Within the 3DSC model (and similarly the 7DSC
model) differences in the stochastic behavior can be related to the differences in the deterministic behavior for
different ranges of Iapp . For Iapp < Iapp,H ≈ −2.575
in 3DSC (see Subsec. II A), the stable steady state has a
value of rs = rs,0 well below rs,H . For Iapp > Iapp,H there
is no steady state for the deterministic system, and the
STOs are driven by SPHB with rs as the slowly varying
control parameter. In the case Iapp ≈ Iapp,H , characteristics of both CR and SPHB are observed.
• Amplitude: For Iapp well below Iapp,H , rs,0 is well
below rs,H , so only high noise levels can drive MMOs,
and STOs are purely of the CR-type without any trend
in the average amplitude (as in Class 3). In contrast in
Class 1, with Iapp clearly above Iapp,H the STOs due to

the SPHB have an increasing trend in amplitude before
the spike. Well-defined periods of STOs survive only for
lower noise levels, as the slow passage is sensitive to very
weak noise. For values of Iapp closer to Iapp,H , as in
Class 2, both CR and SPHB can affect the dynamics,
so that periods of STOs with increasing amplitude trend
can survive over a large range of noise levels.
• ISI density: Significant differences are seen at lower
noise levels, where longer tails in the ISI density correspond to STOs of the CR-type, not observed in STOs
driven by SPHB.
• Coherence measure β: CR-driven STOs in Class 2B
and Class 3 are responsible for the more pronounced peak
in the coherence measure β in Fig. 13.
Intermediate values of Iapp = −2.5, −2.65 were also
analyzed (not shown), and as expected intermediate behavior between the three classes is observed. For Iapp =
−2.5, STO and ISI behavior was closer to that of Class 2B
than Class 1, without contributions to longer ISIs, and
for intermediate to larger noise levels very weak coherence is observed with a mild peak in β around D ≈ 10−5 .

Families of MMOs for Iapp > Iapp,H at weak noise

Here we consider the effect of noise on MMO families
7D
in the full 7DSC model in the range Iapp > Iapp,H
(i.e.,
within the regime of deterministic MMOs), as illustrated
through the ISI density. The 3DSC model shows a similar
behavior, with a shift in the values of Iapp . Recall that
7D
for any fixed Iapp > Iapp,H
≈ −2.702, the underlying deterministic dynamics is a slow passage of rs through rs,H .
We restrict our study to very low noise levels and consider trajectories that fit into Classes 1 and 2A (Sec. III)
when stronger noise is added. For the sake of comparison with the analysis in Ref. 34, we use an alternative
equation for the dynamics of rs . Instead of Eq. 3, we
use Eq. B9 given in App. B, which alters the numerical
values of the model but not the qualitative features.
Fig. 18 shows examples of the ISI density for different
families of MMOs. The 1s families (for notation, see
Ref. 34) have MMOs with s STOs in each ISI, yielding
ISI densities with a single point mass. The MMOs for a
second, more complex family, Ji (Jj )l , have an ISI with
i STOs followed by l ISIs each with a different type of
j STOs that increase in amplitude and period for each
of the subsequent l ISIs. The Ji (Jj )l families then have
1 + l point masses in the ISI density. We consider only
those MMO families that are stable in the deterministic
model. In the range −2.55 < Iapp < −2.4 stable 1s

or many of these solutions. Then it can be difficult to
distinguish between complex deterministic solutions like
the Ji (Jj )l families and a noisy trajectory sampling a few
different MMO families.

As in the SC model, the underlying bifurcation structure and deterministic behavior influence the source and
characteristics of the STOs. For the FN-type models, the
underlying bifurcation is a supercritical Hopf, with stable STOs in the 2D reduced system for u-v with constant
bH < b < bc .

and Ji (Jj )l families are found for alternating ranges of
Iapp . For Iapp . −2.55, the stable solutions are only
1s families densely filling the space in Iapp 34 . The time
series analyzed earlier as Class 1 in this notation would
be a mixture of 12 and 13 .
For values of Iapp near the center of the stability
range for a particular type of MMO, well separated from
other families, weaker noise broadens the ISI density
and stronger noise shifts the density towards shorter ISIs
when noise drives an early escape typical in a slow passage through a HB, as shown in Fig. 18 for J0 (J1 )1 . The
bottom panel of Fig. 18 shows that for values of Iapp near
the edge of a stability range, very weak noise can lead to
a mixture of close families of MMOs. As noise drives a
faster escape to spiking the peak corresponding to the
longest ISI and largest STO of J0 (J1 )4 is reduced as the
nearby MMOs of J0 (J1 )3 occur, appearing as stronger
nearby peaks in the ISI density. There is also considerable sensitivity in the ISI density when stability ranges
are small and densely packed. Noise can drive a sampling
of a mixture of families close in terms of the bifurcation
parameter, yielding clearly defined peaks that are not
present in the deterministic case, as shown in Fig. 19. In
the top panel, the deterministic MMO is 11 , and noise
excites a second peak for a family 12 or a mixture of
families between 11 and 12 . At Iapp = −2.66 the stable
solution is 112 and weak noise drives a sampling of the six
nearby MMO solutions 1s with 10 ≤ s ≤ 15. At stronger
noise the longer ISIs are lost and the ISI density spreads
out and shifts towards shorter ISIs.
In conclusion, even very weak noise can alter the dynamics of a MMO-generating system significantly, partic-

Linearly augmented modified FN model

In the LMFN model with appropriate reset the slowly
varying control variable sweeps through an underlying
HB and canard transition, which always yields MMOs
in the deterministic setting. We consider two aspects
of the control parameter that can be varied to change
the characteristics of the STOs, the rate of change in
b, ḃ = ǫ2 , and its reset brs , following a spike/threshold
crossing.
In the different classes studied in Sec. III, we analyzed
four different combinations of ǫ2 and brs : slower variation
in b given by smaller ǫ2 = 0.00055, with reset brs < bH
(Class 3) or brs ≈ bH (Class 2B), and larger values of
ǫ2 = 0.001 (Class 2A) and ǫ2 = 0.0147 (Class 1) both
with brs ≈ bH .
1.

Characteristics for ǫ2 , brs in Section III

The main underlying feature that influences amplitude
dynamics for these different parameter combinations, is
time spent in the parameter range b > bH . • Amplitude increase is more pronounced for low noise levels and
smaller values of ǫ2 . For low noise levels, the system
follows the underlying STO dynamics, less likely to be
driven to spiking by noise. For smaller values of ǫ2 , the
control parameter behaves almost as a constant relative
to the oscillation frequency. This allows attraction to
larger STOs for slowly increasing bH < b < bc , with the
possibility of reaching values of b > bc before spiking,
so that larger amplitudes are typical before escape. For
larger values of ǫ2 , as in Class 1 or Class 2A, b increases
through the STO region less slowly. Then the trend of
increasing amplitude consistent for bH < b < bc survives
but increased variation in b limits the attraction to the
stable STOs as b approaches and exceed bc . The behavior
is closer to a series of transients that is more susceptible

to noise-induced escape to spiking. For larger noise levels, the escape to spiking is noise-driven in or near the
stable STO region. An increase in STO amplitude farther from the spike, for b ≈ bH is observed due to the role
of CR together with the stable STOs. An earlier escape
limits the opportunity for amplitude increase closer to
the spike.
• The relation between ǫ2 and brs and ISI density is
as expected: smaller values of ǫ2 or brs lead to greater
likelihood of longer ISIs.
• The coherence measure β shown in Fig. 13 increases
for long stretches of large amplitude oscillations, and decreases with fluctuating amplitude. Trajectories with the
reset close to the HB brs ≈ bH show the largest value of β
for moderate noise levels. Slower variation in b in these
cases also reduces fluctuation in amplitude, thus increasing coherence. For reset brs < bH there is fluctuation
in amplitude due to oscillations driven by both CR and
STOs, so β is reduced somewhat overall. For larger values of noise coherence is destroyed in all cases.

Fig. 20 shows the analysis of an additional parameter combination, a very slow sweep through the HB and
reset before the HB (ǫ2 = 0.0001, brs = 0.305), whose
coherence measure β was included in Fig. 13.
• The difference in amplitude dynamics for lower and
higher noise levels is as described above. For lower noise
levels and very slow dynamics of b, the system is attracted
to larger amplitude STOs before spiking, so that larger
amplitudes are typical for more STOs before escape.
• The ISIs are very long, and only for stronger noise are
they comparable to Class 3 (cf. Fig. 15). In contrast to
Class 2, only for stronger noise levels is the ISI density
concentrated at shorter ISIs, since the trajectory takes
longer to reach bH .
• The shape of the curve β vs. D is qualitatively similar to the classes studied in Sec. III. However, at very
low noise values, β is larger than other cases, caused by
CR-driven STOs and slower variation in b as described
above.
The last panel in Fig. 20 shows the ISIs for an intermediate case, with larger ǫ2 and brs < bH . The ISI density
then shows characteristics between Class 2 and Class 3,
with a narrow ISI density for smaller noise levels, and
longer tails for stronger noise, as oscillations of the CRtype appear for b < bH .
We add one additional note about resetting off of the
nullcline. The choice of reset used in Sec. III (reset very
close to the nullcline), can be relaxed to a reset near
the nullcline without qualitative changes in the measures
used above. A choice of reset away from the nullcline
modifies the amplitude dynamics of the STO at the beginning of the ISI. For reset with brs well below bH , STOs
with considerable amplitude follow the reset and relax as
b approaches bH , similar to NLMFN. For Classes 1 and

2 this increased amplitude supports an earlier escape to
spiking and reduced ISIs, particularly in Class 1. For low
noise levels in Class 2 the ISIs are then narrower, since
the larger STOs are less susceptible to small noise. For
Class 3 the stronger noise dominates, so that variation in
the reset has limited effect.
As noted in Subsec. II B, the model of Eqs. 4 and 5 has
a larger distance between bH and bc , as compared with
vdP, yielding a larger region in parameter space where
well-defined periods of STOs are observed in the presence of noise. This behavior is confirmed by comparisons
of PSDs for MFN and for a rescaled version of vdP to
effectively increase the canard value. This comparison
illustrates that the distance between bH and bc plays a
critical role in the robustness of STOs and MMOs, in
addition to the reset and ramp speed.

In Sec. III we have considered only those values of cb

SC model. Here we also discuss cases that differ qualitatively from those studied in Sec. III, and compare the amplitude, ISI density, and coherence measure within this
model.

Intermediate values: cb = 1.3

The attracting deterministic behavior for b consists of
small oscillations midway between bH and bc , so characteristics include some elements from Class 2 for smaller
noise, and similarities to Class 3 and cb = 1.5 (see below)
for larger noise:
• The amplitude dynamics is similar to Class 2 for
lower noise, with a weaker increase.

9

p

Values of cb ≈ 1

Values of cb = 0.95 and cb = 1.1 were used in Sec. III to
approximate Class 2 behavior. For cb = 0.95 the underlying deterministic dynamics is MMOs, with b regularly
crossing bc . Then the observed measures are consistent
with a slow passage through a Hopf bifurcation and canard point as observed in the other models:
• Increasing amplitude before the spike over a range of
noise levels.
• Multi-peaked ISI density for lower noise levels and
concentrated ISI density for larger noise.
• Decreasing trend in β, defined only for larger values
of the noise.
For values of cb < 0.95 the return value of b following a
spike takes values between bH and bc , thus shortening the
ISI significantly. As discussed above, we do not classify
this behavior as Class 1, since the return value yields
larger amplitude STOs and limited increase for low noise
levels, similar to those observed for a related model in
Subsec. VI B.
In contrast, for cb = 1.1, the deterministic system
exhibits stable STOs where b oscillates near bc . The
stochastic behavior is similar to that of the case with
cb = 0.95, but differences due to the underlying deterministic dynamics are observed for lower noise levels and
cb = 1.1:
• Increased noise drives an earlier escape to spiking.
This results in a reset of b < bH , yielding both CR-type
and SPHB-driven oscillations, and a limited opportunity
for amplitude increase just before the spike.
• The ISI density is broader for cb = 1.1 (compared to
cb = 0.95).

Large values of cb = 1.5, 1.6

For larger values of cb , the attracting state of the deterministic system takes values of b near bH . For cb = 1.6
the long term deterministic behavior is quiescent with
the steady state corresponding to b just below bH . For
cb = 1.5 the deterministic system has stable STOs, with
small oscillations in b just above bH . To drive MMOs
in either of these cases, noise must be strong enough to
cause excursions beyond the canard transition at bc , certainly stronger than in the cases for cb ≈ 1 above. ISI
and amplitude measures can therefore only be derived
for these stronger values of noise, leading only to Class 3
MMOs with the following characteristics (Fig. 21):
• Primarily constant trend in average amplitude before
a spike.
• Broad ISI density with long tails.
• A clear difference between cb = 1.5 and 1.6 due to
the underlying deterministic dynamics is seen in the coherence measure β (Fig. 13). For cb = 1.5 all noise levels
disrupt the coherence of the STOs produced deterministically, so that β strictly decreases with noise. For cb = 1.6,
β has a maximum indicating an optimal noise level typical of CR-driven oscillations28,36 .

APPLICATION TO OTHER MODELS
The 3DSC model with noise in Iapp

The stochastic nature of the SC system results from
noise in ion channels and noisy external signals. The
model we consider above follows Ref. 35, including the
primary noise source in the gating variable of the persistent sodium channel. Here, we compare our results with
those obtained with a different noise source in the 3DSC
model, namely, in the applied current Iapp . The consideration of this additive noise is motivated by several
factors. First, systems with multiple time scales often
can be divided into regions of time or space where noise
plays a more or less significant role. This raises questions about where or when noise plays a critical role, and
whether the type of noise can make a significant difference. Second, since Iapp is the only variable in the system
that can be easily experimentally controlled, this raises
the question of whether varying Iapp can be used as a controllable input to probe the dynamics. Providing noisy
input is a technique used in experimental neuroscience
(e.g., Ref. 25) to investigate the structure of the complex dynamics. Finally, understanding whether different
types of noise sources have similar or different effects contributes both to the understanding of the mechanism for
the dynamics and to model identification.
To test whether fluctuations in Iapp can reproduce dynamics similar to those generated by noise in the persistent sodium current, we consider the voltage equation in
the interval near the end of the ISI, when the dynamics of
V is slow. This is the stage at which STOs are generated
for parameters near the Hopf bifurcation of the reduced
system. In that part of the cycle, V can be approximated by a constant V0 in Eq. 1. This approximation
suggests that even though the noise is parametric, at the
end of the ISI when the STOs are generated, the noise
behaves as additive noise to leading order with a coefficient D′ ≈ (0.15Gp (V0 − ENa ))2 D and Eq. 1 can be
approximated by

Eq. 9 can be interpreted
as having a noisy applied current

instead of the original noisy gating variable. Then one
would expect that the effects of different noise levels on
the STOs as described in Sec. III could be reproduced
by varying the noise level in Iapp , as long as the results
are scaled in a manner consistent with Eq. 9. Indeed
for the ranges of noise levels considered in this paper,
the results for stochastic Iapp are essentially the same
as described in the classification of Sec. III. With the

above scaling, the plots for the coherence measure β (as
in the top panel of Fig. 13) overlap almost perfectly. We
also reproduced similar behaviors of the ISI density and
amplitude dynamics as analyzed for the 3DSC model in
Sec. III (data not shown).
B.

A self-coupled FN-type model

Here, we analyze another MMO-generating model, a
self-coupled modified FN model derived and used for the
study of coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons7,33 . Similar to
the MFN model presented earlier, v represents a voltage
variable, h is gating variable, and s is a dynamic coupling
between neurons. Compared to Refs. 7 and 33, we add a
noise term in the first differential equation:
√
v̇ = − 0.5(v 3 − v + 1) + h − γsv + 2Dξ(t)
(10)
ḣ =ǫD (2h + 2.6v)
ṡ =βH(v)(1 − s) − ǫD δs.

(11)
(12)

H(v) is the Heaviside function. This system of differential equations has multiple time scales similar to the
models analyzed so far: the dynamic variable s plays the
role of a slowly varying control parameter, decreasing
and passing through a HB at sH for the underlying v-h
system. Also, the spikes are included in the model (not
just a threshold and reset) but this is done using a sharp
switch (H(v)) rather than a smooth nonlinear function
for the control variable as in our NLMFN. The parameters used in Ref. 7 are as follows: coupling strength
γ = 0.5, activation rate β = 0.035, slow time scale of
the relaxation oscillations ǫD = 0.015, and δ = 0.565
regulating the speed of the dynamic coupling. Ref. 7 analyzes the deterministic (D = 0) dynamics of the system
in detail. By varying the parameters in Eqs. 10– 12, in
particular δ and D, we find MMOs according to the classification scheme of Sec. III. We choose ǫD = 0.01 and
γ = 0.9 to obtain a sharper canard transition, similar to
the MFN models analyzed earlier. There are a number
of differences between Eqs. 10–12 and the MFN model.
The slow variation of s is nonlinear, slowing down significantly in the SPHB, a behavior somewhat similar to b
in the NLMFN case with cb = 1.5. Another noticeable
difference between Eqs. 10–12 and the MFN models is
that the dynamics of s yields a return value well below
the Hopf point sH following a spike. After the return
there is a significant interval during which s approaches
sH , which has implications for both the amplitude and
ISI behavior.
Class 1 time series are obtained with δ = 2.5 and
D = 10−7 , yielding both the amplitude dynamics and
the ISI density similar to those shown in Fig. 4. One
difference for the model of Eqs. 10–12 is that increasing
noise strength typically increases the amplitude of the
STOs before a spike. This is consistent both with the
slowing of s near sH and with the opportunity for CRtype STOs in the interval where s > sH . As in Class

1, we see the appearance of new well-defined peaks in
the ISI density with low noise levels. For this particular
choice of parameters, the first of these new peaks appears
at longer ISIs, similar to the behavior in the upper panel
of Fig. 19 for the 7DSC model.
For time series with the characteristics of Class 2, we
find δ = 0.3 and D = 3 × 10−6 in Eqs. 10–12 yielding
dynamics comparable to Sec. III in terms of average ISI
and amplitude trend (Fig. 23). For the STOs well before the spike, an increase of the amplitude results from
the algorithm that subtracts the average v as v has a decreasing trend. The amplitude before the spike increases
with noise level, once again due to the combination of
CR-driven STOs before s crosses sH , and a slowing of s.
Larger values of D shift the ISI density towards smaller
values and broadens it, yet a certain minimal ISI is maintained due to the return of s well beyond sH . The effect
of such a return mechanism was also observed in the ISI
density in the NLMFN.
Reduced speed of s (δ = 0.17) combined with stronger
noise (D = 3 × 10−4) leads to time series that fit into our
Class 3. The amplitude dynamics is very similar, but the
ISI density is different from those shown in Fig. 15. At
this noise level, the ISI density is still centered around 15
TSTO , again due to the return of s well above sH . Only
for the highest noise levels considered (D = 3 × 10−3 ) the
noise drives an early escape, reflected in the ISI density
concentrated at shorter ISI lengths.
In Fig. 24 we show the coherence measure β for the
two parameter sets used for generating Class 2 and Class
3 time series. As with the earlier analyses, obtaining β
for Class 1 time series is not possible due to a multipeaked PSD. For Classes 2 and 3, we neglect a strong
peak in the PSD resulting from the concatenation and
compute β as in previous examples. There is a weak
peak in β at intermediate noise levels, consistent with
previous examples that exhibit MMOs related to both
CR and SPHB. In Eqs. 10–12 this combination of STO
mechanisms results from the return of s and its slower
variation near the HB.

CONCLUSION

Attention towards oscillatory neural dynamics has expanded to include coherent subthreshold oscillatory activity in the voltage of some neuron classes as well as
spikes9 . Combined, the sequence of subthreshold oscil-

19
lations (STOs) followed by a spike comprises a class of
mixed-mode oscillations MMOs. As these MMOs have
been recognized more frequently in both experimental
and modeling settings there is an increasing challenge
to distinguish between different MMO-generating mechanisms. For stochastic systems there are additional routes
for MMOs that include noise-induced oscillations and
transients that are sustained with noise.
In this article, we analyzed MMOs of this type both
in a biophysical model for the dynamics of stellate cells
and in augmented versions of phenomenological FN-type
models. Our analysis focuses on the STO part of the signal where the slow dynamics are prominent and noise has
the greatest impact on the STOs. In both model types we
observe signatures of two distinct oscillation-generating
mechanisms: slow passage through a Hopf bifurcation
(SPHB) and noise-induced coherent oscillations with frequencies close to that of the Hopf bifurcation. The latter
of these appears in certain types of coherence resonance
(CR).
For noise levels that are in the range of what is observed experimentally, features of the underlying deterministic models can be hidden or transformed in the
stochastic time series. A further complication in identifying the MMO mechanism in stochastic models is that
substantially distinct models can easily be tuned to produce very similar time series. Then model calibration
based on time series alone must search through a larger
parameter space or range of stochastic models needed for
real world data.
We use a suite of measures to be able to distinguish between different MMO- and STO-generating mechanisms
in the presence of noise, differentiating between the types
of underlying models as well as analyzing the influence
of certain general model parameters. Identifying possible
MMO mechanisms in this way limits the broad range of
parameter or model space for finding appropriate MMO
mechanisms or calibrating a biophysical model. Furthermore this type of comparison can also identify appropriate classes of reduced models, with appropriate stochastic
behavior over a range of parameters, to be used to approximate a full biophysical model. Such reduced models
are used both for simplicity and for computational speed
within larger modeling frameworks, as, e.g., in Ref. 13.
The suite of these measures was chosen to focus on the
STOs in the ISI, where noise has the greatest impact on
the character of the MMOs. We show that the measures
can also be used to exploit the noise to identify the route
to the MMOs. Given the variety of routes to MMOs,
more than one such measure is needed, and we use three
distinct measures (interspike interval, trend of the STO
amplitude and noise-dependent coherence). While the focus of these measures is on bifurcation parameters, noise
levels, and slowly varying control parameters, we found
that these measures also reveal information about the refractory behavior or reset in the models. Furthermore,
we have focused on using an approach that can easily
be applied to time series, so that it can be used in both

experimental and simulation settings.
We summarize the main characteristics obtained from
these measures for different MMO generating mechanisms.
STOs of the CR-type have distinct features in these
measures in comparison with those dominated by SPHB:
1. MMOs driven primarily by the deterministic behavior of SPHB display a strong trend in increasing STO
amplitude, while those driven by CR have a weaker trend
or no trend at all, for average amplitude.
2. For small noise ISI densities are highly concentrated
for families driven by SPHB, in contrast to the STOs of
the CR-type that have ISI densities with long tails. For
larger noise values, these ISI densities are more similar
and may depend on the return mechanism (see items 7–9
below).
3. The coherence measure has a clear optimal noise
level for CR-driven STOs. PSDs are typically multipeaked for SPHB for smaller noise, so that a coherence
measure is not well defined for small noise. For larger
noise values, the coherence measure for SPHB is strictly
decreasing.
While each model has a HB for the underlying 2D subsystem, differences in the criticality of these bifurcations
can be observed depending on the underlying attracting
deterministic dynamics.
4. For STOs dominated by SPHB, an increase in noise
level typically drives a greater reduction in STO amplitude before the spike for a subcritical HB than a supercritical HB, since the latter has attracting STOs.
5. The underlying deterministic dynamics influence
different behaviors of β as a function of noise level. Systems with a supercritical HB may have underlying attracting behavior of small oscillations that can support
increased coherence. This type of deterministic behavior
is typically not seen for subcritical HB.
6. For STOs dominated by SPHB in the subcritical
case, even very low noise levels can drive a sampling from
a variety of MMO families, together with a shift and
spread of ISI values, making it difficult to distinguish
from MMOs driven by other mechanisms.
In addition to identifying features related to noise level
and bifurcation or slowly varying control parameters,
we identified a number of additional behaviors that are
related to the reset or refractory dynamics following a
spike.
7. Reset and rate of increase of the control parameter
in the simple IF model can be varied to capture the amplitude and ISI behavior of the different classes of time
series in the physiological model. However, a simple IF
model may not have the flexibility to capture different
behaviors of the coherence measure.
8. For the dynamic voltage-dependent control parameters, an early escape to spiking can translate into a lower
return value. In that case the ISI density does not shift
with larger noise but is just less concentrated. This behavior distinguishes it from IF-type models with a fixed
reset or models where the return mechanisms are inde-

20
pendent of the spike.
9. For return mechanisms with limited damping of
STOs following the spike, the coherence measure shows
only a decrease in the coherence measure or no welldefined coherence over the ISI.
One important element in these comparisons is that
characteristics of the time series, captured by the suite
of measures, can change in distinct ways when the noise
level is varied. A direct way of varying noise levels in
neuroscience experiments is by injecting a noisy current.
Recognizing that the noise has its greatest impact in the
ISI where the slow dynamics are prominent leads to the
proposal that tunable extrinsic noise can be introduced
through an applied current to mimic the effects of the
intrinsic noise. We show that this is indeed the case with
an appropriate scaling of the noise in the physiological
model.
The distinctions between model features highlighted
by these measures have been observed in an additional
measure related to spike clusters, repeated spikes without STOs in the ISI19 . There it was shown that the
dynamic return mechanism of NLMFN, where an earlier
spike can result in a reset value farther from the HB, can
result in more robust STOs in the ISI, consistent with
the ISI density behavior of NLMFN. The spike cluster
frequency increases much more dramatically with noise
for systems with SPHB-driven STOs, as compared with
the case where STOs are CR-driven, consistent with the
amplitude and ISI density results observed here. Also,
small perturbations in the reset value can translate into
a large increase in spike cluster frequency in stochastic
systems, particularly where the STOs are SPHB-driven
for an underlying subcritical HB.
Our analysis in this paper is focused on a specific type
of MMOs, namely a combination of small amplitude oscillations and spikes relevant for neural systems. We have
proposed measures that are focused on characteristics of
MMOs that are particularly sensitive to the noise, due
to the presence of multiple scales. This suggests that
understanding the presence of multiple time scales and
noise-sensitive characteristics of the underlying bifurcation structures would provide a solid basis for identifying
measures that characterize MMOs in broader or more
generic settings.

The parameters used throughout this article are as follows:

Eh = −20; ENa = 55; EL = −65; EK = −90.

Equivalent to Ref. 30 and what we did in the 3DSC model

The right hand sides of Eqs. B7 (Eq. 3) and B9 are very
similar within the relevant parameter ranges of rs and V
with the only noticeable deviation at very small values
of V (between −80 and −70). The qualitative features
of the reduced 3DSC model therefore are not altered.
Here, we use Eq. B7 throughout the paper, except for
Subsec. IV B, where we replace Eq. B7 by Eq. B9 for the
sake of comparability with the analysis in Ref. 34. We
refer to the respective footnote in Ref. 30 for a discussion.

Appendix C: Details for the measures used to characterize
MMOs
1.

Amplitude trend before a spike

First, the data (time series) was low-pass filtered by
convolving it with a triangle function (e.g., Ref. 32) of
a length that is on the order of half a STO period. A
simple algorithm then finds the spikes, chooses a window
before each spike, removes the average and finds the local
maxima in each window going backwards in time. The
amplitude at each consecutive maximum before a spike
is averaged over all ISIs in the time series. In this analysis the choice of the low pass filter (‘triangle length’) is
crucial, to avoid reduction of amplitudes or miscounting
of the order of the maxima resulting from the time scale
of the filter being too short or long.

2.

Power spectral distribution

For the spiking models, spikes were removed from the
time series by deleting data points corresponding to a
typical spike duration (including recovery) after the respective variable (V or u) crossed a certain value. In
the IF-type models, a similar but much shorter stretch
of data was removed. The remaining data points were
concatenated. Typically, PSDs computed from the full
time series (including spikes and recovery) show significant power in broad frequency ranges that differ strongly
between different models due to the different shapes of
the spikes. Removing the spikes makes the power contribution of the STOs more clearly visible. To remove
low frequency content in the PSDs, the average of the
time series was removed. The routine spctrm from numerical recipes29 was used to compute an estimate of the
PSD. The normalization is such that the total power in
the PSD is equal to the mean squared amplitude of the

time series. Our ‘standard’ PSD for the MFN models
is obtained from time series sampled at ∆t = 0.02 with
a Bartlett window of size 4096 data points with overlap29 . The ‘standard’ PSD for the SC models is obtained
from time series sampled at ∆t = 2.5 with the same window function. For time series sampled at a different ∆t,
we scale the PSD accordingly. We scale the PSDs such
that the frequencies are expressed in 1/TSTO (see Subsec. II C).
3.

Coherence measure β

To compute the coherence measure β according to
Eq. 8, we obtain the relevant values of the PSD by fitting a non-normalized Cauchy-Lorentz distribution to the
peak of the PSD corresponding to STOs.
The fit is generally good for intermediate and strong
values of noise. For weaker noise values the PSDs are
often multi-peaked making it difficult to obtain a meaningful coherence measure. The coherence measure β has
units of the PSD (squared unit of the considered variable
when using TSTO as a time scale) and depends strongly
on the sampling rate of the original time series and the
windowsize of the PSD-estimator. It is therefore difficult
to compare absolute values of β between time series with
different units, scales and sampling rates.
