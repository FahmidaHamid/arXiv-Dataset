Theoretical models that describe oscillations in biological systems are often either
a limit cycle oscillator, where the deterministic nonlinear dynamics gives sustained
periodic oscillations, or a noise-induced oscillator, where a fixed point is linearly stable
with complex eigenvalues and addition of noise gives oscillations around the fixed
point with fluctuating amplitude. We investigate how each class of model behaves
under the external periodic forcing, taking the well-studied van der Pol equation as an
example. We find that, when the forcing is additive, the noise-induced oscillator can
show only one-to-one entrainment to the external frequency, in contrast to the limit
cycle oscillator which is known to entrain to any ratio. When the external forcing is
multiplicative, on the other hand, the noise-induced oscillator can show entrainment
to a few ratios other than one-to-one, while the limit cycle oscillator shows entrain to
any ratio. The noise blurs the entrainment in general, but clear entrainment regions
for limit cycles can be identified as long as the noise is not too strong.

Biological systems present us with a wide range of oscillators, which include
cell cycles, circadian rhythms, calcium oscillations, pace maker cells, and protein
responses, but it is often a challenging task to identify the minimal models
behind these oscillations. The proposed models are typically categorized into
two classes: (i) Limit cycle oscillator, where fixed points are linearly unstable and
the oscillations are described by stable limit cycles sustained by nonlinearities
of the system which are deterministic. Noise can be added on the top of the
deterministic oscillations. (ii) Noise-induced oscillator, where the fixed point is
linearly stable for the system without noise and the system relaxes to the fixed
point with damped oscillations when temporally perturbed. Addition of noise
to this type of system is known to show sustained oscillations with fluctuating
amplitudes. We propose a way to distinguish the two, by using the phenomenon
of entrainment to a periodic perturbation. Taking the van der Pol equation with
noise as an example, we show that entrainments to all the rational ratios are seen
only in the limit cycle oscillator. In the case of the noise-induced oscillator with
additive external forcing, the oscillator can entrain only at one-to-one ratio,
meaning that the entrainment to other than the one-to-one ratio is the sign
of the dominance of the limit cycle mechanism. When the external forcing is
multiplicative, we find that the noise-induced oscillator with weak nonlinearity
can show some entrainment ratios other than one-to-one, but not all the ratios.

INTRODUCTION
Biological systems present us with a bewildering fauna of oscillators: cell cycles1 , cir-

cadian rhythms2–5 , calcium oscillations6 , pace maker cells7 , protein responses8–14 , and so
on. Sometimes, however, it is hard to see what are the minimal models behind these oscillations. Typically, the models are categorized into two classes: (i) Limit cycle oscillator:
The fixed point is linearly unstable and the oscillations are described by stable limit cycles
sustained by nonlinearity of the system in the deterministic case11,12 . Noise (e.g. molecular
noise due to limited number of copy numbers) can be added on the top of the deterministic oscillations. (ii) Noise-induced oscillator: The fixed point is linearly stable for the
system without noise and the system relaxes to the fixed point with damped oscillations
2

when temporally perturbed. Addition of noise to such a system is known to show sustained
oscillations with fluctuating amplitude13,14 . For some systems, both limit cycle oscillators
(i) and noise-induced oscillators (ii) are proposed as a mechanism for the oscillation11–13 .
Here, we propose a way to distinguish the two, by using the phenomenon of entrainment to
a periodic perturbation.
It is well known that, when an periodic perturbation is added to a deterministic limit
cycle, the system’s oscillation frequency ω will be entrained to the external frequency Ω
with various rational numbers of frequencies ω/Ω = P/Q for all positive integers P and Q
in a finite window of the external frequency Ω, where the width of the window depends on
the amplitude of the external forcing15,16 . Entrainment, also called mode-locking, has been
observed in variety of physical systems during the last decades, from onset of turbulence17 ,
Josephson junctions18,19 , one-dimensional conductors20 , semiconductors21,22 and crystals23 .
It has been predicted, and verified experimentally, that the mode-locking structure possesses
certain universal properties15,16 . In biological systems, entrainment has been investigated
theoretically for circadian rhythms4,5 as well as in model systems for protein responses25 .
Experimental observation of entrainment in biological systems is often rather difficult due
to noisy signals, but it has been observed for circadian rhythms2,3 and synthetic genetic
oscillators24 .
In this paper, we study the difference in the entrainment behavior for the limit cycle
oscillators and noise-induced oscillators.

Our main question is the following: Can we

distinguish the two cases by means of the entrainment behavior? We employ the famous
van der Pol equation with noise as an example, because there we can easily study both cases
by changing parameters. We show that entrainments to all the rational ratios are seen only
in the limit cycle oscillator. In the case of the noise-induced oscillator with additive external
forcing, the oscillator can entrain only at one-to-one ratio, meaning that the entrainment to
other than the one-to-one ratio is the sign of the dominance of the limit cycle mechanism.
When the external forcing is multiplicative, we find that the noise-induced oscillator with
weak nonlinearity can show some entrainment ratios other than one-to-one, but not all the
ratios.

To confirm the generality of the entrainment behavior for the limit cycle system

under weak noise, we also study a biological example, the TNF-driven oscillating NF-κB
system, and confirm that P/Q entrainments can be seen.

MODEL

A.

van der Pol equation
Consider the following two-dimensional equation with noise:
ẋ = F (x) + σΓ,

with


x=

x1 (t)
x2 (t)





,


F (x) = 

Γ=

(1)

Γ1 (t)
Γ2 (t)


,

x2 (t)
−(Bx1 (t)2 − d)x2 (t) − x1 (t)

(2)

.

(3)

Here, d, σ, and B are parameters, and Γi (t) are uncorrelated, statistically independent
Gaussian white noise, satisfying
hΓj (t)i = 0,

hΓj (t)Γk (t0 )i = δj,k δ(t − t0 ).

(4)

First let us consider the deterministic case, σ = 0. The model has a fixed point at
(x1 , x2 ) = (0, 0), and the eigenvalues around this fixed point are
λ± =


√
1
d ± d2 − 4 ,
2

(5)

indicating that the system experiences a Hopf bifurcation at d = 0. When d < 0, the
fixed point relaxes to the fixed point with damped oscillation with the angular frequency
p
ω` (d) = |d2 − 4|/2, while when d > 0 and B > 0 the model shows a stable limit cycle (van
der Pol oscillator).
In the stochastic case with σ > 0, however, the system shows a sustained oscillation even
in the linearly stable case, d < 0, because the noise keeps activating the oscillation with
frequency ω` . This is the case of the linear p53 model introduced in Ref.13 . When d > 0,
σ > 0 adds fluctuations on top of the stable oscillation around the limit cycle.

B.

Setup
We investigate the entrainment behavior of the model, focusing on the following three

classes of parameter sets.
4

1. The limit cycle oscillator, with d > 0 and B > 0.
2. For the noise-induced oscillator, we consider the two subcategories.
(a) The linear system with a stable fixed point, with d < 0 and B = 0, i.e., the
equations are linear in x and the fixed point is stable.
(b) The nonlinear system with a stable fixed point, with d < 0 and B > 0, i.e., the
fixed point is linearly stable but the equations possess a nonlinear term.
When noise-induced oscillators are studied, normally only linear terms are considered. However, in reality, there are often nonlinear terms, which can play a role when distance from
the stable fixed point |x| is sufficiently large. This is the reason why we consider both linear
and nonlinear noise-induced oscillators.
When needed, numerical integration of stochastic differential equations are performed by
using Euler method.
Figure 1 shows the typical behavior of the model in each categories. The parameters
are chosen so that the period and amplitude are in similar range. Without noise, the limit
cycle is the only case with stable oscillation (Fig. 1a), while linear and nonlinear systems
with a stable fixed point exhibit damped oscillations relaxing to the fixed point (Fig. 1bc).
When noise is added, the oscillation is perturbed for limit cycle oscillator (Fig. 1d); here
the noise level is chosen so that the base oscillation is still recognizable. For linear and
nonlinear noise-induced oscillators (Fig. 1ef), we observe oscillations with the expected
angular frequency (ω` (−0.1) ≈ 1). In order to demonstrate the difference between the two,
we apply the exact same sequence of noises in both cases. We observe a bigger difference
when linear noise-induced oscillator have large (|x| ≈ 1) amplitude, because the nonlinear
term becomes more important. Naturally this effect depends on the value of B (data not
shown).
We study these oscillators under the following two kinds of external periodic perturbation.
a.

Additive forcing. The first case is an additive forcing, in the form of
ẋ = F (x) + σΓ + A(t),

with


A(t) = 

5

0
A

(6)


 cos Ωt,

(7)

b.

Multiplicative forcing. The second case is an multiplicative forcing (also called para-

metric forcing), in the form of
ẋ = F (x) + σΓ + M(t)x,
where


M(t) = 

0 0
M 0

(8)


 cos Ωt.

(9)

In the next section, we first present the behavior of the model under the additive forcing,
and then show the parallel results for the multiplicative forcing.

RESULTS

A.

Additive forcing

1.

Linear case
In the case of the additive periodic forcing to a linear deterministic system, we have in

general
ẋ(t) = Lx(t) + A(t),

(10)

where L is a coefficient matrix of the linearized equation, and A(t) is periodic function in
time with a period T , satisfying A(t + T ) = A(t).
P
By expressing x(t) = dj=1 Cj (t)uj , with using eigenvectors uj of the matrix L given by
Luj = λj uj , we can show that in the long-time limit we have

Note that <(λj ) < 0 because the fixed point x = 0 is stable. Fn is defined by the Fourier

where

v tj

is the left eigenvector. Therefore the solution will always be a periodic function

of t with the period T in the long time limit, and contains only the frequencies that the
external forcing has. In other words, the system will be always in a 1/1 entrained state if
the perturbation is pure sine or cosine wave.
6

When Gaussian white noise is added to eq. (12), we have
ẋ(t) = Lx(t) + A(t) + σΓ(t).

(12)

In this case, we can evaluate the auto-correlation of Cj (t) for large enough t0 (t0 >> 1/|<λj |)
as

Namely, the response contains oscillations with the frequencies from forcing 2π/T and from

Numerical results
We now investigate numerically the entrainment behaviors for all three categories. First

we demonstrate the behavior without noise, and then show how the noise modify this behavior.
a.

Without noise. Figure 2 illustrates typical entrainment behaviors for additive forc-

ing when noise is absent. With a limit cycle oscillator (Fig. 2 a, d), the system’s angular
frequency can entrain to the external angular Ω with various ratios, while in the linear system, one-to-one entrainment occurs (Fig. 2 b, e). The nonlinear system shows very similar
behavior to the linear system, where we see only one-to-one entrainment (Fig. 2 c, f).
In order to define the system’s angular frequency in a simple way, we adopt the polar
coordinate (r, θ) using
x1 (t) = r(t) cos θ(t),

(14)

x2 (t) = r(t) sin θ(t),

(15)

as proposed in Ref.26 . We define θ(t) so that (θ(t) − θ(0))/2π gives the winding number,
i.e., how many times the orbit went around the fixed point by time t. The system’s angular
frequency is numerically calculated from
ω=

1
[θ(T ) − θ(0)]
T

(16)

for long enough T (typically 1000 times external forcing period). With this definition, Fig.
2(a) shows the entrainment of the ratio ω/Ω = 2/1, while Fig. 2(d) gives ω/Ω = 1/2.
7

b.

With noise. The addition of noise blurs the entrainment behavior, as depicted in

Fig. 3. For the limit cycle oscillator (Fig. 3a and d), we can see that the noise makes the
orbit irregular, which can make the phase to slip. In the linear noise-induced oscillator for
small external angular frequency, we can clearly see that the noise induces the oscillation
with angular frequency close to ω` on top of one-to-one entrainment behavior (Fig. 3b), as
expected from the auto-correlation eq. (13). When Ω is larger than ω` , the external angular
frequency is more visible, because the noise σ is small compared to the amplitude A for
this case, though both frequencies should be present. The nonlinear noise-induced oscillator
behaves again very similar to the linear case in entrainment behavior (Fig. 3c and f). The
visible difference is a suppression of large amplitude by the nonlinear term.
c.

”Devil’s staircase” and ”Arnold’s tongues”. For deterministic limit cycles, the plot

of ω/Ω vs Ω for a fixed amplitude of external forcing shows a infinitely complex structure
with fractal nature, known as Devil’s staircase15,16,26 . For the present system of limit cycle
oscillator without noise, this is also observed as shown in Fig. 4(a) (solid line). As noise
increases, the phase slips occasionally, therefore narrow entrainment regions become harder
to recognize (Fig. 4a, dashed and dotted line). For the systems with a stable fixed point,
there is only one-to-one entrainment for the no noise case (Fig. 4b, solid line), while noise
induced oscillation around the entrained solution will add some phase slips giving a change
in the angular frequency when the entrainment is not so strong, resulting in an escape from
the one-to-one ratio as shown in Fig. 4(b).
When entrainment regions for various values of ω/Ω are plotted in the A-Ω plain, it gives
an “Arnold’s tongue” structure for the deterministic limit cycles: The entrainment regions
widen as the external forcing amplitude A grows, resulting in tongue-like shapes of the
entrainment region – when A is large enough the tongues start to overlap15,16 . This can be
seen in the limit cycle oscillator without noise in Fig. 5 (a). When noise is added, the phase
of the oscillator sometimes slips, resulting in narrower tongues (Fig. 5 b). For the noiseinduced oscillators (i.e. with a stable fixed point), there exists only 1/1 entrainment without
noise, and with noise 1/1 entrainment is the only case that gives the tongue-like structure,
both for the linear and nonlinear cases (Fig. 5 cd). We see other ratios of entrainment
”regions”, because for a given A with changing Ω, ω/Ω changes continuously outside of the
entrainment region (e.g. Fig.4 b).

B.

Multiplicative forcing

1.

Linear case without noise
We next consider the multiplicative forcing
ẋ(t) = Lx(t) + M(t)x(t),

(17)

M(t + T ) = M(t)

(18)

where the matrix M(t) satisfies

with T = 2π/Ω. It is known from Floquet theory27 that the solution matrix of this equation
is expressed as
Q(t) = eΛt U(t),

(19)

U(t + T ) = U(t),

(20)

where

and a general solution is the linear combinations of column vectors consisting of Q(t). The
eigenvalues of the matrix Λ, called Floquet exponents, determine the stability of the solution:
The solution will converge to the fixed point when the real parts of the Floquet exponents
are all negative, and diverges if some Floquet exponent have positive real parts. Therefore,
no entrainment behavior will be observed for a linear noise-induced oscillator without noise
under multiplicative forcing.
In Fig.6, we show numerically calculated the maximum real part of the Floquet exponents
λR for (17) with (9) with d = −0.1 and B = 0, as a function of amplitude of forcing M
and external frequency Ω. When λR < 0 (dark blue region), |x| will exponentially decays
to zero, otherwise |x| will diverge except for the marginal case λR = 0.

2.

Numerical results
a.

Without noise. Figure 7 shows the entrainment behaviors for multiplicative forcing.

For the limit cycle oscillator (Fig. 7 ac), there is no qualitative difference from the additive
noise case, i.e., the system shows entrainment with various frequency ratio ω/Ω = P/Q. For
the linear system with a stable fixed point without noise, on the other hand, the system
can either decay to the fixed point (Fig. 7 b) or diverge (Fig. 7 d), which can be predicted
9

from the Flouquet exponents (Fig.6). When nonlinear term is added, it does not prevent the
decay (Fig. 7 c), but the divergent behavior is suppressed and system shows the entrainment
behavior (Fig. 7 f). The frequency ratio ω/Ω is not necessarily 1/1; the example in Fig.
7(f) gives ω/Ω = 3/2.
b.

With noise. When noise is added, the behavior changes drastically in the noise-

induced oscillators, as shown in. Fig. 8. The noise can induce the oscillation with the
angular frequency close to ω` for the case where the no-noise system would decay to the
fixed point (Fig. 8 b, c). On the other hand, in the linear noise-induced oscillator, adding
noise does not prevent divergence (Fig. 8 e). For the parameters where no-noise system
would entrain, the noise blurs the entrainment due to occasional phase slip for both limit
cycle oscillator (Fig. 8 ac) and nonlinear noise-induced oscillator (Fig. 8 f).
c.

”Devil’s staircase” and ”Arnold’s tongue”. We also study the ”Devil’s staircase”

for the multiplicative forcing. For the limit cycle oscillator without noise, we again see
proper devil’s staircase, where noise will blur the entrainment behaviors (Fig.9 a). For the
noise-induced oscillators, only the nonlinear case is studied because the linear case may
diverge depending on the parameter values. Without noise, we see discrete finite regions
of entrainment (Fig.9 b squares), while noise induces the oscillations in the decaying region
resulting in a continuous line (Fig.9 b dashed line).
The Arnold’s tongue structure for the limit cycle is similar to those in the additive forcing
case, as seen in Fig.10(a) and (b). The Arnold’s tongues for all the entrainment ratios are
observed without noise, and noise makes the regions smaller. For the nonlinear system with
a stable fixed point without noise, there are entrainment regions for a few rational ratios, but
the ones that appear are problem specific - for instance, in the present case, the ω/Ω = 1/3
is not observed at all in Fig.10(c). With noise (Fig.10d), the entrainment regions shrinks,
but at the same time the system can occasionally pass the given ratio of ω/Ω, resulting in
narrow line of “fake” entrainment.

IV.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE: ENTRAINMENT OF TNF-DRIVEN NF-κB

SYSTEM
In this section, we study a biological example, TNF-driven NF-κB system, to confirm the
generality of the entrainment behavior for the limit cycle system under weak noise.
10

The system has been studied for the deterministic case in ref.25 . NF-κB is a transcription
factor, and it has been verified experimentally that NF-κB level in the nucleus shows sharp
oscillations after treatment with tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)33,34 . The interaction network
involves a negative feedback loop between the NF-κB and an inhibitor, IkBα, which is the
main mechanism for the oscillations. TNF modulates the state of the IkBα and hence affects
the oscillation. TNF can be added externally to the cell, therefore it can serve as a possible
probe to study the entrainment, i.e., we can use TNF level as the external forcing term. In
ref.25 , the system was modeled by 5 dimensional coupled nonlinear ODEs,
dx
= F (x, [T N F ]),
dt
where
F1 = kN in (Ntot − x1 )

F5 = ki x4 − kp x5
kA20 + A20 [T N F ]

(23)
(24)
(25)

The variable x1 denotes the nuclear NF-κB level, and [T N F ] denotes the TNF level, which
we shall change to a periodically external forcing onto the system. The biological meaning
of the variables and parameter values are summarized in Table I. Note that [T N F ] appears
twice in eq. (25) in the terms multiplied with x, therefore this is an example of multiplicative
forcing. We study this system with adding a Gaussian white noise in each term, i.e.,
dx
= F (x, [T N F ]) + σΓ.
dt

Figure 11(a-c) shows the spontaneous oscillation of nuclear NF-κB, when [T N F ] is kept
constant at [T N F ] = 0.5, without (a) and with noise (b-c). We see clear periodic oscillation
with the period around 110 (minutes). We then modulate the [T N F ] level around this basal
level25 as
[T N F ] = 0.5 + MT N F sin(Ωt).

(26)

This has been studied in the no-noise case by Jensen and Krishna25 , and it was found that
the entrainments of various ratios can occur, when the frequency of the NF-κB level is
11

determined based on the frequency of the peaks. Figure 11(c) shows an example of 1/2
entrainment, for MT N F = 0.05 and Ω = 0.0297, in the deterministic case. With weak
enough noise, the entrainment is maintained (Fig. 11e), but larger noise induces phase slips
(Fig. 11f), as has been seen in the Van der Pol system.
In Fig. 12, several Devil’s staircases are shown with and without noise. In Ref.25 the
Arnold tongues have been calculated, and it has been demonstrated that general P/Q entrainments occur. A characteristic observation to this system is that the tongues overlap
easier for larger external frequency; e.g., MT N F ≈ 0.04 for 1/3 and 1/2 tongues to overlap,
while the 2/1 and 5/2 tongues do not overlap even at MT N F = 0.1. When the Devil’s
staircase are calculated for overlapping region, non-smooth or irregular jumps between the
steps can be seen, and is thus dependent on initial conditions in general. This is visible in
our data in Fig.12, for large MT N F and larger Ω. When weak noise is added, it enables the
system to jump to other overlapping tongues, which results in irregular behavior around the
entrainment regions. As the noise becomes larger, the entrainment is again smoothed away
by phase slips.

V.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Our motivation behind this work was to ask: Can one by applying an external periodic

forcing and studying entrainment determine whether an oscillating system is driven by a
linear mechanism (noise induced oscillator) or a non-linear mechanism (limit cycle oscillator)? Our answer to this question is generally yes. Our obtained results on entrainment
behavior of oscillators are summarized in Table II.
When the forcing is additive, there is clear difference between the limit cycle oscillators
and the noise-induced oscillators. The former can entrain to any frequency ratio, while the
latter shows only one-to-one entrainment. Therefore, if one see entrainment to P/Q 6= 1
ratio, under additive forcing, it is a sign of limit cycle oscillator.
When the forcing is multiplicative, the non-linear noise-induced oscillators can also show
P/Q 6= 1 ratio entrainment, but not necessarily all of the rational ratios. If the system
is noise-induced oscillator and the non-linear term is small, one might be able to capture
the diverging tendency of the amplitude, because saturation happens when the amplitude
is large enough to make the non-linear term relevant. In such a case, one might see big
12

difference in amplitude for a fixed M with varying Ω.

We thus urge experiment to be performed on oscillating biological systems. It is well
known that some proteins (p53, NF-kB, Wnt) can oscillate in cells under stress responses.
In the case of p53, both non-linear11,12 and linear models have been proposed13 . By applying an external time dependant signal such as DNA damaging radiation or drugs which
specifically perturb the p53 circuit, it might be possible to entrain the internal oscillation
and draw conclusions on the basis of our results summarized in Table II. In the case of
NF-kB oscillations, one might be able to entrain the internal oscillation by an externally
varying cytokine (like TNF) signal25 . Potentially, it could lead to a way of controlling the
DNA-repair pathway.

The present research also opens for further theoretical investigations. The P/Q 6= 1 entrainment of the winding number for a nonlinear noise-induced oscillator with multiplicative
forcing is a purely numerical observation, and further research is needed to refine the condition when this can occur. We did not study the strong noise case either, and it would be
interesting to investigate in more details the active role of noise in the entrainments of limit
cycles. In many biological examples, where dynamics are molecular reaction based, additive
Gaussian white noise is not appropriate for large noise because it does not reflect the noise
amplitude dependence on the molecule number: instead either a concentration dependent
noise amplitude or a stochastic treatment of molecule numbers should be performed.

Finally, we would like to briefly comment on ”noise-induced” oscillations by mechanisms
other than the linear model studied here. It has been long known that, when noise is
added to excitable system with a stable fixed point, regular oscillatory behaviour can be
observed at a certain level of noise (coherence resonance)28,29 . Since the nonlinearity plays
an important role in an oscillation, such a system shows mode-locking behaviour similar
to the deterministic nonlinear oscillators30 . More recently, in gene network models with
negative feedback, it has been shown that the noise due to finiteness of the number of
molecules can modify the condition for oscillatory behaviour31 or enhance the oscillation32 .
It would also be interesting to see the entrainment behaviour in such systems.

(σ = 0.2). For the limit cycle oscillator (a and d), the noise makes the orbit irregular, and the
phase sometime slips. In the linear noise-induced oscillator for small external angular frequency,
we can clearly see that the noise put the oscillation with angular frequency close to ω` on top of
one-to-one entrainment behavior (b). When Ω is larger than ω` (e), the external angular frequency
is more visible, due to the smaller noise compared to the amplitude. The nonlinear noise-induced
oscillator behaves again very similar to the linear case in entrainment behavior (c and f), except
for the suppression of large amplitude.

FIG. 10. ”Arnold’s tongue” with multiplicative forcing for limit cycle oscillator without (a) and
with (b) noise and for nonlinear system with a stable fixed point without (c) and with noise (d).
The horizontal axis is the external frequency Ω, and the vertical axis is the forcing amplitude M .
Entrainment is defined as ω/Ω is within 1% of the given value. (a) The limit cycle oscillator with
d = 2 and B = 10 with σ = 0 shows standard ’Arnold’s tongue’, while the noise (σ = 0.1) makes
the region of entrainment smaller (b). For nonlinear noise induced oscillator (d = −0.1, B = 1; c),
there are a few entrainment regions for no noise case (σ = 0), but not all the ratios are observed.
For (c), the exponentially decaying case were excluded numerically by the following way: The
equations are integrated with initial condition x(1) = 1 and x(2) = 0, and if the average amplitude
for 390π/Ω < t < 400π/Ω is less than 90% of the average amplitude for 200π/Ω < t < 210π/Ω,
then the solution is excluded.

(a)MT N F = 0.006, (b)MT N F = 0.02, (c)MT N F = 0.05, and (d)MT N F = 0.1. The entrainment
regions are calculated from the frequency of the peaks in the the deterministic case. In the finite noise case, we define the nuclear NF-κB peak as follows: We first determined the maximum
value Nmax and the minimum value Nmin of x1 of the steady state in the deterministic simulation for the given parameters. We then calculate two thresholds, NH = (Nmax + Nmin )/2 and
NL = (Nmax + 3Nmin )/4. Next we perform the corresponding simulation with finite σ. We define
a switching event from the “low” state to “high” state when x1 exceeds NH , while the reverse
switching happens when x1 becomes smaller than NL . The number of peaks are calculated from
how often the “high” states are reached. This way we can filter out the wiggly motion due to the
noise and thus define the overall peak.
