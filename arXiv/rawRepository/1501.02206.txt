Abstract. Inspired by biological evolution, we consider the following socalled accessibility percolation problem: The vertices of the unoriented ndimensional binary hypercube are assigned independent U (0, 1) weights, referred to as fitnesses. A path is considered accessible if fitnesses are strictly
increasing along it. We prove that the probability that the global fitness max√ 
imum is accessible from the all zeroes vertex converges to 1 − 12 ln 2 + 5
as n → ∞. Moreover, we prove that if one conditions on the location of the
fitness maximum being v̂, then provided v̂ is not too close to the all zeroes
vertex in Hamming distance, the probability that v̂ is accessible converges to
a function of this distance divided by n as n → ∞. This resolves a conjecture
by Berestycki, Brunet and Shi in almost full generality.
As a second result we show that, for any graph, accessibility percolation
can equivalently be formulated in terms of first-passage site percolation. This
connection is of particular importance for the study of accessibility percolation
on trees.

1. Introduction
A number of recent papers [4–10] have studied a percolation problem known
as accessibility percolation, based on ideas of Kauffman and Levin for modeling
biological evolution [1]. In its simplest form, accessibility percolation consists of a
graph G = (V, E), or more generally a digraph, together with a fitness function
ω : V → R generated according to some random distribution. This is thought
of as representing the landscape of possible evolutionary trajectories of a species.
The vertices in G represent the possible genotypes for an organism whose fitness
is a measure of how successful an individual of that genotype is, and the edges the
possible ways the genome can change subject to a single mutation. Here it makes
sense both to consider directed and undirected edges depending on whether or not
a certain mutation is reversible. Of primary concern is the existence or distribution
of so-called accessible paths.
Definition. Let G = (V, E) and ω : V → R be a fitness landscape. We say that a
path v0 → v1 → . . . → vl in G is accessible if
(1.1)

ω(v0 ) < ω(v1 ) < . . . < ω(vl ).

For v, w ∈ V we say that w is accessible from v if there exists an accessible path
from v to w.
For the distribution of ω we will in this paper consider two variations of Kingman’s House-of-Cards model [3]. Both of which have previously been considered in
accessibility percolation. In fact, all results in [6–10] consider some variation of the
House-of-Cards model, whereas [4] and [5] also consider the so-called Rough Mount
Fuji model. The first model we will consider here is the original formulation of the
2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 60C05, 60K35, 92D15.

House-of-Cards model, in which the ω(v):s are independent and U (0, 1)-distributed
for all v ∈ V . Kauffman and Levin refers to this as an uncorrelated landscape.
For the second distribution we modify the House-of-Cards model by introducing
an a priori global fitness maximum v̂ ∈ V by changing ω(v̂) to one. As accessibility percolation only depends on the relative order of fitnesses, this can be seen
as equivalent to conditioning the House-of-Cards model on v̂ being the global fitness maximum. In particular, if v̂ is chosen uniformly at random among V , then
this is equivalent to the House-of-Cards model with v̂ denoting the global fitness
maximum.
Our first main result considers accessibility percolation on the unoriented ndimensional binary hypercube. The question of primary concern is whether or not
there exists an accessible path from the all zeroes vertex, 0̂, to the fitness maximum
v̂. We prove that, provided v̂ is not too close to 0̂ in Hamming distance, the
probability that such path exists converges to a non-trivial function of the Hamming
distance between v̂ and 0̂ divided by n, confirming a conjecture by Berestycki,
Brunet and Shi [7] in almost full generality.
As a second result, we show that accessibility percolation for a general graph can
be equivalently formulated in terms of first-passage site percolation. This lets us reformulate previous results in the literature in terms of first-passage site percolation.
In particular, this relation has important implications for accessibility percolation
on trees, as studied in [6, 8–10].
1.1. Notation.
• Whenever talking about a general graph G = (V, E), we allow both undirected and directed edges. For vertices u, v ∈ V , we write u ∼ v if there is
either an undirected edge between u and v or a directed edge going from u
to v.
• The unoriented n-dimensional binary hypercube, denoted by Qn , is the
graph whose vertices are the binary n-tuplets {0, 1}n and where two vertices
share an edge if their Hamming distance is one. The oriented n-dimensional
−→
binary hypercube, Qn , is the directed graph obtained by directing each edge
in Qn towards the vertex with more ones.
• For a vertex v in the hypercube we let |v| denote the number of coordinates
of v that are one. Addition and subtraction of vertices in Qn denotes
coordinate-wise addition/subtraction modulo two. We let 0̂ and 1̂ denote
the all zeroes and all ones vertices respectively, and let e1 , . . . , en denote
the standard basis.
• Often when considering the House-of-Cards model, it is useful to condition
on the fitness of 0̂. Following the convention in [6,7], for any α ∈ [0, 1] we let
Pα (·) and Eα [·] denote conditional probability and expectation respectively,
given ω(0̂) = α.
1.2. Recent work. Let us take a moment to summarize the results for accessibility
percolation on the binary hypercube with House-of-Cards fitnesses in [5–7]. We
−→
start by consider the simplified version of the problem where we replace Qn by Qn .
This is equivalent to only considering paths without backwards mutations. As any
coordinate where v̂ is zero will be constantly zero along any such path, it suffices
to consider the case where v̂ = 1̂.
Let X denote the number of oriented paths from 0̂ to 1̂ which are accessible. As
there are n! oriented paths from 0̂ to 1̂, and each path is accessible if and only if
the n random fitnesses along the path are in ascending order, we see that EX = 1.
At first glance, this may seem to imply a positive probability of accessible paths
existing. However, a much clearer picture of what occurs is obtained by conditioning

ACC. PERCOLATION AND F.P. SITE PERCOLATION ON Qn

on the fitness of the starting vertex. Indeed, conditioned on the fitness of 0̂ being
α ∈ [0, 1], we have
Eα X = n(1 − α)n−1 .

(1.2)

We see that, for large n, this expression is 1 approximately at α = lnnn , and rapidly
decreasing as α increases. Informally, this means that unless the fitness of the starting vertex is below lnnn , accessible paths are highly unlikely. In fact, by considering

(1.2) a bit more closely it follows that P X ≥ 1 ∧ ω(0̂) > lnnn ≤ n1 . On the other
hand, the regime where α is smaller than lnnn turns out to be more difficult to treat.
In [5] it was shown by Hegarty and the author that the probability of accessible
paths in this case tends to 1 as n → ∞.

This theorem was later strengthened by Berestycki, Brunet and Shi in [6] who
proved that, in the special case where ω(0̂) = O n1 , X has a non-trivial limit
distribution when scaled appropriately.
Let us now switch back to the unoriented hypercube and see how this analysis
changes. Again, let X denote the number of accessible paths from 0̂ to v̂. Here,
paths are not as combinatorially well-behaved as for the oriented cube, and first
moment estimates are not as easy to come by. Nevertheless, in a recent paper by
Berestycki, Brunet and Shi [7] it was shown that Eα X has the following asymptotic
behavior:
Theorem 1.2. (Berestycki, Brunet, Shi) Let α ∈ [0, 1] be fixed, and let v̂ = v̂ n ∈
Qn be such that x := limn→∞ |v̂ n | /n exists. We have that as n → ∞

As a consequence, for each x there is a critical value α∗ (x) = 1−ϑ(x) for the fitness
of 0̂, given by the unique non-negative solution to

such that
• For α > 1 − ϑ(x), Pα (X ≥ 1) goes to 0 exponentially fast as n → ∞.
• For α < 1 − ϑ(x), Eα X diverges exponentially fast as n → ∞.
Hence, the unconditioned probability that X ≥ 1 is at most 1 − ϑ(x).
We see a similar behavior of Eα X as for the oriented cube. One important difference though is that unlike the oriented cube the critical value has a nontrivial limit
as n → ∞. The function ϑ(x) is plotted in Figure 1.

concentrated around 12 and hence the critical fitness is 1 − 12 ln 2 + 5 ≈ 0.28.
Berestycki et al. further gave two conjectures that (1.6) “tells the truth” in the
sense that Pα (X ≥ 1) tends to 1 as n → ∞ for α < 1 − ϑ(x). Conjecture 1 of their

paper proposes this in the special case where v̂ = 1̂, and Conjecture 2 in the more
general setting of v̂ = v̂ n satisfying |v̂ n | /n → x ∈ [0, 1].
1.3. Results. The first result of this paper fully resolves Conjecture 1 by Berestycki, Brunet and Shi [7], and Conjecture 2 under the additional condition that x is
not too small.
Theorem 1.3. Let v̂ = v̂ n ∈ Qn be a sequence of vertices such that x := limn→∞ |v̂| /n
exists. Let X denote the number of accessible paths from 0̂ to v̂. Let ϑ(x) be as
defined in Theorem 1.2. Assuming x ≥ 0.002, we have

The value 0.002 deserves some explanation. In the proof of Theorem 1.3, or more
accurately the proof of Theorem 1.6 below which is shown to be equivalent to the
former, we see that there is a value x∗ ≈ 0.00167 such that the proof goes through
whenever x > x∗ and breaks down when x < x∗ , see Remark 4.8. It seems likely
however that this is simply an artifact of the technique used in the proof, and that
the statement should hold true even for smaller x. Regardless of whether or not
this is true, we can note that the two cases of most concern, x = 1 and x = 0.5, are
far above x∗ .
We now turn to the relation between accessibility percolation and first-passage
site percolation for a general graph. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with a distinguished
vertex 0̂. Note that each edge of G may either be directed or undirected. For each
vertex v ∈ G randomly assign a cost, denoted by c(v), according to independent
U (0, 1) random variables. For a path u0 , u1 , . . . , ul in G we define the site passage
time of the path by

Figure 2. Example of a graph where accessible paths have a different distribution than paths with small passage time. We can
for instance note that there can never be exactly three accessible
paths from 0̂ to v, whereas there can certainly be exactly three
paths with reduced passage time at most 1 − α.
and similarly define its reduced site passage time by
X
(1.12)
c(ui ).
1≤i<l

Note that neither the passage time nor the reduced passage time of a path include
the cost of the first vertex. For each u, v ∈ G we define the site first-passage time
from u to v, denoted by TV (u, v), and the reduced first passage time from u to v,
denoted by TV0 (u, v), as the minimum of the respective quantity over all paths from
u to v.
Theorem 1.4. Let G be a graph with two distinct vertices 0̂ and v̂, and let α ∈
[0, 1]. Consider accessibility percolation on G. If fitnesses are assigned according to
the House-of-Cards model with v̂ as the a priori global fitness maximum, then


(1.13)
Pα v̂ accessible from 0̂ = P TV0 (0̂, v̂) ≤ 1 − α .
If fitnesses are assigned according to the House-of-Cards model without an a priori
global maximum, then for any vertex v ∈ G


(1.14)
Pα v accessible from 0̂ = P TV (0̂, v) ≤ 1 − α .
Moreover, in the latter case this claim can be significantly strengthened. Conditioned
on the fitness of 0̂ being α, the set of vertices accessible from 0̂ has the same
distribution as the set of vertices v such that TV (0̂, v) ≤ 1 − α.
Informally we can think of this theorem as saying that accessibility percolation is
equivalent to first-passage site percolation with independent U (0, 1) vertex passage
times. We need to be a bit careful there though; the theorem only deals with the
question of whether or not a certain vertex is accessible from 0̂ along any path,
and it does not for instance say anything about the number of accessible paths.
Indeed, it is not true in general that the number of accessible paths from 0̂ to v is
distributed as the number of paths from 0̂ to v with reduced passage time at most
1 − α. For graphs containing non-simple paths this is clear as non-simple paths
can have arbitrarily small passage time but cannot be accessible, but it can even
be false for directed acyclic graphs, see for instance Figure 2. On the other hand,
the connection is more general than just treating which vertices are accessible. For
instance, using the proof ideas in Section 2 one can show that the minimal number
of times you need to move to a less fit vertex to get from 0̂ to v is distributed as
the integer part of TV (0̂, v) + α.
A problem with using Theorem 1.4 to relate known results from first-passage
percolation to accessibility percolation is that the vast majority of the first-passage
percolation literature assigns passage times to edges rather than vertices. However,
a common property for percolation problems is that it is harder to percolate on

6

vertices than edges [2]. The following proposition shows that something similar
holds for first-passage percolation.
Proposition 1.5. Suppose the edges of G are assigned independent U (0, 1) weights.
Let TE (u, v) denote the minimum total weight of any path from u to v in G. Then,
it is possible to couple TE (0̂, ·) to TV (0̂, ·) such that TE (0̂, v) ≤ TV (0̂, v) for all
v ∈ G.
For the special case when G is a rooted tree one can see that this coupling
is exact; to go from site to bond percolation we can simply consider the passage
time of each vertex to instead be assigned to the edge leading to it. Accessibility
percolation on trees has been considered in [6, 8–10]. With the exception of [6],
these articles have considered regular rooted trees with degree n and height h, and
where fitnesses are assigned according to the House-of-Cards model conditioned on
the fitness of the root being zero. Of principal concern is how the number of vertices
in generation h that are accessible from the root varies as a function of n, and in
particular whether this number is non-zero. Using Theorem 1.4 we can see that this
is equivalent to assigning independent U (0, 1) passage times to the edges of the tree
and considering the number of vertices v in generation h such that TE (0̂, v) ≤ 1. In
particular, the question of whether generation h is accessible from 0̂ is equivalent
to to asking if the first-passage time from the root to generation h is at most 1. It
should be mentioned however that the usual setting in first-passage percolation on
regular rooted trees keeps n fixed and considers the first-passage time from the root
to generation h as h → ∞. While the author is not aware of any results from this
field that have appropriate error bounds to be directly applicable to accessibility
percolation, there seems to be a significant overlap of ideas between [9, 10] and the
literature on first-passage percolation on trees. See for instance [13].
Let us now consider the implications of Theorem 1.4 for the hypercube. Using
this result, we can immediately translate the result from Theorem 1.1 to that, for
the oriented hypercube, TV0 (0̂, 1̂) is concentrated around 1 − lnnn with fluctuations
of order n1 . More importantly, we have that the following is equivalent to Theorem
1.3:
Theorem 1.6. Let G = Qn and let v̂ = v̂ n ∈ Qn be a sequence of vertices such
that x := limn→∞ |v̂| /n exists. Assuming x ≥ 0.002, as n → ∞ we have
(1.15)

TV0 (0̂, v̂) → ϑ(x)

in probability.
Note here that the fact that ϑ(x) is an asymptotic lower bound on the reduced
passage time is already implied by Theorem 1.2.
It should be mentioned that basically the same results holds true for bond percolation. In [11] it was shown that for the oriented hypercube, we have TE (0̂, 1̂) → 1
in probability as n → ∞. In a more recent result by the√author
[12], it was shown

that for the unoriented hypercube TE (0̂, 1̂) → ln 1 + 2 as n → ∞. Strictly
speaking these results assume standard exponential edge weights, but it is not too
hard to show that the limiting distribution of TE (0̂, 1̂) only depends on the weight
distribution as the righthand limit of its probability distribution function at 0, hence
it will be the same for U (0, 1) weights.
The remainder of the paper will be structured as follows: In Section 2 we prove
Proposition 1.5 and Theorem 1.4. The remaining sections, Sections 3, 4 and 5, are
dedicated to the proof of Theorem 1.6.

2. Proof of Proposition 1.5 and Theorem 1.4
We may, without loss of generality, assume that for any vertex v there exists a
path from 0̂ to v.
A key idea of the proofs of Proposition 1.5 and Theorem 1.4 is the following
procedure for computing TV (0̂, v). We initially consider TV (0̂, v) to be unassigned
for each v, except 0̂ for which it is set to 0, and we let U = {0̂} denote the set of
vertices with assigned first-passage times. Until TV (0̂, v) is assigned for all v, we
do the following operation:
(1) Find a pair of vertices u, v that minimizes TV (0̂, u) subject to (u, v) ∈ E,
u ∈ U and v 6∈ U .
(2) Let TV (0̂, v) := TV (0̂, u) + c(v)
(3) Add v to U .
To see that this assigns first-passage times correctly, suppose that we are in the step
where TV (0̂, v) is assigned. As v is not in U , the passage time of any path from 0̂ to v
must include the passage time from 0̂ to some vertex u0 in U adjacent to some vertex
outside U , as well as the cost v. Hence TV (0̂, v) ≥ TV (0̂, u0 )+c(v) ≥ TV (0̂, u)+c(v).
As there is a path from 0̂ to v with passage time TV (0̂, u) + c(v), this must be
optimal. Hence, if all previous assignments are correct, TV (0̂, v) will be assigned
correctly as well.
Proof of Proposition 1.5. We can modify this algorithm to run on first-passage
bond percolation by replacing c(v) by the weight of the edge from u to v. In
either case, as no vertex cost or edge weight respectively is accessed more than
once, the accessed values form a sequence of independent and U (0, 1) random variables. Hence the distribution of TV (0̂, v) is unaffected. On the other hand, for bond
percolation we get that TV (0̂, v) is the edge passage time of some path from 0̂ to v
(but not necessarily the shortest).
We now turn to the proof of Theorem 1.4. The coupling between first-passage
site percolation
and accessibility
percolation we will consider is essentially to let

	
f (v) = α + TV (0̂, v) be the fitness function, where {x} = x − bxc denotes the
fractional part of x. We will however modify this slightly by putting f (v) = 1
whenever α + TV (0̂, v) = 1. It is clear that the probability of such v other than 0̂
existing is 0, so the only way this will change the distribution of f is that f (0̂) = 1
if α = 1.
It is not too hard to see that, for any vertex v except 0̂, f (v) is U (0, 1)-distributed.
The following lemma shows that the f (v):s are also independent, hence showing that
f is distributed according to the House-of-Cards model without an a priori global
fitness maximum, conditioned on f (0̂) = α.
Lemma 2.1. f (v) are independent U (0, 1) random variables for v ∈ V \ {0̂}.
Proof. Suppose that we generate vertex costs in the following way: Run the procedure above, but with the modification that whenever the algorithm tries to ac˜
cess c(v), first generate
n
o a U (0, 1) random variable f (v) and assign c(v) the value
f˜(v) − α − TV (0̂, u) .
It is clear that the c(v):s are independent and U (0, 1)-distributed. The lemma
follows by noting that, in the latter case, we have f (v) = f˜(v) almost surely for all
v ∈ V \ {0̂}.
Proof of Theorem 1.4. We begin by considering the case with no a priori global
fitness maximum. In this case, we can consider f : V → R to be the fitness
function. For simplicity let us assume that no vertex cost is exactly 0.

Assume TV (0̂, v) ≤ 1 − α, and let 0̂ = v0 , v1 , . . . , vl = v be the path with shortest
passage time. Then, as 0 < α + TV (0̂, vi ) ≤ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ l it follows that
(2.1)

f (vi ) = α +

c(vj )

for 0 ≤ i ≤ l. Hence v0 , v1 , . . . , vl is accessible. Conversely, suppose TV (0̂, v) > 1−α
and let 0̂ = v0 , v1 , . . . , vl = v be any path between 0̂ and v. Let i be the lowest index
such that TV (0̂, vi ) > 1 − α. Then f (vi ) ≤ α + TV (0̂, vi ) − 1 ≤ α + TV (0̂, vi−1 ) +
c(vi ) − 1 < α + TV (0̂, vi−1 ) = f (vi−1 ). Hence the path is not accessible.
Now for the case where v̂ ∈ V \ {0̂} is the a priori global fitness maximum. We
here keep the same coupling as before between f (v) and c(v) for v ∈ V , except that
we fix f (v̂) = 1. Let U be the set of vertices v ∈ V such that (v, v̂) ∈ E. Then
v̂ being accessible from 0̂ is almost surely equivalent to some vertex in U being
accessible from 0̂. Note that this last statement does not depend on the value
of f (v̂). It follows that v̂ is accessible from 0̂ is almost surely equivalent to that
minv∈U TV (0̂, v) ≤ 1 − α. The theorem follows by noting that minv∈U TV (0̂, v) =
TV0 (0̂, v̂).
3. The Clustering Translation Process
Before proceeding, we will slightly modify TV0 (0̂, v̂) by replacing the U (0, 1) vertex costs by independent standard exponential such. Note that the standard exponential distribution stochastically dominates U (0, 1), and hence this modification
will only increase TV0 (0̂, v̂). As the lower bound in Theorem 1.6 follows from Theorem 1.2, it suffices to show that, with this modification, asymptotically almost
surely TV0 (0̂, v̂) ≤ ϑ(x) + o(1). To do this, we will mimic the argument in [12] for
first-passage bond percolation on Qn .
Let us take a moment to describe some of the underlying machinery for firstpassage bond percolation on Qn . We assume independent standard exponential
edge weights. In [11], Durrett introduced the following process, which he called
the the branching translation process, BTP: At time 0 we place one particle at 0̂
in Qn . The system then evolves by each existing particle independently generating
offspring at each vertex adjacent to its position at rate 1. One can show that for
each vertex v ∈ Qn , the time at which the first particle at v is born is stochastically
dominated by TE (0̂, v). This follows from the fact that the BTP dominates the
so-called Richardson’s model. The strategy in [12] is basically to show that, with a
certain coupling, there is a probability bounded away from zero of these quantities
being equal.
In order to translate this approach to first-passage site percolation, we need to
find a corresponding process to the BTP for this case. We claim that the following
is such a process: We initially have a finite number of particles, each located at a
vertex in Qn . For each particle, we assign an independent Poisson clock with unit
rate. When a particle’s clock goes off, it simultaneously generates one new offspring
at each vertex adjacent to its position. The new particles are then assigned new
Poisson clocks and the process continues. We will refer to this process as the
clustering translation process, CTP.
We see that in both the BTP and CTP each particle generates offspring at each
neighboring vertex at rate 1. A big difference however is that in the BTP this
is done independently for each neighboring vertex, whereas in the CTP a particle
generates offspring all neighboring vertices simultaneously. Another difference is
that the initial state of the CTP is not fixed.

ACC. PERCOLATION AND F.P. SITE PERCOLATION ON Qn

The most important initial state of the CTP will be one particle at each neighbor
of 0̂. We will refer to a CTP initialized in this way as a standard CTP. Particles
born due to the same Poisson clock tick will be referred to as identical n-tuplets. To
simplify terminology we will also consider the initial n particles in a standard CTP
as identical n-tuplets. Below we will use the terms ancestor and descendant of a
particle to denote the natural partial order of particles generated by the CTP. For
convenience, we say that a particle is both an ancestor and a descendant of itself.
The terms parent and child are defined in the natural way. The ancestral line of
a particle x is the ordered set of ancestors of x, and we say that the ancestral line
of x follows the path 0̂ = v0 , v1 , v2 , . . . , vl if the location of the ancestors of x in
chronological order is given by v1 , v2 , . . . vl . Note that this path always starts at 0̂
even though the first ancestor is located at a neighbor of 0̂. We say that a particle
x originates from a particle y at a time t if y is the last particle in the ancestral
line of x that exists at time t.
We can immediately note some properties of this process. Firstly, it is Markovian.
Secondly, let A be a set of vertices in Qn , and let MA (v, t) denote the expected
number of particles at vertex v at time t ≥ 0 in the CTP initialized by placing one
particle at each vertex in A. Then it is easy to see that MA (v, t) must solve the
initial value problem

Recall that addition/subtraction of vertices in Qn are interpreted as coordinatewise addition/subtraction modulo 2. It should be remarked that the exact same
analysis holds for the BTP.
We now show that the standard CTP indeed has the desired relation to firstpassage site percolation. To this end, we partition the particles in this process into
two sets, the set of alive particles and the set of ghosts. Each initial particle is alive.
Whenever a new particle is born, it is alive if its location does not already contain
an alive particle and its parent is alive, and is a ghost otherwise. Note that at most
one particle at each vertex can be alive. Furthermore, it is easy to show that each
vertex will almost surely eventually contain an alive particle.
Proposition 3.1. Consider first-passage site percolation on Qn with exponentially
distributed costs with unit mean. It is possible to couple this process to the standard
CTP such that for each vertex v except 0̂, TV0 (0̂, v) denotes the birth time of the
alive particle at v.
Proof. For each vertex v, we let T̃ 0 (v) denote the first time t ≥ 0 when v contains
an alive particle, and we let c̃(v) denote the time from the birth of this particle to
the first arrival of its clock. Then c̃(v) for v ∈ Qn are independent exponentially
distributed random variables with unit mean.
From the definitions of the CTP and alive particles, it follows that for any vertex
v that is not a neighbor of 0̂, the alive particle at v is born at the first arrival time

10

of an alive particle at an adjacent vertex. Hence, for any v that is not a neighbor
of 0̂, we have


(3.5)
T̃ 0 (v) = min T̃ 0 (w) + c̃(w) ,
w∼v

0

and trivially T̃ (v) = 0 when v is a neighbor of 0̂. It is easy to see that this uniquely
defines T̃ 0 (v), and that for each vertex v except 0̂, T̃ 0 (v) denotes the reduced firstpassage time from 0̂ to v with respect to the vertex costs given by c̃(v).
Given this proposition, we are able to proceed analogously to Sections 2 and 3 in
[12]. In applying this coupling between the CTP and first-passage site percolation
we will consider a stronger and more tractable property than aliveness. For any
particle x in the CTP, we let c(x) denote the number of pairs of particles y and z
such that
• y and z occupy the same vertex
• y is an ancestor of x
• y was born after z.
We furthermore let a(x) denote the number of such pairs where z is either an
ancestor of x or an identical n-tuple of an ancestor of x, and define b(x) = c(x) −
a(x). We call a particle x uncontested if c(x) = 0.
It can be noted that a(x) is defined differently for the BTP. This is because
the strategy is loosely speaking to let a(x) denote the number of pairs (y, z) that
deterministically must exist given x. For the CTP we have additional such pairs,
namely those corresponding to identical n-tuplets of ancestors of x.
Lemma 3.2. If a particle is uncontested, then it is alive.
Proof. If a particle x is a ghost, then it must have an earliest ancestor (possibly
itself) which is a ghost, y. As y is a ghost but the parent of y is alive, it follows
that the location of y must have already been occupied by some (alive) particle z.
The pair (y, z) is then counted in c(x).
It is not hard to see that a(x) only depends on the path followed by the ancestral
line of x. If we know this path, then we know the locations and order of births of all
ancestors and identical n-tuplets of ancestors of x. Let σ be a path represented as a
vertex sequence. We say that σ is vertex-minimal if there is no proper subsequence
which is a path with the same end points.
Lemma 3.3. Let x be a particle in the CTP. If the ancestral line of x is vertexminimal, then a(x) = 0. The converse is true unless x is located at 0̂.
Proof. Denote the path followed by the ancestral line of x by v0 , v1 , . . . , vl and the
ancestors of x by x1 , x2 , . . . , xl = x. We have that a(x) > 0 if and only if there exist
1 ≤ i < j ≤ l such that xj occupies the same vertex as either xi or an identical
n-tuplet of xi , that is, vi−1 and vj are adjacent. Hence, if a(x) > 0 the path is not
vertex-minimal. Conversely, if a(x) = 0 it follows that the only pairs of adjacent
vertices are consecutive in the path. It is straight-forward to show that, unless the
path starts and stops at the same vertex, this implies vertex-minimality.
What follows are two technical lemmas, corresponding to Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 in
[12]. Before presenting these, we need to specify how to formally describe the CTP.
Firstly, by a (potential) particle we mean a word {v1 , z1 , v2 , z2 , . . . ,vl−1 , zl−1 , vl }
where v1 , . . . , vl denote vertices and z1 , . . . zl−1 positive real numbers. This is interpreted as the particle whose ancestors are located at v1 , v2 , . . . , vl and born at
times 0, z1 , z1 + z2 and so on. The CTP is described by a random set X of potential particles, denoting the set of particles that will ever be born in the CTP. We

ACC. PERCOLATION AND F.P. SITE PERCOLATION ON Qn

11

will use ⊕ to denote concatenation of words. We remark that this representation
means that the functions c(x) and b(x) are not functions only of x, and should more
correctly be denoted by c(X, x) and b(X, x). On the other hand, a(x) is really a
function of x as it only depends on the location of the ancestors of x.
Lemma 3.4. Let σ = {0̂ = v0 , v1 , . . . , vl−1 , vl } be a path. For 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 1 let Xi
denote independent CTP:s where Xi is the CTP obtained by initially placing one
particle at each neighbor of vi . Let f be a function that maps pairs (X, x) to the
non-negative real numbers where X is a realization of a CTP, and x is a particle
in X. Similarly, let Vσ (X) denote the set of particles in X whose ancestral lines
follow σ. Then for a standard CTP, X, we have

and xz1 ,...,zl−1 = {v1 z1 v2 z2 . . . vl }.
For compactness, we will only sketch a proof. The reader unconvinced by this is
referred to the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [12].
Proof sketch. Let us first consider the case when f (X, x) only depends on x. In
that case, we have

This is because the original particle at v1 gives birth to particles at v2 at rate one
whereupon, after its birth, each child at v2 of this original particle gives birth to
particles at v3 at rate one, and so on. When f also depends on the realization of
the CTP, the idea is that we substitute f (X, x) in the left-hand side of this sum by
E [f (X, x)|x ∈ X]. Now, formally this conditioning does not really make sense, but
its meaning is intuitively clear; it denotes the average value of f (X, x) where the
average is taken over all X that include x. We have

Now, xz1 ,...,zl−1 exists in X if and only if certain Poisson clocks have arrivals at
certain times. By the independent increment property, conditioning on these arrivals does not affect the Poisson clocks at any other times. Hence, the conditional
distribution of X given the existence of xz1 ,...,zl−1 is the same as that of a standard
CTP, except with added arrivals, corresponding to the births of the ancestors of
xz1 ,...,zl−1 . This is precisely the distribution of Xz1 ,...zl−1 .

particles in generation two born at time t, this occurs independently for each t ∈ T.
Hence, by the random selection property, T0 is also a Poisson point process. This

Theorem 3.6.
P Consider a standard CTP. For any vertex v and any t ≥ 0, let
B(v, t) = E x b(x) where the sum goes over all particles at v at time t in the
CTP, and let S(v, t) denote the expected number of particles x at v at time t such
that a(x) = 0. Theprobability
 that there is an uncontested particle at v at time t is

at least S(v, t) exp − B(v,t)
S(v,t) .

Proof. Let P (v, t) denote the probability that v contains an uncontested particle at
time t. As at most one particle at each vertex can be uncontested, this is the same
thing as the expected number of uncontested particles at v at time t. For each path
σ from 0̂ to v, let Pσ (v, t), Bσ (v, t) and Sσ (v, t) denote the contribution to P (v, t),
B(v, t) and S(v, t) respectively from particles whose ancestral line follows σ.
The idea now is to bound Pσ (v, t) in terms of Bσ (v, t) and Sσ (v, t) for each path
σ from 0̂ to v. Recall that a(x) is constant over all particles x whose ancestral line
follows a fixed σ. We will denote this constant by a(σ).
Let σ be a path from 0̂ to v such that a(σ) = 0. Applying Lemma 3.4 we see
that

As a(xz1 ,...,zl−1 ) = 0, no two ancestors of xz1 ,...,zl−1 occupy the same vertex. It
follows that any pair of particles y and z which is counted in b (Xz1 ,...,zl−1 , xz1 ,...,zl−1 )
is uniquely determined by z. Fixing σ and z1 , . . . , zl−1 , this means that we can
define φ(x) as an indicator function such that

More precisely, φ(x) is the indicator for x occupying the same vertex as an ancestor
of xz1 ,...,zl−1 and being born before it. By the definition of b(xz1 ,...,zl−1 ), we have
that φ(x) is zero for any ancestor or identical n-tuplet of an ancestor of xz1 ,...,zl−1 .
It follows by Lemma 3.5 that
(3.15)

P (b (Xz1 ,...,zl−1 , xz1 ,...,zl−1 ) = 0) ≥ exp (−Eb (Xz1 ,...,zl−1 , xz1 ,...,zl−1 )) .

By convexity of the exponential function we have e−r ≥ (1 + r0 − r)e−r0 for any
r, r0 ∈ R. Hence
(3.16)

Pσ (v, t) ≥ (1 + r0 )e−r0 Sσ (v, t) − e−r0 Bσ (v, t),

for any path σ from 0̂ to v such that a(σ) = 0. For any σ that satisfies a(σ) 6= 0
it is clear that Pσ (v, t) = Sσ (v, t) = 0 and Bσ (v, t) ≥ 0, hence (3.16) holds in this
case as well. Summing over all paths σ from 0̂ to v and optimizing over r0 yields
B(v,t)
P (v, t) ≥ S(v, t)e− S(v,t) , as desired.
We will apply Theorem 3.6 as follows: Let {v̂ n }∞
n=1 be a sequence of vertices
such that, for each n, v̂ n ∈ Qn and x = limn→∞ |v̂ n | /n exists and is non-zero. We
may, without loss of generality, assume that v̂ n is never equal to 0̂. For each n, we
let ϑn denote the unique non-negative solution to
1
(3.17)
m(v̂ n , ϑn ) = .
n
Note that the expected number of particles at v̂ n at time ϑn in a standard CTP
on Qn is Θ(1), and that ϑn → ϑ(x) as n → ∞. By Theorem 3.6 we have that the
probability that there is a uncontested
 particle at v̂ n at time ϑn in the CTP on Qn
is at least S(v̂ n , ϑn ) exp − B(v̂ n ,ϑn ) . Hence by Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 3.1 it
S(v̂ n ,ϑn )
follows that

(3.18)
P TV (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑn ≥ S(v̂ n , ϑn ) exp −

S(v̂ n , ϑn )
This means that if we can show that S(v̂ n , ϑn ) = Θ(1) and B(v̂ n , ϑn ) = O(1), then
we know that TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑn with probability bounded away from 0 as n → ∞.
Section 4 will be dedicated to estimating S(v̂ n , ϑn ) and B(v̂ n , ϑn ). The proof of
Theorem 1.6 is then completed in Section 5 by showing that if TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑn with
probability bounded away from 0, then a slightly larger upper bound on TV0 (0̂, v̂ n )
must hold asymptotically almost surely.
4. Calculus
4.1. Estimating S. We will prove that S(v̂ n , ϑn ) = Θ(1) in two steps. Firstly, we
show that most particles at v̂ n at time ϑn have ancestral lines which are close to
vertex-minimal. Using this, we then give a combinatorial argument that shows that
a positive proportion of these particles must have vertex-minimal ancestral lines.
Let us formalize the notion of paths being close to vertex-minimal. Let v, w ∈ Qn
be fixed distinct vertices and let σ = {v = v0 , v1 , . . . , vl = w} be a path from v to
w. Throughout this section, we will always think of a path as a finite sequence of
vertices. In particular, by the length of a path we mean the number of vertices in
the path. For any 0 < i ≤ j < l we say that the subsequence vi , vi+1 , . . . , vj is a
detour of σ if removing these elements from σ results in a valid path. Clearly, for
v 6= w a path is vertex-minimal if and only if it has no detours. Inspired by this,
we say that a path is almost vertex-minimal if all detours have length at most 2.
Note that as Qn is bipartite, any detour must have even length. Hence, a path is
almost vertex-minimal if it only has the shortest possible detours.
An important property of almost vertex-minimal paths is that any such path
from v to w can be constructed by taking a vertex-minimal path with the same

14

end-points and extending it as follows: Between each two adjacent elements in the
sequence either do nothing or insert a detour of length 2.
Lemma 4.1. Let s, t ≥ 0 and v ∈ Qn . Then
X
m(w, s)m(v + w, t) = m(v, s + t).
(4.1)
w∈Qn

Proof. Fix s. Observe that equality holds when t = 0 and that both expressions
solves (3.1)
Proposition 4.2. Let {v̂ n }∞
n=1 be a sequence of vertices, v̂ n ∈ Qn , such that
α = limn→∞ |v̂ n | /n exists and is positive. Then, as n → ∞, the expected number
of particles in the standard CTP on Qn which are at v̂ n at time ϑn , but that do not
have almost vertex-minimal ancestral lines tends to 0.
Proof. Let Xn denote the number of triples of particles x, y, z in the CTP on Qn
such that
•
•
•
•

x is at v̂ n at time ϑn
y and z are located at adjacent vertices
z is an ancestor of y which is an ancestor of x.
y and z are neither one nor three generations apart.

We note that if the ancestral line of a given particle x at v̂ n at time ϑn can be
constructed using some detour of length d > 2, then it is clear that x would have
a pair of ancestors at adjacent vertices which are d + 1 generations apart. This
means that any such x is counted at least once in Xn . Hence, it suffices to show
that EXn = o(1).
For each triple x, y, z as above there are uniquely defined particles c, the particle
after z in the ancestral line of x, and p, the parent of y. Note that the requirement that y is neither the child, nor the grand-grandchild of z implies that p is a
descendant of c, but not a child of c.
Let T = {0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tk = ϑn } denote the end-points of a partition
of [0, ϑn ) into left-closed right-open subintervals, and let Xn,T denote the number
of triples as above where c and y are the only ancestors of x born during their
respective time intervals. Pick a, b integers between 0 and k − 1. Consider the
number of triples counted in Xn,T where c is born during [ta , ta+1 ) and y is born
during [tb , tb+1 ). Note that this is trivially 0 whenever b ≤ a.
Let us count the expected number of corresponding triples for a < b. As z and
y are located at adjacent vertices, for each such triple we may denote the locations
of z, y, c and p by v, v + ei , v + ej and v + ei − ek respectively for some v ∈ Qn
and 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n. P
A particle is a potential z if it is born before time ta , hence
n
there are on average l=1 m(v − el , ta ) potential z:s at v. For each z, a particle is
a potential c if it is a child of z born during [ta , ta+1 ). Hence for each potential z
at v, there are on average ta+1 − ta potential c:s at v + ej . For each potential c, a
particle is a potential p if it originates from c at time ta+1 and is born before tb ,
but is not a child of c. Hence for each potential c at v + ej there are on average
m(ei − ek − ej , tb − ta+1 ) potential p:s at v + ei − ek if v + ej and v + ei − ek are not
adjacent, and m(ei − ek − ej , tb − ta+1 ) − (tb − ta+1 ) if they are. Lastly, for each
potential p, a particle is a potential y if it is a child of p born during [tb , tb+1 ), and
for each potential y a particle is a potential x if it is located at v̂ n , originates from
y at time tb+1 , and is born before time ϑn . Hence for each potential p at v + ei − ek
the expected number of potential y:s at v + ei is tb+1 − tb , and for each potential y
at v + ei , the expected number of x:s is m(v̂ n − v − ei , ϑn − tb+1 ). Combining all

Proposition 4.3. For any pair of sequences {v̂ n }∞
n=1 and {ϑn }n=1 as above, we
have S(v̂ n , ϑn ) = Θ(1).

Proof. Let Γn and Γ̃n denote the sets of vertex-minimal and almost vertex-minimal
paths from 0̂ to v̂ n respectively. Using Lemma 3.4 with f (X, x) as the indicator
function of x being born at time ϑn and having ancestral line in Γ̃n and Γn respectively, we can write the expected number particles at v̂ n at time ϑn in the CTP
whose ancestral lines are almost vertex-minimal as

As the total expected number of particles at v̂ n at time ϑn in the CTP is Θ(1),
Proposition 4.2 implies that the sum in (4.9) is also Θ(1).
The idea now is to group the terms of the sum in (4.9) according to which

from the fact that σ̃ may be an extension of more than one vertex-minimal path.
Let us fix a vertex-minimal path σ ∈ Γn consisting of l vertices. It is straightforward to show that the number of possible detours of length 2 that can be inserted
between each adjacent pair of elements in σ is 3(n − 1). Hence, there are at most

where the sums over i, j, k and l go from 1 to n.
Proof. We observe that B(v̂, u) is bounded by the expected number of triplets of
particles x, y, z in the CTP such that
• x is at v̂ at time u
• y is an ancestor of x
• y and z occupy the same vertex
• z was born before y.
Note the similarity to the quantity Xn in Proposition 4.2. For the sake of compactness, we will be less rigorous here, and refer to the proof of that proposition to see
how to formalize this argument.
Let us start by considering the number of such triples x, y and z where z has
no ancestors in common with x and y, that is, for some i 6= j we have that x and
y originate from the original particle at ei whereas z originates from the original
particle at ej . Denote the common location of y and z by v, and pick k such that
the parent of y is located at v − ek . Note that as z is strictly older than y, y cannot
be an original particle and hence has a parent. The lineage of x, y, z is illustrated
in Graph 1 of Figure 3.
Let us count the expected number of such triples corresponding to a fixed v and
where y is born during the time interval [t, t + dt). The potential z:s corresponding
to a fixed j are simply the descendants of the original particle at ej that are at v
at time t. Hence the expected number of such particles is m(v − ej , t). Similarly,
for a fixed i the expected number of potential y:s is given by m(v − ek − ei , t) dt,
and for each potential y the expected number of potential x:s is m(v, u − t). As
the potential z:s are born independently of the pairs of potential x:s and y:s, we
see that the expected number of triples x, y, z that do not have common ancestors,
corresponding to a fixed vertex v and a fixed time interval [t, t + dt) is given by

The total expected number of triples x, y, z without common ancestors is hence
given by summing this expression over all vertices v ∈ Qn and integrating over t
from 0 to u. This is clearly bounded from above by the first term in the right-hand
side of equation (4.13).
We now consider the cases where the three particles x, y, z have common ancestors. Denote the last common ancestor of the particles by l and its location by v.
As x and z have common ancestors but neither is a descendant of the other, there

Figure 3. Illustration of the possible ways x, y and z can be

right-most the ancestors of x and y. Graph 1 shows the case when
z has no ancestor in common with x and y. Here v is the common
location of y and z, and v − ek is the location of the parent of y.
For Graphs 2-4, v denotes the location of the last common ancestor
of x and z, and w the common location of y and z. Graph 2 shows
the case where the ancestral lines of x and z split by the birth of
a new ancestor of x, Graph 3 the case where this occurs by a new
ancestor of z and Graph 4 the case where the first unique ancestors
of x and of z are born simultaneously as part of the same group of
identical n-tuplets.

must be a time s when the ancestral lines of x and z split. There are three possible
ways in which this can occur, as illustrated by Graphs 2-4 in Figure 3; either a
new ancestor of x is born, a new ancestor of z is born, or new ancestors of x and
z are identical n-tuplets and therefore born at the same time. Observe that, in all

ACC. PERCOLATION AND F.P. SITE PERCOLATION ON Qn

three cases, y must be born strictly after this time. We let w denote the common
location of y and z.
We now count the expected number of such triples corresponding to fixed vertices
v and w, where the ancestral lines split during the time interval [s, s + dt) and such
that y is born during [s + t, s + t + dt). The potential l:s are the
Pnparticles in the
CTP at v at time s, hence the expected number of potential l:s is i=1 m(v − ei , s).
For each potential l, the probability that it gives birth during [s, s + ds) is ds. Now,
for each possibility for the ancestral lines of x and z to split, conditioned on the
process at time s + ds, the pairs of potential x:s and y:s originate from a different
particle than the potential z:s. Hence these are born independently. By following
the ancestral lines as illustrated in Graphs 2-4 in a similar manner as above, we see
that the expected number of triples with common ancestors corresponding to fixed
v and w, fixed time intervals, and corresponding to each case for how the ancestral
line splits are given by

respectively. The total expected number of triples x, y, z with common ancestors is
hence given by summing these three expressions over all pairs of vertices v, w ∈ Qn
and integrating over all s and t such that s, t ≥ 0 and s + t ≤ u.
It only remains to simplify these expressions. We observe that summing (4.15),
(4.16) and (4.17) over all v, w ∈ Qn removes all dependence on s. Consider in
particular the sum of (4.15) over all v, w ∈ Qn . By substituting summing over w
by summing over ∆ = w − v and applying Lemma 4.1 we have

(4.28)

that there is a limit for x at which the convexity of fn breaks down, and more

the remaining part of this section, we will investigate when this occurs.

−4. The curve intersects the ϑ-axis at ϑ(x) ≈ 0.0898, that is at
x ≈ 0.00167.
Combining this observation with the fact that fn00 (t) is bounded it follows that
a necessary and sufficient condition for fn being asymptotically U-shaped is that
limn→∞ fn0 (0) = f 0 (0) < 0 and limn→∞ fn0 (ϑn ) = f 0 (ϑ(x)) > 0. In fact, the former
condition is implied by the latter as then fn0 (t) changes sign at most once, but

Note that this has the same sign as f 0 (ϑ(x)). By Taylor expanding this expression
in x and ϑ we see that the dominating term for small ϑ is −4x. Hence fn is
not asymptotically U-shaped for sufficiently small x. To get a picture of what
happens when x increases, we divide (4.34) by x and plot as a function of ϑ, see
Figure 4. It is clear that there is a critical value x∗ slightly less than 0.0017 such
fn is asymptotically U-shaped if and only if x > x∗ . This proves the following
proposition:
Proposition 4.7. Let {v̂ n }∞
n=1 be a sequence of vertices, v̂ n ∈ Qn , such that
limn→∞ |v̂ n | /n exists and is strictly greater than x∗ . Then for ϑn as defined in
(3.17) we have B(v̂ n , ϑn ) = O(1).
Remark 4.8. Throughout this section we have only really been interested in deriving a tractable upper bound for B(v̂ n , ϑn ) without discussing sharpness. Nevertheless, it is not too hard to convince oneself that the bound given in Proposition
4.5 is sharp up to, say, a polynomial factor in n. However, for x < x∗ we know that
there exists an interval of positive length for t where fn (t) is positive, which would
then imply that B(v̂ n , ϑn ) diverges exponentially fast in n.

such that

(5.1)
lim inf P TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑn ≥ c0 .
n→∞

Since ϑn → ϑ(x) as n → ∞, this means in particular that for any ε > 0 we have

(5.2)
lim inf P TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑ(x) + ε ≥ c0 .
n→∞

Note that we can assume that c0 is independent of the choice of sequence.
Proposition 5.1. Let {v̂ n }∞
n=1 be a sequence as above, and let x = lim |v̂| /n.
Then, for any ε > 0 we have

(5.3)
P TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑ(x) + ε → 1
as n → ∞.
Proof. Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. Condition on the vertex passage times of all neighbors
of 0̂ and v̂ n . Assuming |v̂ n | ≥ 3, it is easy to see that the number of coordinate
places 1 ≤ i ≤ n with the property that the i:th coordinate of v̂ n is 1, and the cost

of both ei and v̂ n − ei are at most ε/3, is distributed as Bin |v̂ n | , (1 − e−ε/3 )2 .
Hence as n → ∞ it is clear that, with probability 1 − o(1), there are at least two
such coordiantes. Pick a pair i 6= j.
Depending on the choice of i and j, we define Q0 as the induced subgraph of Qn
with vertex set {v ∈ Qn : vi = 1, vj = 0}. We similarly define Q1 as the induced
subgraph of Qn with vertex set {v ∈ Qn : vi = 0, vj = 1}. Note that Q0 and Q1
are vertex disjoint subgraphs of Qn , both isomorphic to Qn−2 .
In light of Q0 and Q1 , we have two natural upper bounds for TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ), namely
c(ei ) + c(v̂ n − ej ) plus the smallest reduced vertex passage time for any path from
ei to v̂ n − ej in Q0 , and c(ej ) + c(v̂ n − ei ) plus the smallest reduced vertex passage
time for any path from ej to v̂ n − ei in Q1 . As the only vertices of Q0 and Q1 which
are neighbors of 0̂ or v̂ n are ei , ej , v̂ n − ei and v̂ n − ej , the reduced first-passage
times in Q0 and Q1 are independent of each other and each is distributed as the
reduced first-passage time between two vertices at distance |v̂ n | − 2 in Qn−2 . By
applying (5.2) to the first-passage percolation problems in Q0 and Q1 , we conclude
that for any ε > 0 and for any sequence {v̂ n }∞
n=1 where v̂ n ∈ Qn for each n ≥ 1
such that x = limn→∞ |v̂ n | /n exists and is at least 0.002, we have

(5.4)
lim inf P TV0 (0̂, v̂ n ) ≤ ϑ(x) + ε ≥ 1 − (1 − c0 )2 .
n→∞

Note that this is the same expression as (5.2), except that the right-hand side here
is strictly larger. Hence, by iteratively applying this argument, we see that we can
k
replace the right-hand side in (5.4) by ck = 1 − (1 − c0 )2 for any non-negative
integer k. The Proposition follows by letting k → ∞.
