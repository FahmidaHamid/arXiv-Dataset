Abstract Recommended standardized procedures for determining exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide (NO) have been developed by task forces
of the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society. These recommendations have paved the way for the measurement of nitric oxide to become
a diagnostic tool for specific clinical applications. It would be desirable to develop
similar guidelines for the sampling of other trace gases in exhaled breath, especially
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may reflect ongoing metabolism.
The concentrations of water-soluble, blood-borne substances in exhaled breath
are influenced by:
– breathing patterns affecting gas exchange in the conducting airways
– the concentrations in the tracheo-bronchial lining fluid
– the alveolar and systemic concentrations of the compound.
The classical Farhi equation takes only the alveolar concentrations into account. Realtime measurements of acetone in end-tidal breath under an ergometer challenge show
characteristics which cannot be explained within the Farhi setting. Here we develop
a compartment model that reliably captures these profiles and is capable of relating
breath to the systemic concentrations of acetone. By comparison with experimental
data it is inferred that the major part of variability in breath acetone concentrations
(e.g., in response to moderate exercise or altered breathing patterns) can be attributed
to airway gas exchange, with minimal changes of the underlying blood and tissue
concentrations. Moreover, the model illuminates the discrepancies between observed
and theoretically predicted blood-breath ratios of acetone during resting conditions,
i.e., in steady state. Particularly, the current formulation includes the classical Farhi
and the Scheid series inhomogeneity model as special limiting cases and thus is expected to have general relevance for a wider range of blood-borne inert gases.
The chief intention of the present modeling study is to provide mechanistic relationships for further investigating the exhalation kinetics of acetone and other watersoluble species. This quantitative approach is a first step towards new guidelines for
breath gas analyses of volatile organic compounds, similar to those for nitric oxide.

1 Introduction
Measurement of blood-borne volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurring in human exhaled breath as a result of normal metabolic activity or pathological disorders
has emerged as a promising novel methodology for non-invasive medical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of disease, drug testing and tracking of physiological
processes [2,3,1,73,57]. Apart from the obvious improvement in patient compliance
and tolerability, major advantages of exhaled breath analysis compared to conventional test procedures, e.g., based on blood or urine probes, include de facto unlimited availability as well as rapid on-the-spot evaluation or even real-time analysis.
Additionally, it has been pointed out that the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output and therefore the breath concentrations of such compounds might
provide a more faithful estimate of pooled systemic concentrations than single smallvolume blood samples, which will always be affected by local hemodynamics and
blood-tissue interactions [65].
Despite this huge potential, the use of exhaled breath analysis within a clinical setting
is still rather limited. This is mainly due to the fact that drawing reproducible breath
samples remains an intricate task that has not fully been standardized yet. Moreover,
inherent error sources introduced by the complex mechanisms driving pulmonary gas
exchange are still poorly understood. The lack of standardization among the different
sampling protocols proposed in the literature has led to the development of various
sophisticated sampling systems, which selectively extract end-tidal air by discarding
anatomical dead space volume [42,28,13]). Even though such setups present some
progress, they are far from being perfect. In particular, these sampling systems can
usually not account for the variability stemming from varying physiological states.
In common measurement practice it is often tacitly assumed that end-tidal air will
reflect the alveolar concentration CA , which in turn is proportional to the concentration of the VOC in mixed venous blood Cv̄ , with the associated factor depending on
the substance-specific blood:gas partition coefficient λb:air (describing the diffusion
equilibrium between capillaries and alveoli), alveolar ventilation V̇A (governing the
transport of the compound through the respiratory tree) and cardiac output Q̇c (controlling the rate at which the VOC is delivered to the lungs):
Cmeasured = CA =

Cv̄

λb:air + V̇Q̇A

.

c

This is the familiar equation introduced by Farhi [21], describing steady state inert
gas elimination from the lung viewed as a single alveolar compartment with a fixed
overall ventilation-perfusion ratio V̇A /Q̇c close to one. Since the pioneering work
of Farhi, both equalities in the above relation have been challenged. Firstly, for low
blood soluble inert gases, characterized by λb:air ≤ 10, alveolar concentrations resulting from an actually constant Cv̄ can easily be seen to vary drastically in response to
fluctuations in blood or respiratory flow (see also [43,41] for some recent findings in
this context). While this sensitivity has been exploited in MIGET (Multiple Inert Gas
Elimination Technique, cf. [93,92]) to assess ventilation-perfusion inhomogeneity

4

throughout the normal and diseased lung, it is clearly problematic in standard breath
sampling routines based on free breathing, as slightly changing measurement conditions (regarding, e.g., body posture, breathing patterns or stress) can have a large impact on the observed breath concentration [19]. This constitutes a typical example of
an inherent error source as stated above, potentially leading to a high degree of intraand consequently inter-individual variability among the measurement results [64].
It is hence important to investigate the influence of medical parameters like cardiac
output, pulse, breathing rate and breathing volume on VOC concentrations in exhaled
breath. In contrast, while highly soluble VOCs (λb:air > 10) tend to be less affected
by changes in ventilation and perfusion, measurement artifacts associated with this
class of compounds result from the fact that – due to their often hydrophilic properties – a substantial interaction between the exhalate and the mucosa layers lining
the conducting airways can be anticipated [6]. In other words, for these substances
Cmeasured 6= CA , with the exact quantitative relationship being unknown. Examples
of endogenous compounds that are released into the gas phase not only through the
blood-alveolar interface, but also through the bronchial lining fluid are, e.g., acetone
and ethanol [7,89].
Acetone (2-propanone; CAS number 67–64–1; molar mass 58.08 g/mol) is one
of the most abundant VOCs found in human breath and has received wide attention
in the biomedical literature. Being a natural metabolic intermediate of lipolysis [38],
endogenous acetone has been considered as a biomarker for monitoring the ketotic
state of diabetic and fasting individuals [86,68,72,78], estimating glucose levels [22]
or assessing fat loss [49]. Nominal levels in breath and blood have been established
in [94,77], and bioaccumulation has been studied in the framework of exposure studies and pharmacokinetic modeling [98,47,59].
Despite this relatively large body of experimental evidence, the crucial link between acetone levels in breath and blood is still obscure, thus hindering the development of validated breath tests for diagnostic purposes. For perspective, multiplying
the proposed population mean of approximately 1 µ g/l [77] in end-tidal breath by the
partition coefficient λb:air = 340 [7] at body temperature appears to grossly underestimate observed (arterial) blood levels spreading around 1 mg/l [94,98,40]. Furthermore, breath profiles of acetone (and other highly soluble volatile compounds such as
2-pentanone or methyl acetate) associated with moderate workload ergometer challenges of normal healthy volunteers drastically depart from the trend suggested by
Equation (1) [42,43]. In particular, the physiological meaning of these discrepancies
has not been established in sufficient depth.
With the background material of the previous paragraphs in mind, we view acetone as a paradigmatic example for the analysis of highly soluble, blood-borne VOCs,
even though it cannot cover the whole spectrum of different physico-chemical characteristics. The emphasis of this paper is on developing a mechanistic description
of end-tidal acetone behavior during different physiological states (e.g., rest, exercise, sleep and exposure scenarios). Such a quantitative approach will contribute to
a better understanding regarding the relevance of observable breath concentrations
of highly soluble trace gases with respect to the underlying endogenous situation and
hence constitutes an indispensable prerequisite for guiding the interpretation of future

5

breath test results. Moreover, it will allow for a standardized examination of the information content and predictive power of various breath sampling regimes proposed
in the literature. Specifically, our work also aims at complementing previous studies
centered on single breath dynamics during resting conditions [89,35,5,7,47].
By adopting the usual compartmental approach [46,17,59,71] our formulation is
simple in the sense that no detailed anatomical features of the respiratory tract must
be taken into account. Although models of this type have been criticized for their underlying assumptions [24] (e.g., regarding the cyclic nature of breathing), they prove
as valuable tools for capturing both short-term behavior as indicated above and phenomena that are characteristic for sampling scenarios extending over minutes or even
hours. Consequently, while the physical derivation to be presented here is clearly
driven by the well-established theory covering soluble gas exchange in a single exhalation framework, it extends these ideas to a macroscopic level, thus yielding a model
that can serve as a template for studying the mid- to long-term kinetics of acetone and
similar volatile organic compounds in breath and various parts of the human body

2 Experimental basics
Here we shall briefly discuss the experimental background pertinent to our own phenomenological findings presented throughout the paper. In particular, these results
were obtained with the necessary approvals by the Ethics Committee of the Innsbruck Medical University. All volunteers gave written informed consent.
Breath acetone concentrations are assessed by means of a real-time setup designed for synchronized measurements of exhaled breath VOCs as well as a variety
of respiratory and hemodynamic parameters, see Fig. 1. Extensive details are given
in [42].
The breath-related part of the mentioned setup consists of a head mask spirometer
system allowing for the standardized extraction of predefined exhalation segments
which – via a heated and gas tight Teflon transfer line – are then directly drawn into
a Proton-Transfer-Reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS, Ionicon Analytik GmbH,
Innsbruck, Austria) for online analysis. This analytical technique has proven to be
a sensitive method for quantification of volatile molecular species M down to the
ppb (parts per billion) range on the basis of “soft” chemical ionization within a drift
chamber, i.e., by taking advantage of the proton transfer
H3 O+ + M → MH+ + H2 O
from primary hydronium precursor ions originating in an adjoint hollow cathode [52,
53]. Note that this reaction scheme is selective to VOCs with proton affinities higher
than water (166.5 kcal/mol), thereby precluding the ionization of the bulk composition exhaled air, N2 , O2 and CO2 . Count rates of the resulting product ions MH+ or
fragments thereof appearing at specified mass-to-charge ratios m/z can subsequently
be converted to absolute concentrations of the protonated compounds (see [76] for
further details on the quantification of acetone as well as [42] for the underlying
PTR-MS settings used). The carbon dioxide concentration CCO2 of the gas sample

6

is determined by a separate sensor (AirSense Model 400, Digital Control Systems,
Portland, USA).

correspond to measurable variables. The selective analysis of predefined breath segments is ensured by
flow-triggered sample extraction.

In addition to the breath concentration profiles of acetone, it will be of importance
for us to have at hand a continuous estimate of the corresponding sample water vapor
content Cwater . As has been put forward in the literature, the water dimer (H3 O+ )H2 O
can be used for this purpose [96,4]. More specifically, the corresponding pseudo concentration signal at m/z = 37 calculated according to Equation (1) in [76] using a
standard reaction rate constant of 2.0 × 10−9 cm3 /s yields a quantity roughly proportional to sample humidity. Slight variations due to fluctuations of the (unknown)
amount of water clusters forming in the ion source are assumed to be negligible.
Absolute quantification can be achieved by comparison with standards containing
predefined humidity levels. Such standards with CCO2 and Cwater varying over the experimental physiological range of 2 – 8% and 2 – 6%, respectively, were prepared
using a commercial gas mixing unit (Gaslab, Breitfuss Messtechnik GmbH, Harpstedt, Germany), resulting in a mean calibration factor of 2.1 × 10−4 and R2 ≥ 0.98 for
all regressions. It has been argued in [39] that the aforementioned pseudo concentration can drastically be affected by the carbon dioxide concentration, which, however,
could not be confirmed with our PTR-MS settings. Although the computed water
content is slightly overestimated with increasing CCO2 , the sensitivity was found to
stay within 10% of the mean value given above. Nevertheless, we recognize that this
approximate method for determining water vapor levels can only serve as a first surrogate for more exact hygrometer measurements.

7

Despite the fact that molecular oxygen is not protonated, the breath oxygen concentration CO2 – relative to an assumed steady state value of about 100 mmHg in
end-tidal (alveolar) air during rest [54] – within one single experiment can still be
assessed by monitoring the parasitic precursor ion O+
2 at m/z = 32. This ion results
from a small amount of sample gas entering the ion source with subsequent ionization
of O2 under electron impact [65]. For normalization purposes, the respective count
rates are again converted to pseudo concentrations. Table 1 summarizes the measured
quantities relevant for this paper. In general, breath concentrations will always refer
to end-tidal levels, except where explicitly noted. Moreover, a typical sampling interval of 5 s is assumed for each variable (corresponding to breath-by-breath extraction
of end-tidal VOC levels at a normal breathing rate of 12 tides/min).

3 Acetone modeling
3.1 Preliminaries and assumptions
Classical pulmonary inert gas elimination theory [21] postulates that uptake and removal of VOCs takes place exclusively in the alveolar region. While this is a reasonable assumption for low soluble substances, it has been shown by several authors that
exhalation kinetics of VOCs with high affinity for blood and water such as acetone
are heavily influenced by relatively quick absorption and release mechanisms occurring in the conductive airways (see, e.g., [5] for a good overview of this topic). More
specifically, due to their pronounced hydrophilic characteristics such compounds tend
to interact with the water-like mucus membrane lining this part of the respiratory tree,
thereby leading to pre- and post-alveolar gas exchange often referred to as washin/wash-out behavior. The present model aims at taking into consideration two major
aspects in this framework.
3.1.1 Bronchial exchange
It is now an accepted fact that the bronchial tree plays an important role in overall
pulmonary gas exchange of highly (water) soluble trace gases, affecting both endogenous clearance as well as exogenous uptake. For perspective, Anderson et al. [7] in-

8

ferred that while fresh air is being inhaled, it becomes enriched with acetone stored in
the airway surface walls of the peripheral bronchial tract, thus leading to a decrease
of the acetone pressure/tension gradient between gas phase and capillary blood in
the alveolar space. This causes an effective reduction of the driving force for gas
exchange in the alveoli and minimizes the unloading of the capillary acetone level.
Correspondingly, during exhalation the aforementioned diffusion process is reversed,
with a certain amount of acetone being stripped from the air stream and redepositing
onto the previously depleted mucus layer. As a phenomenological consequence, exhaled breath concentrations of acetone and other highly water soluble substances tend
to be diminished on their way up from the deeper respiratory tract to the airway opening, thereby decreasing overall elimination as compared to purely alveolar extraction.
Similarly, exposition studies suggest a pre-alveolar absorption of exogenous acetone
during inhalation and a post-alveolar revaporization during expiration, resulting in a
lower systemic uptake compared to what would be expected if the exchange occurred
completely in the alveoli [98,47,87].
From the above, quantitative assessments examining the relationships between
the measured breath concentrations and the underlying alveolar levels are complex
and need to take into account a variety of factors, such as airway temperature profiles
and airway perfusion as well as breathing patterns [5,6].
In accordance with previous modeling approaches, we consider a bronchial compartment separated into a gas phase and a mucus membrane, which is assumed to
inherit the physical properties of water and acts as a reservoir for acetone [47,59].
Part of the acetone dissolved in this layer is transferred to the bronchial circulation,
whereby the major fraction of the associated venous drainage is postulated to join the
pulmonary veins via the postcapillary anastomoses [54]. A study by Morris et al. [61]
on airway perfusion during moderate exercise in humans indicates that the fraction
qbro ∈ [0, 1) of cardiac output Q̇c contributing to this part of bronchial perfusion will
slightly decrease with increasing pulmonary blood flow. According to Figure 3 from
their paper and assuming that Q̇rest
c = 6 l/min we can derive the heuristic linear model
rest
qbro (Q̇c ) := max{0, qrest
bro (1 − 0.06(Q̇c − Q̇c ))}.

(2)

The constant qrest
bro will be estimated in Section 4. As a rough upper bound we propose
the initial guess qrest
bro = 0.01 [54]. We stress the fact that the bronchial compartment
just introduced has to be interpreted as an abstract control volume lumping together
the decisive sites of airway gas exchange in one homogeneous functional unit. These
locations can be expected to vary widely with the solubility of the VOC under scrutiny
as well as with physiological boundary conditions [5].
3.1.2 Temperature dependence
There is strong experimental evidence that airway temperature constitutes a major
determinant for the pulmonary exchange of highly soluble VOCs, cf. [36]. In particular, changes in airway temperature can be expected to affect the solubility of acetone
and similar compounds in the mucus surface of the respiratory tree. It will hence be

9

important to specify a tentative relationship capturing such influences on the observable breath levels. As will be rationalized below, this may be achieved by taking into
account the absolute humidity of the extracted breath samples.
Passing through the conditioning regions of the upper airways, inhaled air is
warmed to a mean body core temperature of approximately 37◦ C and fully saturated
with water vapor, thus leading to an absolute humidity of alveolar air of about 6.2%
at ambient pressure. During exhalation, depending on the axial temperature gradient
between the lower respiratory tract and the airway opening, a certain amount of water
vapor will condense out and reduce the water content Cwater in the exhalate according
to the saturation water vapor pressure Pwater (in mbar) determined by local airway
temperature T (in ◦ C) [56,27]. The relationship between these two quantities can be
approximated by the well-known Magnus formula [80]


(3)
Pwater (T ) = 6.112 exp
243.12 + T
valid for a temperature range −45◦ C ≤ T ≤ 60◦ C. For normal physiological values of
T , the resulting pressure is sufficiently small to treat water vapor as an ideal gas [70]
and hence by applying Dalton’s law we conclude that absolute humidity Cwater (in %)
of the exhalate varies according to
Cwater (T ) = 100

Pwater (T )

Pambient

(4)

where Pambient is the ambient pressure. Inverting the above formula, the minimum airway temperature Tmin = Tmin (Cwater ) during exhalation becomes a function of measured water content in exhaled breath. From this, a mean airway and mucus temperature characterizing the homogeneous bronchial compartment of the previous section
will be defined as
Tmin (Cwater ) + 37
T̄ (Cwater ) :=
,
(5)
2
corresponding to a hypothesized linear increase of temperature along the airways.
Note that this assumption is somehow arbitrary in the sense that the characteristic
temperature of the airways should be matched to the primary (time- and solubilitydependent) location of airway gas exchange as mentioned above. Equation (5) thus
should only be seen as a simple ad hoc compromise incorporating this variability.
The decrease of acetone solubility in the mucosa – expressed as the water:air
partition coefficient λmuc:air – with increasing temperature can be described in the
ambient temperature range by a van’t Hoff-type equation [82]
log10 λmuc:air (T ) = −A +

B
,
T + 273.15

(6)

where A = 3.742 and B = 1965 Kelvin are proportional to the entropy and enthalpy
of volatilization, respectively. Hence, in a hypothetical situation where the absolute
sample humidity at the mouth is 4.7% (corresponding to a temperature of T ≈ 32◦ C
and ambient pressure at sea level, cf. [56,26]), local solubility of acetone in the mucus

10

layer increases from λmuc:air (37◦ C) = 392 in the lower respiratory tract (cf. [46]) to
λmuc:air (32◦ C) = 498 at the mouth, thereby predicting a drastic reduction of air stream
acetone concentrations along the airways. The above formulations allow one to assess
this reduction by taking into account sample water vapor as a meta parameter. This
meta parameter reflects various influential factors on the mucus solubility λmuc:air
which would otherwise be intricate to handle due to a lack of information, such as
local airway perfusion, breathing patterns, mucosal hydration and thermoregulatory
events which in turn will affect axial temperature profiles. In particular, λmuc:air for
the entire bronchial compartment will be estimated via the mean airway temperature
T̄ in Equation (5) as
λmuc:air (T̄ ) = λmuc:air (T̄ (Cwater )).
(7)
The strong coupling between sample humidity and exhaled breath concentrations
predicted by the two relationships (3) and (6) is expected to be a common factor
for all highly water soluble VOCs. In the framework of breath alcohol measurements
Lindberg et al. [51] indeed showed a positive correlation between these two quantities
along the course of exhalation, which can also be observed in the case of acetone,
cf. Fig. 2.
Variations of the acetone blood:air partition coefficient λb:air = 340 [7,20] – dominating alveolar gas exchange – in response to changes in mixed venous blood temperature, e.g., due to exercise, are ignored as such changes are necessarily small [16].
Hence, λb:air will always refer to 37◦ C. Similarly, the partition coefficient between
mucosa and blood is treated as a constant defined by

λmuc:b := λmuc:air (37◦ C)/λb:air ,

(8)

resulting in a value of 1.15. Note, that if the airway temperature is below 37◦ C we
always have that
λmuc:air /λmuc:b ≥ λb:air ,
(9)
as λmuc:air is monotonically decreasing with increasing temperature, see Equation (6).
3.1.3 Bronchio-alveolar interactions
In a series of modeling studies [89,5], the location of gas exchange has been demonstrated to shift between bronchial and alveolar regions depending on the solubility
of the compound under investigation. During tidal breathing exchange for substances
with blood:air partition coefficient λb:air ≤ 10 takes place almost exclusively in the
alveoli, while it appears to be strictly limited to the bronchial tract in the case of
λb:air ≥ 100. Transport for VOCs lying within these two extremes distributes between
both spaces. Likewise, for fixed λb:air , the location of gas exchange is expected to
vary with breathing patterns. As has been concluded by Anderson et al. [7], airway
contribution to overall pulmonary exchange of endogenous acetone is about 96%
during tidal breathing, but only 73% when inhaling to total lung capacity. The rationale for this reduction is that while more proximal parts of the mucosa lining are
being depleted earlier in the course of inhalation by losing acetone to the inhalate,
saturation of the air stream with acetone is continuously shifted towards the alveolar
region. Furthermore, it can be argued that the magnitude of this shift increases with

exhalations of a normal healthy volunteer at an approximately constant rate of 150 ml/s. Water-acetone
pairs in the third panel correspond to the two linear Phase 3 segments as described in [7]. The high
sampling frequency in this example is achieved by collecting breath over the entire breath cycle (as opposed
to the selective end-tidal extraction regime described in Section 2) as well as by limiting PTR-MS detection
to only three mass-to-charge ratios (with corresponding dwell times given in brackets): m/z = 21 (5 ms),
m/z = 37 (2 ms) and m/z = 59 (10 ms).

volumetric flow during inhalation as equilibration of fresh air with the mucus layer
in regions with high flow rates might not be completed. From a reversed viewpoint
this would be consistent with the observation made in [7] that end-exhaled acetone
partial pressures increase with exhaled flow rate.
Such smooth transitions in the location of gas exchange can be incorporated
into the model by including a diffusion process describing the interaction between
bronchial and alveolar compartment (cf. Fig. 3), which is similar to the strategy found
in the theory of stratified or series inhomogeneities developed by Scheid et al. [74].

12

According to the approach presented there, series inhomogeneities stem from the fact
that while gas flow in the upper parts of the respiratory tree is primarily dominated by
convection, axial diffusion becomes the decisive factor in the terminal airspaces. This
can also be thought of as an incomplete mixing of tidal volume with the functional
residual capacity, thus leading to the formation of an effective gas diffusion barrier
between the proximal and distal parts of the alveolar space. Scheid et al. quantify this
effect by means of a (substance-specific) stratified conductance parameter D, taking
values in the interval [0, ∞). As D approaches zero, the retention (defined as the ratio
between steady state partial pressures in arterial and mixed venous blood) of inert
gases eliminated from the blood increases, while excretion (the ratio between partial pressures in mixed expired air and mixed venous blood) decreases. Hence, small
values of D correspond to a reduced overall gas exchange efficiency of the lungs.
It will be shown that reinterpreting the concept of stratified inhomogeneity and the
stratified conductance parameter D in the framework of soluble gas exchange allows
for a proper description of the bronchio-alveolar interactions discussed above. The
particular role of D within the present framework will be clarified in Section 3.2.2.
The alveolar region itself is represented by one single homogeneous alveolar unit,
thereby neglecting ventilation-perfusion inequality throughout the lung. In the case of
VOCs with high λb:air this constitutes an acceptable simplification, since the classical
Farhi equation predicts a minimal influence of local ventilation-perfusion ratios on
the corresponding alveolar concentrations. Uptake and elimination of VOCs to and
from the bronchio-alveolar tract during inhalation and exhalation is governed by the
alveolar ventilation V̇A (defined as the gas volume per time unit filling the alveoli and
the exchanging bronchial tubes).
3.1.4 Body compartments
The systemic part of the model has been adapted from previous models [46,59] and
consists of two functional units: a liver compartment, where acetone is endogenously
produced and metabolized, as well as a tissue compartment representing an effective storage volume. The latter basically lumps together tissue groups with similar
blood:tissue partition coefficient λb:tis ≈ 1.38, such as richly perfused tissue, muscles
and skin [7,59]. Due to the low fractional perfusion of adipose tissue and its low
affinity for acetone, an extra fat compartment is not considered. The fractional blood
flow qliv ∈ (0, 1) to the liver is assumed to be related to total cardiac output by
qliv (Q̇c ) := 0.034 + 1.145 exp(−1.387Q̇c/Q̇rest
c ),

(10)

obtained by exponential fitting of the data given in [59]. The rate Ṁ of acetone
metabolism is assumed to obey the Michaelis-Menten (saturation) kinetics
Ṁ =

vmaxCliv λb:liv
,
km + Cliv λb:liv

(11)

with vmax , km > 0, or the linear kinetics
Ṁ = klin bw0.75Cliv λb:liv =: kmetCliv λb:liv ,

(12)

13

where “bw” denotes the body weight in kg. The rate constant klin can be obtained by
linearization of (11), i.e.,
klin := vmax /km ≈ 0.0037 l/kg0.75 /min,

(13)

according to the values given in [46].
Remark 1 Taking into account nominal mixed venous blood concentrations of approximately 1 mg/l for healthy volunteers as well as an apparent Michaelis-Menten
constant km = 84 mg/l [46], linear kinetics will be sufficient for describing most
situations encountered in practice. Typical exceptions include, e.g., severe diabetic
ketoacidosis or starvation ketosis, where plasma concentrations up to 500 mg/l have
been reported [68,72] and hence metabolism can be expected to reach saturation.
Other ways of acetone clearance such as excretion via the renal system are neglected,
cf. [98]. Endogenous synthesis of acetone in the liver is assumed to occur at some rate
kpr > 0 depending on current lipolysis [38]. In particular, fat catabolism is considered
a long-term mechanism compared to the other dynamics of the system, so that kpr
can in fact be assumed constant during the course of experiments presented here (less
than 2 hours).

3.2 Model equations and a priori analysis
3.2.1 Derivation
In order to capture the gas exchange and tissue distribution mechanisms presented
above, the model consists of four different compartments. A sketch of the model
structure is given in Fig. 3 and will be detailed in following.
Model equations are derived by taking into account standard conservation of mass
laws for the individual compartments, see Appendix A.2. Local diffusion equilibria
are assumed to hold at the air-tissue, tissue-blood and air-blood interfaces, the ratio
of the corresponding concentrations being described by the appropriate partition coefficients, e.g., λb:air . Unlike for low blood soluble compounds, the amount of highly
soluble gas dissolved in local blood volume of perfused compartments cannot generally be neglected, as it might significantly increase the corresponding capacities.
This is particularly true for the airspace compartments. Since reliable data for some
local blood volumes could not be found, in order not to overload the model with
too many hypothetical parameters, we will use the effective compartment volumes
Ṽbro := Vbro + Vmuc λmuc:air , ṼA := VA + Vc′ λb:air , Ṽliv := Vliv + Vliv,b λb:liv as well as
Ṽtis := Vtis and neglect blood volumes for the mucosal and tissue compartment, see
also Appendix A.2.

(metabolism and production) and tissue (storage). Dashed boundaries indicate a diffusion equilibrium. The
conductance parameter D has units of volume divided by time and quantifies an effective diffusion barrier
between the bronchial and the alveolar tract, cf. Section 3.2.2.

are the associated concentrations in mixed venous and arterial blood, respectively.
Moreover, we state that measured (end-tidal) breath concentrations equal bronchial
levels, i.e.,
Cmeasured = Cbro .
(20)
The decoupled case D = qbro = 0 will be excluded further on in this paper as it lacks
physiological relevance.
Some fundamental model properties are discussed in Appendix B. In particular,
the components of the state variable c := (Cbro ,CA ,Cliv ,Ctis )T remain non-negative,
bounded and will approach a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium ce (u) once
the measurable external inputs u := (V̇A , Q̇c ,VT , λmuc:air (Cwater ),CI ) affecting the system are fixed. This corresponds, e.g., to the situation encountered during rest or constant workload.
3.2.2 Steady state relationships and interpretation of the stratified conductance
parameter D
Assume that the system is in steady state and we know the associated end-tidal breath
concentration Cmeasured = Cbro . Furthermore, we define the bronchial and alveolar
ventilation-perfusion ratio as
rbro :=

V̇A
qbro Q̇c

and rA :=

V̇A

respectively. If D = 0 we deduce that

corresponding to purely bronchial gas exchange. On the other hand, for D → ∞ it can

In the following, let CI = 0. Note that then in both cases the physiological boundary
condition Cv̄ ≥ Ca is respected. Substituting qbro = 0 into (22) yields the well-known
Farhi equations describing purely alveolar gas exchange.

16

Consequently, D defines the location of gas exchange in accordance with Section 3.1.3,
while qbro determines to what extent the bronchial compartment acts as an inert tube.
In this sense, Equations (14)–(17) define a generalized description of gas exchange
including several known models as special cases. This hierarchy is summarized in
Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 Equations (14)–(17) viewed as generalized model including several gas exchange mechanisms as

For perspective – as has been rationalized in the case of acetone in Section 3.1.3
and is likely to be a common characteristic for all highly water soluble VOCs – the
stratified conductance parameter D will be close to zero during rest and is expected
to increase with tidal volume and/or flow rate [90,5]. We propose to model this dependency as
D := Drest + kdiff,1 max{0,VT − VTrest } + kdiff,2 max{0, V̇A − V̇Arest }, kdiff, j ≥ 0, (23)
which will further be justified in Section 4.3.
From a practical point of view, we stress the fact that if D is close to zero, calculating blood levels from Cmeasured by using Equation (21) or taking advantage of this
expression for normalization and/or correction purposes is critical due to the possibly
large influence of the term rbro as well as due to the high degree of uncertainty with
respect to qbro and λmuc:air . Particularly, from the aforementioned facts this means
that measured breath concentrations of acetone (and generally highly water soluble
substances) determined during resting conditions and free breathing can be rather
misleading indicators for endogenous levels, even if sampling occurs under well defined standard conditions (for instance – as is common practice – using CO2 - and/or
flow-controlled extraction from the end-tidal exhalation segment). This has first been
recognized in the context of breath alcohol measurements revealing experimentally
obtained blood-breath concentration ratios of ethanol during tidal breathing that are
unexpectedly high compared with in vitro partition coefficients [37]. An elegant approach proposed to circumvent this problem is isothermal rebreathing [37,66], which

17

aims at creating conditions where (cf. Equation (21))
Cmeasured = CI = CA = Cbro =

(24)

from which the mixed venous blood concentration can easily be determined by multiplying the measured rebreathing concentration with the anticipated blood:air partition
coefficient at body temperature. A quantitative evaluation of this experimental technique by means of the above model can be found in the technical report [44].

4 Model validation and estimation
4.1 A priori identifiability
One of the purposes of our tentative model is to provide a basis for estimating (unknown) compartment concentrations c as well as certain acetone-specific parameters
p j ∈ {kpr , kmet , vmax , km , D, qrest
bro } from the knowledge of measured breath and blood
concentrations y. Often over-looked, a necessary requirement in this framework is
the a priori (or structural) identifiability/observability of the model, which basically
checks whether in an ideal context of an error-free model and continuous, noise-free
measurements there exist functions u (or, in other words, conductible experiments)
such that the associated output y (the accessible data) carries enough information to
enable an unambiguous determination of all unknown states and parameters. Particularly, this avoids an inherent over-parameterization of the model. As the time evolution of the system (14)–(17) for a given u is fixed once the initial conditions c0 at the
start of the experiment are known, the analysis of a priori identifiability/observability
hence amounts to studying (local) injectivity of y with respect to c0 and the parameters p j under scrutiny. Evidently, if such a property does not hold then any attempt
to reliably estimate these quantities from y is doomed to failure from the start, as
two entirely different parameter combinations can yield exactly the same data. In
the present context, generic a priori identifiability/observability for c0 and any selection of parameters p j as above was confirmed by interpreting the latter as additional states with time derivative zero and subjecting the augmented system to the
Hermann-Krener rank criterion [29] (see Appendix C). In particular, the sufficient
condition in (53) was fulfilled for both y = Cbro and y = Ca as given in Equations (20)
and (19), respectively.

4.2 Simulation of exposure data and model calibration
Generally speaking, in vivo data on acetone dynamics in the human organism are
very limited. Indeed, experimental efforts to date have centered on quantifying bioaccumulation/biotransformation as well as body burden within occupational exposure
settings. The study by Wigaeus et al. [98] represents the most extensive research
in this context (including breath as well as simultaneous blood measurements), thus

18

rendering it as a convenient benchmark for confirming the appropriateness of models
involving descriptions of systemic acetone distribution, cf. [46,59].
In the following we will calibrate the unknown kinetic rate constants, the fractional bronchial blood flow, as well as the equilibrium tissue levels c0 at rest, by
subjecting the proposed model to the Series 1 exposure scenario published in [98].
Briefly, this data set comprises acetone concentration profiles in exhaled breath, arterial and (presumably peripheral) venous blood of eight normal male volunteers, who
were exposed to an atmosphere containing 1.3 mg/l of acetone over a period of two
hours. Particularly, all measurements correspond to resting conditions.
Since the major goal here is to extract approximate nominal values for the abovementioned physiological parameters rather than individual estimates, the model will
be fitted to the pooled data of all eight test subjects. For this purpose, we assume
that the exposure starts after ten minutes of quiet tidal breathing, i.e., the inhaled
concentration is given by the scaled indicator function CI (t) = 1.3 χ[10,130](t) and set
alveolar ventilation and cardiac output to constant resting values V̇Arest = 6 l/min and
Q̇rest
c = 5.8 l/min, respectively [59,46]. Tissue volumes and partition coefficients are
as in Table 3 for a male of height 180 cm and weight 70 kg. Since the nominal acetone concentration in hepatic venous blood is a priori unknown, acetone metabolism
is assumed to follow a Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a fixed apparent Michaelis
constant km = 84 mg/l (cf. Equation (11)). Our aim is to determine the parameter
vector p = (vmax , kpr , Drest , qrest
bro ) as well as the nominal endogenous steady state levels c0 by solving the ordinary least squares problem

Here, g is the right-hand side of the ODE system (14)–(17), Ca,i is the measured arterial blood concentration at time instant ti , whereas the predicted arterial concentration
Ca is defined as in Equation (19). The endogenous level Ca (0) = 1 mg/l was chosen
in accordance with the population mean values given in [38,98].
The above minimization problem was solved by implementing a multiple shooting routine [15] in Matlab. This iterative method can be seen as a generalization of
the standard Gauss-Newton algorithm for solving constrained ordinary least squares
problems, treating (25) in the framework of multipoint boundary value problems (see
also [83] for an early illustration). Further details regarding the general scope of
multiple shooting as well as its superior stability compared with classical solution
schemes can be found in [14,15,69,91]. For a variety of applications and modifications proposed for covering PDEs and delay differential equations the interested
reader is referred to [62,30].
Derivatives of Ca with respect to (c0 , p) were computed by simultaneously solving the associated variational equations [25]. The minimization procedure was repeated several times with randomly assigned starting values in the interval (0, 1).
Convergence was assumed to be achieved when the maximum componentwise relative change between two successive parameter refinements was less than 0.1%, re-

19

sulting in the same estimates for all trials considered, cf. Table 2. Figure 5 shows that
the calibrated model can faithfully reproduce the basic features of the observed data.
Remark 2 The practical identifiability of the estimates inTable 2 was examined by
calculating the rank of the extended Jacobian J := ST Z T , where S is the sensitivity
function matrix having rows

and Z denotes the Jacobian associated with the equality constraints in (25). More
specifically, we adopted the standard numerical rank criterion
rank J = max{k; σk > ε kJk∞ },

(27)

where σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ . . . ≥ 0 are the singular values of J and ε = 10−8 reflects the maximum relative error of the calculated sensitivities [23]. Accordingly, we find that J has
full rank, suggesting that all estimated quantities are practically identifiable [18,33].

Anticipated (literature) values of c0 and p compare favorably to those obtained by
the aforementioned minimization, thus consolidating the physiological plausibility of
the extracted estimates. In particular, the fitted value of the gas exchange location parameter Drest = 0 agrees well with what is expected from the theoretical discussion
in Section 3.2.2. The rate at which endogenous acetone forms in healthy adults as
a result of normal fat catabolism is not known. However, from the study on acetone
metabolism in lean and obese humans during starvation ketosis published by Reichard et al. [72] a rather conservative upper bound for kpr can be derived to lie in
the range of 2 mg/min. A diminished fractional bronchial perfusion qrest
bro might reflect the fact that the assumption of diffusion equilibrium between the mucosa lining
and the deeper vascularized sections of the airway wall is rather stringent, so that
actually less acetone is transported away from the peripheral bronchial tract via the
bloodstream. On the other hand qrest
bro = 0.01 refers to the entire bronchial circulation rather than only the part contributing to anatomic right-to-left shunt as discussed
in Section 3.1.1. The fitted steady state value for the measured breath concentration
Cmeasured (0) = Cbro (0) = 0.0016 mg/l during normal breathing at rest is only slightly
higher than the observed levels spreading around 500 ppb (corresponding to about
0.0011 mg/l) [77,42].

Remark 3 Fig. 5 clearly illustrates the necessity of taking into account the conducting
airways as an additional compartment for exchange of highly soluble substances. In
particular, the observed data profiles are in sharp contrast to the classical Farhi inert
tube description, predicting arterial blood concentrations to be directly proportional
to (alveolar) breath concentrations. Contrarily, by taking into account pre-alveolar uptake as discussed in Section 3.1.1, the accumulation of exogenous acetone in the systemic circulation is expected to be delayed due to the small contribution of bronchial
blood flow to overall perfusion.
Remark 4 The population spread of the fitted parameters within the study cohort
could be assessed, e.g., by a Bayesian [60] or mixed effects approach [45], which,
however would be beyond the scope of this paper. Here, the major aim rather is to
demonstrate the flexibility of the model in covering a wide spectrum of different
experimental scenarios.
From an operational perspective, one may consider the results stated in the previous paragraphs as a model tuning procedure for resting conditions. Accordingly,
in the remaining part of this paper both the stratified conductance parameter and
the fractional bronchial blood flow during rest will be frozen at their fitted values

21

Drest = 0 and qrest
bro = 0.0043, respectively. Moreover, due to the high value of the
apparent Michaelis constant km as compared to the estimated acetone concentration
λb:livCliv in hepatic venous blood, acetone clearance from the liver can safely be postulated to obey linear kinetics in the sequel, cf. Equation (12). In particular, the extracted value of klin = vmax /km = 0.0074 l/kg0.75 /min is interpreted as an intrinsic
property of acetone metabolism (with inter-individual variation being introduced by
multiplication with the 0.75 power of body weight). Hence, kmet as in Equation (12)
will be treated as a known constant parameter in the sequel.

4.3 Ergometer data sets and comparative evaluations
As has been indicated in the introduction, a primary motivation for this work was to
develop a model elucidating the features of breath acetone behavior observed during
moderate workload ergometer challenges. A representative profile corresponding to
one single normal healthy volunteer is shown in Fig. 6, cf. [42]. As has been demonstrated there, end-tidal acetone levels in response to exercise generally resemble the
profile of alveolar ventilation and inhalation volume, showing abrupt increases and
drops in the range of 10 – 40% at the onsets and stops of the individual workload
periods, respectively (see also Fig. 6 (a), first panel). Similarly, a series of auxiliary
experiments carried out by means of the same instrumental setup revealed that increasing tidal volume during rest results in increased breath acetone concentrations,
while increasing respiratory frequency has a less pronounced impact, cf. Fig. 6 (b).
Both effects appear to support the hypothesis of Section 3.1.3 that acetone exchange
is strongly influenced by volume and speed of inhalation and hence suggest that any
model not incorporating this mechanism will fail to reproduce the above results. In
particular, note that from the viewpoint of the classical Farhi description (1) the profile in Fig. 6 is rather counter-intuitive. For instance, during hyperventilation acetone
supply from the bloodstream will stay roughly constant, while a drastic increase in
ventilation should enhance the dilution of alveolar air and would therefore be expected to (slightly) decrease the corresponding breath concentration.
From the above, we view exercise and hyperventilation scenarios as an interesting
control setting for testing the physiological adequacy of the newly developed model.
Moreover, these two scenarios provide a novel framework for contrasting the predictive power of distinct mechanistic frameworks put forward in the literature. Specifically, in the following we shall use the individual acetone behavior as depicted in
Fig. 6 as the basis for comparing the performance of Equations (14)–(17) with the
standard formulation due to Farhi as well as with the physiological compartment
model introduced by Mörk et al. [59], which can be viewed as the current state of the
art in acetone pharmacokinetic modeling. In particular, the latter model represents
a first improvement over the Farhi description in that it has been found capable of
adequately reproducing the bioaccumulation behavior presented in the previous subsection. Mörk et al. also discuss several shortcomings of earlier models proposed in
this context.
While the Farhi description is just a special case our model (by setting qbro = 0
and D → ∞, cf. Fig. 4), the model of Mörk et al. will be re-implemented in slightly

22

modified form by replacing the mass balance Equations (14)–(15) of the respiratory
tract with Equations (4)–(7) in [59]. The body compartments remain unchanged. Additional parameter values are taken from [59].
Letting CI ≡ 0 and Cbro (0) = 1.3 µ g/l, the initial compartment concentrations
for all three models as well as the endogenous production rate kpr can uniquely be
determined by solving the associated steady state equations at t0 = 0. This completely
specifies the models by Farhi and Mörk et al.. Contrarily, the response for the present
model is computed by solving the ordinary least squares problem

used for deriving an approximation of the time-varying stratified conductance parameter D ∈ [0, ∞) on m subintervals covering the time span [t0 = s0 ,tmax = sm ]. Here the
nodes s j are chosen to result in an equidistant partition of about 0.5 min, cf. Fig. 6,
third panel. For simulation purposes the measured physiological functions are converted to input function handles u by applying a local smoothing procedure to the associated data and interpolating the resulting profiles with splines. The aforementioned
optimization problem was solved as described in Section 4.2. Fig. 6 summarizes the
results of these calculations.
The visually good fit can formally be assessed by residual analysis. Plots of the
resulting residuals versus time and versus model predictions clearly exhibit random
patterns, suggesting that the assumptions of i.i.d., homoscedastic additive measurement errors underlying ordinary least squares methodology are reasonable [11]. Furthermore, no statistically significant autocorrelation among the residuals or crosscorrelation between the residuals and the measured inputs could be detected, indicating that the model has picked up the decisive dynamics underlying the data.

Fig. 6 Typical profile of end-exhaled acetone concentrations in response to the following physiological regime: rest (0-3 min), ergometer challenge at 75 W (3-12 min), rest (12-20 min), hyperventilation
with increased tidal volume (20-22 min), rest (22-25 min), high-frequency hyperventilation (25-28 min),
rest (28-30 min). Data correspond to one representative healthy male volunteer from the study cohort
in [42]. Measured or derived quantities according to the experimental setup are indicated in red, while
black tracings correspond to simulated variables. Panel 1: Measured acetone concentrations in end-tidal
breath and associated model predictions; Panel 2: Simulated compartment concentrations according to
Equations (14)–(17); Panel 3–5: Measured physiological parameters according to Table 1. The mucus:air
partition coefficient λmuc:air and the time-varying stratified conductance parameter D̂ are derived from
Equation (7) and (29), respectively.

While all three models will describe the steady state at rest, only Equations (14)–
(17) tolerably capture the entire observable dynamical behavior. Particularly, the predictions resulting from the models due to Farhi and Mörk et al. are almost indistin-

24

guishable within this experimental regime and both will depart only slightly from
the initial equilibrium states. In contrast, the newly proposed model indeed appears
to incorporate the decisive physiological mechanisms underlying the step-shaped dynamics of breath acetone concentrations in response to constant load exercise and
hyperventilation. Correspondingly, according to the second panel in Fig. 6, measured
(i.e., bronchial) levels during rest and tidal breathing markedly differ from the alveolar ones due to the effective diffusion barrier between the two spaces represented
by a value of Drest ≈ 0, cf. Section 4.2. As soon as tidal volume and/or respiratory
frequency are increased, this barrier will vanish to some extent according to the processes discussed in Section 3.2.2, thus causing Cbro = Cmeasured to approach a value
closer to the alveolar concentration CA . In contrast, CA itself as well as the breath acetone profiles simulated by means of the other two models remain relatively constant.
This is consistent with the behavior expected from the Farhi formulation, predicting
a minimal sensitivity of the alveolar concentrations with respect to fluctuations of the
ventilation-perfusion ratio for highly soluble trace gases. In other words, the major
part of short-term variability observable in breath acetone concentrations during free
breathing can be attributed to airway gas exchange, with minute changes in the underlying blood and tissue concentrations. In particular, note that with the present model
the observed acetone dynamics can be captured by assuming a constant endogenous
production rate kpr ≈ 0.17 mg/min. The above-mentioned reasoning appears to agree
with previous observations in the literature, where the excretion of acetone has been
demonstrated to increase during moderate exercise [75].
Remark 5 The high degree of interplay between D̂ and (V̇A ,VT ) discernible in the
third panel of Fig. 6 suggests that the time-dependency of D can essentially be captured using these two respiratory variables. Different heuristic relationships might be
investigated in this context, see Equation (23) for instance. Correspondingly, by repeating the optimization procedure in (28) with α being replaced by (kdiff,1 , kdiff,2 ) we
find that the associated model response again is in good agreement with the observed
data. The practical identifiability of these two parameters at their optimized values
kdiff,1 = 14.9 and kdiff,2 = 0.76 was confirmed along the lines of Remark 2. Hence,
the parameterization in Equation (23) might be used to reduce the originally infinite
dimensional estimation problem for D to two degrees of freedom.
While in Section 4.1 it has been confirmed that the model is structurally locally
observable, we stress the fact that data corresponding to exercise or hyperventilation tests as presented above will usually not allow for a joint numerical estimation
of some of the above variables. For perspective, it should be clear from the approximately constant profile of Cliv in Fig. 6 that kpr and kmet can hardly be assessed
simultaneously, as both values are coupled via a single steady state equation associated with Equation (16). Using similar reasoning, smaller values of qrest
bro (leading
to larger steady state concentrations CA (0)) can be compensated for by smaller constants kdiff, j , giving rise to an almost identical model output. Again, such a situation might formally be investigated by means of practical identifiability techniques
(cf. Appendix C), e.g., by calculating pairwise correlation coefficients between the
sensitivities of the model output with respect to the parameters under scrutiny. In
the present context, values of these indices associated with (kmet , kpr ) as well as

25
rest
(kdiff,1 , qrest
bro ) and (kdiff,2 , qbro ) are close to 1 or −1, thereby revealing a substantial
degree of collinearity between the corresponding sensitivities and providing strong
indications that a proper estimation of any of these pairs on the basis of moderate
exercise challenges as above cannot be anticipated. Such identifiability issues can
only be circumvented by designing (multi-)experimental regimes guaranteeing a sufficiently large and independent influence of all parameters to be estimated.

5 Discussion and critical remarks
The main intention of this section is to critically review and clarify some of the assumptions underlying the model derivation as well as to indicate some potential improvements of the present formulation.
Diffusion equilibrium in the bronchial tract. While it is commonly agreed upon that
the transport of inert gases between the alveolar space and end-capillary blood is
perfusion-limited [92], a similar premise in the case of airway gas exchange remains
less certain. Experimental and theoretical evidence appears to favor the view that
although a diffusion equilibrium might be attained at the air-mucus interface [89,
48], the bronchial epithelial tissue can constitute an effective diffusion barrier between the mucus lining and the bronchial circulation. The magnitude of this diffusional resistance is probably substance-specific, with an inverse relation to molecular
weight [85]. In this sense, the fractional bronchial blood flow qbro has to be interpreted as the effective perfusion of those mucosal tissue layers for which an instantaneous equilibrium with air can be achieved [47]. Specifically, qbro might differ for
distinct compounds. While animal models seem to support the assumption of a complete equilibration between air stream and bronchial circulation in the special case
of acetone [85], it might be necessary to include a diffusion limitation between these
two compartments in order to extend the validity of the model over a wider range
of highly water soluble VOCs. The statistical significance of such generalizations
can then be assessed by employing residual based comparison techniques for nested
models as described in [11,10]. However, at the current stage of research and given
the limited data on the behavior of breath trace gases having similar physico-chemical
characteristics like acetone, we prefer to maintain a parameterization as parsimonious
as possible.
Continuous ventilation and temperature dependence. Due to the tidal nature of breathing, bronchial as well as alveolar gas concentrations will vary throughout the breathing cycle, following a roughly periodical pattern during normal breathing. These variations can be captured by considering two separate mass balance systems, describing the dynamics of the associated concentrations for each inhalation and exhalation
phase, respectively [55,47,5]. While such microscopic formulations are of paramount
importance for resolving events within one individual respiratory cycle, when looking at the mid- to long-term behavior of breath VOCs we are rather interested in
the global dynamics of the averaged compartmental concentrations. This approach
leads to models of continuous ventilation with a unidirectional gas stream and has

26

the enormous operational advantage of reducing the model structure to one single
mass balance system.
Variable temperature distributions in the bronchial compartment are represented
by a single mean temperature T̄ according to Equation (5), thereby lumping together
our ignorance regarding the exact temperature profile along the airways. Different
functional relationships might be investigated here.
In summary, this paper introduces a novel compartmental description of pulmonary gas exchange and systemic distribution of blood-borne, highly blood and
water soluble VOCs, which faithfully captures experimentally determined end-tidal
acetone profiles for normal healthy subjects during free breathing in distinct physiological states. Particularly, the model has been tested in the framework of external
exposure as well as exercise scenarios and illuminates the discrepancies between observed and theoretically predicted blood-breath ratios of acetone during resting conditions, i.e., in steady state. In this sense, the present formulation provides a good compartmental perspective of acetone exhalation kinetics and is expected to contribute to
a better understanding of distribution, transport, biotransformation and excretion processes of acetone in different functional units of the organism as well as their impact
on the observed breath concentration.
While we are well aware of the fact that the number of data sets used for model
validation is relatively small, exposure and exercise regimes currently are the only
published experimental settings covering non-steady state acetone behavior in humans. Further validation will thus have to await additional experimental efforts. In
this context, preliminary tests conducted with the intention of extending the range of
applicability for the presented formulation to the framework of isothermal rebreathing show promising results [44].
The emphasis of this work has been laid on deriving a sound mathematical formulation flexible enough to cover a wide spectrum of possible VOC behavior, while
simultaneously maintaining physiological plausibility as well as a clear-cut interpretation of the involved parameters. Care has been taken to keep the parameterization as
parsimonious as possible, thereby constructing a novel “minimal” model respecting
fundamental physiological boundary conditions, such as boundedness of the associated trajectories and the existence of a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium
state. While a complete sensitivity and practical identifiability analysis was beyond
the scope of this paper and has to be matched to the particular experimental framework in which the model will be used, general concepts from structural and practical
identifiability have been exploited in order to provide some indications regarding the
information content of the observable breath level with respect to the endogenous
situation.

A Physical preliminaries
The following paragraphs briefly summarize the fundamental physical principles underlying the present
model derivation. Further discussion largely follows standard textbooks on thermodynamics and biological
mass transport, see [88] for instance.

A.1 Diffusion and Henry’s Law
Fick’s first law of diffusion states that the net flux J quantifying diffusional transport of a gas species M
between two spatially homogeneous control volumes (i.e., compartments in which M can be postulated to
behave uniformly) A and A′ is proportional to the associated difference in partial pressure PM , i.e.,
J = kdiff (PM,A − PM,A′ ),

(30)

where the non-negative diffusion constant kdiff has dimensions of amount (in mol) divided by pressure and
time. If the gas under scrutiny is in dissolved state rather than in gas phase, PM is referred to as gas tension,
defined as the partial pressure that would be exerted by the gas above the liquid if both were in equilibrium
(e.g., oxygen tension in blood). In the following we will omit the subscript M. Equation (30) can also be
expressed via a difference in concentrations. We will distinguish the following three cases:
(i). Firstly, if A as well as A′ represent a gaseous medium and M can be treated as an ideal gas (which
will be a general premise in the following) then – by the ideal gas law – its partial pressure P can be written
as
PA = CA RT,
(31)
and analogously for PA′ . Here, CA is the molecular concentration in A while R and T denote the gas constant
and absolute temperature, respectively. Hence,
J = kdiff (CA RT −CA′ RT ) = k̃diff (CA −CA′ ),

(32)

where k̃diff is defined by the above equation.
(ii). Similarly, if both A and A′ are liquids, we can make use of Henry’s law stating that the amount of
a gas M that can dissolve in a liquid under equilibrium conditions is directly proportional to the respective
tension, viz.,
C = HP.
(33)
Here the solute- and solvent-specific Henry constant H = H(T ) is inversely related to temperature. Substituting the last expression into Equation (30) yields
J = kdiff



CA CA′
−
HA HA′

.

(34)

(iii). Finally, let us assume that A′ represents a liquid, while A is a gas volume. The prototypic example
for this situation in the present context is the blood-gas interface separating the respiratory microvasculature and the alveoli. In this case by combining (31) and (33) we arrive at

(35)

In case of a diffusion equilibrium, i.e., J = 0, we deduce from Equation (34) that
H ′
CA′
= A =: λA′ :A ,
CA
HA

(36)

28
where the positive dimensionless quantity λA′ :A is the so-called partition coefficient between A′ and A (e.g.,
λblood:fat ). Analogously, its reciprocal value is denoted by λA:A′ . Similarly, from (35) the ratio between the
liquid phase concentration and gas phase concentration of M in equilibrium is given by
CA′
= HA′ RT.
CA

(37)

The expression HA′ RT is again denoted by λA′ :A (e.g., λblood:air ) and represents a measure of the solubility
of the gas M in the solvent A′ . Hence, λA′ :A allows for a classification of M as low or highly soluble with
respect to A′ .

A.2 Compartmental mass transport
As above, consider two homogeneous compartments A and A′ with volumes VA and VA′ , respectively. Gas
dynamics within these two compartments are governed by conservation of mass, stating that the rate at
which the compartmental amount (viz., VACA ) of M changes per time unit equals the rate of mass transfer
into the compartment less the rate of removal from the compartment. For instance, the process of diffusion
between A and A′ as discussed before can be seen as a special case of this scheme with J (expressed in
terms of concentrations) combining both diffusional inflow and outflow. Hence, if A and A′ interact by
diffusion and if both are affected by additional input rates I˙ and effluent output rates Ȯ (which might also
comprise possible sources or sinks, respectively), then, assuming that the respective compartment volumes
remain constant over time, the associated mass balances read
VA

dCA
= −J + I˙A − ȮA
dt

(38)

VA′

dCA′
= J + I˙A′ − ȮA′ ,
dt

(39)

and

respectively.
If diffusion is fast compared to the other dynamics influencing the system, CA as well as CA′ will
instantaneously approach their steady state values and a permanent diffusion equilibrium can be assumed
to hold between A and A′ . In this case we may replace CA′ in (39) with CA λA′ :A (cf. Equation (36)) and
deduce that the ODE system above simplifies to the one-dimensional differential equation
VA′ λA′ :A +VA

 dCA
= I˙A′ − ȮA′ + I˙A − ȮA .
dt

(40)

The factor ṼA := (VA′ λA′ :A +VA ) can be interpreted as “effective” volume of the combined compartment.
Equation (40) characterizes a perfusion-limited mass transfer between A and A′ . For perspective, there
is strong evidence that in normal healthy persons the alveolar exchange if inert gases is a perfusion-limited
process. The branching capillary network of the respiratory microvasculature will generally promote a fast
equilibration between end-capillary blood A′ and free gas phase A. This is likely to hold true even under
moderate exercise conditions [92]. From a modeling perspective, a commonly encountered error in this
context is to neglect the contribution of VA′ λA′ :A to the effective alveolar volume, as end-capillary blood
volume VA′ ≈ 0.15 l is argued to be much smaller than the normal lung volume VA ≈ 3 l. Note, however,
that this is only acceptable for low soluble inert gases with blood:air partition coefficient less than 1. Similarly, for most tissue groups, owing to their high degree of vascularization the intracellular space A can be
assumed to rapidly equilibrate with the extracellular space A′ (including the vascular blood and the interstitial space). In this case, a venous equilibrium is said to hold, i.e., the concentration CA′ of M in blood
leaving the tissue group is related to the actual tissue concentration CA via Equation (36).
Note that the assumption of well-mixing is central to compartmentalization, and can often only be
justified heuristically, either by examining factors that contribute to rapid distribution (e.g., convection) or
by considering small volumes. If heterogeneity within a compartment is expected to be substantial or the
main focus is on the spatial distribution of M, general mass transport equations leading to PDEs may be
employed [88].

29

B Some fundamental model properties
Equations (14)–(17) can be written as a time-varying linear inhomogeneous ODE system
ċ = A(u,p)c + b(u,p) =: g(u,c,p)

(41)

in the state variable c := (Cbro ,CA ,Cliv ,Ctis )T , which is dependent on a time-independent parameter vector
p as well as on a vector u := (V̇A , Q̇c ,VT , λmuc:air (Cwater ),CI ) of bounded, non-negative functions lumping
together all measured variables. The associated measurement equation reads
y = Cmeasured = (1,0,0,0) c =: h(c).

(42)

In the present section we are going to discuss some qualitative properties of the system presented. Firstly,
as the system is linear, for any given initial condition c(0) there is a unique global solution. Moreover, A
is a Metzler matrix and b ≥ 0. Consequently ci = 0 implies that ċi ≥ 0 for every component and it follows
that the trajectories remain non-negative. Thus, (41) constitutes a positive system with the state c evolving
within the positive orthant Rn>0 := {c |c ∈ Rn , ci > 0, i = 1,... ,n}, where n = 4.
Proposition 1 All solutions of (41) starting in Rn>0 remain bounded.
Proof This can be shown by considering the total mass m := ∑ Ṽi ci ≥ 0 and noting that
ṁ = kpr − kmet λb:livCliv + V̇A (CI −Cbro ).

(43)

Taking into account positivity of the solutions and the involved parameters this shows that Cliv is bounded
from above for bounded CI , since the assumption that Cliv is unbounded yields a contradiction. Analogously, Cbro and CA can be shown to be bounded by considering m̃ := ṼbroCbro + ṼACA + ṼtisCtis and
similarly for Ctis .
Furthermore, it can be proven that under physiological steady state conditions, i.e., for constant u, the
above system has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium ce := −A−1 b. To this end it suffices to show
that the time-invariant matrix A is Hurwitz, i.e., all real parts of the associated eigenvalues are negative.
Proposition 2 Suppose u is time-independent. Then the real parts of all eigenvalues of A(u,p) are nonpositive. They are strictly negative if det(A(u,p)) 6= 0.
Moreover, det(A(u,p)) = 0 if and only if either Q̇c vanishes or two of the quantities V̇A ,qliv ,kmet
vanish.
Proof For this it is sufficient to confirm that A is diagonally dominant, i.e., there exists a vector z > 0 such
that the row vector zT A is non-positive. This is a simple consequence of the fact that in such a case A can
be shown to be similar to a matrix Ã which has the claimed property. Indeed, if we define the diagonal
matrix U := diag(z1 ,... ,zn ) and set Ã := UAU −1 , it holds that
ã j j + ∑ |ãi j | = a j j + ∑
i6= j

i6= j

ai j zi
1
= (zT A) j ≤ 0
zj
zj

(44)

for all j since A is Metzler. Hence, the first claim will follow from Gershgorin’s circle theorem. The
required vector z follows from
(Ṽbro , ṼA , Ṽliv , Ṽtis )A = (−V̇A ,0,−kmet λb:liv ,0).
Moreover, the only case when the real part of an eigenvalue can vanish is when it lies on the boundary of
a circle touching the imaginary axis, that is, when an eigenvalue is zero. This proves the first part.
To show the second part one verifies that
det(A) = Q̇c (ϑ1V̇A + ϑ2 kmet )qliv Q̇c + ϑ3V̇A kmet
with ϑ j > 0.

(45)

30
This completes the minimal set of properties which necessarily should to be satisfied in any valid
model of concentration dynamics. In particular, global asymptotic stability for the autonomous system
ensures that – starting from arbitrary initial values – the compartmental concentrations will approach a
unique equilibrium state once the physiological inputs u affecting the system are fixed. Obviously, this
is of paramount importance when aiming at the description of processes exhibiting pronounced steady
states (which in the context of breath gas analysis corresponds, e.g., to the situation encountered during
rest or constant workload [42]) and is a prerequisite for orchestrating reproducible experiments. Hence,
in the context of VOC modeling, any approach not incorporating this property will lack a fundamental
characteristic of the observed data.
Remark 6 For perspective, we stress the fact that if the rate of metabolism in Equations (14)–(17) is
described by saturation rather than linear kinetics, i.e., if the term kmetCliv λb:liv in Equation (16) is replaced
by Equation (11), the system becomes essentially nonlinear. However, all conclusions drawn so far remain
generally valid. Firstly, by applying the Mean Value Theorem note that the Michaelis-Menten term above
is Lipschitz and so again a global Lipschitz property holds for the right-hand side of the resulting ODE
system. Positivity and boundedness of the solutions for arbitrary inputs u can be established in analogy
with the arguments in the last paragraphs. Effectively, in order to show boundedness from above, we first
note that Equation (43) now reads
ṁ = kpr −

vmaxCliv λb:liv
+ V̇A (CI −Cbro )
km +Cliv λb:liv

(46)

and as a result Cbro is unconditionally bounded if V̇A > 0. From Equation (14) it then follows that CA must
be bounded and subsequently Cv̄ (and hence Cliv as well as Ctis ) are bounded using Equation (15). In the
case V̇A = 0, the inequality
kpr ≤ vmax
(47)
is necessary and sufficient for boundedness. Necessity is easily deduced from the fact that kpr > vmax
implies ṁ > 0 and consequently m (i.e., at least one component ci ) is unbounded. Conversely, Equation (47)
ensures that Cliv is bounded and hence the same arguments as in the linear case apply.
In order to establish the existence of a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point for fixed u we
adopt a result on monotone systems taken from Leenheer et. al. [50], see also [34]. For monotone systems
in general with applications to biological systems we refer to [79, 8]. Firstly, note that the steady state
relation associated with Equation (16) now becomes
2
0 = Cliv
+ a1Cliv + a0

(48)

with a0 < 0. Thus, there exists a unique positive steady state solution for the liver concentration Cliv
and consequently the same can be confirmed to hold true for the other components of c as well. As a
consequence, it follows that the model has a unique equilibrium point in the non-negative orthant X :=
Rn≥0 . Moreover, note that for the right-hand side g of the underlying ODE system (cf. Equation (41)) it
holds that
∂ gi
≥ 0 for i 6= j, i, j ∈ {1,... ,n},
(49)
∂cj
i.e., the system is cooperative. This term stems from the fact that a given component is positively affected
by the remaining ones. For linear systems, an equivalent characterization is that the corresponding system
matrix A is Metzler. A well-known result on systems of this type asserts that the associated semiflow
Φ : R≥0 × Rn → Rn , (t,c0 ) 7→ Φt (c0 ) := c(t) is monotone with respect to the natural (componentwise)
partial order on Rn given by
c ≤ z if and only if ci ≤ zi , i ∈ {1,... ,n}.
That is, Φ preserves the order of the initial conditions (see [79], Prop. 3.1.1), i.e., for c0 , c̃0 ∈ Rn the
condition c0 ≤ c̃0 implies that Φt (c0 ) ≤ Φt (c̃0 ) for t ∈ [0,∞). As a third requirement, since all trajectories
are bounded and the system evolves within the closed state space X ⊂ Rn it follows that for every c ∈ X
the corresponding semi-orbit O(c) := {Φt (c), t ≥ 0} has compact closure. In summary, we are now in the
situation to apply Theorem 5 of [50], which asserts that the aforementioned properties are sufficient for
the unique equilibrium point in X to be globally attractive.

C A primer on local observability
For the convenience of the reader, the following section serves as a self-contained overview of the concept
of (local) observability for analytic, single-output state-space models of the form
ẋ = g(x,u),

x(0) = x0 ,

y = h(x,u).

(Σ )

Here it is assumed that x(t) evolves within an open set X ⊆ Rn , h : X → R is real analytic and g : X → Rn
is an analytic vector field. Furthermore, it is required that a unique solution exists, e.g., by assuming that g
is globally Lipschitz on X . Since g is assumed to be analytic, the solution will be analytic with respect to
both t and x0 . The output y = y(t,x0 ) is viewed as a function of the initial condition x0 . It will be analytic
as well.
We specialize to the case where the inputs are constant and hence can be interpreted as additional
known parameters of the system. In this case (Σ ) can be seen as a valid description for many biological
processes under constant measurement conditions, thus representing a sufficient framework for the type
of models and experiments considered here. Further exposition follows the treatment in [29, 63, 81] and [9].
Loosely spoken, local observability characterizes the fact that x0 can be instantaneously distinguished
from any of its neighbors by using the system response. This is made explicit in the following definition.
Definition 1 Let V ⊆ X . Two initial conditions x0 , x̃0 ∈ V are V -indistinguishable (x0 ∼V x̃0 ) if for every
T > 0 such that the corresponding trajectories remain in V it holds that
y(t,x0 ) = y(t, x̃0 )
for all t ∈ [0,T ]. A system (Σ ) is called locally observable at x0 ∈ X , if there exists a neighborhood
V ⊆ X of x0 such that for all points x̃0 in V the relation x0 ∼V x̃0 implies that x0 = x̃0 .
In other words, local observability characterizes the fact that x0 7→ y(.,x0 ) is injective for arbitrarily small
times T . For the sake of illustration, consider the system
  

ẋ1
−(x2 + x3 )x1
ẋ2  = 
 , y = x1 ,
0
(50)
ẋ3
0
then
y = x1,0 exp(−(x2,0 + x3,0 )t).
Evidently, this toy model is not locally observable as the slightly perturbed initial conditions x̃2,0 := x2,0 + ε
and x̃3,0 := x3,0 − ε result in exactly the same response y for any ε > 0. If we interpret x1 and x2 as constant
parameters, the above situation corresponds to a typical case of over-parameterization, i.e., adding x3 does
not provide a more detailed description of the observable output. On the other hand, from the reversed
viewpoint of estimation, this means that we will never be able to simultaneously estimate both x2,0 and
x3,0 from the available process data but can only assess their sum.
Remark 7 An equivalent characterization of this fact can be given in the context of sensitivities, i.e., by
considering the partial derivatives of the output with respect to the parameters. Indeed, we immediately
see that
∂y
∂y
=
,
∂ x2,0
∂ x3,0
i.e., the sensitivities are linearly dependent, which is well-known to preclude a joint estimation of both
parameters, see [18, 33]. Intuitively, the reason for this is that from the the Taylor expansion of first order
y(x̃2,0 , x̃3,0 ) ≈ y(x2,0 ,x3,0 ) +

∂y
∂y
ε−
ε = y(x2,0 ,x3,0 ),
∂ x2,0
∂ x3,0

which again confirms that any small change in x2,0 can be compensated for by an appropriate change
in x3,0 to yield almost the same output. A rigorous statement of this fact in the general unconstrained
case is given in [12]. In contrast, as will be illustrated henceforth, local observability guarantees linear
independence of the derivatives of y with respect to x0 . This is also a necessary requirement for the broad
class of numerical parameter estimation schemes based on the minimization of a given cost functional
using first-order information.

32
In more complex models, where an analytical expression for y can usually not be derived, we have
to resort to differential-geometric methods for investigating local observability. These tools will only be
developed to the extent necessary for stating the final observability criterion, but are usually defined in a
much more general framework than the one presented here.
For this purpose, first note that using the chain rule, the time derivative of the output equals the Lie derivative Lg h of the output function h with respect to the vector field g, i.e.,
ẏ = (∇h) · g =: Lg h
which again is analytic. Here, ∇ = ( ∂∂x ,... , ∂∂xn ) denotes the gradient and · denotes the scalar product in
1
Rn . Similarly, by iteratively defining
(k)

(k−1)

Lg h = Lg Lg

(0)

Lg h = h,

we immediately see that

∂k

(k)
y(t,x0 ) = Lg h(x0 ).
∂ tk
t=0
By our analyticity assumption on the system (Σ ), the system response y is analytic can hence be represented
by a convergent power (Lie) series around t = 0:
y(k) (x0 ) :=

∞

y(t,x0 ) =

∞

∑ k! y(k) (x0 ) = ∑ k! Lg

k=0

(k)

h(x0 ).

(51)

k=0

As a result, the relation x0 ∼V x̃0 is characterized by the fact that for all k ≥ 0 it holds that
(k)

(k)

Lg h(x0 ) = Lg h(x̃0 ).
This motivates the following two definitions. The linear space over R of all iterated Lie derivatives
(k)

O(x0 ) := spanR {Lg h(x0 ), k ≥ 0},
is called the observation space of the model. Moreover, ∇O := {∇H, H ∈ O} denotes the associated
observability co-distribution. The famous Hermann-Krener criterion [29] now states that the model is
locally observable at x0 if
dim∇O(x0 ) = n.
(52)
(k )

The sufficient condition (52) is equivalent to finding n indices k j such that the gradients ∇Lg j h(x0 )
are linearly independent. In fact, it turns out that only the first n iterated Lie derivatives have to be computed
in order to decide if such indices exist [9].
Summing up yields a simple algebraic rank criterion for local observability at a fixed point x0 , namely


(0)
(n−1)
rank J := rank ∇Lg h(x0 )T ,... ,∇Lg
h(x0 )T = n.
(53)
Example 1 Note that for a linear system
ẋ = Ax,
y = Cx
the above condition simplifies to


rank CT ,AT CT ,... ,A(n−1) T CT = n,
which is the well-known criterion introduced by Kalman (see, e.g., [81]). Obviously, if the linear model
is locally observable at one particular initial condition, local observability holds for every other initial
condition as well.

33
To conclude this section let us assume that g and h belong to the field of rational functions in x and
u = (u1 ,... ,uq ) over R, i.e., g,h ∈ R(x,u) with no real poles in X . Such rational models constitute an
acceptable simplification for most biological processes describing mass balance systems and including
standard kinetic mechanisms (e.g., Michaelis-Menten terms). Consequently, the entries of the matrix J
defined in (53) belong to R(x,u) and hence the rank of J(x,u) can be defined as the maximum size of
a submatrix whose determinant is a non-zero rational function. This so-called generic rank can easily be
determined by symbolic calculation software. Hence, if the generic rank of J is n, the rank over R of
J(x,u) evaluated at one specific point (x,u) ∈ Rn+q will also be n except for certain singular choices that
are algebraically dependent over R. As these special points constitute a set of measure zero, we may thus
claim that if the generic rank of J(x,u) equals n, almost every experiment corresponding to a choice of
constant input variables u will suffice to immediately distinguish a particular unknown initial condition x0
from its neighbors by giving rise to a unique process output y.
This powerful result is strengthened further by invoking the Universal Input Theorem for analytic
systems due to Sussmann [84], ensuring that if a pair of unknown initial conditions can be distinguished by
some (e.g., constant) input, it can also be distinguished by almost every input belonging to C ∞ ([0,T ]), T >
0 (see also [95] for a rigorous statement as well as a self-contained proof). Note that in the context of
physiological models this is the appropriate class of functions for capturing a wide range of applicable
physiological conditions.
Remark 8 The above line of argumentation remains valid for analytic g and h. However, the generic rank
in this case usually has to be estimated, e.g., by computing the rank of J evaluated at some randomly
assigned points (x,u) ∈ Rn+q .
While from the above an affirmative outcome of the rank test guarantees that every initial condition
within a neighborhood of the “true” value x0 will yield a unique output y when conducting a generic experiment with smooth inputs, the effective reconstruction of x0 from partially observed and error-corrupted
data remains a challenging problem. For instance, despite a positive result of the rank criterion, nothing can
be said about the degree of linear independence between the derivatives of the output with respect to the
initial conditions. In fact, the associated sensitivity matrix can still be rank-deficient in a numerical sense,
indicating an ill-conditioned problem. This is the context of practical identifiability or estimability [18, 32,
33], which will particularly depend on the specific experimental situation under scrutiny.
