Abstract

The antifungal effects of orthorhombic (~10 nm; spherical) and monoclinic (~50 nm;
tetrapod) sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) were studied against the NADPH-dependent
glutathione reductase (GR) mediated xenobiotic detoxification system (GSH-GSSG) in
filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger as a model organism). Both the SNPs induced
significant reduction in fungal growth and spore formation, and also introduced marked
deformities on the surface of conidiophores at their sub-inhibitory concentrations. A genome
wide transcriptome profile then revealed manifold reduction in the expression of GSH-GSSG
transcripts among SNPs treated fungal isolates, which is unusual for the micron sized
elemental sulfur but probably effective in terms of antifungal efficacy.

Introduction
The purifying and beneficial properties of Elemental Sulfur (ES) are being explored since
time immemorial (Mitchel 1996). It is interesting to note that while ES plays a crucial role in
protein synthesis at a basal quantity, a high concentration of ES is however, considered to be
toxic to microorganisms (Owens 1963). Nanosized dimension and suitable surface
modifications of ES further augments its antimicrobial efficacy. In our previous studies, the
antifungal properties of orthorhombic (α) and monoclinic (ß-) allotropes of sulfur
1

nanoparticles (SNPs) have already been discussed (Roy Choudhury et al. 2011; Roy
Choudhury et al. 2013a). Briefly, in the microbial cytosol both α- and ß-SNPs generate free
reactive thiols (-RSH), which induce ROS-stress, impairs a cluster of respiratory enzymes,
and/ or denatures certain proteins and lipids (Roy Choudhury et al. 2012). SNPs also enter
into the mitochondrial matrix and influence fungi to undertake the alternative glyoxylate
shunt in favor of energy conservation (Fig.1) (Roy Choudhury et al. 2013b).

Fig.1 A schematic cartoon depicts the comparative route of micronized elemental sulfur (ES;
S0), and sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) into the mitochondrial matrix of fungi. ES forms long
polysulfide chain upon entering into the microbial cytosol and readily removed as sulfides
(S2- /Sn-) by the NADPH-dependent glutathione (GR) mediated detoxification system in
fungi. In contrast, polymer coated SNPs surpass the GR system in fungi, disrupt
mitochondrial membranes, and inhibit cytochrome-c-oxidase (complex-IV) of the oxidative
phosphorylation.

In general, GSH synthetases (γGCS and GS), NADPH dependent GSH-regenerating
reductase (GR), glutathione transferase (GST) along with peroxide eliminating glutathione
peroxidase (GPX) and glutaredoxins (Grxs/Trx) are directly involved in the elimination
oxidative compounds in yeasts and other fungi (Costa and Moradas- Ferreira 2000; Moradas2

Ferreira and Costa 2001). However, no reports to the date are available essaying the effects of
SNPs against the GR mediated antioxidant system in fungi. Herein, we report a non-targeted
cDNA microarray based genome-wide transcription analysis to determine the oxidative
effects of SNPs against the NADPH dependent GR-mediated detoxification system in
Aspergillus niger. The disturbing effects of SNPs against the fungal growth, morphology, and
sporulation (Fig.2) were then correlated to the alteration in transcript expression of the GSH
metabolism components. A simultaneous study was also undertaken to determine the effect
of SNPs treatment on the GR enzymatic activity.

Material and Methods
Preparation and characterization of sulfur nanoparticles
Polyethylene Glycol encapsulated (PEGylated) α-SNPs were prepared via liquid phase
precipitation method (Roy Choudhury et al. 2011). Span-80 (sorbitan monooleate)-Tween-80
(polyethylene glycol-sorbitan monooleate) encapsulated β-SNPs were prepared via water-inoil microemulsion technique (Roy Choudhury et al. 2013a). SNPs were characterized for
their physicochemical properties as described in our previous studies (Roy Choudhury et al.
2013a; Roy Choudhury et al 2013b). High resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (2010F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was carried out at 200 kV on a carbon-coated
copper grid to confirm the actual size of SNPs. Stock concentration of the prepared
nanocolloids was evaluated as per our previously published method (Kumar et al. 2011).

Fungal strains and growth conditions
The wild strain of A. niger was isolated from rotten potato tubers, obtained from the
commercial sources in Kolkata, India. Tubers with visible lesions of black moulds were then
disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 minutes, followed by thorough
washing with Millipore water (Sartorius Stedium biotech, arium 611VF and arium 61316
systems, Aubgene, France). The mycelium of the isolated fungal strains were placed in 5 ml
of water and subjected to vortex (Genei Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, India). The content was then
poured into petridishes containing saboraud dextrose agar (SDA; Himedia laboratories Pvt.
Ltd., Mumbai, India) for rapid and viable fungal growth. The petri-dishes were incubated at a
temperature of 28°C for 48 hrs. The germinated conidia were then transferred to new petri3

dishes containing SDA and subcultured regularly at an interval of 10 days. Simultaneously,
the conidia were transferred into 10 % sterile glycerol and stored at - 80 °C for long term use.
Species specific studies with partial gene sequences of ITS / 5.8 rRNA (NCBI accession
number HQ293217) and β-tubulin (NCBI accession number HQ293218) were done prior to
their deposition in Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC); India (accession number
10180). MTCC-282 and MTCC-2196 strains were obtained from, MTCC, IMTECH-CSIR,
Chandigarh, Govt. of India.

The Antifungal assays with SNPs
The antifungal effects of SNPs were determined in terms of reduction in the radial growth of
fungi using a modified agar dilution method (ADM). The microbial strains were grown in
potato dextrose agar (PDA) and treated with serially diluted (two fold) concentrations of
SNPs (Roy Choudhury et al. 2013b) to determine minimal-inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
and sub-inhibitory concentrations (SICs). Inhibitory effects of SNPs on sporulation of the
fungi were determined with a slide bioassay (Resende et al. 1996; Roy Choudhury et al.
2011) Deformities at the surfaces of treated fungal hyphae were visualized with Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) [JEOL JSM-600F, Tokyo, Japan] at 5.0
kV vacuum under x 2500 magnification.

Microarray analysis for the GR transcripts
Expression of the crucial transcripts of GSH metabolism and TRX/GRX pathway were
studied with microarray analyses in triplicate. Total mRNA (with RNeasy minikit, Qiagen,
CA, USA) from the untreated, ES and SNPs-treated (at their sub-inhibitory concentrations) of
strain MTCC-10180 was extracted to determine the induction/ repression level. Gene
expression of the purified mRNAs were determined on an 8 X 15 K array slide (AMADID:
033147, Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA) using one color microarray based gene
expression analysis kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA). Individual gene hybridization
intensities were normalized to balance their uniform expression using GeneSpring GX-11.5
software (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA). Fold induction or repression in gene
expression was calculated in a log2 scale. A negative or positive log2 value indicated a
reduced or induced transcript level, respectively. Spurious or anomalous results, which had
been flagged by the ScanAlyze (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm) program, were
4

deleted from the data set. Gene ontology, molecular functions, and tracing of specific genetic

Measurement of enzyme activity of GR
Fungal strains were incubated with SNPs supplemented media containing (IAA) iodoacetic
acid. IAA significantly deplete the GSH content of cells (Schmidt and Dringen 2009), and
hence impair the GR-mediated antioxidant efficacy. The SICs to IAA were fixed depending
upon the tolerance limit of microbes to IAA. Changes in intracellular GR-enzyme activity
was then measured from the SNP treated isolate of A. niger (MTCC-10180), both in presence
and absence of IAA. GR activity was measured following the originally proposed method
(Carlberg et al. 1985). Briefly, Around 0.2 gm of liquid nitrogen frozen mycelial mass
(scraped from PDA plates) was extracted in the extraction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH: 7.8), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2% TritonX-100, 1mM PMSF, and 2 mM DTT. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min at 4 ºC. The supernatant (enzyme sample) was then
mixed with 25 mM Na-PO4 buffer, pH 7.8, 5mM GSSG and 1.2 mM NADPH.Na4 assay
solutions. For 3 ml of total reaction volume, 25 mM Na-PO4 buffer, 5 mM GSSG, 1.2 mM
NADPH.Na4, sample were added in a ratio of 7:1:1:1. The oxidation of NADPH by GR was
estimated from the decreased absorbance at 390 nm, recorded continuously for 180 seconds.
The GR activity was calculated as Unit/mg protein/min per sample, using the following
formula:
C0 (original concentration) =

Absorbance x dilution factor/
ε (extinction coefficient of NADPH 6.2 mM-1cm-1 at 390 nm)

Results and discussion
Physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of SNPs
Both the SNPs were prepared in colloidal form. TEM micrographs revealed that α-SNPs were
nearly spherical in shape with an average particle size (APS) of ~10 nm (Fig.2A). β-SNPs
looked like tetrapod with APS of ~50 nm (Fig.2B). MIC of α- and β-SNPs was evaluated to
be 8000 ppm and 32000 ppm respectively. ADM showed gradual reduction in the radial
5

growth of fungi along the increasing concentration gradient of SNPs (Fig.3; a-c) (Roy
Choudhury et al. 2011).

(APS~50 nm; tetrapod)

At higher doses, SNPs also found to obliterate the rate of sporulation (Fig.3; g-i) and
introduce significant deformities to the surface of conidiophores (Fig.3; d-f) (Roy Choudhury
et al. 2013b). In contrast, ES failed to exert any marked antifungal effects.

Alteration in the GR-transcript expression
SNPs mediated antifungal phenotypes were extrapolated to their interfering effects of the
fungal antioxidant system. Filamentous fungi are equipped to use distinct antioxidant
enzymes of the GSH-GSSG pathway to reduce the load of various form sulfur toxicity. For
example, NADPH dependent GR readily converts ES to soluble polysulfide, and makes their
penetration difficult against microbial membranes (Sato et al. 2011). A lesser fraction of
micronized ES, if succeeds to enter the microbial cytosol to generate toxic H2S; GSH
transporter γ-L-glutamyl-cysteine synthase (GCS) promptly acts to scavenge it from the cell.
Some of the sulfurous xenobiotics have potential to react either spontaneously with the –SH
group of GSH or to form GSH S-conjugates (GS-X), which then become susceptible to
nucleophilic attack by GSH on the electrophilic sulfur by the aid of glutathione Streansferases (GSTs) (Pócsi et al. 2004). Transcriptome data of the present study revealed
that ES treatment differentially induced expression of the GSH-GSSG detoxification
transcripts, as expected (Fig.4).

components after treatment with micronized elemental sulfur, α- and ß-SNPs.

In particular, the highest fold of induction (11.02) was observed for GR, which also suggests
the occurrence of proactive NADPH mediated GR system in the tested A. niger strain. GCS
and Glutathione synthetase of the GSH-GSSG pathway were also reasonably elevated.
Noteworthy, a substantial elevation (8.312) in GST expression was also noticed after ES
treatment, which indicates that ES may provoke the fungal antioxidant system in more than
one way. In contrast, transcript expression for each of the GSH-GSSG components was
repressed manifold followed by the α-SNPs treatment. For ß-SNPs, though the GCS and
glutathione synthetase increased over 2 fold, GR and GST expressions were found to be
repressed. It’s worth mentioning that GPx expression level was not changed after ES/SNPs
treatment, which may correlated to its non-responsiveness to the sulfur induced stress.
Moreover, components of TRX/GRX were found to remain compromised/ not detected after
ES treatment, however repressed differentially with SNPs treatment (Table-1).

The disparity in transcript expression followed by ES and SNPs suggest their completely
different mode of penetration, and effect against the fungal antioxidant mechanism. In our
previous studies we observed that SNPs can introduce various degrees of rupture in the
mitochondrial membranes and impair Cytochrome-C-oxidase of oxidative phosphorylation
(Roy Choudhury et al. 2013b).

Alteration in the GR-enzyme activity
GR-enzyme activity was found to be altered marginally with the increasing concentration
gradient of α- and β-SNPs., but elevated at the SICs of SNPs (Fig.5).

standard deviations were calculated from three independent rounds of experiment.
(Reproduced from Roy Choudhury et al. 2013b)

However, no GR activity was recorded in presence of IAA, and hence, the MICs of both αand β-SNPs dropped down significantly (Roy Choudhury et al. 2013b).

Discussion
The present study additionally suggests that diminutive size (nano) and polymer stabilized
surface of SNPs may camouflage their presence and facilitate their entry to the mitochondrial
matrix by surpassing the proactive GSH-GSSG mediated detoxification systems of fungi.
Moreover, the antifungal assay used here employs ADM, where the fungus has unavoidable
access of ES and SNPs along the course of its development. Hence, even an abrupt increase
in GR enzyme activity was observed at the SICs of SNPs; this post-translational elevation in
GR activity turns out to be inefficient for SNPs-detoxification. In conclusion, for the first
9

time we have explored the interaction of SNPs against the GR mediated detoxification system
in fungi at transcriptome level. Nano-size and novel mode of action of SNPs make them
suitable as next generation antifungal agent when ES fails, and fungi will probably take
longer to find ways to resist them.
