SUMMARY
Some sulphate-reducing and microaerophilic bacteria rely on the enzyme
superoxide reductase (SOR) to eliminate the toxic superoxide anion radical (O2•−). SOR
catalyses the one-electron reduction of O2•− to hydrogen peroxide at a non-heme ferrous
iron center. The structures of Desulfoarculus baarsii SOR (mutant E47A) alone and in
complex with ferrocyanide were solved to 1.15 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. The
latter structure, the first ever reported of a complex between ferrocyanide and a protein,
reveals that this organo-metallic compound entirely plugs the SOR active site,
coordinating the active iron through a bent cyano bridge. The subtle structural
differences between the mixed-valence and the fully-reduced SOR-ferrocyanide adducts
were investigated by taking advantage of the photo-electrons induced by X-rays. The
results reveal that photo-reduction from Fe(III) to Fe(II) of the iron center, a very rapid
process under a powerful synchrotron beam, induces an expansion of the SOR active
site.

INTRODUCTION
The superoxide anion radical O2•−, the univalent reduction product of molecular
oxygen, is highly toxic for living organisms (Imlay, 2003). For years, the only
enzymatic system known to catalyze elimination of superoxide was superoxide
dismutase (SOD) (Fridovich, 1995). Recently, a new mechanism of cellular defense
against oxidative stress was discovered, involving the non-heme iron protein superoxide
reductase (SOR). SOR catalyzes the one-electron reduction of O2•− to hydrogen
peroxide at a nearly diffusion-controlled rate (Jenney et al., 1999, Lombard et al.,
2000a, Niviere et al., 2004b):
O2•− + 2H+ + SOR(Fe2+) Æ H2O2 + SOR(Fe3+)
In contrast to SOD, SOR does not catalyze oxygen production, and up to now it has
been only found in some anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria or archae (Niviere et al.,
2004b). In these organisms, it has been shown to play a fundamental role in case of
oxidative stress provoked by exposure to adventitious molecular oxygen (Emerson et
al., 2003b, Fournier et al., 2003, Pianzzola et al., 1996). Understanding the catalytic
mechanism engineered by SOR is of fundamental interest, and is also needed because
the enzyme is potentially a target of considerable pharmacological relevance, for
example in the case of the pathogenic bacterium Treponema pallidum, responsible for
syphilis (Fraser et al., 1998).
The three-dimensional structures of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Pyrococcus
furiosus SORs have revealed a catalytic domain formed by a seven stranded β-sandwich
displaying an immunoglobulin-like fold (Coelho et al., 1997, Yeh et al., 2000).
Catalysis occurs at a ferrous iron center (named Center II) (Lombard et al., 2000a)
adopting a square pyramidal coordination to four histidines in equatorial positions and a
cysteine in axial position. The sixth coordination site, where O2•− is thought to bind,
-4-

Adam et al, Revised version

remains vacant in the reduced state and is occupied by a strictly conserved glutamate in
the oxidized state (Berthomieu et al., 2002, Clay et al., 2002, Yeh et al., 2000). Three
classes of SORs have been described so far, all of which display a highly similar active
site. D. desulfuricans, Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfoarculus baarsii SORs are
representatives of class I, in which the catalytic domain is linked to a small N-terminal
domain structurally similar to desulforedoxin (Archer et al., 1995) and containing an
additional iron center, named Center I (Coelho et al., 1997). The mononuclear iron(III)
of Center I is ligated by four cysteines in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement, of
rubredoxin-type. SORs of class II, as P. furiosus SOR, are characterized by the absence
of the additional N-terminal domain (Yeh et al., 2000). In class III, this domain is
present, but center I is absent, such as in T. pallidum SOR (Jovanovic et al., 2000,
Lombard et al., 2000b). In fact, when present, a functional role of Center I has not been
established (Emerson et al., 2003a, Lombard et al., 2000a).
To date, the formation of SOR complexes with ligands or substrate analogs has
been investigated by various spectroscopic techniques, but a structural characterization
of these species at the atomic level has been missing. Formation of SOR adducts with
azide, cyanide and nitric oxide have been studied (Clay et al., 2002, Clay et al., 2003a)
and were found consistent with an inner-sphere catalytic mechanism involving the
formation of iron(III)-(hydro)peroxo intermediate species (Abreu et al., 2001, Emerson
et al., 2002, Lombard et al., 2001, Mathe et al., 2002, Niviere et al., 2004a, SilaghiDumitrescu et al., 2003). The formation of a stable cyano-bridged dinuclear iron cluster
following oxidation of SOR with hexacyanoferrate(III) (also referred to as ferricyanide
or Fe(III)(CN)6) was first detected by EPR studies (Clay et al., 2002) and was
subsequently investigated by FTIR, ESI mass spectrometry and near-IR variabletemperature magnetic circular dichroism (Auchere et al., 2003, Clay et al., 2003b).
Analysis of FTIR stretching bands suggested the existence of a Fe(III)-NC-Fe(II)(CN)5
complex with the bridging cyanide adopting a bent geometry (Auchere et al., 2003).

Here, we have solved the three-dimensional (3D) structures of D. baarsii SOR
E47A mutant, alone and in complex with hexacyanoferrate(II) (also referred to as
ferrocyanide or Fe(II)(CN)6), to 1.15 and 1.7 Å resolution, respectively. The E47A
mutant was initially chosen because of its ability to stabilize a (hydro)peroxo
intermediate (Mathe et al., 2002), opening future possibilities to form such an entity in
the crystal. Although the release of H2O2 may be assisted by the ligation of Glu 47 to
the oxidized active iron (Mathe et al., 2002, Niviere et al., 2004a, Yeh et al., 2000), it
has been shown that the mutation of this residue to alanine has no effect on the rate of
the reaction of SOR with superoxide (Abreu et al., 2001, Emerson et al., 2002, Lombard
et al., 2001, Niviere et al., 2004a), suggesting no significant alteration of the 3D
structure of SOR.
The structures of the mixed-valence and fully reduced complexes (SORFe(III)Fe(II)(CN)6 and SORFe(II)-Fe(II)(CN)6, respectively) are the first ever reported of a
protein bound to ferrocyanide. Both structures were obtained from a single crystal by
taking advantage of the photo-electrons induced by the X-ray beam (Berglund et al.,
2002). Photo-reduction of the crystalline enzyme was monitored online by absorption
microspectrophotometry and the associated subtle structural changes could be observed.
Our data bear interest for the understanding of the SOR catalytic mechanism and
the rational design of drugs targeting the enzyme. They show that substrate binding to
SOR involves a significant electrostatic component, reveal a new type of cyano-bridged
dinuclear iron cluster, and suggest a subtle volume expansion of the SOR active site
upon reduction.

RESULTS
Structure of D. baarsii SOR (E47A mutant, 1.15 Å resolution)
D. baarsii SOR (Table 1, Figure 1) E47A is a homodimer whose overall fold
closely resembles the structure of D. desulfuricans SOR (rmsd on backbone atoms is
0.55 Å, to be compared with 0.20 Å between the two monomers of the D. baarsii
enzyme). Both monomers (referred to as monomers A and B, respectively) are
composed of the two iron-containing domains typical of Class I SORs. Data collection
statistics and refinement parameters are shown in Table 1.
In the reduced state, the E47A mutation is unlikely to induce any significant
reorganization of the active center as compared to the wild-type enzyme. This is
indicated by the observed superposition of this center in our structure, onto the wildtype D. desulfuricans structure (rmsd’s on backbone and side-chain atoms less than 8 Å
away from the active iron are 0.31 Å and 1.21 Å, respectively; 17 residues are
concerned, displaying 82 % sequence identity and 100 % similarity between the two
structures). Hence, the high resolution of our data provides a highly precise
representation of the active site geometry (Table 2). The active iron is found 0.5 Å out
of the equatorial plane formed by the four histidine ligands, in the direction of Cys116.
Interestingly a strong electron density feature is observed in the putative substrate
binding cavity (6.0 σ in the initial Fo-Fc difference electron density computed before
modeling), at a distance of 4.2 Å from the iron (Figure 2). A similar density was noticed
in the case of D. desulfuricans SOR, 4.9 Å from the iron, but was not assigned,
probably because of the lower resolution (Coelho et al., 1997). We attribute this density
to a chloride ion on the basis of (i) the absence of residual Fo-Fc difference electron
density when this ion is included in the model, (ii) the value of the B-factor refined for
chloride (19.6 Å2), which is similar to those of neighboring atoms (15.7 Å2 on average
for residues less than 5 Å away from the anion) and (iii) the fact that 0.1 M calcium
-7-

Adam et al, Revised version

chloride was present in the crystallization medium. The chloride ion remains partially
solvated by four water molecules situated at a mean distance of ~ 3.1 Å, two of which
are hydrogen bonded to the protein. In particular, Wat113 is strongly bound to Lys48, at
a distance of 2.8 Å from atom Nζ, correlating with the essential role of this strictly
conserved residue which sticks out of the protein surface and serves as the primary
attractor for the anionic superoxide substrate (Lombard et al., 2001).
The SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex: single crystal microspectrophotometry and
monitoring of X-ray induced photoreduction.
Oxidation of SOR by potassium ferricyanide has been suggested to produce a
stable ferrocyanide adduct with the enzyme active site (Auchere et al., 2003, Clay et al.,
2002). As this adduct is expected to display a 6-coordinated active center iron, possibly
analogous to the octahedral geometry adopted upon substrate binding, we set out to cocrystallize the D. baarsii enzyme with ferricyanide. Single-crystal
microspectrophotometry (Bourgeois et al., 2002) revealed that Fe(III)(CN)6 oxidizes the
active center iron as assessed by the appearance of a new band at ~ 650 nm in the
absorption spectrum (Figure 3a). The absence of a band at ~ 420 nm after washing the
crystal suggests that ferricyanide has been reduced to ferrocyanide. In addition, the
absorbance bands from Center I (in the 400-570 nm region) are weaker than in the
absence of Fe(III)(CN)6, suggesting a partial depletion in the iron content of this center
caused by the treatment with ferricyanide. Such a depletion is not expected to be of
functional importance, as an engineered D. vulgaris SOR lacking Center I has been
shown to retain full catalytic activity (Emerson et al., 2003a).
Exposure for 90 s under the X-ray beam of ESRF station ID14-EH4 resulted in
the complete disappearance of all absorption bands assigned to the oxidized states of
both iron Centers I and II (Figure 3b). We assign this observation to X-ray induced
photo-reduction (Chance et al., 1980, Karlsson et al., 2000). As a result, the exact
-8-

Adam et al, Revised version

valence state of the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex in a X-ray structure could not be established
unambiguously in the absence of a tight control of the X-ray dose delivered to the
crystal.
Online microspectrophotometry (Ravelli et al., unpublished results, see also Sakai
et al., 2002) was used to quantitatively evaluate the reduction of SOR crystals by X-ray
induced photo-electrons. Time-resolved difference absorption spectra showed a rapid
decay of the absorption band at 650 nm (Figure 4a, a movie is available as
Supplementary Material) upon exposure to a (0.1 x 0.1) mm2 X-ray beam at 0.92 Å
delivering ~ 5x1011 photons s-1. Assuming that this decay accurately describes the
photo-reduction kinetics of Center II, more than 25% of the active center irons are
reduced by the X-ray beam in about 3 seconds, long before any radiation damage
becomes apparent on diffraction patterns.
A special data collection strategy was therefore required to solve the structure of
the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex in well-defined redox states. Using the recent method of
Berglund et al. (Berglund et al., 2002) we collected two “composite” data sets from a
single rod-shaped crystal. In the first composite data set (referred to as the “LD” data
set), a low X-ray dose was deposited into the sample, whereas in the second one
(referred to as the “HD” data set), a higher dose was deposited. From the LD and HD
data sets, models of the D. baarsii SOR in complex with ferrocyanide could be refined
to 1.7 Å resolution, that correspond to the oxidized and reduced states of the active
center iron, respectively. Furthermore, the subtle structural changes induced by photoreduction of this center could be observed with minimum systematic errors.

Structures of the mixed-valence and reduced SOR-ferrocyanide complexes (E47A
mutant, 1.7 Å resolution).
The structure of the mixed-valence SORFe(III)-Fe(II)(CN)6 complex reveals that
ferrocyanide entirely plugs the enzyme active site and shows an octahedral geometry of
the active center iron (Figure 5). One apical cyanide bridges the two irons (distance N1,
Fer-Fe(III)SOR

≈ 2.36 Å), whereas the other sticks out of the protein. Coordination of

Fe(CN)6 to the SOR iron occurs with a bent geometry (Table 2), due to asymmetric
anchoring of the equatorial cyanides on the SOR active site (Figure 5d). Indeed,
ferrocyanide is interacting with Ala45 and Lys48, with hydrogen bonds between N5 and
N2 of Fe(CN)6 to O of Ala45 and Nζ of Lys48, respectively, and van der Waals
interactions between N3 of Fe(CN)6 and Cβ of Ala45 and Cδ of Lys48. As a result of the
bent geometry (angle Fe(II)-N1-Fe(III)SOR ≈ 142°), ferrocyanide establishes van der
Waals contacts with His119 and His75 through the fourth cyanide group nitrogen.
Binding of Fe(CN)6 also results in pulling the active center iron back into the equatorial
plane (distance Fe – equatorial plane ≈ 0.15 Å), resulting in the Sγ, Cys116–Fe
coordination bond being stretched by ~ 0.3 Å (Table 2). The distances between the
active iron and the equatorial histidines are not significantly modified.
The presence of ferricyanide in the crystallization medium did not induce
noticeable structural changes of SOR other than at the active site. However, a depletion
of the iron content in Center I is observed (refined occupancy for the iron ≈ 40%),
confirming the predictions made from microspectrophotometry. As a consequence,
Cys13 and Cys30 as well as Cys10 and Cys29 form disulfide bridges.
The structure of the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex in the fully reduced state shows small
but significant differences from that of the mixed-valence complex. X-ray induced
photo-reduction of Center II at 100 K induced structural modifications of the active iron
coordination pattern, as revealed by computation of electron density difference maps
- 10 -

Adam et al, Revised version

(Figure 6a). These modifications are almost identical in both monomers. First, an
outward motion of ferrocyanide is observed, suggesting that the dinuclear iron cluster
formed by the active center iron and Fe(CN)6 elongates upon reduction. Second, a
positive feature appears at the level of the active center iron which is not compensated
by any negative feature. This observation suggests the absence of a net motion of the
iron upon reduction, and is consistent with either a reduced thermal agitation, or, more
likely, with an increased net partial negative charge. Third, a positive density, again not
compensated by any negative feature, is observed behind Sγ of Cys116, suggesting a
stretching of the Sγ-Fe coordination bond and either a reduced thermal agitation or an
increased net partial negative charge of the cysteinyl sulfur atom. It should be noted that
the observed features in Figure 6a are very unlikely to result from Fourier truncation
errors around a heavy atom, as no overwhelming density is observed in the difference
electron density map.
At the level of Center I, the disulfide bridges formed upon iron depletion in the
SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex clearly break up upon photo-reduction (Figure 6b). This
observation is expected from previous studies on the radiation sensitivity of disulfide
bridges (Alphey et al., 2003, Weik et al., 2000), and corroborates the development of
absorption below 450 nm observed by online microspectrophotometry (Weik et al.,
2002). In the present case, it provides us with an internal control of the quality of the
composite data sets.
Model refinement of the mixed-valence and fully reduced structures confirmed
these qualitative observations. Upon reduction, the FeSOR-Sγ, C116 and the FeSOR-N1, Fer
bonding distances elongate by ~ 0.06 Å and ~ 0.07 Å, respectively. Additionally, some
of the equatorial histidines move away from the active iron. His119, the most solventexposed equatorial ligand, is displaced by ~ 0.05 Å, whereas His49, the most buried

- 11 -

Adam et al, Revised version

one, shows no movement. However, the significance of these latter motions is not
supported by the presence of peaks above noise level in the Fourier difference map.
Overall, the octahedral volume formed by the atoms coordinating the active center
iron expands by ~ 4.9 % upon reduction (Table 2).
Catalytic activity of D. baarsii SOR in the presence of ferrocyanide.
The structures of the SOR-ferrocyanide complex suggest that ferrocyanide, by
plugging the active site, could act as a potent inhibitor of the SOR activity. The effect of
ferrocyanide on SOR activity was investigated in solution. The kinetics of the oxidation
of Center II by O2•−, generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system was followed
by spectrophotometry at 640 nm. As shown in Figure 7, below about 2 molar
equivalents of ferrocyanide with respect to SOR, the velocity of SOR oxidation by
superoxide decreases dramatically with increasing amount of ferrocyanide present in the
assay. However, above 2-5 equivalents of ferrocyanide, the velocity of SOR oxidation
becomes almost ferrocyanide-independent, with a value of about 20% of that in the
absence of ferrocyanide. Identical results are obtained in the cases of the wild-type SOR
and the E47A mutant (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
The X-ray crystallographic structures of superoxide reductases from D.
desulfuricans (Coelho et al., 1997) and P. furiosus (Yeh et al., 2000) have revealed a
highly unusual non-heme iron active site, adopting a square pyramidal geometry and
being particularly well exposed to the solvent. In this work, we have demonstrated that
the unique properties of the SOR active site confer to the enzyme the ability to form a
tight complex with ferrocyanide. The structure of this complex is the first ever reported
- 12 -

Adam et al, Revised version

of a protein bound to this organo-metallic compound, and reveals a new type of cyanobridged dinuclear iron cluster.
Spectroscopic studies have previously suggested that oxidation of SOR by
ferricyanide produces a stable ferrocyanide adduct with the iron active site (Auchere et
al., 2003, Clay et al., 2002). FTIR analysis following oxidation of D. vulgaris and T.
pallidum SOR by ferricyanide have showed a characteristic C-N stretching band at 2095
cm-1 suggestive of a cyano-bridged dinuclear iron cluster adopting a bent geometry
(Auchere et al., 2003). Such a geometry is clearly observed here: ferrocyanide interacts
with two of the liganding histidines, His75 and His 119, through van der Waals
contacts, whereas the side chains from Ala45 and Lys48 prevent it from contacting the
two other histidines (Figure 5b).
The remarkable plugging of ferrocyanide results from electrostatic
complementarity between Fe(CN)6 and the SOR active site (Figure 5a, b), but also from
steric complementarity. Crevices at the enzyme surface accommodate the equatorial
cyanide moieties of Fe(CN)6 (Figure 5a, b). Moreover, the fourfold symmetry of these
equatorial cyanides matches the spatial distribution of the four equatorial histidines of
Center II, resulting in an interleaved stacking that enhances the stabilization of the
complex (Figure 5c).
The above-mentioned interactions between SOR and Fe(CN)6 are compatible with
the establishment of a coordination bond between the active center iron and the nitrogen
atom of the bridging cyanide. However, the protein environment constrains the distance
between these two atoms (2.36 Å in the mixed-valence state) to be greater than the one
measured on the chemically and structurally related organo-metallic compound Prussian
Blue (2.03 Å, (Buser et al., 1977)).

Inspection of our structures of reduced SOR with a chloride ion and of the SORFe(CN)6 complexes indicate that substrate binding to SOR involves a significant
electrostatic component involving Lys48. It has been observed that a SOR mutant where
this residue is replaced by isoleucine leads to a ~30 fold decrease in the kinetics of
binding of superoxide to the enzyme (Lombard et al., 2001). Our structures show that
Lys48 sticks out of the protein surface and interacts with either Fe(CN)6 or chloride in
the absence of Fe(CN)6, supporting the view that its physiological role consists in
grabbing anionic substrate molecules to funnel them towards the active site (Lombard et
al., 2001).
Binding of chloride to an iron center is an unusual finding, which has only been
reported in the case of T. zostericola myohemerythrin, in which the anion directly
coordinates a diiron center (Martins et al., 1997). Direct coordination does not occur in
SOR, as chloride remains trapped to the protein’s surface through four water molecules
of its hydration shell. A practical image would be the one of a parachutist suspended to
a tree by his parachute, unable to touch the ground. Given the geometry of the active
site, direct coordination to the iron would require almost complete desolvation of
chloride, which would be of too high free-energy cost. Hence, our structure illustrates
the energy balance between electrostatic interaction and ion desolvation. Interestingly,
the binding mode of chloride strikingly matches the one of ferrocyanide (Figure 5d and
e). Each of the four water molecules “corresponds” to an equatorial cyanide group, and
establishes the very same interactions with neighboring atoms from the protein. This
supports the idea that anions exhibiting affinity for SOR interact in a common manner
with the active site. Besides, as the SOR-ferrocyanide adduct displays a 6-coordinated
active center iron, it would be tempting to propose that the structure of the complex
mimics the octahedral geometry adopted upon substrate binding, with superoxide
occupying a similar position as the bridging cyanide. However, such a conclusion may
only be drawn with the greatest care.

Cyanide has been mentioned to be a weak inhibitor of SOR activity (reduction of
the enzymatic activity by a factor of 7 when 50 equivalents of CN- are added), (personal
communication from M. K. Johnson and M. W. W. Adams reported in Shearer et al.,
PNAS, 2003). With ferrocyanide, only two equivalents are sufficient to reduce the
enzymatic activity by a factor of 5 (Figure 7). This suggests that the SOR-Fe(CN)6
complex is tightly formed in solution. In addition, since the wild-type SOR behaves
exactly as the E47A mutant, it appears that Glu47 does not interfere with binding of
ferrocyanide. These findings are consistent with the striking electrostatic and steric
complementarity between Fe(CN)6 and the SOR active site (Figure 5), which are likely
to largely increase the binding affinity of Fe(CN)6 relative to CN-. On the other hand,
because ferrocyanide entirely plugs the SOR active site and prevents superoxide to
approach the active iron, it was expected to act as a more efficient inhibitor of the
enzyme. The remaining SOR activity with superoxide which is observed in the presence
of an excess of Fe(CN)6 appears then rather surprising. This activity might be associated
with an alternative O2•− reduction mechanism involving the still redox active
ferrocyanide. Nevertheless, the structure and the stability of the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex
constitute a basis of how drugs specific to SOR could be designed. Others hexacyanate
complexes, with metals expected to be redox inert in biological media, might exibit a
similar binding capacity to the SOR active site, without any residual activity.
Alternative hexacyanate complexes formed with Ru, Co and Pt could for example be
considered.
During data collection, the redox state of the crystalline SOR-ferrocyanide
complex could be monitored online by time-resolved absorption
microspectrophotometry. Photo-reduction of the active center iron by a highly brilliant
synchrotron X-ray beam was shown to occur within a few seconds. Photo-reduction of
metal centers in crystalline enzymes has been reported in several cases (Berglund et al.,
2002, Chance et al., 1980, Karlsson et al., 2000, Logan et al., 1996, Schlichting et al.,
- 15 -

Adam et al, Revised version

2000, Sjogren et al., 2001) but a quantitative evaluation of the rate of the process was
not carried out to date. The rate observed in the case of SOR is surprisingly rapid, but is
consistent with X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies on the P. furiosus enzyme
having shown that the active site of SOR is highly susceptible to photoreduction by Xrays (Clay et al., 2002). This susceptibility probably relates to the accessibility of the
solvent to the active center iron.
Elegant ideas have recently been proposed to turn radiation damage into an ally
(Berglund et al., 2002, Ravelli et al., 2003). Here, we took advantage of X-ray induced
photo-electrons to study the structural changes associated with the reduction of the
active center iron in the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex. Comparison of the mixed-valence and
fully reduced structures shows a volume expansion (~ 4.9 %) of the active site upon
reduction at 100 K (Table 2). Such an expansion is expected, as the electrostatic
interactions between the net positive charge carried by the active iron and the six lone
electron pairs provided by the ligands decrease upon reduction. However, a direct
experimental evidence, as presented here, was never provided.
The main contributors to the expansion are the axial ligands of the active iron,
with a backward motion of ferrocyanide and a stretching of the Fe-Sγ, Cys116 bonding
distance by more than 0.06 Å. Cys116 appears as the most flexible ligand of the active
iron. Tuning of the SOR active site to accommodate Fe(CN)6 involves a lengthening of
the Fe-Sγ, Cys116 distance (increasing by 12 % relative to the apo structure, Table 2),
suggesting a weakening of the Fe-Sγ bond upon Fe(CN)6 complexation, and in
agreement with recent resonance Raman studies showing a downshift of the Fe-Sγ
stretching modes in the complex (C. Mathé, et al., submitted). Upon reduction, a further
stretching by 2.3 % is observed. These observations are in line with the proposal that the
Fe-Sγ pπ-dπ bonding interaction actively contributes to the active-site reactivity and
may play a role in electron transfer (Clay et al., 2002). Furthermore, the positive feature,
- 16 -

Adam et al, Revised version

without any negative counterpart, observed at the level of Cys116 Sγ in the electron
difference density map of Figure 6a may reveal an increased partial negative charge on
the cysteinyl sulfur atom. Such an interpretation would be in agreement with DFT
studies on different Fe-S clusters having predicted that the net charge increase upon
reduction is largely distributed to the sulphur atoms (Noodleman et al., 1992). DFT
studies have been performed on SOR (Silaghi-Dumitrescu et al., 2003) and the
technique could in principle be used to confirm this idea.
All displacements that lead to the overall expansion of the active site upon
reduction are smaller than the estimated absolute coordinate errors of the structures (~
0.15 Å). However, a “calculated” map of type (Fc, reduced – Fc, mixed-valence) exp(iφc, mixedvalence)

essentially reproduces the features observed in Figure 6a and corroborates the

consistency of our models (Figure S1, available as Supplementary Material).
Considering the data collection strategy and the refinement protocol employed to obtain
our final models, systematic errors are expected to be identical in the two structures.
Therefore, errors in coordinate shifts between these structures are much smaller than the
absolute coordinate error of each of them, giving significance to the subtle expansion
observed. In addition, the motions of the axial ligands are real because they are clearly
observed in experimental difference maps. This is not the case for the equatorial
histidines, but in-plane translation of an imidazole ring results in a weak change of the
electron density (Figure S1). Nevertheless, although the individual motions of the
histidines are consistent with the steric constrains experienced by these residues, their
significance remains questionable at this stage. In summary, photoreduction seems to
induce an average backward motion of the equatorial ligands, in response to a decrease
in their electrostatic interaction with the active iron.
Overall, a re-organization of the active center molecular orbitals upon a oneelectron charge increase has been visualized. As the experiment was performed at cryo- 17 -

Adam et al, Revised version

temperature (100 K), below the dynamical transition (Parak et al., 1982), only small
motions could be observed, and it may not be excluded that reduction at room
temperature could induce more drastic conformational changes. However, the
observations made here are of general interest for the study of redox-dependent
structural changes of metal centers in proteins.

CONCLUSION
The ability to selectively reduce the highly toxic superoxide anion confers unique
structural properties to superoxide reductase. Our results show that SOR is designed to
bind negatively charged molecules such as O2•−. Moreover, the ability of the enzyme to
make a complex with the organo-metallic compound hexacyanoferrate(II) is a
remarkable feature. Indeed, despite the numerous protocols in which this molecule is
used to oxidize metalloenzymes, the 3-dimensional structure of a cyano-bridged
dinuclear metal center involving Fe(CN)6 and a metalloenzyme has never been reported.
In D. baarsii SOR, ferrocyanide is observed to coordinate axially the catalytic iron
through a cyanide bridge adopting a bent geometry, and to completely block access to
the SOR binding site. Therefore, it constitutes a model for rational drug design targeting
the enzyme. The observation of a global expansion of the coordination pattern of the
active center iron upon photo-reduction is of general interest for the study of redoxdependant structural changes in metalloenzymes. Lengthening of the iron sulphur
bonding interaction and possible charge transfer to the sulphur atom upon reduction
suggest that this interaction actively contributes to the reactivity of the SOR active-site.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Purification and crystallization of SOR
Wild type and E47A D. baarsii SORs were over-expressed in E. coli DH5α
strains and purified as described (Lombard et al., 2001). For crystallization assays, an
additional hydrophobic chromatography column (phenyl Superose, Pharmacia) was
carried out after the anion exchange chromatography step.
E47A SOR crystals in the semi-reduced form were obtained using the hanging
drop method by mixing 2µL of a crystallization solution (18% PEG 4000, 100 mM Tris
buffer, pH 8.0 and 100 mM CaCl2), with 2µL of a protein solution (1 mM SOR in 10
mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5). Needle-shaped, red-colored crystals of size ~ (0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1)
mm3 grew in about two weeks at 20°C, in the tetragonal space group I4122 with cell
dimensions a = b = 123.61 Å, c = 73.02 Å, α = β = γ = 90º. The asymmetric unit
comprises the SOR homodimer and the crystals contain 38% solvent forming large
channels (~ 30 Å diameter). However, accessibility to the active site in both monomers
is restricted, which probably explains why soaking experiments with
hexacyanoferrate(III) failed.
Crystals of the complex between SOR and hexacyanoferrate(II) were obtained
with the same crystallization solution to which 4 mM K3Fe(III)(CN)6 was added. Cocrystallization induced a change to an orthorhombic space group. Needle shaped,
brown-colored crystals of size ~ (0.6-1 x 0.15 x 0.15) mm3 grew in about one month at
20°C in the P212121 space group with cell dimensions a = 42.13 Å, b = 67.65 Å, c =
82.19 Å, α = β = γ = 90º. The crystals contain 36% solvent.
For X-ray data collection and microspectrophotometry experiments, crystals
were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution (5 µL of the crystallization solution to

- 19 -

Adam et al, Revised version

which 20% glycerol is added) for ~1 min prior to being flash cooled to 100 K in
gaseous nitrogen with a nylon loop.
Offline absorption microspectrophotometry.
Absorption spectra on SOR crystals were collected using a Deuterium lamp
(Oriel 63163) and an offline microspectrophotometer (Bourgeois et al., 2002). To check
the effect of X-ray induced photoreduction, crystals were transferred with cryo-tongs
and absorption spectra were collected before and after X-ray data collection on the same
crystal (Figure 3).
Online absorption microspectrophotometry.
Absorption spectra on SOR crystals were collected online using a device recently
installed on station ID14-EH4 at the ESRF (Ravelli et al., in preparation). A 1 mm long,
rod-shaped crystal was mounted at 100K and submitted to a (0.1 x 0.1) mm2 X-ray
beam at 0.92 Å delivering ~ 5x1011 photons s-1. The part of the crystal volume exposed
to X-rays was probed by a 25 µm diameter beam from a Xenon light source. Difference
absorption spectra (from an initial spectrum recorded before exposure to X-rays) were
collected upon X-ray irradiation at a frequency of ~ 10 Hz. The decay of the absorption
band at ~ 650 nm (Figure 4b) displays a bi-exponential behaviour, with half-times of 6.5
sand 72 sec. Other features of interest were observed in addition to the rapid decay of
the ~ 650 nm band. The fastest process was the appearance of a broad absorption band
centered at ~ 540 nm, tentatively assigned to the presence of trapped hydrated electrons
within the sample (Ershov et al., 1968). A major absorption increase was also observed
below 450 nm that corroborates bleaching of the crystal observed visually (Figure 4,
inset), and that can be attributed to reduction of disulfide bridges within the sample.

Data collection and structure solution
Data collections were performed on beamlines BM30A, ID29, ID14-EH2 and
ID14-EH4 of the ESRF, Grenoble, France. The structure of reduced E47A SOR was
solved by molecular replacement using the structure of D. desulfuricans (accession
code: 1DFX) to which all hetero atoms were removed, as a starting model. Model
refinement was initially performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) to 1.5 Å resolution,
and then extended to 1.15 Å with Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997). Individual atomic
thermal parameters were refined anisotropically. Dual conformations were modeled for
some residues or atoms, where necessary. No restraints were applied on the metal ions.
A final round of conjugate gradient minimization was carried out with Shelx (Sheldrick,
1997 ) and a ultimate full-matrix least square refinement without restraints yielded
estimated standard deviations on all individual atomic positions (Table 2).
To solve the structure of the SOR-Fe(CN)6 complex, an initial model was
derived by positioning the E47A SOR structure (with hetero atoms removed) into the
new unit cell by rigid body refinement, and by placing manually ferrocyanide molecules
into the electron density using O (Jones et al., 1991). Ferrocyanide was built as a perfect
octahedron with bond lengths obtained by averaging those from 5 structures of the
compound found in the Cambridge Structure Database (Entries CEJYEV, GIJVEA,
IDOZAX, QEZXUO and VUYBAS). The stereochemistry of ferrocyanide was strongly
restrained, using the highest energy constants encountered for amino-acid residues.
During refinement with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998), the structure of ferrocyanide
remained very close from ideality, and the absence of noticeable peaks in the difference
map justified a posteriori the choice of strong restraints. Only reflections common to
both the LD and HD data sets were retained. Additionally, 89 of these reflections were
- 21 -

Adam et al, Revised version

rejected on the ground that the difference between their intensities in each data set was
aberrant (Ursby et al., 1997). Once a model had been obtained for the mixed-valence
state, this structure was refined against the HD data set with 200 cycles of positional and
100 cycles of individual B-factor refinement.
Composite data sets.
The technique of composite data sets (Berglund et al., 2002) was used to
reconstruct a “low dose” (LD) and a “high dose” (HD) data sets (Figure 4b), which,
based on spectroscopic results, can be confidently assigned to the oxidized and reduced
states of the active center iron. The LD data set corresponded to a total exposure of 7
sunder a 17-times attenuated beam (first arrow on Figure 4b), whereas the HD data set
corresponded to a total exposure of ~ 70 sunder the un-attenuated beam (second arrow
on Figure 4b). LD and HD data sets were obtained from 12 pairs of subsets of 7 images,
collected at different locations of the crystal, translating the latter by 100 µm and
rotating it by 6º between subsequent subsets so as to scan the reciprocal space entirely.
Statistics for the composite data sets are shown in Table 1. The resolution was limited to
1.7 Å due to the need for a reduced exposure for the LD data set, but the crystal could
diffract to higher resolution. The absorbed dose for the LD data set was very small (8.7
103 Gy, i.e. 0.05 % of the Henderson limit, (Henderson, 1990) and it was still limited
for the HD data set (1.5 106 Gy, i.e. 7.8 % of the Henderson limit), in which no
detectable degradation of the diffractions patterns could be noticed. Based on an
estimation of the crystal content, the approximate number of photons absorbed per unit
cell was evaluated with the program Raddose (Murray et al., 2004) to be 0.001 and 0.2
for the LD and HD data sets, respectively. Assuming that a single absorbed X-ray
photon may generate a cascade of up to ~ 500 e-, ~ 0.5 e- and ~ 100 e- may eventually
be guided to electron sinks such as metal centers in the LD and HD cases, respectively.
Therefore, with ~ 16 iron atoms per unit cell (omitting the depleted center I), these
- 22 -

Adam et al, Revised version

findings are fully consistent with negligible and almost full photo-reduction of the
active center iron in the LD and HD data sets, respectively.
Steady-State Measurement of the Oxidation of SOR by O2•− in the presence of
ferrocyanide
The kinetics of the oxidation of SOR by O2•−, generated by the xanthine-xanthine
oxidase system, was followed by spectrophotometry (Lombard et al., 2000a) in the
absence or in the presence of various molar equivalents of potassium
hexacyanoferrate(II) (Sigma). Assays were performed at 25°C in 1 ml of reaction buffer
(50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6) containing 17 µM of SOR, 400 µM xanthine, 500 U catalase.
The reaction was initiated by adding 0.09 U of xanthine oxidase. SOR oxidation was
followed at 640 nm, and the kinetics was found to be linear for at least 5 min.

Figure 1. Three-dimensional structure of D. baarsii SOR. The color changes
from blue to cyan (respectively from yellow to red) from the N-terminal to the Cterminal ends of monomer A (respectively monomer B). Iron atoms are represented as
dark-green spheres, with residues coordinating them shown as gray sticks. His49,
His69, His75, His119 and Cys116 coordinate the Center II iron(II), whereas Cys10,
Cys13, Cys29 and Cys30 coordinate the Centre I iron(III). Domains I and II are linked
by a loop (residues 37-45) and a short 310 helix (46-49). A calcium ion, depicted in pink,
is found at the interface between the two monomers, with hexa-coordination to Cys88
and Thr90 from both monomers, and to two water molecules located near the symmetry
axis. Prepared with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, USA).

Center II iron and chloride are represented as dark-green and lime-green spheres,
respectively. Iron coordination is figured by purple dotted lines. The chloride anion only
binds tightly in monomer A, where Lys48 is highly ordered. In monomer B, a
crystalline contact partially disorders Lys48, thus disrupting the water network at this
location, and leading to alternate positions for the chloride ion, as suggested by an
elongated electron density (not shown). Figures 2, 5b, 5c, 6 and 7 were prepared with
