We investigate the intergenerational shape dynamics of single Caulobacter crescentus cells using
a novel combination of imaging techniques and theoretical modeling. We determine the dynamics of cell pole-to-pole lengths, cross-sectional widths, and medial curvatures from high accuracy
measurements of cell contours. Moreover, these shape parameters are determined for over 250 cells
across approximately 10000 total generations, which affords high statistical precision. Our data and
model show that constriction is initiated early in the cell cycle and that its dynamics are controlled
by the time scale of exponential longitudinal growth. Based on our extensive and detailed growth
and contour data, we develop a minimal mechanical model that quantitatively accounts for the cell
shape dynamics and suggests that the asymmetric location of the division plane reflects the distinct
mechanical properties of the stalked and swarmer poles. Furthermore, we find that the asymmetry
in the division plane location is inherited from the previous generation. We interpret these results
in terms of the current molecular understanding of shape, growth, and division of C. crescentus.

Cell shape both reflects [1] and regulates [2] biological
function. The importance of cell shape is exemplified by
bacteria, which rely on specific localization of structural
proteins for spatiotemporal organization [3]. Bacteria
take forms resembling spheres, spirals, rods, and crescents. These shapes are defined by cell walls [4] consisting of networks of glycan strands cross-linked by peptide
chains to form a thin peptidoglycan meshwork [5]. Superresolution imaging is now revealing the internal positions
of associated proteins [9]. These include cytoskeletal proteins such as MreB, a homolog of actin [7–10], intermediate filament-like bundles of CreS (crescentin) [11, 12],
and FtsZ, a homolog of tubulin [13]. However, due to
the inherently stochastic nature of molecular processes,
understanding how these proteins act collectively to exert mechanical stresses and modulate the effects of turgor
pressure and other environmental factors requires complementary methods such as high-throughput, quantitative optical imaging.
Multigenerational imaging data for bacterial cells can
now be obtained from microfluidic devices of various designs [14–18]. Still, a common limitation of most devices
is that the environmental conditions change throughout
the course of the experiment, particularly as geometric
growth of the population results in crowding of the experimental imaging spaces. We previously addressed this
issue by engineering a C. crescentus strain in which cell
adhesion is switched on and off by a small molecule (and
inducible promoter) [19], allowing measurements to be
made in a simple microfluidic device [19–22]. This technology allows imaging >100 generations of growth of an
identical set of 250–500 single cells distributed over ∼25
fields of view. Thus cell density is low and remains constant. These studies afforded sufficient statistical precision to show that single C. crescentus cells grow exponen-

tially in size and divide upon reaching a critical multiple
(≈1.8) of their initial sizes [19]. Satisfaction of a series of
scaling laws predicted by a simple stochastic model for
exponential growth indicates that these dynamics can be
characterized by a single time scale [19, 23].
In this paper, we use more advanced image analysis
methods to extract cell shape contours from these data.
The resulting geometric parameters, together with mathematical models, provide insights into growth and division in C. crescentus and the plausible role of cell wall
mechanics and dynamics in these processes. Specifically,
we identify natural variables for tracking cell dynamics,
and develop a minimal mechanical model that shows how
longitudinal growth can arise from an isotropic pressure.
We then examine the dynamics of cell constriction and
unexpectedly find that it is governed by the same time
constant as exponential growth. This important finding can be understood in terms of an intuitive geometric
model that relates the constriction dynamics to the kinetics of the growth of septal cell wall. We further suggest
that the site of constriction can arise from differences in
materials properties of the poles and show that it is established in the previous generation—i.e., the location of
the site of division can be predicted before formation of
the divisome. We relate our results to the known dynamics of contributing molecular factors and existing models
for bacterial growth and division.

RESULTS

The length is sufficient to characterize the exponential growth of each cell. Various techniques have
been put forth to analyze cell morphology gathered from
single cell images [24]. Recent work on image analysis

of one field of view. The solution flow in the microfluidic channel is from bottom to top. (b) Zoomed image of the yellow
highlighted cell from a and its splined contour. (c) Schematic of a contour illustrating the shape parameters. The cell medial
axis is calculated from pole to pole; it defines both cell length l(φ) and radius of curvature R(φ), which lead directly to the
spanning angle θ(φ). The cell width w(φ, u) is a parametric quantity, calculated as the length of the rib perpendicular to the
medial axis at a specified distance from the stalked pole, u(φ). The location of the global minimum of the width wmin (φ)
(purple line) can be used to segment the cell into stalked (st, red) and swarmer (sw, blue) portions.

of single cells has attempted to optimize two problems:
separation of distinct (but potentially overlapping) cells
and accurate determination of the edge of each cell [25].
Because crowding is not an issue in our setup, we could
focus solely on constructing an algorithm to delineate
each cell contour accurately and precisely. As shown in
Fig. 1a,b and described in the Methods section, we first
segment each cell using pixel-based edge detection similar to [26], then perform spline interpolation to determine
the cell contour at sub-pixel resolution. The sequence of
such images for each single cell constitutes a trajectory in
time t that serves as the basis for quantitative analysis.
Division events are then detected in an automated fashion using custom Python code, and used to divide time
trajectories for each cell into individual generations.
All data shown here were obtained by observing 260
single C. crescentus cells perfused in complex medium
(peptone-yeast extract; PYE) at 31◦ C over the course
of 2 days (corresponding to 9672 separate generations).
Under these conditions, the mean population growth rate
and division time remain constant, so we treat the trajectories of individual generations as members of a single
ensemble. In other words, we segment each cell trajectory by generation and take the resulting initial frame
(i.e., immediately following division) as t = 0 minutes.
In order to average over the ensemble, we then bin quantitative information according to time since division, t,
normalized by the respective division time τ . The normalized time, φ ≡ t/τ , serves as a cell-cycle phase variable.
For our quantitative analysis, we focus on a set of three
intuitive and independent parameters that characterize
cell shape at each stage of growth: length l, width w,

and radius of curvature R (Fig. 1c). They are calculated
directly from each splined contour as follows (see also
Supplementary Fig. 1):
• We define the length, l(φ), as the pole-to-pole distance along the contour of the cell medial axis at
the normalized time φ (Fig. 2a).
• We assign a single radius of curvature, R(φ), to
each cell based upon the best-fit circle to the medial axis (Fig. 2b). Although stalked (Rst (φ)) and
swarmer (Rsw (φ)) portions may be described by
different radii of curvature toward the end of the
cell cycle, the average radius obtained by averaging
the contributions of each portion yields the same
value, i.e., h(Rst (φ) + Rsw (φ))/2i ' hR(φ)i (see
Supplementary Fig. 2c).
• We define the width, w(φ, u) as the length of the
perpendicular segment spanning from one side of
the cell contour to the other at each position u(φ)
along the medial axis, which runs from u = 0 at
the stalked pole to u = l at the swarmer pole.
Furthermore, we spatially averaged the width over
positions along the medial axis, w̄(φ), to obtain a
characteristic width at each time point (Fig. 2c).
The mean division time is hτ i = 73 ± 7 min, where h...i
indicates a population average. We find that hl(φ)i increases exponentially with time constant hκi−1 = 125 ± 8
min, essentially the same time constant that we previously observed for the cross-sectional area [19], while
hw̄(φ)i and hR(φ)i remain approximately constant for
0 < φ < 0.5 and each shows a dip for 0.5 < φ < 0.9

3
when cell constriction becomes prominent. The sharp
rise in hR(φ)i seen for φ > 0.9 results from independent
alignment of the stalked and swarmer portions with the
microfluidic flow as they become able to move independently (i.e., fluctuate easily about the plane of constriction). These observations confirm the assumptions in
[19] that the length is sufficient to describe the growth
of cell size. Moreover, we can track the dynamics of the
spanning angle, θ, using the relation l = Rθ.
Mechanical model for cell shape and growth.
There are many details of cell growth and shape that
require interpretation. For example, it is not obvious
a priori that growth should be almost exclusively longitudinal. Therefore, we have developed a minimal mechanical model that can explain these observations. We
parametrize the geometry of the cell wall by a collection
of shape variables {qi (t)}, where q1 = hRi, q2 = hw̄i, and
q3 = hθi are the parameters introduced above (Fig. 1c).
As the cell grows in overall size, we postulate that the rate
of growth in the shape parameter qi (t) is proportional to
the net decrease in cell wall energy, E({qi (t)}), per unit
change in qi (t) [27, 28]. Assuming linear response, the
i
configurational rate of strain, qi1(t) dq
dt , is proportional to
the corresponding driving force Fi = −∂E/∂qi , in analogy with the constitutive law of Newtonian flow [29]:

depends on the local surface curvatures through the energy terms Ewidth and Ecres , that describe harmonic wells
around preferred values of surface curvatures.
The mechanical energy for maintaining width is given
by
Ewidth

(1)

where the constant Φi describes the rate of irreversible
flow corresponding to the variable qi (t). According to
equation (1), exponential growth occurs if Fi is constant,
whereas qi (t) reaches a steady-state value if Fi (qi ) = 0
along with the condition ∂Fi /∂qi < 0. It thus remains to
specify the form of E.
For a C. crescentus cell of total volume V and surface
area A, our model for the total energy in the cell wall is
given by
Z
E(R, w̄, θ) = −P V + dA γ +Ewidth +Ecres +Ediv , (2)
where P is a constant pressure driving cell wall expansion; γ is the tension on the surface of the cell wall; Ewidth
is the energy required to maintain the cell width; Ecres
represents the mechanical energy required to maintain
the crescent cell shape; Ediv is the energy driving cell wall
constriction. Traditionally P was taken to be the turgor
pressure [27]; while the importance of the turgor pressure
has recently been questioned [30], an effective pressure
must still arise from the synthesis and insertion of peptidoglycan strands that constitute the cell wall. We note
that a purely elastic description of cell wall mechanics
would lead to a curvature-dependent surface tension [31].
However, if growth is similar to plastic deformation, the
tension is uniform [5]. The effective tension in our model

where the constant Rm is the preferred radius of curvature, km is the bending rigidity and dA is a differential area element [33]. Contributions to km can come
from the peptidoglycan cell wall as well as membraneassociated cytoskeletal proteins like MreB, MreC, RodZ,
etc., which are known to control cell width [7–9].
In addition to maintaining a constant average width,
C. crescentus cells exhibit a characteristic crescent shape,
which relies on expression of the intermediate filamentlike protein crescentin [11]. Although the mechanism by
which crescentin acts is not known, various models have
been proposed, including modulation of elongation rates
across the cell wall [12, 34] and bundling with a preferred
curvature [35]. We assume the latter and write the energy
for maintaining the crescent shape as

where u is the arc-length parameter along the crescentin
bundle attached to the cell wall, c(u) is the local curvature, Rc is the preferred radius of curvature, lc is the contour length, and kc is the linear bending rigidity. Equation (S.22) accounts for the compressive stresses generated by the crescentin bundle on one side of the cell wall,
leading to a reduced rate of cell growth, according to
equation (1). As a result, the cell wall grows differentially and maintains a non-zero curvature of the centerline. In the absence of crescentin (kc = 0), our model
predicts an exponential decay in the cell curvature that
leads to a straight morphology, consistent with previous
observations [11].
Finally, one must also account for the energy driving
cell wall constriction. Constriction proceeds via insertion of new peptidoglycan material at the constriction
site. This process leads to the formation of daughter
pole caps [36]. We take constriction to be governed by
an energy of the form Ediv = −λS, where S is the surface
area of the septal cell wall, and λ is the energy per unit
area released during peptidoglycan insertion.
There exists an optimal cell geometry for a
given mechanical energy. To apply the model introduced above (equations (1) and (2)) to interpreting
the data in Fig. 2, we assume a minimal cell geometry given by a toroidal segment with uniform radius of
curvature R(φ), uniform cross-sectional width w̄(φ) and
the spanning angle θ(φ). To this end, we estimate as

FIG. 2. Dynamics of cell shape parameters. (a) Length of the cell medial axis (data shown in black and exponential fit
from our mechanical model in red). (b) Radius of curvature of the cell medial axis, obtained by calculating the best-fit circle
to the entire cell (black points), with a time-averaged mean hRi = 4.44 ± 2.12 µm (0 < φ < 0.5). The mean-field model predicts
a constant steady-state value for hR(φ)i (red solid line), whereas by accounting for constriction dynamics, the model captures
the dip in hR(φ)i seen for 0.5 < φ < 0.9 (blue solid line). (c) Characteristic cell width, obtained by spatially averaging the
width at each time point (black points), with a time-averaged mean hw̄i = 0.74 ± 0.02 µm (0 < φ < 0.5). The mean field model
predicts a constant steady-state value for hw̄(φ)i (red solid line), whereas cell constriction accounts for the dip in hw̄(φ)i seen
for φ > 0.5 (blue solid line). The shaded regions represent ±1 standard deviation. Model parameters: P = 0.3 MPa, γ = 50
nN/µm, kc = 2 nNµm2 , Rc = 0.5 µm, km = 40 nNµm, Rm = 0.31 µm, τ = 73 min.

many mechanical parameters as we can from the literature and then determine the rest by fitting our experimentally measured values. Turgor pressure in Gramnegative bacteria has been measured to be in the range
0.03 − 0.5 MPa [37–39]. We use a value for the effective internal pressure close to the higher end of the measured values for turgor pressure, P = 0.3 MPa, in order to account for peptidoglycan insertion. We estimate
the surface tension as γ = 50 nN/µm (see Supplementary model section) and multiply it by the cell surface
area A(φ) = π w̄Rθ to obtain the cell wall surface energy.
First, we neglect cell constriction (setting Ediv = 0) and
assume that the crescentin structure spans the length of
the cell wall (excluding the endcaps) [40], with a contour
length lc (φ) = (R − w̄/2)θ. The mechanical properties
of MreB and crescentin are likely similar to those of Factin and intermediate filaments, respectively [11, 12].
However, due to a lack of direct measurements, we obtain the mechanical parameters km and kc by fitting the
model to the experimental data.
As desired, we find that the total energy E has a stable absolute minimum at particular values of the crosssection diameter w̄ and the centerline radius R, given by
solution of ∂E/∂ w̄ = ∂E/∂R = 0 (see Supplementary
Fig. 4). The measured values are hw̄i = 0.74 ± 0.02 µm
and hRi = 4.44±2.12 µm (0 < φ < 0.5), and, as indicated
by the red solid curves in Fig. 2b,c, the model reproduces
them with km = 40 nNµm and kc = 2 nNµm2 . While
the fitted value for kc is numerically close to the estimate
based on the known mechanical properties of intermediate filaments (∼ 1.5 nNµm2 ), the value for km is much
higher than the bending rigidity of MreB bundles (see
Supplementary Information). This indicates that km is
only determined in part by MreB and can have contributions from the cell wall.
Given stable values for w̄ and R, growth is completely

described by the dynamics of the angle variable θ(φ).
Consequently, we write the total energy in the scaling
form E(w̄, R, θ(φ)) = θ(φ)U (w̄, R), with U the energy
density along the longitudinal direction. The condition
for growth then becomes U < 0, such that the energy
is minimized for increasing values of θ(φ). From our experimental data, the angle spanned by the cell centerline
increases by an amount ∆θ ' 0.49 during the entire cycle. Using our parameter estimates and fitting the data
in Fig. 2, we obtain a numerical value for the energy density U ' −5 nNµm. We relate the angle dynamics to the
length by

(5)

where κ = −Φθ U (U < 0) is the rate of longitudinal
growth, which can be interpreted as resulting from remodeling of peptidoglycan subunits with a mean current
κ/π w̄, across the cell surface area A(φ). From an exponential fit to the data for cell length (Fig. 2a), we obtain Φθ = 1.6 × 10−3 (nN µm min)−1 , which gives us
an estimate of the friction coefficient, 1/(π w̄RΦθ ) ' 61
nN µm−1 min, associated with longitudinal growth; e.g.,
MreB motion that is known to correlate strongly with
the insertion of peptidoglycan strands [8]. Our results
are consistent with previous observations of C. crescentus cells with arrested division but continued growth [42].
Constriction begins early and proceeds with the
same time constant as exponential growth. Having characterized the dynamics of growth, we now turn to
constriction at the division plane. As mentioned above,
we obtain the experimental width at each point along
each cell’s medial axis. The typical width profile is nonuniform along its length, exhibiting a pronounced invagination near the cell center (with width wmin (φ); Fig. 1c).
This invagination, which ultimately becomes the division

plane, is readily identifiable early in the cell cycle, even
before noticeable constriction occurs. We discuss the kinetics of constriction in this section, and focus on its location later in the manuscript. As shown in Fig. 3a (black
points), hwmin (φ)i progressively decreases towards zero
until pinching off at φ = 1. Due to the limited spatial
resolution of our imaging (phase contrast microscopy),
the pinch-off process occurring for φ > 0.9 could not be
captured, but hwmin (φ)i at earlier times (i.e., φ < 0.9) is
precisely determined as a function of φ.

To model the dynamics of constriction, we assume as in
Ref. [43] (Fig. 3a, inset): (i) the shape of the zone of constriction is given by two intersecting and partially formed
hemispheres with radii wmax /2; and (ii) constriction proceeds by completing the missing parts of the hemisphere
such that the newly formed cell wall surface maintains
the curvature of the pre-formed spherical segments. As
a result, a simple geometric formula is obtained that relates the width of the constriction zone, wmin (φ), to the

surface area S(φ) of the newly formed cell wall,
q
2
wmin (φ) = wmax 1 − (S(φ)/Smax ) ,

(6)

2
where Smax = πwmax
is the maximum surface area
achieved by the caps as the constriction process is completed, i.e., when wmin (φ = 1) = 0. We assume that the
addition of new cell wall near the division plane initiates
with a rate, κ0 , and thereafter grows exponentially with
a rate, κd , according to,

1 dS
= κd S(φ) + κ0 ,
τ dφ

(7)

subject to the initial condition S(φ = 0) = 0. The first
term on the right-hand side of equation (7) follows from
equation (1), using S(φ) as the shape variable, after incorporating the constriction energy Ediv (φ). The rate of
septal peptidoglycan synthesis, κd , is thus directly proportional to the energy per unit area released during constriction, λ. The solution, S(φ) = κ0 (eκd τ φ − 1)/κd ,
can then be substituted into equation (S.13) to derive

6
the time-dependence of wmin (φ), whose dynamics is con−1
trolled by two time scales: κ−1
d and Smax κ0 .
Fitting equation (S.13) with the data for hwmin (φ)i, we
−1
obtain κ−1
d ' 131 min and Smax κ0 ' 118 min. The fitted values for the time constants controlling constriction
−1
dynamics (κ−1
d and Smax κ0 ) are remarkably similar to
that of exponential cell elongation (hκi−1 ' 125 min).
This shows that septal growth proceeds at a rate comparable to longitudinal growth. Therefore, one of the
main conclusions that we draw is that cell wall constriction (Fig. 3a) is controlled by the same time constant as
exponential longitudinal growth (Fig. 2a).
Having determined the dynamics of wmin (φ), we compute the average width across the entire cell w̄(φ) using
the simplified shape of the constriction zone as shown
in Fig. 3a (inset). The resultant prediction (blue solid
curve in Fig. 2c) is in excellent agreement with the experimental data and captures the dip in hw̄(φ)i seen for
φ > 0.5. Constriction also leads to a drop in the average radius of curvature of the centerline, as shown by the
experimental data in Fig. 2b. In the supplementary material we derive a relation between the centerline radius of
curvature R(φ) and the minimum width wmin (φ), given
−1
(dwmin /dφ), predicting that cell
by R−1 (dR/dφ) = wmin
curvature increases at the same rate as wmin (φ) drops.
Using this relation, we are able to quantitatively capture
the dip in hR(φ)i seen for φ > 0.5 (solid blue curve in Fig.
2b) without invoking any additional fitting parameters.
Origin of the asymmetric location of the primary invagination. We now consider the position of
the division plane and its interplay with cell shape. As
shown in Fig. 3b, the distance of the width minimum
from the stalked pole (lst (φ)) increases through the cell
cycle at the same rate as the full length of the growing cell
(l(φ)), such that their ratio remains constant with timeaveraged mean hlst /li = 0.54 ± 0.05. The presence of the
primary invagination early in the cell cycle is reiterated
in Fig. 3c, which shows the width profile constructed by
ensemble-averaging over each cell at the timepoint immediately following division. In addition to the width minimum wmin (φ), there are two characteristic maxima near
st
sw
either pole, wmax
(φ) and wmax
(φ), respectively (Fig. 3c,
inset). As evident in Fig. 3c, the stalked pole diameter
st
hwmax
(φ)i is on average larger than its swarmer countersw
part hwmax
(φ)i (also see Supplementary Fig. 2a).
We show that the asymmetric location of the invagination (and the asymmetric width profile) can originate
from the distinct mechanical properties inherent to the
pole caps in C. crescentus. The shapes of the cell poles
can be explained by Laplace’s law that relates the pressure difference, P , across the cell wall to the surface tensions in the stalked or the swarmer pole, γpst,sw . The radii
of curvature of the poles then follow from Laplace’s law
Rpst,sw =

2γpst,sw
,
P

(8)

where the superscript (st, sw) denotes the stalked or
the swarmer pole. Thus a larger radius of curvature
in the poles has to be compensated by a higher surface tension to maintain a constant pressure difference
P . Assuming that the poles form hemispheres, we have
st,sw
Rpst,sw = wmax
/2. Our data indicate that the early time
st
sw
ratio for wmax (φ)/wmax
(φ) (φ < 0.1) shows a strong positive correlation with the ratio lst (φ)/lsw (φ), with an avst
sw
erage value hwmax
/wmax
i ' 1.04 (see Supplementary Fig
3a). Laplace’s law then requires that the stalked pole be
mechanically stiffer than the swarmer pole; γpst > γpsw .
This observation suggests that the asymmetry in the
lengths of the stalked and swarmer parts of the cell depends upon different mechanical properties of the respective poles.
To quantitatively support this claim, we investigate an
effective contour model for the cell shape. To this end,
we assume that the fluctuations in cell shape relax more
rapidly than the time scale of growth. This separation
of timescales allows us to derive the equation governing the cell contour by minimizing the total mechanical
energy (equation (2)). From the solution we compute
the resultant width profile for the entire cell (see Supplementary model section). As shown in Fig. 3d, the model
with asymmetric surface tensions of the poles causes the
primary invagination to occur away from the cell midplane. The spatial location of the invagination relative
to the cell length depends linearly on the ratio γpst /γpsw .
Symmetry is restored for γpst /γpsw = 1, as shown in Fig.
3d (blue dashed curve). We note that a gradient in γ
along the cell body would imply differences in longitudinal growth rates between the stalked and the swarmer
portions of the cell (Eq. (1)). Our data exclude this possibility since both lst (φ) and lsw (φ) grow at the same
rate κ, as evidenced by the constancy of their ratio (Fig.
3b and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Because C. crescentus
does not exhibit polar growth, the polar stiffness model
is consistent with the observed uniformity in longitudinal growth rate. In addition, the non-uniformity in cell
width comes from the differences in mechanical response
in the cell wall due to preferential attachment of crescentin along the concave sidewall. For a creS mutant
cell (where kc = 0), our model predicts a uniform width
profile before the onset of constriction.
Cell shape evolution during wall constriction.
The experimental width profiles show that the growing
and constricting cells typically develop a second minimum in width (Fig. 4a,b). These secondary invaginations
are observed in both the stalked and swarmer portions of
single cells in the predivisional stage (φ > 0.6), although
they are more common in the stalked portions (Fig. 5a).
We show here that these secondary minima become the
primary minima in each of the daughter cells. To study
the dynamics of the development of the secondary minist
mum we introduce a new quantity, lmin
(φ), defined as the
distance from the stalked pole to the secondary minimum

in the stalked part (see Fig. 5c, inset). We find that the
st
ratio hlmin
(φ)/lst (φ)i has a mean value of ' 0.55 at later
points in the cell cycle (Fig. 5b), equal to the constant
ratio maintained by the distance from the stalked pole
to the primary minimum, hlst (φ)/l(φ)i. In fact the kymograph of width profiles (shown over 2 generations for
a representative single cell) in Fig. 5c demonstrates that
the predivisional secondary invaginations are inherited
as primary invaginations after division. This mechanism
provides continuity and inheritance of the invaginations
across generations and is an intrinsic element of the mechanism for cell division in C. crescentus.
To quantitatively explain the experimental width profiles during constriction, we use our mechanical model
to determine the instantaneous cell shape by minimizing the total energy (equation (2)) at the specified time
points (see Supplementary model section). To take constriction into account, we impose the constraint that
w(lst , φ) = wmin (φ), where wmin (φ) is determined by
equations (S.13) and (7). In addition, we assume nonuniform materials properties in the cell wall by taking
the tension in the cell poles (γpst,sw ) and the septal region to be higher than the rest of the cell. As constriction proceeds and wmin (φ) decreases, we compute the
shape of the cell contours (Fig. 4c) and the corresponding width profiles (Fig. 4d). The computed width profiles
faithfully reproduce the secondary invaginations, which
become more pronounced as the daughter pole caps become prominent. An example of the experimental width
profiles is shown in Fig. 4b at evenly-spaced intervals in

time for a single generation, and the corresponding model
width profiles are shown in Fig. 4d.
We note that the experimental cell contours in the predivisional stage (φ > 0.9) bend away from the initial
midline axis and develop an alternate growth direction
(Fig. 4a, blue contour). These bend deformations are induced by the microfluidic flow about the pinch-off plane;
the cells become increasingly “floppy” as the constriction
proceeds.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The consistent propagation of a specific shape through
the processes of growth and division relies upon an intricate interplay between the controlled spatiotemporal
expression and localization of proteins, and cytoskeletal
structural elements. The high statistical precision of our
measurements allows us to gain new insights into cell
morphology. From precise determination of cell contours
over time, we observe that a typical cell width profile
is non-uniform at all times with a pronounced primary
invagination appearing during the earliest stages of the
cell cycle. During cell constriction, the decrease in the
minimum width is governed by the same time constant
as exponential axial growth (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the
location of the primary invagination divides the cell contour into its stalked and swarmer compartments, such
that the ratio of the length of the stalked part lst (φ) to
the total pole-to-pole length l(φ) remains constant dur-

two generations here, we indicate values of φ from the first generation as negative (e.g., φ = −0.2 is 20% of the way from the
subsequent division). The green points are not shown for φ < −0.25 due to increased errors in identification. (c) Kymograph

ing the cycle with a mean value hlst (φ)/l(φ)i ' 0.55 (Fig.
3b). These observations and our mechanical model lead
to two important conclusions: first, the dynamics of cell
wall constriction and septal growth occur concomitantly,
and second, the asymmetric location of the primary invagination can be explained by the differences in mechanical properties in the stalked and swarmer poles. A corollary of the first conclusion is that the size ratio threshold
at division occurs naturally without requiring a complex
timing mechanism [19].
In addition to the primary septal invagination, the
cell contours exhibit a pronounced secondary invagination during the predivisional stages (Fig. 4). Remarkably, the secondary invaginations develop at a precise
location relative to the total length of the stalked comst
partments, hlmin
(φ)/lst (φ)i ' 0.55 (Fig. 5b). The data
thus allow a third conclusion: these secondary invaginations are inherited as primary invaginations in each of
the daughter cells, directing the formation of the division
plane in the next generation. Thus, through consistent
and controlled nucleation of invaginations across generations, C. crescentus cells maintain a constant ratio of the

sizes of stalked and swarmer daughter cells.
Our experimental observations and the parameters in
the cell shape model can be related to the current molecular understanding for Gram-negative bacteria, in particular C. crescentus. Before the onset of noticeable
constriction, cell shape is dictated by the mechanical
properties of the peptidoglycan cell wall in addition to
various shape-controlling proteins such as MreB, MreC,
RodZ and CreS. Single molecule tracking studies have
revealed that MreB forms short filamentous bundles anchored to the inner surface of the cell wall and moves
circumferentially at a rate much faster than the rate of
cell growth [8, 44]. In vitro experiments show that MreB
filaments can induce indentation of lipid membranes, suggesting that they may have a preferred radius of curvature [46]. Thus on time scales comparable to cell growth,
Ewidth is determined in part by the energy cost of adhering MreB bundles to the cell wall (see Supplementary
model section).
Bacterial cell division is driven by a large complex of
proteins, commonly known as divisomes that assemble
into the Z-ring structure near the longitudinal mid-plane

9
of the cell [13]. The Z-ring contains FtsZ protofilaments
that are assembled in a patchy band-like structure [47].
FtsZ protofilaments are anchored to the cell membrane
via FtsA and ZipA, and play a crucial role in driving
cell wall constriction [48]. During constriction, the divisome proteins also control peptidoglycan synthesis and
direct the formation of new cell wall via the activity of
penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) [49, 50]. Thus the divisome plays a two-fold role by concomitantly guiding
cell wall constriction and growth of the septal peptidoglycan layer. According to our model the constriction of
the cell wall is driven by the synthesis of septal cell wall
at a rate κd (∼ hκi), which can be directly related to
the activity of PBPs triggered by the divisome assembly.
Furthermore, in our model it is sufficient that the divisome guide the curvature of cell wall growth in the septal
region (see Fig. 3a, inset).
While the mechanism behind the precise asymmetric
location of the division plane in C. crescentus cells is not
well understood, it is likely that the ATPase MipZ helps
division site placement by exhibiting an asymmetric concentration gradient during the predivisional stage [51].
MipZ activity inhibits FtsZ assembly; as a result of polar
localization of MipZ, Z-ring assembly is promoted near
the mid-cell [52]. Our cell shape model suggests that the
early time asymmetric location of the primary invagination, which develops into the division plane, is controlled
by the differences in surface tensions maintained in the
poles. The presence of this invagination at φ = 0, as
inherited from the secondary invaginations in the previous generation, aids in Z-ring assembly at the site of
the invagination. The curvature-sensing capability of the
Z-ring may be enabled by the minimization of the FtsZ
polymer conformational energy that is determined by the
difference between cell surface curvature and FtsZ spontaneous curvature [13, 53].
A higher tension in the stalked pole can be induced
by asymmetric localization of polar proteins, such as
PopZ, early in the cell cycle. Experiments have shown
that PopZ localizes to the stalked pole during the initial
phase of the cell cycle and increasingly accumulates at the
swarmer pole as the cell cycle proceeds [54]. Consistent
with this observation, our data show that the correlation
between the pole sizes (determined by the ratio of surface tension to pressure) and the stalked and swarmer
compartment lengths tend to disappear later in the cycle
(Supplementary Fig. 3), as cell constriction proceeds. A
recent experimental study also demonstrates that molecular perturbation of Clp proteases can destroy the asymmetry of cell division in C. crescentus [55], suggesting the
interplay of subcellular protease activity with the physical properties of the cell wall.
Earlier theoretical models have predicted that a small
amount of pinch-off force from the Z-ring (∼ 8 pN) is
sufficient to accomplish division by establishing a direction along which new peptidoglycan strands can be in-

serted [27]. In contrast, our data combined with the
mathematical model allows the interpretation that the
early time asymmetric invagination in the cell wall can
set the direction for the insertion of new peptidoglycan
strands. Constriction results from exponential growth of
surface area in the septum (at the same rate as longitudinal extension). The instantaneous cell shape is determined by minimizing the energy functional at given
values of the cell size parameters.
Finally, from our estimate of the cell wall energy density U (' −5 nNµm), we predict that a net amount
∆θ|U | ' 2.5 nNµm of mechanical energy is used by the
peptidoglycan network for cell wall growth. For a C. crescentus cell of surface area 12.5−25µm2 , layered with glycan strands of length ∼5 nm and cross-linked by peptide
chains with maximally stretched length ∼4 nm [5], there
are roughly 106 peptidoglycan subunits. Thus on average, each peptidoglycan subunit can consume mechanical
energy of ∼2.4×10−6 nNµm, or ∼0.6 kB T at a temperature T = 31◦ C. Cell wall remodeling and insertion of
new peptidoglycan material can likely create defects in
the peptidoglycan network [56]. One thus expects cellular materials properties to change over time, as a result of
these molecular scale fluctuations. Although we neglect
such variations in our mean field model, it nonetheless
quantitatively captures the average trends in cell shape
features. In future work we plan to more closely connect
the energy terms of the continuum model with molecular
details.

METHODS

Acquisition of experimental data. Data were acquired as in Ref. [19]. Briefly, the inducibly-sticky
Caulobacter crescentus strain FC1428 was introduced
into a microfluidic device and cells were incubated for
one hour in the presence of the vanillate inducer. The
device was placed inside a homemade acrylic microscope
enclosure (3900 × 2800 × 2700 ) equilibrated to 31◦ C (temperature controller: CSC32J, Omega and heater fan:
HGL419, Omega). At the start of the experiment, complex medium (peptone-yeast extract; PYE) was infused
through the channel at a constant flow rate of 7 µL/min
(PHD2000, Harvard Apparatus), which flushed out nonadherent cells. A microscope (Nikon Ti Eclipse with the
“perfect focus” system) and robotic XY stage (Prior Scientific ProScan III) under computerized control (LabView 8.6, National Instrument) were used to acquire
phase-contrast images at a magnification of 250X (EMCCD: Andor iXon+ DU888 1k × 1k pixels, objective:
Nikon Plan Fluor 100X oil objective plus 2.5X expander,
lamp: Nikon C-HFGI) and a frame rate of 1 frame/min
for 15 unique fields of view over 48 hours. In the present
study we use a dataset consisting of 260 cells, corresponding to 9672 generations (division events).

10
Analysis of single cell shape. The acquired phasecontrast images were analyzed using a novel routine we
developed (written in Python). Each image was processed with a pixel-based edge detection algorithm that
applied a local smoothing filter, followed by a bottom-hat
operation. The boundary of each cell was identified by
thresholding the filtered image. A smoothing B-spline
was interpolated through the boundary pixels to construct each cell contour. Each identified cell was then
tracked over time to build a full time series. We chose to
include only cells that divided for more than 10 generations in the analysis. A minimal amount of filtering was
applied to each growth curve to remove spurious points
(e.g., resulting from cells coming together and touching,
or cells twisting out of plane). The timing of every division was verified by visual inspection of the corresponding
phase contrast images, so that the error in this quantity
is approximately set by the image acquisition rate of 1
frame/min.

EXPERIMENTAL CELL SHAPE PARAMETERS

A number of quantities can be immediately calculated from each splined cell contour (Supplementary Fig. 1a),
including the cross-sectional area. The cell medial axis was determined by calculating the Voronoi diagram of the cell
contour [S1], pruning the branches (Supplementary Fig. 1b), and extending this skeleton to the edges of the cell contour
in a manner that preserves average curvature of the medial axis (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The intersections between
the cell medial axis and contour represent the stalked and swarmer poles, respectively. The cell length was calculated
by evaluating the distance along the medial axis between either pole. The cell widths were determined by creating
ribs perpendicular to the medial axis along its length and determining the distances between their intersections with
opposite sides of the cell contour (Supplementary Fig. 1d). To calculate time-averaged quantities, we normalized
trajectories for each generation by the respective division time τ (thus converting each variable to a function of
φ ≡ t/τ ). We then split these data into 73 bins, as hτ i = 73 ± 7 min under these conditions, and ensemble-averaged
each of these bins over every generation.

Supplementary Figure 1. Procedure for calculating shape parameters. (a) B-spline cell contour extracted from
segmented phase contrast image. (b) The interior part of the medial cell axis was obtained by taking the Voronoi diagram of
the cell contour, which is equivalent to the locus of inscribed circles. (c) The medial axis located on each side of the width
minimum (excluding the constriction zone) was extended to either pole such that average radius of curvature remained constant.
(d) The cell widths are the ribs perpendicular to the medial axis.

We can define five specific values of the width according to the local minima and maxima in the width profile (wmin ,

in the width profile, wmin , we can also determine two local maxima, wmax

until hwmax (φ)i ≈ hwmax (φ)i. In some cases, additional secondary local minima are observed, wmin

corresponding respectively to the stalked and swarmer portions (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although we note the value
of these quantities for early times here (where they are approximately equal to their respective local maxima), these
minima can only be determined with certainty at later times (φ > 0.6). There, we observe the presence of a secondary
minimum in the stalked portions of most cells.

Supplementary Table 1. Average values of the cell shape parameters that are assumed constant over the
st
sw
specified time interval of φ. The time-average value of the width hw̄i is smaller than both hwmin
i and hwmin
i because it
accounts for the width at the primary minimum wmin . Note the close correspondence between either width maximum and its
st
st
corresponding minimum for φ < 0.6, as well as wmax
and lmin
. Both width and radius of curvature for the swarmer portion are
smaller than their respective values for the stalked portion.

We split each cell into stalked and swarmer portions according to the location of the primary minimum in the width
profile. The radius of curvature (R) was calculated as the radius of the best-fit circle to the cell medial axis. We tested
two methods of determining the radius of curvature: (I) fitting the whole cell to a circle or (II) fitting the stalked and
swarmer portions separately. At early times in the cell cycle, (II) gives poorer results because of fewer data points.
At later times in the cell cycle, (I) gives poorer results because the stalked and swarmer portions can indeed have
differing radii of curvature, which we attribute to the alignment of the swarmer portion of the cell with the direction
of fluid flow after the division plane has narrowed enough that it becomes mechanically decoupled from the stalked
portion, i.e., like a flexible hinge. However, in the mean the results of (II) are equal to the value calculated by (I)
for earlier times. Therefore, we use only data from method (I) but exclude later time points (Supplementary Fig.
2c). Because of the variation in the values of the calculated radius of curvature was large, such that we cannot define
a reasonable arithmetic mean without arbitrarily filtering the dataset, we first averaged the corresponding unsigned
curvature (equivalent to hR−1 i) and then converted to radius of curvature (i.e., what we report as hRi is actually the
harmonic mean, calculated as hR−1 i−1 ).
The length was also split according to the locations of the local minima, into lst (distance along cell medial axis
st
from stalked pole to wmin ), lsw (distance along cell medial axis from swarmer pole to wmin ), lmin
(distance along cell
st
sw
sw
medial axis from stalked pole to wmin ), and lmin (distance along cell medial axis from swarmer pole to wmin
). The
st
st
value of l and lmin are compared in Supplementary Fig. 2d. Note that the length of the stalked portion lst grows
exponentially, with the same time constant as the length l (as does lsw , although it is not shown here for clarity),
which is a necessary condition for the addition of peptidoglycan material along the entire length of the cell when the
location of wmin is set at early times. At later times (φ > 0.6), the length from stalked pole to secondary minimum
st
lmin
also starts to increase.
We relate the asymmetry in the length of stalked and swarmer portions at early times to asymmetries in the stalked
and swarmer poles. The model predicts a linear relationship between the ratio of lengths lst /lsw and the ratio of the
tensions at either pole γpst /γpsw . We cannot directly measure the latter quantity, but from Laplace’s law it is equal
to the inverse ratio of the mean curvatures at either pole, which we approximate as the inverse of half the maximum
st
sw
pole width, assuming that the poles are hemispheres with diameter wmax
and wmax
, respectively. Supplementary Fig.

only for Supplementary Fig. 3a, for which R2 = 0.15 (linear fits to all other plots produced values of R2 < 0.05). This

case of a symmetric cell) to (1.2, 1.04), corresponding to the red solid curve in Fig. 3d of the main text (which is the
case of the average asymmetric C. crescentus cell). Note that at times φ > 0.6, any correlation disappears.
In order to quantify the error in our width profiles, we imaged a single field of view of 24 C. crescentus cells perfused
in complex medium at 31◦ C at a frame rate of 5 frames per second (300 times faster than the frame rate used to
acquire all other data), and calculated the splined contours for each cell. We focused in particular on a single “dead”
(non-growing and non-dividing) cell, and found the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of nearest points along the
cell contour between subsequent frames to be 12 nm. In addition, we found the RMSD of equivalent points along the

width profile between subsequent frames to be 28 nm, or a 3.2% pinch depth at the average value of wmax

CELL SHAPE MODEL

Cell Wall Mechanics. The total energy E for the bacterial cell wall is given as the sum of contributions from
an active internal pressure P driving cell volume (V ) expansion, mechanical energy Ewall in the cell wall, and the
mechanical energy of interactions with cytoskeletal proteins Eproteins :
E = −P V + Ewall + Eproteins .

(S.1)

The bacterial cell wall consists of a network of glycan strands cross-linked by peptide chains know as the peptidoglycan
network. Growth occurs via the insertion of new peptidoglycan strands into the existing network along with the
breaking of existing bonds due to turgor pressure induced stretching. We assume that elastic equilibrium is reached
rapidly as compared to the rate of synthesis of new material [S2]. As a result of cell wall remodeling and irreversible
elongation, growth can be understood as resulting from plastic deformations [S3–5]. To understand the origin of the
cell wall tension, γ, in the model introduced in the main text, we consider the cell wall as a thin elastic shell that
deforms plastically when stretched beyond a maximum strain εY , the yield strain. A thin shell has two modes of
elastic deformations, bending and stretching [S6], such that Ewall = Estretch + Ebend . In the limit of small thickness
of the shell h as compared to its radii of curvature, one can neglect the bending energy (that scales as Ebend ∼ h3 )

whereas the stretching energy Estetch is given by,
Estretch

Z
dA σij εij

(S.2)

where σij is the mechanical stress tensor and εij is the strain tensor. As yield strain is reached at the onset of growth,
we have εij = εY δij (assuming isotropic stretching), where δij is the Kronecker delta. Furthermore, assuming a
Hookean constitutive relation for the stress tensor [S6]
σij =

Y
[(1 − ν)εij + νεkk δij ] ,
1 − ν2

(S.3)

where Y is the Young’s modulus and ν is the Poisson ratio, we have Estretch = γA, where,

For a Gram-negative bacterial cell wall of thickness h ∼ 3 nm, elastic modulus Y ∼ 40 MPa [S7] and average yield
strain εY ∼ 0.5, the wall tension is estimated to be γ = 50 nN/µm. While the actual value for the turgor pressure
counteracting this tension can be contested, our choice for the numerical value for internal pressure P can be justified
using a simple mechanical argument. Radial force-balance dictates that in order to maintain an average cross-sectional
radius r ' 0.4 µm, a cell wall with surface tension γ ∼ 50 nm/µm has to balance an internal pressure of magnitude
P = 2γ/r ' 0.25 MPa, which is numerically very close to our choice for P = 0.3 MPa.
Cytoskeletal bundle mechanics. Next, we model the mechanical energy in the cell wall due to interactions with
cytoskeletal proteins. Our minimalist approach considers two crucial protein bundles that are directly responsible
for maintaining the shape of C. crescentus cells. MreB protein bundles contribute an effective energy Ewidth , which
favors a rod-like shape, and crescentin filament bundles contribute an energy Ecres , which favors a crescent-like shape.
We thus have Eproteins = Ewidth + Ecres . MreB subunits form patchy filamentous bundles adherent to the cell wall
and oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the cell [S8, 9]. The elastic energy stored in an adherent MreB subunit
is given by


where i labels the subunit, ri is the circumferential radius of curvature of the cell wall where the subunit is attached, `i
is the length of the subunit, Rm is the intrinsic radius of curvature and kb is the bending rigidity of the associated
MreB
PN
bundle. The total energy imparted by a collection of Nm attached MreB subunits is given by Ewidth = i m EMreB,i .
Next, employing a continuum mean field assumption, we replace individual subunit lengths by their average length
h`i ' 5 nm [S10] and assume a uniform number density ρm of MreB subunits in the cell surface to obtain

(S.6)

where, km = kb ρm h`i is the effective bending modulus due to MreB induced traction forces. The bending rigidity
of an MreB bundle is given by kb = kMreB nξ , where kMreB is the flexural rigidity of MreB filaments (assumed to
be similar to F-actin), n is the number of MreB protofilaments per bundle, and ξ is an exponent in the range 1–2
depending on the strength of crosslinking or bundling agents [S11]. MreB filaments in a bundle appear to have strong
lateral interaction with negligible filament sliding, so we assume ξ ' 2. The diameter of an MreB protofilament is
∼ 4 nm [S12] and the average width of an MreB bundle has been determined from super-resolution imaging to be in
the range 60-90 nm [S13], giving the estimate n ∼ 15-22. Estimating the surface number density of MreB subunits as
ρm ∼ 5 × 104 µm−2 and using kmreb ' 10−4 nNµm2 [S14], we obtain km in the range 5.6–12.1 nNµm.
Crescentin proteins form a cohesive bundled structure anchored to the sidewall of C. crescentus cells. The energetic
contribution due to crescentin is given by
Ecres =



ds c(s) −

Rc

(S.7)

where kc is the bending rigidity, s is an arc-length parameter, c(s) is the longitudinal curvature of the cell wall and
Rc is the preferred radius of curvature of crescentin bundles. The bending rigidity of crescentin can be expressed as
kc = Yc I, where Yc is the Young’s modulus and I is the area moment of inertia of the bundle (with width wc ) given
by I = πwc4 /64. Since crescentin is an intermediate filament homologue, we assume that Yc is similar to the Young’s
modulus of intermediate filament bundles given by Yc ∼ 300 MPa [S15]. Assuming wc ∼ 0.1 µm, we estimate the
bending rigidity of a crescentin bundle to be kc ∼ 1.5 nNµm2 .
Mean field model for cell shape and size dynamics. As described in the main text, the total mechanical
energy in the cell wall of C. crescentus cells can be given as a sum of contributions from internal pressure, wall surface
tension, mechanical energy of interactions with bundles of cytoskeletal proteins such as crescentin and MreB, and the
constriction energy Ediv during cell division. In the mean field description, we neglect the contributions from Ediv
and disregard any spatial variations in cell geometry. The mean field description is a good approximation of the cell
shape dynamics for φ < 0.5, where the average width and the midline radius of curvature remains constant (Fig. 2 in
the main text). We approximate the shape of C. crescentus cells as the segment of a torus with radius of curvature
R(t), cross-sectional width w̄(t) and spanning angle θ(t). We also neglect the pole caps that are mechanically rigid
and do not remodel during wall growth. The total energy is then given by
E[w̄, R, θ] = −P (π w̄2 Rθ)/4 + γ(πRw̄θ) + Ewidth + Ecres ,

(S.8)

where

(S.9)

(S.10)

From the above expressions, we see that the total energy has the scaling form E[w̄, R, θ] = θU [w̄, R]. According to
Eq. (1) in the main text, the dynamics of the radius of curvature R, the spanning angle θ and the width w are given
by

(S.11a)
(S.11b)
(S.11c)

where ΦR , Φθ and Φw are the rate constants. The steady-state values for the radius of curvature of the centerline
and the cross-sectional width is given by the solutions to ∂R U = 0 and ∂w U = 0. As shown in Supplementary Fig.
4a the energy density U admits a stable absolute minimum in width, controlled by the stiffness parameter km such
that for lower values of km (red curve in Supplementary Fig. 4a), U does not have a minimum and the width grows in
time rendering the rod-like shape unstable. Similarly, the parameter kc controls cell curvature, such that the energy
density has a stable absolute minimum in R beyond a critical stiffness kc (Supplementary Fig. 4b). At lower values
of kc the cell does not have a stable radius of curvature and the energy is minimized by increasing R. This leads to

17
straightening of the cell’s medial axis. In the parameter range where the cell maintains a stable value for w̄ and R,
the energy density U becomes a constant during cell elongation. From the growth law introduced in the main text,
the spanning angle θ evolves in time according to the equation
dθ
= −(Φθ U )θ(t) ,
dt

(S.12)

such that the condition for exponential growth becomes U < 0.

km = 40 (green) and km = 50 (blue), for a fixed radius of curvature R = 4.4 µm and kc = 2 nNµm2 . The absolute minima (if
it exists) are indicated by solid circles. (b) U as a function of radius of curvature R at various values of crescentin stiffness (in

Other parameters: P = 0.3 MPa, γ = 50 nN/µm, Rc = 0.5 µm, Rm = 0.31 µm.

Constriction dynamics. As described in the main text, we assume that the shape of the constriction zone is
given by two intersecting hemishperical segments with diameter wmax . The total surface area of the septum is given
by S(t) = πwmax ls (t), where ls (t) is the total length of the spherical segments (see Supplementary Fig. 5a). Using
elementary geometry, we obtain the following relation between ls (t) and the minimum width, wmin (t):
p
wmin (t) = wmax 1 − (ls (t)/wmax )2 .
(S.13)
If septal growth occurs by addition of new peptidoglycan strands while maintaining the curvature of the spherical
segments, then ls (t) is the shape variable controlling the growth of septal surface area S as well as the constriction
dynamics of wmin (t). To describe the dynamics of ls (t), we assume that initial phase of elongation occurs with a
velocity v0 , and thereafter growth follows an exponential law with rate κd ,
dls
= v0 + κd ls (t) .
dt

(S.14)

Multiplying both sides of the equation by πwmax , we derive the growth dynamics of the surface area S(t),
dS
= κ0 + κd S(t) ,
dt

(S.15)

where κ0 = πwmax v0 . Having determined the dynamics of wmin , one can evaluate the time-dependence of the average

is in excellent agreement with the experimental data and captures the dip in w̄(t) seen for φ > 0.5. Fig. 2b in the
main text also shows that the radius of curvature of the centerline (R(t)) drops for φ > 0.5 when cell constriction is
prominent. Therefore we examine the role of constriction dynamics on the time-dependence of the centerline radius
of curvature.
The centerline spans a distance ls (t) and an angle θs (t) in the septal region, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a.
Consider a small segment δls (t) along the centerline with a local radius of curvature R and spanning angle δθs . We
then have the relation δls (t) = R(t)δθs (t). This leads to the following identity,

the relations, wmax sin ψ(t) = wmin (t) and wmax cos ψ(t) = ls (t), we get δψ(t) = δwmin (t)/ls (t) = −δls (t)/wmin (t).
The last equality follows after variations of Eq. (S.13). As a result we have the following kinetic relation,

Combining the identities in Eq. (S.17) and (S.18) we get, R−1 dR/dt = wmin

Contour Model for cell shape. To quantitatively capture the experimentally observed spatial variations in
cell shape we study an effective two-dimensional contour model for the cell shape. This approach facilitates closer
comparison with the two-dimensional splined contours obtained from our experimental data. The contour description
of the rod-like cell shape negelects circumferential variations in cell geometry. The model incorporates non-uniform
materials properties and mechanical constraints across the cell wall, with the poles and the septal region being
mechanically stiffer than the rest of the cell wall. By exploiting the rod-like geometry, one can use the centerline
curve to divide the contour into two parts, the upper and the lower cell wall. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5b we
further subdivide the cell contour into the stalked and swarmer poles (pst/sw ), the upper (1st/sw ) and lower cell wall
(2st/sw ), and the septal region (sep).
We parametrize the instantaneous shape of the cell contour using the two-dimensional centerline curve R(u, t),
the length of the centerline l(t) and the width w(u, t), where u is the absolute distance along the centerline from
the stalked pole such that u ∈ [0, l(t)]. If n̂ denotes the outward unit normal vector on the centerline, the curves
defining the upper and lower parts of the cell contour, r± (u, t), are given by the relation, r± = R ± w± n̂, where w± (u)
represent the perpendicular distances of the top and bottom curves from the centerline. The total cell width is then
given by w(u, t) = w+ (u, t) + w− (u, t).

19
It is convenient to switch to polar coordinates, where the shape of the cell contour is given by the re-parametrized
curve r± (ϕ, t), where 0 < ϕ < θ(t) is the angular coordinate spanning the centerline, which can be approximated as
the arc of a circle with radius R(t). Since the ratio w± /R (' 0.1) is small at all times, one can approximate the local
curvature as

where prime denotes derivative with respect to ϕ and the subscripts ± represent the upper and the lower part of
the cell contour respectively. Furthermore, in the linear regime, the differential arc length can be approximated as
du ' Rdϕ. The dynamics of the shape parameters l(t), θ(t), and R(t) are determined from the kinetic law in Eq. (1)
of the main text.
The instantaneous width profile w(u, t) results from minimizing the total energy functional, which leads to the
following shape equation,
P − γ(u)c± (u, t) + fwidth (u, t) + fcres (u, t) = 0 ,

(S.20)

where, γ(u) is the tension on the cell contour and fwidth (u, t) and fcres (u, t) are the linear force densities on the contour
due to maintenance of width and the crescent shape, respectively. In the contour model we simplify the energetic
contribution due to maintenance of width (acting on the sections 1st/sw and 2st/sw ) as
Z

(S.21)
Ewidth =

where the elastic constant Km depends on the bending rigidity km introduced in the main text as Km = km /Rm
. This
linear approximation holds if (w± − Rm )/Rm  1. From our data and mean field model fits we get (w± − Rm )/Rm '
0.15. The resultant force density is given by fwidth (u, t) = −Km (w± (u, t) − Rm ).
The bending energy induced by crescentin protein bundles anchored onto the cell wall (regions 1st/sw ) is given by

Ecres =

where c0 = 1/Rc is the spontaneous curvature of the crescentin bundle, and s is the arc-length parameter along the
upper part of the cell contour (1st/sw ) which is related to u as ds = du − w+ dϕ. To obtain the force density we
consider an infinitesimal deformation, δr, of the upper contour as r+ → r+ + n+ δr, where n+ is the outward unit
normal. Accordingly the curvature and the differential arc-length changes, c+ → c+ + δc+ and ds → ds + δ(ds), where
δc+ = c2+ δr + d2 (δr)/ds2 and
R δ(ds) = −c+ ds [S16]. The resultant force density is obtained after variations of the
energy functional, δEcres = fcres δrds, where fcres δrds = δ[(c+ − c0 )2 ds]. This leads to the following non-linear force

Compartmentalizing the cell contour. (1) Pole caps: The cell poles are assumed to be mechanically inert in
the sense that they do not interact with the active cytoskeletal proteins such that fwidth = fcres = 0. The mechanical
forces acting on the cell poles come from turgor pressure P , and the tension γp . The shape of the cell poles are then
described by the two-dimensional Laplace’s law,
γpst,sw c± (u, t) = P ,

(S.25)

where the superscripts st and sw denote respectively the stalked and swarmer poles.
(2) Upper cell contour (1st/sw ): The region 1st/sw in the upper cell contour obeys the force-balance equation:
P − γc+ (u, t) + fwidth (u, t) + fcres (u, t) = 0 .

(S.26)

20
At the endpoints of the segments 1st/sw we impose the boundary condition that the curvature c must equal the
longitudinal curvature of the poles.
(3) Bottom cell contour (2st/sw ): In the absence of crescentin, the region 2st/sw in the bottom cell contour obeys
the force-balance equation:
P − γc− (u, t) + fwidth (u, t) = 0 .

(S.27)

(4) Septal region: We incorporate the effect of constriction in the cell shape equation by imposing the constraint
(boundary condition) that w(lst (t), t) = wmin (t), where wmin (t) evolves according to the kinetics described in Eq. (6)
and (7) of the main text. Furthermore, the curvatures at the end points of the septal segments must conform to the
curvature of the newly formed poles. Subject to these boundary conditions, the width profile in the upper septal
region (lst − ls /2 < u < lst + ls /2) is given by,
P − γs c+ (u, t) + fwidth (u, t) + fcres (u, t) = 0 ,

(S.28)

with a surface tension (γs ) of the newly formed poles chosen to be much higher than the peripheral region, γs ' 4.5γ.
The contour below the centerline obeys the equation,
P − γs c− (u, t) + fwidth (u, t) = 0 .

(S.29)

The governing cell shape equation given in Eq. (S.20), is then solved numerically in each part of the cell contour
with matching boundary conditions in w± (u, t) and its derivatives.
