On Bounded Positive Stationary Solutions
for a Nonlocal Fisher-KPP Equation
Franz Achleitner and Christian Kuehn∗
August 12, 2014
Abstract
We study the existence of stationary solutions for a nonlocal version of the FisherKolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation. The main motivation is a recent
study by Berestycki et al. [Nonlinearity 22 (2009), pp. 2813–2844] where the nonlocal FKPP equation has been studied and it was shown for the spatial domain R and
sufficiently small nonlocality that there are only two bounded non-negative stationary
solutions. Here we provide a similar result for Rd using a completely different approach.
In particular, an abstract perturbation argument is used in suitable weighted Sobolev
spaces. One aim of the alternative strategy is that it can eventually be generalized
to obtain persistence results for hyperbolic invariant sets for other nonlocal evolution
equations on unbounded domains with small nonlocality, i.e., to improve our understanding in applications when a small nonlocal influence alters the dynamics and when
it does not.

Keywords: Fisher-KPP equation, FKPP, nonlocal convolution operator, steady state,
stationary solution, weighted Sobolev space, implicit function theorem, perturbation theory.

Introduction

The (local) Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov (FKPP) equation is given by
∂u
= ∆u + µu(1 − u),
∂t

x ∈ Rd , u : Rd × [0, ∞) → R, u = u(x, t),

(1)

P
∂2
where µ > 0 is a parameter and ∆ = di=1 ∂x
2 denotes the Laplacian. Originally the equation
i
was studied by Fisher [20] and Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscounov [30] for d = 1 with a focus
on traveling waves connecting the two homogeneous stationary (or steady) states u ≡ 0 and
u ≡ 1. The FKPP equation has been studied extensively as a standard model for invasion
waves in mathematical biology [42, 39] and for propagation into unstable states in physics
[16], often with a focus on the wave speed [4, 5].

This paper is directly motivated by the results of Berestycki et al. [7] who considered a
nonlocal version of FKPP equation
∂u
= ∆u + µu(1 − φ ∗ u),
∂t
where φ : Rd → R is a kernel for the convolution

The term φ ∗ u models nonlocal saturation or competition effects [34]. The nonlocal FKPP
equation (2) has been studied from various perspectives [1, 8, 9, 17, 23, 25, 40] with a focus
on stability analysis of steady states, the existence of traveling waves and applications in
mathematical biology; there are also several results available for bounded domains [22, 43]
instead of Rd . Other types of nonlocality may arise instead of the nonlinear term u(φ ∗ u)
[11, 10, 44, 47], generalizations of (2) have been considered [16, 48] as well as the nonlocal
bistable case [2]. Furthermore, there are several other different nonlocal versions of the
FKPP equation involving time delay [3, 49] or nonlocal diffusion via fractional operators
[13, 18, 36].
In this paper we focus on the analysis of stationary solutions for the FKPP equation (2)
which satisfy
0 = ∆u + µu(1 − φ ∗ u),

x ∈ Rd , u : Rd → R, x 7→ u(x).

(3)

The main goal is to understand certain subclasses of classical solutions u ∈ Cb2 (Rd , R) =: Cb2
which satisfy (3) pointwise. However, we shall need weaker solution spaces to infer properties
about the relevant classical solutions. It is assumed in [7] that the kernel satisfies

φ ≥ 0,
φ(0) > 0,
∇φ ∈ Cb (R ),
φ(x) dx = 1,

Observe that u ≡ 0 is a solution of (3) and since Rd φ dx = 1 it follows that u ≡ 1 is also
always a solution of (3). Note that a Gaussian probability density and a (suitably extended)
exponential probability density satisfy the assumptions (4). Considering x̃ := σx, a function
ũ(x̃) := u(x̃/σ) = u(x) and kernel φσ (x̃) := σ1d φ(x̃/σ) = σ1d φ(x) one finds, upon dropping
the tildes and letting µ = σ 2 , that
0 = ∆u + u(1 − φσ ∗ u) =: F (u, σ),

(5)

Hence, upon a space rescaling, the equations (3) and (5) are equivalent if µ 6= 0 and σ 6= 0.
We shall work with the version (5) from now on. The kernel φσ converges to a deltadistribution limσ→0 φσ (x) = δ(x). In the limit σ = 0 for (5) one recovers the standard
elliptic (local) FKPP steady state problem
0 = ∆u + u(1 − u),

(6)

which again has the homogeneous steady-states u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1. Note that the formal
limits µ = 0 and σ = 0 do not coincide, if the spatial scaling is disregarded, since
(5) for σ → 0 ⇒

0 = ∆u + u(1 − u)

6↔

(3) for µ → 0 ⇒

0 = ∆u.

For the one-dimensional case, the following result for the nonlocal FKPP-equation is known:
2

Theorem 1.1 ([7], d = 1). Suppose the assumptions (4) hold. There exists σ0 > 0 (µ0 > 0)
such that for σ ∈ [0, σ0 ] (µ ∈ (0, µ0]) the only bounded non-negative classical solutions of the
stationary nonlocal FKPP equation (5) (respectively (3)) are u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1.
Theorem 1.1 is a persistence result which shows that if the nonlocal effect is sufficiently
small then there are no additional non-negative bounded solutions beyond the two trivial
ones. The proof by Berestycki et al. [7] uses a combination of a-priori estimates, explicit
Taylor expansion, approximation on finite regions and several integral estimates.
In this paper we provide a result similar to Theorem 1.1 for arbitrary dimensions. We
also lift some assumptions on the kernel φ. This main result is stated in Section 2. We note
that our proof does not use the approach in [7]. We use a perturbation technique involving
the implicit function theorem in suitable function spaces, bifurcation theory and knowledge
about the limiting equation (6) for σ = 0; the strategy of the proof is outlined in Section 2.

The Main Result

Instead of the assumptions (4) we shall require that
R
(A) φ ∈ L1 (Rd ), φ ≥ 0 with Rd φ(x) dx = 1.

We note that some of the assumptions (4) have also been removed in [26] for the case
d = 1. However, to remove any form of integrability or boundedness assumption of the
kernel φ seems to be very difficult, if not impossible.
Theorem 2.1 (d ∈ N). Suppose (A) holds. For a positive constant K > 1, there exists a
σ0 > 0 (µ0 > 0) such that for σ ∈ [0, σ0 ] (µ ∈ (0, µ0]) the only bounded non-negative classical
solutions u ∈ Cb2 (Rd ) with 0 ≤ kukCb2 ≤ K of the stationary nonlocal FKPP equation (5)
(respectively (3)) are u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1.
We point out that in Theorem 2.1 the constant σ0 (respectively µ0 > 0) does depend upon
K > 1. Indeed, the main difference of Theorem 2.1 compared to Theorem 1.1 is that our
perturbation approach allows for the existence of certain solution branches (uj , σj ), where
uj depends upon σj , and a certain weighted norm of uj becomes unbounded as σj → 0 for
j → +∞. In fact, the restriction on kukCb2 can be weakened to a weighted Sobolev norm
bound described below.
We outline, on a formal level, the main steps of the perturbation argument:
(S1) The local problem: The case σ = 0 is well understood and we collect the relevant results
later in this section. In particular, it is known that the only bounded non-negative
solutions of the (local) FKPP equation (6) are u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1.
(S2) Function spaces: To analyze the problem we utilize spaces for weak solutions to infer
results about classical solutions. In particular, one would like to choose Banach spaces
which include the homogeneous stationary solutions and are adapted to the linear and
nonlinear parts of the mapping F (u, σ) induced by the nonlocal FKPP equation (5).
We use suitably weighted Sobolev spaces and their intersections in this paper; see
Section 3.
3

(S3) Regular points: It turns out that the solution (u, σ) = (1, 0) can be viewed as a regular
point of F , i.e. the Frechét derivative (Du F )(1,0) is invertible as a linear map in the
spaces chosen in (S2). Then the implicit function theorem shows that the solution
branch (u, σ) = (1, 0) is locally unique for sufficiently small σ; see Section 4.
(S4) Special points: The solution (u, σ) = (0, 0) cannot be treated directly using the implicit
function theorem. Hence it requires a special technique. We use results about purely
oscillatory solutions to show that any possible bifurcating solutions near the special
point must change sign; see Section 5.
(S5) Additional branches: Using an argument from bifurcation theory we show that there
are no additional branches of non-negative bounded solutions outside of neighborhoods
of the two states (u, σ) = (0, 0) and (u, σ) = (1, 0) for sufficiently small σ0 > 0; see also
Figure 1(a)-(b). The details of this argument can be found in Section 6.
It is important to point out that the steps (S1)-(S5) have been designed with a view
towards other persistence problems arising in nonlocal evolution equations; this extension is
discussed in Section 7. Let us also remark that the main technical complications arise due
to the unbounded domain Rd and the convolution term φσ ∗ u which substantially restrict
the type of spaces one may use in (S2).

Figure 1: Sketch of possible bifurcation scenarios in (kukX , σ)-space. The thick lines mark
the homogeneous stationary states u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1. The thin curves indicate possible
bifurcation curves. The cases (a)-(b) are impossible as they would violate the result for the
local problem σ = 0. The case (c) near (u, σ) = (1, 0) will be shown to be impossible using
the implicit function theorem. We are going to show that the only solutions that could
potentially bifurcate near (u, σ) = (0, 0) are solutions which change sign.
Regardless of these complications, it is always key to understand the step (S1) for a
perturbation argument. In particular, consider the PDE
0 = ∆u + uf (u),

x ∈ Rd , u : Rd → R, x 7→ u(x).

Suppose f : R → R is C 2 . The following result is known:

(7)

Theorem 2.2. (see e.g. [6, 31]) Suppose f (u) < 0 for all u ∈ R+ with u ≥ β0 for some
β0 > 0 and f ′ (u) < 0 for all u ∈ R+ = (0, +∞). Then there exists a unique positive solution
u∗ ∈ C 2 (Rd , R+ ) for (7) such that inf x∈Rd u∗ (x) > 0.
4

Further variations and generalizations of the previous result are also known [4, 46]. For
f (u) = 1 − u one may just apply Theorem 2.2 with β0 = 1 – see also [14] – which yields the
following:
Lemma 2.3. The only non-negative solutions of (6) are u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1.
In particular, consider a bifurcation diagram in the space {(σ, kukX )}, where the norm
k · kX is defined in the next section, as shown in Figure 1. The idea is to show that there
cannot be any solution branches tangent to or crossing the vertical segments {0} × (0, 1) and
{0}×(1, ∞). However, this does not exclude bifurcating solution branches from (σ, u) = (0, 0)
or (σ, u) = (0, 1).

Function Spaces

To analyze the local behavior of solutions one possibility is to consider the problem via an
abstract nonlinear map. Let X, Y be Banach spaces and I = [0, σ0 ] ⊂ R be an interval for
some σ0 > 0 chosen sufficiently small. Then the mapping F : X × I → Y given by
F (u, σ) = ∆u + u(1 − φσ ∗ u)

(8)

has as a zero set {(u, σ) ∈ X × I : F (u, σ) = 0} the stationary solutions in X of the nonlocal
FKPP equation. A choice of function spaces X and Y is required to carry out the analysis
explicitly. It seems natural to consider Sobolev spaces W k,p (Rd ) for X and Y . However,
u(x) ≡ 1 and other nonzero constants do not belong to W k,p(Rd ). Since we eventually want
to compute a (Fréchet) derivative of F at (u, σ) = (1, 0) the standard Sobolev spaces do not
suffice. Another natural option would be Hölder spaces C k+γ (Rd ) for k ∈ N0 and γ ∈ (0, 1).
The norm in C k+γ (Rd ) is given by
X
kukC k+γ (Rd ) =
kDα uk∞ + huiC k+γ (Rd ) ,
|α|≤k

where α = (α1 , α2 , . . . , αd ) is a multi-index with αi ∈ N0 , |α| =

αi and

|Dα u(x) − Dα u(y)|
.
|x − y|γ

C k+γ (Rd ) does contain the constants but in this case there are problems with the convolution
term φσ ∗ u which leads to complications regarding continuity properties of the mapping F .
In this paper we use weighted Sobolev spaces to avoid these problems. However, there could
certainly be other good choices which we do not consider here.
Let w ∈ L1 (Rd ) denote a positive weight function and define the weighted Sobolev space
W k,p(Rd ; w) for p ∈ (1, ∞) as
W k,p (Rd ; w) = {u : w 1/p (Dα u) ∈ Lp (Rd ) for all |α| ≤ k}.
5

With the norm


kukk,p;w := 

XZ

|α|≤k

Rd

1/p

|Dα u(x)|p w(x) dx

the space W k,p (Rd ; w) is a Banach space [32]. Note that for k = 0 we just have Lp (Rd ; w) :=
W 0,p (Rd ; w) with norm k · kp;w . If p = 2 we shall also use the standard notation H k (Rd ; w) :=
W k,2(Rd ; w) for the Hilbert space case. We start by fixing the main spaces
X = W k+2,p (Rd ; wX ) ∩ W k,2p (Rd ; wX )

and

Y = W k,p (Rd ; wY )

(9)

for k ∈ N0 and the norm on X is given by
kukX = max{kukk+2,p;wX , kukk,2p;wX }.
With a view towards bounded classical solutions, we observe that one always has Cb2 (Rd ) ⊂
X. For concreteness, we make a choice of weights as well as exponent p.
(B) Let k · k denote the usual Euclidean norm on Rd and let lX , lY be constants such that
1
< lX ≤ lY < ∞. For the spaces X and Y make the choice
2
p = 2,

wX (x) =

1
,
(1 + kxk2 )lX

wY (x) =

1
.
(1 + kxk2 )lY

(10)

For (10) we have the pointwise estimate wY (x) ≤ wX (x) for all x ∈ Rd which implies
that one may order the associated norms
kukk,p;wY ≤ kukk,p;wX .

(11)

The choice of spaces requires some explanation. To use the intersection of two weighted
spaces for X is convenient to gain continuity of F as the nonlinear term u(φσ ∗u) is essentially
a product of two terms. The particular choice (B) is going to allow us to use some known
results about H k+2(Rd ; wX ) which are helpful to shorten the proof. Appendix C contains a
sketch how one may approach the case (9) for more general p, wX and wY and avoid using
results about H k+2 (Rd ; wX ). It seems important to include this outline as we shall explain
in the remarks after Proposition 4.2.
Remark: The choice (B) is an auxiliary tool for the analysis and the proof of Theorem 2.1.
Essentially the idea is analogous to existence and regularity theory for elliptic equations with
smooth input data where weak solution spaces are an analytic tool but do not appear in the final
result.
Before we establish the continuity and differentiability properties of (8) one may check
that F : X → Y is indeed a well-defined map.
Lemma 3.1. Suppose (A)-(B) hold then the map F : X × I → Y is well-defined, i.e., if
(u, σ) ∈ X × I then F (u, σ) ∈ Y .

6

Proof. By the triangle inequality and (11) we have
kF (u, σ)kY = k∆u + u(1 − φσ ∗ u)kk,p;wY ≤ k∆ukk,p;wX + kukk,p;wX + ku(φσ ∗ u)kk,p;wX
and the first two terms are finite since u ∈ W k+2,p(Rd ; wX ). For the third term we have
X
ku(φσ ∗ u)kpk,p;wX =
k(Dα u)(φσ ∗ u) + u(φσ ∗ Dα u)kpp;wX
|α|≤k

≤

|α|≤k

(k(Dα u)(φσ ∗ u)kp;wX + ku(φσ ∗ Dα u)kp;wX )p .

Furthermore, by Cauchy-Schwarz it follows that
k(Dα u)(φσ ∗ u)kp;wX ≤ kDα uk2p;wX kφσ ∗ uk2p;wX ,
ku(φσ ∗ Dα u)kp;wX ≤ kuk2p;wX kφσ ∗ Dα uk2p;wX .

(12)
(13)

Upper bounds for the terms kφσ ∗uk2p;wX and kφσ ∗Dα uk2p;wX from (12)-(13) can be obtained
by using the generalized Young’s inequality from Appendix A and the assumption kφk1 = 1
from (A)
kDα uk2p;wX kφσ ∗ uk2p;wX ≤ kDα uk2p;wX kuk2p;wX ,
kuk2p;wX kφσ ∗ Dα uk2p;wX ≤ kuk2p;wX kDα uk2p;wX .

(14)
(15)

Since u ∈ X by assumption the result follows.
Lemma 3.2. Suppose (A)-(B) hold then the mapping F : X × I → Y is continuous in σ
and continuously differentiable in u with Fréchet derivative
(Du F )(u,σ) U = ∆U + (1 − φσ ∗ u)U − u(φσ ∗ U).
Proof. For continuity in σ we just focus on continuity at σ = 0, the case σ > 0 is easily
checked. We have
kF (u, σ) − F (u, 0)kpY

= ku(φσ ∗ u − u)kpk,p;wY
X
≤
(kDα u(φσ ∗ u − u)kp;wX + ku(φσ ∗ Dα u − Dα u)kp;wX )p .
|α|≤k

Similar to the proof of Lemma 3.1, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality yields that
kDα u(φσ ∗ u − u)kp;wX ≤ kDα uk2p;wX kφσ ∗ u − uk2p;wX ,
ku(φσ ∗ Dα u − Dα u)kp;wX ≤ kuk2p;wX kφσ ∗ Dα u − Dα uk2p;wX .

(16)
(17)

Recall that there is strong convergence φσ ∗ v → v for v ∈ Lr (Rd ) with 1 ≤ r < ∞ [35, p.64]
as σ → 0; the proof can be adapted to yield strong convergence in Lr (Rd ; wX ) as shown in
Appendix A. Setting r = 2p yields that kF (u, σ) − F (u, 0)kY → 0 as σ → 0 which yields
continuity at σ = 0. Next, fix σ ∈ I and let u, v ∈ X then we obtain for continuity in u that
kF (u, σ) − F (v, σ)kY ≤ k∆(u − v)kY + ku − vkY + ku(φσ ∗ u) − v(φσ ∗ v)kY ,
7

where the first two terms in the right-hand side can be made small since X ⊂ Y . For the
last term a direct calculation shows that
ku(φσ ∗ u) − v(φσ ∗ v)kY ≤ k(u − v)(φσ ∗ u)kY + kv(φσ ∗ (u − v))kY ,
where both summands can be made small by using Cauchy-Schwarz and the generalized
Young inequality as in Lemma 3.1 which implies continuity in u. Calculating the Gâteaux
derivative in u yields
1
(∇u F )[U] = lim [F (u + ǫU, σ) − F (u, σ)] = ∆U − u(φσ ∗ U) + (1 − φσ ∗ u)U.
ǫ→0 ǫ
To show that the Gâteaux derivative coincides with the Fréchet derivative, i.e. ∇u F = Du F ,
we have to verify continuity of ∇u F in u [12, p.47]. We have
k(∇u F )[U] − (∇v F )[U]kY ≤ k(u − v)(φσ ∗ U)kY + k(φσ ∗ (u − v))UkY
and the same argument as for proving continuity of F in u can be applied.
Based on the proof it is now more evident why the construction of X is essentially
enforced by the nonlinear structure of the nonlocal FKPP equation. For example, for k = 0
and p = 2 the quadratic term u2 for σ = 0 indicates that the space L4 (Rd ; wX ) would be a
good choice. Observe also that one does not have to make the precise choice (B) to prove
Lemma 3.2. In fact, what is required is the weaker assumption that there exists a positive
constant K > 0, possibly dependent upon p and k, such that
kukk,p;wY ≤ Kkukk,p;wX

(18)

for a choice of weights for which Young’s inequality still holds. Hence the key parts for
continuity and differentiability properties of F in Lemma 3.2 do not depend upon the concrete
choice (10) but only on constructing an intersection of weighted Sobolev spaces for X adapted
to the nonlinearity with sufficiently ’nice’ weights.

4

The Implicit Function Theorem

The next goal is to apply the implicit function theorem; see [12, p. 148] for a detailed
statement. In particular, we want to consider neighborhoods of (u, σ) = (1, 0) and (u, σ) =
(0, 0). Since w ∈ L1 (Rd ) the non-zero constants belong to X. Substituting the stationary
solutions (u, σ) = (1, 0) and (u, σ) = (0, 0) into Lemma 3.2 yields:
Lemma 4.1. The linearized operators acting on U ∈ X with U = U(x), x ∈ Rd , are
L0 := (Du F )(0,0) U = ∆U + U,
L1 := (Du F )(1,0) U = ∆U − U.

For the one-dimensional case d = 1, one gets the ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
 ′
 ′
U = V,
U = V,
and
(ODE)1 :
(ODE)0 :
′
V ′ = U.
V = −U,
Clearly, (ODE)1 has a saddle-point at the origin and hence U ′′ − U = 0 has no other
bounded solutions except U ≡ 0. However, (ODE)0 has a center equilibrium with infinitely
many bounded non-zero periodic solutions. This indicates that L0 does not have the required
inverse to apply the implicit function theorem. Hence we are going to treat the neighborhood
of the zero branch u ≡ 0 separately in Section 5.
For L1 on Rd it is tempting to consider the Fourier transform
Z

T
û(ξ) :=
e−ix ξ u(x) dx,
ξ ∈ Rd ,
d/2
(2π)
Rd

where (·)T denotes the transpose and apply it to L1 U = 0. This yields
(1 + kξk2)Û (ξ) = 0,

(21)

where k · k denotes the Euclidean norm. From (21) it follows that Û = 0 which implies that
the nullspace of L1 only contains the zero solution. However, this calculation assumes that
u ∈ Lp (Rd ) for some suitable p, e.g. p = 1 or p = 2, whereas we have to work in weighted
spaces. To illustrate the problem, we consider the one-dimensional case which can be solved
explicitly. If d = 1 we have 0 = L1 U = U ′′ − U so that the general solution is
U(x) = c1 e−x + c2 ex

for constants c1 , c2 ∈ R.

If we would choose w(x) = e−x it follows that for constants α1 ∈ R, α2 ∈ (0, ∞), we also
have

in H 2 (R; e−x ) ∩ L4 (R; e−x ) which implies that L1 : X → Y is not invertible. For the case
w(x) = (1 + x2 )−1 it is straightforward to calculate that the integration

implies that U(x)w 1/2 (x) ∈ L2 (R) if and only if c1 = 0 = c2 . Therefore, L1 U = 0 on
H 2 (R; (1 + x2 )−1 ) ∩ L4 (R; (1 + x2 )−1 ) if and only if U ≡ 0 which implies that L1 has trivial
nullspace when w(x) = (1 + x2 )−1 is used. Hence, the choice of weight function is crucial if
we want to apply the implicit function theorem at the constant solution (u, σ) = (1, 0).
A natural strategy is to prove that L1 : X → Y has trivial nullspace for suitable classes
of wX , wY , p and then show that nullspace(L1 ) = {0} implies that L1 is invertible in a rather
large class of weighted spaces. For our choice of wX , wY , p given in (B) one may directly
use previous results.

Proof. Apply [24, Thm. 4.2, see p.58] which makes the argument based upon the Fourier
transform precise for the weighted spaces defined via (23); the result [24, Thm. 4.2, see p.58]
uses that the symbol in (21) has no zeros which is easily checked.
It is important to note that we would have to establish similar results as Proposition 4.2
for persistence results in other types of nonlocal PDEs again, as the linearized problem may
change. Therefore, we provide an outline in Appendix C how invertibility can be established
via a more direct approach.

The Zero Solution

As discussed in the previous section, one has to treat L0 separately. First, we apply Taylor’s
Theorem (in u) to F : X → Y , which yields
F (u, σ) = F (0, σ) + Du F(0,σ) u + R(u),

(24)

where the remainder R(u) satisfies R(u) = O(kuk2X ). Note that for the nonlocal FKPP
equation the remainder is exact and given by R(u) = −u(φσ ∗ u). However, we shall only
need the existence of a bound for the remainder when kukX is small; one may calculate this
bound efficiently also for other equations, not only FKPP, by using the Lagrange or integral
forms of the remainder (see e.g. [15, Ch.5]). Since we always have F (0, σ) = 0 it follows from
(24) that
F (u, σ) = Du F(0,σ) u + R(u) = ∆u + u + R(u).
(25)
Let Z := X ∩ L∞ (Rd ) with norm k · kZ = max{k · kX , k · k∞ } and observe that we may make
the last term in (25) small if u is in a neighborhood of u = 0 i.e. when kukZ is small. We start
by proving a one-dimensional result to illustrate, why it is expected that a change-of-sign
plays a role for solutions close to zero.
Proposition 5.1. Let d = 1 then there exists σ0 > 0 and a ball B ⊂ Z centered at u = 0
such that B × [0, σ0 ] does not contain any non-negative bounded classical solution u 6≡ 0,
u ∈ Cb2 , to F (u, σ) = 0.
Proof. Fix ǫ > 0. Consider any non-negative bounded classical solution (u, σ) ∈ B × (0, σ0 ]
with u 6≡ 0 and define η := φσ ∗ u then we obtain
F (u, σ) = u′′ + u(1 − η),

where |η(x)| < ǫ holds for all x ∈ R as kukZ can be made small; note that this step would
have worked with a general small remainder for a Taylor expansion. Considering F (u, σ) = 0
leads to the two-dimensional non-autonomous vector field

(x) = v(x),

(x) = −u(x)(1 − η(x)).

We argue by contradiction and suppose there exists a nonzero solution (u, v) to (26) such
that u(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R and there exists some x where u(x) > 0. We have the pointwise
estimate
− u(x)(1 + ǫ) < v ′ (x) < −u(x)(1 − ǫ)
(27)
for all x ∈ R. A phase plane analysis can now be carried out. Since u(x) > 0 for some x ∈ R
we may take this value as x = 0 without loss of generality and consider
(u(0), v(0)) ∈ {[0, ∞) × (−∞, ∞)} − {(0, 0)}.
Furthermore, if v(0) ≤ 0 then we immediately get that v(x) < 0 for some x > 0 close to
zero. If v(x) < 0 it follows that u will decay until we have u(x∗ ) < 0 for some x∗ > 0 which
yields a contradiction. Hence, we are left with the case v(0) > 0. However, if v(x) > 0 then
u increases so the estimate (27) can be applied to show that v has to cross {v = 0} into the
region where v(x) < 0. This finishes the proof.
The key ideas of the last proof are that we just look at solutions inside a small neighborhood of the origin (u, σ) = (0, 0) in X × I and that any nonzero solution u must change sign
for an equation which is controlled by solutions of
u′′ + u(1 ± ǫ) = 0.
To generalize this idea we briefly recall some classical theory for linear homogeneous partial
differential operators [29, 28] focusing just on the operator given by
Lα0 U := ∆U + (1 + α)U,

α ∈ R, |α| < ǫ

for sufficiently small fixed ǫ with 0 < ǫ < 1.
Remark: We are going to develop the following ideas in slightly more generality than strictly
necessary here to illustrate that the approach is applicable to a much broader class of problems.
A solution U = U(x) of Lα0 U = 0 is called an exponential solution if it is of the form
T

U(x) = f (x)eiξ x ,

for ξ ∈ Cd ,

(28)

where f is a polynomial. We say that a solution of the form (28) is a simple exponential
solution if f ≡ 1 and ξ 6= 0. Furthermore, we call a simple exponential solution purely
oscillatory if ξ ∈ Rd . The next result is a slightly modified version of [29, Thm. 7.3.6, p.185].
Proposition 5.2. The closed linear hull of simple exponential solutions to Lα0 U = 0 in the
space C ∞ (Rd ) yields all solutions to Lα0 U = 0 in C ∞ (Rd ).
Proof. To show that the closed linear hull of exponential solutions contains all solutions
follows verbatim from [29, Thm. 7.3.6] as Lα0 is a special case of the elliptic operators covered.
To restrict the class to simple exponential solutions, one observes that the symbol of Lα0 has
no multiple factors which makes the remark in [28, p.39] applicable such that f (x) ≡ 1 for
all exponential solutions. Since we restrict to nonzero solutions it follows that ξ 6= 0 can be
assumed as well since Lα0 U = 0 has no other constant solutions except U ≡ 0.
11

The next result is not necessary to prove the main result of this paper but it is very
interesting to understand the structure of solutions to Lα0 U = 0 in weighted spaces.
Proposition 5.3. Suppose (B) holds with weight function wX ∈ L1 (Rd ). Suppose Lα0 U = 0
and U is in the linear hull of simple exponential solutions. Then U ∈ X if and only if U is
in the linear hull of purely oscillatory solutions.
Proof. See Appendix B.
The next result, albeit straightforward, is a crucial observation to deal with solutions
near the point (u, σ) = (0, 0) in the proof of Theorem 2.1.
Lemma 5.4. There exists a purely oscillatory solution of Lα0 U = 0 such that U changes sign
i.e. there exist two points x− , x+ ∈ Rd such that U(x− ) < 0 and U(x+ ) > 0.
√
Proof. It is easy to see that U(x) = cos( 1 + αx1 ). In fact, there are many other trigonometric functions which would work as well.
The last proof also showed that Lα0 : X → Y is not invertible as it does have a non-trivial
nullspace; cf. Appendix C. The next step is to exclude the existence of non-negative bounded
solutions u 6≡ 0 for sufficiently small nonlocality near the special point (u, σ) = (0, 0) for
arbitrary dimension d.
Proposition 5.5. There exists σ0 > 0 and a ball B ⊂ Z centered at u = 0 such that
B × [0, σ0 ] does not contain any non-negative bounded classical solution u 6≡ 0, u ∈ Cb2 (Rd ),
to F (u, σ) = 0.
Proof. Fix ǫ > 0. Let u ∈ B and u 6≡ 0. If u ≥ 0 then it follows u(x) > 0 for all x ∈ Rd by
[7, Lem. 2.1]. We argue by contradiction and suppose that there exists a solution u(x) > 0
for all x ∈ Rd . In particular, this implies u(0) > 0. Observe that
0 = ∆u + u(1 − φσ ∗ u) ≥ ∆u + u(1 − ǫ)

(29)

holds with 0 < ǫ < 1 if kukL∞ < ǫ, which we can achieve by shrinking B. Define the
differential operator
Lǫ v := ∆v + v(1 − ǫ),
with 0 < ǫ < 1.

Now we choose a special radially symmetric oscillatory solution ūǫ with ūǫ (0) > 0 which, for
some δ3 > δ2 > δ1 > 0, obeys
ūǫ (x) > 0 for x ∈ {kxk < δ1 } ∪ {δ2 < kxk ≤ δ3 }

(30)

ūǫ (x) < 0 for x ∈ {δ1 < kxk < δ2 }.

(31)

ūǫ (x) > u(x) for x ∈ {δ2 + δ < kxk < δ3 },

(32)

and
To construct such a solution we may just take the solution from the proof Lemma 5.4 for
dimension d = 1. For d ≥ 2, we note that Lǫ v = 0 is just Helmholtz’s equation and a suitable
radial solution is given by scaled hyperspherical Bessel functions; see e.g. [19]. We may scale
the solution ūǫ by a positive constant, say κ > 0, and still denote it ūǫ , such that

12

for some small constant δ > 0, and a suitable δ3 such that δ2 + δ < δ3 and the conditions
(30)-(31) still hold. By making κ > 0 sufficiently large and using smoothness of u and ūǫ it
follows that the mapping (u − ūǫ ) : Rd → R has constant rank one for x ∈ {δ2 < kxk < δ3 }.
Now the constant-rank level set theorem [33, Thm 8.8] and smoothness of u and ūǫ yield the
existence of a closed embedded (d − 1)-dimensional manifold Γ, which consists of the zeros
of u − ūǫ in {δ2 < kxk < δ2 + δ}, i.e., u(x) = ūǫ (x) for x ∈ Γ. In fact, Γ is smooth [33, Thm
8.2].
Furthermore, consider an arbitrary nonzero unit length vector v ∈ Rd and the function
ρ(λ) := (u − ūǫ )(λv) for λ ∈ (δ2 , δ2 + δ). By continuity, there exists a point p = λv ∈ Γ such
that ρ(p) = 0. Upon making δ > 0 sufficiently small, and increasing κ > 0 if necessary, it
follows that there exists a unique such point p. Hence, it follows that Γ is smooth manifold,
which is topologically a sphere. Let Ω denote the bounded domain with boundary ∂Ω = Γ
inside the topological sphere Γ, i.e.,
[
{λv : λ ∈ [0, 1]}.
Ω :=
v∈Γ

Using (29) we apply the comparison principle [45, Thm. 2.2.4] to Lǫ for the domain Ω, which
implies
u(x) ≥ ūǫ (x)
(33)
for all x ∈ Ω. However, we can scale ūǫ by a positive constant so that ūǫ (x) > u(x) for some
x ∈ {kxk < δ1 }. This contradiction to (33) concludes the proof.
In the next proposition, we strengthen the conclusion of Proposition 5.5 to a ball in X.
Proposition 5.6. There exists σ0 > 0 and a ball B ⊂ X centered at u = 0 such that
B × [0, σ0 ] does not contain any non-negative bounded classical solution u 6≡ 0, u ∈ Cb2 (Rd ),
to F (u, σ) = 0.
Proof. Observe that to establish (29) in Proposition 5.5 we needed the bound 0 < kuk∞ <
ǫ < 1. Note that we may not have this uniform L∞ -bound on u for u ∈ B ⊂ X, where B is a
small ball centered at u = 0. However, by making B small enough and using the assumption
that u ∈ Cb2 , there exists a ball
B(2δ) := {x ∈ Rd : kxk ≤ 2δ} ⊂ Rd

for some δ > 0 such that for a given fixed constant ǫ ∈ (0, 1)
δ > δ3

1
and u(x) < ǫ for x ∈ B(2δ).
3

Indeed, suppose B(2δ) does not exist, then there exists an open bounded set M ⊂ Rd of
positive volume such that u(x) ≥ 13 ǫ for all x ∈ M. In this case, we can make B smaller to
obtain a contradiction. This implies that all sets M such that u(x) ≥ 13 ǫ for x ∈ M can be
assumed to exist only outside the ball B(2δ). Hence we deduce that
Z

where the first term on the right can be made small if x ∈ B(δ) and σ > 0 is sufficiently small;
in particular, we can make it smaller than 32 ǫ since for x ∈ B(δ) and σ small, the function
φσ (x − y) is concentrated near ∂B(δ) and u(x) ≤ 31 ǫ for x near ∂B as u ∈ Cb2 . Therefore, the
inequality (29) holds on B(δ). Now we can repeat the argument from Proposition 5.5 as all
relevant sets are contained in B(δ).
We could have proved Proposition 5.5 slightly quicker and bypassed some of the preliminary discussion of the oscillatory solution space. However, it is important to point out
the structure of special points. In particular, the linearized problem Du F(0,0) u = 0, and a
suitable small perturbation of it, only contain solutions outside of the class we are interested
in (’bounded non-negative classical solutions’). This observation facilitates the comparison
approach and is a much more general strategy applicable to problems beyond the FKPP
equation.

Proof of the Main Result

Recall that we try to establish that the only bounded non-negative classical solutions to the
nonlocal FKPP equation for small nonlocality are u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1.
Proof. (of Theorem 2.1) By Proposition 4.2 and the implicit function theorem applied to
F : X ×I → Y at (u, σ) = (1, 0) it follows that there exist balls B(1, r1 ) ⊂ X and B(0, r0 ) ⊂ I
with some radii r0,1 > 0 and exactly one continuous map T : B(0, r0 ) → B(1, r1 ) such that
T (0) = 1

and

F (T (σ), σ) = 0 on B(0, r0 ).

Since F (1, σ) = 0 gives a solution branch u ≡ 1 the uniqueness of T implies that T (σ) ≡ 1
for σ ∈ B(0, r0 ). Hence, in a sufficiently small neighborhood N1 of (u, σ) = (1, 0) only the
homogeneous solution u ≡ 1 exists.
In a neighborhood N0 of (u, σ) = (0, 0) we may apply Proposition 5.6 to conclude that
the only branch of bounded non-negative classical solutions to F (u, σ) = 0 is given by u ≡ 0.
Hence it remains to consider the possibility of solutions outside of neighborhoods of the two
trivial solution branches.
We argue by contradiction. Suppose there exists a sequence of bounded non-negative
solutions (uj , σj ) such that
(uj , σj ) ∈ X × I − (N0 ∪ N1 ),

0 ≤ kuj kCb2 ≤ K,

for all j ∈ N,

and we have
F (uj , σj ) = 0,

σj → 0 as j → ∞.

Note that the sequence {uj } is bounded in X1 = W k+2,p(Rd ; wX ) for k = 0 and p = 2,
i.e., in X1 = H 2 (Rd ; wX ). Due to the theory of weighted Sobolev spaces and their associated compact embeddings [27, Prop. 2.5] we have that the embedding W k+2,2 (Rd ; wX ) ֒→
W k+1,2(Rd ; wX ) is compact. It follows, upon passing to a subsequence, uj → u∞ for some
u∞ ∈ X̃1 := H 1 (Rd ; wX ). By continuity of F from Lemma 3.2, it follows that u∞ is a weak
solution to the local problem
F (u, 0) = 0
14

i.e. for any test function ψ ∈ Cc∞ (Rd ) we have
−

Furthermore, u∞ ≥ 0 almost everywhere as uj (x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ Rd , j ∈ N. By elliptic
regularity we can obtain that u∞ ∈ C 2 (Rd ). Therefore, the pair (u∞ , 0) ∈ X × I − (N0 ∪ N1 )
yields a non-negative solution to the local FKPP equation, which does not coincide with the
two constant solutions. This contradicts Lemma 2.3 and the main result follows.

Outlook

From the details of the proof in Section 6 it is already evident that we have not shown
the strongest possible result that our methods allow. For example, Theorem 2.2 for σ = 0
holds for a much wider class of equations beyond the local FKPP equation. Also standard
results about the Laplacian, which we used, do hold for much more general general elliptic
operators. Hence one could rephrase our main theorem for certain nonlocal PDEs of the
form
0 = Au + f (u, φσ ∗ u),
x ∈ Rd , u = u(x),
(34)
where A is a suitable generalization of the Laplacian and f is sufficiently smooth function
which generalizes f (u, φσ ∗u) = u(1−φσ ∗u). However, it seemed more accessible to illustrate
the overall strategy on an example first. The generalization will be considered in future work.
We briefly point out how the steps (S1)-(S5) described in Section 2 have to be modified in
an attempt to obtain results for (34) or even more general persistence theorems for solutions
of nonlocal problems. The step (S1) should always be the starting point for a local perturbation argument. In particular, the relevant solution spaces should be fully understood for
the local problem. (S2) is based upon a suitable choice of function spaces which are adapted
to the nonlinearity of the problem and to obtain continuity of the solution mapping. For
example, it may be necessary to use other types of intersections of two or more weighted
Sobolev spaces. Based upon the well-chosen construction of the spaces in (S2) the application of the implicit function theorem at regular points makes (S3) a relatively standard
step. Nevertheless, if there are no previous results available for the invertibility of the class
of linear operators under consideration, then a direct argument to show invertibility is often
highly nontrivial; see Appendix C. If special points occur then one has to find a modification
of – or alternative to – the step (S4). For our case, the key idea is that the linearized problem
at the special point, as well as a small perturbation of this linear problem, do not contain
any non-negative bounded solutions we are interested in. Hence we have been able to use a
comparison argument to exclude the existence of a certain class of solutions near the special
point. The step (S5) requires a good understanding of the local problem and is expected to
be quite standard for most problems.
As the last remark, we stress again that the assumption of a sufficiently small nonlocality
is crucial. On bounded domains it is well-known that the stationary solution u ≡ 1 of
the nonlocal FKPP equation may bifurcate into other bounded non-negative solutions for
15

suitably large nonlocality [22]. The same result is likely to be true for the unbounded domain
case. In fact, numerical simulations [7, Fig.1] naturally lead to the conjecture that the state
u ≡ 1 may undergo a (’supercritical Hopf-type’) bifurcation with an exchange of stability to
oscillations. It is important future work to investigate this bifurcation point in more detail
as the numerical simulations [7, Fig.1] also show that the associated traveling wave between
u ≡ 0 and u ≡ 1 changes from an equilibrium-to-equilibrium (E-to-E) heteroclinic front to
an equilibrium-to-periodic (E-to-P) heteroclinic front. In fact, very recently the existence
of oscillatory bounded solutions for sufficiently large nonlocality has been proven [26] in the
one-dimensional case. Furthermore, we also refer to recent work on a similar problem in a
related nonlocal reaction-diffusion system [41].

A

Convolutions in Weighted Spaces

For convenience we record here a few facts about convolution operators on weighted spaces.
A standard result is the following:
Theorem A.1. (Generalized Young’s Inequality, [21, p.13]) Let (S, µ) be a sigma-finite
measure space, and let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and C > 0. Suppose κ(x, y) is a measurable function on
S × S such that
R
|κ(x, y)| dµ(y) ≤ C
for all x ∈ S,
RS
|κ(x, y)| dµ(x) ≤ C
for all y ∈ S,
S

and suppose f ∈ Lp (S). Then the function
Z
T f (x) :=
κ(x, y)f (y) dµ(y)
S

is well-defined almost everywhere and T f ∈ Lp (S). Furthermore, we have the estimate
kT f kp ≤ Ckf kp .
We can apply the generalized Young’s inequality to the space
1
S = Rd ,
dµ(x) := w(x)dx, w(x) =
(1 + kxk2 )l

(35)

for 21 < l < ∞ as discussed in Section 3. Furthermore, suppose we only assume that
φ ∈ L1 (Rd ) (i.e. it may not be normalized to kφk = 1) and set
1 x
κ(x, y) := φσ (x − y),
where φσ (x) = d φ

Remark: Note that we crucially use here that our choice of weight is quite ’tame’ in the sense
that it is absolutely continuous with respect to standard Lebesgue measure. Singular and/or
growing weight functions would present a problem which would have to be compensated by
additional regularity assumptions on the kernel φ.
Hence, we may take C = 1 = kφk1 in Theorem A.1 and the previous discussion to obtain
a weighted version of the more standard Young’s inequality.
Proposition A.2. (Young’s inequality, see also [21, p.14]) If φ ∈ L1 (Rd ) and f ∈ Lp (Rd ; wX )
for 1 ≤ p < ∞ then f ∗ φσ ∈ Lp (Rd ; wX ) and
kf ∗ φσ kp;wX ≤ kφk1 kf kp;wX .
Proof. Note that φ ∈ L1 (Rd ) implies that φσ ∈ L1 (Rd ; wX ) for each σ > 0. Thus, applying
Theorem A.1 and the calculation (36) yield the result.
Theorem A.3. ([35, p.64]) Let φ ∈ L1 (Rd ) with kφk = 1. Let f ∈ Lp (Rd , wX ) for some
p ∈ [1, ∞) then φσ ∗ f → f in Lp (Rd ; wX ) for σ → 0.
Proof. The proof from [35, p.65-66] applies verbatim as we have a weighted version of Young’s
inequality given in Proposition A.2 for our choice of weight function wX in (10).
It is clear that Proposition A.2 and Theorem A.3 would also hold true for more general
classes of weight functions which include as a subset the family wX , parametrized by the
choice of l.

B

Purely Oscillatory Solutions

In this section we provide a proof of the result stated in Proposition 5.3 which we re-state
here for convenience:
Proposition B.1. Suppose (B) holds with weight function wX ∈ L1 (Rd ). Suppose Lα0 U = 0
and U is in the linear hull of simple exponential solutions. Then U ∈ X if and only if U is
in the linear hull of purely oscillatory solutions.
Proof. If U is in the linear hull of purely oscillatory solutions it easily follows that U ∈ X by
using the global boundedness of a finite sum of sines and cosines together with the polynomial
weight function wX . Therefore, it remains to show the converse.
Suppose U ∈ X and Lα0 U = 0. Then elliptic regularity [28, Cor. 11.4.13] implies that
U ∈ C ∞ (Rd ); in fact, U is even real analytic. Proposition 5.2 yields that U can be expressed
as a linear combination of exponential solutions
U(x) =

K
X

T

ak eiξk x

(37)

k=1

for some ak ∈ C, a natural number K > 0, ξk ∈ Cd are distinct vectors and the series
converges pointwise for each x ∈ Rd . Note that the sum (37) has a finite number of terms
17

since we assumed that U is in the linear hull and we do not have to take a closure. A solution
is purely oscillatory if ξk ∈ Rd for all k ∈ N. We argue by contradiction and suppose there
exists at least one vector ξk 6∈ Rd . Define the following set of indices
K := {k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} : ξk 6∈ Rd }
and denote a maximum growth or decay exponent index pair by (k ∗ , l∗ ), i.e., |Im((ξk∗ )l∗ )| ≥
|Im((ξk )l )| for all k ∈ K and l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , d}. As a first case, suppose that the pair (k ∗ , l∗ )
is unique.
Without loss of generality we are going to assume that Im(ξk∗ )l∗ > 0 since a coordinate
transformation of the form xl∗ 7→ −xl∗ is going to cover the case when Im(ξk∗ )l∗ < 0.
Furthermore, we may assume without loss of generality that l∗ = 1, respectively k ∗ = 1,
since a permutation of the coordinate indices, respectively the summands, can always be
applied. Let (ξ1 )1 = µ − λi with λ > 0, µ ∈ R and focus on a summand of U(x) given by
T

a1 eiξ1 x = a1 eλx1 eµix1 ei((ξ1 )2 x2 +···+(ξ1 )d xd ) =: a1 eλx1 s(x).
Observe that dim({x ∈ Rd : s(x) = 0}) ≤ d − 1 as the zero set consists of the zeros of a
product of trigonometric functions. Fix some δ > 0 and use the last observation and the
fact that limx1 →∞ eλx1 /wX (x) = +∞ to conclude the existence of a sequence of disjoint balls
B(ym , δ) with centers ym ∈ Rd , kym k → ∞, and radius δ such that

Note that the lower bound 1 is just chosen for convenience and any other fixed positive
constant would work as well. As a last step, we shall show that U 6∈ Lp (Rd ; wX ) for 1 ≤ p <
∞. We have
p

Therefore, it clearly follows that U 6∈ X as X ⊂ Lp (Rd , wX ). This concludes the case when
the maximum growth or decay exponent index pair by (k ∗ , l∗ ) is unique.
When (k ∗ , l∗ ) is not unique, we have a finite number of index pairs which could be maximal
and two cases may occur. First, if k ∗ is unique then we may have dominating terms with
exponentials of the form ak∗ exp(−λx1 +λxl )(· · · ) for some l ∈ {2, 3, . . . , d}. The construction
of the balls in (38) still works as the linear subspace {x ∈ Rd : x1 = xl } has dimension d − 1
i.e. we can always arrange the balls B(ym , δ) such that {x ∈ Rd : x1 = xl } ∩ B(ym , δ) = {}.
If k ∗ is not unique, a similar argument applies.
T
T
If the sum (37) has terms of the form ak eiξk x + aj eiξj x , where aj = ak and ξj = ξk 6∈ Rd
are complex conjugates (as the function U has to be real-valued), then the first term leads to
ak eλxl (· · · ) while the second term contributes ak e−λxl (· · · ) for some coordinate xl . Suppose
18

without loss of generality that λ > 0 then we may always choose xl sufficiently large, and
avoid the zeros of the multiplying trigonometric factors, to construct balls as above.
If there are terms of the form eλx1 +iax2 +··· − eλx1 +ibx2 +··· with λ, a, b ∈ R then there is
the possibility of cancellations. However, since we know that the vectors ξk are distinct, we
may assume that a 6= b. Hence, we have terms of the form eλx1 sa (x) − eλx1 sb (x), where the
zero sets of the trigonometric functions sa and sb each have dimension d − 1. In particular,
the sets where eλx1 sa (x) and −eλx1 sb (x) are both positive have full dimension d and repeat
periodically due to the periodicity of the trigonometric prefactors sa and sb .
Indeed, the same arguments apply to all cases where the growth and decay indices are
not unique, since K is finite and the ξk are distinct vectors, we can always construct the
balls B(ym , δ) to make the polynomially weighted Lp -norm of U arbitrarily large with a finite
number of balls. Hence we may conclude that ξk ∈ Rd for all k if U ∈ X.
The next step is to generalize Proposition B.1 to the case of the closure of the linear hull
of exponential solutions. Although the next statement looks quite natural, it does not seem
easy to prove so we leave it here as a conjecture for future work.
Conjecture B.2. Proposition B.1 holds when the linear hull is replaced by its closure.
The problem in generalizing the proof to the closure of the linear hull is that one has to
take care of potential intricate cancellation effects in the infinite series involved, as well as
dealing with zeros of infinite sums of trigonometric functions.

C

Invertibility - A Direct Proof

Recall that we have used in Proposition 4.2 a particular choice of weights wX , wY and
exponent p = 2 to use a known result about invertibility of the linear operator
L1 : X → Y,

L1 U = ∆U − U,

where X and Y are chosen as
X = W k+2,p (Rd ; wX ) ∩ W k,2p (Rd ; wX )

and

Y = W k,p (Rd ; wY )

(39)

for some k ∈ N0 and the norm on X is given by
kukX = max{kukk+2,p;wX , kukk,2p;wX }.
Here we sketch the main arguments how a more direct proof of invertibility could be carried
out. The basic assumption is that the positive weight functions wX , wY ∈ L1 (Rd ) are chosen
such that L1 is a well-defined linear operator and 1 < p < ∞. If we restrict the class of
weight function to exclude exponential growth then we obtain a trivial nullspace for L1 .
Lemma C.1. There exist weight functions wX , wY ∈ L1 (Rd ) such that the following statement holds: L1 U = 0 for U ∈ X if and only if U ≡ 0.

19

Proof. (Sketch of an alternative to Proposition 4.2) We argue by contradiction and suppose
we may find a nonzero solution U. The idea of the proof is similar to the proof of Proposition
5.2. By a result on homogeneous linear PDE [28, Thm 10.5.1,p.39] we may write any solution
of ∆U − U = 0 in X, for any choice of w ∈ L1 (Rd ), by a limit of basic exponential solutions,
U(x) =

∞
X

T

fk (x)eiξk x ,

j=1

where the sequences fk (x) are polynomials and ξk ∈ Cd are vectors. If there exists a component of ξk with nonzero imaginary part then U(x) does have a component behaving like e−x
or ex and we have seen in Section 4, as well as Appendix B, that we may choose a weight
function with polynomial decay as kxk → ∞ so that U 6∈ X. Hence, it follows that ξk ∈ Rd .
If fk (x) is a non-constant polynomial for some k, then we may choose a positive weight
function w ∈ L1 (Rd ) such that |fk (x)|p w(x) → +∞ as kxk → ∞. In this case, if follows
that U 6∈ X. Therefore, fk (x) = ak for some constants ak and the possible solutions are all
purely oscillatory or homogeneous. Obviously we may assume for each fixed k that ξk1 6= ξk2
for k1 6= k2 . Applying the differential operator to U yields
0 = (L1 U)(x) =

∞
X
j=1

T

ak (−kξk k2 − 1)eiξk x .

(40)

Since ξk1 6= ξk2 for k1 6= k2 it follows from (40) that ak (kξk k2 + 1) = 0 for all k ∈ N. Thus,
we get that that ak = 0 for all k. Therefore, it follows that U ≡ 0 providing the required
contradiction.
It is important to note that the last proof does not employ the particular choice (B)
given in (10) for the weight functions and the Sobolev space exponent. Weight functions
with rather general polynomial growth and p ∈ (1, ∞) suffice not only to prove Lemma C.1
but also to establish continuity and differentiability properties of F as long as (18) holds; see
also Section 3. Based on the knowledge of the nullspace we may now proceed to investigate
invertibility.
Lemma C.2. There exists a weight function w ∈ L1 (Rd ) such that L1 : X → Y is invertible.
Proof. (Sketch of an alternative to Proposition 4.2) For the proof we shall need as auxiliary
spaces the Hölder spaces C k+γ (Rd ) for k ∈ N0 and γ ∈ (0, 1) as defined in Section 3. By
Lemma C.1 we know that L1 U = 0 for U ∈ X implies that U ≡ 0. Since
kukX = max{kukk+2,p;w , kukk,2p;w } ≤ kukk+2,p;w + kukk,2p;w
≤ 2kukC k+2+γ (Rd )

1/ρ

max kwkL1(Rd )

ρ∈{p,2p}

it follows that C k+2+γ (Rd ) ⊂ X; see also [37]. Hence L1 U = 0 for U ∈ C k+2+γ (Rd ) implies
that U ≡ 0 so that L1 has trivial nullspace as an operator
L1 : C k+2+γ (Rd ) → C k+γ (Rd ).
20

Applying Mukhamadiev’s Theorem [38] it follows that L1 : C k+2+γ (Rd ) → C k+γ (Rd ) is
invertible. To show invertibility on X an approximation argument can be used similar to
the strategy in [37]. Let κ ∈ Cc∞ (Rd ) with kκkL1 (Rd ) = 1 and consider κǫ (x) = ǫ−d κ(x/ǫ) so
that kκǫ kL1 (Rd ) = kκkL1 (Rd ) . Let f ∈ Lp (Rd ; w) and define fǫ := κǫ ∗ f . Then a standard
analysis result ([35, p.64], see also Appendix A) implies that
fǫ ∈ C ∞ (Rd )

fǫ → f in Lp (Rd ; w).

and

Due to the invertibility of L1 : C k+2+γ (Rd ) → C k+γ (Rd ) it follows that the equation
L1 u = fǫ
has a unique solution uǫ ∈ C k+2+γ (Rd ) for each ǫ > 0. The desired result will follow if one
can show that uǫ converges to some function u0 ∈ X as ǫ → 0 but the convergence essentially
follows from a suitable coercivity estimate for the operator L1 as discussed in [37].
The main point of the last proof is that we have picked a more complicated weak solution
space X but the invertibility of the restricted operator onto Hölder space, in combination
with an approximation argument, can be used to yield invertibility for L1 : X → Y . Note
that one still has to make some restrictions on wX , wY , p but that no explicit choice is
necessary if a direct investigation of the linearized operator is considered.
