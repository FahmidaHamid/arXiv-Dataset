ABSTRACT
The time required to transcribe genes with long primary transcripts may limit their ability
to be expressed in cells with short mitotic cycles, a phenomenon termed intron delay. As such
30

short cycles are a hallmark of the earliest stages of insect development, we used Drosophila
developmental timecourse expression data to test whether intron delay affects gene expression
genome-wide, and to determine its consequences for the evolution of gene structure. We find that
long zygotically expressed, but not maternally deposited, genes show substantial delay in
expression relative to their shorter counterparts and that this delay persists over a substantial

35

portion of the ~24 hours of embryogenesis. Patterns of RNA-seq coverage from the 5! and 3!
ends of transcripts show that this delay is consistent with their inability to terminate
transcription, but not with transcriptional initiation-based regulatory control. Highly expressed
zygotic genes are subject to purifying selection to maintain compact transcribed regions,
allowing conservation of embryonic expression patterns across the Drosophila phylogeny. We

40

propose that intron delay is an underappreciated physical mechanism affecting both patterns of
expression as well as gene structure of many genes across Drosophila.

AUTHOR SUMMARY
45

The transcription of genes with long introns can take minutes to hours and must finish
before cells divide, since incomplete transcripts are targeted for degradation. It is known that
some cell division cycles, such as those involved in early insect embryogenesis, can occur in
under 10 minutes, potentially limiting the expression of long genes. We explored patterns of
expression of genes in Drosophila melanogaster over the course of embryogenesis and found

50

that long, but not short genes are indeed prevented from being expressed early in development.
Furthermore, these long transcripts require several hours to reach stable levels of expression,
revealing an underappreciated mechanism, intron delay, which limits the production of long
transcripts over approximately half of fly embryogenesis. Additional data confirmed that this
pattern cannot be explained by delayed transcriptional activation. We also show that this pattern

55

is conserved across millions of years of evolution, and found evidence that short genes that are
able to escape delayed expression are under substantial pressure to maintain their compact
lengths. Therefore intron delay also appears to be a source of significant evolutionary constraint
on how gene structures can evolve.

INTRODUCTION
60

The expression of genes with long primary transcripts is likely to impose significant
organismal costs, as the time required to transcribe through long introns is non-trivial [1], [2]. As
an extreme example, the largest known gene, human dystrophin, requires ~16 hours for the
transcription of its ~2.3 Mb primary transcript. This precludes its ability to be rapidly induced by
purely transcriptional means [3]. At the level of the transcriptome, the burden of transcriptional

65

time has manifested itself in the observation that genes with expression patterns that change
rapidly in response to stress have significantly lower intron densities as compared to the genomic
average [4]. Similarly, transcriptional time has also been shown to limit expression of genes with
long primary transcripts in cells undergoing rapid mitotic cycles, a phenomenon termed ‘intron
delay’ [1].

70

A variety of studies have shown that transcription from all three RNA polymerases
ceases once cells leave interphase and enter mitotic divisions [5]. Though the precise
mechanisms of this repression remain poorly understood, an important component involves lack
of access of the polymerase to condensing chromatin. As the mitotic cycle begins, incomplete
transcripts are released from the condensing chromosomes and are subsequently degraded by an

75

unidentified nuclear mechanism. These transcripts remain undetectable until the completion of
mitosis [6]. Accordingly, strong selection is hypothesized to exist against the expansion of
existing introns (or the introduction of new introns) in genes that must be expressed in cells
undergoing frequent mitoses. This is supported by the observation that single-celled eukaryotes
with rapid reproductive rates, such as yeasts and Guillardia, have very intron-poor genomes

80

despite having descended from more intron-rich ancestors [7], [8].

4

In metazoans, certain cell types and/or developmental stages have mitotic cycles rapid
enough to limit the expression of long genes. For example, in flies the earliest stages of
development are characterized by rapid mitotic cycles as short as 8.6 minutes per division [9]. It
is during this period of development that transcription of the zygotic genome begins, a process
85

known as zygotic genome activation. Most insects achieve these rapid mitotic cycles by avoiding
cytokinesis altogether and generating nuclei within a common embryonic cytoplasm known as a
syncytial blastoderm [10]. In Drosophila, the zygotic nucleus undergoes 13 synchronous mitotic
divisions, the first 9 requiring approximately 9 min each, while cycles 10-13 progressively
lengthen to a maximum of 17 min per division [9]. Subsequently, the nuclei undergo a ~60 min

90

extended 14th mitotic cycle during which cellularization takes place [11], [12]. While the
majority of zygotic transcription is delayed until the extended 14th stage, it has been shown that
some genes are transcribed during the mitotic divisions. Indeed, one gene with a primary
transcript length exceeding 20 kb produced aborted transcripts during these early cycles that
were not exported from the nucleus and degraded gradually, supporting the predictions of the

95

intron delay hypothesis [6], [13], [14].
Delayed expression of long transcripts may play a functional, regulatory role during early
development [1], [2]. For instance, the early stages of embryogenesis in Drosophila involve
sequential activation of very short pair-rule genes followed by significantly longer homeodomain
box (HOX) genes [1]. A regulatory mechanism based solely on physical constraint is appealing

100

as it allows for a simple sequential process of activation during early development as cell cycles
lengthen, without the need to invoke more complex temporal regulatory networks [15].
Furthermore, it could also regulate spatial patterning of gene expression during later periods of

5

embryogenesis, when the embryo is partitioned into discrete mitotic domains, the cells of which
may replicate at increased rates via endocycling [16], [17].
105

We show that early developmental intron delay of zygotically expressed genes is a
general feature of the fruit fly transcriptome, limiting the expression levels of long transcripts
well into embryogenesis. Furthermore, we confirm that the expression patterns observed are not
simply due to regulation of transcription initiation. Finally, we extend our observations across
the Drosophila phylogeny and show that intron delay may impose significant selective pressure

110

to maintain compact primary transcripts among highly expressed zygotic genes.

RESULTS
Long zygotic transcripts show delayed activation during D. melanogaster embryogenesis
In order to explore the relationship between transcript length and patterns of expression
115

over the course of embryonic development of D. melanogaster, we obtained data from two
RNA-Seq timecourses generated from poly-A selected RNA: 1) the MODel organism
ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (modENCODE) D. melanogaster developmental timecourse
[18], which consists of 12 sequential two hour time-synchronized developmental time points
spanning the ~24 hour period of fly embryogenesis (hereafter the ‘embryonic’ time course), and

120

2) the dataset of Lott et al. [19], which consists of single embryo samples spanning syncytial
cycles 10 to 13 and four time points spanning the extended 14th cycle (labeled A-D) (hereafter
the ‘syncytial’ time course). The entire syncytial timecourse takes place during the first and
second time points of the embryonic timecourse [20] (Figure 1). Expression at the gene level was
calculated in Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (RPKM) (see Methods) (Table S1

125

contains all analyzed data). Complete zygotic genome activation does not begin until ~80 min
post egg laying (hereafter, all times are indicated as post egg laying), and thus most mRNA
present in the embryo prior to this time is maternally deposited. Most maternal transcripts are
eliminated by ~180 min, prior to which time the zygote contains both maternal and zygotic
transcripts [21]. In order to analyze transcripts derived from maternal or zygotic origins

130

separately, we used the classifications provided by Tadros et al. [22], resulting in classifications
of either ‘maternal’ or ‘zygotic’ for 7,452 genes expressed in the embryonic timecourse, and
5,644 genes in the syncytial timecourse (note that the classifications refers only to the origin of
these transcripts in the embryo; once maternally deposited transcripts are eliminated, all
embryonic transcripts are produced from the zygotic genome).

7

135

The intron delay hypothesis predicts that the short mitotic cycles occurring during early
fly embryogenesis will not allow sufficient time for the transcription of long transcripts.
Therefore, we investigated the relationship between primary transcript length and expression by
binning genes in both timecourses into two categories: those with ‘short’ transcripts < 5
kilobases in length and ‘long’ transcripts ≥ 5 kb (Table 1) (see Methods). We found that zygotic

140

transcripts are significantly shorter than those maternally deposited (embryonic timecourse
median lengths with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals were 2,287 ± 100 and 3,175 ± 109
bp respectively; Kruskal-Wallis p < 2.2 × 10-16; data are qualitatively similar for the syncytial
timecourse). Consistent with this, there is a significant over-representation of intronless zygotic
genes in the syncytial timecourse (11.1% vs. 7.8% for zygotic and maternal genes, respectively;

145

χ2 = 11.36, 1 degree of freedom [df], p = 0.0008), but not in the embryonic timecourse (8.5 vs.
7.5% for zygotic and maternal genes, respectively; χ2 = 1.84, 1 df, p = 0.175), suggesting that
introns are underrepresented only in zygotic genes expressed during the earliest stages of
development, and not among all zygotic genes.
The intron delay hypothesis also predicts that the difference in expression level between

150

short and long genes should be largest during the earliest stages of development and decrease as
cell-cycle intervals lengthen during development. To test this, we performed linear regressions
on the median expression levels of the two length categories of zygotic and maternal genes
(which is not affected by the general tendency for higher expression of short genes [23], [24]).
Although the expression of both short and long zygotic genes increases during embryogenesis

155

(Figure 2A), the slope is twice as large for the long genes (m = 0.502 and 1.04, R2 = 0.870 and
0.858, p = 2.44 × 10-5 and 3.79 × 10-5 for short and long genes, respectively). Consistent with
this, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that the difference in expression between long

8

and short transcripts decreases over development (F3,8 = 30.3, p = 1.02 × 10-4) (these conclusions
remain robust to the removal of any single timepoint; data not shown). In contrast to zygotic
160

genes, maternal genes showed a completely different pattern (Figure 2B): short maternal
transcripts decrease in abundance (m = - 0.911, R2 = 0.903, p = 5.58 × 10-6), while long maternal
genes showed no significant pattern of change (m = 0.183, R2 = 0.368, p = 0.0862). This
indicates that the patterns observed among zygotic genes are not a general pattern related to
transcript length, but rather reflect the transcriptional dynamics of transcripts expressed from the

165

zygotic genome.
We observed the same general patterns in the syncytial timecourse (Figure 2C-D):
median expression levels of both zygotic size classes increased (m = 1.31 and 2.28, R2 = 0.905
and 0.968, p = 6.88 × 10-4 and = 2.61 × 10-5, for short and long genes respectively) and
ANCOVA again revealed that the difference in median expression levels between short and long

170

genes decreased over the timecourse (F3,4 =196.9, p = 8.47 × 10-5). In this case, both short and
long maternal transcripts showed a significant decrease in median expression level (slope = -1.03
and -0.789, R2 = 0.903 and 0.712, p = 5.58 × 10-6 and 0.0209, for short and long genes
respectively). Therefore, both data sets support the pattern predicted by the intron delay
hypothesis among genes expressed from the zygotic genome.

175

RNA-Seq coverage patterns are consistent with intron delay
Although the decreasing difference in median expression levels of short and long genes
during development is consistent with the intron delay hypothesis, it could also be explained by
differences in transcription initiation. However, we find no evidence of differential transcription
180

initiation between short and long zygotic genes based on ChIP-Seq profiles of well-studied

9

chromatin marks associated with transcriptional activation or repression over a comparable
embryonic timecourse [25] (Document S1, Figures S4-5).
A key prediction unique to intron delay is the presence of incomplete transcripts. This
could be tested by comparing RNA-Seq reads derived from the 5! vs. 3! ends of transcripts in
185

long vs. short genes, since aborted transcripts should often lack 3! ends. Furthermore, this ratio
would be expected to decrease over time as cell cycles lengthened, allowing complete
transcription of progressively longer zygotic transcripts [13]. Conversely, if the expression
patterns observed were entirely the result of a widespread delay in transcriptional initiation, a
relatively constant 5!:3! ratio would be expected over the course of embryonic development

190

(Figure 3A) (we discuss and reject a third mechanism, a kinetic model explaining the delay of
long genes, in Document S1).
In order to differentiate between these two possibilities, we obtained another
modENCODE RNA-Seq timecourse dataset consisting of non-poly-A selected (and therefore not
3! biased) RNA extracted from the same 12 time points as the embryonic timecourse [18] (see

195

Methods). We calculated RPKMs for the 5!-most 1 kb of exonic transcript as well as the 3!-most
1 kb of exonic transcript and plotted the medians of the 5!:3! ratios at each timepoint (Figure 3
B,C). Across the first six stages (0-12 h, during which zygotic activation takes place) (Document
S1), only long zygotic genes show a significant change, with the 5!:3! ratio decreasing over time
(triangles in Figure 3B: m = -0.162, R2 = 0.811, p = 0.00905; p > 0.05 for all other categories).

200

Extension of the regressions to all 12 time points results in a significant negative slope among all
four gene categories (p < 0.05); however long zygotic genes show a significantly steeper
negative slope than the other gene categories (ANCOVA, p < 0.001), as expected by predictions
of the intron delay hypothesis. Median levels of exonic coverage, normalized for overall gene

10

expression level, across the first 10 kb of transcript length show a more negative slope in zygotic
205

as compared to maternal genes during early embryogenesis, indicating that the patterns observed
in the 5!:3! ratio are not simply an artifact of analyzing only the ends of transcripts (Document
S1).

Intron delay is observed across the Drosophila phylogeny
210

Having identified a widespread role for intron delay in D. melanogaster, we sought to
determine if these patterns were shared in other species of fruit fly, and whether intron delay had
consequences for the evolution of gene structure or expression. We therefore analyzed a
microarray timecourse spanning two-hour intervals over the first 18 h of embryonic development
in six Drosophila species (hereafter the ‘species timecourse’) (Figure 1) [26]. We focused our

215

analysis on four species with high-quality annotations: D. melanogaster, D. ananassae (~12
million years [my] divergence time from D. melanogaster), D. pseudoobscura (~45 my), and D.
virilis (~63 my). Among the transcripts represented in the dataset, 2,067 genes were represented
in the other timecourses and had identifiable 1:1 orthologs among all four species [27] (see
Methods). Because significant changes in transcript lengths between species are likely to occur

220

via changes in intron lengths—and due to the difficulty in annotating untranslated regions in
these other species—we classified genes based on the length of orthologous introns within
orthologous genes (see Methods): genes in each species whose orthologous intron length was < 5
kb were classified as short, and those with intron length ≥ 5 kb were classified as long.
Analysis of the microarray data using the same methods as for the RNA-Seq data showed

225

parallel results in all four species: long zygotic genes increase significantly in expression level
over the timecourse (p < 0.001 in all cases) (Figure 4). Furthermore, the rate of increase in

11

expression level was significantly greater for long as compared to short zygotic genes in all four
species (ANCOVA: F3,5 p < 0.05). Conversely, no significant trend among the median expression
levels across time points was observed for short zygotic transcripts in any species after correction
230

for multiple tests. In contrast, short maternal transcripts showed a significant decrease in median
expression level in all species (p < 0.05) except in D. ananassae (p = 0.0661), while no
significant trend was observed over the timecourse among long maternal genes in any species.
Therefore, despite the lack of obvious differences among the functions of genes deposited
maternally vs. expressed zygotically (see Document S1), the high degree of concordance of

235

expression patterns among species suggests that the mode of delivery of these transcripts to the
embryonic transcriptome may be largely conserved across Drosophila.

Conservation of short introns in highly expressed zygotic genes
Our observation that transcripts with longer lengths are associated with delayed
240

embryonic expression led us to predict that zygotic genes that are highly expressed during early
embryogenesis across species should be subject to selection against intron expansion.
Consequently, highly expressed zygotic genes should be more conserved for short transcript
lengths than other gene categories. We tested this prediction by dividing genes based on their
expression levels in the first time point (0-2 h) of the species timecourse: zygotic genes in the

245

highest and lowest-expressed quartiles across all 4 species (‘high’ and ‘low expression zygotic’;
100 and 73 genes, respectively), as well as maternal genes in these same quartiles (‘high’ and
‘low expression maternal’; 142 and 189 genes, respectively). We then asked whether orthologous
intron lengths in any of the categories were more variable across the Drosophila phylogeny by
calculating the corrected coefficient of variation (CV*) of intron lengths for the four species (see

250

Methods) (Figure 5). The CV* values, as well as intron lengths, of highly expressed zygotic
12

genes are significantly lower than all other categories (p < 0.01) (Document S1, Figure S6). This
suggests that there exists significant constraint on the expansion of intron lengths among highly
expressed zygotic genes during early fly development.

DISCUSSION
255

Genome-wide Intron Delay in Drosophila
The results of our analysis indicate that intron delay plays a significant role in
determining patterns of expression in the early development of Drosophila: the production of
long transcripts is limited by the rapid syncytial divisions occurring during zygotic genome
activation. While a negative relationship between transcript length and expression level across a

260

wide variety of organisms has been noted for some time [23], [24], this cannot explain our
observation that in all three timecourses, the magnitude of the difference in expression level
between the two length categories of genes declines across development. Furthermore, our
observations are inconsistent with reduced transcriptional initiation limiting the transcription of
long zygotic transcripts as evidenced by the lack of explanatory patterns in well-studied

265

activating or repressive chromatin marks as well as the declining 5!:3! ratio of coverage over the
earliest embryonic stages among these genes. The larger proportion of reads being derived from
5! ends is consistent with an inability to complete transcription of long genes, leading to an
absence of 3!-derived reads (Figure 3A).
While intron delay clearly places an upper limit on the ability to express long zygotic

270

genes, the inability to complete transcription cannot be the sole factor limiting their early
expression because no zygotic transcripts are detected prior to syncytial cycle 4, irrespective of
their length [28]. Furthermore, experimental forced arrest of embryos in non-mitotic portions of
the cell cycle does not lead to full zygotic activation prior to syncytial cycle 10 [29]. Therefore, it
would appear that the earliest steps of zygotic activation require the action of genes involved in

275

pre- and post-translational processes, and are tightly linked to the programmed degradation of
maternal RNAs [30]. While the intron delay hypothesis originally focused on the earliest periods

14

of development, in both the RNA-Seq data (Figure 2A) and four-species microarray data (Figure
4) the expression of long zygotic genes continues to increase faster than short genes well into
embryogenesis (~12-18 h). This may be explained by the observation that after gastrulation,
280

large portions of the embryo form into mitotic domains [16] that begin amplifying their genomic
content via endocycling – replication of all or parts of the genome via a modified cell cycle that
bypasses mitosis as well as large portions of the gap phases to produce polyploid nuclei [17].
This modified cell cycle may be shortened, and therefore have the potential to physically limit
long zygotic transcripts from achieving maximal expression until mid-embryogenesis. This

285

hypothesis is also consistent with the sharp increase in 3! derived reads observed among nonpoly-A selected RNA-Seq data in the latter half of embryogenesis (Document S1, Figure S4).

Embryonic expression across Drosophila
At present we only have information on the maternally deposited transcriptome for D.
290

melanogaster. However when maternal and zygotic gene classifications from D. melanogaster
are applied to species up to 63 my diverged, patterns of embryonic expression remain
qualitatively similar (Figure 4). The consistent, significant differences observed in expression
patterns among short and long zygotic transcripts as well as maternal genes across the phylogeny
suggest that the origin of these transcripts within the developing embryo may be largely

295

conserved (see below).
As expected, early zygotic transcripts that are highly expressed across Drosophila are
significantly shorter than those that are expressed at low levels or maternally deposited (Figure
S6). It is interesting to note that while high early zygotic expression necessitates short primary
transcripts, the converse does not hold: the range of intron lengths spanned by genes with low

15

300

levels of expression (62 - 61,000 bp) is much greater than that spanned by highly expressed
genes (52 – 3,600 bp). Nevertheless, our observation that the introns of highly expressed early
zygotic genes have remained short across Drosophila species argues that the biological
requirement of maintaining high levels of expression during early development is a major
selective ‘force’ acting to maintain such conserved length. This is also supported by our

305

observation that none of the other transcript categories – lowly expressed zygotic or either
category of maternal transcripts – show significant differences in their variability across species
(Figure 5).

Maternal deposition vs. zygotic transcription
310

Weischaus [31] hypothesized that “[i]n organisms where embryonic development is rapid
and occurs with no increase in size before hatching from the egg, it will be advantageous to
maximize maternal contributions, because the duration of oogenesis is often much longer than
embryogenesis and the ovary provides a more sophisticated and efficient synthetic machinery.”
Despite the potential advantage of accelerated development, a significant fraction of the

315

transcripts expressed in the embryos of species that fit the predictions of the above model appear
to originate zygotically: 30-35% in D. melanogaster [22] and ~30% in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans [32]. One explanation for the retention of zygotic origin is that a
substantial fraction of these transcripts appears to require precise spatial localization [28]
(especially if their unintended presence is deleterious to development [31]), which may limit

320

their ability to transition to diffuse maternal deposition. In addition, short zygotically expressed
genes may derive little or no benefit from being maternally supplied, as we observe that they are
able to reach substantial levels of expression during early stages. Maternal deposition as

16

proposed above may therefore only be advantageous in the case of long genes, which could
bypass the expression constraints imposed upon them by intron delay. Supporting this
325

possibility, genes expressed during the embryonic timecourse whose processed mRNAs are ≥ 5
kb are significantly over-represented among maternal as compared to zygotic genes (567 versus
239, χ2 = 125.89, 1 d.f., p < 0.0001). Determining which transcripts are supplied maternally
versus expressed zygotically in sufficiently closely-related species would allow us to establish
whether transitions to maternal deposition are common, and whether such events favor particular

330

types of genes (e.g., those with long pre-processed transcripts).

Conclusion
Intron delay appears to play a significant, yet underappreciated, role in determining
patterns of expression beginning from the earliest moment of Drosophila embryogenesis, leading
335

to clear expectations that zygotic mRNAs derived from long primary transcripts may take several
hours after zygotic genome activation to reach full expression levels. This is an appealing
mechanism through which to delay expression of transcripts that require precise temporal
and spatial regulation of transcription until the necessary embryonic patterning gradients
are established [1]. At present, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that delayed expression of

340

long genes may also be under direct transcriptional control in addition to being subject to intron
delay; however, in the case of at least one pair of D. melanogaster genes, knirps and knrl, the
latter’s delayed expression can be explained entirely by its long length [13]. As we continue to
decipher the regulatory logic underlying transcription, we should be able to identify candidate
genes whose long introns could be experimentally deleted and assessed for similar elimination of

17

345

delay. Information gleaned from a sufficiently large sample of such genes will allow us to
determine to what degree intron delay is used as an active mechanism of temporal regulation.

MATERIALS & METHODS
RNA and ChIP-seq data
350

Mapped data from Gravely et al.’s [18] timecourse for each of the 12 time points
spanning embryogenesis were obtained from the ModENCODE Data Coordination Center
(http://www.modencode.org/; datasets modENCODE_2884 to modENCODE_2895). Counts of
all 15,233 annotated loci (excluding pseudogenes and microRNA precursors) with FlyBase gene
identification numbers (FBgns) in the FlyBase D. melanogaster genome annotation release 5.43

355

(FBr5.43) [27] were calculated using HTseq-count at the gene level with the ‘union’ option
(http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/index.html). Data were normalized by
conditional quantile normalization using the ‘cqn’ Bioconductor package in R version 2.14 [33]
and expression levels were output as RPKM. The raw RNA-Seq reads from (Lott et al. 2011)
were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) Gene

360

Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession GSE25180) and
mapped to the FlyBase D. melanogaster genome release 5 using Tophat 1.0.13 [34] with default
settings with the exception of a minimum intron length of 42 and retaining only uniquely
mapping reads. Sexed data for each stage were collapsed and counting, normalization, and
RPKM calculation were performed as for the Gravely et al. [18] dataset. In both datasets, we

365

required that a gene be expressed at RPKM > 5 during at least one stage in order to be
considered for analysis, leaving 10,454 loci in the Gravely et al. [18] dataset and 7,223 loci in the
Lott et al. [19] dataset (lowering the threshold of expression to RPKM > 2 had no effect on our
conclusions; data not shown).
We obtained the maternal and zygotic gene classifications of Tadros et al. [22] as

370

tabulated in NCBI GEO entry GSE8910. All loci represented on the microarray platform used in

19

the study (GPL1467) were converted to current FBgns using the FlyBase batch download tool.
Those loci that were no longer part of the current annotation were excluded, while instances
where multiple loci had been collapsed into a single locus in the current annotation were
inspected to determine whether all collapsed loci were originally classified into the same
375

category (i.e., maternal or zygotic). All cases where collapsed loci disagreed in terms of
classification were rejected, providing 9,078 loci in the FBr5.43 annotation classified as
maternally deposited or zygotically expressed, of which 7,452 (4,575 [61%] maternal/2,877
[39%] zygotic) were expressed in the Gravely et al. [18] dataset and 5,644 (4,151 [74%]
maternal/1,493 [26%] zygotic) were expressed in the Lott et al. [19] dataset.

380

For the analysis of the distribution of reads on the 5!and 3! ends of transcripts, we
obtained the non-poly-A selected embryonic timecourse RNA-Seq reads generated by a SOLiD
instrument (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) from the NCBI Short-read archive (SRA
Accession numbers: SRX015641 to SRX015652) [18]. Reads were mapped to the D.
melanogaster genome using the same methods as those applied to the syncytial timecourse of

385

Lott et al. [19]. Using a custom script, combined with HTseq-count at the locus level with the
‘union’ option, we counted the number of reads spanning the 5! and 3! 1 kb of each transcript
excluding any intronic sequence. Because non-poly-A selected RNA contains a mixture of both
processed and unprocessed pre-mRNAs we chose to look only at those sequence segments that
would be consistent between these two categories. As the segments analyzed were too short to

390

perform conditional quantile normalization as above, read counts were quantile normalized using
the R aroma.light package [35] and RPKMs calculated. We then calculated the 5!:3! ratio for
each transcript that a) was included as part of the embryonic timecourse (see criteria above), b)
had a transcript of at least 2 kb in length, c) had only a single TSS according to the FlyBase 5.43

20

annotation and d) did not overlap another transcript leaving 3,396 loci with 5!:3! ratios to
395

analyze.
Raw developmental timecourse ChIP-seq reads derived from antibodies to histone
modifications H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 [25] were obtained from GEO
(accession numbers to all datasets are found in Table S2). All reads were mapped uniquely to the
FlyBase D. melanogaster genome release 5 using Bowtie version 0.12.8 and allowing 2

400

mismatches [36]. Base-level coverage was assessed in 100 bp non-overlapping windows up to
one kb upstream of non-overlapping genes with a single annotated TSS. Coverage was
normalized between time points and chromatin marks by dividing by the total number of mapped
reads by 106.

405

Choice of ‘short’ and ‘long’ locus categories
In order to determine appropriate transcript length cutoffs to detect the potential effect of
intron delay, we first began by binning all loci in the FlyBase 5.43 annotation into increments of
5 kb (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20 kb, etc.). Visual inspection of the pattern of expression of the length
categories indicated an increasing degree of effect (i.e., progressively longer bins showed a more

410

pronounced reduction in expression during early vs. later stages of development; data not
shown). We then performed pairwise comparisons of the distributions of expression levels of the
individual bins during each of the time points and found that there were no significant
differences among those bins with loci > 5 kb in length (p > 0.05) whereas these same bins were
significantly different from those loci < 5 kb in length. Therefore we defined two length

415

categories, short (< 5kb) and long (≥ 5 kb), whose expression patterns were significantly
different from one another.

21

GO analysis
All maternal or zygotic loci considered significantly expressed in either the embryonic or
420

syncytial timecourses were analyzed for functional over- and under-representation using FatiGO
[37] on the Babelomics version 4.3 webserver at
(http://babelomics.bioinfo.cipf.es/functional.html). Gene lists were compared either to one
another or the whole FlyBase 5.43 annotation among GO biological process levels from three to
nine using two-tailed tests and retaining only p values < 0.05 when adjusted for multiple tests by

425

the software.

Four-species microarray data
We obtained the processed microarray data as described in Kalinka et al. [26] from
http://publications.mpi-cbg.de/getDocument.html?id=ff8080812c477bb6012c5fa1feaf0047. All
430

locus names were associated with D. melanogaster FlyBase FBgns. Loci from the Kalinka et al.
dataset, which was based on FlyBase annotation 5.14, that were not associated with unique
FBgns (either due to a locus having been split into multiple loci or multiple loci having collapsed
into a single locus in the FBr5.43 annotation used in this study) were removed from further
analysis. As two species, D. simulans and D. persimilis, were originally noted to have poor

435

genome sequencing coverage [38], we used the remaining FBgns to search for orthologs in D.
ananassae (FlyBase genome release 1.3, annotation release FB2011_07), D. pseudoobscura
(FlyBase genome release 2.27, annotation release FB2012_02), and D. virilis (FlyBase genome
release 1.2, annotation release FB2012_01) using the FlyBase batch download tool. Of the 3,146
loci mapping to a single ortholog in all three non-melanogaster species, 2,067 were represented

22

440

among the D. melanogaster zygotic and maternal loci annotated by Tadros et al. [22]. These loci
were retained for further analysis and were called maternal or zygotic based on the D.
melanogaster data. We used the average normalized, processed expression level among all
probes represented over time points 1-9 for each locus within a given species for analysis as data
was not available for all species for any subsequent time points.

445

Orthologous intron analysis
As the genome annotations of non-melanogaster species of Drosophila largely lack
untranslated regions as well as alternatively spliced isoforms that could lead to changes in
primary transcript length, we sought to compare only orthologous intronic segments. These
450

segments were identified using the software Common Introns Within Orthologous Genes
(CIWOG) [39] on the genome releases indicated above retaining only those segments that were
common among all four species analyzed. In order to compare variability in intron lengths, we
used the corrected coefficient of variation (CV*) [40], removing all single exon genes. It should
be noted that CV* is biased towards low values when mean intron lengths among species are <

455

150 bp (data not shown) as is the case with most introns in the highly expressed zygotic category
(Figure 5). Upon reanalyzing the data after removing all loci with mean intron length among
species < 150 bp, the only significant difference in CV* is observed among highly expressed
zygotic and low expressed maternal transcripts (p < 0.01). However, this serves to indicate that
the transcript length range tolerated by highly expressed zygotic loci during early development is

460

short and narrow relative to other locus categories.

General statistics

23

All statistics were performed using R version 2.14.0 [41]. Confidence intervals were
obtained by producing a normal approximation of 10,000 resampled subsets of the data using the
465

‘boot’ package in R [42]. Comparisons between distributions were performed using the permuted
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, with 10,000 permutations, as implemented in the ‘coin’ package in
R [43]. The p-values of all comparisons were Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests where
appropriate

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Correspondence between the three expression timecourses analyzed in this study:
Embryonic [18], species [26], and syncytial [19]. Both the embryonic and species timecourses
consist of pools of embryos collected at two hour intervals, spanning either 24 or 18 h of
Drosophila embryogenesis. The syncytial timecourse spans syncytial cycles 10 to 13, followed
by 4 collections during the extended 14th cycle corresponding roughly to 25% increments of cell
wall extension to completion of cellularization (indicated by A-D). The correspondence between
the syncytial timecourse and the other timecourses is indicated by the grey dotted line. The
hashed area indicates the period during which the rapid syncytial divisions take place (timing is
taken from [20]). The embryonic and syncytial timecourses were generated by RNA-Seq while
the species timecourse was generated using microarrays.
Figure 2. Median expression levels (with 95% confidence intervals) for zygotic (black) and
maternal (red) genes over the embryonic (A and B) and syncytial (C and D) timecourses,
respectively. Short (< 5 kb) and long genes (≥ 5 kb) are indicated as circles and triangles,
respectively. Median expression levels of both zygotic gene length classes increase over both the
embryonic and syncytial timecourses, however the difference in expression level between two
length categories becomes smaller over subsequent stages of development, as predicted by the
intron delay hypothesis. Neither length category increases significantly among maternal genes.
Figure 3. (A) Illustration of the predicted read coverage (indicated as grey bars) along short and
long transcripts under cis-regulation vs. intron delay models explaining the lower expression of
long zygotic transcript during early development. Under a regulatory model, the 5! and 3! ends of
all transcripts should have relatively similar read coverage. Under the intron delay model,
however, the 5!:3! ratio of long genes should be > 1 during early development, and decrease as
development progresses. Median 5!:3! ratios over the embryonic timecourse as determined from
total RNA SOLiD data are indicated for zygotic (B) and maternal (C) genes in black and red,
respectively. Short (< 5 kb) and long (≥ 5 kb) genes are indicated as circles and triangles,
respectively. The 5!:3! ratio shows a decrease over the first six hours of development in long
zygotic genes, but not in any other category, as expected under the predictions of the intron delay
model.
Figure 4. Median expression levels (with 95% confidence intervals) for zygotic (black) and
maternal (red) genes among the species of the four species microarray-based timecourse. Short
genes (< 5 kb) and long genes (≥ 5 kb) are indicated as circles and triangles, respectively. All
three non-melanogaster species show patterns consistent with the RNA-Seq based embryonic
timecourse.
Figure 5. Corrected coefficients of variation (CV*) in orthologous intron length among the four

others.

Transcript length and zygotic origin are not associated with particular functional classes
In order to better characterize potential functional differences among transcripts,
we analyzed the representation of the different size categories of maternal and zygotic
genes among Gene Ontology (GO) biological process terms using FatiGO [36].
10

Consistent with previous analyses [22], [43], maternally deposited genes are overrepresented as compared to the genome as a whole in a number of functional classes
(Table S3). In contrast, we found that zygotic genes did not show significant overrepresentation among any GO biological process categories (p > 0.05). Furthermore,
when zygotic and maternal genes were compared to one another, neither long nor short

15

transcripts were significantly over-represented in any GO category. Consequently, there
is not a clear set of functions associated with whether zygotic genes are subject to or
escape intron delay.
Rejection of a kinetic mechanism restricting early expression of long zygotic transcripts

20

A third potential explanation for the low expression level of long transcripts
followed by a progressive reduction in the relative ratio of median expression of
short/long genes is transcriptional kinetics. Consider a simple model under which a single
RNA Pol II complex transcribes a locus at any one time. Assuming that expression level
eventually reaches saturation, multiple short transcripts could be produced in the same

25

amount of time required to transcribe a long transcript, allowing short genes to reach
saturation while delaying maximal expression of longer genes. However, there are
several lines of evidence that argue against this possibility. First, while it is not known
whether co-transcription of multiple RNA Pol II complexes is a common feature of long
genes in general, it has been observed in situ at a number of specific loci, suggesting that

30

such a simple model does not capture biological reality (e.g., [45], [46]). Second, a purely
kinetic model cannot explain the decreasing 5!:3! ratio observed among long zygotic
transcripts (Figure 3B) without the addition of degradation of incomplete transcripts upon
1

mitosis as required by the intron delay model. Finally, if expression level was primarily
explained by kinetics, we would expect to observe a strong negative relationship between
35

length and transcript abundance within developmental stages of the embryonic
timecourse, and most especially during the earliest stages. While the strongest negative
relationship between zygotic gene length and expression level does occur during the first
embryonic stage (0-2 h) (Figure S1), the proportion of the variance explained by locus
length is low (R2 = 0.0658). Thus while it impossible to exclude the possibility that

40

transcriptional kinetics are playing some role in the time required for long loci to reach
stable levels of expression, it cannot be the primary determinant of long locus expression
delay.
Lack of evidence for differences in the abundance of chromatin marks associated with

45

activation or repression in short vs. long zygotic genes
As an alternative to the intron delay hypothesis, long zygotic genes could be
preferentially delayed in activation only during early development by purely
transcriptional means. This could manifest itself in chromatin structure profiles [46] via
two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: 1) Long zygotic genes could show a paucity of

50

chromatin marks indicating active transcription (such as H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac) relative
to short zygotic genes during early development, with such marks increasing over time
reflecting increased expression, and 2) Long zygotic genes could show an excess of
repressive or heterochromatic chromatin marks (such as H3K27me3 and H3K9me3)
relative to short zygotic genes during early development, with this excess decreasing over

55

time. In order to test this potential explanation of our observations, we obtained ChIP-Seq
data from the modENCODE Consortium [25] generated using embryos collected in six
four-hour windows over embryogenesis for the four histone H3 chromatin marks
indicated above. Their relative coverage was determined in non-overlapping 100 bp
windows for the 1 kb upstream of TSSs in our dataset (see Methods).

60

We did not observe a monotonic increase in the presence of euchromatic marks
(H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac) in the upstream regions of long relative to short zygotic genes,
indicating that they cannot explain the delayed expression of the former (Figure S2). In
the case of the heterochromatic marks, there is no evidence of increased abundance of

2

H3K27me3 upstream of the TSSs of long zygotic genes. However, long zygotic genes do
65

show increased abundance of H3K9me3 ChIP-Seq coverage in the window between 100
to 200 bp upstream of their TSS during the 0-4 h developmental stage, which disappears
in subsequent stages (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p = 0.03) (Figure S3). However it
should be noted that while generally considered a mark of heterochromatin, H3K9me3
has also been associated with active transcription [48]. Regardless, we tested the

70

possibility that long zygotic genes were delayed in activation due to active repression
early in development by repeating the analysis shown in Figure 2, excluding the long
zygotic genes with an above-median level of normalized H3K9me3 coverage 100-200 bp
upstream of the TSS. Our results remain qualitatively unchanged, and long zygotic genes
continue to show significantly delayed activation as determined by ANCOVA (F3,8, p =

75

0.012). Consequently, repression of expression as evidenced by increased H3K9me3
abundance during early development cannot explain our observations.
Analysis of 5!:3! ratios over embryogenesis
Median 5!:3! ratios were generally higher during the 0-12 h time points than in

80

>12-24 h (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p < 2.2 × 10-16 in all cases). Further analysis of
this difference (Figure S4) revealed that long genes show a significantly higher 3! RPKM
during the latter half of embryogenesis, at which point they are being supplied entirely
zygotically, contributing to the large change in 5!:3! ratios observed in Figure 3 (see
Discussion in main manuscript).

85

In order to confirm that the patterns observed in Figure 3 were not an artifact of
examining only the terminal ends of transcripts, we used the same dataset to plot median
base-level exonic coverage (normalized as a fraction of maximum coverage) in nonoverlapping 500 bp windows over the 5! most 10 kb of zygotic and maternal transcripts
(Figure S5). Some caveats should be noted in this analysis: The majority of D.

90

melanogaster transcripts in the dataset are < 5kb (~70%) (Table 1) leading to a
substantially reduced amount of data for more distal windows. Compounding this, the
majority of the sequence of long transcripts is intronic, leading to a general decrease in
likelihood that any window will contain exonic bases required for analysis with
increasing distance from the TSS. Finally, the lack of poly-A selection applied to the

3

95

libraries used for this analysis vastly increases the number of RNA-seq reads derived
from rRNA relative to mRNA, especially as compared to the primary datasets used in the
embryonic and syncytial timecourses (Figure 2). Each of these factors contributes noise
to the estimated expression levels of each window, particularly in those windows >= 5 kb
from the TSS. Nevertheless, the overall patterns observed are consistent with a greater

100

paucity of 3! reads among zygotic as compared to maternal transcripts only during the
earliest time points of embryonic development. Furthermore, we observe no time points
during which maternal transcripts show a greater paucity of 3! coverage (Figure S5).
Zygotic genes highly expressed in early development are short

105

We calculated the mean orthologous intron length across the species analyzed in
the four species timecourse, ignoring any single-exon genes, and compared short and
long maternal and zygotic transcripts (Figure S6). As expected, both zygotic and maternal
high expression genes have shorter mean intron lengths than their corresponding low
expression genes (p < 2.2 x 10-16). Furthermore, the high expression zygotic genes have

110

the shortest mean intron lengths overall (p < 2.2 x 10-16).

H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac were generated from embryos collected over four-hour windows spanning embryogenesis [25]. Neither mark
shows evidence of gradual decrease in the ratio between short and long zygotic genes, as would be expected if the differing patterns of
expression of long vs. short zygotic genes were due to differences in transcription initiation rates.

H3K27me3 does not show evidence of decreasing abundance of repressing chromatin marks spanning development. H3K9me3 shows
a significant excess of coverage in the TSSs of long relative to short zygotic genes during the 0-4h time point. However, removal of
the long zygotic genes showing increased coverage does not change the conclusions of our analysis (see above).

Figure S4. Median 5! and 3! RPKMs over the embryonic timecourse as determined from
total RNA SOLiD data are indicated for zygotic (black) (A, C) and maternal (red) (B, D)
loci. Short (< 5 kb) and long (≥ 5 kb) loci are indicated circles and triangles, respectively.
Short zygotic loci show relatively modest fluctuations over the timecourse in both 5! and
3! RPKMs. Short maternal loci show a general decrease in both transcript ends
corresponding to their general decrease in overall expression over embryogenesis (Figure
2B). Long loci in both zygotic and maternal gene categories show an increase in 3!
RPKM in the latter half of embryogenesis.

Figure S5. Median base-level exonic coverage (normalized as a fraction of maximum
coverage) within 500 bp windows over the 5! most 10 kb of zygotic and maternal
transcripts. Both zygotic and maternal transcripts show a slight negative slope, however,
the slope is more negative for zygotic as compared to maternal transcripts during the first
three time points of development (ANCOVA, p < 0.05; note that the ANCOVA for the 02h time point is no longer significant after correction for multiple tests is applied). This
difference disappears as development progresses, as predicted by the intron delay
hypothesis. Note that the increased variability in median coverage in windows further
than 5 kb from the TSS among zygotic genes during early development likely reflects the
relatively low general expression level of these genes during this period. Only genes with
at least 100 mapping reads were included in the analysis during any individual time point.
