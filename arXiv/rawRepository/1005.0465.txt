We analyze several aspects of the transport dynamics in the LH1-RC core of purple bacteria, which
consists basically in a ring of antenna molecules that transport the energy into a target molecule, the
reaction center, placed in the center of the ring. We show that the periodicity of the system plays an
important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport efficiency. This picture
is modified, and the transport enhanced for any initial state, when considering that molecules have
different energies, and when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last
situation by using stochastic Schrödinger equations, both for Markovian and non-Markovian type
of interactions.
INTRODUCTION

Photosynthetic complexes are formed by ensembles of
molecules that capture the energy from the sun, and
through electron hopping transfer it to the so-called reaction center (RC): a particular part of the complex in
which this energy is absorbed and used to produce chemical reactions [1].
Recent experiments have analyzed the so-called FennaMatthew-Olson (FMO) complex of the Green-Sulphur
bacteria at cryogenic temperatures [2, 3] showing that,
on the one hand, the transfer process between molecules
occurs in a very short time scale (of the order of several
hundreds of femtoseconds), and on the other hand, quantum coherence persist in the system during most part of
the process. This resuls have been extended recently in
[4], where it has been found evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO even at physiological temperature for at least 300 fs. This has motivated a number of
theoretical works that consider the photosynthetic complex as a quantum system, and try to analyse the basic
mechanisms that explain the phenomena observed in the
experiments.
Most of these works analyse in particular the FMO
complex [5–8], and the LH1 − RC and LH2 complexes
of the purple bacteria [9–12]. In both cases, molecules are
subject to an environment of vibrating proteins, that can
be described as a phonon bath. Since dissipation occurs
in a much longer time scale, the bath produces basically
dephasing [2, 13], a mechanism that gives rise to decoherence in the system and therefore leads to a recovering of
the classical behavior. The question of how this dephasing affects the energy transport, and more generally the
interplay between quantum coherence and dephasing in
photosynthetic complexes has been widely discussed in
the literature [5, 6, 8, 14–16]. While as described above,
some experimental results suggest that quantum coherences are present in the process, their role is yet to be
determined. In some situations, like quantum walks in
binary tree structures (see for instance [8] and references
therein), quantum coherences might produce an exponen-

tial speed-up with respect to the classical counterpart.
However, when quantum coherences are too strong, they
might give rise to a decrease of the quantum efficiency,
i.e. the ability to transport the energy to the reaction
center. Indeed, if the system is isolated from the environment and has uniform molecular energies, quantum
destructive interferences may leave the system trapped
in the so-called invariant subspaces [5]. Once there, it
cannot scape and evolve into the target state in which
all the energy is transferred to the reaction center. In
this scenario, a certain quantity of environment noise, or
alternatively some energy mismatches in the molecules,
produces enough decoherence as to drive the system out
of the invariant subspaces, leading to an increase of the
transport efficiency [5, 6, 8]. Environment assisted quantum transport in the FMO complex, as well as the entanglement dynamics during the process have been recently
analyzed for Markovian [7, 17] and for non-Markovian
interactions [7].
In the present work we give a step further into these
ideas, and by taking into account its symmetry properties, we analyze the transport dynamics of the LH1-RC
complex both for Markovian and non-Markovian couplings with the environment. Indeed, the LH1-RC core is
a highly symmetric structure, as it was revealed by pioneering X-ray crystallography experiments (see [18] for a
review). It consists in a ring of several antenna molecules
coupled to a reaction center placed in the center of the
ring [11, 12, 19, 20]. The periodic arrangement of antenna
molecules allows us to describe their operators and their
basis in the momentum space, a representation in which
several interesting features can be observed. Particularly, we consider a simple case in which all the antenna
molecules are coupled uniformly to a single reaction center. In this situation, it is shown that when the antenna
molecules have uniform energies and are isolated from the
environment, only the zero momentum component of the
initial state is transferred into the reaction center. This
component corresponds precisely to the symmetric part
of the initial state, what explains qualitatively and confirms some of the results obtained in [11, 12] for the same
system. In this scenario, the non-zero momentum com-

2
ponents belong to an invariant subspace. However, when
the molecular energies are non-uniform and/or the coupling with the environment is considered, it is shown that
the energy contained in other momentum components
can also be transferred to the reaction center, which leads
to an improvement of the transport efficiency. We show
also how some of these results can be extended to the
case of several reaction center molecules non-uniformly
coupled to the antenna molecules.
The effects of the environment on the the transport
dynamics is described by considering a quantum open
system (QOS) approach. Within this framework, the dynamics of the system is usually described with a master
equation for its reduced density operator (see [21] for a
review), obtained after tracing out the environment degrees of freedom. An alternative to this scheme are the
so-called stochastic Schrödinger equations (SSEs). They
evolve system vectors with the property that the average
over their projector is equal to the density matrix. Some
SSEs describe a deterministic evolution randomly interrupted by discontinuous quantum jumps, as described
in [22] for the Markov case and in [23] for the nonMarkovian case. The late equations have recently been
applied to analyze the dynamics of the FMO complex
[16]. A second type of stochastic equations lead to trajectories where the noise acts continuously at each time
step of the evolution. This so-called quantum state diffusion scheme has been derived for both Markovian and
non-Markovian interactions [24–28], and it will be used
here to describe some of the features of the LH1-RC complex.
The stochastic scheme presents several advantages
with respect to the use of the master equations: first,
this formalism allows us to develop an approximation,
the so-called post-Markov approximation, alternative to
commonly used weak coupling approximation and valid
for different parameter regimes. While the weak coupling approximation is valid for Γdeph ≪ γ, where 1/γ is
the relaxation time of the environment, and 1/Γdeph is
the system dephasing time, the post-Markov approximation is valid for weakly coupled systems, such that the
mean coupling J is such that J ≪ γ. Second, stochastic Schrödinger equations evolve the system state, that
has say M components (M being the dimension of the
system Hilbert space), while master equations evolve a
matrix of M × M elements. Considering a single excitation in the system (an approximation that will be later
explained in the context of photosynthetic systems), M
is just the number of component particles or molecules.
Hence, for a relatively large system like the LH1-RC complex, and provided that the number of stochastic trajectories needed to obtain the relevant quantities is not too
large, SSEs might represent an advantage from the computational point of view. Note that, for instance, for
M = 33 molecules and within the one excitation sector,
a master equation deals with a Liouvillian of dimension

334 ∼ 106 , which is already very close to the computational limit.
The paper is organized as follows. First we analyze the
system in the momentum space. Within this framework,
the relevance of the initial states in the transfer efficiency
is discussed. Then it is shown how the static disorder in
the energies of the antenna molecules, as well as their
coupling to the environment can increase this efficiency.
In order to describe the system coupled to the environment, SSEs are presented together with the post-Markov
approximation. In that way the transport efficiency of
the system undergoing dephasing is analyzed both for
Markovian and non-Markovian interactions.

A SIMPLE MODEL TO STUDY LH1-RC

Let us now analyze the energy transport in the LH1RC core of purple bacteria, based in a simplified picture
of the more complex model described in [11, 12] and depicted schematically in Figure (1). For simplicity, the
antenna molecules of the ring, as well as the reaction
center, are considered as two-level systems. A more realistic situation in which the reaction center is modeled
by a molecular pair is found in [11]. However, we expect
that our simplified model captures some of the main aspects of the quantum transport phenomena occurring in
the system. On the other hand, the rate at which purple molecules absorb photons (approx. one photon every
two hours) is much smaller than the rate at which the
energy is transfered to the reaction center. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that only one excitation is present
in the system during the energy transport process.
In this situation, the state of the system molecules
can be described in terms of a basis {|1ij } for j =
1, · · · , M + 1, where |1ij = |0 · · · 1j · · · 0i is the state
where only the jth molecule is in its excited electronic
state . Note that antenna molecules are labeled with an
index running from 1 to M , while the reaction center is
labeled with the index M + 1. In that way, the effective
system Hamiltonian can be written as

Here, ωi are the energies of the antenna molecules, while
Jij = Jji are the electronic rates that describe the electron hopping from site i to site j. Also, σj− = |0ij h1|
(similarly σj+ ) is the spin ladder operator describing the
transition from one to zero (zero to one) excitations at
−
+
site j, and σM+1
= |0iM+1 h1| (similarly σM+1
) is describing the transition between one and zero (zero to one) excitations in the reaction center. The non-Hermitian term
+
σM+1 , has been added
of the former Hamiltonian iκσM+1

3
to phenomenologically describe the energy sink placed
in the reaction center, which in addition has an energy
ωM+1 . The coupling coefficients of each molecule j with
respect to the RC molecule are designed as Γj .
As noted above, we consider here that there is a single
molecule in the RC. However, our discussion can be easily
extended to the case of having D > 1 molecules in the RC
[11, 19]. In that situation, we should consider that the
interaction Hamiltonian between each of the j antenna
molecules and the each of P
the l molecules
in the RC can
P

be written as HLH1−RC = l=1,D j=1,M Γlj (σj+ σl,RC
−
h.c.), where σl,RC design the spin ladder operators corresponding to the RC molecules. This case will be analyzed
in detail elsewhere.
Let us now represent the Hamiltonian (1) in the momentum space. To this order, we consider the Fourier decomposition of spin operators for the antenna molecules,

for j = 1, · · · M . Here, rj = d0 j, and d0 the distance
between different molecules in the ring. A similar expression exists P
to relate the position and momentum basis,
|1ij = √1M q eiqrj |qi.
Having a system with periodic boundary conditions
allows us to derive a crucial property, that may lead
to important simplifications when expressing the system
Hamiltonian in the momentum space. For a one dimensional periodic system like the molecules in the ring, we
−
know that σj− = σj+M
. According to (2), this means
that eiqrM = 1, what implies that momentum q can only
take discrete values qm = d2πm

leads to the equation

on the profile of Γq , different momentum q are directly
coupled to the RC.
Let us assume an idealistic situation where all the
dipole moments of the molecules within the system are

approximately aligned. In that situation, we can consider
Γi ≈ Γ, so that Γq ≈ Γδq0 so that according to (4), only
the zero momentum spin-wave, σ0 couples to the reaction center. This case corresponds to the configuration
considered in the first part of the paper [11], and is valid
when the mean value of the set of Γi , is much smaller
than their dispersion.

FIG. 1: Schematic representation of the LH1-RC complex,
with 32 antenna molecules distributed along a ring around
the reaction center. The role of quantum coherence in the
transport is intuitively explained as follows: When there is an
excitation in a molecular ring with uniform energies, the quantum paths A and B interfere destructively with each other,
so that path C (and therefore the transmission to the reaction center) is favored. Now, if we start with a symmetric
state (corresponding to q = 0) this basic process will occur simultaneously at every site, giving rise to a perfect transfer of
the excitation to the reaction center. This destructive interference is similar to the one that appears in quantum binary
tree structures [8]. A schematic diagram of the basic building
block of this process is shown at the right hand side of the
figure.

On the one hand, if we assume uniform molecular energies ωj = ω, then ωq,q′ = ωδq,q′ and the Hamiltonian (4)
does not describe any transfer process between different
momentum components. In that case, if we start with
an initial P
state that in the momentum basis is written as
|Ψ(0)i = q Aq (0)|qi, the final transmission probability
to the reaction center is Ptrans = PT (∞) = |Aq=0 (0)|2 ,
PM+1
with P (t) = 1 − j=1 hσj+ (t)σj− (t)i.
Hence, according to the picture described in [6], the
subspace spanned by the vectors {q}, with q 6= 0 is an
invariant subspace from which the excitation cannot escape and be transfered to the reaction center. This may
explain in a very intuitive way some of the results of
[11, 12], in which it is shown that symmetrical initial conditions give rise to a better efficiency. Indeed, for a highly
non-symmetric initial state, as |Ψ(0)i = |1i, that in the
momentum basis has coefficients Aq (0) = √1M eiqr1 , the
transmission probability is just Ptrans = 1/M . On the

4
P
contrary, for a symmetric state as |Ψ0 i = √1M j |ii,
with coefficients in the momentum basis Aq = δq0 ,
the transmission probability is the maximum possible
PT (t = ∞) = 1. Figure 1 offers a possible explanation of
the role of coherences in the process.

and transmission probability, PT (t), for two cases: A closed
system in which every molecule has the same energy ω (black
and red solid lines for Pq=0 and PT respectively), and a closed
system in which molecular energies are randomly distributed
as ωj = ω0 ξj , with ξj a randomly distributed number between
0 and 1 and ω0 = 20J (green and blue dashed lines for Pq=0
and PT respectively). In the first case, Pq=0 (0) gives the final
transmission probability. In the second case the population
of the zero momentum spin wave suffers some revivals produced by the energy static disorder, in such a way that the
transmission probability is increased.

Throughout the paper, all the quantities are given in
units of the typical transfer rate between near neighbours
in the photosynthetic transport, J. According to [13] typical values for this quantity are J = 20cm−1 ≈ 1.667ps.
An alternative way to observe an increase of the transport efficiency is by realizing that molecules in the complex are not isolated, but rather they appear to be coupled to a phononic bath produced by the surrounding
proteins [29]. Since details about the microscopic model
for this interaction are still unknown, we consider a phenomenological model Hamiltonian. As discussed in the
introduction, the coupling produces mostly dephasing in
the antenna molecules. Hence, our model Hamiltonian

P i(q−q′ )
Bj . The Hamiltonian (7)
where Bq,q′ =
je
describes energy transfer between different momentum
components of the antenna molecules, but only for inhomogeneous couplings, when the environment operators
Bj act differently over different molecules i. This means
that the more uniform the interaction is, the less efficient
is the mixing mechanism, what leads to a less efficient
transport.
As noted above, we have considered molecular dipole
moments are approximately aligned, which as analyzed
in [11, 19], does not correspond to a realistic situation.
However, we note that the representation in the momentum space here described, as well as some of the conclusions obtained, are useful even in the more general case in
which the couplings Γj (even for different reaction centers
Γlj ) are not uniformly distributed. To be more specific,
we have introduced the data available in [19] for positions
and dipole vectors of both antenna and reaction center
molecules, in order to calculate the corresponding Γlj . We
have then computed each Γlq (as the Fourier transform of
the set of Γlj corresponding to each of the l = 4 reaction
centers described in [19]), and found that they are functions that present peaks at particular values of q. These
peaks will correspond to the momentum values q that
will be preferentially transfered to the reaction center.
In addition, we have seen that for other values of q, all
the functions Γlq are comparatively very small. Again, if
there is no mechanism present in the system that mixes
different momentum components (i.e. non-uniformities
in the molecular energies, or dephasing), this momentum
values in which Γlq ≈ 0 will correspond to an invariant
subspace: they will not be able transfer their energy to
the sink. Further details of this realistic model will be
analyzed elsewhere.
In the next sections, let us analyse in detail the mixing
mechanism produced by a dephasing, as well as its effects
in the transport.

where Lj is the coupling operator corresponding to the
particle i and acts on the Hilbert space of the system, and
the ωλ′ s are the frequencies of the harmonic oscillators.
The Hamiltonian (6) is recaptured by considering Lj =
L†j = σj+ σj− .
The total wave function of the system, described with
the Hamiltonian (8), evolves from its initial value | Ψ0 i
as,
| Ψt i = U(t, 0) | Ψ0 i

(9)

where U(t, 0) is the evolution operator in interaction picture,
U(t, 0) = eiHB t e−iHtot t .

(10)

We can represent the state (9) in the basis of the environment, which is here chosen as the Bargmann coherent
state basis [30]. In terms of this basis, (9) is written as
Z
| Ψt i = dµ(z1 )G(z1∗ z0 |t) | ψ0 i | z1 i,
(11)
with the notation | zβ i =| zβ,1 i | zβ,2 i · · · | zβ,λ i · · · for
the state of the environment, given by a tensor product
of the states of all the λ environmental oscillators. In
our case, we are dealing with two states z0 and z1 corresponding respectively to β = 0, 1. In addition, we have
defined the quantity dµ(z) as a Gaussian measure given
by
dµ(zβ ) =

d2 zβ −|zβ |2 Y d2 zβ,λ −|zβ,λ |2

Equation (11) is obtained by introducingR the closure relation for the Bargmann coherent states, dµ(z)|zihz| = I
in (9), and considering as initial state |Ψ0 i = |ψ0 i|z0 i,
with |ψ0 i the initial state of the open system, and |z0 i is
the initial state of the environment. On the other hand,
we have defined the function [26–28]
G(z1∗ z0 |t0) = hz1 | U(t, 0) | z0 i,

(13)

that corresponds to the so-called system reduced propagator. This quantity acts on the system Hilbert space,

giving the evolution of system state vectors from 0 to t,
conditioned that in the same time interval the environment coordinates go from z0 to z1 .
The phonon environment surrounding the antenna
molecules in a photosynthetic complex is considered to
be in a thermal state, and not in a pure state as |z0 i.
Therefore, in order to describe the molecular dynamics a
more general initial condition should be considered,
Z
ρtot (0) = dµ(z0 )PT (z0 , z0∗ )|z0 ihz0 | ⊗ |ψ0 ihψ0 |, (14)
where PT (z0 , z0∗ ) is the coherent state diagonal distribution [30] corresponding to a thermal reservoir.
Any expectation value of a system operator A can
be obtained as hA(t)i R= T rS (ρS (t)A), with ρS (t) =
T rB (ρtot (t)) = T rB ( dµ(z0 )PT (z0 , z0∗ )U(t)|z0 ihz0 | ⊗
|ψ0 ihψ0 |U † (t). Introducing twice the closure relation of
the environment, we get the following expression for ρs (t)
in terms of the reduced propagators,

G(z1∗ z0 |t0)|ψ0 ihψ0 |G−1 (z0∗ z1 |0t) . (15)

Note that this equation is just a representation of the
reduced density matrix in terms of a coherent state basis
of the environment. The reduced propagators are then
quantities completely determined by the knowledge of the
initial and the final state of the environment. However,
this initial and final states are described by an infinite
set of complex quantum numbers, corresponding to each
of the harmonic oscillators that compose the environment, distributed according to the measures dµ(z1 ) and
dµ(z0 )PT respectively. Therefore, the integrals appearing
in (15) are infinite and multidimensional, and a MonteCarlo method should be used to solve them numerically.
With this method, the integrals are sampled by choosing a random a set of coherent state coordinates z that
are distributed according to their measure. In that situation, the reduced propagator of the system G(z1∗ , z0 |t, 0)
become a stochastic object [26–28, 31].
We stress that the P function appearing in (15) is by
definition a quantum distribution, and hence it can take
negative values. However, for a thermal environment it
is positive definite, as it is required in order to perform
the sampling over the coherent states.
From equation (15), it is clear that two important ingredients are needed in order to compute system quantum mean values with this method: first, we should be
able to evolve the system propagator for different initial and final states of the environment. In other words,
for different noise histories. Second, we should perform
the average over an ensemble of trajectories that is large
enough to ensure that the Montecarlo integrals are sampled properly. With the Montecarlo method, the better
the sampling is, the closer we are to the exact solution

6
of the problem, except for the approximations made, in
the equations of motion for the reduced propagators. We
consider that the sampling is good enough when the result converge to a value that remains fixed even if the
number of trajectories included in the sampling is increased.
Evolution equation for the reduced propagator

The evolution of the reduced propagator can be derived
following a similar procedure as in [27, 28], and reads as
follows (see further details of the derivation in Appendix

The quantity αpj (t − s) is the time autocorrelation function of the noise zj1,t , as it can be easily verified by com∗
puting the average M[zp1t zj1τ
] with respect to the measure dµ(z1 ). From equation (16) it can also be seen why
the correlation function αpj is responsible of the dependence of the evolution of the system over its past history.
Particularly, it is the kernel of an integral that goes from
the initial time 0 to the actual time t. In that situation,
the slower the correlation function decays (i.e. the larger
is the correlation time τc ), the more contributions appear
from past times.
In order to have a closed evolution equation
for the reduced propagator, the matrix element
hz1 |U(t, 0)Lj (τ, 0)|z0 i appearing in the last term of the
equation (16) should be expressed in terms of G(z1∗ z0 |t0).
In order to do so, some approximation need to be considered, such that the matrix element can be written as a
∗
certain system operator O(z0 z1,i

propagator,
hz|U(t, 0)Lj (τ, 0)|z0 i = hz|Lj (τ, ti )U(t, 0)|z0 i

Within the single excitation sector and considering

we can infer that Oj0 (τ t|z1∗ z0 ) ≡ Oj0 (τ t) = Lj , and
P
Oj1 (τ t|z1∗ z0 ) ≡ Oj1 (τ t) = l (Jjl σj+ σl − Jlj σl+ σj ). Hence,
for n = 0, 1 the operator Oj (τ, t|z1∗ z0 ) does not

the noises, and can be written as Oj (τ, t) = n Ojn (τ, t).
Further details of the calculation are explained in Appendix B.
In order to approximate T with a series expansion, it
is important to establish the conditions under which this
series converge, so that we can just keep the lower orders.
This issue discussed in Appendix C.
MASTER AND STOCHASTIC EQUATION FOR
Lj = L†j

Stochastic equations can be used to derive the corresponding master equation [24, 28]. This is done by
considering the derivative of ρs according to the definition (15), then inserting the evolution equation for the
reduced propagator (16), and finally performing analytically the averages over the environment degrees of freedom. In that way, and for the simple case of an hermitian
coupling Lj = L†j = Aj , the master equation up to first

Evolution equations in the system basis

We now write the stochastic (30) and the master equation (29) in the system basis corresponding to the Hamiltonian (1).
In this P
basis, the evolution of the wave vector
|ψt (z)i =
j aj (t)|1ij , where the coefficients aj (t) =
h1|j G(z ∗ 0|t0)|ψ0 i represent the probability amplitude
that the i molecule is excited, conditioned to an initial
and final state of the environment 0 and z respectively.
For simplicity, we have excluded in the notation the dependency of aj (t) over these environment states.
Considering the evolution equation for the propagator G(z1∗ z0 |t0) given by (20), with the last term approximated with aPpost-Markov expansion up to second first

CHECKING THE STOCHASTIC EQUATIONS: A
DIMER

Before analysing the full LH1-RC system, we study the
evolution of two molecules according to the Hamiltonian
(1). We consider the evolution of the population of the
molecule one, P1 (t) = hσ1† (t)σ1 (t)i, by using the master
equation (37), as well as the SSE (32) for different number of trajectories N M . As shown in Fig. (3) when the
number of trajectories N M is large enough both results
are coincident. This illustrates the convergence of the
Montecarlo method, as well as the fact that both schemes
(master equation and SSEs) are basically equivalent. In
other words, SSEs provide a good alternative to master
equations to describe the dynamics of the system.

As noted above, when including dephasing in the description of the transport process, a new mixing mechanism between different momentum components appears,
what gives rise to an improvement of the transport efficiency with respect to the closed system case. In order to
study qualitatively the effect of dephasing, we will consider that all the molecules have the same energy. This
approximation is only valid when the molecular energy
spread is small as compared to its mean value. However,
it will allow us to describe the effects of the dephasing in
the system dynamics in an separated way with respect to
the effect of energy spread analysed in the former section.
As we have seen in former sections that when considering a closed system with zero dephasing, and uniform energies and couplings to the RC, the total population of non-symmetric
momentum components q 6=
P
+
0, PN S (t) =
q6=0 hσq (t)σq (t)i is a constant quantity
through the evolution. This can be observed in the upper
Fig. (4). On the contrary, when dephasing occurs, this
quantity decreases severely, as can be seen in the curve
corresponding to N M = 500 trajectories in the upper
Fig. (4). This in turn is reflected as an increase of the
population transfer PT in an almost specular way (curve
N M = 500 in the lower Fig. (4)). Along this section we
1
will chose a smoothly decaying hopping, Jpj = (p−j)d
,
0
with d0 = 1/5, that phenomenology describes the decaying of the hopping with the molecular distance. The
coupling from antenna molecules to the reaction center is
chosen as Γ = 0.5. As before, all quantities are in units
of J.
A brief comment concerning the sampling of SSEs is

9
here in order. In both Figs. (4), it can be seen that
for a number of trajectories N M > 250 the curves converge into a fixed value. This shows that for this number
of trajectories, the Montecarlo integrals have been correctly sampled, obtaining the final values for the relevant
quantities.

the FMO complex.
We should emphasize here that the post-Markov approximation used in this work assumes that the electron
hopping time scale is much larger than the correlation
time of the environment. This condition might not be
fulfilled in realistic photosynthetic complexes, and therefore a more complete analysis is needed to describe the
full non-Markovian behavior of the system. Some recent
efforts in this direction can be found in [13, 32–34].

FIG. 4: Upper and lower figures represent respectively the
evolution of the sum of the non-symmetric momentum components PNS and the transmission probability PT for different
number of stochastic trajectories N M . The inset of the later
shows a detail of PT for the closed system (g = 0) at short
times. In both figures, solid black, red, blue and green correspond to N M = 10, 50, 250, 500 respectively, considering a
Markovian situation, with Γ = 100, and a coupling constant
g = 0.4. The dashed black corresponds to g = 0.

We now analyze the total energy absorbed in the reaction center at PT (t) at t = 5 for different decaying
rates of the correlation function, γ and for different couplings g. The time t = 5 is chosen in such a way that
the system has already reached its steady state. In Fig.
(5) we analyze two situations: a large environment decay
rate γ = 100, such that for every coupling g displayed
in the figure, the system is in the Markov regime, with
γ ≫ Γdeph (Γdeph being the system dephasing rate); and
a situation in which non-Markovian effects begin to appear, with γ = 10. In this particular system, the results
shown in Fig. (5) suggest that when dephasing is produced by a non-Markovian reservoir, the transport efficiency is smaller than in the Markov case. The reason
is that non-Markovian interactions preserve the coherence of the system longer, so that the environment is
less effective in the task of taking the system out of the
invariant state subspace, here spanned by the set of |qi
with q 6= 0. In other words, a non-Markovian reservoir
is less efficient on mixing different momentum components than a Markovian reservoir. Although this behavior might be strongly model dependent (in the sense that
different choices of the system parameters might give rise
to different results), a similar effect is observed in [7] for

FIG. 5: Total energy absorbed in the reaction center PT (t)
at t = 5 for a Markovian case, γ = 100 (solid black line),
and a non-Markovian case, γ = 10 (dashed blue). Here, we
only reach intermediate values of the coupling parameter g,
where the Zeno regime described in [6, 8] is not observed
yet. We consider that this intermediate regime is the most
intersting one, since it is the one where the transport efficiency
is improved.

CONCLUSIONS

By considering a momentum space representation, we
have analyzed in a systematic way several mechanisms
that may affect the transport dynamics within the LH1RC complex. To this order, we have considered a simple
situation in which all antenna molecules are uniformly
coupled to the reaction center, showing that, if additionally the molecular energies are uniform and there is
no dephasing, the final transmission probability corresponds to the initial population in the momentum q = 0,
†
(0)σq=0 (0)i. In other words, only the
PT (t = ∞) = hσq=0
zero momentum component of the initial state is transmitted to the reaction center. On the other hand, we
have shown how energy non-uniformities and dephasing
produce energy transfer (or ”mixing”) from other momentum q 6= 0 into the reaction center or sink, increasing
the transmission efficiency.
In order to analyze the effects of the dephasing in the
system transport properties, SSEs are used to describe
the system evolution. This scheme provides some com-

10
putational advantages with respect to master equation
techniques, inasmuch as it evolves vectors instead of matrices. In addition to that, it allows to explore the system
within the so-called post-Markov approximation, that is
valid for environment correlation times shorter than the
system electron hopping. When comparing the transmitted energy at t = 5[1/J] both for Markovian and nonMarkovian interactions, it is found that at least in the
present system, there is less transmission in the last case.
This results are in accordance to what is found in [7]. Indeed, while dephasing destroys undesired coherences in
the system, such that it can evolve out of the invariant subspaces and transmit more energy to the reaction
center, non-Markovian interactions provide a mechanism
to rebuild the coherences. Hence, non-Markovian effects
may diminish the positive effects of the environment that
exists for intermediate couplings.
We note that even when the coupling of antenna
molecules to the reaction center (or reaction centers) is
non-uniform, we can still use the momentum representation to determine which momentum values are most
efficiently transfered into the reaction center, and which
of them are not directly connected to it, and will need
some momentum mixing mechanisms (like energy nonuniformities or dephasing) to transfer their energy into
the sink.

a component of T2 , a second order term in the expansion.
Hence, we just need to consider Ll (τ, t) ∼ Ll + O(n) in
(51). The higher orders in n would give rise contributions
of orders n > 2, which here are discarded.

the electronic hopping J, the condition can be written as

In other words, it is required that the relaxation time of
the environment is much shorter than the electron hopping. A further requirement is to chose γ small enough,
so that for the maximum time tmax , the increasing function in n, Γ[1 + n] − Γ[1+ n, tγ], is compensated by the
n

decreasing function Sγ . From this discussion, it is
clear that in principle within the post-Markov approximation the coupling between system and environment
can be chosen arbitrarily. Therefore, it works even when
the dephasing time scale of the system is comparable (or
smaller) than the hopping time. In addition, for systems
with small enough hopping, it may be even valid for cases
in which the dephasing time of the system is comparable
to the environment correlation time.
The post-Markov approximation is an alternative to
the weak coupling approximation and the so-called
Förster theory, since it is valid in different parameter
regimes. In the weak coupling approximation, the coupling strength between the system and the environment
is considered to be small with respect to the magnitude of
system and environment Hamiltonians (g ≪ S, B, where
S = ||HS || and B = ||HB ||). Furthermore, along with the
weak coupling approximation it is often assumed that the
environment correlation time τc ∼ 1/γ is much smaller
than the evolution time scale of the system undergoing
dephasing 1/γdeph , i.e.
1
Γdeph

≫

1
γ

(62)

where ΓS ∼ g in terms of our parameters, so that the
condition can be written as γ ≫ g. In this approximation
the coupling J and the energy detunings are arbitrary.
In the Förster theory [13], a strong electronic coupling
is considered, such that that electronic hopping occurs in
a time scale much smaller than the evolution time scale
of the system undergoing dephasing,
1
Γdeph

≫

,

or J ≫ λ. The correlation time of the environment,
although somehow related with ΓS is in principle irrelevant.
