Abstract. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to numerically study the temporal evolution and transient
oscillations of the population densities, the associated frequency power spectra, and the spatial correlation
functions in the (quasi-)steady state in two-dimensional stochastic May–Leonard models of mobile individuals, allowing for particle exchanges with nearest-neighbors and hopping onto empty sites. We therefore
consider a class of four-state three-species cyclic predator-prey models whose total particle number is not
conserved. We demonstrate that quenched disorder in either the reaction or in the mobility rates hardly
impacts the dynamical evolution, the emergence and structure of spiral patterns, or the mean extinction
time in this system. We also show that direct particle pair exchange processes promote the formation of
regular spiral structures. Moreover, upon increasing the rates of mobility, we observe a remarkable change
in the extinction properties in the May–Leonard system (for small system sizes): (1) As the mobility rate
exceeds a threshold that separates a species coexistence (quasi-)steady state from an absorbing state, the
mean extinction time as function of system size N crosses over from a functional form ∼ ecN /N (where
c is a constant) to a linear dependence; (2) the measured histogram of extinction times displays a corresponding crossover from an (approximately) exponential to a Gaussian distribution. The latter results are
found to hold true also when the mobility rates are randomly distributed.

have little effect on the dynamical evolution. In this paper,
our goal is to numerically study the effect of spatial disorder on species coexistence in two-dimensional stochastic
May–Leonard model variants. To this end, we implement
the reaction (and mobility) rates for the May–Leonard dynamics as quenched random variables that for each lattice
site are independently drawn from a truncated Gaussian
distribution, and subsequently held fixed during the simulation run. We here explore (i) the self-organization of
the population in the coexistence phase, (ii) compute the
spatio-temporal correlation functions, and (iii) investigate
the statistics of species extinction times (for small system
sizes). Our main results can be summarized as follows:
(1) We demonstrate that quenched spatial disorder
has only minor effect on species coexistence in the MayLeonard model, which together with the results reported
in Ref. [28], shows that RPS models (in the presence or
absence of total particle number conservation) form a class
of systems that are robust against environmental variability. Remarkably, this statement is true even when spatial
disorder affects the particles’ mobility which is known to
drastically impact species coexistence.
(2) We study the combined effect of pair exchange and
hopping processes, and demonstrate that the former are
more important for the formation of robust spiral wave
structures.
(3) We compute the extinction times, defined as the
time when the first one of three species dies out, in (small)
spatially extended systems. We thus find that the mean
extinction time (MET) increases sharply with system size
N when the mobility rate is low and the system is in
the (long-lived metastable) coexistence state. However,
once the mobility exceeds the threshold beyond which
species extinction is prevalent, the MET function switches
to a linear dependence on N . Correspondingly, the extinction time distribution is found to cross over from approximately exponential with prominent tail at large times, to
a bell-shaped near-Gaussian function.
This paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 2, we define
the stochastic spatial May–Leonard model as a four-state
spatial rock–paper–scissors (RPS) game without conservation law for the total particle number, and briefly discuss the well-established results from the mean-field rate
approximation approach. In Sec. 3, we first explain how
this stochastic spatial system is implemented in our Monte
Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional lattice, and introduce the quantities of interest. Then we present and analyze our simulation results. Finally, in Sec. 4 we conclude
with a discussion and interpretation of our findings.

2 Model and rate equations
In the mean-field approximation, our spatial system reduces to the original May–Leonard model1 [5]. We let all
populations live on a square lattice, with each lattice site

At the mean-field level, the model considered here corresponds to the original May–Leonard model [5] with parameters
α = 1 and β = 1 + σ/µ, and time measured in units of 1/µ.

occupied with at most a single individual. We therefore allow four states per site: three interacting particle species
that we label A, B, and C, and an empty state ∅. The
model is defined through the following set of binary predation and offspring production reactions between the three
particle species [5,15,16]:

B+C → ∅+B

Note that in contrast with the conventional rock–paper–
scissors model [18,20,28,29,30,31], the total particle number is not conserved by these reactions, owing to the separation of predation and reproduction processes. In addition, in our spatially-extended system we consider the
nearest-neighbor particle exchange and hopping processes

It is worth mentioning that the models studied in Refs. [15,
16,17] do not separate the hopping process (4) from pair
exchange (3); i.e., ǫ = D. Therefore, when letting ǫ = D
and in the absence of any quenched disorder, our spatial
model coincides with the one investigated in Refs. [15,16,
17].
May and Leonard [5] studied the associated deterministic mean-field rate equations and obtained the temporal
evolution of the population densities. Let a(t), b(t), and
c(t) represent the population densities (concentrations) of
species A, B, and C, respectively. Since at most one individual is allowed on each site in the simulation, within the
mean-field approximation, the overall population density
ρ(t) = a(t)+b(t)+c(t) restricts the reproduction processes
(2). Therefore, the corresponding rate equations are
∂t a(t) = a(t) [µ (1 − ρ(t)) − σ c(t)] ,
∂t b(t) = b(t) [µ (1 − ρ(t)) − σ a(t)] ,
∂t c(t) = c(t) [µ (1 − ρ(t)) − σ b(t)] .

(5)

The coupled rate equations (5) yield four linearly unstable absorbing states (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0),
and (0, 0, 1), and one reactive fixed point (a∗ , b∗ , c∗ ) =

which demonstrates that the fixed point is locally stable
only in one direction of parameter space (the eigenvector
associated with the negative eigenvalue λ1 ), and generally
linearly unstable. As elaborated in Refs. [15,16,17], the
system dynamics quickly approaches an invariant manifold associated with the rate equations (5). In the neighborhood of the unstable interior fixed point (a∗ , b∗ , c∗ ), the
invariant manifold is tangent to the plane normal to the
eigenvector of L associated with λ1 [17]. On this invariant
manifold, the trajectories approach the absorbing boundaries of the phase portrait where they linger and form a
heteroclinic cycle [2,5]. In this case, any chance fluctuations can cause species extinction by deviating the trajectories toward the absorbing boundaries. From the imaginary part of the complex conjugate eigenvalues λ2,3 , we√infer the characteristic oscillation frequency ω = σρ∗ /2 3.

3 Monte Carlo simulation results for the
spatially-extended May-Leonard model
We investigate the two-dimensional May–Leonard model,
i.e., the four–state stochastic RPS game defined by the
reactions (1,2) (which do not conserve the total particle number) on a two-dimensional lattice (typically with
N = 256 × 256 sites) with periodic boundary conditions,
subject to the nearest-neighbor exchange (3) and hopping
(4) processes. In order to mimic finite local carrying capacities, we impose a maximum occupancy number of one
particle (of either species) per lattice site. When investigating the effect of spatial disorder on the model, we will
treat one of the rates (µ, σ, ǫ, or D) at each lattice site
as a random number drawn from a normalized Gaussian
distribution truncated at one standard deviation on both
sides. For example, µ ∼ N (m, n) implies that the rate µ is
picked from a truncated normal distribution on the interval [m − n, m + n], centered at the value m with standard
deviation n < m. In practice, a value of µ is drawn from
N (m, n) for each site on the lattice and attached to the
corresponding site at the beginning of each single Monte
Carlo run. The rate values remain unchanged for all sites
until the next run is initiated. Therefore, in our model,
the randomized rates pertain to the lattice sites; but are
identical for any individual landing on a given site for each
single run.
At each simulation step, an individual of any species
on the lattice is selected randomly; then one of its four
nearest-neighbor sites, which might be empty or occupied
by one particle of either three species, is selected at random. Subsequently, the particles undergo the pair reaction
(1), reproduction (2), exchange (3), or hopping (4) processes, according to the respective associated rates. Once
on average each of the P individual particles on the lattice
has had a chance to react, reproduce, exchange, or move,
one Monte Carlo step (MCS) is completed; the infinitesimal simulation time step is thus δt ∼ P −1 .
When studying the effect of quenched spatial disorder
in the reaction and mobility rates, we shall focus on inves-

tigating a base model with (average) mobility rate set to
5, since the corresponding pure system displays clearly established spiral waves (see Fig. 1b below). Whenever neither fixed rate values nor their distribution are specified
below, the following default rate values were implemented
in the simulations: µ = σ = 1, and ǫ = D = 5. We shall
characterize the emerging spatial structures through instantaneous snapshots of the particle distribution in the
lattice, and will depict the temporal evolution of population (spatially averaged) densities. Because of the underlying symmetry among the species A, B, and C, one
representative population suffices and we here report results for the spatial average of local population number
nA (j, t) of species A, P
i.e., the spatially averaged density
a(t) = hnA (j, t)i = N1 j nA (j, t), where j represents the
site index. We shall also obtain the associated Fourier
transform
Z
a(f ) = a(t) e2πif t dt ,
(8)
and compute the equal-time two-point correlation functions in the (quasi-)steady state,
CAB (x, t) = hnA (j + x, t) nB (j, t)i − a(t) b(t) ,

(9)

where j denotes the site index, and similarly for CAA (x, t),
etc. For our typical system size of N = 256 × 256 sites we
never observed the extinction state in our simulations. In
fact, as discussed in Ref. [15] and below (see Sec. 3.3), in
this case one expects the extinction time to grow exponentially with the system size. Therefore, in order to access absorbing states and numerically measure the mean
extinction time (MET) T̄ex = hTex i, where Tex is the extinction time for a single Monte Carlo run, and extract
extinction time distributions, we must consider small systems of sizes N = 25 to 225.
3.1 Self-organization in the three-species coexistence
phase
In the first row of Fig. 1, we plot typical snapshots of
the spatial particle distributions at t = 1000 MCS for
various exchange and diffusion rates, as indicated, while
µ = σ = 1 are held fixed. We observe in Fig. 1a that all
three species coexist and a set of entangled spiral patterns
forms in the system when the mobility rates are comparatively low. Upon increasing the mobility rates, the spiral
patterns expand, see Fig. 1b. When the spirals’ typical
size ℓ at last outgrows the lattice for large particle mobility (compare Fig. 1a–1c), we anticipate that the system
essentially acquires the features of its zero-dimensional
stochastic counterpart (see Sec. 3.3 and Ref. [15]). In that
situation, the system evolves towards one of the three absorbing states wherein two species become extinct, and
the surviving species uniformly fills the lattice (uniform
phase). In finite systems therefore,
√ there exists a threshold set by the condition ℓ ≈ L = N (in a square lattice)
that separates the absorbing states from species coexistence. Since the √typical
√ extent of the spirals grow diffusively as ℓ ∼ 2ǫ, 2D, this transition should occur

M = 2(ǫ, D)/N [15].
In two-species predator-prey systems, quenched spatial
disorder in the reaction rates can markedly enhance both
asymptotic particle densities in two-species predator-prey
systems [32]; yet this finding is not corroborated in threespecies RPS models with conserved total population [28].
Thus we next explore the effect of spatial variability in
the reaction as well as in the mobility rates in the spatial stochastic May–Leonard model where the conservation law for the total particle number has been removed,
and where the mean-field dynamics is not characterized
by neutrally stable orbits [2,5,18,20]. To this end, we introduce quenched spatial disorder by treating the rate on

each site of the lattice as a random variable drawn from
a truncated Gaussian distribution. As shown in the snapshots in the second row of Fig. 1 (compare with Fig. 1b),
the presence of spatial clustering can still be observed even
though small noisy spiral structures dominate the system.
Thus, the spatial disorder does not markedly affect the
formation and occurence of spiral patterns.
The third row of Fig. 1 shows snapshots of the system
after removing either the two-particle exchange process
(3) or pure nearest-neighbor hopping (4). When exchange
processes are not allowed, see Figs. 1g and 1i, cluster formation is still observed, while the spiral waves become
rather noisy, and it is worth noticing that one additional
cluster type consisting of only empty sites appears in the

Qian He et al.: Coexistence in the two-dimensional May–Leonard model with random rates

system (discernible as black patches in Figs. 1g and 1i),
with measurable consequences on physical observables, as
will be discussed below. Moreover, in Fig. 1h where only
exchange processes are allowed, the spiral pattern boundaries appear quite distinctly sharp, while the empty sites
are randomly distributed rather than clustered.
From these results, we infer that the formation of the
observed spiral patterns is promoted by pair exchange processes. Furthermore, we have also verified that the above
scenario is not affected when the rates are randomly distributed and therefore remains robust against spatial variability of the reaction rates.

3.2 Time evolution and spatio-temporal correlation
functions
In order to quantitatively characterize the properties of
the system, the influence of quenched spatial disorder, and
the effect of pure particle pair exchange processes on the
evolution of system, we next depict the temporal evolution of population density a(t) = hnA (j, t)i, the associated Fourier transforms a(f ), and the spatial auto- and
cross-correlation functions CAA and CAB , respectively, in
the quasi-stationary state (here, at time 1000 MCS) in
Fig. 2. Since the reaction processes are symmetric with respect to the three species, the quantities associated with
species A suffice to extract the relevant information for
all three species. As shown in Fig. 2a, the population density decreases swiftly at the beginning of the simulation
runs: as the particles are initially randomly distributed
and fill the entire lattice, predation reactions (1) dominate and deplete the particle density at the beginning.
However, with the emergence of spiral patterns, these reactions can only take place along the domain boundaries
of distinct species. The system then evolves towards the
(quasi-)steady state with population densities ≈ 0.26 for
the set of rates chosen here, consistent with the mean-field
µ
= 0.25.
prediction a∗ = 3µ+σ
In Fig. 2b, we depict the amplitude of the Fourier signal of the population density. The peak in |a(f )| yields a
characteristic oscillation frequency ≈ 0.004. This is almost
a factor ten smaller than the prediction
from the mean√
field approximation, f = ω/2π = 3/16π ≈ 0.034, indicating a strong downward renormalization as consequence
of spatial fluctuations and correlations, similar to the situation in the stochastic Lotka–Volterra model [33,34] but in
stark constrast with the conserved spatially extended RPS
model [28]. The finite width of the frequency peak in the
Fourier plot indicates that the population oscillations will
decay and ultimately cease after a finite relaxation time,
consistent with the damped density fluctuations visible
in Fig. 2a. Therefore, in the coexistence phase, the system’s dynamics is consistent with the mean-field description, a feature that is however caused by the important
influence of the particles’ spatial mobility: With relatively
low but still effective (average) mobility rates (on average
ǫ = D = 5), the dynamics of the system is dominated
by local interactions (reproduction and predation) along

5

the boundaries of local spiral clusters. Thereby, the coexistence state is maintained for a very long time and simultaneously effective mobility mixes the system well, resulting in a remarkably faithful description of the system
through the mean-field approximation. Furthermore, the
(quasi-)stationary auto- and cross-correlation functions in
Figs. 2c and 2d decrease from their extremal values at vanishing distance to zero within about ℓ = 20 lattice sites.
More importantly, Fig. 2 shows the influence of spatial
disorder on the physical quantities in the May–Leonard
system. We find that quenched randomness in the rates
does not noticeably affect the temporal evolution of the
population densities, the associated Fourier transform signals, or the decay lengths of the auto- and cross-correlation
functions, irrespective of which rate is taken as random
variable. This result demonstrates that our previous observation in the four-state RPS model with conservation
law, where we found spatial disorder to have only minor
effects, is also valid for the three-species May–Leonard system. Therefore, we conclude that predator–prey systems
with cyclic competition appear to be generically robust
against random spatial variations in the predation, proliferation, or mobility rates.
As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the formation of cluster
patterns (see the third row of Fig. 1) ultimately renders
the various observables qualitatively similar to those systems in which particles can move only via exchange processes. However, in Fig. 3 we also observe that the spatially
averaged (quasi-)stationary density a∗ and the peak in the
Fourier transform |a(f )| vary according to the degree to
which nearest-neighbor hopping is included in the model.
In particular, when particle dispersal happens solely through
hopping processes (4), the asymptotic species densities are
relatively low, see Fig. 3a with ǫ = 0, D = 5; compare
with the two plots for other rate choices, and the corresponding snapshots 1b, 1g, and 1h. We attribute this
lower overall species fitness to the previously noted emergence of sizeable clusters of just empty lattice sites in the
absence of pair exchange processes (3), visible as small
black patches in Figs. 1g and 1i. In fact, these voids effectively buffer the three species against the predation reactions (1), but also diminish the total area that can be
saturated by either population, which results in an overall density reduction in the (quasi-)steady state. In contrast, when particle pair exchange processes are included,
the influence of empty-site clusters is diminished and consequently the (quasi-)stationary population densities enhanced (see Fig. 3a for ǫ 6= 0). Furthermore, we observe
that the characteristic density Fourier peak frequencies
in systems where nearest-neighbor hopping is allowed are
renormalized to even lower values than in runs with just
pair exchange processes, which tend to better mix the system, see Fig. 3b (compare the characteristic frequency for
the runs with D = 5 to those with D = 0). In Figs. 3c and
3d, we observe the presence of low-amplitude population
(damped) oscillations during the decay of the correlation
function, which originate from the spiral structures displayed by the system in the coexistence state (under “efficient” mobility rates) [17]. In the insets of Figs. 3c and 3d,

Fig. 2: (Color online.) Quantitative observables for a stochastic May–Leonard system with N = 256 × 256 sites,

simulation runs. If unspecified, the default rate values µ = σ = 1, ǫ = D = 5 were used. The correlation functions in
(c) and (d) were measured at t = 1000 MCS.
we notice that the correlation functions of the model variants with only hopping processes (ǫ = 0) decay to zero in
a less oscillatory manner than the correlation functions for
the variants that include particle exchange (ǫ 6= 0). This is
a consequence of the observed absence of well-defined spiral structures (see Figs. 1g and 1i) when the pair-exchange
rate is too low to efficiently stir the system.
In summary, the pair-exchange processes suppress the
presence of empty-site clusters, and despite rendering the
spiral structures more diffuse (i.e., more “entangled”), they
have an overall stabilizing effect on emerging spatial patterns, and consequently promote the fitness and coexistence of all three subpopulations A, B and C.

3.3 Mean extinction times and their distribution
As we have discussed above, the system is efficiently stirred
when the pair exchange rate ǫ is high enough (independent

of the actual value of D). In this case, the system is characterized by a long-lived coexistence state. However, when
the pair exchange rate is below some critical value, it has
been shown that the system settles in an absorbing state
after an observable amount of time [15]. We here revisit
and extend the analysis of such a scenario that holds true
for any values of ǫ or D by computing the mean extinction
time (MET) and the distribution of extinction times. Here,
for the sake of simplicity (and without loss of generality)
we assume that ǫ = D and the mobility rate therefore
is M = 2ǫ/N . In this setting, our May–Leonard model
coincides with the variant considered in Refs. [15,16,17],
where it was shown that the critical mobility threshold is
Mc ≈ 4.5 × 10−4 (when µ = σ = 1). Indeed, when the effective mobility rate M approaches Mc from below, there
is a cross-over from a coexistence (quasi-)steady state to
an absorbing state.
The MET has been computed as the time when the
first of the three species dies out. Figure 4 illustrates how

Fig. 3: (Color online.) Quantitative observables for a stochastic May–Leonard system with N = 256×256 sites, reaction
rates µ = σ = 1, and starting with equal initial densities a(0) = b(0) = c(0) = 1/3, with different combinations of
nearest-neighbor particle exchange and hopping processes, averaged over 50 simulation runs. The correlation functions

this MET exhibits markedly different behavior when the
effective mobility rate M = 2ǫ/N is swept through Mc .
As shown in Fig. 4b, when the mobility is relatively weak
(M = 10−6 ), the MET increases with the system size
approximately according to the (zero-dimensional) functional form T̄ex (N ) ∼ ecN /N (where c is a constant) [35],
especially for comparatively large values N ∼ 200 . . . 600.
(For smaller systems with N < 200, the data do not fit
this functional dependence very well, but may also not be
as statistically reliable.) Yet the curvature of the graphs
in Fig. 4a decreases upon raising the effective mobility,
and the functional dependence on system size becomes replaced with a linear form T̄ex (N ) ∼ N for M > Mc . That
is, when the mobility rate is low, the system is dominated
by local interactions and species extinction is a rare event
driven by a large fluctuation after an enormous amount of
time. In this case, the coexistence of the three species corresponds to a metastable state. Interestingly, Fig. 4c shows
that spatial disorder in the mobility rate M does not qualitatively affect the behavior of the MET: this very same

scenario applies even when M is randomly distributed.
This observation further supports the conclusion that spatial variability in the mobility rates has little effect on the
dynamical evolution of the system.
When the mobility rate increases and exceeds the threshold, the system is regularly driven towards extinction and
biodiversity is lost, just as predicted by the zero-dimensional
formulation of the model. Furthermore, the histograms of
extinction times plotted in Figs. 4d and 4e show that the
extinction time distributions (obtained for small systems
with N = 20 × 20 sites) correspondingly evolve gradually
from an approximately exponential (or Poisson) shape, albeit with fat tails, towards a (roughly) Gaussian distribution centered at T̄ex . In addition, the distributions remain
unchanged even if spatial disorder is incorporated in the
model (see the insets of Figs. 4d and 4e). The approximate quasi-exponential (or quasi-Poisson) distribution of
Fig. 4d is a characteristic feature of systems where extreme
events occur only after a very long time, and which are
hence driven by large rare fluctuations [36]. Here, the rare

extreme event is extinction of species that were previously
coexisting in a metastable state for a long time period. On
the other hand, the approximately Gaussian distribution
of Fig. 4e is typical of systems where random fluctuations
are of weak intensity [37]. In our competing three-species
system, it is associated with the absorbing state that corresponds to species extinction happening within an “observable” time range, as in the zero-dimensional counterpart of the model [15,16,17]. These numerical observations
support the method suggested in Ref. [15] for identifying
the nature of (quasi-)steady states in the simulation of
RPS models: A reasonable criterion is that the system remains at the steady state if three species still coexist after
simulation time t ∼ N , otherwise, the system evolves to
an absorbing state.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we have demonstrated that quenched spatial
disorder in either the reaction or the mobility rates does
not significantly affect the temporal evolution, Fourier signals, spatial correlation functions, or mean extinction times
in stochastic spatial May–Leonard models (i.e., four-state
RPS models without total particle number conservation)
in two dimensions. In combination with our previous results for conserved three-species RPS systems [28], we conclude that such cyclic predator-prey systems appear to be
generically robust against spatial variability of the rates.
Here, the randomized reaction rates remain attached to
the lattice sites, mimicking environmental variations that
do not change over time. As there exist a number of systems, e.g. in ecology [12] and microbiology [14], where
the competition among species is cyclic, an important implication of our findings is that the environmental variability of the parameters can essentially be neglected in
the mathematical description of those systems. In addi-

tion, through removing the hopping process by letting
D = 0, we observe that particle pair exchange processes
promote the formation of sharp spiral patterns. In our
spatial stochastic system, we measure the population oscillation frequency to be much lower than predicted by the
mean-field rate equations, similar to the situation in twospecies Lotka–Volterra models [33,34], but in stark contrast with our numerical results for conserved RPS model
variants [28]. This downward frequency renormalization
is enhanced by the presence of nearest-neighbor hopping
processes. Moreover, we find a remarkable gradual transformation in the dependence of the mean extinction time
on system size, and the shape of the associated extinction time distribution, when the effective mobility rate
crosses the critical threshold separating the coexistence
from the absorbing state: When the mobility rate is low,
the distribution of extinction times is approximately exponential, and species coexistence corresponds to a longlived metastable state. In this case extinction is driven
by large, rare fluctuations and the mean extinction time
essentially grows exponentially with the population size.
Above the critical mobility threshold, the extinction times
are approximately distributed according to a Gaussian. In
this situation, the noise is of weak intensity and the mean
extinction time grows linearly with the population size.
Interestingly, we find that these results remain valid for
both non-random as well as for randomly distributed mobility rates.
