Abstract
The brain of mammals are divided into different cortical areas that are
anatomically connected forming larger networks which perform cognitive
tasks. The cat cerebral cortex is composed of 65 areas organised into the visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic cognitive regions. We
have built a network of networks, in which networks are connected among
themselves according to the connections observed in the cat cortical areas
aiming to study how inputs drive the synchronous behaviour in this cat
brain-like network. We show that without external perturbations it is possible to observe high level of bursting synchronisation between neurons within
almost all areas, except for the auditory area. Bursting synchronisation appears between neurons in the auditory region when an external perturbation
is applied in another cognitive area. This is a clear evidence that pattern
formation and collective behaviour in the brain might be a process mediated
by other brain areas under stimulation.

1. Introduction
The nervous system of mammals is responsible for collecting and processing information, where the signals are sent by neurons [1]. The propagation
of neural signals occurs through electrical and chemical synapses, as a result
of the difference in electric potential between the exterior and the interior of a
neuron [2]. Neurons connect to each other forming complex layered structures
[3]. The different cortical layers have particular distributions of neuronal cell
types, as well as connections with other cortical and sub-cortical regions [4].
The mammalian brain is composed of distinct areas, the cerebellar cortex,
and non-cortical nuclei. The cortex presents fundamental divisions such as
the hippocampus formation, the olfactory cortex, and associated areas [5].
In this work we consider the cat cerebral cortex. Scannell and collaborators [6, 7] have relevant results related to the cortical system of the cat.
They showed the connection organisation, and reported that there are 1139
corticocortical connections among 65 cortical areas. The cortical areas are
organised into four connectional clusters, corresponding to visual, auditory,
somatosensory-motor, and frontolimbic areas [8].
Here we focus on dynamical features such as bursting synchronisation
and desynchronisation [9]. Bursting synchronisation are thought to play
relevant roles in information binding in the mammalian brain [10]. However,
bursting synchronisation may be associated with pathologies like seizures [11]
or Parkinson’s disease [12]. For this reason, studies about synchronisation
are of great interest to neuroscience.
Our purpose in this work is to study the formation of patterns of synchronisation and desynchronisation in a neural network model of the cat brain,
using the matrix of corticocortical connections in the cat [7]. The matrix
represents the densities of connections in 65 cortical areas is on undirected
weighted adjacency. We describe each cortical area as a small-world network
[13, 14, 15]. Small-world networks have been proposed to be an efficient solution for achieving phase synchronisation of bursting neurons [16]. In addition
they have been found to be linked to different levels of models of the brain.
Small-world networks have been intensively investigated in computational
neuroscience [17]. The characterisation can be made on two basic levels: a
microscopic, neuroanatomic level, and a macroscopic, functional level. Studies at the former level are limited to those few examples in which there is
available data on the neuronal connectivity, as the worm C. Elegans, which
is considered one of the simplest and most primitive organisms that shares
2

essential biological characteristics of the more complex species [18]. Moreover, there have been studies of large-scale anatomical connection patterns
of the human cortex using cortical thickness measurements from magnetic
resonance imaging [19]. The human brain anatomical network at this level
has an average path length and a clustering coefficient with values presented
by networks with small-world property. Stam and collaborators, in a study
of functional brain networks, observed that there is a loss of small-world network characteristics in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, in particular with
an increase of the average path length with no significant changes in the
clustering coefficient [20].
At the macroscopic level of description of neural networks, the use of noninvasive techniques as electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance
imaging and magnetoencephalography provides anatomical and functional
connectivity patterns between different brain areas [21, 22]. This information
provides a way to study the brain cortex, considering the latter as being
divided into anatomic and functional areas, linked by axonal fibers. Scannell
and coworkers have investigated the anatomical connectivity matrix of the
visual cortex for the macaque monkey and the cat [6, 7]. In both cases the
values of the average path length and clustering coefficient are in accordance
with expected small-world properties [6, 7].
Each node in our brain model is described by the Rulkov model [23],
a discrete time system with two dimensions. The low-dimensionality of this
map allow us to study large neural networks of approximately 10,000 neurons.
This model has been extensively tested and it reproduces well the main
features of realistic neural models. It has been used in studies about control
of bursting synchronisation [24], phase synchronisation in clustered networks
[16], and suppression of bursting synchronisation [25].
Our main goal is to show that pattern formation and collective behaviour
in the brain might be a process mediated by other brain areas under stimulation. We also show that external perturbations induce synchrony behaviour
in cognitive areas of the cat cerebral cortex. Bursting synchronisation appears between neurons in the auditory region when an external perturbation
is applied in another cognitive area. We consider perturbations that activate
neurons in accordance with experimental results in that pulses of blue light
are capable to induce neuronal spikes [26, 27].
This paper is organised as follows: in Section II we introduce the network
of Rulkov neurons and the cat brain matrix. In Section III, we study the
phase synchronisation of the cognitive areas according to electrical and chem3

ical synapses. In Section IV, we analyse the effect of an external perturbation
on the synchronisation. In the last Section, we draw the conclusions.
2. Network of Rulkov neurons
There is a wide range of mathematical models used to describe neuronal
activity [23, 28, 29, 30]. In this work we consider the phenomenological model
proposed by Rulkov
α
+ yn ,
1 + x2n
= yn − σ(xn − ρ),

xn+1 =

(1)

yn+1

(2)

where xn and yn are the fast and slow dynamical variables, respectively. The
parameter α affects the spiking time-scale, and we choose values in that the
time series of xn presents an irregular sequence of spikes. The parameters σ
and ρ describe the slow time-scale. Figure 1 shows the time evolution of the
fast and slow variables, where nk is used to denote when neuronal bursting
starts.

Figure 2: (Colour online) Density of connections between cortical areas classified as absent
of connection (white), sparse (red), intermediate (blue), and dense (green).

We build a neuronal network considering the organisation of corticocortical connections obtained by Scannell and collaborators [7, 6, 8]. Figure 2
exhibits the matrix description of the corticocortical connectivity of the brain
in accordance with Ref. [8]. In this work, the matrix elements have connections weighted 0, 1, 2, or 3, where 0 represents the absence of a connection
between two brain areas, 1 represents a sparse connection, 2 represents an
intermediate connection, and 3 is dense connections. In Figure 2 the colours
are representing the weights white for no connections, sparse connections in
red, intermediate connections in blue, and dense connections in green. All
areas are grouped into 4 cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensorymotor, and frontolimbic. The visual region has 18 cortical areas, the auditory
has 10 areas, the somatosensory-motor has 18 areas, and the frontolimbic has
19 cortical areas.
The cortical areas contain a characteristic distribution of neuronal cells
5

and connections. Supporting evidences that there are small world properties
at different level models of the brain [31, 32] we consider each cortical area as a
small world network. A small-world has an average distance among neurons
like a random network, while the degree of clustering is comparable to a
regular network [14]. A small-world network has typically an average distance
between sites comparable to the value it would take on for a random network,
while retaining an appreciable degree of clustering, as in regular networks.
Watts and Strogatz obtained small-world networks from an otherwise regular
lattice with local connections, to which non local connections were added
by randomly rewiring a small fraction of the local connections [14]. An
alternative procedure was proposed by Newman and Watts, who inserted
randomly chosen shortcuts in a regular lattice, instead of re-wiring local
links into non-local ones [33]. We build small-world networks according to
the procedure proposed by Newman and Watts. Each small-world network
has 100 neurons and %5 of shortcuts. The connections among the small-world
networks obey the corticocortical connectivity of the cat (Fig. 2) so that 2
areas connected with weight equal to 1 (red) have 50 randomly connections,
areas connected with weight equal to 2 (blue) have 100 randomly connections,
and areas with weight 3 (green) have 150 connections.
The coupling between neurons happens by means of electrical or chemical synapses. The local connections between neurons within each small-world
network are described by electrical synapses. The shortcut non-local connections between neurons within each small-world network and the connections
among cortical areas are described by chemical synapses. Chemical synapses
may be excitatory or inhibitory. We consider that 75% are excitatory and
25% are inhibitory [34].
The dynamic behaviour of the neuronal network with electrical and chemical connections is governed by the following equations

where S (i = 1, 2, ..., S) is the total number of neurons in each small-world,
P (p = 1, 2, ..., P ) is the number of cortical areas (P = 65 according to Fig.
6

2), ge is the electrical coupling strength, gc is the chemical coupling strength,
α(i,p) is the non-linearity parameter of the Rulkov map with values randomly
coupled in the interval [4.1, 4.4], σ = 0.001, and ρ = −1.25. The term Λn
is an external excitatory perturbation which activates spikes in randomly
chosen neurons. The adjacency matrices E(q,p),(i,p) and A(d,f ),(i,p) are the electric and chemical connections, respectively. They have elements with value
equal to 1 when neuron (q, p) connects electrically with neuron (i, p), and
neuron (d, f ) connects chemically with neuron (i, p). H(x) is the Heaviside
step function, where θ = −1.0 is the presynaptic threshold for the chemical
synapse. When the presynaptic neuron voltage is above θ, the postsynaptic
neuron receives an input. This way, θ is related to the sharp voltage response
of the presynaptic terminals. The constant Vs denotes the reversal potential
associated with the synapse, that is defined by the nature of the postsynaptic
ionic channels. The synapse will be excitatory if Vs is higher and inhibitory
if Vs is lower than a specific range [35]. Regarding the network of Rulkov
neurons, for excitatory synapses Vs = 1.0 and for inhibitory Vs = −2.0.
3. Burst synchronisation without external perturbation
Bursts of spikes and oscillatory patterns of neuronal activity have been
observed in the central nervous system, ranging from slow to fast oscillations
[36]. In fact, synchronised bursting has been verified in EEG recording of
electrical brain activity. A type of synchronisation is the burst phase synchronisation [37].
Burst phase synchronisation is studied through the definition of a phase
for neuronal bursting, defined by the slow variable. We consider that a burst
begins when the slow variable yn , shown in Fig. 1(b), has a local maximum
happening in a time nk . The duration of the burst, nk+1 −nk , depends on the
variable xn and fluctuates in an irregular behaviour as long as xn undergoes
irregular evolution. Then, we define a phase describing the time evolution
within each burst, varying from 0 to 2π as n evolves from nk to nk+1 ,
φn = 2πk + 2π

n − nk
,
nk+1 − nk

(5)

where k is an integer.
We use the Kuramoto’s order parameter as a diagnostic of the burst phase

where Rn is the amplitude and Φn is the angle of a centroid phase vector for
an one-dimensional network with periodic boundary conditions. Il represents
one of the four cognitive areas, l = 1 for visual, l = 2 for auditory, l = 3
for somatosensory-motor, and l = 4 for frontolimbic. Nl is the number of
l represents the phase of the neurons j belonging

to the c cortical area Il . If the bursting phases φn l are uncorrelated, the
(l)
(l)
summation in Eq. (6) is small and Rn ≪ 1. Whereas Rn = 1 when the
cortical network area is in a completely burst phase synchronised state.
We are interested in studying the role of the electrical and chemical coupling strength at the level of bursting synchronisation. For this reason, we
use the time averaged order parameter magnitude, given by
R̄

(l)

T
1 X (l)

R ,
T n=1 n

(7)

where T is the time interval, as a measure of synchronisation in the network.
If the bursting dynamics in the area Il is globally synchronised, we obtain
(l)
R ≈ 1.
Figure 3 shows the time averaged order parameter in colour scale as a
function of the electrical and chemical coupling strength. Due to the fact
that the neurons are not identical the neuronal network does not present
a completely phase synchronised state (R̄(l) ≈ 1). However, the network
exhibits strong synchronisation for R̄(l) > 0.9, corresponding to the white
region. All the cognitive areas, except for the auditory, present strong synchronisation (white region).
The auditory region does not present high levels of bursting synchronisation. This effect is due to the complex network topology, where the
synchronisation patterns are controlled by input intensities among neurons,
and also among the corticocortical areas [15]. To show that we define the
mean field of the auditory area

a set Il belonging to another cognitive area. Due to spatial distance between
areas [38] we consider that the inputs from other areas are through chemical
synapses [39].
Aiming to demonstrate that the absence of high levels of synchrony in

Mn with Cn , Cn , and Cn . Figure 4(a) exhibits the time evolution of

the mean field Mn for N2 = 1000. The irregular time evolution, that it is
associated with a non synchronised behaviour, is influenced by the stimuli
from the visual (Fig. 4b), the somatosensory-motor (Fig. 4c), and the frontolimbic (Fig. 4d) areas. This figure shows that the collective behaviour of
the auditory area is correlated with the input from the frontolimbic. If the
auditory area is isolated from other areas, by making A(d,f )∈I1 ,I3 ,I4 ;(i,p) = 0 it
will present global bursting synchronisation with a frequency around 0.0027.
The frequency is obtained from bursts. Connecting the auditory area with
the rest causes a suppression of bursting synchronisation, as well as the appearance of one more frequency with value equal to 0.0025 (Fig. 5a). We can
see through Figure 5(b) that the new frequency appears by a resonant effect
caused by the oscillations of the stimulus from others areas. The visual and
somato-motor areas present the frequency equal to 0.0025 with magnitude
equal to 0.0005 and 0.001, respectively. The frontolimbic area also exhibits
this value of frequency, but the magnitude is larger than visual and somatomotor areas. Therefore, the low levels of synchrony in the auditory area is
10

mainly due to the new frequency of the input from frontolimbic area.

4. External perturbation inducing synchronisation
It has been experimentally found that the incidence of light with a suitably chosen frequency on a group of neurons is able to alter their spiking
activity. This phenomenon was verified by Boyden and collaborators [26, 27],
by means of blue light they activated spikes in neurons genetically modified,
and also suppressed spikes through yellow light. With this in mind, we consider an external perturbation (Λn ) acting on 100 neurons randomly chosen
in the same cognitive area. This perturbation, aiming to simulate blue light
optical stimulus, has excitatory effect on the perturbed neurons making them
spike independent of their previous state.
We apply an external perturbation on the visual area to verify the synchronisation behaviour. Figure 6 shows the effects of this perturbation in
the cognitive areas. Synchronisation is fully suppressed in the visual area.
The somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic areas do not present significant
alterations due to the perturbation in the visual area. This behaviour is due

to the small number of connections between these areas and the visual area.
On the other hand, the auditory area exhibits a change in its synchronous
behaviour. Without an external perturbation the auditory area does not
present high levels of synchronisation, shown in Figure 3, but with the perturbation in the visual area it is possible to observe strong synchronisation
domains in the auditory area.
In order to understand the perturbation effect in the auditory area we

from visual (b), somatosensory-motor (c), and frontolimbic (d) with the results of Figure 4 we can see that the inputs from the visual area becomes

Perturbations applied in auditory area do not alter significantly the synchronous behaviour of the other areas. Moreover, we have verified which
perturbations in the somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic areas produce
the same effect on the network such as when they are applied in the visual
area.
5. Conclusion
In this paper we studied burst phase synchronisation in a neuronal network with a topology according to the corticocortical connections of the cat
cerebral cortex. When no perturbation is applied we verified that only the
auditory area does not present synchronisation in the parameter space. This
happens because of the large influence of the other areas. The ratio between
inter connections and intra connections is less for the auditory area than

other areas. As the consequence the frontolimbic area induces a frequency
in the auditory area which helps to suppress burst phase synchronisation.
We verified the suppression of burst phase synchronisation when a stimulus is applied on a cognitive area. However, the suppression in a specific area
can affect another area. Our results have showed that an external perturbation applied into the visual area suppresses synchronisation in the visual
area, but surprisingly it induces synchronisation in the auditory area. The
same happens for perturbation applied in the somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic which induces synchronisation in the auditory area.
