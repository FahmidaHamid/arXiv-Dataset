Abstract. We study the effects of a probabilistic refractory period in the collective
behavior of coupled discrete-time excitable cells (SIRS-like cellular automata). Using
mean-field analysis and simulations, we show that a synchronized phase with stable
collective oscillations exists even with non-deterministic refractory periods. Moreover,
further increasing the coupling strength leads to a reentrant transition, where the
synchronized phase loses stability. In an intermediate regime, we also observe
bistability (and consequently hysteresis) between a synchronized phase and an active
but incoherent phase without oscillations. The onset of the oscillations appears in
the mean-field equations as a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, the nature of which (i.e.
super- or subcritical) is determined by the first Lyapunov coefficient. This allows us
to determine the borders of the oscillating and of the bistable regions. The mean-field
prediction thus obtained agrees quantitatively with simulations of complete graphs and,
for random graphs, qualitatively predicts the overall structure of the phase diagram.
The latter can be obtained from simulations by defining an order parameter q suited
for detecting collective oscillations of excitable elements. We briefly review other
commonly used order parameters and show (via data collapse) that q satisfies the
expected finite size scaling relations.

1. Introduction
Understanding collective oscillations of coupled nonlinear elements remains a challenge
from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints. From the theoretical side, much
progress has been accomplished since the seminal works of Winfree and Kuramoto [1,
2, 3, 4, 5] on coupled oscillators, upon which recent literature has expanded to include
effects of e.g. complex topologies [6] and noise [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. From the
experimental side, the subject has a longstanding importance in neuroscience: collective
neuronal oscillations stood for a long time as candidates for a solution of the so-called
binding problem [14], but emphasis has recently shifted to attentional processes [15].
Here we are interested in collective oscillations of units which are excitable, i.e.
not intrinsically oscillatory. This topic has been experimentally observed in a variety
of scenarios, from neuroscience [16, 17] to chemistry [18], but theoretical approaches
have been relatively scarce [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. In particular, it is not entirely
clear to which extent these oscillations are robust with respect to noise. On the one
hand, recent studies have shown sufficient conditions for the onset of global oscillations
of deterministic excitable units with noisy coupling, emphasizing e.g. the interplay
between coupling strength and characteristic time scales of the units [20, 21], or the
importance of the topology of the network [19]. On the other hand, the susceptibleinfected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model on a lattice (i.e. a minimum three-state

CONTENTS

excitable model) has been thoroughly studied, with several results strongly suggesting
that its stochastic Markovian version does not yield sustained oscillations [26, 27, 28, 23]
(for non-Markovian models, see e.g. [29, 30]).
This raises the question whether it is possible to find sustained global oscillations
in a network of excitable units whose intrinsic dynamics (not only the coupling) is
non-deterministic. We therefore propose and study a simple probabilistic model which
has a well-defined deterministic limit. To study the phase transitions in the model,
we employ an order parameter specifically tailored to assess collective oscillations of
excitable systems. These are described in section 2. We study complete graphs as
well as random graphs, comparing mean-field calculations with simulations. Results are
presented in sections 3 and 4, while section 5 brings our concluding remarks.
2. Model
2.1. Excitable cellular automata
The minimum model of an excitable system consists of three states, representing
quiescence (state 0), excitation (state 1) and refractoriness (state 2) [29] (a prototypical
example being the SIRS model). As shown by Girvan et al., however, such a cyclic threestate deterministic cellular automaton fails to exhibit sustained collective oscillations.
For them to become stable, their model needs at least 2 refractory states [20]. To obtain
an arbitrary number of refractory states, for each site j = 1, ..., N, let sj = 0, 1, 2, ..., τ be
the consecutive states of the unit (out of the τ +1 states, the last τ −1 are refractory [20],
see figure 1).
The cellular automaton version of the probabilistic SIRS model (also called the
probabilistic Greenberg-Hastings model [31]) corresponds to τ = 2, with intrinsic
transitions 1 → 2 and 2 → 0 governed by constant probabilities, whereas the
transition 0 → 1 occurs with a probability that usually increases linearly with the
number of excited neighbors [32] (for a study with nonlinear coupling, see [23]).
In the model studied by Girvan et al., on the other hand, all intrinsic transitions
(sj → (sj + 1) mod (τ + 1), sj 6= 0) are deterministic.
Here we study an intermediate variant of these models, where all intrinsic transitions
are deterministic but the last one, which occurs with probability pγ (see figure 1). The
idea is to have a minimum model (lest the number of additional parameters becomes
too large) which incorporates non-determinism in the intrinsic dynamics. The choice to
make the transition from the last refractory state probabilistic is natural and comes from
neuroscience: neuronal dynamics depend on ionic channels which are stochastic [33, 34],
so that a neuron may or may not fire when stimulated at the end of its refractory period
(the so-called relative refractory period) [33].

neighbours, pγ is the probability of transitioning from the relative refractory state (τ )
to the rest state (0). Light gray states are refractory. All other transitions are
deterministic.

2.2. Coupling
The only transition that still needs to be described is the excitation process 0 → 1. We
assume each site j is symmetrically connected with kj other sites. Each active site has a
probability σ/K of activating a resting neighbour, where σ is a control parameter (which
corresponds to the system branching ratio [35, 22]) and K is the average connectivity
(K = hkj i). The fraction of active sites

is used to measure network activity at time t. At σ = 1 the model shows a transition
from an absorbing to an active state, but without sustained oscillations [22]. With
deterministic units (pγ = 1), the system undergoes a transition to the oscillatory regime
at σ = σc (pγ = 1) > 1, which persists indefinitely if σ is further increased [20, 22].
To motivate the analysis to be developed in section 3, figure 2 shows examples
of single-run results in a complete graph with N = 5 × 105 for pγ = 0.85 and
increasing values of σ. For probabilistic units, we observe the transition to an active but
nonoscillating state at σ = 1 [Figure 2(a)-(b)] and the second transition to an oscillating
state for larger σ [Figure 2(b)-(c)]. Contrary to what is observed in the deterministic
model, however, in the probabilistic model this second transition is reentrant with
respect to the coupling strength σ, as shown in figure 2(c)-(d).
The nature of this reentrant transition will be clarified in section 3. In order to
analyze it properly, though, one needs to define an adequate order parameter to detect
synchronization among excitable elements.
2.3. Order parameters
Most studies of synchronization employ the Kuramoto order parameter [2, 3], which
corresponds to the time and ensemble average of the norm of the complex vector

where θj = 2πsj /(τ + 1). Note that Z corresponds to the center of mass of the phases of
the units. This works fine when the system is composed of coupled uniform oscillators,

because rotational symmetry will ensure that, in the absence of sustained collective
oscillations, the order parameter vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Consider,
however, the present case of excitable elements. The trivial absorbing state (sj = 0,
∀j), which is always a collective solution of the dynamics, yields a nonzero (in fact,
maximum!) Kuramoto order parameter. Indeed, in the absorbing state units are
all “perfectly synchronized” in the sense that they always have the same state. But
this is clearly not what one wants to detect. This problem persists for σ & 1 (below
the onset of collective oscillations), where a small fraction of the units are active (on
average), whereas most remain quiescent. In that case, Z has a constant bias towards
the absorbing state, around which it will fluctuate.
Collective oscillations correspond to rotations of Z which may be misdetected in
the averaging procedure owing to a lurking constant vector. One possibility which has
been used to avoid the weight of the absorbing state is excluding terms with sj = 0
from the sum in eq. (2) [19, 21]. Another strategy makes use of the standard deviation
(measured along time) of Pt (1) to detect oscillations [36], though neither procedure is
easily extensible to continuous-phase systems.
To account for a system of continuous-phase units which may have an arbitrary
number of preferred phases, one could employ the angular momentum L ≡ X∂t Y −
Y ∂t X, where Z = X + iY [37, 38]. In our cellular automata, this would require the
discretization of the time derivative, which could introduce unnecessary numerical errors.

Alternatively, Shinomoto and Kuramoto have previously proposed
q̃ ≡ h|Z − hZit |it ,

(3)

which amounts to subtracting the constant bias from Z before the averaging
procedure [39]. However, this can be computationally expensive, requiring the storage
of the whole time series. Making use of a similar idea, but with much less computational
bookkeeping, in the following we will characterize collective oscillations via the order
parameter

q = h|Z − hZit | it = h|Z|2 it − |hZit |2 ,

which can be seen as a generalized standard deviation of Z(t). Differently from q̃,
obtaining q is computationally inexpensive, as the means over time are now separated
and may be calculated along with the simulation. In section 4.3 we will show that q
satisfies scaling relations near a phase transition, as expected for an order parameter.
One may grasp intuition about q by considering the different time series in figure 2.
Let P1∗ be the stationary value limt→∞ hPt (1)it , which is an order parameter in its own
right, measuring whether or not the network is active [22]. In figs. 2(a) and (b), although
the system goes from P1∗ = 0 to P1∗ 6= 0 as the system goes from an absorbing to an
active fixed point, both have q = 0, because there are no oscillations after the transient.
In figure 2(c), on the other hand, we have both P1∗ 6= 0 and q > 0, as the oscillatory state
becomes stable after increasing σ. Finally, for figure 2(d), the oscillations are unstable,
P1∗ 6= 0 and q = 0.
3. Complete graph
We start with the complete graph because it is presumably the topology most prone
to exhibiting stable collective oscillations. Besides, it allows a comparison between
simulations and analytical results (see below). From now on, we will focus on the effect
of the probabilistic dynamics (pγ ) on synchronization and will fix τ = 3.
3.1. Simulations
We have simulated complete graphs (kj = K = N − 1) with sizes varying from N = 105
to N = 106 . At each time step, intrinsic transitions occur as described in section 2. The
transition 0 → 1 is governed by the number N1 (t) of active (si = 1) sites at time t, each
of which can activate a quiescent cell with probability σ/N. Therefore, the probability
of a quiescent cell being activated by at least one of its N1 (t) active neighbours is

which renders the simulations relatively simple despite the large system sizes. Finally,
initial conditions must be chosen to avoid large amplitudes during the transient, which
could throw the system into the absorbing state [20]. Apart from that, the effects we

CONTENTS

report below are robust with respect to the initial conditions and we have arbitrarily
fixed P0 (0) = 0.8 and P0 (1) = 0.2.
To illustrate the kind of reentrant transition exemplified in figure 2, we show in
figure 3(a) the order parameter q as a function of the coupling parameter σ. Starting at
some σmin > 1, for each value of σ we let the system evolve during a transient of ttrans
time steps, after which we start measuring the order parameter q up to t = tmax time
steps. We then increase σ by a constant amount δσ and repeat the procedure, with the
initial condition of the system for each value corresponding to the final condition of the
preceding value. Both constants are chosen so the rate of change is small (δσ/tmax ≪ 1).
After a maximum value σmax is reached, σ is sequentially decreased by the same amount
δσ down to σmin .
As shown in figure 3(a), the reentrance of the transition to collective oscillations
is captured by the non-monotonic behavior of q(σ), which departs from zero at some
lower value σc (pγ ) and returns to zero at some upper value σ2c (pγ ). Moreover, we have
found that while the first transition is always continuous, the second transition can be
discontinuous. The fingerprint of the discontinuity is the hysteresis observed in the order
parameter: above σ2c , the only stable state of the system has constant (but nonzero)
Pt (1), thus no oscillations (q = 0). If we decrease σ, oscillations do not reappear at σ2c ,
but rather at a lower value σ1c . There is therefore a region of bistability σ ∈ [σ1c , σ2c ]
in parameter space where collective oscillations (q > 0) can coexist with an active
(Pt (1) > 0) but non-oscillating (q = 0) state. As it turns out [see Figure 3(a)], for
pγ = 0.95 the size of this bistable region is rather sensitive to the system size. Smaller
systems tend to be perturbed away from collective oscillations by larger fluctuations,
leading to smaller hysteresis cycles.
As pγ is decreased, the mean and variance of the refractory periods of the units
increase, rendering the whole system noisier. This might be the explanation for the
result in figure 3(b), which shows a smaller reentrant region with oscillations (q > 0).
The width of the hysteresis cycle also decreases, with both σ1c and σ2c decreasing.
Furthermore, σ2c (along with the width of the hysteresis cycle) becomes less sensitive
to the system size, which could be due to the variance of the refractory periods
overcoming the effects of small-size fluctuations. Albeit subtly, σc also increases slowly
with decreasing pγ , as will be seen in figure 4.
Further decreasing pγ [Figure 3(c)], the bistable region vanishes, whereas the
transition to a collectively oscillating state remains. Finally, for sufficiently small pγ ,
collective oscillations are no longer stable [Figure 3(d)].
In the following, we will show that these transitions can be quantitatively
reproduced by a low-dimensional mean-field analysis. For a controlled comparison,
σc and σ1c were heuristically defined as the values√of σ (averaged over n runs) where
q first rose above some threshold value qmin ∝ 1/ N, respectively for increasing and
decreasing values of σ. On the other hand, σ2c was defined as the value of (increasing)
σ where q first fell below qmin .

Note that fluctuations in the inset of (d) decrease with increasing system size, where
the mean-field approximation (section 3.2) predicts q = 0 in the thermodynamic limit
(see also section 4.3).

3.2. Mean-field analysis
In the following we apply the standard mean-field (MF) approximation [40] to the
equations governing our system. We follow closely the steps of Refs. [20, 41, 22], where
every site is considered to have K neighbors, a fraction Pt (1) of which is excited at time
t. If a given site is at rest [with probability Pt (0)], the probability of it becoming excited
by at least one of its excited neighbors is

The dynamics of the system is then described by the following closed set of equations:
Pt+1 (0) = pγ Pt (τ ) + (1 − Pinf (t)) Pt (0)

renders (7) redundant and reduces the system to a τ -dimensional map [41]. Therefore,
increasing the duration of the refractory period amounts to an increase in the complexity
of the mean-field calculations.
For the complete graph, K = N − 1 and mean field is exact. In the thermodynamic
limit, (6) becomes

In other words, in the mean field approach the state of the system is completely described
by P~t ≡ (Pt (1), Pt (2), . . . , Pt (τ ))T , which evolves according to P~t+1 = F~ (P~t ). Note that
F1 is the only component of F~ which is nonlinear [see (13)].
From (9), the fixed point for any 2 ≤ s ≤ τ −1 is clearly Ps∗ ≡ P∞ (s) = P∞ (s−1) =
· · · = P1∗ which, upon substitution in (10), gives Pτ∗ = P1∗ /pγ . Finally, in its steady state,

which can be numerically solved. Expanding near P1∗ ≃ 0 (note that P1∗ = 0 is always
a solution), one easily obtains the transition from an absorbing to an active (steady)
state at σ = 1 [22]. The collective oscillations appear when the active state becomes
unstable.
3.3. Linear stability
Considering a small perturbation ηt (s) such that Pt (s) = Ps∗ + ηt (s), the linearized
dynamics can be written as ~ηt+1 = A~ηt , where Aij = ∂Fi /∂Pt (j)|P~ ∗ is the Jacobian

and g(σ, P1∗) = e−σP1 − 1 + σe−σP1 [1 − (τ − 1 + 1/pγ )P1∗]. The eigenvalues {µj }τj=1
of A determine whether P~ ∗ is stable (maxj |µj | < 1) or unstable (maxj |µj | > 1) (for
simplicity, in the following we employ µ ≡ µk , where k = argmaxj |µj |).
We expect to pinpoint the transition to the oscillatory state by looking for a
Neimark-Sacker (NS) bifurcation in the mean field equations (which is the discretetime analog of the Andronov-Hopf (AH) bifurcation in continuous time [42]). In other
words, for fixed pγ , we have |µ| = 1 with Im(µ) 6= 0 at σ = σ N S . The relation between
σ N S and the pair {σ1c , σ2c } of critical values depicted in figure 3(a) will be clarified below.
Like the AH bifurcation, the NS bifurcation also comes in two different flavours: in
the supercritical case, a stable closed invariant curve (CIC — the discrete-time analog
of a limit cycle) is born at σ N S and grows continually from zero amplitude; in the
subcritical case, an unstable CIC exists below σ N S and engulfs the fixed point P~ ∗ at
σ N S (above which the system is typically attracted to another pre-existing, but stable,
CIC). Since the order parameter q increases with the amplitude of the oscillations (which
is, roughly speaking, proportional to ||~η||), a supercritical (subcritical) NS bifurcation in
the mean-field equations is suggestive of a continuous (discontinuous) phase transition
in the system (see e.g. [23]).
The sign of the first Lyapunov coefficient l1 [42] indicates if the Neimark-Sacker
bifurcation is supercritical (l1 < 0) or subcritical (l1 > 0). Its calculation is briefly
reviewed in the Appendix. We now have the necessary tools to unveil the complete
phase diagram.
3.4. Phase diagram
We have run simulations of complete graphs with N = 106 excitable units and employed
the protocol described in section 3.1 with tmax = 103 to detect the width of the hysteresis
loop (coexistence region). We have tested and verified that longer values of tmax do not
change our results significantly. The phase diagram thus obtained from the simulations
is shown with symbols in figure 4 (the horizontal gray lines show the values of pγ used
in figure 3). To obtain the NS lines of the mean-field equations, we have numerically
Q
explored a special test function [42] ΦN S (σ; pγ ) = τm<n (1 − µn µm ), which changes its
sign at the NS bifurcation. As the first Lyapunov coefficient l1 determines whether the
bifurcation is super- or subcritical, its value along the bifurcation line is shown in the
inset of figure 4 (changing sign at σT ). The solid lines in figure 4 show the supercritical
(red) and subcritical (blue) bifurcation curves where ΦN S (σ N S ; pγ ) = 0.
Comparing the solid lines with the symbols in figure 4, we observe that linear
stability analysis accurately accounts for the transition from an active (but nonoscillating) phase to an oscillating phase. In other words, it correctly predicts the
lines σc (pγ ) and σ1c (pγ ), where in both cases the non-oscillating phase loses stability.
The transition at σ2c (pγ ), however, cannot be predicted by linear analysis. Note
that in this case it is the stable CIC that loses its stability (that of the fixed point
P~ ∗ remaining intact). This hints at the existence of a global bifurcation, which can be

agreement with simulations (symbols).

detects oscillations in the simulations which are not predicted by the mean-field analysis.
This phenomenon is due to stochastic oscillations, as recently explained by RisauGusman and Abramson [43]: the fixed point in the conflicting region is in fact stable,
but with an eigenvalue with a nonzero imaginary part. Inevitable fluctuations throw
the system away from the stable point, to which it returns in spiral-like trajectories,
yielding a nonzero q even for very large system sizes [43, 23].
For pγ = 1, we recover a quenched variant of the model by Girvan et al. [20]. In
this regime where intrinsic transitions are deterministic, increasing the coupling will

only reinforce collective oscillations, and the fixed point P1∗ never regains stability (i.e.
σ1c → ∞). This suggests that even small amounts of noise in the intrinsic dynamics of
excitable elements can lead to qualitatively different collective behavior in a regime of
strong coupling.
4. Random graph
4.1. Mean-field and simulation results
To understand network topology effects on synchronization, we study a bidirectional
random graph similar to an Erdős-Rényi [44] network, where NK/2 links connect
randomly chosen pairs [22] and remain frozen (“quenched”) throughout each run (and
in each run, a new realization of the network is created). The main difference with
respect to the complete graph (CG) is that in the random graph (RG) the value of σ
is bounded from above: σ ≤ K [see (6)]. The mean-field calculations, however, are
otherwise similar to that of the complete graph, with (6) replacing (12). We therefore
applied to the RG problem the same procedures for determining the stability of the
solutions, the nature of the NS bifurcation and the boundary of the bistability region
(see section 3).
Given their uncorrelated assigment of links and short distances among sites, random
graphs are usually regarded as the natural topology in which mean-field predictions are
expected to hold. Indeed, simulations and mean-field calculations agree nearly perfectly
as far as the phase transition at σ = 1 [22] is concerned. In figure 5(a)-(b) we see that
a good agreement is also observed in the transitions to a synchronized phase for large
values of K. Note, however, that simulations and mean-field predictions differ at the
rightmost boundary of the bistable region, and the disagreement worsens as K decreases.
As shown in figure 5(c), for smaller values of K bistability was not even detected in the
simulations, and the oscillating phase is substantially smaller than predicted by mean
field.
4.2. Annealed random graphs
Could correlations (which are neglected by the mean-field approximation) account for
the discrepancy observed in figure 5? In order to assess the role of the correlations
associated with the quenched connectivity, we studied an annealed variant of the model
where the K neighbors of each site are randomly chosen at each time step [20, 45].
Results are shown in figure 6, in which we restrict ourselves to smaller values of K
because results are essentially indistinguishable from the quenched case for large K.
For smaller K, three features are noteworthy. First, the agreement with mean
field results is recovered (apart from the stochastic oscillations in the lower end of the
oscillating phase, like in the previous cases). This therefore confirms the suspicion that
correlations associated to the quenched connectivity can indeed undermine collective

oscillations. This is not surprising, given the difficulty of establishing collective
oscillations of excitable elements in hypercubic lattices [19, 23].
Second, the bound σ < K impoverishes the repertoire of detected phenomena for
small K [see the forbidden gray regions in figure 6(b) and (c)]. Note that the coexistence
region shrinks as K decreases. In fact, since σT varies very slowly with K [see the inset
of figure 6(c)], there is a minimum value of K [satisfying Kc = σT (Kc )] below which
the system shows no bistability (i.e. there is no change in the sign of l1 ). We have
numerically estimated Kc = 7.8074(1).
Finally, note that the oscillating phase extends into lower values of pγ for decreasing
K. This is a rather counter-intuitive result. It means that, for fixed σ and pγ , it is

possible to take the system from a non-oscillating to an oscillating phase by lowering
the connectivity K. This is a particularity of the annealed RG (and the mean-field
approximation), however. Note in figure 5 that the opposite (and expected) trend is
observed for quenched random graphs. It remains to be studied whether refining the
approximation (including e.g. first-neighbor correlations [41, 28]) can reconcile meanfield with quenched random graph results.
4.3. Finite-size scaling
Our phase diagrams rely heavily on the proposed order parameter q. The inset of figure 7
indicates that near σc its behavior becomes increasingly abrupt with increasing system

size N. In order to confirm that q indeed possesses the basic properties of a bona fide
order parameter, here we show that at the supercritical NS bifurcation (i.e. a second
order phase transition) it satisfies the scaling relations that would be expected from
standard finite-size scaling (FSS) theory.

Defining ∆ ≡ σ − σc , FSS predicts that q ∝ L−β/ν⊥ f ∆L1/ν⊥ for a lattice with
linear size L [40], where the critical exponents are defined as q ∝ |∆|β and ξ ∝ |∆|−ν⊥
in the limit N = Ld → ∞ (where ξ is the correlation length). This holds for d below
the upper critical dimension dc . For d ≥ dc , mean-field exponents are expected and the
scaling relation has to be modified [46] with L → N 1/dc , so

q ∝ N −β/dc ν⊥ f ∆N 1/dc ν⊥ .
(17)
This modified version of the usual FSS relation was shown to also hold for infinitely
coordinated networks [47] (i.e. the complete graph).

used β = 1/2, ν⊥ = 1/2, dc = 4. Mean over 15 runs, with standard errors smaller than
symbol size. Other parameters were tmax = 104 ,ttrans = 7 × 103 , δσ = 5 × 10−3

For large argument, the scaling function in Equation (17) becomes f (x) ∝ xβ ,
as usual [40]. In the subcritical regime (∆ < 0), one expects q ∼ O(N −1/2 ) [3],
dc ν ⊥
so f (∆N 1/dc ν⊥ ) ∝ N −1/2 N β/dc ν⊥ . For this to be true, f (x) ∝ xβ− 2 when x < 0.
Figure 7 shows an excellent data collapse for (quenched) random graphs with different
system sizes. Consistent power laws are obtained with standard mean-field exponents
(as expected for random graphs), namely β = 1/2 [3], ν⊥ = 1/2 and dc = 4 [40]. Similar
results are obtained with complete graphs (not shown).

5. Concluding remarks
We have studied the effects of a probabilistic refractory period in the collective behavior
of a large number of coupled excitable cellular automata. We have obtained the meanfield solution of the model and compared it with simulations of complete as well as
random graphs. The continuous phase transition to a synchronized regime is associated
to a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in the mean-field equations.
This scenario is similar to what has been previously obtained by Girvan et al. [20]
in a model of deterministic excitable automata (pγ = 1 in our model). The effects of
setting pγ < 1, however, are drastic, and appear for sufficiently strong coupling σ, when
we have observed that oscillations vanish. This is in contrast with the transition to
the absorbing state found in Ref. [20] for strong coupling. While in their model the
transition is due to very large amplitudes driving the system into rest (Pt (1) = 0), in
our model the system is thrown into an active albeit disordered state, which still has
Pt (1) 6= 0, but no oscillations.
Furthermore, only for non-deterministic excitable elements do we observe
bistability, with an oscillating and an active (but non-oscillating) phase coexisting. This
leads to hysteresis cycles, whose sizes can depend on the system size (notably for the
complete graph) and eventually disappear in random graphs with small enough mean
connectivity K.
Although we have restricted ourselves to τ = 3, preliminary results suggest that the
overall scenario is preserved for larger values of τ , specially regarding the first transition
at σc . The observation of bistability and hysteresis is more difficult for larger values of
τ , owing to stronger finite-size effects. These are similar to those reported by Girvan et
al.: for finite N and sufficiently strong coupling, the CIC grows in amplitude and nears
the absorbing state, to which the system is thrown by fluctuations [20]. Distinguishing
between that type of transition and the bistability reported here is not obvious and
remains to be studied.
It is interesting to note that a simple model allows the straightforward application
of standard techniques of nonlinear dynamics to the study of these phase transitions,
which could otherwise be difficult to tackle. Note that in the limit pγ = 1, each excitable
unit in our model has, at the end of its refractory period, a perfect memory of its past τ
time steps. Incorporating this memory in a continuous-time model would require nonMarkovian dynamics, as recently proposed by Gonçalves et al. [30]. Interestingly, their
model also shows an oscillating phase with reentrance, whose size decreases as memory
time decreases. In our model, this corresponds to lowering pγ , with a similar effect on
the collective behavior. It remains to be investigated whether bistability also occurs in
non-Markovian continuous-time models.
Finally, a note of caution is in order regarding the scaling results of figure 7. The
fact that a data collapse is obtained employing an upper critical dimension dc = 4 by no
means implies that a lower critical dimension exists. In fact, we are not aware of models
which exhibit collective oscillations of excitable elements in hypercubic lattices (though

17

CONTENTS

they do appear if stimulated with a Poisson drive [48]). It remains to be investigated
whether the results of this model hold for small-world networks and other complex
topologies [19, 21], which are extremely appealing for applications in Neuroscience.
This is currently under investigations (results will be published elsewhere).
In summary, we have shown that collective oscillations of excitable elements have
robustness to a certain degree of stochasticity in their intrinsic dynamics. For fixed
coupling, there is a critical value of pγ , below which no oscillations are stable. Fixing
pγ < 1 and increasing the coupling σ, on the other hand, leads to interesting new
phenomena such as bistability and discontinuous transitions. Taken together, our
results suggest that even weakly noisy dynamics can qualitatively change the collective
oscillating behavior. Studies attempting to verify whether these phenomena are observed
in more detailed excitable networks (e.g. modelled by stochastic differential equations)
would certainly be welcome.
