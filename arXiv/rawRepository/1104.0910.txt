Problems of search and recognition appear over different scales in biological systems. In this review we focus on the challenges posed by interactions between proteins, in particular transcription factors, and DNA and possible mechanisms which
allow for a fast and selective target location. Initially we argue that DNA-binding
proteins can be classified, broadly, into three distinct classes which we illustrate using
experimental data. Each class calls for a different search process and we discuss the
possible application of different search mechanisms proposed over the years to each
class. The main thrust of this review is a new mechanism which is based on barrier
discrimination. We introduce the model and analyze in detail its consequences. It is
shown that this mechanism applies to all classes of transcription factors and can lead
to a fast and specific search. Moreover, it is shown that the mechanism has interesting transient features which allow for stability at the target despite rapid binding
and unbinding of the transcription factor from the target.

INTRODUCTION

Many biochemical processes require both an appropriate speed and a high specificity for
proper biological functions to occur – a fast desirable process should not be accompanied
by a significant acceleration of undesirable ones. With typical energy scales of a few kB T ,
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, evolution has devised many
efficient mechanisms which overcome the noisy environment and the speed requirements.
These range from mechanisms which rely on the consumption of chemical energy, such as
kinetic proofreading [1], to cooperativity, such as in the specific regulation of the hemoglobin
oxygen concentration [2, 3]. Unraveling these mechanisms is an important step towards
understanding how cells function.
Being based on biopolymers, specificity in biological systems implies that two (or more)
well defined subsequences of two given polymers attach to each other, but not to other
subsequences of the same polymers or to other polymers. The two polymers can be proteins

3
(for example, in enzymes [3]), RNA molecules (for example, in ribosomal action [4, 5]), a
single-stranded and a double stranded DNA (for example, in the homologous recombination
[6]) or a transcription factor (TF) and a DNA molecule. The last example highlights the
challenges which a biological system faces.
Consider, for example, a prokaryotic cell (throughout the review we focus on these simpler
systems). Its typical DNA length is N ' 107 basepairs. In a particularly simple case a TF
has to bind to a specific subsequence (target) of a length of about 10 − 20 basepairs on the
DNA. The typical binding energy between a protein and the DNA subsequence is of the order
of tens of kB T , about one kB T per base-pair. Without using chemical energy (which is true
for almost all transcription factors) this gives rise to a classical conflict between entropy
and energy which puts a hamper on the stability of the TF at the target1 . Specifically,
the entropy associated with the protein bound to non-target DNA is kB ln N ' 16kB and
therefore its contribution to the free energy is of the same order as the binding energy.
Unless the TF is designed to have a binding energy at the target that is much lower than
to the rest of the sequence the probability of finding it on the target site will be very low.
Of course, the copy number of a TF, which in a cell typically ranges from about tens to
thousands [8–11], can increase the occupation probability of the target site to a desired level
(see, for instance, [12]). This, however, comes at a cost of producing many proteins and
possibly activating or repressing unwanted genes and loosing specificity, meaning that the
TF is likely to occupy nonspecific sites (below this argument in presented in a quantitative
manner).
Following this line of thought early works [13–15] considered designed targets with a
gapped binding energy which is much lower than the rest of the DNA sequence. A sufficiently
large energy gap at the target can then yield an arbitrarily large occupation probability of
the target site even for one TF. When this is assumed the interesting question becomes
that of the speed of the search. To address this question various mechanisms, collectively
called facilitated diffusion, were suggested. These combine one dimensional diffusion along
the DNA with three-dimensional diffusion or intersegmental transfers. The combination of
the various search modes has been observed experimentally [16–32] and shown theoretically
to be capable of decreasing the search time significantly [13, 15, 16, 33–57]. More recently
the influence of facilitated diffusion on the noise level in gene regulation was analyzed in
[58, 59].
However, as realized early [60] the assumption of a designed target is far from obvious. In
an alphabet of four letters a target sequence of length 12, quite common in TFs, will occur
with essentially probability one in a random sequence of length ' 107 . Therefore, for target
sequences shorter than 12 bases, identical and almost identical sequences will occur on the
DNA. These competing sites can easily ruin the stability of the target site. Furthermore, as
discussed in detail below, these almost identical sequences act as traps [61] that hinder the
search process and lead to an antagonism between the stability of the TF at the target site
and the speed of the target location. This problem, raised in [18], is commonly referred to
as the speed-stability paradox.
Recently, motivated by new experiments there has been renewed interest in this rather
old problem. To date there are now several reviews (some very recent) which cover different
aspects of the problem [14, 15, 62–65]. We believe that this review complements these and
presents the problem using a somewhat new angle. To this end we give an overview of the
1

Chemical energy could lead to directed motion. This scenario is discussed in [7]).

4
current status of the speed-stability paradox and its implications on regulation dynamics.
We present the problem using both theoretical considerations and experimental data. As we
argue it is preposterous to group all TFs in a single class [66]. Different search mechanisms
are likely to apply to different proteins grouping them into different classes. We show that
three broad classes can be defined, which we term gapped, marginally gapped and nongapped transcription factors. The applicability of previously suggested search mechanisms
to each of the groups is analyzed in some detail. Using this we turn to discuss in detail
a recently proposed barrier controlled search mechanism [67] which can in principle resolve
the speed-stability paradox for all classes of proteins. The possibility of such a mechanism
suggests that experiments should also probe activation barriers and not, as commonly done,
binding energies (see discussion below). Moreover, this mechanism allows for a rich transient
behavior and for transcription factors which are efficient despite binding and unbinding
rapidly from the target.
The structure of the review is as follows: In Section II we discuss in detail the energetics
associated with protein-DNA interaction. We argue for the classification of transcription
factors into the three classes defined above. The classification is illustrated using experimental data. In Section III we review the kinetics of simple search mechanisms which have
been discussed in the literature. In Section IV we introduce the speed-stability paradox
and its possible resolution for each class of TFs. In Section V we introduce and analyze
in detail the barrier controlled search mechanism. In Section VI an effective model for the
barrier controlled search mechanism is introduced and used to study transient behaviors.
We summarize the results in Sec. VII.
II.

PROTEIN-DNA ENERGETICS

Due to the sequences heterogeneity of the non-target DNA the binding energy of a protein
to a DNA is location dependent. The structure of this disordered, non-specific, energy
landscape is crucial for understanding the stability of a TF at its target site and which
search strategies can or cannot be efficient. To this end, in this Section we consider the
energy landscape both from a theoretical point of view and by looking at experimental data.
Throughout what follows we use units where kB T = 1.
Equilibrium measurements [68] reveal that to a good approximation the binding energy,

U (s), of a transcription factor which binds to a sequence of lp bases s = s1 , s2 , ..., slp on
the DNA is given by [35]
lp
X
U (s) =
E (si , i) .
(1)
i=1

Here si = A, T, C, G is the nucleotide type on the ith binding location of the protein and lp
is the number of binding sites on the protein (see Fig. 1). The binding energies E (s, i) are
usually estimated experimentally by measuring the probability, Pr (s, i), that a nucleotide
s is bound to a location i on the protein in equilibrium in vitro experiments. Namely, one
uses

e−E(s,i)

Pr (s, i) =

e−E(s ,i) .

The matrix Pr (s, i) has 4 × lp elements and is called the weight matrix (also known as
Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) or "profile"). It is important to note that these

probabilities are measured only for sequences which are close in structure to the target site2 .
The reason for this lies in the existence of other conformations of the protein-DNA complex
which we will allude to later [69]. In Fig. 2 we illustrate a sample binding energy probability
distribution for several E. coli proteins.
The structure of the binding energy implies that it can be described by three parameters
instead of the 4lp entries. Specifically, the energy is a sum of contributions (see Eq. (1))
which can be assumed independent, if the DNA sequence is uncorrelated, and can therefore
be modeled to a good approximation by a Gaussian random variable. (The assumption that
the DNA sequence is uncorrelated is believed to be true for coding DNA and in particular
for prokaryotic DNA3 .) The validity of this approximation is illustrated for several proteins
in Fig. 3. As can be seen it holds for energies above the target energy, UT , which is defined
as the lowest possible binding energy of the TF to any sequence. Explicitly, the probability
density of finding a given binding energy U for non-target sequences is well approximated

The statistical properties of the binding energy are now encoded by σU and UT and the mean
binding energy which we set to be zero. Note, that the Gaussian form is unchanged even if

Since the binding probability is measured only in places close to the target sequence on a finite sample
there are cases where one or more of the letters does not appear. To correct for this the probability
P
of a letter to appear at a given site is derived from (ns + 1/4)/(1 + ns ), where ns is the number of
s

occurrences of the letter s. This, standard procedure, ensured that when no measurements are made the
probability is 1/4.
Algebraic correlations have been claimed to be observed in non-coding DNA [70, 71]

one allows for corrections to the weight matrix which depend, say, on near-neighbor configurations, as suggested in [72–75]. The assumption that the DNA sequence is uncorrelated also
implies that the binding energies Ui and Uj at different sites i and j are independent. Strictly
speaking this holds only for |i − j| > lp . In what follows we neglect these, unimportant,
short range correlations.
Another quantity which is important for understanding the binding is the minimal energy,
Umin ≥ UT , which occurs randomly on a typical DNA sequence among the non-target
sites. This site competes most strongly with the target site. In a sequence of N  1
uncorrelated base pairs, it is narrowly distributed (with a variance scaling as 1/ ln N ) and
well approximated by [76]

For a given DNA length, N , Umin , UT and σU characterize the binding properties of a
TF. This naturally leads to three classes of transcription factors (see Fig. 2 for a schematic
illustration).
a. Gapped transcription factors. In this case there is a significant gap between the
lowest non-target energy, Umin , and the target energy, UT . Namely,
√
Umin ' −σU 2 ln N
(8)
and
√
UT < −σU 2 ln N .

(9)

b. Marginally gapped transcription factors. Here there is no energetic gap between the
target and the rest of the DNA but the number of sites with an energy close to UT is small
(of the order of one). This happens when

7
√
Umin ' UT ' −σU 2 ln N .

(10)

c. Non-gapped transcription factors. In this case there is no energetic gap between the
target and the rest of the DNA and the number of sites with an energy close to the target
one is large. This happens when
√
Umin ' UT > −σU 2 ln N .
(11)
Note that within the additive binding energy model, Eq. (1), the possible existence of a
gapped TF is directly related to its length. In that case
UT = lp Ec

(12)

where Ec < 0 is the average lowest binding energy per base and
σU2 =

lp Ec2
.
3

(13)

Here we assumed that each base appears with equal probability along the DNA. Then Eq.
(9) implies that to produce an energetic gap between UT and Umin a TF has to be long
enough. Namely, one finds
2
lp > ln N .
(14)
3
This has a particularly simple interpretation. It is equivalent to demanding that on a DNA
sequence, of length N , sites which are identical to the target site do not appear randomly
so that 1/4lp < 1/N . For a typical bacterial DNA length, N = 107 , this gives lp > 11. The
argument can be refined using information theoretic arguments (see Appendix A and for a
similar line of reasoning [66]) to give a stronger bound of lp > 22.
As we discuss below, the structure of the energy landscape, gap existence and the properties of the target have important consequences on the equilibrium probability of finding
the protein on the target and the search time. Interestingly, as we show below, experimental data suggests that there are transcription factors which belong to each of the above
categories.
A.

Target occupation probability in equilibrium

Next, we turn to consider the probability of a TF to be at the target, P T , in equilibrium.
For TFs which appear in small numbers (as believed to be the case in many examples [8])
this quantity has to be of the order of one for proper control over gene expression. Otherwise,
assuming equilibration (we discuss other scenarios later), the TF has to be present in a large
copy number. Naively P T will be of the order of one as long as the TF is gapped. As we
now show this is not guaranteed and we outline the conditions for this to occur. We ignore
the free-energy contribution from configurations where the protein is off the DNA. These
can only hamper the stability at the target.
In equilibrium to ensure P T close to one the partition function has to be dominated by

8
the target energy. Namely, for stability we require

Note, that as standard in disordered systems, this can be different from the average partition

We therefore identify
two regimes: large disorder strength σU  2 ln N and small disorder
√
strength σU  2 ln N . Note, that the physics is very close to that of the Random Energy
Model (REM) [77].
√
For large disorder strength σU  2 ln N , which corresponds to the frozen phase of the
REM, gapped TFs or marginally gapped TFs are stable on the target. Together with the
definitions (9)-(10), this condition reads
√
UT ≤ −σU 2 ln N .
(18)
To satisfy the stability requirement in the small disorder case, which corresponds to a system
above the freezing point of the REM, it is required that
UT ≤ − ln N − σU2 /2 ,

(19)

so that only gapped TFs can be stable on the target. Using the additive binding model,

so that UT = lp Ec and σU2 = lp3Ec implies that the small disorder regime corresponds to

lp  6 E
and the stability condition translates in this case to the constraint

−Ec (1 + Ec /6)

(20)

This is possible only for −Ec < 6. As expected the bound on lp grows when Ec approaches
zero.
Note that for both large and small disorder strengths, the larger N , the more stringent
the condition on UT . With Ec of the order of −1 the above conditions give lp ≥ 16 for
small disorder and lp ≥ 32 for large disorder. We comment, that in principle a simple way
to satisfy the conditions (18) or (19), is for example to introduce large enough cooperative

9
interactions between different TF’s binding domains. In this case the binding energy is not
additive so that Eq. (1) is not valid. These can single out the target and generate an
arbitrarily large gap between the target and the rest of DNA sites.
In summary, TFs with non-gapped targets cannot be stabilized on their targets.
Marginally gapped TFs can be stabilized on their targets if the disorder strength is large
enough. Below, we show that this requirement gives rise to a conflict with the speed of the
target location. A gapped TF is stable on its target when the disorder strength is large, or in
the small disorder regime if it is large enough (or if cooperative effects are present). Without
any cooperative interaction between different TF’s parts, such a gap may be achieved in both
small and large disorder regimes for reasonable TF’s length (for a biochemically reasonable
energy scale of about 1). Below we show that combining these requirements with another
set of constraints related to the speed of the search gives much more stringent conditions on
the length of the protein.
B.

Experimental data

In recent years much experimental data has been accumulated. Specifically the weight
matrix has been measured for many TFs. We now use data from RegulonDB [78] which
contains 89 weight matrices to try and single out the different classes of proteins discussed
theoretically above. As we proceed to show, the three classes can be identified in the data.
Three examples are shown in Fig. 3. These correspond to a gapped (Fig. 3(a)), marginally
gapped (Fig. 3(b)) and non-gapped (Fig. 3(c)) proteins.
To analyze the stability of all the proteins in the database we look at several quantities.
(i) Their minimal possible binding energy UT = U (s∗ ), where s∗ is defined to be the target of
the protein. (ii) The minimal binding energy on a typical disordered sequence of length N ,
Umin = U (s† ), where s† is the strongest binder on the sequence. (iii) The standard deviation
σU for the different proteins and finally (iv) the occupation probability at the target, P T .
Some of the results presented below are demonstrated in Appendix A using the language of
information theory (for a related discussion see [66]).
It is useful to present that data by plotting Umin and UT as a function of σU (see Fig. 4).
Each protein on the graph is represented by two points with the same abscissa. The graph
shows several interesting features.
(i) First, as expected, a significant part (about three fourth) of the TFs are gapped with
a gap size ranging from a few kB T to about 20kB T . A histogram of the gap size is shown
in Fig. 3(d). As stated above such gapped proteins are stable only when the gap is large
enough, see Eqs. (19) and (18).
√ For an E. coli DNA length this requires UT < −15 in the
small disorder regime (σU  2 ln N ' 5.5) and UT < −30 in the large disorder regime
(σU  5.5). Note that indeed for σ ≥ 5.5 a large fraction of the values of UT are below −30
and therefore correspond to stable TFs. The stability criterions for both small (Eq. (19))
and large (Eq. (18)) disorder strengths are shown in Fig. 5 and indicate that most proteins
with a large gap are stable. Note also that the theoretical prediction for Umin (shown in Fig.
4) fits reasonably well with the experimental results.
(ii) Second, for about one fourth of the TFs UT ' Umin . This indicates that they are
either non-gapped or marginally gapped. Recall that for such proteins
√ a minimal criterion
for being stable at the target is that the disorder is large (σU ≥ 2 ln N ' 5.5). This
does not seem to be satisfied for most of the marginally gapped proteins. Therefore, Fig. 4
hints that most of the non gapped and marginally gapped TFs are actually unstable on the

target. This is more clearly illustrated in Fig. 6 which shows that indeed about one quarter
of the proteins have a very small probability (less than 10−1 with about half of them with
a probability less than 10−2 ) for being on the target. This indicates that non gapped and
marginally gapped TFs seem to break the stability requirement. We return to these proteins
later and suggest that either non-equilibrium effects or large copy numbers could stabilize
them on the target.
It is interesting to present the same data, but instead of as a function of σU , as a function
of lp . This is shown in Figs. 7 and 8. As is clearly seen there is a close relation between
the existence of a gap and lp being large enough. In fact, in agreement with our simple
arguments, a gap begins to form at lp ' 13. The data for P T as a function of lp is even more
striking. Essentially all proteins with a binding site of size lp ' 13 or smaller are unstable
on the target while those with lp ' 16 or larger are mostly stable at the target. The close
correspondence between lp and the gap is a direct result of a similar binding energy per base
for all TFs.
The above discussion focused on the stability characteristics. We identified several distinct classes of TFs based on their stability properties. An important question for transcrip-

tion factors is their speed of operation. The discussion above suggests that different TFs
could have different search strategies. Before attempting to map these out in what follows
we first review the different possible reactive pathways which have been suggested in the
literature.
III.

THE SEARCH DYNAMICS

Before discussing the reactive pathways it is useful to have a simple picture of DNA
packing in prokaryotic cells. In typical systems the DNA has a total length of L ∼ 106 nm, a
persistence length L0 ∼ 50nm, a cross section radius ρ ∼ 1nm, and is contained in a volume
of Λ3 ∼ 109 nm3 . The typical distance between segments of DNA of length L0 is therefore
Λ3
 L30 . Under these conditions, using Λ  L0 , it is easy to
much smaller than L0 : L/L
0
q
check that the radius of gyration of free DNA, which is of the order of L0 LL0 is much larger
than the cell size Λ - the DNA is densely packed even though its fractional volume in the
container Lρ2 /Λ3 , is small (about one percent). By way of comparison, typical protein sizes
are in the range R∼1 − 10nm, much smaller than the DNA’s persistence length.
To quantify the search process one needs to estimate the time it takes the protein, from its
initial production, to activate (or repress) its target site. Early works considered a perfectly
reactive target. In this case the search efficiency can be quantified by studying the statistical
properties of the first-passage time to the target [79–81]. In this section we focus on the

in the problem.
For a cell to properly function the search process has to, typically, be of the order of
seconds. In principle, when the target is perfectly reactive this can be achieved by a search
which is driven by pure three dimensional diffusion. However, driven by experimental results,

mostly on the Lac repressor [82, 83], which seem to give search times that are faster than
three-dimensional diffusion, various search strategies were suggested. We now give simple
arguments that quantify these different search strategies. For a similar discussion see [37, 43].
A.

Searching with three-dimensional diffusion

Naively, one might expect the protein to search for its target (or, equivalently, its specific
binding site on the DNA) using only three-dimensional diffusion. Neglecting interactions of
the protein with the environment and the DNA (apart from the target site), one then finds,
using results first obtained by Smoluchowski [84] or by dimensional analysis, that the search
time, tsearch , defined as the mean first-passage time at the target, is given by:
tsearch ∼

Λ3
.
D3 r

(21)

Here D3 is the three-dimensional diffusion constant of the protein, r is the target size, and
Λ3 is the volume that needs to be searched. Assuming a target size of the order of a base-pair
r ≈ 0.34nm, a typical nucleus (or bacterium) size as above and using the measured three-

dimensional diffusion coefficient for a GFP protein in vivo, D3 ∼ 107 nm2 /s [85], one finds
tsearch of the order of hundreds of seconds. We comment that r can be increased significantly
by changing the electrostatic interactions between the protein and its target, for example,
by changing the salt concentration.
These long time scales can be easily reduced if several proteins are searching for the
target. Namely, if np proteins are searching for the same target the average search time
is given by 4 tsearch
' tsearch /np . This suggests that about 10 proteins could find a target
np
in reasonable time for cells to function properly. As we discuss below this simple relation
between the search time of one protein and np proteins can fail in some cases.
B.

Searching with one-dimensional diffusion

In real systems, due to the interactions of proteins with non-specific DNA sequences
and the environment [86], the picture is more complex. Indeed, in vitro experiments have
suggested that mechanisms other than three-dimensional diffusion are used by many proteins
to locate their targets. The simplest extension of the pure three-dimensional diffusive search
is using three dimensional diffusion to reach the DNA and then scan it using one-dimensional
diffusion along its contour. This follows closely ideas of Delbruck and Adam [33], introduced
in a different context. If the DNA is very long the search time is clearly controlled by the

for np proteins remains

the search time the dependence on np is more sensitive.

Here L ∼ 106 nm is the genome length and D1 is the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient
that was measured indirectly [16] and directly [26, 27] to be much smaller than the threedimensional diffusion coefficient D3 ∼ 107 nm2 /s [85]. Effects of disorder can be incorporated
into an effective value of D1 [37] (see discussion below). The above result renders this search
strategy useless for long DNA. However, if the sequence scanned is short then it is easy to
see that the search time is given by

Using the numbers cited above it is easy to check that search times of the order of a 100
sec (so that about 10 proteins can find the target within seconds) can be obtain as long as
L, the length of the sequence scanned is smaller than 104 nm, about 30 kilobases long. The
results are mildly modified if the sequence has a globular shape.
C.

Facilitated diffusion

Motivated by experiments [82, 83] an extension of the Delbruck and Adam model was
suggested in [13]. The model combines one-dimensional diffusion (sliding) along the DNA
which is interrupted by periods of three dimensional diffusion (typically called jumping or
hopping in this context). This combined strategy, called facilitated diffusion, has been
studied and debated extensively both in the context of in vivo [13, 27, 37, 43, 44] and in
vitro systems [13, 15, 16, 39, 41–43, 87, 88]. There is now a large body of evidence that
such a mechanism plays an important role for several TFs. It is illustrated in Fig. 9 and is
believed to speed the search process.
Each of the individual search mechanisms described above, when applied alone, has shortcomings and advantages over the other. When using only three-dimensional diffusion, the
number of distinct three dimensional positions probed grows linearly in time but the protein spends much time probing sites where there is no DNA present. In contrast, during
a one-dimensional diffusion the protein is constantly bound to the DNA but suffers from
a slow increase in the number of distinct positions probed as a function of time (∼ t1/2 ,
where t denotes time) [89]. It is known that by intertwining one and three dimensional
search strategies and tuning the properties of both one can in fact decrease the search time
significantly [13].
The discussion below follows Refs. [15] and [37] closely. We imagine a single protein
searching for a single target located on the DNA. The search is composed of a series of
intervals of one-dimensional diffusion along the DNA (sliding) and three-dimensional diffusion in the solution (jumping). The mean time of each is denoted by τ1 and τ3 respectively.
Following a jump, the protein is assumed to associate on a new randomly chosen location
along the DNA. Note that one might be worried if the structure of the packed DNA molecule
invalidates this approach. Numerics on typical frozen DNA conformations indicate that as
long as average search times are considered the structure can be ignored [90]. Nonethe-

less much more complicated structures may arise in nature (for example, in eukaryotic cells
[43, 91–93]) and these are ignored in the discussion below.
Under the√
above assumptions, during each sliding event the protein covers a typical length

rounds of sliding and jumping are needed on average. While this can be intuitively understood since the correlations between the locations of the protein before and after the
jump are neglected the exact nature of the relation is in fact somewhat more subtle. As
shown in [38] the average length scanned before the target is reached is half the total length.
Nonetheless for the average search time the expression is exact in the large L limit. The
total time needed to find a specific site is then:
tsearch = Nr τr ,

(25)

where τr = τ1 + τ3 is the typical time of a round. Using Eqs. (24) and (25) one obtains

As shown in [80] this result holds up to a logarithmic correction which diverges as the DNAs

It is natural to ask which τ1 optimizes tsearch when τ3 is held fixed. Using Eq. (26) it is
easy to verify that

It can be shown that this result is exact √

consider an optimal antenna size lopt = 2D1 τ3 . When this condition is met, the total

Note that the L dependence is obtained by optimizing, say τ1 , as L is varied. This model,
at the optimal τ1 and assuming known values for D1 , L and τ3 , predicts reasonable search
times in vivo and is commonly believed to give a possible explanation for the efficiency of
the target location process in experiments.
The combined strategy, while better than the pure three-dimensional or one-dimensional
search strategies, comes at a cost of being sensitive to changes in the properties of either the
three-dimensional or the one-dimensional diffusive processes. Given the many constraints
on the protein to function, it is restrictive to demand an optimization of the search process.
Specifically, within the model an optimal search process requires fine tuning of the antenna
size, l, as a function of the parameters D1 and τ3 . These parameters depend on various
cell and environmental conditions such as the size of the cell, the DNA length, the ionic
strength etc. The dependence can be quite significant: for example, the parameter τ3 /τ1
has been argued to have an exponential dependence on the square root of the ionic strength
[94]. Deviations of this

time since tsearch = 2
+ ττ13 . Indeed, a strong dependence of the search time on the
τ1
opt

ionic strength was found in in vitro experiments [83].
Interestingly, in vivo, when the DNA is densely packed, no effect of the ionic strength
on the efficiency of the Lac repressor was revealed [95]. Other experiments also suggest
that τ1 is not optimized. In particular, equilibrium measurements [96], as well as recent
single molecule experiments [26, 27], find a value of τ1 for the Lac repressor that is much
larger than the predicted optimum τ3 in vivo. The lack of sensitivity to the ionic strength in
vivo and the rapid search times found for the Lac repressor, even with very large values of
τ1 , suggest that other processes, apart from jumping and sliding, are involved in the search
process. These seem to be more important in vivo than in vitro. One such mechanism which
was suggested to speed the search time is intersegmental transfers (IT) [97, 98]. During an
IT the protein moves from one site to another by transiently binding both at the same time.
This mechanism is expected to be important for systems with a high DNA density [99].
In principle the new site can be either close along the one-dimensional DNA sequence (or
chemical distance) or distant (see Fig. 9). An analysis shows that the average search time
remains similar to the combined one-dimensional and three-dimensional diffusion described
above but with τ3 which obtains a different dependence on the DNA length. This has been
discussed in detail in [90].
Finally, we comment that in principle all search strategies can be made arbitrarily fast
by increasing the number of searchers. This allows, in principle, any of the above discussed
mechanisms, one-dimensional diffusion, three-dimensional diffusion, facilitated diffusion with

18
or without intersegmental transfers, to be at work for different proteins [100]. This statement, however, becomes more problematic when the stability requirements discussed above
are included. As stated above, it is clear that the TFs also interact with non-target sites so
that pure three dimensional searches are unlikely. This implies that facilitated diffusion is
hard to avoid. To this end, in what follows we analyze in detail the problems which arise
when facilitated diffusion is combined with the stability requirements.
IV.

THE SPEED-STABILITY PARADOX AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

It has been recognized early that there is a tight connection and antagonism between the
stability of the TF at the target and the search speed. The conflict is commonly termed
the speed-stability paradox [18, 37]. As we have seen, the experimental data shows that the
proteins can be classified into several classes. These classes call for different mechanisms.
We begin by introducing the speed-stability paradox and then discuss possible solutions for
each class of proteins.
A.

The speed-stability paradox

Recall that a fast search of one protein (we later return to the case of np proteins and
discuss it in detail) requires a fast one-dimensional diffusion on the DNA. Then note that
the binding energies between the transcription factor and the DNA on each site i, Ui , is an
independent random variable with a Gaussian distribution with a variance σU2 . This disorder
in the binding energies of the protein to different sites implies that this diffusion takes place
on a disordered potential. On long times this leads to an effective diffusion constant whose
value is given by [37]
r
σU2 − 7 σU2
D1 = D1 (σU = 0) 1 +
e 4 .
(30)
2
The important thing to note is the exponential dependence of the diffusion coefficient on
up to prefactors by recalling that the diffusion is an activated
σU2 . It can be understood
´
−U
process so that D1 ∝ dU e P r(U ) . This implies that even for σU = 5.5 (the boarder line
between the small and the large disorder regimes for an E. coli genome) the one-dimensional
diffusion constant becomes 19 orders of magnitude smaller than the diffusion constant on a
flat energy landscape. This in turn leads to a very slow search process. Essentially, speed
requirements prohibit the large disorder regime discussed above. For the search to be fast
σU has to be kept small, of the order of 0.5, to ensure a diffusion coefficient of the same
order as that on a flat energy landscape.
On the other hand, this requirement conflicts with the stability requirements for proteins
which demand (see section II A) either a large value of σU (for marginally gapped and
gapped TFs), or a large TF length lp (for gapped TFs in the small disorder regime), to
create a significant gap between the energy at the target and the rest of the DNA. From the
analysis above, a priori only gapped TFs might satisfy both speed and stability requirements.
Below we analyze in detail the speed and stability requirements for gapped and marginally
gapped TFs and discuss possible solutions of the paradox.
More puzzling are non-gapped proteins which are unstable at the target. A new possible
mechanism which ensures both speed and stability for those is discussed in later sections.

19
B.

Possible solutions of the speed-stability paradox for gapped, marginally gapped
and non-gapped TFs.
1.

Gapped TFs

In principle both speed and stability requirements can be easily satisfied using, for example, cooperative interactions on the target sequence and small σU for the rest of the sequence.
In this case, when the TF is clearly gapped, the binding energy at the target can be made
arbitrarily low without affecting the value σU .
However, as stated above the experimental data seem to suggest no significant cooperative
effect such that UT = lp Ec where as above lp is the length of the target and Ec is the average
(over different binding sites of the protein) minimal binding energy. Since Ec depends on
σU it is not clear how both requirements on speed and stability can be satisfied. As argued
above the speed requirement demands (see Eq. 30)
7

2

e− 4 σU ∼ 1 ,

(31)

which prohibits σU to be in the large disorder regime. Following the discussion above this
rules out the stability of marginally gapped and non gapped targets. As before we assume
that the probability of a mismatch is 3/4 and using our convention that hU i = 0 we have
2
σU2 = lp3Ec . The stability requirement in the small disorder regime is, using Eq. (17),

For N ∼ 107 one may check that both the stability criterion and the speed requirement, Eq.
(31), can only be met for lp > 70. This argument suggests that both speed and stability
requirements demand a very large target size. The database studied above does not contain
proteins of that size 5 .
2.

Two-state models

The previous solution relies on having a gapped TF. Another possible resolution of the
speed-stability paradox, which applies also to marginally gapped TFs, lies in introducing
another conformation of the DNA-TF complex. This conformation, usually attributed to
non-specific binding, modifies the properties of the energy landscape experienced by the
5

However, during the process of the homologous recognition the length of the searcher and the target may
be much larger [6]

20
protein during its one dimensional diffusion. Specifically, it was suggested [18, 35, 37] that
another conformation may introduce an effective cutoff on the TF-DNA binding energy
distribution which will lower its variance and hence lead to a quick one-dimensional diffusion
thus resolving the speed-stability paradox.
The two-state model assumes that the protein (or protein-DNA complex) switches rapidly
between its two conformations so that the two can be assumed to be equilibrated. We assume
that in the first non-specific conformation the protein has a constant binding energy, Uns , on
all sites and that in the second, specific conformation the binding energy, Ui , is, as before,
an independent random variable with a Gaussian distribution (3) with a variance σU2 . The
total free energy on site i is then given by [35]

Gi = − ln e−Uns + e−Ui ' min (Uns , Ui ) .
(34)
Therefore the probability distribution of the total free energy has a cutoff as discussed above
and is given by

Clearly by tuning the value of Uns the resulting free energy landscape can be made flat on
most of the DNA allowing for a fast one-dimensional diffusion. This happens roughly when
the protein is mostly in the non-specific conformation, which yields a first constraint:
2
σU



e−Uns > e−Ui = e 2 .

(36)

This procedure can not be carried out in an arbitrary manner as very low values of Uns
might destroy the stability of the target. To avoid this the non-specific energy Uns also has
to obey a second constraint
N e−Uns < e−UT ,
(37)
where UT , as before, is the target binding energy.
For marginally-gapped TFs these conditions are very restrictive and demand fine tuning:
√
σU ' 2 ln N .
(38)
Clearly, most marginally gapped TFs do not satisfy this constraint (see Fig. 4).
For gapped-TFs the constraint is not as severe. It is easy to see that here we need
− UT > σU2 /2 + ln N .

(39)

Within the additive binding energy model this implies that lp ≥ c ln N where c is a constant
which depend on Ec . It is interesting to check this criterion, which is actually the same as
demanding stability of a one state TF in the small disorder regime (see Eq. 19) using the
protein weight matrices. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Note that more than half the
proteins do not satisfy the criterion. For these the two state model presented above does
not seem to apply.
This gives a clear condition on when this mechanism alone is sufficient to resolve the
speed stability paradox. Recently, such a cutoff was measured in a eukaryotic transcription

21
factor [69]. However, the nonspecific binding energy was estimated to be only 5kB T larger
than the target energy. The fraction of the time that the protein would spend on the target
having such a small energy gap is of the order of e5 /N . In a eukaryotic cell, where one
typically has N ∼ 1010 , such a gap looks inexplicably low.
Finally, we comment that all the above considerations ignore the free-energy associated
with the protein being off the DNA. At the optimal antenna size (see Sec. III C) this has
the same contribution as the non-specifically bound state. As mentioned above, it can only
reduce the stability on the target.
3.

Multiple TFs

In this subsection we assume a single state TF model and comment on the applicability
of the results to two-state models at the end. An easy resolution to the slow search speed is
increasing the copy number of each TF. When np TFs are searching for the target the mean
search time is reduced by a factor of np (for cases where this does not apply see Sec. V). For
2
facilitated diffusion the disorder increases the mean search time by a factor of about eσU /2 .
2
Therefore, np ' eσU /2 TFs can compensate for the effects of the disorder.
Multiple TFs may also fulfill the stability requirements since the occupation probability
of the target increases with np . Ignoring interaction between TFs copies the occupation
probability of the target, namely the probability to find at least one TF at the target, is
given by

np
P T (np ) = 1 − 1 − P T (np = 1) .
(40)

Namely, by taking np to be larger than 1/P T (np = 1) the occupation probability of the
target becomes of order of one, so that one satisfies the stability requirement.
However, there is a worry that by increasing the number of TF copies the specificity
will be reduced. Namely, the TFs will activate or repress other genes by tightly binding to
unwanted sequences on the DNA. Consider the case when in addition to the target there are
Nd “dangerous” sites. A site is defined as dangerous if a significant occupation probability
of this site affects the transcription of a non-target gene. It seems reasonable to take Nd to
be of the same order of magnitude as the total length (in base-pairs) of all DNA promoters.
We assume that the binding energy distribution of the dangerous part of the DNA is the
same as the rest of the DNA.
The
√ lowest energy among Nd dangerous sites on a typical sequence is given by
−σU 2 ln Nd so that the occupation probability of the most occupied dangerous site, for a
one TF case, is given by
√
eσU 2 ln Nd
Pd (np = 1) ' N
(41)
P −U
i
e
i=1

while in the case of np proteins the occupation probability of the most occupied dangerous
site is
Pd (np ) = 1 − [1 − Pd (np = 1)]np .
(42)
Thus to ensure that the dangerous part is not significantly occupied np has to be much
smaller than 1/Pd (np = 1).
In sum, three conditions limit the possible value of the TF copy number.

Of course, these ignore the obvious but hard to quantify, cost involved in the production of
the TFs.
In Appendix C we analyze these conditions in detail. We find that a large copy number
can resolve the speed and stability issues without affecting specificity only in the small
disorder regime. Finally, we comment that similar considerations hold also for the two state
model discussed above. In that case the specificity condition becomes more stringent for
large Nd while for small Nd they are less stringent. Moreover, one can check that adding
np TFs only eases the criterion given in Eq. 39 by a ln np term (where we assume that
the criterion on the speed in the two state model is unchanged). This can help the search
process only for very large np values.
V. SEARCH AND RECOGNITION BASED ON A BARRIER
DISCRIMINATION – EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE TIME SCALES

In the previous sections we saw that many proteins have a low occupation probability at
the target. Moreover, demanding that the protein reaches the target quickly posed many
more constraints on, for example, the length of the protein recognition site and the number
of proteins searching for the target. For about ten percent of the proteins the problem seems
particularly severe. Their occupation probability is so low that they demand thousands of
TFs for a high occupation probability. In what follows we suggest a new mechanism which,
in principle, may apply to any of the classes above. In particular in the next section we
show how it applies even to TFs with a very low occupation probability through what we
call transient stability.
The model assumes that the protein-DNA complex can assume two conformations.
Namely, when the protein is bound to the DNA, it can switch between two conformations
separated by a free energy barrier. A closely related model was introduced in previous works
in order to solve the speed-stability paradox (see Section IV B 2 and Refs. [35, 37, 101]). In
these works the barrier between the two states of the protein was assumed to be low enough
so that the two conformations were equilibrated with each other. Moreover, the barrier
was assumed to be a constant for all DNA sites. A two state structure was demonstrated
experimentally in transcription factors [102–105] and type II restriction endonucleases (for
a review see Ref. [106]). Furthermore, there are simple theoretical arguments for their
existence [107].
In contrast to the two state model discussed above and in previous studies, here an
important role is played by a difference in the association rates to different DNA sites. As

we show, and intuitively clear, this may supply an additional discriminating factor. Some
evidence for the possible importance of association rates is found in the purine repressor.
There it was shown that, when activated, it changes its association rate to the target by
two orders of magnitude while the dissociation rate changes only by one order of magnitude
[108]. Note, that the association rate may be very large with a small binding energy and
vice-versa. Differences between association rates to different DNA sites were also observed
in Refs. [109] and [102]. Interestingly in the latter work association rates which correspond
to very high energetic barriers of tens of kB T were observed, albeit for eukaryotic cells.
Assuming two conformations, we call one the search state. In this conformation the
protein is loosely bound to the DNA and can slide along it. In the second, recognition state,
it is trapped in a deep energetic well (see Fig. 10). Note that equilibrium measurements of
binding energies to the DNA are controlled by the recognition state. To make the discussion
clear, below we analyze search processes where the recognition is only based on barrier
discrimination. This implies that equilibrium properties of the target site are identical to
those of non-target sites.
Based on a quantitative analysis of this model, we argue that due to the occurrence of
several time scales in the search process the widely used definition of the reaction rate of a
single protein as the inverse of the average search time tave [110], is generally irrelevant as a
measure of the efficiency of target location on DNA. When np proteins are searching for the
target, the relevant quantity is the probability Rnp (t) for a reaction to occur before time t.
We show below that Rnp (t) can reach values close to one on a time scale ttyp
np which can be
orders of magnitude smaller than the average search time, tave
.
Both
the
typical and the
np
average search times can be orders of magnitude smaller than the naive approach based on
a one time scale assumption which gives tave /np .
Our analysis has several important merits. First, it reports a fast search time despite a
very strong binding of the protein in the recognition state to any site on the DNA. This
renders the question of stability in the recognition state irrelevant. We suggest that within
this model the measured binding energies of proteins to the DNA are irrelevant to the kinetics
of the search process; the relevant quantities are transition rates (specified below). Second,
we show that with a proper choice of parameters one may solve the speed-stability paradox

24
without designing the target. We make two comments. (i) While there is no equilibrium
stability within this model it will be shown that the protein is present on the target site
for an extended period of time. (ii) Within this model the kinetics are independent of the
equilibrium properties. Therefore, it is straightforward to add equilibrium stability within
it.
The model consists of np proteins which can each be in three states : (i) an unbound
state, u, in which it performs three-dimensional diffusion (jumping), (ii) a search state, s,
where it is weakly bound to the DNA, performing one-dimensional diffusion (sliding) and
(iii) a recognition state, r, where it is tightly bound to the DNA6 . We assume, for simplicity,
that in the recognition state the protein is trapped in a deep energy well (as justified by the
experimentally measured strong binding energies) and is unable to move [37]. The transition
rates, λis , λir , λb and λu , between the different states are defined in Fig. 10. To model sliding,
in the s state the protein can move with transition rate λ0 /2 to neighboring sites on the
DNA. Note that the transition rates λir and λis are expected in general to depend on the
location i = 1 . . . N along the DNA. In principle λ0 and λu also have a dependence on i. As
justified later this will have a weaker effect on our results and we omit it for clarity. Finally,
after a jump we assume that the protein relocates to a random position on the DNA due to
its packed conformation [90].
The presentation of the model gives many details of the derivations of the results. However, we have made an effort to end each subsection with a highlight of the main results.
Furthermore, some subsection focus only on results.

To gain an understanding of the difference between the two time scales ttyp
np , tnp and the
naive estimation tave /np we first consider a single searcher, np = 1, in a simplified model
where the transition rates λir = λr and λis = λs are independent of i except at the target site
T (see Fig. 11(a)). The target site in this section is designed such that the transition rates
on the target are different from the transition rates on the rest of DNA. At the target site
the transition rate from the s state to the r state is denoted by λTr and the transition rate
from the r state to the s state is denoted by λTs (λTs is irrelevant for the calculation of the
first-passage time properties). As stated above, in our considerations we analyze a process
of search and recognition based only on a barrier discrimination and P T = 1/N . Therefore,
the relation

that the protein finds its target before time t, where P (t) is the distribution of the first6

of P (t) can be obtained exactly. For simplicity we take a centered target site (labeled 0).
Consider, first, the joint probability density for a protein to find the target (in its r state)
at time t = ts + tr starting from a location x0 at t = 0 before unbinding from the DNA.
Here ts is the total time spent in the s state and tr is the total time spent in the r state.
The probability that exactly n transitions occurred from the s state to the r state is given
by P (n, λr , ts ) where
P(n, µ, t) = (µt)n e−µt /n!
(49)
is a Poisson distribution. The probability to spent a time tr in the r state given that n
transitions occurred from the s state to the r state is λs P (n − 1, λs , tr ) (with the convention
P(−1, µ, t) ≡ δ(t)/µ). The probability to stay on the DNA up to time t = ts + tr starting
at t = 0 is given by e−λu ts . Finally, the probability to cross the barrier at the target at each
visit of its s state is given by
p1 =

λTr

1 + λu /λ0 + λTr /λ0

Therefore, the joint probability density for a protein to find the target at time t = ts + tr

26
starting from a location x0 at t = 0 before unbinding from the DNA is
Pn (ts , tr |x0 ) = λs P (n − 1, λs , tr ) P (n, λr , ts ) jp1 (ts |x0 ) e−λu ts ,

(51)

where jp1 (t|x0 ) is the FPT density at the target x = 0 for a usual random walk starting
from x0 given that the probability to cross the barrier at the target at each visit in its s
state is p1 . The FPT density before unbinding starting from x0 then reads:

Eq. (67) is a central result of this Section. We show below that a similar two exponents
structure appears also in the disordered case. The short time scale τ1 characterizes searches
where the protein never enters the r state and is therefore independent of the binding energy
Er (and hence of λs ). The time scale τ2 characterizes searches where the protein enters the
r state, and is therefore much larger than τ1 in the case of strong binding (λs small). In
turn, q is the probability of an event where the target is found without falling into a trap.
Expression (67) enables an explicit determination of tave = qτ1 + (1 − q)τ2 and the typical
search time ttyp . For convenience we define ttyp through

This choice of the typical time (in contrast to, say, the half life time of an unoccupied target R t1/2 = 12 )
has the advantage of being equal to the average time for a simple exponential decay case.

We stress that experimentally, the relevant time, where almost all search processes end,
is ttyp and not tave . In the regime λr  λu κ/N , one has ttyp ' tave ' τ2 . A difference
between ttyp and tave emerges as λr is decreased and in the limit λr  λu κ/N we find that
ttyp ' τ1 /(2q − 1) (with q ' 1) is independent of λs . This shows that for DNA lengths
N ≤ λu κ/λr , the typical search time is significantly smaller than the average even in the
presence of deep traps (λs small). This is a direct result of the competition between the two
time scales.
The results, compared with numerics which were performed using a standard continuous
time Gillespie algorithm [113] (see Appendix D for details), are shown in Fig. 12. We
use realistic ranges of parameters (from available experimental data summarized in [66])
which are specified in the caption. Since to the best of our knowledge there are no direct
measurements of the barrier height for different DNA sequences, we assume this quantity
to be of the same order of magnitude as the experimentally measured binding energies [35].
It is found that R(t) reaches a plateau close to one on a typical time scale ttyp which, for
N = 106 , is smaller than the average search time tave by two orders of magnitude. In next
sections we show that results of this simple model may be applied to more realistic models.

30
B.

Several searching proteins

The interesting regime ttyp  tave requires a rather large barrier between the s and r
state in the case of long DNA molecules (namely, λr ≤ λu κ/N ). One might argue that in
general this condition may not be met by all proteins. Despite of this we now argue that this
constraint can be, to a large extent, relaxed when np proteins are searching for the target
simultaneously. In this case even when for a single protein tave ' ttyp the typical search time
ave
ttyp
/np even for relatively small values
np of np proteins can be significantly shorter than t
ave
np ≈ 10 − 15. Here, again, t
is the average search time of a single protein and ttyp
np is
defined as in Eq. 72 where for np proteins the first-passage distribution Pnp (t) is deduced
from the cumulative distribution
Rnp (t) = 1 − (1 − R(t))np .

(74)

In Fig. 13 we show the results for Rnp (t) for np = 10. Note that as claimed above ttyp
np 
tave /np , whereas ttyp is close to tave for one protein. This can be understood as follows. Using
Eqs. (67) and (74), it is obvious that when τ2  τ1 , the decay of Rnp (t) is dominated by
τ1 as long as (1 − q)np  1. In essence since only one protein needs to find the target, the
probability of a catastrophic event where the search time is of the order of τ2 is
pcat = (1 − q)np

(75)

which decays exponentially fast with np . For large enough values of np the short time scale
τ1 controls the behavior of Rnp (t), even if it is insignificant for the one protein search time.
This implies that searches involving several proteins strongly suppress the long time-scales
induced by the traps which control tave . In Section V C the average and typical search times
are calculated for a given values of τ1 , τ2 , q and np .

Calculating the average and typical search times

We showed above that the cumulative FPT distribution is given by

Rnp (t) = 1 − qe−t/τ1 + (1 − q) e−t/τ2

(76)

for the non-disordered model. In this section we calculate the typical and average search
times for given values of q, τ1 and τ2 . In the next section we discuss the disordered model in
detail. As shown the disorder leaves the mathematical structure of the non-disordered case
intact but with effective values of q, τ1 and τ2 . Therefore all the results presented below and
obtained for the non-disordered case can be easily extended to the disordered one.

there is a large range of np values for which ttyp
np  tnp and that they coincide again at very
large values of np . The range of values of np for which the typical and the mean search
times differ scales as ln(τ2 /τ1 ). Remarkably, for small values of np the average search time
decreases faster than exponentially with the protein copy number.
D.

Disordered case

In this section we study a disordered version of the model. Since the barrier plays a key
role in the search we focus on effects of disorder in its height. To account for this we consider

λis = λ0 eEr min 1, e−Eb = λir eEr .
Similar to the affinity properties of the target site that is typically very close to the highest
affinity among the non-target sites (see discussion above), we propose an intrinsic definition
of the target as the site with the lowest barrier with no specifically designed properties (see

33
Fig. 11(b)). Indeed, our previous assumption in Section V A that λTr is large at the target site
and λir small everywhere else is a rather strong demand and corresponds to a designed target.
Although we show below that the barrier discrimination mechanism may supply an efficient
search even for the non-designed target, any special design of the target may significantly
increase the search effectiveness. In the next subsection we analyze the disordered model
using a mean-field approach and check the results using a numerical simulation in Section
V D 2.
1.

Mean-field analysis

Within the mean-field approach we replace the different quantities by their disorder average and account for the barrier at the target site. We first compute the disorder averaged
probability of crossing the barrier at the target at each visit. The probability density of the
barrier height on the target site, EbT , (the probability density of the minimal energy among
N normally distributed identical and independent random variables with a mean E0 and
variance σ 2 ) is [76]

2.

Numerical results and comparison to mean-field analysis

We now check the mean-field results using numerics. First, we show that the two scales
scenario described above still holds. Indeed, Fig. 15 shows that R(t) is well fitted by Eq.
(67) for realistic values of parameters. Note that in Figs. 15 and 16 we have chosen the

34
worst scenario Er = −∞ so that λs = 0 and the average search time and the value of τ2 are
both infinite. This implies that for np large enough the only relevant time scale is τ1 and the
τ1
typical search time again takes the form ttyp
np ' qnp (the detailed calculation of the typical
and average times is presented above in Section V C). This enables a fast search even in the
presence of very deep (even infinite) traps.
The regime of a fast search with ttyp
np independent of the trap depth Er also requires,
as above, a small catastrophe probability, pcat = (1 − q)np (see Eq. 75). We now show
that this condition holds in a wide range of disorder parameters, E0 and σ. To illustrate
this, the dependencies (holding all other variables constant) of pcat and ttyp
np on σ, obtained
from numerics and the mean-field treatment, are shown in Fig. 16 for realistic values of
parameters. Notably, the dependence of the catastrophe probability on the disorder strength
is not monotonic so that the value of pcat can be minimized as a function of σ. This reflects
the fact that for small values of σ the DNA sequence has to be scanned many times before
the target enters in the r mode. Increasing σ lowers the barrier at the target and therefore
reduces the number of scans needed, which diminishes pcat . For larger σ the chance of falling
into a trap increases due to lower secondary minima of the barrier, which leads to an increase
of pcat . As expected, pcat is dramatically decreased when np is increased, even by a few units,
and can remain small for a wide range of values of σ. For larger σ, pcat increases and ttyp
np
rises quickly as it starts to depend on τ2 .
Summarizing and using the results of Section V A, the mean-field approach predicts that
in the high barrier regime λs  λr  λu , λb , λ0 (with λu , λb , λ0 of comparable order) the
reaction probability simplifies to

In the case of a few proteins, searchers that fall into traps tend to occupy sites with low
barriers and, therefore, increase the probability of other TFs to reach the target. Thus, Eq.
(74), in which the searchers are assumed to be independent, provides a lower bound on the
probability to reach the target. Here and below we assume that the number of proteins, np ,
is small enough (compared with N ) such that this effect does not play a role and Eq. (74)
is applicable.
Most important, as advertised above, these results show that it is possible to obtain

Reasonable search times (in the range of seconds) are obtained for a rather large range of σ

of the speed and stability requirements. We stress that this mechanism can apply to any
of the classes of TFs discussed above. This is a direct consequence of the decoupling of the
stability and speed requirements. We note that by moderate changes in E0 similar results
can be obtained for much longer DNA sequences. In Appendix F we show that by increasing

EFFECTIVE MODEL AND OUTCOMES

As we showed in the previous section, by only using a barrier discrimination between
different DNA sites a transcription factor may, in principle, serve as an efficient searcher
and its complex with the target can be arbitrarily stable. Experiments show that different
DNA sites are discriminated by their binding energy. Therefore, if a barrier mechanism is
at work it is likely to be combined with an energetic discrimination between different sites.
Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider a scenario where there is only barrier discrimi-

nation. This could apply for TFs which have a very small target occupation probability P T .
As we now show a barrier mechanism may lead to a high transient occupation probability
of the target even with no energetic discrimination. When active processes are included the
occupation probability can be made large even in the long-time limit. Furthermore, and in
a more speculative manner, we show how the barrier mechanism can lead to a dynamical
ordering of gene activation.
To show these we construct an effective model which uses the simple resulting mathematical structure of the previous section. Specifically, we use the cumulative probability

In our discussion we concentrate on the target occupation probability. This fact and the
simplicity of expression (95) allow one to describe our system using a three states model.
Within this approach we only consider the r state on the target (T ), the r state off the target
(D) and one state for all other configurations (including s states and the unbound state)
(U). The transition rates between the states are defined as follows: λD is the transition rate

−1 is the transition rate from D to U, λ is the transition rate from U to
T
T and λ−1 is the transition rate from T to U. The model is illustrated schematically in
Fig. 17. As shown below, this simplification allows us to analyze the behavior of the system
beyond its FPT properties.
To proceed we, first, show that the effective model yields the same cumulative FPT

As stated above we consider a case where the binding energies of all sites (including the
target) are the same so that in equilibrium the occupation probability of the target site is
equal to the occupation probability of all other sites on the DNA. In this case, in equilibrium
the occupation probability of the D state is N times larger than the occupation probability
of the T state. This implies within the simplified model that

0. These equations may be solved exactly. However, here we analyze the equations by noting
that there are three time regimes. For t  λ1T the occupation probability of the target is
close to its initial value, i.e. P T ' 0. For λ1D  t  λ1T the protein equilibrated with

P T = N1 . Note, however, that there is a transient regime where the occupation probability
is large. In fact, in this regime the TF binds and unbinds many times from the target site
before the system reaches thermal equilibrium.

nU represent the mean-occupation number at the target in the T , D and U respectively. The
numerical solution of this nonlinear equation is shown in Fig. 18. The qualitative behavior
is similar to the np = 1 case: there are three time regimes. Using the same arguments as
the np = 1 case we find that, for t  λT1np we have nT ' 0. For λ1D  t  λT1np we have

The intermediate regime, corresponding to a transient high occupation of the target, exist

when λT np  λD . Its easy to check that for a large enough number of proteins, np  λλT ,
this regime exists even when λT < λD .
Using this analysis we have shown that when the target site differs from the rest by a
low barrier between the transcription factor’s r and s states its occupation has a transient
nature. After a change in the environment, that activates the transcription factors, the
occupation probability of the target increases exponentially with a fast time constant and
after this decreases exponentially with a slow time constant to its final value. When the
only discrimination between sites is the barrier height the final occupation probability of
the target is very small, so that in the long time limit the system is in the same state
as it was before the activation of the protein. By introducing a free energy binding energy
discrimination between sites, the final occupation probability of the target may be significant
such that the long time limit of the system may be different from the initial "pre-activated"

state.
In general, when subjected to a change in the environmental condition, a cell typically
responds by increasing the activity level of certain genes and decreasing the activity level of
others. In many cases, the expression level of a certain gene changes temporarily, exhibiting
a sharp increase or decrease, and later changing again, reaching a new steady-state (which
often is similar the original state). This, two-step transient behavior, is widely observed
in different transcriptional responses, from yeast [114, 115] to human [116] and may be
explained by a negative feedback of an activated protein [117]. In this Section we showed
how this kind of behavior naturally arises in a regulation system (composed of only one
transcription factor) based on a barrier discrimination between distinct DNA sites.
B.

Steady-state and an existence of an active process

In equilibrium the occupation probability on a DNA site depends only on its binding
energy. In cases where the only difference between the target and non-target sites is the
barrier height between the s and r states, after the equilibration the probability to find
the protein on the target site is very small. As we now show, by introducing an active
process that returns the searcher to the initial state, u, with a transition rate, Ω (see Fig.
19) from any state, one may obtain a high occupation probability of the target site even at
steady-state. This active process may be loosely thought of as cell division or degradation
and production of the protein.
In this case, for np = 1 the equation for the occupation probabilities are given by

In Fig. 20 the steady-state probability of the target site as a function of the rate of the

Summarizing, non-equilibrium effects of the barrier discrimination between DNA sites
may lead to a high target occupation probability even at steady-state.
C.

The possibility of the genetic temporal ordering

It is often the case that each TF activates more than one gene [118]. For example, in
E. coli there are 68 transcription factors which individually regulate more than 13 operons [9, 119]. In some cases the activation of different genes, regulated by the same TF,
are temporally ordered [120–122]. In these systems it seems that the temporal ordering
is not caused by the transcriptional network (for example, by a genetic cascade). It was
suggested [35, 117] that different genes have different activation thresholds. In this case a
temporally increased concentration of the transcription factor activates them one-by-one.

−1 = 10 . The solid
blue (dashed red) line represents the np = 1 (np = 15) case.

Different thresholds arise from non-linear effects, such as cooperativity between the transcription factors. Recently [123–125] it was proposed that genetic temporal ordering may be
influenced by different distances between the production location of the TF and its target
(this mechanism seems plausible only for prokaryotic cells).
Here we show that a search mechanism based on barrier discrimination can also lead to
temporal ordering. This does not rely on cooperativity and appears even for a TF with a
constant concentration. To show this we generalize the effective three states model to four
states by adding an additional target site (see Fig. 21). Now the states of the model are the
r state of the first target (T1 ), the r state of the second target (T2 ), the r state out of both
targets (D) and the U states (including the s states and the unbound state).
For np = 1 the evolution equations for the occupation probability of the first target, P T1 ,

SUMMARY

Search and recognition problems appear in many contexts in biological systems. Organisms activate/repress many processes by specifically designed proteins. This may be an
enzyme that catalyzes some chemical reaction by binding to specific molecules, a transcription factor that changes the transcriptional activity by binding to some specific locations on
the DNA, etc. In fact, the flow of information, from a genotype to a phenotype and vice
versa is regulated and implemented by searchers for specific DNA/RNA sequences. Needless to say, every particular biological searcher "invented" its own search strategy. However,
there is hope that it is possible to divide all search strategies to a few classes similarly to the
division of the transcription factors’ binding domains to a few DNA binding motifs [126].
Different aspects of a transcription factor may dictate its strategy: the number of copies in
the cell, its structure and function, its interactions with other proteins, the number of its
targets and many more. The beginning of this review suggested a possible classification of
TFs. It is certainly of great interest to extend it and test it on large databases. A particular
simple classification arose when the length of the binding site of the protein to the DNA
was considered.
The bulk part of the review deals with a possible scenario where TFs locate their target
using barrier discrimination. This is different from other mechanisms which assume a local
equilibration of the TF with its environment before the target is located. A more detailed
discussion of those can be found in many other reviews [14, 15, 62–65]. When assuming
equilibration, each site on the DNA can be characterized by a single parameter - the binding
energy at the site. According to the equilibrium assumption, this is the only parameter that
may discriminate between different sites. On the contrary in the barrier model the search

45
kinetics can become widely independent of the binding energy, and controlled by the barrier
height. This gives a particularly simple resolution to the speed-stability paradox described
in detail in this review. Moreover, it suggests that TFs can be weakly bound to the target
site for extended period. We termed this transient activation. The end of the review dealt
with more speculative processes that may occur in a barrier mechanism. These include time
ordering in the activation of genes.
Under the conditions described above the search process in the barrier model is not
characterized by a single time scale but by two. One short and one long. This leads to
a distinction between typical search times, which are relevant to experiments, and average
search times. The latter are dominated by rare events.
A clear indication that the barrier mechanism is at work in-vivo would lie in measurements
of the full FPT distribution of a TF at a target gene, and the observation of more than one
time scale. Even if the FPT distribution shows only a single time scale, the model predicts
that the appearance of a new short time scale as np , number of searchers, is increased.
Therefore, the appearance of the new time scale would be a clear indiction for the presence
of the mechanism. In this case the typical search time will generally not scale as 1/np . Such
experimental data are not yet available but in principle accessible, and will hopefully provide
in the near future a better understanding of the kinetics of gene activation.

Appendix A: An information theoretic approach to the calculation of disorder
parameters and binding energies

In Sections II we characterized the ability of a protein to recognize its target by the free
energy gap between the target and the rest of the DNA sites and the equilibrium target
occupation probability. As an alternative approach one often uses the information content
of a protein, denoted by IC [127, 128]. While our personal preference is to the presentation
used in the main text the two can be used interchangeably. In this appendix we provide a
brief overview of the relations between the information theory quantities (the information
content and the sequence score) and the physical (the disorder strength and the binding
energy of a sequence) quantities.
1.

The information content and the disorder strength

Before turning to the information content of a protein of length lp we first discuss the
information content associated with a single binding site i. Assuming that the frequency of
each nucleotide in the genome is close to 1/4 [129], this quantity, denoted by ICi , is given
by its maximal amount of information minus its Shannon entropy. Note that we consider
the IC of the “specific” protein conformation. The non-specific one, presumably, does not

46
contain any information. With this in mind we have
X
ICi = − log2 (1/4) +
Pr (s, i) log2 Pr (s, i)

(A1)

s={A,T,C,G}

where Pr (s, i) is defined in Eq. (2). This quantity is maximal when only one nucleotide
type can bind to site i. In this case Pr (s, i) = δs,s0 so that ICi = 2bits. If two types
of nucleotides can bind with equal probability (Pr (s, i) = 12 δs,s0 + 12 δs,s00 ) the information
content is reduced to one bit. In a case when each of the four types of nucleotides can bind
with an equal probability of 14 the information content is zero8 .
With these definitions the total information content of the protein is given by a sum of
information contents of all protein binding sites:

Schneider et al. [127] suggested, and showed for a few transcription factors, that the
information content is just sufficient for the target to be distinguished from the rest of
the genome. Specifically, with N potential binders, where N is twice the genome length
(N ' 107 bp for E. coli ), the amount of the information needed to distinguish a single binder
is log2 N . Therefore, we would expect
IC & log2 N

(A11)

If this is not fulfilled one expects a wrong sequence to be incorrectly recognized. Comparing
Eqs. (A10) and (A11) this translated to a condition on the length of the protein
lp &
and
σU &

(A13)

This is identical to results of the simple arguments presented in Sec. II. This condition is
based on the assumption that the maximal information content per TF’s length is two bits.

Figure 23: A histogram of the information content, IC. The data is based on the 89 weight matrices
of E. coli DNA-binding proteins from RegulonDB database [78]. The prediction of Eq. (A11) is
23bits and is represented on the figure by the red arrow.

However, we find that the average information content per TF’s length is actually close to
one bit. This fact increases the minimal protein’s length from 11 to 22 basepairs. Similar
conclusion may be obtained from Fig. 8.
One can see that the condition for a broad line information content (A12) and (A13)
are identical to the conditions for a marginally gapped target with a significant occupation
probability (see Sec. II). In the limit of N → ∞ both conditions represent the freezing point
of the Random Energy Model [130]. In Fig. 23 a histogram of the information content of
several DNA-binding proteins is presented. Note that many proteins have significantly less
information about the target than predicted by Eq. (A11). This conclusion is independent
of any assumption on the binding energy distribution. More detailed study which includes
eukaryotic TFs and other databases was done in Ref. [66]. In this work authors found that
for an eukaryotic TFs the problem of the not sufficient information content is much more
severe.
2.

The sequence score and the binding energy

We showed above that the information content of many proteins is not sufficient for
efficient target location. In Sec. II we present the same results, in particular, by comparing
the binding energy of the target to the rest of the DNA. To this end we had to obtain the
binding energy of a given sequence. In an information theory context this
 may be evaluated
using a sequence score [131]. The score of a sequence s = s1 , s2 , ..., slp is defined as
Sc (s) =

lp
X
i=1

ln [4 Pr (si , i)] = lp ln 4 + ln [Pr (s, i)]

(A14)

49
where Pr (si , i) is defined in Eq. (2) and
Pr (s, i) =

lp
Y

Pr (si , i) .

(A15)

i=1

The probability that a sequence s is bound is proportional to the Boltzmann factor e−U (s) .
Therefore, the binding energy, U (s), is equal to the score of sequence s. Note that this convention differs from the one used in the text by a constant. The constant may be calculated
by recalling that we defined the binding energy so that its average is zero. Therefore,

that the value of UT is not bound). Thus, in the small disorder regime the speed-stability
paradox can be resolved by increasing the copy number of a TF without destroying the
specificity. For a small number of dangerous sites, Nd  N 1/4 , one may do so with a relatively large disorder while in the opposite case the upper bound on the disorder strength

Appendix D: Details of the simulations

The model is simulated using a standard continuous time Gillespie algorithm [113]. The
protein on a given site, i, in the s mode can perform four possible moves: it can move in one
λ0 /2
of the possible directions along the DNA with probability λ0 +λ
i +λ , go to the r mode with
u
r

i

probability λ0 +λλir+λu or dissociate from the DNA and reassociate on a randomly chosen site
r
with probability λ0 +λλiu+λu . In the first two cases time is advanced by an amount drawn from
r
a Poisson distribution with an average of λ0 +λ1i +λu . When the protein dissociates, the time
r
is advanced by first, drawing a time from a Poissonian distribution with an average time
of λ0 +λ1i +λu , and adding to it a time, drawn from a Poissonian distribution with an average
r
1
. This corresponds to the time needed for a relocation to a new site. The r mode can
λb
transform only into the s mode. The time for this step is drawn from a Poisson distribution
with an average time λ1s .
Appendix E: Pole structure analysis and derivation of Eq. (67)

separation in the problem. Following standard practice we perform the inverse Laplace

Appendix F: Conditions for a perfect search

In this appendix we show that using the search and recognition strategy based on a
disorder in a barrier height one may in principle achieve a "perfect" search without any
design of the target and using only one searcher by optimizing the values of E0 and σ. We
define a "perfect" search as one where one searcher goes to the r state of the target site

. The last

demand may be satisfied by ensuring that the barrier height on the target site, EbT , is not
positive with probability one. In this case the number of scans of the DNA that the searcher
performs before a transition to the r state is of order one. Below we show that this perfectly
fast search can be achieved with a perfect recognition of the target, q = 1. Namely we show
that the occupation probability of the target in the infinite time limit may arbitrarily close
to one. To this end we calculate below the occupation probability of each site on the DNA,
Pi , and in particular, the occupation probability of the target site, P T . We take here λis = 0
(Er = −∞) to ensure the stability of the protein-DNA complex after the target is located.
We assume now (and check this assumptions self consistently) that q = 1. This implies that
the protein scans the whole DNA in the s state (and, therefore, equilibrates in the s states,
but not in the r state, on all DNA sites) before it passes over the barrier on the target.

As was mentioned above, we assume that for almost each realization of the disorder Ebi > 0

target site. These two restrictions lead to the choice

In the limit N → ∞ one gets a behavior similar to the usual second order phase transition

Therefore, for large enough J the searcher finds its target with a probability close to one so
that all our assumptions in this Section based on q = 1 are self consistent. Also, since the
typical barrier between the s and r states on the target is zero, the searcher finds its target
within the facilitated diffusion limit. Note that, although the search and the recognition are
perfect, the average time is infinite since there is a finite, 1 − q, probability to be trapped
on a non-target site.
Summarizing, to ensure a perfect search one should set10

and the typical search time is comparable to the facilitated diffusion limit. Therefore,
J should be as large as possible. For the case of np searchers (assuming that they are

In fact, a perfect search may be impossible from practical reasons. For example, for

This choice of finite values of N , σ and E0 provides a good approximation to the optimal E0 for a given σ
(and vice versa). For example, for the case shown on Fig. 16(a) Eq. (F8) predicts that the optimal value
of σ is 5.34 which is close to the numerically obtained value of 5.25 (see Fig. 16(a)).

59
N = 106 our results suggest that to ensure q = 0.5 one should take E0 ' 67.7 and σ ' 14.3.
Such large energies may be difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, as we showed in Section V D
the proposed mechanism of a barrier discrimination is very efficient even when parameters
are far from perfect search conditions and the mean and the variance of the barrier energy
are comparable to the mean and the variance of the experimentally found binding energy
distribution.
