Abstract
Long, elastic filaments cross-linked and deformed by active molecular motors occur in various natural settings. The
overall macroscopic mechanical response of such a composite network depends on the coupling between the active
and the passive properties of the underlying constituents and nonlocal interactions between different parts of the
composite. In a simple one dimensional system, using a mean field model, it has been shown that the combination
of motor activity and finite filament extensibility yields a persistence length scale over which strain decays. Here
we study a similar system, in the complementary limit of strong noise and moderate extensibility, using Brownian
multi-particle collision dynamics-based numerical simulations that includes the coupling between motor kinetics
and local filament extensibility. While the numerical model shows deviations from the mean field predictions due to
the presence of strong active noise caused by the variations in individual motor activity, several qualitative features
are still retained. Specifically, for fixed motor attachment and detachment rates, the decay is length is set by the
ratio of the passive elasticity to the active shear resistance generated by attached motors. Our study generalizes
the notion of persistence in passive thermal systems to actively driven systems with testable predictions.

Introduction
The active strain generated by molecular motors moving
on elastic filaments is the principal mechanism of force
generation and motion in cell biology [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9,
8]. In natural and reconstituted versions of such active
composites, the localized strains due to motors deform
the filaments dynamically, due to the interplay between
elasticity, geometric constraints, active motor forces and
noise due to fluctuations in the ambient medium and
in motor activity. These deformations in turn regulate the activity of the motors themselves [3, 13]. A
structurally ordered example of such a system is the
eukaryotic flagellum that is made of relatively stiff filaments (microtubules), motors (dynein) and passive elastic elements (nexins) which together oscillate with well
defined wavelengths and frequencies [2, 11, 12, 13, 14].
While a variety of models of varying degree of complexity [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8] are consistent with observations
of increasing wavelength with increasing flagella length,
experimental evidences indicate that this relationship
is altered for very long lengths [15, 16, 17, 18] and

that the wavelengths attained in nature are self-limiting
[2, 4] even as the flagella themselves range from tens
of microns to nearly a centimeter. This strongly suggests that over large lengths, mechanical information
transmission degrades substantially.
In a passive context [6], it has been recently demonstrated that when bundles of filaments are forced to
bend, the shearing forces between them are mediated by
extensibility, leading to a characteristic scale over which
mechanical information is transmitted. In an active system such as an array of soft filaments driven by molecular motors, a possible consequence of this finite decay
length of strain is that the weak extensibility of the filaments can limit the range of mechanical signal transmission between molecular motors and restrict the length
scale over which motor coordination can occur. This
will significantly affect the motor activity in filaments
of lengths much larger than the strain decay length and
could bring in spatial inhomogeneities in both strain
and activity. As an example, in Fig. 1(a), we show two
distinct motor patches labeled I and II cross-linking a
pair of thin filaments that may bend and shear. For

inextensible filaments, mechanical activity by group (I)
and shear (sliding) induced by this patch is transmitted
by attached motors in (II) over arbitrarily large interaggregate distances. For extensible filaments, there is an
interplay between shear / slide and filament elongation
along its contour length and leads to a decrease in the
ability of group (I) to mechanically link with group (II).
Using a mean field approach valid in the noise-less
limit [10], we recently showed that the decay length of
localized steady or oscillatory strains is determined by
a combination of filament elasticity, passive shear resistance imposed by cross-linkers and the active viscoelastic properties of the motor aggregates. This analysis
was performed by coarse-graining the stochastic nature
of motor-filament interactions, and ignoring variations
in motors kinetics due to the finite number of motors.
However, even if thermal noise can be ignored (such as
when motors are rigidly fixed at the base and therefore do not diffuse) there is still an effective motor noise
that arises due to discreteness of binding and unbinding events and fluctuations in the attachment times due
to the finite number of motors. Moreover, there is a

complete two way coupling between the motor activity
and filament dynamics that arises as the motor activity causes filament strain, influences the collective motor
dynamics. All these effects are not captured in the mean
field model.
Here, we present a microscopic numerical model, in
which we incorporate the effect noise arising from variations in motor kinetics, and implement the two-way
coupling between motors and filament to study its influence on the persistence of active strain by comparing
the results with the mean field predictions. Predictions
of the microscopic model agree qualitatively with the
mean-field results, despite the effect of strong active
noise. However, motor noise is shown to result in richer
dynamical features including modification of the motor
duty ratio and localized regions of coherent oscillations
due to the interplay between the local active shear
resistance and filament elasticity.
Persistence of strain in a passive composite
To understand the coupling between shear, bending and
extension in a passive setting, we start with a minimal model of two elastic filaments of unstrained length
`, lateral width b and thickness w  ` held at a distance D  ` apart by a series of passive, linearly
elastic springs with areal density ρN and stiffness kN
(Fig. 1(b)-(c)). The passive springs are compliant in
shear along the axial direction but prevent any change
in the distance between the filaments.
At length scales large compared to the spacing
between these springs, the composite acts as a filament
of thickness D, with an effective shear modulus that
depends on the spring stiffness, the density of springs,
and the inter-spring spacing when b  max(w, D). By
considering a sliding displacement of the top filament
relative to the bottom due to a shear acting on its surface of area b`, with a stress σs , the net force is σs b`.
Further, if the areal density of springs is ρN , the shear is
balanced by ρN b` springs, all acting at the same time,
and each contributing to shear resistance with spring
constant kN . Assuming a shear (sliding) displacement
of magnitude ∆, force balance
∆ kN ρN b ` ∼ σs b` ∼

G∗ ∆

yields an effective shear modulus from these passive
springs given by G∗ ∼ DkN ρN . For a strip of lateral
width w, we have G∗ w/D ∼ wkN ρN - consistent with
previous analyses of a passive cross-linked railway track
model [7, 5].
With this estimate in mind, we choose a local coordinate system characterized by an arc-length variable s
so that the filament is in the range s ∈ (0, `). For two
points r1 (on filament 1) and r2 (on filament 2) (Fig.

“Persistence˙BJ˙Submit” — 2015/1/13 — 1:36 — page 3 — #3

1(b)) which face each other when the filaments are in
the undeformed state, we define the sliding deformation
∆(s) as difference between r1 and r2 , relative to its initial difference before deformation. The angle made by
the tangent to the centreline, θ(s) is then related to the
slide ∆(s) and the displacement u(s) by geometry via
the relations dr1 /ds = t, dt/ds = Cn and dn/ds = −Ct,
where n and t are the normal and tangent vectors, and
C = dt/ds·n ≈ θs is the local curvature. In the deformed
state, the position r2 relative to r1 can be written as,
r2 ≈ r1 + D n + u t.

(1)

Here we have assumed (D + w)  `. The axial strain
along the filament is us where d(.)/ds ≡ (.)s . Using the
relations ∆s = D (|(r1 )s | − |(r2 )s |) and (r1 )s = t, we
obtain,
(r2 )s ≈ t − D C t + us t + u C n.

(2)

For small deformations we can ignore quadratic/cross
terms in the deformation to get
|(r1 )s | = 1,

|(r2 )s | ≈ 1 − Dθs + us

(3)

Substituting (3) into (2) we get
∆s = Dθs − us .

(4)

Integrating (4) from s = 0 to s using the boundary
condition θ(0) = 0 yields ∆(s) = Dθ(s) − u(s).
The shape of the filament is then obtained by minimizing the energy ET of the composite due to bending,
stretching and shear, with

Here Bpas ∼ Ew3 , Kpas ∼ Ew and Gpas ∼ ρN kN are
the passive bending, stretching and shear moduli, with
E is the Young’s modulus of the material. The EulerLagrange equations obtained by minimizing the functional (5) are given by δET /δ∆ = 0 and δET /δθ = 0
and lead to equilibrium static solutions.
We consider solutions to (4) in two complementary
limits. When the bending stiffness Bpas → ∞, the composite deforms due to shear and extension alone and
∆ = −u, so that the minimization of (5) provides
∆ss − (Gpas /Kpas ) ∆ = 0,

(6)

which yields the relaxation length scale for pure extension `2E ≡ Kpas /Gpas ∼ Ew/ρN kN . For inextensible filaments, Kpas → ∞, and ∆ = Dθ and the minimization

procedure provides the relation θss − D 2 Gpas /Bpas θ =
0, thus yielding the persistence scale for pure bending
`2B ≡ Bpas /D 2 Gpas ∼ Ew3 /D 2 kN ρN .

Allowing for sliding deformations at s = 0 and
keeping bending, extension as well as sliding terms, we
repeat the minimization procedure to obtain the two

Similar length scales appear in a variety of soft systems
where bending, shear and extension are coupled, both
in microscopic and macroscopic contexts [19, 20].
To put these length scales in perspective, we look at
typical parameters for a flagellar axoneme. We take w
and D as the radius and the spacing of microtubules,
E as the Young’s modulus of microtubules, kN as the
stiffness of passive (nexin) links and ρN as the density
of these links. Using w ∼ 20 nm, D ∼ 40 nm [3], E ∼ 1.2
GPa [3, 4], kN ∼ 16 − 100 pN µm−1 [23] and wρN ∼
105 − 107 m−1 [17, 23], we estimate `E ∼ 200 − 500
µm while `∗ ∼ 80 − 200 µm. This estimate is however
with just the passive cross linkers contributing to the
shear stiffness and therefore values should be treated as
an upper limit. Motor activity will naturally influence
this scale as attached motors contribute to the instantaneous shear resistance. Assuming that all motors are
bound, with linear density O(108 ) m−1 and effective
spring stiffness of 10−3 N/m, we obtain `E ∼ 5 − 10
µm. Since sperm flagella are often much longer than
this scale [4], the role played by activity in modulating
persistence lengths can be important.
Mean-field model for an active composite
For the case we treat here, corresponding to the case
without bending wherein the slide ∆(s) = −u(s)
according to (4), motor activity modifies the decay
length `E in the noiseless limit by changing the effective shear resistance in a manner controlled by motor
kinetics. We being by summarizing the results of the
mean field analysis [10], valid in the noise-less limit with
the focus on systems with purely extensional modes of
deformation. While the original analysis [10] allows for
a more general form for the motor-filament interactions,
here we consider a special case of the continuum theory
consistent with our simulations as shown in Fig.1(b).
Here, two cross-linked filaments are held together
by a combination of active elastic motors and by passive elastic spring-like linkers. The active motors act as

linear elastic springs of stiffness km , and can either be
attached to or detached from the filament. When the
inter-link spacing and the inter-motor spacing is much
smaller than the filament length, the motor-filament
assembly can be represented by a continuum description. In this case, for an inertialess filament, the sum of
forces on the filament arising from filament extensibility, springs and motors must vanish. If Fm is the active
force due to a single attached motor and ρm the motor
density, this yields

the second term gives the motor velocity relative to the
filament, and the third term corresponds to the rate
at which the mean strain changes due to the kinetics
of motor attachment and arises from the difference in
extension of attaching and detaching motors. The two
dimensionless parameters in (12) A1 ≡ v0 km /(øo Fs )
and A2 ≡ Fs /(km δm ) relate the microscopic motor
kinetics to the population averaged dynamics. Once we
have N and Y , the motor force Fm in (10) is written as

(Kpas us )s − Gpas u + ρm Fm = 0,

Equations (10)-(13) provides a closed system for the the
dynamics of filament displacement u, attached motor
density N and motor extension Y in terms of dimensionless parameters A1 , A2 and Ψ = ø/ωon . These
equations have a homogeneous stationary solution given
by N0 = (1 + ΨF0 )−1 and Y0 = A1 A2 (A1 + F0 )−1 , and
a natural question is that of their stability to variations
in the parameters.
Before we describe the global distribution of the
strain field and the persistence of activity, we first examine the dynamics of a small fragment of the filament1
motor composite of length `s  (Kpas /Gpas ) 2 . In
this limit, we can ignore filament extensibility and the
motion of this segment relative to its neighbors can
be mapped to that of a homogeneous population of
motors acting on a rigid segment and working against
an external spring with effective stiffness Ks ∝ Gpas .1
For such a fragment, when Ks > 0, a linear stability
analysis of equations (11) -(13) reveals that the stationary states N0 and Y0 become linearly unstable and a
stable oscillatory state emanate via supercritical HopfPoincare bifurcations[10]. In the stable oscillatory state,
the power input into the system due to activity balances the energy dissipated by motor viscosity. The
effective motor friction characterizing this process is
ηact ∼ ρm N0 km (dhyi/dut )ut =0 where ρm N0 is the total
number of attached motors. As Ψ increases, the term
(dhyi/dut )ut =0 typically decreases, as does N0 thus predicting an increase in the frequency of the emergent
oscillations ωc .
To connect these localized solutions to the global
extensional field in order to determine decay lengths of
imposed extensions, we consider an active composite filament held fixed at one end (s = 0) while free at the
other (s = `) which is forced harmonically. We assume
that u(0, t) = 0 and u(`, t) = u0 (`) + ûReal[eiωt ],
where û/u0 (`)  1 characterizes the deviation from
the stationary extensional state u0 (s) which satisfies the
equation

(10)

which differs from previous system described by (6)
because of the active force density term ρm Fm .
To estimate the active force density Fm that contributes to an active shear resistance, we consider a
minimal model for the motor-filament interaction. In
this, active motors attach to the filament with zero
extension (no pre-strain) and once attached walk relative to the filament with a velocity vm . The motor
velocity vm is linearly related to strain through a linear
relation, vm = yt = ut + v0 (1 − km y/Fs ), where ut is
the velocity of the filament relative to the motor, Fs is
the motor stall force and v0 is the zero load velocity of
the motor. Since one end of the motor is permanently
attached to a rigid substrate, motor movement results
in a motor extension y and thereby causes a resisting
force km y.
Motor kinetics may be described by a set of population balances relating the attached and detached probability densities to the corresponding fluxes. Ensemble
averaging the terms in these relations provide dynamical equations for the fraction of attached motors, N (s, t)
and the mean motor extension, Y (s, t) (see [10] for
detailed derivation). The evolution equation for N is
then given by

the extension corresponding to motor detachment, and
the scaled mean extension of the attached motors, Y ≡
hyi/δm . Since the motor detachment is strain dependent, the evolution of N is non-linearly coupled to the
mean motor stretch Y , as implied in (11). Population
balance relations then lead to an analogous evolution

speaking, there is also an active contribution to this

of activity, i.e. Gact = 0, we recover the expression
λ = `E .
In summary, the mean-field analysis predicts that
the relative importance of the active (motor) to passive
(linker) elasticity is controlled by Gact /Gpas , whereas
in the absence of passive linkers the persistence length
is controlled solely by Gact /Kpas . Further, (17) implies
that the persistence length is influenced by the imposed
frequency ω, though the frequency dependent complex
response term, χ that controls the competition between
intrinsic motor duty ratios and the extrinsic imposed
frequency ω in determining the filament extension.
Numerical model for the motor-filament composite
However, the mean field theory does not take into
account the effect of local motor noise due to discrete attachment and detachment events and the finite
number of motors. Also, there is no intrinsic coupling

between filament extensibility and the mean attachment
time of motors - as evidenced by the fact that N0 and
Y0 are independent of u0 . We now extend this minimal
theory and investigate the role of increasing noise and
fluctuations on the decay of both steady and oscillatory
localized extensions.
In our model, the continuous filament is made up of
N discrete spherical monomers of diameter σ located at

where ti = (ri − ri−1 )/|ri − ri−1 |. Here the effective
bending rigidity κ penalizes angular changes from a
local straight geometry. We fix the filament length to
be a constant ` = 80 σ, and also fix the spring constants
κl = κ = 2 × 104 kB T /σ 2 in order to get a large filament persistence length `p ' 250 `. The bending and
extensional stiffness are large enough so that the segment may be treated as a rigid inextensible segment.
For simplicity and to focus on the role of activity and
noise, we did not incorporate permanent passive cross
links in the model. With this simplification, shearing is
resisted because of the temporary crosslinks (bridges)
formed by attached motors. These bridges disappear as
motors detach at sufficiently high loads.
The active motors were modeled as linear springs
with stiffness km and equilibrium length `m . The motors
attach with zero mean strain and walk along the filament with discrete step size dm . As the motor heads
move, the accompanying extension of the motor length
leads to a force Fm = −κm (` − `m ) `ˆ that acts on
the attached filament. Thus, motor activity results in
localized active strain on the section of the filament
to which they are attached. Consistent with previous
experimental studies the load dependent stepping rate,
i.e. the stepping velocity of the motor head - is chosen
to have the simple form vm (1 − |Fm |/fmax ). However,
unlike in mean-field models where the attachment and
detachment processes are coarse-grained into rates, in
the simulations we prescribe microscopic probabilities:
the load independent attachment probabilitypon , is the
probability of a detached motor to attach to the filament, while the motor detachment probability p̃off is
defined by the piecewise function

This load dependence of the detachment probability of
individual motors allows for the crucial two-way coupling between filament elasticity and the motor response
and also sets the critical motor extension at which
detachment occurs. We take fcut = fmax in our simulations, although in general they are not equal. Furthermore, the constant load independent detachment
probability poff in conjunction with pon yields a well
defined equilibrium attachment of motors at zero load,
such that, pon (1 − N ) + poff N = 1. However, we note
that despite the added noise, our numerical model is
an approximate one in that excluded volume interactions between the motors are not taken into account;
these interactions will be significant only at large values
of pon when almost all motors are always attached, a
situation that we do not consider here.
The position and velocity of the monomer beads are
updated using velocity-Verlet algorithm, in which the
force acting on the monomer is calculated at every time
step. The entire system is immersed in a viscous medium
using the Brownian multiple particle collision dynamics
(MPC) scheme which neglects the effects of inertia [24].
According to this scheme, each monomer independently
performs a stochastic collision with a phantom fluid

particle with a momentum taken from the MaxwellBoltzmann distribution with variance ρkb T , where ρ is
the fluid density.
Using the numerical model, we first analyze the
effect of noise in dynamical regimes of a short inextensible fragment - this corresponds to the dynamics of
1
filaments with length `s  (Kpas /Gpas ) 2 . This allows
us to identify the way noise modified the predictions of
the mean field model, which predicts a sharp separation between two states - a stable, stationary state and
a stable, oscillatory state. We expect noise to make true
boundary between these two regimes fuzzy.
In Fig. 2(a), we show a rigid filament anchored to
a wall via a linear elastic spring of stiffness Ks that
moves under the action of 800 motors. Monitoring the
long time displacement of the free end as a function
of the spring constant Ks and the probability ratio
poff /pon yields results summarized in Fig. 2(b)-(d). The
interplay between the softness of the filament composite Ks /km and the activity poff /pon yields three distinct
dynamical regimes illustrated in Fig. 2(b). For fixed Ks
when poff /pon  1, there is a large force on the filament, and the free end of the filament attains a steady
displacement with a well defined mean attached motor
density, with fluctuations due to the noise imposed by
discrete nature of motor binding and unbinding. For

randomly switches from a stationary to an oscillatory
state and back, is a new dynamical state observed only
in the presence of noise. A sweep of the parameter space

yields the phase plot in Fig. 2(c). The parameter range
over which steady oscillations are seen is qualitatively
consistent with theoretical predictions [10]. However,
due to discrete motor noise, the boundary separating
the steady and oscillatory states is no longer sharp as expected, we observe a region of intermittent oscillations. Within the oscillatory regime, the frequency
increases with increasing poff /pon (Fig. 2(d)), which
also agrees with the trend seen from the mean field
predictions of the theoretical model.
Next we study the role of motor noise on the extensibility of a composite filament that is made up of 50
equally sized rigid segments, each linked to adjacent
neighbors by linear springs of stiffness Ks (Fig. 3(a))
that account for the weak extensibility of the composite. Since no permanent cross links are present, ρN = 0,
and the effective passive stiffness Ks ∝ Kpas . We choose
parameters for the filament elasticity and attachment
and detachment probabilities such that the base state
in the absence of imposed oscillations is steady (nonoscillatory) and stable and oscillate the free end at low

frequency (ω  dm /vm ), and small amplitude (∆1 
∆a ). For sufficiently low frequencies, the results are
qualitatively independent of ω and hence we will focus
on results obtained for a frequency ω = 10−3 (dm /vm ).
Quantifying the mean extension of the filament as a
function of arc length s of the extensible filament motor
composite shown in Fig. 3(b), we see that the maximum
at the free end is influenced strongly by both poff /pon ,
and Kpas . However, the discrete nature of motor activity
causes large fluctuations in mean extension, especially
for very soft filaments with Kpas /km  1 (Fig.3b -left).
Motor noise also results in uncorrelated spatial domains
in extension for Kpas /km = 0.01 while a greater degree
of correlation is observed for Kpas /km = 10 (Fig.3(b)right). Concomitantly, variations in the mean extension
(shown as vertical bars) are also more correlated for
stiffer filaments than for softer filaments. The noise
decreases with increase in pon , as shown in Fig. 3(b).
Fig. 3(c) shows that the steady state extension of the
free end u0 (`)/σ increases with pon /poff . To compare the
numerical predictions for steady state extension u0 (s) to

from which one deduces that there is no decay length
scale in the absence of permanent passive linkers. We
see from the right panel in Fig. 3(b) that this is needed
the case. While the simple theory predicts a quadratic
form for the extension consistent with Fig. 3(b), we
see that increasing the attachment probability yields a
sharper gradient close to the clamped end and a flatter
profile near the free end. Setting Gact = ρm km , we find
from (20) that the extension is an increasing function
of km /Kpas and is maximum at the free end, which are
both consistent with our numerical results (Fig. 3(c)).
The dependence on the activity Ψ is also qualitatively
captured as the slope increases with the ratio pon /poff .
The extension at the free end u0 (`) obtained from
(20) indicates that u0 (`) decreases with Kpas /km while
it increases with (pon /poff ) - both these trends are
observed in the numerical simulations(Fig.3(d)).
Since the motor detachment is strain dependent, the
motor imposed extensions in turn regulate the motor
kinetics - and specifically modify the mean attached
time. In Fig. 3(d) we plot the mean fraction of motors
attached, hNattached i/N0 , as a function of the distance
from the anchored end, s for Kpas /km = 10. When
pon /poff . 0.1 the motor imposed extension of the filament is weak due to less number of motors attached, and
the distribution of attached motors along the composite filament is approximately uniform. However for large
values of pon /poff (pon /poff & 1) the enhanced motor
attachment imposes significant extension to the filament, which is maximum at the free end. The nonuniform extension of the composite leads to a nonuniform
distribution of attached motors (Fig.3(d)), where the
mean motor attachment is maximum near the anchored
end (s = 0) and decreases with the distance from that
point, as the filament strain increases. This leads to a
diminished motor activity near the free end. These features are not seen in the mean field predictions and are
thus a direct consequence of the noise due to the discrete
nature of motor binding and unbinding events.
We finally calculate the length-scale corresponding
to the decay of the amplitude of the imposed oscillatory strain (û) along the composite, for a range of
Kpas /km and pon /poff . For all values of Kpas /km and
pon /poff , our analysis show that û decays exponentially with distance s from the free end, as shown
in Fig. 4(a)-(c). Further, the decay length of the
exponential increases when Kpas /km is varied from
10−3 (Fig.4(a)) to 10−2 (Fig.4(b)) and 10−1 (Fig.4(c)).

An exponential fit to the amplitude along the composite for different parameter values allows us to estimate the decay length λE as a function of s (Fig.4(d)).
This indicates that for a fixed pon /poff , λ is scales as
1
(Kpas /km ) 2 . However, the decay length exhibits only
weak dependence on motor kinetics for the range of
attachment probabilities investigated. We also find that
the value saturates to a constant in simulations with
large Kpas /km , which we ascribe to finite system size
effects.
To compare with theoretically predicted decay
length to our simulation results, we set ρN = 0 in (17)
to obtain the decay length

Since χ is a function of imposed frequency and motor
kinetics, and is to leading order independent of filament
stiffness, the term in the square brackets is a constant
for a given ω and pon /poff . As shown in Fig.4(d), this
prediction agrees very well with our simulations.
Conclusions
The scale over which active deformations persist in a
fluctuating environment are basic questions in the study
of living matter. Here, we address both these questions
in the context of an ordered composite structure consisting of elastic elements that can be stretched and/or
sheared by motors that can bind to and unbind from
them, taking to account the individual motor kinetics.
Even though extensibility is negligible locally, it affects
the scale over which deformations persist owing to the
competition between extensibility and shear. In particular, for active systems, we show that the emergence
of an oscillatory instability in a short segment leads to
deformations that do not persist forever and instead
decay over longer length scales. Further, the finite number of motors attached causes an intermediate regime
of intermittent oscillations, which was not predicted by
models that ignore active noise. Our analysis shows that
the feedback due to the ability of attached motors to
sense local extension rates influences the motor activity
and modifies the effective length scale over which strain
decays.
Our simulations suggest that deviations from the
mean field theory - even for weak extensibility - can
arise in the limit of very small number of attached
motors (or small attachment rates) and very large number of attached motors (noise acting cumulatively at
large attachment rates). We find that, for a given motor
activity, the decay length of strain predicted by the
1
mean field theory, λE ∼ 2(Kpas /Gpas ) 2 , is valid even
in the presence of noise. This confirms a finite range of

correlated activity that might be relevant for natural
examples of ordered active matter such as eukaryotic
flagella [27] by setting a limit over which mechanical
coordination can persist. It also raises interesting questions about how to generalize our analysis to disordered
mixtures of motors and cytoskeletal filaments [25, 26],
particularly in the limit when the coordination number
is small and when it approaches the isostatic limit.
