Abstract:
Purpose: Magnetic hyperthermia is currently an EU-approved clinical therapy against tumor cells that
uses magnetic nanoparticles under a time varying magnetic field (TVMF). The same basic principle
seems promising against trypanosomatids causing Chagas´ disease and sleeping sickness, since
therapeutic drugs available display severe side effects and drug-resistant strains. However, no

applications of this strategy against protozoan-induced diseases have been reported so far. In the present
study, Crithidia fasciculata, a widely used model for therapeutic strategies against pathogenic
trypanosomatids, was targeted with Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in order to remotely provoke
cell death using TVMFs.
Methods: Iron-oxide MNPs with average sizes of <d> ≈ 30 nm were synthesized using a precipitation of
FeSO4 in basic medium. The MNPs were added to Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes in exponential
phase and incubated overnight, removing the excess of MNPs by a DEAE-cellulose resin column. The
amount of uploaded MNPs per cell was determined by magnetic measurements. The MNP-bearing cells
were submitted to TVMFs using a homemade AC-field applicator (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m), and the
temperature variation during the experiments was measured. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to
asses morphological changes after TVMF experiments. Cell viability was analyzed using the MTT
colorimetric assay and flow cytometry.
Results: The MNPs were incorporated by the cells, with no noticeable cell-toxicity effects. When a TVMF
was applied to MNP-bearing cells, massive cell death was induced via a non-apoptotic mechanism. No
effects were observed by applying a TVMF on control (without loaded MNPs) cells. No macroscopic rise
in temperature was observed in the extracellular medium during the experiments.
Conclusion: These data indicate (as a proof of principle) that intracellular hyperthermia is a suitable
technology to induce the specific death of protozoan parasites bearing MNPs. These findings expand the
possibilities for new therapeutic strategies that combat parasitic infections.

Introduction
Diseases caused by organisms of the Trypanosoma and Leishmania genera affect a global
population of at least 20 million people, with an estimated at risk population of approximately 450 million
people

1,2

. These statistics indicate that trypanosomatid-induced diseases are a severe sanitary problem,

with the resulting disease burden affecting much of the population that resides in the tropical and

2

subtropical regions of the globe.

3,4

Despite the sanitary relevance of trypanosomatid-induced diseases

for human health, no satisfactory treatments exist to combat these infections.

5-7

The two therapeutic

agents that are presently in use for the treatment of Chagas´ disease are Nifutrimox and Benznidazole;
8

however, these drugs were developed approximately 40 years ago . The main disadvantages of these
treatments are a high level of toxicity and a low therapeutic efficiency during the chronic phase of the
disease. The latter disadvantage is a serious problem because Chagas´ disease is mainly diagnosed
during the chronic phase; therefore, the majority of infected people miss the opportunity to be treated
9

using effective chemotherapy . In addition, several cases of drug-resistant or partially resistant strains
have been reported for both of these drugs

10

. The initial stages of Trypanosoma brucei infections, when

the central nervous system is not compromised, can be treated using suramin or pentamidine

11

. Again,

these drugs are not effective during the late stages of the disease (when the majority of cases are
diagnosed) because these drugs do not traverse the brain blood barrier. For these cases the first-line
treatment is melarsoprol, a drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier. Melarsoprol is a highly toxic drug
that causes a myriad of serious undesired side effects, including reactive encephalopathy, in
approximately 20% of the patients receiving treatment

12

. For the treatment of diseases caused by

Leishmania spp., Pentavalent antimonials are most often used

13

. Although these drugs are effective for

treating the cutaneous form of the disease, treatments for the parenteral form of the disease are limited.
In addition, these drugs are highly toxic. Amphotericin B and pentamidine are considered to be secondline drugs because of their serious or irreversible toxic effects. However, these drugs are now being
reconsidered on the basis of new formulations or dosage regimens

13-15

. The fact that the majority of the

drugs that are currently used for trypanosomatid-induced diseases were developed approximately 40
years ago reveals the limited success of the strategies to develop novel therapeutic treatments. This lack
of success highlights the necessity for new strategies and tools to address this important public health
issue.
Magnetic hyperthermia is a relatively new medical protocol

16

that uses magnetic nanoparticles to

heat areas of the body using the application of time-varying magnetic fields (TVMFs). The physical
mechanisms underlying energy absorption by MNPs are related to the existence of the magnetic

relaxation of single domains by Arrhenius-Néel processes

4,17

. With the advent of nanotechnology, it

became possible to engineer efficient MNPs that have the ability to absorb large amounts of energy from
TVMFs (up to several kW per gram of material) to induce a local rise in temperature.

18

Because of their

size, these nanoparticles can be incorporated inside target cells, making possible to heat up small foci at
19

the single cell level. The application of hyperthermia using MNPs, alone or in combination with other
therapeutic strategies, was proposed more than a decade ago as a therapeutic technique to treat
16

cancer. In the present study, we used the non-pathogenic trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata, a wellaccepted model of other pathogenic trypanosomatid parasites

20

, to evaluate the use of magnetic

hyperthermia as a potential trypanocidal treatment. The mechanisms of cell death and the application of
these principles of magnetic hyperthermia to treat parasitic diseases are discussed in later sections of the
present work.

Material and methods
Reagents and Culture media
The chemicals and fetal calf serum (FCS) used for the present study were purchased from Sigma
(Missouri – USA). The other components of the culture medium were purchased from Difco (LawrenceUSA). The apoptosis detection kit was purchased from Immunostep (Coimbra – Portugal). The
diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose, DE52) was purchased from Whatman (Dassel- Germany).

Cells
Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes were grown at 28ºC in a Warren culture medium [37 g/l
brain heart infusion, 100 ng/l hemin, 100 mg/l folic acid] supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The
3

6

cells were seeded in 75 cm tissue culture plates at 1 x 10 cells/ml. C. fasciculate cultures were
incubated until they reached the exponential phase (approximately 24 h of incubation). Using daily
subculturing, the cells were maintained in the exponential growth phase for use in the studies. Cell

counting was performed in a Neubauer chamber. The cells were evaluated for viability using the optical
microscopic observation of flagellar motility and by counting of the number of viable cells after incubation
with 2% trypan blue in PBS.

Magnetic Nanoparticles
The MNPs used in the present study were synthesized using a precipitation of iron (II) salt
(FeSO4) in the presence of a base (NaOH) and a mild oxidant (KNO3) under a Nitrogen atmosphere, as
previously described in the literature

21

. Mixing the reactants during a 24 h period resulted in Fe3O4

particles with average sizes of <d> ≈ 30 nm and with a colloidal stability in aqueous medium at pH 7.

Cell uptake of MNPs and separation of the non-incorporated
nanoparticles.
The cells collected during exponential growth phase were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh
8

culture medium, adjusting concentrations to 2.5 x 10 cells/ml. The MNPs were added to a final
o

concentration of 0.425 mg/ml and were incubated at 28 C overnight with gentle agitation. To separate the
cells from the non-incorporated MNPs, we took advantage of the fact that MNPs (isoelectric point= 5.0)
adsorb to DEAE-cellulose resin at pH 7.0 (isoelectric point = 2.5), whereas C. fasciculata does not
interact with the resin under these conditions. Briefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended
in 12 ml of 2% glucose in PBS (gPBS), and incubated with 6 g DEAE-cellulose ionic exchange resin that
was previously equilibrated with gPBS for 10 min with gentle agitation at room temperature. The cells
were recovered with an efficiency of more than 95%.

Determination of cell-incorporated MNPs by magnetization
measurements
The amounts of cell-associated MNPs were determined by measuring the saturation
magnetization using a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) (MPMS-7T, Quantum

Design). The magnetization measurements were conducted on dried MNPs or lyophilized MNP-loaded
cells and were performed as a function of the applied magnetic field up to 5 kOe (0.4 MA/m) at different
temperatures between 5 and 300 K.

Experiments of time-varying magnetic field application
9

Aliquots of MNPs (10 mg/ml) or MNP-bearing cells (1.7x10 cells/ml) were submitted to
alternating magnetic fields using a homemade AC-field applicator. The magnetic field applicator,
consisting of a resonant LC tank working close to the resonant frequency, was used to measure the
specific power absorption (SPA) of the samples. A magnetic field (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m) was
achieved inside a gap of four (2+2) turns of a copper tube around high-permeability polar pieces. The
SPA values were obtained from adiabatic measurements inside an insulated Dewar. The temperature
TM

data was measured using a fiber-optic temperature probe (Reflex , Neoptix) that was immune to the
radiofrequency environment. Prior to each experiment, the temperature evolution was measured between
the 5 and 10 min time points with the RF-source turned off to establish a T-baseline. Next, the power was
turned on, and the temperature rise was monitored for a 30 min interval.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Cells in the exponential growth phase were fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldheyde in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate 3% sucrose solution for 90 min at 4ºC. The dehydration process was conducted by incubating
the cells in increasing concentrations of methanol at 30, 50, 70, and 100%. Each of these concentrations
were used for 5 minutes in duplicate, and a final step was conducted using anhydride methanol for 10
minutes. A drop of the dehydrated cells in suspension was placed over a coverslip. Next, when the
methanol was evaporated, the coverslip was gold coated. The samples were then observed using
scanning electron microscopy (EDX Hitachi S-3400 N, Instituto Carboquimica CSIC). Secondary electron
images were also performed.

(MNPs /TVMF , MNPs /TVMF , MNPs /TVMF or MNPs /TVMF ) were resuspended in 100 µl of Warren
culture medium. Next, 40 µL of MTT dye solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each aliquot. After 4 h
of incubation in eppendorf tubes at 28°C, formazan crystals were dissolved by the addition of 100 µL of
10% SDS. All of the cell debris, which has been shown to interfere with the assay, was removed by
centrifugation (10 min at 12000 r.p.m). Next, the absorbance of each supernatant was read using a
microplate reader (Biotek ELX800) at 570 nm. The spectrophotometer was calibrated to zero absorbance
using a culture medium without cells. The relative cell viability (%) compared with the control cells (the
exponential-phase cells not submitted to any treatment) was calculated by
[Absorbance]test/[Absorbance]control x 100. Each measurement was repeated at least five times to
obtain mean values with standard deviations.

Flow cytometry
The cell viability was also measured using flow cytometry with the commercial apoptosis detection kit
6

purchased from Immunostep. Briefly, 1x10 cells of each sample were resuspended in Annexin-binding
buffer, were stained with 5 ml of Annexin and 5 ml of propidium iodide, and were incubated for 15 minutes
at room temperature in the dark. The cell analysis was performed using the FACSAria Cytometer
(Becktom Dickinson) and FACSDiva Software.

Results and discussion
The magnetic and physicochemical properties of the MNPs used in the present study were
reported elsewhere.

22

The magnetic colloids were composed of cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles of average

size <d> = 30 ± 8 nm with saturation magnetization at room temperature of 85 emu/g, which is close to

that of the bulk magnetite magnetization.

23

This synthesis route resulted in magnetic colloids with
=

isoelectric point of 5.0, electrostatically stabilized due to the adsorption of SO4 groups on the particle
surface. The ability to dissipate heat under a TVMF of any type of MNPs is measured by the specific
power absorption (SPA) given in watts per gram of magnetic material, which for the present MNPs and
experimental conditions (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m) was found to be 83.6 W/g,
values reported in the literature for Fe3O4 particles of similar size.

24-26

22

comparable to other SPA

The selection of MNPs was made

based on the known dependence of the SPA values on the average particle size and size distribution.
Indeed, the strong dependence of the Nèel relaxation-based model on particle size yields a maximum
4

value of SPA for magnetite MNPs within a narrow range of diameters <d> around 15-30 nm, as
experimentally confirmed in many colloidal systems yields.

3,19,21

The precise value for this maximum will

depend on other magnetic properties of the MNPs such as magnetic anisotropy and saturation
magnetization.
The optimal experimental conditions for the C. fasciculata to incorporate the MNPs were
determined by a series of experiments as a function of the incubation time, incubating C. fasciculata with
a fixed MNP concentration for increasing times from 15 to 240 min. After the incubation, the nonincorporated MNPs were separated by the column method already detailed in the Materials and Methods
section. The incorporated mass of magnetic material per cell was determined by measuring the saturation
magnetization MS of 100 ml of culture medium containing ≈10 cells and comparing these values with the
9

MS of the pure colloid.

27

From these data and the average particle size, the average number of

incorporated MNPs per cell was calculated (Table 1). The number of incorporated MNPs decreased from
8

6

a maximum of approximately 10 NPs/cell after 15 min of incubation to approximately 10 NPs/cell after 1
h of incubation. Shorter incubation times resulted in a low and highly variable cell charging, possibly due
to the fact that the cells require an induction time to activate the biological mechanisms to incorporate the
MNPs. The time course of this decrease of the cell-associated MNPs followed an exponential decay
2

(R =0.9998), reaching a near-steady state after approximately 1 h incubation, which remained essentially
constant up to 12 h of incubation (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). From these

8

Magnetic hyperthermia as a potential trypanocidal therapy.

experiments, we established the 15 min incubation as being the optimal condition for charging the cells
with a reproducible and defined number of MNPs/cell.
To evaluate the suitability of the MNPs for hyperthermia applications, it was necessary to assess
the influence of these NPs on cell viability and on the incorporation and separation conditions. It was
observed that, when compared with exponential-phase cells, the NP-treated or mock-treated cultures that
were submitted to separation conditions (incubated with DEAE-cellulose resin in gPBS) remained more
than 95% viable (data not shown). This finding illustrated that the observed cell death in the subsequent
experiments was not due to the previous exposure of the cells to toxic conditions.

Hyperthermia experiments
After the best conditions for maximum uptake of MNPs by the cells were determined (15 min
incubation, as stated above), the hyperthermia experiments were performed. The experiments were
designed in a 2x2-row-column format (Fig. 2), in which the four groups were defined as follows: a. cells
-

-

not-bearing MNPs that were not-submitted to TVMFs (MNPs /TVMF ); b. cells bearing MNPs that were

-

not-submitted to the magnetic field application (MNPs /TVMF ); c. cells not-bearing the MNPs that were
-

+

+

+

submitted to the magnetic field application (MNPs /TVMF ); and d. cells bearing the MNPs that were
submitted to the magnetic field application (MNPs /TVMF ). The effects on cell viability of the above
mentioned treatments were evaluated using several criteria, including the direct observation of the cell
motility using optical microscopic observation, the mitochondrial activity using a MTT assay, and the
detailed morphology using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The qualitative observation of the
+

samples that were examined using the previously described treatments revealed that the MNPs /TVMF

population caused 100% cell death (Fig. 2, supplementary material). The quantitative analysis of the cells
using a MTT assay revealed that the cell viability of all of the other samples was not affected compared
-

-

with the control (MNPs /TVMF ) (Fig. 3). The analysis of all four samples using SEM revealed severe
+

+

structural damage in the cell morphology only for the MNPs /TVMF population, particularly at the level of
the cell surface, indicating severe plasma membrane damage (Fig. 4).

Cell death
Because the application of the TVMFs was performed in an adiabatic device, the hyperthermia
treatment could have produced a transient macroscopic increase of the sample temperature due to
differences in the rates of heat generation and dissipation. When a positive control experiment was
conducted by applying a TVMF to a suspension that only contained MNPs (Fig. 5), the sample showed a
large increase of temperature, of about 50ºC along the 30 minutes of the experiment. Therefore, we
tested whether a similar increase in average temperature might have contributed to the amount of cell
death by monitoring the temperature of the extracellular medium during the application of the TVMF. The
results on both control and magnetically loaded cells showed only a slight macroscopic increase in
temperature (about 2-4 ºC) after 30 min of TVMF application. This result (i.e., the absence of temperature
increase in the samples composed of magnetically-loaded cells) is the expected based on the much lower
‘average concentration’ of MNPs in these samples, since the small amounts of uploaded MNPs are
contained within a total volume of about 0.5 ml of liquid cell medium.
These results clearly demonstrate that the heat released from the MNPs was not enough to
increase the average temperature of the cell culture in such a way that would compromise the viability of
the cells. Therefore, the origin of the cell death that was measured after the application of the TVMF
should not be related to thermal stress. This is in agreement with previous works on magnetically-loaded
human dendritic cells

19,28

, which demonstrated that application of TVMF for 30 min yielded up to 90-95 %

of cell death, without affecting blank (i.e., without MNPs) cells. Similar reports have been reported in
HeLa cell line

loaded with MNPs. Some theoretical models on metal nanoparticles have suggested this

Since the temperature was essentially constant during experiments, the observed cell death

suggests an intracellular, MNP-triggered mechanism different from the temperature-induced apoptosis by
hyperthermia. However, as the temperature was measured with a macroscopic sensor, the possibility of
intracellular heating up to apoptotic temperatures cannot be excluded.
To evaluate the plausibility of intracellular heating during our experiments, a simplified heat
transfer model at the single-cell scale was considered, e.g. a single cell magnetically loaded with MNPs,
surrounded by a large matrix of unloaded cells (or just culture medium free of MNPs). We estimated the
10

Magnetic hyperthermia as a potential trypanocidal therapy.

expected intracellular temperature increase in such a case based on a) the measured mass of MNPs at
the intracellular medium; b) the calculated average cell volume from SEM images (230±50 mm ), and c)
3

the measured SPA values of the pure magnetic colloid. For simplicity, we further approximated the
specific heat capacity of a single cell to the pure water value CP = 4.18 J/(g.K). From the average cell
volume and MNPs upload (1-10 pg/cell), we estimated a temperature increase rate of 0.02-0.87 K/s. The
above calculations were made considering that no heat was dissipated from the intracellular medium to
the cell environment, a clearly unrealistic hypothesis. Since the cell membrane has a non-negligible
thermal conductivity, the calculated heating rates are not enough to rise the intracellular temperature up
to the 41-45 ºC needed for triggering thermally induced apoptotic mechanisms.
Several prior studies suggest that apoptosis-related mechanisms are a main cause of hyperthermiaassociated cell death

31,19

. Apoptosis (cellular programmed death) is a precise mechanism in which cells

follow a programmed sequence of events to induce their death with minimal disturbance to the total cell
population.

32

This phenomenon appears to be present in a wide range of organisms, from primitive

single-cell to higher multi-cellular eukaryotes. In the present work, we investigated whether cell death by
magnetic hyperthermia of C. fasciculata was attributable to apoptosis. An early event that is considered
as a marker of apoptosis is the exposition of phosphatidylserine on the external surface of the plasma
membrane. The cells that incorporated nanoparticles, and the controls, that were either submitted or not
submitted to the magnetic field, were incubated with annexin (used to detect the presence of
phosphatidylserine) and propidium iodide (used to detect damage to the plasma membrane). Next, these
four populations of cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the results confirm

the 100% viability for the MNPs /TVMF MNPs /TVMF and MNPs /TVMF cell samples and the 0%
+

+

viability of the MNPs /TVMF cells. In this last case, it was observed that the cells were reactive to
annexin and permeable to propidium iodide, indicating plasma membrane damage, which was confirmed
using SEM (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the application of a TVMF to cells that have incorporated
magnetic nanoparticles results in cell death via a non-apoptotic mechanism. Recent works on the
application of TVMF on magnetically-loaded cells showed that a large decrease in cell viability can be
achieved without actual temperature increase of the cell medium.

11

29,33

Furthermore, it has been reported

Magnetic hyperthermia as a potential trypanocidal therapy.

that in the case of magnetically-loaded dendritic cells the percentage of cell death was proportional to the
amount of uptaken MNPs. As the cell death observed in our work correspond to the maximum amount of
uploaded MNPs (i.e., after 15 min of co-cultivation), it is still to be determined whether a similar effect
could be achieved with smaller amounts of uploaded MNPs.
Taken together, our results lead us to propose that in this case, the whole irreversible cell injury due to
+

+

mechanical stress (evidenced by SEM) in MNPs /TVMF cell samples is the main cause of death.
Theoretical calculations on the effect of the power released by MNPs on the cell membrane supports this
hypothesis.

34

However, it is worth mentioning that other factors, such as the liberation of toxic proteins

into the cytoplasm due to the disruption of membranes compartmentalizing them inside specific
organelles like lysosomes, cannot be ruled out as simultaneous cause of cell injury and death.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the series of experiments reported here demonstrated, as a proof of principle, that
magnetically induced hyperthermia causes microorganism death. Our results also illustrate that
hyperthermia is a thermal phenomenon of a subcellular scale because no macroscopic increase of
temperature was observed. We were able to show that hyperthermia was specific for cells that
incorporated MNPs and were submitted to the TVMF because neither NPs nor the TVMF alone resulted
in a loss of viability. Lastly, the cells that were submitted to the hyperthermia treatment were dramatically
damaged at the plasma membrane level. It should be stressed that although this methodology is being
extensively investigated and is currently used for mammalian cells, to our knowledge, this method is not
currently being proposed to treat diseases that are caused by microorganisms. The present study
highlights this method (at least as a proof of principle) as a potential and novel alternative to treat
infections caused by microorganisms. A major advantage of this method is that it causes selective
physical damage to the target cells. Therefore, the probability of the emergency of resistance strains is
small. More detailed studies are also being conducted to identify the mechanisms involved in cell death at
a greater level of detail. Developing delivery systems that have the capability of specifically directing

12

magnetic nanoparticles to infectious agents remains a challenge. These findings lead us to propose this
method as a novel strategy to develop new therapeutics against pathogenic microorganisms.
