The radical pair model has been successful in explaining behavioral characteristics of the geomagnetic compass believed to underlie the navigation capability of certain avian species. In this study,
the spin dynamics of the radical pair model and decoherence therein are interpreted from a microscopic state transition point of view. This helps to elucidate the interplay between the hyperfine
and Zeeman interactions that enables the avian compass, and the distinctive effects of nuclear and
environmental decoherence on it. Using a quantum information theoretic quantifier of coherence,
we find that nuclear decoherence induces new structure in the spin dynamics without materially
affecting the compass action; environmental decoherence, on the other hand, completely disrupts it.

INTRODUCTION

Overt quantum effects seem to play a key role in the
functionality of a number of biological systems, e.g. excitonic transport in photosynthetic pigments, coherent spin
dynamics in avian magnetoreception, inelastic electron
tunneling in olfaction, and hydrogen tunneling in enzyme
catalysis [1–11]. This is not only intriguing from a physics
perspective – given the noisy high-temperature ambience
in these situations – but also promises to reveal robust
ways to harness ‘quantumness’ for engineering new and
improved systems, both biomimetic and otherwise.
In this work we study avian magnetoreception, which
is responsible for the geomagnetic field assisted navigation ability of various bird species [9, 10]. A radical pair
(RP) model, comprising photo-excited unpaired spins
along with an anisotropic hyperfine interaction, has been
proposed as a possible mechanism [12–15]. This kind
of a model is supported both by spin chemistry findings [16–19] and by behavioral experiments on certain
bird species, e.g. the European Robin [11, 13, 20, 21].
One of the central quests in RP model studies is the
determination of the role of quantum effects especially
coherence, including nuclear and environmental decoherence effects, in the spin dynamics [22–26]. A few
groups [21, 23, 27, 28] have established the presence of
long coherence in RP spin states. Others [25] have quantified coherence using a quantum interferometer analogy
and statistically concluded that global electron-nuclear
coherence is a resource for chemical compass by observing sensitivity as a function of global coherence. Tiersch
and Briegel identify nuclear decoherence as a necessary
ingredient for the magnetosensitive spin dynamics of the
RP system [22]. Apart from coherence, Gauger et al.
and Cai et al. have studied the role of entanglement

in the compass action of the RP model [24, 27]. However, the distinct operational role of nuclear and environmental decoherence in RP spin dynamics is still unclear. Understanding this is essential to the appropriate
selection/engineering of materials for solid state emulation of RP spin dynamics, and possibly other quantum
biomimetic applications.
In this work, we take a microscopic view of radical pair
spin dynamics, analyzing the distinctive role of nuclear
and environmental decoherence, and examine their specific effects in its magnetosensitive behavior. We look at
the state transitions involved in radical pair spin state
evolution and elucidate the effect of nuclear and environmental decoherence on these transitions. Our conclusions
are validated by applying an information theoretic measure of coherence. Further, our spin transition point of
view provides new insights into the role of Zeeman and
hyperfine interactions in the magnetosensitive dynamics
of the RP spin system. We also revisit some of earlier
RP model results from this new perspective.
The salient characteristics of avian magnetoreception
have been demonstrated by multiple behavioral experiments. Firstly, it exhibits a certain dynamic range
around the geomagnetic field. This dynamic range behavior is versatile, in that it adapts to a new Zeeman
field if the bird is exposed long enough to it [21]. Secondly, the compass action is found to be disrupted by
an external RF field of a particular frequency. Both of
these features are, in fact, well-explained within the RP
model [21, 23, 29].
In the RP system, we effectively have a three spin
system evolving under a Hamiltonian that contains two
interactions – hyperfine and Zeeman. The singlet and
triplet radicals recombine distinctly thus leading to different products. The final yield corresponding to singlet and
triplet states depends on the magnetic field. Strikingly,
however, we find that the Zeeman interaction alone is not
sufficient to make the final yields dependent on the magnetic field orientation (angle between geomagnetic field

2
and radical pair axis); neither can the hyperfine interaction on its own cause spin transitions from the singlet
to all three triplet states, and thereby impart magnetic
sensitivity. It is the interplay between the Zeeman and
the hyperfine interactions that makes the overall spin dynamics magnetosensitive.
This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we investigate the state transitions involved in the RP spin
dynamics. In Sec. III and IV, we examine the roles of
nuclear and environmental decoherence respectively. In
Sec. V, we present our conclusions and perspective for
solid state emulation of the avian compass.
SPIN DYNAMICS OF THE RADICAL PAIR

In order to study the spin transitions involved in the
RP dynamics, we choose a representative RP system in
which an unpaired spin on each of two radicals, and a
single nucleus on one of them is responsible for an hyperfine interaction therein. This model may be directly extrapolated to multinuclear systems [27, 30]. The nucleus
preferentially interacts with the spin on the same radical
and both the spins interact with the geomagnetic Zeeman
field. Therefore, the RP Hamiltonian looks like [27]:

Here k (= 5 × 105 s−1 ) is the singlet and triplet radical
recombination rate. We note that this method is equivalent to the Haberkorn approach to modeling radical pair
dynamics [19, 25, 27] but is more amenable for discerning the spin transitions involved in the compass action.
The system starts in the state ρ(0) = 12 I ⊗ (|si ⊗ hs|).
The ensuing spin evolution involves intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states. It is accompanied
by a spin dependent recombination process in which singlet and triplet radical pairs recombine through different channels; it is this Zeeman field dependent differen-

γ = µ0 g is gyromagnetic ratio, µ0 is Bohr magneton and
g is electron g-factor (= 2). We consider the illustrative
case in which the hyperfine tensor A = diag(0, 0, a) [30].
The external field (geomagnetic field) is characterized by
B = B0 (sinθcosφ, sinθsinφ, cosθ); B0 (= 47µT ) is the
local geomagnetic field at Frankfurt [21] and θ is the
magnetic field orientation. The axial symmetry of hyperfine tensor allows us to take φ = 0 [27]. The RP
spin dynamics starts at the instant of radical pair generation, which is taken to be t = 0. The initial state
of the radical pair is usually taken to be singlet state
(|si) with the nuclear spin completely depolarized owing to its interaction with the neighboring soft matter
environment [13, 27, 31]. We adopt the quantum master equation approach to simulate the dynamics of the
RP system, similar to Gauger et al. [27] but modified
to highlight the exact spin transitions. Intrinsically, the
Hilbert space is eight dimensional. The spin-dependent
relaxation process happens through two channels – the
singlet channel whereby radical pairs in the |si state recombine and triplet channel whereby radical pairs in the
three triplet states |t0 i, |t− i and |t+ i recombine – which
are included as ‘shelving’ states in the Hilbert space. In
order to distinguish the spin transitions, we resolve the
triplet channel into its three constituent channels corresponding to |t0 i, |t+ i and |t− i. This is accommodated
by augmenting the eight dimensional Hilbert space with
four additional shelving states denoted as |Si, |T0 i, |T+ i,
and |T− i .

This method is quite versatile for the calculation of the
yield corresponding to various spin states. The recombination of radical pair into singlet and triplet channels is
modeled through decay operators in the master equation

transition pathways between |si, |t0 i, |t+ i, |t− i make the final spin yields angle dependent. Simultaneous Zeeman and
anisotropic hyperfine plays collaborative role in inducing these
transitions which ultimately lead to magnetosensitive product
yield.(The various transitions induced by anisotropic hyperfine and Zeeman interactions are shown in the state transition
diagram, Fig. 2.) Additionally, we observe a conspicuous peak
appearing in S yield for a range of hyperfine constants.This
peak corresponds to the dip in T+ and T− yields. We recognize that this peak appears due to nuclear decoherence.

tial spin yield which is used by the avian neural system
to sense the geomagnetic field [12, 27, 30], although the
neurological processes involved are not yet fully understood [28]. Our aim in this manuscript is to explain:
one, the details of the spin transitions responsible for
the magnetosensitive yield, and two, the role of coherent evolution of electron pair spins and decoherence due
to nucleus and environment in the overall functioning of
chemical compass model of the avian magnetoreception.
In order to examine the spin transitions in the RP
model, we simulate RP dynamics for a large number
of hyperfine interaction strengths. For our choice of
hyperfine coupling tensor, the Hamiltonian looks like:
Ĥ = γB · (Sˆ1 + Sˆ2 ) + aIˆz Sˆ2z . Here, we vary the hyperfine
coupling strength from γB0 /100 (very small compared to
the Zeeman strength) to 100γB0 (very large compared to
the Zeeman strength) and examine the singlet and various triplet yields with respect to the orientation of the
geomagnetic field. The results are presented in Fig. 1
from which we infer the following spin transitions are associated with various terms in the Hamiltonian:
(i) The hyperfine interaction induces the |si ↔ |t0 i transition but does nothing to |t+ i and |t− i states.
(ii) The x-component of Zeeman interaction induces the
|t− i ↔ |t0 i ↔ |t+ i transitions but leaves the |si state
alone. Similar is the case with y-component of Zeeman
interaction.
(iii) The z-component of Zeeman interaction does not induce any inter-spin transition.
These results have been confirmed analytically in Appendix A. They are also in agreement with the findings
of B. M. Xu et al. where these transitions follow from
inspection of the Hamiltonian in {|si, |t0 i,|t+ i, |t− i} basis [32]. The spin-state transitions induced by the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions as obtained above are
summarized in Fig. 2.
For example in Fig. 1, at θ = 0◦ , the Hamiltonian
comprises the hyperfine and z-component of the Zeeman
interaction; therefore, in accordance with (i) and (iii),
the spin evolution corresponds to the coherent mixing be-

and the normalized relative entropy of coherence (red) as a

relative entropy of coherence serves as a measure of coherence [33]. The dip in coherence corresponding to the peak in
singlet yield indicates that the peaks in singlet yield in Fig. 1
are due to nuclear decoherence. This fact is further affirmed
by the singlet yield curve obtained when the nuclear and the
radical pair spin states are disentangled, cf. Appendix B.

tween |si ↔ |t0 i and the singlet yield saturates at 0.50 for
larger hyperfine interaction which corresponds to strong
mixing within the recombination timescale. On the other
extreme, at θ = 90◦ , the Hamiltonian comprises the hyperfine interaction and x-component of the Zeeman interaction; based on (i) and (ii), spin transition pathways
now exist between all the four spin states by the collective
effect of the two interactions and the yields corresponding to all spin states saturate to 0.25 for larger hyperfine
interaction strength. Thus, the compass action in the RP
model is a consequence of the collective spin dynamical
behavior due to the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions.

III.

NUCLEAR DECOHERENCE

From Fig. 1, we also observe that there is a conspicuous peak appearing in the singlet yield whose position
depends on the hyperfine coupling strength; there are
corresponding dips in |T+ i and |T− i yields suggesting a
mechanism that blocks the spin transition pathways from
|si to |t+ i and |t− i. We find that the singlet yield peak
vanishes when we disentangle the nuclear and electronic
spin dynamics while retaining the effect of the hyperfine
interaction, indicating that the peak is actually due to
nuclear decoherence. Using a quantum information theoretic quantifier of coherence – the relative entropy of
coherence [33] – we seek to establish a connection between the singlet yield peak and nuclear decoherence.
The coherence is characterized in the computational basis of the three spin system. If ρ is the density matrix

where S(ρ) is von Neumann entropy corresponding to ρ

ρ. The normalized singlet yield and normalized relative

can now be understood as a consequence of peaks in the
singlet yield and thus a direct manifestation of the nuclear decoherence. Other results reported in that work
can also be interpreted along similar lines – that is, by
considering the spin state transitions induced by each of
the Hamiltonian terms.

noise rates, calculated for six different hyperfine coupling
strengths. Expectedly, the effect of the environmental
noise is most substantial when the noise rate is equal to
or greater than the recombination rate k ; in these cases,
we find that the compass sensitivity goes to zero. This
indicates that environmental noise opens the spin transition pathways between the singlet state and all triplet
states and thereby homogenizing the yields corresponding to all the spin states. Therefore, the singlet yield
saturates to 0.25, as shown for the case in which the
noise rate (Γ) is greater than k.

CONCLUSION

In this study, we elucidate the essential spin dynamics of the radical pair model for avian magnetoreception
and inspect the distinct effects of nuclear and environmental decoherence therein. We find that the Zeeman
and hyperfine interactions play collaborative roles to enable the compass action. In particular, we have identified
the dual role played by the nucleus: while the anisotropic
nuclear interaction is necessary to induce spin transitions
that make the RP dynamics magneto-sensitive, decoherence due to the nucleus introduces additional structure
in the dynamics but does not affect the compass action.
On the other hand, decoherence due to the environment
tends to make the singlet yield insensitive to the geomagnetic field orientation by opening transition pathways between all the spin states; as expected, this destroys the
compass action. We think that our approach of understanding the sensitivity of the avian compass – in terms
of spin-state transitions induced by each of the Hamiltonian terms, and its limitation – in terms of nuclear and
environmental decoherence, may suggest guidelines for
its solid state emulation. The diamond nitrogen vacancy
center spin system seems to be a potential solid state
candidate for this purpose owing to its room temperature long coherence time and two spin relaxation pathways [34–36]. However, a lot of work remains to be done
before this, or any other solid state system, can emulate
the avian compass and thereby open the path towards
geomagnetic field assisted navigation systems.

ENVIRONMENTAL DECOHERENCE

We adopt the environmental noise model from Gauger
et al. [27]. Mathematically, we consider the following six
noise operators: L1 = I2 ⊗ σx ⊗ I2 , L2 = I2 ⊗ σy ⊗ I2 ,
L3 = I2 ⊗ σz ⊗ I2 , L4 = I2 ⊗ I2 ⊗ σx , L5 = I2 ⊗ I2 ⊗ σy ,

By tracing out the nuclear part, we get the radical pair

The results of these calculations are summarized in Table. I. These results are also in agreement with the results
of B. M. Xu et al. [32].

Appendix B: Nuclear Decoherence

The singlet yield shown in Fig. 1 shows a peak in the
curve. The peaks are hypothesized to be due to nuclear decoherence which is also verified by quantifying
the nuclear decoherence by relative entropy [33], shown
in Fig. 3. Here, we present yet another evidence that the
singlet yield peaks are the consequence of nuclear decoherence. We calculate the singlet yield by disentangling
the radical pair state from the nuclear state i.e. instead

these are due to nuclear decoherence.

plot establishes the fact that environmental noise opens
up the spin transition pathways between the singlet state
and all triplet states and thereby homogenizing the yields
corresponding to all the spin states. Thus environmental
noise washes away the sensitivity of the avian compass.
