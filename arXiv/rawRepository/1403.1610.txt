Abstract The relationship between components of biochemical network and the resulting dynamics of the overall system is a key focus of computational biology. However, as these networks and resulting mathematical models are inherently complex
and non-linear, the understanding of this relationship becomes challenging. Among
many approaches, model reduction methods provide an avenue to extract components responsible for the key dynamical features of the system. Unfortunately, these
approaches often require intuition to apply. In this manuscript we propose a practical
algorithm for the reduction of biochemical reaction systems using fast-slow asympThis study was supported in part by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) grants BBF0059381 and BBF5290031. Dr P. Paszek holds a BBSRC David Phillips Research Fellowship (BB/I017976/1).

totics. This method allows the ranking of system variables according to how quickly
they approach their momentary steady state, thus selecting the fastest for a steady
state approximation. We applied this method to derive models of the Nuclear Factor
kappa B network, a key regulator of the immune response that exhibits oscillatory
dynamics. Analyses with respect to two specific solutions, which corresponded to
different experimental conditions identified different components of the system that
were responsible for the respective dynamics. This is an important demonstration of
how reduction methods that provide approximations around a specific steady state,
could be utilised in order to gain a better understanding of network topology in a
broader context.

1 Introduction
Biological systems are inherently complex. They are governed by a large number
of functionally diverse components, which interact selectively and nonlinearly to
achieve coherent outcomes (Kitano, 2002). Systems biology addresses this complexity by integrating biological experiments with computational methods, to understand
how the components of a system interact and contribute to the biological function.
However, the dynamical models that represent biological systems can often have
high-dimensional state space and depend on a large number of parameters. Understanding the relationships between structure, parameters and function of such large
systems is often a challenging and computationally intensive task.
One example of such a complex and high-dimensional system is the signalling
network of the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κ B) transcription factor. NF-κ B dynamics affects cell fate through the action of dimeric transcription factors that regulate
immune responses, cell proliferation and apoptosis (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008). In
unstimulated cells NF-κ B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with the
Inhibitor kappaB (Iκ B) family of proteins. Upon stimulation with cytokines, such as
Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNFα ), the Iκ Bs are degraded releasing NF-κ B to the
nucleus where it activates the transcription of over 300 target genes (Hoffmann and
Baltimore, 2006). Single cell fluorescence imaging has shown that upon continuous
TNFα stimulation NF-κ B exhibits nuclear-to-cytoplasmic oscillations with a period
of approximately 100 minutes (Nelson et al, 2004). This period is critical for maintaining downstream gene expression (Ashall et al, 2009). The oscillatory dynamics
emerge through the interplay of a number of negative and positive feedback genes that
are under the transcription control of NF-κ B. These, among others, include the Iκ B
and A20 inhibitors, and cytokines such as TNFα (figure 1) (Hoffmann and Baltimore,
2006). In order to understand this intricate feedback regulation various mathematical
models of the NF-κ B signalling network have been proposed (Hoffmann et al, 2002;
Lipniacki et al, 2004; Mengel et al, 2012; Turner et al, 2010). However, the overall
system is not fully resolved.

of the NF-κ B system. Time-dependent variables present in each model are depicted with black colour.
Pointed and round arrowheads represent activating and inhibitory reactions, respectively. In unstimulated
conditions NF-κ B is sequestered in the cytoplasm by association with Iκ Bα inhibitors. Stimulation with
TNFα (by changing k24 = 1 from 0) causes activation of the IKK kinase, and subsequently degradation of
Iκ Bα and translocation of free NF-κ B to the nucleus. Nuclear NF-κ B induces transcription of Iκ Bα and
A20. Once synthesised Iκ Bα is able to bind to NF-κ B and return it to the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits
the IKK activity.

The large number of variables and biochemical reactions in dynamic models,
such as those of the NF-κ B system, makes them analytically intractable. Sensitivity
analyses are often employed to understand these models, assessing how individual
parameters influence model dynamics in a local and global context (Ihekwaba et al,
2004, 2005; Rand, 2008). Model reduction approaches provide a complementary avenue to extract the core reactions and variables responsible for the key dynamical
features of the system. These include modularisation to break large systems down
into more tractable functional units (Saez-Rodriguez et al, 2004). However, definition of a module becomes arbitrary, so this remains a heuristic technique. Other
techniques include using a posterori analysis and characteristic timescales. Based on
error analysis, the former method identifies, for different time intervals, the components of the model required for accurate representation of the solution and uses this
information to guide model simplification (Whiteley, 2010). The latter utilises the
fact that many biological systems incorporate markedly different time-scales ranging
from seconds to hours. Relevant approaches employ the use of partial-equilibriums
(PE), quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSA), or grouping variables with equivalent time-scales (Krishna et al, 2006; Maeda et al, 1998; Schneider and Wilhelm,
2000), see also (Kutumova et al, 2013) and Radulescu et al (2008) for analysis of
the NF-kappaB signalling. These methods often rely on intuition to identify the small
parameters that allow the successive reduction steps, and a standard problem for perturbation methods is that in reality the small parameters are never infinitely small
and one needs somehow to assess whether they are small enough for any particular
purpose, that is, additional accuracy control is required. Algorithmic approaches to
identification of small parameters been proposed. For instance, Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) method is an iterative procedure, based on identification of

the fast modes through the analysis of of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix (Lam
and Goussis, 1994), see also (Kourdis et al, 2013) for the asymptotic analysis of the
NF-kB dynamics. Other methods exploiting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are the
Intrinsic Low-Dimensional Manifolds (ILDM) method by Maas and Pope (1992) and
a more refined Method of Invariant Manifold by Gorban and Karlin (2003). Comparison and analysis of these methods can be found in (Zagaris et al, 2004). Although
these methods are more advanced that the classical PE and QSSA techniques, they
are also more technically challenging than their predecessors. QSSA methods retain original variables and parameters. Alternative methods, such as the Elimination
of Nonessential Variables (ENVA) method described in (Danø et al, 2006) exploit
searches through lower-dimensional models of reduced networks for a minimal mathematical model which will reproduce a desired dynamic behaviour of the full model.
Such a systematic reduction method has the advantage of requiring neither knowledge of the minimal structures, nor re-parameterisation of the retained lumped model
components. Indeed, application of model reduction methods which are algorithmic
rather than necessarily biologically intuitive can clearly reveal model sub-structures
which control basic system dynamics.
In this manuscript we use a simple algorithmic QSSA approach for the reduction
of biochemical reaction systems using a heuristic that is likely to be widely applicable
to this sort of systems. We define “speed coefficients” that enable ranking variables
according to how quickly their approach their momentary steady-state. This allows
a straightforward choice of variables for elimination by QSSA application at each
step of the algorithm, while preserving dynamic characteristics of the system. We use
this method to derive reduced models of the NF-κ B signalling network. Our analysis identifies the key feedback components of the system responsible for NF-κ B
dynamics. Further, reduction of the NF-κ B model around different solutions (corresponding to different experimental protocols) revealed specific components of the
IKK signalling module responsible for generation of the respective dynamics. This
demonstrates the application of an essentially local technique can be used to infer
information about the system in a larger context, ultimately providing a better understanding of the NF-κ B signalling network.

2 Methods
2.1 Perturbation theory for fast-slow systems
The application of steady-state approximation to biochemical reaction systems typically argues that some of the reagents are highly reactive, so are used as quickly as
they are made. Therefore, after the initial transient phase, the concentration of such
a reagent is always close to what would be its steady-state as long as concentrations
of other reagents were maintained constant. In the simplest form, this means that
in the kinetic equations, the corresponding rate of change can be set to zero. This
provides a general procedure for simplifying biochemical systems, based on the difference of characteristic time-scales. Practical application of this idea dates back at
least to Briggs and Haldane (1925). More recent reviews and textbook expositions

can be found e.g. in (Klonowski, 1983; Segel and Slemrod, 1989; Volpert and Hudjaev, 1985; Yablonskii et al, 1991). The basic mathematical justification of the formal
procedures stems from the seminal work by Tikhonov (1952). It is formulated for
systems which involve small parameter ε in the form
dx
= f (x, z,t) ,
dt
dz
ε = g (x, z,t) ,
dt

(1)

where x is a vector of slow variables and z is the vector of fast variables. In the limit
ε → 0, the system (1) becomes
dx
= f (x, z,t) ,
dt
z = φ (x,t) ,

(2)

where φ (x,t) is the solution of g (x, z,t) = 0. If ε is small, the solutions to the original
system (1) may be expected to differ from solutions of (2) only slightly. For an initialvalue problem for a finite time interval this is guaranteed by the following:
Theorem 1 Let the right-hand sides of systems (1) and (2) be sufficiently smooth so
solutions to initial value problems exist and are unique. Let x = X(t; ε ), z = Z(t; ε ),
t ∈ [0, T ], T > 0 be a solution of the system (1) with initial condition X(0; ε ) = x0 ,
Z(0; ε ) = z0 , and x = X̄(t) be a solution to the system (2) with initial condition X̄(0) =
x0 . Consider also the “attached” system,
dz
= g (x, z,t) ,
ds

(3)

depending on x and t as parameters. Let z = φ (x,t) be a function defined on an
open set containing the trajectory {(X̄(t),t),t ∈ [0, T ]}, such that z = φ (X̄(t),t) is
an isolated, Lyapunov stable and asymptotically stable equilibrium of (3) for the
corresponding x = X̄(t) and any t ∈ [0, T ]. Finally, assume that z0 is within the basin
of attraction of the equilibrium φ (x0 , 0) of system (3) at x = x0 , t = 0. Then for any
t ∈ (0, T ],
lim X(t; ε ) = X̄(t),
lim Z(t; ε ) = φ (X̄(t)).
ε →0

ε →0

This theorem is a special case of Theorem 1 of Tikhonov (1952). In fact, the
solution of the full system (1) can be considered as consisting of two parts: the initial
transient, approximately described by (3), with s = ε t, and x ≈ x0 , which is followed
by the long-term part, approximately described by the solution x = X̄(t), z = φ (x).
However the duration of the transient is O (ε ) so for any fixed t > 0 and sufficiently
small ε , the initial transient will have expired by the time t, hence the limit.
A limitation of the above result is that it gives only pointwise convergence in ε so
it does not answer the questions about the behaviour of trajectories as t → 0 at a fixed
ε . There were later extensions of this work, relieving this limitation. In this paper we
will be looking at periodic solutions, so the following result is relevant to us:

6

Simon West et al.

Theorem 2 In addition to the assumptions of Theorem 1, suppose that the slow system (2) has a periodic solution with period P0 , that is x = X̃(t): X̃(t + P0 ) ≡ X̃(t), and
this solution is stable in the linear approximation. Then the full systems (1) have an
(ε -dependent) family of periodic solutions with periods P(ε ) such that limε →0 P(ε ) =
P0 and the corresponding orbits lie in a small vicinity of (X̃(t), φ (X̃ (t))) for small ε .
Moreover, the periodic orbits and the period depend of ε smoothly.
This theorem is a special case of Theorem 5 of (Anosov, 1960).
When the approximation of the solution of the full system by that of the slow system is insufficient in itself, it can be improved by considering higher-order corrections
in ε . The mathematical justification of that procedure is based on the results about
smoothness of the dependence of solutions of the full system on ε , see e.g. Vasil’eva
(1952). A very influential continuation of these works with important generalizations,
under a currently popular name of “geometric perturbation theory”, has been done by
Fenichel (1979). Below we present a simple illustration of the method, directly applicable to our situation.
2.2 Identification of small parameters: parametric embedding
In the real-life kinetic equations it is not always obvious which reagents can be suitable for the QSSA. To identify such reagents, we follow the formal method of “parametric embedding” (Suckley and Biktashev, 2003; Biktasheva et al, 2006).
Definition 1 We will call a system
u̇ = F(u; ε ),

u ∈ Rd ,

depending on parameter ε , a 1-parametric embedding of a system
u̇ = f (u),

u ∈ Rd ,

if f (u) ≡ F(u, 1) for all u ∈ dom ( f ). If the limit ε → 0 is concerned then we call it
a asymptotic embedding. If a 1-parametric embedding has a form (1), we call it a
Tikhonov embedding.
The typical use of this procedure has the form of a replacement of a small constant
with a small parameter. If a system contains a dimensionless constant a which is
“much smaller than 1”, then replacement of a with ε a constitutes a 1-parametric
embedding; and then the limit ε → 0 can be considered. In practice, constant a would
more often be replaced with parameter ε , but mathematically, in the context of ε → 0
and a = const 6= 0 this, of course, does not make any difference from ε a. This explains
the paradoxical use of a zero limit for a parameter whose true value is one.
In some applications, the “small parameters” appear naturally and are readily
identified. However, this is not always the case, and in complex nonlinear systems
asymptotic analysis may require this procedure of parametric embedding, i.e. introduction of small parameters artificially. It is important to understand, that there are
infinitely many ways a given system can be parametrically embedded, as there are
infinitely many ways to draw a curve F(u; ε ) in the functional space given the only

Minimal models of the NF-kappaB system

7

constraint that it passes through a given point, F(u; 1) = f (u). In terms of asymptotics, which of the embeddings is “better” depends on the qualitative features of the
original systems that need to be represented, or classes of solutions that need to be
approximated. Some examples of different Tikhonov embeddings of a simple cardiac
excitation model can be found in Suckley and Biktashev (2003), and non-Tikhonov
embedding of the same in Biktashev and Suckley (2004), and some of those examples
are better than others in describing particularly interesting features of cardiac action
potentials.
If a numerical solution of the system can be found easily, then there is a simple
practical recipe: to look at the solutions of the embedding at different, progressively
decreasing values of the artificial small parameter ε , and see when the features of
interest will start to converge. If the convergent behaviour is satisfactorily similar to
the original system with ε = 1, the embedding is adequate for these features.
To summarize, we claim that identification of small parameters in a given mathematical model with experimentally measured functions and constants will, from the
formal mathematical viewpoint, always be arbitrary (even though in the simplest
cases there may be such a natural choice that this ambiguity is not even realized
by the modeller), and “validity” of such identification can be defined only empirically: if the asymptotics describe the required class of solutions sufficiently well. The
rare exceptions are when the asymptotic series are in fact convergent and the residual
terms can be estimated a priori. A cruder (and less reliable) estimate of the error of
an asymptotic can be obtained through the analysis of the higher-order asymptotics,
see e.g. Turányi et al (1993); more about it later.
In this paper, we restrict consideration to Tikhonov embeddings (1). The simplest
version of the above recipe results in the straightforward procedure: compare the
solution of the full system with the solution where the putative fast variable has been
replaced by its quasistationary value. In terms of the “numerical embedding”, this
means a short-cut: considering values ε = 1 and ε = 0 instead of a (or as a very short)
sequence of values of ε converging to 0. Although sometimes we have indeed studied
several values of ε , we shall always present only ε = 1 and ε = 0 results, to avoid
cluttering the graphs.

2.3 Speed coefficients
It follows from the above discussion that the “numerical embedding” procedure could
be applied to any of the dynamic variables, and those whose adiabatic elimination
would cause the smallest changes in the solution, could be taken as the fastest. In
practice, for a large system, this exhaustive trial and error procedure may be too
laborious. We employ a simple heuristic method to identify the candidates for the
fastest variables.
We describe it in terms of a generic system of N ordinary differential equations
(ODEs),
dxi
= fi (x1 , . . . , xN ) ,
dt

i = 1, . . . N.

Fig. 2 Semi-logarithmic plot of speed coefficients for the Simplified Model (SM). A larger speed coefficient means the variable is approaching its steady state faster. These coefficients identify variable z as the
fastest, and therefore the most appropriate candidate for elimination.

We define the “speed coefficients” for each dynamic variable xi as


 ∂ fi 
.
λi (x1 , ..., xN ) = 
∂ xi 

(5)

By definition, these coefficients depend on the dynamic variables, or, for a selected
solution, they depend on time t. They can be used to rank the variables according to
how quickly they approach their momentary steady-states (figure 2).
It is very essential to understand that with the exception of relatively trivial cases,
the most adequate choice of embedding will depend on the type of solutions that are
of interest for the particular application at hand, because in a nonlinear system, what
is “small” and what is “large” may be significantly different in different parts of the
phase space. A simple but very instructive example illustrating this point is considered by Lam and Goussis (1994, Section A), where the meaning of fast/slow changes
depending on initial conditions and on what part of the solution is considered. Our
practical approach is that we start from one particular solution, which is selected in
such a way that to be sufficiently representative for the class of solutions that are of
interesting to a particular application. An obvious extension would be selection of
a representative set of solutions; however for the illustration of the method, one is
enough. As follows from the above, the task of selecting such solutions is inevitably
the responsibility of the investigator who is going to apply the method and use the
resulting reduced system. In the particular models we consider here this task is relatively straightforward, as the long-term behaviour is more or less the same for any
physiologically sensible initial conditions. For elimination of any further ambiguity
we have adopted a rule that we would select for elimination the variable that is fastest
at its slowest. That is, for each variable we find the minimal value of its speed coefficient over the simulated time interval, and then select the variable which has the
highest value of the minimal speed among other variables.
Note that our heuristic procedure only uses partial information about the system
(only the diagonal elements of the Jacobian, and only its minimal value along only
one/a few solution(s)), but it is only used for preliminary selection of variables for
reduction. Therefore, the actual success of reduction is established by comparison of

Minimal models of the NF-kappaB system

9

the reduced and the original system, within the “numerical embedding” procedure
described above. In the test cases presented in this paper, this proof has always been
successful, if sometimes with first-order corrections. However one cannot exclude
the possibility that high relative values of the non-diagonal elements of the Jacobian
and/or its strong variations over the representative solutions may force the change
of the candidate for reduction, or QSSA may be inapplicable in principle. As an extreme example, consider a subsystem: ẋ = Ay, ẏ = −Ax, which has zero diagonal
Jacobian elements, so would be classed as (infinitely) slow, yet for large A its treatment as such within a larger system would produce wrong results, as in fact x and
y will fastly oscillate. For the (bio-)chemical kinetics this sort of behaviour is, however, not very likely, at least at the level of elemetary reactions; see e.g. the discussion
in (Turányi et al, 1993, p. 165). On the other hand, this fastly oscillating subsystem
is not appropriate for Tikhonov style treatment anyway, and requires averaging in
Krylov-Bogolyubov style instead; whereas if a system does have the form (1) and
satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 1, then the eigenvalues of the Jacobian block
ε −1 ∂ g/∂ z have negative real parts and are of the order of ε −1 , so its diagonal elements are likely to be large (and negative) — although, of course, counter-examples
can be invented.
Finally, we note again that the choice of variables for reduction may depend on
the class of solutions of interest, which in our approach will be done via the choice
of representative solution. In sections 3 and 4 we consider two different classes of
solution in the same full model, which give two different reduced models.

2.4 The model reduction algorithm
Based on Tikhonov’s and Anosov’s theorems and the definition of the speed coefficients we can define a general method for reducing the dimension of a biochemical
reaction system. We illustrate the method using an example where the right-hand
side of an ordinary differential equation for a fast variable is linear with respect to the
same variable. Suppose the variable x j has been identified as the fast variable in the
system (4). With account of the artificial small parameter, this gives

ε

dx j
= α j (t) − β j (t)x j ,
dt

(6)

where coefficients α j (t) and β j (t) are presumed to depend on time via other dynamic
variables. We look for a solution in the form of an asymptotic series x j = x0j + ε x1j +

ε 2 x2j + O ε 3 . Substituting this into (6) gives

ε ẋ0j + ε 2 ẋ1j + ε 3 ẋ2j = α j − β j x0j − εβ j x1j − ε 2 β j x2j + O ε 3 .

(7)

The simplest approximation for x j is obtained by considering the terms in (7) proportional to ε 0 ,
0 = α j (t) − β j (t)x0j ,

(8)

10

Simon West et al.

which results in the zeroth-order QSSA for variable x j :
x0j = x0j =

α j (t)
.
β j (t)

(9)

This approximation x0j is then substituted into the original system of equations for the
variable x j . If the variable is sufficiently fast then this steady-state expression should
be a good approximation of the fast variable and the substitution will cause minimal
change to the solution.
In general, the zeroth-order QSSA provides a reasonable approximation of the
original variable. However, if such approximation is not good enough, it can be improved by calculating an additional correction term. To do this we consider terms in
(7) proportional to ε 1 :
(10)
ε ẋ0j = −εβ j x1j .

Substituting our earlier result (9) into equation (10) and solving for x1j gives the firstorder correction in the form
α j β˙j − β j α˙ j
1
x1j = − ẋ0j =
.
(11)
βj
β j3
This results in the first-order QSSA x1j = x0j + ε x1j in the form
x1j =

α j (t) α j (t)β˙j (t) − β j (t)α˙ j (t)
,
+
β j (t)
β j3 (t)

(12)

since the original problem corresponds to ε = 1. Note that the value of the first-order
correction, or its estimate, can be used as an estimate of the accuracy of the leadingterm approximation; roughly speaking, this is the idea behind the accuracy estimate
used in Turányi et al (1993).
So our method can then be formulated into a general algorithm to reduce the
dimension of a biochemical system defined by ordinary differential equations. The
algorithm reads:
1. Using numerical methods, find a representative solution of the system of ODEs
for the chosen time interval.
2. Calculate the expressions for the speed coefficients (λ ’s), using equation (5) from
the system of ODEs (this can be assisted by a symbolic calculations software, e.g.
Maple).
3. Substitute the numerical solution of the system into the expressions for the λ ’s to
find the speed for each variable at each time point.
4. Plot the speed coefficients vs. time and identify the fastest variable (at its slowest).
5. Calculate the expression for the zeroth-order QSSA using (9).
6. Substitute this QSSA into the system of ODEs to eliminate the fastest variable,
thus obtaining a reduced system.
7. Compare the solution of the reduced system with the solution of the original
system.
8. If the zeroth-order QSSA is insufficient to maintain a suitable accuracy, calculate
the first-order QSSA using equation (12).
9. Repeat the above process for the new reduced system.

3 Minimal model of the NF-κ B system in response to continuous TNFα input
The “two-feedback” model of the NF-κ B system presented in Ashall et al (2009) is
our starting point. It is a system of 14 ordinary differential equations representing
NF-κ B and the Iκ Bα and A20 negative feedbacks (figure 1). We use brief notations
for its variables and parameters as given in Table 1. We pursued derivation of a minimal model with respect to a representative solution obtained for initial conditions
as described in Table 1 and k24 = 1. In a biological context this corresponds to a
continuous stimulation of the system with a high dose of TNFα (Ashall et al, 2009).
Before employing the reduction algorithm we endeavoured to simplify the system
by elementary means (similarly to Wang et al (2012)). Conservation of cellular IKK
reads v + w + a = k2 = const, which allows us to eliminate a via the substitution
a = k2 − v − w. Similarly, conservation of NF-κ B in all its five forms reads p + d +
z + k11 (r + c) = k3 = const, which we use to eliminate d. Further, we observed that
variable b is “decoupled”: it is only present in its own equation, and the dynamics
of other variables do not depend on it. So it can be removed from the analysis, as
the solution for it, if necessary, can be obtained post factum by integration of the
solution of the remaining system. Finally, for this representative solution we have
observed that some of the terms in the equation consistently remain so small that
their elimination does not visibly change the solution. This involved elimination of
variable c, leaving a system of 10 equations, which we shall refer to as the Simplified
Model (SM):

The solution of (13) is very close to that of the original model (see Table 2 and Appendix A), and marks the starting point of the reduction procedure. We apply the
reduction algorithm iteratively, eliminating a sequence of fast variables and employing different orders of approximation for them. To keep track of these, we introduce
a nomenclature for the reduced models. The model variants are named according to
the variables that have been removed, each with a subscript showing if a zeroth- or
first-order QSSA has been used, 0 or 1 respectively. For example, the first variable
eliminated is z, therefore the model with this variable replaced with a zeroth-order
QSSA is titled z0 and the same with a first-order QSSA is titled z1 . A model where
the variables z and p have been replaced in turn with their zeroth- and first-order
QSSAs respectively, will be denoted as z0 p1 , etc. Below, we concentrate on the key
points of the reduction sequence.
Figure 2 shows the speed coefficients calculated for the Simplified Model. It identifies z to be the fastest and thus eliminated first. Application of the method, using
zeroth-order approximation, results in a 9-variable model z0 with comparable solution to this of the Simplified Model (figure 3).
Addition of a first-order correction to some of the QSSAs improved the model fit
in comparison to respective predecessors. Figure 4 shows that a first-order correction
in the variable p markedly improved the accuracy of the 8-variable reduced model.
However, addition of these corrections can also increase the algebraic complexity of
the system and it must be considered whether the improvement of the model outweighs the added complexity.
As the reduction progressed, there was an increasing overlap in the ranges of
the speed coefficients, and we had to apply the “the fastest at its slowest” heuristic
rule. For example in figure 5, this rule identifies the variable w for elimination during
reduction to the 4-variable model, even though two other variables, r and q, are at
times faster.
Successive cycles of the algorithm were applied to ultimately reduce this system
to four differential equations. The method maintained the important qualitative features of the system, such as the limit cycle. However, through each stage of the reduction, the resulting limit cycle had a slightly reduced period and amplitude (Table 2).

Using only the zeroth-order QSSAs was sufficient to reduce the model to five ODEs
(z0 p0 y0 v0 s0 ), while maintaining the limit cycle. In order to reduce the system further,
the use of a first-order QSSA was necessary (figure 6). A suitable zeroth- or firstorder QSSA could not be calculated to reduce the model beyond this, and therefore
the model z0 p0 y0 v0 s0 w1 of four differential equations was chosen as the end point of
this analysis. This minimal model is given by (14), where A = k24 k22 k20 k21 k12 k3 and

It was possible to add first-order corrections to all of the dynamic variables during
the model reduction, producing a minimal model z1 p1 y1 v1 s1 w1 with a far improved
fit in comparison to the original. However, the z0 approximation was so accurate
that z1 did not make a noticeable improvement. Figure 7 shows comparison of the
“simplest” and “the most accurate” 4-variable models to the original 10-variable one
(the z0 p1 y1 v1 s1 w1 model is presented in appendix A).
Figure 8 shows how some of the dynamic properties of the model change through
the reduction process. It represents the steady state solution and continuation for the
variable r as the parameter k24 is varied (Doedel et al, 2000; Ermentrout, 2002),
showing the effect of altering the TNFα dose (Turner et al, 2010). In the original
model, there is a supercritical Hopf bifurcation (HB) at k24 = 0.36 above which the
limit cycle is observed. Successive elimination of the fastest variables causes the HB
point to move up, closer to the value k24 = 1, which corresponds to a saturating dose

of TNFα . Reduction from five to four differential equations using zeroth-order QSSA
for w would move the HB point further to the right (Hopf bifurcation at k24 = 3.105).
Figure 8 also demonstrates that use of the first-order correction terms dramatically
reduces the loss in limit cycle amplitude and change in the location of the HB point.

4 Model reduction with respect to pulsed TNFα input
Previously, we derived models with respect a solution that corresponded to a constant
value of the TNFα input, k24 ≡ 1. The universality of such models depends on how
representative that solution actually is. In this subsection we give an example where
a different selection of the representative solution leads to a different reduced model.
We now consider another experimentally relevant case, where the TNFα input is
varied: k24 = 0 except for 5-minute pulses of k24 = 1 delivered every 100 minutes.
Under such stimulation, the system exhibits pulses of the nuclear NF-κ B entrained to
the input frequency (Ashall et al, 2009). Despite the same 100 minute period, these
pulses are markedly different than oscillations induced with the continuous TNFα
input. The Simplified Model reproduces this property, see figure 2 vs figure 9 . However, the 6-variable variant, z0 p0 y0 v0 (see appendix B for equations), does not respond
with a full-size nuclear NF-κ B translocation to each pulse, and the solution is of a
double period, figure 9.
We therefore developed an alternative minimal model, choosing the periodically
entrained solution as the representative one. For the periodically entrained solution,
the hierarchy of speeds of the variables associated with the IKK module is different
from the k24 ≡ 1 case. Specifically, the first three fastest variables are z, p and y as
before. However, when choosing the 4th variable for elimination, the neutral form
of IKK, v, becomes one of the slowest, and the algorithm identified the active IKK,
w, for approximation (figure 10). In the continuous case, v and w were the first and
second fastest variables, respectively (figure 10). Ultimately, application of the algorithm with respect to the pulsed input resulted in a different model, which showed a
much better agreement with the SM and did not display a period doubling (figure 9).

The difference in the v speed for alternative TNFα stimulation can be easily understood by analysing the dynamic equation for v. The last term in its right-hand side,
−k24 k22 v, directly contributes towards decay of v, but only when k24 is switched on.
So when k24 is off, the v variable is much slower and its adiabatic elimination is not
justified.

5 Application of speed coefficients method to Krishna model
Here, we compare the behaviour and properties of two reduced models of Krishna’s
full 6-variable model for NF-κ B signalling dynamics (Krishna et al, 2006), one obtained by combination of coarse graining and numerical observations, and the other
obtained using our new method of speed coefficients. In this analysis, we demonstrate
better agreement with the full model achieved using our algorithmic approach.
Firstly, in figure 11, we show time courses for oscillatory solutions for variables representing nuclear NF-κ B, Iκ Bα protein and Iκ Bα mRNA in three models,
namely Krishna’s full model (K6), Krishna’s 3-variable minimal model (K3), and a
new 4-variable reduced model given by our speed coefficient algorithm (K4) (see
Appendix D for the systems of equations). We note that, while neither of the reduced
models matches the full model in period, the oscillation amplitudes of the three variables show reasonable agreement, with our new reduced model (K4) more closely

agreeing with the full model. Also, the K4 Iκ Bα protein profile shape shows better
agreement with K6 than K3 does, with I flattening out in its troughs. Summary phase
portraits clearly show that K4’s limit cycles more closely agree with K6 than K3 does.
In figure 12 we compare bifurcation diagrams (with respect to the rate of Iκ Bα
transcription) for reduced models with their corresponding full models, for both our
Simplified Model and the Krishna model. For the Krishna model, we further compare the Krishna minimal model (K3)and our new reduced model (K4). The reduced
model resulting from the speed coefficient method applied to the Simplified Model
(SM) gives a bifurcation diagram in qualitative agreement with that for the corresponding full model over the range of k5 shown (figure 12(a)). Also, the reduced
model resulting from our method applied to the Krishna model (see Appendix D)
gives qualitative agreement with the full Krishna model (figure 12(b)). This is a
marked improvement over the Krishna minimal model, which demonstrates features
that are not present in the corresponding full model. These include variation of the
limit cycle amplitude for values of the Iκ Bα transcription around 1, and a subcritical Hopf bifurcation at around kt = 50, with unstable limit cycles and hysteresis for
the values between 50 and 240. On the contrary, our minimal model preserves the
properties of the full model at least at the qualitative level, even for the values of the
parameter very different from the one corresponding to the representative solution.
We conclude that application of our method of speed coefficients can produce
a reduced model of comparable dimensionality while better preserving the dynamic
properties of the original system than other existing techniques.

6 Discussion
A key problem in computational and systems biology is to understand how dynamical properties of a system arise via the underlying biochemical networks. However, as

20

Simon West et al.

these networks involve many components this task becomes analytically intractable
and computationally challenging. In this manuscript we present a clearly defined and
accessible QSSA algorithm for reduction of such biochemical reaction systems. The
method proposed relies on the derivation of speed coefficients to rank system variables according to how quickly they approach their momentary-steady state. This
enables a systematic method for selection of variables for steady-state approximation
at each step of the algorithm.
We used the method to derive a minimal models of the NF-κ B signalling network, a key regulator of the immune response (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008). Single
cell time-lapse analyses showed that the NF-κ B system exhibits oscillatory dynamics in response to cytokine stimulation (Nelson et al, 2004; Turner et al, 2010; Tay
et al, 2010). It has been shown that the frequency of those oscillations may govern
downstream gene expression and therefore be the key functional output of the system
(Ashall et al, 2009; Sung et al, 2009; Tay et al, 2010). The ability to control the NFκ B dynamics may therefore provide novel ways to treat inflammatory disease (Paszek
et al, 2010).
NF-κ B dynamics are generated via a complex network involving several negative feedback genes, such as A20 and Iκ Bα (Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006). Many
mathematical models have been developed to recapitulate existing experimental data
by quite complex biochemical networks involving up to 30 dynamic variables and
100 parameters with varying degrees of accuracy (Hoffmann et al, 2002; Lipniacki
et al, 2004; Radulescu et al, 2008). Sensitivity analyses have then demonstrated that
several parameters related to feedback regulation and IKK activation are responsible
for generation of the oscillatory dynamics (Ihekwaba et al, 2004, 2005; Sung et al,
2009). An interesting extension of the sensitivity analysis method was proposed by
Jacobsen and Cedersund (2008) who considered sensitivity with respect not just parameter perturbations but to variations of the network structure, e.g. introduction of
delays in the network connections. Model reduction discussed in our paper provides
an alternative avenue to extract core network components. Indeed, minimal models
by Krishna et al. and Radulescu et al. demonstrated that part of this complex system
in response to continuous cytokine stimulation may be reduced to three dynamical
variables describing the nuclear NF-κ B and Iκ Bα mRNA and protein (Krishna et al,
2006). Here, we apply our method of speed coefficients to systematically reduce a
2-feedback model of the NF-κ B system by Ashall et al (Ashall et al, 2009).
Starting from a 14-variable model, we succeeded in closely representing dynamics of the NF-κ B network in response to constant TNFα input by a set of four variables (14). The minimal model included the nuclear NF-κ B and its cytoplasmic inhibitor Iκ Bα , as well as two negative feedback loops represented by Iκ Bα and A20
transcripts. The latter variables were consistently ranked the slowest during successive reduction steps (figure 2 and figure 5), and in fact their subsequent QSSA resulted
in the loss of oscillations. This suggested that the timescale of transcription relative to
other processes generates the key delayed negative feedback motif that drives oscillations in the system (Novak and Tyson, 2008). While reducing the model, we observed
that the period as well as the amplitude of oscillations was decreased with each reduction (Table 2). Replacing those variables with the respective QSSAs decreased the
effective delay time in the system, and thus reduced the system’s propensity for oscil-

21

lations. This effect was reverted by using first-order QSSA for some of the eliminated
variables, namely cytoplasmic NF-κ B, nuclear Iκ Bα and the active form of IKK kinase. A more accurate representation of those variables is thus important to faithfully
represent NF-κ B dynamics (figure 6 - figure 8). Our analysis is in agreement with
results of Radulescu et al. who, using quasi-stationarity arguments, obtained a series
of reduced models and eventually arrived at the 5 variable minimal model. While
starting from a different two-feedback IkBa and A20 model (Lipniacki et al, 2004)
than the one considered here, Radulescu et al. showed similar requirements for both
feedbacks to maintain oscillatory dynamics.
A model derived with respect to a specific solution is not necessarily able to
reproduce the same breadth of responses as its forebear. However, by applying the algorithm with respect to a different solution one might try to potentially extract other
key features of the system. Here, we demonstrated that the reduction of the model
with respect to a pulsed and continuous TNFα input resulted in a different order of
elimination of the variables and ultimately a different minimal models (figure 9). The
differences unravelled specific components of the IKK module responsible for NFκ B dynamics in response to different stimulus. With a pulsed input the amplitude of
the subsequent peaks is determined by the “refractory period”, i.e. the time it takes
for the active IKK to return to its neutral state. This requires a very accurate temporal representation of the neutral form of IKK, v, in the model. However, in response
to continuous TNFα input, both IKK-related variables became less important, and
their steady-state approximation is sufficient to support the limit cycle. This analysis therefore begins to unravel how components of the KK signalling module could
differentially encode temporal inflammatory signals.
In order to demonstrate a more general applicability of our method, we have employed the speed coefficient algorithm to derive a new reduced model of the Krishna model (Krishna et al, 2006). The comparison with minimal Krishna et al model
showed that both models perform similarly in terms of time courses and phase portraits (fig. 11). However, analysis of bifurcation diagrams showed that our algorithmic approach better preserved dynamical properties of the system (fig.12). In fact,
the Krishna minimal model demonstrates features such as unstable limit cycle and
hysteresis that are not present in the corresponding full model. Recently, Kourdis
et al. used CSP algorithm to asymptotically analyse the dynamics of the Krishna et
al. model. In agreement with our approach, their analysis identified similar fast/slow
time scale variables that are essential to recapitulate limit cycle behaviour of the system. This analysis, in addition to our discussion of the Simplified Model, certainly
suggests that our method has further potential as a viable technique for the reduction
of biochemical network dynamic models.
Our objective here was to present and implement a new model reduction technique that without relying on prior biological insights, would preserve characteristics
of the original model’s numerical solutions. This method thus belongs to a class of
reduction methods that are algorithmic rather than biologically or biochemically intuitive, and as such should be applicable to complex biochemical models where the
most important network sub-structures underlying the observed dynamical behaviour
are not necessarily apparent. Similarly to other approximation methods, there is a
trade-off between simplicity and accuracy of the end-point models. Even if errors in-

22

troduced by one reduction step are small, for many steps they can accumulate. The
approximations can be improved by using higher-order asymptotics, which increases
algebraic complexity of the resulting reduced model but retains the dimensionality.
We believe that in practically interesting cases, the increased algebraic complexity
can be overcome by appropriate approximation of the functions in the resulting models. Another way to improve the accuracy of reduced models is to adjust parameters
to match the solutions of the full model; a semi-empirical model resulting from such
adjustment would still have an advantage over a fully empirical model in that at least
its structure is not arbitrarily postulated. In addition to a lower dimensionality, the
reduced problems are less stiff, as by definition, the variables with fastest characteristic timescales are eliminated first. The reduced dimensionality and stiffness allow, in
principle, more efficient computations which may be important, e.g., for large scale
models including interaction of many cells. Last but not least, systems of lower dimensionality are more amenable for qualitative study and intuitive understanding.
