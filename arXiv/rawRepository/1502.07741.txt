Extending the previous 2-gender dioecious biploid gene-mating evolution model, we attempt to
answer “whether the Hardy-Weinberg global stability and the exact analytic dynamical solutions can
be found in the generalized N-gender polyploid gene-mating system?” For a 2-gender gene-mating
evolution model, a pair of male and female determines the trait of their offspring. Each of the pair
contributes one inherited character, the allele, to combine into the genotype of their offspring. Hence,
for an N-gender polypoid gene-mating model, each of N different genders contributes one allele to
combine into the genotype of their offspring. We find the global stable solution as a manifold in
the genotype frequency parameter space. We exactly sovle the analytic solution of N-gender mating
governing equations and find no chaos. The 2-gender to N-gender gene-mating equation is analogues
to the 2-body collision to the N-body collision Boltzmann equations with discretized distribution.

INTRODUCTION

In a previous work[1], we had surveyed the time-evolution of genotype frequency in a 2-gender dioecious biploid
population system. We derive our governing equations based on our four fundamental assumptions,
(a)The mating of gene-holders is (approximately) closed in a population system.
(b)The mating probability for certain gene-type to another gene-type, due to average-and-random mating mechanism,
is proportional to the product of their population (quadratic form for 2-gender, cubic form for 3-gender, etc.).
(c)The probability of a gene-type for newborn generation obeys the Mendelian inheritance.
(d)The accumulation of human population obeys the exponential growth law, for both the birth and the death
evolution.
We had derived the governing equations in the parameter space of the genotype frequencies, and had solved the
analytical solution of the governing equations within a single locus and arbitrary number alleles mating process.
However, our previous work only focus on 2-gender mating, normally one male and one female. We can analytically
prove the global stability and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium[2, 3]. For biological and mathematical interests, we
ponder whether the N-gender case, where N is an arbitrary integer number, will bring interesting results. In other
words, we like to consider a mating system of N different genders. The mating process of the system will be successful
if and only if there is a group of N different genders participate in the mating process. For a certain genotype (or a
biological trait), each of these different N genders contributes an allele, together combine into the inherited genotype
of their offspring.
The questions we ask and aim to address are: Whether 2-gender mating is special for N=2, so that it assures the
global stability for the system under time evolution? Whether 2-gender mating is special so that there exists exact
analytic solutions? Whether there is chaos for N-gender mating system at some integer N? Is it possible to solve the
analytic solution for arbitrary N? Is there a specific integer number M, such that for gender number smaller than
M, the system has the global stability; if the gender number is larger than M, then the chaos appears (from global
stability to chaos)? If so, what is the integer M?
Since 1-gender mating is just trivial asexual reproduction, and 2-gender mating is a case with global stable solution,
one might expect that 2-gender mating is a transition. In other words, for N> 2, there might have chaos or more
complicated time-evolution phase diagrams. However, as we will show later, for the general N-gender gene-mating
system, there is always a global stable manifold as long as the system satisfies the previous four assumptions. Throughout the paper, we focus on the standard equations without considering the mutation and natural selection. From
the mathematic viewpoint, the highly symmetric governing equations result in a continuous global stable manifold.
This high-dimensional curved manifold is a global stable attractor, under time evolution attracting all points in the

Euclidean fiber attached at every manifold point. The stable manifold and the fibers together form a fiber bundle
completely fill in the whole genotype-frequncy parameter space. We solve the analytical solutions exactly for the
general N-gender (n+1)-alleles gene-mating system.
One remark is that the coefficients of the governing equations for N-gender mating can be derived explicitly from
the well-known multinomial theorem:


X
N
N
.Gk11 · · · Gknn
(1)
(G1 + · · · + Gn ) =
k1 , . . . , kn
k1 +···+kn =N
k1 ,...,kn ∈N

Therefore, in the discussion below we will not explicitly write down the coefficients, except for the simple case of
N = 1, 2. Another remark is that our governing equation shall also be viewed as generalizing the biploid system to
the N-polypoid system. For the N-gender-mating N-polypoid system, we believe that if the previous four assumptions
are obeyed, the global stability of genotype frequencies is robust.
II.

1-GENDER GENE-MATING MODEL (ASEXUAL)

Here we start from the asexual mating system. There exists only one gender in a system, such that each gender
could self-produce its offspring exactly the same as itself. Then we denote the population number of certain genotype
as Gα , where α is arbitrary interger number. Thus, parallel to the work [1], based on the assumptions done in Sec.I,
we can derive the governing equations for population
d
Gα = kb Gα −k d Gα ,
dt

(2)

where kb is birth rate and kd is death rate. Apparently we can normalize the Gα by the total population P , and
we will relabel GPα → Gα as the genotype frequency. Hereafter we will re-parameterize the equation in terms of the
genotype frequency Gα , and we obtain the governing equations for genotype frequencies
d
Gα = 0.
dt

(3)

Hence, any point in the genotype frequency parameter space is stable for 1-gender asexual system. The genotype
frequency is within the range of [0, 1].

Recall that the death rate kd has no net effect on the genotype frequencies, because it is a universal linear effect on
each genotype population which does not change genotype frequency. Note that Gαα means the genotype frequency
contributed from the same alleles α from both parents. Gαβ means the genotype frequency contributed from the
alleles α and β from each of the parents respectively. Hereafter we will identify Gαβ and its Gβα as the same genotype
frequency, therefore the governing equations have taken account of the combined effects of Gαβ and its Gβα . We had
found an exact analytic parameterization of the global stable manifold:

In the following sections, we will generalize the 2-gender gene-mating model to N-gender gene-mating model.
IV.

3-GENDER GENE-MATING MODEL

Hereafter we do not bother to write down the coefficients of the governing equations, which could be easily determined by the multinomial theroem Eq.(1), the basic mating rules and the Mendelian inheritance. The governing
equations of genotype frequencies for 3-gender mating have the form:

4

d
dt Gαβγ = k b (Mi1 i2 i3 ;i4 i5 i6 ;i7 i8 i9 Gi1 i2 i3 Gi4 i5 i6 Gi7 i8 i9 −Gαβγ ).

(12)

where i1 ≤ i2 ≤ i3 ; i4 ≤ i5 ≤ i6 ; i7 ≤ i8 ≤ i9 . We should remember that there will be a permutation factor for
Gi1 i2 i3 Gi4 i5 i6 Gi7 i8 i9 , if genotypes of three genders are not the same. Again, we note that Gαβγ means the genotype
frequency contributed from the alleles α, β and γ from each of the three genders respectively. Hereafter we will
identify Gαβγ and its index permutation Gβαγ , Gβγα , etc., as the same genotype frequency. In our notation, we will
define the genotype frequency Gβαγ such that α ≤ β ≤ γ.
Interestingly, regardless the non-linear governing equations are generalized to the more-complicated 3-gender cubic
form (instead of the 2-gender quadratic form in Sec.III), we can still solve the governing equations and its global
stability. We find an analytic parametrization of a continuous global stable manifold as follows:

where we define α0 ≡ −1. All θµ are within the range [0, π/2].
We extend the stable manifold through the following parametrized Euclidean fiber at each fixed point on the stable
manifold. This procedure lead to our new parametrization of coordinates. For N -gender mating of (n+1) alleles,
we seperate the parametrization of fiber space to two cases, for N is an even integer and for N is an odd integer.

CONCLUSIONS

We have found the exact analytic solutions and proved the global stability of an N-gender gene-mating N-polypoid
system. Since there is no chaotic behavior, it seems to suggest that the natural law does not go against N-gender
N-polypoid system as far as the global stability concerns. Presumably the extraterrestrial aliens or intelligence may
have N-gender N-polypoid system with N≥ 3 while the mating system still enjoys the global stability. It is likely that
when the mutation and the natural selection process sets in, it will alter the governing equations to be less-symmetric,
and thus possibly result in richer or more chaotic behaviors. It will be interesting to study the perturbation away
from the symmetric governing equations, with the help of our exact analytic solutions.
We can also compare the 2-gender to N-gender gene-mating equation to the Boltmann-like equation. The 2-gender
to N-gender gene-mating equations are basically the 2-body collision to the N-body collision Boltzmann equations
with discretized variable distribution instead of continuous one. It may be interesting to find a set of exact solvable
time-dependent Boltmann equation by generalizing our discretized variables to continuous functional variables. Such
a derived Boltmann-like equation should still provide the global stability and a continuous fixed-point global stable
manifold in the infinite-dimensional continuous parameter space. All these will be left open for future directions.
