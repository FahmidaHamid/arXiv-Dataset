Abstract. A new approach is developed to understand stability of a population and further
understanding of population momentum. These ideas can be generalized to populations in ecology
and biology.

1. Introduction
One commonly prescribed approach for understanding the stability of system of dependent
variables is that of Lyapunov. In a possible alternative approach - when variables in the system
have momentum then that can trigger additional dynamics within the system causing the system
to become unstable. In this study stability of population is defined in terms of elements in the
set of births and elements in the set of deaths. Even though the cardinality of the former set
has become equal to the cardinality of the latter set, the momentum with which this equality has
occurred determines the status of the population to remain at stable. Such arguments also works
for the other population ecology problems.
2. Population Stability Theory
Suppose |PN (t0 )| be the cardinality of the set of people, PN (t0 ), representing population at global
level at time t0 , where PN (t0 ) = {u1 , u2, · · · , uN }, the elements u1 , u2 , · · · , uN represent individuals in the population. Broadly speaking, the Lyapunov stability principles (see [VLL]) suggests,
|PN (t0 )| is asymptotically stable at population size U, if ||PN (T )| − U| < ǫ (ǫ > 0) at all T whenever T > t0 . In some sense, |PN (t0 )| attains the value U over the period of time. Lotka-Voltera’s
predator and prey population models provide one of the classical and earliest stability analyses
of population biology (see for example, [JDM]) and Lyapunov stability principles often assist in
the analysis of such models. These models have equations that describe the dynamics of at least
two interacting populations with parameters describing interactions and natural growth. Outside
human population models and ecology models, stability also plays a very important role in understanding epidemic spread [AR]. In this paper, we are interested in factors that cause dynamics in
PN and relate these factors with status of stability. A set of people PM (t0 ) = {um1 , um2 , · · · , umM },
where PM (t0 ) ⊂ PN (t0 ), are responsible for increasing the population (reproduction) during the
period (t0 , s) and contribute
to PN (s), the	 set of people at s (if they survive until the time s). The

set QM1 (s − t0 ) = vM11 , vM12 , · · · , vM1M1 represent removals (due to deaths) from PN (t0 ) during
the time interval (t0 , s). Let Rφ (s − t0 ) be the period reproductive rate (net) applied on PM (t0 ) for
the period (t0 , s), then the number of new population added during (t0 , s) is Rφ (s − t0 ) |PM (t0 )| .
Net reproduction rate at time t0 (or in a year t0 ) is the average number of female children that

would be born to single women if she passes through age-specific fertility rates and age-specific
mortality rates that are observed at t0 (for the year t0 ). Since net reproductive rates are futuristic
measures, we use period (annual) reproductive rates for computing period (annual) increase in
population. Let CN1 (s − t0 ) = {w1 , w2 , · · · , wN1 } be the set of newly added population during
(t0 , s) to the set PN (t0 ). After allowing the dynamics during (t0 , s), the population at s will be

PN (t0 ) ∪ CN1 (s − t0 ) − QM1 (s − t0 ) =
(2.1)

(

u : u ∈ PN (t0 ) ∪ CN1 (s − t0 )
and u ∈
/ QM1 (s − t0 )

)

= {u1 , u2 , · · · , uN +N1 −M1 }

	
Note that, QM1 (s−t0 ) ⊂ PN (t0 )∪CN1 (s−t0 ), because the set of elements {vM1 , vM12 , · · · , vM1M1
eliminated during the time period (t0 , s) are part of the set of elements
{u1 , u2, · · · , uN , w1 , w2 , · · · , wN1 } and the resulting elements surviving by the time s are represented in equation (2.1). The element u1 in the set (2.1) may not be the same individual in the set
PN (t0 ). Since we wanted to retain the notation that represents people living at each time point,
so for ordering purpose, we have used the symbol u1 in the set (2.1).
Using Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem [PS], |CN1 (s − t0 )| = |QM1 (s − t0 )| if |CN1 (s − t0 )|
≤ |QM1 (s − t0 )| and |CN1 (s − t0 )| ≥ |QM1 (s − t0 )| . If |CN1 (s − t0 )| = |QM1 (s − t0 )| then the
natural growth of the population (in a closed situation) is zero and if this situation continues
further over the time then the population could be termed as stationary. Assuming these two
quantities are not same at t0 , the process of two quantities |CN1 | and |QM1 | becoming equal could
eventually happen due to several sub-processes.
Case I: |CN1 | > |QM1 | at time t0 . We are interested in studying the conditions for the process
|CN1 | → |QM1 | for some s > t0 . Two factors play a major role in determining the speed of this
process, they are, compositions of the family of sets [{PM (s)} : ∀s > t0 ] and [{Rφ (s)} : ∀s > t0 ].
Suppose |PM (s1 )| > |PM (s2 )| > · · · > |PM (sT )| but the family of {|Rφ (s)|} does not follow
any decreasing pattern for some t0 < s1 < s2 < ... < sT < s, then |CN1 | 9 |QM1 | by the
time sT . If Rφ (s1 ) > Rφ (s2 ) > ... > Rφ (sT ) for t0 < s1 < s2 < ... < sT < s such that
|Rφ (sT − sT −1 ) |PM (sT −1 )| − QM1 (sT − sT −1 )| → 0 for some sufficiently large T > t0 and sufficiently small |Rφ (sT − sT −1 )|, then |CN1 | → |QM1 | by the time sT . Note that in an ideal demographic transition situation, both these quantities should decline over the period and the rate of
decline of |QM1 | is slower than the rate of decline in |CN1 | because |CN1 | > |QM1 | at time t0 . Demographic transition theory, in simple terms, is all about, determinants, consequences and speed
of declining of high rates of fertility and mortality to low levels of fertility and mortality rates. For
introduction of this concept see [KD] and for an update of recent works, see [JC]. Above trend
of |PM (s1 )| > |PM (s2 )| > · · · > |PM (sT )| (i.e. decline in people of reproductive ages over the
time after t0 ) happens when births continuously decrease for several years. Following the trend
Rφ (s1 ) > Rφ (s2 ) > ... > Rφ (sT ) will lead to decline in new born babies and this will indirectly
result in decline in rate of growth of people who have reproductive potential. However the decline
in |Rφ (s)| for s > t0 is well explained by social and biological factors, which need not follow any
pre-determined mathematical model. However the trend in |Rφ (t)| for t < t0 can be explained
using models by fitting parameters obtained from data. During the entire process the value of
|QM1 | after time t0 is assumed to be dynamic and decreases further. If a population continues to
remain at this stage of replacement we call it a stable population. The cycle of births, population
aging and deaths is a continuous process with discretely quantifiable factors. Due to improvement
in medical sciences there could be some delay in deaths, but eventually the aged population has
to be moved out of {PN }, and consequently, population stability status can be broken with a
continuous decline in {|CN1 |}.
Case II: |CN1 | = |QM1 | at time t0 . It is important to ascertain whether this situation was
immediately proceeded by case I or case II before determining the stability process. Suppose case

Figure 2.1. (a) The cycle of all the cases could follow one after another and the
quantity at which equality of CN1 and QM1 occurs determines the duration of the
case II. (b) Some of the sub-populations which are not satisfied the equality of CN1
and QM1 is compensated by the other sub-populations which are satisfying either
CN1 > QM1 or CN1 < QM1 .
II is immediately preceded by case I, then the rapidity and magnitude at which the difference
between |CN1 | and |QM1 | was shrunk prior to t0 need to be quantified. Let us understand the
contributing factors for the set QM . At each t, there is a possibility that the elements from the
sets CN1 , PN − CN1 − PM , PM are contributing to the set QM . Due to high infant mortality rates,
the contribution of CN1 into QM is considered to be high, deaths of adults of reproductive ages,
PM , and all other individuals (including the aged), PN − CN1 − PM , will be contributing to the set
QM . Case II could occur when |CN1 | and |QM1 | are at higher values or at lower values. Equality at
higher values possibly indicates, the number of deaths due to three factors mentioned here are high
(including high old age deaths) and these are replaced by equal high number of births, i.e. |Rφ |
and |PM | are usually high to reproduce a high birth numbers. If equality at lower values of |CN1 |
and |QM1 | occurs after phase of case I then the chance of PN remaining in stable position is higher.
Suppose elements of PN are arbitrarily divided into k−independent and non-empty subsets, A(1),
´k
A(2), · · · ,A(k) such that |PN |= 1 |A(s)| ds. Let F be
 the family of all the sets A(s) such that

∪ (A(s)) = PN . Members of F are disjoint. Suppose

Proof. Note that F has collection of k−sets. Suppose a collection C divides CN1 into k−components

{QM1 (1), QM1 (2), · · · , QM1 (k)} such that

|QM1 | = 1 |CM1 (s)| ds, where QM1 (s) is the sth −subset in Q.
By hypothesis, |CN1 (s∗ )| = |QM1 (s∗ )| for s∗ ∈ {1∗ , 2∗ , · · · , k ∗ } at each time t ≥ t0 until, say, tT .

Case III. |CN1 | < |QM1 | at time t0 . Global occurrence of this case at lower values of |CN1 | and
|QM1 | indicates that the PN is declining and also is in unstable mode. Rφ has been very low
consistently for the period t < t0 and the supply to the set PM has diminished over a period in the
past. All the subsets of CN1 and QM1 might not be stable in case III, but by similar arguments
of the Theorem 1, global population behavior nullifies some of the local population and case III is
still satisfied globally.
All three cases would be repeated one following another. Most countries are currently facing
case I with varying distance between |CN1 | and |QM1 | .
3. Replacement Metric
We introduce a metric, dM , which we call a replacement metric, with a space, Mr as follows:
Definition 2. (Replacement Metric).
Let A1 = min {||CN1 (s)| − |QM1 (s)|| : s > t0 } and
A2 = max {||CN1 (s)| − |QM1 (s)|| : s > t0 }. Let Mr = [A1 , A2 ] ⊂ R+ and M = {||CN1 (s)| − |QM1 (s)||
: s > t0 } with the metric dM (x, y) = |x−y|
. We can verify that (M, dM ) is a metric space with
2
dM : (M × M) → Mr and non-empty set M.
The metric M, in the definition 1 is bounded, because dM (x, y) < k for k > 0.
Definition 3. Suppose ||CN1 (s1 )| − |QM1 (s1 )|| = f1 , ||CN1 (s2 )| −|QM2 (s2 )|| = f2 and so on
for s1 < s2 < ... . Then we say population is stable if fsT → 0 for sufficiently large T and
d
|CN1 (sT )| = dsdT |CN1 (sT )| = 0.
dsT
4. Conclusions
We can prove that the value at which the population remains stable is variable, i.e. the value at
which the population becomes unstable by deviating from case II could be different from the value
(at a future point in time) population becomes stable when it converges to case II. Replacement
metrics (see definition 2) are helpful in seeing this argument and such analysis is not possible by
Lotka-Voltera or Lyupunov methods. Due to population momentum, there will be an increase in
the population even though the reproduction rate of the population becomes below the replacement
level. Population stability will always attain a local stable points before diverging and again
converging at a local stable point. The duration of a local stable point depends on the density of
the population and resources available for the population.
