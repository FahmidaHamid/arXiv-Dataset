RNA polymerase (RNAP) is molecular machine that polymerizes a RNA molecule, a linear heteropolymer, using a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as the corresponding template; the sequence of
monomers of the RNA is dictated by that of monomers on the ssDNA template. While polymerizing
a RNA, the RNAP walks step-by-step on the ssDNA template in a specific direction. Thus, a RNAP
can be regarded also as a molecular motor and the sites of start and stop of its walk on the DNA
mark the two ends of the genetic message that it transcribes into RNA. Interference of transcription of two overlapping genes is believed to regulate the levels of their expression, i.e., the overall
rate of the corresponding RNA synthesis, through suppressive effect of one on the other. Here we
model this process as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP motors that are characterized by two
distinct pairs of start and stop sites. Each group polymerizes identical copies of a RNA while the
RNAs polymerized by the two groups are different. These models, which may also be viewed as two
interfering totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes, account for all modes of transcriptional
interference in spite of their extreme simplicity. A combination of mean-field theory and computer
simulation of these models demonstrate the physical origin of the switch-like regulation of the two
interfering genes in both co-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of RNAP
motors.

INTRODUCTION

Synthesis of messenger RNA, a linear heteropolymer,
using the corresponding template DNA, is called transcription; it is carried out by a molecular machine called
RNA polymerase (RNAP) [1]. This machine also exploits the DNA template as a filamentous track for its
motor-like movement consuming input chemical energy
[2]. Polymerization of each RNA by a RNAP takes place
in three stages: (a) initiation at a specific ‘start’ site
(also called initiation site) on the template, (b) step-bystep elongation of the RNA, by one nucleotide in each
forward step of the RNAP motor, and (c) termination
at a specific ‘stop’ site (also called termination site) on
the template. For the sake of convenience, throughout
this paper we refer to the segment of the template DNA
between the start and the stop sites as a ‘gene’.
RNAPs moves from 3′ to the 5′ direction on a single
strand of DNA. Often multiple RNAPs polymerize the
same gene simultaneously. In such RNAP traffic [3, 4], all
the RNAPs engaged simultaneously in the transcription
process move in the same direction while polymerizing
identical copies of a RNA, all by initiating transcription
from the same start site and terminating at the same
stop site. Since any segment of the template DNA covered by one RNAP is not accessible simultaneously to any
other RNAP, this steric exclusion gives rise to nontrivial
spatio-temporal organization of RNAPs in RNAP traffic. Theoretical models of this kinetic process have been
developed over the last few years [4, 5, 24–27] by appro-

priately adapting, and extending, asymmetric exclusion
process (ASEP) [6, 7] , a popular model in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that we describe briefly in the
next section
In this communication we report theoretical studies of
more complex RNAP-traffic phenomena that are believed
to play important regulatory roles in living cells [8–11].
These phenomena arise from simultaneous transcription
of two overlapping genes either on the same DNA template or two genes on the two adjacent single strands
of a duplex (double-stranded) DNA. In the former case,
traffic is entirely uni-directional although RNAPs transcribing different genes polymerize two distinct species
of RNA molecules by starting (and stopping) at different sites on the same template DNA strand. In contrast, in the latter case, RNAP traffic in the two adjacent “lanes” move in opposite directions transcribing the
respective distinct genes. In both these situations the
phomenon of suppressive influence of one transcriptional
process on the other is called transcriptional interference
(TI) [12, 13].
In general, a RNAP at the initiation, elongation or
termination stage of one transcriptional process can suppress the initiation, or elongation (or termination) of the
other transcription by another RNAP [8–10]. In other
words, the stages of transcription of the two interfereing
RNAPs define a distinct mode of interference. Different
modes of interference have been assigned different names
like “occlusion”, “collision”, “sitting duck interference”,
etc. [12]. Many pairs of interfering transcription processes are known to form a bistable switch: switching
ON a high level of transcription of one of the two genes
can switch OFF the other by its suppressive effect [8–10].
The main aim of this communication is to demonstrate
this effect using a unified theoretical framework that we

2
develop here. This framework is capable of throwing light
on many other kinetic aspects of TI phenomena.
In this paper we develop a unified theoretical framework that, for a given relative orientation of two genes,
captures all possible modes of TI by a single set of master equations. Solving these equations, we investigate the
effects of TI on the rates of the two transcriptions. Moreover, by carrying out extensive computer simulations of
our model, we also test the validity of the mean-field approximations made in formulating the master equations.
We explore the effects of the spatial extent and relative orientation of the overlap of the two genes as well
as those of the kinetic parameters like initiation rates.
Our results demonstrate interesting regulatory phenomena arising from TI. In particular, the transcription of
one gene can be practically switched off by increasing
that of another to a sufficiently high level.

MODEL

FIG. 1: Schematic representation of TI model. (a) Codirectional mixed traffic with separate ramps: transcription of two
overlapping genes. (b) Contradirectional traffic on adjoining unequal tracks: sense and anti-sense transcription of two
overlapping genes

We represent a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by a linear chain (i.e., a one-dimensional lattice) of equispaced
sites that are labelled by the integer index i. Each site
of this lattice denotes a nucleotide which is a monomeric
subunit of the DNA track. The chain serves both as the
template and track for the respective RNAP motors that
are engaged in its transcription. We also represent each
RNAP by a hard rod, i.e., an extended particle, of length
ℓ in the units of nucleotide length, i.e., it covers ℓ successive sites of the lattice simultaneously. Normally, ℓ is
typically 30 to 35 nucleotides. We denote the position of
a RNAP on its track by the lattice site at which the leftmost unit of the rod is located while the next ℓ−1 sites of
the lattice are merely covered by the RNAP. Thus, if the
lattice site j denotes the position of a RNAP then the

RNAP covers not only the site j but also the next ℓ − 1
sites j + 1, j + 2, ..., j + ℓ − 1. The RNAPs interact with
each other with only hard core repulsion that is captured
by imposing the condition that no lattice site is allowed
to be covered by more than one RNAP simultaneously.
We model both codirectional TI (TTI) and contradirectional TI (CTI) using suitably extended TASEPs. For
modeling interference of the expression of two genes we
incorporate two interfering TASEPs each characterized
by the respective distinct pair of start and stop sites and
two distinct species of RNAP motors. For modeling TTI
only a ssDNA template needs to be treated as the track
for both group of RNAP motors that transcribe the two
distinct genes simultaneously. But, for modeling simultaneous polymerization of sense and anti-sense transcripts,
which are encoded on the two distinct strands of a duplex DNA, we use two antiparallel lattices on which the
contra-directional traffic of the two groups of motors take
place.
We identify two sites separated by h nucleotides as the
start sites for the two genes; h is an integer that can
be positive, negative or zero (see fig.1). A fresh initiation of transcription of a gene, however, is not possible
as long as the first ℓ sites, starting from the start site of
that gene, remain fully or partly covered by any other
RNAP, irrespective of the identity of the gene that is
being transcribed by the latter. We denote the rates
of initiation of transcription of the two genes by α1 , α2 ,
respectively. Whenever ℓ successive sites, starting from
the start site of a gene on the DNA template is vacant,
a fresh RNAP is allowed to cover those ℓ sites thereby
initiating the corresponding transcription. Each RNAP
carries an unique label 1 or 2 depending on which of the
two genes it is engaed in transcribing; the label is assigned to it depending on the start site from where it
begins its walk on its track. Irrespective of the actual
numerical value of ℓ, each RNAP can move forward by
only one site in each step, provided the target site is not
already covered by any other RNAP. Single-site stepping
rule is motivated by the fact that a RNAP must transcribe the successive nucleotides one by one. A RNAP
engaged in the transcription of one of the two genes can
detach from the lattice only after it reaches the stop site
of the corresponding gene. However, so far as the rates of
termination are concerned, we assume the corresponding
rates to be β1 = β2 = β. L1 and L2 denote the lengths of
the two genes, measured in terms of the number of lattice
sites from the start to the stop sites of the corresponding
gene. The interference between the transcription of these
two genes takes place in the region of their overlap.
In the case of TTI no RNAP can pass the other immediately in front of it irrespective of which genes are being
transcribed by the two RNAPs. This is motivated by the
fact that in case of TTI both the genes are encoded on
the same ssDNA strand. In contrast, in the case of CTI,
when two RNAPs labelled by two distinct integer indices
1 and 2 (i.e., transcribing different genes) face each other
head-on, these are allowed to pass, albeit with a hop-

3
ping rate that is lower than that in the absence of the
obstruction, i.e., q1 < Q1 and q2 < Q2 . This prescription is motivated by the fact that the genes for the sense
and antisense transcripts are encoded on the two distinct
complementary strands of the duplex DNA which serve
as the tracks for the corresponding oppositely moving
RNAP traffic. However, in the same model of CTI if
a RNAP finds itself just behind another co-directional
RNAP in front (i.e., both transcribe the same gene and,
therefore, carry the same integer label) then the trailing
RNAP remains stalled till the site in front of it is vacated
by the leading RNAP. The motivation for this prescription is that the two RNAPs engaged in transcribing the
same gene move on the same ssDNA strand.

Let P (i|j) be the conditional probability that, given
a RNAP at site i, there is another RNAP at site
j located downstream along the lattice. Obviously,

given a RNAP at site i, site j is empty. Therefore, by

Note that the probability that the site i is occupied by a
RANP, irrespective
of the gene it is transcribing, is given

by P (i) = 2µ=1 Pµ (i).

Let ξ(j) be the probability that site j is not covered by

site i is given to be occupied by one RNAP, the site i − 1
can be covered by another RNAP if, and only if, the site
i − ℓ is also occupied.

which denotes the probability of finding an RNAP on

gene µ(µ ≡ 1, 2) at time t, at lattice site i. Obviously,

RESULTS

Solving the master equations (1) and (2) numerically
under steady state conditions we obtained the corresponding rates of the transcriptions of the two genes.
Moreover, in order to test the range of validity of the
MFA made in writing the master equations, we also carried out extensive direct computer simulations of our
model using the same set of parameter values that we
used for solving the master equations. During the simulations, we monitored the flux of the RNAPs. The system
needed, typically, about two million time steps to attain

the steady state after which we collected the steady-state
data over the next five million time steps. The steadystate properties presented in this paper are averages of
the data collected only in the steady state of the system.
All the numerical results plotted in this paper have been
obtained for ℓ = 10, L1 = 1000 and L2 = 1100; by comparing with the results for a few other lengths of RNAPs
and genes, we ensured that our conclusions do not suffer
from any artefacts of the choice of these parameters.

mean-field theoretic predictions and violet data points have
been obtained from computer simulations.

gap detected at any arbitrary site between the departure
of a RNAP and the arrival of the next RNAP becomes
shorter. Therefore, the site for the initiation of transcription of gene 2, which is located on the path of the
RNAP traffic on gene 1, remains “occluded” for most of
the time if α1 is sufficiently high. Consequently, a high
rate of expression of gene 1 strongly suppresses the expression of gene 2, irrespective of the actual numerical
value of α2 . Thus, the rates of transcription of the two
genes are strongly anti-correlated.
The role of “suppressor” and suppressed” genes are interchanged as the separation h between the transcription
initiation sites is varied from a positive integer to a negative integer (see fig.3) The sharp changes take place only
over a narrow interval of the order of ℓ around h = 0.

Results for contradirectional traffic

Although the results on flux, plotted in fig.4, are
qualitatively similar to the corresponding results for codirectional traffic plotted in fig.2, there are some additional features. The kinks observed in the density profiles shown in the insets of fig.4 are consequences of the
extended “defect” created by the slower moving RNAPs
against the faster moving ones [14].

Results for co-directional traffic

In fig.2 we plot the fluxes of RNAPs in the two traffic which, as explained above, are the overall rates of
transcription of the two genes. First of all, note that
for any given value of α2 , gene 2 would have got transcribed normally at a fairly high rate if the gene 1 were
not interfering with its transcription. As long as α1 is
not too high, the rate of transcription of gene 2 is weakly
affected by infrequent co-directional “collisions” and proceeds at a fairly high rate. But, as α1 increases the time

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Co-directional and contra-directional two-species
TASEP, both on a single track and two parallel tracks,
have been studied earlier for purely theoretical consideration as well as for capturing real physical processes
[15–18]. But, in all those models a single pair of start
and stop sites serve as the entry and exit points for both
species of particles. Motivated by cytoskeletal motor
traffic, TASEP-based models with two distinct species
of oppositely moving self-propelled particles have been

6
developed earlier [19–23]. Since those motors can attach
to and detach from any lattice site, except for quantitative difference in the values of attachment/detachment,
the motor kinetics at the two ends of the track were
qualitatively no different from those at any other site.
In contrast, for the transcription of a specific gene,
RNAP motors have to start and stop their walk at
pre-designated sites. Moreover, premature detachment
of a RNAP, which would produce a truncated RNA
strand, is not allowed in our model because such errors
occur very rarely.
In most of the earlier theoretical models on RNAP traffic [24–28] all the RNAP were engaged in transcribing a
single gene; therefore the traffic was uni-directional and
every RNAP polymerized identical copies of the RNA
while a single pair of start-stop sites marked the points of
initiation and termination of transcription. In contrast,
in the models reported in this paper two distinct pairs of
start-stop sites mark the points of initiation and termination of the respective genes. Moreover, the RNA species
that gets polymerized by a RNAP depends on the sites
from which it initiates transcription. Thus copies of two
distinct species of RNA get synthesized simultaneously
by a mixed population of two groups of RNAP motors
the relative direction of whose movements is dictated by
the relative orientation of the two genes.
In our model of TI in co-directional mixed RNAP traffic we assumed that a RNAP passively waits at its current
position if the target nucleotide in front is already cov-

ered by another RNAP. The temporarily stalled RNAP
can resume its forward movement, and the concomitant
transcriptional activity, only after its target site is vacated by the RNAP immediately in front of it. We have
also ignored the possibility of backtracking of the individual RNAP motors [27, 29, 30]. In future extensions of
our model [31], we intend to explore the effects of backtracking, active re-starting of stalled RNAP by a trailing RNAP [32, 33] as well as premature detachment of
RNAPs upon suffering collision.
In addition to the differences in the models developed
here and all other TASEP-type models described above,
the main questions addressed in those models are also
fundamentally different from those addressed in this paper. In all the earlier theoretical works the effects of the
different modes of interference have been studied separately [34, 35]. The simple TASEP-based unified model
that we have developed here not only captures all possible modes of transcriptional interference, but also accounts for the self-regulation of the pair of genes through
the adaptation of the levels of their interfering transcriptions.
