Recently, a growing interest has been addressed to the electrical properties of bacteriorhodopsin
(bR), a protein belonging to the transmembrane protein family. Several experiments pointed out
the role of green light in enhancing the current flow in nanolayers of bR, thus confirming potential
applications of this protein in the field of optoelectronics . By contrast, the mechanisms underlying
the charge transfer and the associated photocurrent are still far from being understood at a microscopic level. To take into account the structure-dependent nature of the current, in a previous
set of papers we suggested a mechanism of sequential tunneling among neighbouring amino acids.
As a matter of fact, it is well accepted that, when irradiated with green light, bR undergoes a
conformational change at a molecular level. Thus, the role played by the protein tertiary-structure
in modeling the charge transfer cannot be neglected. The aim of this paper is to go beyond previous
models, in the framework of a new branch of electronics, we called proteotronics, which exploits the
ability to use proteins as reliable, well understood materials, for the development of novel bioelectronic devices. In particular, the present approach assumes that the conformational change is not
the unique transformation that the protein undergoes when irradiated by light. Instead, the light
can also promote a free-energy increase of the protein state that, in turn, should modify its internal
degree of connectivity, here described by the change in the value of an interaction radius associated
with the physical interactions among amino acids. The implemented model enables us to achieve a
better agreement between theory and experiments in the region of a low applied bias by preserving
the level of agreement at high values of applied bias. Furthermore, results provide new insights on
the mechanisms responsible for bR photoresponse.
I.

INTRODUCTION

Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is the best known protein in
the family of opsins, proteins conjugated with a molecule
of retinal and able to convert visible light into electrostatic energy [1]. This protein is found in a primeval
organism, the Halobacterium salinarum, specifically in a
part of its cell membrane called purple membrane (PM),
since its color. This membrane, 5 nm thick, is a natural
thin film, essentially constituted by few lipids and these
proteins organized in an hexagonal lattice [2].
A large number of studies has been carried out on bR
in the field of biophysics and physicochemistry [3–5], and
many aspects have been unveiled. As relevant examples
we cite: (i) the photoinduced isomerization of the retinal
embedded in bR [6], (ii) the conformational change of
bR associated with the retinal isomerization [7], (iii) the
importance of environmental conditions in the photocycle
development [8, 9].
Patches of PM have been used for several purposes: to
produce metal-protein-metal junctions [10–12], to perform c-AFM investigations[13, 14], to develop solar cells

of new generation [15], etc. As a matter of fact, films of
bR resist to thermal, electrical and also mechanical stress
[10–14] and show a substantial photocurrent when irradiated by a visible (green) light [10, 12, 16]. Therefore,
bR can be used as an optoelectrical switch, to convert
radiant energy into electrical energy [15], in pollutants
remediation systems [17], to produce optical memories
[18], to control neuronal and tissue activity [19, 20], etc.
The commonly accepted view concerning the protein
activation is the following: A photon is absorbed by the
retinal molecule contained in each protein, then causing the bending of this molecule. As a consequence, the
protein undergoes a change of its tertiary structure, following a cycle of transformations that arrives to release a
proton outside the cell membrane. Finally, reprotonization of the retinal molecule by Asp96 restores the native
configuration. Some crystallographic investigations have
been performed on this protein to determine its configuration in the different steps of the cycle [8]. This is a
particularly hard task, since the X-ray radiation could
modify the protein structure, and only recently the puzzle of many contradictory results starts to be recomposed
[21]. At present, a rather complete description of the
protein is given only for the native and the active L-state
[22, 23].
Measurements of the protein current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics were reported in several papers [10–14].

2
To this purpose, samples made of patches of PM were
anchored on a conductive substrate and connected to an
external circuit. The connection was made with : i) an
extended transparent conductive contact [10–12], ii) a tip
of a c-AFM [13, 14]. In both cases, the measured current was found to be quasi-Ohmic at the lowest bias, and
strongly super-linear at increasing bias. Furthermore,
when the sample was irradiated with green light [10, 12],
a significant photocurrent was observed. There was a
clear proof that the charge transfer is mainly due to the
protein [10, 12]. There was also a high resistance channel
due to the lipid membrane, which is detected in experiments involving a membrane deformation [13, 24]. In
the absence of membrane deformation, this channel can
be neglected. The charge transfer through the protein
was attributed to a tunneling mechanism [10, 13, 24, 25].
In particular, the presence of a current (in dark) well
above possible leakage components, and of a photocurrent (in light) supports the hypothesis of a mechanism
of charge transfer intrinsically dependent on the protein
tertiary structure [24–32].
Since a long time, the interaction of electromagnetic
fields with biological matter is the object of many investigations, mainly for the damages produced by ionizing radiations. As far as known, sunlight that reaches
the Earth is largely composed of non-ionizing radiations
whose main effect on biological matter is heating. In particular, for proteins, this should lead to a global energy
enhancement, regardless of the protein specific conformational state, as confirmed by recent experiments showing
the critical role of temperature in current measurements
[12]. Therefore, we conjecture that in a sample of proteins, like a patch of purple membrane, light gives rise to
different effects. From one side, the retinal modification
with the consequent conformational change from the native to the active state, from another side, a net transfer
of energy to the whole protein with a consequent increase
of its free-energy. As a general issue, both these effects
should contribute to the protein activation.
The present paper addresses this issue by accounting simultaneously for these two effects in a computational/theoretical model called INPA (impedance network protein analogue). This approach describes the
electrical characteristics of a protein by using a network
of impedances. In previous investigations, the local interaction of a photon with the retinal has been investigated
by considering the corresponding change of the network
structure The novelty of the present paper consists in
the further introduction of a global energy increase of
the the whole protein due to the incident light. This is
described by a change of the network connectivity both
of the native and the active state.
The methodological approach we follow points to the
integration of different disciplines (molecular biology,
physics, electronics) to develop a new generation of electronic devices within a nano-bio-technology. This interdisciplinary approach is leading to an entirely new discipline which we christen proteotronics [33].

The paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the main steps of the INPA model and describes
the improvements introduced on the basis of the dynamical evolution of the protein energy landscape. Section
III reports and discusses the main results and suggests
the opening of new perspectives. Major conclusions are
summarized in Section IV.
II.

THEORETICAL MODEL

The INPA model is based on a percolative approach
that describes the protein like a network of links and
nodes. A node represents a single amino acid and its spatial position is the same of the corresponding Cα atom.
A link joins a couple of nodes, and represents the interaction between amino acids[34–36]. The protein structure
in its native or active state is taken by public databases or
homology modeling [22, 37], thus the node configuration
reproduces the protein backbone. Then, couples of nodes
are connected with the rule that they must be be closer
than an assigned interaction radius, Rc . In this way, the
number of links, N , depends on the value of Rc and is
in the range 0 ≤ Naa ≤ Naa (Naa − 1)/2, with Naa the
number of amino acids pertaining to the given protein.
In the present case, the macroscopic quantity of interest
is the static I-V characteristic. Therefore, the network is
drawn like an electrical circuit where an elementary resistance, Ri,j , is associated with each link between nodes
i and j. Explicitly:
Ri,j =

li,j
ρ
Ai,j

(1)

where Ai,j = π(Rc2 − li,j /4), is the cross-sectional area
between two spheres of radius Rc centered on the i-th
and j-th node, respectively; li,j is the distance between
the sphere centers, ρ is the resistivity.
By positioning the input and output electrical contacts, respectively, on the first and last node (more structured contacts can be envisioned) for a given applied bias
(current or voltage operation modes according to convenience) the network is solved within a linear Kirchhoff
scheme and its global resistance, R, is calculated [24–
33]. Accordingly, this network produces a parameterdependent static I-V characteristic for the single protein,
based on the standard relation:
V = RI.

(2)

To account for the super-linear behaviour of current at increasing voltages, a tunneling mechanism of charge transfer is included. In doing so, a stochastic approach within
a Monte Carlo scheme [24, 25, 27, 29–32] is used. In
particular, following the Simmons model [38], a mechanism containing two possible tunneling processes, a direct
tunneling (DT) at low bias, and a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FN) at high bias, is introduced. Therefore, the
resistivity value of each link is chosen between a low value

ρmin , taken to fit the current at the highest voltages, and
a high value ρ(V ), which depends on the voltage drop
between network nodes as:
ρ(V ) = ρMAX

(eV < Φ),

where ρMAX is the maximal resistivity value taken to
fit the I-V characteristic at the lowest voltages (Ohmic
response) and Φ is the height of the tunneling barrier between nodes. The transmission probability of each tunneling process is given by [25, 27]:

response and the FN subscript refers to the high-bias,
super-Ohmic response.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

By construction, both the current response at very low
and very high bias exhibit an Ohmic behaviour with values of the corresponding resistance differing for several
orders of magnitude. This model was successfully used
to reproduce the experiments of Ref. [13]. The inputs parameters were Rc =6 Å, Φ=219 meV, ρMAX = 4×1013 Ω
Å, for the low field resistivity and ρmin = 4 × 104 ΩÅ for
the high field resistivity. The protein tertiary structure
was taken from the protein database [22], specifically the
2NTU entry, an X-ray crystallographic measurement for
bR native-state.
The agreement between calculations and experiments
was found to be satisfactory, also reproducing the current modifications due to the membrane indentation by
the c-AFM tip [24]. On this basis, we found reasonable
to take the same input to fit the response of the protein
in light. At present, the only crystallographic entry describing the complete protein in an active state is 2NTW,
which gives account of the L-state (henceforth called the
active state) of bR. This state is sensitive to the 550 nm
light and precedes the M state (410 nm), which corresponds to a proton releasing. In the I-V measurements,
the proton releasing was not monitored and the current
measured was only attributed to electron transfer [10].
When the activated configuration was used as input to
fit the current response in the presence of light, the agreement with experiments was less satisfactory than that in
dark. A possible way to overcome this drawback is to
assume that the presence of light modifies not only the

protein structure but also its connectivity properties. In
the INPA model this modification is accounted for by
changing the value of the interaction radius. To this purpose, Fig. 1 reports the role of the interaction radius in
the calculation of the resistances of the native and active
states. Numerical data are obtained at very low voltages, where the Ohmic regime strictly holds, and reflect
the protein topology. The main results of Fig. 1 are:
(i) the general low resolution between these states and,
(ii) the presence of two regions in which the resolution is
best appreciable, around Rc = 6 Å and Rc = 9 Å. The
experiments are in agreement with Rc = 6 Å.
In the following the protein current responses are numerically analyzed for several values of Rc around 6 Å.
In particular, simulations for the single protein are performed for the three values, Rc = 5.8, 6.0 and 6.3 Å and
for both native and active state. Results are reported
in Fig. 2 with panel (a) reporting the experimental data
carried out in a bR macroscopic sample [10] in dark and
light. For a given protein state, Fig. 2 shows a current
enhancement by increasing Rc from 5.8 to 6.3 Å. Furthermore, at increasing Rc , the differences between the
current response in dark and light are more and more
marked.
The above results suggest that the activation mechanism of a macroscopic sample of bR can be described
within the single protein model by using: i) a conformational change (from 2NTU to 2NTW structure), ii)
a connectivity change (i.e. a variation of the network
interaction radius).
More specifically, we can envision a twofold mechanism
of photon absorption: by the retinal, and by the whole
protein. The former is responsible of the conformational
change, the latter of a global energy increase of the protein. Notice that, according with experiments [12], the
global energy increase is coherently used by the protein
sample in enhancing its photocurrent response. In other
words, the electromagnetic radiation impinging on the

protein may anyway produce the global effect of an energy gain, while the local interaction of a photon with
the retinal triggers the conformational change when the
protein is in its native state. These mechanisms associated with photon absorption are schematically depicted
in Fig. 3. From one hand, when the native state, say
U , becomes an active state, say W , a further irradiation
should enhance the global energy of the active state. In
this way, the active state is promoted to an upper energy
value W ′ . From another hand, when the U state does
not undergo a conformational change, anyway its energy
level can be promoted to an upper value U ′ ; a further
dose of light may drive this state to an active state W ′ .
Among the different ways used to describe the protein
energy landscape at different stages of the folding, one of
the most accepted is the rugged funnel-diagram [39]. In

this diagram, the protein folds from the molten state to
the native (stable) state following many possible folding
routes toward the minimum of a funnel-like energy surface. When the protein runs down in the energy funnel,
it loses the spurious bonds and enforces those stabilizing the minimal-energy configuration [39]. In doing so,
it also reaches the minimum of the configurational entropy. Furthermore, the phase transition from a stable
state at low energy to a stable state at higher energy is
depicted in terms of a tunneling between the minima of
a multiwell energy landscape [40]. As energy increases,
the spurious connections do again appear and the protein
can explore more microstates. In a very schematic way,
this mechanism is pictured in Fig. 4 where a couple of
funnels representing the native and an active state are
superimposed. The conformational change corresponds
to the transition from a funnel to another one. The minimal energy between the two funnel stable minima is of
the order of the eV. Otherwise, by rising the energy of
the protein in the native state, it is possible to reach the
overlapping region of the two funnels. Here the transition from the native to the active state can occur without
energy supply.
Within the INPA model, the mechanism of energy increase is described by an increase of the Rc value. As a
consequence, the network becomes more connected which
implies an increase of the pathways for tunneling and of
the number of possible current channels. This, in turn,
leads to an increase of the instantaneous current fluctuations, as reported in Fig. 5. Here, the current fluctuations observed from simulations are reported for the
active state, with an applied bias of 0.75 V and for two
Rc values of 5.8 and 6.3 Å.
Following this scheme, the current response of samples
made by monolayers of bR has been fitted by using a
binary mixture of native and active states; the percentages of each state being a function of the Rc value [28].
Specifically, a good fit of the experimental data [10] is
obtained by using: (i) for the sample in light, Rc = 6.3
Å and a binary mixture of 96% of 2NTW and a 4% of
2NTU; (ii) For the sample in dark Rc = 5.8 Å and 100%
of 2NTU.
The c-AFM experiment, performed in the absence of
direct light [13], was previously fitted within a very good
accuracy on the full bias range by using Rc = 6.0 Å and
100% of the 2NTW native state [24]. Since in these experiments one cannot exclude the presence of a certain
amount of proteins IN the active state, in agreement with
a value of Rc larger than the threshold value Rc = 5.8
Å here the fit with experiments is tested by using binary
mixtures with an increasing percentage of active states.
The fit is found to be sufficiently accurate with a percentage of active state not larger than 40%. Figure 6
reports: (i) the experimental data [10, 13] and, (ii) the

the experiments reported in Fig. 7. For the case of the
experiments in Ref. [10], further binary mixtures with

In the present context, the meaning of the function
f is the following: for an increasing number of photons
impinging onto the sample, the free energy of the protein
grows and, as a consequence, the value of Rc also grows.
With Rc also the percentage of proteins moved to the
active state grows because some of the photons hit the
retinal. Finally, for Rc larger than about 7 Å all the
proteins in the sample are in the active state. Further
amount of photons may only improve the free energy of
the protein in the active state and the internal degree of
connections.

CONCLUSIONS

The paper investigates the mechanisms responsible for
the photocurrent exhibited by monolayer samples of bacteriorhodopsin in the presence of an impinging green
light. To this purpose, use is made of the INPA model
implemented to account for the change of connectivity
of the single protein associated with the presence of the
light. Previous results provided a satisfactory interpretation of a set of accurate measurements, performed with
the c-AFM technique, in nanolayer samples and in the
absence of direct light. Accordingly, experiments were
interpreted on the basis of the tertiary structure associated with the native state of the single protein. However,
a less satisfactory agreement was obtained in the region
of low voltages when the same approach was applied to

the case of monolayer samples of bR in the presence of
light, and thus taking the tertiary structure of the protein in its active state. To overcome this drawback, here
we consider also the change in the connectivity of the
protein state consequent to the enhancement of the freeenergy level of the single protein induced by the presence
of the light. The increase in connectivity is accounted for
by an increase of the value of the interaction radius, Rc ,
already introduced to correlate the electrical properties
with the tertiary structure of the protein. Accordingly,
the new model interprets the photocurrent using a binary
mixture of results pertaining to the native and active
structures with the proper values of Rc [28]. Specifically,
a satisfactory fit of experiments on nanolayers [10] is obtained by using: (i) for the sample in light, Rc = 6.3
Å and a binary mixture of 96% of 2NTW and of 4 %
of 2NTU, (ii) for the sample in dark, Rc = 5.8 Å and
100 % of 2NTU. The c-AFM experiments, performed in
the absence of direct light, are quite finely reproduced by
using a binary mixture containing up to 40% of 2NTW
and Rc =6.0 Å(see Fig. 6). Therefore, the implemented
model enables us to achieve a better agreement between
theory and experiments in the region of low applied bias
and does not modify previous findings at high values of
applied bias.
We notice that the process of protein activation, in
particular for opsins, is still a very open topic [39, 40]
and the present approach aims to provide a further step
for a better understanding of the subject. Environmental effects, different from the presence of light, like temperature, the value of the pH, etc, should be responsible for other activation mechanisms. Accordingly, more
experiments, and structural information are necessary,
and present results should give a further motivation to
stimulate new experiments and formulate new theories.
Finally, this research exploits the trend in which different emerging disciplines can converge in a new branch
of science, we recently introduced as proteotronics [33].
Indeed, proteotronics aims to develop new devices based
on the sensing properties of proteins. In doing so, protein
responses to external stimuli have chances to be better
understood and used to devise biodevices of relevant importance in applied sciences.
