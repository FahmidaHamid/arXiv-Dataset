Heterogeneity within tumour cell populations is associated with an increase in malignancy and
appears to play an important role during cancer metastasis. Using in silico experiments, we study
the interplay between collective behaviours and cell motility heterogeneities in a model system.
Working with tumour spheroids that contain two non-proliferating cell populations of different
motile properties, we explore the conditions required for maximal invasion into surrounding tissues.
We show emerging spatial patterns of cellular organisation and invasion which are consistent with in
vitro and in vivo observations. This demonstrates that mechanical interactions at the cellular level
are sufficient to account for many of the observed morphologies of invasion and that heterogeneity
in cell motility can be more important than average mechanical properties in controlling the fate of
large cell populations.

Metastasis, the process during which cancer cells migrate away from primary tumour and disseminate in
other organs, accounts for more than 90% of cancer fatalities [1]. At the cellular level, malignant cell behaviour
has been associated with an accumulation of gene mutations and a malfunction of numerous regulatory signalling pathways [2]. Moreover, following earlier pioneering works [3], recent analyses have established that most
malignant solid tumours are a mosaic of different cell
populations with different phenotypic traits [4]. Owing
to the variability in these factors across different pathologies, patients and even tumours, no common mechanistic pathway leading to the induction and progression of
metastasis has been yet characterized [5, 6].
In contrast, recent advances in imaging techniques at the
tissue scale [7–9], along with histopathological studies on
patients’ biopsies [9], draw a surprisingly unified picture
of cancer invasion in terms of cell migration behaviours.
In most cancers, despite tremendous variations in gene
expression and biochemical environment, tumour cells
are able to invade collectively by maintaining intercellular coordination [9–11], generating hence multicellular
structures such as cell sheets, strands or clusters remaining cohesive and polarised [10]. Accumulating evidence
suggests that the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity
observed in these structures plays a key role in the invasion of the tumour cells into surrounding tissues. Collective invasion of otherwise non-invasive tumour cells can
be driven by invasion-competent cancer cells [12–15] or
stromal fibroblasts [11, 16] through a “leader / follower”
invasion mechanism [9]. These patterns of collective behaviour suggest that a system-level analysis is needed to
account for the generic aspects of tumour cell invasion.
Cooperative behaviours are observed in a number of biological contexts such as collective animal behaviours
[17], glassy dynamics of epithelial tissues [18–21], wound
healing [22–24] and early developmental processes [25–
27]. Moreover, a number of physical factors modulating

collective behaviours in tissues have also been investigated: geometrical confinement of cells [28–30], mechanical and topographical properties of the extracellular matrix [31–33] and forces applied by neighbouring tissues
[34–37]. Physical models inspired by self-propelled particles [38, 39] have recapitulated some of these experimental findings and demonstrated that interactions between
cell populations and their environments can be understood without resorting to subcellular processes [40, 41].
But most of these studies have focused so far on well controlled homogeneous cell populations and the role of heterogeneity in cell populations remains poorly addressed,
both experimentally and theoretically.
In this letter, we use the framework introduced in [42]
to analyse the effect of cell heterogeneity on tumour invasion. The model involves a Cellular Potts algorithm
[43] including where appropriate a self-propelled term
to account for the active motion of the cells. Tumours
are modelled as 2D packed populations of motile cells of
spheroid shape surrounded by cohesive tissues made of
passive cells that mechanically resist invasion. Although
real tumours are far more complex, this approach provides a simple dynamic framework to analyse in general
terms the interplay between cell motility and cell-cell interactions in cell invasion. We will first study the initiation of invasion in the case of homogeneous tumours
as a benchmark case. Timescales involved in this study
are short enough to ignore tumour growth and cell proliferation. We then quantify the effect of population heterogeneity by introducing a small proportion of highly
motile cells into the system.
In the model, tissues are represented on a 2D lattice
of 1280 by 1280 pixels, where the value i of each pixel
codes for the identity of the cell on that location. The
cell volume Vi (t) is constrained to a target value V0 [L2 ]
by a bulk modulus κ [E/L2 ]. The interfacial cell-cell interactions, such as adhesion or cortical tensions, are all
accounted for by a single parameter, J [E/L], which sets

the surface energy of cell membrane. The active motion
of each cell is driven by a motile force f i (t) = µi ni acting
on a fixed substrate, where ni (t) defines the cell polarization axis and µi [E/L] its active motile force magnitude, which depends on the cell type. The motile force
is used to calculate a migration energy function which
captures the mechanical work generated by each active
cell: wi = −f i ·r i [E], where r i represents the position of
the cell centroid. At any given time, volume constraint,

where i represents the cell index and (k, k 0 ) represent
pairs of neighbouring pixels. δi(k)i(k0 ) is 1 when both
pixels belong to the same cell and 0 otherwise. The system dynamics results from the iterative minimisation of
this energy function through the Metropolis Monte-Carlo
algorithm [42]. Time is here expressed in Monte Carlo
steps (MCS), where 1 MCS corresponds to an average of
one iteration per pixel over the whole lattice. The polarization vector of a cell, ni (t), also evolves over time
and is set along the direction of the mean previous displacements of the cell in the time interval [t − τ, t]; τ represents the time-scale at which cell polarity responds to
external stimuli and controls the persistence length of the
cell trajectory in the absence of other cells [44]. To highlight the role of cell migration, all cell populations have
the same mechanical, interfacial and dynamical properties (V0 = 400 pixel2 , κ = 1, J = 5, τ = 10 MCS, noise
level T = 2.5 [E]). They only differ in the value taken by
their motile forces. Earlier work [42] has studied in detail
the role of the different model parameters and identified
two important behavioural transitions in the populations
dynamics (cf. the Table 1 of supplementary materials):
(i) A transition from static epithelial behaviour to collective streaming in homogeneous motile populations, at
a critical value of the motile force parameter µc ≈ 0.125.
(ii) A critical force µs ≈ 0.225 needed for a single cell to
migrate through a non motile population.
We first quantify the short time scale dynamics of invasion in homogeneous tumour spheroids. These structures
consist of bulk tumour cells of motile force µb and possess an initial radius R0 of the order of 10 cell diameters
corresponding to a population of around 300 cells. Invasion is measured as a cumulative length Λb (µb , t) which is
the sum of the distances to the initial tumour boundary
for all cancer cells i who left the tumour. This averaged
quantity encompasses both the spatial extent of invasion
and the number of invading cells. Λb varies almost linearly with time for the first thousand MCS as shown in
the inset of Fig. 1.b. The degree of malignancy of the
system, i.e the capacity of bulk tumours cells to invade
surrounding tissues, can be characterised as a rate of invasion at short time scales, Γb (µb ) = Λb (µb , ∆t)/∆t. The
evolution of Γb as a function of the cells’ motile force µb
is represented on figure Fig.1.b, for ∆t = 1200 MCS.
Homogeneous tumours display behaviours ranging from
no invasion to weak collective protrusions to widespread
single cell dispersal (see Fig.1.a). Transitions are controlled by the two critical motile forces µc and µs previously defined (see movies 1 and 2 in supplementary
materials). These qualitative transitions are reflected in
the invasion rate as shown in Fig.1.b. The regime where

µc < µb < µs is remarkable as invasion, although slow,
is observed and takes the form of finger-like collective
patterns (cf. Fig.1.a bottom-right quadrant and movie
3 in supplementary materials), as described in many in
vivo studies [7–9]. This suggests that the emergence of
finger-like protrusions is the result of simple physical interactions in a regime where single cells are not strong
enough to invade the surrounding tissue, but coordinated
cell groups can do so by collectively generating larger
forces. This process occurs without any directional cue or
specific interaction between cells, other than mechanical
forces between cells. While this might capture a fundamental mechanism involved in the early stages of collective invasion, the rates are however low compared to what
is qualitatively expected from the experimental literature
[12] and would not be sufficient to explain why these are
associated with highly malignant situations. The sensitivity and convexity of the invasion rate to the motile
force of the tumour cells suggests that introducing heterogeneities in the motile properties of the cancer cells
could have a significant effect on invasion rates and patterns.
We now consider a tumour spheroid surrounded by
a small number Nf of cells with a larger motile force
(µf ), inspired by fibroblasts or stronger tumour cells
sub-populations but representing more generally a certain level of heterogeneity in the system (cf. Fig. 2.a).
We analysed the system’s response for Nf = 6, 12 or 24,
i.e. about 2%, 4% or 8% of the total motile cell population, respectively. The invasive behaviour of bulk tumour
cells in the presence of these particular cells is quantified as previously by the invasion length Λf (µb , µf , Nf , t)
and the corresponding invasion rate Γf (µb , µf , Nf ) =
Λf (t)/∆t. To quantify more specifically the effect of
heterogeneity on the invasion efficiency, we extract the
percentage increase in the invasion rate per stronger cell:
Ω(µb , µf ) = ∂Nf Γf /Γb (Fig. 2.b). As expected, the
presence of stronger cells brings no significant enhancement to the invasion efficiency for µb ≥ µs , where the
bulk of the cancer cells are able to invade on their own
(see movie 4 in supplementary materials). When both
bulk and stronger tumour cells generate a motile force
below the threshold for single cell invasion, there is only
a marginal effect on the invasion (see movie 5 in supplementary materials). In contrast, when the bulk of
the tumour is in the regime of collective invasion (µc ≤
µb ≤ µs ), the addition of a small number of stronger cells
(µf ≥ µs ) has a dramatic effect. Each of them increases
significantly the invasion rate (20% ≤ Ω ≤ 45%) for a
restricted µf value range. The increase in invasion rate
has an optimum for µb ≈ 0.150 and µf ≈ 0.350. To understand the significance of this optimum, we analysed
the morphology of the tumour at the onset of invasion.
Fig. 2.a illustrates the typical spatial arrangements between stronger and bulk tumour cells in protrusive fingers, in which stronger cells are commonly seen initiat-

ing and leading fingers (see movie 6 in supplementary
materials). To quantify these morphological features, a
graph-based method is used to identify the contact network of cells leaving the tumour. Fingers are defined
as groups connected to the tumour body and more than
two cells away from the tumour boundary. The tip is
defined as the cell of the finger which is topologically the
further away from the original tumour boundary. The
length of the finger is the shortest path length between
its tip and the original tumour boundary, measured in
number of cells. Fig. 3.a shows the proportion of fingers
led by a stronger cell, pooling all data from experiments

with 6, 12 and 24 stronger cells. In the regime of collective invasion (µc ≤ µb ≤ µs ), up to 70% of the fingers
can be led by stronger cells, far more than what would
be expected from their density at the tumour boundary
(about 25-30%) in average. When µb > µs , fingers become a transient feature in the invasion and are equally
likely to be led by any cell type. Consequently, the proportion of fingers led by a stronger cell decreases. Similarly, when µb < µc , bulk cells cannot migrate on their
own and any invading structure forming would be pulled
by stronger cells. The fact that the proportion of finger led by a stronger cell decreases with µf beyond the
optimum is however more surprising (see marks 5 and
6 in Fig. 3.a). Why would an increase in their motility
reduce their ability to lead fingers? To interpret this, we

plotted on Fig. 3.b the number of fingers per strong cell
as a function of µf for µb = 0.150. As µf increases, the
proportion of strong cells that generate fingers increases
to a plateau value of approximately one in three. This
plateau is expected since cell orientations are not biased
in the model and only a finite fraction of them would
migrate away from the tumour from the beginning of the
simulation. The finger initiation step is therefore not
responsible for the invasiveness decay at large µf . However, the finger length has a maximum for an intermediate value of µf ≈ 0.350, consistent with the optimum
observed in Fig. 2.b. Sustaining the growth of a finger
is therefore distinct from the ability to initiate it. Both
properties are however complementary to control tumour
invasivity; by multiplying the maps of finger number per
stronger cell and relative increase in finger length (cf.
Fig.4 in supplementary materials), we recapitulate the
profile of Fig. 2.a. What makes fingers shorter for large
µf is the fact that strong cells tend to escape individually soon after fingers are initiated, leaving behind short
fingers that are unable to invade further into the tissue
(cf. movie 6 in supplementary materials).
Overall, heterogeneities in the migratory properties of
cells combined with simple principles of collective motion appear to be sufficient to reproduce a large number
of experimentally observed invasion morphologies. The
model shows that strongly invasive behaviours involve a
cooperative process between different sub-populations of
tumour cells. Pattern of cell types along invasive fingers
emerge without any requirement for specific interactions
between these cell types. Therefore, understanding the
role of population heterogeneity goes beyond characterising the distribution of their biophysical properties; in
particular, one cannot assess the invasive and metastatic
potential of a tumour only based on the proportion and
strength of its most invasive cells [5]. However, the local
tumour environment and dynamic coupling that exists
between cells within the population do control morphologies and malignancy. This paper provides an illustration
of how diverse the emerging patterns of invasion can be
with only three cell populations. A general approach
for the physics of heterogeneities in collective systems is
still lacking, but there is no doubt that it would provide
an important contribution to understanding a number
of biological processes both in animal development and
clinical research.
