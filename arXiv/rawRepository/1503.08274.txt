Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in cell fate decisions after DNA damage. Programmed Cell Death
5 (PDCD5) is known to interact with the p53 pathway to promote cell apoptosis. Recombinant human PDCD5
can significantly sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies. In the present paper, we construct a computational
model that includes PDCD5 interactions in the p53 signaling network and study the effects of PDCD5 on p53mediated cell fate decisions during the DNA damage response. Our results revealed that PDCD5 functions as a
co-activator of p53 that regulates p53-dependent cell fate decisions via the mediation of p53 dynamics. The effects
of PDCD5 are dose-dependent such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics at different PDCD5
levels. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two mechanisms during the two phases of sustained
and pulsed p53 dynamics. This study provides insights regarding how PDCD5 functions as a regulator of the p53
pathway and might be helpful for increasing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which PDCD5 can
be used to treat cancers.

INTRODUCTION
The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in cellular responses to various stresses, such as oxidative stress,
hypoxia, telomere erosion and DNA damage (19, 26). As a powerful transcription factor, p53 primarily functions by
inducing the transcription of many different downstream genes, including p21/WAF1/CIP1 and GADD45, which
are involved in cell cycle arrest, and PUMA, Bax and PIG3, which induce apoptosis (17, 18, 24). p53 can also
control apoptosis through a transcription-independent mechanism (33). Fine control of p53 activity is crucial for
proper cellular responses.
In unstressed cells, p53 is maintained at low levels via interactions with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Mdm2
(23), Pirh2 (25), COP1 (13) and ARG-BP1 (10), which mediate p53 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. Under stressed conditions such as DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and activated to induce the expression
of downstream target genes. This process leads to different cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis;
the former facilitates DNA repair and promotes cell survival, whereas the latter provides an efficient way to remove
damaged cells (40). These processes are tightly controlled by the binding partners and post-translational modifications (30). For example, upon the occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the DSB detector ATM is
activated and induces the phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2 (4, 22, 37, 46). Phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2
inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and therefore stabilizes p53. p53 can be phosphorylated or acetylated at
multiple sites by different protein kinases, and its stability and sequence-specific DNA binding activity are modulated through these processes (8). Phosphorylation at Ser15 by ATM/ATR leads to cell cycle arrest (2), whereas
further phosphorylation at Ser46 by HIPK2 promotes the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as p53AIP1 (36).
Acetylation of p53 at Lys120 by Tip60 induces the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as bax and puma (47).
Programmed Cell Death 5 (PDCD5; formerly referred to as TF-1 cell apoptosis-related gene 19 (TFAR19)) is
known to promote apoptosis in different cell types in response to various stimuli and also to enhance TAJ/TROYinduced paraptosis-like cell death (28, 51). PDCD5 is rapidly upregulated following apoptotic stimuli and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during early apoptosis (12). Decreased expression of PDCD5 has been
detected in various human tumors, including lung cancer (45), gastric cancer (55), chronic myelogenous leukemia
(41), prostate cancer (14), epithelial ovarian carcinoma (58), astrocytic glioma (27) and chondrosarcoma (9). Moreover, the restoration of PDCD5 with recombinant protein or an adenovirus expression vector can significantly
sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies (9, 42, 44, 50). Thus, PDCD5 likely plays a critical role in multiple
tissues during tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the function of PDCD5 during cell
growth, proliferation and apoptosis remain largely unclear.
Previous experiments have demonstrated that PDCD5 is apparently upregulated in cells following apoptotic
stimulation (28), enhances caspase-3 activity by modulating Bax translation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial
membrane (11), interacts with Tip60 to enhance histone acetylation and p53 acetylation at Lys120, and promotes
the expression of Bax (53). Recently, novel evidence indicated that PDCD5 is a p53 regulator during gene expression
and the cell cycle (54). It was shown that PDCD5 interacts with the p53 pathway by inhibiting the Mdm2-mediated
ubiquitination and nuclear exportation of p53 and that knockdown of PDCD5 can decrease the ubiquitination level
of Mdm2 and attenuate the expression and transcription of p21. Hence, upon DNA damage, PDCD5 can function
as a co-activator of p53 to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Many computational models have been constructed to investigate the mechanism of the p53-mediated cell-fate
decision (5, 6, 16, 20, 29, 31, 32, 48, 49, 59–62). In these models, the p53/Mdm2 oscillation is highlighted as
important to the cell-fate decision following DNA damage. Integrated models of the p53 signaling network have
been established to study the process of cell fate decision in response to DNA damage (59–62). These models
advance the understanding of the dynamics and functions of the p53 pathway in the DNA damage response. In
(59), it has been suggested that the decision between the cell fates of survival and death might be determined by
counting the number of p53 pulses. In (61), the two feedback loops of ATM-p53-Wip1 and p53-PTEN-Akt-Mdm2
are combined in the p53 signaling network. A two-phase p53 response has been shown in this model; pulses occur
during DNA repair and are sustained at a high level that triggers apoptosis if the damage cannot be fixed after a
crucial number of p53 pulses. Furthermore, dynamical analysis has shown that the ATM-p53-Wip1 loop is essential
for the generation of the p53 pulses and that the PTEN level determines whether p53 acts as a pulse generator
or a switch. Despite extensive studies of the p53 pathway, little work has been focused on modeling the PDCD5
interactions. The first model of PDCD5-regulated DNA damage decisions was established by (63). Two known
pathways were considered in this model: the interaction of PDCD5 with Tip60 in the nucleus, and the regulation
of Bax translocation in the cytoplasm. This model revealed that the cytoplasmic pathway plays an important role

PDCD5 interacts with the p53 pathway

in PDCD5-regulated cell apoptosis (63). However, how PDCD5 interactions with the p53 pathway affect cell fate
decision has not been considered in previous models.
Motived by the above considerations, we constructed a mathematical model of the p53 signaling network with
PDCD5 interactions in the present study to examine the effects of PDCD5 on p53-mediated cell fate decisions in
response to DNA damage. The main results of this study suggest that PDCD5 can function as a co-activator of
p53 to regulate p53-dependent cell fate decisions by mediating the dynamics of p53. The effects of PDCD5 are dose
dependent, and various cell fates can occur for cells with different PDCD5 levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model description
Our model was based on p53 responses to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation (IR) (59, 61) and PDCD5
interactions with the p53 pathway (54) (Figure 1). In the model, the cell fate decision following DNA damage
is mediated by p53 pulses through the p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and PDCD5 interacts with p53 and functions as a
positive regulator in the p53 pathway.
An integrated model with four modules for the p53 signaling network has been developed by (59, 61). This
model includes the following processes: DNA repair, ATM switch, p53-Mdm2 oscillation, and cell fate decision.
When a cell is exposed to IR, a certain number of DSBs are generated in the cell and induce the formation of DSB
repair-protein complexes (DSBCs), and the repair process ensues. Subsequently, DSBCs promote the conversion of
inactive ATM monomers to active forms (4) such that active ATM (ATM∗ ) becomes dominant after exposure to
IR.
After the activation of ATM, the p53 level exhibits a series of pulses due to the feedback loops in the p53-Mdm2
oscillator. The protein p53 and its negative regulator Mdm2 are the core proteins in this oscillator (Figure 1a). In
the nucleus, p53 is activated by ATM∗ in two ways. First, ATM∗ promotes the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 (37)
and accelerates the degradation of Mdm2 through phosphorylation (46). Thus, ATM∗ induces a conversion of p53
from the inactive state to the active state (p53∗ ) (46). Second, p53∗ is deactivated at a basal rate. Here, only p53∗
can induce the production of Mdm2cyt , which in turn promotes the translation of p53 mRNA in the cytoplasm (57).
In undamaged cells, p53 levels are kept low by Mdm2 through the negative-feedback between p53∗ and Mdm2nut .
After damage, the p53-Mdm2 complex is dissociated due to activation of p53 by ATM∗ , and the levels of p53∗ and
Mdm2cyt increase abruptly through the positive feedback between p53∗ and Mdm2cyt .
In the cell fate decision module, p53 coordinates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to govern cell fate through the
phosphorylation of p53 at distinct sites (Figure 1b). The primary phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 leads to cell cycle
arrest, whereas the further phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-46 promotes expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as
p53AIP1 (34). The above two forms of phosphorylated p53 are termed p53 arrester and p53 killer, respectively (59).
There are three feedback loops involved in the conversion between p53 arrester and p53 killer. The p53 arresterinducible gene Wip1 can promote the reversion of p53 killer to p53 arrester (15), while the gene p53DINP1, which
is induced by both p53 arrester and p53 killer, contributes to the formation of p53 killer (35). p53 arrester induces
cell cycle arrest through the transcriptional activation of p21, and p53 killer promotes cell death via pro-apoptotic
genes such as p53AIP1. The over-expression of p53AIP1 induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
and apoptosis rapidly ensues after the activation of caspase-3. A positive-feedback loop between cytochrome c and
caspase-3 (3, 21) underlies the apoptotic switch in the model developed by (59).

The PDCD5 protein is weakly expressed in unstressed conditions, and is upregulated in cells upon apoptotic
simulation (28). Following the onset of an apoptotic stimulus, the cytoplasmic PDCD5 protein level first increases
rapidly and forms an inward gradient from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (12, 28, 53). This pattern is maintained
for a few hours until the initiation of apoptosis, which is paralleled by a rapid translocation of PDCD5 protein from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus (12). Hence, after DNA damage, nuclear PDCD5 is maintained at an intermediate
level during the DNA repair process.
PDCD5 has been found to up-regulate p53 activity through at least two interactions (54). When U2OS cells
were transfected with either control or PDCD5-specific siRNA, p53 protein levels decreased following the knockdown of PDCD5. Simultaneously, the knockdown of PDCD5 failed to influence the levels of p53 mRNA levels,
which suggests that PDCD5 enhances the stability of p53 and does not regulate p53 at the transcriptional level
(54). Co-localization analysis in U2OS cells further revealed that PDCD5 co-localizes with p53 in the nucleus.
Furthermore, NMR experiments indicated that PDCD5 can bind with the N-terminal domain of p53 (p5315−61 )
(56), which overlaps with the binding site between p53 (p5315−29 ) and Mdm2 (43). When p53 was incubated with
whole lysates of HeLa cells that overexpressed Mdm2, p53 strongly bound to Mdm2, but this interaction between
p53 and Mdm2 decreased significantly in the presence of recombinant human PDCD5. Moreover, PDCD5 can be
pulled down with p53. These results suggest that PDCD5 might disrupt the p53-Mdm2 interaction via the direct
interaction between p53 and PDCD5 (54), which is consistent with the results of the NMR study (56). Interestingly,
PDCD5 has been found to be capable of dose-dependently decreasing the protein level of Mdm2. Knockdown of
endogenous PDCD5 could increase the accumulation of Mdm2 and decrease the ubiquitination level of Mdm2 (54).
Hence, PDCD5 dissociates the p53-Mdm2 complex promotes Mdm2 degradation. These interactions are shown with
red lines in Figure 1a.
At the cell fate decision module, PDCD5 in the nucleus interacts with Tip60 to promote the Tip60-induced
Lys120 acetylation of p53 (the killer form of p53) (53). In the cytoplasm, PDCD5 promotes the translocation of
Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce the release of cytochrome c (11). ChIP assays
in U2OS cells have shown that PDCD5 might associate with the p21 promoter to promote transcription activation
after DNA damage (54). Knockdown of PDCD5 attenuates the expression and transcription of p21 (54). Hence,
PDCD5 in the nucleus increases the transition from p53 arrester to p53 killer and promotes the transcription of
p21, and PDCD5 in the cytoplasm up-regulates Bax translocation to increase cytochrome c release (Figure 1b).
Based on the model simulation reported by (59), active ATM is dominant following IR and the level of
ATM∗ remains mostly constant during the DNA repair process. Hence, in our model, the four modules of the
model of (59) were simplified to include only the two modules of the p53-Mdm2 oscillator and the cell fate decision,
and the levels of ATM∗ and nuclear PDCD5 were represented by time dependent functions to mimic the DNA
repair process. This simplification is acceptable in the current study because we intended to investigate the effects
of PDCD5 on p53 dynamics after DNA damage. For a more complete understanding of the effect of PDCD5 on
cell fate decisions following DNA damage, an integrated model that incorporates PDCD5 dynamics (63) and the
responses of the p53 pathway (58, 59) is certainly required and will be the subject of further studies.

Formulations
In the formulations, we first simplified the models presented in (58, 59) to a six differentiation equations for the
modules of the p53-Mdm2 oscillator and cell fate decision, and a time-dependent ATM∗ level was introduced for the
DNA repair process.
In the p53-Mdm2 oscillator, inactive p53 in the nucleus is degraded rapidly by Mdm2 and was thus assumed to
be at quasi-equilibrium in our model. Hence, three components were included in the p53-Mdm2 oscillator: active
p53 in the nucleus [p53], Mdm2 in the nucleus [Mdm2nuc ], and Mdm2 in the cytoplasm [Mdm2cyt ]. Active p53
promotes the production of Mdm2cyt , which promotes the translation of p53 mRNA to produce p53 to form a
positive-feedback loop. In the nucleus, active p53 is degraded slowly by weakly binding to Mdm2nuc , and the interaction is disrupted by PDCD5. Mdm2 in the nucleus and cytoplasm can be shuttled between the two compartments
at different rates. The degradation of Mdm2nuc is promoted by both ATM∗ and PDCD5. These interactions resulted
in differential equations (1)-(3), which are given in the Supporting Material.
In the cell fate decision module, there are two forms of active p53: p53 arrester and p53 killer. p53 arrester
and p53 killer transform into each other at different rates that are regulated by their inducible genes Wip1 and
p53DINP1. PDCD5 in the nucleus can increase the transition from p53 arrester to p53 killer. p53 killer induces
apoptosis through the killer-inducible gene p53AIP1, which up-regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene

Bax. PDCD5 in the cytoplasm enhances Bax translocation and promotes the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria and hence the activation of caspase-3. In our model, we omitted components for the proteins Wip1,
p53DINP1, and p53AIP1 and considered the dynamics of p53 killer [killer] (the p53 arrester concentration is given
by [arrester] = [p53] − [killer]), cytochrome c [CytoC] and active caspase-3 [C3]. This process resulted in equations
(4)-(6) in the Supporting Material. Here we note that the downstream signal p21 transcription was omitted.
The intensities of ATM∗ and PDCD5 were included in the model through their incorporation in the equation
coefficients (refer to the Supporting Material, Section 1.6). This study intended to study p53 dynamics during DNA
repair while both ATM∗ and PDCD5 remained at high levels (59, 63). Hence, the ATM∗ and PDCD5 levels were
described by the predefined functions A(t) and P (t) given by equation (20)-(21) in the Supporting Material. The
parameter P0 was introduced for the different PDCD5 levels with P0 = 0.8 for the wild-type cells and P0 = 0.2 for
the siPDCD5 cells. Despite this specificity, extensive simulations showed that the results of the current study were
insensitive to different mathematical formulations of these two functions.
Now, the original integrated model of cell fate decision mediated by p53 pulses has been simplified to the above
model with six differential equations. With this simplification, all parameters were adjusted to reproduce the p53
pluses utilized by (58, 59), and the PDCD5 interaction parameters were estimated based on experimental results
regarding the degradation of p53 with or without PDCD5 (54). Details of the parameter values are given in Table
1 in the Supporting Material.
Numerical methods
In the numerical simulations, the model equations were solved numerically using NDSolve on the Mathematica 8.0
platform (52).
RESULTS
PDCD5 regulates p53 dynamics in a dose-dependent manner
Signaling dynamics are known to encode and decode cellular informations that controls cellular responses (38). p53
dynamics can control cell fate decision in response to DSBs, and cells that experience p53 pulses recover from DNA
damage, whereas cells that are exposed to sustained p53 signaling frequently undergo senescence (39). To examine
how PDCD5 regulates the dynamics and functions of p53, we performed simulations with various PDCD5 levels.
The integrated model showed that cell fate was governed by the number of p53 pulses during DNA repair (59). In
our simulations, there were seven p53 pulses when the DNA repair process required tc = 48h and apoptosis was
induced by obvious increases in caspase-3 levels. When the DNA process is shortened to tc = 30h, there are four
p53 pulses and the cells recover to normal growth, while caspase-3 is maintained at a low level (Figure 2a). These
results reproduced the p53 dynamics and cell fate decision obtained from the integrated model of (59); therefore,
our model simplification is capable of investigating the effects of PDCD5 on p53 dynamics.
To examine the effects of PDCD5 on p53 dynamics, we fixed the DNA repair process at tc = 48h and varied
the PDCD5 level to examine the cell response. Increasing P0 elicited no changes in cell fate (data not shown),
and reducing the PDCD5 level might lead to various p53 dynamics and cell fate (Figure 2b). When P0 = 0.4,
there are six p53 pulses during DNA repair and caspase-3 is maintained at low levels so that the cells recover to
normal growth. The p53 pulses are repressed if P0 is further reduced. When P0 = 0.3, the cells exhibit sustained
p53 signaling and caspase-3 increases to levels as high as those observed when P0 = 0.8. When P0 is reduced to
0.2, the p53 level is attenuated and fails to induce cell apoptosis. These results suggest that p53 dynamics and cell
fate can be modulated by PDCD5 in a dose-dependent manner. Here we note that when P0 = 0.3, the caspase-3
reaches levels as high as those in the wild-type cells (P0 = 0.8). However, at this point we cannot conclude that the
cells undergo apoptosis (1) because some other response pathways not included in the current study, such as cell
senescence, can be triggered by sustained p53. In (39), it was suggested that a proper stimulus with Nutlin-3 can
induce sustained p53. Our simulations predict that a proper dose of PDCD5 can also result in sustained p53 after
DNA damage. This prediction requires experimental confirmation.
To further investigate the effects of PDCD5 on p53 dynamics, we altered P0 over the wider range of 0 to 1.
There is a threshold of P0 = 0.33 that corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation of the p53 oscillator module (dashed line
in Figure 3) such that p53 is sustained when P0 is less than the threshold and p53 is pulsed when P0 is above the
threshold. In both regions of either sustained or pulsed p53, caspase-3 is activated when P0 is relatively large (shadows in Figure 3) but with different mechanisms. In the sustained region, during DNA repair, the p53 level increases

with PDCD5 to induce caspase-3 activation through saddle node bifurcation; however, in the pulsed region, p53
oscillates while the mean value is nearly unchanged with the PDCD5 level, and hence, caspase-3 is activated by an
alternative mechanism (see Figure 3 upper panel, to be detailed below). In the pulsed region, the period decreases
with P0 such that the pulse number increases from 4 to 7 when P0 varies from 0.33 to 1, and the amplitude slightly
increases with P0 (Figure 3, bottom panel). We note that caspase-3 is either active or not when there are 7 pulses,
which indicates that the p53 pulse number alone is insufficient to determine cell fate. These results suggest that
PDCD5 regulates the p53 dynamics with different mechanisms in the p53 sustained and pulsed regions that are
separated by a Hopf bifurcation of the p53 oscillator module.
PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation by two mechanisms
To investigate the mechanism by which PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation, we considered the cell fate decision
module, which can be described by the dynamics of cytochrome c and caspase-3 given by equations (22)-(23) in
the Supporting Material. The caspase-3 dynamics are controlled by the cytochrome c release rate v0 , which is

dependent on PDCD5 and p53 killer. We performed bifurcation analysis for the equations to seek the mechanisms
by which PDCD5 induces caspase-3 activation.
In the case of sustained p53, the rate v0 is a constant such that the cell fate module exhibits either bistability
for small v0 or monostability for larger v0 (Figure 4a). The saddle node bifurcation defines a critical release rate
(red point at Figure 4a) such that when v0 increases above the critical rate, the low-caspase-3 state vanishes and
the system switches to the state of caspase-3 activation. This critical rate defines a critical curve of p53 versus P0
through equation (21) in the Supporting Material as shown by the red dashed line in Figure 4b. To test whether
PDCD5 induces caspase-3 activation during sustained p53 through saddle note bifurcation, we superpose this critical curve with the dependence of the mean p53 on P0 (Figure 3). The two curves meet at a point at which P0 is
at the critical value for inducing caspase-3 activation (Figure 4b). This consistence indicates that PDCD5 induces
caspase-3 through saddle node bifurcation in the region of sustained p53.

the two solutions shown in (c). The inset enlarges the square region.

When p53 is pulsed, equations (22)-(23) in the Supporting Material are time-dependent and have periodic
coefficients. In this case, caspase-3 is not always active even when the mean p53 level is above the critical value
(Figure 4b). Hence, some other mechanism must be at work to induce caspase-3 activation with increases in the
PDCD5 level P0 . In the absence of DNA damaging stimuli, the caspase-3 dynamic system has two stable steady
states of survival and apoptosis (Figure 4c). The two stable states are separated by stable manifolds of an unstable
steady state (red curve in Figure 4c). After DNA damage, starting from the survival state, a cell transitions to the
apoptotic state with an increase in the amount of cytochrome c released and a rapid caspase-3 activation (Figure
4c). The simulations showed that the final cell fate is determined by whether the solution trajectory shown by
Figure 4c crosses the boundary between the survival and apoptosis regions. During DNA repair, p53 is oscillating
and switching between pro-apoptosis and pro-survival (Figure 4a) such that the released cytochrome c accumulates
at each p53 pulse. Simulations showed that PDCD5 can increase the accumulation of cytochrome c and hence
induce caspase-3 activation by promoting the solution trajectory to cross the boundary curve during DNA repair
(Figure 4d). These results indicate that PDCD5 promotes cell apoptosis (caspase-3 activation) as a co-activator of
p53 that accelerates cytochrome c release during the region of pulsed p53. This observation highlights the crucial
role of PDCD5 in the cytoplasm and is in agreement with our previous study (63).

Casp3 activation (h)

The above analyses indicated that PDCD5 promotes caspase-3 activation by accelerating cytochrome c release.
Consequently, the time of caspase-3 activation should decrease with increases in PDCD5 levels. This notion was
confirmed by our simulations as shown by Figure 5a. Next, we asked whether the PDCD5 level required to induce
apoptosis is related to the duration of DNA repair. We changed both the DNA repair duration tc and P0 to examine
cell responses. The simulations showed that caspase-3 activation is induced only when the DNA repair duration
is sufficiently large (tc > 29h in this study). When tc is sufficiently large, the critical PDCD5 level P0 required ot
induce caspase-3 activation decreases with increases in tc in both regions of sustained and pulsed p53 (Figure 5b).
We note that the boundary value of P0 at which p53 transits from sustained to pulsed dynamics is independent
of tc (Figure 5b dashed line). This P0 value is determined by the Hopf bifurcation of the p53/Mdm2 oscillation
module.

The cytoplasm pathway and the regulation of Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation are the primary effects of PDCD5
on the cell fate decision
PDCD5 interacts with the p53 pathway in multiple ways; it stabilizes p53 by disrupting the p53-MDM2 interaction,
enhances Mdm2 degradation, and promotes the Tip60-induced Lys120 acetylation of p53. In the cytoplasm, PDCD5
enhances Bax translocation and promotes the release of cytochrome c. PDCD5 regulates the cell fate decision via
the combination of these multi-site interactions. To investigate which role is the most essential for the regulatory
function of PDCD5, we altered the strengths of each interaction and examined the DNA repair time required to
induce cell apoptosis. Four parameters were considered: α1 for PDCD5 disrupting the p53-MDM2 interaction, K4
for enhancing the Mdm2 regulation, K9 for promoting the p53 killer transformation, and α2 for the cytoplasm pathway (Figure 6). The results revealed that cell fate is sensitive to changes in α2 , i.e., the PDCD5 interactions with
the cytoplasm pathway. Among the functions of PDCD5 in the p53 pathway, changes in the strength with which
PDCD5 disrupts the p53-Mdm2 interaction (α1 ) result the greatest changes in the DNA repair duration required
to induce apoptosis. These results show that the cytoplasm pathway is essential for the regulatory function of
PDCD5, which agrees with previous studies (63), and the PDCD5-regulated disruption of the Mdm2-mediated
p53 degradation is important among the interactions of PDCD5 with the p53 pathway. These observations provide
poptential options for killing cancer cells in clinical treatments, which are discussed below.
Effects of PDCD5 disrupting Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation
PDCD5 disrupts Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation via a direct interaction with p53 (54, 56). Biologically, the
parameter value α1 is adjustable if we can modify the binding affinity between PDCD5 and p53 via methods such
as single molecule engineering. To further explore how various affinities (α1 ) affect the cell fate decision, we varied
α1 and P0 to examine the p53 dynamics and caspase-3 activity (Figure 7a). The results revealed that caspase-3 was

activated only when α1 P0 > 0.7, and that the two parameter regions with either sustained p53 or pulsed p53 were
separated by the curve α1 P0 = 1.1. For small α1 values (α1 < 1.7), pulsed p53 always yielded caspase-3 activity;
however, when α1 was large, pulsed p53 did not necessarily imply caspase-3 activity when P0 was not sufficiently
large (see Figure 2b).

by the red curve. (b) Apoptosis probabilities obtained from mutlicell simulations with varying P0 and different α1
values. Here, tc = 48h in all simulations.
To further investigate the cellular apoptosis probability, we applied the method of multicell simulation(63) to
simulate a group of 104 cells each of which had parameters that were randomly chosen from a range of ±20%
away from their default values. The cell fate of apoptosis was marked by caspase-3 activation, and the fraction of
apoptotic cells provided the apoptosis probability. Figure 7b shows the apoptosis probabilities with P0 from 0 to
1 and strong and weak affinity α1 values. The results suggested that when PDCD5 is low, the significant increase
in the expression of α1 can significantly enhance cell apoptosis. We note that when P0 takes an intermediate value
(P0 ≈ 0.5, arrow at Figure 7b), increasing α1 tends to decrease the probability of apoptosis. This counterintuitive
result was due to the possibility that a cell can display pulsed p53 without activation of caspase-3. These results
provide possible directions for interfering with the binding affinity of PDCD5 and p53 to modulate cell fate decisions
in clinical treatments.
DISCUSSION
PDCD5 is known to interact with p53 and functions as a regulator in the p53 pathway during responses to DNA
damage. In the present study, we constructed a mathematical model of the p53 signaling network with the interactions of PDCD5. The model was based on the integrated model of the p53 signaling network that was previously
proposed (59, 62), and the interactions of PDCD5 with the p53/Mdm2 oscillator and cell fate decision were included
in accordance with recent observations (54). The computational model consisted of two p53/Mdm2 oscillator and
cell fate decision modules. The DNA repair process was represented by increases in active ATM and PDCD5 concentrations, both of which were given by pre-defined time-dependent functions and were incorporated into the
equation coefficients.
The model simulations showed that PDCD5 can modulate the cell fate decision by mediating p53 dynamics in a
dose-dependent manner such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics in cells with different levels
of PDCD5. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two mechanisms that operate in the two regions

of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics. We found that the cell fate decision is sensitive to the cytoplasm pathway
of PDCD5, which agrees with the results of our previous studies (63). Moreover, the PDCD5-regulated disruption
of Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation is also important for the interaction of PDCD5 with the p53 pathway, which
suggests that it is possible to modulate cell fate decision via interference in the binding affinity between PDCD5
and p53.
This study sought to investigate the effects of PDCD5 on p53 dynamics following DNA damage. A more comprehensive analysis of p53-Mdm2 dynamics has recently been provided by (7). For a more complete understanding
of how PDCD5 functions to regulate DNA repair and apoptosis following DNA damage, the PDCD5 dynamics (63)
and the p53 pathway response need to be incorporated (59, 62). These results are certainly important for additional studies that seek to improve our understanding of how recombinant human PDCD5 can be used in cancer
treatment.
