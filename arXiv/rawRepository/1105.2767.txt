if we have a sero-incident cohort with a short
follow up time and if we can measure the number
of infection events in each stage.8 Both methods
require a sero-incident cohort and repeated
measurements of the viral load. Cohort data are
always difficult to obtain and cohorts of discordant
couples will become increasingly biased with time
as those that are most likely to infect their partners
do so and are removed from the cohort.
Nevertheless, these are the data that we have.

Abstract
At present, the best hope for eliminating HIV
transmission and bringing the epidemic of HIV to
an end lies in the use of anti-retroviral therapy for
prevention, a strategy referred to variously as Test
and Treat (T&T), Treatment as Prevention (TasP)
or Treatment centred Prevention (TcP). One of the
key objections to the use of T&T to stop
transmission concerns the role of the acute phase in
HIV transmission. The acute phase of infection
lasts for one to three months after HIVseroconversion during which time the risk of
transmission may be ten to twenty times higher, per
sexual encounter, than it is during the chronic phase
which lasts for the next ten years. Regular testing
for HIV is more likely to miss people who are in
the acute phase than in the chronic phase and it is
essential to determine the extent to which this
might compromise the impact of T&T on HIVtransmission.
Here we show that 1) provided the initial
epidemic doubling time is about 1.0 to 1.5 years, as
observed in South Africa, random testing with an
average test interval of one year will still bring the
epidemic close to elimination even if the acute
phase lasts for 3 months during which time
transmission is 26 times higher than in the chronic
phase; 2) testing people regularly at yearly intervals
is significantly more effective then testing them
randomly; 3) testing people regularly at six monthly
intervals and starting them on ART immediately,
will almost certainly guarantee elimination.
In general it seems unlikely that elevated
transmission during the acute phase is likely to
change predictions of the impact of treatment on
transmission significantly. Other factors, in
particular age structure, the structure of sexual
networks and variation in set-point viral load are
likely to be more important and should be given
priority in further analyses.

Indirect estimates
We first ask: how does viral load vary from initial
infection through sero-conversion and the acute
phase to the chronic phase and eventually to the
final phase shortly before death? The most useful
data in this regard, based on two sets of archived
samples from HIV infected plasma donors, are
from Fiebig et al.7 Figure 1 shows the observed
median values of viral load as a function of time
since infection.7 The fitted (green) line is
V = N {l (t |α1, δ1 ) × [ β + (1 − β )l (t |−α 2 , δ 2 ) ] } 1

Introduction
We can estimate the relative risk of infection during
the acute and chronic stages of infection in two
ways. We can estimate it indirectly if we have data
on the viral load in the acute and chronic stages and
data on the probability of a transmission event as a
function of viral load.1-6 We can estimate it directly

In Equation 2, N scales overall transmission up
or down, the first logistic function l in the curly
brackets increases with time at a rate α1 reaching
half the maximum value at time δ1, the second
decreases with time at a rate α2 reaching half the

maximum value at time δ2. β is the asymptotic
value to which the viral load converges during the
chronic phase. In short, the viral load increases at a
rate α1 to a peak value from which it converges
downwards at a rate α2 to an asymptote at β. The
median value of the log10(viral load) during the
chronic phase is 4.09 ± 0.31 and at the peak of the
acute phase is 5.45 ± 0.15. The acute phase lasts
from day 8 to day 70 after sero-conversion so that
the duration of the acute phase, DAP = 62 days,
during which time the average value of the median
viral load is 4.73 ± 0.02 for an average increase of
0.7 logs or a factor of 100.7 = 5.0 (3.2−7.9) over the
value during the chronic stage of infection.

T = αρV so that the probability of infection per
virion per mm3 is αρ, transmission saturates at α
transmissions per year and we can define V*, the
viral load time at which transmission saturates, as
the intercept of the initial linear increase with the
asymptotic value so that
V* = 1 .

The fits in Figure 2 give the values in Table 1.
Allowing for the small amount of over-dispersion
in the estimates we see that for low viral loads the
probability
of
infection
is
2.42×10−6
(1.14×10−6−5.13×10−6) times the viral load per
mm3 and at high viral loads transmission saturates
when the viral load is 4.37±0.29 logs.
We can now estimate the probability of
transmission at the peak of the acute phase, when
the log10 (median viral load) is 5.45, and in the
chronic phase, when the log10 (median viral load),
using each of the three data sets. The ratio of the
pairs of estimates gives RR, the relative risk of
infection, per unit time, in the acute and the chronic
phase as RR = 2.1 (1.1−3.9).

Direct estimates
The most widely cited direct estimates of the
relative transmission in the acute and chronic stages
of HIV-infection are based on the Uganda study of
Wawer et al.8 The most reliable data, in this regard,
are those from the incidence cohort in which there
were 10 transmission events among 23 couples who
had 1221 coital acts in the first six months after
seroconversion and 2 transmission events among
the remaining 13 couples who had 1313 coital acts
in months 6 to 15 after seroconversion. This gives a
relative risk of transmission RR = 3.4 (0.7−17.6).
Wawer et al.8 give an unadjusted estimate of the RR
of transmission, comparing the acute phase to the
‘prevalent’ cases, of 8.25 (3.37–20.22) but since the
risk of transmission in ‘prevalent’ cases is close to
half of the risk in incident cases 6 to 15 months
after sero-conversion, their estimate of the RR,
using those in the incidence cohort who were
infected 6 to 15 months after sero-conversion,
would be 4.1 (1.6−10.1). This is still significantly
higher than the indirect estimate given above,

Figure 2. HIV transmission probability per year as a
function of viral load. A: Attia et al.;1 B: Donnell et al.;3
C: Lingappa et al.6 Significance levels for the fitted lines
are A: 0.778; B: 0.376; C: 0.110. If we assume a power
law relationship between transmission and viral load the
significance levels for the best fit curves are A: 0.0006;
B: 0.302; C: 0.309.

There are three sets of data on the risk of
infection per unit time as a function of viral load1,3,6
(Figure 2). The simplest model of the relationship
between viral load and transmission assumes that
the former increases linearly with the latter (but see
also Appendix 1). However, the data suggest that
transmission saturates at high viral load and we
therefore assume a relationship of the following
form:

(

T = α 1 − e− ρV

)

where T is the probability of transmission per year.
At low viral loads transmission increases linearly as

especially since the Wawer et al.8 estimate is
averaged over six months while the estimate made
here is averaged over two months. In order to
favour the importance of the acute phase on the
epidemic we will use the high estimate from
Wawer et al.8
Now, consider a cohort of newly infected
people. Viral load varies considerably among
people infected with HIV. From data on the
distribution of viral load in a cross-sectional study
from Orange Farm, South Africa12 (Bertran Auvert,
load)
personal
communication)
log10(viral
measurements range from 2 to 6 corresponding to a
range in the risk of transmission of 100 to 1000
times. Allowing for the fact that those with the
highest viral load will infect their partners and die
more quickly,9 removing them from the pool of
sero-discordant couples, the rate of transmissions
will fall by about 50% after five years as shown in
Figure 4 and observed by Wawer et al.8 (See
Appendix 2 for details.)

for the purposes of this analysis, we will use the
high estimate from Hollingsworth et al.10
The estimates of DAP and RR that we will use in
this analysis are given in Table 2.

We now wish to explore the consequences for the
different estimates of the acute phase duration and
the relative infectiousness of the acute phase on the
impact of T&T on transmission. The key point is
this: one of the few directly observed parameters
concerning the epidemiology of HIV is the initial
doubling time which, in South Africa, is 1.25 ±
0.25.11 Since the acute phase lasts for considerably
less time than the chronic phase, the greater the
relative risk of transmission in the acute phase the
smaller must be the value of R0 to maintain the
same initial doubling time. Indeed, if we know the
initial doubling time (the growth rate r in Equations
11 and 13 in Appendix 3) and we know the relative
risk of infection in the acute phase and each of the
four chronic phases (βi/β0 in Equations 7 to 9 in
Appendix 3) and the duration of each of the four
stages (1/ρi in Equations 7 to 9 and 10) in
Appendix 3, then we can determine the values of
the each of the individual ρi and hence the value of
R0 (Equation 10 in Appendix 3).
Values of R0, as a function of the relative risk of
transmission during the acute phase and the
duration of the acute phase in months, are given in
Figure 4A. Without ART the value of R0 is 5.8
(brown rectangle). With RR = 2.1 and DAP = 2 mo.
(green ellipse) R0 falls to 5.4. With RR = 8.3 and
DAP = 6 mo. (red ellipse) R0 falls to 3.0. With RR =
26 and DAP = 6 mo. (blue ellipse) R0 falls to 2.3.
As expected the higher the rate of transmission
during the acute phase the lower the value of R0.
The boundaries of the ellipses indicate the
uncertainty in the point estimates which are
considerable. Assuming, as noted above, that in the
Hollingsworth et al.10 study the high values of DAP
correspond to low values RR, and vice versa, we
slant the corresponding confidence ellipse at an
appropriate angle. This also serves to show that if
we let DAP = 6 mo. The Hollingsworth et al.10 and
the Wawer et al.8 estimates are not significantly
different.

Figure 3. Variation of infectiousness as a function of time
since infection in a cohort of people. No allowance is
made for increased infectiousness during the acute phase
but it is assumed that both infectiousness and mortality
are highest in those with a high set-point viral load.

Hollingsworth et al.,10 using the data provided
by Wawer et al.,8 use a modelling approach to
determine the relative risk of transmission during
the acute and chronic phases. Their estimate of the
duration of the acute phase is DAP = 2.9 (1.2−6.0)
months with RR = 26.2 (12.5−53.5). At the limits
we can assume that the short estimate of DAP
corresponds to the high value of RR while the long
estimate of DAP corresponds to a low value of RR.
Assuming that their comparison is with the seroprevalent couples one might again reduce the
relative risk by a factor of about 2. An inevitable
consequence of these estimates is that R0 must be
close to 1 and indeed Hollingsworth et al.10 give an
estimate of 2.2 under random mixing. If this were
the case HIV should be much less stable than it is
observed to be and small improvements in
prevention should have a substantial impact on the
epidemic which is not seen to be the case. Again,

Figure 4B shows what happens if people are
tested randomly but once a year on average. With
RR = 1, the value of R0 falls to 0.58 (brown
rectangle). With RR = 2.1 and DAP = 2 mo. R0 falls
to 0.61. With RR = 8.3 and DAP = 6 mo. R0 falls to
0.84 and with RR = 26 and DAP = 3 mo. R0 falls to
0.90. In all three cases R0 still falls below 1
although with the two higher estimates of RR it is
only 10% to 20% below 1 which allows little
margin of error.
Figure 4C shows what happens if the average
testing interval is reduced to six months. With RR =
1, R0 falls to 0.29 (brown rectangle). With RR = 2.1
and DAP = 2 mo. R0 falls to 0.34. With RR = 8.3
and DAP = 6 mo. R0 falls to 0.61 and with RR = 26
and DAP = 3 mo. R0 falls to 0.75. Even in the worst
case (RR = 26, DAP = 3 mo.) R0 is significantly
less than 1.
Figure 4D shows what happens if people are
tested regularly once a year. With RR = 1, the value
of R0 again falls to 0.29 (brown rectangle). With RR
= 2.1 and DAP = 2 mo. R0 falls to 0.38. With RR =
8.3 and DAP = 6 mo. R0 falls to 0.70 and with RR =
26 and DAP = 3 mo. R0 falls to 0.82. Again, even
in the worst case (RR = 26, DAP = 3 mo.) R0 is
significantly less than 1.
Figure 4E shows what happens if people are
tested regularly twice a year. With RR = 1, R0 falls
to 0.14 (brown rectangle). With RR = 2.1 and DAP
= 2 mo. R0 falls to 0.21. With RR = 8.3 and DAP = 6
mo. R0 falls to 0.45 and with RR = 26 and DAP = 3
mo. R0 falls to 0.68. Even in the worst case (RR =
26, DAP = 3 mo.) R0 is again significantly less than
1.

in the long term. Testing people regularly, on an
annual basis, is considerably more effective than
random testing because under random testing some
people will be tested very frequently, which is not
necessary, while others will be tested very
infrequently which is not ideal. With regular testing
even the most pessimistic view reduces R0 to 0.82
and will probably lead to elimination. As expected,
testing people twice a year reduces R0 even further
and under all assumptions about the acute phase
would guarantee elimination.
However, this analysis raises a possibility that
may be even more important than considerations of
high rates of infection during the acute phase. We
know that the set point values of the viral load vary
by several orders of magnitude. In the Fiebig7 study
the log10(viral load) varies from about 2.6 to 5.6 in
the chronic stage.
The data in Figure 4 suggest that variation in the
average viral load in a cohort of people, as a
function of time since infection, is likely to have a
greater influence on the model predictions than any
difference between acute and chronic phase
transmission. However, there are two reasons why
this is more difficult to allow for. First of all the
result shown in Figure 4 assumes a relationship
between survival and set-point viral load based on
only one small study and better data are needed if
this is to be made the basis for modelling the
epidemic. Secondly, including this variation would
probably need a model that includes the distribution
of set-point viral loads explicitly and the structure
of the models that are currently used does not allow
for this. If this were to be explored further, the first
priority would be to consider models in which the
variation in the set-point viral load is included
explicitly and comparisons made with a model in
which this variation is set to zero.
We conclude, therefore, that increased
transmission during the acute phase is unlikely to
change the model predictions significantly for
several reasons:
1. The acute phase duration is more likely to be of
the order of one or two months or about 1% to
2% of the total disease duration.
2. If transmission during the acute phase is
sufficiently high for transmission during this
short time to be important, then R0 must be
correspondingly low and the reduction in R0
needed for elimination is correspondingly less.
3. There is strong evidence that transmission
saturates above a viral load of about 4 to 5 logs
mitigating the impact of even very high viral
loads during the acute phase.
4. A more important limitation of the current
model structures, is that variation in the setpoint viral load is not included and this should
be explored further.

Conclusion
We have three estimates of RR, the relative risk of
infection, and DAP, the duration of the acute phase
ranging from 2.1 over 2 months to 26.2 over 3
months giving values of R0 ranging from 5.8 to 2.3.
The high estimates for RR may well be overestimates. They are both based on the data from
Rakai8 and discordant couple studies in which one
partner is ‘sero-prevalent’ will select against those
couples who are most infectious and therefore no
longer sero-discordant. Furthermore, the high
values of RR with long values of DAP imply values
of R0 ≈ 2 which seems unlikely; if this were the
case HIV should be relatively easy to eliminate
through minor changes in behaviour and the
epidemic should be much less stable.
However, it is clear from this analysis that even
if we adopt the most pessimistic view and assume
the relative risk of infection is 26 times higher
during an acute phase that lasts for 3 months annual
testing and immediate treatment has the potential to
R0 to less than 1 and with any further contribution
to prevention will probably guarantee elimination

Several authors13 have fitted the relationship
between transmission and viral load to a power law
function with the transmission increasing as the
viral load to the power of about 0.3. This implies
that at all viral loads transmission increases more
slowly then linearly so that there is a degree of
saturation in transmission as viral load increases.
However, there is no obvious biological basis for
this although from a statistical point of view it is
not possible to choose between this power law
model and the linear increase to an asymptote
suggested here.

We can now determine the relationship between the
relative risk of infection in each stage and R0 while
constraining the overall growth rate, r, as follows.
We first set the duration of each stage 1/ρi and the
relative infectiousness of each stage βi/β0, for i = 1
to n, and then vary β0 to get the required value of
the initial growth rate r. Using Equation 10 we then
