Abstract. We study how modularity of the human brain changes as children
develop into adults. Theory suggests that modularity can enhance the response
function of a networked system subject to changing external stimuli. Thus, greater
cognitive performance might be achieved for more modular neural activity, and
modularity might likely increase as children develop. The value of modularity
calculated from fMRI data is observed to increase during childhood development
and peak in young adulthood. Head motion is deconvolved from the fMRI data,
and it is shown that the dependence of modularity on age is independent of the
magnitude of head motion. A model is presented to illustrate how modularity can
provide greater cognitive performance at short times, i.e. task switching. A fitness
function is extracted from the model. Quasispecies theory is used to predict how
the average modularity evolves with age, illustrating the increase of modularity
during development from children to adults that arises from selection for rapid
cognitive function in young adults. Experiments exploring the effect of modularity
on cognitive performance are suggested. Modularity may be a potential biomarker
for injury, rehabilitation, or disease.

1. Introduction
A modular organization of neural activity can facilitate more rapid cognitive function,
because much of the rewiring of connections required for adaptation is performed
within the modules, which is easier and faster than within the entire network
[1–7]. On the other hand, modularity may restrict possible cognitive function,
because a modular neural architecture is a subset of all possible architectures [3–
6]. Modularity in the neural activity of the human brain has been demonstrated
[8, 9], with activation of neural activity in different parts of the brain observed
by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [10–16]. Remarkably, correlated
neural activity can also be generated from free-streaming, subject-driven, cognitive
states [10]. Models of developing neural activity have shown a self-organization of
modular structure [17].
We here hypothesize that selection for neural responsiveness is strong during
childhood and peaks during young adulthood.
Since modularity increases
responsiveness, we expect that modularity of neural activity in the brain might peak
during adulthood as well. These modules are correlated with physical structure of
the brain [18], but they are not completely hard coded at birth. Cognitive demands
upon the brain promote development of modular neural activity, which empowers
the brain with increased responsiveness and task switching ability.
A dynamic network of neural activity in the brain that can reconfigure its architecture
will converge to a value of the modularity that depends on the pressure upon it [5, 6].
Here we show that modularity of neural activity in the human brain increases from
age 4 and peaks in young adulthood. We use a model to interpret these results,
showing that highly modular neural activity favors rapid, low-level tasks, whereas
less modular neural activity promotes less rapid, effortful, high-level tasks. The
model shows that increased connection between stored memories or faster required
response times for adults versus children can explain the observed development of
modularity in neural activity.
The structure of functional networks constructed from fMRI data is age dependent.
For example, analysis of fMRI data from young adults and old adults shows the
modularity of human brain functional networks decreases with age [6, 13, 19].
Additionally, the architecture of the default network of the brain extracted from fMRI

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

data changes as children develop into adults [20], and working memory performance
has been shown to be related in an age-dependent way with functional networks
[21]. That functional network constructed from fMRI data can be age dependent
was emphasized in a study showing subject age can be estimated from 5 minutes of
fMRI data from individual subjects [22]. These works suggests a clear developmental
and age dependence of the networks constructed from fMRI data. In other work,
connection matrices averaged over ages were constructed and the modularity of
these average matrices was computed, observing no trend of modularity with age
[23]. The lack of observed trend in that study may be due to the construction of
averaged connection matrices, rather than consideration of the connection matrices
constructed from each individual.
Measurements of task switching costs, both mixing and switching, show that young
adults are more efficient than both children and old adults at task switching [24].
We suggest selection for neural task switching peaks during young adulthood, and
that selection for task switching is one mechanism to explain the observed peak of
modularity in neural activity in young adulthood. We demonstrate the cross-task
utility of modularity in a model of memory recall. In other words, in this model, we
show that modularity measured during the task of watching a movie has functional
implications for a task such as memory recall. Previous results show that regions of
interest observed during resting state activity strongly overlap with known functional
regions [10, 18]. Thus, it is likely that the modularity observed during the task of
movie watching has functional implications for other tasks, such as memory recall.
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that modularity of resting-state neural activity is
positively correlated with working memory capacity [25].
A number of studies have reported that children move their heads more than
adults, and that this motion can affect properties computed from the observed fMRI
data. Thus, it has been suggested that calculations should separately account for
head motion and age when drawing conclusions about the effect of development
on correlations of neural activity. In some subject populations, with particular
alignment methods, spurious correlations between the computed network properties
and extent of head motion have been observed [26]. Further work showed that
the underlying age-dependent changes to the spatial dependence of correlations
persist after head motion correction, although the magnitude of the age dependence
decreases [27]. A study using the SPM2 software showed an apparent increase in local

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

connectivity and decrease in large-scale, distributed networks due to head motion
[28]. A study using in-house software showed an effect of head motion on extracted
time series data [29]. A study using FSL showed a negative correlation between
modularity and head motion for motions above 0.07 mm [26]. Since head motion
is negatively correlated with age, these studies caution that artifacts due to head
motion might erroneously be interpreted to predict that modularity is positively
correlated with age. We quantify head motion artifacts, showing that with the
alignment procedure and strict censor cutoff used used in our study, effects of head
motion are negligible after alignment.
In this work, we analyzed patterns of neural activity measured by fMRI for children of
different ages and for young adults watching a movie. We show that a mathematical
definition of modularity, using several different basis sets, leads to the conclusion
that modularity increases from childhood to young adulthood. These results are
consistent with very recent results showing increased within-module connectivity
during development [27]. Theory suggests that highly modular neural activity favors
rapid, low-level tasks, whereas less modular neural activity promotes less rapid,
effortful, high-level tasks [5, 6, 16]. We test the general predictions of this theory
relating modularity to performance and we derive a fitness function for a quasispecies
description of the modularity dynamics. We describe details of the data analysis in
the Methods section. The Results section describes these results. In the Model
section, we introduce a model to show that a more modular neural architecture leads
to more accurate recognition of memory at short times. We also show that a more
modular neural architecture leads to more accurate recognition of memories when
stored memories are more overlapping. This model suggests that overlapping stored
memories or faster required response times for adults versus children are mechanisms
that could explain the observed development of near-resting state modularity in
neural activity. We conclude with experimental and clinical implications in the
Discussion section.

2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
We analyzed fMRI data from 21 adults age 18–26 and 24 children age 4–11 watching
20 minutes of Sesame Street [30]. Image acquisition details are provided in [30].
These data were taken from a set of 27 children (16 female) and 21 adults (13 female).
Three children were excluded due to excessive head motion (> 5 mm), opting-out,
or experimenter error. All children were typically developing. In addition, screening
for neurological abnormalities was performed on all participants [30]. Raw, KBIT-2
overall IQ scores are known for 17 of the children and range from 18.5 to 66 [30].
2.2. Processing of fMRI Data
The two-dimensional fMRI data slices [30] were combined into a three-dimensional
fMRI representation of the neural activity as a function of time, with 2 sec time
resolution and 4 mm spatial resolution. The first six fMRI images of each subject
were discarded to allow the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal to stabilize.
The time series images for each subject were registered to 1 mm resolution, deskulled
anatomical data, which created a normalized image in standard space. The time
series images were then despiked, and the spike values were interpolated using a
non-linear interpolation [31]. The images were then slice time corrected, registered,
scaled into Talarirach brain coordinates [32], motion corrected, bandpass filtered,
and blurred (Cox, 1996). Frame-to-frame motion of a subjects’ head was corrected
by regressing out rigid translations and rotations of the fMRI data and derivatives of
these parameters during the time course. Motion was censored with a threshold of
0.2, i.e. RMSD of 2 mm or 2 degrees based on the Euclidean Norm of the derivative
of the translation and rotation parameters. Outliers were censored with a threshold
of 10%. Due to excessive censoring, 2 of the child and 1 of the adult subject
data were excluded. For the individuals remaining in the study, a small fraction
of the time slices were removed by this censoring, also termed scrubbing, and the
values replaced with values linearly interpolated from neighboring time points. All
calculations were performed with AFNI [31]. The block of analysis code of example
9a in the afni proc.py was applied.

2.3. Calculation of Modularity
We computed modularity from correlations in neural activity of the brain extracted
from fMRI data [11, 13, 33]. Fig. 1 illustrates the process. Correlations were
computed for each subject between Brodmann areas, a standardized basis set
describing regions of the human cerebral cortex [34]. Modularity was computed using
the Newman algorithm [35]. We projected the Nedge largest values of the correlation
matrix to unity, and set the remaining values to zero. We computed the modularity
of this projected matrix. These values of modularity depend on the parameter Nedge ,
and it will be confirmed that adult modularity is greater than child modularity for
all Nedge values. The value for the Nedge parameter must be large enough that the
projected correlation matrix is fully connected, which implies Nedge ≥ 200 for our
data set. We considered 200 ≤ Nedge ≤ 500 so that the non-linear effect of the
projection were significant, i.e. the projected matrix was not simply all unity.
The numerical value of the modularity is the probability to have correlations within
the modules, minus the probability expected for a randomized matrix with the same
degree sequence [35]. In other words,

and e = 21 i ai is the total number of edges, as in Fig. 1. Edges are established
if the correlation between Brodmann areas i and j is greater than the cutoff value,
which is implicitly determined by the desired number of edges to keep in the matrix,
see Fig. 1b. Modules are defined by the grouping that maximizes M [35]. The
Newman algorithm [35] is used to calculate values of modularity and the identity of
the modules. This algorithm gives a unique answer for the modularity and set of
modules for a given connection matrix. The value of the modularity depends on how
the Brodmann areas are grouped into modules, in Eq. 1, and the Brodmann areas
are clustered into modules by choosing the grouping that maximizes the modularity,
Eq. 1.
It is not necessary to use a cutoff in the calculation of the modularity. The Newman
modularity calculation can be applied to a full matrix, with real number values,

rather than the binary projection. That is, the matrix A in Eq. (1) can simply be
the full correlation matrix, without projection. Modularity computations on the full,
real-valued matrix will also be presented.
Finally, it is also not necessary to use the Brodmann areas as regions of interest.
That is, the i and j in Eq. (1) can simply be voxels, rather than Brodmann areas.
Results for (8 mm)3 and (12 mm)3 voxels will be presented. Thus, modularity values
for three different basis sets were computed.

to calculate modularity from the correlation matrix. The results for 400 edges are
representative, and unless otherwise noted, we used this criterion to construct the
projected correlation matrix. Modularity of neural activity increases with age during
childhood development. The average Pearson correlation between modularity and
age, corresponding to the data in Fig. 2a, is 0.44 (p-value 0.02, sample size 22).
Similarly, the average Pearson correlation between modularity and raw, not-agenormalized KBIT-2 overall IQ score is 0.234 (p-value 0.16, sample size 16, as some
children did not have reported IQ scores). The positive correlation of modularity
with both age and raw IQ shows the development of modularity in neural activity
in the brain during childhood.

values. The modularity of adults and children are significantly different, p-value

3.2. Effect of Head Motion on Calculation of Modularity.
The extent of head motion was measured by the Euclidean norm of the derivatives of
the motion parameters, termed EN. To illustrate this point, a number of correlations
were carried out to illustrate the effect of head motion. The correlations for children
are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. Modularity is significantly correlated with age.

Figure 3. Calculation of modularity when the full matrix of correlations is used.
Calculations were performed using Brodmann areas as nodes and a 84 × 84 matrix
of correlations. Calculations were also performed without masking the data to
Brodmann areas, and using the original data at a resolution of 12 mm and a
2160×2160 correlation matrix or a resolution of 8 mm and a 6426×6426 correlation
matrix. The p-values for the significance of the difference between the modularity
of adults and children are 7 × 10−5 , 9 × 10−5 , and 4 × 10−5 , respectively. These
results confirm the generality of the results in Fig. 2. Modularity develops during
childhood.

Furthermore, inclusion of EN to the correlation of modularity with age only very
slightly increases the goodness of fit (R2 ), and does not change the positive slope
of the correlation of M with age. The coefficient relating modularity to age, ∂M/∂
age, is the same whether head motion is included as an independent variable or not.
Thus, the head motion is not biasing the estimated relationship between modularity
and age. The correlations of modularity or age with EN are small and not significant.
The correlation of modularity with EN for adults is also small and not significant,

3.3. Development of Modules
Not only is the modularity of neural activity in the children and adults different,
but also the identity of the modules changes with development. We computed the
probability that Brodmann areas i and j were in the same module, as estimated from
the data by the observed fraction. Consider a single person. The probability that
area i and j are in the same module, pij , is either 0 or 1 (they either are, or are not,
in the same module in one given subject sample). The sum of this quantity over j
is the size of the module in which i is a member, Si . Averaging Si over all children
or all adults gives the average size of the module in which i participates, hSi ichild or

Also reported are the three i for which hSi iadult − hSi ichild is largest and the three i
for which hSi iadult − hSi ichild is smallest.
We found the three Brodmann areas that had the largest positive difference between
the average module size in adults and children, shown in Fig. 2b. These are the areas
whose modules grew most in size with development. They are left Brodmann area 23,
29, and 31. We also found the three Brodmann areas that had the largest negative
difference in average module size between adults and children, i.e. the areas whose
modules shrink most with development, shown in Fig. 2b. They are left Brodmann
area 21, right 40, and right 43.

3.4. Near Degeneracy of Modularity Values
In the definition of modularity, Eq. (1), there can be partitions that give values of
modularity near but slightly below the optimal value. The optimal value is denoted
by M, and the nearby values are denoted by Q. To address the near degeneracy of
modularity values, that is values of Q that are near the optimal value of modularity
M, the Newman algorithm was generalized to include the possibility of accepting
a move that decreases Q, with probability min[1, exp(∆Q/T )]. This generalization
leads to sampling the near-optimal values of Q, roughly in the range M − T to M.
How the average Q varies with T was calculated. Also calculated was how often the
set of the 3 Brodmann areas for hSi iadult − hSi ichild is largest changes identity in 100
runs, and similarly for the set of the 3 for which it is smallest . From these results,
one sees that M values reported are representative, i.e. the nearly degenerate hQi
values are close to the optimal value, M. The identification of 3 Brodmann areas for
which hSi iadult −hSi ichild is largest and the 3 for which it is smallest is relatively stable
among these nearly degenerate states. Essentially only the least stable member of
the latter is lost at finite T (3/3 and 2/3 of the members are stable, respectively).
The top areas are more stable than the bottom areas, because there is a gap in
the distribution of hSi iadult − hSi ichild after the 3rd highest value, see Fig. 6. This
distribution shows there is a natural set of highest and lowest outliers.

4. Model
4.1. Model of the Response Function for Memory Recall
We will explore a mechanism to understand the results with a model of neural activity
and cognitive function. We build upon the Hopfield neural network model [36].
Models of brain activity with different levels of detail and complexity have been
developed. At the detailed level, there are models of individuals neuron activation
and spiking [37–39]. These models have been generalized to a population of neurons,
in which synchronization of the spike trains has been calculated [40, 41]. The data
analyzed are at the resolution of 4 mm, and a voxel of (4 mm)3 contains roughly
a million neurons. The modeling is, therefore, of interactions between groups of

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

16

neurons, with each group containing a million neurons. In addition, the time
resolution of the fMRI BOLD signal data is 2 s. The fMRI BOLD signal results
from the difference in magnetic spin properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated
hemoglobin. This signal is, therefore, a representation of blood flow to each region of
the brain. The regional blood flow is an indication of local neural activity [42]. At this
time and length scale, a model such as the Hopfield neural network is appropriate.
As with the data, neural activity is the only observable in this model.
We used a neural network model to describe the dynamics of neural activation that
was measured by the fMRI experiments. The voxels of neural activation measured in
the fMRI are subgroups of neurons in the brain. In the model, the activation state
of subgroup i is given by σi (t), which takes on values 1 or −1 to indicate that the
subgroup of neurons is active or inactive on average at time t, respectively. Thus, for
each physical region of the brain in Fig. 1a, there is a σi (t). The neural state at time
t + 1 was created from the neural state at time t, based upon connections between
neurons and stored memories. We here took the connections between the neurons
to be modular, with modularity M. These functional connections, denoted by the
matrix Aij below, correspond roughly to the modules identified in Fig. 1d. The model
describes how neural states in the brain are driven to match stored patterns, with
the µth pattern denoted by ξiµ . We also took the stored memories to be clustered.
The correlation between these stored patterns is denoted by the weight matrix Wij .
The clustering of the stored memories is quantified a parameter p, described below.
The modules identified in the fMRI experiments, Fig. 1d, are described in detail in
the model through the combined influence of the connection matrix and the memory
correlation matrix, Aij Wij .
We related the modularity of the neural activation in the model to the modularity
of the neural activity as measured by fMRI. The connection matrix denotes whether
neural region i is connected to region j. Due to physiological changes that occur
during development, these connections change, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. In
particular, we set the connection matrix of the neural network to be modular [43],
with modularity M. Crucially, we also set the stored memory patterns to be clustered
as well, with modularity p. The neural state is propagated from a random initial
state to recall a stored memory according to the Hebbian learning rule [44]. We
computed the average overlap between the final neural state and the stored memory.
In terms of an experiment, overlap at time t can be interpreted as quantifying how

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

17

well a subject correctly identifies an image that is visible for a time, t.
In the neural network model, memory µ is defined by the pattern ξiµ = ±1 of length
P
N = 256 bits [36]. The weight matrix is defined by Wij = µ ξiµ ξjµ . The N/4 × N/4
block diagonals define the four modules. Four distinct patterns are stored, one per
module. Each pattern µ has N/4 values with ξiµ = +1, each of which has probability
(1 + 3p)/4 of being within the µth block diagonal. The neural state is defined by
P
σi (t) and updated by the Hebbian learning rule [44] σi (t + 1) = sign[ j Aij Wij σj (t)].
The connection matrix A is binary and sparse, with average degree hki = 30. The
probability for a connection to be at a given site within the block diagonal is given
by (1 + 3M)hki/N. The overlap of the neural state with the target memory is given
P
by maxµ i ξiµ σi (t)/N.
4.2. A Hierarchical Generalization
It has been argued that at the largest scales, the brain structure is hierarchical, not
simply modular. Thus, the modular Hopfield neural network described above was
also generalized to an hierarchical model. A similar hierarchical model was studied
by Rubinov et al. in a computational analysis to show the effect of self-organized
criticality and neuronal information processing [41]. In the modular model, the
connection matrix A is made modular. In the hierarchical model discussed here, 5
levels, γ, are defined. The level for matrix position ij is defined as the smallest γ for
which ⌊i/4γ ⌋ = ⌊j/4γ ⌋. For example, γ = 0 is the diagonal, and γ = 4 is the entire
matrix, excluding the all the 4 × 4 block diagonals. See Fig. 7. The probability to
be within region γ is assigned to be proportional to 1 − γǫ, with the proportionality
determined so that the average number of connections per node remains at 30. Here
ǫ = 1/4 is a measure of the asymmetry introduced by the hierarchy.
4.3. Model Results
The cognitive ability of the brain, i.e. its ability to solve a challenge, depends on
modularity of the neural activity. The responses of the model neural system with
high modularity and lower modularity are shown in Fig. 8. In this figure, cognitive
performance is quantified by overlap between evolved neural state and target memory

state. These performance curves as a function of time and neural architecture depend
on the clustering of the stored memories, p. The overlap typically increases with
time, as the target memory is dynamically recalled. At short times, a more modular
memory architecture can lead to a better recall, i.e. greater overlap with the stored
memory. At longer times, a less modular memory architecture can give better
performance. We view this crossing of the performance as a function of time to
be a generic result of an evolving dynamical system with a rugged fitness landscape
[45] and not unique to the particular model used here.
The variation in performance, shown in Fig. 8, helps to explain the change of
modularity during development. We use quasispecies theory to quantify the
relationship between performance and change of modularity. In this theory, systems
with different modularity, m, are assigned a fitness, f (m), that quantifies the benefit

Figure 8. More modular neural architectures give better performance at short
times (a or d, short time) and less modular memory architectures can give better
performance at long times (a or d, long time). The greater modularity in adults
than children, Fig. 2, is consistent with either cognitive performance at short times

clustered in adults than children (bottom arrow). Overlap is a measure of the
probability that the neural state correctly recalls a memory. The modularity of

fitness function, and the rate at which entries in the connection matrix change,
µ.
We take the overlap in Fig. 8 as the fitness for modularity, f (m), in the brain and use
quasispecies theory [46] to predict how modularity develops with age. The average
modularity, M(t) = hm(t)i, changes with age according to

arrow of Fig. 8, the response time is taken to be 15, and it is assumed that p(t)
changes from 0.8 at birth to 0.6 in middle age and 0.7 in old age, This p(t) is shown
in Fig. 9a. Previous studies have shown that the modularity, measured with an
automated anatomical labeling (AAL) basis set for resting state activity, of neural
activity in adults with average age of 70 is roughly 7% below that of adults with
average age of 22 [6, 13]. Another study of 193 adults aged 34–87, also using the AAL
basis set, found that on average, modularity decreased 8% over 50 years [19]. These
results imply p should be lower in old age than in young adulthood. The prediction
from Eq. (2), shown in Fig. 9b, is a qualitative prediction for the developing human
brain. Due to mutation [46], the observed modularity in Fig. 9b is below the value
that maximizes the fitness, M ∗ (t), defined by f [p(t), M ∗ (t)] ≥ f [p(t), M] ∀ M. We
calculate the modularity in the adiabatic limit, M ∞ (t), from the steady-state average
fitness derived from a solution of the quasispecies theory [46]:

10 and 11. These results show that this hierarchical generalization of the Hopfield
model also shows a crossing of the response function at intermediate times. That
is, low levels of hierarchy lead to better responses at long times. And high levels of
hierarchy can lead to better responses at short times.

5. Discussion
We have observed that modularity of neural activity in the brain increases with age
from children to young adults, as measured by fMRI experiments. These data are
summarized in Fig. 2. The analysis separately takes into account head motion, and
the present study finds that after censoring and alignment, the effects of head motion
are negligible.
The Nedge cutoff parameter from Fig. 2 can be viewed as a clustering parameter.
What Fig. 2 shows is that the modularity of adults is greater than that of children,
persistently with the value of the Nedge cutoff parameter. In other words, the
conclusion that modularity develops from children to adults is robust with respect
to the particular value of the cutoff parameter.

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

22

Previous analysis of fMRI data from young adults and old adults has shown that
modularity of neural activity in the brain decreases with age [6, 13, 19]. Taken
together with the present results, it appears that modularity of neural activity peaks
in young adulthood.
The calculation of modularity was done using both the Brodmann areas as a basis
and using raw voxel data. Both calculations show the modularity of children is
greater than that of young adults. Additionally, the calculated values of modularity
were shown to be representative of the full distribution of near-optimal values.
The Brodmann areas that grew most during development, left Brodmann area 23, 29,
and 31, are in the posteromedial cortex. They play a central role in the brain neural
network and in communication with the rest of the brain [47–49]. These areas also
play important roles in memory retrieval [50, 51]. It is interesting that all three areas
in the left brain, generally associated with logic, language and analytical thinking.
The Brodmann areas identified to be in the modules that grow the most with
development are somewhat sensitive to the number of edges used in the projection of
the correlation matrix. For the range of edges show in Fig. 2a, 80% of the identified
Brodmann areas are in the left hemisphere. Additionally, the area with the most
dominantly growing module, left Brodmann 29, is identified 80% of the time. Our
results are consistent with the observation that the right brain is dominant in infants,
and that left brain develops later into adulthood [52]. The Brodmann areas that
shank most during development, They are left Brodmann area 21, right 40, and
right 43, are related to language perception and processing, accessing word meaning,
and face recognition [53, 54]. The area with the most dominantly shrinking module,
left Brodmann 21, is identified 80% of the time.
Prior results show that young adults are able to more quickly solve task-switching
challenges than are children or old adults [24]. The present model shows that
modularity allows for rapid responses. That is, a more modular neural activity
can allow the brain to switch more quickly from one type of neural activation to
another. This conclusion is robust to refinements in the hierarchical structure of the
model. Therefore, selective pressure for rapid cognition should lead to the emergence
of modularity in neural activity of the brain during childhood development.
The present model suggests that modularity of neural activity may develop to
facilitate rapid cognitive function. Modularity may be larger in young adults than

Development of modularity in the neural activity of children’s brains

23

in children because the typical required response time is shorter (upper arrow of
Fig. 8). Modularity may also be larger because there are more connections between
memories in adults than children, i.e. memories are less clustered, quantified by a
smaller p (lower arrow Fig. 8). A module offers a pre-computed solution to a problem
that has been previously encountered. Development of modularity from children to
adults, thus, can improve task-switching performance.
5.1. Experimental Implications
Experiments to determine cognitive performance, as it depends on modularity, would
be interesting to carry out. Predictions from quasispecies theory using this fitness
function could test the significance of the measured task for developmental selection.
Cognitive performance of subjects could be challenged while fMRI data are collected.
For example, as suggested by the model, the probability of a subject to correctly
identify an image visible for a time t may be measured. The cognitive performance
should depend, among other parameters, on the modularity of the correlations in
the subject’s neural activity in the brain. Measuring performance as a function of
modularity would provide the cognitive performance function, e.g. Fig. 8a or d, for
this particular task. Perhaps the cognitive performance function will peak at different
values of modularity for different tasks. It has been suggested that cognitive processes
which are fast are more modular than those which are slow [16]. The results in Fig.
8 show why this is the case: modular networks provide better performance at short
times (Fig. 8b or e), but less modular networks can provide better performance at
long times (Fig. 8c or f). Measurements of cognitive performance for high-level and
low-level tasks would complement these results. We predict that performance curves
as a function of time will cross for subject samples with different values of modularity,
as in Fig. 8a.
5.2. Modularity as a Biomarker
A biomarker for brain function may be developed from modularity. For example,
modularity of neural activity in epileptic patients is less than that in normal subjects
[15]. Anecdotal evidence [55] suggests that neural activity in patients with traumatic
brain injury (TBI) is less modular than that in healthy subjects. Thus, we predict

REFERENCES

24

that background neural activity in the brains of TBI patients will be less modular
than that of healthy subjects. If so, modularity may be useful to quantify the
extent of TBI, which is currently difficult to determine. Effectiveness of treatment
is also difficult to quantify, and measurements of modularity may be helpful to track
progress of TBI rehabilitation treatments. Measurements of modularity may even be
useful as feedback during treatment. Interestingly, modularity seems to increase in
response to disease progression and reduced cognitive function in multiple sclerosis
patients [56], perhaps because the system is compensating for increased stress due
to reduced function with increased modularity [6].
