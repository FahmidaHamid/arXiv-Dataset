Abstract
The control of the spread of dengue fever by introduction of the intracellular parasitic bacterium
Wolbachia in populations of the vector Aedes aegypti, is presently one of the most promising tools
for eliminating dengue, in the absence of an efficient vaccine. The success of this operation requires
locally careful planning to determine the adequate number of individuals carrying the Wolbachia
parasite that need to be introduced into the natural population. The introduced mosquitoes are
expected to eventually replace the Wolbachia-free population and guarantee permanent protection
against the transmission of dengue to human.
In this study, we propose and analyze a model describing the fundamental aspects of the competition between mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia and mosquitoes free of the parasite. We then use
feedback control techniques to devise an introduction protocol which is proved to guarantee that the
population converges to a stable equilibrium where the totality of mosquitoes carry Wolbachia.

Introduction
Arboviroses and vector control

Arboviruses (arthropod borne viruses) are viruses transmitted to humans by arthropod, such as the
mosquito. They are pathogens of many and important diseases, putting at risk considerable portions of
the human population, and infecting millions of people every year. Mosquitoes (Culicidae family of the
insects) are a huge public health concern as they are vectors of many arboviroses such as yellow fever,
dengue and chikungunya.
The control of these diseases can be achieved by acting on the population of mosquitoes, and in absence
of vaccine or curative treatment, it is essentially the only feasible way. Application of insecticides for both
adults and larvae and mechanical removal of breeding sites are the most popular strategies to control the
population of mosquitoes. The intensive use of insecticides, however, has negative impacts for humans,
animals and the environment. Besides, the gradual increase of mosquito resistance to insecticides usually
leads to partial or complete decrease of the efficiency of this strategy in the long run (de Freitas and
Valle, 2014; Montella et al, 2007). In addition to chemical control and mechanical removal of the breeding
sites, alternative or supplementary vector control strategies have been proposed and implemented, such
as the release of transgenic or sterile mosquitoes (Alphey et al, 2010; Alphey, 2014). Notice that an
intrinsic weakness of the techniques listed above lies paradoxically in the fact that they aim at the local
eradication of the vector, whose disappearance offers no protection against subsequent reinvasions.
Recently the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected by the bacterium Wolbachia has been
proposed as a promising strategy to control dengue and chikungunya, due to the fact that this bacterium
limits severely the vectorial competence of Aedes aegypti. The international program Eliminate Dengue
(Hoffmann et al) is currently testing in the field this strategy, in several locations around the world:
Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Colombia and Brazil. The release of infected mosquitoes with Wolbachia
has the advantages of being safe for humans and the environment and inexpensive when compared to
other control strategies (Popovici et al, 2010).

1.2

Wolbachia sp. as a biological control tool

Wolbachia sp. is a genus of bacteria that is a common intracellular parasite of many species of arthropods.
It is often found in anthropophilic mosquitoes such as Aedes albopictus or Culex quinquefasciatus but
there is no report of Aedes aegypti naturally infected by this bacterium (Rasgon and Scott, 2004).
There is evidence that the spread of certain strains of Wolbachia in populations of Aedes aegypti
drastically reduces the vector competence of the mosquito for dengue and other diseases (Moreira et al,
2009; Blagrove et al, 2012, 2013). Some strains of Wolbachia reduce the lifespan of the mosquito,
consequently limiting the proportion of surviving mosquitoes at the completion of the incubation period.
More importantly, Wolbachia appears to decrease the virulence of the dengue infection in the mosquitoes,
increasing the incubation period or blocking the virus, which also reduces the overall vector competence.
The infestation of natural Aedes aegypti populations by Wolbachia-contaminated strains can be
achieved by releasing in the field a large number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes bred in laboratory.
Experiments have been conducted successfully in Australia (Hoffmann et al, 2011), Vietnam, Indonesia
and are currently being applied in Brazil, within the Eliminate Dengue Program. In these experiments,
the introduction of a number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in the population triggered a Wolbachia

offspring is indicated, depending on the parents status
outbreak whose outcome was the fixation of the bacteria in the population, with more than 90% of prevalence. The effects of this fixation of Wolbachia on the dynamics of dengue in the field is currently under
investigation, but preliminary results are encouraging (Frentiu et al, 2014). If tractable in practice, this
method has certainly the advantage of offering certain resilience to subsequent invasion of Wolbachia-free
mosquitoes.
Several mathematical models of the dynamics of invasion of Wolbachia in a population of mosquitoes
have been proposed, with distinct objectives. For example, Turelli (2010) describes a simple model with
a single differential equation, sufficient to reveal the bistable nature of the Wolbachia dynamics. Models
for spatial dispersion are analyzed in (Barton and Turelli, 2011) and (Hancock and Godfray, 2012). In
(Hughes and Britton, 2013; Ndii et al, 2015), models are presented that assess the effect of the Wolbachia
in dengue dynamics. Koiller et al (2014) describes a data driven model suitable to estimate accurately
some biological parameters by fitting the model with field and lab data. The model to be presented here
is a simplified version of the latter.

1.3

Description of the problem

A key question about the introduction of Wolbachia in wild mosquitoes concerns the effective strategies
of release of infected mosquitoes in the field that can be applied with limited cost to reach the desired
state of 100% of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes. In this paper we propose and analyze a simple model
of the dynamics of Wolbachia, that allows to investigate these strategies.
The main features of the natural dynamics of Wolbachia that have to be present in the model are the
vertical transmission and the peculiar interference on the reproductive outcomes induced by cytoplasmic
incompatibility (O’Neill et al, 1998). The transmission of Wolbachia occurs only vertically (i.e. from
mother to the offspring), there is no transmission by contact. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) occurs
when a female uninfected by Wolbachia is inseminated by an infected male, a mating that leads to
sterile eggs. It provides a benefit to infected females against uninfected ones and therefore facilitates
the Wolbachia spread. The strains wMel and wMelPop of Wolbachia that are being used in the field
experiments with Aedes aegypti induce almost total CI (Walker et al, 2011). Table 1 schematizes the
results of the mating of infected and uninfected mosquitoes when the CI is 100%. The model that we
propose below captures all of these features and is simple enough to allow for a fairly complete analysis.
The corresponding system is shown to possess two unstable equilibria, which correspond to extinction
of the two populations and a coexistence equilibrium; and two locally asymptotically stable equilibria,
which correspond to Wolbachia-free and complete infestation equilibria. The release strategy we propose
here is based on techniques from Control theory — the released quantity of infected mosquitoes being
the control input. Using the fact that measurements are achieved and available during the whole release
process, we propose a simple feedback control law that uses this knowledge to compute the input value.
The key result of the paper (Theorem 12) proves that this control law has the capacity to asymptotically
settle the bacterium from whatever initial conditions, and in particular from the completely Wolbachiafree equilibrium. A major advantage of feedback compared to open-loop approaches (when the release
schedule is computed once for all before the beginning of the experiment), is its ability to cope with
the uncertainties on the model dynamics (e.g. in the modeling of the life stages and the population
structure), on the parameters (population size, mortality, reproductive rates, etc.), and on the conditions
of the realization (in particular on the size of the population to be treated).
Up to our knowledge, the present paper constitutes the first attempt to use feedback approach for
introduction of Wolbachia within a population of arthropods. Notice that we treat here only the case
of the release of Wolbachia-positive larvae and full information on the quantity of Wolbachia-negative
larvae. Yet, the same dynamical model offers the ability to study other configurations, both for the

control and the observation, and the corresponding issues will be examined in future work.
The paper is organized as follows. The simple model used in the sequel is introduced in Section 2,
and normalized. The analysis of the uncontrolled model is made in Section 3, showing the bistability
announced above between Wolbachia-free equilibrium and full infestation. A proportional control law
is then proposed in Section 4, and proved to lead to global stability of the full infestation equilibrium.
Simulations are provided in Section 5. Last, concluding remarks complete the text in Section 6.

A simple model of infestation by Wolbachia

The simplified compartment model we introduce includes two life stages: a preliminary one, gathering
the aquatic phases (egg and larva) where the mosquitoes are subject to space and food competition;
and an adult one, representing all the posterior aerial phases (pupae, immature and mature adult).
Accordingly, we will denote L and A the corresponding state variables. The uninfected and infected
(by Wolbachia) populations will be distinguished by indexes U and W respectively, so we end up with
a four state variables model, namely LU , LW and AU , AW , that represent the numbers of uninfected,
resp. infected, vectors in preliminary and adult phases.
We propose the following evolution model.
L̇U = αU

AU
AU − νLU − µ(1 + k(LW + LU ))LU
AU + AW
ȦU = νLU − µU AU

(1a)
(1b)

L̇W = αW AW − νLW − µ(1 + k(LW + LU ))LW + u

(1c)

ȦW = νLW − µW AW

(1d)

All the parameters are positive, their meaning is summarized in Table 2.
Most aspects of this compartment model are rather classical, we now comment on the most original
modeling choices. The differences between the behaviors of the two populations lie in the different
fecundity and mortality rates. The mortality during the larva stage and the duration of the latter are
considered unmodified by the disease. Also, the (quadratic) competition term is assumed to act equally
on both populations, with an effect proportional to the global number of larvae.
The first effect of Wolbachia is to diminish fertility and life duration, leading to reduced fitness for
the infected mosquitoes. This assumption will correspond to the choice of parameters made in (5) below.
The second effect of Wolbachia, namely the cytoplasmic incompatibility, modeled here as complete,
forbids fecund mating between infected males and uninfected females. This is rendered in (1a) by a
recruitment term proportional altogether to the number and to the ratio of uninfected adults. Notice in
this respect that the model apparently does not make distinction between males and females. In fact,
one could introduce in place of the two variables AU , AW , four variables FU , FW , MU , MW representing
the quantities of female and male adults. The recruitment terms in (1c), resp. (1a), would then naturally
U
be replaced by expressions proportional to FW , resp. MUM
+MW FU . However it is easy to see that the
proportion between males and females remains constant in this more complex system, as long as the
4

mortality rates for healthy and infected insects are equal for the males and the females, and the passage
from larvae to adults occurs with a constant sex ratio. One can therefore use a single variable to take
account of the uninfected adults, and a single one to take account of the infected adults, just as done
in (1). In other terms, provided the sex ratio is constant and the mortality is sex-independent, a sexual
model yields no more information than (1).
As a last comment, notice the term u in equation (1c). The latter is an input variable, modeling the
on-purpose introduction of infected larvae in the system in order to settle Wolbachia.

Assumption (5), which will be valid in the remainder of the paper, ensures the sustainability of each of
the two isolated populations, with an even better sustainability for the non-infected one. See Theorem

Analysis of the uncontrolled system

The uncontrolled system is obtained by taking zero input u, that is:
ẋ = f (x)

3.1

Well-posedness, positivity and boundedness

One first shows the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem related to equation (6) for nonnegative initial
conditions.
Theorem 1. For any initial value in R4+ , there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem
associated to system (6). The latter is defined on [0, +∞), depends continuously on the initial conditions
and takes on values in R4+ . Moreover, it is uniformly ultimately bounded.
Remark 2. The previous result shows that system (6) is positive. Therefore, when talking about
“trajectories”, we will always mean trajectories with initial values in R4+ . The same shortcut will be
used for all positive systems considered later.
Let us introduce the following definition of an order induced by a cone, that will be instrumental in
proving Theorem 1.
Definition 3. Let n ∈ N and K ⊂ Rn be a closed convex cone with nonempty interior. We use ≥K to
denote the order induced by K, that is: ∀x, x0 ∈ Rn ,
x ≥K x 0

x − x0 ∈ K .

⇔

Similarly, one defines
x >K x0 ⇔ x − x0 ∈ K and x 6= x0
x K x0 ⇔ x − x0 ∈ int K
As usual, one will write x ≤K x0 to mean x0 ≥K x.
Proof of Theorem 1. Function f in (6) is clearly well-defined and continuous in R4+ , except in points

AU tends towards
where AU = AW = 0. Due to the fact that 0 ≤ AUA+A

zero when one approaches such points, and f (x) can thus be defined by continuity when AU = AW = 0.
In addition, the right-hand side is clearly locally Lipschitz in R4+ , and classical result ensures the local
well-posedness of the initial value problem, as long as the trajectory does not leave this set.
The invariance property of the set R4+ is verified due to the fact that
∀x ∈ R4+ , ∀i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} :

xi = 0 ⇒ fi (x) ≥ 0 .

Let us now show that, for any initial condition in R4+ , the associated trajectory remains bounded for
all t ≥ 0. With this aim, let us define
L := LU + LW ,
γ := min{γU ; γW } > 0,

A := AU + AW ,
R0 :=

Now, the auxiliary system

6

Ȧ0 = L0 − γA0

(11)

is evidently cooperative (see Hirsch (1988)) for the canonic order induced by the cone R2+ . One may
thus use Kamke’s theorem, see e.g. (Coppel, 1965, Theorem 10, p. 29) or Smith (1995), and compare the
solutions of (6) (with L and A defined by (8)) and (11). One deduces
L(t) ≤ L0 (t),

A(t) ≤ A0 (t),

for all t ≥ 0,

whenever the solutions are considered with the same initial conditions.
It may be shown without difficulty that system (11) possesses exactly two equilibria, namely


1
∗
∗
∗
x∗ := (L∗ , A∗ ) := (0, 0) and x := (L , A ) := R0 − 1, R0 .
γ
Due to (9), linearization around each point shows that x∗ is locally unstable, while x∗ is locally asymptotically stable (LAS). On the other hand, notice that x∗ ≤R2+ x∗ . Using the local stability information,
application of (Hirsch, 1988, Theorem 10.3) then shows that the stability of x∗ is global in the topological
interior of R2+ , and that this point is in fact attractive for any initial point distinct from x∗ = (0, 0). In
any case, all solutions of (11) converge to the order interval

	
Jx∗ ; x∗ KR2+ := x0 ∈ R2+ : L∗ ≤ L0 ≤ L∗ , A∗ ≤ A0 ≤ A∗ .
Coming back to the solutions of (6), the comparison method mentioned above now allows to deduce
the same property for L, A defined in (8). Using finally the fact, proved in Theorem 1, that the trajectories
remain in R4+ , the same bounds apply componentwise to LU , LW and AU , AW respectively. In particular,
all solutions of (6) are uniformly ultimately bounded, and this yields global existence of solutions, and
hence the proof of Theorem 1.

3.2

Monotonicity

One shows here that the uncontrolled system (6) is monotone. For sake of completeness, we recall here
the definition of monotone and strongly order-preserving semiflows defined on a topological space X
partially ordered by an order relation ≤K generated by a cone K (see Smith (1995)).
Definition 4. The semiflow Φ is called monotone if
Φt (x) ≤K Φt (x0 )

whenever x ≤K x0 and t ≥ 0 .

The semiflow Φ is called strongly order-preserving if Φ is monotone and, whenever x <K x0 , there exist
open subsets Ω, Ω0 of X with x ∈ Ω, x0 ∈ Ω0 , and t > 0 such that
Φt (Ω) ≤K Φt (Ω0 ) ,
this meaning z ≤K z 0 , for all z ∈ Φt (Ω), z 0 ∈ Φt (Ω0 ). The semiflow Φ is called strongly monotone if Φ
is monotone and
Φt (x) K Φt (x0 )
whenever x <K x0 and t > 0 .
A dynamical system is said to have one of the properties above if its associated semiflow does.
We now examine system (6) at the light of these properties.
Theorem 5. System (6) is strongly order-preserving in R4+ for the order induced by the cone
K := R− × R− × R+ × R+ ,

(12)

(that is such that: x ≥K x0 ⇔ xi ≤ x0i , i = 1, 2 and xi ≥ x0i , i = 3, 4).
System (6) is therefore monotone in R4+ , but not strongly monotone, due to the fact that the trajectories departing inside the sets {x ∈ R4+ : LU = 0, AU = 0} and {x ∈ R4+ : LW = 0, AW = 0} remain
in these sets and, consequently, do not verify strict ordering property for the two null components.
Before proving Theorem 5, we summarize in the following result the behavior of the trajectories in
relation with some parts of the boundaries.
7

Lemma 6. Let x0 ∈ R4+ . Then exactly one of the four following properties is verified by the trajectories
departing from x0 at t = 0.
? x ≡ x0,0 (that is, x(t) = x0,0 , ∀t ≥ 0).
? AW ≡ 0 and AU (t) > 0, ∀t > 0.
? AU ≡ 0 and AW (t) > 0, ∀t > 0.
? AW (t) > 0 and AU (t) > 0, ∀t > 0.
Proof of Lemma 6. Clearly, one sees from (3b) (resp. (3d)) that AU ≡ 0 (resp. AW ≡ 0) if and only if
AU (0) = 0 and LU ≡ 0 (resp. AW (0) = 0 and LW ≡ 0). Therefore, if (AU (0), LU (0)) 6= (0, 0) (resp.
(AW (0), LW (0)) 6= (0, 0)), then AU (t) > 0 (resp. AW (t) > 0) for all t > 0. This proves Lemma 6.
Proof of Theorem 5. We now introduce the gradient of f . At each point x = (LU , AU , LW , AW ) ∈ R4+
such that AU + AW > 0, ∇f (x) is equal to

Notice that, as a corollary of Lemma 6, either x ≡ x0,0 , or AU (t) + AW (t) > 0 for all t > 0. Therefore,
the gradient can be computed at any point of a trajectory, except if the latter is reduced to x0,0 .
For any x ∈ R4+ , one verifies easily that
∂fi
∂fj
(x) ≤ 0,
(x) ≤ 0,

(x) ≥ 0 .
∂xj

∀(i, j) ∈ {1, 2} × {3, 4},

Hence the system is monotone.
Moreover, except when AU = 0 or AW = 0, the Jacobian matrix in (13) is irreducible, and the
semiflow related to system (6) is therefore strongly monotone therein. On the other hand, trajectories
confined to one of the sets {x ∈ R4+ : LU = 0, AU = 0} and {x ∈ R4+ : LW = 0, AW = 0}, also
verify strong monotonicity, for the order relation restricted to the two non-identically zero components.
These two remarks, together with Lemma 6, show that overall the strongly order-preserving property is
verified. This completes the demonstration of Theorem 5.

3.3

Equilibrium points and stability

The next result describes the situation of the equilibrium points and their stability. Recall that the cone
K used to order the state space has been defined in (12) (in Theorem 5).
Theorem 7. System (6) possesses four equilibrium points, denoted x0,0 , xU,0 , x0,W and xU,W and
corresponding respectively to zero population, disease-free state, complete infestation, and coexistence.
Moreover, the latter fulfill the following inequalities:
xU,0 K xU,W K x0,W

and

xU,0 K x0,0 K x0,W .

(15)

Last, the equilibrium points xU,0 and x0,W are locally asymptotically stable (LAS), while the two other
ones are unstable.
The proof of Theorem 7 is decomposed in the following sections.

One here computes the equilibrium points. The latter verify
AU
AU − (1 + LW + LU )LU = 0
AU + AW

LU = γU AU ,

(16a)
(16b)

LW = γW AW

(16c)

The point x0,0 := (0, 0, 0, 0) is clearly an equilibrium. Let us look for an equilibrium xU,0 :=
(L∗U , A∗U , 0, 0). The quantities L∗U , A∗U then have to verify
∗
∗
∗
γU R U
0 AU − (1 + LU )LU = 0,

L∗U = γU A∗U .

(17)

Dividing by L∗U 6= 0 yields 1 + L∗U = RU
0 . One thus gets the unique solution of this form verifying
L∗U = RU
0 − 1,

A∗U =

RU
0 −1
,
γU

which is positive due to hypothesis (5).
Similarly, one now looks for an equilibrium defined as x0,W := (0, 0, L∗W , A∗W ). The values of L∗W , A∗W
must verify
∗

∗
γW RW
L∗W = γW A∗W .
0 AW − (1 + LW )LW = 0,
This is identical to (17), and as for the xU,0 case, one gets a unique, positive, solution, namely
L∗W = RW
0 − 1,

A∗W =

Proof of Theorem 7 – Local stability analysis

The local stability analysis is conducted through the Jacobian matrices. Recall that the gradient has
been computed in (13).
Stability of x0,0 . The value of ∇f at x0,0 is not defined. However, the trajectories issued from points
in R2+ × {0}2 , resp. {0}2 × R2+ clearly remain in the respective subspace, and the stability in these
directions is controlled by the spectrum of the matrices

One of each pair is positive, due to condition (5), and x0,0 is thus unstable.
Stability of xU,0 . Using (13), the gradient ∇f (xU,0 ) of f at xU,0 is the upper block-triangular matrix

The left-upper block is a Hurwitz matrix, while the asymptotic stability of the second one is equivalent
to
W
2RW
0 − 1 > R0 ,
that is RW
0 > 1, which is true, due to hypothesis (5). The equilibrium x0,W is thus locally asymptotically
stable.
Stability of xU,W . The instability of xU,W can be proved by showing that the determinant of the
Jacobian matrix ∇f (xU,W ) is negative, which, together with the fact that the state space has even
dimension 4, establishes the existence of a positive real root to the characteristic polynomial; and thus
that the Jacobian is not a Hurwitz matrix. This argument yields lengthy computations.
It is more appropriate to use here the monotonicity properties of system (6), established in Theorem
5. As a matter of fact, bringing together the inequalities (15) (already proved in the end of the previous
section, see (22)), the asymptotical stability of xU,0 and x0,W and the strongly order-preserving property
of the system, (Smith, 1995, Theorem 2.2) shows that the intermediary point xU,W cannot be stable.
This finally achieves the stability analysis, as well as the proof of Theorem 7.

3.4

Positively invariant sets and basins of attraction

We exploit further in the following result the inequalities ordering the equilibrium points to have supplementary informations on some invariant sets.
Theorem 8. The order interval

	
JxU,0 ; x0,W KK := x ∈ R4 : xU,0 ≤K x ≤K x0,W ⊂ R4+

is positively invariant for system (6). Moreover, the order interval JxU,W ; x0,W KK (resp. JxU,0 ; xU,W KK )
is contained in the basin of attraction of x0,W (resp. x0,U ).
Proof. The positive invariance properties are direct consequences of the monotonicity properties exhibited
in Theorem 5. More precisely, endowing the state space with the ordering induced by the cone K
(see (12)), the autonomous
system (3) induces a monotone flow in R4 , strongly monotone in R4+ \

R2+ × {0}2 ∪ {0}2 × R2+ . As the trajectories are bounded, the set of initial points whose corresponding
trajectories do not converge to one of the equilibria is of zero measure (Hirsch, 1988, Theorem 7.8).
Among the equilibria, only xU,0 and x0,W are locally stable.
The same rationale applies
for any trajectory with initial condition in the order interval JxU,W ; x0,W KK \

R2+ × {0}2 ∪ {0}2 × R2+ , and the convergence (for almost every initial condition) in this interval can
only occur towards x0,W : the latter is therefore included in the basin of attraction. The same argument
applies for the other equilibrium xU,0 .

The basic results gathered in the following theorem can be demonstrated by use of the same arguments
than for Theorem 1. The proof presents no difficulty and is left to the reader.
Theorem 9. For any initial value in R4+ , there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem
associated to system (25). The latter is defined on [0, +∞), depends continuously on the initial conditions
and takes on values in R4+ . Moreover, it is uniformly ultimately bounded.

4.2

Equilibrium points and critical gain

We now turn to the study of the equilibrium points. The following result shows that, for gains larger than
certain critical value, the only locally asymptotically stable equilibrium is x0,W . Moreover, the explicit
value of this critical number depends only upon the basic offspring numbers of the two populations and
the ratio between their mortality rates, which are all scale-free information.
Theorem 10. If the feedback gain K is such that

(27)

then the closed-loop system (25) possesses two equilibrium points, namely x0,0 and x0,W , and their local
stability properties are not modified (i.e. x0,0 is unstable and x0,W is locally stable).
Proof of Theorem 10.
• The equilibrium points of system (25) are the points that verify
f (x) + KBeT x = 0 .

(28)

Clearly, the points x0,0 and x0,W are still equilibria of system (25), as in these points eT x = LU = 0;
and there are no other equilibria with LU = 0. In fact, from the third and fourth equations of (28), one
should obtain
∗
0 = γW R W
0 AW − (1 + LW )LW = (LW − LW )LW ,
where the second identity follows from the definition of L∗W in (18). Let us show that there are no other
equilibria than x0,0 and x0,W .
At any equilibrium point such that LU 6= 0, (28) yields
W
0 = γW R W
0 AW − (1 + LW + LU )LW + KLU = (R0 − 1 − LW − LU )LW + KLU

As hypothesis (27) is incompatible with the previous inequality, we deduce that system (25) possess only
two equilibrium points.
• We now study the local stability properties of the latter, by applying adequate modifications to the
gradient exhibited in (13) and used in Section 3.3.2 to study the stability of the uncontrolled model
equilibria. In fact, one just has to add to ∇f (x0,W ) the term


0 0 0 0
 0 0 0 0


K 0 0 0 .
0 0 0 0
It is clear, due to the form of this additional term, that the characteristic polynomial of the system
obtained from linearizing (25) at x0,W is affine with respect to K, and that, for K = 0, it coincides with
the characteristic polynomial of the linearization of (3).
Developing the determinant det(λI − ∇f (x0,W ) − KBeT ) (see (23)), the additional term is equal, for
the feedback control law defined in (24), to

Therefore the local behavior is not perturbed, and the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium x0,W is
conserved when the control term KBeT x is added. This achieves the proof of Theorem 10.
Remark 11. It can be checked from the latter proof that the previous result is not true when the effect

4.3

Global stability issues

We now turn to the most innovative part of this paper, namely the global behavior of the closed-loop
system (25). The result we establish here shows that the introduction of infected larvae according to
the proportional feedback law (24) yields conclusive infestation when the gain is larger than the critical
value. More precisely, we have the following convergence result.
Theorem 12. If K > K ∗ , all trajectories of system (25) issuing from a point in R4+ distinct from x0,0
converge towards the complete infestation equilibrium x0,W .
Notice that strictly speaking, Theorem 12 is an almost global convergence result: convergence towards
the complete infestation equilibrium is ensured, except for a zero measure set of initial conditions.
However, in the present case, this set is reduced to the unstable equilibrium.
Two attempts to prove Theorem 12 are rapidly presented in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. The main
interest is to show how these quite natural approaches fail to provide information on the asymptotic
behavior and, therefore, that a new approach is needed. Next a third conclusive method is exposed in
Section 4.3.3, where Theorem 12 is finally proved.
4.3.1

Global stability of a singularly perturbed system, by LaSalle’s invariance principle

We present now a first attempt, based on Lyapunov techniques. Consider the simpler system
L̇U = RU

γW LU
LU − (1 + LW + LU )LU
γW LU + γU LW

L̇W = RW
0 LW − (1 + LW + LU )LW + KLU

(31a)
(31b)

As can be easily verified, system (31) is deduced from (26) by applying singular perturbation, formally
putting 0 = LU − γU AU , 0 = LW − γW AW . In other words, we assume here that (26b) and (26d) are
fast dynamics, while (26a) and (26c) are comparatively much slower.
The proof of well-posedness and positiveness of system (31) presents no difficulties, one states directly
the asymptotic properties of this system.
Theorem 13. Assume K > K ∗ . Then system (31) possesses two equilibria, namely (0, 0) and (0, L∗W ).
The former one is unstable, while the latter one is locally asymptotically stable. Last, all trajectories of
system (31) converges towards (0, L∗W ), except the unstable equilibrium (0, 0) itself.
Proof. The first two assertions, proved in the same way than the similar properties were established for
system (3), are not detailed. The third point is proved by considering the following candidate Lyapunov
function:
LU
V (LU , LW ) :=
,
LU + LW
defined in the invariant set R2+ \ {(0, 0)}. Letting V̇ (LU , LW ) denote the value of the derivative with
respect to time of V (LU (t), LW (t)) along the trajectories of (31), we have

4.3.2

A monotone control system perspective

The second method now explored is an attempt to apply the results on monotone control systems, as
worked out in particular by Angeli and Sontag (2003), see also the works by Gouzé (1988); Cosner (1997);
Enciso and Sontag (2006); Enciso (2014). The principle of this approach consists in decomposing the
system under study as a monotone input-output system with feedback. Given the fact (see Theorem 5)
that the uncontrolled system is monotone, a most natural way to do this is to write system (25) as
ẋ = f (x) + KBu,
u=y

y = LU = eT x

(33a)
(33b)

Arguing as in Theorem 5, one can establish that the input-to-state map u 7→ x given by (33a) is monotone
when the state space is endowed with the ordering ≤K ; while the state-to-output map x 7→ y = eT x = LU
is anti-monotone. We are thus in the configuration of a so-called monotone system with negative feedback.
In such a case, the study of asymptotics of the system obtained when closing the loop by the unitary
feedback (33b) can be done by introducing static characteristics (Angeli and Sontag, 2003; Enciso, 2014).
By definition, when it exists, the input-state characteristic kX associates to any constant input ū the
corresponding value kX (ū) of the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium; and the inputoutput characteristic k, obtained by composing kX with the state-to-output map, associates to ū the
corresponding output value k(ū). Notice that for a monotone system with negative feedback (as it
is the case here), the map k is non-increasing. The inspiring results demonstrated in the references
above establish general conditions under which existence and stability of fixed points of the input-output
characteristic k permit to deduce the convergence of every (or almost every) trajectory of the closed-loop
system towards a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium; and that these equilibria are in one-to-one
correspondence with the stable fixed points (through the state-to-output map).
However, things become immediately complicated in the case of system (33): constant input ū = 0
leads to the uncontrolled system (6), which has been proved to possess two locally asymptotically stable
equilibria (and two unstable ones). In such a case, one can consider multivalued input-state and inputoutput characteristics, as made by Malisoff and Leenheer (2006), or Gedeon and Hines (2009). The
corresponding input-output characteristic is drawn in red in Figure 1 (for the parameter values given in
Section 5 below) and for the corresponding critical value K ∗ of K.
As seen in the figure, the input-output characteristic has basically two branches (both drawn in red).
The first one merges with the horizontal axis: it corresponds to a branch of equilibria with null value of
the output y = LU that departs from x0,W for ū = 0. The second one is a decreasing curve, defined for
values of ū ranging from zero to a value close to 2.32: it corresponds to the output value of a branch of
equilibria departing from xU,0 . The blue curve, which does not pertain to the input-output characteristic,
indicates the output values of a branch of unstable equilibria originating from xU,W and that vanishes
15

Figure 1: The multivalued input-output characteristic ū 7→ k(ū) corresponding to input-output system
(33a) (in red) and the diagonal ū 7→ ū (in black), in the critical case K ∗ = K. See text for explanations

together with the upper curve. The diagonal line (that determines the fixed points of k) is also shown.
It is tangent to the blue curve, due to the fact that K = K ∗ here. For smaller values of K, the diagonal
intersects twice the two upper branches; while for larger values of K the only intersection between the
input-output characteristic and the diagonal is the origin.
For K > K ∗ , the complete infestation equilibrium is therefore the only fixed point of the multivalued
map k. But the iterative sequences ūk+1 = k(ūk ) do not converge systematically towards this point. In
fact, the only information that can be deduced from the results applicable to cases of multivalued inputoutput characteristic (Malisoff and Leenheer, 2006; Gedeon and Hines, 2009), is that all trajectories are
bounded, and that the output y = LU fulfills the following inequalities:


sup
0 ≤ lim sup y(t) ≤ k
lim inf y(t) .
t→+∞

t→+∞

Here k sup denotes the discontinuous function whose curve is equal to the upper branch until it vanishes,
and merges afterwards with the horizontal axis.
As a conclusion, the decomposition (33), that seemed a natural framework to analyze the behavior
of the controlled system (25) immediately fails to produce a global vision of the asymptotic behavior.
4.3.3

Monotonicity revisited and proof of the global stability

We now concentrate without supplementary detour on the proof of Theorem 12. The principle consists
in working on an alternative decomposition of system (25), different from (33). Define first
(
(
z if z ≤ 0
z if z ≥ 0
|z|− :=
and
|z|+ :=
0 otherwise

Clearly, one has
z = |z|− + |z|+ ,

As a matter of fact, using property (34), one sees easily that the closing of the input-output link (35) by
u = y indeed yields system (25).
Next, we state and prove Lemmas 14, 15 and 16, that will be used in the proof of the main result,
Theorem 12.
Lemma 14. For any integrable u taking on nonnegative values, the set R4+ is positively invariant by
(35).
Proof of Lemma 14. The key point is that |K − LW |− LU = 0 when 0 ≤ LW < K. Therefore, near the
border of R4+ where LW = 0, the system (35) behaves locally as L̇W = γW RW
0 AW − (1 + LW )LW + Ku.
The fact that L̇W ≥ 0 whenever LW = 0 then forbids escape from the set R4+ by this side. The same
happens for the other three variables: their derivatives are nonnegative at the points where they vanish.
Hence, the trajectories can neither escape by the other sides. This establishes the positive invariance of
R4+ and achieves the proof of Lemma 14.
Lemma 15. The input-output system (35) is monotone with negative feedback, when the state space is
endowed with the order ≥K defined in Theorem 5.
Proof of Lemma 15. The right-hand sides of (35a), (35b) and (35d) have been studied in Theorem 5.
The right-hand side of (35c) is clearly increasing with respect to AW and u, and non-increasing with
respect to LU . So the input-to-state map is monotone when the state space is endowed with the order
defined in Theorem 5.
On the other hand, the state-to-output map defined by (35e) is non-increasing with respect to LW ,
and non-decreasing with respect to LU . Therefore, it is anti-monotone with respect to the ordering used
in the state space. This achieves the proof of Lemma 15.
Lemma 16. For any constant nonnegative input, system (35a)–(35d) possesses a unique LAS equilibrium. The latter yields null value of LU .
Moreover, the solution of the input-output system (35a)–(35d) converges towards the corresponding
equilibrium when time goes to infinity (and in particular the output LU converges to zero), except possibly
if ū = 0 and LW (0) = 0, AW (0) = 0.
Lemma 16 does not allow to define in the usual way an (identically null) input-output characteristic:
when ū > 0, the solution of the input-output system (35) converges to the LAS equilibrium for any initial
condition, and is such that
lim LU (t) = 0 ;
t→+∞

but when ū = 0, this property is only guaranteed if (LW (0), AW (0)) 6= (0, 0).
However, Lemma 16 allows to define a weaker notion of characteristic called input-output quasi-characteristic (Angeli et al, 2004). Contrary to the stronger notion (presented in Section 4.3.2), for any
constant input value, the convergence to the asymptotic value does not have to be global: convergence
is only required to occur in a full measure set (i.e. a set whose complementary is of zero-measure). This
is exactly what happens in the present situation, as the set of those x ∈ R4+ for which LW (0) = 0 and
AW (0) = 0 is negligible.
As a consequence, one can in fact show, with the tools developed by Angeli et al (2004), that x0,W
is almost-globally attractive for system (25), i.e. that it attracts all trajectories, except possibly those
departing from certain zero-measure set. The difficulty we now face is that this negligible set contains
17

a priori all the points of R4+ such that (LW (0), AW (0)) = (0, 0), and in particular the equilibrium xU,0 .
However, it is quite natural to assume that, at the moment where the release begins, the system departs
from a Wolbachia-free situation. In order to ensure that these situations too are concerned by the
convergence to x0,W , more precise arguments are therefore needed.
We first prove Lemma 16, and demonstrate in the sequel that, as announced in Theorem 12, the
convergence occurs for all trajectories, except the unique trajectory immobile at x0,0 .
Proof of Lemma 16. One first studies the equilibria of system (35a)–(35d), for constant inputs u : t 7→
u(t) ≡ ū, for ū ∈ R+ . Clearly, the set of these equilibria is the union of two sets: the set of equilibria of
(35a)+(35b)+(35d) and
L̇W = γW RW
(36a)
0 AW − (1 + LW )LW + K ū
such that K − LW ≥ 0; and the set of equilibria of (35a)+(35b)+(35d) and
L̇W = γW RW
0 AW − (1 + LW + LU )LW + KLU + K ū

(36b)

such that K − LW ≤ 0.
Consider first the system (35a)+(35b)+(36a)+(35d). As can be seen, the latter is decoupled, since
LU is not anymore present in the right-hand side of (36a). One shows without difficulty that there exists
a unique equilibrium in R4+ , which is LAS and characterized by


q
1
W
W
2
R0 − 1 + (R0 − 1) + 4K ū ,
(37)
LW =
2
provided that this expression verifies LW ≤ K. Another equilibrium exists, which is x0,0 if ū = 0, but
which has negative value of LW if ū > 0, and is therefore discarded, due to Lemma 14.
Consider now the second case, of system (35a)+(35b)+(36b)+(35d). Arguing as in the proof of
Theorem 10, the only equilibria that may exist are such that LU = 0. As a matter of fact, for a solution
with nonzero LU , a term K ū in the right-hand side of (29) could be written, jointly with KLU , as K 0 LU
for some K 0 ≥ K > K ∗ , leading therefore to LU = 0 and a contradiction. Therefore, any potential
equilibrium has to fulfill LU = 0, and the only possibility is given by (37) if this expression verifies
LW ≥ K.
Putting together the two cases, one sees that:
? there exist two equilibria, x0,0 and x0,W , if ū = 0;
? there exists a unique equilibrium if ū > 0.
? In any case, the corresponding output value is 0.
Now, for any constant input u(t) ≡ ū, system (35) is strongly order-preserving, just as system (6)
was shown to be (Theorem 5). Then, the uniqueness of equilibrium in the case where ū > 0 allows to
use (Smith, 1995, Theorem 2.3.1, p. 18) and to deduce that all trajectories in R4+ converge to this unique
equilibrium. When ū = 0, applying (Smith, 1995, Theorem 2.2.1, p. 17) shows that every trajectory
converges towards one of the two equilibria x0,0 and x0,W . The behavior of system (35) in the vicinity
of x0,0 obeys the equations
L̇W = γW RW
0 AW − (1 + LW )LW ,

ȦW = LW − γW AW .

This system is monotone and the projection of x0,W attracts all trajectories, except if LW (0) = 0 and
AW (0) = 0. This achieves the proof of Lemma 16.
One is now ready to achieve the proof of Theorem 12. We define y(t; x0 , u) the output of system
(35a)–(35d) corresponding to the input signal u and the initial state value x0 . For any trajectory of the
closed-loop system (25), we will denote indifferently u and y, in order to exploit the formalism of the
input-output decomposition given in (35).
First of all, recall that, due to Theorem 9, all trajectories of (25) are bounded. Therefore, for any
nonnegative initial condition x0 ,
0 ≤ lim inf y(t; x0 , u) ≤ lim sup y(t; x0 , u) < +∞
t→+∞

t→+∞

18

∀x0 ∈ R4+ .

(38)

Assume first
lim inf y(t; x0 , u) > 0 .

(39)

t→+∞

Using monotonicity of the input-output system to compare trajectories with different inputs, one obtains
from the fact that
∀ε > 0, ∃T > 0, t ≥ T ⇒ u(t) ≥ lim
inf u(t0 ) − ε ,

that

By putting together (38), (40) and (41), one gets:
0 < lim inf y(t; x0 , u) ≤ lim sup y(t; x0 , u) ≤ 0 ,
t→+∞

(42)

t→+∞

which is absurd. This shows consequently that the premise (39) was erroneous.
We thus have
lim inf y(t; x0 , u) = 0
t→+∞

(43)

for all trajectories. Assume
(LW (0), AW (0)) 6= (0, 0) .

(44)

As above, one can deduce that

0 ≤ lim inf y(t; x0 , u) ≤ lim sup y(t; x0 , u) ≤ lim sup y t; x0 , lim

and therefore that
lim y(t; x0 , u) = 0 .

(45)

t→+∞

Now Lemma 16 permits to deduce from (45) and (44) that
lim x(t; x0 , u) = x0,W .

(46)

t→+∞

On the other hand, if (44) is false but (LU (0), AU (0)) 6= (0, 0), then it is easy to show that
(LW (t), AW (t)) 6= (0, 0) for some t > 0 (and indeed for any t > 0). As a matter of fact, due to the
presence of the control term (which is continuous and initially positive), LW is certainly positive on a
sufficient small punctured open neighborhood of t = 0. This in turn yields the same property for AW ,
due to the linearity of its evolution. The analysis previously conducted in the case where (44) is true,
can therefore be applied in the present case (where (44) is false but (LU (0), AU (0)) 6= (0, 0)) from a new,
positive, initial time instant. It allows to conclude similarly that (45) and (46) hold.
As a conclusion, the convergence to x0,W occurs in any case, except if (LW (0), AW (0)) = (LU (0), AU (0))
= (0, 0), that is except if x(0) = x0,0 . This achieves the proof of Theorem 12.

Numerical simulations

We present some illustrative simulations, with the following realistic values:
γU = 0.8,

RU
0 = 5,

γW = 1,

RW
0 =3

Notice that the mortality is higher for the Wolbachia infected population (γU < γW ), and its sustainW
ability is inferior (RU
0 > R0 ). The critical gain value can be computed and is equal to
K ∗ ' 0.318
Figures 2 to 5 show the evolution of the state variables LU (in blue) and LW (in green) as functions
of time. The initial state is the Wolbachia-free equilibrium xU,0 , and the gain values are respectively
chosen to be 1, 0.5, 0.35 and 0.3. The last value, smaller than the critical value K ∗ , yields convergence
to a coexistence equilibrium.

Conclusions and further studies

We presented and analyzed a model for the infestation by bacterium Wolbachia of a population of
mosquitoes — typically one of the genera Aedes involved in the transmission of arboviroses such as
yellow fever, dengue fever or chikungunya. A method of implementation based on the introduction of
a quantity of contaminated insects proportional to the size of the healthy population was proposed and
shown, analytically and by simulation, to be capable to spread successfully the bacteria provided the
gain is sufficiently large. This feedback method requires continuous measurement of the population. Its
main interest with respect to the release(s) of a predefined quantity, is the reduction of the number of

Figure 5: Evolution of LU (t) and LW (t) as functions of time, for K = 1, K = 0.5, K = 0.35 and
K = 0.3. The last value is smaller than the critical value K ∗ ' 0.318, and a coexistence equilibrium
appears asymptotically

released mosquitoes, and thus of the treatment cost, without jeopardizing the success of the introduction
of the bacteria — something which can happen e.g. in case of underestimation of the initial population
size. To our knowledge, this is the first use of the control theory notion of feedback in such a context.
Among other steps leading to application, the adaptation to effective conditions has to be done. First,
the model presented here has been chosen continuous in time for simplicity, but passing to discrete-time
system seems to present a priori no difficulties. Also, the present framework assumes measurement of a
larva stage of the healthy portion of the population, and as well release of larva stage of the contaminated
21

one. The practical conditions can be different, and the method can be adapted in consequence (leading
though to similar, but different, convergence questions). Last, issues of robustness with respect to the
uncertainties of the parameters that describes the dynamics have not been tackled here.
An advantage of the present modeling framework is to open the way to comparisons with optimal
policies — for example the one that minimizes the total number of released mosquitoes, while succeeding
in spreading Wolbachia. This point will be studied in a next future. Also, this framework provides a
first basis to consider questions related to strategy improvement by mitigating several control principles,
or to the complex phenomena of interaction between different vector species and different arboviruses,
that may occur in the context of control of different diseases.
From a mathematical point of view, one of the difficulties of the study is that the system presents
two stable equilibria, corresponding to Wolbachia-free situation and complete infestation. While the
key arguments are based on the theory of input-output monotone systems developed after Angeli and
Sontag (2003), none of the posterior refinements to multivalued characteristics or quasi-characteristics
allowed to establish formally the main convergence result, and adequate adaptation had to be achieved.
Extensions in this direction are presently studied.
