Abstract
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been expanding its geographical distribution with important implications for both human and
animal health. The emergence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East, and its continuing presence in many areas of Africa,
has negatively impacted both medical and veterinary infrastructures and human morbidity, mortality, and economic endpoints.
Furthermore, worldwide attention should be directed towards the broader infection dynamics of RVFV, because suitable host,
vector and environmental conditions for additional epidemics likely exist on other continents; including Asia, Europe and the
Americas. We propose a new compartmentalized model of RVF and the related ordinary differential equations to assess disease
spread in both time and space; with the latter driven as a function of contact networks. Humans and livestock hosts and two
species of vector mosquitoes are included in the model. The model is based on weighted contact networks, where nodes of the
networks represent geographical regions and the weights represent the level of contact between regional pairings for each set
of species. The inclusion of human, animal, and vector movements among regions is new to RVF modeling. The movement
of the infected individuals is not only treated as a possibility, but also an actuality that can be incorporated into the model. We
have tested, calibrated, and evaluated the model using data from the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study;
mapping the epidemic spread within and among three South African provinces. An extensive set of simulation results shows the
potential of the proposed approach for accurately modeling the RVF spreading process in additional regions of the world. The
benefits of the proposed model are twofold: not only can the model differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals
among different provinces, but also it can reproduce the different starting times of the outbreak in multiple locations. Finally, the
exact value of the reproduction number is numerically computed and upper and lower bounds for the reproduction number are
analytically derived in the case of homogeneous populations.

1. Introduction
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis with enormous health and economic impacts on domestic animals and humans
[26], in countries where the disease is endemic and in others where sporadic epidemics and epizootics have occurred. An
outbreak in South Africa in 1951 was estimated to have infected 20, 000 people and killed 100, 000 sheep and cattle [12, 35].
In Egypt in 1977, there were 18, 000 human cases with 698 deaths resulting from the disease [12, 35]. While RVF is endemic
in Africa, it also represents a threat to Europe and Western hemispheres [7, 18]. In 1997 − 1998 Kenya experienced the largest
recorded outbreak with 89, 000 human cases and 478 death. The first recorded outbreak outside of Africa occurred in the Arabian
peninsula in 2000 − 2001 and caused 683 human cases and 95 deaths [17]. Tanzania and Somalia reported 1000 human cases
and 300 deaths from an outbreak that was associated with above-normal rainfall in the region in 2006 − 2007 [17]. Rift Valley
fever virus (RVFV) is generally distributed through regions of Eastern and Southern Africa where sheep and cattle are present
[42]. It can cause morbidity (ranging from nondescript fever to meningo-encephalitis and hemorrhagic disease) and mortality
(with case fatality rates of 0.2 − 5%) in humans [26]. The main economic losses of RVF in livestock arise due to abortion and
mortality, which tends to be higher in young animals [9, 42], and bans on livestock exports during an epidemic [9, 4].
Rift Valley fever virus was first isolated from the blood of a newborn lamb in 1931 and later from the blood of adult sheep
and cattle [44, 4]. Domestic ruminants and humans are among the mammalian hosts demonstrated to amplify RVFV [21] and

Aedes and Culex are believed to be the main arthropod vectors [7] . Rift Valley fever virus can be transferred vertically from
females to their eggs in some species of the Aedes mosquitoes [18, 27]. The disease has been shown to be endemic in semi-arid
zones, such as northern Senegal [45, 7, 28], and RVF epidemics often appears at 5 − 15 year cycles [28]. As noted earlier, RVFV
has already spread outside Africa, to Yemen and Saudi Arabia [7, 6]. The species of vectors that are capable of transmitting
RVFV have a wide global distribution [20] and there is therefore a distinct possibility for the virus to spread out of its currently
expanding geographic range [9]. A pathways analysis [21] has shown that the RVF virus might be introduced into the United
States in several different ways [21, 24] and that analysis identified several regions of the United States that are most susceptible
to RVFV introduction. It is therefore desirable to develop effective models to better understand the potential dynamics of RVF in
heretofore unaffected regions and then develop efficient mitigation strategies in case this virus appears in the Western hemisphere
[18]. Such preparedness can help avoid a rapid spread of the virus throughout North America, as happened with the West Nile
virus during the last decade [7, 18].
A RVF disease risk mapping model was developed by [1]. The authors observed sea surface temperature (SST) patterns,
cloud cover, rainfall, and ecological indicators (primarily vegetation) via satellite data to evaluate different aspects of climate
variability and their relationships to disease outbreaks in Africa and the Middle East [3, 2]. The researchers successfully predicted
areas where outbreaks of RVF in humans and animals were expected using climate data for the Horn of Africa from December
2006 to May 2007. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) mathematical model was developed by [18]. The model is both
an individual-based and deterministic model. The authors analyzed the stability of the model and tested the importance of the
model parameters. However, neither human population parameters nor spatial (or, network) aspects are explicitly incorporated
in the model. Another theoretical mathematical model on RVFV dynamic transmission was proposed [29]. This model is also an
individual based model. The most important parameters to initial disease transmission and the endemic equilibrium have been
carried out.
In this paper, we present a novel model incorporating Aedes and Culex mosquito vector, and livestock and human host
populations. Our model is based on weighted contact networks, where nodes of the networks represent geographical regions
and weights represent the level of contact between regional pairs for each vector or host species. Environmental factors such as
rainfall, temperature, wind and evaporation are incorporated into the model. For each subpopulation, a set of ordinary differential
equations describes the dynamics of the population in a specific geographical location, and the transitions among the different
compartments, after contracting the virus. We compute the lower and upper bounds of the reproduction number for homogeneous
populations, explain their biological meaning, and numerically compare the bounds with exact values.
We test, calibrate, and evaluate the model using the recent 2010 RVF outbreak in South Africa as a case study, mapping the
epidemic spread in three South African provinces: Free State, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape. An extensive set of simulation
results shows the potential of the proposed approach to accurately describe the spatialtemporal evolution of RVF epidemics.
The paper is organized as follows: 1) in Section 2, we describe our compartmentalized mathematical model, present the
lower bound and upper bound of the reproduction number for homogeneous populations. 2) in Section 3, we introduce the case
study using outbreak data from South Africa, 2010, 3) in Section 4, we conclude our work. In the Appendix, we show how we
derive the bounds for the reproduction number for homogeneous populations.
2. Compartmentalized Mathematical Model
We have constructed Compartmentalized Mathematical Models based on the principle of RVFV transmission. The parameters used in the model are shown in Table 1.
2.1. Homogeneous Populations Model
The principle of RVFV transmission between different species is shown in Figure 1. All the Aedes ssp. and Culex spp. we are
going to discuss only include the mosquitoes that are competent vectors of Rift Valley fever. In this paper, the Culex parameters
are based on Culex Tarsalis mosquitoes and Aedes parameters are based on Ae. dorsalis mosquitoes. The main vectors, Aedes
and Culex mosquitoes and the main hosts, livestock and humans are considered in the model. We use an SEI compartmental
model in which individuals are either in a susceptible (S) state, an exposed (E) state, or an infected state (I) for both Aedes and
Culex mosquitoes, and an SEIR compartmental model in which individuals are either in a susceptible (S) state, an exposed (E)
state, an infected state (I), or a recovered (R) state for both livestock and human populations. Infectious Aedes mosquitoes can
not only transmit RVFV to susceptible livestock and humans but also to their own eggs [18, 27]. Culex mosquitoes acquire the
virus during blood meals on an infected animal and then amplify the transmission of RVFV through blood meals on livestock
and humans [44]. Direct ruminant-to-human contact is the major (though not only) way for humans to acquire the infection
[1, 11]. Accidental RVFV infections have been recorded in laboratory staff handling blood and tissue from infected animals
[1]. Usually, humans are thought of as dead end hosts that do not contribute significantly to propagation of the epidemic [7].
There has been no direct human-to-human transmission of RVFV in field conditions recorded thus far [21]. The mosquitoes
will not spontaneously recover once they become infectious [18]. Livestock and humans either perish from the infection or
recover [18]. All four species have a specified incubation period [44]. The model is based on a daily time step. Aedes and Culex

mosquitoes are distributed among susceptible S a , exposed Ea and infected Ia compartments. The subscript a = 1 denotes Aedes
and a = 3 denotes Culex . The size of each adult mosquito population is N1 = S 1 + E1 + I1 for adult Aedes mosquitoes and
N3 = S 3 + E3 + I3 for adult Culex mosquitoes. The livestock and human hosts contain susceptible S b , exposed Eb , infected Ib
and recovered Rb individuals. The subscript b = 2 and b = 4 denote livestock and humans respectively. The size of host populations is Nb = S b + Eb + Ib +Rb . The four populations are modeled with a specified carrying capacity K1 , K2 , K3 , K4 respectively.

The above model is a modified SEI model with compartments P and Q. Compartments P and Q represent uninfected eggs
and infected eggs respectively. The total number of eggs laid each day is b1 N1 with b1 q1 I1 infected eggs and b1 N1 − b1 q1 I1 uninfected eggs [18]. After development period, θ1 P1 develop into susceptible adult mosquitoes and θ1 Q1 develop into infected adult
mosquitoes [18]. There are d1 X1 N1 /K1 mosquitoes removed from compartment X due to natural death. Compartment X can be
P, Q, S, E, and I here. The number of Aedes mosquitoes infected by livestock is denoted by β21 S 1 I2 /N2 which is proportional to
the density of infected Aedes mosquitoes [18]. After incubation period, ε1 E1 Aedes mosquitoes transfer to infected compartment
[18].

Besides compartment S , E, I, compartment P is added to represent uninfected eggs. Only uninfected eggs are included because the female Culex mosquitoes do not transmit RVFV vertically [18]. The total number of eggs laid each day is b3 N3 . There
are d3 X3 N3 /K3 Culex mosquitoes removed due to natural death. Compartment X can be P, S, E, and I here. After development
period, θ3 P3 eggs develop into susceptible adult Culex mosquitoes and become secondary vectors [18]. The number of infected
Culex mosquitoes from contact with livestock is denoted by β23 S 3 I2 /N2 which is proportional to the percentage of infected livestock [18]. After incubation period, ε3 E3 Culex mosquitoes transfer from exposed compartment to infected compartment [18].

There are b4 N4 humans born, d4 X4 N4 /K4 humans removed from compartment X due to natural death, and µ4 I4 humans
dying of RVFV infection each day. Compartment X can be S, E, I, and R here. The number of humans that acquire the infection
from Aedes mosquitoes, Culex mosquitoes, and livestock is β14 S 4 I1 /N1 , β34 S 4 I3 /N3 , and f β24 S 4 I2 /N2 respectively. We assume
only those who work with animals can be infected by animals. Therefore, a coefficient f (0 < f < 1) which represents the
fraction of humans working with animals is multiplied by β24 S 4 I2 /N2 . After incubation period, ε4 E4 humans transfer to infected
compartment and γ4 I4 humans transfer to recovered compartment after infection period.

2.1.5. Environmental Parameters for Culex
The equation (22) is used to model the development rate of Culex mosquitoes [19]. The daily egg laying rate expressed in
equation (23) is a function of moisture [19]. Moisture in equation (24) is obtained by summing the difference of precipitation
[30] and evaporation (mm) [25] over the proceeding 7 days [19]. In the equations (22) to (25), A, HA, HH, K, T H, Emax , Evar ,
Emean , b0 are parameters [19] which are described in Table 2. This model is specific for West Nile virus model in 2010 in the
northern US.

2.1.6. The Reproduction Number for Homogeneous Populations
The reproduction number R0 is defined as: “ The average number of secondary cases arising from an average primary case
in an entirely susceptible population” [14]. The reproduction number is used to predict whether the epidemic will spread or die
out. There are several methods used to compute R0 . One of these methods computes the reproduction number as the spectral
radius [14? ] of the next generation matrix [14? ].
The next generation matrix is defined as FV −1 , and the matrices F and V are determined as:
F=[

∂Fi (x0 )
∂Vi (x0 )
], V = [
]
∂x j
∂x j

where x j is the number or proportion of infected individuals in compartment j, j = 1, 2, 3, ... , m, m being the total number of
infected compartments, x0 is the disease free equilibrium vector, Fi is the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment
i, and Vi = Vi − − Vi + with Vi − denoting the transfer of individuals out of compartment i and Vi + denoting the rate of transfer
of individuals into compartment i [16]. The (i, j) entry of F represents the rate at which infected individuals in compartment j
produce infected individuals in compartment i [16]. The ( j, k) entry of V −1 represents the average time that an individual spends
in compartment j, where i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, ... , m [16]. Finally, the (i, k) entry of FV −1 represents the expected number of infected
individuals in compartment i produced by the infected individuals in compartment k [16].

2.2. Meta-Population Model
A meta-population model is a model with several subpopulations. It assumes homogeneity within each subpopulation and
heterogeneity among different subpopulations. The Aedes and Culex mosquitoes in location i (i = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n), are distributed
among susceptible S ai , exposed Eai and infected Iai compartments. The subscript a = 1 denotes Aedes and a = 3 denotes Culex .
The size of each adult mosquito population in location i is N1i = S 1i + E1i + I1i for adult Aedes mosquitoes and N3i = S 3i + E3i + I3i
for adult Culex mosquitoes. The livestock and human hosts contain susceptible S bi , exposed Ebi , infected Ibi and recovered Rbi
individuals. The subscript b = 2 and b = 4 denote the livestock and humans, respectively. The size of host populations in
location i is N2i = S 2i + E2i + I2i + R2i for livestock hosts and N4i = S 4i + E4i + I4i + R4i for human hosts. The four populations
are modeled with a specified carrying capacity K1 , K2 , K3 , K4 respectively.
2.2.1. Movement between Nodes
We used weighted networks for each compartment of the four species as is shown in Figure 2. The superscripts of ω on the
left hand side of equations (28), (29), and (31) represent the movement of different species. The number ’1’ in the superscript
means the movement of Aedes or Culex population, ’2’ means the livestock movement, and ’3’ means the human movement in
the superscript. The subscript i j of ωi j means that the direction of the movement is from location i to location j. The difference
in the thickness of the lines represent the difference in weight. Thicker lines represent the larger weight. The weight for each
population is between 0 and 1. RVFV has been documented to be spread by wind [35]. Wind dispersal of mosquitoes has
changed geographic distribution and accelerated the spread of RVFV to new geographic areas [21]. Some locations can become
secondary epidemic sites after the virus has been introduced (especially in irrigated areas, e.g. Gazeera in Sudan or rice valleys in
the center of Madagascar) [28]. Livestock trade and transport also can affect the geographic distribution of RVF [7]. One critical
objective in developing effective models is to determine the major factors involved in the disease spreading process. Therefore,
we parameterize the weight due to mosquito movement with wind [21, 8], livestock movement due to transportation to feedlots
or trade centers [40], and human mobility due to commuting [5] as shown in equations (28), (29), and (31), respectively. The
movement rate of infected livestock is reduced due to infection [44]. We use the wind data [41] in Bloemfontein, which is the
capital of Free State, as the wind of Free State Province, that of Kimberley, which is the capital of Northern Cape, as the wind of
Northern Cape Province and that of Grahams town, which is the center of Eastern Cape Province, as the wind of Eastern Cape
Province. The distance vector is calculated with longitude and latitude in the center of each location. The number of animals sold
[37] and the number of livestock in the feedlots [34] are factors of weight for livestock movement. Distance, human population,
commuting rate, and return rate [39] affect the weight for human movement. Weight for mosquito movement is decided by
distance and the projection of wind in the direction of distance vector [8].

3. Case Study: South Africa 2010
We have used data from the South African RVF outbreak in 2010 as a case study.
3.1. Incidence Data Analysis
Outbreak data for animals are obtained from [15, 43], while outbreak data for human subpopulations are collected from
[13, 31]. As far as animal data is concerned, we chose to analyze RVF incidence in the sheep population. Because the granularity
of human incidence data is provided at Province level, each node in the network represents a province. We selected three
provinces: Free State (location 1), Northern Cape (location 2) and Eastern Cape (location 3), because they had the highest levels
of RVF incidence for humans. The curves of the incidence data are shown in Figure 3 using green histograms, while the red
curves represent simulations obtained with our model. From the data in Figure 3, it is possible to observe that the epidemic
started first in the Free State Province and later in Northern Cape Province. The sustained heavy rainfall likely triggered the
outbreak, causing infected eggs to hatch in the Free State Province. Additionally, the number of animal and human cases in
Eastern Cape Province is smaller than the other two provinces.
3.2. Sensitivity Analysis
The three parameters c1 , c2 and c3 are estimated using the least square approach, which is based on minimization of errors
between the incidence data of humans and the percentage of humans calculated by the mathematical model. At first, we establish
an objective function. At each sample time, we calculate the difference between the number of humans calculated by differential
equations and that reported [36] during outbreaks in three provinces of South Africa from January, 2010. We calculate the square
of each difference. Then, we add all the squares for each location in each day together to obtain the objective function as is shown
below. Minimization of the objective function is initiated by providing initial values c10 , c20 and c30 for each parameter. The
differential equations are solved with each set of the parameters and the square errors between the number of infected humans
obtained from the objective function and those from incidence data are calculated. The parameters c1 , c2 and c3 we used in the
model are c1 = 0.009, c2 = 0.05 and c3 = 0.005.

In the equations above,
n = the number of nodes
t0 =starting time
t f =end time
I4i (t) =human prevalence calculated by the model
PR4i (t) =human prevalence reported
To conduct a sensitivity analysis of the parameters c1 , c2 , and c3 in equations (28), (29), and (31), we have changed each
parameter within ±10% of the values c1 = 0.009, c2 = 0.05 and c3 = 0.005, keeping the other parameters constant. This analysis
allows an evaluation of the impact of uncertainties in the parameter estimations. The percentage of infected humans obtained
from simulation with c1 = 0.009, c2 = 0.05 and c3 = 0.005 is represented as IOi (t). The percentage of infected human obtained
from simulation with the parameters within ±10% bound is represented as I4i (t). The relative errors between the fractions of

infected humans are calculated for each set of parameters, in each location, at time t as | I4i (t)−I
I4i (t)
lower bound and upper bound of the parameters are shown in Figure 4.
All the values of relative errors shown in Figure 4 are smaller than 10%, proving the model robustness with respect to limited
uncertainties in the parameter estimation. The rest of the parameters such as contact rate β12 , β21 , β23 , β32 , death rate d1 , d3
and recovery rate γ2 are the most significant parameters in [18]. Similarly, β14 , β24 , β34 and γ4 are also the most significant
parameters in this model.
3.3. Analysis of Simulation Results
To explore the behavior of RVFV, we conducted numerical simulations of an open system considering movement of the
four species among different locations. To test the validity of the model, we changed some parameters in the weights to see
the impact of each variation. If the number of infected eggs Q11 = 10, Q12 = 0, and Q13 = 0, at the beginning infected eggs
only exist in location 1, Free State. However, our model considers movement of mosquitoes to other locations with wind. As a
consequence, infected animals and humans appear in all three locations as is shown in Figure 5. Therefore, the infection spreads
due to movement of the four populations.

If we also assume that at the beginning infected eggs only exist in location 1, Q11 = 10, Q12 = 0 and Q13 = 0, and movements
of the four species from one location to another are not allowed, c1 = 0, c2 = 0, and c3 = 0, then infected animals and humans
will not appear in location 2 and location 3 as is shown in Figure 6. We can test the mitigation strategy of movement ban with
this model. We performed the simulations to reproduce the RVF outbreak in the three South African Provinces. The simulation
results and the incidence data are shown in Figure 3. The model can differentiate the maximum number of infected individuals
among the three different provinces, it also reproduces the different starting time of the outbreak in the three locations. With a
homogeneous population model, such as the one in [18], the spatial differentiation is not possible.
The animal incidence curves provided by the model were always an overestimation of the data, since underreporting is
very common during outbreaks. Finally, our approach in which the fractions of each subpopulation in each compartment are
expressed as continuous variables, requires a large number of cases to be accurate. For this reason, the incidence data for location
3, Eastern Cape, are better approximated by a stochastic model. The model has shown the ability of fitting the data. The starting
time and trend of outbreak dynamics have been reproduced by the model.
4. Conclusions
A meta-population, network-based, deterministic RVF model is presented here. The animal, human and mosquito movement
and their spatial distribution are considered by the model. The model successfully describes a real outbreak dynamics of RVFV,
taking into account space and movement. When considering n locations or nodes (n >= 1), there are 21 ∗ n differential equations
and 21 ∗ n variables in our model, while there are only 14 equations with 14 variables in the model presented in [29] and 16 equations with 16 variables presented in [18]. Greater accuracy of our model is obtained at the cost of an increased complexity. The
novelty of our model is that it considers a weighted contact network to represent the movement of four species. Subpopulations at
the node level are also incorporated in our model. Additionally, parameters representing mosquito propagation and development
are not constant but are the functions of climate factors. The model has been evaluated using data from the recent outbreak in
South Africa. We reproduced not only the starting time but also the trend of RVFV transmission with time in different locations.

The model has shown to be very promising notwithstanding the limitation of the data. Due to the flexibility and accuracy of
the proposed model, we can test and design multiple and different mitigation strategies in different locations at different times.
The lower bound and upper bound of the reproduction number for homogeneous populations are shown to be very close to the
exact value, and they provide insights on the biology of the spreading process. Future work in follow-up mathematical models
includes the development of a stochastic model, the study of the impact of climate changes on the epidemiology and control of
RVF, and the improvement of the mosquito movement model considering diffusion equations. Moreover, the carrying capacities
of mosquitoes will be considered dependent on climate factors in the future.

Appendix
Exact Computation of R0
We compute R0 as the spectral radius of the next generation matrix of the entire system [14, 29], R0 = ρ(FV −1 ). Before
applying the method we need to verify that the five assumptions in [16] are satisfied [23]. First, the equations in the system are
reordered so that the first m (m = 9) compartments correspond to infected individuals.

As it can been easily seen, the following five assumptions [16] are satisfied.
(A1) if x > 0, then Fi , Vi + , Vi − > 0 for i = 1, ..., 17.
(A2) if xi = 0, then Vi − = 0; in particular, if x ∈ X s , then Vi − = 0 for i = 1, ..., 9.
(A3) Fi = 0 if i > 9; there are no new infections in uninfected compartments.

(A4) if x ∈ X s , then Fi (x) = 0 and Vi + (x) = 0 for i = 1, ..., 9.
(A5) if F (x) is set to 0, then all eigenvalues of D f (x0 ) have negative real parts.
To construct the next generation matrix, we only consider infected and exposed compartments. The equations are transformed as follows.

Because B1C1 E1 = A1C1 F1 as shown in Equation (78) and (77) , equation (76) can be rewritten as follows.
−λ6 [λ3 − A1 λ2 − (C1 F1 + J1 H1 )λ + H1 A1 J1 ] = 0

(79)

Equation (79) has six zero roots. We only need to solve the following equation to find max |λi | (i = 1, 2, 3).
λ3 − A1 λ2 − (C1 F1 + J1 H1 )λ + H1 A1 J1 = 0

We calculate the reproduction number numerically with 5000 different sets of parameters uniformly distributed within the range
in [18]. The histogram of the reproduction number is shown in Figure 7. From the histogram, we can see that R0 can be greater
or smaller than 1. In particular, the mean is 1.17 and the maximum is 3.68, respectively.

B is the first matrix and C is the second matrix. The matrix C has three multiple eigenvalues λ2 = λ3 = λ4 = 0. Since
Rank (λi I − C)|λ2 =λ3 =λ4 =0 = 1, there are three linear independent eigenvectors corresponding to zero eigenvalue. Overall, matrix
C has four linear independent eigenvectors. Therefore, matrix C can be diagonalized as follows.

Matrix Y is a 4 × 4 nonnegative diagonal matrix (Yi j = 0 for i , j) and 0 6 Yii < q1 = max j v j j < ∞, (i = 2, 3, 4), and matrix
X is nonnegative. Therefore, ρ(X) 6 ρ(X + Y) 6 ρ(X) + q1 according to Theorem 1. in [10]. The eigenvalues of matrix X + Y

R0H and R0H + q1 are the lower bound and the upper bound of R0 , respectively. Therefore, R0H + q1 < 1 ⇒ R0 < 1, and
> 1 ⇒ R0 > 1. To verify that the derived bounds are tight, we perform extensive simulations using 5000 sets of parameters

0 = R0 + q1 vs. R0 and R0 = R0 vs. R0 are
plotted, respectively. First, the difference between the exact values and each bound is very small. In fact, the red and green points
lay very close to the line y = x. Additionally, in the case of the upper bound, the red points are just slightly above the line y = x,
while in the case of the lower bound, the green points are just slightly below the line y = x.

Biological Interpretation of Bounds for R0
The bounds for R0 , as given in inequalities (26), can be interpreted biologically as follows. The lower bound, R0H , is the
reproduction number for horizontal transmission because R0H = ρ (F H VH−1 ), where ρ (F H VH−1 ) represents the spectral radius of
the next generation matrix for horizontal transmission F H VH−1 . The upper bound is given by the sum of R0H and a second term
that is only related to vertical transmission, i.e. from mothers to their offspring in the Aedes mosquito population.
R0H includes Aedes-livestock interaction and Culex-livestock interaction. More specifically, we define the reproduction number due to the interaction between Aedes and livestock represented by R0H(A−L) as
s
R0H(A−L)

=

(b2 + ε2 )(b2 + γ2 + µ2 ) b1 (b1 + ε1 )

R0H(A−L) consists of the product of four terms. Each infected Aedes mosquito can infect
its lifetime. Similarly, each infected livestock can infect

infections produced by one Aedes mosquito vector in the first square bracket in (83), and the average number of secondary Aedes

s
R0H(C−L) =

vector in the first square bracket in (84), and the average number of secondary Culex mosquito vector infections produced by
one livestock in the second square bracket in (84).
q
The expression (27) for R0H , can be rewritten as R0H =

(R0H(A−L) )2 + (R0H(C−L) )2 , where the dependence of R0H on R0H(A−L)

and R0H(C−L) is shown in Figure 9. The square root is due to the vector-host-vector viral transmission path [18? , 33]. Obviously,
the horizontal reproduction number increases with the increase of each of the four terms in R0H(A−L) and R0H(C−L) .
