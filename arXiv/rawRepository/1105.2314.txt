Abstract
Red blood cells (RBCs) are a major component of blood clots, which form physiologically as
a response to injury or pathologically in thrombosis. The active participation of RBCs in
thrombus solidification has been previously proposed but not yet experimentally proven.
Holographic optical tweezers and single-cell force spectroscopy were used to study potential
cell-cell adhesion between RBCs. Irreversible intercellular adhesion of RBCs could be
induced by stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a compound known to be released
by activated platelets. We identified Ca2+ as an essential player in the signaling cascade by
directly inducing Ca2+ influx using A23187. Elevation of the internal Ca2+ concentration leads
to an intercellular adhesion of RBCs similar to that induced by LPA stimulation. Using
single-cell force spectroscopy, the adhesion of the RBCs was identified to be approximately
100 pN, a value large enough to be of significance inside a blood clot or in pathological
situations like the vasco-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease patients.

Keywords: blood clot; calcium signaling; lysophosphatidic acid; red blood cells; single-cell

Introduction
Previous studies of the interactions between red blood cells (RBCs) have relied either on
hydrodynamic interactions [1] or interactions mediated by plasma macromolecules. Coadhesion of RBCs under physiological conditions is known as rouleaux formation. These
structures might be generated either by plasma polymers bridging between the cells [2, 3] or,
more likely, by depletion forces. The adhesion energies are small enough to allow for
breakage in the shear flow, and the effect is thought to be reversible, even if some
controversial data exist [4]. This reversibility is crucial for the ability of RBCs to cross
capillary sections that are smaller than the cell diameter. However, in several pathologies,
such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, an increased propensity for red blood cell-cell
adhesion has been observed [5]. Clot formation is a collective phenomenon based on the
interplay of many components. In current models, the contribution of RBCs to the clotting
process is thought to be purely passive, i.e., they are simply caged in the fibrin network due to
their prevalence in the blood. Based on experimental and clinical studies that have shown a
correlation between decreased hematocrit values and longer bleeding times [6-8] and their
own experiments, Andrews and Low summarized the evidence for active participation of
RBCs in thrombus formation. Kaestner et al. [9] proposed a signaling mechanism based on
Ca2+ entry via a nonselective voltage-dependent cation (NSVDC) channel that is permeable to
mono- and bivalent cations like Na+, K+ and Ca2+ [10, 11]. This channel has been shown to be
activated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [9, 12] and by the
mechanical deformations that occur when RBCs pass through capillaries smaller than their
resting diameter [13]. PGE2 and LPA are extracellular, local mediators that are released both
by platelets after their activation within the coagulation cascade and by RBCs themselves
under mechanical Ca2+ stress [14]. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that
intercellular RBC adhesion can occur directly (without participation of platelets). To perform
this at the level of individual cells, we used the complementary methods of non-invasive
holographic optical tweezers (HOT) [15], using the momentum of light and single-cell force
spectroscopy to quantify the occurring adhesion.

Materials and methods
RBC preparation and fluorescence microscopy
For experiments using the optical tweezers and microfluidics, fresh blood from healthy
donors was obtained by a fingertip needle prick, while for annexinV-FITC fluorescence
measurements, human venous blood was drawn from healthy donors. Heparin or EDTA was
used as an anticoagulant. The blood was obtained within one day of the experiment from the
Institute of Clinical Haematology and Transfusion Medicine of the Saarland University
Hospital. The cells were washed three times by centrifugation (2000 g, 3 min) in a HEPES
buffered solution of physiological ionic strength (PIS-solution) containing the following (in
mM): 145 NaCl, 7.5 KCl, 10 glucose and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, at room temperature. The buffy
3

Steffen et al.

coat and plasma were removed by aspiration. For Ca2+ imaging, RBCs were loaded with 5
µM Fluo-4 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) from a 1 mM stock solution in Dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) with 20% Pluronic (F-127, Molecular Probes). Loading was performed in
1 mL of PIS-solution at an RBC haematocrit of approximately 1% for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells
were washed by centrifugation once more and equilibrated for de-esterification for 15 min.
LPA, prepared from a stock solution of 1 mM in distilled water, and the Ca2+ ionophore
A23187, prepared from a stock solution of 1 mM in ethanol, were obtained from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). To investigate phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cells were stained
with annexinV-FITC (Molecular Probes). Annexin V-FITC was delivered in a unit size of 500
µL containing 25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and 0.1% bovine serum
albumin. Five hundred microliters of annexin binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) was added to 1 µL of washed, packed RBCs previously treated with
LPA or A23187. Afterwards, 5 µL annexin V-FITC was added, and the cells were mixed
gently. The probes were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min and then
washed 2 times in 1 mL of annexin binding buffer (2000 g, 3 min). Finally, the cells were resuspended in 500 µL of annexin binding buffer and used for microscopy. The measurements
were obtained from images taken with a CCD camera (CCD97, Photometrics, USA).

Holographic optical tweezers (HOT)
A schematic drawing of our experimental setup is shown in supplemental Fig. S1a. A
Nd:YAG infrared laser (Ventus, Laser Quantum, Stockport, UK) with a beam width of 2.5
mm was coupled for coarse alignment with a visible He-Ne laser via a dichroic mirror. The
latter was switched off during the experiments. Both beams were expanded five-fold (BM.X,
Linos Photonics, Göttingen, Germany) to overfill the 8 mm back aperture of the microscope
objective (CFI Plan Fluor 60x oil immersion, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The optics were
integrated into an inverted fluorescence microscope (TE-2000, Nikon Corp.). This allowed for
combined trapping and fluorescence or differential interference contrast (DIC) measurements.
Images were taken with an electron multiplication CCD camera (Cascade 512F, Roper
Scientific, Trenton, USA) with a typical frame rate of 100 Hz. To reduce vibrations, the
original cooling fan was replaced with water-cooling components. In addition, the optical
setup was placed on active vibration isolation elements (Vario Series, Halcyonics, Göttingen,
Germany). The phase of the laser's electric field was modified using a spatial light modulator
(PPM X8267-15, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) to create the desired trap
pattern in the focal plane of the microscope objective. In order to test for RBC adhesion after
stimulation, a suitable configuration of independently movable optical traps was created (see
the schematic sketch in Fig. 1a ). The laser power in each trap was approximately 5 mW.
Cells could be moved against one another by replaying a series of kinoforms on the computercontrolled spatial light modulator. As an example, supplemental Fig. S1b shows a quadrotrap
in parallel and perpendicular configuration for RBC arrangement along with the
corresponding kinoforms.

Microfluidics
In order to provide a controlled yet interchangeable solvent environment, a microfluidic
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cell was constructed by standard soft lithography (inset in Fig.
2). The cell consists of two inlets from which either the cells in the buffer solutions or LPA or
the ionophore A23187 (final concentration of 40 µM) could be applied. The flow was driven
by a hydrostatic pressure difference that allowed for fine tuning. After injection of a new
sample, the flow could be brought approximately to rest by eliminating the pressure
difference. Behind the y-junction, the flow remained laminar, and the two solutions did not
mix, except for very slow diffusion. The RBCs could then be captured by the HOT and
transferred to the new environment. Thus, the cells could be transferred from one solvent
condition to another in a rapid and controlled manner. The same measurements were also
conducted in a Petri dish as follows: RBCs were incubated for 10 min with either A23187 or
LPA in the presence of Ca2+ (for concentration values, please refer to the figure legends),
followed by a fast sequence of adhesion tests between various cells. There were more than 50
cells in each experiment; the total number of tested cells amounted to 250.

Single-cell force spectroscopy
In order to quantify the occurring cell-cell adhesion, an atomic force microscope (AFM)
(CellHesion 200 with increased pulling range up to 100 µm, JPK Instruments, Germany) was
used to conduct single-cell force spectroscopy measurements. In these measurements, a single
RBC was attached to an AFM cantilever with the help of an appropriate adhesive. Cell-TakTM
(BD Biosciences) turned out to be the most efficient adhesive for binding RBCs to the
cantilever. A stock solution of 2.4 mg/mL was diluted 1:30 according to instructions from
BD. The cantilevers were incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature and used after
rinsing with PIS solution. After the cell capture (CellTakTM functionalized cantilevers brought
in contact with a 0.2 nN force for 10 s), the approach- and retraction speed were set to 5 µm/s.
The pulling range varied between 30 and 50 µm, and the contact time varied from 0 to 120 s.
During spectroscopy experiments, the deflection of the cantilever was monitored in real time
using a built-in feature of the AFM software. The spring constant of the cantilever was
determined by the common thermal noise method. The cantilevers used were tipples TL1 with
a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N/m (Nanoworld). The cell morphology was monitored
using phase contrast microscopy. In the course of the experiment, the cantilever with the
attached cell was lowered onto another cell attached to the substrate, which was coated with
0.005% Poly-L-Lysine, until a preset defined constant force was reached and kept stationary
for a defined contact time. The conditions during contact were determined by the choice of
the particular closed-loop mode, specifically at a constant piezo position, after reaching a
prescribed maximum pushing force of 400 pN. Subsequently, the cantilever was withdrawn at
a constant speed. During approach and retraction, the cantilever deflected as a consequence of
the acting forces. This deflection, which is proportional to the acting forces, was recorded in
force-distance curves. The retraction curve was typically characterized by the maximum force
required to separate the cells from each other, referred to as the maximum unbinding force
Fmax.

Statistical significance
A Student's t-test was used to test the results obtained from the adhesion experiments for
statistical significance. Statistical significance of the data were defined as follows: p > 0.05
(n.s.), p ≤ 0.05 (*); p ≤ 0.01 (**), p ≤ 0.001 (***).

Results
Red blood cell stimulation with LPA
As pointed out in the Introduction, RBCs can be stimulated by LPA, and this has been
proposed to contribute to the active participation of RBCs in the later stage of thrombus
formation. In order to test for altered intercellular adhesion behavior, we set up holographic
optical tweezers (for details, refer to supplemental Fig. S1). In the blood flow, cell-cell
contact times are rather short when RBCs "bump" into each other. To mimic this
physiological condition, two cells were grabbed with the laser foci (compare Fig. 1c) and
moved back and forth as depicted in Fig. 1a and supplemental movie SM1, in a cyclical
manner. Upon stimulation with 2.5 µM LPA, the RBCs adhered to each other as plotted and
visualized in an image sequence in Figs. 1b and 1c, respectively (the movie is available in the
supplemental material.) During the stimulation procedure, most of the RBCs remained in their
discocyte shape. The separation force could not be determined by the HOT approach because
it exceeds the force of the laser tweezers. In this configuration, 72 % of the cells tested
showed such an irreversible adhesion (grey bars in Fig. 2b). To exclude any dependencies on
the interaction surface due to the anisotropic shape of the cells, we aimed for another
condition using spherocytes. This was realized by increasing the LPA concentration to 10
µM, which is still within the physiologically observed range. In parallel to the adhesion
experiments, the Ca2+ uptake of the cells was followed up by Fluo-4 imaging, as the trace in
Fig. 2a shows for the stimulation with LPA. Additionally, a microfluidic system,
schematically plotted as an inset in Fig. 2a, allowed a fast change of media by moving the
RBCs using the holographic optical tweezers from one "channel" to the other. In this way, we
tested cells under five different conditions: (i) PIS-solution, (ii) PIS-solution containing 2 mM
Ca2+ and 10 µM LPA, (iii) PIS-solution containing 2 mM Ca2+ and 2.5 µM LPA, (iv) PISsolution containing 2 mM Ca2+ and no LPA, and finally (v) PIS-solution containing 2 mM
EDTA and 10 µM LPA. We used at least 60 cells per condition. The results are summarized
in Fig. 2b. The RBC stimulation with LPA (2.5 µM as well as 10 µM) in the presence of
extracellular Ca2+ led to an immediate qualitative change in the adhesion behavior: cells
irreversibly stuck to each other. Additionally, RBCs were stained with an annexinV-FITC
conjugate to probe for phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure of the RBCs by means of
fluorescence microscopy. In Fig. 2c, we show that the 2.5 µM LPA-induced Ca2+ influx
indeed was associated with PS transport from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the RBC
membrane. This staining was not observed in cells treated with conditions (i), (iv) and (v).

Approaching the signaling entities
The initial stimulation experiments using LPA revealed that an LPA-induced Ca2+ influx
leads to intercellular RBC adhesion. To test whether this is a pure Ca2+ effect or if the
presence of LPA is required, experiments were performed using the Ca2+ ionophore A23187
as an artificial tool to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. After transferring the Fluo4 loaded RBCs to the A23187 solution, the Fluo-4 fluorescence signal increased almost
immediately, i.e., faster than after application with LPA. The Ca2+ influx into the cell is
depicted in Fig. 3a. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, during the Ca2+ increase, the cells undergo a
shape transformation from discocytes to spherocytes via an intermediate step of echinocytes.
Testing for adhesion was performed using a procedure identical to the LPA experiments
performed in the following four media: (i) PIS-solution, (ii) PIS-solution containing 2 mM
Ca2+ and 40 µM A23187, (iii) PIS-solution containing 2 mM Ca2+ and no A23187, and (iv)
PIS-solution containing 2 mM EDTA and 40 µM A23187. The results are summarized in Fig.
3c. Intercellular adhesion was significantly increased compared to the controls only when the
intracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased. There have been controversial reports about
PS transition to the outer membrane leaflet that claim merely coincidental increase in Ca2+
that is not related to the PS exposure [16, 17]. Therefore, RBCs were stained with annexin-VFITC conjugates in order to visualize PS exposure on the surface of RBCs. As depicted in
Fig. 3d, treatment with A23187 in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ leads to a clear annexinV binding (PS staining) on the outer leaflet of the membranes. Under all the other conditions
(i), (iii), and (iv), no such staining could be observed.

Quantification of the intracellular adhesion
To allow a discussion of a physiological (or pathophysiological) relevance of the described
adhesion process, one needs to determine the separation force. As described above, the
separation force exceeds the abilities of the HOT. Therefore, single-cell force spectroscopy
[18] was utilized for determination of the force. Two different measurements were conducted:
control measurements in which the cells remained untreated and measurements in which the
cells were treated with a concentration of 2.5 µM LPA. Example curves for both experiments
are depicted in Fig. 4b. It is an inherent part of the single-cell force spectroscopy procedure
that cells need to be brought in contact by a certain force application (step 2 in Fig. 4a). In the
control measurements, it was only possible to detect a weak interaction between the cells,
whereas in the LPA measurements, a pronounced adhesion of the red blood cells could be
observed. The step-wise release plotted in Fig. 4b (step 3 in Fig. 4a) was typical for all the
cells measured. All results of the measurements are collected into histograms summarized in
Figs. 4c and 4d. The mean value of the maximum unbinding force of untreated red blood cells
amounted to 28.8 ± 8.9 pN (s.d.) (n=71), whereas in the LPA experiments, the mean value of
the maximum unbinding force amounted to a much higher value of 100 ± 84 pN (s.d.)
(n=193, from three different donors) indicating a severe difference in adhesion behavior of
untreated and LPA-stimulated RBCs.

Discussion
LPA stimulation leads to intercellular adhesion
It is an established fact that the stimulation of RBCs with LPA leads to a Ca2+ influx through
an NSVDC channel [9, 12]. It is further known that the increased intracellular Ca2+ results in
the stimulation of the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (Gardos channel) [19, 20] and the activation
of the lipid scramblase [21, 22] (see below for further discussion). Based on these
mechanisms, an increased aggregation tendency of stimulated RBCs has been hypothesized
[9, 23]. The development of the HOT provides a tool for testing this hypothesis at the cellular
level. Concentrations of 2.5 µM and 10 µM LPA were chosen because they seemed to be
within the common range of concentrations used with other cell types [24, 25] in addition to
RBCs [17]. Moreover, this concentration is comparable to the local LPA concentration in the
immediate surroundings of activated platelets, e.g., inside a blood clot [26, 27]. While the
choice of the LPA concentration did not seem to have any significant effect on the adhesion
rate itself, it had an impact on the shape of the RBCs. This relationship is discussed in the
next section. After an intracellular Ca2+ increase was observed by fluorescence imaging, the
setup mode was switched to white light for better HOT operation. Then, the cells were
brought into contact and adhered to each other immediately. Because the time for the Ca2+
increase varied from cell to cell, which is in agreement with previous investigations [9, 28],
the time between the initial stimulation of the cell and the final adhesion varied between 10
and 140 s, yielding an average value of 72.75 ± 46.79 s (s.d.). This time range already
indicates that under normal physiological conditions, the activation of RBCs is not compatible
with an active process contributing to the initiation of a blood clot, but once caught in the
fibrin network, the RBCs may actively support clot formation. In addition, to test the
necessity of the presence of Ca2+ during LPA stimulation, the negative control experiments
excluded any interplay between the infrared trapping laser and the adhesion process.

Signaling components
Because LPA is a phospholipid derivative, we examined the extent to which it is directly
involved in the adhesion process. Although the concentration used was clearly below the
critical micelle concentration (70 µM - 1 mM) [26], which might induce detergent-like
effects, LPA is likely to be incorporated into the membrane. From the initial intercellular
adhesion after LPA stimulation (Fig. 2b), one may propose the following alternative
explanations: (i) LPA is directly responsible for the adhesion, (ii) LPA and the Ca2+ influx
are both necessary to mediate adhesion, and (iii) LPA simply triggers the Ca2+ influx, and the
Ca2+ signaling alone is sufficient to induce adhesion. Option (i) can be excluded immediately
because it was tested as a control in the initial set of experiments (Fig. 2b). In order to
discriminate between options (ii) and (iii), experiments where A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, was
added to the RBCs were performed. As shown in Fig. 3, the increased intracellular Ca2+
concentration is the dominant signal initiating the adhesion. The Ca2+ entry under LPA
stimulation is channel-mediated, although the molecular identity of the channel remains
unclear [29]. Because LPA is not the major entity in the adhesion process, an alternative
8

Steffen et al.

molecule or a combination of several entities downstream of the Ca2+ signal must control the
response. Proteins that are known to be activated in RBCs by an increase in intracellular Ca2+
concentration are the Gardos channel, the lipid scramblase, the cysteine protease calpain [30,
31] and the Ca2+ pump. Although all the proteins are Ca2+-activated, their sensitivity to Ca2+
differs. To determine in which order and under what conditions the above mentioned players
activate, we refer to the Ca2+ concentration with the half maximal effect (EC50). It would
therefore be desirable to quantitatively measure the Ca2+ concentration in an individual RBC.
Unfortunately, this is not possible due to the failure of ratiometric Ca2+ sensors in RBCs [28].
Instead, we compare EC50 values determined in different studies with the cellular responses
we observed in the present study. The smallest EC50 for Ca2+ is obviously that of the Ca2+
pump that keeps the resting Ca2+ concentration in RBCs well below 100 nM [32]. With any
increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, the Ca2+ pump will activate. Although the
Vmax of the Ca2+ pump was determined in cell populations to be patient- and sampledependent in a range of 8 to 20 mmol/(lcells·h) [32], the pump activity per cell varies
tremendously [33]. This variation explains the broad time range observed between the start of
LPA stimulation and the Ca2+ increase. While the pump can counterbalance the LPA-induced
Ca2+ influx for a short time period, during the application of A23187, the amount of Ca2+
entering the cell exceeds the Vmax capacity of the Ca2+ pump for all cells. At a Ca2+
concentration of 400 nM, the flippase transporting PS actively from the outer membrane
leaflet to the inner one is inhibited [34]. Once the Ca2+ influx exceeds the transport capacity
of the Ca2+ pump, the first player that will be activated is the Gardos channel, with an EC 50 of
4.7 µM [35]. As we can see for the shape transitions upon A23187 stimulation shown in Fig.
3b, cells turn (transiently) into echinocytes as a consequence of KCl loss triggered by K+
efflux through the Gardos channel. For LPA stimulation, the situation is different: due to the
activation of the non-selective cation channel by LPA, a Na+ influx and, consequently, NaCl
uptake counterbalances the KCl loss initiated by the Gardos channel, producing an osmotic
equilibrium. For a 2.5 µM LPA stimulation, this equilibrium [36] is reached, whereas for a 10
µM LPA stimulation, the effect of the NaCl uptake overwhelms the KCl loss, resulting in the
formation of spherocytes. The next entity to be activated upon Ca2+ entry is the scramblase,
with an EC50 of 29 µM [37]. Scramblase activity was demonstrated by probing for PS in the
outer membrane leaflet using annexinV-FITC staining. Staining was present after both LPA
and A23187 stimulation, as depicted in Figs. 3c and 3d, respectively. Calpain is activated with
an EC50 of 40 µM, which is very close to the EC50 of the scramblase [38]. Under both
stimulation conditions (LPA and A23187), we observed vesiculation that has been shown to
be associated with the activation of calpain [30], which cleaves spectrin and actin and
therefore leads to the breakdown of the cytoskeleton. This is in good agreement with a recent
report on exovesiculation by Cueff et al. [39]. However, the vesiculation was much more
pronounced under A23187 stimulation than under LPA stimulation, as depicted in the
representative images in Fig. 3d and Fig. 2c, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that the Ca2+
concentration after stimulation with 2.5 µM LPA is smaller compared to the A23187
stimulation and might be in the range of EC50 of calpain. For A23187 stimulation, a shape
change from echinocytes to spherocytes occurs (compare Figs. 3a and 3b), which is mediated
by the encapsulation of microvesicles. However, the occurrence of PS on the outside of the
cell makes it a good candidate for initiating the adhesion process. This could be due to simple
Ca2+-PS- cross-bridging and/or a more complex process involving adhesion proteins. Further
9

Steffen et al.

evidence for both options comes from aggregation studies of PS vesicles [40, 41], where
aggregation occurs in solutions of physiological ionic strength containing Ca2+ in the mM
concentration range. The dependence on high Ca2+ concentrations and evidence from further
studies reporting enhanced aggregation of PS liposomes in the presence of polymers [42]
suggest that additional membrane constituents in the RBC contribute to the aggregation
process. This leads to other Ca2+-dependent proteins in RBCs, such as PKCα [43, 44] or the
nitric oxide synthase [45, 46]. Further research is required to address the question of the
molecular identity of the additional components in the adhesion process. Analyzing the
stepwise unbinding (compare Fig. 4b) when RBCs are separated from each other
(corresponding to step 3 in Fig. 4a), we found a Gaussian distribution of the force centered at
71.9 pN (Fig. 4e). Such a distribution suggests the formation of tethers and specific bonds
between the RBCs that are released one by one during the separation process.

Relevance to in vivo conditions
The LPA concentration of between 2.5 and 10 µM is a physiologically relevant concentration
that is likely to occur locally after platelet activation. Upon stimulation with such an LPA
concentration, RBCs adhere irreversibly to each other. The separation force of approximately
100 pN (determined by single cell force spectroscopy) is in a range that is of relevance in the
vasculature [47]. As mentioned previously, due to the time course of the Ca2+ increase, we
regard an initiation of a blood clot based on intercellular RBC adhesion to be irrelevant under
physiological conditions. However, once caught in the fibrin network of a blood clot, the
adhesion process observed here in vitro may support the solidification of the clot. This notion
is supported by the aforementioned experimental and clinical investigations reporting a
prolongation of bleeding time in subjects with low RBC counts [7-9, 48]. Evidence that the
adhesion process described in this paper may play a role in vivo was recently provided by
Chung and coworkers [49]. In this study, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ of RBCs associated
with a PS exposure was be related to prothrombotic activity in vivo in a venous thrombosis rat
model. Under pathophysiological conditions, intercellular RBC adhesion after Ca2+ influx
seems to have a more pronounced effect. An example is the vasco-occlusive crisis of sickle
cell disease (SCD) patients. Here, the Ca2+ influx is mediated by the NMDA-receptor, which
has been found to be abundant in RBCs [46]. Our study provides a link between the increased
prevalence of the NMDA-receptor in SCD patients [50] and the symptoms of the vascoocclusive crisis. Further examples where disorders in the ion homeostasis of RBCs are
associated with thrombotic events are malaria [51] and thalassemia [52, 53]. Therefore, we
propose that the Ca2+ increase, independent of the entry pathway, followed by PS exposure
and RBC aggregation is a general mechanism that may become relevant under pathological
conditions.

Figures

Figure 1: Probing for adhesion between RBCs after LPA stimulation. Panel a) represents a sketch of
the oscillatory movement of two trapped cells. The actual cell-cell distance over the course of the
adhesion test is depicted in panel b). The graph depicts the separation distance of two red blood cells,
as determined using edge detection, over the course of the experiment. Cells were preincubated with
2.5 µM LPA for 5 min. After adhesion occurred at around 6 s, the distance between the cells remained
zero. Panel c) depicts representative images of an adhesion measurement of two RBCs held by 4
optical traps. During a recording period of 26 s, the cells were moved back and forth as indicated by
the red arrows. The full video can be seen in the supplemental material.

Figure 2: The response of RBCs to LPA. a) The relative fluorescence signal of a representative RBC
in the upper microfluidic channel; t = 0 s is the time when the cell was moved into the LPA solution.
The inset shows a schematic picture of the microfluidic chamber used. b) Results of the LPA
measurements conducted in the microfluidic chamber and the Petri dish. The grey bars represent the
percentage of cells that showed adhesion. The overall number of cells tested was 60 cells per
measurement. In the presence of LPA and Ca2+, a significant number of cells showed adhesion,
whereas in the control experiments, only a very small portion of the cells showed an adhesion. The
results of the Student’s t-test, compared to the control measurement (PIS-solution), are indicated at the
top of each bar. c) A fluorescence image of LPA-treated (2.5 µM) RBCs after annexin V-FITC

staining. The annexin V binding indicates the presence of PS on the outer membrane leaflet of the
cells.

Figure 3: Measurements with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. a) The relative fluorescence signal of a
representative RBC in the upper channel of the microfluidic system; t = 0 s is the time when the cell
reached the A23187 solution. The Ca2+ increase happens almost instantaneously. The decrease in
signal after 15 s is due to photobleaching. b) The RBCs undergo a shape transformation from
discocytes (left) via echinocytes (middle) to spherocytes (right) after transfer into the A23187 buffer
solution in the upper channel. c) The results of the ionophore measurements conducted in the
microfluidic chamber and a Petri dish. The black bars represent the percentage of cells that showed
adhesion. The number of cells tested was about 60 per measurement. In the presence of A23187 and
Ca2+, about 90% of the cells tested adhered, whereas in the control experiments, less than 3% of the
16

cells adhered. The results of the Student’s t-test, compared to the control measurement (PIS-solution),
are indicated at the top of each bar. d) A fluorescence image of annexin V-FITC-labeled RBCs. The
cells were treated with A23187, and exposure of PS at the cell surface was clearly identified. A
vesiculation of the cells was also observed (indicated by arrows).

Figure 4: Force quantification using atomic force spectroscopy (AFS). Panel a) shows the working
principle of the AFS. One cell is attached to a cantilever, while another one is attached to the surface.
Over the course of the experiment, the cells are brought into contact and are withdrawn again. The
adhesion force of the two cells can be measured by measuring the deflection of the cantilever. Panel b)
shows the combined plot of an example force-distance-curve of a control (green) and an LPA
measurement (red). Panel c) and panel d) depict the statistics of the measured forces in the controls
and LPA measurements, respectively. Panel e) provides a histogram of the unbinding force of a single
tether within the procedure visualized in panels a) and b). The dotted line depicts a Gaussian
approximation of the bars.
