Abstract We study the effect of additive noise on integro-differential neural field equations. In particular, we analyze an
Amari-type model driven by a Q-Wiener process and focus on noise-induced transitions and escape. We argue that proving a
sharp Kramers’ law for neural fields poses substantial difficulties but that one may transfer techniques from stochastic partial
differential equations to establish a large deviation principle (LDP). Then we demonstrate that an efficient finite-dimensional
approximation of the stochastic neural field equation can be achieved using a Galerkin method and that the resulting finitedimensional rate function for the LDP can have a multi-scale structure in certain cases. These results form the starting point
for an efficient practical computation of the LDP. Our approach also provides the technical basis for further rigorous study
of noise-induced transitions in neural fields based on Galerkin approximations.

1 Introduction
Starting from the classical works of Wilson/Cowan [64] and Amari [1] there has been considerable interest in the analysis of
spatio-temporal dynamics of meso-scale models of neural activity. Continuum models for neural fields often take the form
of nonlinear integro-differential equations where the integral term can be viewed as a nonlocal interaction term; see [36]
for a derivation of neural field models. Stationary states, travelling waves and pattern formation for neural fields have been
studied extensively see, e.g., [20, 28] or the recent review by Bressloff [12] and references therein.
In this paper we are going to study a stochastic neural field model. There are several motivations for our approach. In
general, it is well-known that intra- and inter-neuron [26] dynamics are subject to fluctuations. Many meso- or macro-scale
continuum models have stochastic perturbations due to finite-size effects [37, 61]. Therefore, there is certainly a genuine
need to develop new techniques to analyze random neural systems [49]. For stochastic neural fields there is also the direct
motivation to understand the relation between noise and short-term working memory [51] as well as noise-induced phenomena [53] in perceptual bistability [62]. Although an eventual goal is to match results from stochastic neural fields to actual
cortex data [34] we shall not attempt such a comparison here. However, the techniques we develop could have the potential
to make it easier to understand the relation between models and experiments; see Section 10 for a more detailed discussion.
There is a relatively small amount of fairly recent work on stochastic neural fields which we briefly review here. Brackley
and Turner [11] study a neural field with a gain function which has a random firing threshold. Fluctuating gain functions
are also considered by Coombes et al. [21]. Bressloff and Webber [15] analyze a stochastic neural field equation with

multiplicative noise while Bressloff and Wilkinson [16] study the influence of extrinsic noise on neural fields. In all these
works the focus is on the statistics of travelling waves such as front diffusion and the effects of noise on the wave speed.
Hutt et al. [40] study the influence of external fluctuations on Turing bifurcation in neural fields. Kilpatrick and Ermentrout
[42] are interested in stationary bump solutions. They observe numerically a noise-induced passage to extinction as well
as noise-induced switching of bump solutions and conjecture that “a Kramers’ escape rate calculation” [42, p.16] could be
applied to stochastic neural fields but they do not carry out this calculation. In particular, the question is whether one can give
a precise estimate of the mean transition time between metastable states for stochastic neural field equations; for a precise
statement of the classical Kramers’ law see Section 5, equation (32). However, to the best of our knowledge there seems
to be no general Kramers’ law or large deviation principle (LDP) calculation available for continuum neural field models
although large deviations have been of recent interest in neuroscience applications [14, 32]. It is one of the main goals of this
paper to provide the basic steps towards a general theory.
Although Kramers’ law [5] and LDPs [33, 25] are well understood for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the work for infinite-dimensional evolution equations is much more recent. In particular, it has been shown
very recently that one may extend Kramers’ law to certain stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) [4, 6, 7] driven
by space-time white noise. The work of Berglund and Gentz [7] provides a quite general strategy how to ‘lift’ a finitedimensional Kramers’ law to the SPDE setting using a Galerkin approximation due to Blömker and Jentzen [8]. Since the
transfer of PDE techniques to neural fields has been very successful, either directly [50] or indirectly [22, 12], one may
conjecture that the same strategy also works for SPDEs and stochastic neural fields.
In this paper we consider a rate-based (or Amari) neural field model driven by a Q-Wiener process W

for a trace-class operator Q, nonlinear gain function f and an interaction kernel w; the technical details and definitions are
provided in Section 2. Observe that (1) is a relatively general formulation of a nonlocal neural field. Hence we expect that
the techniques developed in this paper carry over to much wider classes of neural fields beyond (1) such as activity-based
models.
Remark 1.1 To avoid confusion we alert readers familiar with neural fields that the nonlinear gain function f in (1) is
sometimes also called a ‘rate function’. However, we reserve ‘rate function’ for a functional, to be denoted later by I , arising
in the context of an LDP as this convention is standard in the context of LDPs.
Our main goal in the study of (1) is to provide estimates on the mean first passage times between metastable states.
In particular, we develop the basic analytical tools to approximate equation (1) as well as its rate function using a finitedimensional Galerkin approximation. By making the rate function as explicit as possible we do not only provide a starting
point for further analytical work but also provide a framework for efficient numerical methods to analyze metastable states.
The paper is structured as follows: The motivation for (1) is given in Section 3 where a formal calculation shows that a
space-time white noise perturbation of the gain function in a deterministic neural field leads to (1). In Section 4 we briefly
describe important features of the deterministic dynamics for (1) where ǫ = 0. In particular, we collect several examples
from the literature where the classical Kramers’ stability configuration of bistable stationary states separated by an unstable
state occurs for Amari-type neural fields. In Section 5 we introduce the notation for Kramers’ law and LDPs and state the
main theorem on finite-dimensional rate functions. In Section 6 we argue that a direct approach to Kramers’ law via ‘lifting’
for (1) is likely to fail. Although the Amari model has a hidden energy-type structure we have not been able to generalize
the gradient-structure approach for SPDEs to the stochastic Amari model. This raises doubt whether a Kramers’ escape rate
calculation can actually be carried out i.e. whether one may express the pre-factor of the mean first-passage in the bistable
case explicitly. Based on these considerations we restrict ourselves to just derive an LDP. In Section 7 the LDP is established
by a direct transfer of a result known for SPDEs. The disadvantage of this approach is that the resulting rate function is
difficult to calculate, analytically or numerically, in practice. Therefore, we establish in Section 8 the convergence of a
suitable Galerkin approximation for (1). Using this approximation one may apply results about the LDP for SDEs which
we carry out in Section 9. In this context, we also notice that the trace-class noise can induce a multi-scale structure of the
rate function in certain cases. The last two observations lead to a tractable finite-dimensional approximation of the LDP and
hence also an associated finite-dimensional approximation for first-exit time problems. We conclude the paper in Section 10
with implications of our work and remarks about future problems.

2 Amari-Type Models
In this study we consider stochastic neural field models with additive noise of the form



dUt (x) = −αUt (x) +
w(x, y )f (Ut (y ))dy dt + ǫdWt (x)

(2)

B

for x ∈ B ⊆ Rd , a small parameter ǫ > 0, and t ≥ 0, where B is bounded and closed. In (2) the solution U models the
averaged electrical potential generated by neurons at location x in an area of the brain B. Neural field equations of the form
(2) are called Amari-type equations or a rate-based neural field models. The equation is driven by an adapted space-time
stochastic process Wt (x) on a filtered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft )t≥0 , P). The precise definition of the process W will be
given below.
The parameter α > 0 is the decay rate for the potential, w : B × B → R is a kernel that models the connectivity of
neurons at location x to neurons at location y . Positive values of w model excitatory connections and negative values model
inhibitory connections. The gain function f : R → R+ relates the potential of neurons to inputs into other neurons. Typically,
the gain functions are chosen sigmoidal, for example, (up to affine transformations of the argument) f (u) = (1 + e−u )−1
or f (u) = (tanh(u) + 1)/2. These examples of gain functions are bounded, infinitely often differentiable with bounded
derivatives. However, throughout the paper we only make the standing assumption that
(H1)

the gain function f is globally Lipschitz continuous on R.

We may transfer equation (2) into the Hilbert space setting of infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations [23, 56]
for the Hilbert space L2 (B). Subsequently brackets h·, ·i always denote the inner product on this Hilbert space. Moreover,
we introduce the following notation. Firstly, F denotes the nonlinear Nemytzkii-operator defined from f , i.e., F (g )(x) =
f (g (x)) for any function g ∈ L2 (B). The condition (H1) implies that F : L2 (B) → L2 (B) is a Lipschitz continuous operator.
Often, spatially continuous solutions to (2) are also of interest and thus we note that the Nemytzkii-operator also preserves
its Lipschitz continuity on the Banach space C (B) with its norm kgk0 = supx∈B |g (x)| due to B being bounded.1 Secondly,
the linear operator K is the integral operator defined by the kernel w
Z
Kg (x) =
w(x, y )g (y ) dy
∀ g ∈ L2 (B).
(3)
B

Throughout the paper we assume that
(H2)

the kernel w is such that K is a compact, self-adjoint operator on L2 (B).

We note that an integral operator is self-adjoint if and only if the kernel is symmetric, i.e., w(x, y ) = w(y, x) for all x, y ∈ B.
A sufficient condition for the compactness of K is, e.g., kwkL2 (B×B) < ∞ in which case the operator is called a HilbertSchmidt operator. Since B is bounded the continuity of the kernel w on B × B implies the compactness of K considered an
integral operator on C (B).
Then we re-write equation (2) as an Hilbert space-valued stochastic evolution equation
dUt = [−αUt + KF (Ut )] dt + ǫdWt ,

(4)

where W is an L2 (B)-valued stochastic process. Interpreting the original equation in this form we now give a definition of
the noise process assuming that
(H3)

W is a Q-Wiener process on L2 (B), where the covariance operator Q is a non-negative, symmetric trace class operator
on L2 (B).

For a detailed explanation of a Hilbert space-valued Q-Wiener process and its covariance operator we refer to, e.g., [23, 56].
2
As the operator Q is non-negative, symmetric and of trace class there exists an orthonormal
P∞ 2basis of L (B) consisting of
2
eigenfunctions vi and corresponding non-negative real eigenvalues λi which satisfy i=1 λi < ∞ . It then holds that the
Q-Wiener process W satisfies

1 We note that the boundedness assumption on the domain B in this study is only necessary when dealing with results in the space C(B) as is
the appropriate space for the LDP results. All other results in this paper which only deal with the space L2 (B), e.g., existence of solutions and
convergence of the Galerkin approximation, are also valid for unbounded spatial domains.

where β i are a sequence of independent scalar Wiener processes (cf. [56, Prop 2.1.10]). The series (5) converges in the
mean-square on C ([0, T ], L2 (B)). Furthermore, a straightforward adaptation of the proof of [56, Prop 2.1.10] shows that
convergence in the mean-square also holds
space C ([0, T ], C (B)) for every T > 0 if vi ∈ C (B) for all i (corresponding
P in the

i=1 λi vi (x) < ∞.
The existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to (4) with trace class noise for given initial condition U0 ∈ L2 (B) is
guaranteed under the Lipschitz condition on f , cf. [23], and we can write the solution in its mild form

The solution possesses a modification in C ([0, T ], L2 (B)) and from now on we always identify the solution (6) with its
continuous modification. It is worthwhile to note that for cylindrical Wiener processes – and thus in particular space-time
white noise – there does not exist a solution to (4). This contrasts with other well-studied infinite-dimensional stochastic
evolution equations, e.g., the stochastic heat equation. Due toRthe representation of the solution (6) it follows that a solution
t
can only be as spatially regular as the stochastic convolution 0 e−α(t−s) dWs . In the present case the semigroup generated
by the linear operator is not smoothing in contrast to, e.g., the semigroup generated by the Laplacian in the heat equation.
Thus the stochastic convolution is only as smooth as the noise which for space-time white noise is not even a well-defined
function. To be more specific, for cylindrical Wiener noise the series representation of the stochastic convolution (cf. see
equation (8) below) does not converge in a suitable probabilistic sense.
We next aim to strengthen the spatial regularity of the solution (6) which will be required later on. According to [23,
Thm. 7.10] the solution (6) is a continuous process taking values in the Banach space C (B) if the initial condition satisfies
u0 ∈ C (B), the linear part in the drift of (4) generates a strongly continuous semigroup on C (B), the non-linear term KF
is globally Lipschitz continuous on C (B) and, finally, if the stochastic convolution is a continuous process taking values in
C (B). It is easily seen, that the first conditions are satisfied and sufficient conditions for the latter property are given in the
following lemma.
Lemma 2.1 Assume that the orthonormal basis functions vi are Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constants Li such that

Proof We prove the lemma applying the Kolmogorov-Centsov Theorem (cf. [23, Thm. 3.3 & Thm. 3.4]). Throughout the
proof C is some finite, constant which may change from line to line but is independent of x, y ∈ B and t, s ≥ 0. We
start showing that the process O is Hölder continuous in the mean-square in each direction. As vi are assumed continuous
these are pointwise uniquely given and each O(t, x) is for fixed x ∈ B and t ≥ 0 a Gaussian random variable due to

O(y, s) is centered Gaussian it further holds that
E|O(x, t) − O(y, s)|2m ≤ Cρ,m (|t − s|2 + |x − y|2 )mρ/2

∀m ∈ N.

Now, the Kolmogorov-Centsov Theorem implies the statement of the lemma.
We present an example to illustrate the type of noise we are generally interested in. Further motivation is provided in
Section 3.
Example 2.1 Consider the neural field equation on a d-dimensional cube B = [0, 2π ]d with noise based on trigonometric
basis functions of L2 ([0, 2π ]d ). This type of noise is almost ubiquitous in applications as for the stochastic heat equations
the basis functions can be chosen such that the usual (Dirichlet, Neumann or periodic) boundary conditions are preserved.
For the example of noise preserving homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions the basis functions are

vi (x) =

where x = (x1 , . . . , xd ), i = (i1 , . . . , ik ) is a multi-index in Nd and the functions eik are given by

The functions vi are for all i ∈ Nd pointwise bounded by π −d/2 and Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constants given by
Li = π −d/2 |i| (cf. [8, Lemma 5.3]). Next, we construct a trace class Wiener process from these basis functions. A particular
important example of spatio-temporal noise is smooth noise with exponentially decaying spatial correlation length [15, 42,
35], i.e.,

for a parameter ξ > 0 modelling the spatial correlation length. Note that for ξ → 0 this noise process approximates spacetime white noise. Following [60] we can calculate under the assumption that ξ ≪ 2π the coefficients λ2i such that the

3 Gain Function Perturbation
Another motivation for the considered additive noise neural field equations stems from a (formal) perturbation of the gain
function f with space-time white noise. Let Ẇ denote space time white noise and consider the randomly perturbed Amari
equation
Z


∂t U (x, t) = −αU (x, t) +
w(x, y ) f (U (y, t)) + ǫ Ẇ (y, t) dy .

B

Recall that, by assumption (H2), the integral operator K defined by the kernel w is a self-adjoint compact operator. Thus the
Spectral Theorem implies that K possess only real eigenvalues λi , i ∈ N, and the corresponding eigenfunctions vi form an
orthonormal basis of L2 (B). If additionally we assume that
(H4)

K is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on L2 (B), that is, kwkL2 (B×B) < ∞,

then the eigenvalues satisfy

P∞

i=1 λi

< ∞. Hence, K possesses the series representation

Next, note that the random variables β̇ti = hẆ (·, t), vi i form a sequence of independent scalar white noise processes in time.

is a trace-class Wiener process on the Hilbert space L2 (B). Note, when comparing to (5) here the coefficients λi may be
negative, however, as −β i is also a Wiener process this slight inconsistency can be neglected.
We next want to discuss spatial continuity of the solution to this equation with its particular noise structure. It is clear
that this should translate into smoothing conditions of the kernel w. Due to Lemma 2.1 it is sufficient to establish conditions
(7): First, it holds that

Next, the basis functions are continuous if the kernel w(x, y ) is continuous in x and as the minimal Lipschitz constant is

for a ρ ∈ (0, 1) and a M < ∞. The condition (14) and the first part of (15) are easily checked but for the second part of
(15) usually theoretical results on the speed of decay of the eigenvalues have to be obtained. We note that (15) is certainly
satisfied with ρ = 1/2 if K is a trace class operator and the eigenfunctions are pointwise bounded independently of i, see,
e.g., Example 2.1.

4 Deterministic Dynamics
The classical deterministic Amari model, obtained for ǫ = 0 in (2), is
Z
∂t U (x, t) = −αU (x, t) +
w(x, y )f (U (y, t))dy.

(16)

B

where B ⊆ Rd . Note that we may allow B to be unbounded for the deterministic case as solutions of (16) do exist in
this case [54]. Suppose there exists a stationary solution U ∗ = U ∗ (x) of (16). To determine the stability of U ∗ consider
U (x, t) = U ∗ (x) + ψ (x, t). Substituting into (16) and Taylor-expanding around U ∗ yields the linearized problem
Z
∂t ψ (x, t) = −αψ (x, t) +
w(x, y )(Df )(U ∗ (y ))ψ (y, t)dy.
(17)
B

Hence, the standard ansatz ψ (x, t) = ψ0 (x)eµt leads to the eigenvalue problem
Z
(µ + α) ψ0 (x) =
w(x, y )(Df )(U ∗ (y ))ψ0 (y )dy := (Lψ0 )(x) or
| {z }
B

Lψ0 = ηψ0 .

(18)

=:η

The linear stability condition µ < 0 is equivalent to η < α where η ∈ spec(L). The stability analysis can be reduced to
the understanding of the operator L. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem as the behaviour depends upon B, U ∗ (x),
w(x, y ) and f (u).
An LDP and Kramers’ law are of particular interest in the case of bistability. Therefore, we point out that there are
∗
many situations where (16) does have three stationary solutions: U±
(x) which are stable and U0∗ (x) which is unstable. The
following three examples make this claim more precise.

Christian Kuehn, Martin G. Riedler

Example 4.1 The first example is presented by Ermentrout and McLeod [28]. Let B = R, w(x, y ) = w(|x − y|), α = 1 and
assume that 0 ≤ U (x, t) ≤ 1. Furthermore, suppose that f ∈ C 1 ([0, 1], R) with f ′ > 0 and
f˜(U ) := −U + f (U )

(19)

has precisely three zeros U = 0, a, 1 with 0 < a < 1. The additional conditions f ′ (0) < 1 and f ′ (1) < 1 guarantee stability
of the stationary solutions U = 0 and U = 1. As an even more explicit assumption [28, p.463] one may consider a Dirac
δ -distribution for w in (16) which yields
∂t U (x, t) = −U (x, t) + F (U (x, t)).

(20)

Suppose there are precisely three solutions for U = F (U ) given by U = 0, a, 1 with 0 < a < 1. If F ′ (0) < 1, F ′ (1) < 1
and F ′ (a) > 1 then (20) has an unstable stationary solution between the two stable stationary solutions.
Example 4.2 An even more concrete example is given by Guo and Chow [38, 39]. They assume B = R, w(x, y ) = w(x − y ),
α = 1 and fix two functions
f (u) = [b(u − ub ) + 1]H (u − ub ),

w(x) = Ae−a|x| − e|x|

where H (·) is the Heaviside function and b, a, A and ub are parameters. Depending on parameter values one may obtain
three constant stationary solutions exhibiting bistability as expected from Example 4.1. However, there are also parameter
values so that three stationary pulses exhibiting bistability exist.
∗
Note that the choice B = R is not essential to obtain two deterministically-stable stationary states U±
(x) and one
∗
deterministically-unstable stationary state U0 (x). The important aspect is that certain algebraic equations, such as U = f (U )
and U = F (U ) in Example 4.1, have the correct number of solutions. Furthermore, one has to make sure that the sign of the
nonlinearity f is chosen correctly to obtain the desried deterministic stability results for the stationary solutions. Hence we
expect that a similar situation also holds for bounded domains; see also [63].

Examples 4.1-4.2 are typical for many similar cases with x ∈ R or x ∈ R2 . Many results on existence and stability of
stationary solutions are available see e.g. [1, 50, 45, 51] and references therein.
Example 4.3 As a higher-dimensional example one may consider the work by Jin, Liang and Peng [41] who assume that
w(x, y ) = w(x − y ), α = 1, B = Rd and
Z∞ =

Z

Rd

w(x) dx < ∞,

κZ∞ > 1,

where κ is the Lipschitz constant of f ∈ C 1 (Rd , R). Furthermore, suppose f ′ is uniformly continuous and
f ′ (U )Z∞ < 1
f ′ (U )Z∞ = 1
f ′ (U )Z∞ > 1

for U ∈ (−∞, U1 ) ∪ (U2 , ∞),
for U ∈ {U1 , U2 },
for U ∈ (U1 , U2 ),

for U1 < 0 < U2 . Then [41, Prop.11] the conditions
−U1 + f (U1 )Z∞ < 0

and

− U2 + f (U2 )Z∞ > 0

∗

yield three stationary solutions U+
, U−
and U0∗ . The solutions U±
are stable and satisfy U−

U0∗ is unstable.

Although we only focus on stationary solutions, it is important to remark that the techniques developed here could - in
principle - also be applied to travelling waves U (x, t) = U (x − st) for s > 0. The existence and stability of travelling waves
for (16) has been investigated for many different situations; see e.g. [12, 28, 13, 22] and references therein. However, it seems
reasonable to restrict ourselves here to the stationary case as even for this simpler case an LDP and Kramers’ law are not yet
well understood.

5 Large Deviations and Kramers’ Law
Here we briefly introduce the background and notation for LDPs and Kramers’ law needed through the remaining part of the
paper; see [33, 25] for more details. Consider a topological space X with Borel σ -algebra BX . A mapping I : X → [0, ∞]
is called a good rate function if it is lower semicontinuous and the level set {h : I (h) ≤ α} is compact for each α ∈ [0, ∞).
Sometimes the term action functional is used instead of rate function. Consider a family {µǫ } of probability measures on
(X , BX ). The measures {µǫ } satisfy an LDP with good rate function I if
− info I ≤ lim inf ǫ2 ln µǫ (Γ ) ≤ lim sup ǫ2 ln µǫ (Γ ) ≤ − inf I
Γ

ǫ→0

ǫ→0

(21)

Γ̄

holds for any measurable set Γ ⊂ X ; often infima over the interior Γ o and closure Γ̄ coincide so that lim inf and lim sup
coincide at a common limit. One of the most classical cases is the application of (21) to finite-dimensional SDEs
dut = g (ut )dt + ǫG(ut )dβt

(22)

where ut ∈ RN , g : RN → RN , G : RN → RN ×k , βt = (βt1 , . . . , βtk )T is a vector of k independent Brownian motions
and we shall assume that the initial condition u0 ∈ RN is deterministic. If we want to emphasize that ut depends on ǫ we
shall also use the notation uǫt . The topological space is chosen as a path space
X := C0 ([0, T ], RN ) = {φ ∈ C ([0, T ], RN ) : φ(0) = u0 }.

To state the next result we also need the Sobolev space
H1N := {φ : [0, T ] → RN : φ absolutely continuous, φ′ ∈ L2 , φ(0) = 0}.

(23)

Furthermore, we are going to assume that the diffusion matrix D(u) := G(u)T G(u) ∈ RN ×N is positive definite.
Theorem 5.1 ([33],[25]) The SDE (22) satisfies the LDP (21) given by
− info I ≤ lim inf ǫ2 ln P((uǫt )t∈[0,T ] ∈ Γ ) ≤ lim sup ǫ2 ln P((uǫt )t∈[0,T ] ∈ Γ ) ≤ − inf I.

otherwise.

(25)

An important application of the LDP (24) is the so-called first-exit problem. Suppose that ut starts near a stable equilibrium u∗ ∈ D ⊂ RN of the deterministic system given by setting ǫ = 0 in (22), where D is a bounded domain with smooth
boundary. Define the first-exit time
ǫ
τD
:= inf {t > 0 : uǫt 6∈ D}.
(26)
To formalize the application of the LDP define the mapping
Z (u, v ; s) := inf {I (φ) : φ ∈ C ([0, s], RN ), φ0 = u, φs = v}

(27)

which is the cost for a path starting at u to reach v in time s. Next assume that D̄ is properly contained inside the (deterministic) basin of attraction of u∗ . Then one can show [33, Thm. 4.1, p.124] that
ǫ
lim ǫ2 ln P(τD
≤ t|u = u0 ) = inf {Z (u, v ; s) : s ∈ [0, t], v 6∈ D}.

ǫ→0

To get a more precise information on the exit distribution one defines the function
Z (u∗ , v ) = inf Z (u∗ , v ; t)
t>0

which is called the quasipotential for u∗ . It is natural to minimize the quasipotential over ∂D and define
Z̄ := inf Z (u∗ , v ).
v∈∂D

If the SDE (22) has a gradient structure with identity diffusion matrix i.e.
g (u) = −∇V (u) for V : RN → R,

and

G(u) = Id ∈ RN ×N

(31)

then one can show [33, Sec. 4.3] that the quasipotential is given by Z (u∗ , v ) = 2(V (v )−V (u∗ )). If the potential has precisely
two local minima u∗± and a saddle point u∗s with N − 1 stable directions so that the Hessian ∇2 V (u∗s ) has eigenvalues
ρ1 (u∗s ) < 0 < ρ2 (u∗s ) < · · · < ρN (u∗s )

then one can even refine Theorem 5.2. Suppose u0 = u∗− then the mean first passage time to u∗+ satisfies

where k · k2 denotes the usual Euclidean norm in RN . The formula (32) is also known as Kramers’ law [5] or ArrheniusEyring-Kramers’ law [2, 30, 44]. Note that the key differences with the general LDP (29) for the first-exit problem are that
(32) yields a precise prefactor for the exponential transition time and uses the explicit form of the good rate function for
gradient systems. It is interesting to note that a rigorous proof of (32) has only been obtained quite recently [9, 10].

6 Gradient Structures in Infinite Dimensions
The finite-dimensional Kramers’ formula (32) applies to SDEs (22) with a gradient-structure g (u) = −∇V (u) where V :
RN → R is the potential. A generalization of Kramers’ law has been carried over to the infinite-dimensional case of SPDEs
given by
dU = [∆U − h′ (U )]dt + ǫ dW (x, t)
(33)
for U = U (x, t), x ∈ B̃ ⊂ R, B̃ a bounded interval, h ∈ C k (R, R) for suitably large k ∈ N and W (x, t) denotes space-time
white noise and either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are used [4, 6, 7]. A crucial reason why this generalization
works is that the SPDE (33) has a gradient-type structure [31] given by the energy functional

Z 
1 ′ 2
V [U ] :=
U (x) + h(U (x)) dx.
(34)
B̃ 2
More precisely, when ǫ = 0 one obtains from (33) a PDE, say with Dirichlet boundary conditions,
dU = [∆U − h′ (U )]dt,

U (x) = 0 on ∂ B̃

(35)

for a given sufficiently smooth initial condition U (x, 0) = U0 (x) ∈ C k (R, R). Standard parabolic regularity [29, Sec. 7.1]
implies that solutions U of (35) lie in the Sobolev spaces H0k (B̃). Computing the Gâteaux derivative in this space yields
Z
∇z V [ U ] =
[−U ′′ (x) + h′ (U (x))]z (x) dx.
(36)
B̃

The Gâteaux derivative is equal to the Fréchet derivative ∇V = DV by a standard continuity result [24, p.47]. Hence (36)
shows that the stationary solutions of (35) are critical points of the gradient functional V . Since the gradient structure of
the deterministic PDE (35) is a key structure to obtain a Kramers’-type estimate for the SPDE (33) we would like to check
whether there is an analogue available for the deterministic Amari model (16).
We shall assume for simplicity that f ∈ BC 1 (R) for the calculations in this section. Although this is a slightly stronger
assumption than (H1) we shall see below that even with this assumption we are not able to obtain an immediate generalization
of (36). Using a direct modification of the results in [54] it follows that the deterministic Amari model (16) has solutions

U (x, t) in the Hölder space BC α (B) × BC α ([0, T ]) for α ∈ (0, 1] and B ⊂ Rd is the usual domain we use for the Amari

Hence f and its derivative Df
R uboth appear instead of the desired formulation; by a similar computation one can show that
replacing f (u(·)) in (39) by 0 f (r )dr fails as well. Hence there does not seem to be a natural generalization for the guess
for the gradient functional (34). However, one has to consider possible coordinate changes. The idea to apply a preliminary
transformation has been discussed e.g. in [27, p.2] and [50, p.488]. Assume that
f −1 =: g exists and g ′ 6= 0.

Define P (x, t) := f (U (x, t)) as the mean action-potential generating rate so that U = g (P ). Observe that

(42)

However, even with this variable transformation there seems to be little hope to derive a precise Kramers’ rule for the
stochastic Amari model (2) by generalizing the approach for SPDE systems [4, 6, 7]. The problems are as follows:

12

Christian Kuehn, Martin G. Riedler

– There is still a space-time dependent nonlinear prefactor 1/g ′ (P (x, t)) in (42) for the deterministic system, so the system
is not an exact gradient flow for a potential.
– Applying the change-of-variable Pt (x) := f (Ut (x)) for the stochastic Amari model (2) requires an Itô-type formula so
that

g (Pt (x))
B
where M (Pt (x)) is now a multiplicative noise term; see [55] and references therein for more details on infinitedimensional Itô-type formulas. The higher-order term O(ǫ2 ) in the drift part of (43) is not expected to cause difficulties
but a multiplicative noise structure definitely excludes the direct application of Kramers’ law.
– Even if we would just assume - without any immediate physical motivation - that the noise term in (43) is purely additive
ǫdWt (x) there is a problem to apply Kramers’ law since we do not have a structure like in (22) with G(·) = Id as
Wt (x) is a Q-Wiener process defined in (5) and driving space-time white noise in (4) is particularly excluded due to the
non-existence of a solution.
Based on these observations an immediate approach to generalize a sharp Kramers’ formula to neural fields seems
unlikely. Hence we try to understand an LDP for the stochastic Amari-type model (2).
7 Direct Approach to an LDP
A general direct approach for the derivation of an LDP for infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations is presented
in [23] and further results have been obtained for certain additional classes of SPDEs [17, 19, 18, 57]. The results in [23] are
valid for semilinear equations with suitable Lipschitz assumptions on the nonlinearity and with solutions taking values in
C (D). We state the available results applied to continuous solutions of the Amari equation (4) assuming that the conditions
of Lemma 2.1 are satisfied.
For the following we assume that there exists an open neighbourhood D ∈ C (B) containing a stable equilibrium state
u∗ of the deterministic Amari equation (16) such that D̄ is contained in the basin of attraction of u∗ . We are interested in the
rate function and the first-exit time of the process from D given by
ǫ
τD
= inf {t ≥ 0 : U ∈
/ D}

if U starts in the deterministic equilibrium state u∗ . In order to state the quasipotential for u we consider the control system
ẏ = −αy + KF (y ) + Q1/2 v,

y0 = x ∈ C ( B )

(44)

for controls v ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (B)) for all T > 0 and denote by y x,v its unique mild solution2 taking values in C ([0, T ], C (B))
for all T > 0. Then we define

where this quasipotential relates to the minimal energy necessary to move the control system (44) started at the equilibrium
state u∗ to z .

Following further the exposition in [23, Sec. 12] explicit formulae for the rate function I are only available in the
special case of the drift possessing gradient structure and space-time white noise. As we have argued above, this structure is
particularly not satisfied for neural field equations. Hence, the same observations as presented at the end of the last section
prevent a further direct analytic approach to the LDP. Therefore, we try to understand the LDP problem for a discretized
approximate finite-dimensional version of the neural field equation.
2 The existence of such a solution is guaranteed by standard results on deterministic equations (cf.[23, Sect. A.3]) as long as Q1/2 maps
L2 (B) continuously into C(B). This is easily established. The unique square root Q1/2 of Q is the Hilbert-Schmidt operator given by Q1/2 g =

Hence the upper bound, which is finite due to (7), is in independent of x and converges to zero for N → ∞. Moreover, we further find that
g(t) ∈ L2 ((0, T ), L2 (B)) implies Q1/2 g(t) ∈ L2 ((0, T ), C(B)).

8 Galerkin Approximation
Throughout the section we assume that the assumptions (H1)–(H3) are satisfied. As a discretized version of the neural field
equation (2) we consider its spectral Galerkin approximations; recall that the solution Ut of (2) lies in C ([0, T ], L2 (B)) as
discussed in Section (2). In order to decouple the noise, we define the spectral representation of the solution
Ut (x) =

∞
X

uit vi (x) .

(46)

i=1

Here the orthonormal basis functions vi are given by the eigenfunctions of the covariance operator of the noise with corresponding eigenvalues λ2i , see equation (5). To obtain a equation for the coefficients uit we take the inner product of equation
(4) with the basis functions vi which yields


hdUt , vi i = −αhUt , vi i + hKF (Ut ), vi i dt + ǫhdWt , vi i
for i ∈ N.
After plugging in (46) we obtain for ui the countable Galerkin system

Galerkin approximations. We have deferred the proof of the theorem to the appendix.

9 Approximating the LDP
The LDP in Theorem 7.1 is not immediately computable. Here we show that a finite-dimensional approximation can be made
and what the structure of this approximation entails. For simplicity, consider the case when the diagonal diffusion matrix D
with entries Dii = λ2i is positive definite i.e. λi 6= 0 for all i ∈ N. Observe that the inverse of D induces an inner product on
RN for N ∈ N ∪ {∞} via
ha, biN := aT (D)−1 b = [D−1/2 a]T [D−1/2 b]

for a, b ∈ RN ,

where D is understood as the projection onto RN ×N if N < ∞. We are also going to use the notation introduced in Section
8 for the Galerkin approximation i.e. u·,N
denotes the vector
t
(u1t ,N , u2t ,N , . . . , uN,N
) T ∈ RN
t

(53)

where u·,N
denotes the solutions of the N -dimensional system (50). Note that throughout this section we shall always work
t
with the Galerkin coefficients, e.g., ut refers to the vector
(u1t , u2t , . . .)T ∈ R∞ .
Furthermore, for arbitrary functions φt ∈ L2 (B), which are used in the formulation of the rate function, we use the notation
φ·,N
to denote the projection onto the first N Galerkin coefficients. Theorem 5.1 immediately implies the following:

Recall from Section 7 that Theorem 7.1 provides a large deviation principle. For the case when Q is a positive operator,
we may formally re-write the control system (44) as
D−1/2 [ẏ − (−αy + KF (y ))] = v

so that the rate function for the Amari model can be expressed as

Hence we may work with the finite-dimensional Galerkin system and its LDP for computational purposes. However, the
truncation N may still be very large. We are going to show, using a formal analysis for a certain case, that there is an intrinsic
multi-scale structure of the rate function. We assume that we are in the special case considered in Section 3 where K and Q
have the same eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by λi and λ2i , respectively.

and observe that the result is independent of N .
It is important to point out that the LDP from Theorem 5.1 requires the infimum of the rate function. From Lemma
9.1 we know that the rate function splits into three terms. The three terms are interesting in the asymptotic limit N → ∞.

We remark that several typical functions f discussed in Section 2 such as f (u) = (1 + e−u )−1 and f (u) = (tanh(u) +
1)/2 are globally bounded so that Lemma 9.2 does apply to many practical cases. In this situation we get that

We make a case distinction between the different relative asymptotics of κ(N ) and λN . Note that the following asymptotic
relations are purely formal:
– If κ(N ) ≪ λN or κ(N ) ∼ λN as N → ∞ then we can conclude that κ(N ) → 0 i.e.
→0
(φN,N

as N → 0

(59)

since for trace-class noise we know that λN → 0. If we formally require that (φN,N

= 0 for N sufficiently

large then the higher-order Galerkin modes decays exponentially in time
e−αt .
φN,N

– If κ(N ) ≫ λN as N → ∞ then a1 ≫ −2a2 + a3 and the first term dominates the asymptotics. But aN
1 ≥ 0 for all N so
that the rate function only has a finite infimum if aN
→

as
N
→
∞
.
This
implies
again
that
(59)
holds
for the case of
1
a finite infimum.
Hence we get in many reasonable first-exit problems for the Amari model with trace-class noise that there is a finite
set for n ≤ N of ‘slow’ or ‘center-like’ directions and an infinite set of ‘fast’ or ‘stable’ directions for n > N . Although
we have made this observation from the rate function alone, it is entirely natural considering the structure of the Galerkin
approximation. Indeed, for the case when the eigenvalues of K and Q are related we may write (50) as


−αu

so that for bounded nonlinearity f , which is represented in the terms [· · · ] in (60), the higher-order modes should really just
be governed by dui,N
= −αui,N
dt.
t
t
Hence, Propositions 9.1-9.2 and the multi-scale nature of the problem induced by the trace-class noise suggest a procedure how to approximate the rate function and the associated LDP in practice. In particular, we may compute the eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions of K and Q up to a sufficiently large given order N ∗ . This yields an explicit representation of the Galerkin
system and the associated rate function. Then one may apply any finite-dimensional technique to understand the rate function. One may even find a better truncation order N < N ∗ based on the knowledge that the minimizer of the rate function
must have components that decay (almost) exponentially in time for orders bigger than N .

10 Outlook
In this paper we have discussed several steps towards a better understanding of noise-induced transitions in continuum neural
fields. Although we have provided the main basic elements via the LDP and finite-dimensional approximations, there are
still several very interesting open problems.
We have demonstrated that a sharp Kramers’ rate calculation for neural fields with trace-class noise is very challenging
as the techniques for white-noise gradient-structure SPDEs cannot be applied directly. However, we have seen in Section 4
that the deterministic dynamics for neural fields frequently exhibits a classical bistable structure with a saddle-state between
stable equilibria. This suggests that there should be a Kramers’ law with exponential scaling in the noise intensity as well
as a precisely computable pre-factor. It is interesting to ask how this pre-factor depends on the eigenvalues of the trace-class
operator Q definining the Q-Wiener process. We expect that new technical tools are needed to answer this question.
From the viewpoint of experimental data the exponential scaling for the LDP is relevant as it shows that noise-induced
transitions have exponential interarrival times. This leads to the possibility that working memory as well as perceptual
bistability could be governed by a Poisson process. However, the same phenomena could also be governed by a slowly
varying variable i.e. by an adaptive neural field [12]; the ‘fast’ activity variable U in the Amari model is augmented by one
or more ‘slow’ variables. In this context, the required assumptions on the equilibrium structure in Section 4 and the noise in
Section 3 are not necessary to produce a bistable switch and the fast variable U can, e.g., just have a single deterministically
unstable equilibrium and bistable, non-random switching between metastable states may occur. Of course, there is also the
possibility that an intermediate regime between noise-induced and deterministic escape is relevant [52].

Large Deviations for Nonlocal Stochastic Neural Fields

17

It is interesting to note that the same problem arises generically across many natural sciences in the study of critical
transitions (or ‘tipping points’) [59, 47]. The question which escape mechanism from a metastable state matches the data is
often discussed very controversially and we shall not aim to provide a discussion here. However, our main goal to make the
LDP and its associated rate functional as explicit as possible should definitely help to simplify comparison between models
and experiment. For example, a parameter study or data assimilation for the finite-dimensional Galerkin system considered
in Theorem 8.1 and the associated rate function in Proposition 9.1 are often easier than working directly with the abstract
solutions of the stochastic Amari model in C ([0, T ], L2 (B)).
To study the parameter dependence is an interesting open question which we aim to address in future work. In particular,
the next step is to use the Galerkin approximations in Section 8 and the associated LDP in Section 9 for numerical purposes
[48]. Recent work for SPDEs [8] suggests that a spectral method can also be efficient for stochastic neural fields. Results on
numerical continuation and jump heights for SDEs [46] can also be immediately transferred to the spectral approximation
which would allow for studies of bifurcations and associated noise-induced phenomena.
One may also ask how far the technical assumptions we make in this paper can be weakened. It is not clear which parts
of the global Lipschitz assumptions may be replaced by local assumptions or removed altogether. Similar remarks apply to
the multiscale nature of the problem induced by the decay of the eigenvalues of Q. How far this observation can be exploited
to derive more efficient analytical as well as numerical techniques remains to be investigated.
On a more abstract level it would certainly be desirable to extend our basic framework to other topics that
R have been considered already for deterministic neural fields. A generalization to activity based models with nonlinearity f ( B w(x, y )u(y )dy )
seems possible. Furthermore, it may be highly desirable to go beyond stationary solutions and investigate noise-induced
switching and transitions for travelling waves and patterns.

A Convergence of the Galerkin Approximation
Proof (Proof of Theorem 8.1) We fix a T > 0. Throughout the proof an unspecified norm k · k or operator norm ||| · |||, respectively, are either
for the Hilbert space L2 (B) or the Banach space C(B) and estimates using the unspecified notation are valid in both cases. Furthermore, C > 0
denotes an arbitrary deterministic constant which may change from line to line but depend only on T . We begin the proof obtaining an a-priori
growth bound on the solution of the Amari equation (4). Using the linear growth condition on F implied by its Lipschitz continuity we obtain the
estimate

Due to Gronwall’s inequality there exists a deterministic constant C such that it holds almost surely

Note that O is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and it thus holds supt∈[0,T ] kOt kL2 < ∞ almost surely and under the assumptions of Lemma 2.1
in addition supt∈[0,T ] kOt k0 < ∞ almost surely.
Let P N denote the projection operator from L2 (B) to the subspace spanned by the first N basis functions. Then we find that in Hilbert space
notation the N -th Galerkin approximation satisfies
Z t

Next, using the Lipschitz and linear growth conditions on F , applying Gronwall’s inequality, taking the supremum over all t ∈ [0, T ] and estimating
using the bound (61) yield

It remains to show that the individual terms in the right hand side converge to zero for N → ∞ almost surely.
– It clearly holds that kU0 − P N U0 kL2 → 0 and the convergence kU0 − P N U0 k0 → 0 holds by assumption.


– Next, as argued above 1 + kU0 k + supt∈[0,T ] kOt k is a.s. finite and the compactness of the operator K implies |||K − P N K||| → 0 for
N → ∞, see [3, Lemma 12.1.4].
– Finally, the third error term supt∈[0,T ] kOt − OtN k vanishes if the Galerkin approximations O N of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process O
converge almost surely in the spaces C([0, T ], L2 (B)) and C([0, T ], C(B)), respectively. This convergence is proven in Lemma A.1 below.
The proof is completed.
The following lemma contains the convergence of the Galerkin approximation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process necessary for proving Theorem 8.1.
Lemma A.1 There exists a sequence bN > 0 with limN→∞ bN = 0 such that for all T > 0 and all δ > 0 there exists a random variable Zδ

yield a rate of convergence for the Galerkin approximation due to the definition of the constants bN in the proof of the lemma.
Proof As in the proof Theorem 8.1 the unspecified norm k · k denotes either the norm in L2 (B) or in C(B) and estimates are valid in both cases.
We fix T > 0, ρ ∈ (0, 1) and a p ∈ N with p > 2d/ρ. Throughout the proof C > 0 denotes a constant that changes from line to line but depends
only on the fixed parameters T, p, ρ, α and the domain B ⊂ Rd .
Then we obtain for all N, M ∈ N with M < N using the factorization method (cf. [23, Sec. 5.3]) similarly to the proof of [8, Lemma 5.6] the

with respect to convergence in the p-th mean and the limit is given by the process O. Moreover, it holds that

where the constant C depends only on p but is independent of N and the sequence bN is independent of p and limN→∞ bN = 0. As we fixed
p ∈ N sufficiently large at the beginning of the proof, the result (69) holds for all sufficiently large p ∈ N. Then, however, Jensen’s inequality implies
that (69) holds for all p ∈ [1, ∞). Proceeding as in the proof of [43, Lemma 2.1] using the Chebyshev-Markov inequality and the Borel-Cantelli
lemma one obtains that there exists for all δ > 0 a random variable Zδ with E|Zδ |p < ∞ for all p ≥ 1 such that
