Abstract Having a precise knowledge of the dispersal ability of a population in a heterogeneous environment is of critical importance in agroecology and conservation biology as it can
provide management tools to limit the effects of pests or to increase the survival of endangered
species. In this paper, we propose a mechanistic-statistical method to estimate space-dependent
diffusion parameters of spatially-explicit models based on stochastic differential equations, using genetic data. Dividing the total population into subpopulations corresponding to different
habitat patches with known allele frequencies, the expected proportions of individuals from
each subpopulation at each position is computed by solving a system of reaction-diffusion equations. Modelling the capture and genotyping of the individuals with a statistical approach, we
derive a numerically tractable formula for the likelihood function associated with the diffusion
parameters.
In a simulated environment made of three types of regions, each associated with a different diffusion coefficient, we successfully estimate the diffusion parameters with a maximumlikelihood approach. Although higher genetic differentiation among subpopulations leads to
more accurate estimations, once a certain level of differentiation has been reached, the finite
size of the genotyped population becomes the limiting factor for accurate estimation.

1 Introduction
Dispersal is one of the main forces driving population redistribution (Turchin 1998), gene flow
(Slatkin 1987; Bohonak 1999) and genetic diversity (Hewitt 2000; Roques et al. 2012, 2014).
Dispersal directly affects population flows between different spatial positions. Having a precise
knowledge of these flows is of critical importance in agroecology and conservation biology, as it
can provide management tools to limit the effects of pests (Gilligan 2008; Papaı̈x et al. 2011)
or to increase the survival of endangered species (Hanski and Gilpin 1996) by acting on the
landscape structure.
In heterogeneous environments, dispersal is often influenced by local landscape features.
This local effect of the landscape on mobility can be captured by most spatially-explicit models
at the scale of individual movement, such as in random walk models and stochastic differential
equations (Preisler et al. 2004; Smouse et al. 2010) or at the scale of population density in
reaction-diffusion models (Shigesada and Kawasaki 1997; Cantrell and Cosner 2003; Ovaskainen
et al. 2008; Roques 2013), through a space-dependent mobility parameter.
Traditionally, Euclidian distances and least-cost distances have been used, e.g. in models
of isolation by distance (Wright 1943; Rousset 1997; Broquet et al. 2006), to quantify the
population flows. However, these approaches have several drawbacks; in particular, least-cost
distances are based on a subjective definition of a cost function and assume a single and optimal
migration path. Resistance-based approaches are more realistic (McRae 2006; Graves et al.
2014), as the resistance distance is computed in a similar manner as in an electrical network,
where all possible paths are taken into account. However, the computation of resistance distances
is time-consuming and generally does not allow for a precise estimation of the local resistance
parameter, e.g. by maximum likelihood, but rather to test a limited set of conjectured resistance
values (Graves et al. 2013), leading again to a subjective parametrization of the local resistance
values. Additionally, although there exist random walk interpretations of the effective resistance
in electrical networks (Doyle and Snell 1984), these approaches are not based on a mechanistic
description of the spatio-temporal dynamics of a population (see Theorems 1 and 2 in Tetali
1991), and therefore do not directly quantify population flows.
The method developed in this paper enables direct and fast estimations of a spatiallyheterogeneous parameter D(x) measuring the local mobility of individuals at the space position
x, in mechanistic models based on stochastic differential equations. More precisely, we assumed
that the individual trajectories followed Itō diffusion processes, corresponding to uncorrelated
random walks with spatially-varying speed. This framework is widely used for analyzing movement, see Preisler et al. (2004); Smouse et al. (2010) and the references therein. In this framework, the expected population density at any time and space position can be computed using
the corresponding Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (Gardiner 2009) with diffusion
parameters D(x). Here, we also took into account death events occurring at exponentially distributed times, leading to a reaction-diffusion description of the population density. Thanks to
a well-developed theory for their numerical analysis and efficient softwares (e.g., freefem++,
c
see Hecht (2012), or Comsol Multiphysics
), the numerical computation of the solutions of
such reaction-diffusion equations is fast and reliable, even in the presence of heterogeneous coefficients. This makes them ideally suited for parameter estimation (Soubeyrand and Roques
2014).
Several types of data can be used for the estimation of dispersal parameters in population
models. Most studies bear on abundance data (Roques et al. 2011) or on mark-recapture experiments (Turchin 1998; Ovaskainen et al. 2008), where individuals are marked with different
technics, such as color markers or radioactive isotopes (Southwood and Henderson 2009). As
opposed to this marking experiments, passive surveys of the relative abundance of genetic markers that are naturally present in a population lead to spatio-temporal data which can be easier
to obtain and more informative (Robledo-Arnuncio 2012). Here, we considered the dispersal of
individuals starting from several habitats and which eventually died, defining the end of the
dispersal period. The estimation of the parameter D(x) was based on measurements of the
genotypes of individuals captured at several positions during the dispersal process, the location

of the habitats and the allele frequencies before dispersal in these sites being considered as
known. Although numerous methods have been developed in landscape genetics to estimate
dispersal from molecular markers (Hamrick and Trapnell 2011) we are not aware of any article
estimating diffusion parameters from such data.
The method is based on a mechanistic-statistical approach (Berliner 2003; Wikle 2003;
Ovaskainen et al. 2008; Soubeyrand et al. 2009; Roques et al. 2011; Soubeyrand and Roques
2014) included in the framework of state-space models (Patterson et al. 2008; Durbin and
Koopman 2012). This approach typically combines a mechanistic model describing the dynamics under investigation with a statistical model conditional on the dynamics, describing how the
measurements have been collected, bridging the gap between the data and the model for the
dynamics. In the mechanistic part of our model, we divided the total population into subpopulations at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, each one corresponding to the individuals coming from
a different habitat patch. The dynamics of the different subpopulations were then described by
a system of reaction-diffusion equations, as in Roques et al. (2012). Given a diffusion coefficient
D(x), this allowed us to compute the expected proportions of individuals from each subpopulation at each space position. Conversely, the genotype data contain information about these
proportions; namely, the probability to observe a given genotype at some trapping location
depends on the respective contributions of each subpopulation and on the allele frequencies in
these subpopulations. Modelling the capture of the individuals with a statistical approach, and
using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumption in each subpopulation as a key ingredient,
it was therefore possible to derive a numerically tractable formula for the likelihood function
associated with the diffusion parameters D(x), given the genotypes of the captured individuals.

2 Models
Modelling dispersal and death. We begin with a Lagrangian description of the individual movements. We assumed that the positions of the individuals followed 2-dimensional spaceheterogeneous Itō diffusion processes, corresponding to uncorrelated random walks. This means
that the individuals travel at random, with no drift in any particular direction (Preisler et al.
2004; Smouse et al. 2010). However, the mobility of the individuals can be influenced by their
position. The corresponding stochastic differential equation for the position Xt ∈ R2 of an
individual at time t can be written:
p
(2.1)
dXt = 2D(Xt )dWt ,
where Wt is the 2−dimensional Wiener process (Brownian motion). The coefficient D(Xt ) is
called the diffusion coefficient. With this model, in a small time interval of length τ, each
coordinate of Xt is incremented by a normally distributed value with mean 0 and variance
2 τ D. Thus, D(x) is a measure of the local mobility of the individuals. When D is constant,
the stochastic differential equation (2.1) corresponds to the standard Brownian motion.
We also assumed that each individual had a life expectancy ν > 0, the death events being independent and identically distributed and modelled by exponential distributions with
parameter 1/ν.
Under these assumptions, we can switch to an Eulerian description of the population. The
expected population density u(t, x) at time t and position x, starting from an initial distribution
u0 satisfies the following Fokker-Planck reaction-diffusion equation (see e.g. Gardiner 2009):

study region. For this equation to be well-posed, some conditions on the boundary ∂Ω of Ω have
to be specified. In the computations of this paper, we assumed absorbing conditions (u(t, x) = 0
on ∂Ω). Reflecting conditions (∇(D(x)u(t, x)) · n(x) = 0 on ∂Ω, where n(x) is the outward
normal to Ω) could have been assumed as well.
The quantity u0 is called the pre-dispersal density. It corresponds to the density of individuals at a motionless stage, such as eggs, pupae or larvas in insect populations or immature seeds
in plants. The quantity u(t, x) is the (expected) density of dispersers, e.g. insects at the adult
stage or dispersing seeds. We assumed a zero pre-dispersal density outside some known disjoint
subsets (habitats) Ω h , h = 1, . . . , H, where u0 is positive and constant (equal to α > 0):

u0 (x) =

α 1x∈Ω h , for all x ∈ Ω,

(2.3)

where 1x∈Ω h is the characteristic function of the set Ω h : it takes the value 1 in Ω h and 0
anywhere else. A possible gradual release of the pre-dispersal populations could also be assumed
by considering a slightly modified version of the equation (2.2), see Appendix A.
Modelling the capture of individuals from different sources. We considered the case of nonattractive traps, corresponding to disjoint sets θτ , τ = 1, . . . , J in the study site. We assumed
that the expected number of individuals Cτ captured in a trap θτ was proportional to the
cumulated population in θτ :

and βτ the capture rate (number of captured individuals per unit of time per unit of area in the
trap θτ ). Note that u(t, x) ≤ e−t/ν max u0 ; this means that the value of w∞ (x) can be precisely

approached by computing the above integral over a finite interval. For sufficiently small traps,
w∞ (x) can be considered constant in θτ , which leads to:
Cτ = βτ |θτ | w∞ (xτ ),

(2.5)

where xτ is the location of the center of the trap θτ , and |θτ | is the trap area.
Remark 1 With this approach, the trapping process has no influence on the species dynamics,
i.e., the trapped individuals are not removed from the system. To avoid this lack of realism, a
sink term −βτ u1x∈θτ could be added to the right-hand side of (2.2). For the sake of simplicity,
we assumed that the traps were small enough to consider that this term could be neglected.
Consider now the density uh (t, x) of individuals coming from a given habitat Ω h . Since all
the individuals are supposed to share the same dispersal and death characteristics independently
of their origin, the densities uh (t, x) satisfy (Roques et al. 2012):

(2.6)

uh (0, x) = uh0 (x) = α 1x∈Ω h , for all x ∈ Ω,

(2.7)

and
with the same boundary conditions as the total population u. The dynamics of the different
fractions uh of the total population u is therefore described by a system of H decoupled reactiondiffusion equations. Summing up all these equations, it can be checked that for all t, x,
u(t, x) =

uh (t, x).

trap θτ is then given by:

We assumed that the population was large enough so that the number of captured individuals
was larger than a constant G in all traps. This constant corresponds to the number of individuals
genotyped in each trap.
3 Parameters and data
Our goal was to estimate the diffusion parameters D(x) for all x ∈ Ω. Other unknown parameters are the pre-dispersal density in the habitats (α) and the capture rates in the different traps
(βτ ).
We assumed that the global population before dispersal, u0 , was organised into several subpopulations each of which was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium among
loci. For the sake of clarity, we assumed that there were exactly H subpopulations, with densities uh0 = α 1x∈Ω h , each one corresponding to a habitat Ω h . More complex assumptions are
also possible, see Remark 3.
The positions of the habitats Ω h and of the traps θτ were known. For each subpopulation h
and each locus λ (e.g. microsatellites) out of Λ loci, the pre-dispersal frequencies of Aλ alleles
were known and designated as:
Fhλ = (phλa )a=1,...,Aλ .

(3.9)

The individuals captured in θτ were genotyped at the same Λ loci. These individuals were
assumed to be diploid; thus, each genotype was described by:

	
G = (a1λ , a2λ ) λ=1,...,Λ .

4 Computation of the likelihood
The computation of genotype likelihoods builds on a combination of classical genetic assignment
studies (Paetkau et al. 1995; Pritchard et al. 2000) and seed dispersal analyses from trap data
(Robledo-Arnuncio and Garcia 2007; Klein et al. 2013).
Among the individuals captured in a trap θτ , G individuals have been genotyped. This led
to G genotypes Giτ , i = 1, . . . , G.
The conditional probability that an individual i carries alleles (a1 , a2 ) ∈ {1, . . . , Aλ }2 at
locus λ, given that this individual comes from a habitat Ω h , can be deduced from the allele
frequencies in subpopulation h (see Section 3). The two alleles being independent, which follows
from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumption in the subpopulation uh0 , we get:
P((a1 , a2 )|Ω h ) = 2kλ phλa1 phλa2 ,

(4.10)

where kλ = 0 if the individual is homozygous at locus λ (a1 = a2 ) and kλ = 1 otherwise. Using
the linkage equilibrium assumption among loci, we get the conditional probability of genotype
Giτ :

P(Giτ |Ω h ) = 2ki

where ki is the number of heterozygous loci in the genotype Giτ .
Remark 2 For the sake of simplicity, the dependence of a1 and a2 with respect to the locus λ
and the individual i have been dropped in our notations. For instance, in formula (4.11), a1
and a2 may designate different alleles, depending on the locus λ and on the individual i.

We have seen in Section 2 that the expected number of individuals trapped in θτ was given by
Cτ , and the expected number of individuals coming from a habitat Ω h and which are captured
in a trap θτ was given by Cτh . Let us denote by Iτh the number of individuals coming from Ω h
and captured in θτ , and let us set
Iτ =

h=1

Iτh ≥ G,

(4.13)

the total number of individuals captured in θτ . Assume that Iτh follows a Poisson distribution:
Iτh ∼ P(Cτh ).

(4.14)

Thus, Iτ also follows a Poisson distribution with parameter
Cτ =

S
X

Cτh .

h=1

It can be verified that the conditional distribution of Iτh given Iτ satisfies a binomial distribution
with parameters Iτ and Cτh /Cτ . Thus, the conditional expectation of the proportion Iτh /Iτ given
Iτ is Cτh /Cτ , which is independent of Iτ . Finally, this shows that:

distribution with parameters Iτ , Iτh and G. For large values of Iτ , this distribution converges to
the multinomial distribution with parameters G and (Iτ1 /Iτ , . . . , IτH /Iτ ). Using this multinomial
distribution, we can compute the probability that a genotyped individual i trapped in θτ comes
from a habitat h:

The hypergeometric distribution would lead to the same formula, but the advantage of the

where k is the total number of heterozygous loci in the genotyped population. Coming back to
the definitions (2.5) and (2.8) of Cτ and Cτh , we can compute the ratio:

Cτ
w∞ (xτ )

(4.17)

This shows that Cτh /Cτ is independent of the capture rates βτ . From the linearity of the
h
and w∞ are proportional to α which means
equations (2.2) and (2.6), it follows that w∞
h
that the ratio Cτ /Cτ is also independent of the choice of α. Thus, the likelihood L(D) can
be computed with an arbitrary choice of parameters, e.g. α, βτ = 1. Note that if the source
intensity α was spatially variable, it would not simplify in the expression Cτh /Cτ . In such case,
α should be estimated in each source, which is only possible up to a multiplicative constant
since Cτh would be proportional to the value of α in each habitat h.
Remark 3 We recall that u0 was organised into several subpopulations at Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. Here, we assumed that, before dispersal, these subpopulations coincided with the
habitats, which were disjoint. A first easy generalization would be to consider several subpopulations in the same habitat. Assume that there are R subpopulations with pre-dispersal densities

Fig. 1 Study site Ω = (0, 1) × (0, 1) with six habitats Ω h of centers xh , for h = 1, . . . , 6. The grey region
Q corresponds to a barrier to dispersal. Blue crosses correspond to the positions of the first 10 traps θτ , τ =
1, . . . , 10; red crosses correspond to the positions of a supplementary set of ten additional traps θτ , τ = 11, . . . , 20.

5.1 Simulated data set
Landscape. The study site Ω was a unit square (0, 1) × (0, 1) containing H = 6 habitats Ω h ,
described by balls BR (xh ) of radius R = 0.05 and centers xh ∈ Ω and a rectangular region
Q = (q − R/2, q + R/2) × (0, 1) modelling a barrier to dispersal (q = 0.5). The rest of the study
site was considered as the matrix (Fig 1).
The general idea was to consider diffusion parameters D1 in the matrix, D2 = D1 /2 in
the habitats and D3 = D1 /10 in the barrier. However, for the well-posedness of the reactiondiffusion equations for u and uh , the coefficient D(x) had to be positive and smooth. We thus
defined the heterogeneous diffusion parameters D(x) as:
!
H
X
D(x) = exp d1 + d2
φ(x − xh ) + d3 ψ(x) ,
(5.20)
h=1

for smooth positive functions φ and ψ, such that φ(x−xh ) was compactly supported in B2 R (xh )
for any h = 1, . . . , S and ψ was compactly supported in (q − R, q + R) × (0, 1) and max φ =
max ψ = 1. The precise shape of φ and ψ is detailed in Appendix B. The numerical values of
d1 , d2 and d3 that we used in our computations were:
d1 = log(0.01), d2 = − log(2), and d3 = − log(10).

(5.21)

With this framework, the diffusion parameters were equal to D1 = 10−2 in the matrix, far
from the habitats and from the barrier, to D2 = D1 /2 at the center of the habitats and to
D3 = D1 /10 at the center of the barrier. See Remark 4 for some comments on these parameter
values.
Remark 4 Assuming that the unit square corresponds to a 10km × 10km region, and that the
unit of time is one day, a diffusion parameter D = 10−2 corresponds to 1km2 /day. Using the
formula (see e.g. Turchin 1998; Roques 2013):

for random walk movements with one direction change per minute this value of the diffusion
parameter corresponds to a flying speed of 53m per minute. Under the same assumptions,
D = 10−2 /2 and D = 10−2 /10 correspond to flying speeds of 37m and 17m per minute,
respectively. See Kareiva (1983) for reference values of diffusion parameters of several insect
species.
Allele frequencies. The number of loci and the number of alleles at each locus were Λ = 10
and A = 10. Following Pritchard et al. (2000), we drew the allele frequencies in a flat Dirichlet
distribution, with concentration parameter q in each subpopulation h and for each locus λ :
Fsλ ∼ D(q).

(5.22)

Values of q larger than 1 lead to evenly distributed frequencies, whereas smaller values of q lead
to distributions which are concentrated on a few components. In our simulations, we adjusted
the value of q such that the fixation index FST among subpopulations (see Appendix C) was
close to 0.01, 0.05 or 0.1 (Table 2), with a relative tolerance of 0.1%.
Simulation of the measured data. We solved the reaction-diffusion models for the cumulated
h
population densities w∞ and w∞
, for h = 1, . . . , 6 with the true diffusion parameter values
(5.21) and ν = 5 for the life expectancy of the dispersers (see Appendix D). The proportions
(Cτh /Cτ )h=1,...,6 have been computed using formulas (2.5) and (2.8). We recall that, from formuh
las (4.15) and (4.17), Cτh /Cτ = w∞
(xτ )/w∞ (xτ ) is the probability that an individual trapped
h
h
in θτ comes from the habitat Ω . The probability w∞
(x)/w∞ (x) can be computed at each point
in Ω; it is depicted in Fig. 2. Movies of the dynamics of the probability wth (x)/wt (x) that an

(5.23)

For each of the 12 sets of parameters (FST , J, J G), we simulated 70 data sets M. For each
data set, the estimator (dˆ1 , dˆ2 , dˆ3 ) of (d1 , d2 , d3 ) has been obtained by minimizing − log(L(D))
(see formula (4.16)). The minimization was performed using the Matlabr constrained gradientbased minimization algorithm fmincon, with the constraint
(dˆ1 , dˆ2 , dˆ3 ) ∈ (d1 − 5, d1 + 5) × (d2 − 5, d2 + 5) × (d3 − 5, d3 + 5).

(5.24)

In the computation of − log(L(D)), the numerical evaluation of the quantities (Cτh /Cτ )h=1,...,6
was based on the finite element method as described in Appendix D. The average computation
time for one estimation was about 45min with a dual Core Intelr processor, while the computation of the likelihood took about 5sec. The Bayesian method (Marin and Robert 2007) would
be more computationally intensive, but it could also be used to compute a posterior distribution
of D(x) at each position x.
5.2 Results
The typical profile of the log of the likelihood function (4.16) is depicted in Fig 3 for one
simulation with FST = 0.05, J = 20 traps and G J = 2000 individuals. The likelihood tends to
decay as (d˜1 , d˜2 , d˜3 ) diverges from the true value (d1 , d2 , d3 ), suggesting an efficient parameter
estimation by maximum likelihood, even with the constraint (5.24) was relaxed.
The direct analysis of the quality of the estimator (dˆ1 , dˆ2 , dˆ3 ) is presented in Table 2, in
terms of the FST value, the number of traps and the number of genotyped individuals. In this
section, we focus on the more biologically meaningful estimators

which can be directly compared to the values D1 , D2 , D3 of the diffusion parameter in each of
the three regions (matrix far from the other regions, center of the habitats and center of the
barrier, respectively).
For each FST value (0.01, 0.05 and 0.1), with J = 20 traps and J G = 2000 genotyped
individuals, we observe in Fig. 4 that the median of D̂ is correctly centered on the true value of

FST values, the number of outliers is reduced and they are closer to the true value (2 outliers
in the habitats and the barrier for FST =0.05 and only 2 outliers in the habitats region for
FST =0.1). In the three regions (matrix/habitats/barrier), the interquartile ranges are reduced
as the FST is increased from 0.01 to 0.05; this decrease of the interquartile ranges by a factor
2 in average indicates a strong effect of the FST on the accuracy of the estimation. There is no
clear difference between the interquartile ranges corresponding to FST = 0.05 and FST = 0.1;
however, the bias and the standard deviation of (dˆ1 , dˆ2 , dˆ3 ) are still improved when the FST is
increased from 0.05 to FST = 0.1 (see Table 2).

discrimination power of our genetic system. As expected, increasing the FST leads to higher
discrimination power (Fig. 5). With our parameters (H = 6, Λ = 10, A = 10), the discrimination
power is about 0.5 for an FST of 0.01; it reaches 0.9 for an FST of 0.05 and 0.99 for an FST of 0.1.
This explains the gap between the quality of the estimators obtained with the FST values larger
than 0.05, compared to the case FST = 0.01. This could also explain the small difference in the
accuracy of the estimation when the FST is increased to 0.1, compared to the case FST = 0.05.
Additionally, we note that it does not seem necessary to go beyond the value FST =0.1 to get a
very high discrimination power. This also means that the variability in our estimator D̂, when
FST =0.1, is not due to an uncertainty on the habitat of origin of the genotyped individuals,
but rather to the sampling variability due to the limited number of these individuals.
Fig. 5 also shows the effect of the number of habitats, the number of loci and the number
of alleles. Increasing the number of alleles per locus or the number of loci have a comparable
effect, with in both cases an increase in the discrimination power. For FST values close to 0, the
discrimination power converges to 1/H, meaning that very small genetic differentiation between
the subpopulations leads to equiprobable habitat of origin. In such case, the data contain no
information on the origin of the trapped individuals, and the estimation of D is therefore not
possible. For larger values of the FST , increasing the number of sites always leads to lower
discrimination power.
The results in Fig. 6 show, for FST = 0.1, the effect of the number of traps and of the total
number of genotyped individuals on the quality of the estimator. In all cases, the median of D̂
is close to the true value, in each of the three regions. For a fixed total number of genotyped
individuals, increasing the number of traps J from 10 to 20 does not increase significantly the
quality of the estimator. It can even decrease it in some situations, e.g., the interquartile range
is about twice larger with 20 traps than with 10 traps in the habitats. A possible explanation
for this counterintuitive effect is that, when the number of traps is increased, the number G of
individuals genotyped per trap decreases; in the regions where no traps are added (here, the
habitats, see Fig. 1), this can lead to more uncertainty on the estimator.
The results of Fig. 6 confirm that increasing the number of genotyped individuals leads to
far better estimations: in both cases J = 10 and J = 20, the interquartile ranges are divided
by more than two in average when the total number of genotyped individuals is increased from
J ×G = 500 to J ×G = 2000, and the distance of the outliers to the median (i.e., approximatively
to the true value) is reduced.

6 Discussion
Using broadly-recognized population models based on a mechanistic description of individual
movements (Preisler et al. 2004; Smouse et al. 2010), we have developed an approach to estimate the local effect of the environment on individual mobility, based on genetic data. In an

environment made of three types of regions, each one associated with a different level of mobility – or diffusion – we successfully estimated the diffusion parameters D(x) in each region.
The reaction-diffusion framework enabled a fast computation of expected population densities,
making parameter estimation possible in a reasonable time. Genetic data had already proved
their effectiveness in the estimation of dispersal kernels (Robledo-Arnuncio and Garcia 2007;
Klein et al. 2013) in more empirical models. Our results show that successful estimation of
parameters of mechanistic population models is also possible using genotype measurements
during dispersal and allele frequency data before dispersal, without the need of abundance or
mark-recapture data. Genetic data lead to likelihoods of arriving from a given source, and are
insensitive to the global population size (i.e., to the parameter α in our approach) and to the
relative efficiency of the different traps (the parameters βτ ). This advantage of working on
probabilities of originating from the different sources has already been shown for kernel estimations (Robledo-Arnuncio and Garcia 2007; Klein et al. 2013). A related approach, proposed
by Ovaskainen et al. (2008) allowed to estimate the parameters of a diffusion model, based on
mark-recapture data, with a single type of marks. In our framework, the genotype information,
given the allele frequencies in the different habitats constituting our study-site, can be seen
as mark-recapture data, with several types of marks (one per habitat) and some uncertainty
on the marks of the captured individuals. Mark-recapture experiments with several types of
marks should lead to good estimation results, as they would combine the advantages of our
method (insensitivity to several parameters) and of traditional mark-recapture experiments (no
unknown external sources, perfect knowledge of the frequencies).
The genetic differentiation between the subpopulations corresponding to the different habitats of origin plays a key role in the quality of the estimation, as shown by the strong effect
of the FST , especially on the variability of the estimator. Low FST values are associated with
larger standard deviations and interquartile ranges, which can be explained by a lower posterior probability associated to the true habitat of origin of a genotyped individual. Defining
the discrimination power of our genetic system as the average of this posterior probability, we
could disentangle the effect of the FST and that of the other sources of uncertainty in our estimator of the diffusion parameters D(x). With an intermediate level of genetic differentiation
(FST = 0.05), the discrimination power was high (0.9 with 20 traps and 2000 genotyped individuals), and the quality of our estimator of D(x) was comparable to the case FST = 0.1. With
an FST of 0.1, the discrimination power was close to 1, which is almost exact; the remaining
uncertainty in the determination of D(x) may therefore be sampling variance due to the finite
number of genotyped individuals per trap. It could also be due to the lack of uniqueness in the
inverse problem of determining D(x), even with infinite population sizes. From a theoretical

14

L Roques et al.

viewpoint, the unique determination of diffusion and conductivity coefficients based on a finite
set of measurements is a difficult problem, as illustrated by the Calderón problem (Calderón
1980) of determining the electrical conductivity of a medium for which uniqueness is only proved
with infinitely many observations (Sylvester and Uhlmann 1987; Nachman 1996).
As expected, the size of the post-dispersal sample has a clear effect on the uncertainty of
the estimation. The quality of the estimation, and especially its variability, is clearly improved
when the number of genotyped individuals is increased. If the total number of genotyped loci
and the number of traps were fixed, the trade-off between increasing the number of loci and
the number of genotyped individuals per trap would depend on the main source of uncertainty:
increasing the number of loci per individual increases the discrimination power while increasing
the number of genotyped individuals per trap reduces the sampling variance. The role of the
number of traps is less obvious. Intuitively, increasing the number of traps leads to a better
coverage of the study site, which should have a positive impact on the estimation. However,
with a fixed total number of genotyped individuals, this leads to a decrease in the number
of genotyped individuals per trap and can therefore produce more uncertainty in the regions
where the number of traps has not been increased (the habitats in our simulations). It should be
noted however that too few traps may lead to identifiability problems, as would in the extreme
case of a unique trap placed at equidistance between two habitats in an otherwise homogeneous
landscape.
Remarkably, the estimation of D(x) in the matrix remains accurate, with no outliers among
the estimators of D(x) even with low FST values. This may be the consequence of the larger
area of the matrix compared to the other regions in the landscape leading to a stronger effect
of the value of the diffusion parameter in this region. Conversely, larger standard deviations
and interquartile ranges are observed in the habitats, for all FST values. This cannot be fully
explained by the smaller area of the habitat region, as the estimation on the barrier is more
accurate, with a comparable area. Most of the individuals trapped in a given habitat come from
the same habitat (about 90%). The remaining individuals being sparse, this leads to higher
relative variance in the proportions of individuals trapped in the habitats than in the other
regions, which can explain the lower accuracy of the estimation of the diffusion parameter in
the habitats. Based on these observations, we suspect that the estimation of a single coefficient
in a homogeneous environment would most likely be reliable, even with low FST values, and that
placing the traps far from the release sites should lead to a better estimation of the coefficient
in such case.
In addition to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and independence of loci, an important
assumption in our approach was that the allele frequencies were exactly known in the habitats.
In practice, the frequencies are determined from previously sampled populations. The sample
size is known to have an important effect on successful assignment of genotyped individuals
(Cornuet et al. 1999). Reducing this size should lead to some uncertainty in the allele frequencies
with an effect comparable to that of decreasing the FST , i.e, lowering the discrimination power
of the genotype data. A problematic case noted in Paetkau et al. (1995) and Cornuet et al.
(1999) while studying assignment methods is when some individuals carry an allele which has
not been detected in the sample corresponding to their population of origin, leading to a null
posterior probability that these individuals come from their true habitat. In such case, Paetkau
et al. (1995) suggest to add the genotype of these individuals to the population samples defining
the allele frequencies in all of the habitats.
In our study, the allele frequencies are determined before dispersal, in individuals from the
same generation as the trapped individuals. At each generation, the allele frequencies are modified, due to drift and gene flow among habitat patches. Thus, using allele frequencies sampled
from previous generations could lead to an inaccuracy in the frequencies which depends on the
gene flow and on the number of generations before the capture of the genotyped dispersers.
To estimate the effect of the population flows on the allele frequencies after one generation,
we computed the quantity Cτh /Cτ , for τ = h, corresponding to the proportion of individuals
captured in Ω h , whose habitat of origin is Ω h . The values clearly depend on the proximity of
another habitat, with a ratio of 0.98 in Ω 1 , which is the farthest from the other habitats, and

Using genetic data to estimate diffusion rates in heterogeneous landscapes

of 0.82 in Ω 3 and Ω 5 which are close to each other (the other ratios are 0.87, 0.85 and 0.94
in Ω2 , Ω5 and Ω6 , respectively). Thus, the allele frequencies may remain stable after several
generations if the habitats are sufficiently far from each other or become rapidly inaccurate in
the opposite situation. A difficulty in estimating whether two habitats are far from each other
is that the population flows are not known a priori.
Our approach was based on an unbiased Brownian motion description of the individual trajectories, which leads to a Fokker-Planck reaction-diffusion equation. It can easily be extended
to include a bias in a direction (v1 , v2 )(t, x) modelling attractiveness or repulsiveness of some elements of the landscape, by adding a term −∂(u v1 )/∂x1 − ∂(u v2 )/∂x2 in the reaction-diffusion
equation (2.2). The method proposed here also readily applies to other linear dispersal terms,
such as the Fickian diffusion ∇ · (D(x)∇u) which is nevertheless more adapted to describe electric and thermic conductivity (Roques et al. 2008; Roques 2013). More general Lévy processes
than Brownian diffusion, corresponding to movements with large jumps, could have been considered as well; in such cases, the Laplace diffusion operator ∆ would be replaced by a fractional
Laplace operator (Valdinoci 2009). Integral kernel-based dispersal terms which can account for
long distance dispersal events could also be considered in place of the diffusion approach (Kot
et al. 1996).
The purpose of our study was to propose a rigourous method for the estimation of dispersal
parameters in stochastic differential equation-based models of individual movement. Here, the
method performance analysis assumed the same type of model for simulations and for inference.
In practice, the real dispersal process may differ from the assumptions of the model. Future
work should focus on the robustness of the method when the model assumptions are violated.
Another possible extension of our study is to include the estimation of the relative predispersal densities in the different habitats of origin and/or the areas of these habitats. It is not
straightforward however that these problems are identifiable.
As suggested by Remark 3, pre-dispersal subpopulations may not coincide with the habitats.
The location of the subpopulations may also not be known a priori. A challenging extension of
our approach would consist in clustering the subpopulations and inferring the allelic frequencies
(following a Structure-like approach, see Pritchard et al. 2000) together with the estimation of
D(x) in a full Bayesian approach, based on pre-dispersal genotype data in the habitats and
genotype data of trapped dispersers.
Appendix A: gradual release of the pre-dispersal populations
The equation (2.2) describes a simultaneous release of all the individuals at t = 0. To account
for a possible gradual release of the individuals, the equation (2.2) can be replaced by:
u
∂u
= ∆(D(x) u) − + u0 (x) f (t), t > 0, x ∈ Ω,
∂t
ν

(6.26)

where the term u0 (x) f (t) describes the release of the individuals; u0 (x) still corresponds to
the pre-dispersal density and the function f (t) is the release rate. It can be described by any
nonnegative function or distribution with integral 1 and with support in [0, T ], T corresponding
to the end of the release period. In this framework, the density of dispersers coming from habitat
Ω h satisfies the equation:
uh
∂uh
= ∆(D(x) uh ) −
+ uh0 (x) f (t), t > 0, x ∈ Ω,

where uh0 is still given by (2.7).

This formula corresponds to Nei’s GST for a single locus (Nei 1973), with numerator and
denominator averaged over the Λ loci. In our computations, all the subpopulations had the
same size; in other situations, the weight 1/H in the above formulas for HS and HT should be
replaced by the relative sizes of the subpopulations.
Appendix D: numerical computation of the cumulated population densities

We defined the cumulated population density at intermediate times t and position x by:
