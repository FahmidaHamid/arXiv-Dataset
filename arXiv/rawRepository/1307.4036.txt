Abstract
Infinite Leslie matrices, introduced by Demetrius forty years ago are
mathematical models of age-structured populations defined by a countable
infinite number of age classes. This article is concerned with determining
solutions of the discrete dynamical system in finite time. We address this
problem by appealing to the concept of kneading matrices and kneading
determinants. Our analysis is applicable not only to populations models,
but to models of self-reproducing machines and self-reproducing computer
programs. The dynamics of theses systems can also be described in terms
of infinite Leslie matrices.

Introduction

Almost seventy years ago Paul Holt Leslie introduced in [15] and [16] matrices
to study age-structured populations with given birth ratios and the population
divided by age classes. Leslie introduced a non-negative square p × p matrix L

to study the dynamics of an age-structured population. The population is
divided in age classes l = 0, 1, . . . p − 1. We consider the population vector

u = (u0 , u1 , . . . , up−1 ) where the components are the number of individuals in
each class. The bj are the transition probabilities from age class j − 1 to age
class j and the al are the mean birth rates of each individual in the class l.
Giving an initial population u0 , the dynamics is given by the linear difference
equation or matrix recurrence of the multiplicative process:
un = Lun−1 , with u0 given.

(1)

In finite matrix models when individuals in the older class up−1 become infertile
there is no need to go further than a p × p matrix. Variants of this scheme use
Usher [20] or Lefkovitch [14] matrices and occur when dealing with modeling,
simulation, experiments and observation data from actual populations.
Two references in the subject of structured population dynamics in finite
classes are the books [4, 5].
In 1972 Lloyd Demetrius introduced the idea of an infinite Leslie matrix
[7, 8], a natural generalization of the standard Leslie matrix described by a
countable infinite number of age-classes.
The extension of the classical Leslie models to infinite matrices was partly
motivated by an interest in understanding the existence and evolution of mortality plateaus. This concept refers to an age-specific survivorship distribution
characterized by a mortality abates with age at advanced ages, see for example,
[10, 22].
The asymptotic properties of the dynamical systems associated with the
infinite Leslie matrix was studied by considering the matrix as a positive linear
operator on a partially ordered Banach space [7, 8].
The infinite Leslie matrix is given by


a0 a1 a2 a3 · · ·
 b1 0 0 0 · · · 



L =  0 b2 0 0 · · ·  ,

with almost the same interpretation of the finite one. So, we use the same
notation. The entries of this matrix are
Lij = δi1 aj−1 + δij+1 bj , with i, j ∈ Z+ ,

(3)

the sets of indexes are denumerable. The same terminology as [18] could be used
calling the set of Leslie matrices (with finite or denumerable index sets) the set
of countable Leslie matrices. Since this paper deals essentially with denumerable matrices we adhere to the name infinite Leslie matrices when referring to
this type of matrices avoiding possible ambiguities resulting from different terminologies in the literature. Our results apply easily to the particular case of
finite matrices as we will see below.
By appealing to the spectral theory of positive operators, Demetrius
[9]
P
proved (see Theorems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the cited paper) that when an < ∞,
an for infinitely many n and bn → 0 as n → 0, the model has an essentially unique stationary age-distribution. (Essentially unique means in this
context unique up to a constant factor.) The asymptotic properties of the
age-distribution were analyzed in a later paper [8] and results analogous to
2

the asymptotic properties of finite Leslie matrices were obtained. Gosselin and
Lebreton, in a recent paper [12], relaxed the original Demetrius conditions to
derive analogous results concerning existence and asymptotic properties of a
stationary age distribution.
This paper is concerned with finite time properties of the discrete dynamical
system given by a equation similar to (1), where the process is now determined
by an infinite Leslie matrix, denoted L. The corresponding discrete dynamical
system is
un = Lun−1 , n ∈ N,
(4)
where N is the set of the non-negative integers, u is now a population vector
with a denumerable number of components and u0 is the initial condition.
In the literature [7, 8, 9, 12] it is assumed that the coefficients of L satisfy
the following two conditions:
1. al ≥ 0, sup al = A < ∞, with l ∈ N.
2. 0 < bj ≤ 1 with j ∈ Z+ .
These two conditions are consistent with the behaviour of natural agestructured population. The conditions are also consistent with mathematical
models of self-reproducing machines [21, 11], self-reproducing computer programs [3, 13, 23], or both, like in the survey [19]. In this paper we do not need
to assume these conditions, since our method depends only on the form of the
entries of the infinite Leslie matrix (3).
Equation (5) entails the following characterization of un
un = Ln u0 , for n ∈ N.

(5)

The main aim of this article is the complete characterization of un for n ∈ N.
Our analysis revolves around the notion of a matrix of formal power series
G (z) ∈ M∞ [[z]], where M∞ [[z]] is the set of denumerable matrices which
entries are formal power series. The entries [Gij (z)]i,j∈Z+ are functions of the
Leslie matrix and the formal indeterminate z.
We will exploit the theory of kneading determinants to establish the relation
X
G (z) =
Ln z n .
(6)
n≥0

This relation, which is the main result of the paper, provides a direct method
for computing Ln and thereby determining the solution of equation (5), in the
cases of finite or infinite Leslie matrices.
We call G (z) the generating matrix of the solutions of the difference equation.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe with illustrative
examples, the characterization of G (z). Section 3 establishes the main result,
as given by equation (6).

Statement of results

The Cartesian product of k repeated sets A is denoted by Ak . The Cartesian
product is denoted A∞ for a denumerable Cartesian product of repeated sets.

Mp = Cp×p and M∞ = C∞×∞ denote respectively the sets of p × p and
denumerable matrices with complex entries. C [z] and C [[z]] denote respectively
the sets of formal polynomials and formal power series in the indeterminate z
with complex coefficients. The sets of p × p and denumerable matrices having
formal power series as entries are denoted respectively by Mp [[z]] and M∞ [[z]].
The indeterminates x and z are respectively associated with real and complex
indeterminates when nothing else mentioned.

is defined operationally here and named the weighed kneading determinant of
the Leslie difference equation (4) with weights C1n = ln . The meaning of this
concept will be made precise in section 3 where a general and deeper definition
will be presented. We see in the sequence that the real root of ∆ (z) will be associated with the solution of Euler-Lotka equation. The Definition 10 of section
3 agrees naturally with ∆ (z), when computed for Leslie difference equations.
Definition 1 We define a matrix of formal power series G (z) ∈ M∞ [[z]], with
entries [Gij (z)]i,j∈Z+ given by

Gij (z) = Cji−1 z i−j +

The zero degree coefficient of ∆ (z) is 1. Consequently ∆ (z) is invertible
and the quotient in (9) above is well defined. This definition will be clarified in
Lemma 15.
The main theorem of this paper states that:
Theorem 2 Given a Leslie matrix L and the matrix G (z) ∈ M∞ [[z]] we have
X
G (z) =
Ln z n .
n≥0

This theorem holds even if the coefficients al and bj of L are general complex
numbers. In the population dynamics context of this work one considers real
non-negative coefficients.
To compute Ln we have to identify the coefficients of z n in G (z). Consequently, we call G (z) the generating matrix of the solutions of the Leslie
difference equation (4).
With this Theorem it is straightforward to compute the powers of L and to
understand the dynamics of the difference equation (4) for different instances of
Leslie matrices.

The generating function for Ln11 (the entries (1, 1) of the powers of L) is the
inverse of the weighed kneading determinant. This agrees with the direct computations of the matrix elements of Ln giving L011 = 1, L11 = a0 , L211 = a20 + a1 b1 ,
L311 = a30 + 2a0 a1 b1 + a2 b1 b2 , etc.
The equation

is the well known Euler-Lotka equation [12] for the leading eigenvalue, ρ > 0, for
an infinite Leslie matrix. If we identify z = ρ−1 in (10) we get ∆ (z) = 0. Consequently, the weighed kneading determinant and its roots are very important
in terms of asymptotic behavior of the solutions.
It is not our purpose to study a plethora of concrete examples that can be
readily obtained from the vast literature on this subject, see for example [4, 5].
We present two case studies only as examples of the computations involved.
The heart of the matter is that any Leslie difference equation, finite or infinite,
can be solved using kneading theory. In the finite case, the classic method
of diagonalization to find powers of matrices works perfectly. The kneading
determinant method is a new technique that as the advantage, in some cases,
to be computationally lighter.

A possible, very simplified, Leslie matrix for semelparous population with
three age classes [6] is

where a is the average fertility rate of each female, b1 is the survival rate of
the newborn generation and b2 is the survival rate of the juveniles. See a more
general discussion in [6] with an extensive related bibliography.
The weighed kneading determinant is
∆ (z) = 1 − ab1 b2 z 3 .

case ab1 b2 = 1 the population is stable with yearly oscillations of period 3.
The possibility of infinite Leslie matrices can occur when the population
does age very slowly or when we consider each member of the population as
a colony of insects like ants or termites. Theoretically these colonies can last
forever. Each colony can reproduce founding nearby colonies. The scale of the
reproduction is very slow but each colony has high survivorship rate. So, the
reproducing coefficients al are very small and the transition probabilities bj near
1. Despite these biological considerations, the relative size of the coefficients al
and bj is immaterial to the computation of the finite time solutions, as we can
see in the next example.
Example 5 Infinite Leslie model.
As an ideal experiment, which is a very simple generalization of the models
presented in [12], we consider populations were the reproduction varies geometrically with age and with a mortality rate constant. Geometric birth rates are
used since the formal power series are readily obtained exhibiting the internal

Proof of the main result

The proof of the main Theorem 2 is based on the concept of kneading determinant of a pair of linear endomorphisms which difference has finite rank. A
7

concept that roots its origin in one dimensional dynamics [17]. In the context
of linear algebra an analogous definition of kneading determinant using formal
power series can be obtained, see [1]. The process has similarities to the original definition for discrete dynamics of the interval, which justifies the use of the
terminology borrowed from dynamical systems.

please note that R= L − X is the matrix representation of an endomorphism in
C∞ with rank 1. This decomposition is classic and was noticed in [4, 6, 20], in
different frameworks.
Definition 7 Consider the standard basis of C∞ , the linear space of infinite
sequences over the field of complex numbers. The vectors of this basis are the
columns of the identity infinite matrix (Cl )l=1,2,... . On the other side Rα is the
α-th row of the infinite identity matrix, or the α vector of the standard basis of
the dual space of C∞ .
We denote by R the first row of L,

This is a direct consequence of the equality (11). Naturally when L is finite, X
is nilpotent.
Definition 8 The weighed kneading invariant (a particular case of the kneading
matrix of section 3 of [2]) is the formal power series in C [[z]] associated with
the Leslie difference equation (4) and given by
X
M (z) =
RXn C1 z n .

The weights appear as the products of the bj of the Leslie matrix and are not
present at the sections one and two of [2].

Replacing Xi1
in (12) we get the desired result.
We provide here the formal definition of weighed kneading determinant of
a Leslie difference equation defined operationally for Leslie difference equations
in equation (8).

Definition 10 Giving the weighed kneading invariant M (z) , the weighed kneading determinant ∆ (z) ∈ C [[z]] (see [2]) associated to M (z) is
∆ (z) = 1 − zM (z) .
The use of the concept determinant is inherited from the higher dimensional
case of infinite Fibonacci difference equations [2].
Remark 11 When we compute the weighed kneading determinant with the above
definition, the result agrees with (8) used previously

The first row of Mij (z) is done. Now, we have to compute the last row of
Mij (z). We note that there is only one entry different from 0 at the j column
of Xn and that element is at line i which is greater than j, so

Definition 14 The extended weighed kneading determinant of Mij (z) is
∆ij (z) = det (I − zMij (z)) ,
where I denotes the identity matrix. It is a formal power series in C [[z]] .
The next Lemma contains all the relevant details necessary to prove the
main Theorem 2.

we associate X with the matrix representation of the endomorphism ϕ and L
with the matrix representation of the endomorphism ψ. From Remark 6, ψ − ϕ
has finite rank and all the conclusions of [1] and [2] apply to ψ n with matrix
representation Ln , as desired.

The matrix G ∈ M∞ [[z]] with entries Gij (z), is the generating matrix of
the solutions of the Leslie difference equation (4).
We have all the ingredients to prove the Main Theorem 2. The result follows
directly from Lemma 15 and the definition of generating function, i.e.,

In our next article we use the main theorem of this work to study the asymptotic properties of models with infinite Leslie matrices.
Conclusion. We point out that with generating functions for Ln explicitly
given, one gets the solutions of this type of difference equations under very mild
restrictions, which is a clear benefit of working with formal power series.
