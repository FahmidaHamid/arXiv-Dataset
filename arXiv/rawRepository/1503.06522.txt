1. Introduction
It has been hypothesized that the evolution of
modern human cognition was catalyzed by the
development of jointly intentional modes of behaviour. 1,2,3 From an early age (1-2 years), human
infants outperform apes at tasks that involve collaborative activity. 4,5 Specifically, human infants
excel at joint action motivated by reasoning of the
form “we will do X” (shared intentions 6,7,8 ), as
opposed to reasoning of the form “I will do X [because he is doing X]” (individual intentions). The
mechanism behind the evolution of shared intentionality is unknown. Here we formally model the
evolution of jointly intentional action and show
under what conditions it is likely to have emerged
in humans. Modelling the interaction of huntergatherers as a coordination game 9 , we find that
when the benefits from adopting new technologies or norms are low but positive, the sharing of
intentions does not evolve, despite being a mutualistic behaviour 10 that directly benefits all participants. When the benefits from adopting new
technologies or norms are high, such as may be
the case during a period of rapid environmental change 11,12 , shared intentionality evolves and
rapidly becomes dominant in the population. Our

results shed new light on the evolution of collaborative behaviours.
2. Model
We summarize here the model. Details can be
found in Supplementary Information. 13 Following
Bowles, Choi & Bowles, 14,15 consider a metapopulation comprising m partially isolated subpopulations (called demes) of size n individuals. Each
individual either has the ability to share intentions (type SI) or does not (type N). Time is divided into generations, each of which comprises T
periods. Individuals live for a single generation.
Consider a given deme. At the start of a generation, the deme has achieved a level of technological/cultural sophistication τ . This will change as
time passes, as will the share of SI and N types in
the populations. That is, the model (summarized
in Figure 1) is one of gene-culture coevolution.
2.1. Within-deme interaction
The interaction structure within a deme is given
by an undirected graph on the set of individuals in
the deme. This is determined at the start of each
generation, the idea being that for each individual
there are a few individuals with whom he has a
high degree of interaction (relatives, friends, hunting partners). 16,17,18 At any one time, any given
individual plays one of two strategies, the ‘old’
technology, or a ‘new’ technology. For each neighbour who plays the same strategy as he does, he
gains a interaction-payoff of either 1 (old-old) or

ατ > 1 (new-new). That is, his payoffs in each
interaction are given by the coordination game
in Table 1. His payoff is then the average of his
interaction-payoffs from each neighbour. ατ represents the within-deme relative fitness benefits of
technology τ + 1 compared to technology τ .

ατ > 1. Entries are interaction-payoffs of an individual whose strategy is given by the row when
interacting with an individual whose strategy is
given by the column.

2.2. Strategy updating
Strategies are updated by single individuals but
also by pairs of individuals who can share their
intentions. A pair of players can only share intentions if both players in the pair are SI types
and they are neighbours on the interaction graph.
Each period within a generation, either one individual or one pair of individuals is randomly selected to update their strategy. An updating individual or pair of individuals plays a coalitional
better response, adjusting their strategies so that
by doing so they obtain payoffs at least as high
as their current payoffs, holding the strategies of
all the other individuals fixed. 19,20 However, when
any individual has the opportunity to update his
strategy, he will with some small probability make
a mistake and switch to a random strategy instead
of to his intended strategy. 21
Note that type (SI or N) does not dictate strategy choice, as it does in traditional evolutionary
game theory. 22,23 Neither does type affect any individual’s preferences over profiles of strategies as
it does in the literature on evolution of preferences. 24 What type does here is to alter, by enabling or disabling pairwise updating, the set of
strategy profiles that can be reached by any given
update. Note that the SI type only affects behaviour in the presence of other SI types and that
the behaviour manifested by pairs of SI types is
mutualistic, in that both participants gain from
it (in contrast to altruistic behaviour 10,25,26,27 ).

we reset the strategies of every individual in the
deme to ‘old’.
2.4. Deme extinction
At the end of each generation, with probability η, any given deme faces an invader. The invader is another deme chosen at random. If the
invader has a higher technology level than the invaded deme, then the invader replaces the invaded
deme. The invaded deme becomes extinct and is
replaced with a replica (types, current payoffs and
tech level) of the invader. This can represent the
possibility of violent conflict between demes, but
can equally be considered to model differing extinction and expansion rates of demes with access
to different technology.
2.5. Reproduction
Following the extinction phase, each deme reproduces according to a finite population replicator dynamic with mutation rate µ, determining
the shares of SI types in the next generation. For
simplicity, we assume that reproduction is asexual
and haploid. Note that as demes comprise finite
numbers of individuals, genetic drift will have an
effect in demes that contain both SI and N types.
3. Results

2.3. Technology adoption

Relative to demes with low numbers of SI types,
demes with high numbers of SI types are slow to
adopt new technology when ατ is low, but fast
to adopt new technology when ατ is high. The
former effect arises because, when ατ is low, SI
types playing ‘new’ can coordinate mutually profitable switches back to ‘old’ even when it would

Following strategy updating, payoffs for the
current period are realized for all individuals. Following this, if the proportion of the individuals in
a deme playing ‘new’ is 90% or higher, we say that
the new technology has been adopted, technology
τ + 1 is now the deme’s current technology, and

not be profitable for any individual acting alone to
make such a switch (Figure 2b). Conversely, when
ατ is high, SI types playing ‘old’ can coordinate
switches to ‘new’ that would not be profitable for

any individual acting alone (Figure 2c).
Hence, if ατ remains low (conversely, high)
over enough generations, then demes with high
numbers of SI types will fall behind (conversely,
pull ahead) of demes with low numbers of SI
types when it comes to technological advancement. When SI-poor demes lead in technology,
they will outperform SI-rich demes in conflict, and
SI will be selected against in the metapopulation.
When SI-rich demes lead in technology, the opposite will occur.
When ατ is low, mutation and genetic drift
eventually cause some demes to have low num-

bers of SI types. These demes gain a technological advantage over other demes, type N becomes
dominant and type SI becomes scarce (Figures
3a, 4-Phase I). Conversely, when ατ is high, mutation, genetic drift, and within deme selection
of SI cause some demes to have high numbers
of SI types. These demes gain a technological
advantage and type SI becomes dominant (Figures 3b, 4-Phase II). These results hold regardless of the initial proportions of SI and N types
in the population. Our results indicate that an
extended period of environmental change leading to elevated within-deme fitness benefits from
innovation would have sufficed for SI to become
widespread.

‘conservative’ and ‘reforming’ effects of Figure 2
are observed. 19,28
The collaborative sharing of intentions is mutualistic, not altruistic: both parties gain from the
pairwise adjustment of strategies. Moreover, we
look at coordination games, not prisoner’s dilemmas. There are no gains to be made from cheating. Despite this, we have seen that the emergence
of SI is far from assured. Thus our model gives a
mechanism by which inter-species (e.g. chimp vs.
human) differences in benefits from new technologies could lead to diversity in the ability to share
intentions. Such differences in the gains from
technological advance could arise from physical
differences between species, or from differences in
environmental variability. 11,12

4. Discussion
References

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this
is the first paper to formally model the evolution of collaborative ability, although the work
of Bacharach 29 makes tentative steps in this direction. Collaboration directly alters how strategies are chosen, not which strategies are chosen,
and although the former affects the latter, how
it does so depends on circumstances. The insight
we derive, by explicitly modelling techno-cultural
advance, is to link technology adoption to the evolution of collaboration.
As might be expected, large gains from technological adaptation facilitate the evolution of SI.
However, when benefits from new technology are
low, collaboration works against a community by
slowing its technological advance, even when all
members of the community have perfectly aligned
interests. Previous literature has discussed how
interaction structure can have important implications for cumulative culture. 30,18,31 Our model
provides a novel mechanism for this: the social
structure within demes combines with the presence or absence of shared intentions and the exogenous technological opportunities of the epoch
(α) to give varying rates of techno-cultural accumulation. Furthermore, although this study considers the plausible case of scale free social networks 17 , there exist a large range of social structures, both regular and random, for which the
