In biology and ecology, individuals or communities of individuals living in unpredictable environments often alternate between different evolutionary strategies to spread and reduce risks. Such
behavior is commonly referred to as “bet-hedging.” Long-term survival probabilities and population
sizes can be much enhanced by exploiting such hybrid strategies. Here, we study the simplest possible birth-death stochastic model in which individuals can choose among a poor but safe strategy,
a better but risky alternative, or a combination of both. We show analytically and computationally
that the benefits derived from bet-hedging strategies are much stronger for higher environmental
variabilities (large external noise) and/or for small spatial dimensions (large intrinsic noise). These
circumstances are typically encountered by living systems, thus providing us with a possible justification for the ubiquitousness of bet-hedging in nature.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In natural environments, individuals have to choose
among a variety of evolutionary strategies, characterized
by different payoffs and risks, which, in their turn, may
change with time. Particularly relevant is the case in
which a choice is to be made between a relatively safe
strategy, with a low but stable payoff, and a potentially
very productive, but risky, variable strategy. Microorganisms able to metabolize two resources [1–4], one of
them consistently available at a fixed though low level,
and the second, more abundant on average but fluctuating in time, constitute an example of this. In the absence of specific knowledge about environmental conditions, individuals need to make a blind decision about
whether to specialize in consuming only one resource or,
instead, develop a hybrid “bet-hedging” strategy by alternating both options. Similar forms of bet-hedging can
also emerge in cases where limited information from sensory systems is available [5, 6]. Finally, bet-hedging can
be exploited at a community level –rather than on an
individual basis– by developing, for example, phenotypic
variability among individuals in a population[4, 6].
The concept of bet-hedging was first formalized in the
context of information theory [7] and portfolio management [8]. Later, it was conjectured that living organisms
may employ bet-hedging strategies to decrease their risk
in unpredictable environments [5, 9–12]. This idea has
been empirically confirmed in bacterial and viral communities [2–4, 13–16], in insects [17], in seed-dispersal
strategies developed by plants [18–20], and in a wealth of
other examples in population ecology, microbiology, and
evolutionary biology [9].

Given their ubiquity, bet-hedging strategies have attracted a lot of interest from the perspective of evolutionary game theory [21, 22]. An interesting and nontrivial
result in this context is the so-called Parrondo’s paradox
[23, 24], in which an alternation of two “losing” strategies can lead to a “winning” one. However, most of the
existing theoretical studies of this effect, including applications in population dynamics [9], rely on mean-field
analyses describing well-mixed communities.
In this paper, we aim to extend previous approaches
and to show that the competitive advantage of bethedging hybrid strategies is much stronger in the presence of highly variable environments and/or in lowdimensional systems, where the effect of fluctuations, i.e.,
demographic noise, is maximal and mean-field predictions do not hold.
For this, we study a minimal mathematical model of
bet-hedging. It is based on the physics of the contact
process (CP) [25–27], but with the twist that individuals can randomly choose between two strategies: one
characterized by a fixed reproduction rate and the other
by fluctuating environmental-dependent rates. By combining analytical and computational results, we conclude
that bet-hedging benefits are greatly enhanced in noisy
low-dimensional environments such as the ones that living systems typically inhabit and end by discussing the
relevance of our results for more realistic models of biological populations.

THE MODEL: CONTACT PROCESS WITH
HYBRID DYNAMICS

Our starting point is the simplest possible birth-death
stochastic model on a lattice, i.e., the CP [25–27] (see
Fig. 1, left). Individuals occupy a (square) lattice or
network, with at most one individual per site. At every

2
risk parameter α; variations in which α is individualdependent are left for a future work. Key observables
are the stationary density of individuals, ρ, the averaged
(exponential) growth rate, G, and the mean extinction
time of small populations, τ (see below).

III.

FIG. 1: Left: Sketch of the standard contact process dynamics: each occupied node (individual) in the lattice either (i)
produces an offspring with probability p at a random neighboring site (provided it is empty) or (ii) is removed from the
lattice with complementary probability 1 − p. Right: Contact
process with hybrid dynamics: at each time step, every individual chooses between the conservative (with probability
1 − α) and the risky (with probability α) spreading strategy.
The conservative dynamics is characterized by a constant, relatively low spreading probability p0 , while the risky one depends on a stochastic variable p(t), common to all particles
in the system.

discrete time step, each individual can either produce
(with probability p) an offspring at a randomly chosen
neighboring site –provided it is empty– or die and be
removed from the system (with probability 1 − p). This
simple dynamics can –depending on the value of p– either
generate an active phase characterized by a nonvanishing
density of individuals or, alternatively, lead ineluctably
to the absorbing state in which the population becomes
extinct. A critical point, pc , separates these two distinct
phases [25–27].
We consider a variant of the CP dynamics in which individuals can choose between two strategies (see Fig. 1,
right): a “conservative” one, corresponding to exploitation of a constantly available resource, and a “risky” one,
exploiting a variable/unpredictable resource. The conservative strategy corresponds to a CP in which p is kept
constant at a relatively low value, p0 . On the other hand,
in the risky strategy, demographic probabilities depend
upon variable external conditions, i.e., p = p(t), where
p(t) is a random noise, common to all individuals in the
community. We focus on the simple case in which p(t)
is freshly drawn at every (Monte Carlo) time step, and
discuss later the case in which the environment is temporally correlated.
Individuals can hedge their bets by randomly picking
either of the two competing strategies at each time step.
This choice is controlled by the “risk parameter” α: at
each time step, each individual independently adopts the
risky strategy with probability α or the conservative one
with probability 1 − α . In the language of game theory,
α = 0 and α = 1 correspond to “pure strategies” and the
range 0 < α < 1 corresponds to a set of hybrid strategies.
In what follows, we assume that all individuals in the
community are characterized by the same value of the

THEORETICAL INSIGHTS

In game theory, it is known that a hybrid plan consisting in the alternation of two distinct pure strategies can
outperform both of them (see, e.g., [7, 9, 12, 23]), constituting an example of Parrondo’s paradox. This effect
plays an important role for our aims in what follows. In
this section, we discuss a simplified one-variable equation
aimed at capturing the gist of our model.
In particular, the simplifying assumptions we make
here are as follows: (i) We consider a mean-field limit in
which spatial fluctuations are neglected. (ii) We neglect
nonlinear saturation terms; this is a valid approximation
only for low densities. (iii) We consider a continuous time
limit, as usually done to analyze the physics of the CP
and other particle systems [25, 27, 28] (a discrete-time
calculation is presented in Appendix A to prove the robustness of our conclusions against this assumption). In
the continuous-time limit, we consider the growth rate
p(t) = p̄ + σξ(t), where p̄ and σ are constants –the
mean and amplitude of the stochastic risky strategy p(t),
respectively–, and where ξ(t) is a Gaussian noise with
hξ(t)i = 0 and hξ(t)ξ(t0 )i = δ(t − t0 ) [observe that even if
we maintain the same notation as above, p(t) and p0 need
to be interpreted as transition rates in the continuoustime approach]. The choice of a Gaussian probability
distribution function for p(t) enables us to obtain analytical calculations, but it has some “technical” drawbacks.
In particular, being an unbounded distribution, p(t) can
take negative values; thus, in order to avoid interpretation problems, we need to restrict ourselves to the case
0  p̄ − σ and p̄ + σ  1, where these effects should be
negligible. In any case, even if specific details may depend on this choice, the general results and conclusions
presented in what follows are robust against changes in
this probability. This is explicitly illustrated in Appendix
A for the case of uniform bounded distributions.
Under these assumptions, the density of individuals
ρ(t) obeys the following rate equation:
ρ̇(t)

= α [p(t)ρ (1 − ρ) − (1 − p(t)) ρ]
+(1 − α) [p0 ρ (1 − ρ) − (1 − p0 ) ρ] .

where the sign of the exponential growth rate,

(6)

determines whether the population tends to shrink or
[owing to the absence of the nonlinear saturation terms
in this approximation, Eq. (4)] to grow unboundedly.
These two regimes are separated by a critical point at
which G(α) = 0.
Keeping fixed all parameters but α, we define the optimal strategy α∗ ∈ [0, 1] as the one maximizing G(α).
This can be either a pure or a hybrid strategy, depending on parameter values. In particular, α∗ = 0 for
p̄ < p0 , α∗ = 1 for p̄ > p0 + 2σ 2 , and α∗ = (p̄ − p0 )/2σ 2
for intermediate values of p̄. Observe that the critical point is obtained for pc (α) = 12 + σ 2 α2 , i.e., the
α-dependent critical point interpolates quadratically between the critical points of the pure strategies, pc (0) = 12
and pc (1) = 21 + σ 2 . On the other hand, the average
spreading rate pav (α) [Eq. (2)] is a linear-in-α interpolation between the two limiting pure values.
Figure 2 (top) shows the stationary density [obtained
via numerical integration of Eq. (3)] for the conservative,
the risky, and an intermediate hybrid strategy. The critical points at which the nontrivial steady states emerge coincide with the analytical predictions we have just made.
As explained in the caption to Fig. 2, the different
functional dependences for pav (α) and pc (α) –linear and
quadratic in α, respectively– enable the two curves to intersect each other, and thus, for intermediate values of α
it is possible to have pav (α) > pc (α), i.e., a supercritical
dynamics, even in the case (illustrated in Fig. 2) in which
both pure strategies, p0 and p̄, are subcritical. Similarly,
when the two pure strategies are active/supercritical, the
same argument shows that a much higher stationary density can be achieved by hybrid strategies.
This graphical representation –which we believe is new
in the literature– allows us to understand in a relatively simple and compact way the essence of Parrondo’s
paradox. In what follows, we consider different types
of pure strategies, either absorbing/subcritical or active/supercritical, and quantify the gain induced by bethedging in different settings, including fully connected
(FC) networks (where the above mean-field approach
should hold) and spatially explicit low-dimensional systems (where mean-field conclusions might break down).

Critical points for the pure strategies can be obtained analytically: pc (α = 0) = 1/2 and pc (α = 1) = 1/2 + σ 2 . Critical
points for hybrid strategies lie between these two values. The
lestmost (blue) and rightmost (red) arrows indicate a specific
choice made for the two pure strategies, α = 0 and α = 1,
respectively (p0 = 0.47 and p̄ = 0.72, with σ 2 = 0.25). Note
that both of them are equally subcritical. The middle (purple)
arrow marks the average spreading rate for a specific hybrid
strategy (with α = α∗ ). Bottom: Two lines are plotted as a
function of α: the effective value of the spreading rate pav (α)
and the location of the critical point, pc (α). The first one
interpolates linearly between our two pure-strategy choices
(arrows) for p0 and p̄ in the pure cases (as indicated by the
blue-red color gradient). On the other hand, the second line is
a quadratic interpolation between the two pure-strategy critical points (as indicated by the green-orange gradient). As
the two lines intersect each other, there exists a range of values of α for which pav (α) > pc (α) (supercritical) and others
for which pav (α) < pc (α) (subcritical). In particular, for intermediate values of α, such as the marked α∗ = 0.5, the
stochastic alternation of two subcritical strategies results in a
supercritical one.

IV.

COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS

The calculation in the previous section provides valuable insight into why hybrid strategies can be important,
but it has some important limitations. It is a mean-field
calculation, thus neglecting spatial structure. Moreover,
Eq. (4) includes only linear terms, and thus it can only
describe exponential growth starting from low density
rather than the steady-state behavior of the nonlinear

4
dynamics. To go beyond these limitations, here we perform direct Monte Carlo simulations of the discrete model
defined in Sec. II in large FC networks, and later we compare them with similar simulations in one-dimensional
(1D) two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
lattices.
We implemented the CP dynamics using either synchronous/parallel or asynchronous/sequential types of
updatings. Here, we mostly focus on the synchronous
case. In Appendix B, we show that asynchronous updating leads to qualitatively similar results, even if quantitative differences emerge.
Simulations are initialized with a fully occupied configuration; then the dynamics proceeds as follows: (i)
At every step, a new value of p(t) is drawn from some
probability distribution in [0, 1]; in most of this paper
we use a truncated Gaussian N (p̄, σ 2 ) (p̄ and σ 2 are the
mean and variance, respectively, of the nontruncated distribution) in which we fix possible values p(t) < 0 to
p(t) = 0 and values p(t) > 1 to 1. This particular choice
may seem arbitrary, but we have verified that all the
forthcoming conclusions are robust and remain valid for,
e.g., uniform distributions. (ii) The network/lattice is
updated synchronously; with probabilities α and 1 − α,
each individual selects the risky or the conservative strategy respectively. (iii) Each individual either dies or reproduces with the corresponding probabilities; all dying
individuals are removed from the system and afterward
offspring are placed at random neighbors of their corresponding parents, keeping the constraint of a maximum
occupancy of one individual per site (i.e., offspring trying
to occupy an already full site are simply removed). Finally, (iv) time is incremented in one unit and the process
is iterated until a stationary state has been reached and
steady-state measurements (of, e.g., ρ) are performed.
We begin by verifying the possibility of obtaining an
active phase by combining two strategies, each of them
leading to an absorbing/subcritical phase. To this aim,
we fix the parameters (p0 , p̄, σ) to poise the respective
pure strategies (α = 0 or α = 1) in the absorbing phase
and study the behavior of hybrid strategies at intermediate values of α. To determine whether or not a strategy
leads to an active phase, we measure the mean extinction
time, τ , as a function of the system size N . Observe that,
owing to fluctuations, any finite system is condemned to
end up in the absorbing state. However, its mean lifetime
increases exponentially with N , τ ∼ exp(N ) in the active phase [28], making the system stable in the large-N
limit. Note that, in the presence of fluctuating parameters, τ (N ) can also scale as a power-law in the active
phase [29]. On the other hand, a slow logarithmic increase, τ ∼ log(N ), is expected in the absorbing phase
[28, 29]. As shown in Fig. 3 for different values of α
and for different spatial dimensions, τ grows logarithmically with N for the two pure strategies (α = 0, 1), as
corresponds to both of them being absorbing, while it increases exponentially for an intermediate range of hybrid
strategies, which depends upon the systems dimensional-

FIG. 3: Mean extinction times as a function of system size
N for different strategies α and spatial dimensions. For our
parameter choice, the two pure strategies, α = 0, 1, have
a logarithmic dependency (characteristic of subcritical behavior [29]), while a range of hybrid strategies exhibits an
exponential or power-law increase typical of active phases
[29]. Parameter values (p0 , p̄, σ): 1D, (0.71, 0.80, 0.20); 2D,
(0.58, 0.71, 0.29); 3D, (0.54, 0.69, 0.30), and fully connected
(FC), (0.499, 0.67, 0.33). Most error-bars are smaller than the
symbol sizes.

ity. We therefore conclude that in the CP the stochastic
alternation of two absorbing dynamics can lead to an
active one, in agreement with the linear-approximation
above.
Some remarks are in order. The advantageous consequences of bet-hedging are not limited to the mean-field
case, which can be simply interpreted in terms of Eq.
(3), but are important also in low-dimensional systems
where internal fluctuations play a key role. Observe also
that, as the phase boundaries depend on dimensionality, different parameters are chosen for different panels in
Fig. 3. We discuss later a way to compare more clearly
the strength of the effect as the system dimensionality is
changed. Finally, we have made no attempt here to accurately determine the values of α delimiting the active
phase for each dimension, but have just confirmed the
stabilizing effect of hybrid strategies.
The goal now is to quantitatively analyze how the benefits of bet-hedging depend on the level of stochasticity, both external (environmental) and intrinsic (demographic).

A.

Environmental/external noise

First, we study the dependence on environmental variability σ 2 . To ease comparison, for each value of σ 2 ,
we fix the two pure strategies to have the same steady-

predicting a linear increase in the optimal G with σ .
As a final remark, observe that, although the two pure
strategies have been set to be equivalent (in the sense
that both lead to the same stationary density), the optimal strategy α∗ in Fig. 4(a) (maximizing hρi) tends to
be slightly larger than that provided by the approximate
analytical prediction α∗ = 1/2 (maximizing G). We have
checked that this “favoring” of the risky strategy strongly
depends on the details of the implementation, as we have
not observed it with asynchronous updating in the dynamics (see Appendix B). So far, we have not attempted
to determine the optimal strategy α∗ for each case, but
just to confirm the gain enhancement of bet-hedging in
the presence of larger fluctuations.

stationary density

state density, hρ(α = 0)i = hρ(α = 1)i = 0.3, by an
appropriate choice of the only remaining free parameters, p0 and p̄, respectively. Observe that, at variance
with the previous section, here the pure strategies are
taken to be “equally” active (same steady-state density),
but we could have also taken them to be equally absorbing (same extinction time). The reason for this choice is
that it allows for a much faster and easier computational
implementation. We then analyze how the steady-state
averaged density ρ depends on α for different values of
σ 2 . Figure 4(a) clearly illustrates that, in the case of FC
(mean-field) lattices, more variable environments allow
bet-hedging strategies to achieve much higher stationary densities. The same trend holds for low-dimensional
lattices (not shown): the larger the external noise, the
more benefits a community can derive from conveniently
exploiting bet-hedging.
This observation is consistent with the linear analysis embodied in Eq.(4). Using the definition of G(α)
and keeping the environmental variance σ 2 as a control
parameter, p0 and p̄ can be fixed by imposing identical
growth rates for the pure strategies, G(0) = G(1) ≡ G0,1 .
Under this constraint, the maximum possible growing

stationary density for different bet-hedging strategies. Curves
are results of Monte Carlo simulations of the fully-connected
(FC) CP with bet-hedging. As σ 2 is increased, the optimal
strategy induces higher stationary densities, even if the pure
strategies α = 0, 1 lead to the same density, hρ(α = 0, 1)i =
0.3. Parameter values are N = 104 , p0 = 0.567. (p̄, σ 2 ) are
(0.628, 0.05), (0.699, 0.10), (0.765, 0.15) and (0.825, 0.20) in
the different curves. (b) Effect of dimensionality at fixed σ 2 .
The net benefit of bet-hedging is much enhanced at lowerdimensions. Parameters: hρ(α = 0, 1)i = 0.3, σ 2 = 0.05,
N = 104 for 1D, 2D and FC, N = 10648 for 3D, and (p0 , p̄)
are 1D:(0.722, 0.847), 2D:(0.618, 0.704), 3D:(0.594, 0.665) and
FC:(0.567, 0.628). Error-bars are smaller than symbol sizes in
all cases.

Dimensionality and demographic/intrinsic noise

A main feature of low-dimensional models in statistical mechanics is that intrinsic fluctuations (or demographic stochasticity, in the language of population dynamics) play a more dramatic role than they do in high
dimensions [30], where they can be safely neglected in
mean-field-like approximations. We assume –and then
explicitly verify– that smaller spatial dimensions effectively correspond to larger levels of demographic noise.
We now explore the effect of dimensionality on bethedging; the spatial dimension of the systems is varied
while keeping a fixed external noise variance σ 2 . As
above, to ease comparison, we choose pure strategies for
each dimension so that hρ(0)i = hρ(1)i = 0.3 (i.e., both

pure strategies are equally active) and measure computationally hρi as a function of α for hybrid strategies in
each dimension.
Figure 4(b) clearly illustrates that the benefits of bethedging are much enhanced as the system dimensionality is decreased, allowing for much higher densities. In
particular, 1D systems can accommodate twice as much
density as FC (infinite-dimensional) lattices.
A simple mathematical argument allows us to qualitatively –even if not quantitatively– understand this finding. Demographic noise is the key ingredient, missing in
the mean-field limit. Therefore, we generalize Eq. (4) to
include a demographic-noise term of tunable amplitude γ

as a function of parameter values.
The effective
dimension-dependent value of γ can now be inferred from
the condition that –fixing the remaining parameters (i.e.,
p0 , p̄, and σ 2 ) as in each of the spatially explicit simulations [see caption of Fig. 4b]– the quasi-stationary density in Eq. (11) satisfies hρ(α = 0)i = hρ(α = 1)i = 0.3.
The resulting values of γ are γ = 0.09, 0.15, and 0.28,
for dimensions 3, 2, and 1, respectively (each value is
the average of two very close results obtained for the
two pure strategies), confirming that, as expected, γ
–effectively representing the amplitude of demographic
noise– increases upon lowering the spatial dimension.
Having determined, for each dimension, the level of
demographic fluctuations γ, we now use Eqs. (10) and
(11) to compute the maximum density as a function of α.
Results are shown in Fig. 5, which reveals that the benefits of bet-hedging are enhanced for larger demographic
noises and, thus, for lower spatial dimensions.

square-root factor multiplying the noise amplitude of demographic fluctuations is a direct consequence of the central limit theorem, which, in particular, imposes that

Equivalently to Eq. (8), we can write down the FokkerPlanck equation for the probability distribution P (ρ, t)

the existence of an absorbing state at ρ = 0), we include
a small and constant drift ε, which is a constant added

point was computed using the value of γ inferred from Eq.
(10), for a different spatial dimension (1, 2, and 3), and
γ = 0 for the mean-field case. Parameters p0 , p̄, and σ
are the same as in Fig. 4(b) and γ is tuned to produce
hρ(α = 0)i = hρ(α = 1)i = 0.3. The inferred γ changes
slightly for α = 0 and α = 1 as reflected in the error bars
(shaded region). These results confirm that the effective noise
amplitude γ increases as the system dimensionality decreases
and that the benefits of bet-hedging are enhanced by demographic noise. However, the curve becomes nonmonotonous
for larger values of γ. (b) Density distributions in the optimal
strategy α∗ for different demographic noise amplitudes γ: We
represent the quasistationary solution of Eq. (10) (ε = 10−3 ).
The calculus fails for higher values of γ, as the probability of
decay into the absorbing state (emerging peak at ρ = 0) becomes non-negligible. The functional dependence of hρimax (γ)
does not change qualitatively for other choices of this parameter, such as ε = 10−2 , 10−3 or 10−4 .

We remark that this phenomenological single-variable
theory only provides a qualitative explanation of the phenomenon and does not quantitatively reproduce the actual stationary densities in Fig. 4(b). Observe also that
for very high noise amplitudes the curve in Fig. 5 veers
down, while this effect is not seen when reducing the system dimensionality. A more rigorous analytical approach

7
to this problem –including the explicitly spatial dependence in Eq. (8)– is a challenging task, beyond the scope
of the present work.

Time-correlated environments

In the model we have discussed, the timescale of environmental changes is the same as the generation times
cale. However, real biological populations have to cope
with environmental conditions varying on time scales
possibly longer [33] than the individual generation time.
To address this important generalization, we checked how
our main results change upon varying the temporal correlation of the state of the environment. In particular, we
simply described p(t) as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
(see, e.g., [28]) of average p̄ and variance σ 2 and study
the effect of varying its correlation time.
Detailed results of this study are summarized in Appendix C. Our main conclusion, i.e., that the benefits of
bet-hedging strategies are enhanced in lower-dimensional
systems, remains unaltered. In addition, considering an
environment correlated over a few generations enhances
the advantage of bet-hedging in all dimensions, although
this effect is significantly stronger in low dimensions. Finally, the optimal strategy becomes more conservative
for environments characterized by a very long correlation time. These results can be intuitively understood
by thinking that, if the environment is persistently unfavorable for a long time, the extinction risk is very high,
and bet-hedging strategies become more crucial for survival. A much more detailed analytical characterization
of bet-hedging dynamics under correlated environments
is left for a future study.

V.

CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing, our main finding is that the relative
benefit of developing bet-hedging strategies is strongly
enhanced in highly fluctuating low-dimensional systems,
where both internal and external sources of variability
greatly foster dynamical fluctuations, leading to a strong
departure from mean-field behavior. Given that these
conditions are often met by biological populations –as
for instance, in bacterial colonies competing at the front
of a range expansion in noisy environments [34–36]– our
results support the importance of bet-hedging in nature. This being said, of course, more realistic models
–including some realistic ingredients such as, for example, the possibility of “dormant” states and not just birth
and death processes– would be required to approach viral or bacterial communities and their bet-hedging more
closely.
The kind of trade-off considered in this paper, between
a stable and a fluctuating resource, is possibly the simplest example of bet-hedging, both biologically relevant
and natural to understand using tools of nonequilibrium

statistical physics. However, we conjecture that the increased strength of bet-hedging in low dimensionality is
a general phenomenon, present in other recently studied
examples of trade-offs, for example, between reproduction and motility [37, 38] and in pairwise games [39].
Our preliminary results presented in Appendix C show
that the effect described in this paper is still present in
correlated environments. However, for very long correlation times, bet-hedging strategies are disfavored compared to short-correlated environments, but they always
provide an advantage with respect to pure strategies. In
view of these preliminary results, it will be of interest to
investigate from a general perspective and in more depth
the influence of environmental-noise temporal autocorrelations on bet-hedging, as well as the difference between
exploiting bet-hedging individually and exploiting it at a
community level. We believe that this work will provide
a physical framework to answer these and similar challenging questions which might be of interest in biology
and ecology.

Appendix A: Uniformly distributed environment

In this Appendix we study the case in which the
spreading probability for the risky strategy, p(t), is
bounded and uniformly distributed in the range [p̄−δ, p̄+
δ], where the parameter δ encapsulates the level of environmental variability. In particular, to avoid negative
values, we take δ < p̄ and δ < 1− p̄. This type of distribution allows for analytical treatment using a discrete-time
approach, which is common in the study of game theory
[7]. To proceed, we take the linearized rate equation derived in the text, Eq. (4), and write it in a discrete-time
form (using one-unit time steps) and replace p(t) with its
explicit form for the uniform distribution,
ρ(t) = 2pav (α)ρ(t − 1) + 2αδρ(t − 1)u(t − 1),

(A1)

where u(t) is a uniformly distributed variable in the range
[−1, 1], for any integer t ≥ 0.
Assuming an initial density ρ(0) and discretizing the
range of values of u, u = (u1 , ..., uU ), the previous equation becomes

risk parameter α as given by Eq. (A4) for uniformly distributed environments: p(t) = p̄ + δu(t), where p̄ and δ are
constants and u(t) is a uniform noise distributed in [−1, 1].
Different curves correspond to different values of the parameter δ; in all cases the corresponding pure strategies have
been tuned to give G(α = 0) = G(α = 1) = −0.005 in
the absorbing/subcritical phase. The optimal strategy is always a hybrid one, very close to α∗ = 0.5. In particular,
for δ & 0.15, G(α∗ ) > 0, allowing for active/supercritical
dynamics. Furthermore, the maximum growth rate for this
strategy increases with the amplitude of the environmental
noise. Parameter values: p0 = 0.498 fixed in all cases, and
(p̄, δ) = (0.501, 0.1), (0.511, 0.2), (0.528, 0.3) and (0.553, 0.4).
Note that δ < p̄ and δ < 1 − p̄ in all cases.

for any α ∈ (0, 1], and G(0) = log (2p0 ) for α = 0.
Figure 6 shows the solution G as a function of α [Eq.
(A4)] for different choices of the environmental variability δ. In this example, we have tuned the parameters p0
and p̄ to be equally subcritical, i.e., G(0) = G(1) < 0,
but similar curves can be obtained if G(0) = G(1) > 0.
We see that (i) the optimal strategy, in the sense of having a maximal G, always lies at intermediate values of α;
(ii) the growth rate for such optimal strategy increases
with the amplitude of fluctuations δ; and (iii) for sufficiently large values of δ, a combination of two subcritical
strategies gives rise to a supercritical one, as G(α∗ ) > 0
for δ & 0.15. Moreover, we have tested these results in
Monte Carlo simulations, as well as with different lattice
dimensions, obtaining plots similar to Fig. 4 and Fig. 7.
Summarizing, in the case in which p(t) is uniformly distributed, the same conclusion obtained for Gaussian distributions holds: the benefits of bet-hedging are stronger

In this Appendix, we verify the robustness of our results when an asynchronous-updating version of the CP
[25] is implemented. At each time step, one of the existing Nact (t) active particles is randomly selected; with
probability α, the particle chooses the risky strategy or,
with complementary probability 1 − α, the conservative
one. As above, in the first case, it reproduces with probability p(t) or dies with probability 1 − p(t), where p(t)
changes with the environment, while for the conservative
strategy it reproduces with probability p0 or dies with
probability 1 − p0 . Time is incremented in 1/Nact (t). After all particles in the network have been updated once
on average (i.e. after time increases in one unit) another value of p(t) is drawn from a Gaussian distribution
N (p̄, σ 2 ).
With this implementation, as in Fig. 4, we have again
computed the curve hρ(α)i provided that hρ(0, 1)i = 0.3,
for different values of the external noise variance σ 2 (in
the FC network) and for different network dimensions
(fixing σ 2 ). As illustrated in Fig. 7, the relative position
of all curves is the same as for the case of synchronous
updating: the benefits of bet-hedging are enhanced as the
noise amplitude is increased. However, quantitatively,
the enhancement is smaller than in the synchronous case,
discussed in the text.
As a final remark, observe that one could have naively
expected that fluctuations derived from the sequential
updating might contribute to an enhancement of the density for such hybrid strategies. This difference stems
from the fact that in the sequential implementation of
the model, not all individuals are necessarily updated at
every single Monte Carlo step; thus the stochasticity introduced by this type of updating may save populations
from extinctions in very unfavorable environments. This
implies that the community does not rely as strongly on
bet-hedging to perdure.

Appendix C: Effect of temporal correlations

A simple way to introduce temporal autocorrelations
in the environment is to take p(t) to follow a OrnsteinUhlenbeck process [28], i.e., a Brownian particle moving
in a parabolic potential. Mathematically, this process
obeys [28]
√
ṗ = θ(p̄ − p) + 2θσξ(t),
(C1)
where p̄ and σ represent, as before, the mean and variance
of p(t), respectively. With this choice, p(t) is Gaussian
distributed, N (p̄, σ 2 ). The new parameter θ controls the
temporal autocorrelations, as h(p(t) − p̄) (p(t0 ) − p̄)i =

9

a)

where N (0, 1) is a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian random number.
Fixing the environmental variance σ 2 , we numerically
study the effect of temporal correlations on bet-hedging
for different values of θ in every dimension. Following the
same strategy as above, we tune the parameters p0 and p̄
for each temporal autocorrelation θ to fix the stationary
density at hρ(α = 0, 1)i, and measure hρ(α)i. Results
are summarized in Fig. 8. Some remarks are in order.
(i) The optimal strategy is always a hybrid strategy between α = 0 and α = 1. Additionally, curves coincide
with those in Fig. 4(b) when θ is high (θ ∼ 10), as
the external environment exhibits only short correlations.
(ii) When θ decreases moderately, the stationary density
at the optimal strategy becomes larger compared to the
noncorrelated case. In other words, bet-hedging strategies are more efficient for temporally autocorrelated environments. This effect is stronger for lower dimensions,
whereas it barely applies to higher dimensional lattices.
(iii) When the autocorrelation is very large (θ < 0.1), the
benefits of hybrid strategies are reduced compared to the
noncorrelated case, but they always remain convenient
with respect to pure strategies. However, we are not
interested in this scenario, in which external conditions
remain almost unchanged during extremely long periods
of time, and thus it behaves, effectively as a constant-p

Carlo simulations of the CP with bet-hedging. Qualitatively, the same conclusions are obtained as with the parallel updating. However, the benefits of bet-hedging strategies become lower in this second implementation, especially
for the FC network. Parameter values are as follows. (a)

case. The inflection point in θ at which this effect appears
varies for different dimensions. (iv) Finally, the optimal
strategy becomes more conservative when temporal correlations are added to the environment, with a bias to
α∗ → 0 when θ decreases. It would be nice to have a
more detailed analytical understanding of all this phenomenology, but we leave this challenging task for future
work.
