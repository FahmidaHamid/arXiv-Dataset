Electrical signaling via voltage-gated ion channels depends upon the function of a voltage sensor
(VS), identified with the S1–S4 domain in voltage-gated K+ channels. Here we investigate some
energetic aspects of the sliding-helix model of the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear
dielectrics and whole-body motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions
are solved using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical consequences of the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain insight into the sliding-helix mechanism and
to predict experimentally measured ensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage. Those consequences and ensemble properties are investigated for two alternate S4
configurations, α- and 310 -helical. Both forms of VS are found to have an inherent electrostatic
stability. Maximal charge displacement is limited by geometry, specifically the range of movement
where S4 charges and countercharges overlap in the region of weak dielectric. Charge displacement
responds more steeply to voltage in the α-helical than in the 310 -helical sensor. This difference is
due to differences on the order of 0.1 eV in the landscapes of electrostatic energy. As a step toward
integrating these VS models into a full-channel model, we include a hypothetical external load in
the Hamiltonian of the system and analyze the energetic input-output relation of the VS.

INTRODUCTION

Electrical excitability of cells is possible because the
movement of a few charges can control the flow of many
charges. This principle — amplification — led Hodgkin
and Huxley [1] to their theory of the action potential in
terms of electrically controlled membrane conductances.
Electrically controlled conductances have been localized
to channel proteins conducting Na+ , K+ or Ca2+ ions
across the cell membrane. Voltage-controlled ionic conductances and the controlling intrinsic charge movements
(‘gating currents’) of ion channels have been studied experimentally (reviewed in 2). Electrophysiology has been
complemented by techniques measuring channel topology, channel structure and the change in channel function (reviewed in 3–5). Together, these perspectives provide detailed information on the ‘voltage sensor’ (VS)
common to these channels and exemplified by the S1–
S4 transmembrane segments of Shaker -type K+ channels. Here we use simulation to determine consequences
of voltage sensor models that are based on the ‘slidinghelix’ hypothesis in which the charged S4 segment responds to changes of the membrane electrical field by
sliding in a canal formed between other transmembrane
domains. This hypothesis, first proposed by Catterall
[6], qualitatively correlates a large body of experimental

work (reviewed in 3–5).
The relaxation times of the voltage sensor in K+ channels are of the order of milliseconds and thus are highly
averaged manifestations of atomic motion in a condensed
phase, where momentum is scattered in a picosecond
[7]. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis experiments
have shown that only a limited number of amino-acid
residues of a voltage-dependent ion channel are individually important for voltage sensitivity [3, 8–10]. On the
basis of these experimental facts, we describe the voltage sensor in a mesoscale model in which atoms are not
made explicit. Because amino-acid residues with formally charged side chains in the S4 as well as S2 and S3
transmembrane segments strongly determine VS function
[11], we explicitly represent the charges of these residues
in the model. These charges are embedded in an environment of spatially non-uniform electrical polarizability. We distinguish three dielectric regions in the model
(membrane lipid, baths, and protein) and describe electrical polarizabilities by linear dielectric coefficients that
are uniform within each region.
The resulting model shares important elements with
models previously investigated by Lecar et al. [12], Grabe
et al. [13], and Silva et al. [14]. We include fewer geometrical details than those models because we wish to
start from a minimalistic model; with that approach, the
importance of structural features can be discovered as
features are included or varied. Additionally, we use selfconsistent methods in solving our models.
Electrophysiological data on voltage sensor function

are recorded by a macroscopic setup that picks up charge
movements of a large ensemble of ion channels while
imposing a controlled voltage across the cell membrane
(‘voltage clamp’ [15, 16]). To simulate such an experiment, we encapsulate the microscopic model of a VS with
conductors clamped to imposed potentials from external
sources while monitoring charge displacement at these
electrodes. The electrostatics of the system composed
of the VS model and the electrode setup is solved selfconsistently. The configuration space of the model VS
(S4 translation and rotation) is systematically sampled
to construct a partition function based on the electrostatic configurational energy. Using this partition function, we compute ensemble expectations of observable
random variables (e.g., of gating charge displaced at an
applied voltage). In this way our theoretical results meet
two criteria for practical usefulness: they are consistent
solutions of the physics included in the model, and they
directly pertain to macroscopic experimental results.
This paper describes a building block toward creating a
mesoscale physical model for voltage-gated ion channels.
Such a channel comprises a gated central pore (through
which ions flow when the pore is gated open) surrounded
in the lipid membrane by four voltage sensor domains.
Here we describe and test a simulation system for a single voltage sensor. Using this setup, we simulate an ‘idle’
voltage sensor to study its reconfiguration and energetics
as the voltage changes while no external work is done. As
a step toward understanding how a sensor might interact with other parts of the channel, we then test how a
simulated ‘load’ alters the sensor movement and how the
work done on the load depends on the sensed variable, the
voltage. These simulations are done for two structures of
voltage sensor in which the S4 helix is arranged either
in the α conformation or the 310 -conformation. These
helix forms are currently discussed as possible alternatives for S4 structure [17–20]. Simulations with these
alternate structures reveal substantial consequences for
voltage sensing.

MODEL AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Figure 1 represents the simulation cell by an axial
cross-section of the radially symmetric three-dimensional
domain swept by rotating that cross-section about its
vertical axis. The external boundaries (in green, labeled bath & guard electrode) are the (voltage-clamp)
electrode surfaces kept at controlled electrical potentials.
The blue zones represent aqueous baths (labeled with a
dielectric coefficient ǫw = 80). The pink zone is a region
of small dielectric coefficient (labeled with ǫm = 2) that
represents the lipid membrane. The brown zone (labeled
S1–S3 & S4) represents the region of the channel protein
that we model; this region is assigned a dielectric coefficient of ǫp = 4 unless otherwise noted. These dielectrics
are piecewise uniform and therefore have sharp boundaries (solid black lines). Point source charges represent-

ing protein charges of interest are embedded in the region
of protein dielectric. Variation of their placement is part
of this study and will be detailed later. The protein region as seen here represents the matrix of the S4 helix
as a central cylinder, surrounded by the other parts of
the channel that also create a dielectric environment different from the dielectric environment of the membrane
lipid. Included in the protein region are the invaginations
which allow the baths to extend into the planes defining
the lipid phase of the membrane. The radius of the S4
dielectric domain is 1 nm (α helix) or 0.98 nm (310 helix).
Point source charges representing protein charges are
arranged at a minimal distance of 0.2 nm from the protein/water boundary. The charged guanido group of each
arginine residue of the S4 segment is represented as three
point source charges of +(1/3)e0 on a circle of radius
0.122 nm [blue (dark gray) spheres in Fig. 2]. The centers of the S4 arginine charges are arranged on a helix
defined by arginine side chains on an α- or 310 helix backbone, where every third amino acid is an arginine. For
the α helix, charged residues are separated by 0.45 nm
in the transmembrane direction and 60◦ leftward around
the helix; for the 310 helix, charged residues are separated
by 0.6 nm and 0◦ .
Dimensions of the simulation surfaces are varied within
those constraints as defined in Figs. 1(B) and 1(C). Figure 1(B) maps the topology of the protein and membrane
surface of Fig. 1(A) onto metrics for simulations, defined
in Fig. 1(C). Since the surfaces in the system are radially
symmetrical and smooth, the system is defined by a set
of inflection points with their curvature on the left half
of the system to be simulated. Since the gating canal is
symmetrical in these models, this further reduces to the
upper half of the left side.
We analyze two degrees of freedom for the movement of
the S4 segment: the curve on which (triplets of) S4 charge
centers are aligned can be both translated along the helix
axis and rotated about that axis. The model S4 charges
thus move like parts of a solid body. Negatively charged
residues contributed by the S2 and S3 transmembrane
segments of the natural VS are modeled as point source
charges of −1 e0 fixed on a curve parallel to the curve on
which S4 charges are centered [red (light gray) spheres in
Fig. 2]; the offset from the helix axis of the countercharge
curve is 0.466 nm larger than the radius of the curve of
the centers of the (triplets of) S4 charges [see Fig. 1(C)].
The axial and angular intervals between countercharges
are discussed in Sec. IV. countercharges are stationary in
their assigned positions.
The electrodes encapsulating the simulation cell serve
three purposes:
1. The bath electrodes provide Dirichlet boundary
conditions corresponding to a voltage clamp.
2. The bath electrodes substitute for screening
by bath ions of uncompensated protein charge.
Screening by the ions in an aqueous bath is equivalent to the screening provided by charge on a metal

FIG. 1. Simulation cell. (A) The 3D setup is produced by rotating the cross-section about its vertical axis. Green lines (labeled
as bath & guard electrodes) are electrode surfaces bounding the cell. Black lines are dielectric boundaries separating uniform
dielectric regions: baths (blue, with dielectric coefficient ǫw ), membrane lipids (pink, with dielectric coefficient ǫm ), and protein
(brown with dielectric coefficient ǫp ). Charges of protein side chains (represented by colored balls in Fig. 2) are embedded in
the protein dielectric region in varied geometries. We thus simulate a single VS sensor domain (S1–S4) modeled as a central S4
cylinder surrounded by a ring of protein material including the S1–S3 transmembrane domains. The junction between these
protein domains is narrowed to less than the membrane thickness by circular invaginations (‘vestibules’) leading up to the
‘gating canal’ through which the S4 helix glides through the rest of the protein (dashed line). (B, C) Geometrical parameters

are varied among different models, depending on countercharge positions and helix conformation. Positions in r (radial) and z
(axial) coordinates are marked by a colored point and an associated number. All corners are rounded with curvature radius of
0.15 nm. Points 1,2,3,4, and 6 define the profile of the lipid and protein dielectrics, from the outermost end of the lipid domain
(1) to the face of the S4 cylinder (6). Point 5 marks the radial position assigned to countercharges, point 7 the radial position
of S4 charges. (C) Coordinates (in nanometers) of the points defining membrane and protein metrics. Models are symmetrical

foil placed in the water a distance away from the
protein boundary. In the Debye-Hückel theory, an
electrode distance of ∼0.8 nm corresponds to the
physiological bath ionic strength; thus the electrode
location shown in Fig. 1(A) corresponds to a bath
solution in the low millimolar range. An alternate
configuration, a simulation cell with the bath regions omitted and the electrodes placed directly on
the membrane and protein boundaries, would establish screening at the Onsager limit approached
at exceedingly large ionic strength. In this way, the
possible range of screening effects can in principle
be determined without including explicit bath ions
in the simulation.
3. At the surface where the membrane region meets

the cell boundary, a set of guard electrodes forming
rings around the cell maintain a graded far potential varying, from ring to ring, between the potentials applied at the inner and outer bath electrodes.
These guard electrodes impose at the membrane
edge a far potential similar to that existing in a
macroscopic system.
Translational and rotational motions of the S4 helix
are simulated by allowing the ensemble of S4 charges to
slide within the dielectric domain of the protein shown in
Fig. 1. The protein dielectric itself does not slide with the
charges. With the protein dielectric extended far enough
into the baths, keeping the S4 dielectric stationary has
negligible electrostatic consequences because the dielectric of the model is uniform within the protein domain.

4
Simulating S4 motion in this way reduces the computational effort of model exploration by several orders of
magnitude.

METHODS
Electrostatics

We are concerned with the electrostatic interactions
among charged groups of the VS protein, electrode
charges and charges induced on sharp dielectric boundaries. In solving the electrostatics, we take advantage of
the fact that all other charges besides the point source
charges of the protein are distributed on a few boundary
surfaces rather than distributed throughout a volume.
The primary task of calculating electrostatic interactions
consists in determining the charge distributions on the
electrode and dielectric boundaries, distributions which
are initially unknown for a given configuration of protein
charges and applied voltage.

1.

Computation of unknown charges

Boda et al. [21] have described and tested a boundary element method (the induced charge calculation)
for computing the charge distribution on the dielectric
boundaries of a system consisting of point source charges
and linear isotropic dielectrics with sharp boundaries.
We include an additional electrostatic element, the ‘electrode’: an infinitesimally thin conductive foil charged to a
prescribed electric potential using an external source. In
our system, this surface is also a dielectric boundary between the simulation cell and the dielectric surrounding
the cell (e.g., vacuum). Thus the charge of an electrode
is in part induced charge (as in the paper by Boda et al.)
and source charge (to fix the prescribed potential). In
the following, we show how the total electrode charge can
be calculated without needing to separately calculate its
parts. The electrode charge calculation complements the
induced charge calculation, making it possible to calculate all the initially unknown charges in the system.
The spatial density of source charge ρsrc in our system
is composed of the point source charges qksrc of the VS protein located at positions rk and source charge distributed
on the electrodes E with surface density σ src (r ∈ E).
The polarization charge density induced at any location r in a dielectric is
ρind (r) =

∇ǫ(r)
1 − ǫ(r) src
ρ (r) − ǫ0
· E(r),
ǫ(r)
ǫ(r)

(1)

where ǫ is the generally location-dependent dielectric
coefficient, ǫ0 the permittivity of the vacuum, and E
the electric field strength produced by all (source and
induced) charges in the system. This relation follows
from Poisson’s equation (including polarization) and the

constitutive relation describing polarization in a linear,
isotropic dielectric [21]. The first term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (1) describes the charge induced on the surfaces of the volume element at r if the element contains
source charge. The second term describes charge induced
in the volume element by the electric field if the dielectric
coefficient at r has a non-zero gradient.
For our charge calculations, we combine collocated
source and induced charges into an effective charge for
computing the field and potential. The effective charge
density associated with a known source charge density
ρsrc (r) embedded in a dielectric [described by a locally
uniform ǫ(r)] is
ρeff (r) =

ρsrc (r)
.
ǫ(r)

(2)

The effective charge density of an electrode includes both
contributions to the induced charge described by Eq. (1),
as well as the source charge.
The dielectric boundaries B inside the simulation cell
(marked in heavy black in Fig. 1; all lines but the electrodes) do not carry source charge. However, the electric field in the simulation cell induces the charge density
σ ind (r) at locations r ∈ B. This induced charge density
is initially unknown.
The field strength E and potential V in our system are
produced by the superposition of the fields and potentials
of the source and induced charges:

dielectric boundary is related to the field strength by [21]
σ ind (r) = −

ǭ(r)

(5)

where r is any location on the surface B, ∆ǫ(r) is the
difference in the dielectric coefficient across the dielectric boundary in the normal direction n(r), and ǭ(r) is
the mean of the dielectric coefficients at the boundary
location.

FIG. 2. VS charge positions and dielectric boundary surfaces in the α-helical model. Blue (dark gray) symbols: S4 charges, each
represented as three point source charges of +(1/3)e0 ; Red (light gray) symbols: countercharges in the S2 and S3 segments,
each represented as a single point source charge of −1e0 . The dielectric boundary surface is divided into curved tiles whose
magnitudes are varied depending on their distance from the point source charges and local curvature. This is the surface grid
used in solving the induced-charge calculation. The figure is drawn using perspective-enhancing features. See also Fig. 9.

The potential at any location r on the electrode surfaces E has a value V VC (r) imposed by the voltage clamp:
V (r) = V VC (r).

(6)

Inserting the expression for the electric field strength
from Eq. (3) into Eq. (5) and inserting the expression
for the electric potential from Eq. (4) into Eq. (6) yields
two integral equations in terms of both σ ind (r ∈ B) and
σ eff (r ∈ E). The initially unknown charge densities on
the dielectric and electrode boundaries are the joint solution of these two integral equations.
To solve the integral equations, we follow the method of
Boda et al. [21]. The surfaces B and E are subdivided into
curved surface elements. The unknown charge densities
are approximated as uniform on each surface element.
The two integral equations then become one system of
linear equations in terms of the unknown charge densities
of a finite number of surface elements.
The inhomogeneity of surface charge in our simulation
is greatest where point source charges of the VS protein are close to a dielectric boundary or electrode. For
computational efficiency, we vary the size of the surface
subdivisions depending on the distance from the point
source charges. A typical surface grid (comprising ∼7000
surface elements) is shown in Fig. 2 for the dielectric surfaces in the simulation cell. The electrode surfaces (not
included in Fig. 2) are subdivided into ∼1700 relatively
large elements because of their distance from point source
charges.
The computation of the unknown charges on the surface elements involves solving a linear equation system
in terms of as many unknowns (N ) as there are surface elements. The coefficient matrix of this system

is dense, therefore the LU-decomposition time increases
with O(N 3 ). This computational disadvantage is greatly
alleviated by the fact that LU -decomposition of the coefficient matrix needs to be done only once for a given combination of surface geometry and dielectric coefficients.
When the S4 charges are moved, solutions to this system of equations are obtained by back-substitution using
the same LU-decomposed matrix. That O(N 2 ) operation
(back-substitution) is required for each sampled configuration of VS charges but not for each applied voltage
tested, as described later.

where S is the closed surface around the volume V, da is
the area of the surface element located at r ∈ S, n(r) is
the normal unit vector for that surface element, dτ is the
volume of the space element located at r ∈ V, and ρsrc is
the source charge density inside the volume.
Gauss’s theorem provides a sum-rule test for our solution of the electrostatics that is applicable to the specific
geometry used in a simulation. We verify the theorem
at the dielectric boundary of the VS protein because: 1)
that boundary is closest to the protein source charges of
interest; and 2) the field at that boundary produces the
largest density of induced charge in our system. The volume integral in Eq. (7) yields the known algebraic sum of
the point source charges assigned to the VS residues. The
surface integral can be expressed in terms of the charges
induced by the normal field at the discretized dielectric
boundary. We consider the residue given by the difference of the surface and volume integrals as a measure of

by monitoring electric flux across a surface surrounding
a bath electrode. A more efficient method is provided by
the Ramo-Shockley (RS) theorem [22, 23]; for an application to ion channels see [24]). The RS theorem lays the
groundwork as well for an efficient method of computing
the electrostatic energy of VS configurations when the
applied voltage is varied [25]. The RS theorem is applicable to systems containing linear dielectrics.
The RS theorem can be formulated for the configuration of electrode potentials in this study. We apply equal
and opposite potentials Vm /2 and −Vm /2 to the internal and external bath electrodes to create a membrane
voltage Vm (defined as internal minus external potential).
We determine the displaced charge in a simulation in two
steps:

FIG. 3. Test of numerical accuracy using Gauss’s theorem.
Qerror as defined by Eq. (8) is plotted versus S4 translation
[Eq. (18) is applied to calculate the expectation value over
the rotational degree of freedom]. Normal electric flux is integrated over the surface of the protein (brown region in Fig. 1,
labeled S1–S4). The protein region contains a net charge
of +3e0 (six positive S4 charges and three negative countercharges). The charge error is computed for three applied voltages (−100 mV, circles; 0 mV, line; 100 mV, crosses).

where aj is the area of the protein surface element j, ǫj

electrostatics.
The error in the induced charge calculation is likely to
vary as S4 charges are moved in a simulation since the distances between the S4 charges and the dielectric boundary vary. Figure 3 shows the error in induced charge
calculation for the full range of S4 translational positions
sampled in a typical simulation. The error is ≤0.008 e0
of the actual net charge of 3 e0 assigned to the VS in this
simulation. The results of our charge calculation are thus
in good agreement with Gauss’s theorem, as they must
be. This test was performed for every simulation.
2.

Computation of charge displacement and electrostatic
energy

When the charges of the VS change position, the electric flux toward one bath electrode generally increases
by the same amount as the electric flux decreases toward
the other bath electrode. To maintain a constant voltage between the two electrodes, charge has to be moved
externally between the electrodes. This charge is the experimentally measured displaced gating charge. In principle, one can measure displaced charge in a simulation

1. Set all point source charges to zero and apply +1/2
V at the internal and −1/2 V at the external bath
electrode. Solve for the unknown electrode and induced boundary charges. From these charges, an
electric potential V0 (r) can be computed for any
geometrical location r of the simulation cell.
2. In a simulation with the actual point source charges
qk present and arbitrary potentials +Vm /2 and
−Vm /2 applied at the internal and external bath
electrodes, determine the displaced charge Qk from
the relation
Qk = −qk V0 (rk )/(1 V)

(9)

Note that Qk = 0 for all geometrical positions rk
where V0 (rk ) = 0, and Qk varies between −qk /2
and +qk /2 as the position of qk is varied from the
internal to the external bath electrode.
When several point source charges are in the simulation, the total displaced charge is the algebraic
sum of the displaced charges defined by Eq. (9) for
each point source charge:
Q=

X

Qk

(10)

Step 1 is executed once for the chosen configuration of
electrodes and dielectrics in the simulation (including dielectric coefficients). Step 2 is executed once for each
configuration of point source charges. Since the displaced
charge determined in step 2 is invariant with respect to
the potentials applied at the electrodes, it needs to be
calculated only once for each point-charge configuration,
regardless of variation in the electrode potentials.
The RS theorem also makes it possible to compute
the electrostatic energy of a VS configuration with the
algebraic sum of two terms:
W = W1 + W2 ,
determined by separate calculations:

where V VE =0 (rk ) is determined by Eq. (4), excluding self-interactions for each source charge qk .
2. Calculate the displaced charge Q corresponding to
the point source charges and their positions using
Eq. (10). For the imposed voltage Vm , calculate:

∆W (meV)

W1 =

(13)

Step 1 of this procedure is executed once for each sampled
configuration of point source charges. Step 2 is executed
repeatedly for each applied voltage that is tested.
The calculations of displaced charge and electrostatic
energy via Eqs. (10) and (11) are independently verified
by computing the electrostatic energy by the path integral of the electric force acting on the charges qk of the
VS as those charges move from r′k to r′k :

Statistical mechanics

Displaced gating charge is experimentally measured
from ensembles of channels and thus is an ensemble average. Our electrostatic calculations yield both the displaced charge and the electrostatic part of the configurational energy for a given configuration of a simulated
VS model. We consider whole-body movements of S4
charge in two degrees of freedom: translation along the
S4 axis and rotation about that axis. Our computational
method is efficient enough to allow systematic sampling
of this configuration space. We represent each dimension
by 51 equally spaced grid nodes and compute the electrostatic energy for the 2601 nodes of the two-dimensional
space.
The energy samples define a canonical partition function describing the consequences of the electrostatics on

the distribution of an ensemble in the discretized configuration space:

where i and j are the indices of the rotational and translational discrete positions; ∆Wij is the electrostatic configurational energy of the voltage sensor at translational
position i and rotational position j; kB is the Boltzmann
constant; and T = 298.15 K is the absolute temperature. The sampled rotational range is 360◦, and a typical
translational range is −1.625 nm to +1.625 nm relative
to the central position of the S4 charges in α-helical models (±2.102 nm for 310 -helical models). Restricting the
configuration space this way is equivalent to including
hard-wall potentials into the Hamiltonian [Eq. (11)].

Figures 9 & 10 and the associated Supplemental Animations 1 [26] & 2 [27] illustrate VS geometry and movement for the simulations presented in this paper. They
show the expectation(s) of position for VS charges superimposed over the distribution of charge density. In the
animation, voltage is changed in a ramp from −100 to
+100 mV. Note that these animations are of the VS without an external load attached — as in Sec. IV A rather
than Sec. IV B.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The relationship between the expectation of displaced
charge and the applied membrane voltage in a slidinghelix model of an individual VS domain is shown in
Fig. 5(A). The solid line represents the computed relation. Open circles represent the relationship experimentally observed in ShakerB K+ channels [Fig. 2A in
9] — the experimental charge per channel was divided
by the number of channel monomers (4, where each includes one VS domain). Three observations can be made

Charge Displaced (e0 )

The goal of our simulations is to study the energetics
of the movement of the S4 segment for two degrees of
freedom. We are concerned only with variation of the
Hamiltonian due to changes in S4 position for this space.
Since these simulations are done for varied settings of an
external parameter (applied voltage), the energy at the
reference position for ∆W must be invariant with respect
to applied voltage.
In our simulations, a voltage Vm is applied across
the bath electrodes by imposing the potentials +Vm /2
and −Vm /2 at the internal and external bath electrodes.
Hence, there are locations in the simulation cell where
the potential V due to the applied field and the displaced
charge Qk for any point charge there are zero for any Vm
[Eq. (9)]. Since we are concerned with the position of the
S4 segment which bears point charges qk at several locations, we define the S4 reference position such that the
total displaced charge there is zero. By Eq. (10) and due
to the polarity of the fields applied, there are positions
for the S4 segment where Q is zero, and therefore the
energy for those configurations is invariant with regard
to Vm . Because of the symmetries in this study, these
reference positions coincide with the origin of the translational axis (z = 0 nm for any rotation φ; we choose
φ = 0).

FIG. 5. Simulated charge-voltage relations (solid lines) compared to experiment (symbols). (A) α-helical S4 segment; (B)
310 -helical S4 segment. The experimental relation applies
to Shaker K+ channels [9]. Dashed lines: computed curves
shifted to match the midpoint of the experimental curve (shift
is 1/2 of the experimental range).

by comparing the two relations: (1) the total amounts
of charge that can be moved by large changes of voltage are similar, ∼3 elementary charges per VS domain;
(2) the slopes of the two relations are similar; and (3) a
shift along the voltage axis is needed to align the midpoint of the computed relation with the midpoint of the
experimental relation (dashed line).
The VS charges in the simulation for Fig. 5(A) are arranged according to an α-helical geometry (Figs. 2 & 9).
An analogous simulation in which the VS charges conform to a 310 -helical geometry (Fig. 10) yields a different result [Fig. 5(B)]. With regard to the experimental
charge-voltage relation, the 310 model yields less total
charge movement over the tested voltage range and a
smaller maximal slope.
The models giving the charge-voltage relations of Fig. 5
involve idealized domain geometries and use the dielectric

9
coefficient ǫp = 4. These are initial choices made in this
study — no variations were made to produce more realistic predictions. The geometries of S4 charges were idealized to conform with two kinds of helices. The countercharges (3) were arranged on a spiral (α helix) or straight
line (310 helix) paralleling the curve of the S4 charges.
The only parameter optimized in light of the experimental results was the countercharge spacing (the translational and angular intervals between countercharges). In
the models used in this paper, countercharges are spaced
at 2/3 the intervals of the S4 charges, so that at most one
S4 charge lines up with a countercharge for any particular
S4 position.
The simulations reported in Fig. 5 indicate that voltage
sensing by a sliding-helix is robust from an engineering
point of view. In these generic models, either the α- or
310 -helical S4 structure can produce voltage-dependent
charge displacement, even though the two structures involve distinct configurations of the protein charges. The
two forms of helix generate different responses to voltage
in the tested models, but neither form produces catastrophic failure. The biological channels whose structurefunction relation we seek to ultimately understand in
engineering terms themselves show robustness: different
channel types exhibit a wide range of response to voltage
while remaining functional under many mutations that
cause their response to change, and yet they all use a
common architecture. On these grounds, useful insights
are expected from analyzing a mesoscale physical model.

A.

Energetics of ‘idling’ voltage sensors

The mobile charges of the VS model lie within the
electric field of the charges on the electrodes, the stationary countercharges, and the charges induced in the
dielectrics. We model those mobile charges as parts of
a solid body with two degrees of freedom of solid-body
motion: translation along the S4 axis and rotation about
that axis. Energy is computed on a grid over this configuration space [Eq. (11)]. From the electrostatic energy
map, a partition function is constructed [Eq. (15)], and
from the partition function, statistics of random variables
[Eq. (17)] are predicted. The energy map thus defines
the expectations of observables such as the gating charge
displacement (Fig. 5). This energy map is computed for
each tested value of applied voltage. These maps and
the resulting partition functions are outputs of the model
system.
Pseudo-color maps of electrostatic energy in the two
dimensions computed for applied voltages of 0 mV and
−100 mV are shown in Fig. 6. The translational and
rotational origins correspond to the central S4 position
shown in Fig. 2 for the α helix (change in energy is relative to those origins, where Q is zero). Because of the
symmetry of these models, the map for +100 mV (not
shown) is a mirror image of the map for −100 mV.
For a membrane voltage of 0 mV, the energy maps of

both helical models reveal a trough bounded on all sides
by regions of substantially higher energy. The energy
trough runs in the direction of proportional translation
and rotation for the α-helical S4 model, but it runs in
the direction of simple translation for the 310 -helical S4
model. The trough in the map of each model follows
the countercharge arrangement — an arrangement chosen for each model to allow periodic interactions during
S4 motion of the S4 charges with the countercharges. In
the α-helical model, the S4 charges and countercharges
are aligned on parallel super-helices, whereas in the 310 helical model the S4 charges and countercharges follow
straight lines parallel to the helical axis. The lowest electrostatic energies of the α-helical S4 segment trace the
path of a screw, whereas the energies of the 310 -helical
S4 segment trace the path of a piston.
The regions outside the energy trough for the 310 helix have energies about three times as large as those of
the α helix. The electrostatic confinement of the 310 helix is stronger than that of the α helix. The strength of
confinement correlates inversely with the separation of
charges in the two geometries. The cluster of S4 charges
and countercharges is more spread out in space in the
α-helical than in the 310 -helical geometry due to the angular separations of charges in the α-helical S4 segment.
The electrostatic energy trough tends to anchor the
sliding-helix in a transmembrane configuration. The S4
charges that, for a given configuration, dwell in the region of small polarizability are balanced in this model by
countercharges located in that region. This balance is
maintained over the range of S4 travel where equivalent
amounts of S4 charge and countercharge overlap in the
region of weak dielectric (see the Supplemental Material,
animation 1 [26] & Fig. 9 below). A second essential
element of balance concerns the transit of S4 charges between the less polarizable gating canal region and the
more polarizable vestibule and bath regions. Any energy
change associated with the transit of an S4 charge on one
side is approximately balanced on the other side by the
opposite transit of an S4 charge. On the other hand, the
energy trough generated by the electrostatics of the models is too shallow by itself to ensure long-term stability of
the S4 configuration. Interactions beyond those included
in the model (such as linkages to adjacent transmembrane segments or hydrophobic effect of the uncharged
S4 residues) are necessary for long-term stability.
To inspect the energetics more closely, we construct a
one-dimensional energy profile for S4 translation by computing for each translational position the expectation of
the electrostatic energy in the rotational degree of freedom using the rotational partition function [Eq. (18)].
We refer to this kind of energy profile as a ‘translational energy profile’ for short. Figures 6(E) & 6(F) show
the translational energy profiles for two applied voltages:
0 mV (solid lines) and −100 mV (dashed lines). The
profiles at 0 mV are quite uniform over the translational
extent of the energy trough (a consequence of the chosen spacing of countercharges). At a membrane voltage

of the S4 helix can travel with an almost level energy
over the translation range where S4 charges overlap with
stationary countercharges. To examine the contribution
of the countercharges to this result, we re-compute the
energy profile for the α-helical S4 segment with the countercharges deleted from the model (Fig. 7). Deletion of
the countercharges converts the energy trough seen with
the standard model (dashed line) into a broad barrier
(solid line). That barrier is reduced but not inverted
by increasing the VS dielectric coefficient ǫp from 4 to
16 (dotted line). For comparison, a sliding-helix model
without countercharges using ǫp = 10 has been analyzed
previously by Grabe et al. [13].
Over the range of translation where the countercharges
produce an energy trough (dashed line), the deletion of
the countercharges (solid line) has a rather small effect
(note that we plot energy relative to the central position).
Movement of the S4 helix encounters little energy variation in this region of translation because the amount of
S4 charge present in the domain of weak dielectric does
not vary: as S4 charge enters on one side, S4 charge
leaves on the other side. The energetics are not favorable
for these S4 positions (as the charges are not balanced),
but they are rather uniformly unfavorable until S4 translation exceeds ∼1 nm from its center position. If the
travel of the S4 helix is restricted to ±1 nm in a biological channel by means other than the countercharges
deleted here, then even an S4 segment without balancing
countercharges could perform as a voltage sensor.
The variations of energy are small over the traveled
range of translation in Figs. 6(E) & 6(F). The restriction
in the model that the S4 domain and its charges must
move as a single solid body might be expected to ‘synchronize’ periodic interactions among charges and countercharges, leading the energetics to express several dis-

tinct barriers and wells. The chosen spacing of the countercharges, however, is enough to prevent the emergence
of such a pattern. Additional degrees of freedom are
thus not a prerequisite for smooth S4 travel (examples
of such degrees of freedom are the possible flexibility of
the individual charge-bearing S4 residues or changes in
configuration of the helix between the α and 310 forms,
17–20).
Although the energy profiles of the two helix forms
are similar, the small differences between them are sufficient to produce substantial differences in the relations
between displaced charge and voltage (Fig. 5). Because
of the small size of these energy differences, contributions
to the Hamiltonian not included in the model (in particular contributions arising by coupling of the VS to other
parts of the channel) could override the differences between the S4 helix versions seen in Fig. 5 and Figs. 6(E)
& 6(F).
Additional axes of variation for these models with consequences for voltage gating include the geometry of the
gating pore region, the dielectric coefficient of the protein
region, the distribution of countercharges, and the effects
of additional surface charges. We have partially explored
these spaces [30]. The robustness of the mechanism explored here in the face of pathology due to mutation can
also be explored with this approach, given the computational tractability of these mesoscale models.

B.

Energetics of ‘working’ voltage sensors

The essence of a voltage sensor is that it can do external work when the membrane voltage is varied. This
work can then be applied, for instance, to reconfiguring the channel between conducting and non-conducting
configurations (gating). In order to determine the work
that a voltage sensor model might produce, we simulate
models with a translation-dependent external workload
included in the Hamiltonian. The potential energy field
in which the S4 domain translates and/or rotates then
comprises the electrostatic potential energy described by
Eq. (11) plus the potential energy WL due to the load:
W = W1 + W2 + WL .

(19)

For our examples, we use a hypothetical load field producing a constant force opposing the inward translation
of the S4 segment and hence a load potential that varies
linearly with translation [Fig. 8(A)]. This describes the
energetics if, for instance, the gate of a hypothetical channel with a single VS resists closing (by inward movement
of the S4 helix) with a constant force.
The presence of this load alters the relation between
the mean displaced charge and voltage by shifting the
curve to negative voltages [Fig. 8(B), compare Fig. 5].
In the case of the α-helical S4 model, the charge-voltage
curve becomes quite similar to that observed in the experiment with full channels [symbols in Fig. 5(A)].

S4 helix inward while external work is done against the
load. In the region Vm > V2 , both the applied voltage
and the work done on the S4 helix by the load drive
the S4 helix outward (hQi > 0). In the intermediate region V1 < Vm < V2 , the S4 helix is also driven outward
(hQi > 0). Here the applied-voltage and load components of the Hamiltonian have opposite polarities: outward S4 motion prevails because the load prevails over
the opposing effect of applied voltage.

The work exchanged between the VS and the load
(h∆WL i) varies most strongly with voltage where the
variation of displaced charge is maximal, as expected if
the load depends on S4 position. Two points on the axis
of applied voltage are associated with polarity changes
of displaced charge and/or of components of the Hamiltonian in Fig. 8 (not marked): V1 for hQi (B), h∆W2 i
(C), and h∆WL i (D); and V2 = 0 for h∆W2 i (C). In the
voltage region Vm < V1 , the applied voltage drives the

The translation range traveled by the S4 helix is limited in these simulations by the electrostatics of the VS
rather than by the hypothesized load. The limits are set
by the electrostatic self-energy component of the Hamiltonian, ∆W1 (Fig. 6, Vm = 0). Therefore, the work that
the VS can do on the load at large (positive or negative)
voltages saturates [Fig. 8(D)], whereas the (negative) energy contributed to the VS by the applied field continues
to increase in magnitude [Fig. 8(C)]. Biological K+ channels open with very low probability (< 10−6 ) at large

In order to assess the relationship between the electrical work picked up by the VS and the external work
delivered to the load, we consider the expectations of
∆W2 [Fig. 8(C)] and ∆WL [Fig. 8(D)]. The expectation
for ∆W2 has a simple relationship to the expectation of
displaced charge:

negative voltages with no indication of a saturating minimal probability [8–10]. This may indicate that the load
imposed on the VS domains by the ‘gate’ of the channel
actually limits S4 travel at large negative voltages. In
contrast, at large positive voltages the open probability
of the channels saturates at levels well below 1, suggesting a saturating amount of work that the VS domains
can do on the gate.
Figure 8 shows the simulation results for both the α
and 310 configurations of the S4 helix. The differences in
voltage responsiveness observed in the simulations with
the idling sensors are also found under the hypothetical
load that we test. This observation, however, cannot be
generalized. The differences between these two forms of
VS result from the associated electrostatic self-energies
∆W1 (as seen in Fig. 6). In the Hamiltonian of the system under load [Eq. (19)], characteristics are determined
by the sum of the self-energy term W1 and the load term
WL . Hence, it is in principle possible that the load transforms the characteristics of voltage sensing observed here
for the 310 -helical VS model into characteristics indistinguishable from those of the α-helical VS model or viceversa, or a load may even result in behaviors different
from those seen in either simulation. Experimental observations on displaced charge therefore cannot be interpreted in terms of models that include only a voltage
sensor. These observations, like those on gating, require
a model of the full channel to be analyzed.
The mesoscale model system that we have presented
for a single VS is extendable using the approach described
in this section. The Hamiltonian of the system can be
extended by terms describing the energetics of a channel comprising four voltage sensors, a gating domain,
and their coupling. The number of degrees of freedom
(e.g., two for each voltage sensor) remains computationally manageable, so that a mesoscale model of the full
channel can be simulated in order to obtain insight into
the cooperation of its parts.
We have analyzed here some equilibrium properties of
a VS domain in which the S4 helix is relocated as a solid
body. A refined model augmented with dynamics will
likely have to include a second scale describing motions
of side chains, possible deformations of the S4 helix, interactions with the bath solutions, and associated dissipative aspects. General energetic variational approaches
developed for hydrodynamic systems of complex fluids
[31] may provide a multi-scale approach to channel dynamics.

Appendix: Charge distributions of VS models

The sliding helix in our VS models is a microscopic
voltage sensor. Therefore, we describe the VS by its statistical ensemble behavior. In this appendix, stochastic
VS behavior is visualized for several models presented
in the paper, both as figures for a fixed applied voltage
(−100 mV; Figs. 9 & 10) and as associated Supplemental
Materials, animations 1 [26] & 2 [27] with voltage increasing uniformly over time from −100 mV to +100 mV.
The figures show two stochastic aspects of VS behavior: (1) the mean positions of the S4 charges [marked by
blue (dark gray) balls], and (2) the charge density distribution of S4 charge [represented by a blue (gray) cloud
with a color intensity proportional to the charge density
there]. A high density of color marks the locations where
the S4 charges dwell frequently, as opposed to their mean
positions.
The expectation of position for each charge is computed from Eq. (17) using the positions rk for the charge
qk as the random variable X, over the partition function with translational and rotational degrees of freedom.
Since the helix behaves as a solid body, the helix position
r fixes the positions rk for the charges qk . That relationship allows us to define the partition function, the energy
function, the configuration probability and our measures
for the positions rk in terms of the respective function
for the helix position r. For the expectation of position
for each charge:

where Wij is the work needed to construct configuration
ij, Pij is the probability of that configuration, and rijk
is the position of charge k in configuration ij.
Likewise, the distribution of charge can be computed
by applying the partition and energy functions in terms
of the positions rk of charges qk . The charge density
z̄(r) is then the sum over all charges of the probability of

FIG. 9. Standard α-helical model: Position and distribution of charges for model α (1) in Table 1(C) with ǫp = 4. Red (light
gray) symbols represent fixed negative countercharges, blue (dark gray) symbols represent the mean position of −1/3 e0 on S4
arginines, and blue (gray) shading represent the relative probability of negative charge at a given position. This is the model
used in Fig. 5(A). See the associated Supplementary Material, animation 1 [26] for the behavior of this model of the VS domain
over the range of transmembrane potentials from −100 mV to +100 mV.

FIG. 10. Standard 310 -helical model: Position and distribution of charges for model 310 in Table 1(C) with ǫp = 4. See
the description of Fig. 9 for further details. This is the model used in Fig. 5(B). See the associated Supplemental Material,
animation 2 [27] for the behavior of this model of the VS domain over the range of transmembrane potentials from −100 mV
to +100 mV.
