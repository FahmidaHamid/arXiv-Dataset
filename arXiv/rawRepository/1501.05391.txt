ABSTRACT
Introduction. Macular degeneration (MD) causes central visual field loss. When field defects occur in both eyes
and overlap, parts of the visual pathways are no longer stimulated. Previous reports have shown that this affects
the grey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding visual pathway structures have
not been fully established.
Method. In this multicentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and voxelbased morphometry to investigate the visual pathway structures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD).
Results. Compared to age-matched healthy controls, in patients with JMD we found volumetric reductions in the
optic nerves, the chiasm, the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations and the visual cortex. In patients with
AMD we found volumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations and the visual cortex.
An unexpected finding was that AMD, but not JMD, was associated with a reduction in frontal white matter
volume.
Conclusion. MD is associated with degeneration of structures along the visual pathways. A reduction in frontal
white matter volume only present in the AMD patients may constitute a neural correlate of previously reported
association between AMD and mild cognitive impairment.

INTRODUCTION
Macular degeneration (MD) is a class of eye diseases that causes visual field defects that are located
in or near the central visual field (central scotoma). According to the World Health Organization, in
2002, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the juvenile-type macular degeneration (JMD)
were the causes of blindness and low-vision in 8.7% of the 160 million cases worldwide.1 In recent
reports, AMD prevalence ranged from approximately 3 - 12%2-9, while the prevalence of JMD was
0.03%.10 In Europe, the retinal pathologies underlying AMD and JMD are listed in the top five of
causes of visual loss in both children and adults.11 In the European adult population, AMD is the
most common cause of visual impairment.12
	

Visual field loss in both AMD and JMD is primarily due to a loss of photoreceptors. Despite
this, and the similarity in the resulting visual field defects, AMD and JMD do not share a common
disease mechanism. The various macular pathologies underlying JMD may start early in childhood
and are mostly inherited. They include diseases such as Stargardt’s disease, Best's vitelliform retinal
dystrophy (Best’s disease), cone-rod dystrophy, and central areolar choroidal dystrophy. In AMD,
the accumulation of sub-macular deposit called drusen compromises retinal metabolism and leads to
the degeneration of the macula with or without neovascularization.13-16
	

An absence of afferent or efferent stimulation may result in structural brain changes, and this
has been reported in many conditions.17, 18 In cases where the central visual field defects in MD
overlap in the two eyes, this results in a reduced stimulation of part of the visual pathways and
visual cortex.19, 20 This, in turn, could result in changes to the structure of the visual cortex.21
Indeed, various retinal and optic nerve conditions have been found to be associated with cortical
thinning or cortical grey matter loss21-24, and with volumetric reduction of the more proximal visual
pathway structures such as the optic nerves.25 This raises the question whether MD might also
affect the structural integrity of the visual pathways. This question is relevant, as a positive answer
might implicate a need for modifications of the clinical management of MD. The question is also
relevant in the light of the conflicting reports on the presence of functional occipital reorganization
following retinal lesions.20, 26-30 Here, we investigate whether MD affects the structural integrity of
the visual pathways by comparing their structural MRI morphometry in patients with MD and
healthy controls.
METHODS
Subjects. Participants of this study were recruited in Groningen (the Netherlands), York and
London (United Kingdom) and Regensburg (Germany). This study conformed to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the respective medical review board of each centre
participating in the study, and national regulatory ethics bodies, where necessary. The inclusion
criteria required that subjects must be free from neurological or psychiatric disorders, and in the
case of the patients present with central visual field defect attributed to bilateral macular
degeneration. All participants gave their written informed consent before participation. The
participants with macular degeneration were classified into two groups: patients with JMD and
patients with AMD. In total, 114 subjects participated in this study: 25 with AMD, 34 with JMD,
and the remaining 55 were healthy controls. However, one patient with AMD decided to quit the
study, leaving in total 113 subjects included in the analyses.
	

The control subjects had a mean age of 49.6 years (range 13 to 83 years), and 46% of them
were males. Of these controls, 22 subjects were age-matched (mean age 68, range 61-83 years) to
the AMD group. The other 33 subjects (mean age 37.4, range 13 - 60 years) were age-matched to
the JMD group. The characteristics of the affected participants are described in Table 1.

Magnetic resonance image acquisition. Since the datasets were from three different study centres,
the magnetic resonance (MR)-acquisition parameters varied to some extent. However, all of the
acquisitions were of 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm resolution. MR imaging was performed on three different
scanners. Groningen datasets were acquired on a 3.0 Tesla Philips Intera (Eindhoven, The
Netherlands) at the MRI Centrum, University Medical Center Groningen. A three-dimensional
structural image was acquired on each subject using a sequence T1W/3D/TFE-2, 8º flip angle,
repetition time 8.70 ms, matrix size 256 x 256, field of view 230 x 160 x 180, yielding 160 slices. The
York dataset was acquired using 8-channel, phase- array head coils on either a Siemens Trio 3 Tesla
at the Combined Universities Brain Imaging Center (Royal Holloway University of London).
Multi-average, whole-head T1-weighted anatomical volumes were acquired for each participant.
Sequences used were MDEFT 16º flip angle, repetition time 7.90 ms, matrix size 256 x 256, field of
view 176 x 256 x 256, yielding 176 sagittal slices. The Regensburg dataset was acquired on a 3.0
Tesla Allegra Scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). One hundred and sixty slices covering the
whole brain, field of view = 256 x 256 mm, were obtained from each subject, using the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)31 sequence (TR = 8.79 ms, TE = 2.6 ms, flip angle 9°).
Data preprocessing. Bias correction and noise reduction. The images were converted from their native
formats into analyse (NIFTI) format. We performed bias correction (implemented in the SPM8
segmentation tool) and noise reduction using SUSAN (Smallest Univalue Segment Assimilating
Nucleus) (Smith and Brady, 1997) prior to the next steps. SUSAN is a part of FSL (FMRIB
Software Library, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).
	

Rigid body registration. We performed rigid body registration on the brains to a common
template using SPM8’s tool for co-registration. In this step, the brains are reoriented into the
common template space using six linear transformation parameters: 3 translations and 3 rotations.
All transformations are performed within a 3-dimensional coordinate system, with x, y, and z as its
axes. This rendered the images to have uniform dimensions and to be in approximate alignment to
each other.
	

Segmentation, registration, and modulation. We used SPM8’s DARTEL (Diffeomorphic
Anatomical Registration through Exponentiated Lie Algebra) suite of tools.32, 33 DARTEL tools
enabled us to create modulated grey and white matter images that were registered to a common
reference image specifically representing our sample. The study-specific approach we used here
enabled a more accurate inter-subject registration of brain images with improved localization and
sensitivity of the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). The process began with SPM8‘s segmentation,
3

which segmented the co-registered T1-weighted images, except for lateral geniculate body
extraction. For the latter structure, we used FAST (FMRIB’s Automated Segmentation Tool) and
fed the output into the DARTEL pipeline. After all the brains were segmented, a reference –or
template– image was generated. The first step in generating this reference image was averaging the
images of all brains. Following this, the individual brains were deformed and registered as closely as
possible to this reference image. Next, using the registered brain images, a new average reference
image was created to which the individual brain images were again registered. After 6 of these
averaging and registration cycles, the final reference image was generated. The final reference image
was then used as the template to which the native segmentations of the individual brains in the study
were registered and modulated.
Data analysis. We performed two types of analyses: (1) a whole brain voxel-wise analysis; and (2) a
region-of-interest (ROI)-based analysis. In the first type of analysis we did a whole brain analysis to
examine whether there were volumetric differences in general in AMD and JMD patients. In the
second type of analysis, we used masks to single out the visual pathways from the brain and analyze
data specifically in those regions.
	

Voxel-wise analysis. The process from the segmentation to the voxel-wise statistical analyses is
known as VBM, and is implemented in the SPM8 software package (Wellcome Department of
Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).34 VBM statistically assesses
local changes in grey and/or white matter volume between groups of anatomical scans, and makes it
possible to spatially detect any deviation in the visual pathways. Comparisons using ANCOVA were
done separately for the AMD group to their specific group of age-matched controls, and for the
JMD to their specific group of age-matched controls. Age was entered as a covariate in the analysis.
Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) methods35 were applied to minimize the need for large
scale smoothing or for predefining a significant cluster size. To control for a scanning site effect, we
included scanner location as a covariate in the voxel-wise analyses. Differences in volumes between
patients and healthy control subjects are shown in the figures for voxels with an associated p<.01 for
the whole brain analysis, and p<.05 for the masked voxel-wise analysis (uncorrected for multiple
comparisons). Only clusters with a minimum of 10 voxels are displayed.
ROI definition. In the ROI-based analysis, we used masks to extract ROI volumes from the
modulated normalized brain segments. We used masks for the pregeniculate structures, the lateral
geniculate bodies, the geniculo-calcarine radiations, the occipital pole, and the intracalcarine and
supracalcarine cortices. The masks that we used to extract the volume of the pregeniculate
structures and the lateral geniculate bodies were created manually, as the boundaries of those
structures can be clearly defined visually. These visually defined masks were created on the average
of all the images. The mask for the geniculo-calcarine radiations was taken from the Jülich
histological atlas36, 37, whereas the mask that covered the occipital pole, intra- and supracalcarine
cortices were taken from the Harvard Center for Morphometric Analysis.38-42 We defined five
regions-of-interest (ROIs) along the visual pathway: pregeniculate structures (PGCL), which
include the optic nerve, the chiasm and the optic tract, lateral geniculate bodies (LGB),
geniculocalcarine radiations (GCR), also known as optic radiations, the occipital pole (OCP) and
the calcarine region (CCR), which contains the intracalcarine and supracalcarine cortices. These
ROIs mark the separate volumes along the visual pathway we were interested in. Figure 1 shows
the locations of the masks used to define the ROIs on a template brain.

Statistical analysis of the ROI data. Prior to the statistical analysis, we verified that the extracted
values of the ROIs were normally distributed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Using repeated
measures ANOVA, we analyzed the significance of the differences in volume of the entire visual
pathway between the patient groups and their respective age-matched control groups. In this
analysis, group was entered as a between-subject variable and ROI as a within-subject variable. Age
and scanner location were added as a covariate. The significance of the differences in volume of the
separate ROIs were analyzed with t-tests. We visualized these differences within the defined ROIs
using a masked voxel-wise analysis.
RESULTS
Whole brain voxel-wise analysis. We performed a whole brain voxel-wise analyses to examine
whether there were differences in the grey and the white matter in MD in the visual pathways, but
also in regions outside of the visual pathways. Figure 2 shows results for this analysis. The upper
row of images shows the results for the JMD group, while the lower row of images is for the AMD
group, compared to their respective age-matched healthy controls. In both the JMD and the AMD
groups, we found reductions of grey (green and yellow color coded, respectively) and white (red
and blue color coded, respectively) matter located in the visual cortex and the optic radiations. The
reductions, in particular in the white matter, appear more pronounced in the AMD group than for
the JMD group. In the AMD group, we also find marked differences outside of the visual
pathways. These were mainly located in white matter in the frontal lobe, as shown in Figure 2,
compared to the age-matched healthy controls (p<.01 uncorrected).
	

We did not find any increases in grey or white matter in the whole brain voxel-wise analyses
for both types of MD.

on the upper row highlight the areas where the JMD group shows significantly lower volume compared to the age-matched
controls (p<.01, uncorrected). Green shows the involvement of grey matter, and red shows the involvement of white matter.
The transversal slices on the lower row highlight the areas where the AMD group shows significantly lower volume compared
to the age-matched controls (p<.01, uncorrected). Yellow shows the involvement of grey matter, blue shows the involvement
of white matter. Talairach position of the slices is given by their “z” value.

ROI-based analysis. In both the patients and the controls groups, the distribution of the volumes of
the ROIs did not deviate from normality. Table 3 shows, for the five ROIs, the mean volume and the
relative differences of the ROI volume for the patient groups relative to their age-matched controls.
Next, we tested whether there were volumetric differences in the defined ROIs along the visual
pathway between patients and controls. Figure 3 shows the mean volumes of each ROI for all four
groups: the AMD patients, the JMD patients, the older healthy controls and the younger healthy
controls. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the ROI volume as a function of age for the various
ROIs. The regression lines show the effect of age for the two control groups combined. In PGCL
and GCR, there is no significant correlation between ROI volume and age in the healthy controls.
5

In the other ROIs – LGB, OCP and CCR – volume reduces with age. The Pearson correlation
coefficients are respectively -.310, -.223 and -.252, in the LGB and CCR these correlation are
significant (p<.05). We therefore included age as a covariate in our subsequent analyses.

In general, for all ROIs, the volume is lower in the AMD patients than in the age-matched control
group (F(1, 42) = 20.415, p<.001). The same is true for the volume of the ROIs in the JMD
compared to the age-matched control group (F(1, 63) = 26.170, p<.001). T-tests showed that for the
AMD vs. HCO groups the differences were significant in the GCR, OCP and CCR ROIs, and for
the JMD vs. HCY the differences were significant in the LGB, GCR and OCP ROIs (all p<0.01).

In the subgroup of patients from Regensburg, data on duration of the macular degeneration at the
time of scanning, was available. This subgroup from Regensburg contained 34 patients in total, of
which 26 were JMD patients and 8 were AMD patients. In this group, we did not find a significant
correlation between ROI volume and disease duration in AMD or in JMD.
ROI-masked voxel-wise visualization. To visualize the distribution of the volumetric differences in
the ROIs, voxel-wise statistical comparisons were done on the ROI brain regions of the visual

brain highlight the areas where the AMD group shows significantly lower volume compared to the

DISCUSSION
MD is known as one of the primary causes of blindness and its retinal pathology has been studied
extensively. Only in recent years, however, the involvement of the cerebral cortex in this pathology
has become a topic of study.20, 21, 26, 43-45 Our previous findings of grey matter loss in the visual cortex
in AMD and glaucoma21, as well as in JMD24, and a reduced volume of the visual pathways in
glaucoma25 prompted us to study the question whether the (pre-cortical) visual pathway in MD
might also be affected. Here, we found that in MD there was indeed volumetric loss of the visual
pathway structures. Moreover, in the whole brain voxel-wise analysis we found a volumetric
reduction in the frontal lobe in AMD patients, mainly in the white matter. While previous studies
have shown that in MD the brain is functionally and structurally affected19, 21, 24, to our knowledge,
this is the first one to report on the extensiveness of the structural changes.
	

What may have caused this volumetric loss of the pathway structures in MD? A similar loss
has previously been reported in glaucoma.25 In glaucoma, it is rather intuitive that the retrobulbar
visual pathway may be involved in its pathology as there is a loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
and their axons form the optic nerve. However, in MD, the primary loss of vision is due to damage
of the photoreceptors46, which are first-order neurons. This degeneration does not necessarily have
to be transferred across the retinal layers to the bipolar (second-order neuron) and RGC (thirdorder neuron) layers and their projecting axons. This argument would hold even more for the
geniculate and post-geniculate structures. However, studies indicate that a loss of RGCs may also be
associated with the loss of photoreceptors in both wet AMD47 as well as in the later stages of dry
AMD (geographic atrophy).43, 48 This indicates that RGCs can be affected by the adverse effect of
photoreceptor degeneration and provides a possible mechanism that can explain the volumetric
reduction of the visual pathway and cortex in patients with MD.
	

Our initial ROI-based analysis, in which we investigate the volume of the separately defined
structures of the visual pathways, indicated changes in both AMD and JMD, when compared to
the age-matched controls (Figure 3, and Table 3). We also plotted ROI volume against age to verify
the presence of a correlation with age. Indeed, in the healthy controls we found a negative
correlation of age and volume to be present in the LGB, OCP and CCR (Figure 4). To account for
such age effects, age was included as a co-variate in the subsequent ROI- and voxel-wise analyses.
In the voxel-wise analyses, we compared the brains voxel-by-voxel along the visual pathway. In
JMD, we found volumetric differences along the full extent of the visual pathways. In AMD we
primarily found volumetric differences in the optic radiations and the visual cortex. Moreover, we
could confirm the previous findings of a reduction in grey matter in the early visual cortex.
	

Differences in PGCL and LGB in AMD were also shown in the uncorrected masked voxelwise analysis, but these findings did not remain significant in the ROI-analysis. This difference in
results between JMD and AMD group can have various possible explanations. It could be caused
by the lower number of AMD patients, compared to JMD patients, respectively 24 and 34.
Furthermore, it could be associated with notion that the volume of the PGCL appears to be larger in
the older control group than in the younger control group, as shown in Table 3. This apparent
increase in pre-geniculate volume with age might be a factor in the difference in results between
AMD and JMD, although this difference in PGCL volume between HCO and HCY is not
significant.
	

In both AMD and JMD the volume of the optic radiations are reduced markedly. The effect
in optic radiations actually appears to be larger than the effect in the anterior visual pathways. A
possible reason for this could be that besides feedforward projections from the LGB to the visual
cortex, corticogeniculate neurons provide input from the visual cortex back to the LGB.49 Such
feedback pathways have not been found between LGB and retina. Therefore, the optic radiations
could be affected more than the anterior visual pathways. Besides that, the size of the GCR ROI is
much larger than the PGCL, which implies that there might be more overlap between the subjects in
the GCR ROI than in the PGCL ROI.
	

Even though the visual cortex is one of the regions of cerebral cortex that is least affected by
50
age the age effects in the control groups suggest that it is necessary to account for age in the
analyses. Duration of the disease could possibly also have an effect on the degree of changes in the
visual pathways. In this study there was data available on disease duration only for the participants
from Regensburg. In this subgroup, we did not find a significant correlation between disease
duration and ROI volume. Nevertheless, we suggest that future studies should still consider taking
the duration of disease into account. JMD starts earlier in life and thus, at a particular age of the
subject, the disease period is usually longer, and thus hypothetically JMD will have had a larger
chance than AMD to affect the retrobulbar visual pathway.

Unexpectedly, in the whole brain voxel-wise analysis, we also found a lower volume in white
matter in the frontal lobe, specifically in the AMD participants. As far as we know, no relationship
between AMD and frontal lobe volume has been described. This finding could be associated with a
possible link between AMD and mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, which has been
suggested earlier, based on a number of epidemiological studies.51, 52 It should be noted, however,
that smoking is an important co-factor in this correlation.51 Unfortunately, we did not have
information about smoking habits on our patients. Nevertheless, a common pathogenic mechanism
for AMD and Alzheimer’s disease has been described.53 It is less plausible that reduced frontal lobe
volume could be due to a decreased activity of AMD participants as a consequence of their visual
impairment. If so, we would expect to find a similar effect in the JMD participants, which was not
the case. We suggest that a follow-up study is required to confirm the presence of an association
between AMD and frontal lobe grey and white matter density.
	

Our study design was cross-sectional, therefore we can54 not determine which happened
first, the volumetric reduction in the brain, or the degeneration of the macula. Macular degeneration
has been managed clinically as an ocular pathology. However, the structural changes, mainly in the
lateral geniculate bodies and the visual cortex, may alert clinicians to the possibility that brainrelated mechanism are involved in the disease. A neuroprotective approach to preserve the
photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium by the administration of ciliary neurotrophic factors55
or anti-inflammatory56 drugs might be worthwhile to consider as a first step. Our findings suggest
that any retinal neuroprothesis57 should be implanted as early as possible to avoid long-term, and
perhaps irreversible, reductions in grey matter of the visual pathway. A better comprehension of the
pathology underlying the various macular degeneration types and diagnostic approach are of utmost
importance to allow the quantification of treatment outcome. We believe that neuroimaging and
retinal imaging58, as well as their quantification methods21, 34, 59, 60, could – over time – become
clinically viable options to evaluate the progress of the disease and the treatment outcome.
	

In summary, in both age-related and juvenile MD the volume of the visual pathway is
significantly reduced. The extent of involvement was different for the two types of disease, with
JMD showing the most widespread involvement of the visual pathway. This implies that it could be
useful to also investigate the chronology of the visual pathway changes in macular degeneration.
Moreover, we found an indication that the white matter volume in the frontal lobe is reduced in
AMD. This could be the neural correlate of the proposed link between AMD and mild cognitive
impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.
