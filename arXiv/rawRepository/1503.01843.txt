Abstract
Discrete-time models are the traditional approach for capturing population dynamics of a hostparasitoid system. Recent work has introduced a semi-discrete framework for obtaining model update
functions that connect host-parasitoid population levels from year-to-year. In particular, this framework
uses differential equations to describe the hosts-parasitoid interaction during the time of year where they
come in contact, allowing specific behaviors to be mechanistically incorporated into the model. We use
the semi-discrete approach to study the effects of host-feeding, which occurs when a parasitoid consumes
a potential host larva without ovipositing. Our results show that host-feeding by itself cannot stabilize
the system, and both the host and parasitoid populations exhibit diverging oscillations similar to the
Nicholson-Bailey model. However, when combined with other stabilizing mechanisms such as densitydependent host mortality or density-dependent parasitoid attack rate, host-feeding expands the region
of parameter space that allows for a stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. Finally, our results show that
host-feeding causes inefficiency in the parasitoid population, which yields a higher population of hosts per
generation. This suggests that host-feeding may have limited long-term impact in terms of suppressing
host levels for biological control applications.

Introduction

The host-parasitoid dynamic typically involves a vulnerable period during the year in which hosts are susceptible to attack by parasitoids. There exists a tendency of synovigenic parasitoids to eat the host without
laying eggs inside [1, 2]. Generally, an adult female parasitoid emerges every year with less eggs than she can
potentially oviposit in her lifespan. Therefore, a parasitoid will feed on hosts to gain the necessary energy
and tissue to mature additional eggs [3, 4]. However, in doing so, the parasitoid loses a potential host as
the majority of parasitoids kill the host during host-feeding. This results in a high death rate of the host
population during the vulnerable period, which can have interesting consequences on later generations [5, 6].
For further reviews on the host-feeding interaction and its biological implications, we refer the interested
reader to [3, 7, 8].
A traditional approach to describe parasitoid-host dynamics is to use discrete time models, such as the
Nicholson-Bailey model [9] and others considered more recently [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Discrete models can
monitor the change in population density for distinct points in time, such as each year or each generation,
which agrees with typical life-cycle themes of insects in temperate climates [15]. Several authors incorporate
the effects of host-feeding in continuous models, which are suitable to year-round interactions such as those in
tropical climates. They conclude that host-feeding can have stabilizing effects [16, 17] or no effect on stability
[18, 19, 20], while Shea et. al. conclude that egg production delay has a destabilizing effect in host-feeding
models [21]. Further reviews on past and recent models are provided by Hassell et. al. in [22] and [23] and
by Murdoch et. al. in [15].

In this work, we use the semi-discrete framework [24] to develop discrete update functions based on
a continuous host-feeding dynamic. This modeling approach is more mechanistic as compared to early
phenomenological models because it incorporates specific host-parasitoid interactions during the vulnerable
period. We conclude that host-feeding has no effect on stability as compared to previous results by Singh
et. al [25]; however, host-feeding combined with density-dependent mortality rates and functional responses
has a stabilizing effect. The paper is organized as follows: we formulate the model in Section 2; in Section 3,
we consider the simplest case and show that host-feeding alone does not stabilize the Nicholson-Bailey model
[9]; in Sections 4 and 5, we incorporate the effects of density-dependent mortality and quadratic functional
response, respectively, and consider the stability of the system; we conclude with several discussion topics in
Section 6.

Model Formulation

Generally, the discrete-time model used to describe the host-parasitoid dynamics is given by
Ht+1 = F (Ht , Pt )

(1)

Pt+1 = G(Ht , Pt ),

(2)

where Ht and Pt are the adult female host and parasitoid densities, respectively, at the beginning of the
vulnerable period of year t, where t is an integer. Figure 1 illustrates the life cycle of the host and parasitoids
in a year long period. During year t, host pupae mature into Ht adults. These Ht adults lay a particular
amount of eggs, which eventually mature into RHt larvae at the beginning of the vulnerable stage. Here,
R > 1 denotes the number of viable eggs produced by each adult host. The time within the vulnerable stage
is denoted by τ , where τ ∈ [0, T ]. Time τ = 0 denotes the beginning of the vulnerable stage and τ = T
denotes the end. During this time, adult female parasitoids emerge with egg and seek out host larvae to
oviposit inside them. The parasitoid egg inside the host becomes a juvenile parasitoid that uses the host as
a resource. At the end of the vulnerable period, a proportion of the host population is infected. This results
in an initial parasitoid population the next year as juvenile parasitoids emerge from the host to continue
their life cycle. A number of hosts escape parasitism, and survive to mature into pupae, which pupate over
the winter creating the next year’s population of adult hosts. To better understand the discrete update of
each year, we consider a continuous model to describe the interaction of hosts and parasitoids during the
vulnerable period. Next, we discuss the approach to model this system of interactions.

2.1

The Semi-Discrete Framework

A continuous time model is used to describe the dynamics of the interacting host and parasitoid populations
during the vulnerable period. The update functions F and G of the discrete model depend on the output
of the continuous model at the end of the vulnerable period each year. We consider the following chemical
reaction
g( · )

P + L −−−→ I + P.

(3)

Here, g( · ) (units: time−1 parasitoid−1 ) is the attack rate of the parasitoids, which represents the instantaneous rate at which the hosts are attacked per parasitoid. This function could potentially be dependent on
the population of hosts, parasitoids, or infected hosts. In general, we write the continuous model as
dL(τ, t)
= −g( · )L(τ, t)P (τ, t)

dI(τ, t)
= g( · )L(τ, t)P (τ, t)

where L(τ, t), I(τ, t), and P (τ, t) denote the concentrations of host larvae, infected larvae, and parasitoids,
respectively, at time τ during the vulnerable period in year t. We subject the system to the following initial
conditions
L(0, t) = RHt ,

I(0, t) = 0,

P (0, t) = Pt .

(7)

These equations are integrated from τ = 0 to τ = T . Assuming each parasitized host larvae gives rise to k
adult parasitoids in the next generation, the update functions in the discrete model are
Ht+1 = F (Ht , Pt ) := L(T, t)
Pt+1 = G(Ht , Pt ) := kI(T, t).

(8)
(9)

Once the system is formulated, investigation into the stability region of Equations (1) and (2) can be carried
out using the standard Jury conditions [26]. If we let g = c, i.e. a constant parasitoid attack rate, then we
obtain the following update
F (Ht , Pt ) = RHt exp(−cPt T )


G(Ht , Pt ) = kRHt 1 − exp(−cPt T ) ,

(10)
(11)

which is the classic Nicholson-Bailey model. This interaction is unstable and over time both populations
experience diverging oscillations [15]. Several changes in the form of functional responses, susceptibility
of attack, and density-dependent mortality can be made to stabilize the system as in [25, 27]. Next, we
illustrate how we incorporate host-feeding into the semi-discrete framework and discuss how to obtain the
update functions.

2.2

The Semi-Discrete Framework with Host-Feeding

The continuous model we consider includes the tendency of the parasitoids to feed on host larvae without
infecting them with an egg [3, 4]. This means the parasitoid population has two phases: without egg and
with egg. If a parasitoid lays an egg inside the larva, an infected larva is produced and the parasitoid is now
without an egg. This eggless parasitoid must feed on a host larva before gaining another egg; however, if
a parasitoid has an egg, it will infect the larvae rather than feed. Implicit to our model is the assumption
3

that once a parasitoid feeds on the host, it immediately gains enough energy to produce an egg, i.e., the
transitional period from eggless to with egg is instantaneous; however, we do discuss consequences of a delay
in Section 6. This approach is motivated by the work of Shea et. al. [21], who consider several parasitoid
phases with an egg maturation delay. A kinetic diagram below describes the process,
g( · )

P1 + L −−−→ I + P0

(12)

P0 + L −−−→ P1 .

(13)

g( · )

Here, the function g( · ) (units: time−1 parasitoid−1 ) represents two means by which the parasitoids attack
hosts. The first reaction is the instantaneous rate at which the hosts are parasitized or infected by a mature
parasitoid. The second reaction represents the rate at which the hosts are devoured by an eggless parasitoid.
We assume the two rates are equal as this leads to analytic results. In the most general case, both rates
may potentially depend on the host, parasitoid, or infected host populations, which yields the following
continuous model



(17)

I(0, t) = 0,

(18)

where L(τ, t), I(τ, t), P0 (τ, t), and P1 (τ, t) are the density of host larvae; parasitized host larvae; eggless
parasitoids; and parasitoids with egg, respectively, at time τ during the vulnerable period and in year t. We
subject the system to the following initial conditions
L(0, t) = RHt ,

P0 (0, t) = 0,

P1 (0, t) = Pt .

This initial condition assumes all parasitoids emerge with an egg; however, we also consider a proportion
of the population that emerges eggless. We discuss the results of this assumption briefly in the conclusion.
These equations are integrated from τ = 0 to τ = T . Assuming each parasitized host larvae gives rise to k
adult parasitoids in the next generation, the yearly update functions are the same as before in Equations
(8) and (9). We note here that Pt = P0 (0, t) + P1 (0, t) if there is no density-dependent parasitoid mortality.
For the remainder of the paper, we suppress the dependence on τ and t for the functions L, I, P0 , and P1
for convenience.

Nicholson-Bailey with Host-Feeding

In this section, we consider the most simple case. We assume the attack rate g( · ) in Equations (12) and
(13) is constant, i.e. g = c. Our continuous time model during the vulnerable period from Equations (14) –
(17) becomes

(22)

In this case, we can solve the system for L and I explicitly (A) and our discrete update from Equations (1)
and (2) can be written as

Here, without loss of generality and for the remainder of the paper, we assume T = 1 and k = 1 since these
parameters have only a scaling effect on the results. Here, T = 1 corresponds to one vulnerable period,
which is approximately 90 days. The fixed points to this model satisfy
H∗ =

β = 0.7921.

(25)

As shown in A, this model is unstable for all R. Even if we introduce a transition rate from P0 to P1 via
an egg maturation delay, the model is still unstable. This suggests that host-feeding alone cannot establish
stability, which is in agreement to previous models [18, 19].

4

Density-dependent Host Mortality with Host-Feeding

It is shown in both phenomenological models [28, 29] and mechanistic approaches [25] that density-dependent
host mortality can stabilize discrete-time systems. To investigate stability with host-feeding, we implement a
density-dependent host mortality in Equations (14) – (17). The kinetic reactions of the system are depicted
as
g( · )

P1 + L −−−→ I + P0

(26)

P0 + L −−−→ P1

(27)

L −−−→ Death.

(28)

g( · )

g1 ( · )

The function g1 ( · ) (units: time−1 ) represents the (potentially density-dependent) host mortality rate due to
causes other than parasitism and host-feeding. We assume the attack rates are constant, g = c, implying a
linear functional response. We let the host mortality rate depend on the current amount of host larvae, i.e.,
g1 = c1 L so that density-dependent effects can act simultaneously with parasitism in the continuous-time
model. We obtain the following system for τ ∈ [0, T ],

Figure 2 shows the stability region as compared to Singh et. al.’s [25] model without host-feeding. We can
conclude from this analysis that coupling host-feeding with density-dependent host mortality yields a larger
stability region than that of the same model without host-feeding. Overall, this ensures that the host-feeding
dynamic has a stabilizing effect. We note that the comparison in Figure 2 is between the host-feeding model
presented here and the Singh et. al. [25] host-mortality model with parasitic attack rate c/2. In this sense,
the infection rates of the attacking parasitoids, P1 , of both models are comparable.

Quadratic Functional Response with Host-Feeding

Previous results show that phenomenological update functions with Type II and Type III functional responses do not stabilize the Nicholson-Bailey model [30, 31]. However, using the semi-discrete framework,
Singh et. al.√showed that a quadratic functional response yields a neutrally stable fixed point with period
2π/ arctan( R2 − 1) in the absence of host-feeding [25]. To investigate the effects of host-feeding, we consider a functional response in the attack rate of Equations (12) and (13) so that g = cL. Using Equations

(Equations (33) and (34)) as a function of the strength of density-dependent mortality to parasitism (c1 /c)

compared to the density-dependent host mortality model without host-feeding (blue line) [25].

Stability analysis (C) shows that this fixed point is stable for all R. Figure 3 illustrates a simulation for
R = 2 and c = 0.01 with and without host-feeding. We can see that without host-feeding, the populations
oscillate forever, but with host-feeding, the populations settle to a limiting value. Hence, including hostfeeding with a quadratic functional response in both the attack and infection rate stabilized the originally
neutrally stable fixed point. It should also be noted that the above host equilibrium is higher than the
corresponding quadratic functional response equilibrium in [25] with no host-feeding, by a factor of 1.23.

Discussion

In this paper, we have considered the classic host-parasitoid interaction with a host-feeding dynamic. For
simplicity and to obtain analytical results, our model ignores gut capacity and includes two states, eggless and

Figure 3: Host-feeding stabilizes the Nicholson-Bailey model with quadratic functional response.
Comparison of trajectories of the dynamic interaction given by Equations (40) – (43) (left) to Singh et. al.’s
quadratic functional response model without host-feeding [25] (right). Host-feeding with a quadratic functional response stabilizes the oscillatory behavior of Singh et. al.’s model. Simulations are run with R = 2,
c = 0.01 and initial densities are taken as 8 and 5 for the host and parasitoid population, respectively.
with egg, where eggs are produced immediately after consumption. In contrast to previous phenomenological
models, we incorporate the semi-discrete framework, which has more relevance to parasitoid populations with
one year life cycles and allows us to track the change in hosts during the vulnerable period. The preceding
analyses show that the effects of host-feeding alone cannot stabilize the classic Nicholson-Bailey model.
However, including density-dependence and a quadratic functional response coupled with the host-feeding
dynamic provides a more stabilizing effect as compared to Singh et. al.’s results [25]. For example, when
R = 2 a stable host-parasitoid equilibrium exists in a wider range of density-dependent mortality rates by
a factor of 1.41 so that for higher values of density-dependent mortality, stability still occurs. Indeed, in
this case, the host-feeding mortality rate is c1 = 0.4549 and without host-feeding, the mortality rate is
c1 = 0.3466. This means host-feeding relaxes the effect of density-dependent mortality and allows higher
rates of mortality to exist in the interaction. Furthermore, the mean host density is increased by a factor
of 1.54 in the host-parasitoid stability region. Therefore, host-feeding makes the parasitoid less efficient in
reducing the number of hosts in every generation. This may seem contradictory since host-feeding can be
viewed as an extra process that eliminates the hosts; however, the parasitoid feeds on what could have been a
viable host for reproduction in the next generation. Therefore, host-feeding may have a short term biological
control effect but ultimately it reduces the parasitoid population in the long term. In the case of a quadratic
functional response in the attack rates, Singh et. al. show that the sole equilibrium point is neutrally stable
[25]. In our model, host-feeding stabilizes this equilibrium point and also shows an increase in the mean host
density by a factor of 1.23. Hence, host-feeding brings stability to both systems by decreasing the efficiency
of the parasitoid to reproduce from year to year.
Investigating other key assumptions in our model may lead to further insight into the host-feeding dynamic. For instance, we assume parasitoids emerge into the vulnerable period each year with an egg. As
Jervis et. al. explain in [32], the adult parasitoid female emerges with eggs, and later feeding on hosts to gain
further eggs. However, do all females enter the vulnerable period with eggs? Dieckhoff et. al. and others

8

conclude that many psychological and behavioral factors including resorption and nutrition may contribute
to the specific egg load at any given time [33]. This translates to the initial condition of our continuous
model. We investigate this by considering a proportion of the starting population that is initially eggless,
i.e., P0 (0) = λPt and P1 (0) = (1 − λ)Pt . We found that as λ → 1 (poor conditions for full egg load at
adult emergence), both models are less stable. Indeed, for λ = 1/2, it can be shown that Equations (29) –
(32) yield an identical update to Singh et. al.’s less stable, host-mortality model, which is the basis for our
comparison in Figure 2.
Another investigation we considered is a density-dependent parasitoid mortality. Similar to the model
presented in Section 4, we consider a parasitoid death rate that is dependent on the total parasitoid population. In this sense, our reaction scheme is
P1 + L −
→ I + P0

c2 (P0 +P1 )

where c represents the constant attack rates by parasitoids as before and c2 is a constant. This model is
analogous to Singh et. al.’s density-dependent, parasitoid mortality model without host-feeding [25]. As
shown by Singh et. al., the non-host-feeding system is stable if c2 > c. In the host-feeding case, an analytical
solution for I(τ, t) cannot be obtained; however, numerical investigation suggests that the system is stable
for c2 values that are slightly less than c. Indeed, a trajectory with R = 2, c = 0.01, and c2 = 0.0098
yields asymptotically stable results whereas the model without host-feeding experiences diverging oscillations.
Although the stability region is expanded modestly, we can ultimately conclude that host-feeding has a
stabilizing effect in the density-dependent parasitoid mortality case.
The study by Shea et. al. [21] focused on the effects of egg limitation [34] in a host-feeding interaction.
They conclude that stability is effected by the length of latent period, i.e., the time it takes for eggs to
mature as the gut is emptied. Indeed, the longer the latent period, the longer it takes for the system to
stabilize. Among other conclusions, they also observe that stability is not effected by the number of eggs that
can be stored. In this sense, our model considers an instantaneous egg maturation process and parasitoids
carry a single egg. Because we only consider a single egg, we are able to study the system analytically and
gather the results shown above. However, to discuss the case of egg maturation, we implement a delay in
egg production into the semi-discrete framework with the following reactions
P1 + L −→ I + P0

cL

(51)

P0 + L −→ P1/2

(52)

P1/2 −→ P1 .

(53)

As compared to the original model in Section 2, we add a population, P1/2 , that is analogous to Shea
et. al.’s P01 population, which represents a parasitoid with zero eggs and a full gut. The constant rate c3
measures the transition from eggless to with egg as the parasitoid gains enough energy to effectively mature

(57)

(58)

Analytical solutions to this model are unattainable, but we confirm the destabilizing effect of the latent
period numerically. In Figure 4, we see a series of host densities using the quadratic functional response
model plotted against time with a varying delay parameter, c3 . As the rate of maturation gets slower, the
delay increases. For a critical delay the stable host-feeding, functional response model becomes unstable as
the density of hosts begins to experience diverging oscillations.
It is worthwhile to note that the characteristic time scale, T , in which the vulnerable period takes place
is approximately 90 days. The instability is caused by a delay that is approximately 0.18, which suggests
that the egg maturation delay is approximately 16 days, which is far too long for an egg to mature. As
illustrated in Figure 4, a delay value closer to 10−2 or 10−3 , which means it takes on the order of hours for
an egg to mature, yields stable results. Therefore, in this more realistic case, the system is always stable.

Figure 4: Incorporating a delay due to egg production has a destabilizing effect on the quadratic
functional response model. A series of host population density (z-axis) trajectories are plotted against
time (x-axis) for each value of egg maturation delay (y-axis). As the delay time, 1/c3 , approaches 0.18 or
approximately 16 days, the system becomes unstable. However, the system is always stable for smaller (on
the order of hours) delay time. Simulations are run using continuous system given by Equations (54) - (58)
and discrete yearly update given by Equations (8) and (9) with T = 1 and k = 1. Parameters: R = 2,
c = 0.01, H(0) = 8, and P (0) = 5.

Finally, we note that many other important consumer-resource dynamics can be implemented into the
semi-discrete framework. A necessary future step would be to investigate the effects of a larger egg load
and/or to implement a probability that a parasitoid will host feed. In this sense, an optimal stability
criterion could exist. Furthermore, we seek to investigate susceptibility of host risk to parasitoid attack, as
in [27]. Susceptibility of risk cannot stabilize the model with host-feeding alone, but could provide interesting
results with host-dependent mortality or a quadratic functional response. The generality of the semi-discrete
framework allows us to implement these changes with ease.

Using the solutions for L and I, we find the update as in Equations (23) and (24) using the definition in
Equations (8) and (9). We can analyze the resulting discrete-time model by implementing the procedure
outlined in [26]. Using a general discrete model such as
Ht+1 = F (Ht , Pt )

(66)

Pt+1 = G(Ht , Pt ),

(67)

we can perform a linear stability analysis about the fixed point (H ∗ , P ∗ ), where H ∗ and P ∗ satisfy the
following system of equations
H ∗ = F (H ∗ , P ∗ )

P = G(H , P ),

Analysis of density-dependent Mortality Model
