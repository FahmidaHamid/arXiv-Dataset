tions of our findings in the context of vaccination and
changing birth rates as well as the persistence of these
two childhood infections.

Rubella is a completely immunizing and mild infection in children. Understanding its behavior is of considerable public health importance because of Congenital Rubella Syndrome, which results from infection with rubella during early pregnancy and may
entail a variety of birth defects. The recurrent dynamics of rubella are relatively poorly resolved, and
appear to show considerable diversity globally. Here,
we investigate the behavior of a stochastic seasonally
forced susceptible-infected-recovered model to characterize the determinants of these dynamics and illustrate patterns by comparison with measles. We
perform a systematic analysis of spectra of stochastic fluctuations around stable attractors of the corresponding deterministic model and compare them
with spectra from full stochastic simulations in large
populations. This approach allows us to quantify the
effects of demographic stochasticity and to give a coherent picture of measles and rubella dynamics, explaining essential differences in the recurrent patterns
exhibited by these diseases. We discuss the implica∗ corresponding

Introduction

Rubella is a completely immunizing, directly transmitted infection, generally presenting as a mild, and
potentially even asymptomatic childhood disease [8].
As a result, rubella tends to be under-reported, and
its recurrent dynamics are fairly poorly characterized. Nevertheless, since infection during early pregnancy may cause spontaneous abortion or Congenital
Rubella Syndrome (CRS), which may entail a variety of birth defects [16], understanding the dynamics
of rubella is of considerable public health importance.
Dynamical features of rubella may alter the CRS burden via their effects on the average age of infection.
Episodic dynamics may increase the average age of
infection, as the intervals between larger outbreaks
provide the opportunity for individuals to age into
later age classes [23, 62]. Likewise, local extinction
dynamics can allow individuals to remain susceptible as they age into their childbearing years [45, 44],

resulting in the potential for a considerable CRS burden once rubella is re-introduced.
Empirically, rubella seems to be linked to either
i) annual dynamics, as in Mexico [43], Peru [45], or
parts of Africa [30, 42]; ii) spiky dynamics, as in
Canada [7] and iii) some hint at multi-annual regularity, as in Japan [60], England and Wales [4], and
various European countries [21]. In Figure 1 we show
three time series that represent the range of observed
rubella dynamics. Spectral analyses of time series
are particularly useful for understanding temporal
patterns exhibited by different data [49, 18]. The
characteristic feature of rubella spectra are an annual peak at 1 year and a multi-annual peak at 5-6
years exhibited by all data in Figure 1. Rubella also
seems to experience regular fade-outs [43], which is
of great epidemiological importance, particularly in
the context of increasing global control efforts. The
propensity for stochastic extinction is characterised
by the critical community size (CCS), below which
the infection tends to go extinct in epidemic troughs.
Analyses of dynamics in Mexico and Peru suggest a
CCS of over 106 for rubella [43, 45].
Measles provides a natural comparison for rubella,
as it is perhaps the most extensively studied of the
childhood infections, and its dynamics are very well
understood [51, 9, 10, 14, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 32,
33, 40]. Before the start of vaccination in England
and Wales, both biennial dynamics (e.g. in London)
and annual dynamics (e.g. in Liverpool) were observed [33, 20, 10, 31]. The underlying driver of this
variability has been identified as differences in birth
rate, combined with annual seasonality in transmission driven by school term times [55, 10, 33, 14].
In sub-Saharan Africa, chaotic dynamics have been
shown to result from a very high birth rate, combined
with extreme seasonal forcing [24]. Both highly irregular dynamics [51, 20] (e.g. following vaccination
in England and Wales) and triennial dynamics [39]
(e.g. in Baltimore between 1928 and 1935) have also
been reported. The spectral analyses of measles data
exhibiting the described dynamics can be found in
the now standard textbook [4]. The CCS of measles
is rather smaller than that of rubella, estimated by
Bartlett [6] to be between 2.5 × 105 − 3 × 105 for
England and Wales.

The two key ingredients underlying models of
childhood diseases like rubella and measles are i) seasonality in transmission due to schooling patterns and
ii) demographic stochasticity arising from the discrete nature of population [55, 19, 33, 48]. Although
various approaches have been used to understand the
dynamics of rubella [35, 7, 3, 17], most of the analyses have been essentially deterministic. Keeling et.
al. [35] considered a term-time forced susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) model and compared its dynamics to rubella data in Copenhagen. From this,
they concluded that the dynamics of rubella may
result from switching between two cyclic attractors
(annual and multi-annual limit cycles) of the deterministic model. Although the deterministic analysis
they present is comprehensive, there is only a limited amount of evidence to suggest that the switching will occur in contexts that include demographic
stochasticity. In particular, in this work [35] stochasticity was introduced into the model as multiplicative
noise of arbitrary amplitude instead of using, for instance, standard stochastic simulations based on the
Gillespie algorithm (for unforced models) [29] and its
extensions (for seasonally forced models) [2]. Such
simulations produce exact realisations of the stochastic process, whose full dynamics is given by the solution of the master equation as described in Section
2.2. For large populations the master equation is approximated by the deterministic model with additive
noise [52, 11].
Bauch et. al. [7] studied a term-time forced
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model
and showed that frequencies obtained from the linear
perturbation analysis of the deterministic model are
in good agreement with positions of the peaks in spectra of data records of various childhood infections.
The application of this approach to rubella data for
Canada predicted two distinct peaks at 1 and 5.1
years, close to what we see in Figure 1 (f). With the
exception of Ref. [7], where stochastic simulations for
Canada parameter values were also performed, there
has been no work on rubella using a fully stochastic
approach dealing with demographic stochasticity.
Here, we use this approach to characterize different
rubella dynamics and illustrate patterns by comparison with measles. To this end, we perform the the3

oretical analysis of spectra of stochastic fluctuations
around stable attractors of a seasonally forced deterministic SIR model and compare them with spectra
obtained from full stochastic simulations based on a
modification [2] of the algorithm by Gillespie [29].
The mathematical techniques employed in this work
have been developed for ecological and epidemiological models [41, 52, 54] and applied to model temporal patterns of measles and pertussis [53, 11, 12].
The picture that emerges to explain rubella dynamics is close to that proposed in [7] but goes beyond it
because our analysis allows us to obtain the full structure of a spectrum (as opposed to the deterministic
analysis of [7] where only frequencies of the spectral
peaks could be predicted). By introducing key spectral statistics (described below) we systematically investigate how the dominant period, amplitude and
coherence of stochastic fluctuations change across a
broad range of epidemiological parameters. We then
discuss the implications of our analysis in the context
of changing birth rates and vaccination levels, as well
as their implications for the persistence of measles
and rubella.

models if the seasonal forcing amplitude is adjusted
appropriately. We therefore focus on a sinusoidally
forced β(t) = β0 (1+ǫ cos 2πt), where β0 is the average
transmission rate and ǫ is the amplitude of seasonal
forcing, and confirm later that the dynamic temporal patterns observed in simulations of the term-time
forced model are similar. Infected individuals recover
at constant rate ν (1/ν is the average infectious period). As is common in the mathematical epidemiology literature [34, 4], we restrict our attention to the
case when birth and death rates µ (1/µ is the average
lifetime) are equal, and thus the total population size
N is constant. This allows us to reduce the number
of independent variables to two and define the state
of the system as σ = {S(t), I(t)}. From β0 , ν and µ
we can express one of the most important epidemiological parameters [34, 4], the basic reproductive ratio R0 = β0 /(ν + µ). R0 is the average number of
secondary cases caused by one infectious introduced
into a fully susceptible population; R0 will be used
throughout the text.

2.2

Theoretical Analysis

Two main approaches can be used to investigate the
dynamics of the stochastic model formulated above.
An analytical approach starts from the formulation
of the model as a master equation for the probability
of finding the system in state σ with S(t) susceptibles
and I(t) infectives at time t [63, 50, 28, 36]. Much understanding about the stochastic dynamics relevant
for recurrent epidemics can be√gained if this equation
is expanded in powers of 1/ N [63]. An extensive
discussion of this approach has already been given
at length in the literature in the context of epidemic
models, and we refer the reader to [1, 11, 52] for formal details. Here we describe only the aspects which
are important for this paper. In essence, the√method
involves the substitutions
S(t) = N s(t) + N xS (t)
√
and I(t) = N i(t) + N xI (t) in the master equation
which can be then expanded to obtain two systems
of equations [63]. At the leading order, the expansion gives rise to a set of ordinary differential equations for the mean variables, i.e. the fractions (densities) of susceptible and infected individuals, s(t) and
i(t). These equations are the same as the standard

Methods
Model

The individual-based stochastic model we explore in
this paper follows a standard seasonally forced SIR
structure [34, 4]. At any time t, it consists of a discrete population of constant size N divided into compartments of susceptible, S(t), infected, I(t), and
recovered, R(t), individuals. Susceptible individuals become infected (and infectious) at a frequency
dependent rate β(t)I(t)/N , where β(t) is a seasonally varying transmission rate. For childhood diseases, β(t) captures an increase in the number of
contacts between school children during terms with
respect to holidays [55]. Both term-time and sinusoidal forcing have been used to model these changes
[35, 11, 7, 20, 37, 61, 52]. Previous studies [7, 20]
have shown that the form of forcing is not crucial
for the essential dynamic structure (the bifurcation
diagram) of the sinusoidally and term-time forced

three characteristics, namely dominant period, amplification and coherence [1, 59], see Figure 2. We
define the dominant period of stochastic fluctuations
as inverse frequency of the maximum of the highest
stochastic peak. We also compute the total spectral
power which equals the area under a power spectrum
curve. This quantity defines the ability of the system
to sustain oscillations of all frequencies and shall be
referred to as the amplification of stochastic fluctuations. Finally, the coherence is defined as the ratio
of spectral power lying within 10% from the dominant period and the total spectral power. It serves
to measure how well-structured oscillations about the
dominant period are.
As a rule, a theoretical spectrum of unforced epidemic models (ǫ = 0) has one peak [1, 53], while it can
have several peaks of different amplitudes for ǫ > 0
[11, 52]. Away from bifurcation points of the deterministic model, one of them is usually much higher
than the others. We are not aware of any work assessing the relevance of secondary peaks to recurrent epidemic behavior seen in real data. The highest peak,
however, has been shown to be important in understanding the inter-epidemic periods observed in time
series of pertussis and measles [11, 12, 53], and is
therefore used in the definition of a spectrum’s characteristics in this paper.

deterministic SIR model with sinusoidal forcing (see
e.g. [33]). At next-to-leading order it gives rise to a
set of stochastic differential equations for fluctuations
of susceptible, xS (t), and infected, xI (t), individuals
about the mean behavior given by the deterministic
model [63]. From these equations we are able to analytically calculate power spectra of fluctuations for
susceptibles, PS (f ), and infectives, PI (f ), as functions of frequency f . We are interested in the endemic
behavior of the model so the spectra correspond to
the fluctuations about stable attractors of the deterministic model which for ǫ = 0 and ǫ > 0 are the
endemic fixed point [1] and stable limit cycles with a
period that is an integer multiple of a year [11, 52],
respectively. Further technical details relating to analytical calculations are given in the Supplementary
Material. Throughout the text we will use the words
theoretical and analytical interchangeably to refer to
spectra computed as explained in this section.
In our analysis we will focus on a spectrum PI (f ),
which for simplicity will be denoted as P (f ), and its

2.3

Simulations

We simulate the model using an extension of Gillespie’s algorithm [2, 29] which produces stochastic trajectories for {S(t), I(t)} in continuous time. These
are processed further to compute numerical spectra and test them against the theoretical prediction for P (f ). The simulation length is 500 years
and the first 50 years are discarded. In numerical work a time series
i √ xI (t) is obh for fluctuations
tained as xI (t) = I(t) − N i(t) / N , where i(t)
is the fraction of infectives averaged over many realizations of the model. From xI (t) we compute a
spectrum P (f ) using the discrete Fourier transform.
For ǫ > 0 we also present a spectrum of the entire
‘signal’ (scaled by population size N ), I(t), which
will be referred to as a full spectrum. By defini5

tion P (f ) includes only stochastic peaks, while the
full spectrum includes both deterministic peaks corresponding to a limit cycle and stochastic peaks corresponding to fluctuations about it. For either of
these spectra we will use the words simulated and
numerical interchangeably to emphasize that they
were computed using the method described in this
section. For each set of parameters, 250 simulations
are recorded and all final spectra are averaged over
those where no extinctions occurred during 500 years.
The initial conditions for susceptibles and infectives
are chosen from S(0) = round(sc N ) + U (0, 30) and
I(0) = round(ic N ) + U (0, 30), where round(·) is
rounding to the nearest integer, U is the uniform distribution and sc and ic is the fixed point (for ǫ = 0)
or a random point on the limit cycle (for ǫ > 0). The
random number generators used in the Gillespie algorithm are initialized with unrepeated seeds which
guarantees that the simulated stochastic trajectories
are all different. We have also checked that with this
choice of initial conditions all simulations converge to
a stationary state within 50 years (transient period)
or die out and so are not taken into consideration.
Both the theoretical analysis described in Section
2.2 and the numerical analysis based on simulations
described in Section 2.3 are suitable for the investigation of temporal patterns in large populations, such
as those corresponding to the time series in Figure
1, and both have advantages and limitations. The
simulations can be quite easily implemented but progressively become computationally intensive as the
population size, N , increases. In a systematic study
as we will perform here, the numerical analysis would
become very time-consuming for populations larger
than 1 million individuals. It is for those populations,
the approximate analytical spectrum, computed from
the expansion in the inverse population size, is instead expected to predict the dynamics very well (the
better the large the population size is) [11]. In the
case when the seasonality is absent, the analytical
spectrum is given by a simple formula (see the Supplementary Material) which can be readily used to
compute spectral characteristics. For the seasonally
forced model the spectrum can be written as an analytical formula too [11, 52], however the calculation is
more evolved and has to be done numerically because

no closed expression for a limit cycle can be found.
The theoretical analysis also helps to understand the
mechanisms behind the dynamics such as the change
in temporal patterns when approaching bifurcation
points of the deterministic model, that are not always clear from a visual inspection of simulated time
series. The limitations of the theory are that (a) it
does not allow us to compute the spectrum of fluctuations when the deterministic model has several
stable coexisting limit cycles for a given set of parameters and (b) in the vicinity of bifurcations the
perfect agreement with simulations is achieved for
populations larger than 1 million. Both cases will
be discussed in detail in the next section.
The data time series presented in Figure 1 correspond to large populations (Hidalgo’s population size
was about 2.1 million [43] and the other time series
are likely to correspond to even larger populations).
In the following section we perform the systematic
comparison of recurrent patterns for a large range of
realistic values of the infectious period and the basic
reproductive ratios. For the sake of computational
speed we focus on the population of 1 million of individuals and we demonstrate how the spectral analysis can be used to predict the dynamics in even larger
populations.

Results

We compare the numerical and theoretical predictions for different spectra and the three measures we
have conventionally chosen to characterise them. In
the beginning we explore a large region of parameter
space and later discuss the main findings for rubella
and measles.

the dominant period of stochastic fluctuations about
it as well as their amplification and coherence for a
range of basic reproductive ratios, R0 , and infectious
periods, 1/ν. Analytical spectra can be obtained for
any R0 > 1. In practice long numerical simulations
may not be feasible for all parameter combinations
where R0 > 1 because the system experiences frequent extinctions when the infectious period is short.
The results are presented in Figure 3, and the domain where this happens is shown in gray. In what
follows, the line separating the gray region from the
rest of the parameter space will be called the extinction boundary. We would like to stress that this concept is used for our convenience and is different from
the concept of the CCS. In particular, its location
depends on the population size, the length of time
series and the number of runs used in simulations.
For populations smaller/larger than 1 million individuals and simulation length larger/smaller than 500
years the gray region would be extended/abridged
and the extinction boundary would be shifted. In
the region of parameter space amenable to the exploration of the long-term dynamics of the model, we
observe that the structure of the spectra uncovered
by the theory is clearly visible in the simulations too.
Small systematic deviations between the two predictions are expected and occur close to the extinction
boundary. These are due to the non-Gaussian character of the fluctuations which cannot be explained
within the theory used in this study (see the Supplementary Material). To achieve the perfect agreement
with the simulations within this region, the theoretical analysis would require considering
the next or√
der corrections of the order N to the macroscopic
equations. The deviations are mainly reflected in
the broadening of a spectrum and appearance of secondary peaks. As a consequence, amplification, see
Figure 3 (e), is slightly increased (coherence, Figure 3
(f), is correspondingly decreased) in the simulations
in the area adjacent to the gray region. In addition to
these changes, an increase of the dominant period of
stochastic fluctuations in the simulated spectra may
be observed [59, 52]. This effect will be discussed
in more detail in the next section where seasonality
is included as, without seasonality, it is only barely
apparent (compare Figure 3 (a) and (d)).

3.1.2

Implications for rubella and measles
dynamics

The structure discovered in Figure 3 allows us to
derive an initial picture of the dynamics of rubella
relative to measles. Based on estimates of parameters typical of these diseases for the pre-vaccination
era [4, 35, 33, 7, 10, 43] we superimpose their approximate locations in all panels of Figure 3. The
rubella estimates are for Mexico and Canada, and
the measles estimates are for England and Wales.
For rubella the infectious period, 1/ν, is about 18
days and R0 ranges from 3.4 to 9.5 in Mexico (Figure 1 (a)) [43]. R0 in the Canadian province Ontario
ranges from 4.6 to 6.5 where the lower bound is the
estimate for the years shown in Figure 1 (c) [7]. For
measles we have taken the most frequently used values for large cities (e.g. London) in England and
Wales before vaccination, 1/ν about 2 weeks and R0
around 18.
The results so far ignore the seasonality of transmission rate and so are insufficient to explain the
patterns of measles in which it plays a pivotal role
[10, 22, 33]. However, they have important implications for understanding the dynamics of rubella. As
we shall confirm shortly, for ǫ > 0 the spectrum of
stochastic fluctuations for this disease is close in form
to that obtained for the unforced model which correctly predicts a dominant period associated to the
stochastic peak of about 5-6 years (Figure 3 (a) and
(d)) as seen from the comparison with the left peaks
in the data spectra (Figure 1). This period is similar
to the natural period of small amplitude perturbations from the endemic fixed point recovered in the
purely deterministic setting [35].
Our analysis of the stochastic model allows us to
quantify other features of fluctuations using amplification and coherence, see Figure 3 (b)-(c) and (e)-(f).
For rubella, the amplification is large indicating that
the epidemic patterns of the unforced model represent high amplitude oscillations. High coherence suggests that only a few of the frequencies involved in the
stochastic fluctuations account for most of the variance of time series. This peculiar type of dynamics
sets rubella close to the extinction boundary. Large
coherent multi-annual epidemics with troughs deeper
8

√
of 1/ N suggests that the stochastic fluctuations,
xI (t), are Gaussian (hxI (t)i = 0), see the Supplementary Material. This allows
√us to represent the full
spectrum of I(t) = N i(t) + N xI (t) as the sum of
two parts: a deterministic part that
as N 2 and
√ scales
2
a stochastic part that scales as ( N ) . The full spectra in our analysis are normalized (divided) by N as
we mention in Section 2.3. Therefore, for large populations where there is a perfect agreement between
the analytical and simulated spectra as in Figure 4
(a), the amplitude of the deterministic peak is proportional to N and the amplitude of the stochastic
peak is independent of N .
This scaling is captured even for smaller populations where the fluctuations become non-Gaussian.
For N = 106 the peak at 1 year becomes subdominant, see the solid black line in Figure 4 (b). This
indicates that the contribution of an annual component in the time series decreases with decreasing N .
As for fluctuations beyond the annual component, at
least two stochastic peaks at 5.8 and 2.9 years can be
clearly seen (solid black line). Although the theory
does not capture them in full, the agreement is still
good and, more importantly, the systematic qualitative changes can be predicted. For small populations,
the dominant period of fluctuations in simulations
is slightly increased and their variance is distributed
over a larger range of frequencies with respect to theoretical predictions [52]. This is compatible with a
general observation of the increased stochasticity and
therefore much more irregular dynamics in small populations [31, 38]. We would like to point out that the
discussed discrepancies are not attributed to sample
size effects (the number of runs used to compute the
spectrum). The latter may lead to discrepancies only
for parameters at the very border with the black line
(see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). The
example we presented here was for R0 = 4, which is
2 points away from the extinction boundary. Simulations for larger R0 show smaller deviations from
analytical calculations even for populations as small
as N = 106 (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). As mentioned before we expect these results
to be robust to the form of seasonal forcing. This is
confirmed in Figure 3 of the Supplementary Material
which shows that the simulated spectra from Figure

than in the region with higher R0 cause regular extinctions. In the next section, we discuss how these
descriptions of the stochastic dynamics of rubella are
changed in the presence of seasonality and compare
it with the dynamics of measles.

3.2.1

Seasonal forcing: ǫ > 0
Theoretical and simulation results

For ǫ > 0 the spectra are associated with stochastic fluctuations about stable attractors of the deterministic model, i.e. stable limit cycles of a period in
multiples of a year [52, 11]. The seasonally forced deterministic SIR model has a complex bifurcation diagram with regimes where multiple limit cycles may
coexist [37, 61]. For high birth rates and high seasonality regions corresponding to chaotic dynamics
are found [24]. Across most of the range of parameter space we explore here, either annual or biennial
limit cycles are present. We performed the theoretical
analysis for these attractors for different parameters
and found that the agreement between the theory
and simulations is in general excellent. Nevertheless,
small discrepancies are again expected if a limit cycle is not sufficiently stable and/or a population is
small. In particular, this happens near the extinction boundary, and is therefore relevant for rubella.
For parameters reflecting rubella, an annual limit
cycle is found in the deterministic model. To illustrate the effects of population size on simulated
spectra we show in Figure 4 an analytical spectrum
about this attractor (dashed red line) and full numerical spectra for N = 107 (solid green line) and
N = 106 (solid black line). For the larger population size, see Figure 4 (a), the simulated spectrum
exhibits two types of peaks (solid green line). There
is a dominant annual peak (corresponding to the deterministic annual cycle) and a subdominant broad
multi-annual peak (corresponding to stochastic fluctuations about it). The latter is indistinguishable
from the theoretical spectrum (dashed red and solid
green lines coincide, deviating only for values corresponding to frequencies of around 1 year). The

2.7 larger forcing amplitude.
Another situation which the analytical theory cannot fully account for is stochastic switching between different attractors of the deterministic model
[20, 35]. The computation of an analytical spectrum
about a limit cycle requires the knowledge of its geometric orbit (see Supplementary Material). In the
sinusoidally forced SIR model several stable attractors coexist in the regions of small R0 and 1/ν [37]
and spectra of stochastic fluctuations about each of
them can be obtained separately [52]. The theoretical analysis, however, does not allow us to predict
which of the attractors will be observed in simulations and what their relative contribution to the total stochastic dynamics is. Previous analysis of the
stochastic dynamics of measles and pertussis showed
that the only attractors seen in simulations of the seasonally forced SIR model (and other related models
of infectious diseases) are annual and biennial cycles
[52, 11, 53]. The stochastic switching was observed
to happen exclusively between these attractors and
only for measles. This result is, however, of limited

value to us because it is restricted to particular parameter choices, and so we cannot assume that the
switching does not happen in the broader span of the
parameter space.
Spectra from simulations contain complete information about the frequency distribution of oscillations and are thus helpful to identify switching between attractors through the presence of unexpected
peaks. Figure 5 shows simulation results for the dominant period of stochastic fluctuations, amplification
and coherence for two values of seasonality ǫ and
N = 106 . In addition to these quantities we compute the dominant period in the full spectrum which
includes both stochastic and deterministic peaks.
To examine the effect of seasonality on stochastic
fluctuations Figure 5 (a)-(f) can be directly compared
with Figure 3 (a)-(f) for the unforced model. As ǫ increases the (gray) domain with frequent extinctions
is extended and approaches the measles parameters.
For most values of R0 and 1/ν we have explored (the
colored region) the dynamics of the stochastic model
are associated with fluctuations about only few attractors. Firstly, the biennial cycle is found inside

in Figure 5 (b)-(c) and (e)-(f) which includes measles
and is absent in Figure 3 (b)-(c) and (e)-(f). The
dominant period in the full spectrum of time series
demonstrating such a behavior is at 2 years (Figure
5 (h)). Secondly, stochastic switching between annual and triennial cycles is detected in a small region
relevant for measles with low values of R0 , see an
unexpected increase of amplification in Figure 5 (e)
around R0 = 10. The spectra here have a dominant
annual peak (Figure 5 (h)) and a subdominant triennial peak (Figure 5 (d)). The amplification of oscillations associated with the latter is however much
higher than what we would expect to see for fluctuations around an annual cycle (see, e.g. Figure 5 (b)).
In Figure 6 we show the full spectrum and a typical
time series corresponding to the switching between
the annual and triennial cycles. Thirdly, in the rest of
the (colored) region which includes rubella, the spectra are similar to those of the unforced model. The
dynamics of the stochastic model here corresponds to
fluctuations about an annual cycle and we discuss it
first.

3.2.2

Implications for rubella and measles
dynamics

From Figure 5 (a) and (d) we see that for relatively
small basic reproductive ratios, typical of rubella, the
seasonality does not affect the dominant period of
stochastic fluctuations which continues to be centered
at about 5-6 years. The amplification (coherence)
is only slightly increased (decreased) as ǫ increases
(Figure 5 (b)-(c) and (e)-(f)). The full spectra of
rubella resemble that of Figure 3 with a sharp peak
at 1 year and a broad multi-annual peak.
For future discussion of the implications of vaccination and decline or increase in birth rates, it is useful
to investigate how the spectra of rubella change with
R0 . Keeping the amplitude of seasonal forcing and
infectious period of rubella fixed and increasing R0 ,
we expect the period of stochastic fluctuations as well
as their amplification to decrease. This is seen from
Figure 5 and also illustrated in Figure 7 (a) where the
full spectra for parameters close to rubella estimates
are shown. The relative contribution of multi-annual
and annual frequency components in model time series can be read from the same figure. For small R0
the fluctuations are large and the multi-annual peak

is dominant but for larger R0 it becomes subdominant and the annual peak is enhanced. The increase
of ǫ (as well as the increase of population size as discussed before in the text accompanying Figure 4) results in the enhancement of the deterministic peak
too (compare Figure 5 (g) and (h)), but does not
change the dominant period of fluctuations significantly.
For measles, there are major changes in the behavior as both coherence and amplification increase
drastically for ǫ > 0, see the newly appeared ovalshaped regions near measles parameters in Figure 5
(b)-(c) and (e)-(f). To demonstrate that this phenomenon indicates the appearance of a biennial cycle
in simulations we show in Figure 7 (b) the full spectra for fixed infectious period, 1/ν = 16 d, and a
range of R0 ∈ [22, 29]. These values of 1/ν and R0
are slightly higher than the commonly used estimates
for measles in England and Wales, e.g. 1/ν = 13 d
and R0 = 18 for London before vaccination. The
same qualitative dynamics is observed for lower values if the simulation length is shorter than 500 years
(results not shown). For R0 = 22 the spectra are typical of fluctuations about an annual limit cycle with
a deterministic peak at 1 year and a broad stochastic peak near 2 years. If R0 is increased further the

fluctuations around an annual cycle become macroscopic (the stochastic peak at 2 years becomes much
higher) smoothly turning into a biennial limit cycle.
This transition corresponds to a period doubling bifurcation in the deterministic model. A strong biennial behavior with a dominant peak at 2 years and a
secondary harmonic at 1 year is observed for example, for R0 = 26. Finally, for even larger R0 we see
a transition from biennial to an annual cycle again.
The set of transitions seen in Figure 7 (b) is typical
of measles and have been observed in related models
of infections dynamics via analytical and numerical
studies in other research [57, 56, 20, 11, 52, 61].
The seasonality would act to change the picture in
Figure 7 (b) in the following way. From the comparison of Figure 5 (g) and (h) the region of parameter
space where such a behavior is seen is expected to get
larger with increasing ǫ, in particular for ǫ > 0.1 the
period doubling transition is induced for values of R0
much smaller than in Figure 7 (b).
Previous analysis of measles data from England
and Wales and the USA has shown that transitions
in the dynamics due to an increase or decline of birth
rates as well as the introduction of vaccination are
associated with transition between annual and biennial limit cycles [20]. Using a simple mapping from

13

changes in vaccination and birth rates to effective
changes in R0 introduced in [20], our results are consistent with this view. For large communities with
very high birth rates (high R0 ) such as Liverpool
before vaccination, US cities in the period after the
Great Depression or cities in developing countries, we
would expect to be in the regime with an annual cycle
[26, 27, 20, 14]. Other large cities with smaller birth
rates such as London are in the regime with a biennial cycle [33]. The corresponding spectrum with
narrow and sharp peaks at 2 and 1 years has been
the main reason of more regular and thus more predictable patterns of measles epidemics in large cities.
The vaccination introduced in UK in 1968 lowered
R0 and induced a transition from the biennial to the
annual cycle with large stochastic fluctuations. Our
analysis thus offers an insight into the factors responsible for the shift from regular epidemics of measles
before vaccination to less irregular in the vaccine era
[51].
The last finding deserving a further comment concerns the switching between an annual and triennial
cycles found for moderate values of R0 , see Figure
5 (e) and Figure 6. This behavior may be responsible for the triennial cycles observed in Baltimore and
other US cities during the Great Depression [39] but
more thorough analysis is needed to confirm this.

Discussion

In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of
the stochastic seasonally forced SIR model based on
spectra of long time series for a large range of basic
reproductive ratios and infectious periods. For relatively low values of R0 relevant for rubella the model
predicts spectra with a stochastic multi-annual peak
at about 5-6 years and a deterministic annual peak.
Both peaks are observed in the spectra of rubella data
(Figure 1). The multi-annual peak stays largely unchanged under the introduction of seasonality (Figures 3 and 5 (a), (d)) or population size (Figure 4)
which explains its presence in time series from different locations.
Using the complementary measures, coherence and
amplification, we further studied how the structure of

stochastic fluctuations in the model changes with R0 .
By definition of these measures (Section 2) it is not
possible to estimate them from a single (data) time
series such as shown in Figure 1. We therefore cannot
compare our model’s predictions for these measures
to the data directly. However, it is still possible to
match the data and model’s full spectra (i.e. not
only the positions of the stochastic and deterministic
peaks but also their heights) given the information
about the rate of reporting and the population size.
We did this for the Mexico time series (see Figure 4
in the Supplementary Material) and obtained a very
good agreement between the model and the data. For
the Canada and Japan time series we lack the aforementioned information so these analyses yield the full
spectra with correct positions of the peaks (as discussed and shown in Section 3.2.2) but their heights
can vary depending on the reporting rate and population size used in the model.
A visual inspection of simulated time series demonstrates intriguing behavior emerging from the interaction between stochasticity and a deterministic annual
cycle. Figure 8 shows typical time series for the unforced (red dashed line) and seasonally forced (blue
solid line) cases. If ǫ = 0 the epidemic patterns represent multi-annual coherent oscillations. As ǫ is increased we find qualitatively different dynamics all of
which correspond to spectra with a multi-annual and
an annual peak. Figure 8 (a) shows an example of annual epidemics of alternating amplitudes modulated
by an oscillation of a long period corresponding to the
period of stochastic multi-annual fluctuations. This
dynamic is qualitatively similar to the multi-annual
regularity observed, for example, for rubella in Japan
(Figure 1). We also find very large outbreaks followed
by outbreaks of much lower amplitude as in Figure 8
(b). Such a behavior may be responsible for the spiky
dynamics observed in, for example, Canada (Figure
1). Note that the spikes in the data could also arise
from spatial effects such as local extinction of the disease followed by reintroduction from another region.
However, as we do not possess more resolved data it
is impossible to reach a final conclusion with regards
to this issue.
The patterns of rubella incidence in large populations are in contrast with those of measles. For the

For the parameters used in this figure many simulations go extinct quite fast, for illustration purposes we
have chosen the ones which lasted for 500 years. Parameters: N = 106 , ǫ = 0.05, µ = 0.02 1/y, (a) R0 = 5,
1/ν = 18 d (close to rubella estimates), (b) R0 = 19, 1/ν = 12 d (close to measles estimates).

latter the spectra are characterised by sharp and narrow peaks at 1 and 2 years (as opposed to the broad
multi-annual peak and a narrow peak at 1 year observed for rubella) and thus correspond to much more
regular dynamics. The transitions in measles behavior due to vaccination or change in birth rates are
associated with transitions between the annual and
biennial limit cycles of the deterministic model. In future work, it would be interesting to study stochastic
measles dynamics for higher levels of seasonal forcing
that correspond to chaos in the deterministic model
[24].
Both measles and rubella are found to be close to
the extinction boundary, and increasing the amplitude of seasonal forcing only extends the region of
parameter space with frequent extinctions. Figure
9 illustrates typical stochastic trajectories from simulation in the susceptible-infected plane from which
the spectra were computed. Interestingly, these patterns suggest that the mechanism accounting for high
extinction probability is different for rubella and
measles. For rubella, extinction occurs as a consequence of large stochastic fluctuations about a small
(and globally less stable) annual limit cycle, see Figure 9 (a). For measles, extinctions are mainly due to
the shape of a large (and globally more stable) biennial limit cycle, from which the system can be driven
to extinction by even relatively small fluctuations, see
Figure 9 (b).
We can use the framework developed to predict the
effect on persistence of an effective reduction in R0
by vaccination or declining birth rates for rubella and
measles. For measles in the biennial regime, either an
increase or a decrease of R0 can lead to fluctuations
around an annual cycle (rather than a biennial cycle) that could result in lower extinction rates and
thus higher persistence. For rubella, a reduction in
R0 will lead to larger and more coherent oscillations
that would unambiguously result in higher extinction probabilities, and thus lower persistence. Both
these outcomes merit serious consideration in a public health context: vaccination against measles can
make local elimination less likely [24]; while vaccination against rubella is likely to increase local extinction, allowing the buildup of susceptible individuals
in later age classes [43, 45], potentially leading to an

increase in the burden of Congenital Rubella Syndrome.
These conclusions point to a need for theoretical
developments towards uncovering the mechanisms of
stochastic extinctions in small population based on
the analysis of epidemic models (a thorough overview
of studies in this area aiming at understanding the
persistence of measles is given in the recent work by
Conlan et. al. [15]). In the mathematical framework
we adopted in this paper, the approach to computation of the distribution of extinction times in an unforced stochastic epidemic model was proposed some
time ago [46, 47]. The disease persistence in stochastic epidemic models can also be studied using the socalled WKB approximation but the method is only
applicable to low-dimensional and unforced models
(e. g. [13, 58]). Nevertheless, no analytical progress
can be made along the same lines for the seasonally
forced model we use here. We are aware of only one
study [5] which addressed extinction probabilities in
the periodic context using theoretical methods but
the method of [5] has a limitation because it applies
to the large population limit only. The development
of the approaches to compute the time to extinction
in seasonally-forced models will be therefore a subject
of further research.
Our focus has been on measles and rubella; however, the broad span of parameter space explored
means that our results may shed light on the dynamics of other diseases whose dynamics can be described
by a simple SIR formalism with seasonal forcing; for
example pertussis [48, 53]. Although infection with
pertussis does not confer permanent immunity the
SIR model has been shown to capture the qualitative
patterns to some extent [53]. Taking the pertussis parameters before vaccination that are well established
in independent data sources (see e.g. [4, 7], 1/ν = 22
d and R0 =17 for London and Ontario, Canada) from
Figure 5 we see that for pertussis the dominant period of stochastic fluctuations is 2 to 3 years. These
periods are in the agreement with the documented
interepidemic periods [53, 7]. We also find that the
coherence of fluctuations is very low, which is compatible with the famously irregular dynamics of pertussis. The decrease of R0 due to vaccination would
act to increase the dominant period and coherence

16

which also agrees with the observation of the shift to
more regular dynamics in the vaccine era [51].
To conclude, in this paper, we used a stochastic
framework to explain the recurrent dynamics of
rubella, particularly in comparison to measles.
Our analysis revealed that whilst both rubella and
measles are relatively close to their extinction boundary, the reasons for this are very different. Finally,
our analysis showed that, for rubella, reducing R0 by
vaccinating or a declining birth rate unambiguously
result in higher extinction probabilities, whereas, for
measles, outcomes can be more complicated; and
both these facts have public health implications.

Analytical spectrum

In this section we describe how to derive the analytical power spectrum for the stochastic
SIR model. We use the method known in the physics literature [14] as the van Kampen or
system size (total population size, N) expansion. The discussion of this standard method
in the context of compartmental epidemiological models such as the SIR model we consider
here or other related models of infectious diseases can be found in [1, 5, 10, 12, 11]. The
most recent description of the method in application to the SIRSI model is given in the
supplemental information to Ref. [11]. Refs [1, 5] outline the derivation for the SIR
model with immigration and term-time forcing. Here we briefly revise the steps of the
calculation for this model with sinusoidal forcing and without imports, see Sec. 2.1 of the
main text.
We begin by listing the transition rates, T (σ ′ |σ), between an initial state σ and a
final state σ ′ of the system, where σ = {S(t), I(t)}. S(t) and I(t) are the numbers of
susceptible and infectious individuals at time t. We consider the case of linked birth and
death events, so that N is constant and the number of recovered individuals is given by
R(t) = N − S(t) − I(t). The transition rates associated to the processes of infection,
recovery, birth and death read as follows:
λ

• Infection: S −→ I, where λ = β(t)I(t)/N is the force of infection and β(t) =
β0 (1 + ǫ cos 2πt) is a sinusoidally varying transmission rate:
T (S − 1, I + 1|S, I) = β(t)I(t)/NS(t).

(1)

ν

• Recovery: I → R, where ν is the rate of recovery:
T (S, I − 1|S, I) = νI(t).
µ

(2)

µ

• Birth and death: R → S and I → S, where µ is the rate of birth and death:

1

T (S + 1, I|S, I) = µ[N − S(t) − I(t)],

(3)

T (S + 1, I − 1|S, I) = µI(t).

Note that in some Refs. the birth and death events are not linked (e.g. [13, 10, 11]),
that is why the transition rates for these processes are different from Eqs. (3)-(4) and so
the final expressions for the spectrum too. Stochastic simulations of the system, defined
by Eqs. (1)-(4), based on the time-dependent extension [2] of Gillespie’s algorithm [7],
produce exact realisations of the stochastic process. From a sample of such simulations
we compute numerical spectra and their characteristics (amplification, coherence and the
main period), as described in the main text.
The underlying stochastic process is Markovian because the transition rates, Eqs. (1)(4), depend only on the present state and not on the previous states. The full dynamics of
this system is completely described by the master equation for the probability distribution
of having the system in state σ at time t [14]:
X

T (σ ′ |σ)P(σ, t).
T (σ|σ ′ )P(σ ′ , t) −

σ′ 6=σ
σ′ 6=σ

(5)

The approximate analytical spectrum of the fluctuations, x = {xS (t), xI (t)}, around the
densities of susceptible, s̄, and infective, ī, individuals, can be derived from the master
equation for large but finite N [14] by making the substitutions
S(t) = N s̄ +

√

NxS (t),

I(t) = N ī +

√

NxI (t)

(6)

√
into Eqs. (1)-(4), inserting these into Eq. (5) and expanding it in powers of 1/ N. This
√
leads to the equation in which terms multiplied by different powers of 1/ N appear. The
√
leading order terms are proportional to N , then the terms of order N 0 , etc. The leading
order terms give rise to the seasonally-forced deterministic SIR model for the densities of
susceptible and infective individuals:
ds̄
= µ (1 − s̄) − β(t)s̄ī,
dt
dī
= β(t)s̄ī − (ν + µ)ī.

(7)

At the next to leading order we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck equation for the probability
distribution Π(x, t) [14]:

k, j = S, I.

(8)

Since the above equation is linear its solution, Π(x, t), is a multivariate Gaussian distribution completely determined by the first and the second moments [14]. The matrices A(t)
2

and B(t) in this equation are time-dependent through s̄, ī and β(t) in the case of seasonal
forcing (ǫ > 0), and time-independent when the forcing is absent (ǫ = 0). Carrying out
the calculation shows that A(t) is the Jacobian of Eq. (7) and B(t) is the symmetric
matrix which must be obtained directly from the expansion. When ǫ = 0, we evaluate the
Jacobian and matrix B(t) at the non-trivial fixed point of Eq. (7) (with ǫ = 0), and Eq.
(8) describes the fluctuations about the endemic steady state. For ǫ > 0, the matrices
A(t) and B(t) are evaluated on the attractors of Eq. (7), which are limit cycles with
periods multiples of 1 year, and are thus periodic with the period of the cycle. In this
case Eq. (8) describes the fluctuations about the cycle, around which the expansion is
performed.
The power spectrum of the fluctuations for infectives is most readily obtained from
the Langevin equation [14] to which Eq. (8) is equivalent:
dx(t)
= A(t)x(t) + f(t),
dt

(9)

where f(t) are Gaussian white noise terms with correlator hf(t)f(t′ )i = B(t)δ(t − t′ ).
For ǫ = 0, the spectrum about the non-trivial fixed point is defined as the averaged
squared modulus of the Fourier transform of xI (t) (see e.g. [1, 11, 12]). Eq. (9) is linear
so that the calculation of the Fourier transform is straightforward. We give here the final
expression for the spectrum [11, 13]:


(µβ0 )2
2µ(β0 − ν − µ)
2
ω +
,
PI (ω) =
Zβ0
(ν + µ)2

(10)

where Z = (D − ω 2 )2 + T 2 ω 2 , D = µ(β0 − ν − µ) and T = −β0 µ/(ν + µ). The results are
shown in the units of f = ω/2π, where ω is the cyclic frequency.
For ǫ > 0, the calculations are more evolved and have to be done numerically because
no closed expression for a limit cycle can be found and because of the time-dependence
of A(t) and B(t). Recurring to the Floquet theory, the spectrum can be computed as
the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function of the fluctuations xI (t). We refer
the reader to [5, 10] for the mathematical details of this theory necessary to perform
the calculation. If several stable coexisting limit cycles are present for a given set of
parameters, the spectrum of fluctuations around each of them can be obtained separately.

Figure 1: (Color online) The average length of simulations in years for 250 runs with the
fixed length of 500 years. Below the black stairstep graph (the extinction boundary) all
simulations went extinct within 500 years. In this region the time to extinction is below
200 years. In most of the region above the black line the average length of simulations is
500 years which means that none of the simulations went extinct and that the summary
statistics of power spectra estimated from simulations are carried out on 250 runs. For
points close to the extinction boundary the statistics are calculated on a variable number
of runs. In practice, the spectra computed from as few as 30 runs are very smooth so that
the sample size effects become negligible and the discrepancies between simulations and
analytic predictions arise purely because of the breakdown of the theory [5, 10, 13]. This
is seen from, for example, Figure 4 (b) in the main text which was computed from 30 runs
(for parameters 2 points away from the extinction boundary). The sampling errors might
appear only for parameters at the very border with the black line, where running long
simulations becomes prohibitively computationally intensive. In that region few points
may stand out from the general pattern as, for example, seen from the surface plots for
amplification and coherence in Figures 3 and 5 of the main text. The same figures show
that the dominant period is not affected by sampling. Parameters: µ = 0.02 1/y, N = 106 ,
(a) ǫ = 0, (b) ǫ = 0.05 and (c) ǫ = 0.1.

Figure 3: (Color online) Full numerical spectra for the model with sinusoidal forcing (solid
green and black lines) and term-time forcing (dashed blue lines). The green and black
lines are the same as in Figure 4 of the main text. In the term-time forced simulations
we used β(t) = β0 [1 + ǫTerm(t)], where Term(t) is a periodic function that takes on
value 1 during school terms and -1 during school holidays [8, 5]. The times of terms
and holidays are taken from [8]. These define the fraction of time spent in school, f =
92/365. The basic reproductive ratio is given by R0 ≈ hβi/(ν + µ) [3, 8, 5], where
hβi = β0 [(1 + ǫ)f + (1 − ǫ)(1 − f )] is the time-averaged transmission rate. The perfect
agreement between the spectra is achieved if the term-time forcing amplitude is 2.7 times
larger than the sinusoidal forcing amplitude. This is consistent with the discussion in Ref
[13] of [6] and in the Appendix B of [4]. Parameters: µ = 0.02 1/y, R0 = 4, 1/ν = 18

Figure 4: (Color online) Comparison of the full numerical spectrum of monthly incidence
from simulations of the SIR model with seasonal forcing (yellow circles) and the spectrum
obtained from the time series for Hidalgo, Mexico (lines). The lines are repeated from
Figure 1 (d) of the main text. The simulated time series were 16 years long and sampled
every month. The error bars correspond to the standard deviation for 20 simulations. In
simulations we took N = 2100000, the reporting rate of 0.01 [9] and R0 = 4. This value
of R0 is slightly lower than that estimated in [9]. Its justification is two-fold: 1) the last
years of the data time series correspond to post-vaccination and were not included in the
analysis in [9]; 2) the lifespan, 1/µ, is likely to be longer than the one we used for all data
sets in the main text because the Mexico data is more recent. Parameters: µ = 0.02 1/y,
1/ν = 18 d, ǫ = 0.17.
