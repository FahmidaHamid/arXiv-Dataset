Abstract
Background
Previous functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in
brains of individuals having autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we studied abnormalities
in functional brain subnetworks in high-functioning individuals with ASD during free
viewing of a movie containing social cues and interactions.

Methods
Thirteen subjects with ASD and 13 matched-pair controls watched a 68 minutes movie
during functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson’s
correlation between haemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels.
From the whole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level
subnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between all subject
pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure of each subnetwork.
Additional 27 individuals with ASD from the ABIDE resting-state database were included to
test the reproducibility of the results.

Results
Between-group differences were observed in the composition of default-mode and a ventrotemporal-limbic (VTL) subnetwork. The VTL subnetwork included amygdala, striatum,
thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork
similarity between subject pairs correlated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity
measured with autism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in
the reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores.

Conclusions
Reorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the mixture of
hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the functional organization of the
VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of inter-individual similarities that co-vary with
behavioral measures across all participants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of ventrotemporal and limbic systems in autism.

Introduction
Social and communication disturbances, and restricted or repetitive behavior constitute the
core symptoms in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Reduced ability in, for example, perceiving subtle social cues and understanding the
intentions of others make social interactions and forming of social relationships challenging
to these individuals. Imaging and genetic studies characterize ASD as a manifestation of
subtle abnormalities in brain connectivity in affected individuals (1). In functional imaging,
what has been reported is a mix of findings from reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) to
increased connectivity (hyperconnectivity; see (2) for a recent review). These findings vary
according to population under investigation (developing vs. adults) and scanning paradigm
(multiple types of active tasks or resting state).
Hypoconnectivity has been observed between prefrontal and posterior brain areas (3–6) (see
(7) for a review), between other areas implicated in social cognition (8–11), as well as
between subcortical and cortical structures in the sensory and motor systems (12; 13). A
recent large scale study (14) suggested short and long distance hypoconnectivity across the
whole ASD brain, with the exception of hyperconnectivity between subcortical and cortical
structures. In other studies, hyperconnectivity has been observed locally in occipital (15),
frontal, and temporal areas (16; 17), as well as in amygdala (18). Hyperconnectivity has also
been reported in large-scale cortico-cortical (19–21), and cortico-subcortical networks (22;
23). Majority of hyperconnectivity observations have been in children or adolescents with
ASD. In adults, hyperconnectivity has been reported between posterior cingulate, temporal
lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus (6) as well as between amygdala and medial prefrontal
cortex (9).
Graph-theoretical tools have been increasingly used in the analysis of functional brain
connectivity (24). In such analysis, functional brain networks are described as consisting of
nodes corresponding to voxels or regions of interest. These nodes are connected by links
representing functional relationships as inferred from correlations of the functional activity
time series of each pair of nodes. Patterns of functional relationships can then be described at
several levels, from the properties of individual nodes and links (micro-level) to features of
the global network (macro-level), and the intermediate (mesoscopic) level of subnetworks,

3

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
also known as subgraphs, modules or communities (24; 25). Similarly as in (26), we adopted
the term “subnetwork” to stress the graph-theoretical aspect of our approach.
The overall organization of a network's links typically reflects its function. This functional
organization may not be visible at the micro level of individual nodes and links, or at the
macro level of network summary statistics. Rather, it is apparent at the mesoscopic level of
groups of densely interlinked nodes – subnetworks – that can be inferred from network
structure (27). Most ASD functional connectivity research has focused on link or node-level
differences. There are few graph theoretical ASD studies that have adopted the mesoscopic
approach, either in structural imaging (28) or in combined structural and functional imaging
at rest (29). However, whole-brain voxel-wise comparison of subnetworks of individuals with
ASD and control subjects has not been realized to date using graph-theoretical tools.
Finally, functional brain connectivity abnormalities in ASD have been studied to date with
subjects either not performing any task (i.e., “resting state”) or relatively simple tasks
targeting to activate specific brain networks. At behavioral level, however, movie clips
depicting various social cues and interactions appear to be more effective than isolated
perceptual-cognitive tasks in capturing the complex and individualistic autistic traits (30; 31).
Thus, it can be hypothesized that observing naturalistic social and emotional stimuli such as
movies reveal the underlying functional connectivity abnormalities more closely related to
everyday social interaction than resting state or the focused tasks designed to engage specific
cognitive functions (32). Supporting this view, deviations in brain function in autistic
individuals have been recently characterized during free viewing of movies (33–35).
However, there are currently no reports on possible abnormalities in the configuration of the
large-scale functional brain-network topography in ASD during free viewing of dynamic
social interactions.
Here, we specifically hypothesized that the previously reported mixed hypo- and hyperconnectivity is reflected as differences in the composition of functional subnetworks in ASD
and control subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that such differences co-vary with
autistic symptom severity. To specifically study alterations in functional subnetworks in
subjects with ASD during social cognition, we analyzed our previously published dataset (34)
where 13 high-functioning autistic and 13 matched-pair control subjects’ brain hemodynamic
activity was measured with fMRI during free viewing of a drama movie containing social
4

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
cues and interactions. Furthermore, to test the reproducibility of our findings, we also
considered 27 high functioning individuals with ASD from the ABIDE resting state dataset
(14).

Methods and Materials
Participants
The participants were 13 high functioning individuals with ASD (mean age 29 years, s.e.m.
1.7 years, range 20–41 years, all males) and 13 healthy male controls (mean age 28 years,
s.e.m. 2.1 years, range 19–47 years) – from now on labeled as “neurotypical” (NT) – matched
for age and IQ (see (34) for details). The participants with ASD filled the criteria for
Asperger syndrome based on ICD-10 criteria. To quantify where subjects of the current study
were on the autistic continuum, Autism quotient (AQ) (36), translated into Finnish (37), was
obtained from all participants. AQ significantly differed (p < 10-5) between the groups with
ranges 6–35 (NT), 17–43 (ASD) and mean values of 12.5 (2.1 s.e.m.) for NT and 30.5 (2.1
s.e.m) for ASD.

Stimulus
The stimulus was the Finnish feature film "The Match Factory Girl" (Aki Kaurismäki, 1990,
length: 68 minutes).

MRI data acquisition and preprocessing
MR imaging was performed with a Signa VH/i 3.0T scanner using a quadrature 8-channel
head coil. A total of 1980 functional volumes were obtained, each consisting of 29 gradientecho planar axial slices (thickness 4 mm, 1 mm gap between 5 slices, TE 32ms, TR 2000ms,
see (34) for details).
Preprocessing was performed with FSL using the FEAT pipeline: removal of first 29 volumes
(corresponding to movie titles), motion correction, 6 mm spatial smoothing, two steps coregistration to MNI 152 2mm template, temporal filtering at 0.01–0.08 Hz. Data were then
spatially downsampled to 6 mm isotropic voxels resulting in 5184 brain grey matter voxels.
To control for head motion confounds, motion parameters were regressed out. As all subjects
had >95% volumes under framewise displacement threshold of 0.5 mm (38) and we failed to
see any group differences in mean framewise displacement, we retained all timepoints for the
5

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
analysis. However, we used the individual mean framewise displacement values as a
nuisance variable for group level regression analysis (39). Mean brain signal was not
regressed out since doing this reduces task effects (40) and can systematically bias functional
network comparisons (41).

Network Construction
For each subject we calculated Pearson’s correlation between each pair of 6-mm isotropic
voxels (nodes) time series, resulting in a 5184 x 5184 adjacency matrix with 13 434 336
correlation coefficients (weighted links). A sparse network was obtained by constructing
minimum spanning tree (MST) followed by thresholding as in (25; 42). Network threshold
was optimized as follows. For each link density from 0.1% (strongest 13 434 links,
equivalent to retaining links with average r > 0.88) to 100% (all ~13.4 million links) the
overlap of the resulting binarized networks was calculated between subject pairs (Figure S1).
Given two graphs thresholded at density n% (i.e. retaining the strongest n% of all links), their
overlap is given by the number of common links divided by the total number of links at that
density. We selected the 2% density to focus on the maximally different networks constituted
by the edges with highest correlation (r > ~0.69), as this has been suggested to provide most
detailed parcellation of brain networks (26). This corresponds with previously accepted
criteria (25).

Computation of individual-subject functional subnetworks
We defined each functional subnetwork as a subset of nodes having a higher density of
connections than expected on the average. We used the "Louvain method" (43), which
maximizes the modularity of the detected partitions (44). We performed 100 optimization
runs for each subject and selected the partitions that gave the highest value of modularity.

Group consensus of subnetworks
To determine differences in the structure of subnetworks between ASD and NT, we first
calculated a consensus partition for each group using a meta-clustering algorithm based on
clustering clusters (45). Specifically, the set of partitions for each subject is transformed to a
hyper-graph with each subnetwork representing a hyper-edge, i.e. an edge that can connect
any number of vertices. Related hyper-edges are then grouped and collapsed together using
METIS (46). The reduced number of hyper-edges was set as equal to the maximum number
of subnetworks in any of the subject’s partitions. Each node is then assigned to the collapsed
6

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
hyper-edge where it participates most strongly. Finally, we matched the two groups
consensus clustering labels with the Hungarian algorithm (47). The partition labels of
individual subjects were also matched with the consensus subnetwork of their group. We then
measured the group consistency of each node by counting the fraction of subjects for which
the node belonged to the same subnetwork. This reflects the extent of agreement about the
subnetwork label of the node. Our procedure is quite similar to that described by AlexanderBloch and coworkers (25), however it is more general as it uses consensus partitions rather
than the single most representative subject in the population.

Labelling of functional subnetworks
Labels of subnetworks were assigned by firstly computing spatial overlap with known major
subnetworks computed for a large number of subjects as reported in (48) and (26). Spatial
overlap is defined as the Pearson’s correlation between the spatial maps as in (49). Values
and details are reported in Table S1. Finally, subnetwork labels were chosen manually and,
when possible, matched with the quantitative results from Table S1. Furthermore, nodes were
also labelled automatically by matching each node with its corresponding Automatic Atlas
Labeling (AAL) or Harvard Oxford (HO) label. We reported AAL labels for cerebral cortical
areas and HO labels for subcortical and cerebellar areas.

Intersubject similarity of subnetworks
We estimated intersubject similarity for each subnetwork using Scaled Inclusivity (SI), (50–
52). SI is a similarity measure defined for a subject pair and for a single node, as the
intersection of the subnetworks to which the node belongs, normalized by the size of each of
the two subnetworks. Since SI is computed for a single node, to consider the similarity across
subjects at subnetwork level we first considered the NT group consensus subnetworks. Next,
for a chosen subnetwork we computed the median SI of all the nodes in this subnetwork for
each subject pair. This produced an intersubject similarity matrix across all NT subjects and
individuals with ASD for the chosen subnetwork (see Figure 1 for a schematic). Finally, we
obtained the intersubject similarity matrices for each of the NT group subnetworks, where
each element describes the level of similarity for the specific subnetwork for the subject pair.
Each similarity matrix was tested for group differences by computing difference of the means
scaled by the variance (i.e. comparable to a t-value) for the within group similarity values. Pvalues were computed with permutation tests for all comparisons (1 million permutations).
Effect size for each group comparison were calculated with the MES toolbox (53) and we
7

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
reported values of Hedges’ g. We also tested each similarity matrix with a model matrix
based on the similarity of AQ scores with Mantel test with one million permutations, and the
effect size reported is the correlation coefficient between the two matrices.
Similarity between individuals’ AQ scores was computed by considering separately the five
domains of the AQ score (social skills; communication skills; imagination; attention to detail;
and attention switching/tolerance of change), so that each subject was characterized with a
five-dimensional vector of AQ subscale scores. Similarity of AQ scores (a real value between
0 and 1) was then derived from the Euclidean distance between the individual vectors (see
Lemma 8 in (54)). To control for head motion, we also computed a intersubject similarity
matrix based on mean framewise displacement as a measure of intersubject similarity of
average head motion. Code used in this paper is available at

Figure 1 – A schematic representation of the intersubject analysis framework. For two groups of
subjects (bottom layer), we can compute the similarity between each subject pair by using functional
brain data at the level of subnetworks (middle layer) or behavioral scores (top layer). These layers are
described as networks using adjacency matrices also known in this case as intersubject similarity
matrices. Two types of statistical tests can then be run: a group difference within a layer, in which the
within groups values of the adjacency matrix are compared (bottom adjacency matrix, where the group
comparison tests whether the within NT group similarity is higher than the within ASD group similarity).
The second test is the so-called Mantel test, in which the two adjacency matrices are compared with
each other by correlating the corresponding values of the top off-diagonal triangle. In the latter case,
also the between group similarity values are used making the Mantel approach more strict.

Individual microscopic network properties versus Autism Quotient score
We correlated micro-level properties of nodes and links with individual AQ scores using
Spearman correlation. Specifically, we computed the node strength as the sum of the weights
of the links connected to a node. The significance threshold was computed by permuting the
subjects’ labels (100 000 permutations). We took the 95th percentile of the max-statistics (for
negative values, it is the 5th percentile of the min-statistics) to correct for multiple
comparisons as described in (55) which yielded correlation thresholds of -0.480 and 0.459.
We then considered all the links in the individual networks with the 2% link density (~0.3
million links). We computed the Spearman correlation between individual AQ and link
weights. To control for multiple comparisons, we used the false discovery rate cluster-based
statistics as described in (56), which is an extension of the Network-based Statistics method
(57). This yielded a threshold of 0.695 for positive AQ-link weight correlations and of -0.650
for negative correlations for clusters at a corrected p < 0.05 significance. For completeness
we also computed macro-level network properties: mean link weight, clustering, average path
length and efficiency (24).

Reproducibility dataset
To test the reproducibility of the proposed intersubject similarity of movie subnetworks
predicted by the similarity of the symptoms severity, we selected 27 subjects from the
ABIDE database. Although these subjects were scanned in the resting state, we considered
the group consensus NT subnetworks from the movie watching as reference subnetworks. By
considering the reference subnetworks identified when processing social content, we test
whether the same subset of regions showed a similar disruption at subnetwork level also
during rest. Furthermore, ABIDE subjects were diagnosed using Autism Diagnostic
Interview Revised (ADI-R) (58) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (59). The
reproducibility test would then assess the validity of our findings for a different scanning
paradigm and for other diagnostic tools. Further details on ABIDE subjects selection,
preprocessing and quality control are reported in supplemental materials.

Results
Whole-brain functional connectivity analysis disclosed 12 subnetworks in the NT subjects
that are depicted with different colors on cortical surface on the left-hand side of Figure 2.
For a detailed display of each subnetwork see Figure S2 or see the fully browsable results on
NeuroVault (60) at http://neurovault.org/collections/437/. These 12 subnetworks consisted of
(from bottom to top) 1) Default-mode (DM), 2) Language (LAN), 3) Auditory (AUD), 4)
Salience (SAL) 5) Parietal, 6) Dorsal attention (DA), 7) Sensorimotor (SM), 8) Visual
primary (V1) 9) Ventro-temporal limbic (VTL) – comprising subcortical areas (amygdala,
nucleus accumbens, putamen, caudate, thalamus) as well as the anterior part of the ventral
visual pathway and part of ventro-medial prefrontal cortex 10) Precuneus 11) Cerebellum,
and 12) Visual extrastriate (VIS). While there were no significant between-group differences
at the macroscopic level tests of mean link weight, clustering, average path length and
efficiency, the alluvial diagram in the middle part of Figure 2 shows that these functional
subnetworks were reconfigured in subjects with ASD: A number of brain areas that constitute
each subnetwork in NT subjects were shifted to other subnetworks in subjects with ASD.
Significant group differences between median SI values of subject pairs were found in five of
the twelve subnetworks: DM, AUD, DA, V1, and VTL (see Table 1).
The largest group difference was in the VTL subnetwork (p = 8.402 x e-10, Hedges’ g =
1.041). In ASD subjects the extent of VTL network was reduced so that thalamus, parts of the
orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior medial-inferior temporal lobe structures were not
consistently included in the VTL subnetwork. On the other hand, temporal poles (TPO) were
included to a greater extent in the VTL subnetwork in ASD than in NT subjects. Furthermore,
inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and right amygdala formed an
independent subnetwork in ASD subjects disjoint from Putamen, Caudate and other
subcortical areas in VTL (blue ASD subnetwork, Figure 2 right).
The DM subnetwork (p = 2.041e-05, Hedges’ g = 0.653) revealed a reduction in the extent of
fronto-medial and dorso-frontal areas belonging to default mode subnetwork in ASD subjects
compared with NT controls (purple ASD subnetwork, Figure 2 right). In ASD these were
included in a larger subnetwork together with the salience subnetwork (anterior cingulate
gyrus – ACG –, anterior insula) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, yellow ASD subnetwork,
Figure 2 right).

Intersubject similarity of subnetwork structure and the AQ score
We found a statistically significant relationship between intersubject similarity of subnetwork
structure and AQ scores for the VTL subnetwork (Figure 3). Subject pairs with more similar
AQ subscale scores had more similar VTL subnetwork SI (r = 0.293, p = 0.000297),
independently of their diagnosis. When NT and ASD subjects were analyzed separately, the
similarity was larger in NT subjects (r = 0.549, p = 0.00922) compared to ASD subjects (r =
0.257, p = 0.0236; test of the difference between correlation coefficients (61) NT > ASD z =
2.168, p = 0.0301, two tailed). When considering other subnetworks, we failed to see any
other intersubject relationships between subnetwork structure and AQ. Intersubject similarity
of average head motion did not correlate with AQ similarity and did not correlate with
median SI.

Figure 3 – Mantel test showing association between VTL subnetwork structure and autistic symptoms.
Each dot is a pair of subjects showing their subnetwork similarity with median scaled inclusivity and
behavioral similarity with AQ score vectors. Pairs are coded based on within groups (blue NT, red AS)
and across groups (green). Mantel test results in the black interpolation line was performed using all
data points. Mantel test results in blue (NT) and red (ASD) interpolation lines are only for within group
values. Effect sizes are reported as correlation values and p-values were computed with permutations.

Node and link level results
Subjects with lower AQ scores exhibited significantly higher node strength in ACG and
medial prefrontal cortex (MFG), dorsal part of the frontal gyrus, TPO, precuneus, and
fusiform gyrus (FFG) (Figure 4A, peak coordinates in Table 2). Participants with higher AQ
showed higher node strength in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCG), dorsal superior frontal
gyrus (SFGdor), left IFG, and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The connections (links) between
areas that highly correlated with AQ score are reported as a summary connectivity matrix in
Figure 4B, where nodes were grouped into anatomical regions (summary for all AAL regions

13

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
in Figure S3). Low AQ was associated with higher functional connectivity across both longdistance (between frontal and parietal, frontal and occipital, as well as temporal and parietal)
and within anatomical regions (i.e., the blue squares in the main diagonal of Figure 4B) such
as the ACG, parahippocampal and superior parietal gyri. Few links were stronger for subjects
with higher AQ, for example links within MFG and SFGdor or links between FFG and
middle temporal areas.

Reproducibility: subnetwork structure at rest and ADI-R/ADOS scores
When repeating the intersubject similarity analysis for the 27 ABIDE participants, we
obtained similar results as those for the within ASD group i.e. only the VTL subnetwork
showed significant correlation between subnetwork intersubject similarity and joint ADIR/ADOS score similarity (p=0.0287) with moderate effect size (r = 0.17, Figure S4).

Discussion
We studied with fMRI how functional subnetwork structure differs in individuals with ASD
using novel graph theoretical tools applied to whole-brain functional networks without a
priori assumptions on the nodes or links. We showed that ASD is characterized with
significant reorganization of ventro-temporal-limbic and default-mode functional
subnetworks. This reorganization is coupled to a mixture of micro-level hypo- and hyperconnectivity and the mesoscopic analysis clarifies the micro-level results. Moreover, the
pattern of altered connectivity in the VTL subnetwork was associated with the degree of
autistic symptoms, both in participants with ASD and controls. Altogether our findings
suggest that aberrant organization of brain subnetworks may underlie social impairments in
ASD.

15

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism

We assumed that the drama movie drives functional network activity that cannot be easily
seen during resting state, thus allowing us to elucidate functional network differences
between NT and ASD subjects under conditions reflecting lifelike social environment. In the
NT subjects, we observed subnetworks (Figures 2 and S2) closely resembling in composition
those disclosed during resting state by other clustering methods (multidimensional clustering
in (48), infomap graph clustering in (26), independent component analysis in (49)),
supporting the validity of our analysis approach. There were, however, novel differences in
the subnetworks of NT subjects, as compared with resting state studies. The VTL
subnetwork, consisting of amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, fusiform gyrus,
inferior temporal gyrus, temporal pole, thalamus, posterior aspects of orbitofrontal cortex,
and striatum in the NT subjects is not consistently found in experiments using only a resting
state condition (for a discussion (51)). Hence, we likely found the VTL subnetwork due to the
use of a stimulus that engages social cognition and emotional processing in the subjects. This
is also in line with studies showing different and more reliable brain connectivity in
subcortical and limbic areas during task vs. resting-state conditions (62).
Notably, we observed a number of significant differences in the composition of subnetworks
between ASD and NT subjects (Figure 2). In general, participants with ASD showed lower
intersubject similarity of subnetwork structure (Table 1), likely reflecting the heterogeneity of
the disorder (1) and idiosyncratic connectivity organization in ASD (63). The most robust
group differences were observed in the VTL, DM and DA, as well as in subnetworks
comprising visual and auditory areas.
Specifically, the coherent subnetwork activity between medial-frontal, inferior temporal, and
subcortical structures is broken down in ASD subjects. Reconfiguration of the VTL
subnetwork significantly correlated with severity of autistic symptoms as indexed by subject
pairs with more similar VTL composition having similar AQ subscale scores (Figure 3). This
important finding links the brain functional subnetwork-level differences to autistic
symptoms, tentatively suggesting that the difficulties ASD individuals experience in social
cognition are associated with an abnormal VTL subnetwork composition.
Notably, intersubject similarity of AQ score and VTL structure was also significant within
the NT population (Figure 3). In the healthy population, high AQ has been reported to be
associated with lower prosocial behavior (64) and with difficulties in voice processing (65).
The connectivity between some of VTL areas is also known to be related to personality traits
(66). When considering the reproducibility test of this finding with the ABIDE dataset,
16

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
despite the differences of scanning paradigm and diagnostic tools, similarity of VTL was also
correlated with ADI-R/ADOS intersubject similarity. This result points to a shared pattern
between different autistic individuals in VTL subnetwork, independently of the presence or
absence of stimulus. Although the complex stimulus was necessary to identify the VTL
subnetwork, the resting-state result seems to be more related to the underlying structural
connections.
While VTL subnetwork differences between NT and ASD subjects have not been previously
investigated per se, these brain regions and their connectivity are known to be fundamental in
ASD for a long time (67). Regions in VTL subnetworks are part of a larger distributed
network involved in social cognition with previously reported hypo-connectivity in ASD
involving FFG, amygdala, anterior hippocampus, insula, MFG, TPO, PCG, precuneus,
Broca’s area, the posterior superior temporal sulcus and temporo-parietal junction (11; 68).
Impairment in the ‘social motivation’ circuit – amygdala, striatum and orbito-frontal cortex –
has also been hypothesized to be a core feature of ASD (69). Specifically, in the striatum,
caudate has been reported to be less connected with other subcortical areas in high
functioning ASD adults than in NT ((13); see also (70)) and recent findings in genetic studies
are showing how ASD genes have expression patterns highly specific to striatum (71). Our
results also seem to point to the striatum role in ASD subnetwork reconfiguration, separating
from amygdalas and other VTL areas (Figure 2). Finally, when considering the group
differences in DM and DA composition, we corroborated previous observations obtained
with other functional network analysis methods (5; 7; 20; 29).
In addition to the subnetwork-level differences, several micro-level (i.e., node- and linklevel) differences were observed within and between brain areas (Figure 4), consistent with
previous studies showing, for example, higher node degree for ASD in SFGdor (14) and
precuneus (72) as well as lower node degree for ASD in superior temporal gyrus and ACG
(72). In addition, differences were observed in some nodes (left IFG, FFG , PHG) that are
part of the VTL subnetwork in NT subjects. Importantly, the subnetwork-level analysis
provides information that is not available at microscopic level. For example, the subnetworklevel analysis shows how the reduced connectivity of ACG (at node level inspection) in
subjects with high AQ is due to ACG loosing its connections with the salience subnetwork
and joining into a larger subnetwork involving SFGdor, Broca's area and middle frontal gyrus
in ASD (see Figure 2). In a similar fashion, reduced connectivity in subcortical areas, FFG,
and PHG does not simply mean disconnection in ASD: While a subset of VTL nodes in ASD
isolates itself (ITG, FFG, light blue subnetwork figure 2 right hand side), striatum and
17

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
thalamus form an anomalous subnetwork with PCG, precuneus and superior parietal cortex.
Thus, simply looking at the connections each node has with other nodes (i.e., micro-level
inspection) does not reveal the bigger picture of how the pattern of connectivity of that node
is altered with respects to other nodes in the network, thus changing the functional role of the
node – as well as the fine functional properties of the subnetworks that the node abandons
and joins. To reveal and examine these effects and to resolve the micro-level mixed hypoand hyperconnectivity findings, mesoscopic-level inspection of whole-brain network
structure between NT and ASD subjects was needed.
In conclusion, our results suggest that mixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity reported
across previous ASD studies relates to specific differences in the composition of brain
functional subnetworks. Anomalies in VTL subnetwork are associated with gravity of autistic
symptoms, even within the NT group and even when considering resting state paradigm and
different diagnostic tools. Using engaging stimuli and considering all intersubject variance of
subnetworks might reveal consistent patterns also in other spectrum of disorders, like
schizophrenia, that are characterized by high heterogeneity of symptoms and are related to
neuronal connectivity dysfunction (73).

Supplemental information
ABIDE reproducibility dataset: participants’ selection and preprocessing
We selected only ASD participants from the ABIDE database since diagnostic scores were
not available for controls. We selected the same 5 datasets used in (1), that is sites with
codes: 'CALTECH' (n=19), 'CMU' (n=14), 'PITT' (n=30), 'UM_1' (n=55), 'UM_2' (n=13) for
a total of 131 ASD participants. We used version v1.0b of the ABIDE composite phenotypic
file to further restrict the ABIDE sample to match our dataset by choosing high functioning
male subjects (IQ >=100 for column FIQ, value of 1 for column SEX, a Matlab script for
filtering the ABIDE database is available at https://github.com/eglerean/hfASDmodules).
Furthermore we required that the subjects had to have valid ADI-R and ADOS scores
assessed by professional personnel by filtering subjects with positive values for columns:
'ADI_R_SOCIAL_TOTAL_A', 'ADI_R_VERBAL_TOTAL_BV', 'ADI_RRB_TOTAL_C',
'ADI_R_ONSET_TOTAL_D', 'ADI_R_RSRCH_RELIABLE', 'ADOS_MODULE',
'ADOS_TOTAL', 'ADOS_COMM', 'ADOS_SOCIAL', 'ADOS_STEREO_BEHAV',
'ADOS_RSRCH_RELIABLE'. This yielded 27 subjects with IDs: 51457, 51464, 51468,
51474, 50642, 50643, 50645, 50646, 50647, 50649, 50651, 50652, 50653, 50655, 50002,
50003, 50004, 50006, 50007, 50012, 50016, 50019, 50022, 50024, 50025, 50053, 50056. The
ranges (minimum and maximum) for the scores were ADI_R_SOCIAL_TOTAL_A: 10 – 27;
ADI_R_VERBAL_TOTAL_BV: 9 – 22; ADI_RRB_TOTAL_C: 2 – 12;
ADI_R_ONSET_TOTAL_D: 1 – 5; ADI_R_RSRCH_RELIABLE: 1 – 1; ADOS_TOTAL: 8
– 19; ADOS_COMM: 2 – 6; ADOS_SOCIAL: 5 – 13; ADOS_STEREO_BEHAV: 1 – 6;
ADOS_RSRCH_RELIABLE: 1 – 1. We then preprocessed each subject using the same
parameters as per our dataset. Since the number of time points was smaller than in our
dataset, we applied stricter motion control techniques that is: i) we used a 24 parameters
motion regression as explained in (2); ii) To avoid filtering artifacts we discarded the
beginning and end of each dataset – see (2); iii) We regressed out signals at ventricles, white
matter and cerebral spinal fluid masks as explained in (2); iv) We applied scrubbing so that
we kept 125 volumes with lowest framewise displacement for each subject. All subjects had
framewise displacement under 0.5mm, except one subject (50003) who had 6 time points
above the 0.5 mm threshold (maximum framewise displacement 0.57 mm). We decided to

1

Glerean et al. (2015) Reorganization of functional subnetworks in autism
keep this participant anyway since leaving this subject out gave similar results in the final
analysis. For the intersubject analysis, we computed normalized Euclidean distance between
the joint ADI-R an ADOS scores between each pair of subjects. To further control for head
motion during group level analysis, we also computed a intersubject similarity matrix based
on mean framewise displacement as a measure of intersubject similarity of average head
motion. Head motion similarity did not correlate with ADI-R/ADOS similarity and did not
correlate with median scaled inclusivity similarity of subnetworks.

Table S1 – This table shows the highest amount of overlap between each NT group consensus
subnetwork and previously defined subnetworks in the literature. Overlap is measured with spatial
Pearson’s correlation. The peak value between the two reference subnetworks was used in choosing
the final name of each component. Subnetworks for Yeo et al 2011: Visual, Somatomotor, Dorsal
attention, Ventral attention, Limbic, Frontoparietal, Default (Cerebellum and sub-cortical areas were not
included in Yeo et al. 2011). Subnetworks for Power et al. 2011: Sensory/somatomotor Hand,
Sensory/somatomotor Mouth, Cingulo-opercular Task Control, Auditory, Default-mode, Memory
retrieval, Visual, Fronto-parietal Task Control, Salience, Subcortical, Ventral attention, Dorsal attention,
Cerebellar. Final labels were chosen manually, after considering the overlap with the two previous
studies.

Figure S1 – We thresholded the networks by link density such that in each network, the fraction of links
with highest correlations corresponding to a given link density was retained. For each density value
(from 0.1 to 100%, with step 0.1 for densities < 1% and step 1 for densities > 1%) we calculated the link
overlap measured in fraction of links (black continuous line), the overlap within NT participants (blue
continuous line, 5% and 95% confidence area in transparent blue) and the overlap within ASD
participants (red continuous line, 5% and 95% confidence area in transparent red). We also show in the
same plot the values of average correlation thresholds corresponding to each link density (i.e. the
correlation coefficient corresponding to the last retained link). These are shown across all subjects
(dashed black line), across NT (dashed blue line, 5% and 95% confidence area in transparent blue)
and across ASD (dashed red line, 5% and 95% confidence area in transparent red). When the density
approaches 100%, the correlation threshold goes to zero and the overlap across participants is
maximal since all links are retained in the network. For small densities, the maximum of the overlap
across participants can be interpreted in terms of network backbones. The overlap across individual
networks was least for densities between 2% (equivalent to a threshold of r = ~0.69 for the average
subject) and 5% (equivalent to a threshold of r = ~0.61).

Figure S2 – A) Group consensus subnetworks for the control participants. Each subnetwork was color
coded and the color code is consistent with Figure 2 in the manuscript. B) Each group consensus
subnetwork is plotted separately by showing the level of consistency across brain areas. Median
consistency and number of nodes are reported next to each subnetwork. Labelling of subnetwork was
done quantitatively based on published subnetworks atlases, see Table S1. Full browsable maps for
NT and ASD consensus modules are available at http://neurovault.org/collections/437/.

Figure S3 – Summary connectivity matrix. The full connectivity matrix (5183x5183) was downsampled

for visualization purposes so that nodes belonging to the same anatomical regions – as defined by the

AAL atlas – were grouped together and non-null links were averaged. The legend for this figure is the

same of figure 4B, where 4B is composed of a subset of regions extracted from this figure. The full list

of abbreviations is reported in Table S2.

Figure S4 – Mantel test showing association between VTL subnetwork structure and autistic symptoms
in the ABIDE replication dataset. Each dot is a pair of ASD subjects (351 pairs for 27 subjects) showing
their VTL subnetwork similarity with median scaled inclusivity and behavioral similarity with ADI-R and
ADOS score vectors. Effect size is reported as correlation value and p-value was computed with
permutations.
