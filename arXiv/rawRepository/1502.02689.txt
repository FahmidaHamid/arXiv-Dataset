Abstract
The origin of allometric scaling of metabolic rate is a long-standing question in biology. Several models have
been proposed for explaining the origin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,
previous models only demonstrate either two important observations for the allometric scaling: the variability
of scaling exponents and predominance of 3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their
validity. In this study, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that total surface
area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two observations by combining two concepts:
the impact of cell sizes on metabolic rate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model
both theoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law although several diﬀerent
biological strategies are considered. The model validity is conﬁrmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the
model suggests the importance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric scaling. The
proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the origin of allometric scaling laws in biology,
despite several limitations of the model.

1. Introduction
Metabolic processes are essential for physiological functions and responsible for maintaining life (Takemoto,
2012; Takemoto and Oosawa, 2012). The relationship between metabolic rate B and body mass M is an important and interesting topic of scientiﬁc inquiry not only for researchers in the ﬁeld of basic biology but also
for investigators in ecology and medical research, and it is well known to approximately obey a power law
(West et al., 2002; Brown et al., 2004): B ∝ M γ . This allometry is positioned as a signiﬁcant equation in
both biology and ecology because it is useful for understanding and for estimating the energy metabolism,
lifespan (Speakman, 2005), and animal space use (Jetz et al., 2004); in particular, determination of the
scaling exponent γ is a long-standing question.
A pioneering study includes the surface law found by Rubner in the 1880s (White and Seymour, 2003);
in particular, Rubner reported that metabolic rate is proportional to M 2/3 in mammals. The Rubner’s
surface law is immediately derived when assuming simple geometric and physical principles: metabolic rate
(e.g., heat production rate) is proportional to the rate of energy (e.g., heat) dissipated through body surface
because of homeostasis.
Contrary to the prediction from the surface law, in 1932, Kleiber proposed that metabolic rate is proportional to M 3/4 (White and Seymour, 2003; West et al., 2002; Speakman, 2005; Brown et al., 2004). Further
studies have conﬁrmed that the Kleiber’s (i.e., 3/4-power) law is predominant at least in plants and animals (reviewed in (Savage et al., 2004)): this allometric scaling is observed in wide-ranging organisms (i.e.,
microorganisms to elephants).

West et al. (1997) have proposed a model (West–Brown–Enquist (WBE) model) for explaining the origin
of the 3/4-power law. This model assumes that oxygen and nutrients are transported through space-ﬁlling
fractal networks of branching tubes, in which the number of capillaries (leaves in the case of plants) is
proportional to metabolic rate. Since the WBE model clearly illustrates the Kleiber’s law, it is frequently
used for understanding the allometric scaling.
In addition to this, further studies have proposed several alternative models based on the fourth dimension
of life (West et al., 1999), optimal transport networks (Banavar et al., 1999, 2010, 2014), and quantum
metabolism (Demetrius and Tuszynski, 2010).
However, these models have several limitations (e.g., Price et al. (2012) have carefully evaluated the
WBE model using empirical data). In particular, Kozlowski and Konarzewski (2004) have questioned the
universality of the 3/4-power law. In fact, several studies suggest that the scaling exponent γ is variable. For example, White and Seymour (2003) have reported that metabolic rate is proportional to M 2/3
in mammals when considering body temperature, digestive state, and phylogeny. Darveau et al. (2002)
have illustrated that the approximately 3/4-power law results from the sum of the inﬂuences of multiple
contributors to metabolism and control (i.e., the sum of allometric relationships observed in a number of
biological processes). Reich et al. (2006) found that a linear relationship between the rate of respiratory
metabolism and body mass (i.e., B ∝ M ) is observed in plants although Enquist et al. (2007) have refuted
this conclusion. Similarly, the observed similar mean mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates across life’s major domains (Makarieva et al., 2008) also implies that B ∝ M . To explain the variability of the scaling exponent,
however, the WBE model can be modiﬁed (Price et al., 2007; Kolokotrones et al., 2010).
Of particular interest is the fact that the scaling exponent varies according to cell size (Kozlowski et al.,
2003; Starostová et al., 2009). Thus, Kozlowski et al. (2003) have proposed a simple model (Kozlowski–
Konarzewski–Gawelczyk (KKG) model) based on cell size, inspired by the fact that a large part of standard
metabolic costs are spent preserving ionic gradients on cell membranes (Szarski, 1983; Porter and Brand,
1993). This model considers an extension of the Rubner’s surface law: a hypothesis that metabolic rates
are determined by total surface area of cells rather than body surface. The KKG model can explain the
variability of the scaling exponent; especially, the exponent can fall within the range between 2/3 and 1.
For example, B ∝ M 2/3 when cell size is proportional to body size. On the other hand, B ∝ M when cell
size is independent from body size. The variability of the scaling exponent has already well known in terms
of geometry (Okie, 2013; Hirst et al., 2014).
Brown et al. (2005) have argued against the KKG model. Since cell size is almost independent from
body size, as explained by Kozlowski et al. (2003), the KKG model suggests B ∝ M , indicating that it
contradicts the predominance of the 3/4-power law (Savage et al., 2004).
Is the KKG model or a hypothesis that the total surface area determines metabolic rate not really
useful for understanding the allometric scaling law? In this study, we propose a simple geometry model, an
extended KKG model, and show approximately 3/4-power law can be also emerged from this hypothesis by
considering the concept of fractal-like (hierarchical) organization of the WBE model. This result suggests
that the hypothesis is evidently useful for understanding allometric scaling of metabolic rate. Moreover, our
model explains both validity of the scaling exponent and ubiquity of the 3/4-power laws, and it suggests
that the allometric scaling of metabolic rate is aﬀects by cell size distributions, rather than cell sizes.
2. A geometry model
The KKG model assumes that organisms consist of uniform distributed isometric cells; however, such an
assumption may be unsatisﬁed because organisms show fractal-like (hierarchical) organization, as pointed
out by West et al. (1997). Furthermore, heterogeneous distributions such as log-normal distribution are
widely observed in real-world systems (Limpert et al., 2001). Multiplicative eﬀects and hierarchical organizations are known to generate log-normal distributions (Kobayashi et al., 2011). In particular, a simple
model of fracture (Yamamoto and Yamazaki, 2013), originally proposed by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1941, is
an instructive example, and it considers hierarchical divisions of one rod. Thus, we expected that such
heterogeneous distributions of cell sizes resulting from the hierarchical organization lead to B ∝ M γ with
γ < 1 even if (mean) size of cell sizes is almost independent from body size.
2

Inspired by this fracture model, we propose a geometry model, called fractal-like cube division (FCD)
model (Fig. 1). The FCD model can be interpreted as a 3-dimensional version of the fracture model; however,
note that division processes are slightly diﬀerent between the fracture model and FCD model because of the
consideration of fractal-like (hierarchical) organization of cell sizes (e.g., tree branches are more frequently
divided than the tree trunk is).
We ﬁrst explain a simple case of the FCD model. In the simple FCD model, the cube with the length of
L (Fig. 1A) is divided according the following procedures. (i) The cube is divided into 8 cubes (Figs. 1B
and 2A). (ii) A randomly selected cube is further separated into 8 cubes (Fig. 1C). (iii) The procedure (ii)
is repeated until t = T (Fig. 1D).

probability of 1/8) is indicated by gray. (C) As in (B), the selected cube (cuboid) is separated into 8 cubes (cuboids). (D) A
state of the cube of (A) after T divisions.

However, this division rule of the simple FCD model may be by-the-numbers. To consider more ﬂexible
divisions, we next propose a general FCD model. This model considers a division of the cuboid Ch,w,d
composed of the height of h, width of w, and depth of d, in the procedure (ii). In particular, this cuboid
is divided into 8 cuboids according to the parameter p drawn from a probability distribution with the
range from 0 to 1 (e.g., uniform distribution U (0, 1)) (Fig. 2B): Cph,pw,pd , Cph,pw,(1−p)d , Cph,(1−p)w,pd ,
Cph,(1−p)w,(1−p)d , C(1−p)h,pw,pd , C(1−p)h,pw,(1−p)d , C(1−p)h,(1−p)w,pd , and C(1−p)h,(1−p)w,(1−p)d .
The general FCD model is equivalent to the simple FCD model when p = 0.5 at all times.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Analytical solutions of geometric parameters
We here provide analytical solutions of geometric properties of the simple FCD model; however, the
analytical results may be applicable to the general FCD model (see Sec. 3.2).

To obtain an analytical solution of the surface area of the simple FCD model using a mean ﬁeld approximation, we consider the time evolution of the number nD (t) of cubes with the length of (1/2)D L when
D > 0 (i.e., t > 0), where D denotes the cube division number.
nD (t) increases by 8 when a cube with the length of (1/2)D−1 L is selected with the probability of
nD−1 (t)/N (t), and it decreases by 1 with the probability of nD (t)/N (t), where N (t) denotes the total
number of cubes at time t. Thus, nD (t) is described as:
nD−1 (t) nD (t)
d
nD (t) = 8
−
,
dt
N (t)
N (t)

(1)

where N (t) = 7t + 1 ≈ 7t (when t ≫ 0).
Since n0 (t) = 0 when t > 0, the time evolution of n1 (t) is approximately written as
d
n1 (t)
n1 (t) = −
.
dt
7t

(2)

The solution of Eq. (2) with the initial condition of n1 (1) = 8 is
n1 (t) =

8

.

(3)

We solve the recursive equation Eq. (1) with this initial condition Eq. (3), and ﬁnally obtain
nD (t) =

(ln t)D−1

7D−1 t1/7 (D − 1)!

Therefore, the surface area A of the simple FCD model at time T is described as

(5)

where Dmax denotes the maximum number of cube division (i.e., the minimum cell length is (1/2)Dmax ).
Γ(x) and Γ(x, y) indicate the Euler’s gamma function and incomplete gamma function, respectively.
Assuming Dmax ≫ 0 (i.e., the minimum cell length (1/2)Dmax ≪ L), the above equation is approximately
written as
A = 12L2T 1/7 .
(6)
The relative frequency P (D) (i.e., probability distribution) of cubes with length of (1/2)D L (at time T )
is approximately equivalent to nD (T )/(7T ); thus, we have
P (D) ≃

λD−1
exp(−λ),
(D − 1)!

(7)

where λ = (8/7) ln T . Equation (7) indicates that P (D) is a Poisson distribution with the mean D of λ + 1,
suggesting a geometric parameter x of divided cubes (e.g., length l, surface area a, volume v) follows a
log-Poisson distribution because D ∝ ln x.
3.2. Numerical evaluations
To evaluate the validity of these theoretical results, we performed numerical simulations.
We ﬁrst compared the relationship between the surface area A and volume V (i.e., = L3 ) between our
theory and numerical simulation. Supposing that T = ⌊V ξ ⌋, we immediately obtain the relationship between
A and V from Eq. (6):
14+3ξ
A = 12V 21 .

The prediction from Eq. (8) is in excellent agreement with the numerical results in both cases of the
simple and general FCD models (Fig. 3). In this case, the parameter p in the general FCD model was drawn
from the uniform distribution U (0, 1) when dividing a cuboid.
We also conﬁrmed that Eq. (8) can estimate the A–V relationships numerically obtained from the general
FCD model, in which the parameter p is sampled from the beta distribution Beta(2, 2), a bell-shaped
distribution whose random variables range between 0 and 1, when separating a cuboid. The prediction
accuracy in this case is almost equal to that in the case of the uniform distribution.
These results indicate that the analytical solutions of the simple FCD model can be applicable to the
general FCD model when the parameter p is a random variable drawn from a probability distribution with
the mean of 0.5 and limited variance. The applicability of the analytical result obtained from the simple
model to the general model is due to equivalents of the central limit theory.

We next compared the predicted relative frequency (probability density) of geometric parameters with
numerical simulations. As an example of geometric parameters, we focused on cube volumes v. Using the
relational expression D = − ln(v/V )/ ln 8, the relative frequency can be estimated from Eq. (7).
As shown in Fig. 4, our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with numerical results although
the prediction accuracy becomes lower for abundant cubes with a smaller volume due to the several approximations (see Sec. 3.1). However, this limitation poses little problems when estimating the total surface
area A of the model because the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with numerical results (Fig.
3).
We also conﬁrmed that Eq. (7) can predict numerical results in both cases of cube lengths l and cube
surface areas a. Substituting the relational expression D = − ln(l/L)/ ln 2 (D = − ln(a/A0 )/ ln 4, where
A0 = 6L2 ) into Eq. (7), we can obtain the theoretical distributions of l (a).

3.3. Comparison with empirical data
Assuming B ∝ A and M ∝ V (Kozlowski et al., 2003; White and Seymour, 2003), we can discuss the
origin of the allometric scaling of metabolic rate using the FCD model; however, the parameter T needs to
be estimated by considering some constraints. We here estimate T using empirical results, and derive the
allometric scaling laws of metabolic rate.
For example, two extremely possible strategies (Savage et al., 2007) may be useful: (i) average cell (cube
or cuboid) mass hmi remains constant while average cellular metabolic rate hbi changes, or (ii) hbi remains
ﬁxed while hmi varies, where hxi indicates the mean of x. According to a previous study (Savage et al.,
2007), we assume that hmi ∝ hvi and hbi ∝ hai, where hvi and hai correspond to average cellular volume
and average cellular surface area hai, respectively. In this case, the parameter T can be estimated as follows:
In particular, the strategy (i) leads to T ∝ M because hmi ∝ V /T . Moreover, the strategy (ii) derives
T ∝ M 7/9 because hai = 12M 2/3 T 1/7 /(7T ). Therefore, we ﬁnd

M 17/21 = M 0.81 (strategy (i))
B∝
(9)
M 7/9 = M 0.78
(strategy (ii))
On the other hand, if T is proportional to the number of cells Nc because of the deﬁnition, our model
predicts Nc ∝ M and Nc ∝ M 0.78 in the case of the strategies (i) and (ii), respectively. Theoretical
predictions are in agreement with the observed results (see Table 1 in (Savage et al., 2007)).
However, since the distributions of a and v are log-normal like (Fig. 4 and Eq. (7)), it remains possible
that the estimation of T using means is unsuitable. When considering the multiplicative process such as
6

the FCD model (cell divisions), from a statistical perspective, geometric means should also be considered.
Thus, we further considered 2 strategies by modifying the strategies (i) and (ii): (iii) logarithmic mean of
cell mass hln mi remains constant while logarithmic mean of cellular metabolic rate hln bi changes, or (iv)
hln bi remains ﬁxed while hln mi varies.
hln vi and hln ai in the simple FCD model are obtained as

respectively.
Supposing that hln bi ∝ hln ai and hln mi ∝ hln vi, both strategies (iii) and (iv) lead to T ∝ M 7/(24 ln 2) .
Thus, we obtain
1
2
(12)
B ∝ M 3 + 24 ln 2 = M 0.73 (strategies (iii) & (iv)).
The scaling exponent ranges from 0.73 to 0.81 according to the biological strategies, and it may fall within
95% conﬁdential intervals of scaling exponents estimated from empirical data (e.g., see (Savage et al., 2004)).
In addition to this, this result is consistent with a conclusion, derived by Kolokotrones et al. (2010), that
the scaling exponent is around 0.8 rather than 3/4 when only focusing on mammals with higher M . This
ﬁnding may not contradict the WEB model because this model is known to show the scaling exponent of
0.81 (not 3/4) when considering ﬁnite-size corrections (Savage et al., 2008).
The relationship between the C-value (i.e., genome size) and M (Kozlowski et al., 2003) is also useful
for estimating the parameter T ; in particular, the C-value has been known to show an approximately linear
relationship with cell size (Gregory, 2001). This previous study has reported that C-value ∝ M β with
β ∈ (−0.05, 0.06); thus, it encourages an extension of the strategies (i) and (iii). In particular, we considered
the following extended strategies: (I) hmi ∝ M β and (III) hln mi ∝ β ln M . When β = 0, the strategies (I)
and (III) are equivalent to the strategies (i) and (iii), respectively.
Using the relational expression hmi ∝ V /T and Eq. (10), we can obtain the allometric relationships of
B based on the strategies (I) and (III), respectively. In particular, the scaling exponents are described as

We evaluated these theoretical predictions with the empirical data (Kozlowski et al., 2003) (Fig. 5).
For comparison, in addition, we also investigated the γ–β relationship predicted from the KKG model.
The total surface area of the KKG model is described as A ∝ hmi2/3 Nc , where Nc ∝ M/hmi. Since
lnhmi = hln mi ∝ β ln m because all cell sizes are identical (i.e., the variance of cell size is zero) in the KKG
model, the γ–β relationship, derived according to the strategies (I) and (III), is the same as follows:
γ =1−

(KKG model).

Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the empirical data, and they show higher prediction accuracy, compared with the KKG model. Our theory can also explain a negative correlation between
metabolic rate exponent γ and C-value exponent β. However, the theoretical prediction of this tendency
may be qualitative in this case. In particular, the FCD model could not quantitatively predict the γ–β
relationships for a larger β. This may be because the exponent β was estimated from average cell size (i.e.,
hmi) calculated using a few number of cells. That is, it remains possible that the assumption that hmi ∝ M β
and hln mi ∝ β ln M is not satisﬁed. A more careful examination of the theoretical predictions may require
an estimation of β using a larger number of cells in each organism.

We can also consider an extension of the strategies (ii) and (iv) according to the M -dependence of cell
size (Kozlowski et al., 2003): (II) hai ∝ M β and (IV) hln ai ∝ β ln M . Note that β does not correspond to
the C-value exponent in this case. When β = 0, the strategies (II) and (IV) are equivalent to the strategies
(ii) and (iv), respectively.
According to the relational expression hai = 12M 2/3 T 1/7 /(7T ) and Eq. (11), we ﬁnd the allometric
relationships of B based on the strategies (II) and (IV), respectively. Especially, the scaling exponents are

3.4. Ubiquity of the 3/4-power law
The strategies (I)–(IV) may be mixed among real-world living organisms. Furthermore, a huge variety of
β may be observed. What kind of distributions does the metabolic rate exponent γ follow in this situation?
To consider various possible situations, we assumed the following condition: the strategies (I)–(IV) are
uniformly observed, and β is drawn from the uniform distribution U (−1, 1).

The 40000 trials performed under this condition showed a bell-shape distribution of γ with the mean of
0.76 (the median of 0.75) (Fig. 6 A) although the strategies and β are uniformly selected.
In terms of evolutionary dynamics, it may be more realistic to consider that β follows a Gaussian-like
distribution. We also performed a similar analysis by assuming that β is sampled from a normal distribution
with the mean of 0 and variance of 1 (i.e., N (0, 1)), and again found that the metabolic rate exponent follows
a bell-shape distribution of γ with the mean of 0.76 (the median of 0.75) (Fig. 6 B).
This result implies that the 3/4-power law can be emerged from a number of diﬀerent biological strategies. Although a previous geometric perspective (Okie, 2013; Hirst et al., 2014) shows that the metabolic
rate exponent γ can be variable, it cannot answer why the 3/4-power law is universally found in nature
(Savage et al., 2004). The FCD model may answers this question.

4. Conclusion
We proposed a simple geometry model for the emergence of allometric scaling of metabolic rate. Several
analytical solutions of this model of geometric parameters were provided (see Sec. 3.1), and their validity
was conﬁrmed by numerical simulations (see Sec. 3.2).
Using this model, we discussed a possible origin of allometric scaling of metabolic rate, and concluded
that the approximately 3/4-power law can be also derived from the context of total surface area of cell sizes
by considering fractal-like (or hierarchical) organization of living organisms, contrary to criticisms (e.g.,
9

(Brown et al., 2005)). The theoretical predictions obtained from this model are in good agreement with
empirical results (see Sec. 3.3). Unlike previous models, in particular, this model can explain the important
observations: the metabolic rate exponent γ shows a central tendency of 3/4 (see Sec. 3.4) although it can
be variable (Okie, 2013; Hirst et al., 2014). These results implies that a hypothesis total surface area of cells
determines metabolic rate evidently shows promise for explaining the origin of the allometric scaling.
The FCD model was proposed inspired by the KKG model (Kozlowski et al., 2003) and WBE model
(West et al., 1997); in particular, it considers the eﬀect of cell size (KKG model) on metabolic rate and the
concept of fractal-like organization (WBE model) (see Sec. 2 for details). Although Kozlowski and Konarzewski
(2004) and Brown et al. (2005) debated over the validity of each other’s models, the FDC model suggests
that these models are complementary rather than conﬂicting. In particular, the FCD model shows a fractallike organization (heterogeneous distribution) of cells is required that when deriving the approximately
3/4-power law in the context of geometry (the KKG model).
The FCD model implies the importance of heterogeneous distributions (e.g., log-normal distributions of
cell sizes for the allometric scaling. In this paper, we could not test this hypothesis because cell size distributions are less understood. However, log-normal distributions are widely observed in nature (Limpert et al.,
2001), and several previous studies suggest that the size of red cell, which is related to metabolic rate,
approximately follows a log-normal distribution (Bell, 1985; McLaren et al., 1991). Therefore, we expect
that this hypothesis provides a new perspective for the origin of metabolic scaling. Although several studies
(Kozlowski et al., 2003; Starostová et al., 2009) have reported the importance of cell size for scaling laws of
metabolic rate, there is little study focusing on such size distributions. Our study encourages an evaluation
of the relationship between the scaling laws of metabolic rate and cell size distributions (i.e., single-cell
measurements).
However, more careful examinations may be required. The relationship between the surface area and
metabolic rate is still unclear because of several reasons. For example, a number of factors inﬂuence metabolic
rates. The rate of supply and transportation of resources within the body is considered as the fundamental
constraint on metabolic rate; however, the FCD model does not consider this constraint. Although the total
surface area of mitochondrial membranes on which the majority of ATP synthesis occurs may be correlated
with metabolic rate, it is not conformed whether such a correlation is also observed in the other types of
cells.
Even though limitations are inherent in our model due to the simplicity of the model, we believe that our
model still serves to provide intuitive and unique insights into the origin of allometric scaling in metabolic
rate.
