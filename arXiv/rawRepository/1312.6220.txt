ABSTRACT
Equipment sharing among people who inject drugs (PWID) is a key risk factor in infection by
hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed
at reducing HCV transmission in this population (such as opioid substitution therapy, needle
exchange programs or improved treatment) are difficult to evaluate using field surveys.
Ethical issues and complicated access to the PWID population make it difficult to gather
epidemiological data. In this context, mathematical modelling of HCV transmission is a
useful alternative for comparing the cost and effectiveness of various interventions. Several
models have been developed in the past few years. They are often based on strong hypotheses
concerning the population structure. This review presents compartmental and individualbased models in order to underline their strengths and limits in the context of HCV infection
among PWID. The final section discusses the main results of the papers.

INTRODUCTION
In high income countries, people who inject drugs (PWID) are the main population at risk of
infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), with a seroprevalence ranging between 15% and 90%
(1). The risk of HCV transmission is high for all drug-equipment sharing that can lead to
blood contact: injection equipment (syringes, cotton or cups (2)), straws (3) and crack pipes
(4).
Risk reduction measures have been taken to reduce HIV and HCV transmission among
PWID. These measures have focused mainly on opioid substitution treatments such as
methadone and buprenorphine, and on needle exchange programs (5). However, other
measures are possible. Indeed, some European countries have financed and launched
supervised injection and needle exchange programs in prisons (6). Moreover, the landscape of

therapy for HCV infection, where treatment was suboptimal until recently, is rapidly
changing. More efficient and tolerable treatment strategies have become available. Prevircontaining regimens – already available – have significantly increased the chances of a
sustained virologic response (SVR, i.e. undetectable levels of HCV for an extended period of
time) for patients infected with genotype 1 HCV, the most prevalent HCV genotype in
western Europe and North America among PWID (5, 7). Using these combinations, for
patients treated for the first time, the SVR rate for genotype 1 reaches 70-75% vs. 50% for
treatments with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (8-12). Other, more effective pan-genotypic
drugs that are used orally and may be prescribed for a shorter duration are at advanced stages
of development (13, 14). Given that non-viremic patients (i.e. those with a SVR) cannot
transmit the infection (15), we are now considering the use of treatment as a means of
preventing transmission of HCV in this population (« treatment as prevention »).
However, the implementation of harm reduction programs (HRP), like needle exchange
programs, and the use of these new treatments to avoid transmission imply additional costs.

3

For optimal use of available resources, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of these strategies. For this purpose, clinical studies and traditional
epidemiological studies such as historical comparisons, cohorts and/or case-control studies
encounter problems of feasibility, cost and time, especially in the PWID population, which is
difficult to reach. Mathematical modeling is an alternative; indeed, it enables an estimation of
the efficiency and cost of multiple strategies of harm reduction, screening and treatment
effects upon HCV transmission within a short period of time. The main goal of the present
article is to review mathematical models used to simulate transmission of HCV among PWID,
and to evaluate their pros and cons.
The first section briefly summarizes the corpus of papers found. The second describes
compartmental models and their properties. The third section describes individual-based
models and their properties. The final section presents results obtained and recommendations
for public health policies.

SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA
The aim of the review was to identify dynamic mathematical models used for transmission of
HCV among PWID in the literature and to evaluate their strengths and limits. Eligible studies
had to satisfy two conditions: 1) describe a dynamic mathematical model for transmission of
HCV; and 2) study a population of PWID. In accordance with Cochrane collaboration
guidelines (16), we conducted our search in the Medline database using the keywords
mathematical, model, hepatitis C and drug user and variations of these words. Our review
takes into account the bibliographies of all identified publications and includes all items found
until June 2014.

RESULTS
Of 214 articles identified, we examined 57 of them in details and keep 32 articles that fulfilled
the above criteria (see Figure 1 for details about the reasons for exclusion). We added 5
articles coming from other sources, given a total of 37 original articles (17-53). The modeled
populations were mainly from the United Kingdom (17-22, 26, 35, 36, 43, 45-48), Australia
(27, 31, 33, 43, 50, 51) and USA (30, 37-39, 49, 52). Two articles involved analyses in
developing countries: that of Durier et al. (25) studied a population of PWID in Vietnam,
while Vickerman et al. (24) examined a population of PWID in Pakistan.
The main objectives of these studies were: (i) to present a model of transmission of HCV and
provide analytical results concerning the mathematical properties of the model model (28, 3539); (ii) to evaluate the impact of HRP (on the chronic/antibody prevalence, incidence,
number of infections and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained) (21, 22, 24-26, 29, 33,
36-41, 50, 51), (iii) to compare epidemics dynamic of HCV and HIV infections (1, 23, 24,
28, 33, 40-42, 44, 45); (iv) to evaluate the impact of treatment of HCV infection on
transmission (17-19, 25, 34, 43, 49, 50) and cost (20, 43); and (v) to evaluate the impact of
potential HCV vaccination strategy (30, 32, 51). Objectives and main results of these articles
are detailed in Table 1.
Mathematical models used in the articles were divided into two categories: compartmental
models and individual-based (or agent-based) models (IBMs). The assumptions underlying
the two models and their strengths and weaknesses are presented in the following sections
In addition, we distinguished two approaches in these articles: stochastic or deterministic. In
the stochastic approach, the epidemic is considered as a chain of events (infections, recovery,
etc.) occurring at random times among individuals. Thus, this approach takes into account the
randomness of durations of the different health stages in the population. At each event, the
transition that occurs is determined by probabilities induced by the global transition rates.

5

When dealing with large populations, averaging of randomness leads to deterministic
evolutions that can be described by ordinary differential equations (54). For further
explanation about the advantages and weakness of these two approaches, the reader can refer
to (55).

COMPARTMENTAL MODELS
Description
Compartmental models were the most frequently used class of models for HCV epidemic
simulation among PWID with 31 of the 37 articles in our review (see Table 1). They
considered transmission of HCV infection at the macroscopic scale, dividing the population
into compartments corresponding to different states of the infection process: susceptible,
infectious, recovered, etc. (54, 56). Transitions from one state to another were based on rates
that could be time dependent.
For instance, Figure 2 presents a model we have recently developed for HCV transmission in
PWID (57). The population is distributed in eight compartments associated with HCV
infection and care status. Susceptible PWID are separated into two categories: new and
experienced injectors, as recently initiated injectors are at higher risk of infection (58). When
infected, they progress to acute hepatitis that can lead either to spontaneous recovery (and
PWID become susceptible again) or to undiagnosed chronic hepatitis C. Infected patients
could be diagnosed, and progress to diagnosed & non-linked to care hepatitis C stages. They
are then linked to care and lost to follow-up, or treated. When treated, patients may respond to
treatment and return to a susceptible state, or not respond and progress to a non-SVR state.
Transitions between different compartments or states are governed by annual transition rates
that may be time-dependent. For example, rates of infection depend on the current proportion
of infected PWID in the population.

6

Other published models include more compartments or less compartments according to the
objectives and available data. The most parsimonious models include only two compartments:
susceptible and infectious (28, 33, 37-39). Some authors included in their model the uncertain
immunization (59) of previously infected PWID against re-infection (18, 19, 21, 24, 35, 45).
Durier et al. differentiated symptomatic and asymptomatic acute infection (25). Esposito et al.
and Cipriano et al. added compartments to model the use of intravenous drugs as an epidemic
linked to the HCV epidemic (29). Martin et al. took into account the possibility of
imprisonment. Additional compartments can allow including substitution therapies (27, 47,
48). Finally, in order to estimate the cost of the infection or the consequences of HCV
infection on the population’s health, some authors included additional compartments of
natural history of chronic hepatitis C (20, 52).

Strengths and limits
Compartmental models have the advantage of not needing intensive computation time. In
large populations, the trajectory of the epidemics can be described by a system of ordinary
differential equations (55). However, they are based on two important hypotheses.
First, the population of a compartment is supposed to be homogeneous. The only
characteristic of an individual is the compartment in which he/she is located. Thus, parameters
that define an individual are parameters that are derived from the overall population; they can
be easily interpreted in term of epidemiology and obtained from epidemiological studies. This
is not necessarily the case for individual-based models (IBMs; see below). For example, the
infection rate represents the force of infection in the population, for which estimations are
available for HCV among PWID (58). However, PWID population is highly heterogeneous.
There is a variability of individual characteristics and behaviors, which can impact the risk of
infection by HCV or HCV-infected patients care. Indeed, the high variations of infection risk

7

among PWID are due to differences in injection frequency, numbers of syringe sharing and
number of sharing partners (60). Moreover, response rates to HCV treatment are different
according to HCV genotypes. With a pegylated interferon + ribavirin regimen, SVR is around
75 for naïve patients infected with genotypes 2 or 3; and around 50% for naïve patients
infected with genotype 1 (8-12). One may hypothesize that this could lead to the selection of

hard-to-treat genotypes, and thus to a large proportion of prevalent cases infected with
genotype 1. For simplicity, most of the published models do not differentiate genotypes; and
consider only an average duration of treatment and SVR rate in the population. Cipriano et al.
study represents an exception, differentiating genotypes 1-4 of genotypes 2-3 (52).
Nevertheless, with the availability of highly effective pan-genotypic anti-HCV regimens not
differentiating genotypes will no more be a problem. Some other characteristics are known to
impact HCV transmission or treatment success: time since first injection, as the risk of
transmission is higher in recent frequent injectors (58); substitution therapy with reduced risk
of transmission from those who receive substitution (61); gender, as the spontaneous recovery
rate is higher in women (62); HIV-HCV co-infection, associated with lower treatment success
(63), imprisonment, as a history of injection in prison increase the risk of infection (64), and
even genetic characteristics, with the IL28B polymorphism impacting the treatment response
(65). Stratification of the population into different risk groups is a solution for relaxing the
hypothesis of homogeneity of PWID (21-25, 27, 29, 36, 40-45). Vickerman et al. considered
3 levels of risk corresponding to no syringe sharing, low- and high-frequency syringe sharing
(21-23). Corson et al. structured their population by experience at injection: recent injectors
were more likely to be infected than experienced injectors (36). Zeiler et al. aimed at
estimating the impact of methadone maintenance programs and structured their population by
methadone intake (27). However, stratification of the population is equivalent to introducing
different compartments for each group, which can turn the model highly complex. For

8

example, the model in Cipriano et al. has 756 compartments (52). Such models imply to
estimate a lot of parameters, and data about PWID are often scarce due to the difficulty to
reach this population by epidemiological studies.
Secondly, the infection rate is often based upon the hypothesis that the population is totally
mixed, in the sense that each susceptible individual can potentially be infected by any
infectious person: in classical models, the infection rate per susceptible individual βI(t)
increases with the number of infected persons in the population. This hypothesis seems to be
poorly suited for describing infectious contacts with a blood-borne pathogen among PWID.
Indeed, it has been shown that PWID share their injection material with a restricted group of
injection partners. Wylie et al. found that PWID in Canada have few other PWID in their
individual network: a median of 3.5 was found for a period of 30 days (60). Brewer et al.
found a mean number of 18 injecting partners (not necessarily involving syringe/needle
sharing) during a 12-month period of presumed HCV infection among HCV-positive PWID
in Seattle (66). Sacks-Davis et al. reported, in Melbourne, a median number of 3 injection
partners/IDU, with a median duration of 3 years for a partnership, and they found that HCV
phylogeny was associated with the injection network (67). These results suggest that the
number of potential infectious contacts is restricted to a small group for each infected PWID,
which slows the transmission of the virus in the population. However, they are based on a
snapshot, and give no indication at a lifetime scale. In addition, Hahn et al. suggest that
because of the high number of injecting partners the turnover of the injecting partners may be
sufficiently high to consider that a totally mixed population is a valid hypothesis (30). An
alternative approach chosen by several authors to relax this hypothesis in compartmental
models is to include assortative mixing: they varied the mixing of the different risk groups.
Fourteen articles in the present review among the 31 compartmental models took into account
assortative mixing in the population according to risk groups (21-24, 40, 42-45, 48),

9

substitution therapies (25, 27), experience as injector (46) or age (47). However, this solution
does not enable taking into account small subgroups at the individual or community scale
(injecting partners groups), but only groups at a population scale.

INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELS
Description
In 2001, Pollack already underlined that, while a simple model enables obtaining several
important results, a homogeneous totally mixed population implies biases in the estimation of
the effectiveness of HRP and does not enable to assess effectiveness of targeting interventions
(37-39). A possibility to overcome these hypotheses is the use of individual-based models
(IBMs). IBMs simulate the patients’ trajectories at an individual level, so that we can attach to
each of them a specific set of characteristics (age, gender, alcohol consumption, frequency of
risk-taking, etc.), on which the different transition rates may depend (68-70).
For HCV epidemic modeling among PWID, only a few authors have used IBMs. Mather et al.
considered a model taking into account isolated groups of individuals with possible
immunization of individuals (51). De Vos et al. developed a model taking into account HCV
and HIV infections in which mortality and transmission of viruses were based on individual
characteristics: age, time since the first injection and time since infection (41). Hahn et al.
developed an IBM to take into account different behaviors and levels of risk exposure in the
population (30). The authors distinguished two practices at risk: risky needle sharing (RNS)
and ancillary equipment sharing (AES); the probability of infection varied based on the level
of risk exposure (corresponding to frequencies of RNS and AES) and HCV stage of the
partner (higher infectivity during acute infection). Hutchinson et al. and Rolls et al. presented
IBMs that took into account the social network of the population (see below) (26, 31, 50).

10

Modeling contact network
The network of contacts can be represented by a graph, i.e. a set of vertices representing
individuals and interconnected by a set of edges representing potentially infectious contacts
between them (see example Figure 3).
Various network models have been described in the literature ((71) and therein). The choice
of these models depends on the expected characteristics of the network. Some simple graphs
which are easily implemented have unrealistic characteristics and neglect major aspects of the
network structure, when focusing on the case of the PWID social networks. They are often
based only on individual information like the degree, i.e. the number of individuals in contact
with that person in the network. For example, the configuration model is constructed from a
chosen degree distribution (72, 73). Following this distribution, a degree is attributed to each
member of the population, by giving half-edges to each individual. The half-edges is then
connected to another at random.
Local information, for example the degree, which can be obtained relatively easily using
traditional epidemiological studies, by requesting the number of sharing partners or injection
partners for each participant. More complex models such as intersection graph models (74,
75), household graph models (76, 77) and stochastic block models (78) have been proposed to
reproduce characteristics of real networks, such as transitivity. The transitivity reflects the
preferential association of two persons if they have a common relationship: two individuals
are more likely to be friends if they have a common friend. In terms of the graph, this results
in a large number of triangles in the network. These models are difficult to calibrate due to the
need for information on the global topography of the network. We may have to determine the
size of the communities and the probability of connection between individuals of the same
group and between individuals of different groups, etc. We cannot obtain such information
through traditional studies: independent sampling of the individuals only provides information

11

about the neighborhood of the participants. To catch the global topography of the network, we
must use specific methodologies such as chain-referral sampling used by Friedman et al. to
study the network of a population of PWID in New York City (79). In such surveys, new
participants are recruited by previous participants among partners. The final result is a
subgraph of the population’s network.
In the case of HCV in PWID, Hutchinson et al. used a configuration model (26). The number
of partners for the PWID was generated by a geometric probability distribution with
parameter 𝑝 ∈ (0,1), i.e. 𝑃(𝑋𝑖 = 𝑘) = (1 − 𝑝)𝑘−1 𝑝. This distribution was suggested by data
on the distribution of degree in a population of PWID in Glasgow at the beginning of the 90’s.
Rolls et al. applied an IBM to a real network of 258 PWID in Melbourne, obtained by using
chain-referral sampling (31). This approach enabled the authors to obtain a very realistic
network structure (80). However, it was limited to a small sample due to the difficulty in
tracing the contact network of different PWID. They compared results of their model with the
empirical network and with a fully connected network (equivalent to the totally mixed
hypothesis of compartmental models). They found that time to infection was shorter in a fully
connected network, indicating that the structure of the network highly impacts output in HCV
transmission. In more recent papers, they calibrated an exponential random graph model
(ERGM) on these data (50, 80). ERGMs are statistical models aiming to reproduce some
characteristics of the initial network (i.e.; the number of edges, isolates, triangles, in
particular). The ERGM used by Rolls et al. is based on the research of homophily in the
network, which is the preferential attachment between PWID due to their similar
characteristics: location, gender, age, frequency of drug use. This is an important part of the
social component of the network.
Another research question in PWID is the dynamic of the network. Indeed, in a real
population of PWID, the contact pattern may change: the identities of the different sharing

12

partners change over time as relationships between PWID evolve (26). A static network
model, with identities of sharing partners fixed over time, may miss a crucial aspect of the
social network. It may be a good approximation if contacts change at a slow rate relative to
epidemic dynamics. Inversely, if contacts change quickly relatively to the spread of the
disease, then the dynamic effects cannot be neglected (81). For HIV epidemics on sexual
contact network the dynamic of the sexual partnership network has been proved to impact the
epidemic trajectory (82-84). For HCV in PWID, it is an open question. Only Hutchinson et al.
have used a dynamic network model with a turnover of sharing partners for each individual
each year. Two variants of turnover were tested: a turnover totally at random, and a turnover
with some stability in injecting partners groups, with few differences between the results in
these two settings. These dynamic models are however not be supported by data.
From another point of view, Hahn et al. suggest that because of a high dynamic in the contact
network, the population can be modelled as static and totally mixed (30). There is no evidence
about this affirmation because it is only supported by the high number of reported injecting
partners.
Further investigations should be conducted to clarify the necessity of dynamic models. Of
note Sacks-Davis et al. reported, in Melbourne, a median number of 3 injection partners/IDU,
with a median duration of 3 years for a partnership (67), suggesting a relative stability of the
network.

MAIN RESULTS OF THE REVIEWED PAPERS
The objectives of articles on HCV transmission among PWID are numerous. However,
important results consistently emerge.

13

Vaccination
The potential effect of a vaccination against HCV was evaluated in three articles. Mather et
al. showed that even immunizing half the population with a vaccine which has an 80%
efficacy slows the spread of the infection in an Australian PWID population (51). For Dontwi
et al., potential vaccination must be carried out early and should cover a large portion of the
population (>80%) so as to reduce the force of infection (32). Hahn et al. tested scenarios that
specifically target certain individuals in a population of PWID in USA (30). They found that
vaccination is most effective when it targets high-risk individuals (with more frequent risktaking) without taking into account serological status, or when targeting HCV-seronegative
persons.

Harm reduction policies
The first author to take an interest in estimating the impact of harm reduction by a model was
Pollack, who examined a needle exchange program in USA (37-39). His results suggested
that, while such a program may have an impact and could potentially eradicate the infection,
the cost quickly becomes prohibitive for highly transmissible infections like HCV (>250.000$
per averted infection). However, he suggested that the association of this program with a
methadone maintenance therapy strategy would reduce transmission of the virus in the
population and, as a consequence, decrease the cost of needle exchange programs. He stated
that, for HCV, a combination of different strategies is necessary to impact HCV transmission
(39). However, he underlined that the absence of heterogeneous behavior and the totallymixed hypothesis could impact the results. Vickerman et al. also found that widespread
sustained coverage of syringe exchange in the population (reduction > 40% of needle/syringe
sharing) is necessary in order to obtain a significant reduction in prevalence after 10 years in
Rawalpindi, Pakistan (24).

14

Hutchinson et al. estimated the impact of HRP on HCV transmission, by varying the
percentage of PWID who had shared per year, the mean number of needle/sharing partners
and the percentage of injecting episodes (26). For the period 1988-2000, they estimated that
4,500 infections would have been prevented in Glasgow with HRP. They also found that
reducing the mean number of partners to one (versus between 2 and 3 partners in the baseline
scenario) might prevent 5,300 infections during the same period (with this measure alone).
Moreover, wide and sustained decrease of needle/syringe sharing would be necessary to have
a similar impact on transmission (5,200 infections prevented): only 11% to 20% of PWID
should be able to share a needle/syringe during that period.
Some authors suggested that the target of these interventions could be optimized. Vickerman
et al. suggested targeting recent injectors not reached by HRP and not already infected in UK
to reduce syringe sharing in this particular part of the population (21). They found that a
significant reduction in seroprevalence could occur among recent PWID (<4 years) with a
reduction in sharing frequency <25%, although among experienced PWID (>8 years), similar
results would only occur with a reduction >50%. Similarly, Corson et al. suggested that
interventions in Scotland are most efficient during the first 5 years of the injecting career (36).
Esposito et al. in Italy showed a delay of one year between the peak of drug use and the peak
of prevalence for HCV, suggesting also that interventions should occur early during the
injecting drug career to impact HCV transmission (29).
In the context of limited resources, De Vos et al. suggested that PWID at low risk (i.e. less
frequent syringe sharing) should be targets for HRP (aiming at reducing syringe sharing rate)
so as to maximize their impact (41). They questioned also whether the decrease in HCV
incidence in Amsterdam since 1990 was related to HRP. They found that realistic results with
their model could only be obtained in the presence of HRP, but demographic changes in the
PWID population primarily explained the decrease.

15

Impact of harm reduction strategies on HIV and HCV infection among PWID
The impact of HRP upon HIV transmission is much stronger than upon HCV transmission
(33). Coutin et al. and Pollack showed that the higher infectivity of HCV compared to HIV
implied that greater effort is needed to significantly impact HCV transmission in their model
(28, 39). Vickerman et al. estimated that reducing the injection risk by 30% would result in a
reduction in the incidence/seroprevalence of 50%/28% for HIV and 37%/10% for HCV after
5 years in a population of PWID in UK (23). De Vos et al. found similar results (42). Murray
et al. estimated the number of annual injection partners below which infections by material
sharing were less likely to occur than infections by other sources to be 17 partners/year for
HIV and 3 partners/year for HCV in an Australian setting (33). They estimated the actual
number of partner to be intermediate (≈6), which explains the success obtained against HIV
and more questionable results for HCV. Bayoumi et al. estimated the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of supervised injection facilities in Vancouver (53). Their results suggest
between $14 and $18 million gained and between 920 and 1175 life-years saved after 10
years. However, the authors underlined that the cost saving is mainly due to HIV infections
averted.

HCV treatment
The impact of HCV treatment on transmission is considered to be effective despite the risk of
reinfection (17, 19, 25, 34). Some authors recommended specific targets and application
modalities. Zeiler et al. studied the impact of HCV treatment in Australia, taking into account
methadone maintenance therapy (27). The main concern of that paper was to determine the
optimal distribution of treatment in the population. The results suggested treating active
PWID rather than PWID under methadone maintenance therapy, with the hypothesis of equal

16

adherence to treatment in the two groups. The conclusion would be reversed only if adherence
by active PWID was <44% of that of PWID under methadone maintenance therapy. Also in
Australia, Hellard et al. found that even a modest annual rate of treatment (25/1,000 PWID)
could have an impact on long-term HCV chronic prevalence (50% decrease after 30
years)(34). Martin et al. found similar results for the United Kingdom: for a baseline chronic
prevalence of 20%, 40% and 60%, an annual treatment rate of 10/1,000 PWID would achieve
a reduction in chronic prevalence of 31%, 13% and 7%, respectively after 10 years (19).
Durier et al., in Vietnam (with few HRP) found similar results (25). They estimated a strategy
of treatment as prevention, and suggested treating early (during the first year) to avoid a
maximum of infections.
Martin et al. estimated the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in the United Kingdom (20).
Their results showed that treating active PWID and ex- or non-PWID was cost-effective, but
for a chronic prevalence below 60%; treating active PWID was more cost-effective because of
avoided re-infection. This result remained valid even with a SVR rate in active PWID that
was 50% lower than that of ex- or non-PWID (which may reflect lower adherence to
treatment).
Martin et al. estimated the impact of a coming direct-acting antiviral, with treatment of
shorter duration and with a higher tolerability (43). They compared efficiency and cost in
three different geographic settings: Edinburgh, Melbourne and Vancouver. The study showed
that halving the chronic prevalence after 15 years would be extremely expensive, particularly
in Melbourne and Vancouver (around $50 million) where the chronic prevalence is high.
Finally, in Australia, Rolls et al. targeted infected individual for treatment initiation according
to their neighbors on the social network, with strategies including random treatment delivery,
priority by node degree, treatment of the primary contacts of infected nodes, treatment of
primary and secondary contacts of infected nodes, and treatment of treatment of the primary

17

contact of uninfected nodes (50). They found that strategies including the treatment of
primary and secondary contacts of some infected PWID randomly chosen for treatment
(“ring” treatment) are the most effective strategies for a similar number of treatment starts.

CONCLUSION
To date, several different models have been used to study transmission of HCV among PWID.
Most of them were built to answer a specific question taking into account only the
characteristics of PWID that pertained to that question, and thus averaging the non-relevant
characteristics. Specific points seem to recurrently emerge in these articles: the long-term
effects of HRP and HCV treatment on HCV prevalence, the advantage of specifically
targeting more risky PWID (recent injectors, active PWID or PWID not on methadone
maintenance therapy), and the importance of implementing these measures early (at the
beginning of the injecting career for HRP, and at the beginning of chronic infection for
treatment). However, more general models are needed to compare a combination of different
strategies of risk reduction (needle exchange programs, substitution therapy), screening and
treatment (efficacy of new treatments). Mathematical modeling can enable evaluating the cost
associated with those different strategies and guiding optimal resource allocation.
Most models are compartmental and rely on strong assumptions. An individual-based
approach could be an interesting alternative allowing, for example, to estimate the impact of
strategies based on PWID characteristics and social networks. The most advanced works on
this topic are that of Rolls et al. showing that treatment strategies based on the social network
have more impact on transmission than a random treatment distribution (50). But such studies
still few in numbers. One of the main difficulties lies in the lack of data for first calibrating
and next to be used in the model. Data are difficult to obtain in particular regarding the risk of
HCV transmission during an exchange, the frequency of material sharing, and social networks

18

and their dynamics over time. As pointed out by Kretzschmar et al., the construction of such
models therefore requires multidisciplinary collaboration that includes clinical (transmission
risk, treatment efficacy), epidemiological (current state of infection, screening, treatment),
mathematical (modeling) and sociological (social network characteristics among PWID)
components (85).

different scenarios of immunization

Individual-based model / stochastic

The rate of spread of HCV trough an PWID
population is not really sensitive to the initial
prevalence, but it is sensitive to the proportion of
groups members with whom the individual has
contact and the probability of infection per contact
with an infective (encouraging HRP)

Compartmental model/

- Analytic results (steady state
analysis)

Modest interventions (reduce incidence by a third)
are only effective for hard-to-transmit infections
(like HIV), while for HCV, with a high
prevalence, only a massive program will have an
impact. Moreover, for a high-prevalence setting,
the impact will occur over the long term

Pollack (38)

USA

To assess the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of a syringe
exchange program

Compartmental model/
deterministic differential equations
- Analytic results (steady-state
analysis)

The syringe exchange program is effective and
cost-effective when R0 is low (2.9 for HIV), but
becomes less effective when R0 is high (6.9 for
HCV) and cost become prohibitive (>250.000$
per averted infection), which is more realistic (in
short-term analysis). This is necessary to combine
syringe exchange program with intervention
aimed at decreasing the R0, such as the
methadone maintenance program.

Compartmental model/

The short-term incidence underestimates the
effectiveness of a program of long-term syringe
exchange if the steady-state prevalence, in the
absence of intervention, is below 50%.
Conversely, if it is over 50%, the short-term
incidence overestimates effectiveness.

Incidence is the best indicator of impact (delays
are shorter than for prevalence)
The estimated seroprevalence in the 90s was
lower than currently observed. This result can be
corrected by increasing viremia during the acute
phase, which could confirm the higher rate of
viremia during that period.
Current public health messages (not sharing
needles) are inadequate for HCV (but effective for
HIV). The authors propose encouraging PWID to
share with only a small group of trusted persons
(tested negative) and predict that by reducing the
mean number of partners to one (vs. 2-3) 5,300
infections could have been avoided between 1988
and 2000

Compartmental model/

Current public health interventions aiming at

impact. There is therefore a need to work on new
injectors which is currently not the case.

Moreover, we have to target all PWID, not just
those with a high frequency of syringe sharing

If a reduction of needle sharing is the only effet of

saved after 10 years.
When adding an increase use of safe injection
pratices and increased referral to methadone
maintenance treatment: incremental net savings of
almost $18 million and 1175 life-years saved after
10 years.
The cost saving is mainly due to HIV infections
averted.

To assess the impact of
vaccinations (at different levels of

Individual-based model / stochastic

27

Several scenarios of vaccination were tested:
- randomly vaccinate the population
- vaccinate individuals with more risky behavior
- vaccinate individuals seronegative for HCV
(sero-targeting)
The third scenario is the most effective, followed
by the second, suggesting that random vaccination
is not a good strategy.

HCV among PWID

Compartmental model/

HRP are most effective toward HIV if used in a
high-risk group, but they must be used in a lowrisk group to impact HCV. High-risk individuals
are already infected by HCV (the prevalence is
high) so it is too late to prevent their infection,
while this is not the case for HIV (low prevalence
due to lower force of infection)

To halve the chronic prevalence of HCV within

Individual-based model on a

/ stochastic approach

The number of contacts and injecting frequency
play a key role in reducing the time before
primary infection
The spontaneous clearance has a local effect (i.e.
around the concerning individual) on infection
risk and the total number of spontaneous recovery
has a global effect on the incidence of both
primary and re-infection rates
Network-based treatment strategies that chose
PWID and treat their contact are most effective
and allow to reduce the number of treatment
needed to achieve a desired effect

PWID (57). The model takes into account infectious status, acute hepatitis C, testing, linkage
to care, loss to follow-up and treatment. We distinguished recently initiated PWID and
experienced PWID because of their different risk of infection (58). Reinfections are possible,
but no retreatment is allowed in the model. Transitions occur between the compartments at
transition rates that can depend on time: the infection rate depends on the current number of
infected PWID in the population.
