Abstract
An increasing number of dissident voices claim that the standard neo-Darwinian view of
genes as ‘leaders’ and phenotypes as ‘followers’ during the process of adaptive evolution
should be turned on its head. This idea is older than the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of
inheritance and has been given several names before its final ‘Baldwin effect’ label. A
condition for this effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic
plasticity or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a population. This gives the
necessary time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and the adaptive trait can be
eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential paper published in the late 1980s showed
the Baldwin effect to happen in computer simulations, and claimed that it was crucial to

1

solve a difficult adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various
disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary emergence of
high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language almost hopeless. Here, we
use analytical and computational approaches to show that a standard population genetics
treatment can easily crack what the scientific community has granted as an unsolvable
adaptive problem without learning. The Baldwin effect is once again in need of convincing
theoretical foundations.

Keywords: evolutionary search, genetic algorithm, learning, the Baldwin effect, speed of
evolution.

Introduction
What role does the Baldwin effect play in evolution? By Baldwin effect  term

coined by Simpson [1]  we refer to a turn-of-the-twentieth-century idea [2,3,4] cogently
described by Maynard Smith [5, p. 761] as follows: “If individuals vary genetically in their
capacity to learn, or to adapt developmentally, then those most able to adapt will leave most
descendants, and the genes responsible will increase in frequency. In a fixed environment,
when the best thing to learn remains constant, this can lead to the genetic determination of a
character that, in earlier generations, had to be acquired afresh in each generation”. The
Baldwin effect involves two transitions [6,7]: the first has to do with the evolutionary value
of phenotypic plasticity, or some particular form of plasticity such as learning; the second
with the ‘genetic accommodation’ (i.e., evolution in response to both genetically based and
environmentally induced novel traits [8,9,10]) of the learned trait. We use genetic
accommodation instead of the more familiar term ‘genetic assimilation’ coined by
Waddington [11] because this last term should not be equated to the Baldwin effect [10, see
also 9, pp. 153-154].
Some towering figures in the Modern Synthesis  expression borrowed from the title
of Julian Huxley’s [12] book  were either indulgent with the theoretical plausibility of the
Baldwin effect [1] or utterly hostile towards it, recommending to discard this concept
altogether [13,14]. This advice is followed suit by several influential textbooks in
evolutionary biology [15,16,17] that do not even mention Baldwin at all. However, although

2

at present there appears to be no clear empirical evidence for Baldwin effects, several authors
have called for a radical revision of the consensus view and argued that much evolution
involves genetic accommodation [9,18,19,20; but see 21]. The current tension among
evolutionary biologists [22] is unmatched by evolutionary computationalists [6,23,24] and
scholars in others disciplines (typically evolutionary psychologists and cognitive scientists
[25]), who invoke the Baldwin effect as a major evolutionary force that could have led to the
emergence of mind [26,27,28] and to modern language [29,30,31,32]. As Yamauchi [33, p.
3] put it, “the Baldwin effect is particularly appealing because … It may provide a natural
Darwinian account for language evolution: It is an especially popular idea among linguists
that language evolution is somehow saltational. This leads them to conclude neo-Darwinian
theories are ‘incompetent’ for accounting for language evolution” (our addition in italics).
(Neo-Darwinism is used here to describe the Modern Synthesis version of Darwinism.)
Much of the recent ‘excitement’ with the Baldwin effect stems from a seminal paper
published by computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton and Steven Nowlan in the late 1980s [34],
which has been cited 1,081 times (Google Scholar) to date. They developed a computational
model combining a genetic algorithm with learning by trial and error in a sexual population
of chromosomes (the ‘organisms’) that were initially segregating at L  20 loci with three
alleles each: 1, 0, and ? . This chromosome determines the connectivity of a neural network:
allele 1 at a given locus indicates that a particular connection exists whereas allele 0 at that
locus indicates that it does not. The question marks are plastic alleles that allow the organism
to set (or not) the connection at the end of a learning period. The neural network has only one
correct configuration of connections and the task the organisms had to solve was to find this
configuration out of the 2L  106 possible configurations. We can assume without loss of
generality that the right answer is the chromosome with all alleles1; i.e., a fully connected
neural network. The catch is that any other configuration provides no information
whatsoever about where the correct answer might be. In such problems, there is no better
way to search than by exhaustively sampling the entire combinatorial space; a situation
termed a ‘needle-in-the-haystack’ problem. In other words, there is no efficient algorithm
that can find the fitness maximum unless we introduce some ‘trick’; namely, to somehow
smooth the spiked fitness landscape through phenotypic plasticity [35]. Hinton and Nowlan
[34] assumed that each organism could try up to a maximum of G  1,000 random guesses

3

for the settings of the ? states; these alleles define the ‘plastic genome’. The organisms were
also given the ability to recognize whether they have found the correct settings after g  G
learning trials and, in such a case, stop guessing (see below for details). Therefore, those
organisms that were relatively fast at learning the correct configuration of alleles enjoyed a
fitness advantage and produced more offspring. In the long run (well before 50 generations in
the simulation performed by Hinton and Nowlan [34]), natural selection redesigned the
genotypes in the population and the correct alleles 1 increased in frequency. Nonetheless,
they did not take over and undecided alleles ? remained segregating at relatively high
frequency because in the end organisms were able to learn quickly and, therefore, there was
not much selective pressure to fix the ‘innately correct’ fitter alleles.
The scenario in Hinton and Nowlan [34] showed (i) that the Baldwin effect can be
observed in silico, and (ii) that learning can dramatically accelerate adaptive evolution in a
flat fitness landscape with a single isolated peak; what Ancel [36, p. 307] characterized as
the “Baldwin expediting effect”. Maynard Smith [5, p. 762] explained this effect by making
a simple contrast with a population where organisms do not learn: “In a sexual population of
1,000 with initial allele frequencies of 0.5, a fit individual would arise about once in 1,000
generations … Mating would disrupt the optimum genotype, however, and its offspring
would have lost the adaptation. In effect, a sexual population would never evolve the correct
settings… (or does so excessively slowly)”. Actually, “the problem was never solved by an
evolutionary search without learning” [34, p. 497]. Conversely, Maynard Smith [5] claimed
that in the absence of learning a large asexual population would include optimal individuals
and the correct settings would soon be established by selection.
The first claim about non-learning sexual organisms has been taken for granted,
whereas the second claim concerning asexual organisms was analytically investigated by
Fontanari and Meir [37] to answer the question: how soon is ‘soon’? Using their recursion
equation (3.1) to analyze the evolution of correct alleles, the answer is that it would take
more than 3,000 generations for the population to evolve the correct settings with initial
allele frequencies 0.5 and no mutation. Therefore, the conclusion seems to be fairly clear: in
the single-peaked fitness landscape assumed by Hinton and Nowlan [34] learning has a
drastic effect on evolution.

4

Here, we show that this conclusion is generally incorrect and requires careful
considerations. The heart of the problem was also pointed out by Maynard Smith [5] and
relates to the strong positive epistasis in Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] scenario. This epistasis
generates, in turn, strong positive associations between the correct alleles in the non-learning
organisms that can greatly accelerate evolution (Appendix A). The former solution of more
than 3,000 generations for the asexual population to evolve the correct settings is likely to be
a gross overestimate as Fontanari and Meir [37] ignored the generation of linkage
disequilibrium due to directional selection. The remainder of the paper is organized as
follows. First, we discuss Hinton and Nowlan [34] model in more detail as it will make the
reason for our skepticism about what they have really demonstrated very clear. Second, we
derive the exact recursion equations for the asexual case and show that evolution is indeed
quite fast in this case. Third, challenging the conventional wisdom we show that a finite
population of sexual organisms that do not learn does evolve the correct settings, and
estimate the probability of fixation and mean time to fixation of the correct genotype as a
function of population size N and chromosome length L . Finally, we summarize our results
and point out the misconceptions generated by the computer simulations in Hinton and
Nowlan [34].

The simulation by Hinton and Nowlan
Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] basic idea was to show that a haploid sexual population of

organisms with plasticity (learning ability) will evolve towards an optimal phenotype in
fewer generations than a population of organisms that do not learn. They assumed that the
L  20 loci code for neural connections and alleles 1 specify innately correct connections,

alleles 0 innately incorrect connections, and alleles ? guessable (plastic) connections
containing a switch that can be on (right) or off (wrong). Learning consists of giving each
individual up to a maximum of G  1,000 random combinations of switch settings (with
equal probability for on and off) on every trial. Those individuals that have a 0 allele at any
locus will never produce the right connectivity of the neural network. On the other hand, if
the combination of switch settings and the genetically specified connections produce the
good net (i.e., a fully connected neural network) after g  G trials the individual stops
guessing.

5

Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] evolutionary algorithm performs two operations. First,
each organism  i  1, 2,..., N  is evaluated according to fitness, which determines the mating
probability and offspring production according to the following fitness function
wi  1 

 L  1 g
G

1

,

where g   G  g  is the number of trials remaining after the correct configuration of
connections has been found. This fitness function is central to Hinton and Nowlan [34]
argument. It indirectly smoothes out the landscape and the organisms nearby the attraction
zone of the peak (i.e., those chromosomes with ones and question marks that can be correctly
set after g  G trials) enjoy increased fitness. The basal fitness is wi  1 if the organism
never gets the right answer after G trials, and has a maximum value of wi  L for an
organism that already has all its connections innately specified.
Second, the crossover operation picks one point 1  m  L  1 at random from each
of parents’ chromosomes to form one offspring chromosome by taking all alleles from the
first parent up to the crossover point, and all alleles from the second parent beyond the
crossover point. Although not explicitly stated in Hinton and Nowlan [34], taking m  L  1
as the upper bound guarantees that the offspring will always be a recombinant string. None
of the learning is passed on to children, which inherit the same allelic configuration their
parents had at the different loci. Hinton and Nowlan [34] simulation is replicated in Fig. 1.

Evolution without learning in an asexual population: equations for the

deterministic limit
We will consider the case where learning is absent in order to show that the neglect
of linkage disequilibrium [37] greatly overestimates the number of generations required for
the correct genotype to become preponderant in the population. In fact, in an infinite asexual
population the prevalence of the correct genotype takes place so rapidly that the effect of
learning (if any) is not significant.
In this case the genotypes are binary strings of size L because without learning there
is no difference between alleles 0 and ? . There are 2 L different such strings and we denote
their frequencies in the infinite population at generation
t by Y  t  , with   1,


, 2L .

Without loss of generality, we will assume that the correct genotype, i.e. the string

1, 1,

, 1 , corresponds to  1. Recalling that the fitness w of all genotypes but the

correct one is set to the baseline value w1  1 , and that the fitness of the correct genotype is
set to w1  L , we 
obtain

Y1  t   1 

 2

1 for which Y1  t   1 (see Appendix B). This expression allows us to

estimate the number of generations needed for Y1  t  to attain some arbitrary value close to
one. Solving Eq.  2  for t yields

 3

from which we see that t increases with the logarithm of Y1  0  rather than with a negative
power of Y1  0  as in the case where linkage disequilibrium is neglected [37].
At this stage, it is instructive for comparative purposes with previous work [37] to
derive the corresponding equations for the evolution of an infinite asexual population
ignoring the generation of linkage disequilibrium. This is important because the paper by
Fontanari and Meir [37] has routinely been cited as giving additional support for the benefits
of learning, without realizing that their analytical treatment was inappropriate for an asexual

7

population. Their derivation begins with the expression for the frequency of alleles 1 at
generation t  1 , which we denote by p  t  1 , given that one knows the genotype
frequencies at generation t ; i.e.,
1
p  t  1 

were P stands for the number of alleles 1 in string  . Ignoring linkage disequilibrium
transforms this equation into an autonomous recursion equation for p  t  by assuming that

Y  t    p  t 

P

1  p  t 

L P

for all  and t . This means that the abundance of a

genotype depends only on the number of alleles 1 and not on the specific location of those
alleles in the string. In addition, those abundances are completely determined by the global
frequency of alleles 1 in the population according to the previous expression. It is as if all
genotypes were disassembled and then reassembled again at random following a procedure
akin to Wilson’s [38]; that is, Fontanari and Meir [37] wrongly assumed L  1 recombination
points. In fact, the reason why ignoring linkage disequilibrium is an inappropriate and
uncontrolled approximation in this context, as well as its connection to group selection, was
already pointed out in Alves et al. [39, section V]. This neglect gives the following incorrect
recursion equation [37; equation (3.1) ignoring mutation] after inserting Y  t  into Eq.  4 
p  t  1 

p  t    L  1  p  t  
1   L  1  p  t  

 5

For L  20 and p  0   0.25 (i.e., Y1  0   1 240 ), the numerical solution of Eq.  5  shows
that it takes about t  5.2 108 generations to reach the regime where 1  p  t   106 . This
was the reason why Fontanari and Meir [37] concluded that learning has a drastic effect on
evolution in Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] scenario. However, using the correct Eq.  3 we find
that only t  15 generations are sufficient to reach that regime.
In the same vein than Hinton and Nowlan [34] we did not include mutation in the
foregoing treatment, but it is easy to derive exact recursion equations for the non-learning
asexual case assuming mutation (Appendix C). In summary, the preponderance of the correct

8

genotype in an infinite asexual population without learning takes place extremely fast so the
effect of learning, if any, is not significant in this case.

4.

Evolution without learning in a sexual population
Having shown that Maynard Smith’s [5, p.762] remark that a non-learning asexual

population of “many millions would breed true, and the correct settings would soon be
established by selection” (‘soon’ is indeed very soon) is essentially correct, what of a sexual
population? In this context, it is interesting to recall what Hinton and Nowlan [34, p. 497]
wrote (our emphasis in italics): “The same problem was never solved by an evolutionary
search without learning. This was not a surprising result; the problem was selected to be
extremely difficult for an evolutionary search, which relies on the exploitation of small coadapted sets of alleles to provide a better than random search of the space… To preserve the
co-adaptation from generation to generation it is necessary for each good genotype, on
average, to give rise to at least one good descendant in the next generation. If the dispersal of
complex co-adaptations due to mating causes each good genotype to have less than one
expected good descendant in the next generation, the co-adaptation will not spread, even if it
is discovered many times. In our example, the expected number of good immediate
descendants of a good genotype is below 1 without learning and above 1 with learning.”
This conclusion was also repeated by Maynard Smith [5, p. 762]: “In a sexual population of
1,000 with initial allele frequencies of 0.5, a fit individual would arise about once in 1,000
generations … Mating would disrupt the optimum genotype, however, and its offspring
would have lost the adaptation. In effect, a sexual population would never evolve the correct
settings”.
Here, we show that this conclusion is incorrect. Some hints why this is mistaken can
be gained from Eq.  5  , which basically assumes that all genotypes are disassembled and
then reassembled again at random following a procedure akin to Wilson’s [38] trait group
selection framework; namely, Eq.  5  assumes L  1 recombination points as already stated
above. This wrong assumption notwithstanding, an eventual fixation of the correct string is
attained [37].
A more straightforward demonstration that a non-learning sexual population can find
the solution to the ‘needle-in-the-haystack’ problem is obtained by showing that the expected

9

number of good immediate descendants of a good genotype is actually above 1, in stark
contrast to Hinton and Nowlan’s claim quoted before. In fact, assuming that the correct all 1s
string is present in the population at some generation, we can easily calculate the distribution
of the number of good offspring it generates by mating with a random string following the
crossover operation in Hinton and Nowlan [34]. As indicated above, the single offspring of
each mating is generated by randomly choosing a crossover point and taking all alleles from
the first parent up to the crossover point, and from the second parent beyond the crossover
point. Let us take the all 1s string as the first parent and pick another string at random from
the 2 L possible strings as the second parent. The probability that the resulting offspring is an
all 1s string is simply




,

1  L 1  
i
L  1 i 1 2 L  1  2  L  1

 6

since all crossover points are equiprobable and the second parent must be all 1s after the
crossover point. Therefore, the mean number of good offspring produced in L mates (the
fitness of the correct genotype is w1  L ) is L  L L 1 1 and so the “expected number
of good immediate descendants of a good genotype” is not below one as claimed [34; see
also 5] but, quite the opposite, the good genotype is expected to increase exponentially once

it has appeared in the population. This is shown in Fig. 2 using the same parameter values
(population size N  1,000 , chromosome length L  20 ) than Hinton and Nowlan [34] with
allele frequencies 0.5, where the correct genotype went to fixation in 14 out of 100
independent runs (14%) in less than 150 generations. Obviously, the former conclusion that a
non-learning sexual population would never evolve the correct settings is just plain wrong.

population. The
simulations follow

scheme with the
exception that each
organism is a binary
string. Initial
frequencies were 0.5,

10

population size N  1,000 and chromosome length L  20 . A total of 100 independent runs were
followed for 150 generations, and fixation of the correct genotype was observed in 14 runs (14%).
This fixation is conditional on the first appearance of the correct genotype in the population; once it
appears, its frequency increases exponentially. With the parameters values used, the probability of
occurrence of the correct genotype at the initial generation is equal to 1 220 1,000  9.5367 104 .
Therefore, when N 2L

1 the probability of fixation of the correct genotype is mostly dependent

on the balance between the mean time to its first appearance by recombination and the mean time to
fixation by genetic drift of the incorrect allele 0 at any single locus; an event that prevents the
fixation of the correct genotype (mutation was ignored in these simulations).

As an application of Eq.  6  , we can derive the mean number of good offspring in a
two-generation dynamics of a population of size N. Assume the population at the first
generation is composed of a single correct genotype (fitness L) plus N −1 random genotypes
(fitness 1). Since two distinct parents are chosen in each mating, the probability that the
good genotype is chosen is

where the first term is the probability that the good genotype is the first chosen mate and the
second term is the probability that it is the second mate. As a generation comprises N such
mates and the probability of resulting a good offspring is  , we obtain that the mean
number of good offspring in the second generation is

8

Since we have assumed that good offspring are produced only by mates involving the good
genotypes and not by the recombination of random strings, Eq.  8  yields a lower bound for

 but it fits the simulation data very well in the regime N  2L (data not shown). Most
interestingly, for large populations N  L we find that  tends to 2 regardless the value of



L, which explains the very fast growth of the good genotype once it appears in the population
(Fig. 2).


Our findings open a number of questions. What is the probability of fixation of the

correct string as a function of N and the search space 2 L ? What is the expected number of
generations for the correct genotype to reach fixation? What is the scaling factor between

11

N and L for successful fixation? The reason why these questions are important is the

following. As discussed by Belew [40], Hinton and Nowlan [34] picked the parameters in
their simulations very carefully as they assumed a population size of N  1,000 organisms,
and allele frequencies of 0.25 for zeros, 0.25 for ones, and 0.50 for question marks. With
L  20 , on average half of the alleles will be ? and there are 210  1,024 combinations to

try. Therefore, it is no surprise that given 1,000 organisms and up to G  1,000 learning
trials per organism the correct settings for the ? connections were easily found. If, for
instance, we keep G constant and let the chromosome length L to increase from 20 to 30,
the time taken for the population to solve the task in Hinton and Nowlan [34] scenario
increases exponentially [37]: with G  1,000 and L  30 it would take more than 103
generations before an arbitrary large population of learning organisms can find the solution
(results not shown). Therefore, both G and L need to be cautiously chosen (i.e., G 2L 2  1 )
to sustain the claim that learning speeds up evolution in a single-peaked fitness landscape.
Nonetheless, to the extent that the scientific community accepted that problem was
unsolvable in any reasonable fashion without learning [e.g., 5, 26 pp.77-80, 28 p. 178,
41,42], this could be considered as a relatively ‘minor’ detail in Hinton and Nowlan [34]
simulations. After all, they provided a proof of concept and Baldwin effects seemed to be
essential to solve their difficult adaptive task, which has generated a growing scientific
literature ever since. However, the demonstration that a population of non-learning sexual
organisms can also find the needle in the haystack converts what appeared to be a qualitative
issue into a quantitative problem in its own right (Fig. 3).

and Nowlan [34] algorithm with allele
frequencies of 0.25 for zeros, 0.25 for ones,

parameter values for population size
( N  2,500 ), chromosome length ( L  16 ),
and maximum number of learning trials per
organism ( G  250 ). With L  16 there are

28  256 combinations to try as an average
for the settings of ? alleles; that is, we kept
the same relationship G 2L 2  0.977 than
Hinton and Nowlan’s original simulation.
(B) the simulation follows Hinton and
Nowlan [34] scheme with the exception that
each organism is a binary string. Initial
frequencies were 0.5, population size
N  2,500 and chromosome length L  16 .
The point here is that in this scenario the
claim that learning allows organisms to
evolve much faster than their non-learning
counterparts does not seem to be fully justified.

4.1

Probability of fixation
We used computer simulations to estimate the probability of fixation of the correct

genotype (denoted as 1 ). The simulations followed Hinton and Nowlan [34] scheme. In
particular, the population consists of N binary strings of length L and update is parallel;
i.e., generations do not overlap. To create the next generation from the current one, we
perform N matings. The two parents of a mating are different individuals that are chosen at
random from the current generation with probability proportional to fitness ( w1  L is the
fitness of the correct genotype and w1  1 is the fitness of all genotypes but the correct
one). The single offspring of each mating is generated after applying the one point crossover
operation (see above). The initial population is generated randomly by choosing the L digits
of each string as 0 or 1 with equal probability.

13

For different string lengths, the probability of fixation 1 as a function of N is
plotted in Fig. 4A, and as a function of the rescaled variable   N 1.9 2L in Fig. 4B.

shown in Fig. 4B. We note that for a finite asexual population the corresponding scaling is
given by   N 2L (data not shown). Thus, with L  20 fixation

 1  0.99 of the correct

genotype in the sexual case is almost guaranteed when N  10,170 ; that is, with a population



14

size well below the size of the solution space  N 2L  0.0097  . The reason for this can be
understood from the following heuristic argument. Assume for simplicity that once the all 1s
string appears in the population its eventual fixation will occur because its frequency will
increase exponentially (see above). With N  2L , the correct genotype will be present at the
initial population with probability N 2L , which is quite low for N  10,170 and L  20 . It
will likely arise through recombination with the same probability N 2L at each generation
(we ignore the fact that allele frequencies will drift apart from their initial frequency of 0.5),
which means that the probability of no occurrence of the correct genotype decreases with the
number of generations as 1  N 2L  . With a large enough population size genetic drift will
t

not be very important and the correct genotype will eventually appear and spread to fixation.
Maynard Smith [5] previous argument needs to be rewritten as follows: In a sexual
population of 1,000 with initial allele frequencies of 0.5, a fit individual would arise about
once in 1,000 generations. Once it appears, it will reach fixation in few generations (actually,
the probability of fixation in this case is 1  0.172 ; Fig. 4A).

4.2

Mean time to fixation
The previous computer simulations also allowed estimating the (conditional) mean

time to fixation of the correct genotype (denoted as 1 ). For different string lengths, 1 is
plotted as a function of the number of strings N in Fig. 5A, and as a function of the ratio
between N and the size of the solution space N 2L in Fig. 5B. For L  20 we find that the
height of the 1 peak increases as 2L 2 which, most interestingly, coincides with the form the
number of learning trials G scales with the string length L. In particular, for L  20 we find
3
(mean  SD) 1  174  142
 generations with N  10 , and 1  28  14 generations with

N  105 . In other words, when N / 2L  0.1 the mean time to fixation of the correct

genotype is similar to Hinton and Nowlan [34] situation with learning (Fig. 1). In general, for
fixed L and very large N we have that 1 grows with log N and is practically insensitive to
L . This is in sharp contrast with what happens with learning because both L and G have to





increase simultaneously G 2L 2  1 , otherwise the time taken for the population to solve

15

the task in Hinton and Nowlan [34] scenario increases exponentially [37] as pointed out
above.

find (mean  SD)

N  105 . (B) is the same but





the mean time to fixation is
plotted against the ratio between

the population size and the size of the solution space N 2 L . The lines are guides to the eyes.

To sum up, in the single-peaked fitness landscape learning speeds up evolution
whenever the ratio between the maximum number of allowed guesses per organism G and
the size of the ‘guessing space’ 2 L 2 is on the same order, i.e. G 2L 2  1 , and the ratio
between population size N and the size of the solution space 2 L in non-learning organisms
is N / 2L  0.1 . That is, with G  1,000 , L  20 and 1,000 organisms as in Hinton and
Nowlan [34] the 106  2L queries to the fitness function per generation accomplish the same
result than sampling 105  2L 10 genotypes per generation in the non-learning situation (one
extra genotype is worth 10 queries). Decrease the ratio G 2L 2 below 1 and keep the ratio

N / 2L around 0.1 and the result is that non-learning sexual organisms will start doing better
than their learning equivalents.

4.3

Exploring other models of recombination
The successful fixation of the good genotype once it appears in the population is

critically dependent on the expected number L  of good offspring after recombination,
where  is the probability that any single offspring is an all 1s string. As we have previously
shown, L  1 in the one point recombination scenario assumed by Hinton and Nowlan
[34]. Our question now is to what extent this result is robust to a more general recombination
model.
Here we follow the stochastic multilocus method of Fraser and Burnell [43] and
model recombination as a random walk along the length of the two parental chromosomes,
changing from one to the other within the constraint of the probability of such a change;
namely, the recombination rate among two adjacent loci. Under the assumption that the
probability of recombination between any two loci is constant and equal to r , the probability
that a mate between a L loci good genotype and a random genotype produces a good
offspring is:

  1  r  1  r 2 ,

9

where 1 is the probability that the offspring is the good genotype when the random walk
starts from the all 1s parent, and  2 is the same probability when the random walk starts
from the other random parent. Here

numbers in the same sequence, i.e., E  M 2 if M is even and E   M  1 2 if M is odd.
As before, the mean number of good offspring genotypes is L  ; the product between the
fitness of the good parental genotype and  .

17

Fig. 6. Expected number of good offspring when an all 1s parental chromosome mates with L
random chromosomes. The curves plot L  , where  is the probability that any single offspring is
an all 1s string given by eq. (9) following the stochastic multilocus recombination method of Fraser
and Burnell [43].

Eqs. 10  and 11 allow us to set an upper bound for r such that L  1 (Fig. 6).
These results agree perfectly with simulation results (not shown). Thus, with L  20 the
upper bound is around r  0.156 , which is a large recombination rate between adjacent loci.
For instance, a recombination frequency of only r  103 in our analysis would correspond to
a chromosome with 1,000 loci and a map length of approximately 100 centimorgans; about
the map length of each of the two major chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster [44],
which together contain about 80% of the species’ genome. Therefore, the conclusion that
once the good string appears recombination would do little harm to its spread by selection
seems to be robust. This conclusion was checked by performing 100 independent simulation
runs as in Fig. 2 but now using the stochastic multilocus recombination method of Fraser and
Burnell [43] with r  0.15 . The correct genotype went to fixation in 12 runs (12%) in less
than 150 generations (results not shown).

Conclusions
As pointed out by Dennet [45], many scholars including himself thought that Hinton

and Nowlan [34] and Maynard Smith [5] had shown clearly and succinctly how and why the
Baldwin effect worked, to the extent that in his bestseller book “Consciousness Explained”
Dennet [46, p. 186] wrote that “thanks to the Baldwin effect, species can be said to pretest
the efficacy of particular different designs by phenotypic (individual) exploration of the
space of nearby possibilities”. We grant this sort of claims as misleading for two reasons.

18

First, it takes for granted the happening of an effect that still waits for convincing empirical
support after more than 100 years since its original inception. Second, it disregards the
countless times proved effectiveness of standard neo-Darwinian selection to evolve complex
biological traits [16,47] and contribute to some of the major evolutionary transitions [48].
Yeh and Price [49] speculated that colonization and establishment of a new
population of dark-eyed juncos in coastal California was facilitated by a plastic response in
breeding season, and claimed that their results provide the first quantitative evidence of
Baldwin’s proposition that plasticity aids individuals to deal with novel situations. Baldwin
[2] certainly deserves the merit of “setting out a nascent theory of the evolution of
phenotypic plasticity” [50, p. iii]; however, it should be remembered that the Baldwin effect
involves two transitions: the evolutionary value of phenotypic plasticity and the genetic
accommodation of the induced trait. Because Yeh and Price [49] did not prove that breeding
season  a highly plastic trait [51]  was genetically accommodated, we do not think their
paper can be cited as a clear example of Baldwin effects [10]. Simpson’s [1] careful scrutiny
made on the plausibility of Baldwin effects also applies here.
Our aim here was not to dismiss Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] seminal contribution
persuasively demonstrating the feasibility of the Baldwin effect. Their short paper offers
pima facie evidence of Haldane’s conviction that “if you are faced by a difficulty or a
controversy in science, an ounce of algebra is worth a ton of verbal argument” [52, p. 239],
which is undoubtedly the reason behind the huge positive influence of their work. Hinton and
Nowlan [34] showed how the Baldwin effect could happen, but our present results show that
there is no need for Baldwin effects to happen  at least in the proposed scenario.
It is critical to clarify what we have and have not shown here. We have shown that
finding a needle-in-the-haystack without learning is a trivial enterprise for a large population
of asexual organisms, as well as for a sexual population depending on the scaling factor
between population size and the search space. Therefore, Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] ‘genes
as followers’ scenario [9] for the Baldwin effect could also be reframed into the traditional
(Modern Synthesis) perspective that genes are ‘leaders’ and phenotypes are ‘followers’
during the process of adaptive evolution.
We have not shown that Baldwin effects are unlikely to happen in nature. Although
we are not completely hostile but share Simpson’s [1] skepticism about the concept, to prove

19

or disprove Baldwin effects is ultimately an empirical question. It should also be clarified
that our doubts on the actual relevance of Baldwin effects should not be taken as a criticism
to the role of behavior in evolution [53,54], as it is already obvious by contrasting Mayr’s
[13] hostility towards Baldwin effects and his vindication of behavior as an important
pacemaker or driver of evolutionary change [55]. Actually, one of us has conjectured that
behavioral thermoregulation has been responsible for the fading of adaptive latitudinal clines
[56]; the so-called ‘Bogert effect’ [57]. One thing is to assume that by choosing a specific
temperature the organisms mitigate fluctuations in their thermal environment and little
selection for temperature-related changes occur as we did, and quite another is to suppose
that this behavior helps the survival of the organisms until hereditary variation favored by
natural selection in the new environment can be accommodated (Baldwin effect).
To conclude, the demonstration that a standard neo-Darwinian account without
learning can easily solve Hinton and Nowlan’s [34] harsh task should move “Baldwin
boosters” [25] to their winter retreats. Interested colleagues, including ourselves, are invited
to come up with a more convincing case for a fascinating and potentially important
mechanism.

In the scenario without learning the neural connections are also specified by L loci
but now with two alleles each, 1 and 0 , because in this situation there is no difference
between alleles 0 and ? . Since there is no smoothing out of the fitness landscape the fitness

For the haploid case Felsenstein [58] has shown that directional two-locus selection will tend
to generate linkage disequilibrium of the same sign as the multiplicative epistatic parameter.

frequencies after selection:

Generations
Fig. A1. Generation of gametic linkage disequilibrium without learning.

Felsenstein [58] also showed that if the linkage disequilibrium generated by epistatic
selection is positive, tighter linkage accelerates the change in allelic frequencies. Therefore,
the analytical recursion equations to analyze the evolution of allele frequencies in Hinton and
Nowlan’s [34] model without learning [37] are expected to grossly overestimate the speed of
evolution as they did not take into account the generation of linkage disequilibrium.

Appendix B
Exact recursion equations for the non-learning asexual case
We will consider the case where learning is absent in order to show the effect of
neglecting the generation of linkage disequilibrium due to selection. In this case the
genotypes are binary strings of size L because without learning there is no difference
between alleles 0 and ? . There are 2 L different such strings and we denote their frequencies
in the infinite population at
generation t by Y  t  , with   1,

, 2L . Without loss of

generality, we will assume that the correct genotype, i.e. the string 1, 1,

22

, 1 , corresponds

to  1. Recalling that the fitness w of all genotypes but the correct one is set to the
baseline value w1  1 , and that the fitness of the correct genotype is set to w1  L , we can


immediately write the recursion equations
Y1  t  1 

The denominator of the fractions in the right-hand-side of these equations is the average
fitness of the population. It is also of interest to calculate the frequency of alleles 1 at
generation t, which we denote by p  t  . To simplify this calculation, let us assume that at
generation t  0 the frequencies of all genotypes different from the correct one take on the
same value, say Y1  0   Y2  0  . Hence, Eq.  B.2  guarantees that these frequencies will
always remain identical, i.e., Y1  t   Y2  t  for all t. With this assumption, it is
straightforward to write an equation for p  t 

 B.3

were P stands for the number of alleles 1 in string  and we have used the normalization



condition Y1  t   2L  1 Y2  t   1 . For large L , Eq.  B.3 reduces to p  t   1  Y1  t  2 .
Thus, the study of the case of evolution without learning reduces to finding the
solution of Eq.  B.1 that yields the frequency of the correct genotype Y1  t  as a function of
the generation number t. For t

1 we can rewrite the recursion Eq.  B.1 as the ordinary

differential equation

 B.5

Since we are interested in the regime t

1 for which Y1  t   1 , this equation can be further

rewritten as

Y1  t   1 

 B.6 

This expression is useful because it allows us to estimate the number of generations needed
for Y1  t  to attain some arbitrary value close to one. In fact, solving Eq.  B.6  for t yields

from which we see that t increases with the logarithm of Y1  0  rather than with a negative
power of Y1  0  as in the case where linkage disequilibrium is neglected [37].

Appendix C
Exact recursion equations for the non-learning asexual case assuming mutation
We sketch the derivation here solely to emphasize the equivalence between the
asexual case and the well-known single-peak fitness landscape of the quasispecies model
[59]. The analysis simplifies greatly if one assumes that the relevant feature to distinguish the
strings is the number of correct alleles they have without regard to their specific positions in
the string. Provided that the initial condition is consistent with this assumption (i.e., all
strings with the same number of alleles 1 have the same initial frequencies) the derived
recursion equations are exact for the single peak landscape.
We begin by grouping all strings into L+1 classes, i  0, 1,…, L , according to the
number of alleles 1 they have. The frequencies of those classes are simply i   Y iP ,


where  ij is the Kronecker delta. Hence L  Y1 since P1  L and there is only one string
with L alleles 1. The idea is to derive a recursion equation for theclass frequencies rather for


the string frequencies, which amounts to reducing the number of equations from 2 L to L+1.


The probability that a string with j 1s mutates to a string with i 1s is given by

where w 1 L 1L . Note that this is the equation for Eigen’s [59] model in the singlepeak fitness landscape. In particular, the reproduction rate of the ‘master sequence’ (i.e., the



all 1s string) is L , which is identical to the sequence length. Hence, we expect the error
threshold transition to take place at uc  1  1 L1 L  0.139 for L  20 . Simulation results
(not shown) indicate that this figure is a good approximation.
