Abstract
We present an effective model for timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) in

terms of two interacting traces, corresponding to the fraction of activated NMDA receptors and the Ca2+ concentration in the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron. This
model intends to bridge the worlds of existing simplistic phenomenological rules and
highly detailed models, constituting thus a practical tool for the study of the interplay
between neural activity and synaptic plasticity in extended spiking neural networks.
For isolated pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes the standard pairwise STDP rule
is reproduced, with appropriate parameters determining the respective weights and time
scales for the causal and the anti-causal contributions. The model contains otherwise
only three free parameters which can be adjusted to reproduce triplet nonlinearities in
both hippocampal culture and cortical slices. We also investigate the transition from
time-dependent to rate-dependent plasticity occurring for both correlated and uncorrelated spike patterns.
Keywords: STDP, spike triplets, frequency dependent plasticity

1 Introduction
The fact that synaptic plasticity can depend on the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes (Bi et al., 2005; Rubin et al., 2005), indicates that time has to be coded
somehow in individual neurons. If the concentration of a certain ion or molecule, which
we will refer to as a trace, decays in time after a given event in a regular fashion, then
the level of that trace could serve as a time coder, in the same way as the concentration
of a radioactive isotope can be used to date a fossil.
A range of models have been proposed in the past that formulate long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in terms of traces in the postsynaptic neurons (Karmarkar et al., 2002; Badoual et al., 2006; Shouval et al., 2002; Rubin et al.,
2005; Graupner et al., 2012; Uramoto et al., 2013). Several of these models successfully reproduce a wide range of experimental results; including pairwise STDP, triplet
and even quadruplet nonlinearities. Most models, however, require fitting of a large
number of parameters individually for each experimental setup and involve heavily
non-linear functions of the trace concentrations. While possibly realistic in nature, the
study of neural systems modeled under these rules from a dynamical point of view
becomes a highly non-trivial task. At the other end, the connection between predictions of simplified models, constructed as phenomenological rules (Badoual et al.,
2006; Froemke et al., 2002), and the biological underpinnings is normally hard to establish, as they usually aim to reproduce only the synaptic change and do away with the
information stored in the the traces themselves.
In the present work we propose a straightforward model formulating synaptic potentiation and depression in terms of two interacting traces representing the fraction of
2

activated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ at the postsynaptic spine, with the intention of bridging these two worlds.
Having a low number of parameters and being composed of only polynomial differential equations, the model is able nonetheless to reproduce key features of LTP and
LTD. Moreover, since the parameters of the model are easily related to the dynamical
properties of the system, it permits to make a connection between the observed synaptic
weight change and the behavior of the underlying traces.

2 The model
Plasticity in our model will be expressed in terms of two interacting traces on the postsynaptic site, which we denote x and y, representing the fraction of open-state NMDA
receptors (or NMDARs) and the Ca2+ concentration in the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic neuron, respectively. For a clarification we shortly recall the overall mechanism
of the synaptic transmission process in a glutamatergic synapse, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
A presynaptic spike results in the release of glutamate molecules across the synaptic
cleft, which will activate a series of receptors on the postsynaptic spine, including the already mentioned NMDA receptors, and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid (AMPA) receptors (or AMPAR)(Meldrum, 2000). Na+ ions will then flow through
the AMPAR channels into the dendritic spine of the postsynaptic cell, triggering a cascade of events which may eventually lead to the activation of an axonal spike at the soma
of the postsynaptic cell, and of an action potential backpropagating down the dendritic
tree. This action potential has two effects captured within our model: the first is the

are directly activated by glutamate, voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) by the
backpropagation action potential. NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are also activated by
glutamate and allow the influx of calcium if they additionally unblock, which occurs
when the backpropagating action potential removes the blocking Mg 2+ ion.

activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC), allowing an influx of Ca2+ ions,
resulting hence in an increase of the Ca2+ concentration y; the second is the unblocking
of NMDAR channels, as we detail in what follows.
Ca2+ ions may flow into the postsynaptic spine also through the NMDAR channels
(Meldrum, 2000), but for this to happen two conditions need to be fulfilled. NMDARs
are activated when glutamate binds to them, which in turn opens the receptor’s Ca2+
permeable channel. The channels are said to be open when the protein’s conformational
4

state permits ions to flow through them, and closed otherwise. At resting membrane potential, however, Mg 2+ ions are present in the channel’s pore, blocking the channel and
preventing Ca2+ ions from permeating the neuron (Mayer et al., 1984). This block is
temporarily removed by a back-propagating action potential. For Ca2+ to flow into the
postsynaptic spine two conditions need hence to be fulfilled. The presence of glutamate
in the synaptic cleft, triggered by a presynaptic spike, and a back-propagating action
potential, signaling a postsynaptic spike. The NMDA receptors are hence the primary
agents, within our model, for the interaction of pre- and postsynaptic neural activities
in terms of axonal spikes. They are hence also the primary agents for causality within
the STDP rule.

2.1 Trace dynamics
We denote with {tσpre } and {tσpost } the trains of pre- and postsynaptic spikes, respectively. The update rules for the fraction x of open but blocked NMDA receptors and the
concentration y of postsynaptic Ca2+ ions are then given by




P

 ẏ = − y + (x + yc )Ey (y) σ δ(t − tσpost )
τy

where τx and τy represent the time constants for the decay of x and y respectively.
In absence of presynaptic spikes, glutamate in the synaptic cleft is cleared by passive
diffusion and glutamate transporters (Huang et al., 2004). Ca2+ concentration in the
postsynaptic site will decay, in turn, in absence of postsynaptic spikes (Carafoli, 1987).
In our model, each incoming presynaptic spike produces an increase in the number x of
open NMDA channels due to glutamate release, and the Ca2+ concentration y increases

only when a postsynaptic spike is present, viz when a backpropagating action potential
reaches the postsynaptic spine. Calcium increase in (1) is composed of two terms; a
constant value yc , representing the contribution of VGCCs, and a term proportional
to the fraction of open NMDA receptors. In this simplified approach, every NMDAR
channel still open from the presynaptic spike, is then unblocked by the backpropagating
action potential. Therefore the transient calcium current through NMDA receptors is
modeled as proportional to x.
The efficacy factors Ex and Ey included in (1) are defined as:

(2)

where z is either x or y, and determine the efficacy of spikes in increasing trace concentrations. For trace levels above the respective reference values xb and yb no further
increase is possible (see Fig. 2 a) and the trace concentration can only decay exponen-

6

tially. This determines a refractory period, as shown in Fig. 3. The duration of this
period is in this case a function of the decay constant of the trace and the magnitude
of the overshoot above the reference value. Below this level, E will tend asymptotically to unity as the trace concentration decays. In this way, previous spikes decrease
the efficacy of future spikes. Similar mechanisms of reduced spike efficacy have been
proposed in the past in models of STDP (Froemke et al., 2002).
Two forces therefore compete to drive nonlinear plasticity in our model: trace accumulation and spike suppression, the latter formulated in the present effective model via
a saturation term.
The update rules (1) for the traces are reduced, in the sense that all superfluous
constants have been rescaled away, as discussed further in the Appendix.

2.2 Update rules for the synaptic weight
We now formulate the updating rules for the synaptic weight, or synaptic strength, in
terms of the trace concentrations. To this end we consider the contribution of two
pathways mediated by distinct enzymes (Colbran, 2004); which, for simplicity we will
denote as LTP and LTD pathways. Calcium is involved in both the LTP and the LTD
pathways (Cormier et al., 2001; Neveu et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1999), with high levels
of calcium resulting in LTP and moderate and low levels resulting in LTD. We propose
the following rule for the plasticity of the synaptic weight w,
ẇ = αx(y − b)θ(y − b)

δ(t − tσpost ) − βxy

δ(t − tσpre ),

with θ being the same previously defined step function which, in this case, serves as
a lower bound. The first term in (3) leads to an increase of the synaptic weight; it is

of x < xb the efficacy of incoming spikes is reduced proportionally to xb − x.

triggered in the presence of a postsynaptic spike and by the calcium concentration y,
but only if y is larger than a given threshold b, see Fig. 2 b). A threshold in the calcium
concentration Ca2+ for LTP has been experimentally observed (Cormier et al., 2001)
and its dependence with the previous synaptic activity has been studied (Huang et al.,
1992). In the present work we will consider a constant b = yc , and we will show in the
next section that the standard STDP curve is obtained with this choice.

8

The second term in (3), in turn, leads to decrease of the synaptic weight and needs
a finite level for both the calcium concentration y and for the fraction of open NMDA
receptors x (which can be taken as a measure of the glutamate concentration in the
synaptic cleft), in addition to the presence of a presynaptic spike, which acts as a second
coincidence detector as proposed by Karmarkar et al. (2002). The parameters α > 0
and β > 0 represent the relative strengths of these two contributions.
The pre- and postsynaptic spikes tσpre/post mark the timing of the synaptic update
in our model (3) for the synaptic plasticity. Here we considered δ-like spikes and one
needs, for numerical simulations using small but finite time steps, to update the traces
via (1) before updating the weights via (3).

2.3 The pairwise STDP rule
In the limit of low frequencies, the traces decay to zero in between the occurrence of
two pairs of spikes, which may hence be considered as isolated.
We denote with ∆t the time between the pre- and the postsynaptic spike, with a
positive value corresponding to a causal pre-post order and a negative ∆t to an anticausal post-pre ordering. For an isolated pair of spikes one can easily integrate (1) and
(3), obtaining:

∆w =





 αe−|∆t|/τx e−|∆t|/τx + yc − b


 −βyc e−|∆t|/τy

∆t > 0
(4)
∆t < 0

The synaptic weight is always depressed for an anti-causal time ordering of the spikes
with ∆t < 0, and potentiated for yc ≥ b and a causal time ordering corresponding to
∆t > 0. The LTP term becomes a simple exponential decay for b = yc . We have
9

chosen in our model a fully decoupled formulation for LTP and LTD. While the LTD
term is always negative, the restriction on the LTP term to be always positive could be
relaxed by removing the step function in equation (3). Then, with the choice b > yc , a
depression window would arise after the peak of potentiation. This window has indeed
been observed in the past in CA1 cells from rat hippocampal slices (Nishiyama et al.,
2000). By setting b < yc , on the other hand, the decay would be composed of two
exponentials. In the LTD term we have not included a threshold. Alternatively, one
could replace the calcium level y by an expression (y − bLT D )θ(y − bLT D ), analogous
to the LTP term, which is identical to the case we present for bLT D = 0 since y is always
positive. It is however worth discussing the cases where bLT D 6= 0. Apart from the step
function θ, the LTD threshold represents only a vertical shift of the negative portion of
the STDP window by a factor βbLT D . If bLT D < 0 the plot is shifted downwards, which
means depression occurs even for isolated presynaptic spikes (∆t → −∞). This is
usually not the case, as seen in Bi et al. (1998) and Froemke et al. (2002). If bLT D < 0,
on the other hand, the plot is shifted upwards but, because of the step function, the
LT D term is always negative and then the tail of the exponential would be cut-off. By
looking at the experimental results in Figs. 4 and 6, one observes that the data seems
in fact quite noisy to determine the exact shape of the decay functions. In absence of
further detail, we have chosen in the present work to keep b = yc and no threshold
(or a threshold at 0) for LTD, therefore respecting the exponential fits proposed in the
original papers (Bi, 2002; Froemke et al., 2002).
Rewriting the constants α, β, τx , and τy as α = A+ , β = A− /yc , τx = 2τ+ , and
τy = τ− where A+ , A− , τ+ and τ− represent the maximal intensities and timescales of

10

LTP and LTD for isolated spike pairs, we obtain with

the classical fit for pairwise STDP proposed both in hippocampal and cortical neurons
(Bi, 2002; Froemke et al., 2002). This result is independent of yc , xb , and yb and these
three parameters can be hence be used to reproduce additional experimental observations. In what follows we will use the amplitudes A± as primary parameters, instead of
α and β and rewrite the plasticity rule (3) as

This is the final shape of the equation for the evolution of the synaptic strength that we
will use throughout this work, it allows to interpret the results for a variety of spike pattern situations in terms of the known spike-pair STDP parameters. The representations
(6) and (3) are, in any case, equivalent.

2.4 Spike triplets
The effect of a pair of pre- and postsynaptic spikes has been experimentally shown
to depend, in a non-linear fashion, not only on its inter-spike interval but also on the
presence of additional spikes temporally proximal to the pair. The contribution of spike
triplets, the simplest case of spike-pair interactions, cannot be described as a linear sum
of two individual contributions of spike-pairs (Froemke et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005).
In the following sections, we will study the model’s results for either two pre- and
one postsynaptic spikes in a pre-post-pre order, or one pre- and two postsynaptic spikes
11

in a post-pre-post ordering. For example, with 15Post5 we denote a pre-post-pre ordering,
15Post5,



	
tσpre = {−15, 5},

σ 	
tpost = {0}

(7)

and with 10Pre20 a post-pre-post ordering,

σ 	
tpre = {0},

σ 	
tpost = {−10, 20} ,

(8)

where the times tσpre/post of the spikes are given in milliseconds.
As for spike pairs, the weight-change induced by low-frequency triplets can be computed analytically, obtaining

for post-pre-post triplets, where we have assumed that the traces are below their respective reference levels, xb and yb respetively, by the time a second spike arrives (the case
of the second spike arriving while the trace is above the reference level is discussed
later in this section). The saturation effect can reduce the effect of a new spike to zero
but not reverse the sign, as seen in expression (2).
We see that the first term in Eqs. (9) and (10), corresponding to the first pair, remains
in both cases unchanged, by construction, with non-linearities appearing in the second
contribution. In the second term of Eq. (9), we find a first factor (the first parenthesis)
12

corresponding to a correction produced by the interaction between the two traces (the
calcium inflow through NMDAR channels), and a second factor corresponding to the
balance between trace accumulation and spike suppression. In Eq. (10) we also find
a term balancing trace accumulation and spike suppression. The multiplicative factor
exp(|∆t2 |/τx ) inside the brackets comes from the way we have decided to factorize the
equation, since τx = 2τ+ .
If the third spike would instead come within the respective refractory period (see
Fig. 3), the expressions (9) and (10) would reduce to

for post-pre-post triplets, where in Eq. (12) the second pair is directly inhibited by the
LTP threshold. While this last situation is not encountered for the low frequency triplet
configurations presented in this work, it becomes relevant in high frequency scenarios.
This condition could be relaxed by replacing the strict threshold by a smooth sigmoidal.

2.5 Interpretation of the variables and parameters in the model
The here proposed model contains a relative small number of variables and parameters and can be considered an effective approach with the biological underpinnings of
STDP being governed by a substantially larger number of variables and parameters
whose functional interdependences are naturally far more complex than the polynomial
13

descriptions here proposed. Any effective model will however pool together within
each effective variable or parameter several effects which might depend on a variety of
different factors in the biological neuron.
In section 2.1, we defined x as the fraction of open but unblocked NMDAR channels. When paired with a postsynaptic spike, and under the simplifications assumed in
the model, the value of x can be then associated with a transient calcium current and a
comparison with experimental results of the parameters related to x would reflect this
role. The time window for LTP, for instance, results in our model from the value of
τx = 2τ+ (as we showed in section 2.3). τx can then be interpreted in this context as
the decay time of the transient calcium current. It has been argued by Hao et al. (2012)
that the narrow window for LTP results from AMPA-EPSP in the postsynaptic spine.
In fact, as reviewed in the same article, the whole spine seems to work as an electrical
amplifier, locally prolonging the depolarization time at the spine. It is therefore not surprising to find different values of the time constants in different neurons or even within
different synapses within the same neuron. In our model we do not compute AMPA
currents directly and reduce the overall effect of the spine to the effective value of τx .
Similarly, τy represents the timescale for decay of the effective calcium concentration
at the spine.
We have included in this work saturation terms for both variables x and y. As it has
been proposed in the past (Froemke et al., 2002), triplet nonlinearities in visual cortical
neurons indicate strong suppression effects on future spikes by previous spikes of the
train. The saturation terms included in the model provide one possible effective way
of dealing with spike suppression, reducing a biological complex phenomena further

14

down the cascade of processes, leading eventually to LTP and to LTD respectively.

3 Results for the Hippocampus
Our model, as defined by (1) and (6) contains overall seven adjustable parameters. Four
of these parameters, namely A+ = α, A− = β/yc, τ+ , and τ− , enter explicitly the isolated spike-pair STDP rule (5) and are determined directly by experiment. For cultured
rat hippocampal neurons
A+ = 0.86/60,

A− = 0.25/60,

τ+ = 19 ms,

τ− = 34 ms

(13)

have been measured (Bi, 2002) and we will use these experimental values throughout
the hippocampus part of this study. In Fig. 4 we present, as an illustration, both the
experimental and the theory results, with the latter reproducing, by construction, the
experimental fit. For the model simulation, the experimental protocol of 60 repetitions
spaced by one second has been used. However, the 1Hz frequency of spike pairs is so
low that (5) could be directly used without any discernible difference.
Three parameters entering (1) and (6), namely yc , xb , and yb are to be selected. In a
continuous time evolution scenario, xb and yb determine strict maximal concentrations
for the traces. In the discrete time scenario, overshoots are however possible, due to the
finite increase in the traces after every spike. In this context, and in a low frequency
situation, the first spike in the stimulation pattern is unaffected by the limiting factor,
and only the efficacy of the following spike is reduced. Since xb and yb then do not
affect pairwise STDP, they need to be selected from higher order contributions to the
weight-change. In this case, we selected the values of yc , xb , and yb from triplet results,

In Fig. 5 we now compare our results for triplets, as described in section 2.4, with
experiments for cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Wang et al., 2005). The triplet stimulation experimental protocol consists of a regular train of 60 triplets with a repetition
frequency of 1 Hz and we use the identical protocol for the theory simulations. We also
keep the pairwise STDP parameters (13) valid for cultured rat hippocampal neurons and
adjust the remaining three free parameters yc , xb , and yb by minimizing the standard deviation (SD) between the numerical and the experimental results, obtaining yc = 0.28,
yb = 0.66, and xb = 0.62 (with an SD of 6.76).

Figure 5: Synaptic strength change in hippocampal neurons induced by triplets composed of either two pre- and one postsynaptic spike, left side of the diagram, compare
(7), or one pre- and two postsynaptic spikes, right side of the diagram, see (8). A total of 60 triplets are presented, with a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. Full blue boxes
correspond to the model’s results, empty red bars to experimental data (Wang et al.,
2005), and the green lines represent the linear addition of the PostPre and PrePost pairs
each triplet contains via (6). Simulation parameters: A+ = 0.86/60, A− = 0.25/60,
τ+ = 19ms, τ− = 34ms, yc = 0.28, xb = 0.62, and yb = 0.66.

We found that the SD varies smoothly, and relatively weakly, with the exact choice
of the three free parameters, as can be expected from the analytical expressions, and that
this freedom can be used to obtain a range of functional dependencies of the synaptic
plasticity upon spiking frequencies, as discussed in Sect. 5.
We have also included in Fig. 5 the expected synaptic weight changes for the case
of a linear superposition of the two respective interspike contributions via (6). One ob-

17

serves that the discrepancy between the non-linear and the linear interactions is much
stronger for pre-post-pre than for post-pre-post triplets. With the former leading to
an overall reduced synaptic weight change and the later configuration to a substantial
potentiation. It is interesting to observe here that spike suppression, as proposed in
Froemke et al. (2002) from cortical neurons cannot explain nonlinearities in hippocampus. Suppression of the second presynaptic spike in the triplet would reduce depression
and the overall result would be supralinear potentiation, contrary to the experimental
observation. Trace accumulation is the dominant effect driving nonlinearities in hippocampal neurons.

4 Results for the Cortex
We repeat now the procedure presented previously for the hippocampus, comparing the
results of the proposed plasticity rule to experimental data obtained from slices of the
visual cortex. As in the previous section, the values of A+ = α, A− = β/yc , τ+ , and τ−
are determined directly by experiment. We use
A+ = 1.03/60,

A− = 0.51/60,

τ+ = 13.3 ms,

τ− = 34.5 ms

(14)

as obtained by Froemke et al. (2002) for pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of rat
visual cortical slices. Both experiment and the STDP curve are shown in Fig. 6, where
we have reproduced, for the simulation, the experimental protocol, using 60 repetitions
at 0.2 Hz. Once again, the frequency of spike pairs is so low that (5) could be directly
used without any discernible difference.
To select yc , xb , and yb we once again resort to triplet results. In Froemke et al.

or one pre- and two postsynaptic spikes was also measured. The data consist in this
case however of a large set of specific triplet timing configurations, with every individual triplet configuration measured once. We decided to treat all measurements on
an equal footing, fitting the complete set by minimizing the mean square error without
introducing any further bias.
We obtain in this case yc = 11.6, yb = 10.9, and xb = 0.5. The obtained SD of 37.4
is, in this case, much larger than the one found for hippocampus, though that is partly
due to the variance in the experimental data themselves, corresponding to individual

data points and not to averaged results. Another consequence of the large variance in
the data is that the minimum in the SD is relatively broad. We will discuss these points
in detail in what follows.
In order to compare the results for cortical neurons with the previous section on hip-

20

pocampal neurons, as presented in In Fig. 5, we have performed a smooth interpolation
of the set of individual experimental results for cortical triplets by means of gaussian
filters. In Fig. 7 we compare the theory results with the interpolated experimental data.
Contrary to hippocampal triplet results presented in Fig. 5, experiments in cortical
slices show that post-pre-post triplets lead to strong depression and pre-post-pre triplets
to potentiation. Post-pre-post triplets deviate, in addition, somewhat more from a linear superposition of the contribution of the two inherent spike pairs than the pre-postpre configuration. While the predictions of the model presented in Fig. 7) are clearly
not as good as the ones obtained for hippocampal culture, they are still qualiatively in
agreement with the experimental results, successfully capturing the asymmetry between
post-pre-post and pre-post-pre triplets. While, there is still room for improvement in this
regard, we believe it is important that the model can switch from the hippocampal to
the cortical regime in terms of triplet nonlinearities.
As we previously mentioned, the data itself has a much larger variance in this case.
To have an idea of of the variability of the data, we computed the standard deviation
of the data to the smooth gaussian interpolation of width 5ms that we used for the
visual comparison of Fig. 7, which yields an SD of 32.5 (as compared to the SD of 37.4
between model and experiment). For this reason, we believe that a reasonable goal in
this case is to reproduce the distinct qualitative feature of the triplet nonlinearities, more
than an accurate quantitative approximation.
The optimal value of yc = 11.6 obtained when fitting the experimental triplet results, see Fig. 7, seems to be too large, in particular when compared to the one obtained
for hippocampal neurons. This result can be traced back to the occurrence of a broad

21

minimum for the least-square fit together with a relative high variability of the experimental data. We have hence also examined parameter configurations with lower values
for yc . Also included in Fig. 7 is an example with yc = 1.0, also representing the observed experimental features qualitatively. We find that the particular cortical structure
of triplets arises from strong saturation, being a consequence of yb < yc .

5 Frequency dependence
So far, we have considered only pairs or triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes coming
at low frequencies and with very precise timings. This will not necessarily be the case in
a natural train of spikes. It is therefore interesting to examine the model’s prediction for
spike trains with different degrees of correlation between pre- and postsynaptic spikes.
A neuron usually receives input from about ten thousand other neurons. While the
correlation of the postsynaptic neuron will be higher for a strong synapse driving the
neuron, the postsynaptic neuron will in general not be correlated with all of its inputs.
We therefore study both types of connections.
We begin in section 5.1 by studying the case of uncorrelated trains of pre- and
postsynaptic spikes and then analyze in section 5.2 the case of a driving synapse with
different degrees of correlation. In these sections we numerically evaluate the synaptic
strength change as a function of the pre- and postsynaptic neuronal firing rates.

22

5.1 Plasticity induced by uncorrelated spikes
We begin by evaluating the synaptic change produced by uncorrelated trains of Poisson pre- and postsynaptic spikes. In these simulations we use the same parameters as
fitted from pairwise and triplet experiments in Hippocampus and Cortex, refering to
hippocampal and cortical neurons respectively.
The results of the simulations for hippocampal neurons are presented in Fig. 8. We
present two kinds of plots in the diagram: a plot where the pre- and postsynaptic firing
rates are equal, and plots of constant presynaptic frequency for varying postsynaptic
firing rate. We observe in this last type, that the sign of the weight changes, as a function
of the postsynaptic activity for a constant presynaptic frequency, generically switching
from negative to positive at a certain threshold θH . This threshold increases with rising
presynaptic frequency, resulting in a sliding threshold. In other rate-based learning rules
like BCM (Bienenstock et al., 1982), similar thresholds for potentiation are determined
by appropriate long term averages of the postsynaptic activity. In our model, θH is
set by the level of the presynaptic activity, as measured on timescales of the respective
traces. This feature would allow the neuron to adjust the threshold of each synapse
independently, setting in each case the level of what constitutes a significant activity.
The overall synaptic change becomes Hebbian for large pre- and post- firing rates
fpre and fpost , in the sense that it is then proportional to the product fpre · (fpost − θH ).
This weight change is influenced in a substantial way by the value of yc and we have
presented in Fig. 8 two sets of parameters, one with yc = 0.28 (left panel) and one with
yc = 0.8 (right panel), yielding otherwise similar SDs when fitting the experimental
triplet data (6.76 and 7.37 respectively).

Potentiation dominates for larger values of yc , as seen in Fig. 8 b). These results
seem, at first sight, counterintuitive given the role of yc as a threshold for LTP. Note
however, that yc contributes to the increase in y through (1) and both LTP and LTD are
dependent on y in the plasticity rule (6), with the LTD contribution being proportional
to 1/yc .
Comparing Figs. 8 a) and b) we observe that yc can be used to regulate the threshold for potentiation in the rate-encoding limit, without changing the behavior of isolated

spike triplets substantially. yc is hence a vehicle for also adapting the overall postsynaptic activity level and it would be interesting, for future research, to study how this
regulative mechanism would interact with other known ways to regulate the overall
level of the postsynaptic neural activity, such as intrinsic plasticity rules (Triesch, 2007;
Marković et al., 2012; Linkerhand et al., 2013).
It has to be remarked that the full lines in Fig. 8, representing weight changes as a
function of the postsynaptic frequency for a constant presynaptic firing rate, while of
theoretical interest to understand the behaviour of θH , will not correspond to a usual
physiological functional relationship between the rates, at least for a driving synapse. If

25

the presynaptic synapse drives the postsynaptic neuron, the postsynaptic activity will in
general be an increasing function of the presynaptic rate. Here we have chosen fpre =
fpost (the dashed lines in Fig. 8 and 9) as an illustration, but a more detailed transfer
function should be selected for accurate and quantitative comparisons with experimental
results. In this sense, the parameter configuration of Fig. 8 b) shows a better agreement
with experimental procedures, such as that of Sjöström et al. (2001), where potentiation
is shown to become stronger with higher frequencies.
No complete set of experimental results has hitherto been published, unfortunately,
where all pairwise, triplet, and frequency dependent plasticity have been measured for
the same type of synapse and with the same experimental stimulation procedure. A full
consistency check between model and experiment is hence not possible to date.
In Fig. 9 the results of numerical simulations for L2/3 cortical neurons for the same
protocol of Fig. 8 are presented. In this case, depression is found for all combinations
of pre- and postsynaptic frequencies, a robust prediction of the model. Different values
of yc were selected to test this behavior, and in each case the rest of the parameters were
fitted to the triplet results. In each case, the value of yb obtained by this fitting turned out
to be lower than yc . The y-trace has hence a hard time to overcome the threshold yc for
LTP, as calcium increase by further spikes is prevented. As a test, if yb was artificially
set to values larger than yc , potentiation for larger frequencies was recovered but the
fit of the experimental triplet data deteriorated substantially, obtaining potentiation for
PostPrePost triplets, contrary to the experimental results. This indicates that triplet
nonlinearities found in L2/3 cortical neurons result from spike suppression, contrary to
the predominant trace accumulation effect present in hippocampal neurons.

26

These results, predicted for L2/3 neurons as fitted from Froemke et al. (2002), would
then be in stark contrast to those of Sjöström et al. (2001) for L5 neurons in visual cortex
where LTP dominates for large frequencies. It should be pointed out, however, that the
pairwise STDP plot presented in Sjöström et al. (2001) is already different from that
of L2/3 neurons, raising the question of to what extent results coming from different
neurons, or obtained via different stimulation procedures, should be alike.
On the other hand, the prediction of overall depression dominating for uncorrelated
spike trains in certain cortical neurons seems to be in line with, or at least does not
contradict, experimental findings for deprivation experiments. In cortical areas, where
topological maps are usually found, deprivation of sensory input has been shown to
result in depression of the respective synaptic connections (Trachtenberg et al., 2000;
Feldman, 2000). At the same time, correlation has been found to substantially decrease
after these procedures, in areas projecting to cortex (Linden et al., 2009), suggesting
that decorrelation of spike trains could be responsible for the observed depression in
cortical neurons.
A possible reason behind the observed differences in these studies might be the
stimulation protocol employed. While in Bi et al. (1998) and Wang et al. (2005), plasticity is triggered by eliciting the firing of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons by dual
whole-cell clamp, in the cortical results from Froemke et al. (2002), extracellular presynaptic stimulation is performed, clamping only the postsynaptic neurons. This creates
an asymmetry between Pre-Post-Pre and Post-Pre-Post triplets. Moreover, in the case of
extracellular stimulation, the question remains to what extent other synapses are being
affected, potentially triggering, in turn, other forms of plasticity such as local synaptic

27

scaling.
It is important to stress that the robust depression found here for higher frequencies is a direct consequence of the triplet results, and indeed vanishes if one uses
hippocampal-like triplet results. The same suppression effect present for triplets also
affects higher frequency trains, resulting in depression.
For lower frequencies, the pairwise contribution dominates when determining the
balance between potentiation and depression. In Izhikevich et al. (2003), the authors
show how a straightforward application of the pairwise rule to Poisson uncorrelated
spike trains (as in our simulation), adding up linearly the effect of every pair in the train
according to the pairwise STDP rule with cortical parameters, always leads to depression, since the pairs simply sample the STDP curve which has an overall negative area
(the opposite is true in hippocampal neurons, as we show below). Our model is by
construction, equivalent in the low frequency limit to the linear pairwise model since
isolated spikes produce no synaptic change in our model and triplets and higher order
configurations become very infrequent if the frequency is low. For low pre- and postsynaptic frequencies the trains of Poisson spikes can be considered as pairs of random
duration that sample the pairwise STDP curve.
As previously mentioned, the overall integrated area of the pairwise STDP curve for
L2/3 cortical neurons is negative while it is positive for hippocampal neurons. One can
easily integrate the exponentials and one obtains a relation A for the areas:

A=

A+ τ+
.
A− τ−

(15)

While for hippocampal neurons A = 1.92, we find in cortex A = 0.77. This
28

means that, in absence of higher order contributions (which is true if both the preand the postsynaptic frequencies are low), uncorrelated spikes will on average lead
to depression in cortical neurons and to potentiation in hippocampal neurons. If the
frequencies tend to zero, the average interspike interval will be long compared to the
STDP window duration and the net amount of synaptic change, whether positive or
negative, will be low. In the following section this fact will become clear when the
synaptic change of correlated and uncorrelated spikes are compared.
As the frequencies of pre- and postsynaptic spikes increase, the interspike period
decreases and when this becomes comparable to the timescale of the STDP window
(which is related to the trace timescale), the pairwise approximation will break down
since interactions can no longer be neglected. When both the pre- and postsynaptic
frequencies are on the order of 10Hz the average time between a pre- and a postsynaptic spike is on the order of 50ms and interactions are to be expected. This is where
the particular models for the underlying dynamics will differ. Also in the work by
Izhikevich et al. (2003), the authors show with their Nearest-neighbor Implementation
that synaptic change goes from general depression (in the all-to-all implementation)
to BCM-like, when they consider only the closest previous and posterior postsynaptic
spike to each presynaptic spike to compute the linear sum of pairs.
This choice, which at first glance would seem an approximation independent of any
underlying dynamics, actually has strong implications for the biological underpinnings
that could actually implement this algorithm. A first neighbor approximation requires
to hard reset any traces possibly present, forgetting completely anything that happened
outside that window. The nearest-neighor implementation has, in addition not the aim

29

to explain triplet non-linearities as the PrePostPre triplet protocol.
The interspike interaction is in our model driven by the undelying traces. We have
chosen in our simulation to use for the frequency-dependence protocol the same parameters obtained from pairwise and triplet fits. As observed in cortical PostPrePost
triplets, strong suppression severely limits potentiation of further spikes (compare PostPrePost to linear superposition results). At high frequencies triplet interactions become
relevant and the same suppression should then be evidenced for frequency dependent
plasticity. We believe then, that any model aiming to reproduce time-dependent plasticity up to triplet order as measured by Froemke et al. (2002), should show depression
also for high frequencies in cortical neurons.

5.2 Plasticity induced by correlated spikes
So far we have analyzed the effect of uncorrelated spikes on the synaptic weight change
both in hippocampal and in cortical neurons (Figs. 8 and 9). It is however interesting to
see the predictions of the model for a strong synapse driving the postsynaptic neuron.
In this case pre- and postsynaptic spikes should be correlated, at least partially, together
with a certain positive delay.
To reproduce this effect with our model, we simulated trains of correlated spikes
where, with each presynaptic spike, a postsynaptic spike can occur with probability p,
after a certain delay d. As an example, if every presynaptic spike triggers a postsynaptic
spike then p = 1. This would mean, however that the postsynaptic frequency fpost
changes with p (fpost = p fpre ). In order to compare our results for different values
of p and keep fpost independent of p, we complete the train of postsynaptic spikes

30

with Poisson spikes of frequency (1 − p)fpre . In this way, fpost is independent of p,
which now regulates the degree of correlation between pre- and postsynaptic spikes:
p = 0 represents the fully decorrelated case, since all the postsynaptic spikes are drawn
from the poisson distribution, and p = 1 represents the fully correlated case already
mentioned.
In Fig. 10 we present the synaptic changes produced by trains spikes for different
values of p. In this case, results for a delay of 5ms are presented. The same tests were
performed with delays from 2ms to 10ms with only quantitative but not qualitative
differences.
We observe in Fig. 10, both for hippocampal and cortical neurons, that correlated
spike trains induce an increasing amount of potentiation for low to intermediate frequencies (∼ 1 − 10Hz). In the correlated scenario, and since in this case we are simulating a driving synapse, postsynaptic spikes follow presynaptic spikes in a causal order.
When the frequency is higher than 10Hz, the interspike period becomes comparable to
the STDP time window and each postsynaptic spike will also ”see” the following presynaptic spike, thus triggering the LTD term. Depending on the trace saturation constants,
LTD or LTP will eventually dominate for large frequencies. If LTD dominates, depression results and after a certain reversal frequency the behavior is switched from Hebbian
to Anti-Hebbian. This is the case for the triplet fitted values presented in Fig. 10.
It is important to note that the model is also able to produce Hebbian behavior within
the entire physiological range of activities by changing yc . The smaller the saturation
effects are, the larger this reversal frequency becomes. In fact, with the second set of
parameters used in Fig. 8 b), no such reversal is found within physiological frequencies

If observed, such a reversal, which is yet another side of the suppression effect,
would have the benefit of being self-stabilizing, tuning synaptic strength to help keep
neural activities bound.
The kink observable for the fully correlated curve (p = 1.0) of 10 b) results from
the particularly strong suppression effects in cortical neurons, captured in our model by

32

yb < yc . For frequencies above a certain threshold (∼ 28Hz) the trace concentration y
is always below the yc and LTP never triggers.
A fundamental difference between plots a) and b) is the different qualitative behavior between correlated and uncorrelated spikes. While in hippocampal neurons,
Hebbian, increasing potentiation, is always present for low to intermediate frequencies
(whether the spikes are correlated or not), in cortical neurons, our model predicts uncorrelated spikes always produce depression and therefor Hebbian learning requires the
neurons to be at least partially correlated.

6 Comparison to other models
The problem of formulating plasticity in terms of the specific timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes can be approached at different levels of detail and accuracy, ranging
from simplistic phenomenological rules to detailed and complex models describing the
different steps of the biological machinery responsible for STDP. In sections 3 and 4 the
comparison of our model to simple forms of phenomenological rules has already been
established, noting that linear combinations of spike pairs are generically not sufficient
to explain the experimentally observed triplet non-linearities.
We have also shown that, while linear combinations of pairs, plus additional suppression, is enough to explain the triplet nonlinearities of cortical neurons, as shown
in Froemke et al. (2002), hippocampal triplet non-linearities cannot be explained by
suppression and a trace accumulation mechanism seems to be taking place in these
synapses. In any case, this kind of phenomenological rules are not likely to gener-

33

alize well to arbitrary spike patterns since no information of the underlying plasticity
mechanism is present in the formulation.
Other models, like Albers et al. (2013) and Pfister et al. (2006), present interesting
dynamical formulations of plasticity in terms of generic decaying markers or traces,
but do not attempt to establish a link to the biological underpinnings of STDP. Calcium concentration and NMDA receptors have been shown to play a central role in
time-dependent LTP and LTD, and we therefore believe it is important to formulate
plasticity in those terms. Our model, though simplified, is formulated in terms of these
key ingredients and may therefore help to bridge the worlds of functional and realistic
models.
An alternative approach has been proposed by Appleby et al. (2007), where plasticity is described in an ensemble-based formulation. The authors there argue that the
observed synaptic changes produced by standard protocols cannot be explained at a single synapse level, but rather state that the observed results arise at a population level.
The authors then show how the pairwise STDP curve can be recovered at the ensemble
level from all or nothing potentiation or depression at the single synapse level. The
dependency of the model to the specific timing of triplets is however in this case not
computed.
The model we present in this work belongs to the family of calcium-based spikingneuron models. Within this family, models formulating synaptic plasticity exclusively
in terms of the calcium levels (Uramoto et al., 2013; Graupner et al., 2012), while tuned
to reproduce a variety of experimental results, tend to show paradoxical results when
tested in other setups. The model presented by Uramoto et al. (2013), for example,

34

predicts synaptic changes even when only postsynaptic spikes are present. The model
in Graupner et al. (2012), in turn, shows plasticity also when either pre- or postsynaptic
spikes are absent, since both pre- and postsynaptic spikes contribute directly to the
calcium level in this model, without the need of coincidence. To avoid this, in our
model we demand the simultaneous presence of both pre- and postsynaptic spikes for
plasticity to arise, being proportional to the products of traces x and y in our rule. We
believe this to be an important feature for simulations in situations of complex spike
patterns where the pre- and postsynaptic firing rates do not necessarily match.

7 Discussion
We propose a basic trace model for timing-dependent plasticity that incorporates, in
a first order approximation, the fundamental mechanisms acknowledged to be taking
place in STDP. We show that the model successfully captures several main features
of time-dependent plasticity, including the standard shape for low frequency pairing,
experimentally observed triplet nonlinearities, and large frequency effects.
The decay constants for the two traces and the relative intensities of LTP and LTD
can be extracted directly from the standard STDP curves, as measured for isolated pairs.
The model is left hereafter with only three further parameters, which can be used to fit
higher order contributions to plasticity. The model successfully reproduces the distinct
and contrasting nonlinearities found in both hippocampal cultures and cortical slices.
While the model predicts a similar frequency dependence for correlated (or partially
correlated) pre- and postsynaptic spikes both for hippocampal and cortical neurons,

35

the effect of uncorrelated spikes (although smaller) differs qualitatively in these two
types of neurons. In this case, the sign of the resulting plasticity depends for lower
frequencies on the overall area of the pairwise STDP curve, resulting in potentiation for
hippocampal neurons and depression in cortical ones, and for higher frequencies on the
balance between spike suppression and trace accumulation.
We show that the model is able to reproduce typical frequency-dependencies for
uncorrelated spikes, while fitting pairwise and triplet hippocampal parameters. We do
also find, that fitting triplet results for L2/3 cortical neurons invariably leads to depression, for higher frequencies and of uncorrelated spikes, contrary to observations in L5
neurons. The question then arises, to which extent plasticity results for different neurons, or performed under different stimulation conditions, can be expected to match. It
seems then essential to have available a consistent sets of experiments where pairwise,
triplet, and frequency results are measured for the same type of neuron and with the
same stimulation protocol. Otherwise one runs the risk of possibly trying to build a
complete picture out of mismatching parts. In this sense, we hope that our predictions
serve as a motivation to revisit and to complete triplet and frequency dependent studies
for different types of neurons.
In order to compare our results with rate encoding plasticity models, we have also
shown, by setting the presynaptic frequency to a constant value, that the amount of
synaptic change is proportional, for hippocampal neurons, to the product of the activities, with a threshold that depends on the presynaptic firing rate. While the system lacks
a longer term average threshold, as the one present in BCM, the presynaptic activity acts
as a value of reference for the significant level of activity. If the postsynaptic activity

36

exceeds this level then potentiation occurs, otherwise, depression arises.
For correlated spikes, we have shown that the model leads to similar results for hippocampal and cortical neurons, with an initial hebbian behavior for small to medium
frequencies and, depending on choice for the parameters, a reversal to anti-hebbian behavior for large frequencies, which could have the virtue of being self-limiting, avoiding
runaway growth of synaptic connections. It has been shown recently (Echeveste et al.,
2014), that this self-limitation results naturally, for rate encoding neurons, from the
stationarity principle for Hebbian learning. By tuning the value of yc , the reversal frequency can be made larger, to the point of producing Hebbian behavior within the entire
physiological range of activities.
The simplicity of the here proposed model makes it a useful tool for simulations and
studies of the dynamical properties of networks adapted via these rules. Firstly, the calculations required are straightforward, making it computing time efficient. The relative
small number of free parameters and their direct link to both the biophysical properties
of the postsynaptic complex and to the dynamical features of the trace dynamics makes
it suitable when studying the interplay between neural and synaptic dynamics in neural
systems.

Appendix: Dimensionality Analysis
In section 2 we could have started by initially denoting by x′ and y ′ the fraction of
NMDA receptors and the Ca2+ concentration, respectively, where the time evolution of
these traces is written as:


P

 ẋ′ = − x′ + c1 Ex σ δ(t − tσpre )
τx

(16)


P

 ẏ ′ = − y′ + (c2 x′ + yc′ )Ey σ δ(t − tσpost )
τy

where τy and τx represent the time constants in the decay of x′ and y ′, and now two
additional parameters c1 and c2 are included. c1 represents the increase in x′ caused by
a single presynaptic spike (which in this simplified model we assume constant) and c2
represents the increase, per unit of x′ , in y ′ concentration. yc′ is the constant contribution
per postsynaptic spike to y ′ of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Again a spike efficacy
E is included that limits trace concentrations, where E is still calculated as in (2).
Now, by a change of variables:

x = x′ /c1 ,

xb = x′b /c1 ,

y = y ′/c1 c2 ,

yc = yc′ /c1 c2 ,

yb = yb′ /c1 c2
(17)

we re-write (16) as:


P

 ẋ = − x + Ex σ δ(t − tσpre )
τx


P

 ẏ = − y + (x + yc )Ey σ δ(t − tσpost )
τy

which is the exactly the expression presented in section 2. By this procedure we
have reduced the number of parameters for the trace evolution to 5.
