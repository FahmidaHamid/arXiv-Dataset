We describe general characteristics of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron’s response to a periodic train
of short current pulses with Gaussian noise. The deterministic neuron is bistable for antiresonant
frequencies. When the stimuli arrive at the resonant frequency the firing rate is a continuous function
of the current amplitude I0 and scales as (I0 − Ith )1/2 , characteristic of a saddle-node bifurcation
at the threshold Ith . Intervals of continuous irregular response alternate with integer mode-locked
regions with bistable excitation edge. There is an even-all multimodal transition between the 2:1
and 3:1 states in the vicinity of the main resonance, which is analogous to the odd-all transition
discovered earlier in the high-frequency regime. For I0 < Ith and small noise the firing rate has a
maximum at the resonant frequency. For larger noise and subthreshold stimulation the maximum
firing rate initially shifts toward lower frequencies, then returns to higher frequencies in the limit
of large noise. The stochastic coherence antiresonance, defined as a simultaneous occurrence of (i)
the maximum of the coefficient of variation, and (ii) the minimum of the firing rate vs. the noise
intensity, occurs over a wide range of parameter values, including monostable regions. Results of
this work can be verified experimentally.

INTRODUCTION

The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model [1] is a prime example of a resonant neuron. It was originally developed to
explain experimental properties of the squid giant axon.
Its behavior under the influence of constant, periodic [2–
6] and irregular external current [7] has been studied extensively. It also served as a starting point for a number
of reduced models [8–10], designed to preserve the key
features, while being more amenable to large-scale numerical simulations. However, a full understanding of
all qualitative properties of its solutions has not been
achieved yet.
Deterministic HH equations can have both periodic
and aperiodic, sometimes chaotic solutions [11]. Theoretical [12–14] and experimental [3, 13] analysis revealed
that near the excitation threshold two solutions, the fixed
point and the limit cycle, may coexist. A simple such example is the HH model driven by a constant current. As
the current magnitude is increased the neuron starts responding at a preferred frequency, which is close to 50
Hz for the original HH parameter set.
The HH neuron in the presence of noise may display either resonant or antiresonant behavior, depending on the
signal magnitude, frequency, and noise. The enhancement of weak signals by noise is known as stochastic resonance [15–17]. The opposite effect, stochastic antiresonance, in which a neuron’s firing frequency is slowed
down or even entirely stopped at some intermediate noise
level, received some attention [18–20] recently. Depending on model parameters this behavior is associated with
bistability [18, 19] or multimodality of the response [21].
A relation between bistability and antiresonance in integrator neurons was also studied recently [22].
In two previous papers on the HH model driven by periodic sequence of short stimuli, we have shown that there

is a transition between odd-only and all modes at high
frequencies [21, 23]. This transition is located between
the locked-in regions 2:1 and 3:1. The notation p : q
means q output spikes for every p input current pulses.
The edges of individual modes scale logarithmically in
the vicinity of this singularity. This theoretical analysis
agrees well with experimental data [24]. A natural question to ask is whether we can identify analogous parity
transition, involving even-only modes on one side and all
modes on the other side of the transition. A preliminary
study [25] showed that the even and odd modes compete
also near the main resonance. In the following we analyze
the resonance regime in detail, looking for signatures of
the even-all transition.
Our aim is to map the response diagram of the HH
neuron to a train of brief current pulses, rather than emulate typical in vivo scenarios. Stimuli in the form of brief
pulses are better suited to reveal the internal dynamics
of the neuron than signals varying on the time scale of
the main resonance. In the case of the often used constant or sinusoidal input currents the neuron dynamics is
obscured by the drive that is always different from zero.
Gaussian noise is added to the model in order to reveal
additional features of the model’s dynamics. Although
this particular type of randomness may not necessarily
occur in a neuronal system we believe similar results will
be obtained for any fast-varying irregular component of
the stimulus.

THE MODEL AND RESULTS

We consider the stochastic HH model with the classic
parameter set and rate constants [1],

der resonance is present at Ti ≃ 34ms and the third one
at Ti ≃ 51ms (not shown). The dotted line separates
the region with a single solution from the area where
two solutions coexist. Bistable solutions appear between
the resonant regions near Ti = 11ms and Ti = 23ms.
In these regimes the transition to excitability occurs via
the subcritical Hopf bifurcation. The picture is more
complicated at the frequencies above 250 Hz, where the
quiescent state often coexists not with a limit cycle but
with a set of irregular orbits. The boundaries of bistable
regions are determined with a simple continuation algorithm. The initial conditions of each run with a new
value of a bifurcation parameter are equal to the end
values from the previous iteration.
The firing rate fo /fi depends continuously on I0 between the tip of the resonance at Ti ≃ 17ms and the
bistable area, which begins at Ti ≃ 20ms. Here fo , fi
is output, input frequency, respectively. For 14ms <
Ti < 17ms bistable intervals with integer p/q ratio alternate with irregular response, whose long-time average is
a continuous function of I0 and Ti . Earlier, Clay reported
[27] an irregular graded response near the excitation edge
within a revised HH model [28] stimulated by 1-ms rectangular current pulses and trains of half-sine waves. This
variability was attributed to the deterministic nonlinear
dynamics of the model.

FIG. 1: Response diagram in the noiseless case for stimulation
by rectangular current pulses of width τ = 0.6ms and height
I0 . The top (bottom) panel shows the high (intermediate)
frequency regime. Bistable regions are marked ”b”. Some
smaller bistable areas remain unlabeled. They are limited by
a dotted line from above and a solid line from below. Labels 1,2,3, and 4 mark regions with 1:1,2:1,3:1, and 4:1 mode
locking, respectively. The resonance area near Ti = 17ms is
dominated by the 3:1 state and higher order states. The second resonance near Ti = 34ms is dominated by the 2:1 mode.
Higher modes appear near the threshold at Ti ≃ 34ms.

where noise is given by the Gaussian process < ξi (t) >=
0, < ξ(t)ξ(t′ ) >= 2Dδ(t − t′ ), and D is expressed in
mV2 /ms. IN a , IK , IL , and Iapp , are the sodium, potassium, leak, and external current, respectively. C =
1µF/cm2 is the membrane capacitance. The input current is a periodic set of rectangular steps of height I0
and width 0.6ms, which is an order of magnitude below the resonant pulse width [20] and does not interfere with the neuron’s internal dynamics. The deterministic (stochastic) HH equations are integrated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm (the secondorder stochastic Runge-Kutta algorithm [26]), respectively. The simulations are carried out with the time step
of 0.001ms and are run for 400s, discarding the initial 4s.
Figure 1 shows the response diagram in the Ti − I0
plane without noise, where Ti is the stimulus period. The
main resonance is located at Ti ≃ 17ms. The second or-

height at the resonance Ti = 17.5ms. Here τ = 0.6ms. Near
the firing threshold fo is approximately a square root function
of the pulse amplitude. Further away from the threshold the
dependence of fo on I0 between the mode-locked states is
irregular and nonmonotonic.

For Ti ≥ 17ms the firing rate is approximately a square
root function of the deviation from the threshold current
amplitude (see Fig. 2). This dependence is characteristic of a saddle-node bifurcation [29]. The scaling fo /fi ∼
(I0 − It h)β , with β = 1/2 is reminiscent of a mean-field
second-order phase transition, with fo /fi playing the role
of an order parameter. The same exponent is obtained
2
for a relaxation time near Ic ≃ 6.264µA/cm for a constant current I [30], where Ic is the value of I at the
saddle-node bifurcation. Below Ic the neuron returns

transition between even-only and all modes. The applied current pulses are shown with dotted lines. There is only one
odd multiple (7:1) of the input period in this sample. Here
Ti = 13.9ms and I0 = 10.75µA/cm2 .

Borders of even (odd) mode-locked states are shown with broken (continuous) lines respectively. The dotted lines mark the
transitions to repetitive firing. Areas enclosed by the dotted

to quiescence after emitting a series of spikes. The relaxation time, defined as the time from the first to the
last spike, diverges as (Ic − I)∆ , where ∆ ≃ 1/2. Similar values of ∆ were obtained for the Morris-Lecar and
FitzHugh-Nagumo models [30].
Figure 3 shows the bifurcation diagram near the tip
of the resonance. The synchronized states alternate with
irregular firing. There are small bistable regions where
the quiescent state coexists with a limit cycle. We have
calculated their boundaries for states up to order 5:1.
It is likely that they extend all the way to the tip of
the resonance. The behavior in the intermediate regions
is chaotic due to a competition between odd and even
modes [23]. An example of V (t) dependence for a point
located between states 2:1 and 3:1 is shown in Fig. 4.
This sample contains only one odd multiple of the input
period. Odd interspike intervals vanish in the vicinity of
the 2:1 state. Careful analysis of the interspike interval
histograms (ISIH) reveals a transition between the set of
even and the set of all modes. This parity transition of
ISIHs in the HH model could be tested experimentally in
a squid axon experiment, similar to the odd-all transition
discovered earlier [21, 24].
The transition between quiescence and chaotic firing
marked by the dotted line in the intermediate zones between the locked-in states occurs via period doubling (see
Fig. 5). The lowest and the highest values of V below
Ti ≃ 13.24ms belong to the 2:1 limit cycle. The line
slightly below V = −65mV, splitting above Ti = 13ms,
is associated with the steady state.
The even, odd multiples of Ti dominate near the states
with even, odd p/q ratio, respectively (see Fig. 6, left).
This is a general property of regimes of irregular firing.
Starting from the 2:1 mode, the histogram weight is grad-

ually transferred to the 4:1 mode, which dominates for Ti
slightly below the even-all transition point Tea . On the
other side of Tea , h5 = 1 over a narrow interval.
The histogram of the dominant modes for D > 0 is
shown in Fig. 6 (right). Some weight is now transferred
to lower modes. The 4:1 and 5:1 modes are still well
pronounced over a range of Ti but they are now mixed
with 2:1 and 3:1 modes, respectively. Noise extends the
range of presence of high order modes around Tea , as
expected.
The average firing rate between nearby n:1 and (n+1):1
states often has a narrow local minimum due to the presence of slower modes. The minima are more pronounced
near the excitation threshold along the left edge of the
resonance tip in Fig. 3, where Ti < 17ms. One such
valley is shown in Fig. 7. Here the 4:1 mode dominates
in a narrow range of parameter values below the parity
transition.
The firing rate minimum is robust to small levels of

noise, as can be seen in Fig. 8. The minimum of fo
occurs for Ti & Tea , where modes of both parity are
available. In the odd-all transition of the high-frequency
regime [23] the minimum fo was similarly located close
to the transition, on the side of all modes.
It is well known that the HH neuron has a tendency to
spike in bursts when subjected to a noisy stimulus in a

bistable regime. If the deterministic system is prepared in
one of high order bistable states from Fig. 3, the addition
of noise results in slow bursts, where the ISI within a
burst is a high integer multiple of Ti . An example is
shown in Fig. 9, where each burst’s ISI is equal to 3Ti .
We expect slow bursts of order 6:1 and higher to be found
in a more detailed calculation.
For stimuli below the deterministic threshold noise ac-

form of response consists of 3:1 bursts separated by longer

D = 10−3 .

tivates firing with maximum response at the resonant frequency (see Fig. 10). When noise is larger, excitations
into the 2:1 state occur more frequently and the maximum of the firing rate shifts toward Ti = 20ms. This
maximum is a result of the interplay between the 1:1
mode and the 2:1 mode. The relative frequency of participation of the 2:1 mode grows sharply for intermediate
noise levels in the neighborhood of the bistable regime
for Ti ≃ 20ms.
For signals with a periodic subthreshold component
noise may play the role of a frequency selector. In a network with some elements firing in unison at the resonant
frequency the remaining uncorrelated neurons also play
an important role. The intensity of their background activity may select the firing rate of a network.
The dependence of CV on Ti for fixed noise intensity
is shown in Fig. 11. As expected, the most coherent
response occurs near the resonance. The minimum near
Ti = 20ms for suprathreshold inputs follows the left edge
of the 1:1 region from Fig. 1. For stimuli below threshold
there is a deep minimum at the resonance and a large
maximum in the bistable regime for Ti > 20ms.
For suprathreshold stimulation in the resonance regime
the firing rate in general increases monotonically as a
function of D with the exception of states having p/q

values close to 1 (see Fig. 11). Starting in the 1:1 state
at D = 0, increasing noise slows down the response by
annihilating some of the action potential spikes. The
minimum fo /fi is reached at an intermediate D. In the
limit of large noise fo approaches the inverse of the refractory period. The CV maxima are caused by redistribution of histogram weight among several principal modes.
This effect was described earlier as stochastic coherence
antiresonance [21]. Maximization of spike train incoherence was shown earlier to occur in the FitzHugh-Nagumo
[31] and leaky integrate-and-fire [32] models. However in
those studies the maxima of CV were not accompanied
by the minima of fo /fi .
Figure 13 shows the response diagram in the presence of noise. The tip of the resonance is broadened
and shifted to higher frequencies. The 3:1 state vanishes
completely for D slightly larger than 10−3 . Higher-order
states are more sensitive to noise and are quickly washed
out. The bistable area at the edge of the 2:1 state shrinks
more gradually. When bistability is finally eliminated,
fo remains discontinuous over part of that border. For
D = 10−2 the discontinuity occurs below Ti ≃ 10.5ms.
Above Ti ≃ 10.5ms the firing rate is a continuous function of I0 . The behavior in the immediate vicinity of
Ti = 10.5ms seems to be weakly irregular. A more detailed study would be needed for a proper description of
this area. The loss of stability by the 2:1 state in favor
of the quiescent state and further transition to bursting
are illustrated in Fig. 14.
The reaction to noise at high frequencies is qualitatively different from behavior at near-resonant frequencies (see Fig. 15). In the top panel of Fig. 15 the firing
rate drops almost everywhere for small D. This is easy to
understand if we recall that the odd-all multimodal tran2
sition [21, 23] occurs just below I0 = 20µA/cm . The
slow modes are easily available in this regime and small
perturbations suffice to switch the system among different trajectories. The firing rate drops over the entire 3:1
plateau due to the appearance of the 5:1, 7:1 and other

boundaries for D = 10−3 and 10−2 , respectively.

values of I0 and Ti = 17ms. Maximum of CV at intermediate

intervals.

odd modes. For larger D also the even modes are sampled by the system and fo /fi increases.
At moderate, near-resonance frequencies, the central
part of the 2:1 plateau in the lower part of Fig. 15 is
more robust to noise. The average fo is preserved for D
up to 0.1. Noise induces both the 1:1 mode as well as the
3:1 and slower modes. However the participation rate of
the 1:1 mode is balanced by the slower modes in such a
way that average fo /fi remains close to 2. This type of
resilience to noise, characteristic of the resonance regime,
can also be seen in other mode-locked states.
Finally, let us briefly describe the role played by the
current pulse width τ . Figure 16 shows the excitation threshold as a function of τ for a resonant drive,
Ti = 17ms. Initially the threshold decreases as the inverse of τ . For τ > 8ms the tip of the resonance (shown
in Fig. 3) gradually becomes narrower and vanishes.
The threshold rises again and reaches maximum near
τ = 17ms, when I(t) = const. Bistability appears above
τ ≃ 16ms. It is clear that stimulation by a constant current forces the neuron into an antiresonant regime. The
bifurcation diagram in Fig. 16 implies that the addition of any charge-unbalanced component to the constant
stimulus takes the system away from this antiresonant
limit. The precise nature of such a component, whether
deterministic or stochastic, is not important. What mat-

CONCLUSIONS

We studied the response of the HH neuron to a periodic
pulse current with a Gaussian noise. The global bifurca-

the response is initially slowed down over an entire plateau,
starting from both edges. At the lower diagram fo is held
steady in the central part of the plateau, decreasing at the

rate in the central part of the plateau is preserved up to D ≃
0.1. The irregular nonmonotonic behavior in the deterministic
case is smoothed out for very small levels of noise.

tion diagram in the Ti − I0 plane has a rich structure
near the excitation threshold, where resonant regimes alternate with antiresonant ones. The model is bistable between the resonances and in the limit of high-frequency
stimulation.
The firing rate is a continuous function of I0 for
Tres . Ti < 20ms. The scaling of the firing rate with
(I0 − Ith )1/2 is a signature of a saddle-node bifurcation
at the threshold. For Ti . Tres bistable regions are separated by areas of irregular response with no well defined
threshold and approximately continuous dependence of
fo /fi on input parameters. As Ti approaches Tres from
below, the subcritical Hopf bifurcation gradually softens.
Bistable regions occupy smaller portions of the parameter space and disappear before Ti = Tres . The change
of the type of neuronal excitability is important in the
context of preventing the so called dynamical diseases,
such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.

It was shown in the HH [33, 34] and the Hindmarsh-Rose
[35] models that this could be obtained by introducing an
additional control function. We demonstrated that the
threshold behavior can also be altered by selecting the
frequency and amplitude of external current.
For subthreshold stimuli noise enables spiking in the
vicinity of the resonance. The stimulus frequency, for
which the maximum firing rate is obtained, depends on
the magnitude of noise. For large D, the maximum fo occurs for Ti > Tres . It would be interesting to investigate
the same regime in a HH network where the connectivity
pattern of neurons as well as their individual properties
might lead to the emergence of subpopulations of neurons
firing with different average frequencies in response to a
correlated input with background noise. It was shown
earlier by several authors that both the background noisy
activity [36, 37] and correlated inputs [38] are important
in explaining the neuronal response in vivo. Qualitative
results of this work do not depend on the precise functional form of the current pulse provided the width of
each pulse does not exceed 4 ms. This invariance of the
bifurcation diagram in the Ti − I0 plane is not surprising because for short pulses the HH neuron’s threshold is
determined by the amount of charge delivered per pulse
[39].
We have also found a new even-all multimodal transition occurring between the states 2:1 and 3:1 close to the
main resonance. For input period Ti below this singularity only even response modes exist. Both even and odd
modes appear above the transition. This effect is accompanied by a minimum of the firing rate, located close to
the parity transition, on the side of all modes. Similar
transitions may exist in other excitable systems.
Our results are also relevant to studies of auditory

8
nerve fiber responses to electric stimulation [40–43]. At
low stimulation rates auditory nerve fibers fire regularly
and are locked in to applied stimulus. At high stimulation
rates these fibers respond irregularly. Some researchers
attributed this effect to physiological noise [44, 45]. However, an analysis within the FitzHugh-Nagumo model
showed that the firing irregularities at high frequencies
may be caused by deterministic dynamical instability
[42, 43]. We have found similar instabilities in the HH
model. They appear at high stimulation frequencies and

along the excitation threshold. Both of these regimes are
relevant to studies of hearing sensitivity.
