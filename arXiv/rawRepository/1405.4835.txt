Abstract

exchange of oxygen and nutrients takes place at the surface
of the villous tree. We aim to understand how the geometry
of the villous tree affects the placenta exchange function.

We present a stream-tube model of oxygen exchange inside
a human placenta functional unit (a placentone). The effect of villi density on oxygen transfer efficiency is assessed
by numerically solving the diffusion-convection equation in a
2D+1D geometry for a wide range of villi densities. For each
set of physiological parameters, we observe the existence of an
optimal villi density providing a maximal oxygen uptake as a
trade-off between the incoming oxygen flow and the absorbing
villus surface. The predicted optimal villi density 0.47 ± 0.06
is compatible to previous experimental measurements. Several other ways to experimentally validate the model are also
proposed. The proposed stream-tube model can serve as a basis for analyzing the efficiency of human placentas, detecting
possible pathologies and diagnosing placental health risks for
newborns by using routine histology sections collected after
birth.

The normal development of the baby largely depends on
the ability of the placenta to efficiently transfer oxygen, nutrients and other substances. Both placenta weight and
placenta-fetus weight ratio are associated with the newborns
health (Hutcheon et al., 2012, Teng et al., 2012). Moreover,
“fetal origins of adult health” research has identified links between placenta size and risk of heart disease in adults (Barker,
1995).
Routinely stained 2D histology sections of the placenta collected after birth (Fig. 2) may provide valuable insights into
its function during pregnancy. Figure 2 illustrates our basic
idea: random sampling of a normal placenta (Fig. 2B) contains intervillous space (IVS) and villous tree sections in “normal” proportions (which allow efficient function), whereas
pre-eclamptic (Fig. 2A, disproportionally large IVS, rare villi)
and diabetic (Fig. 2C, denser and larger villi) cases exhibit a
very different geometry.
Assessing the relation between the placenta structure and
its function is problematic because (i) it is unethical to manipulate the human placenta in vivo; (ii) histological and physiological features commonly co-vary (e.g. changes in villi dis-

Introduction

The human placenta is the sole organ of exchange between
the mother and the growing fetus. It consists of two principal
components: (i) fetal chorionic villi, and (ii) the intervillous
blood basin in which maternal blood flows (Fig. 1). The placenta fetal villi have a tree-like structure and are immersed
in the maternal blood basin anchoring to the basal plate and
supporting the placenta shape (Benirschke et al., 2006). Fetal
arterial blood goes from the umbilical arteries to the capillaries inside the villi and returns to the umbilical vein, while maternal blood percolates outside this arboreous structure. The

and physiological parameters. The results are compared to
published histomorphometric measurements near term (Aherne and Dunnill, 1966, Lee and Mayhew, 1995, Mayhew and

tribution alter the blood flow); (iii) quantitative histological
analysis of the placenta structure can only be performed postpartum when maternal blood flow (MBF) and fetal blood flow
have ceased. Mathematical modeling and numerical simulations are in this case valuable tools to gain deeper insights
into the in vivo functioning of the placenta.
Mathematical models of the human and animal placenta
function have been proposed for at least 60 years (see discussions in Aifantis, 1978, Battaglia and Meschia, 1986,
Chernyavsky et al., 2010, Gill et al., 2011). Previous models mainly focused either on a single villus scale or on the
whole placenta scale (different kinds of the flat wall exchanger
model: Bartels et al., 1962, Gill et al., 2011, Groome, 1991, Hill
et al., 1973, Kirschbaum and Shapiro, 1969, Lardner, 1975,
Longo et al., 1972, Shapiro et al., 1967, Wilbur et al., 1978);
several studies dealt with flow patterns (co-orientation of
maternal and fetal flows: Bartels et al., 1962, Battaglia and
Meschia, 1986, Faber, 1969, Guilbeau et al., 1970, Kirschbaum
and Shapiro, 1969, Metcalfe et al., 1964, Moll, 1972, Schröder,
1982, Shapiro et al., 1967); other works represented the placenta as a porous medium (Chernyavsky et al., 2010, Erian
et al., 1977, Schmid-Schönbein, 1988), restricted, with one exception (Chernyavsky et al., 2010), to one or two dimensions.
Some efforts have been devoted to understanding the relation
between morphometric data and gas transfer in 1D in terms
of diffusing capacity (see Mayhew et al., 1986 and references
therein).
Better understanding of the transfer function of the placenta requires a model of the 3D geometry of the organ on
a larger scale than a few villi, predictions of which could be
compared to experimental data. We use a simplified engineering representation of the complex system in order to reveal
the most relevant transport mechanisms.
The driving questions of our placenta modeling are:

Mathematical model

2.1

Outline

Our 3D STPM is inspired by the observation that the human placenta resembles “a closed cubical room supported
by cylindrical pillars running from floor to ceiling” (Lee
and Mayhew, 1995). The model consists of a large cylinder (Fig. 3A) representing a stream tube along which maternal blood flows (Fig. 3C). This cylinder contains multiple
smaller parallel cylinders which represent fetal villi (terminal
and mature intermediate), filled with fetal blood. In this paper, we consider these small cylinders to be of identical sizes,
while their lateral spacings are randomly distributed (with
no cylinders overlap). This technical assumption can be easily relaxed in order to treat routinely stained 2D histological
sections of the placenta.
Our model relies on the following assumptions:
1. The large cylinder corresponds to an idealized unfolded
stream tube of maternal blood, extending from the boundary of the central cavity to a decidual vein (Fig. 3C). Every portion of arterial blood coming into placenta has its
own stream tube, along which blood exchanges oxygen
with fetal villi and gradually becomes venous. The contorted axis of a stream tube follows the maternal blood
flow. The length of a tube can vary from one region to
another, but is expected to be of the order of placental
disk thickness (see Appendix A for more details);

• What are the relevant parameters (geometrical and physiological) that govern oxygen transfer efficiency?

2. The stream-tube has the same cross-section along its
axis. In fact, we aim to base our STPM on histological slides (like those shown in Fig. 2), which give us
only one section of a stream tube without any information about how this section changes along it. We then
suppose that the same integral characteristics, such as
the density or the perimeter of villi, are preserved along
the same tube. This is obviously an oversimplification of
the irregular 3D structure of the placenta, but it is the
most straightforward assumption given the lack of the

velocity or oxygen content of blood), is there an “optimal” villous tree geometry which maximizes the oxygen
uptake?
In the following, we present a simplified stream-tube placenta model (STPM) of oxygen exchange. The mathematical equations governing oxygen transfer in the placentone

exchange is not modeled in the central cavity, but only after it, in the MBF pathway. The concept that spiral arteries open into the IVS
near the central cavity corresponds to the current physiological views (Benirschke et al., 2006, Chernyavsky et al., 2010).

faces), so that the velocity profile in any cross-section
is flat. This assumption is supported by calculations
obtained for capillary-tissue cylinders in brain (Reneau
et al., 1967). The brain model has been used to compare the effect of non-slip boundary conditions (and thus
a non-flat velocity profile) versus slip boundary conditions (and thus a flat velocity profile) on the distribution
of pO2 in a Krogh’s type cylindrical tissue layer. The
difference between the two cases in pO2 distribution was
less than 10 %. This strong assumption is discussed later
in the text;

complete 3D geometrical data with all spatially resolved
terminal and mature intermediate villi;
3. In any cross-section, oxygen is only redistributed by diffusion. The gradient of oxygen dissolved in the blood
plasma, not the gradient of oxygen bound to hemoglobin,
determines the rate of oxygen diffusion in blood (Bartels et al., 1962). As oxygen has low solubility in blood,
linear solubility (Henry’s law, Prausnitz et al., 1998) is
assumed;
4. Fetal blood is considered to act as a perfect oxygen sink.
This assumption means that we are studying oxygen partial pressure differences between the maternal and fetal
blood. Additionally, it supposes that fetal circulation is
efficient enough to rapidly carry away all oxygen that
is transferred from maternal blood. If villi are considered to be perfect sinks, there is no difference between
concurrent, counter-current blood flow patterns or any
other organization of the flow in this specific geometry.
The features of the fetal blood flow can therefore be disregarded, except that fetal blood flow rate is assumed to
be sufficient to maintain steep oxygen gradients for diffusion. In other words, the STPM separates the IVS geometry from capillary geometry inside the villi. Resistance
to oxygen transfer across the villus membrane, intravillous space and fetal capillary membranes are modeled by
an effective feto-maternal interface of finite permeability
calculated from the placental diffusing capacity;

7. Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is linearized in order to simplify the resolution of equations;
8. Erythrocytes are uniformly distributed in the IVS;
9. The solution is stationary, i.e. placental oxygen flow remains constant over time;
10. Blood flow matching does not occur, i.e. there is no influence (feedback) of oxygen uptake on the parameters of
the model (such as MBF velocity, see Talbert and Sebire, 2004). No redundancy of some of the fetal cylinders
when maternal IVS blood flow is reduced is taken into
account.

5. Oxygen uptake occurs at the feto-maternal interface, i.e.
at the boundaries of the small cylinders in Fig. 3A. It
is directly proportional to the interface permeability and
to the oxygen concentration on the maternal side of the
interface. This statement is a reformulation of Fick’s law
of diffusion, in which the rate of oxygen transfer across
the interface is proportional to the difference of partial
pressures (pO2 ) on both sides of the interface;

Solution of the model
Characteristic time scales of the transfer processes in the placenta

We identify three different physical transfer processes in the
placenta, each of which operates on a characteristic time scale:
hydrodynamic blood flow through the IVS characterized by
an average velocity u and transit time τtr ; diffusion of oxygen
with characteristic time τD ; and equilibration between oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in the blood
plasma with characteristic time τHb . This last thermodynamic equilibrium is described as equal partial pressure of
oxygen in both states. The three times can be estimated as
follows:

characteristic size of the exchange region (R) and the local
permeability of the feto-maternal interface (w) or the integral diffusing capacity of the organ (Dp ), the construction of
the STPM required several additional parameters to account
for a 2D placental section structure (compare, for example,
with Power et al., 1972). These are: (i) the linear maternal
blood flow velocity in the exchange region (u, in m/s), since
the usual integral flow (in ml/min) is not enough; (ii) the
volumetric density (φ) of small fetal villi in a given region;
and (iii) the effective radius of fetal villi (r), which accounts
for the non-circular shape of fetal villi by providing the right
volume-to-surface ratio.

• τtr , the transit time of blood through the IVS, is of the
order of 27 s from the results of angiographic studies at
term (Burchell, 1967, see Appendix A);
• τD , reflecting oxygen diffusion over a length δ in the IVS
is τD ∼ δ 2 /D, where D = (1.7±0.5)·10−9 m2 /s is oxygen
diffusivity in the blood plasma (Moore et al., 2000). Either from calculations (Mayhew and Jairam, 2000), or
directly from normal placenta sections (Fig. 2), mean
width of an IVS pore can be estimated as δ ∼ 80 µm,
yielding τD ∼ 4 s;

2.2.3

Numerical simulation

The diffusion-convection equation (B.5) is solved by a finite
R
elements method in Matlab
for various 2D villi distributions (Fig. 4). Villi distributions are generated in the range
of villi densities φ from 0.005 to 0.75. Villi density is defined as
the ratio of small villi cross-sectional area (Ssm.v ) to the total
area of the stream tube cross-section (Stot ): φ = Ssm.v /Stot .
These densities correspond to a range of villi numbers N
from 1 to 160 for a stream-tube of the radius Rnum . The
upper boundary of the range has been chosen close to the
maximal packing density of circles that one can achieve without resorting to special packing algorithms (Specht, 2009).

• τHb , an equilibration time scale, which includes the characteristic diffusion time for oxygen to reach Hb molecules
inside a red blood cell (∼ 10 ms Foucquier et al., 2013)
and a typical time of oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation (∼
20 ms for the slowest process, see Yamaguchi et al., 1985).
Together these times sum to τHb ∼ 30 ms.
These three characteristic times are related as follows: τHb 
τD . τtr . This relation suggests that oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation can be considered instantaneous as compared to diffusion and convection; the latter two, by contrast, should be
treated simultaneously. Further details of the solution of the
model can be found in Appendix B.

Results

Figure 5A shows the dependence of oxygen uptake of a single placentone on the length of the stream tube. One can
see that the villi density which provides the maximal oxygen
uptake, depends on the stream tube length, all other parameters remaining fixed. In other words, the most efficient geometry (the one which gives the highest uptake for a fixed
length, MBF velocity and incoming oxygen concentration) is
different for different stream tube lengths. The villi density
corresponding to the maximal uptake will be called “optimal”. The fact that there is an optimal villi density can be
clearly seen in Fig. 5B, which shows the variation of oxygen
uptake with villi density for a fixed stream tube length.
Both the maximal oxygen uptake and the corresponding optimal villi density depend on the average MBF velocity and
on the stream-tube length L, which are the parameters the
most susceptible to variations in different placentas and for
which no error estimations were available (see Appendix A).
If empirical distribution of MBF velocities in the IVS of the
human placenta were known, with the help of Fig. 6A, one
could estimate the optimal villi density that would result in the

Parameters of the model

The parameters necessary for the construction of the model
are listed in Table 1, while their calculation is reported in
Appendix A. Errors in the experimental parameters were estimated in cases when such information was available from the
source; no error assumptions were made in other cases. Relatively small stream-tube radius Rnum has been used to speed
up the computations, but all results have been rescaled to the
2
placentone radius R by multiplying the uptake by R2 /Rnum
.
Note that besides the parameters traditionally used for
modeling 1D exchange in the human placenta, namely: incoming (c0 ) and maximal oxygen concentrations (cmax ), diffusivity of oxygen in blood (D), solubility of oxygen in
blood (khn ), oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation coefficient (β60 ),

published histomorphometrical data according to the formula φ = Ssm.v /(Ssm.v + SIVS ), where Ssm.v is the crosssectional area of terminal and mature intermediate (small)
villi, and SIVS is the cross-sectional area of the IVS. In the
literature, Ssm.v and SIVS are traditionally obtained as surface area fractions of a 2D section and then multiplied by the
volume of the placenta to yield volumes of small villi (Vsm.v )
and IVS (VIVS ). Villi density can be calculated by the same
formula from these volumes: φ = Vsm.v /(Vsm.v + VIVS ) (Table 2). In cases when the fraction of terminal and mature
intermediate villi in the total villi volume was not available, we have used the average fraction of small villi volume
of α ≈ 0.665 in the total volume of the villi (Sen et al., 1979).
Note that these experimental data refer to placentas at term
since a morphometrical study of a placenta can be only performed post-partum.

maximal uptake in any given region. Conversely, if one knows
the average villi density in a placenta region (e.g., from histological slides) and if optimal placenta function is assumed,
one can estimate the MBF velocity in that region. The corresponding maximal oxygen uptake can be determined from
Fig. 6C. The dependence of the optimal characteristics on the
stream-tube length is shown in Figs 6B, 6D.
Our calculations show that for a healthy placenta (with the
parameters given in Table 1), the optimal villi density is φ0 =
0.47 ± 0.06 and the corresponding maximal oxygen uptake
is Fmax = (1.2±0.6)·10−6 mol/s ≈ 1.6±0.8 cm3 /min. Details
of the provided error estimations can be found in Appendix C.
It is worth nothing that to the precision of the calculations,
no dependence of the results on the diffusivity D of oxygen
was observed. Note also that since no experimental error data
was available for L and u, these variables were not included
in error calculation. The confidence intervals for φ0 and Fmax
are hence likely to be larger than the provided values.

Discussion

We have developed the STPM of oxygen exchange in the
human placenta that relates oxygen uptake to cross-section
histomorphometry obtained from routinely prepared placenta
slides. Our goal was to provide a model capable of identifying cases of suboptimal oxygen transfer from maternal to fetal
blood by histological analysis of a placenta post-partum. It
was shown that there is always an optimal villi density, at
which oxygen uptake is maximal, all other parameters being
fixed.
The optimal density is determined by a competition of two
factors. On one hand, larger villi density leads to larger exchange surface and thus larger uptake. On the other hand,
larger villi density implies that less blood is coming into the
placentone per unit of time, hence a lower uptake rate. For
a given set of the placenta-specific parameters (Table 1), our
model allows one to calculate the optimal villi density for a
given placenta or placenta region.

The optimal villi density 0.47±0.06 obtained in our model is
consistent with the experimental data which yield φ = 0.46 ±
0.06 (mean ± SD). The quantitative agreement of the model’s
predictions with physiological densities allows us to speculate
that normal placentas are optimal oxygen exchangers, while
pathological placentas (e.g. diabetic or pre-eclamptic) behave
sub-optimally. Although such an argument is plausible, further analysis is required. Evidence from sheep specifically
demonstrates a large reserve capacity for fetal oxygen supply, suggesting that variation in villi density and MBF velocity might be a normal tolerated biological process (Carter,
1989). A similar behavior has been demonstrated earlier in
human lungs, where lung geometry is not optimal under normal conditions, but its reserve capacity is used during exercises (Sapoval et al., 2002).

Comparison to experimental data

Our calculated optimal density can be compared to experimental data. The villi density φ can be determined from

to healthy ones. A possible reason of this mismatch is that
in the PMM the optimal villi density appears as a trade-off
between blood flow resistance and uniform uptake capacity of
an unspecified passively transported substance. We propose
a different explanation presenting the optimal villi density as
a trade-off between the absorbing surface of fetal villi and the
incoming flow of oxygen. In this claim, we underline the role
of the absorbing surface (which is hard to define in the PMM),
but also suggest the importance of oxygen transport as compared to the passive transport of an unspecified substance.
The two models offer two different points of view on modeling the human placenta, which we discuss below.

The experimental morphometrical analysis of the villi density in placenta sections post-partum may not represent precisely the in vivo situation due to the cease of maternal and
fetal blood flows and to the fixation procedure. Because of
these effects, the histological villi density seen post-partum
may overestimate the in vivo villi density. However, for the
moment, there is no generally acknowledged method which
would allow to correct for these changes.

4.2

Comparison to the porous medium model

Our optimal villi density can be compared to predictions of
the porous medium model (PMM, Chernyavsky et al., 2010).
Chernyavsky et al. have obtained a value of the optimal fraction of “villous material” φc close to 0.3. This value has to be
translated into φ obtained in the STPM to allow comparison.
Defining φc as a fraction of villi volume in the total volume
of IVS and villi, and φ as a fraction of small villi volume in
the total volume encompassing IVS and small villi:
φc = Vvil /(Vvil + VIVS ),

1. Representing villi as a uniform and isotropic porous
medium in the PMM ignores the placenta geometry. The
only geometrical parameter left (volume fraction of the
“villous material”, analogous to villi density) masks independent roles played by the absorbing surface as well
as by villi shapes and sizes. With no uptake surface,
the PMM requires assuming a uniform uptake proportional to the IVS volume fraction. At the same time,
experimental results show a considerable difference in
the absorbing surface between healthy and pathological
cases (Mayhew and Jairam, 2000).

φ = Vsm.v /(Vsm.v + VIVS ),

one obtains the following translation formula: φ = α/(α −
1 + 1/φc ) ≈ 0.22, where again α ≡ Vsm.v /Vvil ≈ 0.665 is the
average fraction of small villi in the total villi volume (Sen
et al., 1979). Comparison of this value to the average experimental value φ = 0.46 ± 0.06 demonstrates a twofold underestimation of the observed villi density in the PMM. The
authors themselves admit that this value corresponds rather
to high-altitude or pathological pre-eclamptic placentas than

Although the full 3D structure of the human placenta
at the microscopic scale of individual villi is not available from the experiment, its 2D sections can be obtained (Fig. 2). Both the PMM and STPM can rely
on these slides in terms of villi density, but the present
model also accounts for the absorbing surface by using
6

be far from the real non-developed one. Moreover, qualitative distribution of the flow in the placentone obtained
in the PMM remains approximate because: (i) Darcy’s
law has never been proved valid for the human placenta
due to the lack of experimental data; (ii) Darcy’s law was
argued to ignore the inertia of the flow and can possibly
miss important characteristics of the flow in the organ:
“given the architecture of a placental circulatory unit,
the [maternal blood] jet penetration essential to good utilization of the full villous tree for mass transfer can occur
only with appreciable fluid inertia” (Erian et al., 1977).
The validity of the last statement may however depend on
the location of the maternal vessels (Chernyavsky et al.,
2010). Our approach operates with an average velocity
of the maternal blood in the organ which includes the
inertia implicitly;

an effective villi radius (see Appendix A) and can take a
whole 2D section as input data (the last option requires
development of image analysis techniques). In the PMM,
the analysis cannot go beyond the villi density;
2. Simple uniform uptake kinetics (ignoring interaction with
hemoglobin) used in the PMM can only account for passive transport of certain metabolites, but it is unable to
describe exchange of respiratory gases as it ignores Hbbinding (for instance, about 99 % of oxygen comes into
the placenta in the bound form). At the same time,
the STPM can be used for oxygen and carbon dioxide
transport as well as for passive substances transport.
3. The use of slip boundary conditions yielding a flat velocity profile in the STPM needs further discussion. Ideally,
a full model of the placenta transport function would first
require the full high-resolution 3D placenta structure to
compute the velocity field by solving the Navier-Stokes
equation with non-slip boundary conditions at the villous
tree surface. After that, oxygen uptake could be calculated using convection-diffusion equations with the obtained velocity profile. Since modern experimental techniques can neither acquire the placenta structure with a
sufficient spatial resolution for such calculations, nor provide direct experimental measurements of the blood velocity field, one must resort to simplifications. One way
is to ignore the geometrical structure of the organ and
substitute it by a uniform isotropic porous medium as in
the PMM. We chose an alternative way using geometrical
information available from 2D histological slides.

4. The advantage of the PMM is that the results are obtained analytically in a simple form.

4.3

Other ways of comparison

Several other ways of validation of the presented model can be
suggested, all of them requiring experimental measurements
of some quantitative criteria of oxygen transfer efficiency and
histomorphometry of placental sections:
1. For each pregnancy, medical doctors possess approximate
quantitative criteria of newborns’ health, such as the
birth-weight to placenta-weight ratio. If such information
were obtained together with histological sections of the
placenta in each case, a correlation could be studied between the observed villi density, the optimal villi density
predicted by the model and the health of the baby. Such
experiment, however, requires the development of image
analysis techniques that would allow for automatic segmentation and morphometric measurements to be performed on large histological placenta sections;

From the hydrodynamic point of view, the non-slip
boundary conditions would be the most natural for modeling blood flow in a real high-resolution 3D placenta
structure. Since the blood flow path in a real placenta
geometry is expected to be irregular, no developed velocity profile is expected along the flow, and different
sections of the placenta may present different velocity
profiles. These real velocity profiles, however, can be
far from that of a developed flow with non-slip boundary
conditions. As a consequence, the advantage of choosing
the non-slip boundary conditions over the slip ones in
our already simplified structure is not so clear. In other
words, although slip and non-slip boundary conditions
may lead to different quantitative predictions, it is difficult to say which prediction will be closer to the results in
a real 3D placenta geometry. This statement can be verified either by modeling the blood flow in a full placenta
geometry (unavailable by now), or by confronting models
predictions to physiological observations. From the latter
point of view, our model with slip boundary conditions
predicts the optimal villi density which is comparable to
the experimentally observed one. A comparison with predictions from the same simplified structure with non-slip
boundary conditions presents an interesting perspective.
Note that the blood velocity used in our model should
be understood as an average velocity across the stream
tube or a placenta region.

2. In the primate placenta (the structure of which is similar
to that of the human placenta), more information can
probably be obtained from the experiment than it is ethical in the human placenta. Thus, (i) if one measured the
average linear MBF velocity in the IVS of a placentone or
in the spiral arteries supplying it, and (ii) if morphometrical measurements were obtained after birth for the same
placentone, then the relation between the blood velocity
and the observed villi density could be compared with
Fig. 6A. If additionally blood oxygenation were measured
in the spiral arteries and the decidual veins, the dependence of oxygen uptake of a placentone on the MBF velocity could be compared to Fig. 6C. A systematic study
of several placentones of the same or different placentas
could further improve validation of the model;
3. Artificial perfusion experiments could also provide data
comparable to the results of the model. In such setups,
one can estimate the oxygen uptake by the fetal circulation of a given placenta, while having control over perfusion parameters. After the perfusion, histomorphometrical measurements can be performed. The fact that in
the artificial perfusion experiments no-hemoglobin blood
is normally used does not hamper the comparison, as

On the contrary, PMM implicitly takes into account the
non-slip boundary conditions (friction at the boundary)
by using Darcy’s law. However, the PMM has similar limitations as it obtains a developed blood flow which may

non-circular shape of fetal villi by providing the right volumeto-surface ratio. Although we have indirectly estimated these
parameters from the available experimental data, their direct
measurement in the human placenta is a promising direction
of further development of experimental techniques.
In spite of its simplicity, the model predicts the existence of
an optimal villi density for each set of model parameters as a
trade-off between the incoming oxygen flux and the absorbing
villus surface. The predicted optimal villi density 0.47±0.06 is
compatible with experimentally observed values. Dependence
of the optimal characteristics on the length of the stream tube
and the velocity of the MBF was investigated.
In a perspective, one can check the effect of relaxing some
of the model assumptions. One direction of the future work
consists in relaxing the slip boundary conditions and comparing the results of the two approaches, which are expected
to describe different limiting cases of the real in vivo flow.
One can also study the effect of villi shapes and sizes distributions on the predicted optimal villi density and maximal
uptake. Besides, the placenta is a living organ with its own
oxygen consumption rate, which may be considered proportional to the weight of its tissues. Once this effect is taken into
account, the amount of oxygen transferred at the same villi
density from mother to the fetus should decrease, shifting the
position of the optimal villi density peak to the left (Fig. 5B).
Another direction is to apply the STPM to 2D histological
slides in order to relate geometrical structure of placenta regions to their oxygen uptake efficiency and hence to be able
to distinguish between healthy and pathological placentas.

such situation can be simulated in our model by allowing B = 1. Experimental measurements of villi density
and of oxygen uptake as a function of the perfusion parameters can then be compared to the predictions of the
model.
These suggestions represent possible directions of further development of experimental techniques.

4.4

Model assumptions and other remarks

The assumption of fetal villi being a perfect sink erases differences between concurrent and counter-current organizations
of flows since this difference essentially arises from the nonuniformity of oxygen concentration in the fetal blood. The
presented STPM can describe oxygen transfer in both these
flow orientations under this assumption. As for the crosscurrent (multivillous) blood flow organization, the model geometry can be changed to account for the angle α between the
maternal and fetal flows directions. We have not incorporated
such calculations into our model, because (i) there does not
seem to be any fixed co-orientation of the maternal and fetal
blood flows in the human placenta, and (ii) the experimentally observed villi density is already a result of sectioning at
an unknown (random) angle to fetal villi. If the value of this
angle were known, the effect of the sectioning angle could be
approximately corrected by multiplying the villi density and
the villi perimeter used in the model by the factor 1/ cos(α)
before comparison to values observed in experimental slides.
Finally, it should be noted that the curves in Fig. 5 do
not reach the expected limit of 1 for the optimal villi density, but stop at 0.75. This is explained by the circular villi
shapes used in the calculations. The maximal packing density for the used radii ratio of Rnum /r ≈ 14.63 is known to
be φ ≈ 0.83 or N = 177 cylinders (Specht, 2009). Without
using the optimal packing algorithms, we have carried out
calculations up to the density φ = 0.75, which we believe to
be sufficient to represent densely packed regions of placenta
slides (cf. Figs 2, 4). The latter value is the limit of the curves
seen in Figs 5.

Conclusions

We presented a 2D+1D stream-tube placenta model of oxygen
transfer in the human placenta. Our model incorporates only
the most significant geometrical and hemodynamic features,
enabling it to remain simple while yielding practical results.
Modeling oxygen transport in the human placenta traditionally involved the following parameters: incoming (c0 )
and maximal oxygen concentrations (cmax ), diffusivity of
oxygen in blood (D), solubility of oxygen in blood (khn ),
oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation coefficient (β60 ), density of
blood (ρbl ), length of the blood flow path (L), a characteristic
size of the exchange region (R) and the local permeability of
the feto-maternal interface (w) or the integral diffusing capacity of the organ (Dp ). The construction of the STPM showed
that several additional parameters are required to account
for a 2D placental section structure: (i) the linear maternal
blood flow velocity in the exchange region (u, in m/s), since
the usual integral flow (in ml/min) is not enough; (ii) the volumetric density (φ) of small fetal villi in a given region; and
(iii) the effective radius of fetal villi (r), which accounts for the

Parameters of the model

Maximal oxygen concentration in the maternal
blood (cmax ) cmax is the maximal oxygen concentration,
which a unit of blood volume would contain at a 100 %
saturation only due to binding to hemoglobin molecules. To
calculate cmax we need to multiply the following quantities:
• concentration of hemoglobin in blood.

to give the same perimeter-to-cross-sectional-area ratio (ε =
Psm.v /Ssm.v , also called surface density) as in histological
slides. In our model, ε = 2πrN/(πr2 N ) = 2/r, and we then
define the effective villi radius as r = 2/ε so as to give the
right perimeter-to-area ratio for the villi cross-sections. The
value of ε is taken from histomorphometrical studies.
Experimental values of the perimeter-to-area ratio ε and
radii calculated from them are shown in Table A.1. The
area (Ssm.v ) and the perimeter (Psm.v ) of the small villi crosssections are usually presented in terms of small villi volume (Vsm.v ) and small villi surface area (Asm.v ) respectively
by scaling them to the size of the whole placenta. In spite of
this recalculation procedure, the same formula remains valid
for ε: ε = 2Asm.v /Vsm.v . One then gets r = 41 ± 3 µm for
the effective villi radius (a value slightly larger than the average villi radius as it accounts for the correct perimeter-to-area
ratio of villi cross-sections).

Substituting cmax = 7.30 ± 0.11 mol/m3 , β60 = 0.0170 ±
0.0003 mmHg−1 (slope of the linearized Hill equation, see Section B.3), khn ≈ 7.5 · 105 mmHg · kg/mol (see Section B.1)
and ρbl ≈ 103 kg/m3 (as close to the density of water) into
Eq. (B.5), we obtain B = 94 ± 2.

Permeability of the effective feto-maternal interface (w) The permeability of the feto-maternal interface is
a local transfer characteristic, which has been studied before
under the form of oxygen diffusing capacity (Dp ). We show
below how the two characteristics are related and how one
can be recalculated into the other. Following Bartels et al.
(1962), Mayhew et al. (1984), we define Dp as a volume of
gas (measured at normal conditions) transferred per minute
per average oxygen partial pressure difference between the
maternal and fetal blood: Dp = VO2 /(t(pmat − pfet )), where
the horizontal bar denotes averaging over the feto-maternal
interface surface.
Oxygen diffusing capacity has been
calculated for the placenta as a whole, but the details
of calculations (namely, rescaling) demonstrate its local
nature (Aherne and Dunnill, 1966, Laga et al., 1973, Mayhew
et al., 1984, Teasdale, 1982, 1983). The following points need
to be clarified:

Oxygen concentration at the entrance to the IVS (c0 )
c0 is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma
of maternal blood entering the system. To calculate the concentration c0 , we need to know oxygen saturation of maternal
blood which enters the placenta. We will then be able to
calculate c0 by the formula which follows from the Hill equation (B.1):
c0 = cpl (z = 0) =

1
· S(pO2 ) · cmax .
B−1

After 12-th week postmenstruation, pO2 was found to
be 90 mmHg in the uterine artery, 61 mmHg in the IVS
and 47 mmHg in the decidual vein (Challier and Uzan, 2003,
Jauniaux et al., 2000, Rodesch et al., 1992). Taking the IVS
value of 61 mmHg (no error estimation available) together
with the hemoglobin saturation curve (Severinghaus, 1979) we
get hemoglobin saturation S(61 mmHg) ≈ 85 %. Supposing
that it is equal to the hemoglobin saturation at the entrance
to the IVS, we then obtain c0 = (6.7 ± 0.2) · 10−2 mol/m3 .

1. Our model assumption that fetal blood is a perfect sink
implies that the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 ) appearing in our model is not its absolute value in the maternal blood, but the difference in oxygen partial pressures on both sides of the membrane: pO2 = pmat − pfet .
This partial pressure can be recalculated into the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma (cpl )
with Henry’s law (Appendix B): pO2 = cpl khn /ρbl . The
volume of transferred oxygen VO2 measured at normal conditions can be recalculated into amount of substance with the help of Avogadro’s law: VO2 = νO2 Vm ,
where Vm = 22.4 l/mol. One then obtains

Oxygen diffusivity in blood plasma (D) Oxygen diffusivity in the blood plasma has been measured under different
conditions: D = (1.7 ± 0.5) · 10−9 m2 /s (Moore et al., 2000,
Wise and Houghton, 1969).
Effective villi radius (r) Histological slides of the human
placenta show that the cross-sections of fetal villi are not circular. Traditionally, the radius of the villi is estimated by
averaging the size of a cross-section in all directions. This
yields a villi radius 25–30 µm for terminal and mature intermediate villi, which contribute the most to the uptake (Sen
et al., 1979). However, such calculation ignores the fact that
the real perimeter of a villus is larger than that of a circle
with the same radius. At the same time, the absorbing surface of villi is important for transport processes as, in the first
approximation, oxygen uptake is proportional to its area.
To let our model appropriately account for both crosssectional area (Ssm.v ) and the absorbing perimeter (Psm.v )
of the small villi, an effective villi radius (r) is introduced

The mean value of the diffusing capacity is reported to

(Table A.1). Using these data, we finally get w = (2.8 ± 1.1) ·

show that oxygen diffusive capacity in diabetic pregnancies,
although slightly higher, is of the same order of magnitude as
in healthy pregnancies.

1. The modeling by Burton et al. (2009) concludes that
blood velocity at the ends of spiral arteries falls down
to 0.1 m/s due to dilation of spiral arteries towards term.
MBF velocity in the IVS must drop even further;
2. The order of magnitude of the MBF velocity can also be
estimated as follows: the total incoming flow of blood
can be divided by the surface of the whole placenta
cross-section occupied by the IVS. The total incoming
flow is known to be of the order of 600 ml/min (Assali
et al., 1953, Bartels et al., 1962, Browne and Veall, 1953),
or 450 ml/min if one considers that 25 % of the flow passes
through myometrial shunts (Bartels et al., 1962); crosssection area of the placental disk is π(11 cm)2 ≈ 380 cm2 ;
and the percentage of the cross-section occupied by
the IVS is around 35 % (Aherne and Dunnill, 1966, Bacon et al., 1986, Laga et al., 1973, Mayhew et al., 1986).
There is no contradiction between the villi density of
around 0.5 (main text, Table 2) and the value 0.35, as
the former is the fraction of small villi in a cross-section
containing small villi and IVS only (all other components subtracted), whereas the latter also accounts for
large villi and non-IVS components of a placenta crosssection. Finally, for the estimation of the average MBF
we get: u ∼ 450 ml/min/(380 cm2 · 0.35) ∼ 5 · 10−4 m/s;

Radius of the placentone at term (at least 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) (R) A normal placenta
numbers 50 ± 10 (Benirschke et al., 2006, p. 161) placentones, whereas the average radius of the placental disk
is 11 ± 2 cm (Salafia et al., 2012). Division of the disk area
by the number of functional units yields R = 1.6 ± 0.4 cm. A
placentone of this radius contains about 1.5 · 105 fetal villi of
radius r. Numerical resolution of the problem for such a large
number of villi would be too time-consuming. At the same
time, oxygen uptake depends rather on villi density than on
the number of villi. We have thus performed the calculations
for a smaller radius Rnum = 6 · 10−4 m, and then rescaled oxygen uptake to the real size R of the placentone by multiplying
2
it by R/Rnum
.
Note that the analysis of the characteristic time scales of the
transfer processes in the human placenta shows that during
the time spent in a placentone by each volume of blood, the
characteristic distance of oxygen diffusion in a cross-section
is of an IVS pore size (about 80 µm, see Sect. 2.2.1). That
means that the solution of the diffusion-convection equation
in any part of the stream-tube volume that is farther from
its boundary than that distance, will be independent of the
shape of the boundary, and hence, any shape of the external
boundary of a placentone can be chosen.

3. A more accurate estimation of the blood velocity can
be obtained from the results of the experimental study
by Burchell (1967), in which angiographic photographs of
the human uterus at different stages of pregnancy have
been obtained by X-rays with a radioactive dye. The
time during which the radioactive dye was observed in the
placenta (tobs ) and the corresponding diffusion diameter
of the dye spot (2a) at term were reported (Table A.2).
The diffusion diameter is defined as the mean maximal
diameter of the zone of propagation of the radioactive
material, and the dye observation time (tobs ) is the time
elapsed since the appearance of the radioactive dye till
its disappearance from the IVS.

linear maternal blood flow in the IVS of the human placenta
in vivo is scarce. To our knowledge, no direct measurements
have ever been conducted. Among the indirect estimations,
the following approaches are worth attention:

Data in Table A.2 shows that the diameter of the diffusion space where the radioactive dye was observed (up
to 3.5 cm) is of the order of the placentone diameter (2a ≈ 2.5 cm), which justifies the conclusion of the au10

Because of a low solubility, the partial pressure of the dissolved oxygen can be related to its concentration by using
Henry’s law of ideal solution: pO2 = cpl khn /ρbl , where ρbl ≈
1000 kg/m3 is the density of blood, and the coefficient khn
can be estimated from the fact that a concentration cpl ≈
0.13 mol/m3 of dissolved oxygen corresponds to an oxygen
content of 3 ml O2 /l blood or a partial pressure of oxygen of 13 kPa at normal conditions (Law and Bukwirwa,
1999). No error estimations are provided for these data.
These estimates give the Henry’s law coefficient: khn ∼ 7.5 ·
105 mmHg · kg/mol for oxygen dissolved in blood.
The partial pressure of hemoglobin-bound oxygen depends
on its concentration through oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation
curve (the Hill equation):

thor that in this study, blood propagation in placentones
has been observed. The dye volume Vdye was reported to
be 50 cm3 in all the experiments. For estimations, we neglect the effect of its further dissolution and of increase
of the dye volume and assume that the dye volume is
equally distributed between ncot = 50 placentones of the
placenta at term (Benirschke et al., 2006).
From the presented data, one can estimate the total
blood flow in one placentone (q, in ml/min), the IVS
blood flow velocity (u) and the time (τtr ) that takes a
blood volume to pass a placentone. For this purpose, we
assume that the IVS has the shape of a hemisphere of radius R, and blood flows uniformly from its center in radial
directions to the hemisphere boundary (this description
is confirmed by the “doughnut” shape of dye diffusion
clouds reported in the study and corresponds to the current views, see Benirschke et al., 2006, Chernyavsky et al.,
2010). In this case, q = (2πa3 /3 + Vdye /ncot )/tobs and
the transit time of maternal blood through the placentone is τtr = 2πa3 /(3q). The mean velocity of blood in
the placentone can be defined as u = a/τtr .

cbnd = cmax S(pO2 ),

B.2

The three estimates (u1 < 0.1 m/s, u2 ≈ 5 · 10−4 m/s,
u3 ≈ 6 · 10−4 m/s) are compatible, and for calculations we
use the value u = 6 · 10−4 m/s obtained from the third, the
most precise method. We emphasize that the MBF velocity may significantly differ between placental regions, and the
value u = 6 · 10−4 m/s should be understood as a mean value
for the whole placenta.

(B.1)

Diffusive-convective transfer

Diffusive-convective transfer is based on the mass conservation law for the total concentration of oxygen in a volume of
blood:
∂(cpl + cbnd )
+ div ~jctot = 0,
∂t

(B.3)

~ pl + ~
where ~jctot = −D∇c
u(cpl + cbnd ) is the total flux of oxygen, transferred both by diffusion and convection for the dissolved form and only by convection (RBCs being too large
objects) for the bound form; and ~
u denotes the velocity
of the MBF. Omitting the time derivatives in the stationary regime, substituting the expression for oxygen flux into
Eq. (B.3) and assuming z being the direction of the MBF, we
obtain

Cylinder length (L) The length of the cylinder L is fixed
to provide the time of passage (τtr = 27 s) as calculated
from Burchell (1967) (Table A.2) if the velocity of the flow
u ≈ 6 · 10−4 m/s: L ≈ 1.6 cm (no error estimation available).
Note that this value is comparable to, but smaller than the basic estimate as a doubled placenta thickness (for the idealized
case when blood goes from the basal plate to the chorionic
plate and then back) because: (i) a placentone may not occupy all the thickness of the placenta; (ii) the central cavity
is likely to have less resistance to the flow and larger blood
velocities, and should hence probably not be considered as a
part of the exchange region; and (iii) blood flow in the exchange region is not directed “vertically” between the basal
and the chorionic plates, but rather from the boundary of the
central cavity to decidual veins (see Fig. 3C).

Linearization of the Hill equation

Data found in the literature show that the maternal blood at
the entrance to the IVS of the human placenta has a pO2
of about 60 mmHg (see calculation of c0 in Appendix A).
It is natural to suppose that this pressure is the maximal value in the exchange region. From Fig. B.1, one
can see that in the range [0, 60] mmHg the shape of the
dissociation curve can be approximated by a straight line.

The very fast oxygen-hemoglobin reaction can be accounted
for by assuming that the concentrations of oxygen dissolved
in the blood plasma (cpl ) and of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (cbnd ) instantaneously mirror each other’s changes. Mathematically, both concentrations can be related by equating
oxygen partial pressures in these two forms.

where oxygen uptake F (L) at the stream-tube length L is
calculated from the law of conservation of mass. The mesh of
the 2D geometry of the IVS necessary for an implementation
of a finite elements method is created with Voronoı̈-Delaunay
algorithm (Fig. B.2A). Figures B.2B–B.2D illustrate oxygen
concentration cpl distribution in a 2D cross-section calculated
at three different stream-tube lengths.
Convergence of the results has been tested by varying the
number of eigenfunctions found and the number of mesh
points. Figure B.3 shows the dependence of the uptake at
length L on the number of eigenfunctions. One can see that
a good convergence is achieved with around 3000 eigenfunctions for all geometries and for all three lengths shown in the
article (z = L/3, z = 2L/3 and z = L).
The concentration cpl (r) and oxygen uptake F (L) for the
case of one fetal villus have been compared to the exact analytical solution (Lundberg et al., 1963):

Figure B.1. Oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. On the figure: (i) the dots are experimental data at normal conditions as
obtained by Severinghaus (1979); (ii) the curved line shows our
fitting of these data by the Hill equation with the coefficients being α = 2.65, k = 0.04 mmHg−1 ; (iii) the straight dashed line is
our linear approximation in the [0, 60] mmHg region, slope of the
line being β60 ≈ 0.0170 ± 0.0003 mmHg−1 (linear fit ± standard
error).

In that case, the 3D equation (B.4) can be converted to
a 2D+1D equation which allows for faster computations, while
keeping the main features of the solution. Such linearized
equation can be also studied analytically. Fitting the experimental curve in the region [0, 60] mmHg by a straight
line passing through zero we obtain a linear approximation S(pO2 ) ≈ β60 pO2 , β60 ≈ 0.017 mmHg−1 , with the help

Boundary conditions

Equation (B.5) should be completed with boundary conditions derived from the model assumptions:

Jm (r) and Ym (r) are the m-th order Bessel functions of the
first and second kind respectively, r0 and R are the radii of
the small and large cylinders respectively and r is the radial
coordinate. Figure B.4 shows that the relative error between
the numerical and analytical oxygen uptake for the case of one
villus is less than 5 % for all physiologically relevant streamtube lengths.

• there is no uptake at the boundary of the placentone (of
the large external cylinder): ∂cpl /∂n = 0, where ∂/∂n is
a normal derivative directed outside the IVS;
• oxygen uptake at the feto-maternal interface is proportional to the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the
IVS: (∂/∂n + w/D)cpl = 0, where w is the permeability
of the effective feto-maternal interface;

C

• the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the maternal
blood plasma is uniform at the entrance of the stream
tube (at z = 0 plane): cpl (x, y, z = 0) = c0 , ∀(x, y) ∈
SIVS , where SIVS is the maternal part of a horizontal
cross-section.

Error estimation

The uncertainties of measurement of the parameters of the
model can be used to estimate the error in determination
of the optimal villi density φ0 and the maximal oxygen uptake Fmax . If a variable f depends on several independent

Note that at the numerical precision, φ0 and Fmax appear to
be independent of the diffusivity D of oxygen. Such behavior
cannot be universal for all values of parameters (since D = 0,
for example, would obviously give no oxygen uptake), but
seems to be approximately valid for the normal placenta parameters (Table 1). Substituting the standard deviation of
the parameters: δB = 2, δr = 3 · 10−6 m, δR = 4 · 10−3 m,
δw = 1.1 · 10−4 m/s, δc0 = 2 · 10−3 mol/m3 (Table 1), we
obtain δφ0 = 0.06 and δFmax = 6 · 10−7 mol/s.
