Oscillations and noise are ubiquitous in physical and biological systems. When oscillations arise
from a deterministic limit cycle, entrainment and synchronization may be analyzed in terms of the
asymptotic phase function. In the presence of noise, the asymptotic phase is no longer well defined.
We introduce a new definition of asymptotic phase in terms of the slowest decaying modes of the
Kolmogorov backward operator. Our stochastic asymptotic phase is well defined for noisy oscillators,
even when the oscillations are noise dependent. It reduces to the classical asymptotic phase in the
limit of vanishing noise. The phase can be obtained either by solving an eigenvalue problem, or by
empirical observation of an oscillating density’s approach to its steady state.

Introduction. Limit cycles (LC) appear in deterministic models of nonlinear oscillators such as spiking
nerve cells [1], central pattern generators [2], and nonlinear circuits [3]. The reduction of LC systems to onedimensional “phase” variables is an indispensable tool
for understanding entrainment and synchronization of
weakly coupled oscillators [4, 5]. Within the deterministic framework, all initial points converge to the LC, on
which we can define a phase that progresses at a constant
rate (θ̇ = ωLC = 2π/TLC ). The phase θ(x0 ) of any point
x0 is then defined by the asymptotic convergence of the
trajectory to that phase on the LC. However, stochastic
oscillations are ubiquitous, for example in biological systems [6], and in this setting the classical definition of the
phase breaks down. For a noisy dynamics, all initial densities will converge to the same stationary density. Thus
the large-t asymptotic behavior no longer disambiguates
initial conditions, and the classical asymptotic phase is
not well defined.
Schwabedal and Pikovsky attacked this problem by
defining the phase for a stochastic oscillator in terms
of the mean first passage times (MFPT) between surfaces analogous to the isochrons (level curves of the phase
function θ(x)) of deterministic LC [7–9]. Here we formulate an alternative definition that is tied directly to the
asymptotic behavior of the density, rather than the first
passage time, and is grounded in the analysis of the forward and backward operators governing the evolution of
system densities. Our operator approach leads to two
distinct notions of “phase” for stochastic systems. As we
argue below, the phase associated with the backward or
adjoint operator is closely related to the classical asymptotic phase.
General framework. Consider the conditional density
ρ(y, t|x, s), for times t > s, evolving according to the
forward and backward equations
∂
∂
ρ(y, t|x, s) = Ly [ρ],
ρ(y, t|x, s) = −L†x [ρ],
∂t
∂s

(1)

where L and L† are adjoint with respect to the usual
inner product on the space of densities. We assume that
the conditional density can be written as a sum
X
ρ(y, t|x, s) = P0 (y) +
eλ(t−s) Pλ (y)Q∗λ (x),
(2)
λ

where the eigentriples (λ, P, Q∗ ) satisfy
L[Pλ ] = λPλ , L† [Q∗λ ] = λQ∗λ ,
Z
hQλ |Pλ0 i =
dx Q∗λ (x)Pλ0 (x) = δλ,λ0 .

(3)
(4)

Here P0 is the unique stationary distribution corresponding to eigenvalue 0, Q0 ≡ 1, and for all other eigenvalues λ, we assume <[λ] < 0. Thus, as (t − s) → ∞,
ρ(y, t|x, s) → P0 (y). We refer to the system as robustly
oscillatory if (i) the nontrivial eigenvalue with least negative real part λ1 = µ + iω is complex (with ω > 0),
(ii) |ω/µ|  1 and (iii) for all other eigenvalues λ0 ,
<[λ0 ] ≤ 2µ. These conditions guarantee that the slowest decaying mode, as the density approaches its steady
state, will oscillate with period 2π/ω, and decay with
time constant 1/|µ|. Writing the eigenfunctions of λ1 ,
the slowest decaying eigenvalue of the forward and backward operators, in polar form, we have Pλ1 = ve−iφ and
Q∗λ1 = ueiψ , where u, v ≥ 0 and ψ, φ ∈ [0, 2π). Asymptotically, we obtain with this notation from eq. (1)
ρ(y, t|x, s) − P0 (y)
' eµ(t−s) cos (ω(t−s) + ψ(x)−φ(y))
2u(x)v(y)
(5)
As we now argue, ψ(x), the polar angle associated with
the backward eigenfunction, is the natural generalization
of the deterministic asymptotic phase.
For a deterministic LC system, a given asymptotic
phase is assigned to points off the LC by identifying
those points which at an earlier time were positioned
so that their subsequent paths would converge. Suppose

2
we observe a density of points ρ(y, t) concentrated near
a position on the LC corresponding to a certain phase
θ(y) ≈ θ0 . Fixing a point x away from the LC, the density ρ(x, s) at earlier times s < t will show transient oscillations with period TLC as the density propagates away
from the stable LC in reverse time. The oscillations observed at two distinct points x and x0 will be offset by
the difference in their asymptotic phase. Looking forward in time, all trajectories will continue converging to
the LC, so the density for a point away from the LC will
not oscillate – it will remain zero.
Figure 1 illustrates the analogous measurement of the
phase at a point x from the conditional density at earlier times, ρ(x, s|y, t), for a stochastic oscillator. For a
stationary stochastic time series this density is related to
the conditional density ρ(y, t|x, s) appearing in eq. (5)
by ρ0 (x, s; y, t) = ρ(y, t|x, s)P0 (x) = ρ(x, s|y, t)P0 (y)
(not to be confused with the detailed balance condition),
which can be used to rewrite eq. (5) as follows
ρ(x, t − τ |y, t) − P0 (x)
eµτ
'
cos (ωτ + ψ(x)−φ(y)) ,
2u(x)v(y)P0 (x)
P0 (y)
(6)
where we have switched to s = t − τ with τ > 0. If we
select from a stationary ensemble the trajectories that
end up at time t in y, we can estimate the conditional
density ρ(x, t−τ |y, t) and the steady state P0 (x). Fitting
then the left-hand-side of eq. (6) to a damped cosine in
τ (see Fig. 1), we can by virtue of eq. (6) infer the phase
ψ(x) at any point x.
We may also obtain the backward-looking phase by
solving the eigenvalue problem eq. (3) for Q∗ . Comparison with the deterministic case again points to the
complex angle of Q∗ as the analog of the classical phase.
For a deterministic system, dx/dt = A(x), the conditional density ρ(y, t|x, s) obeys eq. (1) with L†x [Q] =
P
The function Q1 = eiθ(x) with
i Ai (x)∂Q(x)/∂xi .
u ≡ 1 and ψ(x) ≡ θ(x) is an eigenfunction of L†x with
eigenvalue λ = iωLC . The analogous
eigenfunction of
P
the forward operator, Ly [P ] = − i ∂(Ai (y)P (y))/∂yi ,
is identically zero except on the LC, at which it has a
delta-mass radial distribution. Thus P1 is unsuitable for
defining a “phase” anywhere except on the limit cycle
itself.
Noisy Heteroclinic Oscillator. Consider the system
√
Y˙1 = cos(Y1 ) sin(Y2 ) + α sin(2Y1 ) + 2Dξ1 (t)
√
Y˙2 = − sin(Y1 ) cos(Y2 ) + α sin(2Y2 ) + 2Dξ2 (t), (7)
with α = 0.1, reflecting boundary conditions on the domain −π/2 ≤ {Y1 , Y2 } ≤ π/2, and independent white
noise sources hξi (t)ξj (t0 )i = δ(t − t0 )δi,j . Without noise
(D = 0) the system has an attracting heteroclinic cycle,
but does not possess a finite-period limit cycle. Therefore, in the noiseless case, there is no classical asymptotic
phase [10].
For weak noise, the system displays pronounced oscillations (Fig. 1, B), manifest as irregular clockwise rotations in the (y1 , y2 ) plane (Fig. 1, A). We can use large

FIG. 1: (color online) Trajectory of the heteroclinic oscillator and the histogram method to estimate the
asymptotic phase. Trajectories in the (Y1 , Y2 ) plane like
the one shown in (A) that all end up in the neighborhood
of the reference point (Y1 , Y2 ) (red box) are used to estimate
the time-dependent probability in the past in other points
(X1 , X2 ) in the plane (blue boxes). This probability displays
asymptotically damped oscillations (C, D), characterized by
the smallest non-vanishing eigenvalue and a space-dependent
phase-shift ∆(x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 ) = ψ(x1 , x2 ) − φ(y1 , y2 ), from
which the asymptotic phase ψ(x1 , x2 ) can be extracted [the
constant off-set still depends on the reference point (y1 , y2 )].
Stochastic oscillations of the variables are shown in (B).

trajectories and condition them on their end point (red
box in Fig. 1, A). As argued above, looking back into the
past of such an ensemble of trajectories, we see for large
times a damped oscillation (Fig. 1, C and D), the damping constant and frequency of which should be related to
the real and imaginary parts of the first non-vanishing
eigenvalue. Indeed, we have checked by fitting a damped
cosine according to eq. (6) to the counting histograms
of the backward probability at different positions, that
the estimate of µ and ω is largely independent of location (not shown). More importantly, fitting a damped
cosine function also provides an estimate of the asymptotic phase ψ(x1 , x2 ) in eq. (6). We verified that (up
to a fixed phase shift at every point (x1 , x2 )) the resulting phase does not depend on the choice of the reference
point (y1 , y2 ).
As outlined above, the asymptotic phase is also given
by the complex phase of the eigenfunction for the slowest
eigenvalue of the system. For the process eq. (7), the
backward operator reads explicitly
L† = [cos(x1 ) sin(x2 ) + α sin(2x1 )]∂x1 + D∂x21
+ [− sin(x1 ) cos(x2 ) + α sin(2x2 )]∂x2 + D∂x22 . (8)
We solve the eigenvalue problem eq. (3) for the system by expanding the eigenfunctions in a Fourier basis

FIG. 2: (color online) Asymptotic phase of the stochastic
heteroclinic oscillator for two different noise levels.
The complex phase of the backward eigenfunction (solid lines)
is compared to the results of the histogram method [11] for
D = 0.1 (A) and D = 0.01125 (B). Eigenfunctions used in
(A) and (B) correspond to the slowest eigenvalues, marked
by dashed boxes in (C). Isochrons at lower noise level [black
in (D)] are more curled than for stronger noise [red in (D)].
Thick lines in (D) denote 2π-jump in phase.

Fig. 2C for two different noise values. Under both noise
conditions, the first nonvanishing eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair (framed) that is well separated from
the remaining eigenvalues. As we would expect, for a
lower noise level (D = 0.01125, black filled circles) this
separation is more pronounced than for a higher level
(D = 0.1, red empty circles).
The complex phase of the eigenfunction for the two distinct noise levels is shown in Fig. 2A and B. The phase
increases in the same direction as the local mean velocity
(clockwise) in both cases. For weaker noise, the phase

winds inward more steeply, i.e. the inward radial component of ∇ψ is larger.
In Fig. 2A and B we also superimpose data (blue
points) generated by the histogram method, subject to a
uniform constant vertical offset. The agreement of these
two surfaces demonstrates that the asymptotic phase can
be obtained by the solution of the partial differential
eq. (3) for model systems, for which this equation is
known, but also from trajectories of the system obtained
either by stochastic simulations (for a model) or measurements (experimental data).
Neural Oscillator with Ion Channel Noise. Izhikevich
introduced a planar conductance-based model for excitable membrane dynamics [12] that is similar to the well
known two-dimensional Morris-Lecar model [13, 14]. We
consider a jump Markov process version of Izhikevich’s
model, in which noise arises from the random gating of
a small, discrete population of Ntot potassium (K) channels, which switch between an open and a closed state.
Conditional on N (t), the number of open channels at
time t, the voltage V evolves deterministically:

dV 
C
= I0 − IL (V ) − INaP (V ) − IK (V, N )
dt N
= Cf (V, N )
(9)
where I0 is an applied current, IL is a passive leak current, INaP is a deterministic “persistent sodium” current
and IK is a potassium current gated by the number of
open potassium channels, 0 ≤ N ≤ Ntot . We used standard parameters [15].
The number of open channels N (t) comprises a continuous time Markov jump process with voltage dependent
per capita transition rates α(v) for channel opening and
β(v) for channel closing [12]. We generated trajectories
of the joint (V, N ) process using an exact stochastic simulation algorithm that takes into account the time-varying
transition rates α and β [16, 17]. Fig. 3A shows a trajectory in the (v, n) plane for Ntot = 100 channels and
applied current I0 = 60. The light and dark gray dashed
lines show the v-nullcline and n-nullcline, respectively. In
contrast to the noisy heteroclinic oscillator, this system
has a stable limit cycle in the limit of vanishing noise
(Ntot → ∞) with finite period TLC ≈ 5.9825.
The forward and backward equations for this system
are given in terms of f (v, n) (eq. (9)), α(v) and β(v) [15]:

ρ(v 0 , n0 , t|v, n, s) = Lv0 [ρ] = − 0 [f (v 0 , n0 )ρ] − (α(v 0 ) (Ntot − n0 ) + β(v 0 )n0 ) ρ

FIG. 3: (color online) Trajectory, nullclines, eigenvalues of the backward operator, and asymptotic phase lines for
the persistent-sodium–potassium model. (A) Sample trajectory (thin black line) for the (V, N ) process for Ntot = 100
channels, and nullclines for the deterministic v (thick grey line) and n (thick black line) dynamics. (B) Low-lying spectrum for
L† for two different channel numbers, Ntot = 100 (black dots) and Ntot = 25 (red crosses). Dashed boxes indicate the leading
complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs. (C) Level curves (isochrons) of the asymptotic phase for Ntot = 25 (red), Ntot = 100
(black), and Ntot = ∞ (blue; deterministic case). The thick lines indicate the locations of the phase jump by 2π, which have
been adjusted to coincide for the three cases. Isochrons are marked in equal increments of 2π/20. Nullclines as in (A).

We approximate the operator L† with a finite difference
scheme by discretizing the voltage axis −80 ≤ v ≤ 20 into
200 bins of equal width. We obtain the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the matrices approximating L and L† using standard methods (MATLAB, The Mathworks). Fig. 3B
shows the dominant (slowest decaying) part of the eigenvalue spectrum. Note the occurrence of a family of eigenvalues of the form λk ≈ ±iωk − µk 2 , k = 0, 1, 2, . . . . The
quadratic relationship between the real and imaginary
parts of the eigenvalues of this form is consistent with
the existence of a change of coordinates under which the

evolution takes the approximate form
√ of diffusion on a
ring with constant drift, ϕ̇ = ω + 2µξ(t). Here the
eigensystem is exactly solvable, and the spectrum lies on
the same paraboloa.

Fig. 3C shows level curves of the asymptotic phase
function ψ(v, n) in three cases, along with the nullclines
from panel A. For Ntot → ∞ the process converges to
the solution of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations for v and n [18]. This system possesses a stable
limit cycle for which the phase θ and isochrons are obtained in the standard way [12] (blue curves). Near the
unstable spiral fixed point at the intersection of the nullclines, the deterministic isochrons exhibit a pronounced
twisting. For Ntot = 100, with moderately noisy dynamics, the level curves of the asymptotic phase ψ for the
stochastic system (black curves) lie close to the deterministic isochrons. The greatest differences appear in a
rarely visited region, in the neighborhood of the unstable
fixed point. As in the heteroclinic system (Fig. 2D), the
less noisy system has more tightly wound isochrons. For
Ntot = 25, corresponding to an even larger noise level,
the stochastic isochrons (red curves) show even less twisting. At both noise levels, the stochastic isochrons show
greatest similarity to the deterministic isochrons in the
region corresponding to the upstroke of the action potential, and show the greatest discrepancy at subthreshold
voltages.

Discussion. Most investigations have approached noisy
oscillators by studying the effects of weak noise on a deterministically defined phase [19–23]. We generalize the
classical asymptotic phase to the stochastic case in terms
of the eigenfunctions of the backward operator describing the evolution of densities with respect to the initial
time. As with the stochastic phase defined via the MFPT
[7–9], the backward-looking asymptotic phase is well defined whether or not the underlying deterministic system
has a well defined phase. However, if the classical phase
exists, in the absence of noise, our asymptotic phase is
consistent with the classical definition.
The MFPT approach has been applied to nonMarkovian systems [9]. Our operator approach would not
apply to a non-Markovian process unless it can be embedded in a higher-dimensional Markovian system [24].
Moreover, for a Markovian system, the MFPT from a
point x to a given surface obeys an inhomogeneous partial differential equation involving the same adjoint operator L†x , an eigenfunction of which defines our asymptotic phase. Thus, the relationship between Schwabedal
and Pikovsky’s phase description of stochastic oscillators
and our asymptotic phase remains an appealing topic for

In Figure 3B, the first nonzero pair (framed) for Ntot =
100 is λ1 ≈ −0.031 ± 1.0475i, corresponding to a period
for the decaying oscillation of T ≈ 5.9985 (cf. TLC above)
and ω/|µ| ≈ 33.7  1. All other eigenvalues have real
part less than or equal to 4µ, so the system is “robustly
oscillatory” according to our criteria (i-iii).
