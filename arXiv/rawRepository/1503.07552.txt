We study the rhythmogenesis of oscillatory patterns emerging in network motifs composed of
inhibitory coupled tonic spiking neurons represented by the Plant model of R15 nerve cells. Such
motifs are argued to be used as building blocks for a larger central pattern generator network
controlling swim locomotion of sea slug Melibe leonina.

1. Introduction
A plethora of vital rhythmic motor behaviors, such as heartbeat, respiratory functions and locomotion are
produced and governed by neural networks called central pattern generators (CPGs) [Selverston, 1985; Bal
et al., 1988; Marder & Calabrese, 1996; Frost & Katz, 1996; Kristan et al., 2005; Katz & Hooper, 2007].
A CPG is a microcircuit of interneurons whose mutually synergetic interactions autonomously generate
an array of multi-phase bursting rhythms underlying motor behaviors. There is a growing consensus in
the community of neurophysiologists and computational researchers that some basic structural and functional elements must be shared by CPGs in invertebrate and vertebrate animals. As such, we should first
understand these elements, find the universal principles, and develop efficient mathematical and computational tools for plausible and phenomenological models of CPG networks. Pairing experimental studies and
modeling studies has proven to be key to unlocking insights into operational and dynamical principles of
CPGs [Gillner & Wallen, 1985; Kopell & Ermentrout, 2004; Matsuoka, 1987; Kopell, 1988; Canavier et al.,
1994; Skinner et al., 1994a; Dror et al., 1999; Prinz et al., 2003a]. Although various circuits and models of
specific CPGs have been developed, it still remains unclear what makes the CPG dynamics so robust and
flexible [Best et al., 2005; Belykh & Shilnikov, 2008; Sherwood et al., 2010; Koch et al., 2011; Calabrese
et al., 2011; Marder, 2012]. It is also unclear what mechanisms a multi-functional motor system can use
to generate polyrhythmic outcomes to govern several behaviors [Kristan, 2008; Briggman & Kristan, 2008;
Wojcik et al., 2014]. Our goal is to gain insight into the fundamental and universal rules governing pattern
formation in complex networks of neurons. To achieve this goal, we should identify the rules underlying

the emergence of cooperative rhythms in simple CPG networks.
Recently, a great deal of computational studies have been focused on a range of 3-cell motifs of bursting
neurons coupled by chemical (inhibitory and excitatory) and electrical synapses to disclose the role of
coupling in generating sets of coexisting rhythmic outcomes, see [Shilnikov et al., 2008; Wojcik et al., 2011,
2014; Schwabedal et al., 2014, 2015; Collens et al., 2015] and references therein. These network structures
reflect the known physiological details of various CPG networks in real animals. Next, we would like to
explore dynamics and stability of some identified CPG circuits constituted by 4-cells [Jalil et al., 2013].
Examples of such sub-networks can be found in the cerebral crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG)
[Selverston, 1985; Prinz et al., 2003b, 2004; Marder, 2012], as well as in the swim CPGs of the sea slugs
– Melibe leonina (depicted during swimming in Fig. 1(a)) and Dendronotus iris [Newcomb et al., 2012;
Sakurai et al., 2011; Sakurai & Katz, 2011]. Our greater goal is to create dynamical foundations for the
onset, morphogenesis and structural robustness of rhythmic activity patterns produced by swim CPGs in
these animals. A pilot mathematical model of the Melibe swim CPG will be discussed in this paper. The
circuitry shown in Fig. 2(a) depicts only some core elements identified in the biological CPG; its detailed
diagram can be found in [Sakurai et al., 2014].

made of coupled biophysically plausible models. Our first simplifying assumption is that CPGs are made
of universal building blocks – half center oscillations (HCOs) [Hill et al., 2003]. Loosely speaking, a HCO
is treated as a pair of interneurons interacting with each other through reciprocally inhibitory synapses
and exhibiting anti-phase bursting. The interneurons of a HCO can be endogenous bursters, tonic spiking
or quiescent ones, which exhibit alternating bursting only when they inhibit each other. Theoretical studies [Wang & Rinzel, 1985] have indicated that formation of an anti-phase bursting rhythm is always based
on slow subsystem dynamics. There are three basic mechanisms to generate alternating bursting in the
HCO: release, escape, and post-inhibitory rebound (PIR). The first mechanism is typical for endogenously
bursting neurons [Jalil et al., 2010, 2012]. The other two mechanisms underlie network bursting in HCOs
comprised of neurons, which are hyperpolarized quiescent in isolation [Perkel & Mulloney, 1974; Skinner
et al., 1994b; Angstadt et al., 2005; Kopell & Ermentrout, 2002]. Our second assumption is that the swim
CPG interneurons are intrinsic tonic spikers that become network bursters only when externally driven
or coupled by inhibitory synapses, as recent experimental studies suggest [Sakurai et al., 2014]. The third
assumption is that network bursting in the Melibe swim CPG is parabolic, i.e. the spike frequency within a
burst increases at the middle, and decreases at the ends, as one can observe from Fig. 3. This observation
indicates the type of neuronal models to be employed to describe network cores. Our model of choice for
parabolic bursting is the Plant model [Plant & Kim, 1975, 1976; Plant, 1981]. The Plant model has been
developed to accurately describe the voltage dynamics of the R15 neuron in a mollusk Aplysia Californica,
which has turned out to be an endogenous burster [Levitan & Levitan, 1988]. Most dynamical properties
of the R15 neuron have been modeled and studied in detail [Canavier et al., 1991; Bertran, 1993; Butera
et al., 1995; Butera, 1998; Sieling & Butera, 2011; Ji et al., 2013].

2. Methods: the Plant model of parabolic bursting
The conductance based Plant model [Plant, 1981] for the R15 neuron [Sieling & Butera, 2011] located in
the abdominal ganglion of a slug Aplysia Californica is given by the following set of ordinary differential
equations derived within the framework of the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism to describe the dynamics of the
fast inward sodium [Na], outward potassium [K], slow TTX-resistant calcium [Ca] and an outward calcium
sensitive potassium [KCa] currents:
Cm V̇ = −IN a − ICa − IKCa − Ileak − Iext − Isyn .

(1)

The last three currents are the generic ohmic leak Ileak , external constant Iext and synaptic Isyn currents
flowing from a pre-synaptic neuron. The full details of the representation of the currents employed in the
model are given in the Appendix below.

distribution of spikes within a burst is a feature of this kind of bursting. The parameters are ρ = 0.00015ms−1 , Kc = 0.00425ms−1
and τx = 9400ms.

There are two bifurcation parameters in the individual model. The first one is the constant external
current, Iext , which is set Iext = 0. Following [Shilnikov, 2012], the other bifurcation parameter, ∆, is
introduced in the slowest equation:
˙ = ρ (Kc x(VCa − V + ∆) − Ca)
Ca
(2)
describing the concentration of the intracellular calcium in the Plant model. By construction, ∆ is a
deviation from a mean value of the reversal potential VCa = 140mV evaluated experimentally for the
calcium current in the R15 cells. As such, this makes ∆ a bifurcation parameter. Secondly its variations
are not supposed to alter the topology of the slow motion manifolds in the 5D phase space, which are called
tonic spiking and quiescent in the mathematical neuroscience context, as they are made of, respectively,
round periodic orbits and equilibrium states [of the slow subsystem] of the model (Fig. 5).
At ∆ = 0, the neuron is an endogenous burster, see Fig. 4. According to [Rinzel & Lee, 1987], this
type of bursting is termed parabolic. The reason for this term is that the spike frequency within bursts is
maximized in the middle of bursts and minimized at the beginning and the end (see Fig. 4c). The parabolic
structure of a burst is due to the calcium-activated potassium current. Its magnitude is determined by
the intracellular calcium concentration. As the intracellular calcium concentration increases, the calcium

dependent potassium current gets activated, which causes an increase of the inward potassium current. As
the membrane potential increases over a threshold value, the intracellular calcium concentration decreases,
as well as the inward potassium current (see Eq. (20) in the Appendix). The parabolic distribution of
spikes within bursts is shown in Fig. 4. The instant frequency value is calculated by the reciprocal of each
inter-spike interval. Panels b and c of Fig. 4 clearly disclose the parabolic inter-spike structure of bursts.
It was shown in [Rinzel & Lee, 1987] that the mechanism underlying a transition between quiescent and
tonic spiking of bursting in the Plant model is due to a homoclinic bifurcation of a saddle-node equilibrium
state [Shilnikov, 1963; Afraimovich et al., 2014]. This bifurcation occurs in the fast 3D (V, h, n)-subspace
of the model and is modulated by the 2D slow dynamics in the (Ca, x)-variables, which are determined
by slow oscillations of the intracellular calcium concentration [Plant & Kim, 1975, 1976]. The unfolding
of this codimension-one bifurcation includes an onset of a stable equilibrium, which is associated with a
hyperpolarized phase of bursting, and on the other end, an emergent stable periodic orbit that is associated
with tonic spiking phase of bursting. The period of this stable orbit decreases, as it moves further away
from the saddle-node equilibrium mediated by decreasing calcium concentration. The period of the tonic
spiking orbit grows with no upper bound as it approaches the homoclinic loop of the saddle-node [Shilnikov
et al., 1998,2001].
Variations of ∆ change the duty cycle of bursting, which is a ratio of the active tonic spiking phase of
bursting to its period. Decreasing ∆ reduces the inactive, quiescent phase of bursting, i.e. increases its duty
cycle. Zero duty cycle is associated with the homoclinic saddle-node bifurcation that makes the neuron
hyperpolarized quiescent. This corresponds to an emergence of stable equilibrium state for all dynamical
variables of the model (1). In other words, decreasing ∆ makes the active phase longer, so that below a
threshold ∆ = −32mV the neuron switches to tonic spiking activity. Tonic spiking activity is associated with
the emergence of a stable periodic orbit in the fast (V, h, n)-subspace, while the (Ca, x)-variables of the slow
subspace converge to a stable equilibrium state. As such, bursting occurs in the Plant and similar models
due to relaxation of periodic oscillations in the 2D (Ca, x)-subspace, which slowly modulates fast tonic
spiking oscillations in the (V, h, n) variables. The relaxation limit cycles emerge from one and collapse into
the other equilibrium state in the (Ca, x)-plane through Andronov-Hopf bifurcations, which can be subor super-critical. At the transitions between bursting and tonic spiking, and bursting and hyperpolarized
quiescence, the neuron can produce chaotic dynamics, which are basically due to the membrane potential
oscillatory perturbations of plain canards at the folds of the relaxation cycle.

= 0.001nS, from the pre-synaptic neuron 2 at
t = 60sec. Halting the inhibitory drive restores tonic spiking activity in the targeted neuron (not shown).

3. Endogenous and network bursting. Inhibitory and excitatory drives
A half-center oscillator is a network of two neurons coupled by reciprocally inhibitory synapses that robustly
produces bursting in alternation, or anti-phase bursting. Such a network can be multistable, i.e. produce
other bursting rhythms as well, such as synchronous bursting [Jalil et al., 2010] and rhythmic outcomes
with slightly shifted phase lags between the endogenously bursting neurons [Jalil et al., 2012].
In this study, the synaptic current Isyn is modeled through the fast threshold modulation (FTM)
approach [Kopell & Somers, 1993]. The synapses are assumed to be fast and non-delayed, which is true for
the swim CPG in both sea slugs under consideration. The synaptic current is given by
1
Isyn = gsyn (Vpost − Esyn )
,
(3)
−k(V
pre −Θsyn )
1+e
where gsyn is the maximal conductance of the current, which is used as a bifurcation parameter of the
networked model; Vpost (t) and Vpre (t) are the voltages on the post-synaptic (driven) and pre-synaptic
(driving) neurons; Esyn is the synaptic reversal potential. To make Isyn excitatory, we set Esyn = 40mV ,
while in the inhibitory case we set Esyn = −80mV . In Eq. (3), the second term is a Boltzmann coupling
function that quickly, (k = 100), turns the synaptic current on and off as soon the voltage, Vpre , of the
(driving) pre-synaptic cell(s) raises above and falls below the synaptic threshold, here Θsyn = 0mV (Fig. 5).
To model the constant synaptic drive onto the post-synaptic neuron, we assume that Vpre > Θsyn .
This allows us to calibrate the state of the post-synaptic neuron, and to determine the drive threshold
that separates the qualitatively distinct states of the individual and networked neurons. This statement is
illustrated in Fig. 6 by simulating responses of the endogenous parabolic burster to network perturbation.
Figure 6(a) shows, with a properly adjusted excitatory drive, that the endogenous burster switches into
tonic spiking activity. On the other hand, bursting in the networked neuron can be halted when it receives
a sufficient inhibitory drive from the pre-synaptic neuron of the network (Figure 6(b)). Eliminating either
drive makes the post-synaptic neuron return to its natural state, i.e. these experiments de-facto prove that
the neuron is mono-stable for the given parameter values.
A HCO, in the canonical Brown definition [Graham-Brown, 1911], is a pair of neurons bursting in
anti-phase when they are networked by inhibitory synapses. In isolation, such neurons are not endogenous
bursters but tonic spikers instead, or remain quiescent [Marder & Calabrese, 1996]. There are multiple
mechanisms underlying such anti-phase bursting, or, more accurately, anti-phase oscillations in HCOs and
CPGs made of relaxation oscillators [Kopell & Ermentrout, 2002; Daun et al., 2009]. The list includes the
well studied mechanisms of post-inhibitory rebound and escape for quiescent neurons [Perkel & Mulloney,
1974; Wang & Rinzel, 1985; Skinner et al., 1994b; Destexhe et al., 1994; Matveev et al., 2007], as well as
less-known mechanisms of HCOs constituted by intrinsically spiking neurons. Such networks utilizing the
Plant models are discussed below.
To construct such a HCO with relatively weak inhibitory coupling, the Plant model must be first set
into the tonic spiking mode. This is done by setting the bifurcation parameter, ∆ = −34mV , see Fig. 7.

the inhibition restores tonic spiking activity in both neurons, and vice versa. Here, the the network parameters are gsyn
=
0.008nS and Esyn = −80mV , and the parameters of the individual neurons are the following: ∆ = −60mV, ρ = 0.0003ms−1 ,
Kc = 0.0085ms−1 , τx = 235ms and x∞ (V ) = 1/(1 + e−0.15(V +50) ).

Next, we consider a unidirectional network where the tonic spiking neuron 1 starts receiving, an inhibitory
drive of gsyn = 0.001nS from the post-synaptic neuron 2 at t = 60sec. The inhibitory drive is sufficient to
shift the post-inhibitory neuron over the bifurcation transition back into bursting activity. The minimal
inhibitory drive must be increased proportionally to make the targeted neuron a network burster whenever
it stays further away from the bifurcation transition between tonic spiking and bursting in isolation.

4. Forming a half-center oscillator
In this section, we discuss the dynamics of half-center oscillators made of two tonically spiking Plant neurons
reciprocally coupled by inhibitory synapses. As before, we describe such synapses within the framework
of the fast threshold modulation (FTM) paradigm using Eq. (3) to match the shape and magnitude of
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the post-synaptic neurons. IPSPs are the indicators of the
type and the strength of synapses in the network.
We perform simulations in a fashion that is analogous to the dynamic clamp technique used in neurophysiological experiments. The approach involves the dynamic block, restoration and modulation of
synaptic connections during simulation. These modeling perturbations should closely resemble the experimental techniques of drug-induced synaptic blockade, modulation, wash-out, etc. Restoring the chemical
synapses during a simulation makes the HCO regain network bursting activity with specific phase characteristics. Depending on the coupling strength as well as the way the tonically spiking neurons are clamped,
the network bursting may change phase-locked states, i.e. be potentially multi-stable. Experimental observations also suggest specific constraints on the range of coupling strengths of the reciprocal inhibition,
such that the networks stably and generically achieve the desired phase-locking.
Figure 8 demonstrates the stages of anti-phase bursting formation in the HCO. The uncoupled neurons
are initiated in tonic spiking mode. After turning on the reciprocally inhibitory synapses gsyn = 0.008nS,
the HCO quickly transitions to the regime of robust anti-phase bursting. Turning off the synapses restores
the native tonic spiking activity in both neurons. Turning on the reciprocal synapses makes the HCO
regain the network bursting. Note that the length of transients from tonic spiking to network bursting
depends on the strength of the synaptic coupling for the fixed parameters of the individual Plant neurons.
By comparing the magnitude of IPSPs in the voltage traces represented in Figs. 8 and 9, one can conclude
that the coupling in the later case is weaker. This is why, the onset of network bursting in the HCO is less
pronounced.
Our modeling studies agree well with experimental recordings from the identified interneurons in the
Melibe swim CPG which suggests that the observed bursting is due to synergetic interactions of interneurons
of the network [Sakurai et al., 2014]. One can see from Fig. 1(b) that network bursting in the biological
HCO formed by two Si3 interneurons of the Melibe swim CPG is seized as soon as the right one, Si3R,

receives a negative current pulse that makes it hyperpolarized quiescent, while its left bursting counterpart,
Si3L, turns into tonic spiking activity instead. Moreover, one can deduct from the wiring diagram of the
CPG depicted in Fig. 2(a) and the analysis of voltage traces represented in Fig. 1(b) that the interneuron
Si2L becomes a tonic-spiker as soon as the pre-synaptic interneuron Si3R stops inhibiting it (compare
with Fig. 8.) This further supports the assertion that the swim CPG is made of intrinsically tonic spiking
interneurons.
To test the robustness of network anti-phase bursting to perturbation and to calibrate the necessary
influx of reciprocal inhibition generated by the Plant neurons, we consider a HCO with excitatory autapses.
The objective here is to determine an equivalent amount of excitatory drive to be projected onto the postinhibitory network burster to cancel out the inhibitory drive and shift it back to the initial tonic-spiking
mode.
An autapse is a synapse of a neuron onto itself, where the axon of the neuron ends on its own dendrite.
After their discovery [Van der Loos & Glaser, 1972] autapses have been observed in a range of nervous
systems. The autapses are arguably to be responsible for tuning of neural networks. This particular configuration of the HCO depicted in Fig. 10 is formally motivated by the swim CPG circuitry, see Fig. 2(a).
One can see from it that the interneurons of the bottom HCO receive excitatory drives from the top interneurons forming the top HCO. We would like to find the threshold over which the neurons no longer
form a stably bursting HCO. This would allow us to calibrate and quantify the relative strengths of the
mixed synaptic connections in the swim CPG models.
In this HCO configuration, each neuron inhibits its counterpart and self-excites through the autapse.
Both autapses are introduced to the model using the FTM approach with Eaut = 40mV . In this experiment,

5. Assembly line of a Melibe swim CPG
In this final section, we put together a pilot model of the Melibe swim CPG according to a circuitry based
on identified interneurons and synapses; its wiring diagram is sketched in Fig. 2(a). This network model
is made of the two HCOs constituted by tonic spiking Plant neurons. We would like to find out whether
this sample CPG model can already produce phase lags similar to those between bursting interneurons in
the biological CPG. For the sake of simplicity, we do not include Si4R/L interneurons in the model and
we also omit electrical synapses. It is known from experimental studies [Sakurai et al., 2014] that blocking
chemical, inhibitory and excitatory synapses between the interneurons may be sufficient to break down
the motor pattern by the network. Figure 2(b) points out that the interneurons of either HCO burst in
anti-phase and there is the characteristic 3/4 phase lag between the burst initiation in the neurons Si2L
and Si3L, as well as between Si2R and Si3L. This phase lag is repeatedly observed in both adult and
juvenile animals.
As before, we use the Plant neurons initiated in the tonic spiking mode, relatively close to the transition
to bursting. Initial conditions of the neurons are randomized. After letting the neurons settled down to tonic
spiking activity, the network connections are turned on. As Fig. 11 shows, with the reciprocal inhibition
being first turned on, the bottom interneurons Si3L and Si3R become anti-phase network bursters, and
so do Si2R and Si2L as soon as the reciprocal inhibition between them is turned them on, too. At this
stage, the CPG model is formed by two uncoupled HCOs. A few seconds later, they become coupled by

simultaneous turning on the unidirectional cross-lateral inhibition from Si3R(L) projected onto Si2L(R),
and bi-lateral excitation from Si2R(L) down onto Si3R(L). One can see from this figure that all four
interneurons of the CPG model exhibit network bursting with the desired phase lags. These are 0.5 (half
period) between the interneurons of each HCO, and 3/4 (a fraction of the network period) between the
HCOs, or between the corresponding reference interneurons Si2L and Si3L. We note that such a phase
shift was reported in a similar Melibe swim CPG constituted by endogenous bursters; that model also
incorporated electrical synapses [Jalil et al., 2013]. There is a great room for improvement of CPG network
models to include other identified interneurons and to incorporate additional electrical synapses to find
out whether additions of new elements can stabilize or desynchronize the desired bursting pattern as it
was done using the Poincaré return maps for endogenous bursters [Wojcik et al., 2014]. Of our special
interest are various problems concerning structural stability of the network, and its robustness (Lyapunov
stability) for bursting outcomes subjected to perturbations by pulses of the external current, as well as
reductions to return maps between burst initiations in constituent neurons. These questions are beyond
the scopes of the given examination and will be addressed in full detail in our forthcoming publications
soon. The question about a possible linking of the characteristic 34 phase lag and the Melibe leonina lateral
swim style is the paramount one among them.

6. Summary
We have discussed a basic procedure for building network bursting CPGs made of intrinsically tonic spiking
neurons. As a model for such networks, we have employed the biophysically plausible Plant model that
was originally proposed to describe endogenous bursting R15-cells in the Aplysia mollusk. Such bursting
was intracellularly recorded, and identified as parabolic, from the known interneurons in the swim CPGs of
two sea slugs: Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris. There is experimental evidence that bursting in these
swim CPGs is due to synergetic interactions of all constituent neurons that are intrinsic tonic-spikers in
isolation. To model the Melibe swim CPG, we have first examined dynamical and structural properties of
the Plant model and its responses to perturbations. These perturbations include inhibitory and excitatory
inputs from pre-synaptic neurons in the network. We have identified the transition boundary beyond
which the bursting Plant model becomes a tonic-spiker and shifted it slightly over the threshold using an
introduced bifurcation parameter. We have shown that the perturbed/calibrated Plant neuron, exhibiting
intrinsically tonic spiking activity, becomes a network burster when it receives an inhibitory drive from
a pre-synaptic neuron. By combining two such neurons, we have created a genuine half-center oscillator
robustly producing anti-phase bursting dynamics. We have also considered a HCO configuration with two
excitatory autapses to assess the robustness of anti-phase bursting with respect to excitatory perturbations.
Finally, we have employed all necessary components to assemble a truncated model of the Melibe swim CPG
with the characteristic 3/4-phase lags between the bursting onsets in the four constituent interneurons.
In future studies, we plan to examine the dynamics of the CPG models with all synaptic connections,
including electrical, as well as incorporating additional identified interneurons. We will also explore their
structural stability, robustness and potential multi-stability of their bursting outcomes with various phase
lags. An additional goal is to find out whether the motor pattern with the 3/4-phase lags will persist
in networks with interneurons represented by other mathematical models including phenomenologically
reduced ones. Potentially, these findings shall provide a systematic basis for comprehension of plausible
biophysical mechanisms for the origination and regulation of rhythmic patterns generated by various CPGs.
Our goal is to extend and generalize the dynamical principles disclosed in the considered networks for other
neural systems besides locomotion, such as olfactory cellular networks.
