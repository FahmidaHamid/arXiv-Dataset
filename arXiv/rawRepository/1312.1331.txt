Abstract
Bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is one of the ion-driven molecular machines, which drives the rotation
of flagellar filaments and enable bacteria to swim in viscous solutions. Understanding its mechanism is
one challenge in biophysics. Based on previous models and inspired by the idea used in description of
motor proteins, in this study one two-state model is provided. Meanwhile, according to corresponding
experimental data, mathematical relationship between BFM membrane voltage and pH value of the
environment, and relationship between internal and external sodium concentrations are given. Therefore,
with model parameter values obtained by fitting theoretical results of torque-speed relation to recent
experimental data, many biophysical properties of bacterial flagellar motor can be obtained for any pH
values and any external sodium concentrations. Including the rotation speed, stall torque (i.e. the torque
generated by BFM), rotation dispersion, and rotation randomness. In this study, the single-stator BFM
will be firstly analyzed, and then properties of multiple-stator BFM are addressed briefly.

Author Summary
Based on previous models for BFM and the idea used in the modeling of motor protein kinesin,
one two-state model is present to discuss biophysical properties of BFM. From this model torque-speed
relationship, dispersion and randomness of single-stator BFM can be obtained for any pH values and any
external sodium concentrations. Meanwhile properties of BFM with multiple stators are also discussed.

Introduction
Ion-motive force (IMF), which comprises electrical and chemical transmembrane potential, is essential
for biophysical functioning of cells [1–4]. Two primary forms of IMF are proton-motive force (PMF) and
sodium-motive force (SMF). Many cellular processes, including bacterial motility, ATP synthesis and
active membrane transport, are driven by SMF [5–8]. Recently, molecular machines driven by IMF have
been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. The studies in [9–12] found that, the
energy efficiency of the F1 part of F0 F1 -ATP synthase, which transduces energy between chemical free
energy and mechanical work, is almost 100%. In [13,14], coarse-grained models are employed to under the
mechanism of F1 -ATPpase and F0 -ATPase. Meanwhile, the catalytic power of F1 -ATPpase is detailed
analyzed in [15], the structure and organization of the yeast F0 F1 -ATP synthase are studied in [16], and
the Na+ , K+ -ATPase in liposomal membrane are discussed in [17]. Finally, more theoretical studies can
also be found in [18–32] for F0 -ATPase or F1 -ATPase, and in [33–41] for transmembrane motion of ions.
One of the most important molecular machines driven by IMF is bacterial flagellar motor (BFM),
which couples ion flow (H+ or Na+ ) to the rotation of extracellular helical flagellar filaments at hundreds
of revolutions per second (Hz), and then propels many species of swimming bacteria [42]. Using the transmembrane electrochemical H+ (or Na+ ) gradient to power rotation of the flagellar motor, free-swimming
bacteria can propel their cell body at a speed of 15-100 mm/s, or up to 100 cell body lengths/s [6,43]. The
BFM has one rotor and multiple stators in a circular ring-like structure ≈ 45 nm in diameter [44]. The
stators are attached to the rigid peptidoglycan cell wall and the spinning of the rotor drives the flagellar
filament through a short hook. In E. coli, the rotor is composed of a ring of ∼26 FliG proteins and
each stator has 4 copies of proteins MotA and 2 copies of proteins MotB, forming 2 proton-conducting
transmembrane channels [45,46]. The stator can deliver torque to the rotor by converting the free energy
of ion flow across the cytoplasmic membrane.
To understand the biophysical properties and torque-generating mechanism of BFM, many experiments have been done to measure revolution speed under varying torque [47–55]. Meanwhile, various
biophysical and biochemical models have also been constructed to try to understand the basic principle
of BFM [45–47, 56–59]. However, so far most of the previous studies mainly focused on the torque-speed
relationship, except in [54, 58] where effect of pH value on torque-speed relation is discussed, and in [59]
where effects of pH value and membrane potential are analyzed theoretically, and in [45, 48, 49, 57] where

2

the effect of temperature (or noise) on the speed of BFM is addressed, and in [50, 51] where the effect of
Na+ concentration is studied experimentally.
In recent study of Lo et al [60], one three-state model was presented to describe the torque-speed
relationship of one-stator BFM under various pH values and various external sodium concentrations.
Their model can fit experimental data well, in which one of the basic parameters is the electrical energy
U = qVm , with Vm the membrane voltage. Experimental data shows that membrane voltage Vm depends
on surrounding solution (see [60] and references there in). This study found that, the value of Vm depends
only on the pH value of the solution, and is independent of the external sodium concentration [Na]ex [see
Fig. 1(a)]. Moveover, Vm changes almost linearly with pH value,

Vm = −28.04pH + 57.88,

(1)

with voltage in millivolt unit (mV). On the other hand, besides pH value and external sodium concentration [Na]ex , the value of internal sodium concentration [Na]in is also needed to obtain the sodium-motive
force, since it comprises electrical transmembrane potential Vm and chemical transmembrane potential
∆µ/q and is defined as
SMF = Vm +

(2)

where q = 1.602 × 10−19 coulomb (C) is the charge of sodium ion, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is
the absolute temperature. Further analysis about the experimental data shows that the internal sodium
concentration [Na]in can be well approximated by [see Fig. 1(b)]

[Na]in = 9.013[Na]ex /(1.318 + [Na]ex ).

(3)

In fact, this relation is similar as the one used to approximate ADP concentration by ATP concentration
in the study of motor protein kinesin [61].
Different with the three-state model used in [60], in this study one simple two-state model will be
presented to describe the rotation of one-stator BFM. With relationships (1) and (3), properties for
one-stator BFM under any pH values and external sodium concentrations will be obtained, such as the
torque-speed relationship, the stall torque Γs (i.e. the torque under which the rotation speed V of BFM
vanishes), dispersion D and randomness r. The results show that, both rotation speed V and stall

3

torque Γs increase with pH value and sodium concentration [Na]ex . Under high pH value and sodium
concentration [Na]ex , the rotation of one-stator BFM can be regarded as one Possion process, i.e. process
with only one internal state. Meanwhile, in this study properties of BFM with multiple stators will also
be discussed.

Results
In previous studies, four-state model is usually used to describe the rotation of BFM [50, 53, 54].
However, such model has 25 free model parameters which makes it difficult to fit corresponding data, and
special Monte Carlo search strategy should be given to overcome this difficulty [60]. For simplicity, and
inspired by the corresponding idea used in the modeling of motor proteins [61, 62], one two-state model
is presented in this study. Compared with the four-state model, this two-stator model has only 10 free
parameters, which is even less than that of the reduced three-state model as used in [60]. Moreover, by
this two-state model, it is much convenient to do further theoretical analysis to know more biophysical
properties about the rotation of BFM. For example, the dispersion D and randomness r = 2D/V ϕ can
be easily obtained. At the same time, by the relationship between membrane voltage Vm and pH value
as given in Eq. (1), and the relationship between internal sodium concentration [Na]in and external
sodium concentration [Na]ex as given in Eq. (3), properties of BFM rotation can be obtained for any pH
values and any external sodium concentrations (in the recent paper of Lo et al [60], only torque-speed
relationships for pH=5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, and external sodium concentration [Na]ex =1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, 30
mM, 85 mM are provided, see also Fig. 3). The fitting results given in Fig. 3 show that, with appropriate
parameter values (see TABLE 1), this two-state model can explain experimental data reasonably.
As mentioned previously, using formulations given in Eqs. (1) and (3), properties of BFM rotation
can be obtained for any pH values and any external sodium concentrations [Na]ex . The plots in Fig. 4
show that, under any external torques BFM rotation speed V increases monotonically with pH value and
external sodium concentration [Na]ex . For high concentration [Na]ex and pH values, V increases almost
experimentally with pH value. Further calculations indicate that, with the increase of sodium concentration [Na]ex , the rotation speed V will tend to one limit value. Since for high external concentration
[Na]ex , the internal concentration [Na]in , and consequently the transition rate k4 , is almost invariable
[see Eq. (3)]. So the rotation speed as given in Eq. (6) satisfies V → k3 ϕ.

4

The plots in Fig. 5 show that, the stall torque Γs , i.e. the torque which satisfies V (Γs ) = 0, increases
linearly with pH value and almost linearly with the logarithm of external sodium concentration ln[Na]ex ,
see also Eq. (7). So concentrations of proton and sodium ion not only have effect on rotation speed V ,
but also can change the maximum output work Wmax = Γs ϕ [63, 64]. Further calculations show that
other biophysical quantities, such as the maximum output power Pmax = maxΓ ΓV (Γ), and efficiency at
maximum output power ηmax = Γmax /Γs , depend also on pH value and sodium concentration [Na]ex [65].
Where Γmax is the external torque under which the output power of BFM reaches its maximum Pmax .
Besides rotation speed V and stall torque Γs , the dispersion D of BFM rotation also increases with
pH value and external sodium concentration [Na]ex , see Fig. 6(a, b) . Here dispersion D, also called
effective diffusion constant, is defined by D = 1/2 limt→∞ d[hθ2 (t)i − hθ(t)i2 ]/dt [61, 66, 67]. However,
with the increase of pH value and external sodium concentration [Na]ex , the randomness r = 2D/V ϕ
decreases to 1 monotonically. Which means that, under high pH value and high sodium concentration
[Na]ex , the BFM rotation is just one Possion process [68]. As discussed before, in such cases, the forward
k

k

3
transition 1 −→
2 is fast, and the rotation is mainly limited by the forward transition 2 −→
1, see Fig.

2(b).
Since one BFM may include multiple stators, the external torque is then shared by all the working
stators. So the stall torque of BFM with n stators should be n times of which of the single stator BFM,
while the maximum rotation speeds (i.e. speeds without external torque) are the same [45, 47, 60], see
Fig. 7. However, for a BFM with M stators, the M stators may not work all the time. In other words,
some stators may be dissociated from the rotor of BFM. So they are in idle state, or their rotation have
no effective contribution to the BFM rotation. Therefore, for multiple stator BFM, the torque-speed
relationship may be different from the ones plotted in Fig. 7. Actually, the actual rotation speed is
slightly lower than that plotted in Fig. 7 (figures not shown here). In the following, the properties of
BFM with multiple stators will be discussed.
Three examples of probability pn that there are n stators in working to rotate the BFM are given in
Fig. 8(a) for a BFM with total M = 8 stators. Although most of stators are engaged in the rotation of
BFM, some may in unbinding state, especially when the external torque is low. The plots in Fig. 8(b)
show that the mean binding number hni of stator increases slightly with the external torque Γ, but is
always less than the total stator number M . This indicates that, the BFM can adjust itself with the
external torque, if the torque is low some stators may in idle state to save energy. Meanwhile, the mean

5

binding number hni increases with sodium concentration [Na]ex [see Fig. 8(c)]. Since with high sodium
concentration [Na]ex the transition rates k1 , k4 are high [see Fig. 2(b) and discussion below Eq. (5)],
consequently stators are more likely to transfer to the binding state 2. Finally, the mean binding number
hni decreases with the pH value, see Fig. 8(d).
As mentioned before, usually the mean rotation speed V =

PM

n=1

pn Vn of a BFM with M stators is

lower than its maximum speed VM [the BFM speed provided all the M stators are bound to the BFM
rotor (see Fig. 7 for VM )]. But the plots in Fig. 9(a,b,c) show that, similar as VM , mean rotation speed
V also decreases with external torque Γ, and increases with sodium concentration [Na]ex and pH value
[also experimentally for large [Na]ex and pH value, Fig. 4(a)]. This is because V is merely the linear
combination of Vn for n = 1, 2, · · · , M . As expected, the mean stall torque Γs increases with sodium
concentration [Na]ex and pH value, and increased almost linearly with the total stator number M .

Discussion
In this study, the sodium driven bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is theoretically analyzed. Based on
the previous models used in [50, 53, 54, 60] and the idea used in [61, 62] for modeling description of motor
protein kinesin, one simple two-state model is presented. Moreover, according to the experimental data
collected in [60], relationship between membrane voltage and pH value, and relationship between internal
and external sodium concentrations are explicitly given. So, by the two-state model, rotation speed of
BFM can be obtained for any pH values and any external sodium concentrations. Meanwhile, in this
study other biophysical properties of BFM are also studied, including stall torque (the torque under which
the BFM rotation speed vanishes), dispersion and randomness. In reality, one BFM may have multiple
stators. In this study, the properties of multiple-stator BFM are also addressed. Roughly speaking, the
stall torque of a M -stator BFM is about M times of which of a single-stator BFM, and the external
torque of BFM are usually shared by all the M stators. But under low torque, low sodium concentration
and high pH value, some stators may be disassociated from BFM rotor and in idle state. Using this
two-state model, other detailed biophysical properties can also be obtained, such as the maximum power
and energy efficiency [64, 65, 69].

Materials and Methods
Two-state kinetic model for one-stator BFM
The two-state model used in this study, which is schematically depicted in Fig. 2(a), can be regarded
as one combination of the three-state model presented in [60] for BFM and the two-state model given
in [61] for motor protein kinesin. In brief, the rotation of stator can be regarded as motion of a particle in
one tilted periodic potential G(θ) with period ϕ = 2π/N , i.e. periodic rotation with step-size ϕ. Where
N is the number of ions passing through stator per revolution, and as in [60], N = 37 is used in this
study. The same as in the modeling for motor protein kinesin [61], in each period potential G(θ) has
two minima, corresponding to two transition states of stator when one ion passes through it. Or in other
words, the stator has two states in each rotation step (with step-size ϕ), denoted by 1 and 2 respectively.
Mathematically, the periodic rotation of stator can be simply described by the following Markov process
(see also Fig. 2(b))

During the forward rotation from state 1 to state 2, stator should overcome energy barrier ∆G1 , so the
transition rate k1 ∝ e−∆G1 /kB T . Similarly, ki ∝ e−∆Gi /kB T for i = 2, 3, 4. Where energy barrier ∆Gi
depends on external torque Γ. Similar to the method as demonstrated in models of molecular motor and
microtubule [61, 70, 71], this torque dependence can be approximated as follows
∆G1 = ∆G01 + 1 Γϕ,

∆G2 = ∆G02 − 2 Γϕ,

∆G3 = ∆G03 + 3 Γϕ,

∆G4 = ∆G04 − 4 Γϕ.

Where ∆G0i (for i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are intrinsic energy barriers, i.e. energy barriers when external torque Γ
P4
vanishes. Parameters i are load distribution factors which satisfy normalization condition i=1 i = 1.
The electrical energy U released by one ion when passing through stator can be decomposed into two
parts, U = U1 +U2 := (∆G02 −∆G01 )+(∆G04 −∆G03 ), with U1 the energy released during forward transition

Obviously, large electrical energy U and low external torque Γ will result in high forward transition
rates k1 and k3 , but result in low backward transition rates k2 and k4 , and consequently will lead to high
rotation speed. Similar as in [60], rates k10 , k40 depend on external and internal sodium concentrations
[Na]ex and [Na]in respectively. For simplicity, this study assumed that k10 = k̂10 [Na]ex , and k40 = k̂40 [Na]in
[61, 62]. As mentioned previously, electrical energy U can be obtained by U = qVm , with membrane
voltage Vm satisfying the formulation in Eq. (1).
Given the transition rates k1 , k2 , k3 , k4 (see Fig. 2(b)), the mean rotation speed V and dispersion D
of BFM can be easily obtained (see [63, 66, 67])

TABLE 1.

Analysis for multiple-stator BFM
Generally, one BFM may include multiple stators. Let λk (Γ), µk (Γ) be the binding and unbinding
rates of stators to and from BFM rotor, provided that there are k binding stators. One can easily get

8

the the following equations

dt
dpM
=λM −1 (Γ)pM −1 − M µM (Γ)pM .

(8)
Where pn is the probability that BFM rotor is bound by n stators, M is the total number of stators, and

λn (Γ) = k1 (Γ/(n + 1)) + k4 (Γ/(n + 1)),

µn (Γ) = k2 (Γ/n) + k3 (Γ/n).

(9)

Here, binding/unbinding of one stator to/from BFM rotor means that this stator will/won’t be engaged in
BFM rotation. This study assumes that all binding stators share external torque Γ equally (see Eq. (9)),
which is similar as the one used for describing cargo motion in cells by multiple motor proteins [72–74].
The expressions given in Eq. (9) based on the assumption that, one stator in state 2 means it is bound
to the BFM rotor, and conversely one stator in state 1 means it is unbound from the BFM rotor.
At steady state, one can show that [66, 70]

Figure 1. (a) The relationship between pH value and membrane voltage Vm , which is used to get
electrical energy U = qVm , can be well approximated by Vm = −28.04pH + 57.88, see Eq. (1). (b) The
sodium-motive force (SMF) can be approximately obtained by
SMF = Vm + kB T /q ln[9.013/(1.318 + [Na]ex )], which means the internal sodium concentration [Na]in
can be obtained by the external sodium concentration [Na]ex , [Na]in = 9.013[Na]ex /(1.318 + [Na]ex ), see
Eq. (7). In this figure, all the data are from [60].

Figure 2. Schematic depiction of the two-state model for stator rotation. (a) The stator is assumed to
move in one tilted periodic potential G(θ) with period ϕ = 2π/N . Where N = 37 is the number of ions
which cross the membrane in each revolution of bacterial flagellar motor [60]. Under no external torque,
the energy difference in one period is equal to the electrical energy U released byP

membrane. The distribution factors i and 0i satisfy the normalization condition i=1 i = i=1 0i = 1,
and for simplicity they are assumed to be independent of external torque Γ and the electrical energy
U [65]. With the increase of external torque, the forward rotation barriers (in this figure ∆G01 , ∆G03 are
the energy barriers when external torque vanishes) will be increased, while the backward rotation
barriers (similarly, ∆G02 , ∆G04 are the backward energy barriers when external torque vanishes) will be
decreased. Consequently, the degree of the potential tilt will be decreased. The two states of the stator
are corresponding to the two minima of the potential. i ϕ is the mechanical angle between stable state
of the stator and its rotation energy barrier. The rotation speed of stator increases with electrical
energy U but decreases with external torque Γ. (b) Mathematically, the stator rotation in the periodic
tilted potential depicted in (a) can be described by one Markov process with two biochemical state,

denoted by state 1 and state 2 respectively. In which one forward biochemical cycle 1 −→

coupled with one forward mechanical rotation of angle ϕ. The transition rates ki depend on electrical
energy U , external torque Γ, ion concentration and pH value, which are given by formulations in (5).

concentration [Na]ex . For high pH value, speed V increases almost experimentally with pH. In (a, c),
the torque Γ = 0, and in (b, d), the torque Γ = 100 pN·nm. For high values of Γ and low values of pH
and sodium concentration [Na]ex , the stator will rotate reversely.

Figure 6. The dispersion D and randomness r of BFM rotation. (a) For high sodium concentration,
dispersion D increases with pH value (note, for low sodium concentration and low pH values, the
rotation speed V is negative, see Fig. 4); (b) Dispersion D increases with sodium concentration [Na]ex .
With the increase of pH value and sodium concentration, randomness r = 2D/V ϕ decreases
monotonically to 1 (c, d). Which means that, for high pH value and [Na]ex , the rotation of BFM is just
one Possion process. In all figures, the external torque is zero.

bound to BFM rotor, i.e. the duty ratio of stator is high [47]. (b) With the increase of external torque
Γ, the mean binding number hni of stator will be increased. Meanwhile, the mean binding number hni
increases with sodium concentration [Na]ex (c), but decreases with pH value (d). In all the figures, the
total number of stator is assumed to be M = 8.

by n stators, and Vn is the rotation speed of BFM if the external torque is shared by n stators. The
mean stall torque Γs is obtained by V (Γs ) = 0. Similar as the one single stator cases, the mean rotation
