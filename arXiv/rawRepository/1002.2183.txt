Abstract
Twisting and bending deformations are crucial to the biological functions
of several microfilaments such as DNA molecules. Although continuum-rod
models have emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics
of these deformations, a major roadblock in the continuum-mechanics-based
description of microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law,
which follows from its atomistic-level structure and interactions. Since firstprinciple derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic-level structure and
interactions is often impractical and so are direct experimental measurements
due to the small length-scales, a natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular-dynamics
(MD) simulations. In this paper, we describe a method based on a recently
proposed two-step inverse approach [1] for estimating the constitutive law

using a static rod model and deformed configuration data generated from
discrete-structure simulations. Furthermore, we illustrate the method on a
filament with an artificial discrete-structure. We simulate its deformation
in response to a prescribed loading using a multi-body dynamics (MBD)
solver, Hyperworks MotionView. Using position data generated from the
MBD solver, we first estimate the curvature of the filament, and subsequently
use it in the described method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between the restoring moment and curvature. Finally, we also
illustrate how the estimated constitutive law can be validated under independent loading conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Microfilaments represent a wide range of natural or synthetic microscopic
structures that are characterized by a large length-to-width aspect ratio and
exhibit large bending and twisting deformations. Examples of microfilaments include DNA molecules, microtubules, flagella, fimbriae and setae.
The functions of these biological microfilaments are directly affected by their
large nonlinear deformations and therefore it is important to understand and
model the dynamics of these deformations. Although the ideas and methods
discussed in this paper are applicable to almost all microfilaments, our motivation stems from the fact that the biological functions of DNA molecules
such as gene expression, transcription, and replication are significantly influenced by its long length-scale structural deformations such as looping [2, 3].
Recent successes of continuum-rod models in describing biologically-relevant
deformations of DNA molecules [4, 5] suggest that a continuum-rod model is
an efficient tool to describe deformations of microfilaments.
A continuum-rod model in general consists of dynamic equilibrium equations and compatibility equations, which needs to be solved respecting a
constitutive law. Although dynamic equilibrium equations and compatibility equations, which we henceforth refer to as the rod model, remain the same
for all microfilaments, the key distinguishing factor is the constitutive law.
For each microfilament, the constitutive law, which describes the relationship
between the deformation of the microfilament and the restoring forces and
moments, follows from its atomistic structure and bond stiffnesses.

The rod model equations, that is, the equilibrium and compatibility equations, reviewed in Section 2, can be recognized as four vector partial differential equations in space s and time t [6]. In this paper, we assume the
microfilament to be inextensible and unshearable. Under these assumptions,
the four rod model equations involve five vector unknowns, namely, internal
force f~(s, t), internal moment ~q(s, t), curvature vector ~κ(s, t), velocity ~v (s, t),
and angular velocity ~ω (s, t). The constitutive law serves as the fifth vector
algebraic equation that captures the restoring effect of the internal force f~
and internal moment ~q on the curvature ~κ. A general form of an elastic
constitutive law applicable to an inextensible and unshearable rod model
(discussed in Section 3) is

nal moment, and curvature vectors at each cross section, are experimentally
measured, then well-established function-approximation tools can be used to
estimate the constitutive law. Although such an approach will help circumvent approximations due to modeling assumptions, it may introduce experimental artifacts. Nonetheless, while such measurements may be conceivable
with acceptable accuracy for some laboratory-scale rods, the technology does
not yet exist for sub-micron filaments. One of the many challenges at small
length scales is that thermal fluctuations may dominate and thus corrupt any
potential measurements. Some experiments exploit thermal fluctuations to
measure persistence lengths and thus estimate average bending and torsional
stiffnesses, which are dominant parameters in a linearized, homogeneous approximation of equation (1); for example, refer to [7, 8] for such experiments
on DNA molecules. However, such simplistic constitutive laws are often inadequate in modeling the deformation of microfilaments [9, 10, 11, 12].
A more practical alternative than using experimental measurements is
to use data generated from discrete-structure simulations such as molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, which account for atomistic-level structure and
interactions, and are accurate and computationally feasible for short length
scales [13]. This alternative is already gaining attention for modeling con3

stitutive laws of several biological materials such as microtubules [14] and
DNA [15], although the attempts have been limited to estimation of only
a few parameters, wherein the form of the constitutive law is presumed a
priori, and is often presumed linear. Recently, a two-step inverse approach
~ from
has been proposed [1] that can estimate directly the vector function ψ
the discrete-structure simulations. This approach exploits state-space form
of a static rod model, and can leverage several different scenarios of input
and state measurements for the constitutive-law estimation.
In this paper, we describe a method based on the two-step inverse approach [1] for a scenario, when the equilibrium positions of individual atoms
computed from discrete-structure simulations under judiciously chosen loading conditions can provide the necessary information for estimating the effective constitutive law. In this method, which is described in Section 4, we
first estimate the curvature ~κ from the position data of the deformed configuration generated from discrete-structure simulations. This pre-processing
involves numerical differentiations and pose associated challenges [16], which
often necessitate smoothing of numerical data [4, Appendix B]. Next, following the step one of [1], we describe how the estimated curvature ~κ can be
used as a known quantity in the static rod model equations to solve for the
internal restoring force f~ and internal restoring moment q~ in static equilibrium of the deformed configuration. Finally, following the step two of [1],,
~ bea least-squares fit can be used to estimate the functional relationship ψ
tween the estimated curvature ~κ, the estimated force f~, and the estimated
moment ~q.
In Section 5, we present results illustrating the applicability of the method
on a filament with an artificial discrete-structure, which we simulate using
a multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. The artificial discrete-structure is so
chosen that the expected constitutive law is homogeneous and has no dependence on internal force f~. Furthermore, the artificial discrete-structure has a
decoupled behavior in two-axes bending and torsion. So, it suffices to present
the viability of the proposed method for planar bending about one principal
bending axis. The simplicity of the artificial discrete-structure also allows
us to offer a first-principle explanation of the estimated constitutive law as
further corroboration. We, however, emphasize that the method described
in Section 4 is versatile, but illustrating its application to a variety of general
cases is beyond the scope of this paper.
To put our method in perspective, we begin by first reviewing a general-

4

purpose 3-D formulation of the rod model [6] in Section 2, which simulates
the dynamics of large, nonlinear, deformations including intertwining [17].
In Section 3, we introduce a general, conceivable form of the constitutive law
for an inextensible and unshearable microfilament. In Section 4, we describe
the method for the estimation of the constitutive law. The method exploits
the static formulation of the rod model reviewed in Section 2. In Section 5,
we present and discuss the results illustrating the estimation method on an
artificial discrete-structure. We finally close by summarizing the conclusions
in Section 6.

interest.

In this section, we review the mathematical formulation of the rod model
[6] that involves dynamic equilibrium equations and compatibility conditions.
In the rod model, the dynamics of the microfilament deformation follows
from the rigid-body motion of its individual cross-sections. To track the
rigid body motion of each cross-section, we fix at its mass center a reference
frame âi (s, t), where the subscript i = 1, 2, 3, the independent variable s is
the unstretched centerline coordinate and the independent variable t is time.
As shown in Figure 1, we denote the position of the cross-section-fixed ref~ t). The gradient of R(s,
~ t) along s, which we denote by
erence frame by R(s,
5

~r(s, t), points along the centerline tangent t̂(s, t). Rod deformation in general
involves two-axes-bending and torsion captured by a curvature vector ~κ(s, t)
as well as shear along the two flexure axes and extension (or compression)
captured by ~r(s, t). In the stress-free (undeformed) state ~r(s, t) = t̂(s, t) and
we denote the stress-free curvature by κ~0 (s). A change in the magnitude
of ~r(s, t) captures extension (or compression), while change in its orientation with respect to âi (s, t) captures shear. The stress distribution across
the cross-section results in a net internal (tensile and shear) force f~(s, t)
and (bending and torsional) moment ~q(s, t). The rigid body motion of the
cross-section is described by its translational velocity ~v(s, t) and its angular
velocity ~ω (s, t).

element. The compatibility equations (4) and (5) follow from the space~ t) and the cross-section
time continuity of the cross-section position R(s,
orientation âi (s, t) respectively [6, Appendix 2]. A physical interpretation of
these compatibility equations is that the gradient of the translational and
angular velocities captures the time-rate of change of the rod’s deformation.
The rod model described above has been successfully exploited to offer promising insights on sequence-dependent DNA looping [4], kinking [11],
intertwining [17] and buckling of microfibril arrays [18], albeit assuming simplistic constitutive laws. Next, we discuss the constitutive law.

3. Constitutive Law for The Rod Model
In this paper, we consider the rod model for slender microfilaments under low-tension applications that dominantly involve bending and twisting
deformations. We assume that the microfilaments are inextensible and unshearable. This assumption leads to the simplification ~r(s, t) = t̂(s, t), which
is then a constant unit vector as seen from the cross-section-fixed reference
frame âi (s, t) [19]. Then, the rod model equations (2) - (5) constitute a set
of four vector partial differential equations in five vector unknowns, namely
translational velocity ~v (s, t), angular velocity ~ω (s, t), internal force f~(s, t),
internal moment ~q(s, t), and curvature vector ~κ(s, t). The nonlinear rod
model equations (2) - (5) can be solved numerically along with a fifth vector equation, the constitutive law. A general form of an elastic constitutive
law applicable to an inextensible and unshearable rod model is the algebraic
constraint

ψ ~κ, ~q, f , s = 0.
(6)

The constitutive law (6) captures the restoring effects of internal force
~
f (s, t) and internal moment ~q(s, t) on curvature vector ~κ(s, t) due to the
stress-strain relationship integrated over the rod’s cross section. It is worthwhile to note that ignoring shear and extension does not ignore their kinematic coupling with twisting and bending. This coupling is captured by
internal force f~(s, t) in the constitutive law (6). An example of a constitutive law with twist-extension coupling in inextensible rod model is presented
in [6, Section 6].
The elastic behavior of microfilaments and hence the form of their constitutive law follow from their atomistic-level interactions. In fact, there is no
clear consensus on its functional form for DNA molecules and how it maps
from the base-pair sequence. Although several experiments have provided
estimates of average torsional and bending stiffness by measuring persistence
lengths [7, 8], recent experimental observations [9] and model-fitting [10, 12]
suggest that the constitutive law may be nonlinear, wherein the kink-ability
of the molecule indicate non-convex stored energy functions [20].
Next, we present a general-purpose two-step computational method that
can exploit the rod model equations along with data generated from discrete~
structure simulations to estimate the vector function ψ.

4. Two-Step Estimation of Constitutive Law from Atomistic Structure Simulations
To estimate the effective constitutive law resulting from an atomistic pattern, we consider a cantilever microfilament of length L with several repeats
of the atomistic pattern, and consider its deformation in static equilibrium.
The cantilever is clamped at one end (at s = L) and body-fixed forces and
moments are applied to the other end (at s = 0). This loading arrangement allows us to use a static formulation of the rod model, along with the
data generated from discrete-structure simulations, in a two-step inverse approach [1, Table 1, Scenario 1] to estimate the effective constitutive law. For
employing the two-step method, we write the static rod model equations in
state-space form, which provides a general-purpose framework for a variety
of estimation scenarios as elaborated in [1, Table 1].
4.1. Static Rod Model
In static equilibrium, the rod model reduces to a time-independent formulation, that is, translational velocity ~v , angular velocity ω
~ and all partial
derivatives with respect to t in equations (2) - (5) vanish. As a result, the
compatibility equations (4) and (5) are identically satisfied and the rod model
reduces to two static equilibrium equations, namely
df~

+ ~κ × ~q = f~ × ~r − Q

(7)
(8)

in three vector unknowns, namely internal force f~(s), internal moment ~q(s)
and curvature vector ~κ(s). Since we assume that the rod is inextensible
and unshearable, ~r = t̂, a known unit vector, which remains unchanged
from reference (undeformed) configuration to deformed configuration as seen
from the cross-section-fixed reference frame âi (s, t). We also recall that in
equations (7) and (8), the derivatives are all relative to the cross-section-fixed
reference frame âi (s, t).
4.2. State-Space Form of Static Rod Model
To use the above static rod model equations, (7) and (8), in two-step
estimation method, we refer them to cross-section-fixed reference frame âi (s)
8

and write them in state-space form
dx
= f (x, u) + w,
ds

s ∈ [0, L],

(9)

by defining the state x(s) ∈ R6 as components of f~(s) and ~q(s) along âi (s),
input u(s) ∈ R3 as components of ~κ(s) along âi (s) and disturbance w(s) ∈ R6
~
as components of F~ (s) and Q(s)
along âi (s). We recognize that a causal
relationship need not exist between input u(s) and state x(s). In fact, the
constitutive law (1) imposes an algebraic constraint between input u(s) and
state x(s)
Φ (x, u, s) = 0, Φ ∈ R6 × R3 × R → R3 ,
(10)
which for a repeating atomistic pattern will have a periodicity of λ equal
to the repeat interval and therefore Φ (x, u, s) = Φ (x, u, s + λ). Note that
the state-space equation (9) is nonlinear, and moreover the state and input
must satisfy the nonlinear algebraic constraint (10). We note that the state
vector x(s) represents the force and the moment, the input u(s) represents
the curvature vector and the disturbance w(s) represents distributed load on
the cantilever. We also note that the state vector x(s) is prescribed at the
free end of the cantilever (at s = 0), thus x(0) serves as initial conditions for
the state-space equation (9) .
If the constitutive law (10) were known, the above state-space equations
could be solved as a constrained initial value problem using a Differential
Algebraic Equation (DAE) solver. Once the unknown curvature vector ~κ(s)
is solved, it can be further integrated to calculate the deformed shape of the
rod respecting the position and orientation of the clamped end (at s = L)
as summarized in Appendix A. But since the constitutive law is unknown,
we outline the following two-step method for estimating the constitutive law.
We assume that the only measurements available from the discrete structure
simulations are the reference (undeformed) and deformed configurations of
the cantilever, distributed loading w(s) and the loading x(0) at the free end.
Several other estimation scenarios based on measurement contingencies are
discussed in [1, Table 1].
4.3. Two-Step Estimation Method
In order to estimate the constitutive law (10), we first need to estimate its
arguments, the state x(s) and the input u(s) from available measurements of
a deformed state. Then, in the second step, we use function-approximation

The red arrows represent the path of information flow for a forward model simulation, while
the blue arrows represent the path of information flow for inverse modeling to estimate
the constitutive law. As seen from the chart, the inverse modeling framework uses data
(or simulated data) and model information to estimate the constitutive law. For the
results presented in this paper, the blocks shaded in green are implemented in Hyperworks
Motionview, while the blocks shaded in brown are implemented in MATLAB Simulink.

tools such as tools based on least-square fitting to identify the functional
relationship (10). The first step, in general involves state-estimation and
input-reconstruction methods depending on the available measurements [1,
Table 1]. In this paper, we have position data as an available measurement.
So, we derive the input u(s) (or equivalently, the curvature vector ~κ(s))
from the position data using equation (16) as explained next in Section 4.4)
and then solve the state-space equation (9) for the state x(s). Thus in this
scenario, we do not use state-estimation or input-reconstruction methods.
Figure 2 illustrates the implementation of two-step estimation method in
our scenario.
We note that with the input u(s) known, equation (9) becomes an un10

constrained initial value problem. We assume that accurate measurements of
the initial condition x(0) (loading at the free end) and disturbance w(s) (distributed loading) are available. Difficulties due to inaccurate/ incomplete
measurements can be circumvented by leveraging partial measurements of
state x(s) with unscented Kalman filter and/ or unscented unbiased minimumvariance (UUMV) filter as described in [1].
4.4. Estimation of Curvature Vector from Position Data
We use the position data of the reference (undeformed) and deformed
configurations to estimate the input u(s) = {~κ(s)}. Here we introduced
the notation {~κ(s)} to denote the 3 × 1 column matrix representing the
components of the physical vector ~κ(s) along âi (s):

Next, let the square matrix [R(s)] represent the rotation transformation1 of cross-section at s (or equivalently, of the cross-section-fixed frame
âi (s)) from reference configuration to deformed configuration. Then [R] =

The superscript T denotes matrix transpose, subscripts ref and def correspond to reference and deformed configurations respectively, and [κ̃0 (s)] is
skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to the stress-free (reference) curvature
~κ0 (s). Note that the stress-free curvature ~κ0 (s) depends on the choice of the
cross-section-fixed reference frame âi (s) and satisfies equations (12) and (15)
in reference configuration (with [L] = [Lref ]).
Finally, we recognize that if we estimate the rotation [R(s)] from the reference configuration to the deformed configuration, equation (16) provides
the curvature vector ~κ(s) by calculating the skew-symmetric matrix [κ̃(s)],
which has the three components of the curvature vector ~κ(s) along âi (s) as
per the equations (11) and (14). There are several conceivable ways of estimating the rotation [R(s)] from the reference and the deformed configuration
position-data. One approach is to select a point cloud (e.g. cluster of atoms)
from the discrete structure around each cross-section and estimate the best

fit of [R(s)] for the point cloud from the reference configuration to the deformed configuration. There are several commercially available tools (e.g.
NX Imageware (UGS, Plano, TX)) to estimate the rigid body rotations of
point clouds.
An alternative approach to derive the curvature vector ~κ(s) from position
data is to use the Serret-Frenet formula (15) directly. This approach involves
book-keeping of the cross-section-fixed reference frame âi (s) in deformed configuration from position data. We note that either approach involves numerical differentiations, which may potentially be ill-posed and amplify noise
of the measured data [16]. The effects of noise in the two-step estimation
method with appropriate unscented filters is analyzed in [1].
5. Illustrative Results
In this section, we illustrate the applicability of the two-step estimation
method on a filament with an artificial discrete-structure with planar bending. We first describe the artificial discrete-structure in Sub-section 5.1.
Next, in Sub-section 5.2, we exploit some simplicities in the expected form of
the constitutive law that are physically obvious from the discrete structure.
In Sub-section 5.3, we describe the state-space form of the reduced-order
static rod model in the plane of bending. Finally, we present and discuss the
estimation and validation results in Sub-sections 5.4 and 5.5 respectively.
5.1. An artificial discrete-structure
We construct and simulate the discrete structure in a commercial, multibody-dynamics software, Hyperworks MotionView. We follow the default
system of units in Hyperworks, which is [Newton, Millimeter, Kilogram, Second]. In the discrete structure, we have thirty repeats of a cubic arrangement
of unit point masses connected by linear springs of unit stiffness. Figure 3
shows two orthogonal views of a representative portion (five repeats) of the
discrete structure in undeformed (reference) state. The springs are along
each edge of the cube as well as along diagonals of two opposite faces as
shown. Each edge of the cube is of unit length, so, the length of the entire
filament L = 30 mm.
5.2. Simplified constitutive law with in-plane bending
Before estimating the effective constitutive law, we first exploit the simplicities in its form that are physically obvious from the discrete structure.
13

z

Figure 3: Discrete structure of the filament. Two orthogonal views are shown, one along
z-axis (top) and the other into the z-axis (bottom). Unit point masses are arranged in
a cubic arrangement and five repeats of the cubic arrangement are shown. Each edge of
the cubic cell has unit length and has linear springs of unit stiffness connecting the point
masses in the undeformed (reference) configuration. In addition, the diagonal springs are
placed on two opposite faces of the cube shown in the view along z-axis (top), but not on
the other four faces of the cube.

Since the discrete structure is uniform, we expect the effective constitutive
law also to be uniform (homogeneous) along the length. In other words, there
is no explicit dependence on s in equation (1). In addition, the constitutivelaw equation (1) also has no explicit dependence on the internal force f~(s)
for the chosen discrete structure 2 . So, the equation (1) that needs to be
estimated, simplifies to the following form:
~ (~κ, ~q) = 0.
ψ

(17)

Finally, we also note that due to the symmetries of the discrete-structure,
the constitutive law is decoupled in the principal directions of bending and
torsion. Choosing the cross-section-fixed reference frame âi (s) along the principal directions, the vector equation (17) simplifies to three scalar equations
ψi (κi , qi ) = 0,

(18)

where the subscript i = 1, 2, or 3 corresponds to each of the principal axes
along âi (s). Specifically, we let â1 (s), â2 (s), and â3 (s) correspond to the
first bending, second bending, and torsion axes, respectively, as illustrated
along with a result in Figure 4. The unit vector â3 (s) points along the

in this section will become plausible anyway with validation of the estimated constitutive
law in Section 5.5

outward normal to the cross-section. The unit vector â1 (s) is parallel to the
faces of the cube containing diagonal springs, while â2 (s) is parallel to the
faces not containing diagonal springs 3 . To present the viability of the twostep estimation method, we illustrate it for planar bending about only one
principal bending axis, which we choose to be along â2 (s)-axis.
5.3. In-plane static rod model in state-space form
In-plane bending about the â2 -axis occurs when a shear force is applied
in the â1 -direction and/ or bending moment is applied about the â2 -axis.
Referring all the physical vectors to the cross-section-fixed reference frame
âi (s), we note that the first and third components of ~κ(s) and q~(s) and the
second component of f~(s) vanish for the planar bending. Furthermore, we
will have no distributed load. In this case the governing vector equations (7)
and (8) of the static rod model further reduce to the following three scalar

Note that with this choice of reference frame, the stress-free curvature vector ~κ0 (s) = 0
since the discrete structure is straight in undeformed (reference) state. This fact can be
verified by satisfying Serret-Frenet formula (15) in the reference state.

free end has a prescribed shear force, but has no tension and no bending moment. Since
there are thirty cubic cells of 1 mm edge each, L = 30 mm. The cross-section-fixid reference
frame âi (s) is also shown. The unit vector â3 (s) points along the outward normal to the
cross-section. The unit vector â1 (s) is chosen in the plane of bending, while â2 (s) is parallel

−0.004 N at the free end (at s = 0) as shown in Figure 4. We simulate the
static equilibrium configuration of the discrete structure using the Force Imbalance Method-Type D for the static analysis in Hyperworks MotionSolve.
From the deformed configuration, we estimate the curvature κ2 (s) as outlined in Section 4.4. Next, to estimate the internal moment q2 (s), we use the
estimated curvature κ2 (s) as a known input u(s) in the state-space equations
(19) - (21) of the in-plane static rod model. We solve the state-space equations (19) - (21) for x(s), which contains q2 (s), in MATLAB Simulink with
the initial conditions:

Finally, to estimate the functional relationship (22) between κ2 and q2
we express the function, ψ2 , as a sinusoidal-basis-function expansion, where
the unknown coefficients of this expansion are then found by standard leastsquares-fitting. Figure 5 shows the estimated constitutive relationship between the bending moment and curvature.
5.5. Validation of the constitutive law
To validate the estimated constitutive-law, one may test it in several
different loading environments (static or dynamic) and evaluate if it predicts

the same deformation behavior from the rod model as does the discretestructure simulation. Here we present one spot test in static equilibrium. The
loading conditions for the spot test are shown in Figure 6 on the deformed
equilibrium of the discrete structure (on the left). In this case we apply shear
force, compressive force as well as bending moment at the free end. We apply
these loading conditions in the Simulink state-space-model of the continuum
rod employing the estimated constitutive-law shown in Figure 5. We set it up
as DAE in Simulink with constitutive law as the known, algebraic constraint.
Figure 6 shows (on the right) the comparison of the centerline predicted from
the discrete-structure simulation in Hyperworks (dots) and the continuumrod simulation (solid curve) employing the estimated constitutive-law. The
closely matching shape validates the estimated constitutive-law.

5.6. Analysis and discussion of results
The close agreement obtained in Section 5.5 of the centerline deformations
of the discrete-lattice structure and the continuum rod-model in the spot-test
loading not only illustrates the viability of the two-step estimation-method,
but also corroborates several assumptions that we made along the way. In
particular, we assumed inextensibility and unshearability in the rod model
equations (19) - (21), while the discrete-structure simulations are inherently
free from such assumptions. The slenderness ratio (length/thickness) of the
discrete structure is 30. Therefore the results corroborate the assumptions
of inextensibility and unshearability in Kirchhoff rod theory for slender filaments. Furthermore, the close agreement corroborates the simplifications
that we imposed a priori on the constitutive law in Section 5.2. The agreement is also noteworthy when considering that each simulation is run independently with different softwares and solvers, and therefore serve as a
validation study for the softwares and solvers as well. The accuracy of the
results obtained using commercial softwares and standard numerical methods is promising for the ease of implementing the method to a variety of
applications involving filament-type deformable structures.
We recall here that the first-principle derivation of the constitutive law
from atomistic-level interactions is often impractical in general. However, for
the discrete structure that we chose, we indeed can corroborate the estimated
constitutive law from an approximate first-principle derivation. Consider the
spring forces in the deformed discrete structure in Figure 7 showing one
cubic cell. If R is the radius of curvature of the neutral surface and θ is the
bend angle, Rθ = 1 mm and κ2 = 1/R = θ/mm. The restoring moment
q2 is related to the restoring forces developed in the springs on the top and
bottom faces of the cube. The top two springs in the plane of bending are
stretched, while the bottom two springs are compressed. The restoring force
f developed in each of the four springs is θ/2 N and therefore, the resultant
moment q2 = θ N-mm. Eliminating θ between q2 and κ2 , we get q2 = (1
N-mm2 ) κ2 , which corroborates the nearly linear relationship between q2 and
κ2 observed in Figure 5.
6. Conclusions
The continuum-rod model has emerged as an efficient tool to describe the
long length and time scale dynamics of nonlinear deformations of microfilaments and sem-flexible biofilaments such as DNA. However, the usefulness

of the rod model is severely limited by the lack of knowledge of an accurate
constitutive law. Discrete-structure simulations, such as MD simulations of
biomolecules such as DNA for small length and time scales can provide ample
data for the accurate estimation of an effective constitutive law.
In this paper, we described a method based on a recently proposed twostep inverse approach [1] to estimate the constitutive law using discretestructure simulations. We illustrated the applicability of the method on a
simple representative example. In particular, we considered a cantilever filament with an artificial discrete-structure. We simulated its deformation in
response to a prescribed loading using a multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver.
We then estimated an effective constitutive law from the deformation data
using the two-step method. Finally, we illustrated how the estimated constitutive law can be validated by employing it in the continuum-rod model and
comparing the simulation results with those of discrete-structure simulations
under an independent set of cantilever loading conditions. The method presented in this paper can leverage MD simulations of the discrete atomistic
structure of microfilaments to estimate their constitutive laws.

Appendix A.2. In-plane bending
For in-plane bending presented in Section 5, the shape integration from
the curvature κ2 is simpler than the above algorithm for the general 3-D case.
If the plane of bending is designated as x − y plane and if φ(s) is the angle
that centerline tangent makes with the x-axis, then

Thus, we can integrate equation (A.7) using trapezoidal rule to get φ(s)
and then integrate equation (A.8) to get Rx (s) and Ry (s) respecting the
boundary conditions at the clamped end (at s = L) of the cantilever. In
particular, we can integrate along the increasing s-direction starting from the
free end (s = 0) with φ(0), Rx (0) and Ry (0) (the constants of integration) as
unknowns and find their values satisfying the clamped values of φ(L), Rx (L)
and Ry (L).
