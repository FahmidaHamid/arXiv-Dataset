We investigate the role of long-lasting quantum coherence in the efficiency of energy transport
at room temperature in Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complexes. The excitation energy
transfer due to the coupling of the light harvesting complex to the reaction center (“sink”) is analyzed
using an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that, as the coupling to the reaction center
is varied, maximal efficiency in energy transport is achieved in the vicinity of the superradiance
transition, characterized by a segregation of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the sink (which provides
a quasi–continuum in the energy spectrum) is the dominant effect in the energy transfer which
takes place even in absence of a thermal bath. This approach allows one to study the effects of finite
temperature and the effects of any coupling scheme to the reaction center. Moreover, taking into
account a realistic electric dipole interaction, we show that the optimal distance from the reaction
center to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson system occurs at the superradiance transition, and we show
that this is consistent with available experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

The annual amount of energy humans currently use
is delivered to Earth by the Sun in a few hours! Since
solar energy is very dilute, it is essential to transport the
captured energy efficiently. Most natural photosynthetic
systems consist of antenna complexes, which capture
photons from the Sun and transport energy to a reaction
center (RC). There, it is transformed into chemical
energy via charge separation. Antenna complexes are
able to transfer excitations to RCs with an efficiency
exceeding 95%. For a long time, it was thought that
energy transfer in photosynthetic light-harvesting
complexes occurs through classical processes, similar
to random walks of the exciton to the RC. However,
surprising evidence of coherent quantum energy transfer
has been found recently [1, 2]. These findings raise two
basic questions. How can coherence be maintained in
complex biological systems at room temperature? Why
is quantum coherence relevant to the efficiency of energy
transfer?
The first question has been addressed in [3, 4]. We
consider here the second one. It is known that quantum
coherence can speed up energy transport through a
quantum walk, which can be faster than a classical walk
[5]. Although the relevance of a mechanism similar
to Dicke superradiance [8] has been also pointed out
in [6, 7], we focus here on a different feature of the
“superradiance transition” (ST) [9, 10]. We show that
ST is a dominant mechanism in an antenna complex

described by discrete energy levels coupled to the RC,
modeled here by a sink having a continuum energy
spectrum similar to what has been done in [3, 5, 11].
On the other hand, the effects of the thermal bath lead
only to small corrections to the energy transport in the
vicinity of maximal efficiency. The antenna-sink coupling
causes the appearance of a resonance width (inverse of
life-time) and an energy (Lamb) shift. For weak coupling
strength, the resonance widths are roughly the same.
However, if the coupling strength reaches a critical
value, at which the resonance widths start to overlap,
then a segregation of widths builds up. In this regime,
almost the entire (summed up) decay width is allocated
to just a few short-lived “superradiant states”, while
all other states are long-lived (and effectively decoupled
from the environment). We call this segregation the
“Superradiance Transition”. This effect has been studied
using random matrix theory [12, 13], in nuclear physics
[14], for microwave billiards [15] and in paradigmatic
models of coherent quantum transport [16, 17]. It was
shown in [16] that in a realistic model for quantum
transport, maximum transmission is achieved at ST.
In this paper, we focus on transport properties of the
Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, found in green
sulphur bacteria. This complex, one of the most studied
in the literature [3–5, 18], acts as a conductor for energy
transport between the antenna system and the RC. The
FMO complex is a dissipative open quantum system
which interacts with the thermal bath provided by
the protein environment. Here we take an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach [9, 10, 19] and

2
study the ST as a function of the coupling to the RC and
the thermal bath, due to phonons. The phonon bath
induces dephasing and dissipation, and we take both
effects into account using two different models for the
phonon bath. Since ST is due to quantum coherence, we
address here two main issues: i) whether its effects can
survive in presence of dephasing induced by the phonon
bath at room temperature, and ii) how ST depends on
the strength of the coupling between the FMO and the
RC. It has been shown recently that maximal transport
efficiency for the FMO complex is achieved near a
critical coupling to the RC [20]. However, so far, the
dependence of this critical coupling on the parameters
of the FMO and the RC has not been determined. We
compute this critical coupling analytically and show
that it corresponds to the ST. We demonstrate that the
quantum coherent effect of ST, even taking into account
dephasing and relaxation, determines the maximal
transport efficiency at room temperature.
Indeed,
the ST is due to coherent constructive interference
between the various paths to the RC, thus enhancing
the rate of energy transfer. Finally, with the aid of
the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach, we consider
a realistic coupling between the FMO complex and
the RC, showing that the ST determines the optimal
distance from the RC to the FMO system.

II.

THE MODEL FOR SUPERRADIANCE
TRANSITION

The FMO complex is a trimer, composed of identical
subunits, each of which contains seven bacteriochlorophylls (BChl) [21]. Each subunit acts independently and
can be modelled using a tight-binding Hamiltonian,
H0 =

(Ji,j |iihj| + h.c.).

(recombination) with an associated decay time, T1 , and
coupling to the RC with a decay time, T1r .
As is common in quantum optics [22], we describe this
dissipative system with at most one excitation by states

|ψi =
dE bc (E)|c, Ei ⊗ |gsi, (2)
ai |0i ⊗ |ii +

where |0i is the vacuum state of the environment and
|c, Ei ⊗ |gsi is the state with one excitation in the environment and none on the sites. Here, c, is the quantum
number labelling channels (at energies E) in the environments. The reduced density matrix is obtained by
tracing over the states |0i and |c, Ei,
X
X
ρ =
ai a∗j |iihj| + (1 −

(3)
i,j

which is an 8 × 8 matrix. However, hgs|ρ|ii = 0 since
with the choice (2), we neglect the transitions |ii → |gsi.
Moreover, hgs|ρ|gsi is simply the loss of probability of
excitation of the seven sites. Therefore, we restrict our
considerations to the 7 × 7 matrix hi|ρ|ji, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 7,
which however does not have constant trace.
In order to compute the evolution of the reduced density
matrix, we introduce an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian [9, 16, 23] which in general can be written as,
Heff (E) = H0 + ∆(E) − iW (E), where H0 is the Hermitian Hamiltonian of the system decoupled from the
environments and ∆(E) and W (E) are the induced energy shift and the dissipation, respectively. Neglecting
the energy dependence and the energy shift we have
X
Heff = H0 − iW
with Wij =
Aci (Acj )∗ .
(4)
c

The real symmetric matrix, W , is given in terms of the
bound state-continuum transition amplitudes, Aci , from
the discrete state i to the continuum channel c.
The Schrödinger equation and Eq. (2), result in the following equation for the coefficients, aj :

i,j

Here, |ii is the state in which the i-th site is excited
and the others are in the ground state. Since the solar
energy is very dilute, we limit the description to a single
excitation in the complex, as is commonly done in the
literature. The numerical values of Ei and Ji,j have been
taken from Ref. [3]. Below we take the matrix elements
of H0 expressed in cm−1 :

One can verify that equation (6) can also be obtained

In the following, we fix T1 = 1 ns, which is the exciton

Its value varies from 1 for fully localized to 7 for fully
delocalized states. The right panel of Fig. 1 shows the
PR for the state associated with the largest width (the
one decaying most quickly). In the superradiant regime,
cr
T1r < T1r
, this state is fully localized on site 3, the only
site connected to the RC. For weak coupling to the RC,
cr
T1r > T1r
, the PR is approximately 1.6. This small
value, as compared to the maximal possible value of 7,
is explained by (Anderson) localization [27] of the eigenstates on sites. The Anderson localization effect in the
FMO system is due to the fact that the excitation energies of the sites and the couplings among them are all
different. Thus, the FMO complex can be thought of as
cr
a disordered system. The critical value, T1r
, at which ST
occurs, can be estimated analytically. If all states have
roughly the same width, at least for small coupling, then
the superradiance condition coincides with that of overlapping resonances. Such a reasoning can be applied to
the FMO system, too. Here, eigenstates are mostly localized on the sites, and only site 3 is coupled to the RC. The
widths are thus not uniform and most of the total width
belongs to the eigenstate localized at site 3. Imposing
that the half width, Γ3 /2, is approximately equal to the
mean level spacing D, Γ3 /2 ≈ D, and using Γ3 ≈ h̄/T1r ,
we obtain the critical value at which ST occurs,

SUPERRADIANCE TRANSITION

ST can be analyzed by studying the complex eigenvalues, Er = Er − iΓr /2 of Heff , defined in (4). As the
coupling between the excitonic states and the RC increases, one observes a rearrangement of the widths, Γr
(the “superradiance” transition [16]). We show this effect
in Fig. 1 (left panel), where the largest width (red dashed
curve) and the average of the 7 − 1 = 6 smallest widths
(black full curve) are plotted as functions of T1r . For
weak coupling to RC (large T1r ) the widths of all states
increase as T1r decreases. On the other hand, below a
cr
critical value T1r
, corresponding to ST, (vertical line),
the average of the 6 smallest widths decreases while the
largest width, corresponding to the superradiant state,
increases. To examine localization of the excitation we
use the Participation Ratio (PR)[26] of a state |ψi, defined as:

PR = (
|hi|ψi|4 )−1 .

panel: PR of the eigenstate of Heff with the largest width

indicates the critical value of T1r at which ST occurs.

In the FMO system, the energy level spacing is
cr
D/hc ≈ 83.5 cm−1 , which gives T1r
≈ 0.03 ps, a value
in very good agreement with the numerical results of
Fig. 1 (vertical line).
Such a value, T1r = 0.03 ps, corresponds to a transfer
rate, κ, from site 3 to the RC of κ = 2T11r = 16.6 ps−1 .
This value is larger than the values usually mentioned in
literature, which range from 0.25 ps−1 to 4 ps−1 [25], even
if 1 ps−1 is the most common value [5]. This discrepancy
can be due to the simplicity of our model, even if it is
important to notice that, to the best of our knowledge,
the real value of the coupling time, T1r , is not exactly
known. In any case, for this reason, in Section VIb, we
consider a more realistic coupling scheme between the
FMO system and the RC.

IV.

EFFICIENCY OF ENERGY TRANSPORT
IN PRESENCE OF A THERMAL BATH

Interaction with the phonon environment is complicated, and it involves both dephasing and dissipation [3].
Since superradiance is due to quantum coherence, in Sec
(IV A) we first focus on dephasing and the consistent
indirect relaxation, induced by the presence of classical
noise. On the other hand, in Sec. (IV B), we consider
both dephasing and dissipation induced by a finite temperature bath. Needless to say, while the latter bath
induces at equilibrium a Gibbs energy level distribution,
the former gives rise to an equal population of all energy
levels.

4

As a first step, one can study the effects of the phonon
bath modelling the thermal bath by a classical noise. In
this case, the dephasing effects are adequately described
using an interaction as in Ref. [24]:
X
HSB =
qi (t)|iihi|,
(8)
with
hqi (t)qj (t)i = h̄2 γd δi,j δ(t),

(9)

where γd plays the role of the dephasing rate. This approach corresponds to an effective infinite temperature
that leads to equal populations of energy levels at sufficiently large times. We take into account the interaction
(8) by adding a dephasing Lindblad operator to the master equation (6), as was done in Ref. [19]. The interaction
with noise leads to the Haken-Strobl master equation for
the density matrix of the following form:

The first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (10) takes into account
the coherent evolution and the dissipation by recombination and trapping into the reaction center, (it is simply
Eq. (6) rewritten in terms of Heff , defined in Eq. (4)).
The last term, which corresponds to the decay of the offdiagonal matrix elements, takes into account dephasing
and indirect relaxation. For the FMO system, the amplitude of noise, h̄γd , is related to the temperature, T , by
the relation, found in experiments [2],

In our simulations, we take the initial state

ρ(0) = (|1ih1| + |6ih6|),
2
since sites 1 and 6 receive the excitation from the antenna
system [24].
It was numerically found in [20] that the efficiency
reaches a maximum as a function of T1r . Here, we
explain this as a consequence of ST, a general phenomenon in coherent quantum transport. In Fig. 2, we
plot η(tmax = 5 ps) (upper panel), and τ (lower panel),
as functions of T1r . The maximum efficiency of energy
transport (maximum η and minimum τ ) is reached near

the ST (vertical line). Note that η(tmax = 5 ps) has a
maximum not only in the quantum limit (γd (T = 0.1 K),
black dashed curve), but also considering the dephasing rate at room temperature (γd (T = 300 K), red thick
curve). These results show that the effects of the ST
persist even in presence of dephasing and indirect relaxation. Within the framework of the ST, the decrease in
efficiency for large coupling to the RC, can be interpreted
as a localization effect, see Fig. 1 (right panel). Our results also show that dephasing can increase efficiency,
since it counteracts quantum localization. This effect
is known as Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport
(ENAQT) [24, 25]. The average transfer time, see Fig. 2
(lower panel), has a minimum near the ST of the order
of a few picoseconds. This time is comparable with the
transfer times estimated in the literature.

The coupling to the RC also induces a shift of the
energy of site 3 (not only a decay width) [16]. This shift
is assumed to be generically of the form δ = /T1r , where
 depends on the details of the coupling. We checked
that the effect of changing  randomly, so as to produce
up to a 50% change in the average level spacing, merely
changes the efficiency at most by a few percent.

Efficiency of energy transport in the presence of
a finite temperature thermal bath

In this subection, we consider the effects of energy
transport to the RC taking into consideration the interaction with a phonon bath at finite temperature, T , as
described in Ref. [5]. Here we consider that only site 3
is coupled to the RC, as described above. The Lindbladtype master equation has the form

i
dρi,j
+
= − Heff ρ − ρHeff
+ Lp (ρ)ij ,
(14)
i,j
dt
h̄
where the action of the Lindblad operator on ρ, Lp (ρ),
is described in Eq. (5) of Ref. [5]. With this choice, at
sufficiently large time, the transition to the Gibbs distribution occurs, in absence of any other dissipative mechanism, such as the presence of “sinks”.
In Fig. 3 (upper panel), we present our results on the
dependence of efficiency, η, as a function of T1r , for three
bath temperatures. As one can see, at the ST, indicated
as a vertical green line, the efficiency is about 0.92, and
it weakly depends on temperature. We also mention that
the maximal efficiency occurs near the ST.
The value of T1r at which one gets the maximal efficiency should not be confused with the average transfer
time, see Eq. (13). In particular, in Fig. 3 lower panel,
for parameters corresponding to the ST and room temperature, T1r ≈ 30 f s and τ ≈ 2.1 ps.
Comparing Fig. 2 and 3, (upper panels), one can see
that the presence of the phonon bath significantly increases the efficiency of energy transport to the RC, almost without changing the position of its maximum. We
also would like to mention that in the presence of the
thermal bath, the temperature effects on the efficiency
are less significant than in presence of a classical noise,
as in Fig. 2. Indeed dissipation helps the system to reach
the site 3 which has the lowest energy.
The analysis of this Section shows that the consequences of the ST are very important even in presence
of dephasing and dissipation. For both models of thermal bath considered in this Section, the ST provides the
maximal efficiency of energy transport. In the following
we will consider only the model of the phonon bath presented in Sec. (IV A), which, as shown in this Section, is
sufficient to capture the main effects due to the phonon
bath.

QUANTUM VS. CLASSICAL

ST implies the presence of a maximum of the energy
transport efficiency as a function of the coupling time
to the RC, T1r . This effect is counter-intuitive from a
classical point of view. Indeed, the probability to escape
(decay to the RC) for a classical particle does not decrease as the escape rate (1/T1r from site 3) is increased.
In order to demonstrate the difference between the effects of quantum coherence on energy transfer discussed
above, and the corresponding classical energy transport,
we consider a classical master equation for the population

case does not exhibit a maximum but simply decays with

coherence only.

where Pi is the probability to be on site i, Ti,k is the
transition matrix and the last two terms take into account the possibility for the classical excitation to escape
the system. The transition rates from site i to site k have
been computed from [29], neglecting the dependence on
the coupling to the RC (for a classical particle, the probability to go from any site to site 3 does not depend on
the coupling to the RC).

DIFFERENT COUPLING SCHEMES

So far, we have considered the site 3 to be the only
one coupled to the RC. However, it is not known for
sure which sites are connected to the RC, even though
sites 3 and 4 are the most likely candidates, since they
are closest to the RC [24]. As mentioned above, the nonHermitian Hamiltonian formalism easily allows one to describe different coupling schemes, which can be included
in the effective Hamiltonian (4) by properly choosing the
RC
coupling transition amplitude, Ai , between the sites of
the FMO complex and the RC. Note that while in the
previous Section we indicated the channel in the RC with
the number 3, here we label it as RC.

Eq. (11). Lower panel: efficiency computed at tmax = 5 ps,
using Eq. (16), as a function of T1r , at room temperature
dephasing rate, γd (T = 300 K), for different coupling to RC.
The vertical green line represents ST. As initial conditions we
choose ρ(0) = (1/2)(|1ih1| + |6ih6|).

The comparison between classical and quantum
behavior is shown in Fig. 4 (upper panel). The classical
dynamics leads to a very different dependence of the
efficiency on T1r . Namely, the efficiency in the classical

=

In a general setting the probability for the excitation to
be in the RC at time tmax = 5 ps cannot be computed
using Eq. (12), since by merely summing that expression
for each site connected to the RC, we neglect interference
effects. The efficiency should be computed using
Z tmax

dt T r(ρ(t)). (16)
η 0 (tmax ) = 1−T r(ρ(tmax ))−
T1 0
Here, 1 − T r(ρ(tmax )) is the probability that the excitation leaves the system by the time tmax . The last term
in Eq. (16) is the probability that the excitation has
been lost by recombination during this time. If there is
just one site coupled to the RC, then Eq. (16) reduces
to Eq. (12).
In Fig. 4 (lower panel) we show that the efficiency is
sensitive to different coupling schemes. In particular, we
notice that coupling through site 4 achieves a greater
efficiency than coupling through site 3. If both sites

7
are coupled to the RC, then the efficiency is further
improved, and the decay for small coupling times is
smaller than that for a single coupled site.

ρF M O ' 1/D, D being the mean level spacing of the FMO
complex discussed in Sec. (III). We show in Fig. (5) how

In the following, we consider a more realistic coupling
scheme to RC, namely the case in which all sites of the
FMO system have an electric dipole coupling to the same
channel in the RC. This assumption can be justified since
in the RC there are the same bacteriochlorophyll (BChl)
molecules which compose the FMO system. So, it is reasonable to assume that the excitation is transferred to
the RC by the same mechanism that operates between
the BChl molecules in the FMO system.
The electric dipole transition amplitude from site i to
the RC can be written as:
i
RC
C h
µ
~i · µ
~ RC − 3(~
µi · R̂i,RC )(~
µRC · R̂i,RC ) ,
Vi = 3
Ri,RC
(17)
where Ri,RC is the distance from site i to the RC, µi is
the dipole moment at the site i, and µRC is the dipole
moment assigned to the RC. We take the position of
the BChls and their dipole moments from [20]. Here,
we assume that the coupling strength between the sites
and the RC is equal to that between the sites, so that:
C|µ|2 = 134000 cm−1 (Å)3 , as in Ref. [20].
In order to determine the coupling amplitude from site
i to the continuum of states in the RC we evaluate the
transfer rate, κi from the Fermi-golden rule [5]:
RC

2πρRC |Vi |2
κi =

(18)
h̄
where ρRC represents the density of states in the RC. It is
interesting to observe that an expression for the transfer
rate similar to (18) can be also obtained without perturbation theory, see for instance Ref. [30], where the
continuum was modeled as a semi-infinite lead. We can
now determine the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Eq. (4),
setting:
RC

Note that now the coupling between the FMO complex
and the RC depends on the position of the RC. In order to determine how the efficiency of energy transfer
depends on the position of the RC w.r.t. the FMO complex, we assume µ
~ RC = µ
~ 3 and place the RC in the same
y and z position of site 3, as given in [20]. The transport
efficiency has been studied by varying the distance, d,
from the site 3 along the x direction. In order to comRC
pute the transition amplitude, Ai , we need the density
of states of the RC which, to the best of our knowledge
is not known experimentally. For this reason we consider
different densities of states, respectively larger, equal or
smaller than the density of states of the FMO system,

FIG. 5: (Color online) Efficiency, Eq. (16), computed at
tmax = 5 ps vs the distance d (nm) of the RC from site 3 in the
FMO complex for different ratios χ = ρRC /ρF M O . Here, an
electric dipole coupling between the RC and the FMO system,
see Eq. (17), has been considered. The vertical dashed lines,
obtained from Eq. (19), represent the critical distances at
which superradiance transition occurs. As initial conditions
we choose ρ(0) = (1/2)(|1ih1| + |6ih6|). Data in this figure
refer to a room temperature dephasing rate, γd (T = 300 K),
see Eq. (11).

the efficiency, computed with Eq. (16) using Eq. (10),
varies as a function of the distance from the RC to site
3 of the FMO system. In Fig. (5) we consider a room
temperature dephasing rate γd (T = 300 K), for different
ratios, χ = ρRC /ρF M O = 0.1, 1, 102 , respectively, from
the upper to the lower panel. As one can see, the optimal distance, which is the distance that maximizes the
efficiency, slowly depends on the density of states in the
RC.
We can use the superradiant criterium obtained in
Eq. (7) to get an analytical expression for the optimal
distance of the RC from the FMO complex. Since site 3
is the closest to the RC, we can use Eq. (7) and we find
that the ST occurs for h̄κ3 = D. Finally, from Eq. (18)
we have:

We have analyzed energy transport in the FMO system
with the aid of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach.
This allows us to take into account the effect of the coupling of the FMO system to the reaction center in a consistent way, not merely phenomenologically, as is usually
done in the literature. We have shown that by increasing the strength of the coupling to the reaction center,
a superradiance transition occurs. This transition occurs at approximately the same value of the coupling for
which energy transport efficiency is maximal. Indeed, the
superradiance transition is due to coherent constructive
interference between the paths to the RC, and this effect
enhances the rate of energy transfer. Since the ST effect
is due to quantum coherence, one might expect that any
consequences of ST would disappear in the presence of
dephasing and relaxation provided by the thermal bath.
On the contrary, we have shown that the effect of superradiance survives in the presence of the thermal bath,
and the maximal efficiency only depends weakly on tem-

perature. We have also estimated the ST critical value
analytically. For coupling strengths of the FMO system
to the RC near the critical one, where the superradiance transition takes place, we obtained average energy
transfer times comparable to experimental values (a few
picoseconds). Finally, we took into account a realistic
coupling scheme between the FMO system and the RC,
and derived from the superradiance condition the analytical expression, Eq. (19), for the optimal distance from
the RC to the FMO complex. This analytical expression depends on the density of states in the RC. Within
a wide range of density of states the optimal distance
which we obtained analytically is approximately a few
nanometers and is consistent with available structural
data on RC. Note also that Eq. (19) is valid for a generic
Donor-Acceptor complex.
Our analysis shows that the superradiance mechanism
might play an important role in explaining the efficiency
of quantum transport in photosynthetic light-harvesting
systems and in engineering artificial light harvesting systems.

see Eq. (17). Eq. (19) gives us the distance at which
superradiance transition occurs. The critical distance
obtained from Eq. (19) is shown in Fig. (5) as dashed
vertical lines. As one can see, the estimate is very good.
Note that changing the density of states in the RC from
ρF M O /10 to 102 ρF M O only changes the optimal distance
from 1 nm to 3 nm. These distances are consistent with
available structural data for the RC-FMO complex, see
for instance [31]. The result is remarkable since it shows
that the superradiant criterium suffices to determine the
optimal distance from the RC to the FMO complex for a
wide range of values for the density of states of the RC.
