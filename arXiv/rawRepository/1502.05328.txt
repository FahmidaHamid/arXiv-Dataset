Introduction: “converting chemical information into a geometrical form”

Alan Turing’s celebrated paper “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis” [22] published in 1952 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London is
a typical example of a pioneering and inspired work in the domain of mathematical
modelling.
1. The paper presents a new key idea for solving an old problem. As Lionel
Harrison said in his 1987 paper [6] “it is a theoretical preconception preceeding
experience”.
2. It contains right away the germ of quite the whole theory associated to the
new ideas.
3. Its forsightedness is striking. It anticipates by many years its experimental
confirmations and mathematical developments.
The key idea is formulated from the outset in the first sentence:
“It is suggested that a system of chimical substances, called morphogens,
reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account
for the main phenomena of morphogenesis.”

Later (1953), Turing used a striking formulation (see below figure 2):
“It was suggested in Turing (1952) that this might be the main means
by which the chemical information contained in the genes was converted
into a geometrical form.”
Turing’s colleague Claude Wilson Wardlaw, a botanist at the Department of
Cryptogamic Botany at Manchester University who wrote with Turing the paper
“A diffusion reaction theory of morphogenesis in plants” [24], said in 1952 that
Turing’s working hypothesis was that:
“a localized accumulation of gene-determined substances may be an essential prior condition [for cell differentiation].” (p. 40)
and that what is needed in addition to biochemistry for understanding emerging
spatial forms in morphogenetic processes is a “patternized distribution of morphogenetic substances”. There exist many homologies of organization between different
biological species and it must therefore exist general morphogenetics mechanisms
largely independent of specific genes. As he claimed, “certain physical processes are
of very general occurrence” (p. 46).
Wardlaw summarizes Turing’s key idea in the following way:
“In an embryonic tissue in which the metabolic substances may initially
be distributed in a homogeneous manner, a regular, patternized distribution of specific metabolites may eventually result, thus affording the
basis for the inception of morphological or histological patterns.” (p. 44)
So, for understanding how a spatial order can emerge from biochemical reactions
genetically controlled – which, according to Turing, is the main problem of morphogenesis – Turing defines from the outset a form as a breaking of homogeneity of some
spatially extended biological tissue and, therefore, as a breaking of the symmetries
underlying such an homogeneity.

2.1

The framework
Turing diffusion-driven instability

The components of Turing’s theorization are the following. Inside the biological tissue under consideration, chimical reactions occur, which we will call internal chimical
dynamics. In the spatial extension of this substrate, processes of spatial diffusion
occur, which we will call external spatial dynamics. The key idea is that the coupling
of these two very different kinds of dynamics can trigger, under certain conditions,
morphogenetic processes, which can be mathematically modelled by using what are
called since Turing reaction-diffusion differential equations. Why and how? Because

2

the external spatial diffusion can destabilize, under certain conditions, the internal
chimical equilibria.
We must emphasize the fact that the notion of diffusion-driven instabilities is to
some extent paradoxical. Indeed, diffusion is a stabilizing process and therefore the
idea amounts to posit that the coupling of two stabilities can induce an instability!
We will see that Turing assumes that there exists only one equilibrium of the
internal chimical dynamics. A diffusion-induced instability could therefore make the
chimical state diverge, but in general non-linearities of the equations bound such
divergences. Another possibility would be that there exist several equilibria. Then
Turing instabilities would induce bifurcations from one equilibrium state to another
one. It is this idea that has been worked out in the late 1960s by René Thom [20],
[21] to explain also morphogenesis.

2.2

Turing’s objective

Today, reaction-diffusion equations are mainly used to explain the formation of patterns in material substrates. But Turing’s objective was deeper and more ambitious
and concerned embryogenesis. As he claimed in his Introduction,
“The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which
the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the
resulting organism.” (p. 37)
As this general objective was too ambitious, he assumed many simplifications.
The first simplification was to eliminate any direct reference to specific genes and to
reduce the internal chemical dynamics to reaction equations between concentrations
of morphogens. As explains Philip Maini in [9], a morphogen is
“a chemical to which cells respond by differentiating in a concentrationdependent way.”
Turing was inspired by what Waddington [25] called “form producers” or “evocators”. Morphogens are controlled by genes which catalize their production, but,
contrary to genes, they can diffuse in the developing tissues and carry the positional
information (e.g. in the sense of Wolpert) which is needed for morphogenesis.1
The second simplification made by Turing was to eliminate the mechano-chemical
aspects of embryogenesis, although he was aware of their importance during the
development. These aspects will be worked out later by specialists such as George
Oster and James Murray
But, even so drastically simplified, the search for good mathematical models
remains a
“a problem of formidable mathematical complexity” (p. 38).

Figure 1: Turing’s general equation for morphogenesis.

Figure 2: Turing’s anticipation of the richness of the general equation for morphogenesis.
In fact, it seems that Turing was looking for a kind of universal equation for
morphogenesis. In his last paper “Morphogen theory of phyllotaxis”, which remained
unpublished because of his suicide and is kept at the King’s College Archives, he
proposed the equation
dΓm
= µm ∇2 Γm + fm (Γ1 , · · · , ΓM )
dt
where the Γm are the respective concentrations of the M morphogens, ∇2 the spatial
Laplacian, that is the diffusion operator, the µm the diffusibility coefficients, and
the fm the reaction equations (see figure 1)
The point was that, when you vary the fm and the µm , the solutions of such a
universal equation can be extremely diverse (see figure 2). Hence the idea that, as
with Newton’s equation for Mechanics, it could be possible to classify a lot of very
different kinds of forms using the same general equation.
4

Indeed, we can vary three classes of parameters:
1. For the chemical part, the eigenvalues provided by the spectral analysis of the
linearized system of the fm .
2. The diffusibility coefficients µm .
3. For the geometrical part, the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator (harmonic analysis).

2.3

Turing’s foresightedness

In his 1990 paper “Turing’s theory of morphogenesis. Its influence on modelling
biological pattern and form” [15], James Murray claims that Turing’s 1952 paper is
“one of the most important papers in theoretical biology of this century” (p. 119).
Indeed,
“What is astonishing about Turing’s seminal paper is that, with very
few exceptions, it took the mathematical world more than 20 years to
realise the wealth of fascinating problems posed by his theory. What is
even more astonishing is that it was closer to 30 years before a significant
number of experimental biologists took serious notice of its implications
and potential applications in developmental biology, ecology and epidemiology.” (p. 121)
These inspired anticipations proved to be exact in chemistry. There exist today a
lot of models of chimical reaction-diffusion phenomena: clocks, travelling waves, etc.
Their analysis constitutes a rapidly expanding research domain while, at Turing’s
time, no empirical example was known. Turing discovered theoretically the basic
phenomenon and was the first to compute simulations on the computer he had
himself constructed at Manchester. In embryogenesis, the exact limits of validity of
Turing model are still under discussion.

3.1

The context
The bibliography

It is interesting to look at Turing’s bibliography, which is very short. First, it includes two books which are not really used, the Theory of Elasticity and Magnetism
of James Jeans (1927) and The permeability of natural membranes of Hugh Dawson
and James Danielli (1943). Then, it cites a fundamental paper of Leonor Michaelis
and Maud Menten (1913) on Die Kinetik der Invertinwirkung [13] whose pioneering
mathematical model is typical of the internal chimical dynamics used by Turing.
Finally, there are three masterpieces on embryology and morphogenesis: Charles
Manning Child’s “summa” Patterns and problems of development (1941), Sir D’Arcy
5

Thompson’s masterpiece On Growth and Form (1942) [1] and Conrad Hal Waddington’s key work on Organizers and Genes (1940) [25]. Introduced by Hans Spemann,
“organizers” were thought to be the cause of the embryological induction observed
when the tissues of some part of an embryo (e.g. a leg) were transplanted in another
part (e.g. the head). The idea (much speculative at that time) was that there must
exist chemical signals triggering cellular differenciations. It is in the second part of
this work that Waddington assumed that, through morphogens, gene concentrations
could be important for cellular differenciation and that the developmental units of
an organism are “morphogenetic fields”.

3.2

The kinetic model

Building on previous very precise numerical experimental data collected by Victor
Henri (1903), the Michaelis-Menten model of the kinetics of invertase enzyme (1913)
was the first to explain the catalysis of the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and
fructose. Let E be an enzyme bounding with a substrate S to give a complex ES
which converts itself into a product P through a chain of two elementary chemical
reactions:
k1

k

E + S  ES →3 E + P
k2

where the ki are the rate constants of the reactions. Let us denote by [X] the
concentration of X. Then the law of mass action saying that a reaction rate is
proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants implies the system
of nonlinear differential equations:2
 ·

[S] = −k1 [E] [S] + k2 [ES]

where the relation [E] + [ES] = 0 implies the conservation law [E] + [ES] = E0 =
constant. Under an hypothesis of adiabaticity according to which the equilibrium
·

between S and ES is “instantaneous”, that is [S] = 0, then k1 [E] [S] = k2 [ES],
[ES] = kk21 [E] [S] = kk21 [S] (E0 − [ES]), [ES] 1 + kk12 [S] = kk12 [S] E0 and

Turing’s numerical example

So, Turing start with morphogens diffusing and reacting inside a tissue. Diffusion
flows from regions of strong concentrations towards regions of weak concentrations
with a velocity proportional to the gradients of the concentrations and to the diffusibility coefficients. According to the law of mass action, reaction rates are proportional to the product of concentrations. Hence a huge variety of nonlinear differential
equations.
Turing gives several examples and develop one of them in minute detail in his
§10 “A numerical example”. He considers a ring of N = 20 cells and two morphogens X and Y and makes several numerical assumptions on their size, the diffusibility constants, the permeability of membranes (it is here that the reference to
Dawson-Danielli is used), etc. With great acuity, he argues that the system must
be (thermodynamically) open and include a “fuel substance” A providing it with
energy through its degradation into another substance B.
“In order to maintain the wave pattern a continual supply of free energy
is required. It is clear that this must be so since there is a continual
degradation of energy through diffusion. This energy is supplied through
the ‘fuel substances’ (A, B in the last example), which are degraded into
‘waste products’.” (p. 65)
For modelling catalysis, Turing add three other substances C, C 0 , and W .
It must be emphasized that it will be only thirty years later that open thermodynamical systems out of equilibrium will be systematically investigated (see e.g.
Prigogine’s dissipative structures).

4.1

The internal chimical dynamics

The system of 7 elementary reactions proposed by Turing is the following:
25
XY
rate: 16
(instantly)
[2] W + A → 2Y + B
A = 1000 = constant (fuel substance)
7
[3] 2X → W
rate: 64
X2
1
1
[4] A → X
rate: 16 10−3 A = 16
1
[5] Y → B
rate: 16
Y
(instantly)
[6] Y + C → C 0
C = C 0 = 10−3 (1 + γ)
[7] C 0 → X + C
rate: 55
103 C 0 = 55
(1 + γ)
32
32

[1] Y + X → W

1
So, X converts into Y at the rate 32
[50XY + 7X 2 − 55 (1 + γ)] (because of [1],
1
[3], and [7]) while self-reproducing (because of [4]) at the constant rate 16
and

7

1
destroying Y (because of [5]) at the rate 16
Y . So the kinetic equations for the
time varying concentrations X (t), Y (t) of the morphogens X, Y – i.e. the internal
chimical dynamics – are
( ·
1
[−50XY − 7X 2 + 57 + 55γ] = f (X, Y )
X = 32
·

Y =

1
32

[50XY + 7X 2 − 55 − 55γ − 2Y ] = g (X, Y )

where 57 in the first equation is 55 + 2 with 2 coming from [4] and −2Y in the
second equation comes from [5].

4.2

Equilibria and linearization

A chemical internal equilibrium corresponds to values (Xe , Ye ) such that f (Xe , Ye ) =
0 and g (Xe , Ye ) = 0. For γ = 0 the system is
( ·
1
X = 32
[−50XY − 7X 2 + 57] = f (X, Y )
·

Y =

1
32

[50XY + 7X 2 − 55 − 2Y ] = g (X, Y )

and an evident equilibrium is X0 = Y0 = 1. Another is X1 = − 57
, Y1 = 1 but it is
7
non physical since a concentration cannot be negative.
Then, Turing linearizes the system near the equilibrium (X0 , Y0 ) and analyzes
the stability of the linear system. The method was already well known at his time:
the matrix of the linearized system is the Jacobian J0 of {f, g} at (X0 , Y0 ) and the
stability depends upon the fact that the real part of all eigenvalues λ of J0 are < 0.
Let us briefly remind non mathematicians of it. It is immediate to compute J0 for
γ = 0:

where the sum of diagonal terms Tr (J0 ) = a + d = S, called the trace of the
matrix J0 , gives the sum S of the solutions and the determinant Det (J0 ) of J0
gives their product P . As the discriminant of the equation is ∆ = S 2 − 4P =

and any solution of the linear system is a linear combination of the two solutions

Let us suppose now that λ = α + iω has real part Re (λ) = α and imaginary
part Im (λ) = ω. Then, eλt = e(α+iω)t = eαt eiωt is an oscillation modulated by
the real exponential eαt . If α > 0, eαt diverges exponentially when t → +∞ and
the corresponding trajectories go to infinity and are unstable. On the contrary, if
9

α < 0, eαt converges exponentially towards 0 when t → +∞ and the corresponding
trajectories go to equilibrium and are stable. In Turing’s example,

and the two eigenvalues have negative real parts. The internal chemical equilibrium
(X0 , Y0 ) (i.e. (x0 , y0 ) = 0) is therefore stable.
More generally, in the 2-dimensional case, the system is stable if and only if

Tr (J0 ) = a + d < 0, here − 12 < 0
Det (J0 ) = ad − bc > 0, here 81 > 0
Tr (J0 ) = a + d = −2 +

Indeed, we must have Re (λ± ) < 0. If ∆ = Tr (J0 )2 − 4 Det (J0 ) < 0, then λ+ and
λ− are complex conjugate eigenvalues and we must have Tr (J0 ) < 0, and of course
Det (J0 ) > 0 because otherwise we would have ∆ > 0. If ∆ ≥ 0, then λ+ and λ− are
real eigenvalues and they
eigenvalue,
√
√ must be both < 0. This imply that the greatest
namely λ+ = Tr (J0 )+ ∆ must be < 0, which implies Tr (J0 ) < − ∆. So Tr (J0 ) <
0, and, as Tr (J0 )2 > ∆ = Tr (J0 )2 − 4 Det (J0 ), we have also Det (J0 ) > 0.

Diffusion-driven instability

After having defined the internal chemical equilibrium and analyzed its stability,
Turing explains how a spatial diffusion of the morphogens X, Y can induce an
instability. Let us summarize his computations.

5.1

The reaction-diffusion model

Let r = 1, · · · , N label the positions of the N cells in the ring. Concentrations
X, Y are then functions X(r, t) and Y (r, t) of time t and spatial position r. In a
continuous model, the spatial positions would be parametrized by an angle θ ∈ S1
and concentrations would be functions X(θ, t) and Y (θ, t) (angles θr = 2π Nr retrieve
the discrete case). We start with an homogeneous initial state where X(r, t) = X0
and Y (r, t) = Y0 everywhere and we apply diffusion using the Laplace operator
∆ = ∇2 and its discrete approximation ∆F (r) = F (r − 1) − 2F (r) + F (r + 1) for
any function F (r).
We get that way the reaction-diffusion equations

10

where µ and ν are the respective coefficients of diffusibility of X and Y . Some
technical aspects of the general analysis of such equations are well emphasized by
Turing in §11 “Restatement and biological interpretation of the results” (p. 66),
with an incredible sense of anticipation: it is essential to take into account
1. the role of fluctuations, which play a critical role when the system becomes
unstable;
2. the role of slow changes of reaction rates and diffusibility coefficients because
“such changes are supposed ultimately to bring the system out of the stable
state”.
Turing considered therefore that the systems he analyzed belong to the class of
what are called today slow-fast dynamical systems and focused on the breaking of
spatial homogeneity near instability. As he said
“the phenomena when the system is just unstable were the particular
subject of the inquiry.”
He underlined the fact that the “linearity assumption” near the equilibrium, i.e.
the fact that the dynamics is qualitatively equivalent to its linear part, is “a serious
one” and made what is called today an hypothesis of adiabaticity: as the system is
a slow-fast one, the slow variation of parameters is slow w.r.t. the fast time used to
reach equilibrium and, therefore, one can suppose that the system is always in its
equilibrium state until he reaches a bifurcation destabilizing it.
In terms of the variables x (r, t) and y (r, t), the linearized reaction-diffusion
equations are:
·
x(r, t) = ax(r, t) + by(r, t)+

A pedagogical interest of the ring model is that the space is the circle S1 , that
the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are the trigonometric functions, and that the
harmonic analysis is therefore nothing else than Fourier analysis. Let ξ (s, t) and
η (s, t) be the Fourier tranforms of x (r, t) and y (r, t):

y (r, t) are real, we must have ξ (s, t) = ξ (N − s, t) and η (s, t) = η (N − s, t).
The main interest of using harmonic analysis, is that, in the Fourier domain, the
system of equations becomes diagonal because the functions are expanded over a
basis of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator. Turing based his computations on
this separation of variables in the Fourier domain. Due to the definition of ξ (s, t)

The origin of instability

The fundamental new phenomenon introduced by diffusion is that the spectral analysis of the linearized system now depends upon diffusion which, by changing the
characteristic equation, can tranform eigenvalues with Re (λ) < 0 into eigenvalues
with Re (λ) > 0. It is the origin of diffusion-driven instabilities. Indeed, the Jacobian
is now

and the characteristic equation – also called a dispersion relation – is therefore

Turing denotes by ps and p0s , with Re (ps ) ≥ Re (p0s ) the two eigenvalues. If
ps 6= p0s then the solutions of the system in the Fourier domain are of the form

0
ξ (s, t) = As eps t + Bs eps t
0
η (s, t) = Cs eps t + Ds eps t
If ps and p0s are real, then AN −s = As , etc. If ps and p0s are conjugate complex
numbers, then BN −s = As , etc. It is straightforward to verify that the coefficients
satisfy the relations:

N 
Bs p0s − a + 4µ sin2 πs

N
Now if Max (Re (ps )) > 0, some diverging Fourier modes will become dominant
and push the system out of equilibrium. Such a possibility can happen only under
precise conditions relating the parameters a, b, c, d of the internal chemical equilibrium to the parameters µ, ν of the external spatial diffusion. Turing explains very
well that generically only a single Fourier mode (with its conjugate) can become
dominant. Indeed, if it was not the case,

13

“the quantities a, b, c, d, µ, ν will be restricted to satisfy some special
condition, which they would be unlikely to satisfy by chance.” (p. 50)
Let s0 be the index yielding Max (Re (ps )) and suppose Re (ps0 ) > 0. If the two
eigenvalues
ps0 and p0s0 are real, the pair (ps0 , pN −s0 ) will induce divergences since

Conditions for instability and the critical point

In the §9 “Further considerations on the mathematics of the ring”, Turing analyzes
further the conditions under which a diffusion-driven instability can occur. We will
present and complete his computations using the continuous model which is easier
to understand.
As reaction-diffusion equations are linear, and since every function on S 1 is a
linear superposition of harmonics eikθ , we look at solutions of the form


λ2 − Tr (J0 ) − k 2 Tr (D) λ + µ0 ν 0 k 4 − (ν 0 a + µ0 d) k 2 + Det (J0 ) = 0
We want Tr (J0 ) = a + d < 0 and Det (J0 ) = ad − bc > 0 to ensure the stability
of the internal chemical equilibrium. But we want also one λ with Re (λ) > 0
16

to ensure a diffusion-driven instability. As Tr (J0 ) < 0 and Tr (D) = µ0 + ν 0 >
0, this implies S (k 2 ) = Tr (J0 ) − k 2 Tr (D) < 0. If P (k 2 ) happened to be > 0,
we would have two roots with Re (λ) < 0, so we must have P (k 2 ) < 0. But as
Det (J0 ) > 0 by hypothesis and of course µ0 ν 0 k 4 > 0, we need in fact ν 0 a + µ0 d >
µ0 ν 0 k 2 + Det (J0 ) /k 2 > 0. This is a first condition. As Tr (J0 ) = a + d < 0 and
µ0 , ν 0 > 0, we need µ0 6= ν 0 since, if µ0 and ν 0 would be equal, we would have
ν 0 a + µ0 d = µ0 (a + d) < 0.
It is essential to strongly emphasize here the fact that the diffusibility of the two
morphogens X and Y must be sufficiently different in order that an instability can
occur. It is the key of Turing’s discovery.
In the example of §10, µ0 = α 12 , ν 0 = α 14 (α > 0), a = −2, d = 23 and the
condition ν 0 a + µ0 d = α −2 × 41 + 32 × 12 = α4 > 0 is therefore satisfied.
There is a second condition. P (k 2 ) = µ0 ν 0 k 4 −(ν 0 a + µ0 d) k 2 +Det (J0 ) is a second
degree polynomial in k 2 and we want it to become < 0 for values of k 2 which must
0
necessarilly be positive since k 2 is a real square. Let δ = µν 0 . The graph of P (k 2 ) is
a parabola Π starting at Det (J0 ) > 0 for k = 0. If δ < δ c for a critical value to be
computed, Π is over the k 2 -axis and the condition P (k 2 ) < 0 cannot be satisfied.
But if δ > δ c , Π intersects the k 2 -axis at two points k12 and k22 > k12 and inside the
interval [k12 , k22 ] the condition P (k 2 ) < 0 is satisfied: there exists an eigenvalue λ
with Re (λ) > 0.
The computation of δ c is rather tedious. Let u = k 2 . The polynomial P (u) and
its first and second derivatives are
P (u) = µ0 ν 0 u2 − (ν 0 a + µ0 d) u + ad − bc
P 0 (u) = − (ν 0 a + µ0 d) + 2µ0 ν 0 u
P 00 (u) = 2µ0 ν 0
So the minimum of Π is given by P 0 (u) = − (ν 0 a + µ0 d) + 2µ0 ν 0 u = 0 and it is a
minimum since P 00 (u) = 2µ0 ν 0 > 0. Its value is
u0 = k02 =

2µ0 ν 0

and we have

2
we verify that 81 = 41 × 41 × 8. So Turing’s system is at its critical point for γ = 0.
Let us now investigate more precisely the second degree equation giving δ c . It
can be written

and its two solutions are

ad − 2bc ± 2 −bc (ad − bc)

The bifurcation

After having analyzed the conditions of a diffusion-driven instability at a critical
point, Turing analyzed further the behavior of the system in the neighbourhood of
the critical point. To this end, he varied the small parameter γ around its critical
value γ = 0. Today, computations are very easy, but at his time they were difficult
and he must use the computer he had himself constructed. We will first do them
for the continuous model and then return to Turing’s own discrete model.

Let us now vary the small slow parameter γ. Turing varied γ almost adiabatically

from − 41 (stability) to 16
(instability) at speed γ̇ = 2−7 = 128
. This corresponds
to variations ε : −0.094 → 0.0235 for ε and t : 0 → 40 for the discrete time t.
For γ = − 14 , the equilibrium is (X0 = 0.78, Y0 = 1), and a0 = −1.9, b0 = −1.218,
c0 = 1.9, d0 = 1.156, and all Re (ps ) < 0: the system is stable. On the contrary, for
1
γ = − 16
, the equilibrium is (X1 = 1.053, Y1 = 1), and a1 = −2.023, b1 = −1.646,
c1 = 2.023, d1 = 1.583, and p3 = p17 = 0.0224 > 0, p4 = p16 = 0.012 > 0: the system
is unstable. The figure 11 shows the table of the 20 pairs (ps , p0s ) of eigenvalues for

In figure 12 we show the 20 graphs Re (ps ) as functions of t for γ varying from
1
. The time t varies from t = 0 to t = 40. We see the Re (ps ) which become
− 14 to 16
> 0 for s = 3, 17, 4, 16. At t = 40, p3 = p17 = 0.0224 and p4 = p16 = 0.012. For
s = 0, 1, 19, Re (ps ) presents an angular point because ps is a complex number with
Im (ps ) 6= 0. It is the same phenomenon as in the toy model of figure 4. Figure 13
shows the graphs of Re (p) and Im (p) in such a case.
In his paper, Turing computes (with his recently constructed Manchester computer) the table of the evolution of the ring (see figure 14) and shows how Fourier
modes become dominant after the bifurcation induced by the diffusion-driven instability (see figure 15). In the initial state, all cells are, up to small fluctuations, in
the equilibrium state (X0 = 1, Y0 = 1). After the bifurcation, a stationary oscillatory wave pattern with 3 lobes develops. The divergences induced by the instability
are tamed by two factors: (i) the concentration X cannot become < 0 and when
X (r, t) vanishes, the process stops locally, (ii) saturation non-linear effects allow a
new equilibrium to occur. These results constitute a great achievement.

Further aspects of Turing’s paper

In his paper, Turing evoked many other problems. In §4 he gave simple examples
for explaining the idea of “breakdown of symmetry and homogeneity” in pattern

formation. He explained also how exponential divergences are bounded by nonlinearities which allow new equilibria to emerge and he emphasized
“the effect of considering non-linear reaction rate functions when far from
homogeneity.” (p. 58)
In §8 he listed some “types of asymptotic behaviours in the ring after a lapse of
time”:
1. “stationary cases” where
the asymptotic regime is dominated by a pair of real

0
eigenvalues ps0 , ps0 ;
2. “oscillatory cases” where the asymptotic
 regime is dominated by a pair of
0
complex conjugated eigenvalues ps0 , ps0 (travelling waves);
3. “limit cases”.
He drew also phase diagrams in the parameter space which classify these different
regimes and explained the role of fluctuations in the bifurcation process.
Another extremely important anticipation is that in two-dimensionsional tissues
diffusion-driven instabilities can explain “dappled colour patterns” as observed on
sea shells or leopard’s coats. Figure 16 reproduces Turing’s figure 2.
Moreover, Turing anticipated the fact that his general model was able to induce
oscillating patterns when the chemical internal dynamics of each cell bifurcates towards a limit cycle by Hopf bifurcation. When such limit cycles propagate spatially,
many complex phenomena can emerge. Turing envisaged applications to organisms
such as plants (flowers, leaves) or Hydra. His predictions have been widely confirmed
later.
In the fascinating §12 “Chemical waves on spheres. Gastrulation”, Turing generalizes his one-dimensional ring model to a two-dimensional sphere model whose
26

geometry is more complex, the harmonic analysis on the sphere resting on the eigenfunctions of the spherical Laplacian, namely the spherical harmonics. His striking
idea was to apply the model to gastrulation in embryology, which is the step at which
the spherical symmetry of the blastula is broken. He developed this idea further in
his unpublished paper on phyllotaxis.
Finally, in the last §13 “Non-linear theory. Use of digital computer”, Turing came
back to the assumption that linearization is a good approximation and explained
that it is the case only in the neighbourhood of the first bifurcation. It is
“an assumption which is justifiable in the case of a system just beginning
to leave a homogeneous condition.” (p. 72)
For Turing it was risky to try to go beyond:
“One cannot hope to have any very embracing theory of such processes,
beyond the statement of the equations.” (p. 73)
Hence the fundamental interest of the just constructed digital computers enabling
numerical simulations avoiding the too drastic simplifications imposed by the search
of explicit theoretical solutions to the equations.

Conclusion: after Turing

To conclude this presentation of Turing’s 1952 paper, let us look briefly at the works
on reaction-diffusion equations after Turing. I have already tackle this theme in my
talk [19] at the IAPS 2001 Conference on Complexity and Emergence.

10.1

General reaction-diffusion models

Among the many specialists of the domain, we would cite Hans Meinhardt and
Alfred Gierer who, since 1972 [5], have considerably increased our knowledge on
reaction-diffusion models. They have shown that, for an activator/inhibitor pair of
morphogens, instabilities mainly result from the competition between a short range
slow activation and a long range fast inhibition, the inhibitor diffusing faster than
the excitator. This confirms Turing’s remark on the role of the difference between
the two diffusibility coefficients µ and ν.
A general Meinhardt-Gierer model has the form

2
ẋ = ρ xy − αx + σ x + µ∆x
α < β, µ  ν
ẏ = ρx2 − βy + σ y + ν∆y
The activator morphogen x is self-catalizing (x2 term in ẋ) and its production is
inhibited by the inhibitor morphogen y ( y1 term in ẋ). Moreover, x catalyzes its
inhibitor (x2 term in ẏ). The linear terms αx and βy (α < β) are degradation terms,
the constant σ y enables a stable homogeneous state and the constant σ x allows to
trigger the process. µ and ν are the diffusibility coefficients with µ (slow)  ν

(fast). A local fluctuation of the activator x induces a local peak of x which diffuses
slowly. But it amplifies also the inhibitor concentration y, and since y diffuses faster
than x it will inhibit the production of x at some distance (what is called a “lateral
inhibition”).
The coupling between the internal dynamics and external diffusion can induce
very complex patterns. Figure 17 shows two examples due to De Kepper [3], a system
of stripes with defects and a honeycomb pattern.
One of the best known achievements of Hans Meinhardt is his modelling of sea
shells. Since the growth of a shell results from an accretion of calcified matter
along its boundary, it can be represented by a two-dimensional diagram B × T =
boundary×time. The geometry is therefore in fact one-dimensional. The diffusion
of the activator from a local peak of concentration induces a triangle where the
pigmentation controlled by x is high, but the faster diffusion of the inhibitor stops
it after a while. Hence a cascade of triangles. Figure 18 shows the celebrated model
of Conus marmoreous.

10.2

From Alan Turing to René Thom

As we have seen, in Turing’s paper morphogenetic processes spatially unfold diffusiondriven instabilities. In the late 1960s, René Thom [20], [21] proposed a more general
model based on the general concept of bifurcation. The similarities and dissimilarities between Turing’s and Thom’s models are fascinating. The key idea is the same:
internal chimical dynamics (reactions) are coupled with external spatial dynamics,
the latter destabilize the former and morphologies spatially unfold the instabilities.
As we have seen, in Turing coupling is given by the diffusion of the reacting mor28

shell. In the background its reaction-diffusion model. (From Meinhardt [10]).
phogens. In Thom, coupling is more generally a spatial control of internal dynamics
and the morphogenetic discontinuities breaking the homogeneity of the substrate
are induced by bifurcations.

10.3

Beyond Turing

After Turing, many authors, e.g. James Murray [14], [15], introduced bifurcations
in reaction-diffusion equations. Let u be the vector (x, y) and consider a differential
equation u̇ = f (u, r) where r is a spatial control. When r varies and crosses a critical
value rc , the initial stable equilibrium state u0 of the system can collapse with an
unstable equilibrium and disappear. The system is therefore projected to another
equilibrium through this saddle-node bifurcation. Another most used bifurcation
is the Hopf bifurcation. When r varies and crosses a critical value rc , the initial
stable (i.e. attracting) equilibrium state u0 becomes a repellor and generates a
small attracting closed orbit (i.e. a limit cycle).
Consider for instance the following system analyzed by Robin Engelhardt [4]:

ẋ = −xy 2 + ay − (1 + b) x + δ∆x
ẏ = xy 2 − (1 + a) y + x + F + δ∆y
The chemical internal equilibria without diffusion (δ = 0) are solutions of the equations (if y 2 + 1 + b 6= 0):

that is
y 3 − F y 2 + (1 + b + ab) y − F (1 + b) = 0
which is a cubic equation with parameters a, b, F .
At the points where y 2 + 1 + b = 0, we have

ẋ = ay + δ∆x
ẏ = −bx − (1 + a) y + F + δ∆y
and this can be an equilibrium point for δ = 0 only if ay = 0 and −bx − y + F = 0.
If a 6= 0, this implies the condition b = −1, and the equilibrium is y = 0, x = −F .
If a = 0, the equilibrium would be −bx − y + F = 0 with y 2 + 1 + b = 0. Figure 19
shows some examples of patterns solution of this system of equations.
There is a wealth of material on these topics. The reader could look e.g. at
Harrison [6], Lee et al. [7], [8], Maini [9], Oyang-Swinney [16], or Pearson [17].

10.4

Experimental results

The validity of Turing’s models for embryology are still under discussion. But in
what concerns chimical and biological patterns their validity is without doubt. We
have seen Meinhardt’s examples. For chemical systems exact verifications go back
to 1990 and the works of the Bordeaux group of Patrick De Kepper (Castets, Dulos, Boissonade) on iodate-ferrocyanide-sulfite or clorite-iodide-malonic acid-starch
reactions in gel reactors.
It is a full universe of morphological phenomena and mathematical models that
Turing opened in 1952 with a remarkable foresightedness.
