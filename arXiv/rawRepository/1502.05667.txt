Abstract
RNA is a fundamental class of biomolecules that mediate a large variety of molecular
processes within the cell. Computational algorithms can be of great help in the
understanding of RNA structure-function relationship. One of the main challenges in
this field is the development of structure-prediction algorithms, which aim at the
prediction of the three-dimensional (3D) native fold from the sole knowledge of the
sequence. In a recent paper, we have introduced a scoring function for RNA structure
prediction. Here, we analyze in detail the performance of the method, we underline
strengths and shortcomings, and we discuss the results with respect to state-of-the-art
techniques. These observations provide a starting point for improving current
methodologies, thus paving the way to the advances of more accurate approaches for
RNA 3D structure prediction.

Introduction
RNA molecules carry out a large number of functions within cells, ranging from gene
expression to gene regulation (i.e. riboregulation) and to catalysis. An increasing
number of recent studies suggest that mutations in RNA-binding proteins and in noncoding sequences of the genome corresponding to RNA regulatory elements play an
important role in many genetic diseases [1,2] such as in autoimmune diseases [3,4].
Additionally, changes in the level of non-coding RNAs have been observed in various
cancers [5] and other pathological conditions such as cardiomyopathy [6] and
neurodegeneration [7].!These diseases are typically associated with anomalous downor up-riboregulation or with abnormal RNA molecules concentration [8].
Consequently, it is common to use specific RNA molecules as tumor markers [9] or for
viral micro-RNA to be recognized as etiologic agents causing disease in humans [10].
Furthermore, RNA interference is considered as a new alternative in the therapeutic
treatment of genetic and autoimmune diseases [11,12].

It is therefore of paramount importance to understand at a molecular level the function
of RNA molecules. As for proteins, the function and mechanism of RNA molecules
are intimately related to their three-dimensional structure – which is dictated by their
sequence. A large suite of experimental approaches for determining the sequence and
the secondary structure of RNA molecules exists. However, the atomic-detailed
determination of the three-dimensional (3D) structure via X-ray crystallography or
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments of RNA is still very complex an
expensive. This motivated the development of computational algorithms to model
and predict RNA structure [13].

Many RNA 3D structure prediction algorithms typically rely on two ingredients: i) a
sampling scheme, that generates putative RNA 3D structures (also called decoys), and
ii) a scoring function, that, in the ideal case, makes it possible to identify among the
decoys those with a native-like conformation.

In a recent publication, we have shown that relative nucleobase positions and
orientations are sufficient to describe RNA structure and dynamics [14]. Additionally,
we have introduced a framework that can be used to construct a knowledge-based
scoring function for RNA structural prediction (ESCORE), which compares favorably
to fully atomistic, state-of-the-art techniques.

In this research highlight we scrutinize the prediction capabilities of the ESCORE.
We consider the cases in which our approach successfully and unsuccessfully predicts
near-native RNA structures, and we analyze in details the 3D structure of the best
predictions.

Results
The relative position and orientation of nucleobases in folded RNA molecules display
very specific geometrical propensities, that are dominated by the presence of stacking
and base-pairing interactions, as shown in Fig. 1.
To each point of the space around a nucleobase can be therefore assigned the
probability of observing a neighboring base in that specific position and orientation.
In other words, given a pair of bases, it is possible to quantify to which degree their
relative position and orientation is compatible with the expected distribution observed
in known RNA 3D structures. Since ribosomal RNA is the one for which the largest

and most complex structures are available, we base our analysis on a high-resolution
structure of the large ribosomal subunit (PDB code 1S72 [15]). For example, in this
structure, observing two stacked bases, or two complementary bases forming a
Watson-Crick base pair, is highly probable, while it is very unlikely to find two bases
in very close contact (clashing). Recently, we have introduced a measure, called
ESCORE, which makes it possible to quantify the accordance of any arbitrary RNA
3D conformation with the local, three-dimensional probability map obtained from the
large ribosomal subunit shown in Fig. 1.
The ESCORE serves as a scoring function for RNA 3D structure prediction. More
precisely, given a large number of conformations of an RNA molecule (decoy set),
the ESCORE ideally ranks these conformations from the closest to the furthest from
the native state, without prior knowledge of the native state itself.
We benchmark the ESCORE on 20 different decoy sets generated using the FARNA
algorithm [16], which is a subset of the decoy sets we analyzed in our previous work
[14]

. This subset is particularly meaningful as a structure prediction exercise, since

here the decoys were sampled without including any information about the actual
experimental structure. For each decoy set, we assess i) if the known, native structure
has the best score among all the decoys; and ii) the deviation between the native state
and the best-scoring decoy. The latter test is more stringent, as in a real structureprediction experiment the best-scoring decoy represents the putative native structure.
The results, summarized in Table 1, show that for almost all decoy sets (18/20) the
native state has a better (higher) ESCORE than any other structure in the decoy set
(rank=0). Additionally, in these cases, the best-scoring decoy typically displays a
similar secondary structure compared to the native state (Fig. 2), indicating that in a
blind prediction test results would be satisfactory.

For two decoy sets, however, a non-zero number of decoys score better than the
native structure. The most emblematic example is shown in Fig. 3. As in the previous
case, the native and the best-scoring decoy both share the same secondary structure.
However, we notice that the ESCORE relative to the stem region is higher in the
decoy when compared to the native structure. By close inspection, we observe that
this discrepancy is due to a significant difference in the base-base vertical distance
between consecutive, stacked bases (3.66±0.53 Å for the decoy and 4.00±0.45 Å for
native, considering the helix region only). More generally, it can be seen that the
vertical distance between stacked bases in A-form helices of NMR models can
deviate considerably from the typical distance observed in crystal structures. As an
example, the vertical distance is 3.42±0.32 Å for the crystal structure of the large
ribosomal subunit and 4.17Å ± 0.45 Å for the NMR structure of the nucleolin-binding
RNA hairpin (PDB code 1QWA[17]).
This point is of particular importance when considering that ESCORE, as well as
many other structure-prediction algorithms such as FARFAR [18] and RASP [19], are
trained on high-resolution crystal structures. Therefore, it is not surprising that all
these algorithms perform better on decoys relative to X-ray structures compared to
NMR models, as also observed in the study of Bernauer et al. [20]
Finally, we inspect the results obtained on the challenging decoy set relative to the
loop D/loop E arm of E. coli 5S rRNA, composed by a long stem with one terminal
hairpin loop (PDB code 1A4D[21]). In this case, ESCORE correctly assigns to the
native structure a good score (Fig. 4). However, the best scoring decoy is completely
different from the native, featuring not one, but two hairpin loops. In Fig. 3 we also
show that the secondary structure of the second-best scoring decoy is similar to that of
the native state. Two items should therefore be addressed: i) why the two-best scoring

decoys, that are completely different, have similar ESCORE; and ii) why is the bestscoring decoy so different from the native.
The answer to these questions can be found in the observation that the number of
favorable base-base interactions in hairpin loops and in helices is very similar. Since
the ESCORE can be considered as a weighted count of base-base interactions, good
scores are assigned to both decoys, irrespectively of the presence of one or two
hairpins. It is well known from secondary-structure studies that the presence of
hairpin loops is energetically unfavorable with respect to helices [22]. This effect is not
explicitly taken into account in the ESCORE, and is thus an important ingredient that
could be used to improve the method. This explanation is also supported by the fact
that the very same issue affects other scoring functions that heavily rely on localcontacts, such as FARFAR [18] and RASP [19].

Conclusions
The ESCORE can correctly discriminate and rank decoy structures among most of the
cases examined in this Paper. When compared with state-of-the-art, all-atom methods
such as FARFAR or RASP, ESCORE consistently performs equally well and in some
cases better, thus demonstrating the validity of the approach.
We examined in detail two decoy sets for which ESCORE (as well as FARFAR and
RASP) fails in identifying the closest-to-native decoy or in assigning the best score to
the native structure, and we identified two major sources of errors. Firstly, we
observed that it is more difficult to obtain good scores for RNA structures solved by
NMR. This is likely due to significant differences in the helix geometry between Xray crystal structures, which are used to parameterize ESCORE, and NMR models.

Furthermore, we have shown that the ESCORE does not penalize to a sufficient
degree the presence of hairpins with respect to helices. This problem, affecting
ESCORE as well as other state-of-the-art, atomistic methods, is an important
shortcoming that should be addressed properly in the future in order to allow for
accurate RNA 3D structure predictions.
