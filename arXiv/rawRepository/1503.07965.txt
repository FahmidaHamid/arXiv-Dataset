Abstract
The precise sequence of aminoacids plays a central role in the tertiary
structure of proteins and their functional properties. The HydrophobicPolar lattice models have provided valuable insights regarding the energy
landscape. We demonstrate here the isomorphism between the protein
sequences and designable structures for two and three dimensional lattice
proteins of very long aminoacid chains using exact enumerations and
intuitive considerations. It is customarily thought that computations of
this magnitude will require ‘million years’ with the present day
computers. We emphasize that the topological arrangement of the
aminoacid residues alone is adequate to deduce the designable and nondesignable sequences without explicit recourse to energetics and
degeneracies. The results indicate the computational feasibility of realistic
lattice models for proteins in two and three dimensions and imply that the
fundamental principle underlying the designing of structures is the
connectivity of the hydrophobic and polar residues.

1. Introduction
The prediction of tertiary structures of proteins from the
constituent aminoacid sequences constitutes a major challenging problem
in science, on account of its complexity and importance1.Despite
considerable efforts in unraveling the mysterious connection between the
native structures of proteins and their most stable sequences, the
mechanism underlying the energy landscape is not yet clear2.However,
valuable insights have hitherto been gathered from minimalistic lattice
models of proteins and simple fundamental rules seem to govern the
native structures. The highly popular Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model3 for
a chain of N aminoacid residues (or nodes) has provided information
regarding the designable protein sequences vis a vis conformations for
two and three dimensional lattices of moderate chain lengths. The lattice
models provide a basis for comprehending the ground state of the native
structures of proteins if systematically and exhaustively analyzed. The
exact enumeration has been recognized as an NP hard problem4 which
restricts the conformational analysis to chains of small lengths. Further,
the tertiary structures of proteins is dictated solely by the HP sequence
5
and a recent experimental evidence highlights the importance of the
sequence alignment using a protein-like polymer sequence for the coil to
globule transition6. It is therefore imperative to carry out an exact
sequence-conformation mapping from a new perspective for fairly long
aminoacid chain lengths. The applicability of spin glass models to coil to
globule transitions has also been demonstrated7. In the case of protein
sequences, the energies and degeneracies of 2N states need to be
computed for identifying the native states. This can be carried out either
using Monte Carlo simulations8 or graph theoretical procedures9.
Here, we report a new method of comprehending the
conformational and sequence spaces of proteins for typical two and three
dimensional lattices within a modified HP model framework, the chain
lengths considered here for exact analysis being noticeably very large. In
contrast to the hitherto-known lattice models which emphasize the
pairwise interaction energies of various contacts, the present analysis
demonstrates that the mere enumeration of the topological arrangements
2

is adequate to decipher the native sequences and conformations. While the
number of hydrophobic-hydrophilic contacts are exactly enumerated here
for two-dimensional square lattices (with aminoacid chain lengths N =
64,144 and 256) and cubic lattices (with N =27 and 64), the most
designable and non-designable sequences are deduced for N = 16; N =25
and N= 36 in two dimensions and for N =27 and N= 64 in three
dimensions.
Enumeration of topological arrangement of protein sequences
The enumeration of the black-white edges {A(p,q)} for large
lattice sizes in two and three dimensions is a challenging task and plays a
central role in the calculation of the associated partition functions10 .When
this counting is accomplished, the number of ways of obtaining different
hydrophobic-hydrophilic contacts becomes available for all compositions
of proteins. Hence a high level of discrimination among the protein
sequences arises in this approach due to the exact counting of the
hydrophobic-hydrophilic contacts. As is well-known, different
compositions lead to dissimilar sequences11. Furthermore, the exact
analysis pertaining to long chains is essential in order to investigate the
cooperative phenomena12.
(A)Square lattice
Elsewhere, the counting of the black-white edges for the estimation
of the partition function of two-dimensional nearest neighbor Ising
models has been reported in the case of a square lattice of 36 sites13 .We
have carried out here this enumeration for the chain lengths (N= 64; 144
and 256) for each composition of the protein using the complete sequence
space (2N)and Fig 1 depicts the dependence of A(p,q) on the fraction of
the hydrophobic residues (p/N)and H-P contacts (q/N)for a square lattice
of 64 sites, the numbers being ferreted out from the exact enumeration.
There is a symmetry in the entries of A (p, q) at the midpoint viz p=N/2
indicating that the labeling of the H and P residues is interchangeable. The
total number of the arrangements ( ∑ A(p,q)) is maximum when the ratio
of hydrophobic to polar residues is unity(i.e. p = N/2) whatever be the
chain length and it is well known that unique optimum embedding occurs
when the H/P ratio is nearly unity14.When N is odd,the frequency of
3

occurrence is maximum at p=(N-1)/2.It is inferred that for a square lattice
of 16 aminoacid chains, when the number of hydrophobic residues (p)is
12, five different arrangements are possible with q = 8;10;12;14 and 16 ,
consistent with an earlier analysis15 .
(B)Simple cubic lattice
While the methodology for simple cubic lattices is identical
as for square lattices, the maximum value of N was fixed as 64 and Fig 1b
depicts the variation of A (p, q) with the fraction of the hydrophobic
residues (p/N) and H-P contacts (q/N) for a simple cubic lattice of 64
sites, as an illustration.
Identification of favorable protein sequences
In the original HP model3, the origin of the native structures
consists in the favorable negative interaction energy between H-H contacts
(E H-H) while the H-P (EH-P) and P-P (E P-P) energies were assigned zero.
Subsequently, other parametrization schemes for the interaction energies
were envisaged16-18.An alternate method advocated in dimensionless units19
is the following: EH-H = -2.3; E H-P = -1 and EP-P= 0.Thus, the elucidation of
the precise energetic factors which control the design of protein sequences is
a non-trivial endeavor.
(A)Square lattice
For any fraction of the hydrophobic residues (p/N), the arrangements
with the least number of H-P contacts can be deciphered. This number
represents the upper limit of the H-P contacts for any favorable sequence.
If the value of p is chosen as N/2 for brevity, q ≥8 (for N=16), q ≥ 12 (for
N=36), q≥ 16(for N=64), q≥20 (for N =144) and q ≥ 24 (for N=256) are
considered as non-favorable. This assumption is consistent with the fact
that an alternating sequence of polar and non-polar aminoacids hinders
protein folding 20.Typically, in the case of 16-residue aminoacids, the total
number of sequences is 12870 when p=8 and hence the percentage of
favorable sequences is 0.062.While the total number of sequences (viz
12,870) can easily be obtained using the binomial theorem, the precise
manner in which these 12,870 sequences comprise different types of
black-white edges is required for identifying the favorable and non4

favorable sequences. The identification of such favorable sequences is
feasible for all compositions of proteins till N= 256 for square lattices.
(B)Simple cubic lattice
As in the above square lattice case, the arrangements wherein
q ≥14 (for N=33) and q ≥18(for N=43), are considered non-favorable
sequences for respective p/N values of 13/27 and 32/64 .We emphasize
that the enumeration of the hydrophobic-polar contacts is essentially a
preliminary step, since the designable sequences should take into
account,(i) the self-avoiding nature;(ii) the hydrophobic-polar ratio and
(iii) the connectivity of the favorable sequence(s).This inter alia requires
the enumeration of the conformations in two and three dimensions,
confined to the lattice.
Enumeration of all conformations
The conformations of lattice proteins are often analyzed using
two or three dimensional self-avoiding random walks21 and these
estimates are essential to deduce the percentage of designable
conformations. The composition of the lattice protein is given by p while
q is a measure of the topological contact; hence the designable sequences
need to be encoded, consistent with the favorable sequence(s).
(A)Square lattice
We have enumerated the total number of conformations for
aminoacid residues ranging from N =4 to N = 51(Table 1). While the
conformations for N till 25 have been enumerated earlier22, those for N >
25, have been provided here for the first time. However, the scaling
arguments using critical exponents can yield estimates till N =71 by
extrapolation23.
(B)Simple cubic lattice
We have enumerated the number of conformations for N ranging
from 4 to 40 in the case of simple cubic lattices (Table 2). The hithertoknown estimates 24 till N = 36 have been reproduced apart from new exact
values till N=40 here.
Enumeration of the Designable and Non-designable Sequences
The foregoing analysis indicates a method of identifying
favorable and non-favorable sequences for square and simple cubic
5

lattices, employing the information on H-P contacts. A given structure can
in principle be designed from a large number of designing sequences (SN)
and DN denotes the number of designable conformations for chains of
length N.
(A) Square lattice
We establish here (Methods Section), the precise
isomorphism between the favorable sequence (identified from the least
number of black-white edges qmin) and the designing sequence
(enumerated from the constraint { q ≤ (qmin -1)}). These values computed
here (for p/N =0.5) solely from the topological contacts, are entirely in
agreement with the hitherto-known values till N = 25 ) while SN for N >
25 are provided here for the first time(Table 3). Hence it follows that all
the hitherto-known values of SN pertain to the H/P ratio of unity with the
earlier-mentioned constraint on the topological contacts {q ≤ (qmin -1)}
being implicitly present and it is of interest to enquire the influence of H/P
ratio on these. As anticipated, the maximum value of SN occurs when H/P
=1. From SN, the most designable sequences (Table 4) are further
deciphered by invoking the ‘adjacent sites’ assumption (Methods Section)
and the flowchart shown in Fig 2 illustrates the modus operandi involved
in the elucidation for N =36.The other structures are designated as less
designable. We note that the optimal structure for N =36 earlier deduced
using a deterministic optimization approach25 and a systematic
designability criterion within a modified HP model26 is consistent with the
‘adjacent sites’ assumption invoked here. A combined approach using
genetic algorithm in conjunction with Taguchi method has also been
studied27 for N=64. Figs 3, 4 and 5 depict respectively the most
designable sequences for N=16, N=25 and N=36. Figs 6, 7 and 8 depict
respectively the non - designable sequences for N=16, N=25 and N=36.
(B)Simple cubic lattice
The non-favorable sequences are those having H-P contacts ≥ q min
for any chosen hydrophobic ratio. In view of the lattice coordination
number being six for simple cubic lattices, the earlier ansatz of estimating
the self-avoiding walks with q ≤ (qmin -1) is not valid for obtaining the
designing sequences. Since protein folding is predominantly associated
6

with the hydrophobic phenomena it is appropriate to search for the least
number of H-P contacts whereby the natural choices for q min are zero and
unity for any composition of the protein. These values computed using
self-avoiding walks under the constraint q ≤ 1 (for p/N =0.5) enumerated
here (Table 5) solely from the H-P contacts, are entirely in agreement28
with the hitherto-available values (till N=19). However, SN for larger
aminoacid chain lengths (N >19) have been reported here for the first
time. The total number of designable sequences for 4*4*4 lattice is 389
and the flow chart in Fig 2 depicts the methodology for deducing the most
designable sequences. A Monte Carlo simulation incorporating the
solvent-aminoacid interaction energies has been investigated for
calculating the folding time and melting temperatures29 restricting the
analysis to 27 aminoacid chains. In a hybrid method involving genetic
algorithm and particle swarm optimization, the local search method with
six internal coordinates has been invoked30. The influence of H/P ratio on
SN can also be deciphered as before and its value is maximum when the
fraction of the hydrophobic residues is 1/2. Figs 9 and 10
depict
respectively the most designable sequences for N=27 and N=64. Table 6
provides the partitioning of SN into the most designable and less
designable sequences for N ranging from 4 to 27 and for N=64.Figs 11
and 12 illustrate respectively typical non - designable sequences for N=27
and N=64.
The foregoing analysis indicates that the precise counting of the
topological contacts between the hydrophobic and polar residues for any
lattice proteins is adequate to decipher their designable and nondesignable sequences in two and three dimensions. Thus, the connectivity
dictates the most designable protein structure as has been noted earlier31.
The number of designable sequences is intimately linked to the
composition of the proteins. Hence the hitherto-limited success in the
protein folding problem may be not due to the limitation associated with
the exhaustive searching of the sequence and conformational energy
space.
While the final test regarding the accuracy of predicting protein
structures from the constituent aminoacid sequences requires the analysis
7

of the actual database32, the method propounded here indicates the
computational feasibility of lattice proteins as well as the existence of a
general robust practical method for exactly enumerating the designable
and non-designable sequences.
Methods
We assume that a given protein consists of various compositions of
hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) residues, spanning a lattice of N sites as in
the original H-P model 3; however, no pair-wise interaction energies have
been explicitly invoked here. We consider here two-dimensional square
and three-dimensional simple cubic lattices. Either a hydrophobic
(designated as ‘black’) or hydrophilic part (denoted as ‘white’) occupies
each vertex. The symbols ‘p’ and ‘q’ denote respectively the number of
the hydrophobic residues and hydrophobic-hydrophilic contacts (blackwhite edges). The combinatorial problem consists in counting all the
arrangements of the black-white edges viz {A (p, q)}. In order to facilitate
extrapolation to infinite sites, periodic boundary conditions are assumed
as is customary in statistical physics33, Monte Carlo simulation34 and
protein folding35. This enumeration yields all the hydrophobic-hydrophilic
contacts {A (p, q)} when the fraction of the hydrophobic residues (p/N)
varies from 0 to 1. We have adopted a multi-step strategy to deduce the
interdependence of sequences and conformations of proteins. Firstly, we
enumerate exactly all the hydrophobic-hydrophilic contacts in lattice
proteins of various compositions and this yields the topological alignment
of sequences and their statistical weights. Secondly, we identify the most
favorable sequence vis a vis native state of proteins for any given
hydrophobic to polar ratio by identifying the number of arrangements
with the least number of black-white edges (qmin). The sequences wherein
q ≥ qmin are considered non-favorable for a chosen p/N value. Thirdly, for
this composition, we compute the number of designing sequences (SN) by
counting all the self-avoiding walks for the H-P contacts when (A) q ≤
qmin -1 for square and (B) q ≤ 1 for simple cubic lattices. Fourthly, we
infer the most designable and less designable sequences for square lattices
by postulating that the starting and destination sites should be either on
the same row or column (‘adjacent’ arrangements) This‘adjacent’
8

arrangement has the highest frequency of occurrence. The identification
of the most designable sequences in simple cubic lattices is more involved
due to the coordination number of the lattice being six; hence we follow a
different approach wherein six different structures designated as p1, p2,
p3, p4, p5 and p6 have been invoked.
