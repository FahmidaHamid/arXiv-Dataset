Nucleic acids are negatively charged macromolecules and their structure properties are strongly coupled to metal
ions in solutions. In this paper, the salt effects on the flexibility of single-stranded (ss) nucleic acid chain ranging from
12 to 120 nucleotides are investigated systematically by the coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations where the salt
ions are considered explicitly and the ss chain is modeled with the virtual-bond structural model. Our calculations
show that, the increase of ion concentration causes the structural collapse of ss chain and multivalent ions are much
more efficient in causing such collapse, and trivalent/small divalent ions can both induce more compact state than a
random relaxation state. We found that monovalent, divalent and trivalent ions can all overcharge ss chain, and the
dominating source for such overcharging changes from ion-exclusion-volume effect to ion Coulomb correlations. In
addition, the predicted Na+ and Mg2+-dependent persistence length lp’s of ss nucleic acid are in accordance with the
available experimental data, and through systematic calculations, we obtained the empirical formulas for lp as a
function of [Na+], [Mg2+] and chain length.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nucleic acids have important biological functions in
gene storage, transcription, and gene regulation. Their
functions are strongly coupled to the structures and the
proper structure changes.1-12 Due to the polyanionic nature of
nucleic acid backbone, the folding into compact native
structures always involves strong Coulombic repulsions, thus
requires metal ions in solutions, such as Na+ and Mg2+, to
neutralize the negative backbone charges and stabilize the
folded structures. Therefore, metal ions play essential roles in
nucleic acid structures and functions.1-12
Single-stranded (ss) chain is an elementary structural and
functional segment of nucleic acids. For example, RNAs
structures generally consist of different type of ss loops, and
ss chain is also the denatured state of nucleic acids.13-21
Furthermore, ss chain is an important intermediate in many
key biochemical processes, such as replication,
recombination repair and transcription, and is specifically
recognized by many proteins.22 The flexibility of ss chain,
which may be sensitive to ionic environment, plays a

significant role in its interactions with other macromolecules,
e.g., proteins.23 Therefore, quantitative understanding how
ionic condition, including ion concentration, ion valence and
ion size, determines the flexibility of ss nucleic acids, is an
important step toward understanding nucleic acid structures
and functions. However, due to the negatively charged nature
and strong dynamic conformational fluctuation, to
quantitatively characterize the ion effects on the flexibility of
ss nucleic acid chain is still a challenge, especially for long
chains in multivalent ion solutions.
In general, there have been several classic
polyelectrolyte theories for treating the ion-nucleic acid
interactions: the counterion condensation (CC) theory,24 the
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory,25-27 and the Debye-Hückel
(DH) theory.28-31 These existed theories have been quite
successful in predicting electrostatic properties of nucleic
acids and proteins in ion/aqueous solutions.24-31 However, the
CC theory is based on the simplified line-charge structural
model and is a double-limit law, thus is inapplicable to the
conformational fluctuation of ss chain of finite-length.24 The
PB theory is a mean-field theory that ignores ion-ion

1

correlations, which can be important for multivalent ions, e.g.,
Mg2+.32-34 The DH theory, characterized by a screened
Coulomb potential between charged particles, is the
linearized analytical form of PB equation, and thus
applicable to the case of relatively weak electrostatic field
and monovalent ion solution. Recently, to account for the
effects of ion correlation and ion-binding fluctuation, a
tightly bound ion (TBI) model was developed.33 The model
has been successful in predicting the Na+/Mg2+ effects in
RNA
stabilizing DNA/RNA helices/hairpins,18-20 and
tertiary structures.35,36 However, for the ss nucleic acid with
very strong conformational fluctuations, the TBI model at the
present level is computationally very expensive.18
Parallel to the development of theories, computer
simulations have been employed to the study of
polyelectrolyte systems, which greatly enhanced our
qualitative understanding of nucleic acid-ion interaction,
since ss nucleic acid is a special one of polyelectrolytes and
shares some general ion-dependent properties. However,
until now, the simulational investigations were either based
on different-level approximations or ignored specific nucleic
acid structural features.37-43 For example, most of them
investigated macroscopic properties of bead-spring model of
polyelectrolytes in salt-free or explicit dilute salt solutions, or
predicted DNA structure changes by accounting for ion
effects through a screened DH potential.37-43 Beyond the
coarse-grained simulation models, all-atom simulations can
capture the molecule structures and solvent details at
atomistic level.44-47 But for ss chain with strong
conformational fluctuation, all-atom simulations are
computationally too expensive. Therefore, quantitative and
systematic understanding on the flexibility of ss nucleic acids
in ion solutions is still limited in both theories and computer
simulations, especially for ss chains in multivalent ion
solutions.18
In this work, we will employ the coarse-grained Monte
Carlo simulations to systematically study the flexibility of ss
nucleic acid chain of finite length in monovalent, divalent
and trivalent salt solutions. Beyond the previous CC, PB and
DH-based studies, the present method explicitly accounts for

ion correlations and ion-binding fluctuations, and the
structural model for ss nucleic acid is based on the
near-realistic nucleic acid backbone derived from a variety of
RNA structures in protein data bank (PDB). In the paper, we
emphasize the ion-dependent macroscopic structural collapse
and persistence length lp, and the comparisons with the
available experimental data. In addition, we obtain the
empirical formulas for lp as a function of [Na+] and [Mg2+],
and chain length N.
II. MODEL AND METHOD
A. Structural Model of ss Nucleic Acid
Our system consists of a ss nucleic acid and spherical
ions dissociated from the added salt. The ions are considered
explicitly and the ss nucleic acid is modeled as a
coarse-grained structural chain with the virtual-bond
model,48-52 since the accurate all-atomistic representation
would involve huge computational complexity and the
simplified virtual-bond structural model can account for the
backbone conformation while retain the advantages of a
coarse-grained model.48-52 As shown in Fig. 1a, a nucleotide
is represented by the unit defined by two virtual bonds: C4-P
and P-C4,48-52 where P and C4 stand for the phosphate and
carbon (C4) atoms, respectively. Each nucleotide carries a
negative unit charge at the center of phosphate atom.18
Phosphate and carbon atoms are treated as spheres with the
respective van der Waals radii of 1.9Å and 1.7Å.53 The
distribution probabilities of bond lengths for C4-P and P-C4
and the bond angles for C4-P-C4 and P-C4-P are both obtained
through the statistical calculations over 40-individual of
RNA structures (with the chain length N ranging from 40 to
200-nt) deposited in PDB database, as shown in Figs. 1b and
1c; see Appendix for the PDB codes. Since the angles of
C4-P-C4 and P-C4-P are very similar, in the work, we do not
distinguish the two angles. The previous studies have shown
that the virtual-bond model could give good predictions on
RNA
secondary/pseudoknot
structures
and
thermodynamics.49-52

the sequential P (red color) and C4 (green color) atoms.18,49-52 The two structural parameters, the bond angle θ and bond length b, define
the backbone of the ss chain. (b, c) The normalized populations P(θ) and P(b) of θ (b) and b (c) for ss nucleic acid chain are obtained by
the statistical analysis over the all-atom structures of 40 RNA molecules with the length ranging from 40-nt to 200-nt. The PDB codes
of these RNAs are listed in the Appendix.

B. Simulation Method
Monovalent, divalent, and trivalent salts are added into a
cubic cell and dissociate into monovalent, divalent, and
trivalent cations and coions respectively, which are modeled
as charged spheres. Solvent (water) molecules are modeled
implicitly as a medium with dielectric constant ε (ε=78.3 at
room temperature). In this study, the ions are assumed to be
hydrated, and the radii of hydrated Na+, Mg2+ and Co3+ ions
are taken as 2.7Å, 3.6Å and 4.1Å,54 respectively. The coions
are treated as SO42- with hydrated radii 4.4Å54 to decrease the
simulation complexity (number of ions). The testing
calculations show that the results for the coions of Cl(~3.3Å54) are quantitatively similar to those for SO42- as
coions. The simulational cell is always kept neutral and the
periodic boundary condition is applied. To diminish the
boundary effect, we always keep the cell size larger than a ss
chain by 8 times of Debye length depending on the salt
concentration. Our control tests by enlarging cell size (e.g.,
12 times of Debye length) show that our results are rather
stable.
Monte Carlo process is performed with the traditional
Metropolis algorithm in a canonical ensemble.55 To improve
the sampling efficiency, two different types of moves are
performed: conformations of ss chain are generated by pivot
move and ions are moved by translation. The pivot move
algorithm has been demonstrated to be rather efficient in
sampling conformations of a polymer.56,57 As shown in Fig.
S1 (in Supporting Information), a ss chain can rapidly reach
the equilibrium with the pivot move algorithm. In each run of
the simulations, the first period of 0-3×106 Monte Carlo steps
is used to relax the system to an equilibrium state, and the
following 107 steps are used to make statistical analysis on
the structure properties of the system in equilibrium.
C. Energy Functions
In the present model, four types of interactions are
accounted for. The first one is the excluded-volume
interaction applied for all the particles, including monomers
(P and C4 atoms), cations, and coions, and can be given by a
truncated Lennard-Jones potential

length. Here, ε is the dielectric constant of solvent and

ε 0 is

the vacuum permittivity.
The third energy Ubond is the bond connectivity potential
energy used to describe the virtual bond length between the
adjacent atoms (P and C4) along a ss nucleic acid backbone.
The fourth energy Uangle is the harmonic angle potential
energy, which gives the virtual bond angle of ss chain. Ubond
and Uangle are given by the following expressions respectively

U bond ( b ) = − k BT ln[ P ( b )];
U angle (θ ) = − k BT ln[ P (θ )],

(3)

where P(b) and P(θ) are the normalized probabilities for bond
length b between neighboring (P and C4) atoms and for bond
angle θ between the neighboring virtual bonds along the
nucleic acid backbone, respectively. In the future work, the
further improvement can be made on the Ubond and Uangle to
more accurately catch the specific local dynamics and
structures of RNAs in the all-atomistic model.58 As shown in
Fig. 1 and subsection of “Structural Model of ss Nucleic
Acid”, the two interaction potentials can give a good
description for ss nucleic acid backbone.
Ш. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we first investigate the ion-dependent
structural collapse and ion-binding properties for ss nucleic
acid chains of different lengths immersed in Na+, Mg2+, and
Co3+ salt solutions. Afterwards, we examine the ion size
effect, and calculate the persistence length of ss nucleic acid
and make comparisons with the available experimental data.
Finally, we drive the empirical formulas for lp as a function of
[Na+] and [Mg2+], and chain length, through the systematic
calculations. Our calculations cover the broad ranges of ion
3

concentrations: [Na+] ∈ [0.001M, 1M], [Mg2+] ∈ [0.03mM,
0.3M], and [Co3+] ∈ [0.01mM, 0.1M], and chain length range:
N ∈ [12-nt, 120-nt].
A. Ion-dependent Collapse of ss Nucleic Acid Chain
Since the structural behaviors in monovalent, divalent
and trivalent ion solutions share some general features, in the
following, we first describe the general features for the
ion-dependent structure collapse and then discuss the specific
features for Na+, Mg2+ and Co3+, respectively.
1. General features of structural collapse
As shown in Fig. 2 for Ree and Fig. S2 (in Supporting
Information) for Ree/N, ion-dependent collapse of ss chain
shows the following general features for Na+, Mg2+, and Co3+
salts:
(i)
As ion concentration increases, Ree (Ree/N) of ss chain
decreases, which corresponds to the ion-induced
structural collapse. Physically, the structural collapse
of ss chain is opposed by the Coulomb repulsions
between the backbone negative charges, while ions in
solution can bind to nucleic acid and reduce such
Coulomb repulsions. A higher ion concentration
would reduce such repulsive force more strongly due
to the lower entropy penalty for ion-binding and
consequently stronger ion neutralization, causing the
ion-induced collapse of the ss chain.
(ii)
Longer ss chain shows the stronger ion-concentration
dependent structural collapse. i.e., Ree (Ree/N)
decreases more sharply with the increase of ion
concentration. Because longer chain involves
stronger electric field in the vicinity, its structural
collapse can cause stronger Coulomb repulsive force,
consequently shows a stronger dependence on ion
concentration.
In addition to the above described general behaviors, our
calculations also show the special features on the structural
collapse of ss chain in Na+, Mg2+ and Co3+ solutions,
respectively.
2. In Na+ solutions
Fig. 2a and Fig. S2 (in Supporting Information) show
that, the increase of [Na+] causes the structural collapse of ss
chain from an extended state to a near random relaxation state
at ~1M [Na+] where a ss chain behaves like a neutral chain,
which is due to the stronger ion binding and the
near-full-neutralization at very high [Na+].

3. In Mg2+ solutions
Mg2+ has higher charge as well as larger hydrated size
than Na+. As Fig. 2b shows, Mg2+ is more efficient in
inducing the structural collapse of ss chain than Na+ beyond
the mean-field concept such as ionic strength. For example,
for N=48-nt ss chain, Ree at 0.03M [Mg2+] is close to that at
1M [Na+] (see Fig. 2). Moreover, the dependence of Ree on
[Mg2+] is weaker than that on [Na+]. Such specific role of
Mg2+ comes from the higher ionic charge of Mg2+. Due to the
stronger Mg2+-phosphate attraction, Mg2+-binding is more
enthalpically favorable and (effectively) less entropically
unfavorable than Na+. Consequently, Mg2+-binding and Ree
are less dependent on ion concentration. Such higher
efficiency of Mg2+ over Na+ in causing the chain collapse is
more pronounced for longer chains.
4. In Co3+ solutions
To extend our analysis to higher valence ions, we
examine the Co3+ solution. As shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S2c
(in Supporting Information), Co3+ is much higher efficient in
causing ss chain collapse than Mg2+ and Na+, and such higher
efficiency more pronounced for longer chain. Moreover, ss
chains show much weaker ion concentration-dependence of
Ree for Co3+ than those for Mg2+ and Na+ due to the much
stronger ion binding affinity and much stronger ion Coulomb
correlations.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S2c, the
3+
Co -dependence of chain collapse shows a V-shaped Ree
curve against [Co3+], i.e., with the addition of Co3+, Ree (Ree/N)
decreases at low [Co3+] (≤0.003M), while increases when
[Co3+] exceeds a certain value (~0.003M). This reexpanding
transition of ss chain is similar to the redissolution observed
for DNA/polyelectrolyte aggregates and may be attributed to
the strong overcharging of ss chain by Co3+;59-65 see the
following subsection of “Ion binding and Overcharging”.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. S2c for N=72-nt, it is
notable that for [Co3+] ∈ [0.3mM, 0.01M], Ree (Ree/N) is
smaller than that of a neutral ss chain, which suggests a
like-charged attractive force among ss chain. The mechanism
for such intra-chain attraction will be illustrated in the section
of “Ion Size Effect”.

B. Ion Binding and Overcharging
1. General ion binding profiles
The above described macroscopic structural collapse is
coupled to the microscopic ion-binding properties. We
calculate the net charge distribution function Q(r) which
corresponds to the total net ion charges per nucleotide within
a distance r from the ss chain:

Q(r ) = ∫

<r

∑ α Zα d r ,

where Zα denotes the valence of

3

(4)

α ion species. As shown in

Figs. 2(d-f), Q(r) monotonically increases and tends toward 1
as r increases. When salt concentration is increased, the
stairlike behavior of Q(r) indicates more ions binding in the
vicinity of chains. Such enhanced ion-binding is attributed to
the lowered ion-binding penalty, and is responsible for the
ion-induced structural collapse of ss chain described above.
Also shown in Fig. 2, Q(r) for N=48-nt is (slightly) higher
than that for N=24-nt at the same ion conditions, i.e., each
nucleotide of longer chain induces more binding ions, which
is attributed to the stronger electric field in the vicinity of
longer chain.
2. Overcharging
Interestingly, in the ion-binding profiles Q(r) at high
[Na+] (~1M), [Mg2+] (~0.3M) and [Co3+] (≥0.03M), Q(r) can
be apparently larger than 1, which suggests that ss chain is

“overcharged” by Na+, Mg2+ and Co3+, i.e., the binding ions
are more than those can exactly neutralize the charges of a ss
chain. Previous studies have suggested the two basic
mechanisms responsible for overcharging: electrostatic
correlation and the combination of excluded volume
correlations and the electrostatic correlation.66,67 In the
present model, the salt ions are accounted for explicitly and
the predicted “overcharging” should be related to the explicit
ion properties (charge and size) which are ignored in the
mean-field approximation.
To distinguish the driving force for such overcharging,
we make the additional calculations by decreasing ion size
for Na+, Mg2+ and Co3+, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a,
the decrease of monovalent ion size can diminish/weaken the
degree of overcharging, and when the ion radii are equal to
0.5Å, the overcharging disappears. Thus, the overcharging by
Na+ should mainly come from the ion excluded volumes. As
suggested in previous studies for charged colloid system,66,67
the more bulky cations increase (decrease) the total ion
excluded volume (ion translational entropy), which decreases
the entropic penalty for the bulky ions binding to ss chain.66,67
Moreover, enlarging the ion size would reduce the formation
of cation-coion pairs and high-order ion clusters at high salt
concentrations68,69. For the case, even weak Coulomb
correlations can drive the ion binding to ss chain and lead to
the formation of a strongly correlated liquid along ss chain,

where the overcharged state is energetically favorable.66
However, excluded volume alone can never lead to notable
overcharging at low ion volume fraction, since in the limiting
case (uncharged nucleic acid and uncharged ions) coions and
counterions have the same radial distribution.66
As shown in Fig. 3b for 0.3M Mg2+, with the decrease of
ion size, the overcharging is only slightly weakened. Even for
the ion size of 0.5Å, Q(r) is still apparently larger than 1.
Therefore, the overcharging by divalent ions might be mainly
due to the ion Coulomb correlations. As suggested in
previous studies,59-61 ion Coulomb correlations allow ions to
self-organize to achieve low-energy state and consequently
stronger ion binding, which could cause the overcharging. In
addition, ion-exclusion-volume effect may also contribute to
the overcharging by Mg2+, which is responsible for the slight
weakening in overcharging as ion size decreases.
For 0.1M Co3+, Fig. 3c shows that the decrease of ion
size can enhance the overcharging, suggesting that the
overcharging by Co3+ should mainly come from the ion-ion
Coulomb correlations rather than ion-exclusion-volume
effect, as compared to the Na+ and Mg2+ salts. Our
predictions for the overcharging for the monovalent, divalent
and trivalent ion solutions are also in agreement with the
overcharging diagram for the planar electrical double layer
(EDL) through an integral equation theory.70 It shows that,
for the case of weak ion-charged wall Coulomb interactions
(similar to our Na+ instance), a decreasing behavior of the
number of adsorbed cations is predicted with the decrease of
the ion volume fraction, which, in turn implies overcharging
is dominated by ion excluded volume correlations, but the
former decreasing trend of the number of adsorbed cations
versus ion volume fraction is reversed for the case of strong
ion-charged wall Coulomb interactions (similar to our Co3+

instance) where Coulomb correlations dominate the
overcharging.
Due to the high ionic charge of Co3+, the strong
overcharging by Co3+ comes from the strong ion-ion
Coulomb correlations, and the Coulomb repulsion between
“overcharged” ss chain would contribute to the reexpansion
of ss chain at high [Co3+] as concerned above and suggested
in previous studies.59,71 Nonetheless, as shown in Fig. 2b, the
apparent reexpansion of ss chain is not observed where ss
chain is overcharged by Mg2+ at 0.3M [Mg2+]. When the
overcharging becomes stronger, i.e., [Mg2+] is increased to
~0.6M, the apparent reexpansion of ss chain can be observed
(for N=48-nt, Ree~70.1Å at 0.3M and ~73.7Å at 0.6M
[Mg2+]), which is consistent with Muthukumar el al.’s
prediction for polyelectrolyte gel that the chain swells again
when the overcharging occurs to a larger extent in divalent
salts.72 This is because, as discussed above, unlike Co3+, the
overcharging by Mg2+ results from both of the ion Coulomb
and ion-exclusion-volume correlations, while the
reexpansion of ss chain would rely strongly on the sufficient
overcharging by ion Coulomb correlations, e.g., >0.3M
[Mg2+].
In this work, the radii of cations and coions are taken as
the values estimated from experiments.54 The overcharging
of ss chain is related to coion size. The decrease of coion size
would weaken the degree of the overcharging (we have
examined the values of coion radii of 4.4Å, 3.5Å, 2.5Å and
1.0Å; data not shown). This is because smaller coions would
interact more strongly with cations to likely form
cation-coion pairs/clusters, thus could decrease the effective
charge of cations and consequently weaken the
overcharging.68

FIGURE 4 The end-to-end distance Ree of a 36-nt ss nucleic acid chain for monovalent and divalent salts. (a) The monovalent cation
radii of 2.7Å (dotted line), 1.8Å (dashed line) and 1.0Å (solid line). (b) The divalent ion cation radii of 3.6Å (dotted line), 2.3Å (dashed
line) and 1.0Å (solid line).

In this subsection, we examine the ion size effect on the
structural collapse of ss nucleic acid chain. In the calculations,
the radii of monovalent cations are varied from 2.7Å to 1.0Å
and the radii of divalent cations are varied from 3.6Å to 1.0Å.
As shown in Fig. 4, the ion concentration-dependence of Ree
shows qualitatively similar behaviors for ions with different
radii.
For monovalent ion solution, the decrease of ion size
causes the decrease of Ree and Ree becomes closer to that of
the neutral chain at 1M. This is because small ions have
stronger binding affinity and are more efficient in charge
neutralization. Such enhanced ion-binding by decreased ion
size is shown in Fig. S3a (in Supporting Information). At
high (1M) ion concentration, ss chain is overcharged, which
is mainly attributed to the bulky ion size and such
overcharging would disappear when monovalent ion sizes
become very small, as discussed above.
For divalent ions with different sizes, as shown in Fig. 4b,
Ree shows the similar ion-concentration dependence. For the
ion radii 3.6Å and 2.3Å, the chain is still less compact than a
neutral chain. But for ions with radii of 1.0Å, Ree can
(a)

decrease below the value of neutral chain when ion
concentration exceeds ~0.01M, which suggests an
intra-chain attractive force. The interesting phenomenon of
the intra-chain attractive force is related to the ion-bridge
configuration which has been suggested in experiments40 and
theory62, where cations orderly adsorb between approaching
negatively charged groups like London attraction force in
hydrogen molecule.73 To directly illustrate the microscopic
structure for the ion-bridge along chain, we present two
typical snapshots. As shown in Fig. 5a, at low divalent cation
concentration, only a small amount of ions condense on a ss
chain and the chain exhibits an extended state. At high ion
concentration (shown in Fig. 5b), on the other hand, much
more cations bind to the chain and the chain becomes a
relatively compact state. It is clearly shown that, along the
chain, many configurations of phosphate-ion-phosphate are
formed, and such ion-bridging-induced attractive force can
overcome the chain intrinsic stiffness to cause the state with
smaller compactness (Ree) than the random relaxation state.

D. Persistence Length lp versus [Na+] and [Mg2+]
1. Predicting Na+ and Mg2+-dependent persistence length
Based on the conformational ensemble of ss chain in
equilibrium, we calculate the ion-dependent persistence
length lp of ss nucleic acids of different lengths, since lp
quantitatively characterizes the flexibility of a ss chain.74-78
The persistence length can be estimated in different ways
based on the simulation data74-79. Here, the persistence length
lp was calculated as the projection length71,75,77

lp =

∑ < r1 ⋅ ri >,
b i =1

(5)

where b is the bond length and <….> denotes the ensemble

K

average. ri is the bond vector and Nm is the number of
monomers (there are Nm-1 bonds). Here, lp is approximated as
the average projection of the end-to-end vector for the
subchain from bond i to the last bond onto the direction of the
first bond.71,75,77 In addition, we also use another method to
estimate lp based on the worm-like model,78,80

where L=(Nm -1)*b is the contour length, and Rg is the radius
of gyration of ss chain. As shown in Fig. S4 (in Supporting
Information), the two methods (Eq. 5 and Eq. 6) give the
similar predictions.
Fig. 6 shows the predicted lp as a function of [Na+] and
[Mg2+] for ss nucleic acids of different chain lengths. When
ion concentration is increased, lp decreases from a high value
and converges to low value of ~8Å which is nearly
independent of chain length N. Fig. 6 also shows that longer
ss chain has larger lp at low ion concentration and the stronger
dependence on ion concentration. Higher ion concentration
leads to stronger ion-binding, causing the decrease of lp and
higher flexibility. At very high ion concentration, the chain
would get nearly full-neutralized, thus lp converges to a low
value which results from the intrinsic flexibility of ss nucleic
acid.81-84 From the trend of lp versus chain length N, we can
expect that lp’s will approach to the values of infinite-length
chain as N exceeds 120-nt.
2. Comparisons with experimental data
As shown in Fig. 6, the predicted lp’s are in reasonably good
agreement with the available experimental data for both of

Na+ and Mg2+ solutions and fall within the rather large range
from 6.4 to 65Å obtained by a number of different
experiments. Tinland et al. experimentally found lp’s of ss
calf thymus DNA to be around 8(±2.5)Å, 25.8(±4.2)Å, and
49.4(±15.5)Å at 0.1M, 0.01M and 0.001M [Na+]
respectively,81 which are in accordance with the predicted lp’s
(~11.5Å, 23.5Å and 45Å for 120-nt, respectively) except that
the measured value is slightly higher than our prediction at
0.001M [Na+]. Such slight discrepancy is because the chain
length in our calculations is finite (N≤120-nt) and the chain
length effect is strong only at low salt concentration.
Kuznetsov et al. used equilibrium DNA hairpin melting
profiles to obtain lp of 14Å for poly(dT) strands at 0.1M
[Na+],82 which is in good agreement with our value (~12Å for
120-nt). Mechanical stretching of ss λ-DNA gave lp around
8Å in a 0.15M [Na+] solution,83 which is also close to our
prediction (~10Å for 120-nt). Recently, the Na+-dependent
lp’s obtained through small-angle x-ray scattering by Pollack
et al. for dT40 are also close to our predictions except for
slight deviation of ~3Å.84 lp’s for a 20-bp RNA hairpin
measured by force spectroscopy method are in good
agreement with our predictions.85
In contrast to Na+ solutions, only few experiments were
performed to get lp in pure Mg2+ solutions. A mechanic study
found lp~6.7Å for denatured ss DNA at 0.05M [Mg2+].86
Rivettie et al. estimated lp~13Å for ~400-nt ss DNA in
0.002M [Mg2+] solution with 0.01M [Na+].87 These
experimental values are close to our values (lp~8.6Å at 0.05M
[Mg2+] and ~11.4Å at 0.002M [Mg2+] for 120-nt). Recently,
Pollack et al.78 obtained Mg2+-dependent lp’s for dT40 in a
0.02M Tris buffer. It is known that 0.01M of monovalent ions
can dissociate from 0.02M Tris buffer and can counteract the
efficient role of Mg2+.88 With the decrease of [Mg2+], the
experimental lp increases from 8Å at 0.05M [Mg2+]
(Mg2+-dominating case) to 19Å at 0.1mM [Mg2+]
(monovalent ion-dominating case). The lp’s at the Mg2+- and
monovalent ion-dominating cases agree with our values
(lp~8.3Å at 0.05M [Mg2+] and ~17.7Å at 0.01M [Na+] for
40-nt). Similarly, Ritort et al. recently measured
Mg2+-dependent lp’s of a 20-bp RNA hairpin in a 0.1M Tris
buffer.85 As [Mg2+] decreases from 0.01M to 0.01mM, lp
increases from ~7.5Å to ~15Å. The lp’s at the two limiting
cases also agree with our values (lp~9.2Å at 0.01M [Mg2+]
and lp ~12.3Å at 0.05M [Na+] for 40-nt). Certainly, the
overall quantitative comparisons with the experimental data
8

of Pollack et al.84 and Ritort et al.85 require the further
theoretical modeling for ss chain in mixed Na+/ Mg2+
solutions.
The deviations from different experiments reflect, to
some extent, the variation of persistence length values on
80

ionic strength, chain sequence, secondary structure and
experimental techniques. Overall, our results reasonably
agree with previous measurements that utilized different
techniques.

3. Na+ versus Mg2+ on lp
Besides the above described similar trend, lp shows
apparently weaker dependence on [Mg2+] than on [Na+] and
Mg2+ is more efficient in achieving the same lp than Na+. For
example, for a 48-nt chain, 0.01M Mg2+ and 0.3M Na+ can
achieve the same lp (~9.3Å). In addition, lp at high [Mg2+] is
slightly lower than that at high [Na+]. For example, lp~7Å at
0.3M Mg2+ is less than that lp~8Å at 1M Na+, which is in
accordance with the experiments (lp~8.4Å in 0.05M [Mg2+]
and lp~10.5Å in 0.5M [Na+])78. Such higher efficient role of
Mg2+ comes from the higher valence of Mg2+ than Na+ as
discussed above.
4. Empirical formulas for lp
From previous studies,81-87 the persistence length of
nucleic acid can come from two contributions: an intrinsic
0

contribution l p which results from the intrinsic rigidity of ss
chain and may be sequence-dependent, and an electrostatic
e

contribution l p which is due to electrostatic interaction and
is dependent strongly on the ion environment and chain
length81-87:

l p = l p0 + l pe .

(7)

Our calculations allow us to systematically calculate lp’s
of ss nucleic acids of different lengths for various [Na+] and
[Mg2+]. Based on the calculations, we can obtain the
following empirical expressions for lp

where [Na+] and [Mg2+] are in molar, and l p ~6Å for generic
(random) sequences. Our result of the lp~[Na+]0.5 for long
chain is consistent with the Barrat-Joanny theory
(lp~[Na+]-0.5) for flexible polyelectrolytes,89 while the
dependence on [Na+] is weaker than that from the
Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory (lp~[Na+]-1) for semiflexible
polyelectrolytes28,90. Furthermore, the salt-dependence
becomes weaker for shorter sequence. According to the
Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory and Barrat-Joanny theory,
where lp consists of an intrinsic contribution and a
contribution caused by electrostatic repulsion, lp of the
9

double-stranded DNA is nearly independent of ion
concentration at high monovalent salt.28,90 In contrast, a
theory proposed by Manning indicates that electrostatic and
nonelectrostatic persistence lengths are not additive, and the
dominant role in double-stranded DNA stiffness comes from
the electrostatic repulsion of DNA charges.91 At the
meanwhile, through the simulations, Savelyev et al.
predicted that a fine balance of electrostatic and elastic
effects on lp and favored Manning’s approach over
Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory at high monovalent salt for
double-stranded DNA.92,93 While for ss nucleic acid chain
studied here, lp decreases apparently with the increase of [Na+]
until 0.1M, and above 0.1M, lp continues to decrease slightly
until 1M. Moreover, lp of ss chain has a weaker ion
concentration-dependence than that of double-stranded DNA.
For convenience, following the previous works on ss nucleic
acid chain,60,71,78,81,84 we use the above functional forms (Eq.
8) to derive the empirical formulas for lp. As shown in Fig. 6,
the above expressions for lp give good fits to our predictions
and the available experimental data.81-87 Such parameterized
empirical formulas may be practically useful.18,81
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In the present work, we have employed the Motel Carlo
method to systematically and explicitly investigate ion
effects on the flexibility of single-stranded nucleic acids of
different lengths. The study covers the effects of ion
concentration, ion valence and ion size. The major findings
are in the following:
(i)
The addition of Na+ would induce ss chain to collapse
from an extend state at low [Na+] to a near-random
relaxation state at high [Na+] (~1M).
(ii)
Multivalent ions are more effective than Na+ in
inducing the structural collapse of ss chain, and small
divalent/trivalent ions can cause more compact state
than the random relaxation state.
(iii) At high ion concentration, ss nucleic acids can be
overcharged by Na+, Mg2+, and Co3+. The
overcharging in Na+ and in Co3+ solutions are
dominated by the ion-exclusion-volume effect and
ion-ion Coulomb correlations, respectively. For Mg2+,
both of ion-ion Coulomb correlation and ion excluded
volume contribute to the overcharging.
(iv)
Our predicted persistence lengths of ss nucleic acids
agree well with the available experimental data, and
we derive the empirical formulas for the persistence
length as a function of [Na+] and [Mg2+], and the
chain length.
Although the present work gives reasonable predictions
and the predicted persistence length agree with the available

experiment data, the present model also involves the
following important approximations.
First, in the work, the solvent (water) molecules are
implicitly approximated as the continuous medium with high
dielectric constant, since explicit solvent model would
involve huge computation complexity and limit the sampling
on chain conformational ensemble. Such approximation has
been validated in various previous calculations on salt effects
in nucleic acid thermodynamics.38,41
Second, the ss nucleic acid is modeled as a
coarse-grained chain with a virtual-bond model, since the
all-atom structural model is computationally too complex.
Such simplification is not a nonphysical approximation due
to the distribution of nucleic acid charges on its backbone and
the long-ranged nature of electrostatics, and the
simplification has been validated in describing hairpin
formation in ion solution.18 Moreover, the two potentials of
bond length and bond angle in our simulation are obtained by
Boltzmann inversion of the corresponding distribution
functions collected from PDB structures. Further adjustments
accounting for cross-correlations should be included for
retaining sufficient fidelity to the RNA fully atomistic
dynamics.58
Third, the ions are assumed to be hydrated and the effects
of ion dehydration and specific binding are ignored. For the
ss chain with moderate charge density on backbone, the ion
dehydration effect might be weak. Although the inner sphere
complexation between cations such as Mg2+ and
polynucleotide is weak,94 the ionic dehydration effect may
become important for the ion-binding near nucleic acid
surface at the high salt concentration. As shown above, the
overcharging of ss chain has an ion size-dependence (see Fig.
3). Thus, to take into account short-range hydration effect is
necessary in the future work on overcharging, referring to
all-atom molecule dynamic simulations and other more
accurate coarse-grained models. It is worth mentioning that
Savelyev and Papoian have proposed a coarse-grained
modeling method for short-range hydration effect. The
incorporation of such effect in modeling double-stranded
DNA in ion solutions has shown the accurate reproduction of
atomistic behavior of ions.58,95
Finally, the present structural model of ss chain ignores
the bases and thus cannot treat the sequence effects such as
base-pairing/stacking and self-stacking. Previous studies
have shown that, some specific sequences (e.g., poly (A) and
poly (C)) would exhibit strong self-stacking and can form ss
helices, while other most sequences (e.g., poly (U) and poly
(T), and generic ss DNA) behave like coils.1 Nevertheless,
the present work forms an important step towards a more
complete coarse-grained model to account for important
10

sequence effect which directs the nucleic acid folding,96-99
and is helpful for understanding the salt-dependent
macroscopic flexibility of single-stranded nucleic acids of
finite-length.
