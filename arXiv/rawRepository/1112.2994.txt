Abstract
Electrical signaling via voltage-gated ion channels depends upon the function of
the voltage sensor (VS), identified with the S1–S4 domain of voltage-gated K
channels. Here we investigate some physical aspects of the sliding-helix model of
the VS using simulations based on VS charges, linear dielectrics and whole-body
motion. Model electrostatics in voltage-clamped boundary conditions are solved
using a boundary element method. The statistical mechanical consequences of
the electrostatic configurational energy are computed to gain insight into the
sliding-helix mechanism and to predict experimentally measured ensemble properties such as gating charge displaced by an applied voltage. Those consequences
and ensemble properties are investigated for variations of: S4 configuration (αand 310 -helical), intrinsic counter-charges, protein polarizability, geometry of
the gating canal, screening of S4 charges by the baths, and protein charges located at the bath interfaces. We find that the sliding helix VS has an inherent
electrostatic stability and its function as a VS is robust in the parameter space
explored. Maximal charge displacement is limited by geometry, specifically the
range of movement where S4 charges and counter-charges overlap in the region
of weak dielectric. The steepness of charge rearrangement in the physiological voltage range is sensitive to the landscape of electrostatic energy: energy
differences of <2 kT have substantial consequences. Such variations of energy
landscape are produced by all variations of model features tested. The amount
of free energy per unit voltage that a sliding-helix VS can deliver to other parts
of the channel (conductance voltage sensitivity) is limited by both the maximal
displaced charge and the steepness of charge redistribution by voltage (sensor
voltage sensitivity).

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

Introduction
Electrical excitability of cells is possible because the movement of a few charges
can control the flow of many charges. This principle — amplification — led
Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) to their theory of the action potential in terms of
electrically controlled membrane conductances. Electrically controlled conductances have been localized to channel proteins conducting sodium, potassium or
calcium ions across the cell membrane. Voltage-controlled ionic conductances
and underlying intrinsic charge movements of ion channels have been studied
experimentally for many years (reviewed by Hille, 2001). Electrophysiology
has been complemented in more recent years by techniques measuring channel topology, channel structure and the change in channel function (reviewed by
Gandhi and Isacoff, 2002; Catterall, 2010). Together, these perspectives provide
a wealth of detailed information on the ‘voltage sensor’ (VS) common to these
channels and exemplified by the S1–S4 transmembrane domains of Shaker -type
K+ channels. Here we use computation to identify physical properties that are
important for voltage sensing, with a natural focus on electrostatic properties.
Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that only a limited number of amino acid residues of a voltage-dependent ion channel are individually
important for voltage sensitivity (Gandhi and Isacoff, 2002). To study VS electrostatics, we use models in which amino acids are not made explicit. Since
amino-acid residues with charged side-chains in S4 as well as S2 and S3 transmembrane segments strongly determine VS function (Papazian et al., 1995), we
explicitly represent those charges. These charged groups operate in vivo in an
environment composed of materials of diverse electrical polarizabilities. We distinguish three such materials in the model (membrane lipid, baths, and protein)
and describe electrical polarizabilities by dielectric coefficients that are uniform
within each region.
The electrostatic model constructed from point charges and piecewise uniform dielectrics is encapsulated by conductors clamped to imposed potentials
from external sources while external charge flow is monitored. Thus the model
is coupled to the macroscopic electrical setup of a ‘voltage clamp’ experiment.
The electrostatics of the system composed of the VS model and the electrode
setup is solved self-consistently. The configuration space of the model VS is
systematically sampled to construct a partition function based on electrostatic
configurational energy. Using this partition function, we compute ensemble expectations of observable random variables (e.g., of gating charge displaced at an
applied voltage). This way our theoretical results meet two criteria for practical
usefulness: they are consistent solutions of the physics included in the model,
and they directly pertain to macroscopic experimental results.
The purpose of our simulations is to elucidate how physical features of the
VS determine functional characteristics. To this end, we determine the consequences of varying electrostatic and geometrical parameters of VS models.

Model and boundary conditions
We test VS models in a simulated voltage clamp setup (Fig. 1, further geometrical information is given in Table 1). The simulation cell is represented by an
axial cross-section of the radially symmetric three-dimensional domain swept
by rotating that cross-section about its vertical axis. The external boundaries
(in green) are electrode surfaces kept at controlled electrical potentials. The
blue zones represent aqueous baths (with a dielectric coefficient w = 80). The
pink zone is a region of small dielectric coefficient (m = 2) that represents the
lipid membrane. The brown zone represents the region of the channel protein
that we model; this region is assigned a dielectric coefficient of p = 4 unless
noted otherwise. These dielectrics are piecewise uniform and therefore have
sharp boundaries (solid black lines). Point charges representing protein charges
of interest are embedded in the region of protein dielectric. Variation of their
placement is part of this study and will be detailed later. The protein region as
seen here represents the matrix of the S4 helix as a central cylinder, surrounded
by the other parts of the channel that create as well a dielectric environment
different from the dielectric environment of the membrane lipid. Included in the
‘protein’ region are the invaginations which allow the baths to extend into the
planes defining the lipid phase of the membrane. The radius of the S4 dielectric
matrix is 1 nm (α-helix) or 0.98 nm (310 -helix).
Point charges representing protein charges are arranged at a minimal distance of 0.2 nm from the protein/water boundary. The charged guanido group
of each arginine residue of the S4 segment is represented as three point charges
of 1/3 e0 on a circle of radius 0.122 nm (blue spheres in Fig. 2). The centers of
the S4 arginine charges are arranged on a helix defined by arginine side chains
on an α- or 310 -helix backbone, where every third amino acid is an arginine. For
the α-helix, charged residues are separated by 0.45 nm in the transmembrane
direction and 60◦ leftward around the helix; for the 310 -helix, charged residues
are separated by 0.6 nm and 0◦ .
Dimensions of the simulation surfaces are varied within those constraints as
defined in Table 1. Part A maps the topology of the protein and membrane
surface of Fig. 1 onto metrics for simulations, defined in part B of the table.
Since the surfaces in the system are radially symmetrical and smooth, the system
can be defined by a set of inflection points with their curvature on the left half of
the system to be simulated. When the gating canal is symmetrical, this reduces
further to the upper half of the left side. (As illustrated with Figs. 1A–C and
discussed later in “Results” under “Screening of VS charges”, these metrics apply
for “dilute” systems with electrodes far from the membrane surface, “infinitely
concentrated” systems with electrodes on the membranes, and asymmetrical
systems with a dilute side and a concentrated side.)
We analyze two degrees of freedom for VS charge movement: the curve on
which (triplets of) S4 charge centers are aligned can be both translated along
the helix axis and rotated about that axis. The model S4 charges thus move like
parts of a solid body. Negatively charged residues contributed by the S2 and S3
transmembrane segments of the natural VS are modeled as point charges of -1 e0

cylinder surrounded by a ring of protein material including the S1–S3 transmembrane
domains. The junction between these protein domains is narrowed to less than the
membrane thickness by circular invaginations (‘vestibules’) leading up to the ‘gating
canal’ through which the S4 helix glides through the rest of the protein (dashed line).

arranged on a curve parallel to the curve on which S4 charges are centered (red
spheres in Fig. 2); the offset from the helix axis of the counter-charge curve is
0.466 nm larger than the radius of the curve of the centers of the (triplets of) S4
charges (see Table 1). The axial and angular intervals between counter-charges
are chosen so that at most one S4 charge can exactly line up with any of the
three counter-charges (see legend of Fig. 2). Counter-charges are stationary in
their assigned positions.
We design the simulation to address physical questions with computational
efficiency. For instance, the electrodes encapsulating the simulation cell serve
three purposes:
1. The bath electrodes provide Dirichlet boundary conditions corresponding
to a voltage clamp. Our formulation of the electrostatics (described in the
next section) establishes these conditions.
2. The electrodes substitute for screening by bath ions of uncompensated
protein charge. Screening by the ions in an aqueous bath is equivalent
to the screening provided by charge on a metal foil placed in the water a
distance away from the protein boundary. According to the Debye-Hückel
theory approximation, an electrode distance of ≈0.8 nm corresponds to
physiological bath ionic strength. The electrode location shown in Fig. 1A
thus corresponds to a bath solution in the low millimolar range. An alternate configuration, a simulation cell with the bath regions omitted and
the electrodes placed directly on the membrane and protein boundaries
(Fig. 1C), establishes screening at the Onsager limit (approached at exceedingly large ionic strength). Results obtained with the two alternate
electrode placements allow us to examine the possible range of screening
effects at far smaller computational cost than the costs of a simulation
with explicit bath ions.
3. At the surface where the membrane region meets the cell boundary, a
set of guard electrodes forming rings around the cell maintain a graded
potential which varies between the potentials applied at the inner and
outer bath electrodes. These guard electrodes impose at the membrane
edge a potential similar to the potential existing in a macroscopic system
at a location far from the protein.
Translational and rotational motions of the S4 helix are simulated by allowing the ensemble of S4 charges to slide within the dielectric envelope provided
by the S4 matrix shown in Fig. 1. The protein dielectric itself does not accompany the movement of the charges. With the S4 dielectric matrix extended
far enough into the baths, keeping the S4 dielectric stationary has negligible
electrostatic consequences because the dielectric of the model is uniform within
the S4 matrix. Simulating S4 motion this way reduces computational effort of
model exploration by several orders of magnitude.
A simulation setup as shown in Fig. 1 tests a single VS that is not interacting
with other parts of the channel protein, in particular the parts mediating the

gating of the conductive pore. This model VS thus operates as an ‘idling’
transducer of electrical force. The forces acting between a VS and other parts
of the natural channel are not known. The reactions of model voltage-sensors
to such forces can be explored by simulations which include hypothesized force
fields in addition to the electrostatic force field. Characteristics of the ‘load’
acting on the actual VS may be inferred in this manner. However, here we
report simulations of the idle VS.

Methods
Electrostatics
We are concerned with electrostatic interactions among charged groups of the
VS protein, electrode charges and charges induced on sharp dielectric boundaries. In solving the electrostatics we take advantage of the fact that all other
charges besides the point charges of the protein are distributed on a few boundary surfaces rather than distributed throughout a volume. The primary task of
calculating electrostatic interactions consists in determining the charge distributions on the electrode and dielectric boundaries, distributions which are initially
unknown for a given configuration of protein charges and applied voltage.
Computation of unknown charges
Boda et al. (2006) have described and tested a boundary element method (Induced Charge Calculation, ICC) for computing the charge distribution on the
dielectric boundaries of a system consisting of point charges and linear isotropic
dielectrics with sharp boundaries. We include as additional electrostatic element
the ‘electrode’. This element is an infinitesimally thin conductive foil charged
to a prescribed electric potential using an external source. In our system, this
surface is also a dielectric boundary between the simulation cell and the dielectric surrounding the cell (e.g., vacuum). Thus the charge of an electrode is in
part induced charge (as in Boda et al.) and source charge (to fix the prescribed
potential). In the following we show how the total electrode charge can be calculated without needing to separately calculate its parts. The electrode charge
calculation complements the induced charge calculation, making it possible to
calculate all the initially unknown charges in the system.
The spatial density of source charge ρsrc in our system is composed of the
point source charges qksrc of the VS protein located at positions rk and source
charge distributed on the electrodes E with surface density σ src (r ∈ E).
The polarization charge density induced at any location r in a dielectric is
ρind (r) =

∇ (r)
1 −  (r) src
ρ (r) − 0
· E (r)
 (r)
 (r)

(1)

where  is the generally location-dependent dielectric coefficient, 0 the permittivity of the vacuum, and E the electric field strength produced by all (source
and induced) charges in the system. This relation follows from Poisson’s equation (including polarization) and the constitutive relation describing polarization in a linear, isotropic dielectric (Boda et al., 2006). The first term on the
right-hand side of Eq. 1 describes the charge induced on the surfaces of the
volume element at r if the element contains source charge. The second term describes charge induced in the volume element by the electric field if the dielectric
coefficient at r has a non-zero gradient.
For our charge calculations, we combine collocated source and induced charges
into an effective charge for computing the field and potential. The effective
8

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

charge density associated with a known source charge density ρsrc (r) embedded
in a dielectric (described by a locally uniform  (r)) is:
ρeff (r) =

ρsrc (r)
 (r)

(2)

The effective charge density of an electrode includes both contributions to induced charge described by Eq. 1, as well as the source charge.
The dielectric boundaries B inside the simulation cell (marked in black in
Fig. 1) do not carry source charge. However, the electric field in the simulation
cell induces the charge density σ ind (r) at locations r ∈ B. This induced charge
density is initially unknown.
The field strength E and potential V in our system are produced by the
superposition of the fields and potentials of the source and induced charges:

where r is any location on the surface B, ∆ (r) is the change of dielectric
coefficient in the normal direction n (r) of the dielectric boundary, and ¯ (r) is
the mean of the dielectric coefficients at the boundary location.
The potential at any location r on the electrode surfaces E has a value
V VC (r) imposed by the voltage clamp:
V (r) = V VC (r)

(6)

Inserting the expression for the electric field strength from Eq. 3 into Eq. 5 and
inserting the expression for the electric potential from Eq. 4 into Eq. 6 yields two
integral equations in terms of both σ ind (r ∈ B) and σ eff (r ∈ E). The initially
unknown charge densities of the dielectric and electrode boundaries are the joint
solution of these two integral equations.
To solve the integral equations we follow the method of Boda et al. (2006).
The surfaces B and E are subdivided into curved surface elements. The unknown
9

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

charge densities are approximated as uniform within each surface element. The
two integral equations then become one system of linear equations in terms of the
unknown charge densities of a finite number of surface elements. The accuracy
of this approximation is verified by comparing the numerical solution of the
discretized integral equations with the analytical result of the integral equations
(which is possible for certain geometries) or by verifying Gauss’s theorem for
any specific geometry of interest. Examples for the test by Gauss’s theorem are
included in Supplementary Materials. This test based on Gauss’s theorem was
applied for each specific simulation.
The inhomogeneity of surface charge in our simulation is greatest where point
charges of the VS protein are close to a dielectric boundary or electrode. For
computational efficiency, we vary the size of the surface subdivisions depending
on the distance from the point charges. A typical surface grid (comprising ≈6000
surface elements) is shown in Fig. 2 for the dielectric surfaces in the simulation
cell. The electrode surfaces (not included in Fig. 2) are subdivided into ≈1200
relatively large elements because of their distance from point charges.
The computation of the unknown charges of the surface elements involves
solving a linear equation system in terms of as many unknowns (N ) as there are
surface elements. The coefficient matrix of this system is dense, therefore LUdecomposition time increases with O N 3 . This computational disadvantage is
greatly alleviated by the fact that LU -decomposition of the coefficient matrix
needs to be done only once for a given combination of surface geometry and
dielectric coefficients. When the S4 charges are moved, solutions to this system
of equations are obtained
by back-substitution using the same LU-decomposed

matrix. That O N 2 operation, back-substitution, is required for each sampled
configuration of VS charges, but not for each applied voltage tested, as described
later.
Computation of charge displacement and electrostatic energy
When the charges of the VS change position, the electric flux toward one bath
electrode generally increases by the same amount as the electric flux decreases
toward the other bath electrode. To maintain a constant voltage between the
two electrodes, charge has to be moved externally between the electrodes. This
charge is the experimentally measured displaced gating charge. In principle, one
can measure displaced charge in a simulation by monitoring electric flux across a
surface surrounding a bath electrode. A more efficient method is provided by the
Ramo-Shockley (RS) theorem (Shockley, 1938; Ramo, 1939); for an application
to ion channels see (Nonner et al., 2004)). The RS theorem lays the groundwork
as well for an efficient method of computing the electrostatic energy of VS
configurations when the applied voltage is varied (He, 2001). The RS theorem
is applicable to systems containing linear dielectrics.
The RS theorem can be formulated for the configuration of electrode potentials in this study. We apply equal and opposite potentials Vm /2 and −Vm /2
to the internal and external bath electrodes to create a membrane voltage Vm
(defined as internal minus external potential). This method of applying a mem10

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

brane potential maintains global electroneutrality of the simulation system. We
determine the displaced charge in a simulation in two steps:
1. Set all point charges to zero and apply +1/2 volt at the internal and -1/2
volt at the external bath electrode. Solve for the unknown electrode and
induced boundary charges. From the electric potential V0 (r) produced
by these charges, an ‘electrical distance’ can be computed as the ratio
[V0 (r)] / [1 volt] for any geometrical location r in the simulation cell.
2. For a simulation run with the actual point charges qk present and actual potentials Vm /2 and −Vm /2 applied at the electrodes, determine the
displaced charge Qk from the relation:
V0 (rk )
(7)
1 volt
with the electrical distance computed as described in step 1. When several
point charges are in the simulation, total displaced charge is the algebraic
sum of the displaced charges defined by Eq. 7 for each point charge:
X
Q=
Qk
(8)
Qk = qk

k

Step 1 is executed once for the chosen configuration of electrodes and dielectrics
in the simulation (including dielectric coefficients). Step 2 is executed once
for each varied configuration (or number) of point charges for which displaced
charge is determined. Since the displaced charge determined in step 2 is invariant with respect to the potentials applied at the electrodes, it does not need be
re-calculated for the same point-charge configuration when electrode potential
is varied.
Note that the electrical distance obtained with the equal and opposite electrode potentials varies between -1/2 and +1/2 as the point charge is moved from
the internal to the external bath electrode. The electrical distance zero corresponds to geometrical locations where the point charge induces equal amounts
of charge on either bath electrode.
The RS theorem also makes it possible to compute the electrostatic energy
in an efficient two-step procedure (He, 2001):
1. In the full simulation system (including the point charges), impose the
potential VE = 0 on all electrodes. Calculate the electrostatic interaction
energy W1 in the system with the point charges qk at positions rk from
the relation:
1X
W1 =
qk V VE =0 (rk )
(9)

k

where V is computed with Eq. 4.
2. Calculate the displaced charge Q corresponding to the point charges and
their positions using Eq. 8. For the imposed voltage Vm , calculate:
W2 = −QVm
11

(10)

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

Step 1 of this procedure is executed once for each sampled location of the point
charges. Step 2 is executed repeatedly for each applied voltage that is tested.
The electrostatic configurational energy in the simulation with the applied voltage Vm is the algebraic sum of the energies calculated in steps 1 and 2:
W =

1X
qk V VE =0 (rk ) − QVm
2

(11)

k

Using the RS theorem in these secondary calculations greatly increases computational efficiency of simulations. This is the basis for our systematic explorations
of models.
The calculation of displaced charge and electrostatic energy via Eqs. 8 and
11 are independently verified by computing the electrostatic work through a
second route. We alternatively compute the work from the path integral of the
electric force acting on the charges qk of the VS as those charges move from r0k
to r00k :

∆W =

Here, the electric field is the field of all charges in the system, including the
electrode charges provided by the external source that maintains the electrode
potentials as VS charges move along their paths. An example of this control
(showing consistency) is given in Supplementary Materials (Fig. S2).

Statistical mechanics
Displaced gating charge is experimentally measured from ensembles of channels
and thus is an ensemble average. Our electrostatic calculations yield both the
displaced charge and the electrostatic part of the configurational energy for a
given configuration of a simulated VS model. We consider whole-body movements of S4 charge in two degrees of freedom: translation along the S4 axis and
rotation about that axis. Our computational method is efficient enough to allow
systematic sampling of this configuration space. We represent each dimension
by 51 equally spaced grid nodes and compute the electrostatic energy for the
2601 nodes of the two-dimensional space.
The energy samples define a canonical partition function describing the consequences of the electrostatics on the distribution of an ensemble in the discretized configuration space:

where i and j are the indices of the rotational and translational discrete positions; Wij is the electrostatic configurational energy of the voltage sensor at
translational position i and rotational position j; kB is the Boltzmann constant;
and T = 298.15 K is the absolute temperature. The sampled rotational range
is 360◦ , and a typical translational range is -1.925 nm to +1.925 nm relative to

the ends of the chosen translational range have very small probabilities due to
their large electrostatic energy.

One example of a random variable of interest is the charge displaced at an

can be predicted for direct comparison with experimental observation of that
relation.

One tests the computation of charge induced by the VS charges on the boundary of the protein dielectric and is based on Gauss’s law. The other tests the
computation of electrostatic energy by an independent method (by integrating
force along a given S4 path).
Figs. S3 through S6 and the associated animations (Animations S1–S4 respectively) illustrate VS geometry or movement in four simulations presented
in this paper. They show the mean position(s) of VS charges superimposed to
the distribution of charge density in the microscopic system. In the animations,
voltage is changed in a ramp from -100 to +100 mV.

Results and Discussion
The relation between the displaced gating charge and the applied membrane potential in a sliding-helix model of an individual VS domain is shown in Fig. 3A.
The solid line represents the computed relation. Symbols reproduce the relation experimentally observed in ShakerB potassium channels (Seoh et al., 1996,
Fig. 2A) — the experimental charge per channel was divided by the number of
channel monomers, 4. Three observations can be made by comparing the two
relations: (1) the total amounts of charge that can be moved by large changes
of voltage are similar, ≈3 elementary charges per VS domain; (2) the slopes of
the two relations are similar, but not equal; (3) a shift along the voltage axis is
needed to align the midpoint of the computed relation to the midpoint of the
experimental relation (dotted line).
The VS charges in the simulation for Fig. 3A are arranged according to
an α-helical geometry (Figs. 2 & S3). An analogous simulation in which the
VS charges conform to a 310 -helical geometry (Fig. S4) yields a different result
(Fig. 3B). With regard to the experimental charge/voltage relation, the 310
model yields less total charge movement over the tested voltage range and a
smaller maximum slope.
The model parameters giving the charge/voltage relation in Fig. 3A are the
initial reasonable choices/guesses made in this study as a basis for comparison,
except for the spacing of counter-charges which was chosen from three variations made of the α-helical S4 model. The spacing used prevents S4 charges from
simultaneously aligning with more than one counter-charge within the average
range of travel (Fig. 3, legend). The counter-charges in the 310 -helical model of
Fig. 3B were arranged using the same rule of spacing between counter-charges.
No attempt is made at this stage to find counter-charge positions giving potentially more realistic charge/voltage relations for the 310 -helical model.
In the following, we use the models of Fig. 3 as ‘standard’ models that are
altered to explore sensitivity to variation of physical or geometrical parameters. The primary questions we address are: (1) Which parameters are more
(or less) important for gating charge displacement? (2) In which ways are these
parameters important for a sliding helix mechanism? Our simulations with varied parameters reveal model designs that predict experimental relations between
charge displaced and voltage more closely than does the standard model used for
Fig. 3A. However to make comparisons of experimental and simulated relations,
at least three caveats need to be considered:
1. Experimental gating charge is measured using a ‘P/n’ protocol (Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1977) by which linear charge displacement is eliminated from the record to uncover non-linear charge displacement presumably associated with VS motion. If a P/n protocol measures ‘linear’ charge
displacement between voltages at which VS charge displacements are not
equal, the protocol eliminates displacement associated with the VS itself
(scaled by the factor n). The theoretical charge/voltage relations shown
here comprise all displaced charge. For an accurate comparison to ex-

periment, these relations would have to be subjected to the specific P/n
subtraction procedure used in the experiment. The unsubtracted relations that we present contain the information needed to decide where a
P/n subtraction procedure would eliminate actual gating charge (e.g., the
simulation results of Fig. 3B).
2. Theoretical charge displacement is associated with a known geometrical
position of the VS charges. Experimental charge displacement is not referenced to a known geometrical position. To compare with theory, we
assign the experimental charge displacement a reference midway between
zero and the charge measured at the largest tested depolarization. In interpreting experiments, that is an arbitrary choice to be made for each
version of natural or engineered channel. We represent the simulated
charge displacement as relative to the electrical distance 0 as defined in
Methods. In the case of the models for Fig. 3, this electrical distance
coincides with the geometrical translation z = 0 because of the symmetry
of the dielectrics.
3. The VS domain in the simulation operates under different conditions from
the VS domains in a full channel. The model transduces voltage changes
solely into changes of position of the VS. The VS domains integrated into
a channel also transduce voltage changes into action on other domains
controlling ion flow in the central pore. A shift along the voltage axis (as
suggested by Fig. 3) is one possible way in which a ‘load’ may be reflected
in the charge/voltage relation of the VS.
The simulations reported in Fig. 3 indicate that voltage sensing by a sliding
helix is robust from an engineering point of view. Either the α- or 310 -helical
S4 structure can produce voltage-dependent charge displacement, even though
the structures lead to distinct configurations of the charges. The two forms of
helix generate different voltage sensitivities in the tested models – but neither
form produces catastrophic failure.
The simulated VS models we use have been reduced to a simple geometry
and to the electrostatic interactions of point charges and linear dielectrics. Since
those models can produce more-or-less realistic behavior, important insights
into the VS system may be possible by the rigorous analysis of a few crucial
components in a reduced model. A reduced model allows physical features to
be changed in an orthogonal and systematic manner. The variations presented
in this paper all start from the two ‘standard’ models introduced in this section.
A key variable for analyzing change is the configurational energy arising from
the electrostatics.

Energetics of sliding-helix models
The mobile charges of the VS model are within the electric field of the charges
on the electrodes, of the stationary counter-charges, and of the charges induced
in the dielectrics. The charges of the S4 helix are modeled as parts of a solid
16

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

body. We consider two degrees of freedom of solid-body motion: translation
along the S4 axis and rotation about that axis. Energy is computed on a grid
composed over this configuration space (Eq. 11). From the electrostatic energy
map, a partition function is constructed (Eq. 13), and from the partition function, statistics of random variables (Eq. 15) are predicted. The energy map
thus defines the expectations of observables such as the gating charge displacement (Fig. 3). The random variables computed on this basis do not involve
approximations based on interpreting energy maps in terms of equilibrium and
transition states (Lecar et al., 2003).
Pseudo-color maps of energy in the two dimensions computed for applied
voltages of 0 and -100 mV are shown in Fig. 4. The translational and rotational
origin corresponds to the central S4 position shown in Fig. 2 for the α-helix.
Energy is presented as relative to that at the origin. The symmetry of these
models implies that the map for +100 mV (not shown) is a mirror image of the
map for -100 mV.
For a membrane potential of 0 mV, the energy maps of both helical models
reveal a trough bounded on all sides by regions of substantially higher energy.
The energy trough runs in the direction of proportional translation and rotation for the α-helical S4 model, but it runs in the direction of simple translation
for the 310 -helical S4 model. The trough in the map of each model follows
the counter-charge arrangement — an arrangement chosen for each model to
allow periodic interactions during S4 motion of the S4 charges with the countercharges. In the α-helical model, the S4 charges and counter-charges are aligned
on parallel super-helices, whereas in the 310 -helical model the S4 charges and
counter-charges follow straight lines parallel to the helical axis. Lowest electrostatic energies of the α-helical S4 trace the path of a screw, whereas energies of
the 310 -helical S4 trace the path of a piston.
The regions outside the energy trough for the 310 -helix have energies about
three times as large as those of the α-helix. The electrostatic confinement of
the 310 -helix is stronger than that of the α-helix. The strength of confinement
correlates inversely with the separation of charges in the two geometries. The
cluster of S4 charges and counter-charges is more spread out in space in the αhelical than in the 310 -helical geometry due to the angular separations of charges
in the α-helical S4.
The electrostatic energy trough tends to anchor the sliding helix in a transmembrane configuration. The S4 charges that dwell in a given configuration in
the region of small polarizability are balanced in the model by counter-charges
located in that region. This balance is maintained over the range of S4 travel
where equivalent amounts of S4 charge and counter-charge overlap in the region
of weak dielectric (see Fig. S3 and Animation S1). A second essential element
of balance concerns the transit of S4 charges between the less polarizable gating
canal region, and the more strongly polarizable vestibule and bath regions. Any
energy change associated with the transit of an S4 charge on one side is balanced
on the other side by the opposite transit of an S4 charge. On the other hand,
the energy trough generated by the electrostatics of the models is too shallow
by itself to ensure long-term stability of the S4 configuration. Stabilizing inter17

Figure 5: Energetic consequences of the counter-charges. Translational energy profile
of the α-helical model of Fig. 3A with counter-charges present (dashed line) or deleted
(solid line); p = 4. The dotted curve is computed with counter-charges deleted and
p = 16

actions beyond those included in the model (such as interactions provided by
the linkers to adjacent transmembrane segments) are most likely necessary for
long-term stability.
To inspect the energetics more closely, we construct a one-dimensional energy profile for S4 translation by computing for each translational position the
expectation of the electrostatic energy (in the rotational degree of freedom using
the rotational partition function, Eq. 16). We refer to this kind of energy profile
as a ‘translational energy profile’ for short. Fig. 4E,F show the translational
energy profiles for two applied voltages: 0 mV (solid lines) and -100 mV (dashed
lines). The profiles at 0 mV are quite uniform over the translational extent of
the energy trough. At a membrane voltage of -100 mV, the energy profiles are
tilted in favor of more intracellular positions. A well-defined energy minimum is
found at a position about -1 nm inward from the central position of the α-helical
S4, whereas a broad minimum spread between -0.7 and -1.2 nm is found with
the 310 -helical S4.
The energy profiles in Fig. 4 do not resemble the profile of an ion embedded
in a lipid membrane — the latter profile has a high barrier in the center of the
weak dielectric (Parsegian, 1969; Neumcke and Läuger, 1969). Instead, in the
models the charged section of the S4 helix can travel with an almost level energy
over the range of translation where S4 charges overlap with stationary countercharges. To examine the contribution of the counter-charges to this result,
we re-compute the energy profile for the α-helical S4 with the counter-charges
deleted from the model (Fig. 5). Deletion of the counter-charges converts the
energy trough seen with the standard model (dashed line) into a broad barrier
(solid line). That barrier is reduced but not inverted by increasing the VS
19

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

dielectric coefficient p from 4 to 16 (dotted line). For comparison, a slidinghelix model without counter-charges using p = 10 has been analyzed previously
by Grabe et al. (2004).
Over the range of translation where the counter-charges produce an energy
trough (long-dashed line), the deletion of the counter-charges (solid line) has a
rather small effect (note that we plot energy as relative to the central position).
Movement of the S4 helix encounters little energy variation in this region of
translation because the amount of S4 charge present in the domain of weak
dielectric does not vary: as S4 charge enters on one side, S4 charge leaves on
the other side. The energetics are not favorable for these S4 positions (as the
charges are not balanced), but they are rather uniformly unfavorable until S4
translation exceeds a distance of about 1 nm from its center position. If the
travel of the S4 helix is restricted to ±1 nm in a biological channel by means
other than the counter-charges deleted here, then even an S4 without balancing
counter-charges could perform as a voltage sensor.
The variations of energy are small over the traveled range of translation in
Fig. 4E,F. The restriction in the model that the S4 domain and its charges must
move as a single solid body might be expected to ‘synchronize’ periodic interactions among charges and counter-charges, leading the energetics to express
several distinct barriers and wells. The chosen spacing of the counter-charges,
however, is enough to prevent the emergence of such a pattern. Additional
degrees of freedom are thus not a prerequisite for smooth S4 travel (examples
of such degrees of freedom are the possible flexibility of the individual chargebearing S4 residues or changes in configuration of the helix between the α and
310 forms, Long et al., 2007; Khalili-Araghi et al., 2010; Bjelkmar et al., 2009;
Schwaiger et al., 2011),
Although the energy profiles of the two helix forms are similar, the small
differences between them are sufficient to produce substantial differences in the
relations between charge displacement and voltage (Fig. 3). Simulation results
with varied electrostatic parameters presented in the following reveal a number
of ways that VS characteristics may be tuned. Because small energy variations
control VS behavior, variations in numerous other characteristics of the channel
protein might achieve such tuning.

Voltage sensitivity
Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) discovered “the extreme steepness of the relation
between ionic conductance and membrane potential”. They attached physical
significance to this steepness by supposing that the ion flow is controlled by
the distribution of a charged particle that “may rest either on the inside or the
outside of the membrane but is present in negligible concentrations elsewhere.”
Using Boltzmann’s principle, they derived a relation between conductance and
voltage in which steepness is determined by the valency z of the charged particle. The ‘effective valency’ z has been used ever since to empirically quantify
the voltage sensitivity expressed in the relations between voltage and ionic conductance, as well as the relations between voltage and displaced gating charge.

Figure 6: Voltage dependence of free energy. Free energy (Eq. 17) for: α-helix model
(solid line), 310 -helix model (long-dashed line) and two-state analytic Boltzmann model
with z = 3 (dotted line). All free energies are relative to the energy at V = 0.

The effective valency is model dependent because its physical meaning is
defined through the two-state model. The physical meaning of this effective
valency is not clear if any other mechanism is at work. Since we study a range
of models, a more general definition of voltage sensitivity is needed.
The essence of a voltage sensor is that it derives a change in free energy
from an external electrical field, a change which can then drive other processes
requiring an increase in free energy in other parts of the channel, such as gating.
Therefore to generalize voltage sensitivity, we consider the relation between free
energy and applied voltage in our models. Since we simulate a canonical system,
the free energy in our case is the Helmholtz energy A as defined by Eq. 17.
Fig. 6 shows the free-energy/voltage relations for our standard α-helical VS
model (solid line), our standard 310 -helical model (long-dashed line), and the
analytically derived relation for the Hodgkin and Huxley two-state VS model
using z = 3 (dotted line). The plotted free energies are relative to the free
energy applying to V = 0. In all cases, increasing the absolute value of the
voltage reduces the free energy of the VS system, but the 310 -helical model
responds less steeply to voltage than the other models. The α-helical and twostate models produce quite similar changes in free energy.
Applied voltage reduces the free energy of the VS system because states of
lower electrostatic energy become available. The free energy does not follow
exactly the variation of the expectation of configurational energy (not shown),
because the free energy includes both the configurational energy and an entropy
term due to the redistribution of the voltage sensor in the configuration space.
In microscopic systems like the VS, the entropy contribution to free energy is
substantial.
It is important to note that the reduction of free energy with applied voltage
21

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

becomes steeper toward voltages where charge displacement (Fig. 3) becomes
less steep or saturates. Voltage sensitivity as defined by the slope of the freeenergy/voltage relation is then a function over the membrane potential and not
just a singular number. This sensitivity is smallest near zero voltage where the
charge displaced varies most steeply for these models. Thus the free energy drop
due to applied voltage is small where most of the energy received by the VS is
used for re-distributing the S4 helix among possible translations. As the redistribution saturates, free energy approaches a linear relationship with voltage
(as does the energy) because the electrical potential at which the S4 charges
are located varies linearly with applied voltage. Free energy thus varies the
most where charge redistribution is minimal. The asymptotic slopes of the freeenergy/voltage relation are determined by the maximal gating charges that can
be displaced in either direction from the translation corresponding to electrical
position zero.
These observations on free energy/voltage relations show that it is not the
movement itself of the S4 helix that produces the free energy picked up by the
VS. Actually, the free energy is determined by the increase in the electrical field
acting on the S4 charges that have reached nearly saturated positions. Thus the
usefulness of the VS ‘muscle’ is chiefly in isometric work or against a workload
requiring a large membrane voltage to overcome. The relations shown in Fig. 6
describe the idle VS with no work done on other parts of the channel. The
change in free energy due to applied voltage is thus an upper limit for the free
energy available to other parts of the channel.
Since the physiological voltage range is smaller than the range simulated in
Fig. 6, the ‘sluggish’ redistribution of VS charge of the 310 -helical model causes
a severe limitation in the amount of work that can be delivered by this sensor. This limitation occurs despite the fact that the electrostatic energy trough
(Fig. 4F) in principle allows a range of S4 play comparable to that in the α-helical
model (Fig. 4E). The full work corresponding to the total gating charge that the
310 -helical S4 can produce at extreme voltages cannot be delivered within the
physiological voltage range because the gating charge is not rearranged within
a narrow interval of voltage.
In the simulation studies that follow, the total charge moved is a more robust
property than the swift redistribution of gating charge in response to voltage,
which is a property more sensitive to variation in many our model parameters. Both aspects limiting voltage sensitivity, the total gating charge and the
steepness of charge re-distribution, are readily recognized in the experimentally observable charge voltage relation, provided that the experimental charge
per VS is determined. Therefore we will discuss parameter variations using
charge/voltage relations rather than free-energy/voltage relations.

Polarizability of the protein
The dielectric coefficient p assigned to the VS in our models parameterizes the
polarizability of a protein, and thus implicitly describes re-adjustments of electrons, atoms and groups of atoms in response to S4 movement. The dielectric
22

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

coefficient implies a large number of internal degrees of freedom beyond the two
degrees of freedom in whole-body motion sampled explicitly. It is important
therefore to determine how much electrical polarization can contribute to shaping VS characteristics. We assess the consequences of polarization for model
behavior by varying p over a range of values used in other theoretical studies of
proteins (reviewed by Schutz and Warshel, 2001) without concerning ourselves
with the physics underlying polarization in the VS. Our computations give consistent solutions for a system with piecewise homogeneous linear dielectrics and
include appropriate boundary conditions.
A large dielectric coefficient p reduces the effective charges of the VS (Eq. 2),
the field produced by the effective charges inside the protein (Eq. 3), and thus
the charge induced on the protein boundary (Eq. 5). A large p weakens the local
interactions of S4 charges with counter-charges and induced charges, flattening
the energy landscape for S4 movement.
Using the α-helical S4 model of Figs. 3A, 4A,C, the translational energy
profiles are computed with varied protein dielectric coefficients p (Fig. 7A).
The profiles of the dominant energy trough become flatter as p is stepwise
increased from 2 to 16. Even with p = 2, translational energy in the trough
varies by no more than 0.05 eV (≈2 kT).
As described earlier, moderate variations in energy profile significantly alter
the charge/voltage relation (Fig. 7B). The steepness of charge re-arrangement
is reduced as p is increased. Asymptotic behavior changes from approximately
exponential toward hyperbolic.
All simulations for Fig. 7 use the same dielectric geometry, protein charges
and counter-charges in the model. Nevertheless, the ‘effective gating charge’ of
the VS as assessed by the steepness at the midpoint of the charge/voltage curve
increases as the protein dielectric coefficient is reduced. The energetic basis for
this effect of the dielectric coefficient is evident in Fig. 7A. With a dielectric
coefficient of 2, there are two distinct energy minima at translations of ±1 nm.
With a dielectric coefficient of 16, however, there is very little energy variation
among the positions within the energy trough (in the absence of an applied
voltage).
The distribution of S4 translational positions varies between two extremes:
one, a discrete distribution commonly called a ‘two-state Boltzmann distribution’; the other, a continuous distribution within a space of uniform potential
energy. For a graphical representation of these differences in distribution, see the
discrete distribution of charge in the Animation S1 with  = 4 and the continuous distribution in Animation S3 with  = 16. For the extremes of the discrete
and continuous distributions, the midpoint slopes of charge/voltage curves are
analytically known. The midpoint slope of the charge/voltage curve is three
times greater for the two-state case than for the uniform-energy case (Neumcke
et al., 1978). Thus, the same structural charges produce up to a three-fold varying ‘effective gating charge’ as the protein dielectric coefficient (and therefore
the potential energy landscape) is varied. Furthermore, the analytical asymp-

totes are exponential for the two-state energy profile, but hyperbolic in voltage
for the flat energy profile.
Published theoretical studies of the VS used p = 15 (Lecar et al., 2003) or
p = 10 (Grabe et al., 2004)). In our simulations, protein dielectric coefficients
from 2 to 16 have small effects on the translational energy profile. The profile
is dominated by an energy trough that allows for the translation range where
the intrinsic counter-charges of the VS overlap with an equivalent number of S4
charges. This trough is in fact deeper for smaller values of p than for larger
values (Fig. 7A). With charge balance established inside the region of weak
dielectric, charges induced on the aqueous boundaries of the dielectric are small
and their interaction with S4 charges does not dominate the translational energy
profile.
In a 310 -helical model using p = 4 (Figs. 3B and 4F), a slightly V-shaped
energy profile produces an even smaller voltage sensitivity than that seen in the
α-helical model using p = 16 (Fig. 7B). The 310 -helical model in the presented
form has difficulty producing steep charge/voltage relations like those observed
in biological channels. On the other hand, the energetic differences determining
slope are small, so that the seemingly unfavorable characteristics of the 310 helical S4 might be overcome in numerous ways in biological channels.
The simulations with varied polarizability also give information regarding the
physical origin of the energy minima seen at the ends of the range of travel of the
α-helical model and the small upward step in electrostatic energy seen in these
positions for the 310 -helical model. It is important to note that the shown energy
profiles are relative to those in the center position of these helices – these are
not the absolute energies associated with assembling the system (which are not
shown). In absolute terms, electrostatic energies increase as protein dielectric
coefficient is reduced. The energy wells seen in profiles associated with small
polarizability reflect a smaller increase of electrostatic energy in some positions.
These wells (and the upward steps found near the ends of the energy trough for
the 310 -helical model, Fig. 4F) are a collective result of the entire charge cluster
in the VS interacting with induced charge on the protein boundary. The more
dense cluster of the 310 -helical model has stronger interactions among charges
and counter-charges, and with the charges induced on the protein dielectric,
than does the more spread-out (in the angular dimension) cluster of charges in
the α-helical model. The difference is strongest in the extreme allowed positions
of S4 travel, when a maximal number of S4 charges is located in either one of
the aqueous phases near the protein boundary.
These simulations with varied dielectric coefficient thus lead us to conclude
that protein polarizability is not crucial for electrostatic stability of a slidinghelix VS that balances S4 charges by counter-charges. On the other hand, the
degree of polarizability contributes to determining the relation between voltage
and displaced charge.

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

Geometry of the gating canal
About 10 residues of the S4 helix are inaccessible to hydrophilic reagents applied
to resting channels from either the extracellular or intracellular side (Gandhi and
Isacoff, 2002). If the S4 domain is α-helical and oriented perpendicular to the
membrane plane, then the inaccessible translational range is only ≈1.35 nm long
and thus shorter than the lipid core of the membrane. Therefore the S4 helix
is thought to move across the hydrophobic region in a short ‘gating canal’ that
forms an electrical seal between water pockets extending toward the canal from
either side (vestibules). One consequence of this arrangement is that most of
the applied electrical voltage drops over a short length of the gating canal and
is thereby ‘focused’ on the interval of S4 charges dwelling in the canal itself.
Short of a simulation, approximate inferences can be made of potential electrostatic consequences of the gating canal. If the queue of S4 charges spans the
gating canal plus the range of S4 travel, then the instantaneous force F exerted
by the applied field on the n S4 charges simultaneously present in the canal of
length D is approximately F = ne0 Vm /D. The length D and the number n
are related by the axial spacing of the charges in the S4 helix: d = D/n (assuming that ‘in the canal’ on average implies an extra distance at either end of
about d/2). The electrical force acting on the S4 charges is thus F = e0 Vm /d.
Therefore this force F is independent of the length of the gating canal, depending only on the spacing between S4 charges. The instantaneous work done
by the field on the S4 charges as the S4 moves through the canal is given by
W = F md = me0 Vm , where m is the number of S4 charges that travel across
one of the gating canal mouths during the motion associated with the work W.
This work does not depend on the length of the gating canal. Moreover, the
S4 charges travel the same distance md per unit work regardless of the length
of the gating canal, D. Voltage sensitivity (defined by force or work picked up
per unit applied voltage) does not depend on the focusing of the electric field
by the gating canal itself, as long as the queue of S4 charges extends across the
gating canal.
To assess more fully the consequences of gating canal geometry, we simulate
varied canal lengths and/or canal positions with respect to the membrane planes
in the VS model (Fig. 8). Starting with the geometry of our standard model
for the α-helical VS (VS protein outline 1, compare Fig. 1), we shift the canal
toward the intracellular membrane plane (outline 2). Two further variations
include a reduction of the vestibule length on both sides by one half, thereby
lengthening the gating canal (outline 3) and a shift of that lengthened gating
canal (outline 4, Fig. S6).
With both the centered and the shifted gating canals, lengthening the canal
increases the slope of the charge/voltage relation while maintaining the maximal
charge displacement between ±100 mV (Fig. 8A, line patterns in the graph
correspond with the protein outlines below the graph). Shifting the position
of the gating canal shifts the charge/voltage relation along both the voltage
axis and the charge axis (towards the intracellular side) while maintaining the
slope typical of the canal length. These shifts indicate that asymmetries of the

vestibules of the gating canal bias the voltage sensed by the S4 segment.
The underlying energetics are summarized in Fig. 8B. Lengthening the gating
canal increases the depth of the energy minima at the ends of the range of travel,
thus promoting the bistable behavior of the VS associated with a steep slope of
the charge/voltage relation. Shifting the position of the gating pore shifts the
energy profile and therefore the S4 geometrical range of travel. The translational
spacing between the minima at either end of the energy trough is not changed
by these variations of gating canal geometry.
The observed invariance of the total charge displaced in these simulations
conforms to our earlier approximation (W = me0 Vm ). Geometrical S4 travel
relative to the center of the membrane tends to follow the position of the gating
canal. A longer gating canal giving less ‘focusing’ of the applied electric field
results in a steeper charge/voltage relation. The latter two relations are due to
the self-energy contribution to the configurational energy as defined by Eq. 9,
that is to the electric field when Vm = 0 is applied to the bath electrodes. In
this section’s simulations, the counter-charges to the S4 charges are aligned to
the center of the septum of the gating canal which, when the gating canal is
shifted, varies from the center of the membrane and the S4 protein region. The
counter-charges’ mutual spacing continues to be constant. With a longer canal,
there is a longer gap between the outermost counter-charge and the central end
of the vestibule on each side. The energy minima of the translational energy
profile are located at the S4 translational coordinate associated with the trailing
charge of the S4 helix vacating the poorly screened stretch of the gating canal
(see Animation S4 for associated charge distributions).

Screening of VS charge exposed to the aqueous solutions
Translocation of S4 charge across the membrane necessarily shifts a high local density of protein charge across the membrane. Therefore the energetics of
S4 translation should depend on the screening on either side of the membrane
of S4 charges by bath ions. We have thus far reported on VS models under
symmetrical screening conditions; under those conditions, any screening effects
on S4 energetics are masked by mutual compensation. Strongly asymmetrical
screening should unmask the contribution of screening to the energetics. Our
simulation does not include explicit bath ions, as we explore screening effects
instead by varying the distance of the bath electrodes from the membrane and
VS protein surfaces (see section ‘Model and boundary conditions’). The two extreme electrode placements shown in Fig. 1A,C are equivalent to low millimolar
ionic strength baths and exceedingly large ionic strength baths.
We compute the charge/voltage relations for our standard α-helical model
with three electrode configurations (Fig. 9A): (1) both electrodes far from the
membrane and protein, (2) both electrodes directly on the surface of the membrane and protein, and (3) the external electrode on the membrane and protein, and the internal electrode far from the membrane and protein. The
charge/voltage relation for configuration 2 (solid line) reveals a larger total
displaced charge and a steeper slope compared with configuration 1 (dotted

line). This increase in total charge at ‘high ionic strength’ has two sources:
the increase in electric distance between geometrical S4 positions (as discussed
by Islas and Sigworth, 2001); and the increase in the S4 geometrical range of
motion at ±100 mV, as indicated by the energy minima of translational energy
profiles (Fig. 9C). The increase in slope is due to the deeper translational energy
minima at the extreme positions, which promote bistable behavior as described
earlier.
The simulation for configuration 3 (low internal and high external ionic
strength) yields a left-shifted charge/voltage relation (long-dashed line in Fig. 9A).
The magnitude of this shift is due to the asymmetrical screening of S4 charges
on the internal and external sides; the S4 charges are attracted toward the external bath where screening is more effective. This result shows that the screening
of bath-exposed S4 charges contributes substantially to the energetics of S4
translation. This contribution is masked by mutual compensation when ionic
strengths are equal on both sides, except for contributions in terms of more
subtle variation of the shape of the charge/voltage relation.
The 310 -helical model gives substantially smaller voltage sensitivity than the
α-helical model when we simulate the models with ‘low ionic strength’ electrode
placement. Given the effects of screening on voltage sensitivity seen in Fig. 9A,
it is interesting to see to what extent strong screening ‘rescues’ voltage sensitivity of the 310 -helical model. In fact, exceedingly large ionic strength increases
voltage sensitivity substantially (solid line in Fig. 9B) in terms of both increased
maximum slope and total charge displaced across the simulated potential. However, this ‘rescue’ does not push voltage sensitivity all the way to that found
for the α-helical model (solid line in Fig. 9A). The corresponding translational
energy profiles for the 310 -helical model are shown in Fig. 9D.
Islas and Sigworth (2001) found small voltage shifts (<10 mV) when studying
the effects of intracellular variation of ionic strength on charge/voltage relations
of Shaker channels. They interpreted these observations in terms of the GuyChapman theory of the electrical double layer. In those terms, those small
shifts indicate a low density of membrane surface charge. In our simulations
(Fig. 9A), a unilateral variation of screening causes a large shift even though
the model does not include surface charge. Screening of S4 charges by a bath
of low ionic strength reduces the electrostatic energy less than the screening of
such S4 charges by a bath of high ionic strength. This effect does not require
fixed surface charges, but arises from the S4 charges themselves. In contrast to
the interpretation given by Islas and Sigworth (2001), the absence of a voltage
shift may indicate that fixed negative charge exists at the intracellular end of
the gating canal, but that such charge is largely neutralized by the positive S4
charges exposed to the intracellular baths at the midpoint of the S4’s range
of travel. The S4 charge exposed in this configuration is then screened by the
negative fixed charge regardless of the ionic strength of the bath.

30

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

Consequences of ‘surface charge’
The existence of ‘surface charge’ acting on the VS was inferred by Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin (1957) and many subsequent studies (Hille, 2001). Negative charges on residues of the extracellular loop connecting the S5 and pore
segments of Kv channels determine the voltage for activating the channel (Elinder et al., 1998; Elinder and Århem, 1999). One residue is conserved in that
region – E418 for ShakerB – while others are variable. E418 is involved in
mediating activation-related slow inactivation and has been proposed to interact at close range with the outermost S4 charge (R362) when the VS is in the
activating position (Larsson and Elinder, 2000; Elinder et al., 2001).
We model surface charge as discrete by placing a point charge of -e0 into
either one bath at translation 1 nm or both baths at ±1 nm, which are the
translations approached by the terminal S4 charges at voltages of ±100 mV.
The charge is given the same radial distance from the S4 axis as the countercharges located inside the protein. Two angular positions are tested: a ‘close’
one aligned with the terminal S4 charge, and a ‘far’ one turned 180◦ away from
the S4 charge.
The charge/voltage relations for our standard α-helical S4 model with four
surface charge arrangements added are shown in Fig. 10A: one external charge
in the far position (short-dash line); one external and one internal surface
charge, with both in the far positions (dotted line); one external charge in
the close position (long-dash line); and one external and one internal charge,
with both in the close positions (solid line). The far external charge shifts the
charge/voltage relation, producing the signature of a surface charge. The combination of far external and far internal surface charges slightly reduces the slope
of the charge/voltage relation with respect to the model without surface charges
(compare Fig. 3). The combination of close internal and close external charge
also produces no shift (due to symmetry) but does steepen the slope of the
charge/voltage curve (compare Fig. 3A). With only the close external charge,
the charge/voltage relation is shifted, and at negative voltage, the asymptote
is slightly less steep relative to the asymptote with both surface charges. Thus
surface charges have position-dependent effects on both the midpoint and slope
of charge/voltage relations.
Elinder et al. (2001) estimated the contributions of individual surface charges
present in K+ channels to voltage shift in charge/voltage relations, using the
voltage shifts of ionic conductance observed with varied Mg2+ concentrations.
Our simulated shifts are in the range of those estimated shifts. Elinder et al.
(2001) interpreted the varied shifts estimated for different charged residues to
be a consequence of the distance from the VS charges to the charged residues.
Our self-consistent simulations with a ‘close’ and a ‘far’ surface charge show
only a small effect on voltage shifts due to the distance to the surface charge
(long- and short-dashed lines in Fig. 10).
The translational energy profiles from those four surface-charge simulations
are shown in Fig. 10B. Far external surface charge chiefly tilts the profile (shortdash line), whereas far surface charges on both sides remove the energy wells

near the ends of the energy trough. Close external and internal charges, however,
create deeper energy wells at either end of the range of S4 motion (solid line).
With only a close external charge, an energy well is added at the external end of
the range of S4 motion, while energy at the intracellular end of the range is raised
(long-dash line). The energy well resulting from close interaction with a surface
charge increases the electrostatic contribution to S4 transmembrane stability as
well, since it lowers the electrostatic energy of that S4 position relative to more
extreme S4 positions. This does not occur when the interaction with the surface
charge is far.

Conclusion
The sliding helix configuration has an innate electrostatic stability if the helix
charges not exposed to water are balanced by fixed counter-charges. This balance extends over the range of helix movement where from about 3 to about 4
charge equivalents are displaced across the membrane field. The limited range of
motion at the extremes of physiological membrane potential leads to robustness
of VS behavior over a range of conditions and geometrical variations. Whether
the geometry is α-helical, 310 helical, in high ionic concentration or low, this basic structural issue leads to a system that results in gating-charge displacement
in response to change in transmembrane potential.
On the other hand between those extremes, the energy landscape for a given
membrane potential varies between models: from almost flat to two energy
troughs separated by a large barrier. Those variations lead to distinct charge
displacement patterns (implying distinct kinetics not investigated here). Protein
dielectric, gating canal geometry, helix configuration and surface charges alter
the behavior of the system, ranging from systems that can be approximated
by two-state Boltzmann models all the way to continuous model systems. This
results in a family of voltage-sensors with easily perturbed voltage sensitivity
despite their robust behavior at their limits. Features not made explicit in our
models will likely play a role in that region of sensitivity.
These results suggest a problem with the 310 -helical S4 structure: in the parameter space we studied, the 310 models tend towards poor voltage-sensitivity
in contrast with α-helical models which show both higher voltage-sensitivity and
greater variation in voltage-sensitivity.
Our simulations exploring the consequences of a set of physical parameters
elucidate the electrostatic principles underlying both the robustness of voltagesensor charge-displacement response and the sensitivity of voltage-sensitivity
and gating charge voltage shift in the face of small model variations. Resolving
the ‘inverse’ problem of connecting specific experimental data with the specific
underlying physics is both a computational and experimental challenge. We
suggest that more ‘forward’ simulations of the consequences of physical parameters are needed to guide the design and interpretation of experiments intended
to determine fine control of voltage sensing.

The divergence theorem (Gauss’s theorem) states that

where S is the closed surface around the volume V, da is the area of the surface
element located at r ∈ S, and dτ is the volume of the space element located at
r ∈ V. This holds for any geometry of V.
A relevant surface for applying Gauss’s theorem is the dielectric boundary of the VS protein since the electric field at that boundary generates the
most important induced charge to be computed. The surface integral in Eq. S1
must yield the algebraic sum of the formal charges that are assigned to the VS
residues. Our numerical method approximates the normal field strength (and
hence induced charge density) at the surface as piecewise uniform. Gauss’s theorem provides a test in the actual system that we simulate of the accuracy of the
induced charge computed on the boundary. The difference between the computed total induced charge Qcalc and the charge QGauss predicted from Gauss’s
theorem is:

where aj is the area of protein surface element j and j is the dielectric coefficient

The error in the computed charge calculation is likely to vary as S4 charges
are moved in a simulation since the distances between the S4 charges and the
dielectric boundaries vary. Fig. S1 shows the error in induced charge calculation
for the full range of S4 translational positions in a typical simulation. The error
is ≤0.008 e0 of the actual net charge of 3 e0 assigned to the VS in this simulation.
The results of our charge calculation are thus in good agreement with Gauss’s
theorem, as they must be.
In a second control, we compare the calculations of electrostatic energy by
two independent approaches: (1) direct calculation of the energy, using the
Ramo-Shockley theorem as described in Methods as our standard procedure;
and (2) path-integration of the force acting on the S4 segment via Eq. 12.
Both methods use the induced charges on dielectric boundaries and electrodes
computed in our simulation and tested using Gauss’s law as described above.
Method (1) is based on the potentials produced by all charges. Method (2) is
based on the electrical fields of all charges. These methods have no computational overlap following the charge computation (in other words, these methods
use distinct code paths, a test for coding correctness). We show this control for
three applied voltages with a prescribed (diagonal) path through the translational and rotational dimensions of the range of S4 motion which we typically
examine. Fig. S2 shows the energies from Method (1) as dots superimposed on
the energies from method (2) as lines.

Figure S1: Test of numerical accuracy using Gauss’s theorem. The difference Qcalc −
QGauss as defined by Eq. S2 is plotted versus S4 translation (Eq. 16 is applied to
calculate the expectation value over the rotational degree of freedom). Normal electric
flux is integrated over the surface of the protein (brown region in Fig. 1). The protein
region contains a net charge of +3 e0 (6 positive S4 charges and 3 negative countercharges), which is recovered from the integrated electrical flux within a relative error of
<0.003 over the full range of S4 translation (≤0.008 e0 ). Charge errors computed for
three applied voltages (-100 mV, circles; 0 mV, line; 100 mV, crosses) are superimposed
in the graph, showing no detectable effect of the external field on the error.

prescribed by the translations plotted as abscissa and the proportional rotational increments such that the standard α-helical model S4 charges follow the curve of countercharges (from -180 to +180 degrees). Energies computed by integrating the force along
this path (lines) are compared with energies computed using the Ramo-Shockley theorem (dots) as described as our routine method in Methods. These tests are applied for
three membrane voltages (100 mV, red; 0 mV, black; +100 mV, green). The energies
obtained by these two methods are aligned at the most negative translation tested.

Electrostatics of voltage sensitivity

Charge distributions of VS models
The sliding helix in our VS models is a microscopic voltage sensor, thus subject
to thermal agitation. Its behavior must be described in statistical terms. In this
section, stochastic VS behavior is visualized for several models presented in the
paper, both as figures for a fixed applied voltage (-100 mV; Figs. S3–S6) and in
animations with voltage increasing uniformly over time from -100 to +100 mV
(Animations S1–S4, respectively).
The figures show two stochastic aspects of VS behavior: (1) the mean positions of the S4 charges (marked by blue balls), and (2) the charge density
distribution of S4 charge (represented by a blue cloud with a color intensity
proportional to the charge density there). A high density of color marks the
locations where the S4 charges dwell frequently, as opposed to their mean positions.
The mean position for each charge is computed from Eq. 15 using the positions rk for the charge qk as the random variable X, using the partition function
with translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Since the helix behaves
as a solid body, the helix position r fixes the positions rk for the charges qk .
That relationship allows us to define the partition function for the positions rk
in terms of the partition function for the helix position r, as well as the energy
functions for rk in terms of the energy function for the helix position.
In other words, by applying Eq. 15 to a model with X = rk , the mean position hrk i for any charge can be calculated given the probability of configuration
ij (Pij , Eqs. 14 & 13):
hrk i =

X

rijk Pij =

i,j

1 X
rijk e−Wij /kB T
Q i,j

(S3)

where Wij is the work to construct configuration ij and rijk is the position of
charge k in configuration ij.
Likewise, the distribution of charge can be computed by applying the partition and energy functions in terms of the position of charges rk . The charge
density z̄(r) is then the sum over all charges of the probability of each charge
being located at r, multiplied by its valency, and normalized:
z̄(r) = P
i,j,k

X
1
Pij zk δ(r, rijk )
Pij zk

(S4)

i,j,k

where δ(r, rijk ) is the discretized delta function (1 if we’re treating rijk as the
same location as r for visualization purposes, otherwise 0). The color representations for the animations are proportional to z̄(r) normalized to the highest
charge density at that frame’s potential.
