Most sensory cells use cross-membrane chemoreceptors to detect chemical signals in the environment. The biochemical properties and spatial organization of chemoreceptors play important roles
in achieving and maintaining sensitivity and accuracy of chemical sensing. Here we investigate the
effects of receptor cooperativity and adaptation on the limits of gradient sensing. We study a single
cell with aggregated chemoreceptor arrays on the cell surface and derive general formula to the
limits for gradient sensing from the uncertainty of instantaneous receptor activity. In comparison
to independent receptors, we find that cooperativity by non-adaptative receptors could significantly
lower the sensing limit in a chemical concentration range determined by the biochemical properties of ligand-receptor binding and ligand-induced receptor activity. Cooperativity by adaptative
receptors are beneficial to gradient sensing within a broad range of background concentrations. Our
results also show that isotropic receptor aggregate layout on the cell surface represents an optimal
configuration to gradient sensing.

INTRODUCTION

Cellular sensory systems can detect temporal and spatial changes of environmental signals. For example, bacteria sense chemical gradient by motion that translates
spatial chemical concentration asymmetry into temporal asymmetry. Larger chemotactic eukaryotes are able
to sense the spatial gradients of chemoattractants across
the cell dimension. A primary task for a sensory cell is
to respond to small chemical concentration changes or
shallow chemical gradients with sufficient accuracy under stochastic noises. Berg and Purcell, in their classic
study [1], showed that the fundamental physical limit of
concentration sensing is set by the uncertainty of ligand
diffusion to a sensory cell regardless of biochemical details
in a sensing mechanism employed by the cell. This result
was generalized by Bialek and Setayeshgar [2] using the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and was also applicable
to gradient sensing [3].
Ligand detection by membrane-bound chemoreceptors
is the first step for chemical sensing in a vast majority
of sensory systems of living cells. Uncertainty of ligandreceptor binding and stochastic dynamics of downstream
cellular signaling may introduce additional noises. Reducing such noise may help a system to operate near
the fundamental Berg-Purcell limit. However, the exact
sensing limit under proper ligand-receptor interaction remains elusive. In particular, the effect of receptor cooperativity is controversial [4–7]. Receptor cooperativity can
sensitize the receptor response to small signal changes,
but in the meanwhile it also amplifies stochastic fluctuations in signal. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux
(MWC) model, Bialek and Setayeshgar [4] showed that

receptor cooperativity helps to lower the threshold of
concentration sensing to approach the Berg-Purcell limit
set by ligand diffusion. Hu et al. [5], by an Ising-type
model, showed that receptor cooperativity improves gradient sensing within a shortened dynamic range of background concentrations. Most recently, Skoge et al. [7]
studied chemoreceptor activity by a dynamic Ising model
and showed that receptor cooperativity could slow down
receptor activity and thus may not improve the signalto-noise ratio due to reduced response time.
Another crucial mechanism found in many cellular sensory systems is adaptation, which maintains the sensitivity of a system to varying levels of environmental
signals. It is known that adaptation tunes kinetics of
chemoreceptors at the molecular level. For the example of the better understood E. coli, the activity of receptors are modulated by multisite receptor methylation
and demethylation. However, the effect of receptor cooperativity to chemical sensing limit under the context of
receptor adaptation is yet to be examined.
Using a theoretical model, here we study the role of
receptor cooperativity on the accuracy of chemical sensing under the influence of receptor adaptation. We consider a sensory cell with a hierarchical organization of
cell-surface chemoreceptors. Receptor cooperativity is
described by the classic MWC model [8], which was originally developed to explain allosteric regulation of multisubunit proteins and has been widely used to model
chemoreceptor coupling in bacteria [9–12]. We derive
formula for the limit of gradient sensing based on the
uncertainty of instantaneous receptor states at the equilibrium. Our results show that cooperativity by nonadaptative receptors reduces instantaneous noise of receptor states within a limited range of background concentrations determined by the biochemical parameters
of receptor dynamics and ligand-receptor binding. In
contrast, cooperativity by adaptative receptors improves

2
the sensing accuracy across a wide dynamic range. We
also show that the layout of receptor aggregates on the
cell surface significantly affects the sensing limit with the
isotropic layout being the optimal. Although the sensing
limit is sensitive to the cell orientation under anisotropic
aggregate layouts, the effect of receptor cooperativity is
invariant.

THEORY

A two-dimensional cell model

active (“on”) and inactive (“off”) state with a free energy
difference ∆E = Eoff − Eon (in units of kB T , where kB
is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature). As in an MWC model, coupled receptors in a
cluster switch in an all-or-none fashion between the “on”
and “off” states. A ligand binds to a receptor of the “on”
or “off” state with a dissociation constant Kon or Koff ,
respectively. Ligand binding will shift the free energy difference between the two receptor states and such change
can be sensed by a cell to measure the ligand concentration. At the equilibrium, a receptor cluster m at the
“on” or “off” state 
bound to r ligands
 hasthe free energy

of nEon − ln

We consider a model (Fig. 1) for a two-dimensional
chemotactic cell subject to a chemoattractant gradient
field G(x; p, φ), where x is the spatial coordinate, and
p and φ are the steepness and direction of the gradient. The steepness is defined in a polar coordinate sysdc
tem as: p ≡ rc00 dr
, which is a normalized concentration
change across a reference distance r0 along the direction
of the gradient. The cell has M receptor aggregates distributed at distinct locations on the cell surface. Cooperative receptors form clusters of size n and each aggregate contains a number of such independent and noninteracting receptor clusters. Assuming aggregate m has
Nm receptor clusters, we have the total number of rePM
ceptor monomers in a cell as: Ntot = n m=1 Nm . This
hierarchical organization of receptors on the cell membrane is general and can be parameterized to study a cell
that has aggregated receptor arrays with (n > 1) or without cooperativity (n = 1) or has non-aggregated receptor
monomers (Nm = 1 and n = 1).
In the absence of ligand, a receptor switches between

The non-dimensional coefficient α ≡ Koff /Kon .
At the equilibrium, an instantaneous configuration of
receptor cluster states measures the chemical concentrations around the cell. Such configuration fluctuates in
time due to randomness of ligand-receptor binding and
stochasticity in receptor state switching, which underlies
the uncertainty in gradient sensing. Based on the above
model, below we shall derive the best achievable limit for
the sensing uncertainty.

In all cases, σp2 and σφ2 can be numerically computed,
and it is possible to obtain their analytical solutions under special cell geometry and surface layout of receptor
aggregates. Here we specialize to a circular cell of radius r and designate the origin as the cell center such
that βm = β = r/r0 , for all m. For a shallow gradient
across the cell length (pβ ≪ 1), we approximate ωm ≈ ω0
for all receptor aggregates. ω0 is calculated by Eq. (6)
evaluated at concentration c0 , which can be considered
as the average ligand concentration at the cell location
(assigned to the cell center). For an equidistant layout
of identically-sized receptor aggregates over the cell surface (an isotropic distribution), we obtain the CRLB’s
for uncertainties in sensing p and φ [14]:

We define the coefficient

ωm ≡

which is a function of local chemical concentration cm ,
size of the receptor aggregate Nm , the strength of receptor coupling n and receptor affinities to the ligand Kon
and Koff . We first notice that for the single receptor aggregate m sensing its local chemical concentration cm ,
the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the sensing variance is
given as:
σc2m =

(7)

The noise-to-signal ratio is determined by σc2m /c2m .
For chemical gradient detection by all cell-surface receptor aggregates, the sensing limit to steepness p or direction φ is set by the CRLB’s (diagonal entries of the
inverted Fisher information matrix):
σp2 = [I −1 ]11 ,

σφ2 = [I −1 ]22 .

(8)

To obtain analytical results, we assume that the cell
resides in a linear gradient field. Across a typical cell
size (e.g., about 10 µm for Dictyostelium and 1 µm for E.
coli), the linear gradient is a reasonable approximation.
cm at the polar coordinate (rm , θm ) is:
cm = c0 [1 + βm p cos(θm − φ)] ,

(9)

where c0 is the background concentration at the origin
and the coefficient βm ≡ rm /r0 is the distance from aggregate m to the origin normalized by the reference distance r0 . We have

The factor ξn ≡ nP0 (1 − P0 ) is related to receptor cooperativity n, where P0 is calculated by Eq. (1) at c0 . The
above limits in Eq.(12) have a few properties: (i) Both
σp2 and σφ2 are independent of the number of receptor aggregates M and are insensitive to the gradient direction
φ. (ii) Directional sensing improves (σφ2 decreases) as
the steepness p increases. Fortuitously, σφ2 is the noiseto-signal ratio of steepness sensing. (iii) The receptor
system loses sensing capability when ligand binding does
not differentiate the two receptor states (α ≈ 1). (iv) σp2
is very sensitive to the cell size via the term Ntot β, where
Ntot may vary with the cell size by a certain relationship
and therefore σp2 could scale more strongly than the inverse of normalized cell radius β 2 . Properties (iii) and
(iv) hold even though the layout of receptor aggregates
on the cell surface is anisotropic.
B.

Extension to a three-dimensional cell model

The 2-dimensional model can be extended to a 3dimensional cell to approach a more geometrically realistic scenario. In the spherical coordinate system, a
point has its spatial coordinate (ρ, ϑ, ϕ), where ρ is the
radial length, ϑ and ϕ are the polar angle and the azimuthal angle. Assume a linear chemical gradient with
a steepness p and a direction along the unit vector
g ≡ [cos ϑg , sin ϑg cos ϕg , sin ϑg sin ϕg ]. For a receptor aggregate m at cell-surface location Am , the vector along
the direction from origin O at the cell center to Am ,
OAm , is am ≡ rm [cos ϑm , sin ϑm cos ϕm , sin ϑm sin ϕm ].
Concentration cm can be calculated as:

within which receptor cooperativity up to the magnitude of n can improve the accuracy of chemical sensing.
Fig. 2(b) shows that the beneficial region of free energy
difference ∆E is confined in a banded area from around
0 at low ligand concentration to around ln(1/α) at high
ligand concentration. The bandwidth of ∆E is a constant n2 ln(P+ /P− ), limited by the strength of receptor
cooperativity n. A stronger cooperativity results in a
narrower band. For each given ∆E, the beneficial range
of background concentration c0 is determined by Eq. (20)
(see Fig.2(b) for illustration). Results in Fig.2(b) were
obtained at α < 1, in which ligand binding favors the
“off” state of the receptor. The results at α > 1 (not
shown) are clearly symmetric to those at α < 1. We
note that the above derivation is under the assumption
that the receptor system has a fixed total number of receptors Ntot . The general conclusion also applies to a
system that has fixed numbers of receptor clusters (Nm )
in receptor aggregates [15].
In the following, we analyze the influence of receptor cooperativity on the chemical sensing limit under the
context of receptors with or without adaptation.

Non-adaptative receptors

receptor activity changes with the ligand concentration

case to our model, by requiring e−∆E ≪ 1 and α ≪ 1.
By contrast, receptor cooperativity improves sensing
accuracy below the optimal c0 near ∆E ≈ 0 [Fig. 3(c)].
Fig. 3(d) shows that at low background concentration
(c0 = 0.1) the system achieves optimal sensing accuracy
at free energy difference ∆E ≈ 0 of any cooperativity
level and receptor cooperativity further decreases σp2 (an
order of magnitude improvement at n = 10 over independent receptors). We can relate this result to E. coli, in
which c0 = 0.1 corresponds to a background concentration of 2 nM MeAsp, a threshold level, at Koff = 20 nM
and cooperativity predicted about n = 10 as in Ref. [11].

∆E (values indicated in plots) under different cluster size:

(corresponding to “trimer-of-dimers” in bacteria); and 10, ‘⋄’
(corresponding to an estimate by Ref. [11]). σp2 were calculated by Eq. (8) (markers) and by Eq. (12) (solid lines) with
Ntot = 80, 000, M = 3, p = 0.1, φ = 0, α = 0.1 and β = 1. σφ2
behaves similarly and is not shown.

and binding affinities Kon and Koff are unmodulated by
the receptor activity. Fig. 3 shows that in all cases σp2 assumes a valley-shaped relationship with the background
concentration c0 . σp2 attains a minimum at a c0 that
satisfies the condition dσp2 /dc0 = 0, i.e.:
2αc20 + n(1 − α)(1 − 2P0 )c0 − 2 = 0 .

(21)

At the regime ∆E < 0, where an unliganded receptor
is biased to the “off” state, increasing receptor cooperativity always reduces sensing accuracy [Fig. 3(a)] when
ligand binding as well favors the “off” state (i.e., α < 1).
According to Fig. 2(b), ∆E = −1 is out of the beneficial
band at any background concentration c0 . Intuitively, in
this case, receptor arrays have limited capacity (most receptors are already “off” even before the introduction of
ligands) to respond to ligand binding by further switching off receptor activity.
At the regime ∆E > 0, receptor cooperativity reduces
σp2 within a concentration range around the optimal c0
[Fig. 3(b)]. Such advantage is confined in a narrowed
dynamic range around intermediate background concentrations [the stronger the cooperativity, the shorter the
range of improvement] instead of being effective at lower
concentrations, a desirable region for chemotactic responses. The results shown in Fig. 3(b) approximate
those by the Ising-type model of Hu et al. [5] in which a
receptor maintains the “on” state in the absence of ligand and is only switched off by ligand binding. In fact,
the model by Hu et al. [5] can be considered as a limiting

Near precise adaptation was found in bacteria such
as E. coli [16]. A ligand concentration change triggers
a transient response in receptor activity followed by a
slow decay back to the steady state about the prestimulus level. In other words, receptor adaptation desensitizes the steady-state activity to ligand concentration,
allowing the cell to be responsive to environmental signals within a wide dynamic range. Here we show that
adaptation also conditions the receptor system to allow
cooperativity to improve signal-to-noise ratio in chemical
sensing under a wide range of background concentrations.
We assume that the receptor system is adapted to its
chemical environment before an onset of change in ligand
concentration. We also assume that the adaptation machinery adjusts the free energy difference ∆E between the
two states of the receptor and keeps binding affinities Kon
and Koff invariant. For the example of E. coli, receptor
activity-controlled receptor methylation and demethylation act as a feedback mechanism that can adjust the free
energy gap ∆E. For precise adaptation, equilibrium receptor activity is tuned to be a constant, Pa , independent
of the background concentration. By Eq. (1), at aggregate m, we have the adjusted free energy difference:

Concentration changes around cm induces transient receptor activity Pm away from Pa , which is described by

The optimal sensing achieves at the half-activation

the background concentration c0 = α−1/2 according to
Eq. (21) [i.e., [L]0 = (Kon Koff )1/2 is the geometric mean
of dissociation constants]. Fig.2(b) shows (dashed line)
the adjusted ∆E to adapted receptor activity Pa = 1/2
as a function of ligand concentration. The adaptation
tunes ∆E into the middle of the beneficial region band
and allows the receptor cooperativity to improve sensing
of small concentration changes.

The adaptation mechanism may also likely maintain a
constant steady-state activity by adjusting ligand binding affinities Kon and Koff , or adjusting all three thermodynamics parameters altogether [17]. How adaptation
tunes these parameters altogether remains unclear even
for the well-studied E. coli chemoreceptors. Nonetheless, as our model shows, as long as a cell achieves
an adaptation level (precise or imprecise) that satisfies
P− < Pa < P+ , receptor cooperativity is advantageous
for sensing small changes in chemical concentration or
gradient. It has been suggested a precise adaptation of
Pa ≈ 1/3 in E. coli [18] in the range specified by Eq. (19),
supporting the idea that receptor adaptation and cooperativity act in concert to improve chemical sensing.

The analytical formula in Eq. (12) do not apply to the
scenario where receptor aggregates anisotropically locate
on the cell surface. As we will show, such an anisotropy
may cause substantial dependence of σp2 and σφ2 on the
gradient direction φ, the number and locations of receptor aggregates. We define a metric, Re , to quantify the
layout anisotropy:

angles of receptor aggregates are labeled in an order such
that θi+1 ≥ θi , for i = 1, .., M , with the periodic boundary condition: θM+1 ≡ θ1 + 2π (see Fig.1). Re ranges
from 0 for the isotropic case to 1 when all receptor aggregates gather at a single location.
Each effective receptor aggregate acts as a local concentration sensor, and a pair of aggregates can detect the
projection of the gradient onto the direction connecting
the two aggregates. Two independent projections are
needed in minimum to reconstruct the gradient. In our
model, the minimal number of effective cell-surface receptor aggregates is M = 2 because of the implicit assumption that one parameter of the linear gradient, the
background concentration c0 , is known. This assumption
is justified by considering that the cell has a memory for
a recent history of its chemical environment.
A sensing singularity occurs when the cell (1) has only
one effective receptor aggregate because two aggregates
locate too close to each other, or (2) has two aggregates
lying on the opposite side across the cell center such that
only one independent projection of the chemical gradient
can be detected. For such a special layout, the Fisher
information matrix of Eq. (11) becomes degenerate and
the cell cannot resolve either gradient steepness p or the
direction φ. For M = 2, σp2 diverges at either end, Re = 0
or 1, where the system has a single independent sensor

[Fig. 4(a)]. For M = 3 or M = 4, σp2 diverges at Re = 1
and a singularity of the sensing limit may also happen
at Re = 1/2 or 2/3, respectively. Notice that, as the
number of receptor aggregates M increases, the extent of
singularity decreases because receptor aggregate layouts
with the corresponding value of Re become less likely to
be degenerate by chance.
In general, one can verify that σp2 may become singular at Re = (M − 2)/(M − 1) and Re = 1 because
some receptor aggregates locate so close to each other
that they effectively sense a same local ligand concentration. Suppose among all immediately neighboring aggregates along the cell circle there exist k angles that are
equal to or greater than the average angle 2π/M (i.e.,
the rest M − k angles are smaller than 2π/M ). Let Θ
be the sum of these k angles. We rewrite the anisotropic

,

(24)

which changes from 0 to 1 as Θ ranges from 2πk/M to
2π. The aggregate layout can be classified into three
cases when the value of k changes (see Fig. 5(b) for example layouts when M = 3). (i) When k = 1 and
Θ = 2π, Re = 1, the system has a single effective aggregate at one location (Re = 1), and therefore cannot
resolve parameters p or φ. The system is non-degenerate
as long as Θ 6= 2π. (ii) When k = 2 and Θ = 2π,
Re = (M − 2)/(M − 1), there exist two effective aggregates. In the special case in which these two effective aggregates locate at two opposite sides on the circle across
the cell center, the Fisher information matrix degenerates. The system is non-degenerate as long as Θ 6= 2π.
(iii) When k ≥ 3, no degeneration appears. As an illustration for M = 3, Fig.5(b) shows that a singularity in
σp2 may happen at Re = 0.5 (corresponding to the last
layout in Fig. 5(a)). However, the majority of layouts
with Re = 0.5 are non-degenerate. For instance, all layouts with k = 1 and Θ = 4π/3 has Re = 0.5 but none of
them is degenerate.
Both σp2 and σφ2 are sensitive to the cell orientation
under anisotropic aggregate layout [see Fig. 4(b) for a
non-adaptive case]. The effect of receptor cooperativity
is preserved under anisotropic receptor aggregate layouts
because ξn is geometrically independent under a shallow
gradient. By changing the cell orientation, improvement
in estimating one parameter of p or φ is gained at the expense of the other. This result coincides with the study
by Hu et al. [19] who showed that an elliptic cell cannot
simultaneously improve limits σp2 and σφ2 by elongating
the cell body. As an optimal configuration, the isotropic
layout of receptor aggregates improves sensing both p and
φ in most cases and is insensitive to cell orientation as
indicated by Eq. (12) and as shown in Fig. 4(b). This result recapitulates the one derived by Berg and Purcell [1]
who showed that uniformly distributed receptor patches
on the membrane maximize independent ligand influx to
the cell and thus sensitizes the concentration measurement. However, as shown by Fig. 4(b), proper cell orientation can improve estimation of one of the parameters
(p or φ), which might be a desirable task if sensing one
parameter is more critical than the other. For example,
accurate directional sensing may be more important than
steepness sensing in chemotaxis so that a cell can identify swimming direction more efficiently. For a cell with
anisotropic layout of receptor aggregates, routine reorientation is required to improve sensing performance (e.g.,
tumbling of E. coli).
The above results of minimal number and optimal layout of receptor aggregates were obtained under the assumption that the background ligand concentration c0 is
known. One can also consider c0 as an extra parameter to be estimated by the cell. In this case, merely by
counting the number of parameters (p, φ and c0 ) the cell

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

It is well-known that adaptation brings the receptor
activity back to pre stimulus level, allowing the system
to remain sensitive to chemical changes in the future.
This mechanism enables the system to respond within
a wide dynamic range of chemical concentration. Here
we examine the role of adaptation in terms of chemical
sensing accuracy, especially when presented with small
signals or small changes in the signal, where stochastic
noise may become overwhelming. Our study showed that
receptor cooperativity improves sensing accuracy only
within a limited background concentration range if the
receptor aggregates do not undergo adaptation. By contrast, receptor adaptation, especially precise or near precise adaptation, maintains the receptor sensory system to
operate within the parametric region where receptor cooperativity is beneficial. As to our knowledge, the finding
in this work for the first time connects receptor adaptation and cooperativity to noise filtering in chemical sensing.
The sensing limit of Eq. (12) was derived from the
uncertainty of an instantaneous receptor sampling of a
gradient field. The sensing accuracy can be improved by
a cell integrating independent receptor state configurations over time [1]. The time interval between two independent measurements is determined by the correlation
time τc that accounts for relaxation times of ligand diffusion, ligand-receptor binding [5] and receptor dynamics. Because the amount of time t available for averaging
is limited by dynamics of the intracellular signaling circuit, the number of independent measurements is about
t
2τc [20]. Therefore, the temporal averaging reduces the
instantaneous limit σp2 to hσp2 it ≈ 2τc σp2 /t when t ≫ 2τc .
Ligand concentration is encoded as receptor occupancy
by the ligand-receptor binding and is then transduced
into receptor activity by the MWC model. Stochastic
dynamics of each of these signal transduction stages contributes additional noise and thus increases the correlation time τc , which consequently elevates the sensing
uncertainty within the given time frame t.
Our study does not consider the temporal dynamics
of ligand-receptor binding and receptor state switching.
Skoge et al. [7] recently showed that receptor cooperativity may significantly slow down receptor state switching
(described by Glauber dynamics [21] originally developed
for studying time dependence of the Ising model) to an
extent such that the system cannot effectively relay the
information of ligand concentration changes in time [τc
becomes comparable or greater than the averaging time
t]. However, there is still a lack of direct experimental
evidence on how receptor coupling quantitatively modulates receptor dynamics. Our results reveal that the
benefit provided by receptor coupling to chemical sensing by instantaneous receptor activity configurations may
compensate the potentially detrimental effect of receptor
activity slowdown, in particular by adapted receptor arrays.

Another possible source of noise at the ligand-receptor
interaction level is due to ligand rebinding when a dissociated ligand diffuses back again to bind onto the receptor
aggregate before it escapes into the bulk medium. The
extent of ligand rebinding and its effects on the accuracy
of ligand sensing depends on the size and density of a
receptor aggregate [22]. Theory [23] and simulation [24]
showed that ligand rebinding does not change the equilibrium occupancy of individual receptors and therefore
does not affect the sensing limits obtained from instantaneous measurement. However, significant ligand rebinding does introduce extra fluctuations by decreasing the
effective rate constants for ligand association with and
dissociation from the receptor, which increases the correlation time τc and thus reduces the number of independent measurements within a fixed averaging time.
Chemoreceptor cooperativity in bacteria was predicted
by Ising models and MWC models used for analyzing
dose response data in E. coli. More recently receptor coupling is evident by the hexagonal organization of trimerof-dimers of chemoreceptors resolved by electron cryotomography as a conserved architecture in a wide variety
of bacteria [25]. The spatial organization of eukaryotic
chemoreceptors remains to be fully resolved, even though
higher-order receptor arrays in chemotactic eukaryotes
have also been observed [26], suggesting possible receptor coupling. Our model of the receptor organization on
the cell surface is general and can be parameterized to
study systems of coupling or non-coupling receptors with
or without adaptation.
Berg and Purcell [1] showed that uniformly distributed
receptor patches over the cell surface is optimal for reducing interactions between nearby receptors and therefore maximizes ligand intake by the cell, where ligands
were considered spatially homogeneous in the environment. Here, we consider the detection of spatial asymmetry of ligand concentrations around the cell due to the
chemical gradient. By examining the effect of geometric layout of receptor aggregates on the cell surface, we
showed that anisotropic receptor aggregate distribution
generates a trade-off between the sensing limit of gradient steepness p and that of the gradient direction φ
(Fig.4). The isotropic layout represents an optimal configuration, in which the sensing accuracy is insensitive to
cell orientation.
In summary, we study the effect of receptor cooperativity and adaptation on the chemical sensing limit by
evaluating the Cramer-Rao lower bounds from the instantaneous global state of receptor activity. Our results
showed that receptor cooperativity with receptor adaptation increases gradient sensing accuracy (by lowering the
CRLB) for small signal changes across a wide dynamic
range of background concentration. This result is also applicable to concentration sensing at a single aggregate location (Eq. (7)). It remains largely unknown whether or
how a chemotactic cell achieves its sensing limit. Receptor internalization [27] might improve chemical sensing
by helping the cell membrane to function as an absorbing

9
surface, an ideal device that operates at the fundamental Berg-Purcell limit. Maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) from ligand-receptor binding time series [28] or
instantaneous receptor states [5, 19] was also suggested
as a possible approach to the physical limit. The answer
to how a cell mechanistically integrates information in
time and space remains speculative and requires further
