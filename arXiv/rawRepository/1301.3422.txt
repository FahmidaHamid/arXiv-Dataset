Summary: The evolution of animals involved acquisition of an emergent gene repertoire for
gastrulation. Whether loss of genes also co-evolved with this developmental reprogramming has not
yet been addressed. Here, we identify twenty-four genetic functions that are retained in fungi and
choanoflagellates but undetectable in animals. These lost genes encode: (i) sixteen distinct biosynthetic
functions; (ii) the two ancestral eukaryotic ClpB disaggregases, Hsp78 and Hsp104, which function in
the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively; and (iii) six other assorted functions. We present
computational and experimental data that are consistent with a joint function for the differentially
localized ClpB disaggregases, and with the possibility of a shared client/chaperone relationship
between the mitochondrial Fe/S homoaconitase encoded by the lost LYS4 gene and the two ClpBs. Our
analyses lead to the hypothesis that the evolution of gastrulation-based multicellularity in animals led
to efficient extraction of nutrients from dietary sources, loss of natural selection for maintenance of
energetically expensive biosynthetic pathways, and subsequent loss of their attendant ClpB
chaperones.

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals

Introduction
By the time of the last common ancestor of animals, the uniquely animal process
of gastrulation had evolved. Gastrulation, while diverse in form, is a highly
regulated re-arrangement and migration of cells producing a layered
multicellular body with an internalized “endoderm”-derived digestion system.
Many post-genomic studies have detailed the evolutionary expansion of
eukaryotic transcription factor (TF) families and the emergence of new
developmental genes during this major evolutionary transition [1-5]; these genes
include those controlling the gastrulation program, which is shared from
humans to sponges [6,7]. However, identification of pre-metazoan gene losses
may be equally important because they may indicate the context, origins, and
constraints associated with new transcription programs.
No study has yet focused on systematically identifying genes that are
widely retained in the closest relatives of animals but undetectable in animals
themselves. Such studies require resources and methodologies that have not
been available or mature enough until recently. These include: (i) relevant
genome assemblies; (ii) robust, accurate, orthology-calling pipelines based on
reliable gene annotations; and (iii) powerful gene association engines and data
sets from model genetic systems that would allow candidate losses to be placed
into genetic pathways and regulatory programs. Now, assembled genomes are
increasingly available from such early-branching animal lineages as sponges
(e.g., Amphimedon queenslandica [4]), ctenophores (Mnemiopsis leidyi [8]),
placozoans (Trichoplax adhaerens [9]), as well diverse bilaterians, including
chordate and non-chordate deuterostomes and ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan
protostomes [10]. Also available are genomes of animal’s closest eukaryotic
relatives, including its sister clade of choanoflagellates (Monosiga brevicollis [11]
and Salpingoeca rosetta [12]), as well as filastereans (e.g., Capsaspora owczarzaki
[13]), and diverse fungi from ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and chytridiomycetes
(e.g., Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). In addition, Ensembl’s MaximumLikelihood based orthology-calling pipeline EnsemblCompara [14] and BioMart
query engine [15] can be used to identify candidate lost genes, which can then be
investigated and confirmed with formal phylogenetic analysis on a gene by gene
basis. Finally, powerful algorithms have been designed to query genetic,
transcriptomic, proteomic, and sub-cellular localization data sets and to measure
meaningful enrichment of functional categories [16,17]. Such association
algorithms require large amounts of data and data types for sufficient power.
Arguably, the most comprehensive data is available for the yeast, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. For this reason, this organism is the favored system for understanding
at a quantitative and analytical level how genome-encoded functions interact to
produce complex phenotypes [18,19].
Here we use comparative and integrative genomic approaches to identify
and analyze a set of eukaryotic genes that are retained and detectable in the
closest-living relatives of animals, but are no longer detectable in animals
themselves. Interpreted parsimoniously, these undetectable genes correspond to

3

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
genetic functions lost in the stem-metazoan lineage, which begins just after the
latest common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates and ends just before the
latest common ancestor of animals. We find that the majority of these genes
correspond to lost biosynthetic pathways, including biosynthesis of L-histidine,
L-lysine, riboflavin, and L-tryptophan. Intriguingly, we find specific connections
between the two lost lysine biosynthetic genes, LYS4 and LYS20, and the lost
eukaryotic ClpB chaperones encoded by HSP78 and HSP104, which have roles in
protein folding in the mitochondria and cytoplasm, respectively. Computational
and experimental data suggest that the two ClpB chaperones may work together.
In this study we investigate the hypothesis that, while Hsp78 and Hsp104 are
differentially compartmentalized, they may share a subset of clients in nuclearencoded, cytoplasmically-translated, mitochondrially-imported proteins.
Tandem affinity purification (TAP) of chaperones and identification of
interacting proteins with mass spectrometry (MS) (TAP-MS) data in yeast reveal
that the Hsp104 and Hsp78 interact with Lys4 and Lys20 but not with the
proteins encoded by the other lost genes. Taken together our results are
consistent with the hypothesis that Lys4 and Lys20 are prone to misfolding and
require ClpB chaperones after thermal stress and suggest that some of the genes
identified in our study do not necessarily represent independent losses but may
instead reflect a series of dependent events. Our genomic approach and results
are likely to improve our understanding of evolutionary origins and unique
nature of animal metabolism.

Results
Identification of twenty-five genes retained in choanoflagellates but not
animals.
To identify protein-coding genes retained in the closest eukaryotic relatives of
animals but which are not otherwise detectable in animals (henceforth the “lost
genes”), we made two methodological decisions. First, we chose Saccharomyces
cerevisiae as a reference genome despite the possibility that we would not identify
some lost genes associated with derived traits in the budding yeast. However, by
using the budding yeast we avail ourselves of the large number of existing
genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and sub-cellular localization data sets.
Second, to avoid false-positive gene losses due to deficiencies in assembled
genomes, we sampled diverse non-animal genomes without over-sampling any
particular taxon, and focused on the fewest genomes possible without sacrificing
taxonomic diversity. For Dikarya fungi we worked with the ascomycetes, S.
cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genomes; for the basidiomycetes,
Cryptococcus neoformans and Puccinia graminis (Ensembl BioMart); and for
chytridiomycetes, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (JGI). For Filasterea, we chose
the Capsaspora owczarzaki (Broad Institute) genome [13]. Last, for
choanoflagellates we used Monosiga brevicollis (Joint Genome Institute, JGI) and
the colonial species Salpingoeca rosetta (Broad Institute) [11,20].

4

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
To generate a manageable candidate gene list we used Ensembl’s BioMart
query engine [14,15,21] to iteratively identify orthologs that are present in the
four listed genomes of Dikarya (Fig. 1) but absent in the two bilaterians,
Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, each of which has an excellent genome
assembly with few gaps. We also accepted lineage-specific duplications of a
single shared ancestral gene to avoid losing bona fide candidates arising from
whole genome duplications in any one lineage. Of the 6,692 protein-coding genes
in S. cerevisiae (Ensembl R64-1-1), 802 genes survived this initial screen. We then
queried the Joint Genome Institute’s (JGI) BLASTP server (genome.jgi.doe.gov)
with each yeast protein to identify those for which the predicted protein-coding
sequences from the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis (Monbr1_best_proteins)
matched the yeast proteins with a relatively stringent BLASTP expect value
threshold (E-value lower (better) than 1.0E-30). This reduced our list to 210 yeast
proteins. We used a threshold E-value of 1.0E-10 to remove yeast proteins that
either had no matches or were not detectable for the colonial choanoflagellate S.
rosetta and the filasterean C. owczarzaki. We also removed those that had E-values
in animals smaller (i.e., better) than any of the three listed non-animal holozoans
(the choanoflagellates and filasterean) (Fig. 1). For animals, we used the sponge
Amphimedon queenslandica (NCBI) [4], the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (NHGRI)
[8], the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens (NCBI) [9], and the lophotrochozoans
Lottia gigantea, Capitella teleta, and Helobdella robusta, all of which have complete
genome sequence assemblies [10]. With these genomic comparisons, we find that
there are twenty-seven yeast genes that are largely retained outside of animals in
the genomes we analyzed (Fig. 1, and Table S1). Six of these genes (TRR1/TRR2,
LYS20/LYS21, and SCT1/GPT2) correspond to lineage-specific duplications in
yeast (connected genes in Fig. 1). Thus, we find twenty-four genetic functions
that are definitively lost in animals or at least not retained at the same level of
conservation as they are in non-metazoans.
A heat map of the E-values for the best BLASTP hits in each of the
genomes shows that most “lost” candidate genes are undetectable in metazoans,
but that a few have matches with poor E-values relative to the non-metazoans
(Fig. 1B, Table S1), or else could be shown to be environmental contaminants or
horizontal transfers from distinct taxa (Fig. 1B, taxonomic names given). Some
were found to be non-orthologous sequences that are members of other gene
clades in a superfamily defined by a common domain (Fig. 1B, gene names
given). In only a single case (HIS2) was there a weak match from an animal
genome (Trichoplax adhaerens) that was most closely-related to the orthologous
gene from choanoflagellates or the filasterean Capsaspora. The single possible hit
in Nematostella vectensis for HIS7 (Fig. 1) corresponds to the proteobacterial
version of this gene and not a gene related to opisthokont or eukaryotic HIS7,
and similar results were found for TRP5 and others as indicated (Fig. 1B). One
gene labeled “clpB” in many animals and which matches yeast Hsp104 and
Hsp78, is actually a fusion gene between an N-terminal ankyrin domain and a Cterminal partial sequence of a bacterial clp gene (Fig. S1). Phylogenetic analysis of
this “ANKCLP” fusion gene (Fig. S1) indicates that it arose in the stem-holozoan

5

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
lineage such that it still occurs alongside the HSP104 and HSP78 genes of both
choanoflagellates.
We found that the closest matches in animal sequences to either Hsp104
or Hsp78 are partial fragments of bacterial ClpB in Amphimedon (Fig. 1) or the
unrelated bacterial ClpC in Nematostella (Fig. S1). We used Bayesian Inference
and sampled mixed amino acid substitution models to infer a
ClpB/Hsp78/Hsp104 phylogenetic tree consisting of the fungal and holozoan
sequences as well as the best matches to the 456 amino acid Amphimedon
sequence, which is only half as long as the proteins in the eukaryotic and
bacterial ClpB clades (Fig. 2). Our results definitively place the predicted partial
peptide sequence from Amphimedon in a ClpB clade alongside orthologs from γproteobacteria (Fig. 2). The sequences most closely related to the Amphimedon
fragment are from bacterial endosymbionts of marine tube worms (Fig. 2). This
suggests that this sequence is either an environmental contaminant or a partial
horizontal gene transfer from endosymbiotic bacteria.
The second best match to Hsp104 in metazoans was an even shorter
peptide sequence of 404 amino acids from Nematostella vectensis (Fig. S1). This
predicted peptide sequence most closely matches ClpC peptides from
flavobacteria when the entire database is queried. Queries of Hsp104 sequences
to the taxonomically unrestricted animal database reveal other spurious hits,
which can be discounted for similar reasons (Fig. S1B). Thus, these results
suggest that animals truly lost both Hsp104 and Hsp78.
Non-orthology for some weak matches in animal genomes is seen for the
gene LYS4, which encodes mitochondrial homoaconitase. The closest match in
animals to LYS4 is the ACO1 gene, which encodes the cytoplasmic aconitase of
the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is broadly retained in both animals and nonanimals as expected (Fig. 3A, Bayesian Inference; and Fig. 3B, Neighbor-Joining).
For most lost genes, there are neither orthologs nor distantly related homologs in
animals even when such genes are present in bacteria (e.g., Fig. 3C, LYS20).
To summarize the results of our gene loss approach, we find there are at
least twenty-four highly retained genetic functions that are specifically lost in
animals. To determine the extent to which this query strategy for lost animal
genes is biased by the requirement for presence in fungi, we performed a second
independent query focused on gene families not present in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, a key species in our first analysis. We identified 14 PFAM families
present in the social slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and the choanoflagellate
Monosiga brevicollis, but not in animals (initially Homo sapiens, Drosophila
melanogaster, Nematostella vectensis, Trichoplax adhaerens, and Amphimedon
queenslandica) and the yeast S. cerevisiae. We used the Dictyostelium predicted
protein sequences (19 peptide sequences) corresponding to these 14 PFAM
domains as queries in a BLAST analysis to identify homologs in
choanoflagellates. The Dictyostelium gene PURB (PF08238), which encodes an
adenylosuccinate lyase (467 amino acids), is present in Monosiga brevicollis (2e129), Salpingoeca rosetta (1e-134), and Capsaspora owczarkii (8e-169), but NOT in
fungi or animals. A second Dictyostelium gene PHAZ (PF10503), which encodes a

6

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
putative polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase (341 amino acids), is present as two
copies (paralogs) in each choanoflagellate genome (E-values range from 1e-87 to
4e-76), but we found this to have matches in the non-eumetazoan animal
lineages. In summary, this alternate strategy identified six lost animal genes
(GDH2, HSP104, HSP78, PAN6, PURB, TRR1/2) five of which were identified by
the fungi-based screen (see Fig. 1A, right-hand column). In total, we found
twenty-five distinct gene functions maintained in choanoflagellates (and in fungi
or slime mold) but definitively lost in animals (File S1).

(A) Heat map of twenty-seven genes (first twenty-seven rows with gene names) from the budding
yeast S. cerevisiae (S. cer.) and their orthologs in related organisms with whole genome sequence
assemblies and their closest matches in animals. Six of the twenty-seven yeast genes are the result
of lineage-specific duplications in yeast (indicated by dark gray brackets, left of table), leaving twentyfour genetic functions either lost or not measurably conserved in metazoans. The heat map is based
on the BLASTP expect values of the best match to the indicated yeast gene (see key, lower right of

(see text) in which Amoebozoa PFAM domains that are absent in animals were identified (five genes
already identified plus one new gene, PURB).
(B) Close-up of the lost animal gene columns from panel A. This table shows either the taxonomic
origin of a weak animal match, or the name of the gene if it is not directly related (i.e., not
orthologous) to the named yeast gene (first column) for all matches with BLASTP expectation values
< 1e-20. Most of the animal matches to the candidate lost genes correspond to lineage-specific
horizontal gene transfers and/or environmental contaminants from unrelated (non-opisthokont)
clades. Some matches correspond to non-orthologous genes such as ANKCLP (Fig. S2) in the case
of the eukaryotic clpB genes HSP78 and HSP104, or ACO1 in the case of LYS4 (Fig. 3). Only HIS2
might have been lost soon after early animal radiation based on the presence of a weak match in
Trichoplax adhaerens. This gene is most similar to the version from Capsaspora and not to either of
the two choanoflagellates, so it is of uncertain origin.

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic analyses confirming absence of intact clpB genes in animals.
(A) Phylogenetic inference using Bayesian MCMC methods shows that the closest matching
sequence in known animal genome sequences is a partial ClpB fragment in the sponge Amphimedon
queenslandica. This fragment does not contain both nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) seen in
bacterial or eukaryotic (Hsp78 and Hsp104) ClpB sequences, which are at least 800 amino acids
long. The top three sequence hits in GenBank databases using the Amphimedon ClpB fragment as
query are included. Two of these are intact ClpB protein sequences from bacterial (γ-proteobacteria)
endosymbionts of marine tubeworms. Topological convergence was achieved after 300,000
generations with a relative burn-in phase of 25% (MrBayes) [80-82]. Mixed models were tested, but
WAG [83] was the sole model favored upon completion. Average standard deviation of split
frequencies was < 0.002.The tree was rooted between the bacterial clpB clade, including
mitochondrial Hsp78, and the eukaryotic Hsp104 clade.
(B) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the ClpB family with choanoflagellates and
chytridiomycetes (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Gonapodya prolifera) representing fungal
lineages shows that Hsp78 is the mitochondrially inherited clpB gene based on its sister grouping with
α-proteobacteria. Dikarya sequences were omitted to simplify the tree. Numbers indicate bootstrap
support from 500 replicates using MEGA5 [85]. (C) A simple, unrooted, neighbor-joining tree of the
highly-conserved clpB genes across all of life shows that the ClpB functions are maintained in all
major domains of life and in all endosymbiotic eukaryotic compartments. The ubiquity of the clpB
genes makes the loss in animals more striking.

Fig. 3. Phylogenetic analysis confirming absence of LYS4 and LYS20 in animals.
(A) Phylogenetic inference using Bayesian MCMC methods shows that the closest sequence
matches in animal genome sequences to the LYS4 genes are the ACO1 genes, which encodes the
aconitase enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Choanoflagellates (triangles) have LYS4 and
ACO1 but animals (squares) have only ACO1. The tree is rooted between the two gene clades for
Lys4 and Aco1.
(B) A representative neighbor-joining (NJ) tree shows the presence of LYS4 (blue) and ACO2 (pink)
in choanoflagellates (triangles), but not in animals (squares), for which sequences could not be found.
One related gene ACO1 (maroon), which encodes an enzymatic activity of the TCA cycle, is still
present in animals, while LEU1 (mustard yellow), a second related gene, involved in the leucine
biosynthesis as part of the branched chain amino acid pathway, is lost in both choanoflagellates and
animals. ACO2 could not be found in the colonial choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca rosetta. Numbers
indicate bootstrap support from 500 replicates. The tree is rooted between the Leu1 outgroup clade
and theLys4/Aco1/Aco2 superclade.
(C) A representative neighbor-joining tree shows the presence of LYS20/21 gene in choanoflagellates
(triangles) and other organisms. LYS20 and LYS21 correspond to yeast specific duplications of this
genetic function. No related homologs are found in animals (Fig. 1). Distantly-related bacterial
outgroups do however possess these genes. The tree is rooted between the eukaryotic Lys20/21
clade and the bacterial (Deinococcus-Thermus) gene clade.

Animal-specific co-loss of the ClpB chaperones, Hsp78 and Hsp104.
Both HSP104 and HSP78 are nuclear encoded eukaryotic orthologs of bacterial
clpB, and encode AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities)
family ATPases with two P-loop nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Together
with an N terminal domain, the two NBDs form a three tier hexameric ring with
a central pore through which misfolded, aggregated peptides are translocated
prior to refolding [22,23]. Hsp78 localizes and functions in the mitochondria [2426], while Hsp104 localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus [27]. Because of
Hsp104’s role in amyloid/cross-β disaggregation in yeast [28], the reason for the
loss of the highly-conserved gene HSP104 in animals has been a source of much
speculation [29].
In eukaryotes, the nuclear encoded HSP78 gene was acquired from the
mitochondrial ancestor [30]. Our phylogenetic analyses repeatedly confirm that
choanoflagellates, like fungi, have both HSP78 and HSP104, which correspond to
the mitochondrial and eukaryotic clpB orthologs that are absent in animals (Fig.
2B; also see close relationship of HSP78 clade to α-proteobacterial clpB). The loss
of these genes in the stem-metazoan lineage is more remarkable when
considering that all organisms and organelles (e.g., eukaryotic mitochondrion,
plant chlorplast), except those in animals, appear to retain ClpB functions, even
when such genes are transferred to the nucleus (Fig. 2C).

HSP104 and HSP78 are co-regulated by a specialized cis-element, HSE4.
To explore the possibility that joint loss of the ClpB orthologs reflects a joint
requirement and/or a joint function for the proteins, we examined their
regulation and, as described below, we also assessed their double mutant
phenotype. To test the presence of shared clpB regulatory signatures, we initially
focused on S. cerevisiae, for which predictions of co-regulation could be
confirmed independently by gene expression meta-analyses of the large number
of published transcriptome studies in yeast [31]. Regulatory motifs common to
the upstream regions of the S. cerevisiae HSP78 and HSP104 genes were identified
using BLASTN-based dot plot analysis. A comparison of 320 bp regions
upstream of the HSP78 and HSP104 open reading frames (Fig. 4A) revealed three
serially-aligned blocks of sequence whose length is consistent with their function
as possible protein binding sites (Fig. 4B) and that are found in orthologous loci
in other Saccharomyces species (Fig. 4C, track 6). These analyses led to the
identification of three shared signature features (Fig. 4C): (i) an Hsf1 binding
Element characterized by a series of four inverted 5’-nGAAn repeats [32-36]
shown in blue (HSE4, track 3), and in red and orange (DP-I = dot-plot motif 1,
tracks 1 and 2); (ii) a triplet array of Stress-Response Element (STREs) that bind
the paralogous zinc finger transcription factors, Msn2 and Msn4 [37,38]; and (iii)
a core promoter element that resembles a TATA-box with additional sequences
immediately downstream (DP-III, track 5). Binding of Hsf1 to the HSE and
binding of Msn2, and Msn4 to the STRE have been observed under oxidative
stress, heat shock, and acid treatment as well as for growth in rich media (YPD)
[39].
To determine whether the shared HSP104 and HSP78 motifs are in
general use or specific to the clpB genes, we conducted whole-genome searches
for each sequence. A search of the S. cerevisiae genome using an IUPAC
consensus of the extended dot plot motif DP-I revealed that the HSP78 and
HSP104 loci are the only two in S. cerevisiae with the DP-1 motif (Table 1, Model
1).
To identify highly similar variants, we implemented a position-weighted
matrix (PWM) description of DP-I (Table 1, Model 2). This more permissive
model identified 12 loci, half of which are related to a specific subset of proteins
involved in various aspects of unfolded protein binding, disaggregation, and
refolding. For example, one of the 12 loci corresponds to the promoter for SSA1,
which encodes a member of the Hsp70/DnaK family of chaperones [40], which
bind unfolded proteins to promote proper re-folding and prevent aggregation. In
yeast, Ssa1 has known roles in disassembling misfolded protein aggregates
together with Hsp104 [41], and in localizing mRNAs to the outer mitochondrial
membrane for co-translational translocation and import into the mitochondria
[42]. Hsp70-family proteins also interact with Hsp78. In conjunction with the
mtHsp70 chaperone Ssc1, Hsp78 resolubilizes proteins from insoluble aggregates
within mitochondria. Ssc1 is also involved in mitochondrial inner membrane
import and refolding.

To improve our first PWM model, we constructed a second PWM
descriptor based on the HSE4s upstream of the two clpB orthologs as well as
SSA1 (Table 1, Model 3). With this modified PWM-based model, fewer matches
in ORFs, which are likely spurious, and an additional match in the promoter for
the ubiquitin-encoding locus, UBI4, were identified. Ubiquitin is conjugated to
misfolded proteins, marking them for proteolysis rather than refolding. Thus,
this PWM descriptor improves the precision of the model with 7 loci of 9
involved in the disaggregation of misfolded proteins, their refolding, or their
proteolysis. Sequence alignments of these targets indicate that the clpB-type
HSE4 defines a set of four inverted repeats with the sequence 5’-nGAAn, which
can also be described as two pairs of the palindrome 5’-TTCyrGAA separated by 2
bp (IUPAC DNA code: y = C or T, and r = A or G, n = any letter).
To test the significance of the central “YR” in the HSE4 motif, we queried
the genome with an HSE4 motif in which these residues are not specified (Table
1, Model 4). We identified only 12 loci, including one new proteostasis gene,
HSP42, which encodes a small heat shock protein that plays an important role in
aggregate sorting and mediating the retention of misfolded proteins including
amyloids in a peripheral cellular compartment [43,44]. The idealized (perfectly
palindromic) HSE4 element, 5’-TTCyrGAAnnTTCyrGAA, is found at only six loci
(SSA1, HSP78, BTN2, UBI4, HSP104, SIS1) in the entire genome, all of which are
located at promoters of genes involved in protein homeostasis, including both
clpB orthologs (Table 1, Model 5). SIS1, like APJ1 (Table 1, Model 3) encodes a Jdomain (DnaJ) family member that functions as co-chaperones to specific Hsp70
(DnaK) chaperones [45,46]. The BTN2 gene encodes a sorting factor that
accumulates in stressed cells to promote the transit of misfolded proteins to
specific protein deposition sites, which are determined by alternative complex
formation between Btn2 and Hsp42 (Table 1, Model 4) or Sis1 [44,47,48]. The
results of these analyses are consistent with the hypothesis that yeast HSP78 and
HSP104 are co-expressed together with a small set of other protein folding genes.
This suggests that the two ClpB chaperones may participate in a single process
related to protein homeostasis.
To investigate whether yeast HSP78 and HSP104 are indeed co-regulated,
we used the SPELL (Serial Pattern of Expression Levels Locator) algorithm and
query engine to survey their transcriptional correlation across 9,190 gene
expression microarray experiments [31]. We found that HSP78 was most
significantly co-expressed with HSP104 and HSP42 (red arrow in Fig. 4D left
panel). Similarly, HSP104 was most significantly co-expressed with HSP42 and
HSP78 (red arrow in Fig. 4D center panel). Furthermore, HSP78 alone, HSP104
alone, and HSP78 plus HSP104 in combination are co-regulated with diverse Jdomain proteins and Hsp70/DnaK co-chaperones, which are known to stabilize
unfolded protein states, respectively (J and K in Fig. 4D). This Hsp70 chaperone
machinery is also co-expressed with other HSE4-associated genes such as HSP42,
BTN2, UBI4, supporting the functional reliability of the HSE4 signature (Fig. 4D).

HSE4 regulation of the clpB genes is conserved in choanoflagellates.
To determine whether HSE4 regulation is also present in the choanoflagellates
we looked for HSE4 signatures in the M. brevicollis and S. rosetta genomes, which
maintain the clpB genes. Our analysis of the S. rosetta genes revealed the presence
of a consensus HSE4 sequence upstream of the HSP78 gene and a near consensus
HSE4 sequence upstream of HSP104. We identified a total of 5 additional HSE4
sequences in genome-wide searches for a consensus HSE4 (Table 2). One HSE4 is
located upstream of UBA1. Three additional HSE4s are found upstream of
unrelated genes, and one lies within an open reading frame. UBA1 encodes a
ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme, which catalyzes the first step in
ubiquitin conjugation, marking proteins for degradation. HSE4 regulation of
UBA1 in the choanoflagellate is reminiscent of HSE4 regulation of ubiquitin
(UBI4) in S. cerevisiae.
We also find more extended Hsf1 binding arrays, here “HSE4+” elements,
at the clpB loci of the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis and chytrid fungus B.
dendrobatidis. These match so-called extended “skipped HSE” motifs [32] in
which the pattern consists of five or six inverted 5’-nGAAn repeats (HSE5, HSE6)
with one or more missing internal triplet TTC’s or GAA’s. For these genomes, we
can derive lineage-specific consensus signatures that are specific to a small clpB
regulon. For example, in M. brevicollis we find a consensus skipped HSE at
exactly 6 loci that include HSP104, HSP78, and an Hsp70 gene, while in the
chytrid B. dendrobatidis we find only five loci, including HSP78 and HSP104, with
either an HSE4 (5’-TTC..GAA..TTC..GAA) or a skipped HSE5 (5’TTC..GAA..TTC..G....TTC). Last, we note that even in the yeast S. cerevisiae
there is a single locus matching a skipped HSE5 motif, although in this case it is a
perfect HSE5 (i.e., not skipped) and is associated with the SIS1 DnaJ-encoding
locus that we already identified as having an HSE4 motif. Overall, these results
show that the archetypical HSE4/HSE4+ elements are ancestral to a small regulon
that includes HSP78 and HSP104 and that these genes evolve with only modest
changes to the Hsf1 binding site motif.

Eukaryotic ClpB promoter architecture is unique and shared.
To identify the extent to which the clpB promoter architecture is present in the S.
cerevisiae genome, we searched for the combination of the HSE4 motif and the
STRE cluster. We relaxed the stringency of the combined motifs until we found
the closest matching sequences. For example, a search for all 160 bp windows
containing at least three STREs (5’-CCCCT) and a match to either a skipped (5’TTCnnGAAnnnnnnnGAA) (Table 1, Model 6) or an end-clipped HSE4 (5’CnnGAAnnTTCnnG) identifies the same three loci: HSP42, HSP78, and HSP104.
The spacing of the triplet cluster at HSP42 is not similar to that found at clpB
promoters and the STRE elements at HSP42 are not conserved across the
Saccharomyces genus [49], nor is the HSP42 family found in choanoflagellates.

20

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
Thus, yeast HSP78 and HSP104 are uniquely associated with a shared promoter
architecture, one element of which (HSE4s and skipped HSE5/6 arrays) is still
uniquely associated with their orthologous promoters in choanoflagellate
genomes.

Absence of Hsp78 exacerbates hsp104 mutant thermosensitivity.
The co-regulation and co-expression of both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic ClpB
functions is consistent with a potential joint function. To experimentally assess
this hypothesis, we tested in S. cerevisiae whether a phenotypically normal hsp78
deletion had any effect on hsp104 mutant thermosensitivity. In these experiments,
single and double mutants were subjected to extreme heat (50oC) in rich media
(YPD) following pre-exposure to mild heat sufficient to induce HSP104 and
HSP78 gene expression. As expected, survival of the hsp78 deletion mutant was
indistinguishable from that of wild type (p = 0.9) and viability of the hsp104
mutant was reduced relative to that of wild type strains (Fig. 5A). This is
consistent with previous reports showing that hsp104 deletion strains are
measurably thermosensitive [50-52] while hsp78 deletion strains have more
subtle effects when heat stressed [24-26,53-55]. However, we found that the hsp78
hsp104 double mutant was significantly more sensitive than hsp104 single mutant
(~10-fold difference, p = 0.0005) suggesting that Hsp78 contributes to induced
thermotolerance in the absence of Hsp104, although it has no appreciable effect
in its presence (Fig. 5A). This revealed for the first time that survival in extreme
heat depends on the presence of both compartmentalized ClpB functions.
Together with the observation of co-loss and co-regulation of clpB orthologs, this
result leads us to postulate a shared ClpB function.

Yeast interactome indicates that the ClpB proteins share specific
protein clients.
Connections between the lost genetic functions can be inferred from gene
association algorithms (e.g., GeneMania [16,17]) that identify physical or genetic
interactions among the lost genes. We identified several links between genes in
the different biosynthetic pathways (blue nodes in Fig. 6A) and other lost genes
that may be informative upon further study. Here, we focus on several physical
links connecting both of the ClpB chaperones (red nodes in Fig. 6A) with Lys4
and Lys20. Lys20 and Lys4 occupy early steps in the α-aminoadipate lysine
biosynthesis pathway, which is found in a small group of thermophilic archaea
and bacteria and in non-metazoan eukaryotes [56-58]. Lys20 is the mitochondrial
isoform of homocitrate synthase that exerts most of the flux control in lysine
biosynthesis in yeast [59], while Lys4 encodes mitochondrial homoaconitase, a
4Fe-4S iron-sulfur protein [60].
The observation that Hsp78 and Hsp104 each make specific contacts with
Lys4 and Lys20 (Fig. 6A) despite their compartmentalized roles, leads us to
propose that clpB-encoded chaperones Hsp104 and Hsp78 were lost because of
“lost shared clients” that included Lys4 and Lys20, but may also have included
other nuclear-encoded, cytoplasmically-translated, and mitochondrially
imported proteins. This idea is investigated further below.

Lys4 and Lys20 interact specifically with RAC and ClpB chaperone
systems.
If Lys4 and Lys20 are heat-labile clients specifically disaggregated by Hsp78 and
Hsp104 after heat denaturation, they are likely also to require folding assistance
de novo during translation and/or co-translationally with mitochondrial import.
We examined whether Lys4 and Lys20 make specific contacts with the ribosomeassociated chaperone (RAC), which is important for de novo folding during
translation and leads to aggregation when compromised [61-63]. The RAC/Ssb
system is also required during co-translational translocation into subcellular
compartments [64]. RAC is composed of the Hsp70 family chaperone Ssz1 tightly
associated with its J-domain co-chaperone Zuo1 and more loosely with a second
Hsp70 family member, Ssb (Ssb1 or Ssb2). To investigate the role of RAC in Lys4
and Lys20 folding, we used experimental interaction data to construct the
interactome among the Lys4 and Lys20 proteins, the RAC system and various
Hsp70/DnaK and J-domain/DnaJ proteins that we identified in our gene
regulatory analyses (Fig. 6B).
These analyses show that Lys4 and Lys20 interact with RAC machinery
and the ClpBs but not with other Hsp70 chaperones and DnaJ co-chaperones. For
example, Lys4 interacts physically with both components of RAC (the Hsp70
Ssz1 and its dedicated J-domain co-chaperone Zuo1), and with the ribosomal
Hsp70s Ssb1 and Ssb2, which work in conjunction with RAC (Fig. 6B). But Lys4
does not interact with diverse other cytoplasmic (Sse2, Ssa4, Ssa1) or

24

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
mitochondrial (Ssc1) Hsp70s nor with J-domain family members (Sis1, Ydj1,
Apj1, Mdj1), several of which (SSE2, SSA4, SSA1, SIS1, MDJ1) are co-expressed
with the clpBs (Fig. 4D), or definitively co-regulated with the clpBs (SSA1, SIS1,
APJ1) (Table 1) based on the presence of HSE4 elements. A similar result was
seen for Lys20. We thus propose that unfolded Lys20 and Lys4 are recognized by
RAC during translation as nascent unfolded polypeptides and again by ClpBs
after post-translational heat denaturation.

pathway.

Other Fe/S proteins in same superfamily are lost in choanoflagellates
and animals.
If Lys4 and Lys20 were lost in animals due to their deleterious misfolding
properties, then other proteins with similar structures may have had similar
fates. Indeed, additional Lys4 superfamily proteins containing 4Fe-4S clusters
(Fig. 7A) were also lost in the evolution of animals. We looked for examples in
which other Lys4 superfamily members were lost in choanoflagellates and had
therefore escaped our initial screen for losses in the stem-metazoan lineage.
While Lys4 is absent in animals but present in choanoflagellates (Table 1 and
Table S1), we found that ACO2 is absent in animals and the colonial
choanoflagellate S. rosetta, but present in the unicellular choanoflagellate, M.
brevicollis, and that LEU1 and ILV3 are absent in both animals and
choanoflagellates (Fig. 7B). Like Lys4, both Ilv3 and Aco2 receive their Fe/S
clusters in the mitochondria [60] although Leu1 is a cytoplasmic enzyme [58].
Fe/S proteins have two special properties; first, the free iron that is presumably
released upon stress-mediated denaturation can generate hydroxyl radicals,
which are one type of insidious reactive oxygen species (ROS) [65,66]. Second,
Fe/S cluster proteins are highly susceptible to inactivation by superoxide, which
accumulates and contributes to the loss of viability in heat stressed cells [6770].Thus, Lys4, which is among the most highly conserved proteins in our list of
twenty-four lost genetic functions (Fig. 1, Table S1), may be especially heat labile
and prone to ROS generation when misfolded in the presence of oxygen. The
same may be true of other Lys4 relatives. We therefore speculate that this class of
protein may require dedicated folding machinery.
Hydrophobic amino acids, which are normally packed into the interior of
a peptide, are recognized by yeast Hsp104 when exposed in unfolded aggregates
and when added to model clients increase their recognition after denaturation
[71]. We therefore compared the hydrophobicity of the Fe/S coordination pocket
of Lys4 with that of Aco1, which is maintained in animals. We first aligned the
yeast and choanoflagellate peptide sequences from these proteins, including
those from Aco2 and annotated the family-specific residues for Lys4 (cyan
shading in Fig. 7C) and Aco1 (gray shading). We found that 41.4% (12/29) of the
conserved Lys4-specific residues are hydrophobic compared with 22.8% of the
conserved Aco1-specific residues (Fig. 7D). As the hydrophobic content of a
protein is likely to be positively correlated with aggregation after heat
denaturation, the two-fold enrichment in Lys4 relative to Aco1 is likely to pose a
significant cellular challenge.

Discussion
Hsp78 and Hsp104 chaperones function coordinately and may have
common clients in Lys4 and Lys20.
Here we show for the first time that Hsp78 and Hsp104 (i) were both definitively
lost in an ancestor of animals despite their presence in all non-animals; (ii) were
uniquely co-regulated by a multimeric and ordered array of perfect binding sites
for Heat Shock Factor 1 (Hsf1) in an ancestor of animals based on the shared
presence and restricted use of this regulatory signature in fungal and
choanoflagellate genomes; (iii) function together in thermotolerance (Fig. 5A);
and (iv) make specific contacts with Lys4 and Lys20, two nuclear encoded,
mitochondrial enzymes (Fig. 6A and 6B).
These results are consistent with the idea that specific mitochondrial
biosynthetic enzymes are shared clients of both ClpBs and could be pertinent to
their joint loss at the base of animals. We propose that cytoplasmic Hsp104
disaggregates and refolds nuclear-encoded, cytoplasmically translated
mitochondrial enzymes such as Lys4 and Lys20 that are also re-folded by Hsp78
in the mitochondria. However, exactly how compartmentalized Hsp104 and
Hsp78 chaperones could share mitochondrial clients is unclear. One idea is that
there are parallel co-translational import and mitochondrial targeting pathways
for getting Lys4 into the mitochondrial matrix. In this case, Lys4 apoprotein en
route to the mitochondria might exist as a cytoplasmic pool that is prone to
misfolding and aggregation. A second idea is that thermally denatured,
incompletely translocated Lys4 enzymes might escape into the cytoplasm, which
would create a need for maintaining a cytoplasmic ClpB activity. Finally, a third
possibility is that Lys4 is able to escape via compromised mitochondrial
membranes, which are thermosensitive. For example, even mild heat (37°C),
sufficient to induce the ClpB chaperones, results in a 5-fold increase in
mitochondrial leakage based on the transfer of mitochondrial DNA to the
nucleus [72].
Despite our findings of a possible Lys4-ClpB client-chaperone
relationship, it is not likely that Lys4 was the only client of the ClpBs in the stemmetazoan lineage. First, yeast data has implicated several clients of Hsp104 [73].
Second, ClpBs are conserved in plants and bacteria, but Lys4 is not, because
plants and most bacteria utilize a lysine biosynthesis pathway different from the
one in opisthokonts [56]. For these reasons, we suspect that the ClpBs in animals
were lost not so much because a single dedicated client was lost, but because a
threshold number of clients were lost.

A cascade of gene loss in the stem-metazoan lineage.
Our results suggest that many metabolic genes were lost in the stem-metazoan
lineage (Fig. 1). This may reflect wholesale reduction of biosynthetic capacity in

31

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
favor of obligate high-throughput filter feeding and could be due to the trophic
benefits of multicellular organization, allowing biosynthetic precursors to be
derived as nutrients from dietary sources. For example, sponges, which have
diverse complex multicellular chambers for pumping and filtering water, are
known to take up and remove up to 99% of bacteria and 94% of small eukaryotes
from the water that they filter [74,75]. Thus, we propose that the stem-metazoan
innovation resulting in efficient dietary intake of picoplankton via grazing
and/or filtering is likely to have resulted in loss of selection of certain
biosynthetic pathways because it became more energetically efficient to obtain
them from feeding rather than from biosynthesis. We suggest that this working
hypothesis may lead to deeper insights into the evolutionary emergence of
specialized-feeding surfaces and the forerunners of the “gastraea” [76].
Based on our finding of specific gene losses, we propose a two-step
model in which loss of biosynthetic enzymes (step 1) is followed by secondary
loss of attendant chaperones (step 2). This model is supported by several
additional observations in choanoflagellates. First, we note that the TRP2 gene,
which encodes the first enzyme in the energetically-costly tryptophan
biosynthetic pathway is not as well conserved in choanoflagellates as the
intermediate enzyme encoded by TRP3, and is more poorly conserved than
TRP5, which encodes the final enzyme in tryptophan synthesis (Fig. 1 and Table
S1). Thus the extent of conservation is co-linear with position along the
biosynthetic pathway, consistent with the possibility that choanocyte-type filter
feeding [77] and possibly facultative coloniality in this lineage led to reduced
selection of the early components of this pathway while the final biosynthetic
enzymes were maintained for the ability to complete tryptophan biosynthesis
using intermediate precursors provided by ingested microorganisms. Second, in
the course of testing various computational approaches to gene loss, we
discovered that some “lost” animal genes are present in the unicellular
choanoflagellate M. brevicollis but not in the facultatively colonial [12]
choanoflagellate S. rosetta or in animals (e.g., ACO2 in Fig. 3B). Third, we did not
find any of the genes encoding enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways for the
branched chain amino acids, (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), in either animals or
choanoflagellates. These amino acids are three of the ten essential amino acids
animals must retrieve from their dietary intake. The pattern of metabolic gene
loss in choanoflagellates suggests that (i) specific metabolic gene losses had
already occurred in the stem-holozoan ancestor or were underway with
holozoan divergence; (ii) additional metabolic gene losses were sustained during
the divergence of choanoflagellates and animals (e.g., ACO2); (iii) gene losses in
choanoflagellates began with genes encoding enzymes at the beginning of
pathways (e.g., Trp enzymes); and (iv) metabolic genes were more completely
lost with the evolution of animals. These results are likely to prove fundamental
for understanding formative events in the evolution of the metabolic physiology
of the animal kingdom.

Materials and Methods
Comparative genomics. Ensembl’s BioMart tool [21] was used iteratively to
query, sort, and identify orthology calls [78,79] for Ensembl Genes Release 75
(www.ensembl.org) and Ensembl Fungi Genes Release 22 (fungi.ensembl.org).
The choanoflagellate genome of Monosiga brevicollis (v1.0) was queried from the
Joint Genome Institute databases (genome.jgi.doe.gov), the Salpingoeca rosetta
genome from Broad Institute databases (www.broadinstitute.org/). Note that
BioMart orthology calls are specific to a release set of genome comparisons and
that orthology calls sometimes change with each Release. All genomes were also
queried using taxonomic specification at NCBI’s BLASTP server, except for the
ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, which is available via National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI) server (research.nhgri.nih.gov/mnemiopsis).
Homologs for fungal lineages outside of Ascomycetes and other non-fungal
lineages were selected following BLASTP analysis of specific genomes using S.
cerevisiae proteins as queries. Additional filtering using E-value thresholds is
described in the text. Data from a Boolean-type PFAM taxonomy search
(Dictyostelium protein domains absent in yeast and animals) was conducted at
http://pfam.xfam.org. The identified PFAM domain IDs were then used to
retrieve the protein sequences using BioMart [15,21]. These sequences were used
in a BLASTP query of choanoflagellates. Orthologs of lost genes from S. cerevisiae
or D. discoideum are listed in File S1.
Phylogenetic analyses. Alignments were produced using ClustalW. Bayesian
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses were conducted using MrBayes [80-82] and
initial runs sampled diverse fixed amino acid rate matrices, but most data sets
overwhelmingly supported the WAG [83] (ClpB trees) or Jones/JTT [84] (Lys4
trees) models after the 25% burn-in phase. Topological convergence was defined
as having achieved an average standard deviation of split frequencies < 0.01, but
we typically achieved < 0.002. Maximum Likelihood and exploratory NeighborJoining trees were conducted in MEGA5 and MEGA6 [85,86] typically using
Jones/JTT matrices and a gamma distributions with shape parameters spanning
0.7 to 1.0 with replicate boot strap support based on 500 replicates. Alignment
files and supporting Bayesian analysis files are archived in File S2.
Gene Association Analysis. Gene association data pertaining to individual
chaperones was retrieved from ChaperoneDB (chaperonedb.ccbr.utoronto.ca)
and uploaded to GeneMania [16,17] (www.genemania.org). Evidence for
physical interactions is represented by red edges, evidence for genetic
interactions is shown by green edges and predictions based on selected data
imported from the global TAP tag MS dataset [73] is shown by gray edges.
Regulatory Bioinformatics. Identification of matching cis-regulatory patterns in
whole-genome sequences were conducted by downloading text files of each
respective genome, removing newlines, and searching for blocks of sequence

33

Chaperone-Client Gene Loss in Origin of Animals
containing the indicated patterns (Tables 1 and 2). These searches were
conducted using regular expression patterning matching in simple UNIX shell
scripts incorporating perl, grep, and standard shell commands. BLASTN-based
dot plot analysis was conducted using a window size of 320 bp for sequences
upstream of S. cerevisiae HSP78 (vertical) and HSP104 (horizontal) open reading
frames. Known transcription factor binding sites at listed positions were
retrieved using the UCSC genome browser [39,49]. Conserved non-coding
sequences (CNSs) were determined from comparisons of corresponding
orthologs. Transcriptional correlation scores correspond to the Adjusted
Correlation Scores for 430 datasets representing 9190 total arrays from 286
published studies queried via SPELL [31] (Serial Pattern of Expression Levels
Locator) and available through the Saccharomyces Genome Database
(spell.yeastgenome.org).
Yeast Strains and Survival Assay. Yeast strains were constructed by mating and
tetrad dissection of diploids starting with strains from the MATα haploid
deletion collection (BY4742). Deletion collection strains were mated with BY4730
and diploids sporulated and dissected to generate LYS2+ derivatives of the hsp78
and hsp104 mutants (hsp78: JF2478, JF2479, JF2480 and hsp104: JF2473, JF2474 and
JF2498). These strains were crossed to generate the double hsp78 hsp104 mutants
(JF2494, JF2495, JF2516). Strain genotypes are provided in Table S2 in File S3. clpB
genotypes were confirmed by colony PCR using a forward primer upstream of
the deletion and a reverse primers within the kanMX cassette. Primer sequences
are provided in Table S3 in File S3.
Survival was assayed by colony forming unit (cfu) assays. Cultures were
grown to saturation in YPD at 30°C, then subcultured and grown to log phase
under the same conditions. Log phase cultures were shifted to 37°C for between
40–60 minutes and then diluted (1:1) into ice-cold water or diluted similarly into
50°C YPD media for 20 minutes. Cultures were then serially diluted and plated
on YPD. Colony number was used to calculate the concentration of survivors for
each strain and each treatment condition. Values for individual strains were
averaged. SD, standard deviation.
