Abstract. Ecosystems often undergo abrupt regime shifts in response to gradual external
changes. These shifts are theoretically understood as a regime switch between alternative stable
states of the ecosystem dynamical response to smooth changes in external conditions. Usual
models introduce nonlinearities in the macroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different
stable attractors among which the shift takes place. Here we propose an alternative explanation of
catastrophic regime shifts based on a recent model that pictures ecological communities as systems
in continuous fluctuation, according to certain transition probabilities, between different microstates in the phase space of viable communities. We introduce a spontaneous extinction rate that
accounts for gradual changes in external conditions, and upon variations on this control parameter
the system undergoes a regime shift with similar features to those previously reported. Under our
microscopic viewpoint we recover the main results obtained in previous theoretical and empirical
work (anomalous variance, hysteresis cycles, trophic cascades). The model predicts a gradual loss
of species in trophic levels from bottom to top near the transition. But more importantly, the
spectral analysis of the transition probability matrix allows us to rigorously establish that we are
observing the fingerprints, in a finite size system, of a true phase transition driven by background
extinctions.

Catastrophic regime shifts in model ecological communities are true phase transitions

1. Introduction
Ecosystems are exposed to continuous changes in external conditions. Seasonal changes of
environmental conditions, climate oscillations, variations in the amount of resources and nutrient
loading, habitat fragmentation, harvest or loss of species diversity are a few examples of these
gradual changes. They often change slowly, even linearly, with time [1]. It is usually assumed
that the response of the system to external changes is smooth most of the times. However,
occasionally sudden changes can occur. For example, the sudden loss of transparency and
vegetation observed in shallow lakes due to human-induced effects [2]; corals overgrown by macroalgae in the Caribbean reef seem to shift between two stable states rather than responding
smoothly to external conditions [3, 4]; or in savannahs, sparse trees with a grass layer can switch
to a dense woody state as a result of the alternation in fire and grazing regimes [5, 6]. All
these phenomena share the feature that ecosystems seem to change between two different stable
states. Sudden changes between two regimes are the so-called catastrophic shifts [7]. Hence, when
subjected to a slowly changing external control variable, ecological communities may show little
change until a critical point is reached. Then a sudden switch to a contrasting state can occur.
The simplest theoretical explanation to catastrophic regime shifts comes from the existence
of alternative stable states in the dynamical ecosystem response to gradual changes. The shift
between two alternative stable states is responsible for the transition. Often the existence
of different stable states is associated to nonlinearities. A non-linear ecosystem response to
smooth external variations allows for the existence of alternative stable states [7, 8]. The
effects of nonlinearities have also been observed in natural communities. For example, it has
been established that the non-linear dynamics of overexploited marine ecosystems magnifies the
variability in the abundance of exploited species [9, 10].
In these models, ecosystems are described from a macroscopic viewpoint. Usually a global
magnitude, representative of the whole community, is used as fundamental variable (for instance,
the total biomass density). Models are basically devised to describe the time evolution of this
magnitude by means of non-linear functional responses [7, 11]. Recently this paradigm has
been applied to spatially extended interacting communities [12, 13]. This theoretical approach
is conceptually very similar to the traditional thermodynamic explanation of phase transitions
in physical systems, such as the liquid-vapor transition. The lack of convexity of theoretical
thermodynamic potentials —such as free energy— leads to alternative stable states corresponding
to liquid and vapor and both phases coexist below a certain critical temperature. In [11, 12, 13]
the analogy is very clear. The dynamics of biomass density follows a logistic growth with carrying
capacity K and a density-dependent consumption term modelled as a sigmoidal (Holling’s type III)
functional response. It is precisely this type of functional response which allows for the existence
of two separate, stable equilibrium points in the dynamics above a certain critical value of the
carrying capacity.
However, the current understanding of phase transitions in physical systems goes beyond
phenomenological, macroscopic models. The microscopic approach of Statistical Mechanics
represents a more fundamental way of understanding phase transitions, and many elaborated

theories have been developed to account for abrupt shifts in physical systems. Our aim in this
paper is to propose an alternative explanation, based mainly in a microscopic approach, to these
catastrophic regime shifts in ecosystems. In fact, we will show that a linear functional response in
the dynamics of individual species can lead to a global shift in the ecosystem between a species-rich
attractor and a state with low species richness. The early-warnings that are usually mentioned
as precursors of catastrophic regimes, like the increasing fluctuations near the transition [9, 14] or
the appearance of trophic cascades [15], will be recovered within our framework.
Based on an assembly model introduced recently [16, 17, 18], that pictures ecosystems
as complex, stable entities which keep on fluctuating between different micro-states through
successional invasions of rare species, we will introduce a background species extinction rate
accounting for the gradual, external variations to which natural communities are subjected. We
will find a threshold rate above which the system undergoes a phase transition, and the rate will
play the role of the shift control parameter. We will show that fluctuations become critical in
the vicinity of the transition, and that the ultimate collapse of the ecosystem correspond to a
gradual loss of species from bottom to top. It is worth remarking that trophic cascades have been
recognized as signals of overexploitation in marine communities [15].
The main feature of the assembly model presented in [16] is to provide a complete
characterization of the phase space of the system. The time evolution of the system is fully
described by means of a Markov chain. Under the effect of increased spontaneous extinctions, an
initially species-rich ecosystem can move to a region of the phase space where the species richness
decreases. Through a spectral analysis of the transition probability matrix we will be able to
show rigorously that the shift we observe corresponds to the “trace” of a true phase transition
—according to the definition of Statistical Mechanics— in finite size.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we will review the main features of the
assembly model and discuss the effect of a background species extinction rate in the ecosystem.
We will find that the Markov process is ergodic and that there is an increasing probability of
finding the ecosystem close to extinction as the rate grows. In Section 3 we will study some
signals with anomalous behavior near the shift, and show under which conditions hysteresis in
the average number of species arise. In Section 4 we will show that the observed behavior would
correspond to a true phase transition were the system infinitely large. So we can conclude that
what we are actually observing are the fingerprints of this transition in systems of finite size.
2. Background species extinction
Our starting point is a simple assembly model that we have recently introduced [16]. Let us
briefly summarize its main features. We describe ecological communities introducing three basic
simplifications. First, species are arranged in a finite number of trophic levels, and feeding
relationships take place exclusively between contiguous trophic levels. Second, the strength of
interactions is averaged over the whole community (mean-field), thus all species at the same
level are trophically equivalent. And third, population dynamics is modelled by Lotka-Volterra
equations. In spite of these oversimplifications, the resulting communities reproduce all results

Catastrophic regime shifts in model ecological communities are true phase transitions

previously found in earlier assembly models [16, 19, 20].
The mean-field assumption allows us to represent each community by the set of occupancy
numbers of each trophic level, {s` }L`=1 , L being the total number of levels and s` the number
of species at level `. All species are considered as consumers, with uniform intrinsic average
mortality rate α. Predation between adjacent levels is modelled by constants γ+ and γ− . The
former represents the per-capita rate of increase in population due to feeding, the latter accounts
for the mean damage caused by being predated. Communities are sustained by a primary, abiotic
resource characterized by its intrinsic growth rate R. This represents the saturation value that the
resource reaches at equilibrium in absence of predation, and measures the energy influx available
for each community. Species at the first trophic level predate on this resource and transfer the
energy upwards in the food web. Increasing R has the effect of allowing more trophic levels and
more species in each level as well (see [16]).
Population dynamics is ruled by Lotka-Volterra equations, which guarantees the existence
of a unique interior equilibrium point. Equilibrium communities whose populations are above of
a given extinction threshold nc are considered as viable. For a full account on the population
dynamics and the implications of the invasion dynamics in this model, we refer the reader to [17].
Our model represents a substantial improvement with respect to former assembly models in
that it provides a complete characterization of all possible invasion pathways within the set of
viable communities. Equivalently, an assembly graph G, i.e. the graph whose nodes are viable
communities and whose links connect communities through invasions, can be fully obtained under
these assumptions. The existence of a extinction threshold renders this graph finite. We assigned
to each link a certain transition probability dependent on an invasion rate ξ. The mean time
between consecutive invasions, ξ −1 , is assumed to be large compared to the time that each
community needs to restore its dynamical equilibrium.
Weighting the links of G with probabilities defines a finite Markov chain over the set of viable
communities. In [18] we showed that this chain is aperiodic, hence communities can be either
transient or recurrent. We always found a single connected set of recurrent communities upon
increasing the resource saturation R. This set was either a single absorbing community or a more
complex end state of recurrent communities, the Markov process being ergodic over those complex
sets. The existence of complex end states is probably one of the most remarkable results of the
model (for a detailed account of results see [18]).
According to this picture, ecosystems evolve though successional invasions until reaching
a final end state, either a single absorbent community or a complex, closed set of recurrent
communities. When the process reaches a complex end state, successional invasions transform
the ecosystem into some other of the communities belonging to that set, so the process visits all
communities in this set, albeit with different frequencies —given by the asymptotic probability
distribution of the Markov process within this set. In terms of species this means that communities
keep continuously changing and eventually, after enough time has elapsed, all the original species
in the ecosystem will be replaced by new ones. Therefore the ecosystem keeps on fluctuating
between the different communities comprising the closed set, which persists as a robust, stable
entity.

Let us now introduce a rate of spontaneous extinctions. Species in natural communities are
often subject to overexploitation. Intensive hunting in terrestrial communities or the increasing
fishing pressure in marine ecosystems are good examples of this. Sometimes the species population
is seriously altered due to habitat destruction, in other cases due to exposure to epidemics or
diseases. Many effects like these ones can effectively decrease to critical levels the number of
individuals of a certain species or even cause its extinction. We will represent these situations by
means of a probability rate, η, which accounts for the probability per unit time for a species to
go extinct for reasons other than being eaten. Actually this probability rate should depend on
the species and its environment but, for the sake of simplicity, we will assume it uniform for all
species.
Our model is amenable to introduce background extinctions in a simple way. Elementary
processes in the original model for η = 0 were transitions between viable communities carried out
by single-species invasions. Now two different processes, either invasion or extinction, can connect
two communities. Thus, for a given community E with L trophic levels, we need to determine all
the possible transitions carried out by invasions and spontaneous extinctions at each level (and
by invasions at level L + 1 as well). The graph G will now contain both types of transitions.
The links corresponding to extinction transitions can be obtained just as the invasion ones [16].
Given a community E ∈ G, we randomly remove one of its species and calculate the equilibrium
population densities of the resulting community E 0 . If the community is viable, then we establish
a transition between E and E 0 . If some species go below the extinction level nc , then we apply
the same sequential extinction procedure that was followed to obtain the invasion graph (for a
detailed discussion of this procedure see [17]). We repeat these sequential extinctions until the
final community E 00 is viable.
The transition probability pij for the transition from community i to community j can be
written as
pij = δij + ξqij + ηuij ,

(1)

where δij is the Kronecker delta, and matrices Q = (qij ) and U = (uij ) account for the relative
frequency of invasions and extinctions, respectively. For i 6= j we set qij = nij /(L + 1), nij being
the number of different invasions of i that lead to j and L+1 the total number of possible invasions
of i, provided it has L trophic levels. For i 6= j we define uij = mij /Si , where mij is the number
P
(i)
of different extinctions in i that lead to j and Si = L`=1 s` is the number of possible extinctions
of i. We set uii = 0 and calculate the diagonal of Q so that P = (pij ) is a stochastic matrix. This
yields

When η = 0 we recover the original transition matrix of our model (see [18]). This is quite a
singular case, though, not representative of what happens for any η > 0 —no matter how small.
In fact, there is a major difference between the cases η = 0 and η > 0, regarding the
properties of the Markov chain. For any η > 0, there is a non-zero probability for all the S species
in a community to go extinct. Let ∆t be the time unit between consecutive iterations of the

trophic levels, for 4 increasing values of η/ξ. Diameter of nodes is proportional to their asymptotic
probability. Labels of nodes represent species occupancies {s1 , s2 }. For the sake of clarity, only
transitions carried out through invasions are shown. For η = 0, the recurrent set contains 9

Markov chain. Thus the removal of all species caused by sequential spontaneous extinctions has a
probability at least equal to (η∆t)S . The non-vanishing probability of total extinction implies that
the process can return to the initial state (the empty community ∅) and therefore the Markov
chain becomes ergodic. This has to be compared with the former model (η = 0), for which we just

found a tiny fraction of recurrent states, and almost all the communities in the assembly graph
were transient [16, 18].
Ergodicity implies that any possible state of the ecosystem can be reached with a non-zero
—albeit sometimes small— asymptotic probability. According to (1) we simply need to solve the
linear system

to obtain the (row) vector π of asymptotic probabilities πi for all i ∈ G. Therefore the asymptotic
distribution depends on the relative strength between rates. We expect that, when this ratio is
small enough, the subset of communities with the highest probability coincides with the recurrent
subset found for η = 0. However, as this ratio increases, the probability of finding the process
within this subset should decrease. This effect can be observed in Figure 1, where we plot G
with its asymptotic distribution for R = 120 and 4 values of the quotient η/ξ. The remaining
parameters of the model have been set as in our previous work: α = 1, γ+ = 0.5, γ− = 5,
ρ = 0.3 and nc = 1. (We will use this set of parameters throughout this paper.) As η/ξ increases,
communities that were recurrent for η = 0 are visited with decreasing asymptotic probabilities.
Eventually, when the ratio is large enough, these communities are hardly visited and the process
stays with high probability in communities close to the empty ecosystem, ∅.
This effect is more clearly seen in terms of the dependence of Pr —the probability of finding
the process in any of the communities of the recurrent set for η = 0— and P∅ —the probability
of finding the ecosystem extinct— on η/ξ. A typical behavior of these probabilities is depicted in

its variance exhibits a double peak at values η1 /ξ ≈ 0.33 and η2 /ξ ≈ 0.46. The first one coincides
with the abrupt drop of Pr (red dashed line) but the second one precedes the increase of P∅ (red
full line) announcing it.

Figure 2. This plot corresponds to a resource saturation R = 1340, for which G has 397698 nodes
and 539 recurrent communities. In Figure 2 we can observe an abrupt decrease of Pr at η/ξ ≈ 0.33,
and P∅ increases abruptly as well when η/ξ ≈ 0.65. Needless to say, these two magnitudes resemble
the typical behavior of order parameters in the vicinity of a phase transition. A small increase in
η causes a shift from the stable, recurrent set at η = 0 to communities close to extinction. In this
sense, increasing background extinctions drive the system from a stable, species-rich attractor to
a species-poor region of the phase space. The system thus undergoes a catastrophic regime shift
analogous to those commonly observed in overexploited ecological communities [2]–[6].
3. Signals of catastrophic regime shifts
From the perspective of conservation and management of ecosystems, it is very important to
determine some signals that may alert of the proximity of a catastrophic transition. These are the
so-called early-warnings of catastrophic regime shifts [14], and act as flags for the approach of a
critical threshold. Although our model is minimalistic, the phenomenology of several magnitudes
reveal a critical behavior near the shift described in the previous section. Now, upon gradually
increasing the external “stress” (i.e., the ratio η/ξ) on our system, we will observe abrupt changes
in these magnitudes close to the regime shift.
We shall begin assuming very slow variations in η/ξ, i.e., the ecosystem undergoes very many
invasions before changes in the control parameter are noticeable. In this situation we can assume

that the community is always at is steady state. At the end of this section we will analyze the
effect of relaxing this assumption and allowing for a mixing of these two time-scales: the scale of
variation of the stress and the scale of invasion.
A first precursor of the shift is the fluctuation of the mean number of species in the
ecosystem. In [12] fluctuations were measured by the spatial heterogeneity of a single magnitude
(a biomass density) representing the community as a whole, whereas the kind of fluctuations we
are considering here are due to changes in the average number of species induced by invasions
P
and spontaneous extinctions. In Figure 3 we plot the average number of species S = i∈G πi Si ,
where Si is the total species richness of the i-th community. Its fluctuations are measured by the
variance

πi Si2 − S 2 .

The rapid growth of fluctuations provides an alert of the proximity of the catastrophic shift
[7, 12, 14] Fluctuations for R = 1340 exhibit a double peak at η1 ≈ 0.33ξ and η2 ≈ 0.46ξ. The
first one is related to the abrupt drop of the probability Pr that we showed in Section 2. In addition,
these two peaks correspond to a gradual decrease in the number of species at each trophic level,
as we will show below.
The second peak at η2 /ξ announces the abrupt increase of P∅ , but does not coincides with it.
The increase of this probability is connected to the fluctuations of the time of first return to the
empty community, whose mean value is given by T = P∅−1 . Using the first-passage distribution of
the Markov chain [21], we can calculate the relative variance σT2 /T 2 (see Appendix for details) and

Figure 5. Ecosystem profiles (mean number of species in each trophic level) for increasing η/ξ
ratios. This plot corresponds to a resource saturation R = 1340, for which communities have up
to 4 trophic levels. Lower levels are shown with darker color. (a) The ecosystem maintain its
pyramidal structure (η/ξ = 0.05). (b) The first trophic level starts to collapse (η/ξ = 0.3). (c)
The second level starts to loose species (η/ξ = 0.43). (d) For large values of the ratio, the system
is close to extinction (η/ξ = 0.6).

the result is shown in Figure 4. The maximum relative fluctuation occurs nearly at the onset of
increase of P∅ , η3 ≈ 0.67ξ. We thus expect that relative fluctuations in the average return time to
any state i close to ∅ will be amplified close to the extinction transition. This notwithstanding, it
is hard to figure out how this fluctuation could be used in practice as a signal of the catastrophe.
A second signal of the transition in this model is a gradual loss of species in trophic levels from
bottom to top. This effect can be qualitatively observed in the ecosystem profile (see Figure 5),
where the average number of species at each trophic level is shown. When the quotient of rates
increases from η/ξ = 0.3 [panel (b)] to η/ξ = 0.43 [panel (c)], the number of species in the first
level decreases considerably, but the rest of levels remain almost unaltered. After that [panel (d)],
a simultaneous loss of species in the first and second levels takes place.
Figure 6 shows the number of species at each level averaged over G versus η/ξ. We observe
that the decrease of s1 approximately coincides with the first peak of σS2 at η1 , and the decrease of
s2 corresponds to the second peak at η2 . After that, species at lower levels are unable to sustain
upper levels and a trophic cascade occurs. The third and fourth levels start to be emptied near η3 .
There is a clear correspondence between the values at which trophic levels start to collapse and
the location of the maxima of σS2 and σT2 /T 2 . In any case, the loss of species from bottom to top
as the extinction rate increases is a clear signal of the catastrophic regime shift. Besides, trophic
cascades have been recognized empirically as signals of over-fishing in marine communities [15].

which the first and second levels start to collapse. The species loss in the third and fourth levels
starts when the probability P∅ becomes appreciable (by η3 , the maximum of σT2 /T 2 ).

In the remaining of the section we will consider the variation of η as a non-equilibrium process.
Now we shall assume that, although the variation of η is still not faster than ξ −1 , the two scales
are comparable in the sense that the process is not able to remain in the steady state anymore.
An estimate of the time scale for the convergence to the steady state is provided by
1
,
(5)
ξtc = −
log |λ2 |
where λ2 is the second largest eigenvalue (in modulus) of the stochastic matrix P (see Figure 7).
The distance from the probability distribution after n iterations of the Markov chain to the steady
state is proportional to |λ2 /λ1 |n , hence the definition of tc (note that the maximum eigenvalue
λ1 = 1 since P is a stochastic matrix). For R = 1340, the number of iterations needed to reach
equilibrium near the shift are around 103 .
The faster variation of η is implemented by producing a small change ∆η every ∆n < ξtc
iterations of the Markov chain. We start by increasing η in these increments until reaching an
arbitrary value beyond the regime shift. Then we repeat the process by decreasing η in the same
increments. This way we can track any observable along the cycle, by computing its averages after
k = 0, 1, . . . increments ∆η using the probability distribution

given any initial distribution π(0) at η = 0 (reverse order in matrix products applies for decreasing
η). In Figure 8 the average species richness exhibits a hysteresis cycle. As ∆n increases this cycle

narrows, recovering the quasi-stationary process in the limit ∆n → ∞. In this limit the process
is reversible and the cycle collapses to the curve of mean number of species shown in Figure 3.
The existence of hysteresis loops in overexploited systems has been reported in the literature
as another signal of catastrophic shifts in ecological communities [7, 12, 14]. We have obtained it
for the mean number of species, but a similar behavior will be observed in any other magnitude
(like the total biomass density, as in [12]). In spite of the simplicity of our model, hysteresis cycles
appear as well as other usual precursors of catastrophic regimes, such as anomalous variance.
But, unlike previous models, our model allows a deeper understanding of the transition, as we will
discuss below. An important insight this model provides is that hysteresis can arise as a result of
a time-scale mixing that keeps the system out of equilibrium rather than to non-linearities of the
underlying population model.
4. Phase transition in finite size
As we have mentioned, our model provides a full description of the phase space of the system by
means of a transition probability matrix. We are going to take advantage of this fact to show
rigorously that the phenomenology that we have described in Section 3 corresponds to a phase
transition —in the sense of Statistical Mechanics— in finite size.
In Statistical Mechanics, phase transitions are associated to non-analyticities of the free energy
of a physical system. Whenever the system is described by a transfer matrix, the free energy
is obtained from its largest eigenvalue. A true phase transition would then be associated to the
crossing of the leading eigenvalue with the second largest (in modulus) one, because such a crossing

causes a non-analytic behavior of the largest eigenvalue as a function of the control parameter
[22]. The counterpart of a transfer matrix in a Markov chain is the transition probability matrix
P . Thus a crossing of eigenvalues of P would rigorously prove that the system undergoes a phase
transition.
Strictly speaking, the described shift can not be a true phase transition because of the
finiteness of our system. According to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, an irreducible matrix†
with non-negative entries has a unique largest real eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector
has strictly positive components [23]. Reducible matrices are related to processes with transient
states. Since the Markov chain is ergodic for η > 0, its stochastic matrix P it is irreducible.
Then the theorem implies that its maximum eigenvalue λ1 = 1 is simple for any value of η/ξ (its
corresponding positive left eigenvector is precisely the asymptotic probability distribution). This
excludes any eigenvalue crossing, therefore any phase transition. True phase transitions can only
occur in infinite states Markov chains. When the limiting chain of a sequence of finite Markov
chains develops an eigenvalue crossing —hence a phase transition— the second largest eigenvalue
of the elements of this sequence approaches the largest one near the location of the true phase
transition, the more so the larger the size (number of states) of the Markov chain. This is the
fingerprint of the phase transition in finite systems. It is also associated to a qualitative change
in the eigenvector associated to the leading eigenvalue.
We have computed the 10 largest eigenvalues of P (in modulus) using Arnoldi iteration [24]
† A matrix P is reducible if there exists a permutation matrix W such that W T P W =
associated chain is not ergodic.

Figure 9. First (dashed line) and second (full line) eigenvalues of P for a resource saturation
R = 1340. Inset shows a zoom of the region for which λ1 = 1 and λ2 are closest, and two maxima

observed in σS2 and tc (see Figure 3 and Figure 7).

(useful for computing a few eigenvalues of large sparse matrices). In all cases the numerical
method provides a real second eigenvalue. Figure 9 shows the dependence of λ2 as a function of
η/ξ for R = 1340. Not surprisingly, we identify the transition points as those of closest approach
to the first eigenvalue (i.e., the two maxima observed in λ2 ). Those maxima are reached at
η1 /ξ = 0.330520 . . . and η2 /ξ = 0.462633 . . ., which coincide with the values observed for the
peaks in σS2 and tc (see Section 3). As we have shown before, each transition yields a trophic
cascade in the system, whose levels get emptied from bottom to top.
We have varied the system size (controlled by the amount of resource, R [18]) in order to
check that the second eigenvalue gets closer to the first one as size increases. The system size
is measured by the average number of species in the recurrent set for η = 0, and we do observe
that the larger the system size the closer is λ2 to 1 (see Figure 10). It is difficult to √increase the
size beyond S ≈ 300 because the number of nodes in G grows approximately as eκ R [18]. For
S ≈ 300 the number of viable communities is larger than 106 , and the eigenvalue computation
becomes very demanding.
To conclude this section, we have obtained the phase diagram of this system. In Figure 11
we show in a η/ξ vs. R diagram the points at which λ2 reaches its maxima, yielding the transition
lines corresponding to the different trophic cascades of the system. Basically transition lines are
horizontal, and the number of undergone trophic cascades appears to be related to the number
of trophic levels of the communities. We believe that, at some point in the region in which
communities have 5 trophic levels, a third maximum would appear related to a separate trophic
cascade at the third level. Bearing this hypothesis out is difficult, though, because it would require

allows three trophic levels and only a single maximum is observed. For higher values of R (which
allow up to 4 levels), a second maximum appears, related to the trophic cascade in the second

eigenvalue calculations with too large matrices.
All this analytical evidence allows us to claim that these model ecosystems undergo a
catastrophic transition driven by the relative extinction rate. The dependence of λ2 with η/ξ
actually exhibits two maxima and so does the variance in species number. This points towards
the existence of a double phase transition, each one associated to a trophic cascade that collapses
the lowest and next-to-lowest trophic level in the ecosystem. Increasing the external stress over
the system above these values increases the probability of driving the ecosystem to extinction.
Consequently there is a threshold in η/ξ above which the extinction of the ecosystem is the most
likely event. Small variations in that region can cause the collapse of stable ecosystems.
5. Conclusions
In this paper we have used a recently introduced model [16] to propose an alternative explanation
to the observed catastrophic regime shifts in overexploited ecosystems [7, 12]. Previous models
postulate nonlinearities in the dynamics of a magnitude representative of the whole ecosystem,
like for instance the total biomass density, and this non-linear behavior leads to bi-stability. The
system undergoes a transition due to a change of regime that leads the system from one stable state
to another. This viewpoint is almost the same used in the classical explanations of the liquid-vapor
transition in thermodynamics, for which the potential of the system has two alternative stable
states.
Our model, however, is inspired in a microscopic description, more related to the perspective

of Statistical Mechanics. Our viable communities are micro-states in a finite phase space and
represent different states of the ecosystem. The transition between a species-rich attractor (the
recurrent set at η = 0) and an attractor with low number of species (communities close to the
empty ecosystem) is explained as the crossing of two eigenvalues of the transition matrix of
the Markov chain. This transition is driven by an increasing external force represented by a
background species extinction rate, that takes into account the overall mortality for reasons other
than predation (overexploitation, habitat destruction, epidemics. . . ).
In spite of its being minimalistic, the model reproduces qualitatively the phenomenology
observed in overexploited ecosystems. We have studied for this model the behavior of several
early-warnings that announce the catastrophic shift, and we have found the same behavior as that
obtained both in previous models [7, 12] and empirically [14]. These features are shared by many
systems under the framework of the elementary catastrophe theory [25].
Catastrophes have characteristic fingerprints. Some of the standard flags of catastrophic
regimes are modality, anomalous variance and hysteresis [26]. These are precisely the signals we
find in our model. Our system is bimodal because it undergoes transitions between an attractor of
high species richness to another stable state with low species richness. Fluctuations in the mean
number of species exhibit peaks at the transition points, and take very large values compared to
their values far away from the transition. We thus have anomalous behavior of variances. And the
average number of species exhibits hysteresis cycles when the system is kept out of equilibrium,
as we have shown in Section 3. This explanation of hysteresis is alternative to the existence of
non-linearities in the population model, and points towards the speed of variation of the external

Catastrophic regime shifts in model ecological communities are true phase transitions

17

stress. The difference with the usual explanation is that in this case the ecosystem can recover its
initial state after releasing the external stress, provided that we wait long enough and that there
is availability of invaders.
The main advantage of our model is the microscopic description that it provides. The full
characterization of the phase space of the system has allowed us to show rigorously that the
system undergoes a true phase transition by computing the second eigenvalue of the transition
matrix, which gets closest to the first eigenvalue in the vicinity of the transition. This provides a
theoretical support to the critical behavior exhibited by magnitudes like the fluctuation of species
richness.
We have found evidence for a double phase transition in the system, associated to the gradual
loss of species from bottom to top. This effect is new to former models and could be used as early
warning for the catastrophic shift by monitoring the species abundance at low trophic levels
in overexploited ecosystems. Trophic cascades have been revealed as possible mechanisms of
catastrophic shifts in natural communities, though [15]. Thus, with the caveat that this is just a
very simplified picture of real communities, our analysis of this model predicts that overexploited
systems will begin to collapse first at lower levels.
Assuming a different extinction rate at each trophic level would be more realistic. For
example, in overexploited marine ecosystems, the impact of fishing pressure is stronger in higher
trophic levels. A simple model like ours could shed light in determining whether a strong extinction
pressure in higher levels is more harmful than in lower levels. Refined versions of the model could
allow investigating this kind of effects.
Most theoretical explanations of the catastrophic phenomena observed in ecological systems
subject to high exploitation pressure rely on nonlinearities in the macroscopic dynamics of the
system. The take-home message of this paper is that a microscopic model like ours, based in
ecologically reasonable assumptions and in a simple, linear population dynamic models, can exhibit
the same phenomenology as non-linear, macroscopic models. This way, our approach can serve as
an alternative explanation of the catastrophic regime shifts observed in ecological communities.
