Abstract
Background: Brown algae are sessile macro-organisms of great ecological relevance in coastal ecosystems. They
evolved independently from land plants and other multicellular lineages, and therefore hold several original ontogenic
and metabolic features. Most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they face frequent environmental
changes, including exposure to toxic levels of heavy metals such as copper (Cu).
Results: We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of
the brown algal model E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for other abiotic stressors.
This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative stress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic
overlap between Cu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the activation of
the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways, together with the regulation of genes coding for
several transcription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically activated a set of genes coding for
orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type ATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent
bromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally we observed, as a common abiotic
stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic processes on one hand and the repression of genes involved in
nitrogen assimilation on the other hand.
Conclusions: Comparisons with data from green plants indicate that some processes involved in Cu and
oxidative stress response are conserved across these two distant lineages. At the same time the high number of
yet uncharacterized brown alga-specific genes induced in response to copper stress underlines the potential to
discover new components and molecular interactions unique to these organisms. Of particular interest for future
research is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-, myo-inositol-, and oxylipin signaling.

Background
Brown algae (Kingdom Chromalveolata, Division Heterokontophyta, Class Phaeophyceae) are sessile macro-organisms of
great ecological relevance in coastal ecosystems, and
belong to an evolutionary lineage that has diverged from
land plants and other multicellular organisms more than
one billion years ago through secondary endosymbiosis
[1]. Most of these seaweeds grow in the intertidal zone
where they must face constant abiotic fluctuations, e.g. in
temperature, irradiation, and salinity, in relation with the
tidal cycle. In addition to these natural constraints, they
must deal with pollutants, including heavy metals (HMs),
resulting from human activities. These pollutants represent a major threat for marine ecosystems, impacting benthic flora and fauna assemblages [2-4]. Copper (Cu) is a
vital micronutrient, essential for all forms of life. It acts as
cofactor for many enzymatic systems, and participates in
crucial physiological processes including photosynthesis
and respiration. However, excessive Cu concentrations are
harmful for most living organisms. For this reason, free
Cu is found only in traces in eukaryotic cells, where it is
tightly controlled by a set of specific transporters and
cytosolic chaperones that deliver it to their respective target proteins or organelles [5]. At high concentrations,
both cupric and cuprous (Cu(II)/Cu(I), E0 = +0.15 V) ions
can participate in redox reactions affecting organisms at
the cellular level mainly by three well-established processes: (i) direct protein inactivation by undesired amino
acid-metal interactions due to the affinity of Cu(II) for
thiol-, imidazole-, and carboxyl- groups; (ii) in presence of
superoxide or reducing agents Cu(II) can be reduced to
Cu(I), which is capable of catalyzing the formation of hydroxyl radicals via the non-enzymatic Fenton’s reaction
[6]; (iii) displacement of essential cations from specific
binding sites. These effects impact a wide range of cellular
processes in photosynthetic organisms, interfering for instance with fatty acid and protein metabolism, or inhibiting respiration and nitrogen fixation processes [7]. Copper
affects in particular photosystem electron transfer components, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and peroxidation chain reactions involving membrane lipids [8,9]. For these reasons, this metal has been
extensively utilized as antifouling agent to prevent the
proliferation of algal flora on immersed surfaces.
Most organisms deploy an array of mechanisms to
control cellular Cu levels, for detoxification, and to repair damaged cellular structures, which are triggered via
the activation of signaling pathways. Signal transduction
involves elements shared by plants and animals, but also
molecules specific to each lineage [10]. Plants may trap
free Cu by increasing levels of chelating agents such as
chaperones, metallothioneins, phytochelatins, or organic
acids [11]. This process is linked to an increase of transmembrane activity, in which Cu P1B-type ATPases and

Page 2 of 17

multidrug resistance ABCC transporters (formerly known
as multidrug resistance-related proteins) may have key
roles to sequester or exclude chelated forms of Cu or
other toxic adducts [12,13].
Knowledge of the molecular bases of Cu stress regulation in brown algae is still scarce and scattered. Previous
studies in this domain have focused on a few specific
physiological aspects such as photosynthesis [14,15], oxidative stress [16,17], or metal chelation [18,19], and
most constitute field studies of long-term adaptation to
chronic Cu exposure. Recently, two publications have reported large-scale proteomic analyses to identify mechanisms underlying acclimation to high Cu levels [20,21].
These studies showed the increase of brown algal specific
antioxidant mechanisms and changes in photosynthesisrelated proteins to cope with chronic Cu stress. However,
there is still limited molecular data, especially at the transcriptomic level, on how brown algae sense short-term variations in metal content and induce the regulation of
intracellular Cu concentrations through specific signaling
processes. Previous work on the brown alga Laminaria
digitata showed that short term exposure to Cu stress triggers the synthesis of 12-oxophytodienoic acid (12-OPDA)
and prostaglandins, concomitantly with changes in expression of selected genes involved in stress response [22].
These results suggest that brown algae may synthesize
plant-like octadecanoid, but also eicosanoid oxylipins, to
induce stress-related detoxification responses.
So far, global molecular analyses of the brown algal
stress response were hampered by the lack of genomic
resources. The development of the biological model
Ectocarpus siliculosus, including access to its genome sequence, represents a major breakthrough in algal research,
and opens the gates to “omics”-based approaches [23,24].
Regarding Cu-homeostasis, the annotation of the E. siliculosus genome allowed identifying several putative Cuchaperones, ABC transporters, and Cu-channels controlling cellular Cu traffic. Moreover, two recent reports by
Dittami et al. [25,26] have established a starting point for
the integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite profiling during the short-term response to saline and oxidative
stress in E. siliculosus. They demonstrated the repression
of primary metabolism and the activation of recycling of
existing proteins through autophagy under the abiotic
stress conditions tested.
In the present study, we employed large-scale transcriptome and metabolome analyses to gain insights into
the short-term acclimation of E. siliculosus to Cu stress,
and extended the analysis of gene expression data to results previously published for other abiotic stressors.
The integration of these results highlighted the Cu induction of a large panel of signaling mechanisms likely
to constitute the driving force behind the observed
transcriptomic and metabolic shifts. In particular,

Ritter et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/116

oxylipin metabolism and several distinct genes coding
for transcription-associated proteins were up-regulated.
Moreover, transcriptomic meta-analysis of Cu and
other abiotic stressors showed tight links between Cu
and oxidative stress, and confirmed previous observations such as the repression of genes encoding enzymes
involved in primary amino acid biosynthesis, balanced
with the induction of autophagic processes. In addition,
this analysis allowed the identification of Cu stress
specific mechanisms such as the up-regulation of multidrug resistance ABC transporters, putative Cu P1B-type
ATPases, and of a vanadium bromoperoxidase involved
in halide metabolism.

Results
Cu stress treatments alter photosynthetic capabilities of
E. siliculosus

To monitor the short-term acclimation to stress rather
than cell death, the intensity of Cu stress had to be carefully selected. In previous chronic Cu stress experiments,
we showed that Cu(II) at a concentration of 250 μg L−1 led
to a drastic decrease of photosynthetic activity (Fv/Fm)
after 1 to 6 days of treatment [21]. In this study, we aimed
to monitor the acute Cu stress response of E. siliculosus.
Therefore algae were incubated in presence of Cu(II)
during 8 h at final concentrations of 250 μg L−1 and at
500 μg L−1. These concentrations are comparable to
those registered in Cu polluted marine sites where E.
siliculosus has been observed [27,28], and correspond
to an approximately 400-fold enrichment of the total
dissolved Cu content in the natural seawater used to
set-up the experiments. Changes in the photosynthetic
yield were then followed on an hourly basis. Compared
to the control treatment, algae incubated with 500 μg L−1

Page 3 of 17

displayed significantly lower Fv/Fm ratios after 6 h (U test,
p < 0.05), while 250 μg L−1 induced a significant decrease
(U test, p < 0.05) only after 8 h of treatment (Figure 1).
Taking these results into consideration, algae were sampled after 4 h and 8 h of incubation in medium with
250 μg L−1 Cu(II) to monitor molecular changes occurring
prior and during the observed reduction of photosynthetic
activity.
Meta-transcriptomic analysis highlights copper specific
genes, shared responses with oxidative stress treatments,
and core abiotic stress genes

Copper stress treatment resulted in 909 significantly
regulated contigs/singletons under Cu stress (regardless
of time), 546 of which were up-regulated and 363
down-regulated compared to control conditions (twoway ANOVA, FDR of 5%). None of the examined contigs/singletons showed a significant interaction between
time and treatment, indicating little difference in the
transcriptomic response to 4 h and 8 h of Cu treatment.
Only 11% of the contigs/singletons induced in response to
Cu stress were automatically classified by the GOLEM
and KOBAS annotation tools (data not shown); therefore
manual classification was done for genes presenting a
fold-change ratio > 2 compared to the control conditions.
This dataset represents 560 genes (627 contigs/singletons),
which were assigned to 13 categories (Figure 2, Additional
file 1).
Cu stress transcriptomic data were further compared to
previous results obtained with the same array and protocol for short-term (6 h) hyposaline (56 mM NaCl final
concentration), hypersaline (1,470 mM NaCl final concentration) and oxidative (1 mM H2O2 final concentration)
stress [25] [ArrayExpress:E-TABM-578]. To reduce the

Figure 2 Functional distribution of contigs/singletons up-regulated and down-regulated in Cu-stressed E. siliculosus. Contigs/singletons

number of false negatives no FDR correction was applied
for this meta-analysis, and all transcripts previously
found to be significantly regulated (p < 0.05, fold-change
compared to control > 2) after either 6 h [25] or 4 or 8 h
(this study) were taken into account. Seventy-five contigs/
singletons were up-regulated in all considered stress conditions (Additional file 2A). Seventy-six percent of them
(i.e. 57) code for proteins with unknown functions, and
48% (i.e. 36) are orphans (Additional file 3), that is as of
March 2013, they had no match outside E. siliculosus
in the NCBI nr database at an e-value cutoff of 1e-5.
Regarding down-regulated transcripts, we identified 64
contigs/singletons (Additional file 2B) of which 55%
(i.e. 35) correspond to unknown proteins and 27% (i.e. 17)
are orphans.
Hierarchical clustering (Additional file 4) revealed that
H2O2 stress samples formed a cluster with Cu-stress
samples, likely reflecting the fact that Cu(II) treatment
unbalances the cellular redox state, leading to oxidative
stress. Indeed, 42% of the contigs/singletons regulated
(336 of the induced and 314 of the repressed) in response to copper stress were also regulated at least in response to H2O2 (Additional file 1). In the following
sections, we focus on the manual analysis of selected
gene families or functional categories of genes representing three profiles of expression: genes regulated by all
available stressors, genes regulated at least by Cu and
H2O2, and finally genes specifically regulated by copper
stress. Lists of these genes as well as available annotations are provided in Additional file 3. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed for these three different
groups of genes using Blast2GO, but did not yield any
significantly overrepresented GO terms at an FDR < 5%.

Cell signaling and communication

A phospholipase C (PLC) gene (comprising two genomic
loci, Esi0000_0131 and Esi0000_0133) was up-regulated
specifically under Cu stress. The locus Esi0085_0013, encoding a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein of the Copine family that is related to abiotic stress
processes in land plants, was induced under both Cu
and H2O2 stress. In addition, a gene encoding a Cadependent protein kinase (Esi0073_0115) and a serine
threonine kinase (Esi0038_0037) were up-regulated by
both stressors. Conversely, a large set of genes involved in
myo-inositol metabolism were down-regulated under these
treatments. This was true for a cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) synthase (Esi0016_0173), a putative
phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinase (Esi0030_
0108), a myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (Esi0279_0022),
a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein SEC14 (Esi0499_
0013), and a putative inositol monophosphatase (Esi0133_
0061).
In relation to downstream lipid metabolism and signaling cascades, a gene encoding a cytochrome P450
enzyme (Esi0060_0078) was among the most highly upregulated genes during copper treatment (41-fold after
4 h, 8-fold after 8 h) and also responded to oxidative
stress (Additional file 3). The corresponding protein
displays approximately 30% identity and 45% similarity
with the cytochrome P450 domain of plant allene oxide
synthases (AOSs) of the CYP74 family involved in the
jasmonate biosynthetic pathway. A multiple alignment
of this protein with members of the CYP74 family highlights the existence of several motifs common to AOSs,
such as the IHCD motif and the conserved F and S catalytic amino acid residues (Additional file 5A). Finally,

protein structure homology modelling using the Phyre2
software predicts high structural similarity between
Esi0060_0078 and the AOS of Parthenium argentatum
(Additional file 5, panel B; PDB: 3dan; 100% confidence,
91% coverage).
Transcription factors (TFs)

Among the 283 TFs in the E. siliculosus genome [29],
our study identified 19 up-regulated and 6 downregulated genes (Table 1). Eight of these genes were specifically up-regulated by Cu stress, whereas seven others
were co-induced by Cu and H2O2. Among them, two
potential arsenite-inducible AN1-ZFPs, Esi0002_0015

(specifically up-regulated by Cu), and Esi0348_0030
(induced by Cu, H2O2 and hyposaline stress) were
found. Interestingly, Esi0002_0015 was more similar to animal AN1-ZFPs, and Esi0348_0030 to plant-type stress associated proteins. Also in relation to stress TFs, the heat
shock factor Esi0279_0021 was among the genes most
strongly repressed in response to Cu stress, with a 26-fold
change after 4 h of treatment (Table 1). Furthermore, two
Cu specifically up-regulated genes, Esi0100_0085 and
Esi0226_0031, contained the RWP-RK domain found in
plant proteins involved in nitrogen-controlled development
[30]. Finally, we recorded the transcriptional up-regulation
of a gene coding for a protein containing a zinc finger

domain that was initially annotated as a metal responsive
transcription factor (MTF)-1-like protein (Esi0513_0010)
under both Cu and oxidative stress. However, although this
protein showed some similarities to the DNA binding domain of metazoan MTF-1, no further homology to MTF-1
proteins was observed outside this domain, making it impossible to infer the function of Esi0513_0010 without further experimentation.

four ABCT subfamilies (Figure 3). Of particular interest
are Esi0109_0024 and Esi077_0044, which fall into the
stress-detoxification ABC-B (MDR/TAP) and ABC-C
(CFTR/MRP) subfamilies, respectively. In addition, Esi0359_
0018 and Esi0154_0007 clustered with plant and human
ABC-A transporters.
Primary metabolism and protein turnover

Stress and detoxification mechanisms

Many genes coding for proteins involved in general stress
and detoxification mechanisms were regulated under both
Cu and H2O2 stress. For instance, eight heat shock proteins (HSPs) of the 70, 40, and 20 classes were upregulated, possibly to facilitate the refolding of damaged
proteins and to prevent protein aggregation (Additional
file 3) under acute oxidative stress. The up-regulation
of a DNA double-strand break repair rad50 ATPase
(Esi0002_0198) was also observed. Finally, genes coding
for proteins with important functions for antioxidant
mechanisms were also induced by Cu and H2O2,
including a glutathione reductase (Esi0019_0176), two
glutathione-S-transferases (Esi0648_0004 and Esi0191_
0054), and one thioredoxin (Esi0030_0031).
Besides the overlapping responses to H2O2 and Cu
treatments, several genes regulated exclusively by Cu
stress were identified, including two chloroplastic irondependant superoxide dismutases (Fe-SODs; Esi0219_002
and Esi0201_0013) and a vanadium dependent bromoperoxidase (vBPO; Esi0009_0080) which is a ROS detoxifying
enzyme specific of brown algae (Additional file 3). Furthermore, a glutathione-S-transferase (Esi0002_0065), and
two glutaredoxins, Esi0050_0061 (a glutaredoxin/malate
transporter fusion protein) and Esi0036_0002, were also
specifically up-regulated by Cu. These latter enzymes
are likely involved in HM-detoxification functions such
as reduction of Cu-glutathione adducts and export of
Cu-organic acid adducts. Several additional stress-related
transport systems were specifically up-regulated by Cu
stress. Among them were a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion protein (MATE; Esi0017_0140) and a putative heavy metal P1B-type ATPase (HMA; Esi0023_0054)
(Additional file 3). This protein contains a conserved
HMA motif in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, a central E1-E2 ATPase domain, and a haloacid dehalogenase
domain in the C-terminal region (Additional file 6);
PSI-BLAST shows 41% of identity between the E. siliculosus
protein and the A. thaliana Cu+ exporting P1B type ATPase
HMA5 (AT1G63440).
We also observed Cu specific up-regulation of five of
the 69 putative E. siliculosus ABC transporter proteins
(ABCTs) (Additional file 3). Phylogenetic analysis, together with reference sequences from the human [31]
and A. thaliana [32] superfamily of ABCTs, led to the

As illustrated by our PAM measurements, one basic
process altered by copper stress was photosynthesis,
which is directly linked to the generation of ROS when
intracellular copper concentrations are not properly regulated. In our study, two genes coding for stress-related
chlorophyll binding proteins (CBPs) of the LI818 family,
Esi0002_0349 and Esi0085_0016, appeared up-regulated
specifically by Cu stress, and a third, Esi0085_0049, was
up-regulated under copper, oxidative, and hyposaline
stress. A fourth Cu-induced CBP, Esi0458_0016, belonged
to the LHCF clade [33]. We also observed a trend for
down-regulation, at least under Cu stress, of a number of
genes related to the xanthophyll cycle such as putative
violaxanthin de-epoxidases, as well as a putative zeaxanthin epoxidase (Additional file 1). Regarding chlorophyll
biosynthesis, Cu and H2O2 repressed genes encoding an
Mg chelatase, a chlorophyll synthase, and a protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Although these changes did not pass our
rather strict FDR correction, they were significant when
analysed individually (Additional file 3).
Twenty of the genes repressed by Cu stress were associated to nitrogen assimilation and primary amino acid
synthesis (Figure 4). Several of them were also downregulated under H2O2 stress, such as one nitrite reductase
(NAD(P)H and ferredoxin; Esi0249_0028), one glutamate
synthase (Esi0029_0131), one glutamate dehydrogenase 1
(Esi0028_0164), and three putative NH4+ and NO3− transporters (Esi0526_0006, Esi0278_0026, and Esi0278_0032)
(Additional file 3). These observations suggest the repression of the GS/GOGAT pathway under oxidative stress
conditions. In addition, an agmatinase (Esi0039_0062),
and a spermine synthase (Esi0000_0445) were specifically
down-regulated by Cu, indicating the repression of the
arginine/ornithine-derived polyamine pathway. Three
other genes, coding for proteins involved in nitrate, ammonium, urea and amino acid transport (Esi0278_0026,
Esi0526_0006, and Esi0104_0047), were down-regulated
in all stress conditions included in our meta-analysis.
In contrast to the transcriptomic repression of nitrogen assimilation, 35 contigs/singletons related to protein
turnover processes (Figure 2) were induced in response
to copper stress. Among them, 12 genes correspond to
the ubiquitin system, and all of them except one encoding an ubiquitin related protein Esi0009_0093 were induced in response to several stressors (Additional file 3).

Eight genes corresponded to proteasome-related proteins, suggesting the induction of stress-related autophagy
mechanisms. Four of these genes were induced specifically
in response to copper. Furthermore, we detected the upregulation of six RING type domain proteins that might
correspond to E3-ligases (Additional file 1).
Parallel to changes in N metabolism, we observed
down-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis
and degradation. Moreover, twenty-one genes related to
sugar metabolism were significantly regulated in response
to Cu treatments (FDR < 5%; Additional file 1). Most of
them correspond to proteins involved in central carbon
metabolism and storage, sugar transport, and structural
modifications of cell wall polysaccharides, and were also
regulated in response to other stressors (Additional file 3).
Regarding sugar metabolism, it is interesting to note
the presence of genes involved in mannitol and trehalose synthesis, both repressed in presence of Cu (Additional
file 1). With respect to cell wall structure modifications, we
noted that Cu and H2O2 treatments induced the upregulation of two genes encoding the alginate modifying
enzymes mannuronan-C5-epimerases MEP6 and MEP7
(Additional file 3). A number of loci corresponding to
other polysaccharide modifying enzymes were also induced
in presence of copper, mainly after 4 h of treatment, such
as several loci encoding glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and
glycoside transferases (GTs) (Additional file 3). However,
none of these Cu-regulated GTs or GHs was induced in
presence of H2O2.
Cu-induced changes at the transcriptome level modulate
metabolite composition

E. siliculosus (red and blue) ABC transporters. E. siliculosus genes
induced specifically by Cu stress are marked in red. Confidence
values are the results of an approximate likelihood ratio test; only
confidence values ≥ 50 are shown.

To relate the transcriptional reprogramming induced by
copper stress in E. siliculosus with changes in the metabolome, metabolite profiling was carried out for algal samples
harvested after 4 h and 8 h of treatments. UPLC-MS experiments in positive ion mode for Cu-stressed algae provided
392 monoisotopic peaks. Partial least squares discriminant
analysis (Additional file 7) and hierarchical clustering
(Additional file 8) of these compounds indicated a clear distinction between Cu stress and control samples, but the different treatment times could not be separated. Two major
groups of metabolites emerged from this analysis, corresponding to compounds that either accumulate or decline
in response to Cu stress. Within each of these groups two
smaller clusters, with either a strong or a weak response to
stress, were visible. The combination of UPLC-MS and
GC-MS analysis allowed us to identify 47 compounds
corresponding to fatty acids, oxylipins, and amino acids
(Figure 5).
Changes in amino acid contents

metabolite profiles, PLS-DA of samples according to

their amino acid profile allowed to discriminate between control and stress conditions (Additional file 9,
panel A), as well as between durations of treatments.
The primary amino acids in E. siliculosus, alanine and
glutamate [34] showed no significant variations in response to stress (p > 0.05; Figure 5). In contrast, contents of aromatic (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and
branched chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) increased at least 2 fold after 4 h and 8 h of Cu
treatment (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05), likely as a result
of increased protein catabolism.
Variations in free fatty acid contents and oxylipin synthesis

Cu stress induced a significant increase in the levels of
free fatty acids (FFAs), especially after 8 h of treatment
(two-way ANOVA p < 0.05) (Figure 5). In accordance
with this analysis, the PLS co-projection of FFA variations discriminated treatments (control - stress) and exposure time (4–8 h) (Additional file 9, panel B).
Regarding FFAs, Cu treatment induced a 3-fold increase
of linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4), and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) (two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05;
Figure 5). This increase was correlated with the occurrence of octadecanoid and eicosanoid oxygenated derivatives but only after 8 h of stress and in three of the four
biological replicates analyzed. Currently, we do not have
any explanation why these observations did not hold true
for the fourth biological replicate, which much resembled
the other replicates of the same condition with respect to
all other examined metabolites as well as gene expression
profiles. In the three replicates mentioned above, 13hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and
13S-hydroxy-9Z,11E,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HOTrE)

contents increased under the 8 h stress treatment, with
16- and 3-fold changes respectively, suggesting the occurrence of a 13-lipoxygenase activity (Figure 5). Within
the same context, the content of 12-oxophytodienoic acid
(12-oxo-PDA) increased 3-fold after 8 h of Cu treatment
and the non-enzymatic accumulation of cyclic C18 phytoprostanes A1 was triggered, supporting the occurrence of
ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation processes. Finally, Cu
stress induced the accumulation of C20:4 derivatives such
as oxo-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (oxo-ETE; 8fold change after 8 h of treatment), together with the
cyclopentenones prostaglandin A2 and J2 (Figure 6).
Finally, it is worth mentioning that among the 392
monoisotopic peaks from ions detected through UPLCMS analysis, many unknown metabolites were regulated
by exposure to Cu (Additional file 8). The analysis of
these compounds was beyond the scope of this report,
but their identity and function will be the subject of future studies.

Discussion
Copper is extremely toxic at high concentrations, and
induces oxidative stress by altering electron transfer reactions such as photosynthesis and respiration. In our
study, we observed a range of different acclimation processes on the molecular level (transcriptomic and metabolite profiling) before the alga exhibited a decrease in
photosynthetic yield. Such a decrease in photosynthetic
yield results in the alteration of several physiological
processes in E. siliculosus, such as the formation of heavy
metal-substituted chlorophylls [14], reduced carbon fixation and depletion of reducing equivalents. Effectively,
since nitrate reduction directly relies on NADH and

FADH2 produced by photosynthesis [35], any condition
altering photosynthesis (e.g. abiotic stress) may directly
affect the regulation of N assimilation and the associated primary amino acid metabolism [36] or vice versa.
We observed that Cu-stressed E. siliculosus downregulated genes coding for enzymes related to N assimilation. This down-regulation was not related to a
decrease of the pool of free primary amino acids. Moreover, an increase in the content of aromatic amino acids
was recorded together with an induction of genes encoding proteins involved in the autophagy process, in
particular those related to ubiquitination such as putative E3 ubiquitin ligases, and proteins involved in the
proteasome complexes. These observations are similar
to previous results published in E. siliculosus on response to other stress conditions [25], and suggest that
alteration of N assimilation and carbon fixation is compensated by degradation of damaged proteins and recycling of amino acids. Similar processes have been
identified in land plants during stress response or in diatoms under nitrogen starvation [37,38]. Concomitantly
to the down-regulation of genes involved in N assimilation under copper stress, we observed an increase of
free fatty acids. Similar links between amino- and fatty
acid metabolism have previously been observed in other
algae, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [39]. Altogether,
these data suggest that a substantial part of the response of
E. siliculosus to short term copper stress consists in balancing primary metabolic processes. Although we can currently only speculate about the exact physiological benefits
of each of the observed adjustments, two important functions may be (1) the compensation for stress-induced
changes in photosynthesis and (2) the reduction of the energetic budget for nitrogen assimilation. These changes in

primary metabolic processes are undoubtedly tightly tied
to the specific stress responses and signaling mechanisms
discussed below.
Much of the shared Cu and H2O2 response consisted
in genes related to signal transduction and ROS scavenging. This result points out that the Cu-induced ROS
formation activates a large set of stress acclimation
mechanisms. Apart from the overlapping response, several genes were regulated exclusively under Cu stress,
suggesting that this heavy metal may induce the production of ROSs different from those produced under H2O2
stress, such as O2− or •HO. In relation to signal transduction, we detected down-regulation of several E. siliculosus
genes encoding enzymes involved in myo-inositol (MI)
metabolism, a conserved process in plants and metazoans [10,40]. Recent studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated the importance of MI in oxidative and
phytohormone-related stress responses. Using catalasedeficient A. thaliana mutant plants, Chaouch and Noctor
[41] observed that MI abolished salicylic acid-dependent
cell death and pathogen defense responses triggered by
peroxisomal H2O2. As mentioned by Meng et al. [42] and
Donahue et al. [43], a connection has been previously
observed between MI synthesis and cell death by studying
L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase mutants. While
our data indicates that a similar link between oxidative
stress and the MI pathway may exist in E. siliculosus, it
remains to be assessed whether the underlying functions or regulatory mechanisms are the same as those
found in A. thaliana. Besides the direct signaling functions of MI, multi-phosphorylated forms of inositol
such as IP5 or IP6 are key cofactors of the plant auxin
(SCFTIR1) and jasmonate (SCFCOI1) ubiquitin ligase receptor complexes, therefore playing fundamental roles

Ritter et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/116

in phytohormone perception [44]. Methyl-jasmonate
(MeJA) was detected in our experiments, but its contents did not change significantly (p > 0.05) under the
tested conditions. Previous studies have shown that exogenous treatments with MeJA activate defensive mechanisms in several brown algae [45-47]. The synthetic
pathway of MeJA has not yet been functionally characterized in brown algae and, moreover, the E. siliculosus genome contains neither homologs of land plant JA receptors
nor components of the core transcriptional regulatory
complex such as MYCs, JAZs, NINJA and COI1 [24,48].
This suggests that this molecule may not exert the same
functions in brown algae as in land plants or that this
compound has evolved to serve similar functions but
using different regulatory systems. However, 8 h of Custress triggered the accumulation of C18 plant-like cyclic
oxylipins such as 12-OPDA, PPA1 and PPA2, together
with C20:4 cyclic prostaglandins such as PGA2 and PGJ2
in E. siliculosus, and this is in agreement with previous observations made in the kelp L. digitata [22]. In other organisms these compounds are derived from enzymatic
(PGA2, PGJ2, and 12-OPDA) or non-enzymatic (PPA1)
processes. All of these fatty acids derivatives contain α,βunsaturated carbonyl groups and belong to the group of
reactive electrophilic species [49]. In land plants, previous
studies have demonstrated that 12-OPDA and phytoprostanes play important roles in environmental stress and
pathogenesis, acting independently of MeJA, by activating
general detoxification and stress responses including HSPs
and ABC transporters [50,51]. In this sense, one of the
most highly up-regulated genes under copper treatment
featuring some sequence similarity with members of the
cytochrome P450 CYP74 family is an interesting candidate
for AOS activity in E. siliculosus, but further experiments
will be required to determine the function of this protein
with certainty. In our study, we also observed changes in
the expression of genes similar to those regulated by RES
in land plants. It is therefore reasonable to speculate about
(partially) conserved physiological roles of these oxylipins
in E. siliculosus. Detailed transcriptomic experiments
using each of these compounds as elicitor must be carried
out to test these hypotheses. However, the increase of
octadecanoid and eicosanoid oxygenated fatty acid derivatives suggest that brown algae may use plant-like octadecanoid signals and animal-like eicosanoid oxylipins, which
are absent in vascular plants, to regulate protective mechanisms or stress responses.
Metal transport is a key process in the interaction of
algae with their environments [52], and Cu treatment
induced several potential membrane transport mechanisms in E. siliculosus. Of special interest was the upregulation of a putative ortholog of A. thaliana Cu2+
P1B-type ATPases. Such proteins play an important role
in Cu compartmentalization and excretion in plant

Page 11 of 17

roots, and corresponding mutants in A. thaliana are Cuhypersensitive [12]. In the same vein, five ABC transporters were up-regulated in response to Cu stress, two
of which belong to the B and C sub-families known to
participate in the transport of xenobiotics, and of glutathione or phytochelatin conjugates in land plants and
animals [31,32]. Additionally, members of the sub-family
C, such as the human MRP1, have been shown to act as
transporter of eicosanoids such as leukotrienes [31], suggesting a possible link between the concomitant induction of an MRP homolog in E. siliculosus and of C20
oxylipin production in our study. Furthermore, several
putative transporters of the sub-family A are regulated
under Cu stress in E. siliculosus and might be involved
in lipid trafficking processes in regard to the function of
these proteins in land plants and mammals [53,54]. Detoxification transporters of the MATE family and GRX/
malate fusion proteins also seem to play a role in Cudetoxification in E. siliculosus. In rice, MATEs are
involved in aluminium (Al) resistance by secreting Alcitrate conjugates [55]. Assuming similar functions in
E. siliculosus, our observation would suggest that the
up-regulation of genes encoding these transporters is related to the secretion of Cu-conjugates, and thus that
some processes involved in Cu detoxification are conserved across very distant lineages. In contrast, among
the mechanisms that seem to be specific to brown algae,
one is based on halide metabolism. The E. siliculosus
genome contains only one gene coding for a putative
vBPO, and this gene was up-regulated under Cu stress.
The accumulation of this vBPO protein and an increase
in the corresponding enzyme activity in both a coppertolerant and a copper-sensitive strain of E. siliculosus
(i.e. the strain used in this study) in response to chronic
Cu stress conditions have previously been reported [21],
supporting the potential role of this enzyme in specific
brown algal ROS detoxification processes.

Conclusions
This study provides an overview of copper stress acclimation in E. siliculosus, and highlights a number of processes that seem to be conserved with metazoans or
land plants. Of interest for future brown algal research is
the potential cross-talk between ROS, MI, and oxylipin
signaling. Considering that two thirds of the regulated
genes identified through this work encode proteins of
unknown function, many additional components of the
stress response remain to be discovered. The number of
available medium to high throughput datasets related to
stress response in brown algae is still limited [56], and
the analysis of such results paves the way to decipher
some of the molecular mechanisms leading to acclimation of these organisms to their frequently changing environment. They will be complemented by follow-up

Ritter et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/116

studies benefiting from the development of new techniques and protocols for brown algae, such as reverse
genetics (transformation, RNAi, and tilling) or the assessment of nucleic acid-protein and protein-protein
interactions.

Methods
Cultivation of plant material and experimental set-up

E. siliculosus (Ectocarpales, Phaeophyceae) unialgal strain
32 (CCAP accession 1310/4) was cultivated in Provasolienriched natural seawater at 14°C using a 14/10 h photoperiod and a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
intensity of 40 μmol m−2 s−1 provided by Philips daylight
fluorescent tubes, in 10 L Nalgene flasks under constant
aeration. Experiments were carried out with 0.45 μm filtered natural seawater (FSW) that was collected offshore
at Roscoff (+48°46′40,-3°56′15), a site with no direct
chemical influence from the shore and presenting dissolved copper concentrations ranging from 5 to 10 nM
(Riso et al. personal communication). FSW was then
treated to avoid potentially chelating organic matter by
adding 0.2 g L−1 activated charcoal (Merck, Germany)
overnight. Treated water was filtered at 0.45 μm to remove
charcoal. Copper stress was triggered by transferring the
algae to fresh seawater free of organic matter and enriched
with Cu(II) as CuCl2 (Merck, Germany) at nominal
final concentrations of 250 or 500 μg L−1 (i.e. 1.8 μM
and 3.7 μM), in 1 L glass flasks washed overnight with
1% HCl to limit Cu adsorption. Neither nutrients, nor
EDTA, were added during the experiments. After 4 and
8 h, replicate cultures were harvested by gentle filtration, algal material was briefly dried using a paper
towel, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For
metabolomic profiling, four replicate cultures (250 μg L−1
of CuCl2, as well as corresponding controls) were harvested at each time point. Transcriptomic profiling was
carried out in triplicate.
Measurement of PSII maximum quantum yield

To monitor the stress intensity caused by Cu treatments
in algal tissues, maximum quantum yield of PSII (dark
adapted) was measured in one-hour intervals as Fv/Fm
using a Walz Phyto-PAM (Waltz, Germany) as previously
described [21]. Since photosynthesis is stress-sensitive, the
quantum yield decreased under sub-optimal (stressful)
conditions. Statistically significant differences in Fv/Fm
values between treatments were determined by a zadjusted Mann–Whitney U test performed using Statistica
5.1 (Statsoft, USA; p < 0.05).
Double strand cDNA sample preparation and microarray
hybridization

RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg (wet
weight) of tissue following Apt et al. [57] with modifications

Page 12 of 17

as described by Le Bail et al. [58], using a CTAB-based
extraction buffer and subsequent phenol-chloroform
purification, LiCl-precipitation, and DNAse (Turbo
DNAse, Ambion, Austin, USA) steps. RNA quality and
quantity was then verified on a 1% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide and a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, respectively. Double strand cDNA synthesis and amplification were carried out with the SMART
cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, Mountain View, USA) and
the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes, Espoo,
Finland) starting from 100 ng of total RNA, according to a
protocol validated by Dittami et al. [25]. The optimal
number of amplification cycles was determined by semiquantitative PCR, and ranged from 20 to 25 for our samples. The PCR products were purified by first vortexing
with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1), then by precipitating the aqueous phase with 0.5
volumes of 7.5 M NH4OH, 6 μg of nuclease-free Glycogen
(Ambion, Austin, USA), and 2.4 volumes of ethanol. After
centrifugation at RT (20 min at 14,000 g), the pellet was
washed with 70% EtOH, centrifuged (10 min at 14,000 g
and RT) and resuspended in 14 μL of H2O. To finish,
cDNAs were run on an agarose gel and quantified with a
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer, to ensure that
they met the requirements for hybridization by Roche
NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA) (concentration > 250 μg L−1,
A260/280 ≥ 1.7, A260/230 ≥ 1.5, median size ≥ 400 bp).
Samples were Cy3-labeled and hybridized to the E. siliculosus EST-based Roche NimbleGen 4-plex expression
array [ArrayExpress:A-MEXP-1445], described in [25].
It is based on a set of 90,637 expressed sequence tags,
corresponding to 8,165 contigs and 8,874 singletons, although in some cases, several contigs/singletons belonging to the same genomic locus had not been
assembled. In total, the 17,039 contigs/singletons cover
about 10,600 of the 16,256 predicted unique genes in
the E. siliculosus genome [59]. Each of the contigs/singletons is represented by four unique 60-mer probes on
the array.
Validation of microarray results using quantitative PCR

To assess the reliability of fold-change estimations in
mRNA abundance by microarray, sixteen genes that exhibited diverse expression patterns in the microarray
analysis were analyzed by real time quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR): eight up-regulated, five down-regulated, and
three without significant changes (Additional file 10).
RT-qPCR was performed as previously described [58],
using the three experimental replicates that were also
employed in the microarray experiment. Briefly, SYBR
green assays were used to determine cDNA copy numbers based on gDNA standard curves ranging from 37
to 48671 copies of the E. siliculosus genome. All primer
pairs used are given in Additional file 10. Amplification

Ritter et al. BMC Plant Biology 2014, 14:116
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/14/116

efficiencies were determined for each primer pair and
ranged from 90–110%. Furthermore, melting curve analyses were run to confirm that only one product was
amplified, and the mN primer pair targeting an intron
was used to verify the absence of any genomic DNA
[58]. The geometric mean of two reference genes, EF1
(translation elongation factor 1 alpha) and UBCE (ubiquitin
conjugating enzyme) was then used to normalize gene
expression. Most tested genes had similar expression
profiles in both the microarray and the RT-qPCR experiment. We observed an overall correlation r2 of 0.82
between the experiments, indicating good reproducibility
(Additional file 10). Different expression patterns between
microarray and qPCR were obtained only for two genes
coding for a putative zinc/iron permease (ZnFePer) and a
tyrosinase-like protein (TYR).
Statistical analysis of microarray experiments

Normalization and probe averaging of raw microarray
data were carried out by Roche Nimblegen using quantile normalization [60], and the robust multichip average
algorithm [61]. Normalized microarray signals were then
log2-transformed and analysed in a two-way ANOVA
with time (4 h, 8 h) and stress (0 or 250 μg L−1 Cu) as
factors using TIGR MeV 4.4 [62]. In this analysis, the
false discovery rate (FDR) was limited to 5% according
to Benjamini and Hochberg [63]. In parallel, a metaanalysis was carried out to compare our data to a previous dataset available for other stressors [25]. Transcripts
previously found to be significantly regulated (p < 0.05,
fold-change compared to control > 2) after either 6 h
[25] or 4 h or 8 h (this study) were taken into account,
but to reduce the impact of false negatives on this analysis no FDR correction was applied here. The results of
the meta-analysis are therefore useful to determine
which conditions a gene was regulated in, but not to
generate lists of significant genes. Hierarchical clustering
of data both from Cu stress- and previously published
oxidative and salt stress experiments [25] was carried
out with TigrMEV version 4.8 using the HCL-support tree
function (100 bootstrap replicates). For this analysis, log2ratios (stress/control) were calculated for each replicate,
and Euclidian distance was used as distance matrix.
Automatic annotation of contigs/singletons

For the purpose of generating automatic genome annotations, the contigs/singletons used for the microarray
design [25] were replaced by the full coding sequence
using data from the E. siliculosus genome project [24].
To this end, all contigs/singletons were blasted against the
complete data set of predicted mRNAs (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/gdb/ectocarpus/Archive/Ectsi_mRNA_
Aug2011.tfa.gz). Different thresholds were tested for these
blast searches, with e-value cutoffs from 1e-20 to 1e-5, and

Page 13 of 17

identity cutoffs from 80% to 99%. Only identity-cutoffs >
95% and e-value cutoffs < 1e-15 resulted in a reduction
of the number of sequences with a blast hit. After manual examination of the blast results in question, an
identity-cutoff of 90% and an e-value cutoff of 1e-10
were chosen for further analyses. If a blast hit was
found to match these criteria, the original sequence
was replaced by the complete mRNA sequence for annotation purposes. These results were also used to determine the corresponding genomic loci throughout the
manuscript. If no corresponding genomic locus was
found using this approach, previously generated correspondences available [64] were used, as these allowed
for longer UTRs than those predicted in the genome.
All sequences presenting differential expression were
automatically annotated and classified following a procedure previously described [25]. Briefly, annotation
was carried out with KEGG orthology (KO) numbers
using the KO-Based Annotation System KOBAS [65]
and with Gene Ontology (GO) terms [66] using the GO
Term Prediction and Evaluation Tool GOPET [67].
Phylogenetic analysis and protein fold prediction

Candidate ABC transporters were identified in the E.
siliculosus genome based on manual annotations [24] or
the presence of the “ABC_tran” PFAM motif, and classified according to Dean et al. [31]. To this end, protein
sequences of classified human [31] and A. thaliana [32]
ABC transporters, as well as the candidate E. siliculosus
sequences, were aligned to the “ABC_tran” motive with
Hmmer3 [68]. The resulting alignment formed the basis
for maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction using
PhyML 3.0 [69]. Analyses were carried out with the LG
substitution model [70], a discrete gamma model, and an
estimated proportion of invariable sites of 0.006, as these
parameters were found to best describe the data using
ProtTest 2.4 [70]. An approximate likelihood ratio test was
used to evaluate the robustness of the best tree and results
were plotted using MEGA 5.1 [71]. Protein fold prediction
was carried out with the Phyre2 automatic fold recognition
server [72] using the intensive modelling mode [73].
Metabolite profiling and data analysis

After harvesting, samples were freeze-dried and ground
in a mortar. For each sample, 250 ng of 12-OH-lauric
acid was added as an internal standard. Extraction was
carried out from 300 mg (fresh weight) of algal material
during 1 h at 4°C with 1 ml MeOH:H2O (8:2) Samples
were then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 15 min at 4°C. Aliquots of the supernatants were then used for metabolomic
analysis by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography
coupled to mass spectrometry analysis (UPLC-MS), and
for gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) profiling.

autosampler. Separations were achieved using an Acclaim RSLC 120 C18 1.9 μm (2.1 × 100 mm) column
(Dionex; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France)
maintained at 20°C using 5 μL injection volume and a
flow-rate of 250 μL min−1. Mobile phase A was composed of 0.1% acetic acid in H2O, and mobile phase B
was 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile. The gradient consisted of an initial hold at 20% mobile phase B for
2 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 8 min
and a hold for 14 min, followed by re-equilibration for
6 min at 20% B, for a total run time of 30 min. Mass
spectrometry was performed on a Thermo Scientific
LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery™ mass spectrometer. Scans
were collected in both positive and negative ESI mode
over a range of m/z 50–1000. Ionization parameters were
set as follows: sheath gas 5 psi, auxiliary gas 5 (arbitrary
units), sweep gas 0 (arbitrary units), spray voltage 2.7 kV,
capillary temperature 300°C, capillary voltage 60 V, tube
lens voltage 127 V and heater temperature 300°C. The
Xcalibur 2.1 software was used for instrument control and
data acquisition. Raw files were converted to the mzXML
format using MassMatrix File Conversion Tools (Version
3.9, April 2011). Data were processed by XCMS [74] running under R or on the online version, using the parameters listed in Additional file 11, and further annotated by
CAMERA [75]. This approach allowed detecting 392
monoisotopic peaks, among which 31 free fatty acids
and oxylipins were further identified by comparison
with standards and mass spectral databases Metlin,
HMDB and MassBank.
GC-MS was used for profiling of amino acids. To this
end, 100 μL aliquots of the MeOH:H2O (8:2) fraction were
evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended
in 60 μL of 20 g L−1 methoxyamine-hydrochloride (SigmaAldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) in pyridine
before incubation at 60°C for 1 h. After addition of 50 μL
of N,O-bis(trimethylsisyl)trifluoroacetamide, samples were
incubated 1 h at 40°C and then at room temperature overnight before injection. Derivatized metabolites were analyzed by GC-MS using an Agilent GC 6890+ coupled to
a 5975 MS Detector (Agilent, Les Ulis, France) and
equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D. ×
0.25 μm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Agilent) in the EI
mode at 70 eV. The temperature gradient used was
60°C for 5 min, 60–120°C at 30°C min−1, 120–290°C
at 4°C min−1, and 290°C for 10 min. Sixteen amino
acids were identified by comparison with standards.
By combining the data obtained in both positive and
negative ion mode by UPLC-MS and by GC-MS, 47
metabolites corresponding to fatty acids, oxylipins, and
amino acids could be reliably identified. Multivariate
statistical analyses of metabolite data were carried out

Page 14 of 17

using SIMCA-P (12.0.1, Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). Data
were log10-transformed and normalized using Pareto scaling. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
was carried out on the 392 monoisotopic peaks detected
by the UPLC-MS analysis, and also independently on free
fatty acids and on the amino acids. Hierarchical clustering
analysis of the 392 peaks was carried out with TigrMeV as
described for gene expression data, except that metabolite
quantities were normalized by dividing all values by the
highest value obtained in any of the conditions tested (all
normalized values ranged from 0 to 1) instead of calculating log2-ratios. A similar analysis was also performed for
the 47 identified metabolites, and their relative quantities
were further analysed using a two-way ANOVA in analogy
to the gene expression data (see above).
Availability of supporting data

Microarray data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress
database [76] under the accession number E-MTAB-1286.
The Blast2GO database generated for this array is available at the Ectocarpus Transcriptomics Homepage [64].
