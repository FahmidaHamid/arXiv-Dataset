The large scale behaviour of a population of cells that grow and interact through the concentration
field of the chemicals they secrete is studied using dynamical renormalization group methods. The
combination of the effective long-range chemotactic interaction and lack of number conservation
leads to a rich variety of phase behaviour in the system, which includes a sharp transition from a
phase that has moderate (or controlled) growth and regulated chemical interactions to a phase with
strong (or uncontrolled) growth and no chemical interactions. The transition point has nontrivial
critical exponents. Our results might help shed light on the interplay between chemical signalling
and growth in tissues and colonies, and in particular on the challenging problem of cancer metastasis.

Chemotactic cell motility has attracted a lot of interest
in biology and medical research, as it plays an essential
role in cancer metastasis [1], leukocyte extravasation, angiogenesis, wound healing and embryogenesis [2], through
signalling that involves various molecules (e.g. growth
factors) and is mediated by the extracellular matrix [3].
Bacteria such as E. coli [4] have developed an efficient
run-and-tumble search strategy for the needed chemicals
[5] by coupling sensing of the chemicals—that is accentuated through an elaborate clustering mechanism for
the protein receptors [6]—to the motility machinery via
signalling pathways that have a feedback control on the
preferred direction of the rotation of the flagellar motors
[7, 8]. The situation is more complex with eukaryotic
chemotaxis, where the motility mechanisms are typically
much more elaborate, e.g. involving actin polymerization
or coordinated motion of thousands of molecular motors
[9]. On a more coarse-grained level, however, the resulting motion can be phenomenologically modelled as
a directed mobility towards (away from) increasing concentrations of molecules that act as chemo-attractant (repellant) [10]. This level of description has been successfully used to study a variety of interesting effects in
bacterial behaviour such as auto-chemotaxis, where single bacteria are influenced by their own chemotactic field
[11–13], and collective behaviour of bacteria caused by
the chemical interactions, such as the chemotactic collapse [10, 14, 15] and other forms of nonequilibrium pattern formation [16, 17]. Similar behaviours have been discussed for active colloids that communicate via the same
type of long-range interactions [18–21]. Coarse-grained
theories for active systems have been shown to apply to
a whole variety of—seemingly unrelated—collective phenomena in biology such as flocks of birds, schools of fish,
aggregations of molecular motors, and dynamic reorganization of growing tissues [22–32].
One of the characteristic features of the long-time dynamics of living cells is that number conservation does
not hold due to cell division and death processes, which
has consequences on their collective behaviour [31]. The

combined effect of this nonequilibrium property of a
colony of living cells—that we model using a generic
growth rule [33]—and long-range chemotactic interactions among the cells is what we aim to study in this
Letter. The schematics of the model is shown in Fig. 1.
We show that in the relevant continuum description for
long-time and large-scale behaviour of such a colony of
cells, which we study using dynamical renormalization
group (RG) methods, the two nonlinear terms representing the cell division process and chemotaxis appear at
the same degree of relevance. The competition between
them leads to a sharp transition from a phase that is
controlled by a weakly coupled perturbatively accessible
fixed point to a phase controlled by a nonaccessible strong
coupling fixed point. The weakly coupled fixed point has
well defined values for the strength of the chemical interaction and the growth rate. At the strong coupling fixed
point, the chemical interaction becomes much less significant in competition with growth, which will collectively
exhibit much larger effective rates. The weakly coupled
fixed point itself corresponds to a modified chemotactic
collapse transition: when the strength of the chemotactic attraction is larger than a threshold that depends on
the growth rate, the cells are strongly attracted towards
each other and collapse into a dense structure, while for
smaller values of the chemotactic coupling the cells are
dispersed into a dilute solution since the chemical attraction is not enough to overcome the diffusion. At the
perturbatively accessible fixed-point, we are able to calculate critical exponents that describe a continuous phase

corresponds to the phase transition, and can be experimentally approach by tuning any of the parameters involved, e.g.

transition. We find that the cells exhibit superdiffusive
motion at the dynamical critical point, where the meansquare displacement of the cells behaves as tα , where e.g.
α = 1.72 in two dimensions.
We consider single cells that release chemicals and
thus create a long-range concentration field φ(r, t) around
them. Other cells in the suspension will then swim towards or away from the mobile chemical sources, depending on the type of cells and chemicals. Here we will assume that the response of the cells is linear with respect
to the concentration gradient, such that a concentration
field effectively acts as an interaction potential that leads
to an effective drift. In a dissipative environment where
inertial effects are negligible, the equation of motion for
a single cell i then reads ∂t ri = −µ ∇φ|r=ri (t) plus Brownian noise. Here, µ is the mobility of a cell that can be
positive or negative, depending on whether the cells repel or attract each other (unit of µ: [length]2+d /[time]

noise: hfα (r, t)fβ (r′ , t′ )i = δαβ δ(r − r′ )δ(t − t′ ). Note
that this Langevin equation for the density is exact and
contains the same information as the N -body stochastic Langevin equations [34, 35]. Moreover, using phenomenological arguments, one can use the same scheme
for a continuous coarse-grained density C(r, t) even when
it cannot be described exactly as a sum of δ-functions,
while keeping track of the fluctuations [35].
We now extend the model phenomenologically by
adding a source term L(C) that describes cell division
and death and a noise g(r, t) that breaks the cell number
conservation:

where hg(r, t)g(r′ , t′ )i = δ(r − r′ )δ(t − t′ ). We choose
the logistic growth rule that corresponds to L(C) =
λC(C0 − C) [33], where C0 is the carrying capacity,
and λ is an effective growth rate per unit concentration (unit of λ: [length]d /[time]). However, all our results are valid for any generic form for L(C) provided
L(C0 ) = 0 and L′ (C)|C0 < 0 [31], since higher order
terms in an expansion of the growth term renormalize
to zero under RG. The strength of the nonequilibrium
noise corresponding to number fluctuations, M (C), is in
general a function of the concentration and can be derived for any given form of the growth rule (unit of M :
[time]−1 × [length]−d ) [36]. For example, using a stochastic growth and coagulation process, one can derive the
expression M (C) = λC(C0 + C)/2 (see Appendix I).
To simplify the multiplicative noise term, we assume
that the density fluctuates around a constant background
of C0 ; hence, we define the density via C(r, t) = C0 +
ρ(r, t) and expand in ρ/C0 up to the lowest order nonlinearity. Then the equation for the density fluctuations
becomes

The coarse-graining associated with the rescaling leads to
corrections to the bare quantities in the Green function,
noise correlator and the three-point function, which can
be found by integrating out short-range degrees of freedom. The Feynman diagrams in Fig. 3 provide a graphical representation of the lowest-order perturbative corrections to the bare quantities (see Appendix II). Coarsegraining corresponds to evaluating the (wavevector) integrals from Λe−ℓ to Λ to eliminate large wavenumbers,
where Λ = 2π/a is an upper cutoff in Fourier space and
thus inversely proportional to a microscopic lengthscale
a, which is set by the size of the cells.

terms of the bare quantities defined in (d), namely G0 (k̂) =

We note that the cells will typically also experience
short-range interactions, for example from excludedvolume effects. However, these interactions are irrelevant
in RG sense as compared to the Coulomb-like interactions. To see this, consider adding
to Eq. (1) a term of
R
the form ξ∇(C∇Ψ) with Ψ = dd r0 C(r
R 0 , t)G(r − r0 )) to
account for short-range interactions ( G(r)dr = const.).
This term will scale as b2χ−2 , while the long-range interaction term scales as b2χ . Therefore, we can ignore the
short-range interactions for the purpose of studying the
critical properties of the system.

characteristics of the system (introduced above) as follows: ν1bare = µα0 , ν2bare = 2λ, θbare = (µα0 + λ)C0 ,
D0bare = λC02 , and D2bare = DC0 . Ignoring the nonlinearities, Eq. (2) tells us that the uniform density phase is
stable for θ > 0, and signals a clumping instability that
corresponds to chemotactic collapse at θ = 0, which corresponds to a new threshold of µ < λ/α0 for chemotactic
collapse for dividing cells, as opposed to µ = 0 [10]. The
properties of the system at the phase transition could
be studied by implementing a perturbative treatment of
the nonlinear terms within a dynamical RG formulation
[37, 38].
The underlying assumption of RG calculations is invariance of Eq. (2) under rescaling space (r → eℓ r) and

values of the coupling constants in Eq. (2) remain fixed
under RG flow. This condition gives a nontrivial fixed
point [see Fig.
p 2(a)] corresponding to fixed point values ν1∗ = −3 D3 (χ + z)/ [πKd (D0 + D2 Λ2 )] and ν2∗ =
− 34 ν1∗ , indicating that both chemotaxis and cell growth
are relevant for the collective dynamics of cells at the
collapse transition. Around the fixed point, we find a
flow depicted in Fig. 2(a). Starting with ν1 and ν2 below a dimension-dependent threshold value indicated by
a separatrix in Fig. 2(a), the flow will go towards ν1∗ and
ν2∗ . Above the threshold, however, the system will be
controlled by a perturbatively non-accessible fixed point
with runaway behaviour. Runaway flows have been commonly associated with first-order transitions [41] but this
is not guaranteed unless the flow goes to a region where
a first order transition can be established using a meanfield approximation [42]. Here, the flow will move the
system to a region where noise and growth dominate
and chemotaxis is irrelevant. Thus, above the threshold, Eq. (2) will belong to the class of Fisher equations, which are known to exhibit instabilities, nonlinear fronts and chaos [43–45]. To decide on the nature
of the phase transition, an analysis of the Fisher-type
equation under consideration of short-range interactions
is needed. Below the threshold we also find that the fixed

will be controlled by the nontrivial fixed point if the bare

D0 and D2 lead to a (perturbatively accessible) nontrivial
stable fixed point in the physically relevant dimensions
(d ≤ 4) as shown in Fig. 4(a). The fixed point has both
equilibrium and nonequilibrium components, highlighting that even a starting point with a bare value for noise
that has no nonequilibrium component, i.e. G = 0, this
type of noise will be generated through the RG process.
Figure 4(b) shows the values for the exponents z
and χ, which are numerically exact within this order
of perturbation theory, and the values for dimensions
d = (1, 2, 3) are tabulated in Table I. These critical exponents imply anomalous diffusion and density fluctuations, which could be experimentally probed. The single cell mean-square displacement behaves as ∆L2 (t) =
h[r(t) − r(0)]2 i ∼ t2/z = tα , which implies superdiffusive behaviour in two and three dimensions (see Table I).
The scaling form of density correlations hρ(r, t)ρ(r′ , t)i ∼
|r − r′ |2χ can be used
R to calculate the overall number
fluctuations ∆N 2 = dd rdd r′ hρ(r, t)ρ(r′ , t)i leading to
∆N ∼ Ld+χ = Lβ . Note that for a system of particles with no interaction and cell division the exponents χ = −d and z = 2 would hold, which correspond
to normal diffusion and no scaling for number fluctuations. The calculations yield a negative exponent z in
a one-dimensional system, which would result in finite
mean-square displacements corresponding to localization
of cells.
Our predictions could be tested in experiments if it is
possible to control the parameters involved such as the
cell carrying capacity C0 , the growth rate λ or the diffusion constant D. From Fig. 2(b) one can see that the
phase transition could be detected when the average time
a cell takes to move by a distance of the order of its own
size is comparable with the rate of cell division. For tumor cells, typical cell division rates are of the order of
10−5 /s [39]. With an estimated viscosity of soft tissues
of 1 Pa s [40] and a cell body length of the order of 10 µm,
the estimated diffusion constant will be ∼ 10−4 µm2 /s,
which shows that the desired order of magnitude for the
effect is well within reach. We could speculate that the
separatrix in Fig. 2(a) might be interpreted as signaling
a transition to a phase where growth and number fluctuations dominate. Characterization of this transition,
however, is beyond the scope of our simple perturbative
description. Interestingly, the chemotactic interactions

5
are prominent in controlling the large-scale behaviour of
the system together with the cell division dynamics.
In summary, we have applied dynamical RG to study
the collective behaviour of cells which undergo chemotaxis and division, and are under the influence of nonnumber-conserving nonequilibrium noise. We find a rich
phase diagram, which in some parameter regime predicts
a critical phase transition with nontrivial exponents that
can be calculated perturbatively, and suggest anomalous
diffusion of cells and long-range correlations. Our results
might help shed light on the question of what controls
the communication between strongly dividing cells that
are far apart and their collective behaviour. This could
help us towards addressing the fundamentally challenging
questions of what determines the sharp onset of metastasis and how the metacommunity of metastatic cells across
the body of a cancer patient could still coordinate their
activities [1].

APPENDIX I: Derivation of the Nonequilibrium
Noise
As discussed, the exact form of the density dependence
of the noise that describes number fluctuations will depend on the specific process. Here we use a simple model
to study the interplay between stochastic growth and coagulation that leads to death, and use it to derive a noisy
logistic growth equation [36]. We will then use the microscopic calculation to derive an expression for the noise
strength M .
Let us first consider a volume V in which we study the
growth-coagulation process described as

A + A → A with rate Υ,

We used the convention ρ(r, t) = dk̂/(2π)d+1 ρ(k̂)eiωt−ikx . For brevity, k̂ is defined as k̂ := (k, ω). One can define
the bare Green’s function G0 (k̂) = [iω + Dk 2 + θ]−1 , which will diverge for θ = 0 at large length- and long time-scales
(ω → 0, k → 0). In additon, we define the bare noise correlator D0 (k) = D0 + D2 k 2 and the effective vertex function
Γ0 (k, q) = Γ0 (k, k − q) = − 12 (ν1 k · q/(q)2 + ν1 k · (k − q)(k − q)2 + ν2 ).
This divergence indicates that the large-scale behaviour of the cells will be self-similar for θ → 0. In the following,
we will focus solely on this case. We rewrite Eq. (11) as

The rescaling of length- and timescales in general leads
to corrections of the bare quantities in Eq. (13). These
corrections can be found by integrating out short-range
degrees of freedom. If the scaling factor b is chosen as
b = eℓ this corresponds to evaluating the integrals in
Eqs. (13) from Λe−ℓ to Λ, to eliminate large wavelengths
