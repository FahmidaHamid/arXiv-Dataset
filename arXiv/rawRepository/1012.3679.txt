The design of protocols to suppress the propagation of viral infections is an enduring enterprise, especially
hindered by limited knowledge of the mechanisms through which extinction of infection propagation comes
about. We here report on a mechanism causing extinction of a propagating infection due to intraspecific competition to infect susceptible hosts. Beneficial mutations allow the pathogen to increase the production of progeny,
while the host cell is allowed to develop defenses against infection. When the number of susceptible cells is
unlimited, a feedback runaway co-evolution between host resistance and progeny production occurs. However,
physical space limits the advantage that the virus can obtain from increasing offspring numbers, thus infection
clearance may result from an increase in host defenses beyond a finite threshold. Our results might be relevant
to better understand propagation of viral infections in tissues with mobility constraints, and the implications that
environments with different geometrical properties might have in devising control strategies.

One of the common strategies used by viruses to ensure
fast adaptation is the steady production of mutants and of
enormous amounts of progeny, two characteristics that challenge the design of therapies able to induce viral extinction.
Increased mutagenesis has been successfully used in vitro to
eradicate infectivity, though there is no general agreement on
the pathways through which extinction supervenes [1–4]. In
mutational meltdown, the population becomes extinct because
the average growth rate falls below one, through a process
different from the error threshold predicted by classical quasispecies models [5] or from stochastic extinction of infectivity [6, 7]. The progress of an infection is further conditioned
by the geometry of the space where it occurs [8–10]. Experiments with viruses infecting bacteria have highlighted differences in the internal structure of populations evolving in liquid
medium or on bacterial monolayers [11]. These results might
give clues to treat viral infections of two-dimensional tissues:
It has been shown that space induces a remarkably strict clustering of the propagation in crops [12], in leaves [13], and in
lawns of cells [14]. Advances in therapy design ask for an
improved understanding of the mechanisms causing viral extinction, before they can be applied in vivo.
Models of viral evolution necessarily make simplifying assumptions, and real virus behavior often deviates substantially
from their predictions [15]. Current quasispecies models implement high mutation rates that yield heterogeneous populations —a property of most viruses infecting plants [16] and
of many viral populations on cellular monolayers [17]. One
common approximation is to assume that all new mutations
have a deleterious effect on fitness, thus neglecting beneficial
and neutral mutations. However, adaptation occurs frequently,
and even at low population numbers. Classical quasispecies
models assumed the existence of a unique master sequence
of high fitness, while we currently know that a huge amount
of different sequences yield phenotypes that perform equally
well. When beneficial and neutral mutations are considered,
extinction might supervene through mechanisms other than

error thresholds [4]. The predictions yielded by models of
viral evolution depend on whether physical space is explicitly
considered or not [18]. In quasispecies models, cell-to-cell
transmission or local transport of viruses unavoidably results
in a lower value of the critical error threshold [19, 20]. Clusterization of viral types is responsible for the latter effect, as
well as for enhancing the coexistence of types in the quasispecies [10, 21].
In this Letter we introduce a model representing the propagation of infections on two dimensional arrays of cells. We
incorporate two realistic features of infection propagation often disregarded in quasispecies models: a non-negligible fraction of beneficial mutations and a host resistance to infection.
We show that with spare susceptible cells at each generation,
the virus can escape host resistance by increasing its progeny.
However, when viruses compete for infecting cells, increasing
the progeny does not pay and infection clearance occurs at a
finite value of the host resistance. In this case the model boils
down to a multicomponent generalization of the DomanyKinzel (DK) probabilistic cellular automaton [22] hence classifying viral extinction within the directed percolation (DP)
universality class, alongside with propagation of immiscible
fluids in porous media and other similar problems.
In the model, a viral population is described as an ensemble of (pheno)types, each characterized by a replicative ability r = 0, . . . , R standing for the number of offspring able to
infect cells produced by each type under replication. Deleterious or beneficial mutations decrease or increase (with probabilities p and q respectively) offspring’s replicative ability in
one unit. Susceptible cells have a resistance to infection π,
i.e., a viral particle can infect a cell with probability 1 − π.
For simplicity, we consider that the dynamics proceeds in discrete generations.
Assume first that the availability of susceptible cells is large
enough for every viral particle with r > 0 to actually meet
a cell to infect, no matter its replicative ability r. This is
a mean-field dynamical description, where infection occurs

2
with a probability 1 − π. If nr (t) denotes the number of viral
particles of type r at generation t, for 1 ≤ r < R

ri (t) = r1 and ri+1 (t) = r2 , is
P (r|r1 , r2 ) =π r1 +r2 δr,0 + 1 − π r1 +r2

nr (t + 1) = (1 − π) [r(1 − p − q)nr (t)
+ (r + 1)pnr+1 (t) + (r − 1)qnr−1 (t)] ,
nR (t + 1) = (1 − π) [R(1 − p)nR (t) + (R − 1)qnR−1 (t)] .
(1)
Besides, there is a class r = 0 which has lost its replicative
ability and is maintained by class r = 1 through deleterious
mutations, i.e. n0 (t+1) = (1−π)pn1 (t). As initial condition
we take nr (0) = δr,R .
An exact analytic solution exists for the case q = 0, which
represents the worst situation for the survival of the virus: if
extinction does not occur for q = 0, it will not occur for q > 0
either. In the limit t → ∞, the population of every class grows
at a fixed rate, nr (t + 1) = λnr (t). System (1) then becomes
an eigenvalue problem, λ being its largest eigenvalue. For
q = 0, the asymptotic growth rate is λ = (1 − π)R(1 − p) and
the fraction of virus in class r is

Extinction occurs when λ ≤ 1, i.e., if the maximum progeny
production R ≤ Rc = (1 − π)−1 (1 − p)−1 . Although the
larger the resistance to infection of the cell π the more demanding becomes this condition, R can always be increased
beyond Rc to avoid extinction. If the number of susceptible cells is unlimited and increasing R always improves the
chances of survival of the pathogen, a runaway co-evolution
between the virus and the host is to be expected.
The case q = 0 is not representative of the situation when
q > 0 though. The stationary distribution (2) has a well defined R → ∞ limit, whereas the permanent improvement allowed when q > 0 forbids a steady state in the same limit.
As a matter of fact, it can be shown that in that case the viral
population grows superexponentially [23].
Consider now a restricted number of susceptible cells available. This occurs when cells have a spatial distribution and/or
when the mobility of viruses is limited. To assess the consequences of this constraint, we study the dynamics proceeding on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions.
Even if infection starts off from a single infected cell, the
propagating front becomes asymptotically flat [10]. Hence,
we consider that cells form arrays in one spatial dimension,
and infection advances one row of cells per generation. Let
ri (t) be the replicative ability of the individual occupying site
i = 1, . . . , L at generation t.
To account for the limited mobility of the viral particles,
they are constrained to infect only neighboring cells. Hence,
at generation t + 1 site i will be occupied by one of the offspring of the individuals at sites i or i + 1 at the parental
generation t. The probability that ri (t + 1) = r, given that

where pr,r−1 = p for r ≤ R, pr,r+1 = q and pr,r = 1 − p − q
for r < R, pR,R+1 = 0, and pR,R = 1−p. We take ri (0) = R
for all i = 1, . . . , L when the infection begins. According
to (3), the probability that the cell resists the viral attack is
given by π r1 +r2 , i.e. the probability that infection fails after
r1 + r2 independent trials. With the complementary probability 1 − π r1 +r2 infection occurs, and one individual randomly drawn among the r1 + r2 possible occupies the site. Its
replicative ability may change due to mutations as specified.
The limit case π → 1 describes an immune host, whereas in
the limit π → 0 the host plays no role in the progress of infection. Two relevant quantities that characterize the dynamical
state of the system are the spatial density ρ(t) of virus with
r ≥ 1 at time t and the average
PL replicative ability of the population r̄(t) = (ρ(t)L)−1 i=1 ri (t). A systematic study of
these two quantities in the limit t → ∞ as a function of p and
π portrays the asymptotic behavior of the model.
In the absence of beneficial mutations (q = 0), the class
with the highest r present disappears when p or π increase beyond a threshold value. These transitions are somehow analogous to the error threshold described for simple models of
quasispecies [5], where the master sequence disappears and
the population turns into a cloud of low-fitness replicating mutants. For constant resistance to infection π, there is a hierarchy of domains in the phase space where high−r classes are
sequentially lost as p increases (see Fig. 1). For increasing π,
the largest r−value present at global extinction increases.
There are two features of Fig. 1 for q = 0 which are
amenable to further analysis. The first one is the last error
threshold, when class r = 1 disappears. There is a mapping
of this transition to the DK cellular automaton. When only
classes r = 1 and r = 0 are present, sites are either replicative (occupied) or non-replicative (empty), yielding probabilities (3) P (1|0, 0) = 0, p1 ≡ P (1|1, 0) = P (1|0, 1) =
(1 − π)(1 − p), and p2 ≡ P (1|1, 1) = (1 − π 2 )(1 − p), which
define a DK automaton. Curve C in Fig. 1 coincides with the
DK transition cast in the variables (p, π) describing our model.
This curve meets the π = 0 axis at pc = 0.294510(6), a value
derived from the known site percolation critical point [24].
The second feature obtained from a mapping with the DK
model is the extinction threshold of the highest class r = R at
p = 0. Since the initial state only contains individuals of this
type, no other types will ever appear because of the lack of
deleterious mutations. Hence, sites can be either occupied or
empty, just as in the DK model. Transition probabilities correspond to the bond percolation case, from which it follows that
the threshold occurs at πc = a1/R , with a = 0.3552998(9).
Only in the limit R → ∞ would πc → 1, taking a lower value
for any other combination of parameters.
For p 6= 0 and q > 0, no matter how small, all replicative
types are simultaneously present in the infective phase (see

FIG. 1. (Color online) Phase space of the model with R = 10 and
two choices for q: q = 0, where the highest−r classes are sequentially lost as p increases through transitions analogous to the error
threshold of Eigen’s quasispecies model (white lines), and q = 0.01,
where only global extinction of the population is possible. Colors
code for the average replicative ability r̄ when q = 0.01. In the
white domain, infection is cleared in finite time. The top extinction
occurring for q = 0 can be obtained from that of the DK cellular
automaton (curve C). The inset shows r̄ for p = 0.11 and two values of q. Data have been obtained with a system of size L = 104
and averaging over 5 × 103 time steps after a transient of 2 × 104
generations.

Fig. 1). For a fixed value of π, lower r classes get more populated upon increasing p, hence the average replicative ability
decreases. The behavior as π increases at constant p is of a different nature. As π increases, infected cells become sparser.
In the absence of neighbors, the probability that a cell at generation t + 1 is infected by offspring of an individual of class
r at generation t is proportional to (1 − π r ). This quantity penalizes more severely low−r classes as π increases, such that
high−r classes receive a relative advantage and r̄ increases
as πc is approached. At the critical value πc the quasispecies
eventually collapses because propagation is prevented by host
defenses (see the inset of Fig. 1).
There is another relevant difference between the two models. As we have seen, when cells are in excess any host resistance π can be circumvented by increasing R. In contrast,
when viral classes have to compete for susceptible cells, there
is a critical value of π above which this is no longer true. The
reason (illustrated by Fig. 2) is that the average replicative
ability r̄ quickly saturates to a constant value upon increasing R. In other words, when viruses struggle for infecting a
limited number of cells, increasing R does not provide any
additional advantage. In order to show that this effect results
from the limitation in the number of cells available, we have
modified the model to consider a case where four cells are
available for each infection event. This amounts to increasing
the competition between types, such that low−r classes are
at a disadvantage with respect to the previous situation and r̄
increases [10] (see Fig. 2). As a side effect, the critical value
of the cell resistance, πc , at which extinction occurs also saturates to a value below 1 as R → ∞. A runaway co-evolution

FIG. 2. When the number of susceptible cells available is limited,
the average replicative ability r̄ (open symbols, left y−axis) and the
critical value of the resistance to infection πc (solid symbols, right
y−axis) saturate to finite values as R increases. In these curves,
p = 0.2, q = 0.01, and averages over 50 independent realizations
for each value of πc have been performed. Mean-square deviations
are smaller than symbol size.

is therefore excluded in this case: if the host cell is able to increase its defenses beyond πc the infection will not progress.
When the number of susceptible cells is limited, the transitions to extinction belong to the universality class of DP for
any q ≥ 0. For q = 0 we have rigorously proven this for
the extinction of the r = 1 class as well as when p → 0,
by mapping the model to a DK cellular automaton, known to
belong to the DP class [24]. Besides, our model is defined
on a set of local rules, has no special symmetries or disorder, and exhibits a continuous transition to a unique absorbing state (total extinction). Therefore, according to the DP
conjecture it should belong to the DP universality class. An
empirical proof is provided in Fig. 3, where ρ(t) is appropriately rescaled according to the exponents of DP. The transition
point pc is numerically determined as the value of p yielding
the best collapse. Finally, the study of the variation of ρ(t)
at pc with the system size L is characterized by the dynamic
exponent z = 1.580745(10). This analysis has been repeated
for the transition where r = 2 disappears at q = 0, with analogous results.
Formally, the probabilistic model presented here defines a
multicomponent generalization of the DK cellular automaton.
Our model only focuses in a limited region of its parameters in
which an active-inactive transition (q > 0) or several (q = 0)
occur with the criticality of directed percolation. Exploring
in depth the whole phase space of this model in search for
deviations of this behavior is an interesting open question left
out by the present study.
Our model could be modified to better mimic other biological situations. In many plants, different individuals display
variable degrees of resistance to viral infection [25], a case
that could be implemented by introducing a host-dependent
π. This would introduce a form of quenched spatial disorder
that may lead to universality classes other than DP [24]. Anal-

FIG. 3. Data collapse of curves ρ(t) according to the critical exponents known to characterize (1+1) directed percolation, which are
δ = 0.159464(6), νk = 1.733847(6), and z = 1.580745(10) [24].
Parameters in these simulations are R = 2, q = 0.01, π = 0.3. The
system size is L = 104 for the main plot, where the legend shows
the values of p for each curve. For this choice the transition occurs at
pc = 0.16600(3). Legend in the inset gives the values of the system
size L. Data have been averaged over 50 independent realizations
and up to 108 generations for each curve.

ogous changes would be effected by temporally quenched disorder, a situation holding, e.g., when susceptibility to infection
depends on the age of the host. An example of the latter is
systemic acquired resistance, a durable form of immunization
observed in plants [26]. Spatially quenched disorder could
change the properties of viral extinction to those of dynamic
percolation [27]. Current knowledge on the properties of percolation phenomena in a variety of different situations might
inspire unprecedented strategies to stop infection propagation
in those different environments.
The hindrance to the viability of a virus brought about by
a limited avaliability of cells has some empirical support.
While all plant viruses infect the tissue that carries nutrients through the vascular system (phloem), where mobility is
high and susceptible cells are abundant, some viruses (e.g. luteoviruses and some geminiviruses [28]) are not able to infect
leaves, where mobility is limited to cell-to-cell transmission
and fewer uninfected cells are available per infective cycle.
The reverse situation is as yet unknown.
