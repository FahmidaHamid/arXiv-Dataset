ion abundance: two case studies

In comparative proteomics studies, LC-MS/MS data is
generally quantified using one or both of two measures: the
spectral count, derived from the identification of MS/MS
spectra, or some measure of ion abundance derived from
the LC-MS data. Here we contrast the performance of these
measures and show that ion abundance is the more sensitive.
We also examine how the conclusions of a comparative analysis are influenced by the manner in which the LC-MS/MS
data is ‘rolled up’ to the protein level, and show that divergent conclusions obtained using different rollups can be
informative. Our analysis is based on two publicly available reference data sets, BIATECH-54 and CPTAC, which
were developed for the purpose of assessing methods used
in label-free differential proteomic studies. We find that the
use of the ion abundance measure reveals properties of both
data sets not readily apparent using the spectral count.

1. INTRODUCTION
Comparative proteomics studies aim to discern differences in protein content and abundance between case
and control samples. Tandem liquid-chromatography massspectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments are performed routinely in carrying out such studies and may employ labeled
or unlabeled samples. Our focus here will be on the analysis
of data from unlabeled experiments.
Preparatory to an LC-MS/MS experiment, a protein
sample is digested using trypsin or other proteolytic enzyme. In LC-MS, a reverse phase liquid chromatography
(LC) column is typically used to separate the resulting peptide ‘species’ based on their hydrophobicity, and an MS spectrum, or scan, is taken of them periodically as they elute.
The collection of scans from a single experiment may be
viewed as a three-dimensional landscape of peaks located in
elution time (t) and mass/charge (m/z) space. We refer to
the recent reviews [6] and [8] for a more detailed discussion
of LC-MS/MS experimental and analytical procedures.

The peaks associated with a single species form a characteristic group, or ‘feature’, in LC-MS space. An example of such a feature is shown in Figure 1(a). Each peak in
the group collects ions of one or more isotopic forms of the
species. The relative amplitude of the peaks measures the
relative abundance of the isotopic forms. A number of software packages have been developed to detect and quantify
LC-MS features including MapQuant [19], MaxQuant [4],
Sahale [25], Serac [28], SpecArray [20], and SuperHirn [26].
In tandem MS (MS/MS), selected LC-MS peaks are interrogated by a collision-induced dissociation (CID) and a
second MS scan recorded. Figure 1(a) displays the (t, m/z)
locations (shown in red) of four MS/MS scans sampled from
the LC-MS feature. MS/MS spectra are matched against a
protein database to determine the species from which they
likely originated. In the simplest case, the species is one
of the amino acid sequences generated by an in silico digest of the protein database, e.g., by trypsin. The search
space, however, is usually expanded beyond that of the in
silico digest to include, for example, species with missed or
non-tryptic cleavages, and species with altered mass due to
anticipated chemical modifications of specific amino acids.
Algorithms to perform this search are implemented by software packages including MyriMatch [34], Sequest [10], and
X!Tandem [5]. Following identification, each spectrum-tospecies match is assigned an instrument-independent quality score, typically either a PeptideProphet score [17], or a
false discovery rate (FDR) calculated on the basis of hits
against decoy proteins in the database searched [15].
In the analysis of LC-MS/MS data, the relative abundance of species in a sample is generally quantified by either or both of two measures: the spectral count (see, e.g,
[2, 21, 22, 37]), which is the number of MS/MS spectra identified as arising from the species, or some measure of the
species’ ion abundance derived from an analysis of its feature signature in LC-MS space (see, e.g., [1, 14, 19, 28]).
For example, the spectral count associated with the species
giving rise to the feature in Figure 1(a) is four, and one possible measure of the species’ ion abundance is the volume
of the peaks fitted to its feature, as shown in Figure 1(b).
Recently, the ion abundance of MS/MS spectra has been
introduced as one component of an alternative quantitative
measure [12]; we do not consider this measure of abundance
in this work.

We note that although it is the species that is observed
directly in a LC-MS/MS experiment, and for which such experiments yield quantitative data, the goal of comparative
proteomics studies is to identify and quantify the proteins.
In particular, the data available for species must be ‘rolled
up’ to the protein level. To date, no systematic research
has addressed how best to infer protein quantity from the
species quantities [30], although some statistical discussion
on this topic is provided by [3] for ion abundance and [23] for
spectral count. A common approach is to average the quantitative measure used (i.e., spectral count or ion abundance)
for all species belonging to a particular protein and then to
use the result as a surrogate measure for the abundance of
the protein in a statistical test. Other investigations infer
relative protein abundance directly from the abundance of
species, or from the abundance of species data rolled up
to some intermediate level, using a variety of methods. For
methods based on spectral counts, see APEX [22], emPAI
[13], QSpec [2], SASPECT [35, 36] and Spectral Index [11].
For statistical models of protein rollup based on ion abundances, see [3, 16]. The recent review [27] provides additional
perspective.
In this paper we contrast the performance of the spectral count and ion abundance in quantifying LC-MS/MS
data. We also consider the effect of various levels of data
aggregation—from the species level to the protein level—
prior to, or simultaneously with, the analysis of the relative abundance of proteins. We conclude that ion abundance, coupled with an appropriate rollup procedure, is the
more sensitive measure for use in comparative analysis. Our
findings are based on detailed examinations of two publicly available reference data sets, BIATECH-54 [18] and
CPTAC [29], which were developed to assess methods of
protein identification and quantification in LC-MS/MS experiments. The use of the ion abundance measure reveals
characteristics of both the BIATECH-54 and CPTAC data
sets not readily apparent by the use of the spectral count.

2. METHODS
2.1 Quantification
We used Sahale [25] to determine the spectral count and
ion abundance of species identified by X!Tandem in the
BIATECH-54 and CPTAC data. Briefly, Sahale searches
for LC-MS features in the vicinity of the (t, m/z) location
of those species identified by MS/MS satisfying a specified
quality threshold, either a PeptideProphet score or false discovery rate (FDR). The species’ spectral count is the number of MS/MS identifications of that species satisfying the
threshold. The species’ ion abundance is determined by fitting the corresponding feature to the model f ≡ f (t, m),

as a surrogate measure of ion abundance. f (t, m) is the product of a simple Gaussian in the chromatographic (t) coordinate and a series of N Gaussians with Poisson-distributed
peak amplitudes in the m/z (m) coordinate. In Equation (1), A is the amplitude. µ is the coordinate of the peak
of the time Gaussian and σ is its standard deviation. For the
function in m/z, N is the number of isotopic peaks modeled,
ζk = ζ0 +kδ is the m/z location of the kth peak, ζ0 is the coordinate of the first Poisson-distributed peak, k is the peak
number, δ is the inter-peak spacing, λ is the Poisson parameter, and ρ is the standard deviation of the Gaussians.
Sahale fits Equation (1) to data by least squares using the
Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm. Figure 1(b)
shows the fit determined by Sahale to the feature shown in
Figure 1(a).
Sahale returns the spectral count and ion abundance for
every species for which at least one MS/MS identification
exists satisfying the quality threshold specified. Because Sahale quantifies LC-MS features guided by MS/MS identifications, and not all the corresponding ion abundance quantifications are determined successfully, the number of species
quantified by ion abundance is less than or equal to the
number quantified by spectral count.

2.2 Rollup and significance analysis
The data collected in an LC-MS/MS experiment quantifies the species. To determine the relative abundance of proteins, a statistical analysis might use the quantitative data
for species directly, or will first aggregate the species-level
quantitative data to some higher rollup level.
A species as we’ve defined the term is the identity associated with a feature in LC-MS space by a search of a protein database, e.g., by X!Tandem. A species is characterized
by three attributes: its primary amino acid sequence, any
chemical modifications to its amino acids, and its charge
state. The nomenclature DEDTQAM[147.035]PFR+2, for
example, identifies a species with the primary amino acid
sequence DEDTQAMPFR containing an oxidized methionine at position 7 with a net mass of 147.035 Daltons (D) and
carrying a charge of +2 induced by the LC-MS instrument.
A like species with charge +3, DEDTQAM[147.035]PFR+3,
might be identified in the same experiment. Other species
might be identified in the experiment with the same primary
amino acid sequence but without the modification to methionine, i.e., DEDTQAMPFR+2 and DEDTQAMPFR+3.
In general, these species variants, all of which have the same
primary amino acid sequence, will correspond to widelyseparated features in LC-MS space.
The key point is that as a result of biological processes
and the action of the LC-MS instrument, a short segment of

their primary amino acid sequence possibly originated
from a particular protein.

Where it is convenient, we refer to the rollup level by a
single-letter abbreviation: species (s), peptide (p), or protein
(P). Note that we use the term ‘protein’ to refer to both a
rollup level and to the biological entity; the meaning will be
clear from the context.
We assigned to the higher rollup entities - the peptides
and proteins - a spectral count and ion abundance by a
simple sum. For example, we computed the spectral count
(ion abundance) for a particular peptide to be the sum of
the spectral counts (ion abundances) for all species that are
elements of the peptide.
To test for proteins present in differing abundance, we
computed a statistic, τr , that integrates the evidence of difference, w, measured for each of a protein’s K constituent
elements identified at rollup level r,

a protein’s primary amino acid sequence may present itself
as any number of species - and corresponding features - in
an LC-MS/MS experiment.
We define three levels of rollup of LC-MS/MS data.
• Species: The base rollup level.
• Peptide: The collection of all species with the
same primary amino acid sequence. The peptide DEDTQAMPFR, for example, refers to the
species DEDTQAMPFR+2, DEDTQAMPFR+3,
DEDTQAM[147.035]PFR+2, etc.
• Protein: The collection of all species that by virtue of

Note that wk is w for the k’th element of a protein at rollup
level r. τr is simply the mean of the w’s measured for a
protein’s r-level rollup elements.
For the element-level measure of difference, w, we employed a zero-centered and scaled version of the Wilcoxon
test statistic, W , which is the sum of ranks of observations
in the case group in a case-control comparison. W naturally
falls in the range

(n + 1), (n + 2m + 1) ,
[Wmin , Wmax ] =

where n and m are the number of case and control observations, respectively, being compared. In our analysis, we took
the ‘observations’ to correspond to the biological replicates.
We define w as

Thus defined, w ∈ [−1, 1]. Henceforth, for brevity, we refer
to the scaled and re-centered Wilcoxon statistic w simply as
the Wilcoxon. As a consequence of the definition of w, τr ,
defined in Equation (2), falls in the range [−1, 1] independently of K. Note that at the protein level of rollup, K = 1
and τP = w, where w is the Wilcoxon computed for the
protein at the protein level of rollup.
We computed τr using both the spectral count and ion
abundance measures for all elements at the species, peptide
and protein rollup levels. To derive p-values, we computed a
null distribution for τr by repeatedly permuting the labels of
the case and control samples (1500x in both the BIATECH54 and CPTAC studies).
Our aim is to contrast quantification by spectral count
and ion abundance as transparently as possible. This demands that the statistical summaries we employ must be

comparable and based on the same concepts. The statistic
τr is simply the average of Wilcoxon test statistics for a protein’s constituent elements at a given rollup level, computed
in the same way at each level using the spectral count or the
ion abundance.

3. CASE STUDIES
3.1 BIATECH-54
We describe first our analysis of the LC-MS/MS data set
measuring the two reference samples, Mix 1 and Mix 2, of
the BIATECH-54 set (Kolker et al. [18]). The BIATECH-54
mixtures were developed to assess methods of protein identification and quantification in LC-MS/MS experiments. Mix
1 and Mix 2 combine 54 proteins at different concentrations;
their exact compositions are documented in Table 1 of [18]
and represented graphically in Figure 2. To mimic biological
replicates, Kolker et al. prepared six (6) replicate samples
of Mix1 and Mix 2 and digested each independently with
trypsin. The twelve (12) samples were then each subject to
LC-MS/MS analysis twice; these are the technical replicates.
The BIATECH-54 data set was obtained from the authors as a collection of 24 files in .mzXML format [18]. In
this collection, files corresponding to the Mix 1 samples are
designated ’A’ and Mix 2 samples designated ’B’.

zero mg was included in either sample are shown on the axes.
We searched the MS/MS spectra of the data set using
X!Tandem [5] against a protein database containing the primary amino acid sequences of the proteins of yeast along
with those of the BIATECH-54 and potential contaminating
proteins. To support estimation of the false discovery rate,
decoy protein sequences, constructed by reversing each of
the target protein sequences, were appended to this database
[9]. To compensate for drift in the calibration of the LTQ-FT

instrument used to collect these data, the precursor matching tolerance was set to an asymmetric window [-10 ppm,
+40 ppm]. The search was performed to allow potential
oxidation of methionines (∆mass = 15.9949D). Up to two
missed tryptic cleavages were permitted.
We conducted separate searches allowing for only fullytryptic species and for semi-tryptic species. As implemented
by X!Tandem, the latter are species constrained to have a
tryptic terminus on at least one end. We chose to analyze
the results obtained from both the fully- and semi-tryptic
searches because it is not uncommon in practice to do one
or the other. Though usually not stated explicitly, the rationale for using a semi-tryptic search is that such species
are likely to be present in samples, e.g., due to the activity of contaminating proteolytic enzymes, and ignoring such
species would leave potentially useful quantitative data ‘on
the table’.
The BIATECH-54 data was quantified by spectral count
and ion abundance using Sahale [25]. The FDR threshold
parameter set for Sahale was selected to be 0.001 (see Section 2.1). Species not observed or quantified in at least three
(3 of 12) of the Mix 1 samples or three (3 of 12) of the Mix
2 samples were filtered out, as were uninformative species
in the ion abundance data for which the ion abundances are
effectively zero or are missing for all samples. The spectral
counts and ion abundances for the species remaining were
then rolled up to the peptide and protein levels (see Section 2.2). The resulting six data sets - the spectral counts
and ion abundances across the three rollup levels - were then
normalized by sample to make the data comparable across
samples. The spectral counts were normalized by the total spectral count, and ion abundances by the median ion
abundance.
As already described, the BIATECH-54 data set includes
two technical replicate observations of each of the 12 biological samples measured. The technical replicates were ‘averaged’ to obtain a value for the spectral count and ion
abundance for the corresponding biological replicate. The
average was computed so that if one of the technical observations was found to be missing, the quantity found for the
other was assigned as that for the biological replicate.
Following these preparatory steps, we tested the species,
peptide and protein level entities in Mix 1 and Mix 2 for
evidence of difference using the statistic τr (Equation (2)).
Figure 3, displays ROC curves characterizing the performance of τr in correctly characterizing the relative abundance of proteins in the BIATECH-54 samples. Figure 3(a)
shows ROC curves determined by analysis of the data
searched for fully-tryptic species; Figure 3(b) shows the
same results for data searched allowing for semi-tryptic
species. The data used to produce both figures was quantified by Sahale with the FDR threshold parameter set to
0.001; qualitatively similar results were obtained with the
FDR level set to 0.01 or 0.02 (not shown). The ROC analysis was performed using the ROCR package [32].

level. The ion abundance at the protein level, however, yields
an AUC appreciably less than that at the species and peptide levels. By contrast, the spectral count yields an AUC
that is nearly constant across rollup levels.
Using the semi-tryptic data, the relative performance of
the spectral count and ion abundance is nearly reversed
(Figure 3(b)). Strikingly, the performance of ion abundance
at the species and peptide rollup levels is significantly lower
than that obtained using the fully-tryptic data whereas the

In a study conducted by the Clinical Proteomic Technologies for Cancer (CPTAC) consortium, Paulovich et al.
[29] introduced a reference data set measuring new performance standards for benchmarking of LC-MS/MS platforms
and data analysis methods. These new standards are based
on the yeast proteome and the UPS1 (Universal Proteomcs
Standard Set 1) collection of 48 human source or human
sequence recombinant proteins [31]. The CPTAC reference
samples and data set therefore provide a more complex and
challenging benchmark for LC-MS/MS analysis than does
BIATECH-54.

Fraction of ion abundance contributed by strictly semi−tryptic species

sult of a complex interaction of two factors: the number of
species that contribute to the quantification of each peptide;
and the relative contribution made by the additional strictly
semi-tryptic species observed in the Mix 1 samples to the
quantification of each peptide.
Using a semi-tryptic search strategy and the ion abundance measure, we’ve found that the BIATECH-54 samples
Mix 1 and Mix 2 differ markedly in their content of strictly
semi-tryptic species (Figure 4(a)). We detected this anomaly
at the species and peptide levels of rollup, but not at the
protein level (Figure 3(b)), using our Wilcoxon rank-sumbased test. The same analysis carried out using the spectral
count measure gave no hint of this unanticipated finding.
Our analysis suggests not only that the ion abundance is a
more sensitive measure of quantification than is the spectral count, but that analysis of LC-MS/MS data at different
levels of rollup can be informative.

We analzyed a subset of the data collected for the CPTAC
study, comparing the trypsin-digested yeast protein lysate
samples, designated QC2, with the UPS1 spike-in samples,
designated A, B, C, D and E. The composition of these
samples is summarized in Table 1, which is excerpted from
Section C of [29, Supplementary Information]. The four laboratories participating in the study each collected three technical replicate observations of the QC2, A, B, C, D and E
samples for a total of twelve (12) observations of each.

It is more difficult to provide a simple explanation for against the same protein database used by the CPTAC authe poor performance seen in Figure 3(b) for the interme- thors, which includes both target and decoy (reversed) prodiate, peptide level of rollup.

[-10 ppm, +10 ppm]. The search was performed to allow for
potential oxidation of methionines (∆m = 15.9949D) and
carbamidomethylation of cysteines (∆m = 57.0215D). Up
to two missed tryptic cleavages were permitted. The search
was conducted allowing for only fully-tryptic species.
The CPTAC data was quantified by spectral count and
ion abundance using Sahale executed with the FDR threshold parameter set to 0.001. Species not observed or quantified in at least three (3 of 12) of the A, B, C, D or E
samples or three (3 of 12) of the QC2 samples were filtered
out, as were uninformative species in the ion abundance data
for which the ion abundances were effectively zero or were
missing for all samples. The data was then rolled up. The
spectral counts in each sample were normalized by the total
spectral count, and the ion abundances by the median ion
abundance.
Following these preparatory steps, we searched for proteins present in differing abundance in the QC2 and A, B,
C, D or E samples using the statistic τr (Equation (2)) computed at the species, peptide and protein rollup levels. Following the methodology used by Paulovich et al. [29] in the

analysis leading to their Table III, we treated the 12 observations of each sample type as biological replicates. Note that
because we tested on the rank computed for the QC2 samples, species, peptide or protein elements less abundant in
the A-E samples than in QC2 have w > 0. This observation
will be important in the following.

To correct for the effects of multiple hypothesis testing,

package qvalue (see [33]). The numbers of yeast and UPS1
proteins found to be present in greater and lesser abundance
in samples A-E relative to QC2 at FDR level 0.05 are shown
in Table 2.
Table 2 shows that the performance of the spectral count
is somewhat better than ion abundance in correctly characterizing the abundance of the UPS1 proteins in the case
samples across rollup levels, particularly at the lower levels
of spike-in. However, what stands out in Table 2 is the large
number of yeast proteins found to have different abundance
in the E and QC2 samples. The number of these apparent
false positives is particularly high in the results computed
using ion abundance. We sought to understand the origin of
these ’false positives’, initially suspecting some error in the
method by which features were quantified by ion abundance.

the yeast proteins only of the A, C and E samples. These pvalues were computed on the basis of τs , that is, on the basis

for p-values computed using either the spectral count or ion

The results presented in Table 2 and Figure 5 were computed on the basis of τs . Figure 6 shows the distribution of
τs for the yeast proteins only in the A, C and E samples.
Note that the mass of the τs distributions, computed using either the spectral count or ion abundance, trend to the
right as the concentration of UPS1 proteins is increased.
The simple structure of τs as an average of Wilcoxons
allowed us to quickly diagnose the origin of this trend: the
distribution of w for yeast species must mirror that of τs for
yeast proteins in the A, C and E samples.
To determine the origin of the positive shift for w, we
stratified w by two factors, the total ion abundance of the
yeast species, and the number of missing observations of the
yeast species, both in the QC2 samples. The positive trend
of w does not appear to correlate with total ion abundance
(Figure 7(a)). The distribution of w for few and many missing observations both trend positive as the UPS1 protein
concentration increases, but the Wilcoxons for yeast species
with many missing observations in QC2 appear to be influenced less (Figure 7(b)). We conclude, however, that neither
factor explains the shift of w.
The positive shift in the distribution of w for the yeast
species, and τs for the yeast proteins, obviously correlates
with the increasing concentration of the UPS1 proteins.
Consequently, we speculated that the trend is the result of

whose feature overlaps in time with a UPS1 feature. This
is consistent with our hypothesis that ion competition is responsible for the positive shift in the distribution of w for
the yeast species and, consequently, the positive shift in the
distribution of τs for the yeast proteins as well.
The Wilcoxons for yeast species in the positive cohort
are centered at zero in sample A and shift slowly to more
positive values as the UPS1 spike-in level increases. We hypothesized that this slow rightward shift is a result of ion
competition outside the 2σ extent we assumed in assigning
yeast species to the zero cohort.

To test this, we plotted (Figure 10) the distribution of
the interference distance for yeast species of the positive
cohort only. Especially in sample E, the bulk of yeast features corresponding to species in the positive cohort are in
close proximity to a UPS1 feature. This provides additional
evidence that ion competition is responsible for the rightward shift of w seen in Figure 9. Moreover, among the yeast
species in the positive cohort, their Wilcoxons and interference distances are significantly negatively correlated, based
on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ = −0.14, and
the p-value for H0 : ρ = 0 is < 10−5 ).
The yeast species in the missing cohort require comment.
As is evident by examining the definition of the interference
distance di in Equation (4), in most cases that di was not
computed, the yeast species i will not have been observed
in the case samples, one of A-E. This implies that i was
observed only in the QC2 samples. Consequently, for yeast

species in the missing cohort, the corresponding Wilcoxons
will all be positive, i.e., these species will behave very much
like the yeast species in the zero cohort with respect to their
contribution to τs .
Note that in Table 3, excepting sample D, the number of
missing yeast species increases monotonically with the increasing level of spike-in. We interpret this to mean that as
additional UPS1 protein is introduced, not only is the ion
abundance of yeast features reduced by competition with
UPS1 features, but that an increasing number of yeast features are out-competed entirely, i.e., they are not observed,
or not successfully quantified for their ion abundance.

As we saw with the BIATECH-54 data, we are able to
detect characteristics of the CPTAC data set using the ion
abundance only hinted at using the spectral count. In particular, we find that the ‘false positive’ detections of yeast
proteins ⇓ in sample E (Table 2) are in fact not false. They
reflect a true difference in sample E, apparently an artifact
of ion competition between the yeast and UPS1 features in
the LC-MS experiment. This competition increases as the
level of spike-in of UPS1 protein increases from A to E.

4. DISCUSSION
The results of an LC-MS/MS proteomics study depend on
a complex set of choices which ultimately define the ‘data’
that is analyzed. Here we presented a multi-faceted examination of two benchmarking studies, BIATECH-54 and CPTAC, and showed how various such choices affect their analysis and interpretation. Most significantly, our analysis using
the ion abundance to quantify the data exposed properties
of these data sets not readily apparent from the results of
a parallel analysis using the spectral count. We also showed
that the level to which data is ‘rolled up’ prior to analysis
may significantly affect the results and that the differences
so revealed can be informative. Additionally, we reported
on how the parameters used to execute the MS/MS search
can affect the results. To accomplish our analysis, we introduced the straightforward statistic τr (Equation (2)) so as
to advance our goal of contrasting transparently the influence of quantification by spectral count and ion abundance
at different levels of data rollup.
Ion abundance is more sensitive than spectral count in
detecting differences between the Mix 1 and Mix 2 samples

of the BIATECH-54 set. Using data obtained from a search
allowing only for fully-tryptic species, ion abundance performs as well or better at all levels of rollup; the greatest
sensitivity is seen at the lower levels of rollup (Figure 3(a)).
Using data obtained by allowing for semi-tryptic species,
the ion-abundance based τr detects an apparent artifact of
the manner in which the BIATECH-54 samples were prepared, something not detected when τr is computed using
the spectral count. This artifact was found to arise from
the existence of approximately 10-15% more strictly semitryptic species in Mix 1 than in Mix 2 (Figure 4(a)).
The different results found using the data searched for
fully-tryptic and semi-tryptic species (Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b)) highlights the influence of one choice made by
researchers in analyzing LC-MS/MS data. The experimental design of the BIATECH-54 study implicitly assumes
that proteins undergo full tryptic digestion. Constraining
the MS/MS search strategy to allow for only fully-tryptic
species is therefore a natural choice. Using the less constrained semi-typtic search may seem advantageous since
one may identify additional species. However, the advantages of a less-constrained search come not from finding
additional high-quality hits, but from a better estimation
of the null, or noise, distribution that is needed to define
positive hits [7]. Once the search is complete, strictly semitryptic hits should be filtered out [9].
In the CPTAC study, we detected evidence of increasing ion competition as the amount of UPS1 spike-in protein
increases. This is weakly detectable when τr is computed

using the spectral count but is obvious when the ion abundance is used; see Table 2 and the companion perspectives
in Figures 5 and 6. The sample-dependent trends seen in
these figures reveals that the abundance of yeast proteins
decreases as a function of increasing UPS1 spike-in. Conceivably, this was an artifact of a quantification method that
treated high/low abundance or missing features differently.
However, by stratifying the Wilcoxon w on low-versus-high
total ion abundance and on few-versus-many missing observations of yeast species in QC2 (Figure 7), we diagnosed
that this is not the case. The existence of ion competition in
the CPTAC data was confirmed by stratifying the Wilcoxon
statistics for yeast species on the basis of their interference
distance (see Figures 9 and 10).
Our findings for the CPTAC data raises the question as
to whether the spike-in experimental design is appropriate
for the construction of a benchmark case-control study. The
very introduction of a spike-in appears to bias the data by
ion competition. Possibly, the bias we detect is a consequence of ‘too much’ UPS1 protein having been introduced,
in the E sample in particular. However, a simple calculation
confirms that the average mass of yeast protein per µl of
E sample exceeds that for an average UPS1 protein by approximately 20% (1.1×10−11 grams per UPS1 protein versus
1.33 × 10−11 grams per yeast protein, assuming ∼4,500 expressed yeast proteins [29]). This suggests that one must be
cautious in interpreting the results obtained from a labelfree LC-MS/MS experiment, as an over-expressed collection
of proteins may interfere with the ion signal measured for
other classes.
Our findings differ somewhat from those of Zybailov et
al. [38] who conclude that the spectral count is more reliable than ion abundance (as summarized by the RelEx
method of MacCoss et al. [24]). Similarly, Old et al. [28]
conclude that the spectral count is more sensitive than ion
abundance (as summarized by Serac) in detecting differentially expressed proteins. On the other hand, that study also
observes that the ion abundance yields more accurate estimates of protein ratios than does the spectral count and
so no definitive conclusion was drawn. We note that Old
et al. use one statistic for spectral count data and another
statistic for ion abundance data and so it is difficult to compare their results to ours. Indeed, comparison between spectral count and ion abundance is complicated by the myriad
ways in which MS and MS/MS data are quantified and summarized statistically. This is an important point: neither of
the terms “spectral count” nor “ion abundance” refers to a
well-defined quantification method but rather to a general
approach used to define quantities that enter into the statistical analysis. Not only are there many ways to define these
quantities but there are also many ways to define the statistics that ultimately summarize protein comparisons, as seen
in our discussion of peptide “rollup”.
In our analyses, we have attempted to ensure that any
differences observed when using spectral count versus ion

abundance for quantification are not due to non-comparable
aspects of the analysis. Our use of the Wilcoxon in defining
τr for both measures of quantification at each level of rollup
allows for a statistically even-handed comparison. Additionally, the MS/MS-directed approach we employed to quantify ion abundance ensures the fairness of the comparison
we make between the spectral count and ion abundance as
this approach quantifies the same set of CIDs in each case.
We note in passing that we investigated a variant of τr
computed using the t-statistic. We found the performance
of this variant is less attractive than that based on the
Wilcoxon. This is a consequence of the small sample size
of the case studies and the parametric assumptions underlying the use of the t-statistic.
Finally, there are a variety of reasons to favor ion abundance for quantification. The statistical models for protein
rollup by Clough et al. [3], for example, are implicitly based
on ion abundances. Also, as noted by Podwojski et al. [30]
and Lundgren et al. [23], spectral counts may be dominated
by a few proteins having a large number of counts, and the
spectral count breaks down as a statistical quantity when
very few counts are observed. Although the estimated ion
abundance of an identified species is subject to low signal
and the stochastic nature of the CID sampling, it has the
potential to more robustly quantify seldom-seen species.
