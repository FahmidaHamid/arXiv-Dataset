We study the thermodynamics and kinetics of an RNA toehold-mediated strand displacement
reaction with a recently developed coarse-grained model of RNA. Strand displacement, during which
a single strand displaces a different strand previously bound to a complementary substrate strand,
is an essential mechanism in active nucleic acid nanotechnology and has also been hypothesized to
occur in vivo. We study the rate of displacement reactions as a function of the length of the toehold
and temperature and make two experimentally testable predictions: that the displacement is faster
if the toehold is placed at the 5′ end of the substrate and that the displacement slows down with
increasing temperature for longer toeholds.
INTRODUCTION

The emerging field of RNA nanotechnology aims to
construct nanoscale structures and devices by using RNA
strands [1, 2]. It is closely related to the more established and rapidly developing field of DNA nanotechnology, which exploits the specificity of Watson-Crick base
pairing to construct impressive artificial nanoscale structures and active devices [3–10]. While RNA and DNA are
similar molecules, composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone to which an alphabet of four different nucleobases
can attach, there are some differences. For example in
DNA the sugar is deoxyribose and the four bases are (A,
C, G, T) whereas in RNA the sugar is ribose, and the
base T is replaced by U. Like DNA, RNA can form two
kinds of Watson-Crick base pairs (AU or GC), but it has
a higher propensity for other kinds of bonding, including the wobble base pair (GU) as well as numerous other
tertiary structure interactions.
In the cell, both molecules can store information,
but whereas isolated DNA is primarily found in a Bhelical double-stranded state, RNA is more versatile.
It can fold from single-stranded states into complex
three-dimensional structures that contain A-form helical double-stranded segments as well as loops, bulges
and junctions. This increased structural repertoire facilitates biological functionality, so that RNA molecules
can perform multiple additional roles, including catalysis, genetic regulation, structural support, and templating for molecular recognition and DNA synthesis [11–13].
Since it can accomplish both storage of genetic material
(like DNA) as well as metabolism (like proteins), it has
been postulated that early life was based on RNA before
DNA-based organisms appeared (the “RNA world” hypothesis [14]). On the one hand, this versatility makes
the prospect of using RNA nanotechnology very appealing, especially in biomedical applications. On the other
hand, it also makes predicting the three-dimensional
structure significantly more challenging [1, 15, 16] than
for DNA. For example, rather than designing de novo

sequences that would fold into a particular functional
three-dimensional structure, RNA nanotechnology often
relies on functional motifs from known biologically occurring structures [17].
In this paper we study the RNA equivalent of toeholdmediated strand displacement, a relatively simple dynamic reaction that has been a key component in many
active devices in DNA nanotechnology. During strand
displacement, a single-stranded “invading” strand replaces an “incumbent” strand that was bound in a duplex
with a “substrate” strand. Both the invading and incumbent strand are complementary to the substrate strand,
but the incumbent strand is a few bases shorter. When
bound to the incumbent strand, the substrate strand
hence has a short single-stranded overhanging region (a
“toehold”) to which in invading strand can bind.
Systems based on DNA strand-displacement reactions
have been shown to be able to perform computation [18–
20] and are the basis of autonomous DNA motors [21, 22].
Strand-displacement reactions also have a great potential for use in RNA nanotechnology applications. For
instance, a series of different reactions that involve several RNA strand-displacement steps were developed in
Ref. 23. The strand displacement reaction is triggered
by the presence of an mRNA strand with a particular
sequence and the final product is an siRNA complex
[23]. One promising application in vivo is the conditional
knockout of a gene by an RNA silencing mechanism in
the presence of mRNA created by a transcription of the
triggering gene. It was recently shown in vitro that a
cascade of RNA strand displacement reactions can be
used for the detection of a single-stranded RNA with a
particular sequence that triggers the reaction [24]. Furthermore, RNA switches have been recently introduced
for use in synthetic gene circuits, where the presence of a
specific trigger RNA strand opens an RNA hairpin via a
stand-displacement reaction. The hairpin loop contains
a ribosome binding region that becomes accessible for
transcription after the successful completion of the displacement. The functionality of RNA switches has been
demonstrated in vivo as well as for diagnostics in vitro

2
[25, 26].
There is currently substantial evidence that there are
multiple regions of the genome that are transcribed into
RNA molecules which are not further involved in protein production, but are themselves the final product.
Thousands of these “non-coding RNAs” (ncRNA) have
been identified and their function is a very active field of
research [27–29]. Some of the ncRNA interactions also
involve RNA-RNA contacts and the creation of RNA
double-stranded sections [30, 31]. It is hence plausible that RNA strand displacement might be involved in
ncRNA interactions. For instance, it was hypothesized in
Ref. 32 that RNA strand displacement reactions can occur in vivo for example in ribozyme-product complexes
and it was shown in vitro that a single-stranded RNA
can displace the cleaved strand which was bound to a
ribozyme [32]. More generally, the biological versatility
of RNA makes it a prime candidate for many different in
vivo applications of nanotechnology [1, 17, 33].

MODEL AND METHODS
A coarse-grained model of RNA

We give a brief description of the oxRNA model here,
while the details of the structural, mechanical and thermodynamical properties of the model are provided in
Ref. 34.
OxRNA represents each nucleotide as a single rigid
body with multiple interaction sites. The rigid bodies interact with effective anisotropic interactions that
are designed to capture the overall thermodynamic and
structural consequence of the base-pairing, stacking and
backbone interactions, as schematically shown in Fig. 1.

In this work we apply a recently developed coarsegrained model of RNA, oxRNA [34], to study the biophysics of toehold-mediated RNA strand displacement
reactions. OxRNA’s development followed the coarsegraining approach used in a previously developed coarsegrained model of DNA, oxDNA [35–38], which was shown
to accurately reproduce the kinetics and thermodynamics
of DNA strand displacement [39], including phenomena
such as the effect of mismatches on displacement rates
[40].
While the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA strand
displacement has been previously carefully studied both
by experiments and by simulations [39, 41], no systematic
study is available for RNA. However, if the RNA strand
displacement-based devices are to realize their full potential, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms is
necessary. While one might expect the general features
of the reaction to be similar that for DNA, we will also
demonstrate interesting differences.
This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the
RNA model and the simulation methods in the next section. We then study the free-energy profile of the reaction, the rates of displacement as a function of the length
and the placement (at either the 3′ or 5′ end) of the toehold, and the effect of temperature on the rates. We
find that the reaction rate is increased by six orders of
magnitude when the toehold length increases from 1 to
6 bases at 37 ◦ C. In contrast to DNA behavior, we find
a noticeable difference in the displacement rate depending on whether the toehold is placed at the 3′ or 5′ end,
with the 5′ being faster. Finally, we observe that the
rate of displacement decreases with increasing temperature for a three-base toehold, but by less than expected
from simply the decrease in stability of the toehold.

where the first sum runs over all pairs of nucleotides
which are nearest neighbors on the same strand and the
second sum runs over all other pairs.
The backbone interaction, Vbackbone , is an isotropic
FENE (finitely-extensible nonlinear elastic) potential
and depends only on the distance between the backbone
sites of the two adjacent nucleotides. This potential is
used to mimic the covalent bonds in the RNA backbone that constrain the intramolecular distance between
neighboring nucleotides. The nucleotides also have
re′
pulsive excluded-volume interactions Vexc and Vexc that
depend on the distance between their interaction sites,
namely the backbone-backbone, stacking-stacking and
stacking-backbone distances. The excluded-volume interactions ensure that strands cannot overlap, or pass
through each other in a dynamical simulation.
The duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonding (VH.B. ),
stacking (Vstack ) and cross-stacking (Vcross st. ) interactions. These potentials are highly anisotropic and depend
on the distance between the relevant interaction sites as
well as the mutual orientations of the nucleotides.
The hydrogen-bonding term VH.B. is designed to capture the duplex-stabilizing interactions between WatsonCrick and wobble base pairs. The stacking interaction
Vstack mimics the favorable interaction between adjacent
bases, which results from a combination of hydrophobic,
electrostatic and dispersion effects.
The cross-stacking potential, Vcross st. , is designed to
capture the interactions between diagonally opposite
bases in a duplex and has its minimum when the distance
and mutual orientation between nucleotides corresponds
to that for a nucleotide and the 3′ neighbor of the directly
opposite nucleotide in an A-form helix. This interaction
has been parametrized to capture the stabilization of an
RNA duplex by a 3′ overhang [42]. OxRNA does not include any interaction with the 5′ neighbor of the directly

opposite nucleotide, as 5′ overhangs are significantly less
stabilizing than 3′ overhangs [42].
The coaxial stacking potential Vcoaxial st. represents
the stacking interaction between nucleotides that are not
nearest neighbors on the same strand.
The model currently does not include explicit electrostatic interactions. It was parametrized to reproduce
RNA behavior at high (1 M) salt concentrations where
the long-range interactions between phosphate charges
on the backbone are screened. The remaining short-range
electrostatics repulsion interactions are incorporated into
the excluded volume potentials.
The interactions in the model were parametrized to reproduce the melting temperatures of hairpins and short
oligomers as predicted by the nearest-neighbor model
of RNA thermodynamics [42, 43] that is the basis of
most RNA secondary structure prediction tools [44–
46]. Two parametrizations of oxRNA are available, the
“sequence-averaged” and the “sequence-dependent” version. In the sequence-dependent parametrization, the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions have different
strengths depending on the types of the interacting bases.
The sequence-averaged interaction strengths do not distinguish between the different base types, and in particular the interaction strengths of the hydrogen-bonding
potentials are the same for Watson-Crick base pairs (AU
and CG) and zero otherwise. The sequence-averaged interaction strengths were fitted to reproduce the thermodynamics of an averaged nearest-neighbor model, where
the respective free-energy contributions were averaged
over all possible base-pair steps with Watson-Crick complementary base pairs.
In this work, we use the sequence-averaged
parametrization, as we aim to study the displacement
process for different toehold lengths and temperatures
without the complications of sequence-specific effects.
Our results will be comparable to experiments where
“average” sequences are used, i.e. sequences with similar stability as the ones obtained from the averaged
nearest-neighbor model for a given sequence length.

The thermodynamics of the strand-displacement process is probed using the virtual move Mote Carlo
(VMMC) algorithm (specifically the variant described in
the Appendix of Ref. 47) combined with umbrella sampling to help the system overcome free-energy barriers
[48]. The chosen order parameters were the number of
bonds between the invader and the substrate strand and
bonds between the incumbent strand and the substrate.
The weights assigned to the respective states were chosen by experience and then adapted by hand to ensure
an efficient sampling.
We use the forward flux sampling (FFS) method [49]
to estimate the rate of the strand displacement reaction. The FFS technique facilitates simulation of transition pathways by splitting up the rare transition event
into multiple stages which are sampled separately. We
previously used FFS simulations with the coarse-grained
model of DNA, oxDNA, to study the kinetics of DNA
strand displacement [39] and hybridization [50, 51]. In
this work, we use Direct FFS (described in detail in the
Supplementary Material of Ref. 50). The FFS simulations are run after an initial equilibration of 105 steps.
The initial flux is measured through the interface at
which the minimum distance between the complementary bases of the invading strand and the substrate strand
is smaller than 0.84 Å. We then measured the probability of successfully crossing successive interfaces that were
defined by the number of the formed bonds between the
invading strand and the substrate (see Supplementary
Material for details).
In our simulations, we define a base pair as being
formed if the hydrogen-bonding energy (VH.B. in Eq. 1)
between the two bases is more negative than −1.0 kB T
for T = 300 K, which corresponds to about 18% of typical hydrogen-bonding energies in the oxRNA model. We
do not only allow any misbonds, i.e. only the designed
‘correct’ base pairs between the invading strand and the
substrate (and the incumbent strand and the substrate)
can form.
The molecular dynamics simulations for the FFS were
carried out with an Andersen-like thermostat (described
in the Appendix of Ref. 52). All simulations are carried out with a simulation box size that corresponds to
an equal strand concentration of 65.3 µM for the invading strand and substrate. Even though nucleic acid nanotechnology experiments are usually done at lower strand
concentrations (∼ nM or low µM), we chose a higher concentration for our simulations in order not to spend too
much time simply simulating the diffusion prior to the
encounter and reaction of the strands. Such an approach
allows us to efficiently extract the relative second-order
rate constants [39, 50].
The simulation step δt was chosen to be 0.005 in
simulation time units, corresponding to 1.53 × 10−14 s.
We further used a high translational diffusion constant
for an RNA nucleotide in our simulations, D = 5.8 ×

10−7 m2 s−1 , which corresponds to a diffusion constant of
2.1 × 10−8 m2 s−1 for a 14-mer, larger than the experimentally measured Dexp = 0.92 × 10−10 m2 s−1 [53]. We
intentionally use a higher diffusion constant in order to
speed up the diffusion of the strands in our simulations.
Again, as the motion of strands is still diffusive over appreciable timescales, this should speed up the simulation
without altering the basic physics of the reactions. The
rotational diffusion coefficient was set to Drot = 3D and
each nucleotide was treated as a rigid body with a diagonal inertia tensor.
One needs to be cautious in interpreting time units
in coarse-grained simulations. For instance, time scales
of different processes might scale with different factors
[54]. Furthermore, we use an artificially high diffusion
constant. Therefore, rather than trying to map our simulation results onto experimental rates, our emphasis
is on computing the relative rates of similar processes
(e.g. strand displacement with different lengths for the
toehold) which can then be compared with experimental
data, should they become available.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The different stages of the reaction are introduced in
Fig. 2 as represented by the oxRNA model. We note
that the respective stages of the reaction are reversible,
and it is possible for the invading strand to detach before
successfully completing the displacement.
The strand-displacement reaction in DNA has been

studied in detail both experimentally [10, 41] as well as
theoretically with the help of a simplified 1-D model,
models based on secondary structure as well as a previously developed coarse-grained model of DNA, oxDNA
[10, 39, 41].
In Ref. 41, the rate of the toehold-mediated strand displacement was measured as a function of the length of the
toehold. For an average strength toehold (i.e. a sequence
with roughly the same number of AT and GC bonds) it
was found that the rate of the reaction increases exponentially with the length of the toehold until it saturates
for a toehold of about six bases, where the rate is about
6.5 orders of magnitude faster than for a system with no
toehold. A very similar speed-up was also observed in
coarse-grained simulations with oxDNA [39].
We are confident that our oxRNA model is able to
provide insight into the RNA strand displacement reaction, as it adopts a very similar coarse-graining approach
to that developed for oxDNA, which was shown to sufficiently describe the necessary biophysical properties of
DNA to capture both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects
of the strand displacement reaction [39].
In the rest of this work, we will study the strand displacement reaction with toeholds of length ranging from
1 to 6, placed at either end of the substrate. The substrate has 10 base pairs with the incumbent strand. We
use the oxRNA model to obtain a free-energy profile for
the strand-displacement reaction, and the rates of the
RNA displacement as a function of toehold length, position (3′ or 5′ ) and temperature.

Free-energy profile

We measure the free-energy profile of the toeholdmediated strand displacement reaction at 37 ◦ C by sampling the states of a system consisting of a 18-nucleotide
substrate strand with two 4-nucleotide toeholds at the
3′ and 5′ ends. Two 14-nucleotide strands (that displace
each other) are attached to the substrate, one at each
toehold. The system is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). We use
VMMC (combined with umbrella sampling) to sample
the free-energy landscape as a function of number of the
bonds between each strand and the substrate. We plot
the free energy in Fig. 3(b) as a function of the number
of bonds between the invading strand and the substrate,
separately for each invading strand. The VMMC algorithm was run for approximately 5 × 1011 cluster move
attempts. The errors for each point, estimated as the
maximum difference from the mean from 3 independent
simulation sets, is at most 0.06 kB T , i.e. not larger than
the size of the points in Fig. 3(b). In the simulation,
we only allowed base pairing between the substrate and
its complementary bases on the other two strands. We
required that the strands always have at least one bond
with the substrate to prevent dissociation.
The free energy decreases as more bonds are formed between the invading strand and the toehold and reaches its

minimum when the invading strand is fully bound to the
toehold. There is a free-energy barrier associated with
the initiation of the displacement (i.e. branch migration,
where the invading strand gains additional bonds with
the substrate at the expense of the incumbent strand)
of about 1.6 kB T (corresponding to about 1 kcal/mol),
which saturates after about 4 bases have been displaced.
A similar barrier was observed for DNA displacement
[39, 55] and it arises from the fact that at the branch
point (the point on the substrate where the invading and
incumbent strands meet) the strands are in close proximity and the single-stranded overhangs of the invading
and incumbent strands cannot overlap because of the excluded volume interactions. The two strands can move
away from each other, but this requires the stacking interactions at the junction to be broken, as illustrated in

Fig. 3(a). Hence, there is a free-energy penalty associated with taking the first steps of branch migration, even
though the total number of base pairs between the substrate and the invading and incumbent strands remains
the same throughout the process.
When the invading strand is bound to the toehold, it
will eventually either initiate branch migration or fall off.
We note that binding to the 5′ toehold is more favorable
than binding to the 3′ toehold, as the invading strand
attached at the 5′ end has an additional cross-stacking
interaction. Due to the A-form helical structure, the
3′ overhang cross-stacking interaction is stronger than
the 5′ overhang, as the distance towards the 3′ overhang is smaller, hence allowing for a stronger interaction.
The average extra stabilization at 37 ◦ C in the nearestneighbor model of RNA thermodynamics [42] is about
−0.4 kB T for a 5′ overhang and −1.3 kB T for a 3′ overhang.
The cross-stacking interaction in the oxRNA model
was parametrized to reproduce the average melting temperatures of short RNA duplexes with extra unpaired
overhangs at the 3′ ends of the strand. The model does
not include any stacking interaction with the 5′ overhang,
as it is significantly weaker than for the 3′ overhang.
The additional stabilization provided by the crossstacking between the substrate and the invading strand
attached to the 5′ toehold (Fig. 4(a)) is about −1.7 kB T
in our model at 37 ◦ C. Hence, the probability of falling
off once the invading strand is attached is lower for an
invading strand at a 5′ toehold than at a 3′ toehold.
While Fig. 3 provides information about the freeenergy landscape of the strand displacement reaction as
a function of the number of bonds between the invading
strand and the substrate strand, it does not give us the
rate of the reaction. Even though some of the neighboring states during the branch migration procedure have
almost no difference in free energy, the transition between them is a complicated process that requires the
loss of a base-pair between the incumbent strand and
the substrate and the creation of the base-pair between
the invading strand and a substrate.
In a previous paper [39], this complex process was directly simulated for DNA with oxDNA. Furthermore, the
transition rates between adjacent states were described
with a simplified intuitive 1-D model that included an
effective free-energy barrier height that could be fit to
reproduce the rates. However, these barriers cannot be
obtained without either experimental or computational
input. To obtain kinetic information about the process,
we hence use FFS simulations, as described in the following sections.

displacement reaction as a function of toehold length for toeholds at the 3′ end (dashed line) and at the 5′ end (full line) of
the substrate strand. The errorbars show the maximum and
minimum rate obtained from all the simulations for a given
length of toehold. The rates are normalized with respect to
the mean rate for a 1-nucleotide toehold at the 3′ end.
FIG. 4. (a) An invading strand (green) at a 3′ toehold has no
cross-stacking interaction with the substrate (red) strand at
the junction, as opposed to an invading strand (blue) attached
to a 5′ toehold (shown in (b)). The 3′ cross-stacking interaction at the junction of the invading and incumbent strand is
indicated schematically with a thick black line.

Methods section. We studied systems where the incumbent strand (shown in green in Fig. 2) has 10 bonds with
the substrate strand (shown in red in Fig. 2). The substrate has a toehold of length l that ranges from 1 to 6
bases. The invading (blue) strand is fully complementary
to the substrate strand and can hence form up to 10 + l
base pairs with the substrate strand once the incumbent
strand is successfully removed. For each toehold length
considered, we calculated the rates for toeholds placed
at either the 3′ or 5′ ends of the substrate strand. All
simulations were carried out at 37 ◦ C.
At experimental concentrations (µM or less), basic displacement reactions are well-described by second-order
kinetics. For computational convenience, we simulate
much higher concentrations of strands but this can potentially lead to the breakdown of the second-order description, due to reaction intermediates that are relatively
long-lived compared to the overall reaction time scales.
To infer the relative second-order rate constants at low
concentration from our data, we neglect the time spent in
these intermediate states once binding to the toehold has
occurred in our calculation of the reaction rates from the
simulations. Note that we do not preclude the possibility
of displacement failure after binding to the toehold; we
simply ignore the time that such a process takes. More

details of this approach are provided in Refs. 39 and 50.
For short toeholds, displacement will often fail and the
invading strand undergoes frequent binding and unbinding to the toehold. For long toeholds the probability of
falling off once fully bound to the toehold becomes very
small and hence it will then successfully complete displacement with a high probability. Thus we expect the
rate of the overall displacement reaction to increase with
increasing toehold length up to a length at which it saturates.
The rates of displacement as a function of toehold
length are shown in Fig. 5. For each of the data points, we
ran at least 3 independent sets of FFS simulations. We
observe that the reaction rate of the toehold-mediated
strand displacement reaction saturates for a toehold of
around 5 nucleotides at a value that is approximately
6 orders of magnitude larger than the rate for a 1nucleotide 5′ toehold and 5 orders of magnitude larger
than for a 1-nucleotide 3′ toehold.
A similar range of relative rates was observed in DNA
displacement reactions [39, 41], where for the average toehold sequence, the rates saturated for a 6-nucleotide toehold at a value that is about 105 times larger than the
rate for a 1-nucleotide toehold. We note, however, that
we studied RNA displacement kinetics at 37 ◦ C, while the
DNA displacement was studied at 25 ◦ C. Furthermore,
no strong dependence on whether the toehold was at the
3′ or 5′ end of the substrate was observed for DNA. We
expect RNA to saturate for slightly shorter toeholds because an average RNA sequence with Watson-Crick base
pairs is more stable than an average DNA sequence.
We note that until the toeholds are long enough to

reach the saturated rate, the mean rates for the 5′ toeholds are larger than those for the 3′ toeholds. The ratios
of the mean rates for different ends of the substrate are
shown in Table I. As discussed in the Free-energy profile
section, the invading strand at the 5′ end gains additional stabilization from cross-stacking interaction with
the substrate strand (as shown schematically in Fig. 4)
and hence the probability for the invading strand to fall
off from the 5′ toehold is lower and thus the displacement
rate is increased.
Our prediction of faster rates of displacement from a 5′
toehold is based on the experimentally verified fact that
the cross-stacking with 3′ overhangs is significantly more
stabilizing than the interaction with 5′ overhangs. The
cross-stacking interaction in oxRNA captures the stabilization by a 3′ overhang, but the model does not include
the stabilization by the 5′ overhangs, as they are significantly smaller. However, they still might contribute
somewhat to the stabilization of the displacement from a
3′ toehold, which would mean that our inferred speed-up
may be slightly overestimated.
The rates were obtained with the averaged oxRNA
model and hence apply to toeholds that would have stability similar to that of the averaged toehold (i.e. with
about the same number of AU and GC bonds). However,
if one designed a system with a weak toehold (AU-rich),
then the saturation would be reached at a toehold length
higher than 5, and similarly, for strong (GC-rich) toehold, the saturation of the displacement speed would be
reached at toehold lengths smaller than 5.
We further note that it is not only the number of
AU and GC bonds that determines the free-energy stabilization for a particular sequence, but also their order
[34, 38]. Therefore, care needs to be taken in experiments
when comparing for instance the rates of the 3′ and 5′
toeholds, as the rates will be affected by the stabilization
provided by the respective toehold sequences as well as
the type of bases involved in stacking and cross-stacking
interactions, which also varies with sequence [42].
Furthermore, we would expect the saturated rates to
be different for weak and strong toehold sequences, with
the strong ones being faster, as was previously observed
for DNA [41]. It was observed for the oxDNA model
[50] that the hybridization rates are faster for stronger
sequences, as the strand has higher probability of com-

on RNA strand displacement to which to compare, we focus only on the average-model description in this work.

Displacement rate at different temperatures

We further investigate the relative displacement rates
for a three-nucleotide toehold at the 3′ end for simulation
temperatures ranging from 17 to 47 ◦ C. For each temperature considered, we performed at least 3 independent
sets of FFS simulations. The mean relative rates of the
displacement are shown in Fig. 6. The rates decrease
with increasing temperature, with the displacement at
47 ◦ C being 5.6 times slower than at 17 ◦ C.
It is interesting to compare the temperature dependence of the rates with that for the yields of invading
strands bound to the toehold only. We therefore also
performed VMMC umbrella sampling simulations where
the sampling of attachment and detachment of the invading strand to the three-nucleotide toehold at the 3′
end of the substrate was performed at 37 ◦ C and extrapolated to temperatures in the range 17 to 47 ◦ C by a
histogram reweighting method. In the simulation, the
invading strand was allowed to make at most 4 bonds
with the substrate strand. The VMMC simulations were
run with the same simulation box size as the FFS simulations, corresponding to an equal strand concentration of
65.3 µM. We observed that the decrease of the displace-

their respective values obtained at 37 ◦ C.

ment rate with increasing temperature is smaller than
the decrease of the yield of the invading strands bound
to the toehold, as shown in Table II.
These results can be rationalized with a simple model
for the toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction
(see Ref. 39 or Supplementary Material S-I). In the
second-order limit that we consider (in which the lifetime of the three-stranded intermediate is neglected), the
rate of displacement can be written as k = kon × pbm|toe ,
where kon is the rate of binding to the toehold and
pbm|toe is the probability of a successful completion of
branch migration once bound by the toehold. Further,
pbm|toe = kbm /koff , where koff is the rate of unbinding
from the toehold and kbm is the rate at which the system
initiates (and subsequently completes) branch migration.
Thus k = kon × kbm /koff .
The quantity kon /koff corresponds to the yield of invading strands attached to the toehold and is shown in
the third column in Table II. The difference in the temperature dependence of the displacement rate k and the
yield of toehold-bound duplexes implies that kbm must
be affected by the change of temperature as well. The
implied increase in kbm with temperature is presumably
due to the disruption of base pairs involved in initiating branch migration and passage over the initial barrier
to displacement highlighted in Fig. 3 is made easier by
increased temperature.
As the toehold gets shorter, we would expect kon /koff
to become increasingly less dependent on temperature.
Therefore, the temperature dependence of kbm will be
more dominant and we hence expect the slope of the
graph of the displacement rate as a function of temperature to become less negative with decreasing toehold
length. Indeed, for the shortest toehold lengths (and certainly for blunt-ended displacement), we would expect
the displacement rate to increase with temperature, as
has been reported in DNA [56].
CONCLUSIONS

We have studied toehold-mediated RNA strand displacement with a coarse-grained model of RNA, oxRNA
[34]. We observed behavior that was previously encountered in studies of DNA displacement [39]. In particular,

we showed that there is a free-energy barrier to the initiation of the displacement process that is caused by the
need for the single-stranded overhangs of the invading
and incumbent strand to avoid each other (entropic effect) and that in doing so they break the stacking at the
branch migration junction (enthalpic effect). We found
the range of the relative speed-up of the displacement
reaction (by about 5 to 6 orders of magnitude) between
the saturated rate and the rate for a 1-base toehold for
RNA is similar to that observed for DNA displacement.
We further found that for toeholds shorter than 5 nucleotides, i.e. before the saturation regime is reached, the
displacement reaction is about 2 to 9 times faster at the
5′ end than at the 3′ end. The invading strand gets additional stability from a cross-stacking interaction at the
5′ end toehold that reduces the probability of falling off
from the toehold and hence increases the rate. Such an
effect can be tested experimentally and can provide an
additional way to modulate displacement rates.
Finally, we studied the kinetics of the displacement
reaction for a three-nucleotide toehold at the 3′ end as
a function temperature. The rates decrease by about a
factor of 6 when the temperatures is increased from 17 to
47 ◦ C. The displacement rate decreases with increasing
temperature due to the destabilization of the toehold.
However, the probability of successful branch migration
increases with higher temperatures. We therefore expect
that for the shortest toeholds, the displacement will be
accelerated with increasing temperature, consistent with
experimental observations for DNA [56].
The oxRNA model used for this work does not include
explicit electrostatic interactions and was parametrized
to RNA thermodynamics at 1 M salt. It is possible to
extend our model by including a Debye-Huckel potential
parametrized to reproduce thermodynamics at lower salt
concentrations [57]. As the displacement involves two
strands in close proximity during branch migration, it is
expected that decreasing the salt concentration will have
further effects on the rate of the displacement in addition
to destabilizing the toehold. This problem, along with
the role of mismatches in the toehold region, will be the
subject of further work.
Our model currently allows only Watson-Crick and
wobble base pairs. It is possible that other kinds of tertiary structure contacts (such as ribose zippers or Hoogsteen base pairs) could influence the branch migration
process. We have also disallowed misbonds in our simulations, meaning that no mismatched bonds between
the substrate and the invading strand and incumbent
strand could occur. However, sequences used in the experiments are usually designed to avoid such misbonds,
and hence we would not expect misbonds to affect the
conclusions drawn from our simulations. It would be interesting in the future to study the effect of misbonds
and secondary structure formation on the full toeholdmediated displacement reaction.
When designing an RNA displacement reaction for
applications in vivo, the number of possible sequences

9
is greatly reduced due to biological restrictions on the
sequence that has to be recognized by the interacting
strands. Therefore, it is important to understand the
factors that influence the kinetic rates of the underlying
reaction. Our work hence provides estimates of how the
rate of the reaction can be further enhanced, such as by
placing the toehold at the 5′ end or increasing the toehold
length.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
1D-model of strand displacement

A simple 1-D model for the strand-displacement reaction was developed in Ref. 39 for DNA. For completeness,
we repeat here the estimation of the displacement reaction rate with this simple model.
We assume that the rate at which the invading strand
attaches to the toehold is kon , which is concentrationdependent. The invading strands then proceeds to successfully displace the incumbent strand during branch
migration with a probability pbm|toe , so the rate of the
successful displacement is
k = kon × pbm|toe .

(S1)

The branch migration process is initiated by displacing
the first base of the incumbent strand with a rate kfirst .
The probability of initiating the branch migration rather
than falling off is
pin =

kfirst
,
kfirst + koff

(S2)

where koff is the rate for the invading strand to fall off
once it is attached by the toehold.
We assume that there are b bases between the incumbent strand and the invading strand. Once the branch
migration is initiated and the invading strand has displaced the first base, it has a probability 1/(b − 1) of successfully completing the displacement, where we assumed
that the branch migration is a random walk where the
invading strand can gain or lose a base pair with equal
probability. When the invading strand has displaced one
base, the probability that the invading strand goes back
to being bound just by the toehold is 1 − 1/(b − 1). It
can then again initiate displacement with probability pin .
We can hence approximate pbm|toe as
pbm|toe =

kfirst
kfirst + koff




b−2
1
+
× pbm|toe , (S3)
b−1 b−1

from which we obtain
pbm|toe =

kfirst
kfirst + (b − 1)koff

which is used in the main text, where we used kbm =
kfirst
b−1 .
For long toeholds, when the saturation regime is
off
reached, we can assume 1 ≫ (b − 1) kkfirst
and the displacement rate becomes
k ≈ kon .

(S7)

FFS Simulations

The Forward Flux Sampling (FFS) algorithm [49] allows for efficient simulations of a transition from an initial
(meta)stable state A (denoted as a state Q = −2 for our
system) to a final stable state B (Q = Qmax , where Qmax
will be either 3 or 4 for our system, depending on the
choice of order parameters as discussed in the following
section). We use FFS to calculate the fluxes from a state
where the invading strand is unbound to a state where
the invading strand successfully binds to the substrate
and removes the incumbent strand. FFS introduces a series of interfaces λ in the state space between the A and
B states. First, a ‘brute-force’ simulation is run to estimate the flux of trajectories that leave state A and cross
the first interface. Then, one selects at random a crossing
point at the first interface λ0−1 that was obtained from
the generated trajectories and propagates it further until it either returns to the state A or reaches the second
interface λ10 . By repeating this process one obtains an
ensemble of points at the interface
λ10 and an estimate of

1 0
the probability P λ0 |λ−1 of reaching the interface λ10 .
The procedure is repeated iteratively for the subsequent
interfaces, and one can then estimate the transition rate
from state A (Q = −2) to state B (Q = Qmax ) as
kAB = φ0−1

where φ0−1 is the flux of trajectories leaving state Q = −2
and crossing the interface λ0−1 .
We previously used the FFS algorithm to study the
kinetics of reactions involving DNA strands with the
oxDNA model, and detailed description of this approach
can be found in Refs. 39, 50 and 51.

parameters from Table S-1 have one additional interface
compared to Table S-2. The data obtained was consistent, and is included in Fig. 5 in the main text. If simulations using order parameters both from Table S-1 and

FFS simulation results

The results of the forward flux sampling simulations
are provided in Tables S-3 to S-19 for toeholds of lengths
1 to 6 placed at either the 3′ or 5′ end at simulation temperature 37 ◦ C. The results for simulations of a 3-base
toehold at the 3′ end for temperatures 17 ◦ C, 27 ◦ C, and
47 ◦ C are shown in Tables S-20, S-21, and S-22, respectively. For each system considered, at least three independent simulations were carried out. The rates shown
in Figs. 5 and 6 in the main text were obtained as the
average of the rates from the simulations, with errorbars
showing the maximum and minimum rates encountered.
Tables S-3 to S-22 show the number of successful crossings of a given interface along with the number of trajectories launched from the previous interface, obtained

interface crossing shown in the tables is obtained as the
number of crossings divided by the number of attempts.
The numbers in brackets are the maximum absolute difference of the probability (or flux) shown in the table
and the respective probabilities estimated from the individual independent simulations. For each interface of
the individual simulations, the sampling was run until a
desired number of successful crossings was reached. Simulations from the same ensemble have the same number
of successful crossings for each interface, which can be
obtained as the number of crossings shown in the table
divided by the number of independent simulations (up to
small differences of few extra crossings for some simulations in tables S-3, S-4, S-5, and S-7 which resulted from
the implementation details for a parallel architecture).
The description of the MD algorithm used for the sampling is provided in the methods section of the main text.
