Epidemics seldom occur as isolated phenomena. Typically, two or more viral agents spread within the same
host population and may interact dynamically with each other. We present a general model where two viral
agents interact via an immunity mechanism as they propagate simultaneously on two networks connecting the
same set of nodes. Exploiting a correspondence between the propagation dynamics and a dynamical process
performing progressive network generation, we develop an analytic approach that accurately captures the dynamical interaction between epidemics on overlay networks. The formalism allows for overlay networks with
arbitrary joint degree distribution and overlap. To illustrate the versatility of our approach, we consider a hypothetical delayed intervention scenario in which an immunizing agent is disseminated in a host population to
hinder the propagation of an undesirable agent (e.g. the spread of preventive information in the context of an
emerging infectious disease).

I. INTRODUCTION

Epidemic dynamics has been largely studied with the help
of mathematical models in which a single viral agent propagates in a given host population. Although the paradigm of
isolated epidemics may be well suited in some cases, there
are numerous other situations in which more than one process
occurs and interacts in the same population. Different biological pathogens may interact through ecological [1, 2] and
immunological [2, 3] mechanisms, or multiple strains of the
same disease may compete for hosts according to some crossimmunity profile [4–6]. The spread of fear or awareness in
the context of an emerging disease [7–10] can also be considered as a case of interacting viral agents, i.e., information and
disease. In computer networks, the dissemination of countermeasures using a contagious vaccination scheme has been
suggested to counter harmful computer viruses [11–13].
When propagating in some host population, two viral
agents may follow different – or share similar – routes of
transmission. Taking into account how individuals are in contact with each other then becomes of great importance when
modeling their interaction. By explicitly considering those
heterogeneous contact patterns between individuals, networkbased models are an ideal framework for the study of interacting epidemics in structured populations [14, 15].
The interaction between two viral agents has been studied
from the perspective of complex networks in a limited number
of contributions [9–13, 16–20]. An important step towards a
general theory of interacting processes on complex networks
was recently accomplished by Funk and Jansen [20]. Generalizing the previous work of Newman [16], they analyzed the
interaction between two viral agents propagating successively
on overlay networks, i.e., two networks connecting the same
set of nodes. Albeit very elegant, their analytical approach,
based on bond percolation, is static and does not apply to the
case of dynamically interacting viral agents.

The purpose of this contribution is to develop an analytical approach able to capture the dynamical interaction between viral agents spreading simultaneously on overlay networks. To this end, we make use of a correspondence between
propagation on networks and a dynamical process performing progressive network generation [21] (see also Appendix C
of [22]). The formalism obtained is quite general, and allows
for overlay networks with arbitrary joint degree distribution
and overlap. The language of epidemiology is used throughout this work for its clarity, yet our approach may be applied
to processes of other nature that spread on networks.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce a model in which two viral agents propagate and interact
dynamically on overlay networks. The analytical approach is
then developed in two steps in Sec. III. Some properties of
the model are investigated in Sec. IV, where we also validate
the accuracy of the analytical predictions by comparison with
Monte Carlo simulations of the dynamics. Our conclusions
are summarized in Sec. V. An online supplementary document [23] containing the full set of equations of our analytical
approach completes this contribution.

II. INTERACTING EPIDEMICS ON OVERLAY
NETWORKS

In this section, we introduce a general epidemic model
where two dynamically interacting viral agents spread on
overlay networks.

A.

Overlay networks

A system of two overlay networks is defined by two networks, Γ1 = (V, E1 ) and Γ2 = (V, E2), which connect the same
set of nodes V through their own set of links, E1 and E2 [see
Fig. 1(a)] [20]. Nodes represent individuals of a given host
population, while links correpond to potential transmission
routes between pairs of individuals. As usually done in the
network litterature, we denote the size of the host population

FIG. 1. (a) Schematical illustration of a system of two overlay networks, Γ1 = (V, E1 ) and Γ2 = (V, E2 ). (b) This system can be decomposed into three non-overlapping networks: γ1 = (V, E1 \ E2 ),
γ2 = (V, E2 \ E1 ), and γb = (V, E1 ∩ E2 ).

by N ≡ |V|. Two nodes are said to be neighbors on Γg , where
g ∈ {1, 2}, if they share a link on this network, and the number of neighbors of a node on Γg define its degree kg on this
network. Neither can a node be linked to itself (no self-loops)
nor share more than one link with another node on the same
network (no repeated links).
The system is characterized by its joint degree distribution
P(k1 , k2 ) ≡ P(k), which corresponds to the probability that a
node selected at random in the host population has a degree k1
on Γ1 and k2 on Γ2 . The marginal degree distribution Pg (kg )
of each network can be obtained by summing over P(k), i.e.,
X
X
P(k1 , k2 ) .
(1)
P(k1 , k2 ) , P2 (k2 ) =
P1 (k1 ) =

of Γ1 , while “agent 2” spreads on Γ2 . If both viral agents
are transmitted through the same type of interactions between
individuals, then Γ1 = Γ2 ; otherwise, Γ1 , Γ2 .
At any time, the state of a node is given by the combination
of its particular state regarding each viral agent. For agent g,
its g-state can be either g-susceptible (S g ), g-infectious (Ig ),
or g-recovered (Rg ). The rate of infectious contacts on Γg is
βg , while g-infectious nodes recover at the rate αg and become
immune to further infection by agent g. In order to study the
dynamical interaction between epidemics, we consider a case
of leaky partial immunity [18]. When an infectious contact
occurs between a g-infectious node and a g-susceptible node
whose state regarding the other agent ĝ is Yĝ ∈ {S ĝ , Iĝ , Rĝ },
transmission of agent g successfully follows with probability
σYg and the g-susceptible node becomes g-infectious. Otherwise, it remains g-susceptible with complementary probability σYg ≡ 1 − σYg . We assume that an infectious contact on Γg
may occur only once between two given nodes.
The motivation for this interaction rule is that, while remaining general, it renders the model analytically tractable using a reasonable level of complexity. Other interaction mechanisms could have been considered, such as perfect partial immunity [18] or leaky partial immunity allowing for more than
one infectious contact between two nodes. More on this topic
is covered in Sec. III C.

Even if E1 , E2 in the general case, a given number of links
may be common to both networks. Because P(k) contains no
information about the potential overlap in the system, we will
resort to a useful decomposition into three non-overlapping
networks [20]. Let γ1 = (V, E1 \ E2 ) be the network characterized by all the links unique to Γ1 , γ2 = (V, E2 \ E1 ) be
the network characterized by all the links unique to Γ2 , and
γb = (V, E1 ∩ E2 ) be the network containing all links common
to Γ1 and Γ2 [see Fig. 1(b)]. Because it contains information
about the distribution of overlapping links, the joint degree
distribution resulting from the three-networks decomposition,
denoted by ρ(κ1 , κ2 , κb ) ≡ ρ(κ), offers a more accurate description of the system. The distribution P(k) can be obtained from
ρ(κ) by summing over κb ,
X
ρ(k1 − κb , k2 − κb , κb ) .

B. Interacting epidemics

In the single viral agent susceptible-infectious-recovered
(SIR) dynamics on a network, nodes are divided into three
states: susceptible (S ), infectious (I), or recovered (R). Infectious contacts occur between infectious nodes and their neighbors at the rate β. If a susceptible node is involved in an infectious contact, transmission ensues and it becomes infectious.
Infectious nodes recover at the rate α, and become immune to
further infection.
Here, we extend the SIR dynamics to two interacting viral
agents. We assume that “agent 1” propagates via the links

C. Monte Carlo simulations

Monte Carlo simulations of epidemic propagation on overlay networks are performed in two steps, network generation
and viral agent propagation. Our overlay networks are generated using two different algorithms, both adapted from the
well-known configuration model [24, 25].
The first algorithm, based on the joint degree distribution
P(k), generates two overlay networks with random overlap.
(i) A random degree sequence {ki } of length N subjected to
P(k) is generated.
Since a link consists of two stubs, we enP
sure that i ki,g is even for all g ∈ {1, 2}, otherwise an element of the degree sequence is selected at random and generated again; (ii) For each ki , a node with ki,1 stubs on Γ1 and
ki,2 stubs on Γ2 is created; (iii) Independently for each network, pairs of unconnected stubs are randomly chosen and
connected together until all unconnected stubs are exhausted;
(iv) The presence of self-loops and repeated links is tested on
each network. All faulty links on a network are removed by
randomly choosing a pair of connected stubs on the same network and rewiring them to the former stubs.
To generate networks with arbitrary overlap, we use a second algorithm based on the joint degree distribution ρ(κ). The
procedure is essentially the same as described above, except
that three networks (γ1 , γ2 , and γb ) are generated from ρ(κ)
with the additional constraint that one link cannot exist on
more than one network. The networks Γ1 and Γ2 are then constructed from γ1 , γ2 , and γb as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The viral agent propagation phase is carried out using discrete time steps of length ∆t. At each time step and for viral
agent g ∈ {1, 2}, every link on Γg between a g-infectious and a

3
g-susceptible node is tested for infectious contacts with probability βg ∆t, on the condition that it did not happen previously.
If the test returns positive, the g-susceptible node becomes
g-infectious with transmission probability σYg , where Yĝ corresponds to its state regarding the other agent ĝ. Recovery
events are tested with probability αg ∆t. All simulations are
initialized by infecting at random a fraction ǫ1 of the nodes in
the system with agent 1 at time t = 0. To allow for a delay
between epidemics, the dynamics of agent 2 are initialized at
time t = τ ≥ 0 with the random infection of a fraction ǫ2 of
the nodes in the system.
The simulations presented in this paper are carried out on
networks of size N = 25 000 (unless explicitly noted) with
∆t = 0.001. Both recovery rates are set to unity, α1 = α2 = 1.
Moreover, we will use ǫ1 = ǫ2 = 0.001 as initial conditions.
All Monte Carlo results shown in the figures are computed
over a total of 1000 simulations unless explicitly noted.

III.

MEAN-FIELD APPROACH

We now develop a network-based compartmental formalism that describes the dynamics of the model introduced in
the previous section. Our approach is based on the concept
of on the fly network generation recently introduced in [21].
The case of interacting epidemics on overlay networks with
random overlap is treated in the first place, and the approach
is later generalized to allow for arbitrary overlap. Finally, we
provide some insights on how to handle similar types of interaction dynamics.

A. Networks with random overlap

In order to develop the analytical approach that follows,
some preliminary considerations are needed. In Sec. II C, we
explained the two-step procedure used in Monte Carlo simulations of epidemics on configuration model networks. However, as we recently pointed out in a recent contribution [21],
an alternative procedure, consisting of one single step where
the networks are generated on the fly (i.e., during propagation,
when required), can be considered.
Recall that in the procedure of Sec. II C, we test for infectious contact every link on Γg between a g-susceptible and a
g-infectious node, on the condition that an infectious contact
never happened between them. Suppose instead we used to
test for infectious contact every stub on Γg that emanates from
a g-infectious node and that has never been the host of an infectious contact, without any further distinction. Then only
when this test returned positive would we have inquired about
the state of the corresponding neighbor. If g-susceptible, then
we would have tested for transmission. Unlike in Sec. II C,
this new procedure does not require any explicit prior knowledge of the structure of the networks in the system: neighbors
can be assigned on the fly by matching stubs pairwise at the
moment infectious contacts occur. A schematization of on the
fly network generation for a single agent SIR epidemic is illustrated in Fig. 2.

(a) t = t0 (initial state)

(b) t = t1

(c) t = t2

(d) t = t3 (final state)

FIG. 2. Schematical illustration of on the fly network generation
for a single viral agent susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic (#:
susceptible nodes, : infectious nodes, : recovered nodes). (a)
Initially, one node of degree 2 is infectious. (b) When an infectious
contact occurs over one stub belonging to the infectious node, it is
matched with another stub chosen at random between all the unmatched stubs (dashed lines), thus forming a link (solid lines). If
previously susceptible, the assigned neighbor becomes infectious.
(c) Stubs are progressively matched pairwise as infectious contacts
occur in the population. In the matching process, self-loops and repeated links are allowed, but their probability decreases as N −1 . (d)
The epidemic stops when there are no more infectious nodes. Parts
of the network not reached by the viral agent are never built.

In the case of overlay networks with random overlap, i.e.,
when stubs are matched independently at random on Γ1 and
Γ2 , an almost exact correspondence may be established between the algorithm exposed in Sec. II C and an equivalent
stochastic Markov process performing on the fly network generation [21]. The only difference arises from self-loops and
repeated links, which are allowed in the stochastic process.
However, since their probability decreases as N −1 , we expect
the results to agree in the limit of large networks.
Instead of tracking the full stochastic process, we rather focus on mean values in the asymptotic limit N → ∞ and hence
obtain a fully deterministic approach. Let [X1 Y2 ]i j (t) be the
mean fraction of nodes in the system that are of 1-state X1 ,
of 2-state Y2 , have i unmatched stubs on Γ1 , and j unmatched
stubs on Γ2 at time t [26]. The ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the time evolution of the [X1 Y2 ]i j compartment consists of two parts, accounting for the dynamics
of each viral agent. As both parts are very similar for corresponding states (e.g., agent 1 dynamics for 1-susceptible
nodes and agent 2 dynamics for 2-susceptible nodes), we exclusively focus on agent 1 dynamics. The same considerations
apply to agent 2 dynamics as well.
Let Θ1 be the probability that an unmatched stub on Γ1 belongs to a 1-infectious node,

Θ1 = P

Nodes in the [S 1 Y2 ]i j compartment will lose unmatched
stubs on Γ1 at the rate β1 Θ1 i as they are involved in infectious contacts with 1-infectious individuals. When this happens, they are either transferred to the [I1 Y2 ](i−1) j compart-

4
ment with probability σY1 (successful transmission), or to the
[S 1 Y2 ](i−1) j compartment with probability σY1 (failed transmission). This yields the following contribution to the ODE governing [S 1 Y2 ]i j :

β1 Θ1 (i+1)σY1[S 1 Y2 ](i+1) j − i[S 1 Y2 ]i j .
Nodes are transferred from [I1 Y2 ]i j to [R1 Y2 ]i j at the rate α1
due to recovery events. Moreover, a node from [I1 Y2 ]i j can be
transferred to [I1 Y2 ](i−1) j due to a loss of an unmatched stub,
which may occur in two different ways: if it is the source
of an infectious contact (at rate β1 i), or if it is victim of an
infectious contact originating from another 1-infectious node
(at rate β1 Θ1 i). Adding the incoming flow of newly infectious
1-susceptible nodes, one obtains the following contribution of
agent 1 dynamics to the ODE governing [I1 Y2 ]i j :

Nodes are removed from [R1 Y2 ]i j and transferred to
[R1 Y2 ](i−1) j at the rate β1 Θ1 i as they are involved in infectious
contacts with 1-infectious individuals. Including the incoming
flow of newly recovered 1-infectious nodes, the contribution
of agent 1 dynamics to the ODE governing [R1 Y2 ]i j reads
i
h
α1 [I1 Y2 ]i j + β1 Θ1 (i+1)[R1Y2 ](i+1) j − i[R1 Y2 ]i j . (6)
Finally, in order for the dynamics to be completely specified, an initial condition is required for each compartment.
As mentioned earlier, random infection of a fraction ǫ1 of the
population with agent 1 occurs at t = 0, which gives:

Agent 2 is then introduced at random in the population at time

model on overlay networks with random overlap can be found

B.

Networks with arbitrary overlap

Generalization to the case of arbitrary overlap requires additional considerations. They originate from the fact that the
two networks are not built independently anymore by matching stubs at random on each network. Since the structure of
one network is now influenced by the structure of the other,

an exact correspondence cannot be established with the dynamical process performing on the fly neighbor assignment
introduced in Sec. III A . We therefore have to rely on some
approximations.
Consider the networks γ1 , γ2 , and γb resulting from the
three-networks decomposition presented in Sec. II A. Let
[X1 Y2 ]i jk (t) be the mean fraction of nodes in the system that
are of 1-state X1 , of 2-state Y2 , have i unmatched stubs on γ1 ,
j unmatched stubs on γ2 , and k unmatched stubs on γb at time
t. Once again, let us concentrate on the part of each ODE that
corresponds to agent 1 dynamics.
In Sec. III A, the case of random overlap was considered
in the asymptotic limit N → ∞. Since one has Γ1 = γ1 and
Γ2 = γ2 under this condition, substituting [X1 Y2 ]i j by [X1 Y2 ]i jk
in Eqs. (3)–(6) yields the correct description of agent 1 dynamics on γ1 . Hence, we only need to derive the additional
contributions corresponding to the dynamics of agent 1 on γb .
The approximation that we will use to take into account the
overlap between Γ1 and Γ2 can be illustrated by the following example. Consider two nodes, node n (of state [X1 Y2 ]i jk )
and node n′ (of state [X1′ Y2′ ]i′ j′ k′ ), that are neighbors on Γ1 and
Γ2 , and that are just being involved together in an infectious
contact with agent 1. From the point of view of a dynamical process performing on the fly neighbor assignment, their
respective number k and k′ of unmatched stubs on γb should
be decreased by one. However, n and n′ could be later involved together in an agent 2 infectious contact. Since we do
not track the information about the states of a node’s neighbors in the formalism, one could account for this by increasing their number j and j′ of unmatched stubs on γ2 by one
at the same moment k and k′ are decreased. In other words,
the prior information that n and n′ were neighbors would be
forgotten, but the fact that they may later be involved together
in an agent 2 infectious contact is approximatively accounted
for by granting them a new unmatched stub on γ2 . If an infectious contact occurs later over one of those stubs, it will be
matched with another stub chosen at random between all the
unmatched stubs on γ2 .
Yet by doing so, we are throwing some useful information
away. When two nodes are involved in an infectious contact, they share information about their respective states. If
node n was [I1 S 2 ]i jk and node n′ was [S 1 R2 ]i′ j′ k′ , the knowledge that node n′ is 2-recovered tells us that a transmission of agent 2 will never occur later between them. Giving them an unmatched stub on γ2 would thus be ill-advised;
the i jk → i j(k −1) and i′ j′ k′ → i′ j′ (k′ −1) transitions would
be more appropriate. In summary, if node n is involved in
an agent 1 infectious contact via γb with node n′ , they will
be given an additional unmatched stub on γ2 if and only if
their states are such that an agent 2 transmission may occur
between them later in time.

We further define the probability ΘYb,1 that an unmatched stub

We denote the complementary probability Φb,1 ≡ 1 − ΦYb,1 .
First, a node in the [S 1 Y2 ]i jk compartment loses unmatched
stubs on γb at the rate β1 Θb,1 k as it suffers infectious contacts with 1-infectious individuals. This rate is composed
of two distinct parts: infectious contacts from 1-infectious
nodes with whom a transmission of agent 2 may occur later
(β1 ΘYb,1 k) and from 1-infectious nodes with whom a transmisY

sion of agent 2 may never occur (β1 Θb,1 k). As mentioned earlier, the first part yields a i jk → i( j+1)(k−1) index transition,
while the second gives the transition i jk → i j(k − 1). After
an infectious contact, the [S 1 Y2 ]i jk node becomes 1-infectious
with probability σY1 , or remains 1-susceptible with probability
σY1 . Combining those four different issues, the contribution of
agent 1 dynamics on γb to the ODE governing [S 1 Y2 ]i jk is

The complexity of the ODE system derived in the case of
random overlap increases as O(k1max ×k2max ), while it increases
as O(κ1max ×κ2max ×κbmax ) in the case of arbitrary overlap. Here
kmax and κmax represent the largest degrees beyond which the
systems of ODEs are truncated. Although high complexity
may seem to be a major drawback of our approach, a significant speed up on Monte Carlo simulations can be obtained.

C. Other types of dynamics

As we have pointed out at the end of Sec. II B, other types
of interaction dynamics could have been considered. We give
two examples to show how such alternative interaction rules
could have been analytically handled using similar modeling
schemes.
First, suppose we allow for more than one infectious contact between individuals. In this case, compartmentalizing
nodes by their number of unmatched stubs would be illadvised. Indeed, when allowing for more than one infectious
contact, the propagation dynamics cannot be made equivalent to a dynamical process performing on the fly neighbor
assignment. Opting for a local description where nodes are

IV. VALIDATION THROUGH CASE STUDIES

In order to analyze the behavior of the model and to validate
the accuracy of our mean-field approach, we consider two host
populations, A and B, which are under the threat of an agent
1 outbreak. Each host population is characterized by a different network Γ1 . For population A, the network Γ1 is fairly
homogeneous and features a Poisson degree distribution,
P1A (k1 ) = C1A

λk11 e−λ1
, 0 ≤ k1 ≤ 20 ,
k1 !

(18)

where λ1 = 3.5 and C1A is a normalization constant. We assume that the population B displays more heterogeneous contact patterns, and has a network Γ1 that follows a power-law
degree distribution:
P1B (k1 ) = C1B k1−τ1 , 1 ≤ k1 ≤ 20 ,

(19)

where τ1 = 1.5 and C1B is a normalization constant. The parameters are chosen such that both networks have the same
mean degree hk1 i ≃ 3.5 while featuring different level of heterogeneity.

as a function of the infectious contact rate β1 in the case where

R1 (∞) is computed by setting ǫ2 = 0, in which case the dynamics reduces to the case of a single viral agent SIR epidemic. Note that for β1 = 0.66, both epidemics reach approximatively the same level of incidence. For this reason, we will

sorted according to the number and state of their neighbors,
as in [27, 28], would yield a more accurate description of
the dynamics. Here, the basic state variables would read
[X1 Y2 ]iS iI jS jI (t), where iS and iI represent the number of neighbors on Γ1 that are respectively 1-susceptible and 1-infectious
(same for jS and jI regarding agent 2 on Γ2 ). Note that tracking the number of 1- and 2-recovered neighbors is optional.
Second, the leaky partial immunity rule could be replaced
by perfect partial immunity [18]. In the latter, each gsusceptible node that is of ĝ-state Yĝ regarding the other viral agent ĝ has a probability σYg of being perfectly immune
to agent g. This scenario could be analytically modeled by
introducing a fourth state compartment for each viral agent,
Vg , denoting g-susceptible nodes that are perfectly immune to
agent g.
Finally, our analytical approach could also be made compatible with SIS dynamics after slight changes in the compartmentalization scheme. Because SIS dynamics cannot be
made equivalent to a dynamical process performing on the fly
neighbor assignment, it would once again be necessary to opt
for a local description where nodes are sorted according to the
number and state of their neighbors [27, 28].

that our mean-field approach is able to capture with great accuracy the behavior of the model in the single-agent case.

A. Delayed intervention

In response to an epidemic menace, intervention strategies
involving the propagation of a second viral agent in the host
population may be employed to control the outbreak of the
undesirable agent. Examples of such strategies include the
spread of preventive information in the context of an emerging
disease, or the dissemination of countermeasures to minimize
the damages of a computer virus outbreak. In this section, we
use the framework of interacting epidemics on overlay networks to analyze the efficiency of a hypothetical delayed agent
2 intervention on the outbreak of agent 1 in the host populations A and B.
We consider a case of unidirectional immunity. We assume
that agent 2 is not affected by agent 1, i.e., σ2X = 1 for all
X ∈ {S , I, R}, while nodes that are either 2-infectious or 2recovered benefit from a given level of immunity to agent 1,
i.e., σS1 = 1 and σ1I = σR1 ≡ σ. In both host populations, the
network Γ2 , on which agent 2 propagates, is characterized by
a power-law degree distribution,
P2 (k2 ) = C2 k2−τ2 , 1 ≤ k2 ≤ 40 ,

(21)

where τ2 = 1 and C2 is a normalization constant. For now,
we assume that the overlap between the networks Γ1 and Γ2 is
random, and that there is no degree correlation between them,
such that P(k) = P1 (k1 )P2 (k2 ).
a. Full immunity. The total agent 1 incidence R1 (∞) in
host populations A and B as a function of the delay τ between
epidemics is illustrated on Fig. 4(a) for the case of full (σ = 0)
and partial (σ = 0.5) immunity. Let us consider the case of
full immunity in the first place. For σ = 0, we observe in

of a much shorter time to react efficiently if the population
in which agent 1 spreads features an heterogeneous structure,
such as a power-law distributed network. Figures 4(b) and
4(c), which also include the dependency of R1 (∞) on the infectious contact rate β2 , further confirm this observation.

is illustrated for increasing values of the delay τ in the case of
full immunity. For small values of τ (τ = 0 and 1), agent 2 is
able to inhibit the initial phase of the agent 1 epidemic in both
host populations. At intermediate τ values (τ = 5), the agent
1 epidemic is still strongly restrained by agent 2 in population A, while it has almost enough time to run its course completely in population B. As τ is further increased (τ = 10),
the effect of the intervention becomes minimal in both host
populations. Figure 5 shows that the time scale of the agent
1 epidemic in a given host population is crucial in determining the efficiency of a delayed intervention. Since this time

bars are of order of magnitude of the symbol size. Solid curves are

scale decreases with increasing network heterogeneity [29],
this explains why much smaller values of τ are required in
population B to achieve an efficient intervention.
b. Partial immunity. Let us now consider the case of partial immunity (σ = 0.5). For the host population A, Fig. 4(a)
shows that the behavior of R1 (∞) versus τ is quite similar to
the case of full immunity. The total agent 1 incidence increases slightly faster with the delay, which can be attributed
to the fact that the fraction of the population reached by agent
2 before agent 1 is now partially vulnerable to the latter. However, the picture is drastically different for the host population
B. Even when τ = 0, agent 2 is unable to inhibit the agent 1
epidemic, which reaches half as many nodes as it would reach
without any intervention.
This phenomenon is also a consequence of network heterogeneity. Consider a node of degree k1 on Γ1 that is still
1-susceptible and has acquired partial immunity to agent 1.
If it is eventually involved in infectious contacts with all its
neighbors on Γ1 , the probability that it remains 1-susceptible
in the end is (1 − σ)k1 , which decreases exponentially with
k1 . Therefore, leaky partial immunity has a weaker effect on
high-degree nodes. This observation, together with the fact
that the high-degree nodes are preferentially involved in the
early phase of an epidemic [29], explains why agent 1 is able
to invade a significant fraction of population B even when a
short-delay intervention is attempted.
Finally, Figs. 4(a) and 5 show an excellent agreement between the analytical predictions computed from our mean-

field approach and the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations of
the dynamics. As we mentioned in Sec. III A, we expect our
mean-field approach to be exact for configuration model overlay networks of infinite size and random overlap. The small
divergence between the predictions of our approach and the
mean values computed over Monte Carlo simulations can be
attributed to finite-size effects, such as stochastic extinction at
early times and the restriction on self-loops and repeated links
when generating the networks.

(a) Population A

B. Overlap and degree correlation

R1 (∞)

0.6

In the previous section, we assumed that the overlap between the networks Γ1 and Γ2 was random, and that there existed no degree correlation between them. We now relax this
assumption and look at the effect of overlap and degree correlation.
We consider a scenario very similar to that of the previous section, where agent 1 (disease) and agent 2 (intervention) propagate simultaneously in the host populations A and
B. We assume that the intervention is instantaneous (τ = 0)
and grants full immunity to agent 1 (σ = 0). The degree distributions of the network Γ1 for population A and B are respectively given by (18) and (19). Moreover, we now suppose in
both populations that the degree distribution of Γ2 is identical
to that of Γ1 , i.e. P2 (k) = P1 (k) ≡ p(k).
a. Overlap versus degree correlation. In order to be able
to isolate the respective effects of overlap and degree correlation, we distinguish between three different configurations: (i)
random overlap and no degree correlation, in which case the
system is built from P(k) = p(k1 )p(k2 ); (ii) random overlap
and full degree correlation, in which case we build the system from P(k) = p(k1 )δk2 ,k1 ; (iii) full overlap, in which case
ρ(κ) = δκ1 ,0 δκ2 ,0 p(κb ) is used to generate the system.
The bifurcation diagrams obtained for each host population
using the three above configurations are illustrated in Fig. 6.
Let us compare in the first place the two configurations where
the overlap is random. In both host populations, we observe
that agent 1 manages to invade the system more easily in the
case where there is no degree correlation between the networks. This is a consequence of the fact that the high-degree
nodes of a network are more likely to be infected in an outbreak. If the high-degree nodes on Γ1 and Γ2 correspond to the
same individuals, both viral agents will preferentially compete for their infection. In the scenario considered here, it will
therefore be harder for agent 1 to invade the system if the highdegree nodes on Γ1 are preferentially immunized by agent 2.
The difference in heterogeneity between the host populations
A and B explains why the effect of degree correlation is much
stronger in B.
Because full overlap implies full degree correlation, the
fully overlapping configuration must be compared with the
case of random overlap but full degree correlation in order to
isolate the effect of overlap. In Fig. 6, we observe that a configuration with full overlap facilitates the epidemic of agent 1
in the system. Since Γ1 = Γ2 in the case of full overlap, nodes
reached by agent 1 that are not already part of the agent 2 out-

FIG. 6. (Color online) Total agent 1 incidence R1 (∞) versus the infectious contact rate β1 in host populations A and B for different network configurations (: random overlap, no degree correlation; :
random overlap, full degree correlation; : full overlap). In all cases,
the agent 2 intervention (β2 = 1) is undelayed (τ = 0) and provides
full immunity (σ = 0) to agent 1. Points and error bars correspond to
the mean and standard deviation of Monte Carlo simulations; curves

break are more likely to be connected to other nodes that have
not yet been reached by agent 2. For a given joint probability distribution P(k), this explains why invasion of agent 1 is
easier in the fully overlapping case.
Note that the magnitude of the difference between R1 (∞)
in all the different configurations of degree correlation and
overlap is larger when the time scales of the agent 1 and 2
epidemics are comparable. When β1 is too low, agent 1 can
barely invade the system in all configurations, while when
β1 ≫ β2 , agent 1 is almost unaffected by agent 2 because
the former spreads significantly faster.
Our results corroborate the previous findings of Funk and
Jansen. In [20], they considered the case where two processes,
the first granting full immunity to the second, propagate subsequently on overlay networks. They showed that the epidemic threshold of the second process increases with positive
degree correlation between networks with random overlap,
while it decreases with increasing overlap for a given joint degree distribution P(k). In our work, variations in the epidemic
threshold are hard to analyze because both processes spread
simultaneously in the host population. Our results generalizes
the previous conclusions of [20] to the case of dynamically
interacting processes on overlay networks.
b. Partial overlap. In Sec. III B, some approximations
were introduced in our mean-field approach to allow for arbitrary overlap between Γ1 and Γ2 . To investigate their validity,

for Y ∈ {S , I, R}. While this modified approach yields a better
description of the dynamics for the epidemic scenario considered here (dashed curve in Fig. 7), we emphasize the fact that
it is not valid for the general case of an interaction rule involving partial immunity.

predictions of the analytical approach developed in Sec. III B. The

making the substitutions given in Eqs. (24).

we now consider the general case where the system is built
from the following joint degree distribution

Q (1 − Q)κ1 ,
(23)
ρ(κ) = p(κ1 + κb )δκ1 ,κ2

where Q is the mean percentage of overlap in the system.
In Fig. 7, we compare the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations with the analytical predictions of the approach developed in Sec. III B (solid curve) for increasing values of Q in
the host population A. We see that our approach becomes less
accurate as Q increases. This mainly comes from the fact that
nodes can be granted additional unmatched stubs on γ1 and γ2
after a neighbor assigment on γb , which causes the dynamics
on γ1 and γ2 to looses its exact character. Figure 7 however
shows that our approach becomes accurate again as Q gets
very close to one. While this may appear counterintuitive at
first, this is because an almost exact correspondence with the
propagation dynamics is reobtained at Q = 1. Since there are
no links on the γ1 and γ2 networks at Q = 1, the i and j indices are initially zero for each node. Thus, they are only used
to indicate the number of new stubs that are granted after infectious contacts on γb , i.e., there is no mix between real and
supposed unmatched stubs on γ1 and γ2 .
Finally, it is interesting to note that for the special case of
full immunity, an approach that handles partial overlap more
accurately can be obtained. Indeed, since agent 2 provides full
immunity to agent 1, we may use the following substitutions:

CONCLUSION

1

In this paper, we have introduced a general model where
two viral agents propagate simultaneously on overlay networks and interact dynamically via a mechanism of leaky partial immunity. Exploiting a correspondence between propagation on networks and a dynamical process performing
on the fly network generation [21], we have developed a
network-based compartmental formalism in which nodes are
sorted at any time according to their state and number of unmatched stubs. Unlike previous work based on bond percolation [16, 18–20], our analytical approach gives the complete
time evolution of the system. By direct comparison with full
Monte Carlo simulations of the model, we have demonstrated
that it is able to capture with great accuracy the dynamical
interaction between epidemics occurring simultaneously on
overlay networks featuring various level of heterogeneity, degree correlation, and overlap.
Our analytical approach is highly versatile and may be applied to numerous scenarios of diverse nature. Here, we have
considered a hypothetical delayed intervention scenario, in
which an immunizing process is disseminated in a host population to hinder the propagation of an undesirable process. We
have discussed the influence of the delay and the level of immunity on the intervention efficiency in host populations featuring homogeneous and heterogeneous network structures.
Moreover, we have shown that positive degree correlation increases the efficiency of the intervention, while overlap facilitates the invasion of the undesirable process.
Finally, this work highlights the power of the general modeling scheme presented in [21], from which our formalism
stems. Part of ongoing research focuses on the application
of these guidelines to include more realistic features in our
model, such as community structured networks [30]. Other
directions for future research include the application of our
analytical approach to investigate specific case studies, such
as the influence of other sexually transmitted infections on the
spread of HIV [31].

The dynamics of agent 1 is initialized at time t = 0 with the following initial conditions:
