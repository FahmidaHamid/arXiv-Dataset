Abstract

maximise the instantaneous distance between itself and
the threat [4]. These escape responses involve both nonlocomotor and locomotor components [5] and for some
animals, are initiated when the apparent looming rate
(the rate at which an object of a particular size appears to
change on an individual’s retina) reaches some threshold
[6, 7]. Non-locomotor components of these behaviours include the escape latency and the reaction distance to the
threat, whilst locomotor components include the turning
and tangential speeds of an escape path [5]. The timings
and directions of these escape responses are context dependent [8, 9] and rely on integrating information on the
distance and direction of an approaching threat [10, 11].
The flight initiation distances of grasshoppers, (Psinidia fenestralis) for example, changes under repeated attacks [12]. Further, the initial escape direction animals
take (with regards to the direction of attack) can also
be highly variable [11, 13, 9]. Cockroaches, for example, have multiple preferred directions of escape [14]. In
other cases, directions of escape may be limited by the
locomotory constraints on an animals movements or obstacles [11, 9]. Escape behaviour, therefore, is a classic
example of how an animal can rapidly integrate information from its environment to produce an appropriate
behavioural response that is constrained by the animal’s
biomechanics and information processing capabilities.
One aspect of the escape response that has been difficult to quantify to date, has been termed, ‘protean’ behaviour [15, 16]. Animals displaying protean behaviour
have escape paths that appear to show high degrees of
‘randomness’. This randomness has been attributed to
animals reducing the predictability of their movements
in order to avoid predators intercepting them, or to increase the likelihood that a predator abandons the chase
[17]. But the difficulty in quantifying these paths have
made these observations largely anecdotal, making it difficult to compare these responses to varying conditions
and contexts. Whilst instantaneous measures such as
the escape direction, tangential speeds, acceleration and

The escape trajectories animals take following a predatory attack appear to show high degrees of apparent ‘randomness’ - a property that has been described as ‘protean behaviour’. Here we present a method of quantifying the escape trajectories of individual animals using a
path complexity approach. When fish (Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked either on their own or in groups, we
find that an individual’s path rapidly increases in entropy
(our measure of complexity) following the attack. For
individuals on their own, this entropy remains elevated
(indicating a more random path) for a sustained period
(10 seconds) after the attack, whilst it falls more quickly
for individuals in groups. The entropy of the path is context dependent. When attacks towards single fish come
from greater distances, a fish’s path shows less complexity compared to attacks that come from short range. This
context dependency effect did not exist, however, when
individuals were in groups. Nor did the path complexity
of individuals in groups depend on a fish’s local density
of neighbours. We separate out the components of speed
and direction changes to determine which of these components contributes to the overall increase in path complexity following an attack. We found that both speed
and direction measures contribute similarly to an individual’s path’s complexity in absolute terms. Our work
highlights the adaptive behavioural tactics that animals
use to avoid predators and also provides a novel method
for quantifying the escape trajectories of animals.

1. Introduction
Prey have evolved an array of behaviours in order to
escape or avoid predatory attacks such as stotting [1],
thanatosis [2] and defensive regurgitation [3]. But when
an attack is inevitable or already initiated, the most common defence a prey uses is to flee, thereby attempting to
1

turning speeds of an individual can all be measured separately [18], how these variables combine to increase the
unpredictability of an animal’s path over time remains
unclear. These instantaneous measures provide key insights into predatory-prey dynamics and are important in
determining whether prey survive following single strikes
[19, 20, 21, 9]. However, considering some predators actively chase their prey [22, 23], if an animal can sustain
high levels of path complexity, then this is likely to be a
strong determinant of its survival chances.
Simply increasing path complexity, however, may not
be adaptive under all contexts. When an animal is further from the threat, it has more time to implement an
escape plan that could involve seeking cover [24] or freezing [25]. The presence of neighbours can also affect the
escape behaviour of individuals. When solitary herring
are attacked, fish escape in directions facing away from
the stimulus less often than when they are attacked in
groups [26]. Fish on their own also have a higher proportion of shorter response latencies compared to individuals
in groups [26] suggesting that individuals in groups have
longer to integrate information on the direction and distance of attack before performing an evasive manoeuvre.
In groups, therefore, individuals may have different path
complexities compared to when they are on their own.
We set out to quantify how an animal integrates direction
and speed changes in its escape path following an attack
over longer periods than previously analysed. In particular, we wanted to know how unpredictable an animal’s
path became following an attack. We also asked whether
the unpredictably of an escape path was context dependent, and changed as a function of the distance from the
threat, whether individuals were in groups and depending on the local density of neighbours when in groups.

cm above the waters surface). A camera (Logitech Pro
9000) placed directly above the centre of the arena filmed
the experiments at 15 frames per second. The arena was
lit by fluorescent lamps and was visually isolated. See
Movie S1 for a set-up of the experimental arena.
For each trial, we placed a single fish, or a group of fish,
into the arena and waited for 3 minutes to allow the fish
to acclimate to the new environment. During these three
minutes, the fish began to explore the arena. Following
the acclimation time, we extended the stimulus above the
surface of the water, which usually caused the fish to initiate an escape response. We released the stimulus when
the fish were at difference distances from it (distance calculated from the farthest part of the stimulus protruding
above the water). Films (n = 77 of individual fish) and
groups (n = 39) were converted from .wmv format to .avi
using DirectShowSource and VirtualDub (v 1.9.2). Trials
of individual fish were subsequently tracked using CTrax
[29]. We manually corrected any errors the tracking software had made using the associated Fixerrors GUI in
Matlab, giving the raw x,y co-ordinates of a fish’s position at every time step. For the trials with groups, we
tracked the positions of all fish before the threat using
automated tracking software (Didson Tracking Software
[30]) and manually tracked the three closest fish to the
stimulus at the time of attack using manual tracking software (Tracker v4.81). Any fish that did not move at least
1 cm in the second before the attack were removed from
analysis. This was because small tracking artefacts could
artificially inflate a fish’s entropy if it was not moving.
In total, 4 fish from individual trials and 4 fish from the
group trials were removed. To calculate the density of
neighbours surrounding the focal individuals in groups,
we determined the average number of neighbours within
5, 10, or 20 cm of the focal individual up to one second
before the stimulus entered the arena.

2. Methods
(a) Experimental procedure

(b) Path complexity

Pacific blue-eyes (Pseudomugil signifer) were caught in
hand nets from Narrabeen Lagoon, New South Wales,
Australia (334303 S, 1511617 E) and were housed in 150
l aquaria. These fish are a facultative shoaling species
found both on their own and in groups of various size
[27, 28]. Fish were held for at least two weeks prior to
experimentation.They were kept under a 12:12 dark:light
photoperiod and were fed flake food ad libitum. Fish were
fed on the evening after trials had been completed. An
annulus arena (760 mm external diameter, 200 mm internal diameter) was filled to a depth of 70 mm with aged
and conditioned tap water. The stimulus, a 6 cm2 piece
of opaque black plastic fixed to the end of a white rod, 4
mm in diameter, was angled so that it could be horizontally extended 200 mm into the arena (at a height of 2-3

We use the measure of path complexity developed by
Roberts et al. [31]. This measures the information necessary to specify a segment of the path composed of a
series of recorded positions. This measure effectively
measures how predictable or unpredictable intervals of
the movement path are, giving an indication of how well
a predator could infer the likely future location of the
fish from its recent movements. Straight line movement
can be described very simply, with a direction and a distance. Conversely, random motion requires much more
information to describe. Natural animal motion lies between these extremes [31, 32]. Defining path complexity
in this information theoretic manner gives a more fundamental measure of the unpredictability of an animal’s
motion than related measures such as tortuosity [31].

The complexity of a path segment is derived by considering an embedding matrix, M containing the recorded
positions of the animal over a time window, t, t+1, . . . , t+
n. For the results reported in this paper we use a time
window of half a second, which we find gives the best balance between the temporal precision in fixing the complexity to the path and the degree of noise in the complexity. At 15fps this gives a time window of eight time
steps. The x component of the embedding matrix is a

components. To calculate a purely directional measure
of complexity we first reconstructed the escape trajectory, retaining the direction of each movement vector
but normalising the displacement per time step to a unit
size. Similarly, to isolate the speed component we reconstructed the escape path, retaining the size of displacement for each movement vector but standardising
all movement directions to lie along a straight line. We
then applied the path complexity measure to these reconstructed paths to calculate directional or speed complexity respectively.

(d) Statistics
We used Pearson correlations to assess the relationship
between path complexity and the variables we were interested in. Because we performed many of these correlations (n = 18), we reduced the significance level using
a Holm-Bonferroni correction to control the likelihood of
Type 1 errors, retaining a 0.05 Type 1 threshold.

Before calculating the complexity of the embedding matrix we first subtract the mean for each column, to focus
on variation around the mean position within the window, creating a new matrix M ′ . The complexity of the
segment, H, is taken as the entropy of the distribution
of the singular values, taken from a singular value decomposition of M ′ . We measure entropy in bits, which
is equivalent to using base 2 for the logarithm.

3. Results
Following the introduction of the stimulus, the fish subsequently induced evasive behaviour (Supp. Video 1).
Figure 1A shows how the path complexity varies with
respect to the time of the stimulus, averaged over all
individual fish to obtain mean, standard deviation and
standard error. A clear peak in complexity occurs directly after the introduction of the stimulus, followed by
a sustained period during which the complexity is greater
than before the stimulus. This shows that a fish’s movements become less predictable in response to the perceived threat and that this new movement pattern is
sustained for at least ten seconds after a fish’s initial
change in direction. Individuals in groups had higher
path complexity than individuals on their own even before the stimulus entered the arena, but again showed a
clear peak in entropy following the attack (Figure 1B). In
contrast to individuals on their own, the path complexity
following the attack returned to pre-stimulus levels more
quickly when in groups (Figure 1B).
We then asked whether these movement paths were
more complex depending on the distance a fish was from
the stimulus. It may be beneficial for a fish that is closer
to the threat to increase its path complexity because a
small fish can out-manoeuvre a larger predator [33, 34].
Conversely, if a fish is further away from the threat, then
it may have a better chance of escape by simply fleeing
directly away in order to seek cover thereby breaking the
line of sight between itself and the threat. We may therefore expect to see a greater degree of path complexity in
fish that were closer to the initial threat, compared to
those further away.

This measure of complexity is strictly speaking a property of the path segment, rather than an instantaneous
value. In this study we take the complexity at time t to
be the entropy of the path segment that ends at time t,
since this is the first point at which the recorded position
from t enters the calculation. Therefore this is when we
expect to begin seeing the effect of the stimulus. It is important to note that this measure of path complexity is
scale, translation and rotation independent [31], meaning
that the absolute mean position, orientation and speed
of the fish within the time window will not alter the complexity.

(c) Separation of directional and speed complexity
To identify whether the complexity of the escape path is
determined by variation in direction or speed, or both,
we adapted the path complexity measure to isolate these

Figure 2 shows that this prediction is confirmed in
the escape responses of fish on their own. Whilst there
was no proximity-dependent variation in path complexity prior to the stimulus (Pearson’s R = 0.08, n = 73,
P = 0.48), there was a negative correlation between the
average complexity of the path (for a duration of one
second after the stimulus had been released) and the distance from the threat (Pearson’s R = -0.49, n = 73,
P < 0.0001). Fish that were closer to the threat had
more complex paths than those further away from the
threat. This effect did not exist, however, for individuals in groups. There was no correlation between the
distance to the threat and path complexity for individuals in groups, either before or after the stimulus entered
the arena (Before the stimulus: Pearson’s R = -0.15, n
= 113, P = 0.1; After the stimulus: Pearson’s R = -0.01,
n = 113, P = 0.91).
Because the distance to the threat did not affect the
path complexity of individuals in groups, we asked instead whether social factors influenced the path complexity of individuals in groups. In particular, we asked
whether the local density of neighbours influenced an individual’s path complexity. To test this we correlated a
focal fish’s average number of neighbours within a 5, 10
or 20 cm radius in the second before the attack, with its
average path complexity within the second before or after the stimulus. For individuals in groups, a fish’s path
complexity was not correlated with its density of neighbours within any of the distances we chose either before
of after the stimulus (Before stimulus, 5 cm radius: Pearson’s R = -0.16, n = 113, P = 0.08; Before stimulus 10
cm radius: Pearson’s R = -0.16, n = 113, P = 0.08; Before stimulus, 20 cm radius: Pearson’s R = -0.17, n =
113, P = 0.08; After stimulus, 5 cm radius: Pearson’s R
= -0.01, n = 113, P = 0.88; After stimulus, 10 cm radius:
Pearson’s R = 0.02, n = 113, P = 0.8; After stimulus, 20
cm radius: Pearson’s R = -0.02, n = 113, P = 0.85).
To assess whether directional or speed variability, or
both, was responsible for this context-dependent increase
in entropy for individuals on their own, we isolated the
directional and speed components of the path complexity by reconstructing the escape paths to exclude speed
or directional variation respectively (see Methods) and
reran our analysis on these reconstructed escape paths.
The results of analysing the reconstructed paths show
that for both components, path complexity follows a temporal pattern very similar to Figure 1, with both components rising quickly at the moment of stimulus and
remaining elevated afterwards (Figure S1). Analysis of
the context-dependency, as shown in Figure 3 shows that
both variability in speed and directional complexity are
significantly associated with the fishes’ position relative
to the stimulus (directional: Pearson’s R = -0.39, n = 73,
P = 0.0006; speed: R = -0.49, n = 73, P = 0.000009).

returns to pre-level attacks more quickly than for individuals on their own.

Whilst there was no correlation between the speed complexity and the distance to the stimulus before the attack (Pearson’s R = 0.01, n = 73, P = 0.91), after our
Holm-Bonferroni correction, the correlation between directional complexity and the distance to the stimulus was
marginally non-significant (Pearson’s R = 0.34, n = 73,
P = 0.0035). However, we attribute this to one outlying individual that can be observed in Figure 4A in the
bottom-left corner of the arena.

0.000009) than directional complexity (Pearson’s R = 0.39, n =73, P = 0.0006).

To illustrate both the change in path complexity from
before the stimulus to after, and to show the dependence
on spatial position relative to the threat, we plotted the
average complexity of paths contained within elements
of a spatial grid overlaying the experimental arena, both
for a duration of one second before the stimulus (Figure
4A) and for one second after the stimulus (Figure 4B).
It is clear that, as shown in Figure 1, the complexity of
the paths is substantially higher after the stimulus than
before. Moreover, the regions of highest complexity in
Figure 4B are those closest to the position of the stimulus.

4. Discussion
Following the simulated attack, a fish’s path rapidly increased in complexity. For individuals on their own, how
5

for individuals in groups also increased following the attack, unlike individuals, the escape paths did not vary
in entropy depending on their distance from the threat.
Nor did a fish’s local density of neighbours affect its
path complexity either before or after the attack. For
individuals on their own, when partitioning the components of speed and direction, we found that both speed
and direction contributed significantly to the overall path
complexity during the first second after the onset of the
threat. These fish, therefore, can adopt varying escape
behaviours to adaptively counteract a range of attack
scenarios.
Both speed and direction contributed to the overall path complexity in the second following the attack.
This was evident when we analysed the contribution
that speed and direction made towards path complexity depending on the distance an individual was from the
threat. Why might it be important to vary both these
components? First, it has previously been reported that
the range of directions animals take following an attack
are limited. This is because predators often attack from
the sides of prey [35], making the escape directions usually directed away from the threat [13, 36]. Second, some
animals have multi-modal directions in which they flee,
which could initially stop a predator from predicting the
initial escape direction [14], but at the same time, limits
the potential number of directions prey can take. Therefore, if a prey were to follow a limited range of directions
with the same speed, then a predator would be able to intercept the prey by predicting its position in the future.
Relying on direction changes alone, therefore, may not
provide enough variation to escape predators that chase
their prey. Changing speed, however, interrupts the predicted interception point, thereby making interception
more difficult. Indeed, from a bio-mechanic standpoint,
turning can be particularly costly [37] and speed changes
may be easier to adapt than direction. Voles (Microtus
socialis) use the same strategy when under attack from
barn owls (Tyto alba) by alternating between freezing and
fleeing behaviours, thereby decreasing the predictability
of their movements [38]. Since there is a trade-off between speed and the number of direction changes an individual can take [39], varying speed may also allow individuals to change direction during times when speed
is reduced. It will now be important to understand how
these constraints limit the maximum levels of complexity
that selection can achieve.
Before the attack, we found that the complexity of
individuals’ paths in groups was generally higher compared to when on their own. This is in contrast to the
common assumption in many models of collective motion [40, 41, 42], where individuals reduce the noise in
their motion in groups because they follow the motion
of others. Here we find that there is higher entropy in

Figure 4: The spatial distribution of path complexity before (A) and after (B) the stimulus. The path complexity
in a spatial region (5 mm × 5 mm) is calculated as the
mean complexity of the paths passing through that region
at the time of passage, over a duration of one second after
the initial stimulus. Complexity is substantially higher
after the stimulus, and high complexity regions are predominantly clustered near the stimulus’ location.

much the path increased in randomness was dependent
on the fish’s distance to the threat; further away from
the threat, individuals had lower path complexity, whilst
closer to the threat, individuals showed higher levels of
randomness. Before the attack, the overall entropy for
individuals in groups was generally higher than for individuals on their own. But whilst the path complexity

in the favour of the prey [49]. It would be impossible for
a predator to predict and intercept a perfectly random
path taken by a prey. If prey can perform movement
paths that reach these levels of unpredictability, then
predators must change their attack mechanism in order
to successfully capture their prey. In many cases, this
could lead to predators abandoning chasing tactics and
instead relying on ambush tactics. Alternatively, predators must evolve new behavioural tactics that improve
their manoeuvrability, thereby improving their chance of
prey capture [50]. With the method we have used here
to quantify the complexity of animal escape paths, we
have opened new questions into how prey and predators
interact over longer periods of sustained attacks.

the paths of individuals travelling in a group. This can
be attributed to individuals having to adjust their position depending on the movements and positions of their
neighbours [43, 44]. Following the attack, the path complexity of individuals in groups increased, but did not
show any evidence of being dependent on the distance
the individuals were from the threat. After the attack,
the entropy returned to pre-attack levels quicker for individuals in groups than individuals on their own. Other
aspects of escape behaviour change when individuals are
placed into groups. Solitary herring, for example, have
shorter response latencies to an attack compared to individuals in groups [26]. Further, the escape directions of
individuals in groups are directed away from the threat
in 88% of cases [45]. On their own, however, solitary herring move initially away from the stimulus in only 64%
of cases [26]. It appears, therefore, that being in a group
changes the way information about a threat is perceived
and responded to. When individuals are in groups, it
may be maladaptive to have substantially increased path
complexities for sustained periods, as this may result in
individuals becoming separated from the group. Indeed,
we observed that complexity levels returned to pre-attack
levels more quickly for individuals in groups than for individuals on their own. Future investigations will need
to consider how individuals integrate the information on
the position and movements of their neighbours [46, 43]
during these escape responses, and how this alters an
individual’s path complexity.
The instantaneous responses of prey to a threat depending on its distance show similar trends to our results. Webb (1982) classified two behavioural responses,
depending on the distance to the threat; either type-I or
type-II responses [47]. Type-I responses were described
as behavioural responses that showed relatively slower
instantaneous speeds and non-sustained turns. These
responses occurred when predators attacked prey from
greater distances [47]. Type-2 responses, on the other
hand, occurred when fast-moving predators attacked
from short-range distances which caused the prey to increase their speed and initial turning rate [47]. These instantaneous measures, therefore, complement our longer
time-scale observations of fish’s movement paths. Indeed,
the path complexity of an individual’s movement remains
at higher levels to those before the attack for at least 10
seconds demonstrating that the fish are in a heightened
state of arousal, perhaps envisioning future attacks. Indeed, multiple attacks are often observed when predators
attack prey [48]. Our method highlights the need not
only to investigate the initial evasive responses of prey,
but also to investigate these behaviours over longer time
scales.
Increasing the complexity of a path following an attack
may result in predator-prey arms races becoming tipped
