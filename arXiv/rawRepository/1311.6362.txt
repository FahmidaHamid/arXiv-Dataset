Binding of acridine derivative quinacrine (QA) to chicken erythrocyte DNA was
studied by methods of absorption and polarized fluorescent spectroscopy.
Measurements were carried out in aqueous buffered solutions (pH 6.9) of different dye
concentrations ([QA] = 10-6 ÷ 10-4 M) and ionic strengths ([Na+] = 10-3 ÷ 0.15 M) in a
wide range of phosphate-to-dye molar ratios (P/D). It is established that the minimum
of fluorescent titration curve plotted as relative fluorescence intensity vs P/D is
conditioned by the competition between the two types of QA binding to DNA which
posses by different emission parameters: (i) intercalative one dominating under high
P/D values, and (ii) outside electrostatic binding dominating under low P/D values,
which is accompanied by the formation of non-fluorescent dye associates on the DNA
backbone. Absorption and fluorescent characteristics of complexes formed were
determined. The method of calculation of different binding modes contribution to the
complex formation depending on P/D value is presented. It was shown that the size of
binding site measured as the number of DNA base pairs per one QA molecule bound in
the case of the electrostatic interaction is 8 times less than that for the intercalative one
that determines the competitive ability of the outside binding against the stronger
intercalative binding mode.
Key words: quinacrine, DNA, outside binding, intercalation, cooperative binding,

I. INTRODUCTION
Study of interaction between different organic dyes and intracellular biopolymers is one of
major scientific approaches which give the opportunity to obtain information about molecular
mechanisms of biological system activities. In particular, the dyes give the possibility to
visualize the intracellular structures. So, after the works of Caspesson et al. [1-3] devoted to
staining of fixed chromosomes, acridine derivative called quinacrine (QA – quinacrine,
mepacrine, atabrine – Fig.1) become widely applied in cytology. This dye fluoresces
intensively in yellow-green range of spectra, that gives the possibility to obtain the specific
staining pattern (characteristic transverse bands that appear on chromosomes), that was

2

successfully used under the chromosome analysis. High biological activity provides wide
range of its application in biology and medicine as antiprotozoal, antirheumatic, antihelmintic
agent. Quinacrine was first synthesized by Bayer (Germany) in 1931. During the II World
War it has been widely used for prevention and therapy of malaria. In the present time QA is
widely used for therapy of lambliasis, diphyllobothriasis, leishmaniasis, taeniasis, lupus
erythematosus et al. [4, 5]. It was shown that QA bound to prion peptides blocks their
transformation to pathogenic form that makes it promise candidate for design of drugs against
prion encephalopathy [6]. Such a wide range of QA action causes a great scientific interest
and the need to clarify the molecular mechanisms of complex formation between them and
biopolymers, as well as to account their structural features. The dye represents dication
compound with planar aromatic tricyclic structure, therefore its interaction with charged
nucleic acids (NA) and peptides is of special interest. Being the key participants of biological
processes, these biopolymers undergo the structural transformations as a result of the complex
formation, which can affect their functioning. For example, interaction of DNA with acridine
derivatives leads to the frameshift mutation, photocleavage and another effect [7-10].
It is well known that under the interaction of acridine derivatives with DNA, together
with strong intercalation binding, weaker external binding takes place which is conditioned by
electrostatic coupling of positively charged chromophores with negatively charged phosphate
groups of DNA backbone [11, 12]. Its contribution to the complex formation can be
significant even at physiological ionic strength of solution and high values of molar
phosphate-to-dye ratios (P/D) [13, 14]. However, in spite of great number of works
devoted to study of the dye–NA interaction, up
to now no any reliable data about quantitative
ratio between contributions of these binding
modes that can be conditioned by small number
of experimental techniques suitable to separate
them efficiently. Analysis of literature available

dye (QA).

shows that main attention was paid to the
intercalation binding of acridines to NA at high

P/D ratios [15]. The contribution of the external electrostatic binding was neglected,
considering it as unsubstantial at physiological ionic conditions. This could leads to some
error in the evaluation of binding cooperativity. External binding have also to be taken into
account when using fluorescent probes for investigation of intracellular processes.

3

Polarized fluorescent spectroscopy is powerful experimental technique which can be used
to estimate quantitatively contribution of different binding modes to dye–NA complex
formation since it is very sensitive to any changes in environment properties and
chromophore mobility. However the data about changes in fluorescence polarization degree
of organic dyes during its binding to NA are very limited. In particular, no data available on
the change in fluorescence polarization degree when QA binds to DNA in the wide range of
concentrations, different solution ionic strength and P/D ratios.
In the present work binding of quinacrine to DNA have been studied at different
experimental conditions (in the wide range of phosphate-to-dye molar ratios, P/D; at different
values of dye concentrations (10-6÷10-4 М) and solution ionic strength (0.0012, 0.01 and
0.15 М Na+)) using techniques of absorption and polarized fluorescent spectroscopy to
estimate quantitatively the contributions of intercalative and external electrostatic binding to
complex formation.

II. EXPERIMENTAL
The quinacrine dihydrochloride (QA, Fig. 1) was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg,
Germany). High-polymer DNA sodium salt from chicken erythrocyte (containing 41% of GC
base pairs) was obtained from Reanal (Hungary).
For all experiments 1 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.9, containing 0.1 mM
Na2EDTA and prepared in fresh deionized distilled water to which NaCl (Sigma Chemical
Co.) was added to give concentrations of 0.01 and 0.15 M Na+. Buffers were ultra filtered
through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore-Q system, USA) with a pore diameter of 0.22
microns.
The concentrations of the dye and DNA were determined spectrophotometrically using
the molar extinction coefficient of 260 = 6600М-1сm-1 for DNA and 424 = 9750 М-1см-1 for
QA [16]. Samples for spectral measurements were prepared by mixing the stock solutions of
known concentration in predetermined volume proportions.
Electronic absorption spectra were measured on a SPECORD UV-VIS spectrophotometer
(VEB Carl Zeiss, Jena). Measurements of steady-state fluorescence intensity were carried out
by the method of photon counting with a laboratory spectrofluorimeter based on double
monochromator DFS-12 (LOMO, Russia). Fluorescence excitation was performed by
linearly-polarized beam of He-Cd laser LPM-11 (λ = 441.6 nm), which power was stabilized
during the experiment using hand-made set-up described in [17]. The fluorescence intensity

4

was registered at the right angle to the incident beam. Ahrens prisms were used to polarize
linearly the exciting beam as well as to analyze the fluorescence polarization. The
spectrofluorimeter was equipped with a quartz depolarizing optical wedge to exclude the
monochromator polarization-dependent response. When measuring the fluorescence intensity,
the pulses from photomultiplier tube were accumulated during 10 s for each data point and
measurements were repeated five times, at that the measurements error was about 0.5%. Also
the correction was made to the absorption of the laser beam in the solution layer of the front
wall to the cell center. Fluorescence spectra were corrected on the spectral sensitivity of the
spectrofluorimeter. Experimental set-up and the measurement procedure were described
earlier [18]. The total fluorescence intensity, I, its polarization degree, p, and anisotropy, μ,
were calculated using formulas [19]:

where I II and I  - are measured intensities of the emitted light, which are polarized parallel
and perpendicular to the polarization direction of the exciting light beam, respectively.
The binding of quinacrine to DNA was followed by changes in parameters of the dye
fluorescence under titration experiments at several fixed values of QA concentration being in
the range of 10-6 ÷ 10-4 М. The QA solution was added with QA–DNA complex containing
the same concentration of the dye that gives the possibility to obtain the sample of required
P/D ratio without changing the concentration of the dye.
Fluorescence intensity and polarization degree of complexes were registered at the
wavelength corresponding to the maximum of free QA, λobs = 510 nm.
All measurements were carried out in 1 cm quartz cell at room temperature from 22 to
24 C.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Visible electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of quinacrine in a free state and bound to
DNA are depicted in Fig. 2. Absorption spectrum of the free dye represents the superposition of two
intense bands with maxima at 424 and 445 nm and less intensive shoulder. The fluorescence
spectrum is a broad intense unstructured band centered at 510 nm. Fluorescence polarization degree,

5

p, amounts to 0.035.
The results of the titration of QA solution with QA–DNA complex are presented in Figs. 3(a,b)
as P/D dependent changes in the relative fluorescence intensity, I/I0 (Fig. 3a), and polarization
degree, p (Fig. 3b). Here I0 and I are fluorescence intensities of the free and bound dye
correspondingly, measured at λ = 510 nm. The curves illustrate dependence of QA binding to DNA
on the solution ionic strength at the low dye concentrations (СQA = 10-6 М). It is clearly seen that the
binding results in the strong changes in the QA absorption and fluorescent characteristics, especially
at P/D  30 where two parts of the titration curves can be identified. So in the solutions of low ionic
strength, [Na+] = 1.2 mM, the initial part of titration curve (P/D = 0 ÷ 4) is linear, that is typical for
outside electrostatic binding of cationic dyes to polyanions [20-22].
Increase in solution ionic strength
reduces the dye binding to DNA due
to the competition between QA
molecules and sodium ions, that
results in decrease of the depth of
fluorescence titration curve minimum
for the sample with [Na+] = 0.01 M
(I/I0 = 30 %)

and

solution at room temperature.

polarization degree is substantially
slighter in comparison with that in
solution of low ionic strength (Fig.

3b). This evidences that the sodium ions weaken not only outside electrostatic binding of QA to
DNA, but the intercalative one also. However fluorescence polarization degree also reaches the
constant level of p = 0.3 at P/D ≈ 200 for the sample containing 0.01 M of Na+, and at P/D ≈ 1000
for that with [Na+] = 0.15 M (not shown).
In Fig. 4 we can see the fluorescent titration curves registered in solutions of low and high ionic
strengths at higher concentration of the dye, СQA = 10-4 М. For these samples stronger fluorescent
quenching were observed as compared with previous system (СQA = 10-6 М, Fig 3a): in the curve

6

minimum at P/D = 4 the emission is only 9 % from initial, since the fraction of the dye externally
bound to DNA is proportional to its concentration.
More visually the dependence of QA to DNA binding on dye concentration are demonstrated
in Fig. 5, where QA–DNA fluorescent titration curves are represented for the three samples at the
following dye concentrations, СQA = 10-6; 2·10-5; 10-4 М, and low Na+ content (1.2 mM). From the
figure it is seen, that that growth of QA concentration strengthens appreciably quenching of its
emission that results in a deepening of a minimum on the titration curve. However, practically total
fluorescence quenching have not observed, as it was registered earlier for QA complex with
inorganic polyphosphate (see dashed line in Fig. 5 [27]), where only pure electrostatic binding
occurred, since even at P/D = 4 nonzero contribution of intercalation binding mode to QA–DNA
complex formation takes place.
Simultaneous measurements of fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of complexes vs
P/D ratio allow to separate the contributions of outside and intercalative binding to QA –
DNA complex formation, as well as to determine the fraction of free and bound dye
molecules in the samples, since these parameters are substantially different.

where f i - fraction, I i – fluorescence intensity and i – fluorescence anisotropy for the dye
in i-state; here i = 0 corresponds to the free QA, i = 1 – to the dye intercalated into DNA and
i = 2 – to externally bound molecules. From the data obtained the plots of f i vs P/D were
constructed (Fig. 6). The curves presented in this figure relates to QA–DNA samples containing
2·10-5 М of quinacrine and 1.2 mМ Na+. They illustrate the contributions of two QA–DNA binding
modes at different ratios of the dye and polymer in solution. So, intercalative binding mode
dominates at high P/D values, whereas at low ones an external electrostatic binding prevails. With
decreasing P/D, the population density of intercalation binding sites is reduced, that leads to the
redistribution of QA molecules between two bound states in favor of external binding. For example,

8

at P/D = 50 approximately 91.2 % of quinacrine molecules are intercalated to double helix, 8,3 %
involved to external electrostatic binding, and only 0.5 % does not participate in the complex
formation. In the minimum of fluorescent titration curve at P/D = 4 the major part of dye molecules
(78.5 %) are included in the complexes of second type (external binding), and only 14 % of the
molecules are intercalated into double helix; 7.5 % of the dye remains unbound.

САХ = 10-6 M. Solid line corresponds to the curve
calculated from McGhee and von Hippel equation
(7) at К = 1.1·105 M-1 and m = 8.

Parameters of QA intercalative binding to DNA were determined from Scatchard plot (Fig.
7) constructed for the sample with low dye concentration, [QA] = 10-6 M, and high content of
sodium ions, 0.15 M Na+, where external electrostatic binding can be neglected. This binding
type is characterized by non-linear adsorption isoterm, which is well described by theoretical
dependence, obtained for non-cooperative binding of the ligands to homopolymer [30]:

r

(7),

where К is apparent binding constant, m is a size of binding site, equal to the number of base pairs
per one dye molecule, r – number of bound dye molecules per one base pair, С – concentration
of free dye. The best fit of experimental points was obtained using the next parameter in the
equation (7): m = 8, K = 1.1·105 M-1 (Fig. 7). The result means that the saturation of intercalation
binding occurs at one dye molecule per 8 base pairs of DNA. The obtained m value of is in good

9

agreement with the data [31]. Under reduction of solution ionic strength to [Na+] = 1.2 mM the
binding constant K characterizing the intercalation increases to approximately 2·109 M-1 [16].
The external electrostatic binding is characterized by substantially smaller binding sites, m = 1,
and apparent binding constant which is three orders of magnitude less than that for the intercalation.
It was estimated using model system of quinacrine – inorganic polyphosphate where only the pure
electrostatic binding of QA to DNA occurs. In solution with low Na+ content, 1.2 mM, the apparent
binding constant was found to be equal K = 1,7·106 М-1 [27]. The described above transition of the
dye from the intercalated to externally bound state can be explained using McGhee and von Hippel
theory [30, 32], videlicet, under the binding saturation the total increment of free energy can be
greater in the case of less strong interaction at the cost of higher density of the lattice binding sites.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Quinacrine binding to DNA is realized via two competing mechanisms: (i) intercalation of the
dye between the biopolymer base pairs and (ii) external electrostatic binding of the dye to DNA
polyanionic backbone with - stacking of its chromophores. Simultaneous measurements of
fluorescence intensity and polarisation degree give the possibilty not only determine the fraction of
free and bound dye molecules, but quantitatively separate the contributions of these two binding
modes. It was shown that in the case of outside electrostatical binding the size of binding site
(measured in the DNA base pairs per one quinacrine molecule) is 8 times less than that for
intercalation, that allows him to compete successfully. Upon the saturation of the QA binding an
external type of complex formation can be dominant.
