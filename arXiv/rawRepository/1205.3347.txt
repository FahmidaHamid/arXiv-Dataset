Abstract
Adaptation to local environments often occurs through natural selection acting on a large number of alleles, each having a weak phenotypic effect. One way to detect these alleles is to identify
genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with environmental variables used as proxies
for ecological pressures. Here we propose an integrated framework based on population genetics,
ecological modeling and statistical learning techniques to screen genomes for signatures of local
adaptation. These new algorithms introduce latent factor mixed models to population genetics,
employing an approach based on probabilistic principal component analysis in which population
structure is introduced via unobserved variables. These fast, computationally efficient algorithms
detect correlations between environmental and genetic variation while simultaneously inferring
background levels of population structure. Comparing these new algorithms with related methods
provides evidence that latent factor models can efficiently estimate random effects due to population history and isolation-by-distance patterns when computing gene-environment correlations, and
decrease the number of false-positive associations in genome scans. We then apply these models
to plant and human genetic data, identifying several genes with functions related to development
that exhibit unusual correlations with climatic gradients.

Introduction

Local adaptation through natural selection plays a central role in shaping the variation of natural
populations [1, 2] and is of fundamental importance in evolutionary, conservation, and global-change
biology [3–7]. The intensity of natural selection commonly varies in space, and can result in geneenvironment interactions that have measurable effects on fitness (e.g. [8]). Adaptive divergence can
then cause local populations to evolve traits that provide advantage under local environmental conditions.
In principle, identifying chromosomal regions involved in adaptive divergence can be achieved by
scanning genome-wide patterns of DNA polymorphism [9,10]. Usually, the aim of screening procedures
is to detect locus specific signatures of positive selection. In populations inhabiting spatially distinct
environments, loci that underlie adaptive divergence can be detected by comparing relative levels
of differentiation among large samples of unlinked markers [11, 12] and by using empirical tests to
compare levels of differentiation to the genomic background [13, 14].
An alternative way to investigate signatures of local adaptation, especially when beneficial alleles
have weak phenotypic effects, is by identifying polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with
environmental variables [3, 15–18]. In natural populations, quantitative traits that exhibit continuous
geographic variation are often associated with specific variables reflecting selective pressures acting on
individual phenotypes [19] . This type of variation is then reflected in geographic clines or in sympatric
populations that exploit different ecological niches [20]. Evidence for local adaptation to continuous
environments can be detected if there is highly significant association with the environmental variables
at some loci compared to the background genomic variation.
However the geographical basis of both environmental and genetic variation can confound interpretation of the tests [21], as local adaptation can be hindered by gene flow [22], and can be difficult
to distinguish from the effects of genetic drift and demographic history [14]. As a consequence, when
no corrections for the effects of population structure or isolation-by-distance are considered, tests for
associations between loci and environmental variables using classical regression models are prone to
high rates of false-positives [23]. Recent studies have used the background patterns of allele frequencies
to build a null model which accounts for the effects of drift and demographic history [15,18,24,25]. To

correct for population stratification, [15] used an empirical approach that estimates the covariance of
allele frequencies among populations. These authors assessed the evidence for local adaptation of each
allele by testing whether or not environmental variables explained more variance than a null model
with this particular covariance structure.
Here we argue that, unless a list of a priori selectively neutral loci are used to build the empirical
covariance matrix, empirical tests may face a problem of circularity. The need to identify neutral loci
from the genomic background before testing implies that these tests lack power to reject neutrality.
In this study, we address this problem by introducing new statistical models, called latent factor
mixed models. Using these models, we test correlations between environmental and genetic variation
while estimating the effects of hidden factors that represent background residual levels of population
structure. To perform parameter estimation, we extend probabilistic principal component analysis
and recent statistical learning approaches [26–28]. Based on low rank approximation of the residual
covariance matrix, we implement algorithms to deal with hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms
with very rapid computing times. We show that our algorithms control for random effects due to
population history and spatial autocorrelation when estimating gene-environment association, and we
provide examples of how our approach can be used to detect local adaptation in plants and humans.

Method

Consider the data matrix, (Gi` ), where each entry records the allele frequency in population or individual i at the genomic locus `, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ ` ≤ L, and n and L represent the total sample size
and number of loci, respectively. For simplicity, we assume our loci are biallelic, e.g. single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), and data are avaiable for each individual. In this case, for each marker, there
is an ancestral and a derived allele, and Gi` is the number of derived alleles for locus ` and individual i.
For diploid data, Gi` is thus equal to 0, 1 or 2, and corresponds to the genotype at locus `. In addition
to the genotypic data, we have a vector of d geographic and environmental variables, (Xi ), for each
individual. The vector of covariates could include latitude and longitude, habitat and other ecological
information, climatic variables, etc, that serve as proxies for unknown environmental pressures (For
example, see [15, 21]).

Model. To evaluate associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables while
correcting for background levels of population structure, we regard the matrix G as being a response
variable in a regression mixed model
Gi` = µ` + β`T Xi + UiT V` + i` ,

(1)

where µ` is a locus specific effect, β` is a d-dimensional vector of regression coefficients, Ui and V`
are scalar vectors with K dimensions (1 ≤ K ≤ n). The residuals i` are statistically independent
Gaussian variables of mean zero and variance σ 2 . We use Bayesian analysis to estimate the regression
coefficients and their standard deviations. We assume Gaussian prior distributions on µ` and β`j with
means equal to zero and variances σµ2 and σβ2j (β`j ∼ N(0, σβ2j )). Prior distributions on Ui and V`
are Gaussian distributions with means equal to zero and constant variance for each component (the
components are independent random variables). The variance of V` is set to σV2 = 1, and all other
prior distributions on variances are non-informative. We refer to the above statistical model as a
Latent Factor Mixed Model (LFMM).
In LFMMs, environmental variables are introduced as fixed effects while population structure is
modeled via latent factors. To separate neutral variation from adaptive variation, the matrix term
U T V models the part of genetic variation that cannot be explained by the environmental pressures.
Note that the use of factorization methods is closely related to estimating population structure via
singular value decomposition, a well-established technique for identifying scores and loadings in principal component analysis (PCA, [29]). Recently, matrix factorization methods have been generalized
to include probabilistic PCA [26] and probabilistic matrix factorization algorithms [27], which have
proven useful in analyzing population genetic data [28]. To clarify the connection between LFMM and
PCA, assume that no environmental variable is available. In this case, we set β` = 0 for all locus `.
In matrix factorization algorithms, a data matrix G with n rows and L columns can be decomposed
into a product of two matrices U and V , where U has n rows and K columns, and V is a K-by-L
matrix. Following [30], we assume that the genotypic data are centered. We consider the matrix
P
Yi` = Gi` − Ḡ.` , where we have substracted the mean value of each column, Ḡ.` = ni=1 Gi` /n. For

each individual i and locus `, the decomposition is
Yi` = UiT V` =

With K = L, this approach is similar to computing PCA loadings and scores [29]. The number
of components K can, however, be chosen much lower than the number of loci or individuals. In
simulations, we based our choice of K on Tracy-Widom theory [30]. In real applications, this choice
of K may be replaced by other estimates of population genetic structure. When values are lower than
50, our algorithm is essentially a low-rank approximation of the covariance structure [31], which leads
to computationally fast estimation algorithms.
To simultaneously estimate scores and loadings, environmmental effects and biases, we implemented a Gibbs sampler algorithm for LFMMs (File S1). The Gibbs sampler is based on computing
products of matrices of low dimension (typically, K ≤ 50), and its speed scales with the current size
of SNP data sets, around n ≈ 1, 000 and L ≈ 500, 000. In addition, we implemented a stochastic algorithm to compute standard deviations and |z|-scores for the environmental effects. Using the empirical
distribution of |z|-scores obtained from all L loci, we compared each locus to the genomic background
and retained loci with |z|-scores exhibiting the highest absolute values. From a preliminary set of
experiments using data simulated from the model defined in equation (1), we found that the estimates of fixed effects stabilized quickly, after 1,000 to 10,000 sweeps for n = 100 − 1, 000 individuals
and L = 1, 000 − 100, 000 loci. A 10-fold increase in the number of sweeps, however, was necessary
to recover the true values of the latent factors. Additionally, we developed numerical optimization
methods to compute maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for the LFMM. One of these methods,
the alternate least square method uses deterministic steps that are similar to our stochastic Gibbs
sampler [32]. When checking for convergence of the MCMC algorithm, we also found that least square
estimates of regression coefficients were close to the point estimates computed by the Gibbs sampler
method.
Theoretical considerations. Incorporating population genetic structure via estimates of admixture
proportions or principal component analysis is common in genome-wide association studies [33, 34]).

[18] developed an alternative approach to identify loci underlying local adaptation in the computer
program Bayenv. To explain the difference between our approach and Bayenv, suppose that we start
by computing PCA scores from the matrix Y for all individuals, and denote by Ũi the PCA scores for
individual i. The product matrix Ũ Ũ T is thus equal to the empirical covariance matrix
Ũ Ũ T = Y Y T/n .

(4)

Now using the scores as covariates in a Bayesian regression model, we obtain
G = µ + β T X + Ũ T V + .

(5)

By a change of variables, this is equivalent to fitting the model
G = µ + β T X + ˜

(6)

where the distribution of ˜ is a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the covariance matrix equal to
σ 2 Id + σV2 Y Y T /n (Id is the n-dimensional identity matrix). Setting σV2 = 1 and considering small
values of the scaling parameter σ 2 , the model defined in equation (6) is nearly equivalent to the model
implemented in Bayenv. In a Bayesian Gaussian regression framework, incorporating PCA scores
as covariates in an association model is equivalent to modeling residuals as Gaussian vectors with
covariance depending on the empirical covariance matrix of the genotypic data. Though the Bayenv
model uses a different link function, its residual term has the same covariance matrix as the genotypic
data. From a theoretical point of view, the main difference between the Bayenv model and LFMM is
the inference of the factor matrix U which is done in a fully Bayesian algorithm in LFMMs and in an
empirical Bayes algorithm in Bayenv (see Discussion).

Simulation Study

We designed experiments based on simulated data to answer the following questions: 1) Are tests
based on LFMMs conservative or liberal? 2) How does the LFMM algorithm perform compared to
existing methods such as logistic or standard regression models [3], principal components regression
and other existing mixed models [18]?

Distribution of P -values under the null hypothesis. We used equation (1) with β = 0 to
generate data under a null hypothesis of no association with any environmental variables. In these
experiments, we set the number of individuals to n = 100, and the number of loci to L = 1, 000.
We used 6 values, K = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20, for the rank of the factor matrix, V . For each series of
experiments, we generated 10 replicates of this generative model, and we studied the distributions of
P -values for tests using LFMMs. In these tests, we set the rank of the factor matrix equal to the
values we used to generate simulations.

Figure 1: Empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) for LFMM tests for simulations from a
generative model using A) K=5, B) K=20 latent factors.

Figure 1 reports the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf) for K = 5 and K = 20.
Plots for the other values of K are shown in Figure S1. For values of K lower than 5, the ecdf was
close to a uniform distribution. For K = 20, the tests were slightly conservative. Thus, for moderate
and for large values of the number of latent factors, the tests produced small numbers of false positive
associations.
Next we used equation (1) to generate data showing various levels of population structure and
association with an environmental variable. The environmental variable was uniformly generated
in the range (0, 1). Here we used 3 values for the rank of the factor matrix, K = 2, 20 and 100,

representing low, moderate and high levels of underlying population genetic structure. For each series
of experiments, we generated 20 replicates of the generative model and compared the distribution of
statistical errors for three estimation approaches: 1) LFMM, 2) standard linear regression model, 3)
PC regression model. With the notations from section 2, these models were defined as follows. The
LFMM was defined by equation
Gi` = µ` + β`T Xi + UiT V` + i`
where we set the rank of the factor matrices equal to the values we used to generate simulations. The
standard regression model was defined as
Gi` = µ` + β`T Xi + i` .

(7)

The PC regression model was defined as
Gi` = µ` + β`T Xi + ŨiT V` + i` ,

(8)

where (Ũi ) are the first K PCs computed from the matrix G. To compute point estimates of environmental effects and their |z|-scores, Gibbs sampler algorithms were run for 1,000 sweeps after a burnin
period of 100 sweeps. For these particular run length parameters, we checked that similar estimates
were obtained for distinct initializations of the algorithm. For each locus, we recorded both the true,
B` , and estimated environmental effects, B̂` , and evaluated the absolute error

Quantiles of absolute errors (LFMM)

Figure 2: Quantiles of absolute errors for the standard linear regression, PC regression and LFM
models using simulations from the LFM model with A) K=2, B) K=20 and C) K=100 latent factors.

Figure 2 reports the quantiles of absolute errors for the LFMM, the standard linear regression and
PC regression models. For the LFMM, absolute errors ranged between 0 and 0.6 for K = 2 − 20,
and between 0 and 1.0 for K = 100. Mean squared errors indicated that the bias and variance
of estimates were small (Table 1). Compared to LFMMs, the relative errors of the linear and PC
regression estimates increased with the rank of the hidden factor matrix. The absolute errors of these
algorithms ranged between 0 and 1.4 for K = 2, between 0 and 3.2 for K = 20, and between 0
and 9.2 for K = 100. When linear or PC regression models were fitted to the data, the quantiles of
errors shifted to values ≈ 1.74-fold higher for K = 2, ≈ 3.8 to 4.1-fold higher for K = 20, and ≈ 5.5
to 7.7-fold higher for K = 100. Mean squared errors provide additional evidence of relatively poor
performances of the linear regression and PC regression estimates when levels of underlying structure
increase (Table 1).

Spatial coalescent simulations.

In another series of experiments, we compared the LFMM esti-

mation algorithm against two methods that do not correct for population stratification, and against
two methods that use the empirical covariance matrix as a correction. The first set of methods include a linear model and generalized linear model (LM and GLM, [3]), and the second set of methods
include a PC regression model (PCRM) and the mixed model Bayenv [18]. To enable comparisons, we

simulated genotypic data from spatial coalescent models with the computer program ms [35]. Ten data
sets were generated according to a linear stepping-stone model with 40 demes, setting the effective
migration rate between pairs of adjacent demes to the value 4N m = 25. Sampling 5 individuals in
each deme, each data set included a total of n = 200 haploid individuals genotyped at L = 1, 000
SNP loci. Using Tracy-Widom tests implemented in SmartPCA, we found that the number of principal
components with P -values smaller than 0.01 was around KTW = 7. We ran the Gibbs sampler algorithm during 100 sweeps for burnin, and we used the next 900 sweeps to compute points estimates,
variances and |z|-scores.

Distribution of P -values.

To examine the outcome of tests when genetic variation is neutral at all

loci, we computed the distributions of P -values under a LM, GLM, PCRM and LFMM with different
values for the number of latent factors (K ranging from 1 to 20). The distributions of P -values for
tests based on LM and GLM showed a strong departure from the uniform distribution (Figure 3A-B).
In those cases, the tests were too liberal, and produced a large number of false positive results. Using
K = 7 latent factors or PCs, the distribution of P -values for tests based on an LFMM or PCRM was
much closer to a uniform distribution (Figure 3C-D). In addition, we found that choosing K based on
Tracy-Widom theory led to slightly conservative tests for the particular simulation settings used here.
Ecdf for all values of K are shown in Figures S2 and S3, respectively.

B) the generalized linear model (GLM), C) the LFM model using K = 7 latent factors (LFMM), and
D) the PC regression model using K = 7 principal components (PCRM).

Next we evaluated the ability of LFMMs to detect loci exhibiting correlations with particular
environmental gradients, and compared tests based on an LFMM with methods based on linear models
and the computer program Bayenv [18]. An environmental variable, x, was defined for each population
as the geographic identifier of the population in the linear stepping-stone model. We created an
environmental gradient using a logistic function, s(x), of x as follows
s(x) =

1
1+

eθ(x−20)

,

θ > 0.

(9)

For each of the 10 previously generated neutral stepping-stone simulations, we simulated binary alleles
for each deme x at 50 loci with frequency s(x), with the slope of the gradient θ = 0.2. We then obtained
10 data sets with L = 1050 loci including 50 loci correlated with the environmental gradient, s(x).
Across these datasets, smartPCA estimates between 5 and 7 significant eigenvectors (P < 0.01 in the

Tracy-Widom test). For the simulated data sets, we evaluated the percentage of false negative (FN)
and of false positive (FP) tests based on LM, GLM, PCRM and LFMM, for two values of the type I
error (Table 2).
Using θ = 0.2 in simulations of non-neutral loci, we found that linear models exhibited high
percentages of FP. In contrast, tests based on PCRMs exhibited very large percentages of FN, and
had no power to reject neutrality. Tests based on LFMM produced low numbers of FP, and had
reasonable power to reject the null hypothesis of no association.

Comparisons with Bayenv.

For each of the 10 previously generated neutral stepping-stone sim-

ulations, we simulated binary alleles for each deme x at 50 loci with frequency s(x), using θ = 0.1.
To enable comparision with the program Bayenv, which returns Bayes factors instead of P -values, we
considered ranked lists recording the M loci corresponding to the strongest (true) associations (M
between 1 and 1,050). For each M , we computed the number of true positives and the number of
false negatives. Locus ranking was performed on the basis of |z|-scores in LFMM, and on the basis of
Bayes factors in Bayenv. The LFMM tests used values of K equal to K = 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20, and we
used the default parameters of the Bayenv algorithm to compute Bayes factors (run length of 30,000
sweeps). Experiments were assessed by measuring the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve (AUC) averaged over 10 replicates. The mean AUC for tests based on LFMM with K = 5 − 7
factors were around 0.95 − 0.96 whereas the AUC for Bayenv was equal to 0.88. In the linear stepping
stone model simulations, the tests based on LFMM obtained better performances than Bayenv for all
values of K (Figure 4).

Data Analysis

To illustrate the application of LFMMs, we analyzed genomic data sets of Loblolly Pines (Pinus taeda,
Pinaceae, [21]) and humans (Human Genome Diversity Panel, [36]).

Loblolly Pine
The Loblolly Pine is distributed throughout the southeastern USA, ranging from the arid Great Plains
to the humid Eastern Temperate Forest ecoregion. The data consisted of 1,730 SNPs selected in
expressed sequence tags (EST) for 682 individuals [21]. Following [21], we considered 5 environmental
variables representing the five first components of a PCA for 60 climatic variables. The first component
(PC1) was mainly described by latitude, longitude, temperature and winter aridity. PC2 was described
by longitude, spring-fall aridity and precipitation [21].
For each of the 5 environmental variables, we applied the LFMM algorithm using 100 sweeps
for burnin and 400 additional sweeps to compute |z|-scores for all loci. Based on a prior analysis
of the genotypic data with the program SmartPCA, we used K = 10 latent factors. A total of 392,

113 and 30 SNPs obtained |z|-scores greater than 3, 4 or 5 for at least one environmental variable,
respectively. Based on this result, we considered that a SNP effect was significant when its |z|-score
was greater than 4 (two-sided test). Among the 50 loci with the highest |z|-scores, 17 were shared with
those detected by [21] using Bayenv. Seven of the 10 SNPs with Bayes factors greater than 103 were
confirmed by the LFMM analysis. For the first and second enviromnental variables, the two SNPs
which obtained the highest Bayes factors using Bayenv were recovered by the LFMM analysis. Table 3
provides a list of SNPs associated with climatic gradients and their functional annotation. Compared
to the analysis of [21], the LFMM analysis discovered new significant and interesting associations
with climatic gradients, for example, the chloroplast lumen 19 kDA protein involved in photosynthesis
(|z| = 6.42), a pentatricopeptide repeat protein involved in oxidative stress and salt stress (|z| = 5.90),
and the heat shock transcription factor hsf5 (|z| = 5.60) involved in regulation of transcription and
response to temperature stress (Table 3 and Table S1).

Human data analysis
We applied an LFMM analysis to a worldwide sample of genomic DNA from 1,043 individuals in
52 populations, referred to as the Human Genome Diversity Project – Centre Etude Polymorphism
Humain (HGDP-CEPH) Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel (hagsc.org/hgdp/). The genotypes
were generated on Illumina 650K arrays [36], and the data were filtered to remove low quality SNPs
included in the original files.
We extracted climatic data for each of the 52 population samples using the WorldClim data set
at 30 arcsecond (1km2 ) resolution [37]. These data include 11 bioclimatic variables interpolated from
global weather station data collected during a 50 year period (1950-2000). The climatic variables
included annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, maximum temperature of warmest month,
minimum temperature of coldest month, annual precipitation, etc (Table S2). We summarized the
climatic variables by using the first axis of a principal component analysis. For this first principal
component, we applied the LFMM algorithm to compute |z|-scores for each locus with K = 50 latent
factors, using 100 sweeps for burnin and 900 additional sweeps to warrant convergence.
A total of 2,624 (0.4%), 508 (0.08%) and 65 (0.007%) SNPs obtained |z|-scores greater than 5, 6
or 7, respectively (Figure S3). Among loci with |z|-scores greater than 5, 28 GWAS-SNPs with known

disease or trait association were found [38]). These include several SNPs discovered by [24]. For
example the SNPs rs12913832 and rs28777, |z|-scores greater than 6, are associated with genes OCA2
and SLC45A2 (Table 4). Among the SNPs significantly correlated with climatic gradients, several
notable examples include genes associated with celiac disease (ICOSLG), height (LHX3-QSOX2 and
IGF1), and vitamin D synthesis or activation (NADSYN1 encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
synthetase and DHCR7 the gene encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, an enzyme catalyzing the
production in skin of cholesterol from 7-dehydrocholesterol (Table 4). Among the 65 SNPs with |z|scores greater than 7, 31 were located within genes (Table S3). One interesting result is that several
genes are associated with multicellular organismal development. EPHB4 (|z| = 8.90) is involved in
heart morphogenesis and angiogenesis, NRG1 (|z| = 7.15) involved with nervous system development
and cell proliferation, RBM19 (|z| = 7.04) involved with positive regulation of embryonic development,
EYA2 (|z| = 7.09) involved with eye development and DNA repair, and POLA1 (|z| = 7.63) involved
with the mitotic cell cycle and cell proliferation [39, 40].

Discussion

Interpretation of LFMM results and other methods.

Based on a matrix factorization ap-

proach, LFMMs incorporate a unified framework for estimating effects of environmental and demographic factors on genetic variation. Without environmental variables, LFMMs are equivalent to
performing a probabilistic PCA of allele frequencies [26]. When environmental variables are included,
hidden factors capture the part of genetic variation that cannot be explained by the set of measured
environmental variables. This fraction of genetic variation could result from the demographic history
of the species, unknown environmental pressures or from IBD patterns.
While a plethora of statistical tests have been proposed for detecting genes evolving under positive
selection and local adaptation [10, 14], the development of tests based on correlations with habitat or
landscape variables is still recent [3, 15]. Compared to methods based on summary statistics, tests
based on environmental association have increased power to detect selection from standing genetic
variation and soft sweeps in a species genome [6, 17]. However, simple implementation of these tests,
for example simple linear or logistic regression models, can be misleading in the presence of IBD

patterns [23]. Our simulation results provide clear evidence that tests based on LFMMs significantly
reduce the rates of false positive associations in the presence of IBD.
While both the mixed model approach of the computer program Bayenv and the LFMM approach
includes a covariance structure in a regression model, there are important differences between the two
approaches. A first improvement is that LFMMs estimate latent factors and regression coefficients
simultaneously, while Bayenv first estimates a covariance matrix, and then uses it when estimating
(random) environmental effects. To apply Bayenv, the authors suggest utilizing selectively neutral
SNPs to estimate the covariance matrix. This approach requires separating neutral from adaptive
variation a priori, and is difficult to apply when selection acts on phenotype at a large number of loci.
Inclusion of adaptive markers in the ”neutral set” is sometimes unavoidable, and in this case, Bayenv
may overlook interesting associations. This distinction between approaches explains the observed
differences in the lists of outlier loci for Loblolly pines, where 1,730 SNPs were genotyped in expressed
sequences. For these data it was extremely difficult to select neutral SNPs from the background a priori.
Another distinction between LFM and Bayenv approaches is our use of low rank approximations of the
covariance matrix. LFMMs actually estimate correlations between environmental predictors and allele
frequencies while K hidden factors explain residual genetic variation, where K is much smaller than
the sample size. The low rank approximation is computationally faster than Bayenv when analyzing
large data sets.

Number of latent factors.

In the LFM modeling approach, the choice of low values for K is

important for optimizing the computational performances of the estimation algorithm. This choice is
reminiscent of selecting the number of components in PCA or in Bayesian clustering programs, and it
has also an impact on test outcomes. For values of K taken too large, the tests are highly conservative,
and the power to reject neutrality declines. Values of K that minimize the trade-off between the bias
and variance for our statistical estimates could be obtained by using cross-validation procedures, but
cross-validation procedures are computationally intensive, so instead we use Tracy-Widom theory to
select K [30]. We evaluated this choice during our simulation analysis, and found that it led to slightly
conservative tests. Although the choice of Tracy-Widom estimates is suboptimal, the performances
of LFMMs were still superior to those of Bayenv in simulations of IBD patterns. In the analysis of

human data, we restricted K to be less than 50 (approximately the number of population samples).
We suggest that, when there is a reasonable estimate of the number of genetic cluster for a species, it
can be used in LFMM tests directly. While finer grain population structure could be evaluated [41],
our choice was again motivated by a trade-off between accuracy and run-time. A future development
of our LFMM approach will be to develop fast numerical optimization procedures based on variational
approximations of the likelihood, which will allow us to implement cross-validation algorithms and
increase the power of tests.

Plant and human data. For Pinus taeda, the LFMM results confirmed that several ESTs previously discovered with Bayenv had functions linked to climate [21]. In addition, the LFMM analysis
discovered new interesting candidate SNPs. Those variants include functions associated with wound
repair and immunity, photosynthetic activity and carotenoid biosynthesis, cellular respiration and carbohydrate metabolism, heat, salt and oxidative stress responses (Table 3). Applying LFMMs to the
HGDP data, we found that a total of 0.4% of all polymorphisms (2,624 SNPs) exhibited significant
associations with temperature gradients (|z| > 5). For example, we identified SNPs associated with
the gene OCA2 that may be functionally linked to blue or brown eye color and the gene SLC45A2 that
may be associated with skin pigmentation [24]. This list also contained SNPs associated with height
and vitamin D synthesis and diseases such as gluten intolerance and Crohn’s disease. Our list of genic
SNPs with |z|-scores greater than 7 (|z| > 7) was enriched in genes involved in organismal development. For example, the genes EPHB4, BOK, and NRG1 −with functions related to heart and brain
development− were associated with climatic gradients. Overall, the analysis confirmed that many loci
are associated with climatic gradients or to correlated evolutionary pressures (for example, pathogenic
environment). This result supports the hypothesis that soft sweeps may have been common in recent
human evolution [17].

Conclusion.

With ever increasing amounts of genetic data generated by high-throughput sequenc-

ing technologies, population genetic methods have shifted from traditional statistical approaches to
approaches that use statistical learning techniques. Estimates of ancestry and other population parameters are commonly obtained from mixture models [42–44], principal component analyses [30], hidden

Markov models [45] and factor analysis [28]. Our study contributes to the machine learning toolbox
for population and landscape genomic analysis by implementing new gene-environment association
tests based on matrix factorization methods.
