Abstract
Variations of instantaneous heart rate appears regularly oscillatory in deeper levels of
anesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anesthesia. It is impossible to observe this
“rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon from raw electrocardiography waveform in current standard anesthesia monitors. To explore the possible clinical value, I proposed the
adaptive harmonic model, which fits the descriptive property in physiology, and provides
adequate mathematical conditions for the quantification. Based on the adaptive harmonic model, multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform was used to provide time-varying
power spectrum, which facilitates to compute the quantitative index: “Non-rhythmicto-Rhythmic Ratio” index (NRR index). I then used a clinical database to analyze the
behavior of NRR index and compare it with other standard indices of anesthetic depth.
The positive statistical results suggest that NRR index provides addition clinical information regarding motor reaction, which aligns with current standard tools. Furthermore,
the ability to indicates the noxious stimulation is an additional finding. Lastly, I have
proposed an real-time interpolation scheme to contribute my study further as a clinical
application.

Keywords: instantaneous heart rate; rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic; Synchrosqueezing transform; time-frequency analysis; time-varying power spectrum; depth of anesthesia; electrocardiography

Introduction
1.1

Field of Project

The human body undergoes unique conditions when under anesthesia. Anesthesiologists
administer anesthetics, also known as anesthetic medicine, dependent on the patient’s
physiological information. The physiological information may include the patient’s heart
rate, blood pressure, and electroencephalography (EEG) as this information reflects the
inner dynamics of the human body. My study will present a new perspective on the
physiological information that could contribute to the clinical practice of anesthesia.

1.2

An Obscure Phenomenon

As a practicing anesthesiologist, I have noticed that the instantaneous heart rate (IHR)
fluctuates dependent on the various levels of anesthesia – it became regularly oscillatory in
deeper level of anesthesia, whereas it became less regularly in lighter level.(see Fig.1.1) This
phenomenon, I refer to as “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon”, has been described
qualitatively in the past. However, to the best of my knowledge, no quantitative method
has been proposed. Also, the underlying physiological mechanism has not been addressed.

1.3

Quantification for Depth of Anesthesia

This phenomenon has induced three questions – 1) how to quantify this phenomenon into
a useful index, 2) whether the quantitative index can reflect the level of anesthesia, and
3) what are the underlying physiological mechanisms.

1

Chapter 1. Introduction

Figure 1.1:
The tracing of R-R peak interval (RRI) represents instantaneous heart rate (IHR) exhibiting “rhythmic” or “non-rhythmic” patterns during anesthesia. This phenomenon is
difficult to be read from the raw electrocardiography (ECG) waveform. Interestingly, the
ECG waveform is mandatory in standard anesthesia monitor, but IHR is not.

For an anesthesiologist, information from this phenomenon is unavailable in the clinical perspective. From Fig.1.1, it is apparent that the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon can be seen from the tracing of instantaneous heart rate, but not from raw
electrocardiographic (ECG) waveform. Although real-time monitoring of ECG is mandatory in the modern anesthesia monitor, the tracing of instantaneous heart rate is not displayed. Even though an anesthesiologist was aware of this phenomenon, he cannot obtain
“rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon information from modern anesthesia monitor to
improve the anesthetic management.
If NRR index can provide additional clinical value, I believe that it could help in future
developments of standard anesthesia monitor.

1.4

Project Motivation and Goals

My clinical observation leads to an intuition that this phenomenon arises from the inner physiologic dynamics under surgery and anesthesia. Hence, the quantification could
provide valuable information to help anesthesiologists in administering anesthetics.
Pursuing these questions involves model construction based on knowledge of three distinct
fields: signal processing, clinical anesthesiology and physiology. Then, I will propose
a quantitative index, referred to as “non-rhythmic-to-rhythmic ratio”(NRR) to quantify
the phenomenon. The computation of NRR index requires multitaper Synchrosqueezing
transform, a recently developed time-frequency analysis technique.

Chapter 1. Introduction

3

I used a clinical database to explore the property of NRR index. Meanwhile, NRR index
was compared with standard depth-of-anesthesia indices used in current clinical practicing
to understand its performance.

1.5

Thesis Outline

My thesis will begin with a literature review of the clinical anesthesiology, neural physiology, and time-frequency analysis. Bringing multidisciplinary knowledge up to date leads to
a theory for the possible mechanism of rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon. I proposed
a model as the foundation of further analysis using time-frequency analysis. The adaptive
harmonic model is compatible in both ways: fitting the descriptive property in physiology, and providing adequate mathematical conditions for the quantification. Based on the
adaptive harmonic model and multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform, NRR index was
developed to quantify rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon. I used a clinical database
to analyze the behavior of NRR index, and compare it with other current standard indices
of anesthetic depth. The statistical result shows positive value in clinical: NRR index
provides information regarding motor reaction earlier and better than all the other depthof-anesthesia indices. The result suggests a possible anatomic area and functional part
in the brain that mediate the rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon. To benefit each
individual patient undergoing surgery and anesthesia, NRR index should be implemented
in real-time. An optimal spline interpolation technique is proposed for the development
of “real-time NRR index”.

Background and Previous Work
2.1

Historical Background in Anesthesia

More than seventy years ago, Guedel made a remark on the connection between anesthesia
and respiratory patterns[1]. It appears that there is a direct relation between anesthetic
depth and respiratory patterns. A deeper level of anesthesia results in regular respiratory
patterns while a lighter level of anesthesia results in irregular respiratory patterns. During that era, depth of anesthesia were concluded from physical signs, such as the changes
in pupil size and movement of the eyeballs. However, the introduction of muscle relaxant in clinical anesthesia has hindered the observation of muscle movement and Guedel’s
assessment method.
Even though Guedel’s observations became less known, this “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
phenomenon has been documented in other literature. About twenty years ago, Kato used
power spectrum to analyze IHR in anesthesia[2]. His study showed that the spectrum
appears to be concentrated during deeper level of anesthesia; whereas the spectrum is
dispersing in lighter level of anesthesia. Kato also mentioned the respiratory effect on
this phenomenon. It is possible that the power spectrum technique helps to capture the
obscure phenomenon in IHR at that era.

2.2

Current View on Anesthesia

Today, we would like to further explain this phenomenon through the advancement of
various scientific fields in signal processing, anesthesiology, and neural physiology.
Because of the advancement in anesthesiology, we now understand that anesthetics exert
effect mainly on the brain. Distinct anatomic location mediates different functions, with

differential susceptibility to same anesthetics. Furthermore, each patient has his own
unique genetic profile that renders diverse response to anesthetics. The inter-individual
genetic variability, plus the dynamic influence of surgical procedure, make it difficult to
determine appropriate anesthetic levels based on the dosage of anesthetics or single index
of anesthetic depth. There is strong evidence that anesthetic management can improve the
long-term health of patients, it is important to have monitoring instruments facilitating
a comprehensive anesthetic management specific for each unique patient. Hence, the
quantification of “rhythmic-to-nonrhythmic” phenomenon should be worthwhile.
Current advancements in signal processing has resulted in the development of time-frequency
analysis. In particular, reassignment and Synchrosqueezing technique were not readily accessible in the past. Furthermore, current advancements in neural physiology has also
provided more insight into the underlying mechanism of the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
phenomenon, which has not been addressed according to my best knowledge. A more
detail literature review regarding three main disciplines is as follows.

2.3

Perspective from Anesthesiology

Anesthesia comprises several components, including hypnosis, analgesia, immobility, amnesia, and autonomic nerve system stability[3–6]. For each patient, the dosage for different
anesthetics is tailored to the patient’s specific surgical needs. Therefore, anesthesiologists
need to continuously monitor the patient’s response to the anesthesia. Bispectral Index®
(BIS), an index computed from electroencephalography(EEG), is the current standard
tools used to monitor depth-of-anesthesia for either the hypnotic component or the level
of sleepiness. However, analgesia component, commonly known as the inhibition of pain
sensation in anesthesia, requires an indirect interpretation of physiologic information such
as heart rate (HR) and blood pressure[7–11]. It is impossible to achieve optimal anesthesia using only one kind of anesthetics. Also, anesthesiologists are unable to monitor the
depth of anesthesia by using merely one index, consequently inadequately measuring anesthetic effects. For a more comprehensive administration of anesthesia, it may be helpful
to integrate different types of information to come to a decision.
It is important to understand what is wrong with simply relying on BIS monitor. BIS is
a processed EEG, which measures the activity of the frontal cortical area only. On the
other hand, amnesia is the suppression of memory, which is governed by medial temporal
cortical area. Analgesia is the suppression of pain sensation, which is governed by various
subcortical areas. Immobility is the inability of movement which is typically controlled
by the thalamus and spinal cord[7, 12, 13]. Lastly, the entire autonomic nerve system is
controlled by the brainstem[14–16]. Although BIS index is the current gold standard of

Chapter 2. Background

6

anesthetic depth monitor, BIS sensor is unable to measure the activities from all above
listed anatomical areas except the frontal cortex. Literature in recent years indicates that
anesthetics exert differential effects on different brain areas[3, 7, 17]. Thus, there is a
considerable risk measuring frontal cortex to conclude the anesthetic effect on other brain
areas. For example, researchers have reported that the BIS monitor cannot reduce the rate
of intra-operative awareness, which requires adequate memory function suppression[18].

2.4

Anesthesia and Long-Term Mortality

Anesthesia is more than merely falling asleep. Evidences support the connection between
anesthesia and long-term mortality. Too deep of hypnotic index (BIS index) for too long
in surgery is associated with worse one-year mortality[19]. It has also been reported that
different anesthetics cause different immune responses, which affect tumor metastasis[20].
Evidence suggests incorporating “stress reduction” strategy into anesthetic management
leads to longer life expectancy. First, infants who needed surgery for their congenital
heart disease had lower long term mortality rate if they received adequate analgesics[21].
Second, more adult patients who underwent major surgeries survived one year later if they
receive adequate medication to stabilize autonomic nerve system[22, 23]. Lastly, when
epidural anesthesia, a regional anesthesia technique, is combined with general anesthesia
for patients undergoing major surgeries, studies have showed that epidural anesthesia
reduces stress and pain, leads to faster recovery, and overall better outcome[24]. There
are more compelling studies that support the benefit of anesthesia management on long
term outcome. These evidences suggest that a comprehensive optimization of anesthesia
is worthwhile.
In summary, anesthesia comprises several components. A comprehensive anesthesia management that covers several components could benefit patient for many years. Liteurature
survey also brings hope that quantitative analysis of “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon could be useful to monitor the anesthetic effect on subcortical regions.

2.5

Perspective from Physiology

From a physiological perspective, the underlying mechanism of the “rhythmic-to-nonrhythmic” phenomenon could be partially explained by breathing mechanism and cardiopulmonary coupling[14]. It is known that the neural respiratory control comprises of
two systems, 1) the involuntary automatic control system and 2) the voluntary control
system. The involuntary automatic control system is controlled by the respiratory center

Chapter 2. Background

7

in the brainstem. The voluntary control system is controlled by the forebrain[25]. The
anatomies of these two systems are distinct from one another. The respiratory neural
signals from these two systems compete with each other but are both integrated at the
spinal cord to control the respiratory motor neuron. During spontaneous respiration, the
involuntary automatic respiratory pattern generated in the preBötzinger complex [25–29],
is rhythmic. On the contrary, the breathing pattern of the voluntary respiratory motor
control is non-rhythmic, which involves larger cerebral areas, including cortical processing
and thalamic integration[25, 30–34].
The suppression effect of anesthetics on the forebrain, including the cortex and the thalamus, is stronger than that on the brainstem[35]. Meanwhile, studies have shown that
the preBötzinger complex, the involuntary respiratory control center, is less susceptible
to the anesthetics[36, 37]. These relations suggest that under deeper level of anesthesia,
the non-rhythmic respiratory is more suppressed than the rhythmic respiratory center.
Hence, the IHR exhibits oscillation that is more rhythmic during deeper anesthetic level.
Contrarily, the non-rhythmic respiratory center, being less suppressed during lighter level
of anesthesia, causes activity more non-rhythmic in IHR. This concludes that IHR exhibits
more nonr-hythmic. In summary, literature in physiology supports the correlation that
the differential anesthetic effects between the involuntary control system and voluntary
control system induces the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in IHR.
Thus, I hypothesize that IHR exhibits the central respiratory activity via cardiopulmonary
effect[14], and it reflects the integration of rhythmic and non-rhythmic respiratory activities. Although more evidence is necessary to clarify this hypothesis, I propose using the
NRR quantification methodology as a potential tool to evaluate the depth of anesthesia
from a different aspect than using EEG-based monitoring.

2.6

Physiology of Amplitude and Frequency Modulation

The human body constantly regulates the respiration to meet the requirement of metabolism.
In other words, the human body has to inhale oxygen (O2 ), and expel carbon dioxide (CO2 )
adequately. The respiratory control center in the brainstem receives the feedback information of oxygen concentration and the acidity to modulates the volume and the rate of
breath. The acidity is due to the fact that CO2 exists as hydrogen ion (H+ ) and carbonic
acid in human body[16, 38].
Since CO2 are the metabolic products of human body, the H+ concentration and O2
concentration in the human body are gradually, but consistently, changing. Thus, we
can describe that the respiration signal in the brainstem is oscillatory with amplitude

Chapter 2. Background

8

modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). The AM and FM are continuous and
slow change in time. These physiologic features can be depicted in mathematical language
for subsequent modeling and quantification in the next chapter.
In summary, literature from physiology supports an integrated rhythmic and non-rhythmic
neural activity reflecting the level of anesthesia. From a clinical anesthesiology perspective,
technological advancements on monitoring various aspects of anesthetic depth can help
improve the quality of overall patient care.

2.7

Instantaneous Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability

Figure 2.1: A schematic diagram for the R-R interval (RRI) signal derived from the
raw lead III electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. We refer to RRI signal as instantaneous
heart rate. The diagram also showed the ECG-derived respiration (EDR)

The term heart rate is important to all anesthesiologists and is usually referred to as the
number of heartbeats within one minute. To an anesthesiologist, an ongoing heart rate
indicates the stability of the heart condition, or the stress responses to surgical stimulation.
The heart rate is mainly controlled by both sympathetic nerve and parasympathetic nerve
system from the brainstem to the heart[16]. Due to the dynamic nature of patient’s under
surgery and anesthesia, we do not feel comfortable with the heart rate information at
an one-minute interval. Instead, a standard requirement in anesthesia practice includes
a continuous real-time display of the heart rate. In this thesis, the “rhythmic-to-nonrhythmic” phenomenon is only observable at the instantaneous level. Conversely, the

Chapter 2. Background

9

average heart rate of a normal routine excludes the information of “rhythmic-to-nonrhythmic” phenomenon.
Both the Instantaneous heart rate (IHR) and ECG derived respiration (EDR),(Fig.2.1) can
be derived from the raw ECG waveform[39–41]. Although we can say that the “rhythmicto-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in IHR is a kind of “generalized” heart rate variability
(HRV), a medical guideline has set up the standard method of HRV analysis[42]. Unfortunately, the standard analysis techniques stated in this guideline cannot reveal the
information of the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon. In particular, the SDNNx,
pNNx or the power spectrum technique measures information in a specified period, which
inevitably neglects the dynamic and transient changes within this period. The guideline
discusses but does not resolve the potential issue of stationarity in the data. This also
supports my desire to rely on the current scientific advancements on signal processes to
resolve the current medical shortcomings in my project.

2.8

Integration of Multidisciplinary Backgrounds

Integration of multidisciplinary backgrounds provides partially theoretical background for
the mechanism of “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon. Below is a list of key facts
from various disciplines:

1. In respiratory control, non-rhythmic activity originates from the forebrain, whereas
rhythmic activity originates from the brainstem.
2. The forebrain has far more neurons and synapses when compared to the brainstem.
3. Neural structures with more synapses are more susceptible to anesthetics
4. Respiration have an coupling effect on IHR

Fact 1 and 2 are knowledge in neurology and neural anatomy. Fact 3 is from anesthesiology,
and fact 4 is physiology knowledge. Each single fact seems ordinary when considered in
its own disciplines. However, when I combine them together, the theoretical ground is
justified. Then, we can proceed to the modeling problem in the next chapter.

Chapter 3

Theory and Modeling
3.1

Proposal

The “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in IHR[2, 43] suggests that IHR during
anesthesia consists of two components: one more rhythmic, less affected by anesthesia,
and one more non-rhythmic, suppressed by deep anesthesia, and the strength of these two
components vary according to the anesthesia depth.
I hypothesize that quantifying the ”rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon will reflect
the level of anesthesia. In order to quantify this change in IHR, I will introduce a novel
index which I referred to as Non-rhythmic to Rhythmic Ratio (NRR) index.

3.2

Description of Proposed Methodology

My hypothesis will be tested through a four step method. I will capture the changes in
rhythm through IHR using the adaptive harmonic model. Next, I will use the multitaper
Synchrosqueezing transform to extract the dynamic behavior from the ECG signals. In
order to quantify “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon, I will use the NRR index.
Lastly, I will use a clinical database to compare the NRR index with other anesthetic
depth indices.

3.3

Adaptive Harmonic Model

It is important to consider which appropriate model to utilize to adequately describe
and quantify this rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon. Specifically, it is important
10

Chapter 3. Modeling

11

to recall the high difficulty on describing the inner dynamic of the human body through
mathematical formulas. This difficulty is due to the fact that the human body is a complex
system creating non-linear and unpredictable interactions with the outer environment. The
drastic influences of surgery and anesthetic medication complicates the difficulty further.
It is fairly simple to ruin the capability of a model to describe the reality by imposing
unrealistic conditions. That is the most challenging task currently at hand when we try to
model the biological phenomenon of our study. In order to do so we have to be extremely
cautious on what conditions we choose and impose on our study model.
After careful observation from a time-varying spectrum, I propose a relatively conservative
model to analyze the rhythmic part of IHR. As is shown in Fig.1.1, the definition of
rhythmic implies that the oscillation exhibits time-varying frequency and time-varying
amplitude. However, the modulations are in a relatively slow rate. This presents the notion
that the relative predictable oscillatory activity can be perceived as a rhythmic movement.
Hence, a more conservative phenomenological modeling, also known as adaptive harmonic
model, will be proposed as follows.
The adaptive model integrates with the Synchrosqueezing transform creating a whole new
scheme starting from the theoretical grounds to the clinical phenomenon. We start from
motivating the technical model we consider to analyze IHR(t). It is commonly observed in
clinical settings that stronger anesthetic levels are associated with more regular patterns
in the instantaneous heart rate IHR(t), which is caused by the cardiopulmonary coupling
effect under anesthesia [2, 43]. Based on this major observation, our treatment of the
IHR(t) signal will be purely phenomenological; that is, the parameters and indices we will
derive from the IHR(t) signal will be based solely on these signals themselves, and not
on explicit, quantitative models of the underlying mechanisms. Since we mainly extract
IHR from ECG signal as RRI, we will consider the following phenomenological model for
RRI(t):
RRI(t) = T (t) + A(t) cos(2πφ(t)),

(3.1)

where T (t) > 0, A(t) > 0 and φ0 (t) > 0. We call T (t) the trend, which captures the
“average heart rate” over a long period; we require the trend to be positive, but not to
be constant; we allow it to vary in time, as long as the variations are small enough. We
call the derivative φ0 (t) of the function φ(t) the instantaneous frequency (IF) of RRI(t);
we require IF to be positive, but not to be constant; we allow it to vary in time, as long
as the variations are slight from one period to the next, i.e. |φ00 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t) for all time t,
where  is some small, pre-assigned positive number. Likewise, We call A(t) the amplitude
modulation (AM) of R(t), which should be positive and smaller than T (t), but is allowed to
vary slightly as well, i.e. |A0 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t) for all time t. In summary, we have the following

Chapter 3. Modeling

12

conditions for the model 3.1 [44, 45]:
0 < A(t) < T (t), φ0 (t) > 0,
|A0 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t), |φ00 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t), |T 0 (t)| ≤  for all t.

(3.2)
(3.3)

If a RRI signal satisfied the model (3.1), we call it rhythmic; otherwise we call it nonrhythmic. It is possible that a function can be composed of both the rhythmic and nonrhythmic components.
This seeming complicated model is actually a direct generalization of the Fourier harmonic
model [44, 45]. Close inspecting the waveform of IHR, we can see that the conditions on
φ00 (t) and |A0 (t)| are reasonable. In other words, the rhythmic RRI exhibits an oscillation with “small enough” frequency modulation and amplitude modulation. Without
adequate knowledge of underlying mechanism, the adaptive harmonic model fulfills the
phenomenological behavior of rhythmicity feature.

3.4

Non-rhythmic to Rhythmic Ratio

The amount of variance inside the RRI signal are known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
HRV has been proven to be closely related to the autonomic activity [42]. The most
commonly used tool to quantify HRV is the power spectrum (PS) [42]. As useful as the
PS is, however, in this study the PS cannot capture the momentary dynamics in the RRI
time series. This issue limits the application to human under highly dynamic situation
– in particular, the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in anesthesia. The main
technical focus of this paper is to resolve this limitation.
In this paper I will quantify the rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic pattern of the RRI series by using a novel index referred to as Non-rhythmic to Rhythmic Ratio (NRR). NRR is motivated
by the clinical finding that deeper anesthetic levels are associated with the appearance of
more regular oscillatory patterns in IHR. Thus, under deeper anesthesia, IHR oscillates
more regularly. We call this regular oscillatory IHR “rhythmic”, which appears as a sharp
peak on the PS. On the other hand, when the subject is under lighter anesthesia, IHR
varies irregularly, and we call this IHR “non-rhythmic”. The non-rhythmic IHR exhibits
irregular and random-like behavior that appears as a plateau on the PS. As a result from
this observation, the RRI time series is composed of a non-rhythmic component and a
rhythmic component with various ratios. Based on the above facts, we hypothesize that
the time-varying ratio change of the non-rhythmic and rhythmic components may reflect
the anesthetic effect on the brain.

Chapter 3. Modeling

13

To quantify the ratio of the rhythmic component and non-rhythmic component, we will use
a new signal processing tool to fully capture the momentary RRI time series change. We
will replace the PS with the time-varying power spectrum (tvPS) by applying a recently
developed time-frequency analysis technique [43, 46], which is referred to as multitaper
Synchrosqueezing transform [44, 45, 47]. The tvPS is a non-parametric generalization
of the PS providing instantaneous PS information. We will then be able to trace the
momentary strength of the rhythmic component and non-rhythmic component through
analyzing the tvPS.
By using the tvPS we will further extend the definition of the classical frequency domains HRV parameters. Recall that traditionally, the high frequency (HF) power, the low
frequency (LF) power, and the low frequency to high frequency power ratio (LHR), are
determined from the PS of the RRI time series. Vagal activity mainly contributes to HF
power, meanwhile, sympathetic activity influences both LF power and LHR [42, 48]. By
using the tvPS of RRI, we are able to obtain time-varying HRV parameters, including the
time-varying high frequency power (tvHF), the time-varying low frequency power (tvLF)
and the time-varying low frequency to high frequency power ratio (tvLHR). All these parameters are suitable to provide a better understanding of the dynamical situations of
anesthesia.
The main index NRR is defined as the ratio between momentary non-rhythmic power to
momentary rhythmic power. In mathematical terms, we compute the rhythmic component
power by identifying the location of peak on tvPS. The non-rhythmic power is then defined
as tvHF subtracted by the momentary rhythmic power. Finally, NRR is defined as

NRR = log10

Non-rhythmic power
Rhythmic power


,

where the value of NRR is high with non-rhythmic RRI and the value of NRR is low with
rhythmic RRI. As previously discussed, the dynamical behavior of RRI(t) is captured by
tvPS. Please see Figure 3.1
In practical calculation, the non-rhythmic power is calculated as the rhythmic power subtracted from the high frequency power of RRI. The rhythmic component power is calculated as the sum of the power near the IF of the rhythmic component within the range
of high frequency on the tvPS. We define the IF of the rhythmic component, denoted as
fr (t), as the time varying position of the maximal power within the high frequency range
on the tvPS of RRI(t):
fr (t) := argmax MRRI,K (t, ξ),
0.1≤ξ≤1

(3.4)

interval (RRI), ECG-derived respiration (EDR), and the corresponding spectra in lighter
level of anesthesia (A, B, C) and deeper level of anesthesia (D, E, F). Whether in lighter
(A) or deeper level of anesthesia (D), it is hard to read the IHR information from raw
ECG waveform by naked eyes. Time tracings (B, E) of RRI and EDR and their power
spectra (C, F) show that RRI is more non-rhythmic in lighter level of anesthesia then in
deeper level. The frequency bands around the instantaneous frequency f r and its multiple
frequencies (the unshaded area) constitute the rhythmic component. The rest (shaded
area) constitutes the non-rhythmic component. dB = decibel

14

Chapter 3. Modeling

15

which is implemented by the curve extraction algorithm considered in [49]. Next, we will
calculate the rhythmic component power, denoted as Pr (t), as the sum of the power inside
the bands around fr (t) on the tvPS of RRI(t). In particular,
Z

nfr (t)+0.01Hz

MRRI,K (t, ξ)dξ.

Pr (t) :=
nfr (t)−0.01Hz

Here the width of the band is chosen to be 0.01Hz in an ad hoc way. We mention that when
the signal is of broadband spectrum, there is no dominant curve that can be visualized,
as shown in Fig.3.1. In this case, the most dominant curve defined in (3.4) from the
time-frequency representation is viewed as the rhythmic component.
The non-rhythmic component power is defined as the power within the high frequency
subtracted by the rhythmic component power. Lastly, NRR is defined intuitively as the
ratio of the non-rhythmic component power to the rhythmic component power:

NRR(t) = log10

tvHF(t) − Pr (t)
Pr (t)


.

Through defining power within absolute boundary as Pr (t), NRR can differentiate the level
between “rhythmic” and “non-rhythmic”. In this thesis, the variables affixing (t) mean
that they are functions of time. It is important to notice that these sorts of time-varying
parameters describe the momentary behavior of the signal. Since this instantaneous information cannot be captured by the classical power spectral analysis, we would expect to
gain more insight into the IHR signal by considering our definitions.

3.5

Non-rhythmic Component vs. Stochastic Process

For the purpose of this thesis, the term non-rhythmic is defined as any signal that appears
“irregular”, “noisy”, or “as random”. This poses two interesting questions. First, does
this mean that we should treat all non-rhythmic signals as a stochastic process? Second,
will we be able to model the non-rhythmic signal as an auto-regressive moving-average
(ARMA) model or other stochastic process in order to analyze it using parametric methods? However, I would like to also remind that we should consider these issues using our
medical knowledge.
One of my hypotheses in the present study is that the non-rhythmic signal reflects highly
structured and complex activity of the human brain. Although it is too early to determine
that the human brain is a “deterministic” or “stochastic” system, when awake, the human
brain can retain memory for longer periods of time to execute complex tasks. The thought
or idea in the brain lasts longer too. Therefore, the brain exhibits non-rhythmic activity

Chapter 3. Modeling

16

when its inner state is longer lasting. However, the above statements would contradict the
stochastic process behavior that presents no memory effect in a Gaussian random process.
That is, the autocorrelation function is a Dirac’s delta function:

Ryy (l) =

X

y(n)ȳ(n − l),

l∈Z

E[RRyy (0)] = σ and E[RRyy (k)] = 0 for k > 0 when y is a Gaussian process.
Although non-rhythmic signals may appear similar to a stochastic process, the human
brain that shows non-rhythmic activities should result in a more structured state. Therefore, a non-rhythmic signal in its natural state is not completely “stochastic”. This is why
I would like to use the term ”non-rhythmic”.
My second hypothesis is that there are two components, non-rhythmic and rhythmic,
that are contained in the ”rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon. It is unknown how
these two components coexist but one simple way to model their co-existence would be
superposition. Regardless if we fully understand how the two components coexist, the fact
that stochastic process is fundamentally a “white-noise-driven” process means it doesn’t
match the “rhythmic component plus non-rhythmic component” concept.
The above technical issues regarding parametric modeling for “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
phenomenon needs to be carefully addressed in the future work. To narrow down the
problems I have to solve in my thesis, I decided to choose a non-parametric method as
a starting point. Still, statistical signal processing technique is a viable direction for my
future studies.

3.6

Summary

In summary, the proposed adaptive harmonic model (3.2) describes a fundamental physiologic property: the rhythmic component possesses frequency modulation and amplitude
modulation. However, the law of physiology and chemistry sets a limit to these modulations.
From the previously mentioned theory to the modeling and quantification of the NRR
index, I keep seeking the time-varying ability to capture the momentary dynamics, which
is essential to the dynamic nature of clinical anesthesia. This feature is also fundamentally
distinct to theories of other signal analysis methods. After establishing the theoretic part,
I will focus on the next problem: the time-varying spectrum.

Chapter 4

Time-Frequency Analysis,
Reassignment, and
Synchrosqueezing
4.1

Time-Frequency Analysis

Chapter 3 provided strong evidence that in order to execute the quantification of NRR
index within anesthesia the adaptive harmonic model requires a strong time-varying spectrum. A recently developed time-frequency analysis technique is called the multitaper
Synchrosqueezing transform. I believe that this technique is the most useful for my proposed study.
Time-frequency analysis is a type of signal processing tool that generalizes the power
spectrum to provide time-varying ability. This type of analysis generates a series of power
spectra that has the ability to represent instantaneous spectra. Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) are two types of well known tools
for biomedical signal analysis[43, 50–53]. Both of these tools are able to capture the instantaneous frequency information of the biological signal. Huang and Chan were the first to
employ time-frequency analysis to analyze the dynamic changes in IHR during anesthesia
[46].
Both STFT and CWT require window functions to “focus” or “localize” the signal. Take
STFT as example:

(h)
VX (t, ξ)

Z

∞

=

X(s)h(t − s)e−i2πξs ds

−∞

17

(4.1)

Chapter 4. Synchrosqueezing Transform

18

where h is a window function chosen by the user, for example, the Gaussian function
2

h(t) = e−t . Note that X(τ )h(t − τ ) is the piece of signal around t chosen by the window
function. We then define the spectrogram of X(t) [50] as

2
 (h)
(h)
GX (t, ξ) = VX (t, ξ) .

(4.2)

From equation 4.1, it is apparent that choosing different window functions causes different
results. The influence of the chosen window function in relation to the STFT is no less
than the signal per se. In particular, the window function imposes a resolution limit which
relates to the well-known Heisenberg’s uncertainty principal. The larger the time window
h is, the higher the spectrum resolution is, but with low temporal resolution, and vise
versa.
The window function also influences other TF methods, such as CWT, and Smoothed
Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution, to name a few. Rather than fiddling with various TF
methods, various window functions, and different sizes, it is highly advised to choose a
technique that alleviates the above issues.

4.2

Reassignment

To cope with the resolution limitation of time-frequency analysis, it is possible to further
use the phase information ϕ(t, ξ), which is discarded in the classical STFT spectrogram
(4.2) and scalogram[50, 51]. Kodera et al. first proposed this technique[54] by calculating
the instantaneous frequency ∂t ϕ(t, ξ) and group delay ∂ξ ϕ(t, ξ). Auger and Flandrin coined
this technique as the reassignment and further generalized it to “Fourier transform based”
time-frequency analysis[50]. The reassignment technique provides a sharper representation, which improves the readability of the STFT spectrogram. Reassignment is helpful
in visualizing the dynamics of the biological signal that contains multiple nonstationary
components in the TF plane (Fig. 4.1).
The phase information hidden in STFT contains information that explains why timefrequency domains are spreaded out.[55]. To further eliminate this issue, we can shift the
STFT coefficients accordingly to the reassignment rules determined by the phase information. The temporal reassignment rule and frequency reassignment rule are as follows:

The reassigned spectrogram is a valuable tool for signals that contain dynamic information
of anesthesia in my current study[43]. However, aside from the visual information represented in the TF plane, it is also desirable to execute further analysis of the signals, such
as isolating a component in TF plane, or performing reconstruction in time domain. Synchrosqueezing transform is a recently developed reassignment technique that can provide
this possibility.

4.3

Synchrosqueezing Transform

Synchrosqueezing transform is a special kind of reassignment technique[44, 45, 56]. This
technique uses a light-weight mathematical model (4.5). The light-weight mathematical
model helps with further processing of signals, such as isolating a component in the TF
plane or reconstruction in time domain.
For my present study, Synchrosqueezing transform can be used to present non-parametric
generalizations of the power spectrum. The Synchrosqueezing transform is able to provide
the time-varying power spectrum (tvPS) which reveals the instantaneous changes that
happen in IHR. In addition, comparing with traditional STFT and wavelet, it is visually
more informative, more resistant to several kind of noise, and more resistant to the influence of chosen window function [44, 45, 49]. Mathematical works have supported these
abilities, as well as the ability of inverse transform. Luckily we do not need to impose too

is superimposed as red line in panel B

much effort on choosing parameters as using the Synchrosqueezing transform technique
can easily capture the oscillatory activity.
The detailed information on the algorithm leading to tvPS is as follows. It has been known
that the phase information hidden in STFT contains more information that explains why
the STFT spectrogram is spreaded out. A solution that could help remedy this issue is by
shifting the STFT coefficients according to reassignment rules determined by the phase
information. The frequency reassignment rule is as follows:

22

(h)

Ω(t, ξ) :=

−i∂t VX (t, ξ)

(4.3)

(h)

2πVX (t, ξ)
where ∂t means the partial derivative with related to t. The Synchrosqueezing transform
is then achieved by applying the reassignment rule:

(h)

where for each fixed time t, we move the STFT coefficient VX (t, η) at frequency η to a
new location according to the reassignment rules Ω(t, ξ).
One way that the Synchrosqueezing transform is unique to the reassignment technique
is that the Synchrosqueezing transform has the ability to reconstruct back to the time
domain. Suppose the signal X(t) analyzed by Synchrosqueezing transform is:

X(t) = T (t) + A(t) cos(2πφ(t)),

(4.4)

where T (t) > 0, A(t) > 0 and φ0 (t) > 0.
In other words, X(t) comprises of an oscillatory component and a trend component.
In addition, the amplitude modulation and frequency modulation of the oscillatory component is under the condition as follows:
0 < A(t) < T (t), φ0 (t) > 0,
|A0 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t), |φ00 (t)| ≤ φ0 (t), |T (t)0 | ≤  for all t.

Relevant results of the Synchrosqueezing transform can be found in literatures[49, 57–
60]. A recent review article discussed in depth on the relation of the TF analysis, the
reassignment and Synchrosqueezing technique[61].

Multitaper Estimation

From a non-parametric spectral estimation perspective, Thompson proposed a powerful
multi-window technique that improves spectral estimation of the random process[62, 63].
Thompson uses the discrete prolate Spheroidal sequence to define a series of window function, which are orthogonal to each other, that have the same length in time domain.
The average of the spectra from multiple windows reduces the spectrum variance but
also prevents the bias of spectral estimation induced by varying window size. One strong

Chapter 4. Synchrosqueezing Transform

23

advantage of Thompson’s spectrum is that we are able to estimate the spectrum of a
stationary random process without resort to parametric estimations.
The principle of Thompson’s technique has been extended to the field of nonstationary
signal. Multitaper in time-frequency analysis is designed to be used with Hermite functions
as the sequence of multiple windows that are orthogonal to each other in time-frequency
plane. The final spectrogram estimation can then be obtained from the average of multiple
realizations. Taking the STFT spectrogram as an example, the multitaper spectrogram
can be defined as follows:
2

K

1 X


(hk )
VX (t, ξ) .
QX,K (t, ξ) := 

K
k=1

The multitaper spectrogram and multitaper scalogram were shown to make success for
nonstationary stochastic signal[64]. To achieve both high resolution for deterministic nonstationary signal and low variance for stochastic nonstationary signal, Xiao and Flandrin
combined the reassignment technique and multitaper technique[47].
From the background information mentioned in Chapter 2 and the model in Chapter 3, it
can be seen that the IHR under anesthesia should contains both non-stationary component
and stochastic component. We have reported the advantage of using multitaper timefrequency reassignment in extracting these dynamic features[43].

4.5

Multitaper Synchrosqueezing Spectrogram

Synchrosqueezing transform responds well to signals from different types of stochastic
process. One dilemma we face is understanding the true mechanism in biological signal.
Since the quantification of the non-rhythmic component is an important part of our current
model(3.4), we have decided to apply the multitaper method to further optimize the
performance of the Synchrosqueezing transform X(t). We have chosen the multitaper
Synchrosqueezing spectrogram to achieve the tvPS as follows:
2

K

1 X


(h )
SX k (t, ξ) ,
MX,K (t, ξ) := 

K
k=1

where K > 0 is the number of windows chosen. We choose the the k-th Hermite function
as hk . For my current study, I will use K = 10 and the first ten Hermite window functions
will be hk , k = 1, . . . , 10 when deriving tvPS.

Figure 4.3: The time-varying power spectrum of instantaneous heart rate (IHR) as data
used in figure 4.2, realized by multitaper Synchrosqueezing spectrogram, showing rich
dynamic features of human body in anesthesia. As shown in figure 4.2, the readability is
better than STFT spectrogram, and also better than the reassigned spectrogram.

The advantage of using a multitaper Synchrosqueezing spectrogram is summarized as
follows:

1. Robust to several different kinds of noise, which might be slightly nonstationary.
2. Visually informative. When the signal is rhythmic, that is, satisfying the model (3.1),
a dominant curve following the IF can be seen on the multitaper Synchrosqueezing
spectrogram; otherwise the multitaper Synchrosqueezing spectrogram is blurred.
3. Adaptive to the data so that its dependence on the chosen window function is weak.

We compared various methods of TF analysis in Table4.1 and in simulated data analysis(Fig.4.4).

4.6

Adaptive Filter and Parametric Estimation

Another kind of techniques based on parametric modeling for time series data analysis
is the adaptive filter, including the famous Kalman filter, and the parametric spectral
estimation[65]. The adaptive filter is designed to use a cost function to represent the
weighted mean square error. The goal is finding a set of parameters ai to minimize the
cost function.
ai = argmin E{e2 [n]}

Figure 4.4: An artificial data, as a summation of two time-varying components and
a Gaussian white noise, and its TF analysis realized by STFT spectrogram, Synchrosqueezed spectrogram and the multitaper Synchrosqueezed spectrogram. From 125 s
to 250 s, it is apparent that Synchrosqueezing technique improves the readability of the
two components, and multitaper technique refines further.

If we have adequate knowledge about the signal, we can obtain the optimal point on the
performance surface of the cost function by using partial differential.
∂
E{e2 [n]} = 0
∂ai
It is apparent that TF reassignment is fundamentally different from adaptive filter. TF
reassignment is a non-parametric deterministic signal processing technique, whereas the
adaptive filter is a parametric technique for stochastic signal processing. Regardless of the
difference, both techniques use the same mathematical tools to achieve their goals.
Kalman filter in essence is a real-time prediction-correction algorithm that provides parametric estimation in the sense of weighted least-square fitting[62, 65]. As the physiologic
mechanism underlying rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon is not adequately understood, a technique which requires both elaborate model construction and careful parameter selection is not my first-line choice for my research problem. Besides, From Chapter 3,
it shows that the NRR index has a high relation to oscillation. Therefore, for my study,

the output of the Kalman filter as a matrix of state variables may not be as intuitive as
the spectrum technique for data exploration and interpretation at this stage.
Parametric spectral estimation has a complete theory of modeling based on stochastic
process[62]. One critical issue of the parametric estimation is that the mechanism of the
signal we are facing in the present study is unknown, and is constantly changing. The parametric spectral estimation has a lower tolerance to incorrect modeling. In other words, it is
crucial to ensure that the correct model are constructed to generate reasonable parametric
spectral estimation. In addition, parametric spectral estimation does not behave well when
the signal is a superposition of multiple components. The rigidity of model construction
contrasts well with the flexibility of Synchrosqueezing: flexible in window selection and
adaptive to signal. Certainly, it is possible that the technique realizing time-varying power
spectrum in the future may belong to the family of parametric spectrum.

4.7

Common Condition in Physiology and Mathematics

The most unique characteristic of the Synchrosqueezing transform that is relevant to this
project is the mathematical condition 3.2 which shows that the frequecy modulation and
amplitude modulation are limited. The condition used on the Synchrosqueezing transform
is exactly the same condition as the adaptive harmonic model in order to describe this
rhythmic physiological behavior. Therefore, the Synchrosqueezing transform matches perfectly with the adaptive harmonic model for us to quantify the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
phenomenon that was previously discussed.

Performance Evaluation using
Clinical Data
5.1

Clinical Database

In my hopes to investigate the clinical value of NRR index, I have collected and analyzed
a clinical database. The prospective observational study spanned the whole period of
typical surgical anesthesia. ECG, BIS index, and the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane
were all recorded continuously. Anesthetic events, including loss of consciousness (LOC),
skin incision, first reaction of motor movement during emergence period, and return of
consciousness (ROC), were registered with precise time stamps.
After receiving approval from the Institutional Review Board (Taipei Veterans General
Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan), we enrolled 31 female patients. All patients were American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I or II and were scheduled for laparoscopic gynecological surgery undergoing general anesthesia. We obtained informed
consent in paper from each of our patients. All ASA I or II status patients are generally
under healthy conditions. It is important to investigate the changes of the NRR index
under the normal physiological conditions. We are aware that some diseases can affect
HRV (and IHR) untowardly. Thus, patients that are excluded were those younger than 20
years old or older than 55 years old, have a body mass index below 19 or higher than 30
and have either cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia, intake of medication that affects the
neurological and cardiovascular system, potential cancer, diabetes mellitus, or anticipated
difficult airway. All these surgeries were performed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7
p.m.

Anesthesia Protocol

The standard anesthetic monitoring (HP agilent patient monitoring system) was applied to
all patients. This included ECG, pulse oximeter (SpO2 ) and non-invasive blood pressure. A
BIS electrode (BIS-XP sensor) and the ECG recorder (MyECG E3-80; Micro-Star Int’l Co.,
New Taipei City, Taiwan) were applied to the patients prior to anesthetic induction. After
the initial step of cleaning the skin with rubbing alcohol, the BIS sensor is applied to the
right side of the forehead. As a standard practice, all anesthetic managements, including
the administration of medications, and airway management were under the discretion of
the anesthesiologist. After intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution begins, we
started anesthetic induction with fentanyl 2.5 – 3 µg/kg. Next, right after preoxygenation,
hypnosis was induced with propofol 2 – 2.5 mg/kg. LOC was then assessed by no response
to verbal command. Cisatracurium 0.15mg/kg was used to facilitate tracheal intubation.
Subsequently, mechanical ventilation was started from volume control mode with oxygengas-sevoflurane mixture as low flow anesthesia. The respiratory rate and tidal volume of
the ventilator was adjusted to maintain an end-tidal carbon oxide (ETCO2 ) that ranges
between 35 and 40 mmHg, and to keep the peak airway pressure lower than 25 mm Hg.
The laparoscopic skin incision was made by a surgical blade. The adequacy of anesthetic
depth (during the whole period of surgery) was determined by the BIS index (< 60) and
based on the anesthesiologist’s judgment. If the anesthesiologist determined an inadequate
level of analgesia, a bolus dose of fentanyl would be given to the patient. Toward the end
of the surgery, the peritoneal gas was deflated and the patient’s body position recovered
from Trendelenburg’s position to level-supine position. As the wound closure began, the
anesthetic gas was on a consistent decrease. Muscle relaxation was reversed with a combination of neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg during controlled ventilation. Once the patient regained spontaneous breathing the controlled ventilation was
halted. Patients that exhibited inadequate spontaneous breathing (ETCO2 >50 mmHg
or SpO2 <95%) were assisted with manual positive ventilation, otherwise the patients
continued to breath spontaneously until regaining consciousness without the interference
of positive-pressure ventilation.ECG and BIS are the main electrophysiological signals we
analyze for this project. When we observed the emergence period, physical contact to
the patient was avoided and minimized if necessary to prevent the interference on the
sensors of ECG and BIS monitor. Any unnecessary interference to patient’s respiration
from the manual (bag) ventilation was avoided also. When the patient showed adequate
consistency in their spontaneous breathing, we removed the endotracheal tube. If in any
case there was inadequate ventilation or upper airway obstruction, corrective actions were
taken that include either mask ventilation or nasopharyngeal airway insertion. During the
emergence period, I carefully assessed first reaction as any first visible motor reaction such

Chapter 5. Performance Evaluation

29

as movement of the arms or legs, coughing, or grimace. ROC was assessed through the
patient’s ability to open their eyes and follow simple procedural commands.

5.3

Data Acquisition

The BIS index was continuously recorded from an Aspect A-2000 BIS monitor (version
XP, Host Rev:3.21, smoothing window: 15 seconds; Aspect Medical Systems, Nattick,
CA, USA) connected to a laptop computer (Asus Corp., Taipei, Taiwan). During surgery,
corrective measures were taken to improve signal quality of the BIS sensor when the signal
quality index was lower than 50; otherwise the BIS data during this period was discarded.
The raw limb lead ECG sampled at 1000Hz and 12-bit resolution, was recorded for off-line
analysis. The clocks on the laptop and ECG recorder were synchronized with a time accuracy of ±1 second. Time stamps of BIS record were provided by the laptop. The inhaled
and end-tidal concentrations of anesthetic gas, which was sampled from the connection
piece close to the endo-tracheal tube and detected by the gas analyzer on a Datex-Ohmeda
S/5 anesthesia machine (GE Health Care, Helsinki, Finland), were also recorded on the
laptop. All data was recorded without any interruption until the patient regained ROC. All
data collected for analysis of sevoflurane concentration correlation and anesthetic events,
including skin incision, first reaction and ROC, are under single ventilation mode. There
were no transitions from the mechanical ventilation to the spontaneous ventilation or vice
versa in the data. However, during LOC, the transition from the spontaneous ventilation
to mechanical ventilation is possible.
The offline ECG signal was analyzed in several steps. The R peak detection was automatically determined by taking lead I, II and III ECG signals into account to improve
accuracy. The ectopic beats were removed and interpolated from the data to eliminate
incorrect R peaks and ectopic beats through visual verification. When electrocauterization is severely interfered by the ECG, the data segment were also discarded. Whenever
electro-cauterization severely interfered the ECG, this data segment was discarded. IHR
was then derived from the R peaks through the cubic spline interpolation. RRI were
resampled to be equally spaced at 4 Hz from IHR for subsequent analyses (Fig.2.1).
In order to correct the hysteresis between the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration and the
anesthetic effect on the brain, the estimated effect-site sevoflurane concentration (Ceff )
was derived from the end-tidal sevoflurane concentration (Cet ) by the following first order
differential equation. This equation is based on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
modeling[66]:

Chapter 5. Performance Evaluation

dCeff
= Ke0 (Cet − Ceff )
dt
where the constant Ke0 was assumed to be constant for all patients and defined as 0.20
/min according to previous studies [8].

5.4

Statistical Analysis

We treated BIS and ECG-derived continuous indices, including NRR, tvHF, tvLF, tvLHR
and HR, as anesthetic depth indices. The performances of the indices were evaluated in two
ways: the ability for these indices to predict anesthetic events and their correlations with
effect-site sevoflurane concentration during emergence period. Because the concentration
of anesthetic gas consistently decreased and the influence from surgery was relative minor,
we considered the emergence period for correlation analysis. A p value less than 0.05 would
be considered as statistically significant. Multiple significant tests were calculated by using
Bonferroni correction. Statistical results are expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]).
Prediction probability (PK ) analysis is a versatile statistical method for measuring the
performance of an anesthetic depth index [67]. A value of one means that the observation
is always correctly predicted, a value of 0.5 indicates that the observation is predicted at
a 50/50 chance. The ability to predict anesthetic events can be investigated by using the
serial prediction probability analysis[67]. The correlation with sevoflurane concentration
employed PK analysis and Spearman rank correlation. Estimation of PK and its standard
error was obtained through the Jackknife method. Prior to using the null hypothesis, any
PK value less than 0.5 would be changed into one minus the PK value[67].

5.5

Serial Prediction Probability Analysis in Predicting Anesthetic Events

To evaluate the performance of the anesthetic indices in predicting the anesthetic events,
serial PK analysis was designed as follows. The following timestamps are used as the
baseline: one minute before LOC, five seconds before skin incision, three minutes before
the first reaction and three minutes before ROC. The serial PK analysis is performed
as successive PK analyzes of data pairs: index on baseline timestamp versus indices on
subsequent successive timestamps spaced by five seconds. As a result, the out of the serial
PK analysis is a sequence of time-varying PK values which reveals the temporal relation
between anesthetic events and the indices. By plotting the serial PK value and its standard
error bar, it becomes possible for us to do hypothesis test simply with the naked eye. If

Chapter 5. Performance Evaluation

31

there is significant difference (p < 0.05), it can be established if 1.5 times of their standard
error bars do not overlap [67, 68].

5.6

Correlations with Sevoflurane Concentration

Correlation between the above indices and sevoflurane concentration was investigated in
the emergence period. We chose the time interval where the sevoflurane concentration
is monotonically and continuously decreased. The period of spontaneous breathing is
defined from the start of adequate spontaneous breath to ROC. We employed the PK
analysis and Spearman rank correlation to analyze performance of indices sampled every
4 seconds. The results were tabulated as weighted averages according to each patient’s
data length. The bootstrap method was used to calculate the 95% confidence interval of
Spearman correlation based on 10,000 samplings. A value of Spearman correlation closer
to 1 is better since we expect that the indices will increase to correlate with the decrease
of sevoflurane concentration.

5.7

Algorithm of Serial Prediction Probability (sPK ) Analysis

In this section we detail a variation of the Prediction probability (PK ) analysis [67], referred
to as Serial Prediction Probability (sPK ) analysis. sPK is employed in this study to evaluate
the prediction performance of the BIS and ECG-derived continuous indices, including
NRR(t), tvHF(t), tvLF(t), tvLHR(t) and HR.
We consider K different measurement times, which are the times when we record the
anesthetic indicators. Then we determine two special timestamps, one is referred to as
the event time, indicating the happening of the event, for example, the first reaction, and
one is referred to as the base time, which is T > 0 seconds before the event time. Here T
depends on the event we are studying. Collect N subjects and record the measurement
times and the event time of each individual. Note that the measurement times and the
event time and are different among individuals, and we denote the k-th measurement time
of the n-th subject as tk,n , k = 1, . . . , K, and the base time as t0,n . Denoted as xkn the
anesthetic indicator (e.g. BIS) of the n-th subject recorded at time tk,n , and denoted as
ynk the associated outcome (e.g. first reaction) at time tk,n .
To evaluate the prediction power of an anesthetic indicator at the k-th measurement time,
we take the following two datasets. At the measurement time tk,n , we record the samk }, where each

pair (xkn , ynk ) is recorded from the n-th subject. Denote Zk := {(xk1 , y1k ), . . . , (xkN , yN

as the measurement data at the k-th measurement time. Moreover, at the base time
t0,n , we record the sample anesthetic indicators {x01 , . . . , x0N } and the sample outcomes
0 }, where each pair is recorded at the base time. Denote Z := {(x0 , y 0 ), . . . , (x0 , y 0 )}

as the data at the base time.
For a given individual, there are five possible relationships between pairs of anesthetic
indicator and outcome at the k-th measurement time and those at the base time:

Usually the anesthetic indicator is of finer scale and the outcome is of coarser scale. Thus,
unlike the usual notion of correlation, in the PK analysis the tie in x is undesirable but
we tolerate the tie in y and the tie in both x and y. Based on this notion, we define
the serial PK index in the following way. Denote Pc (k), Pd (k) and Ptx (k) the respective
probabilities that two pairs of (x, y) independently drawn from Zk and Z0 with replacement
are concordant, disconcordant and tie in x at the k-th measurement time. The serial PK
index at the k-th measurement time is denoted as
PK (k) =

Pc (k) + 21 Ptx (k)
.
Pc (k) + Pd (k) + Ptx (k)

The PK (k) value is interpreted in the same way as that in the PK analysis. A value of
one means that the indicator always correctly predicts the observed depth of anesthesia,
a value of 0.5 means that the indicator predicts no better than 50/50 chance, and a PK (k)
value less than 0.5 means that the indicator predicts inversely. To be more precise, a zero
value also means a perfect prediction but in a reversed direction.
The estimation of the serial PK and its standard error was obtained by the Jackknife
method. Before the null hypothesis, the serial PK value less than 0.5 was converted into
one minus the serial PK value.

Visual Information in TF Plane

Abundant information can be visually read from the tvPS of IHR. Various features were
determined to reflect the physiologic dynamics of human body responding to various anesthetic events (Fig. 6.1).
It is demonstrated (Fig. 6.2,6.3) that the tvPS is more concentrated on deeper anesthetic
levels and more scattered on lighter anesthetic levels. This then created the hypothesis
on trying to understand the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon. This phenomenon
is consistently seen in most study cases. During spontaneous breathing (Fig.6.3), the
dominant curves can be seen in the first portion (usually on the left hand side) of the tvPS
graph. Meanwhile, less dominant curves can be identified in the second portion (usually
the right hand side). The dominant curve represents the typical rhythmicity feature.
It is also important to observe that the tvPS becomes more non-rhythmic prior to the
appearance of first reaction. (Fig. 6.3)
Painful surgical stimulations during anesthesia are referred to as noxious stimulation because an unconscious patient under anesthesia cannot report pain sensation. Two of the
most intense noxious stimulationthat occur in anesthesia and surgery are endotracheal intubation and skin incision. Clinical anesthesiologist uses the increase of heart rate and
blood pressure as indicators for the level of noxious stimulation. In my study, we have
found the visual information of tvPS that reveals the influence of noxious information
where the low frequency (LF) power increases immediately after noxious stimulation, and
wanes soon. The “LF surge phenomenon” appeared in all study cases. Although the main
goal of my study is on investigating NRR index, it can be seen that the potential value of
LF power as an “noxious index” deserves to be investigated too.

These visual findings are quantified by NRR and HRV indices, such as tvHF, tvLF and
tvLHR for subsequent analyses.

6.2

Multiple Component Phenomenon

Occasionally, multiple independent oscillatory components hidden in IHR can be seen
from the tvPS. To further expand on this statement, the term independent is defined
as the frequency of one component of which the modulation is unrelated to other components. Therefore, this is definitely not the harmonics (Fig.6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11). The
“multiple component phenomenon” are an interesting finding, which demonstrates the
dynamic physiology of human body undergoing anesthesia.
Apparently, it is nearly impossible to identify the appearance of multiple component from
raw IHR waveform using naked eye. The tvPS is good at presenting “multiple component phenomenon”, but it is a difficult task for classical power spectrum. The “multiple
component phenomenon” appeared in one thirds of the study cases. The moment that it
appeared and disappeared seems random and unpredictable. Even so, this phenomenon

fundamental frequency is the same as the rate of the ventilator, representing the entrainment of RSA by the controlled ventilation. The time-varying power spectra of RRI
showed rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic transition, corresponding to varying anesthetic depth,
whereas the time-varying power spectra of EDR was almost unchanged under controlled
ventilation.

EDR became non-rhythmic before the first reaction.(From ref.[69])

in advance (PK > 0.90). At the instance of first reaction (0 seconds), both the NRR
and BIS (both PK maxima > 0.95) were significantly better than other parameters. The
time-varying HRV indices and HR (PK < 0.83) provides significantly worse results than
the NRR.
In the serial PK analysis for skin incision (Fig. 6.4), tvLF reaches maximum (PK > 0.95)
roughly at 30 seconds after skin incision. It reflects skin incision best, followed by tvLHR
(PK < 0.85). The tvLF is significantly better than BIS (PK < 0.55) and NRR (PK < 0.65).
In the serial PK analysis for LOC (Fig. 6.12), BIS reflects perfectly (PK = 1) 50 seconds
after LOC. LOC is also associated with a decrease in tvLF, tvHF and HR. Nowever, NRR
does not reflects LOC well. In the serial PK analysis for ROC (Fig. 6.15), BIS is the best
index, and surpasses NRR, HR and the time-varying HRV indices significantly.
Due to the inadequate data quality, 1 patient has been eliminated from our data in regards
to the serial Pk analysis of the initial reaction. For our study, when we analyzed the serial
Pk of skin incision, LOC and ROC, we also eliminated 3, 5, and 4 patients respectively.

the NRR index is second (PK = 0.736, R = −0.619, p < 0.0001). The tvLF is the best

is significantly better ( p < 0.01). BIS surpasses NRR significantly in SB (p < 0.001). The

Quantitative Results of Noxious Stimulation

When observing the serial PK analysis for skin incision (Fig. 6.4), tvLF reaches the
maximum amount (PK > 0.95) 30 seconds after skin incision. This shows that the tvLF is
the best index of the skin incision, followed by the heart rate (PK < 0.85). Furthermore,
tvLF is significantly better than BIS (PK < 0.55) and the NRR index (PK < 0.65).

In the serial PK analysis for endotracheal intubation (Fig. 6.16), I compared different
indices calculated from multitaper reassignment spectrogram (HF, LF, LHR) with the indices calculated from STFT spectrogram (HFSTFT , LFSTFT , LHRSTFT ). This analysis
signifies that the LF power and LHR provide the best results for the noxious stimulation
of endotracheal intubation. Meanwhile, the heart rate is represented the second best and
the BIS index is represented the worst. The indices that are calculated from multitaper reassignment spectrogram performs better than the corresponding indicators that are
calculated from the STFT spectrogram.

“LF surge phenomenon”. The “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic phenomenon” and “LF surge

foreshadows the subsequent positive statistical results.
The quantitative analysis proves that the NRR index indicates the first motor movement
reaction better than other clinical indices[69]. BIS index is the best indiator for LOC
and ROC. NRR index correlates with the concentration of sevoflurane. Furthermore, LF
power indicates noxious stimulation best, and better than the heart rate. It is also shown
the statistical benefit of the multitaper reassignment spectrogram over the classical STFT
spectrogram.

Implications to Anesthesiology
and Physiology
7.1

Main Findings

There are two important clinical results in regards to the NRR index. First, the NRR
index is able to predict first reaction during emergency period. Second, the NRR index
correlates with the sevoflurance concentration during the patient’s spontaneous breathing.
Even so, the NRR index is not the best predictor for LOC and ROC. These findings suggest
that there is a distinct physiological interpretation of the anesthetic depth level when
compared to the hypnosis measured by surface EEG. Furthermore, tvLF correlates well
with skin incision and endotracheal intubation. This momentary information is currently
unavailable to clinical anesthesiologists as both the IHR and tvPS are not implemented in
current monitor.

7.2

Genuineness of NRR index

The NRR index generally has a sharp increase nearly before the onset of the patient’s
first reaction. This then makes it highly unlikely that the motion artifacts interfere the
NRR index. Furthermore, the observed NRR index performance in not confounded by
the ventilation mode change. In particular, aside from the LOC, there are no transitions
that occur from the mechanical ventilation to the spontaneous breathing in the data we
have obtained. Also, there is no positive pressure ventilation for all the first reaction
data. Furthermore, past literature on the association between ”rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
transition of the oscillatory pattern in RRI index and the different level of anesthesia has
49

Chapter 7. Implications

50

been mentioned but no quantitative works have been done. By using the classical power
spectral analysis, Kato et al. has described that the high frequency component of RRI
disperses when the patient awakens and concentrates when the patient is under anesthetics
and controlled ventilation[2]. Based on the above facts, I am more than confident to state
that the NRR is convincing in its distinct and novel information that it is capable of
providing us.

7.3

Existing Findings

The results we have obtained from the BIS (Fig.6.12, Table 6.2) are in agreement with
previous studies showing that BIS is capable of monitoring awake status vs. anesthesia,
the first reaction and the decrease of anesthetic gas concentration[5, 8, 10]. Our BIS results
(Fig.6.13, Fig.6.16) also agree with past studies that provide evidience that BIS or other
EEG-derived indices cannot indicate the response to noxious stimulation[6, 7, 9].
The results from our analysis (Table 6.1) are also consistent with previous reported association between anesthetic depth and traditional HRV parameters: HRV is decreased during
general anesthesia and increased during recovery[2, 46, 70, 71]. Lastly, our results are also
consistent with the reported finding that combining classical HRV indices with BIS does
not outperform BIS in discriminating awake from asleep during anesthetic induction[72].
It has been reported that classical HRV parameters do not outperform heart rate when
predicting noxious stimulation[4, 73]. Contrarily, our results demonstrate that tvLF predicts skin incision better than HR. It seems that the noxious stimuli of the skin incision
elicited a momentary increase of sympathetic activity, which leads to this finding. Although the study is not designed for noxious stimulation, the finding that tvLF correlates
with skin incision shows the technical advantage of our approach and its potential as an
index for noxious stimulation.

7.4

Physiologic Interpretation of NRR

The association between NRR and anesthetic depth can be partially explained by the
cardiopulmonary coupling[14] and the respiratory physiology. When the coupling effect
is higher, the respiration pattern is reflected in the RRI index. The respiratory mechanism also contributes to the differential influence that occur from anesthetics. The neural
respiratory control comprises of two systems, the involuntary automatic control system
and the voluntary control system. The involuntary automatic control system is mainly

Chapter 7. Implications

51

controlled by the respiratory center in the pontomedullary area. The voluntary control system is mainly controlled by the forebrain[25]. These two systems are also distinct in their
neural anatomy and their functions. Respiratory efferent signals from these two systems
compete with each other and are integrated at the spinal level to control the respiratory
motor neuron. However, during spontaneous respiration, studies have also shown that
the involuntary automatic respiratory pattern generated in the pontomedullary center[25],
specifically the preBötzinger complex[26–28], is rhythmic.
On the other hand, the breathing pattern of the voluntary respiratory motor control is
non-rhythmic and involves the cortical processing and thalamic integration which responds
to the peripheral inputs and the descending inputs[25, 30–32]. The thalamus also actively participates in different motor functions, including respiration[31, 32], speech[33]
and cough[34] to name a few[74]. Our NRR index findings suggest that the non-rhythmic
respiratory activity involves the nearly entire cerebral regions is more susceptible to sevoflurane than the rhythmic respiration generated in the medulla. This suggestion is supported
by literature. Guedel made the classical observation on respiratory pattern[1]. Bimer et
al denoted that the respiratory irregularities accompany electroencephalographic arousal
reaction in spontaneous breathing[75]. Also, Studies have also shown that the respiratory
activity of preBötzinger complex is less depressed by sevoflurane[36, 37], and the effect of
volatile anesthetics is less prominent to the brainstem compared to the cortical regions
that are more abundant in synaptic transmissions.[37].
The ability for the NRR index to predict first reaction suggests a connection between the
“rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon and motor reactions. Antognini et al. demonstrated that immobility to surgical stimulation by volatile anesthetics in goats is mainly
modulated by the spinal cord, which also indirectly affects the thalamic response to noxious stimulation[12, 13]. Another study by Velly et al. also presented significant results[7].
He recorded the human subcortical electrophysiological activity and demonstrated that
subcortical activity (possible the thalamic activicy) predicts suppression of movement to
noxious stimuli, but not changes of consciousness, whereas cortical EEG predicts loss
of consciousness, but not motor suppression. Based on the above, NRR might reflect
the subcortical activity since it better reveals information about motor reaction, but not
consciousness, compared with BIS. Since immobility to noxious stimulation is similar to,
although not the same as the first reaction under surgical wound pain in the present study,
this relationship suggests the possible role of the thalamus in “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic”
phenomenon. Besides the NRR index, BIS also responded to first reaction in our serial
PK analysis, which is in agreement with other studies[10]. Therefore, it is possible that a
cortical mechanism is also related to the first reaction.

Chapter 7. Implications

52

From these results, it is possible to see that sevoflurane may affect non-rhythmic respiration
level of the spinal cord, subcortical supraspinal regions, or the cortex in the human brain.
Although we are currently unable to pinpoint the exact anatomic location, it is likely that
the subcortial supraspinal area, possibly the thalamus, is the most plausible region. The
above statement is sound as the NRR index generates different results in the serial PK
analysis and is also closely connected to the human body’s respiration responses. Thus, we
hypothesize that the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in IHR exhibits the central
respiratory activity via either central or peripheral mechanisms[14]. The IHR also reflects
the final integration of this ”rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” respiratory activity. Although
more evidence is necessary to further clarify these hypotheses, we propose to use the NRR
quantification methodology as a potential tool to evaluate the depth of anesthesia that
differs from EEG-based monitoring.

7.5

Clinical Application of the NRR Index

The first strength of this study is a new quantitative approach, referred to as the NRR
index, to analyze “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon. The NRR index has the potential to reflect different levels of anesthesia. Literature partially supports that there
is an underlying physiological mechanism. Second, the signal processing technique, multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform, has been well studied in the literature, so we have
adequate theoretical support to resolve the potential limitations of the PS. The momentary
dynamics in IHR can be captured by the tvPS, which leads to the NRR index.

7.6

Potential Index in Noxious Stimulation

Although we did not design the study for noxious stimulation, from the data analysis
result, we found that the indices we apply are potential in detecting pain reaction under
anesthesia. In particular, the tvLF index correlates with the noxious stimulation better
than heart rate as an additional finding. More study will need to be conducted on the
tvLF to provide sound results. It can also be helpful to compare this data with other
well known indices like the Surgical Stress Index® (SSI, GE healthcare) and Analgesia
Nociception Index® (ANI, Metrodoloris), which have been used on monitoring surgical
stress [11]. SSI is derived from the pulse wave amplitude and pulse beat interval of the
photoplethysmography whereas ANI indicates the parasympathetic tone derived from ECG
signal. It is possible that various indices can provide complementary information regarding
noxious stimulation that is gathered from different modalities and concepts.

Chapter 7. Implications

53

NRR index measures the rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic transition and quantifies a new kind of
information different from the above two instruments in both physiologic and mathematical
senses. Further investigations may be necessary to understand the clinical value and
application of tvPS.

7.7

Summary

In conclusion, we are able to extract hidden information regarding the anesthetic levels
from the routine ECG monitor. The quantitative results of the NRR index supports our
initial hypothesis that the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” transition correlates with motor
reactions during emergence period earlier than BIS index, and correlates with sevoflurance concentration. In addition, the potential of the time-varying HRV indices provides
observations of the relationship between tvLF index and the noxious stimulation. The
notion of these dynamics is rooted in the recently developed signal processing technique.
Without tvPS, the above quantification cannot be easily achieved. Overall, my clinical
study suggests that the ECG signal contains complementary information to the EEG-based
depth-of-anesthesia index.

Chapter 8

Real-time Processing Using the
Blending Operator
8.1

Real-time Processing

From the previous chapters, my study has concluded that the IHR signal during anesthesia
contains a wealth of information when viewing with tvP S. It is possible to derive the
IHR signal from ECG, the waveform of pulse oximetry, and also the invasive intra-arterial
pressure waveform. Although we mainly use ECG signal in the present project, all possible
sources of IHR are mandatory or frequently used functions in modern standard anesthesia
monitors. A practical question is how do we apply the NRR index proposed in the present
study to individual patients.
The processing steps of NRR index starts from the identification of each heart beat from
ECG signal. Next, an interpolation is used to convert the irregularly-sampled heart beats
data into regularly-sampled IHR data. Next, the calculation of the tvP S is based on the
multitaper Synchrosqueezing tranform. And lastly the NRR index is computed based on
the tvP S. Thus, the positive statistical results in previous chapter, are all obtained from
off-line calculations.
In anesthesia practices, the main purpose of anesthesia monitor is to provide real time
monitoring of the patient’s responses in order to provide timely responses. This purpose
then turns ordinary measurements like heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and blood
pressure into vital information during anesthesia. The real-time processing of NRR index is necessary if we would like to “steer” the anesthetic depth of patients based on
their instantaneous information from IHR. The potential benefits include adequate dose

54

Chapter 8. Real-time Processing

55

of anesthetics, possibility to divert critical situation, reduce stress response, and improve
long-term welfare.
In this chapter, my main focus is the real-time processing from the irregular heart beat
sample to the tvP S. The goal is to interpolate the irregular data samples in real time.
Meanwhile, the polynomials property of the interpolation also serves as the vanishingmoment and minimum-supported wavelets.

8.2

Technique Obstacles for Real-time Processing

Due to the irregular interval of each heartbeat, the heartbeat data is irregularly sampled
and this irregularity is unavoidable. Almost all continuous information are digitized in
equally-spaced samples in time or in space before further analysis for convenience, and for
efficiency. However, some situations provide non-uniform sampling and could be either
unavoidable or intended[76, 77]. In order to derive the continuous instantaneous heart
rate from the distinct heartbeats (Fig.2.1) is an example of the rich IHR information that
entirely relies on the irregularity of the heartbeats. Hence, the initial challenge is the
real-time processing of the non-uniform data samples.
When analyzing data the scope of continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the theoretical
background of Synchrosqueezing transform presents the optimal performance when using compactly supported windows in frequency domain[44]. That means we need whole
data converted in frequency domain for subsequent calculation. This is inefficient and
also highly unlikely for real-time data processing. Moreover, for real-time processing, an
wavelet transform (or STFT) better has a short, and compact support window in time.
This type of window may hamper the benefit of wavelet transform: an adequate vanishing
moment can eliminate trend component in terms of corresponding polynomial order to
preserve the oscillatory components we desire more efficiently.
A possible workaround is by cutting down a segment of data, windowing it, and then
choosing a suboptimal wavelet function empirically. Next, we would observe the effect of
suboptimal window and then adjust the parameters empirically until we finally accept the
suboptimal effect in real-time display.
There is a better solution to consider before we proceed with the above workaround. The
solution is a special spline interpolation, which has the interpolating ability to handle the
unequally-spaced heart beat sample, and the polynomial property to match the vanishing
moment property of wavelet transform. The resulting time-scale analysis is compactly
supported in time and provides better performance due to the vanishing moment property.

Chapter 8. Real-time Processing

56

Based on this scheme, the real-time tvPS can help remove the above mentioned technical
obstacles.

8.3

B-spline

We start from a brief introduction of the spline function. For digital samples g(tn ) are
sampled at time points
t : a = t0 < t1 < t2 < . . . ,

(8.1)

where {tk } may be irregular, or non-uniform signal, which means that we allow tk+1 − tk 6=
tj+1 − tj for k 6= j. Let m ≥ 3 be any desired integer and Πm−1 denote the space of all
polynomials of degree less than m.
The spline space is then defined as:
s : s−m+1 = s−m+2 = . . . = a = s0 < s1 < s2 < . . . ,

(8.2)

and the notation Ss,m := Ss,m [a, ∞) denotes the spline space of order m with the knot
sequence s.
To formulate a locally supported basis of Ss,m , we now introduce the truncated powers
xm−1
:= (max{0, x})m−1 .
+
The truncated power functions (sk − t)m−1
, k = 0, 1, . . ., are in Ss,m . Since (xk − t)m−1
,
+
+
k ≥ 1, have global support, we apply the m-th order divided differences to form locally
supported functions. The divided differences are
[ u, . . . , u ]f :=

f (l) (u)
l!

if there are l + 1 entries in [u, . . . , u], and
[ u0 , . . . , un ]f :=

[ u1 , . . . , un ]f − [ u0 , . . . , un−1 ]f
un − u0

if u0 ≤ u1 ≤ . . . ≤ un and un > u0 .
Now we consider the knot sequence s of the spline space Ss,m . The normalized B-splines[78]
are the divided difference of the truncated power (sk − t)m−1
, namely,
+
Nm,k (t) = Ns,m,k (t) = (sm+k − sk )[ sk , . . . , sm+k ](· − t)m−1
,
+
for k = −m + 1, . . . , 0, 1, 2, . . ..

(8.3)

Chapter 8. Real-time Processing

57

We would apply the recursive formula to implement Nm,k [52, page 143 (6.6.12a)]. The
B-splines are a locally supported.
However, if we choose the irregularly-spaced sequence t of time positions in (8.1) as the
knot sequences s in (8.2) by attaching t−m+1 = . . . = t0 = a to t as in (8.2), it can be
difficult to compute, or the computation cost will be higher for the non-uniform {tj } and
large values of n.

8.4

Quasi-interpolation

On the other hand, de Boor and Fix [79] proposed a spline representer f (t), which approximates the data instead of providing exact interpolating the target data function g(t)
at t = tj , j = 0, 1, . . . , n (that is, if f (tj ) 6= g(tj ) is allowed). This quasi-interpolation has
a “polynomial preservation” property: g(t) = p(t) ∈ Πm−1 .
This polynomial preservation is important to improve the performance of the continuous
wavelet transform (CWT), and hence the Synchrosqueezing transform (SST), to reveal
the oscillatory components. Specifically, if the analysis wavelet is compactly supported by
the spline of order m, then the m-th order vanishing moment annihilates the m-th order
Taylor polynomial expansion of g(t). This then facilitates the trend removal of the the
signal g(t) as a polynomial. However, the quasi-interpolation scheme de Boor proposed
[78, 79] requires derivative data values of g(t). Others [80, 81] proposed to replace the
derivatives of g(t) by divided differences of {g(ti )}. However, these quasi-interpolations[82]
do not address the real-time issue at stake. In addition, quasi-interpolation introduced the
error g(ti ) − f (ti ) for i = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Chui et al. proposed a real-time quasi-interpolation[83]. Chui and his college also introduced a “local interpolation”[84] to correct the error of “quasi-interpolation”.
The real-time quasi-interpolant [83] is introduced as follow: for each k = 0, 1, . . ., consider
the Vandermonde determinant

The quasi-interpolation operator Qm (8.4) possesses the polynomial preservation property.
For any m ≥ 1,
(Qm p)(t) = p(t),
for all t ≥ a and for all p ∈ Πm−1 , provided that the summation (8.4) account for all nonnegative integers k = 0, 1, . . .. Furthermore, in view of the support of Mt,m,k , it follows
that

This local polynomial preservation property allows the CWT, and hence the SST, to
annihilate the (m − 1)-th degree Taylor polynomial approximation of the signal at tj ,
where u < j < v.

Local Interpolation Operator

The local interpolation operator, denoted by Rm , satisfies the interpolation property. To
define Rm , we will insert knots to t by considering a new knot sequence s ⊃ t (8.2). For
simplicity, we will introduce even order variable m :
For even m ≥ 4, we set
smk/2 = tk ,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

That is, we insert (m/2 − 1) knots in between two consecutive knots in t. For convenience,
we will choose the new knots to be equally spaced between every pair of two consecutive
knots.
Fix even m ≥ 4. Let Ns,m,j be the m-th order B-spline with knot sequence s. Then the
completely local spline basis function can be defined by
Ls,m,j (t) :=

Ns,m,m(j−1)/2 (t)
.
Ns,m,m(j−1)/2 (tj )

Since tj = smj/2 is the “centered” knot and
suppNs,m,m(j−1)/2 = [ sm(j−1)/2 , sm(j+1)/2 ] = [ tj−1 , tj+1 ],
we have




 Ls,m,j (tj ) = 1

(8.5)



 suppL
s,m,j = [ tj−1 , tj+1 ].
It is clear that Ls,m,j (tk ) = δj−k , where the Kronecker delta notation is used (8.5).

The above preparation provides a real-time implementation of the local interpolation operator, which satisfies the interpolation property (8.5).
Fix m ≥ 3. For a given function g ∈ C(R), the local interpolation operator Rm is defined
as
(Rm g)(t) :=

X

g(tk )Ls,m,k (t).

Blending Operator

We are now ready to apply (8.4) to obtain the blending operator, denoted by Rm ⊕ Qm .

Chapter 8. Real-time Processing

60

Fix m ≥ 3 and g ∈ C(R). The blending operator is defined as Pm := Rm ⊕ Qm , where
Rm ⊕ Qm := Qm + Rm (I − Qm ) = Qm + Rm − Rm Qm ,
and I is the identity operator. In particular, we have
(Pm g)(t) :=

X

g(tk )Mt,m,k (t) +

X

g(tk ) −


g(tj )Mt,m,j (tk ) Ls,m,k (t).

(8.7)

X

We remark that in the definition of Pm , the two operators Rm and Qm are not commutative.
Let us summarize the two key properties of the blending operator in the following theorem.
1. The blending operator Pm possesses both the polynomial preservation property of
Qm and the interpolatory property of Rm .
2. The error of spline interpolation by the blending operator is both small and bounded.
In conclusion, the blending operator, as a local spline interpolation operator, achieves the
optimal interpolation error rate when compared with the traditional spline interpolation
operator. In addition, the error depends only on the local data profile, which allows
real-time implementation with optimal error rate.

8.7

Real-time tvPS

We provide a real-time computational algorithm to compute f (t) for the upcoming data
samples g(t0 ), g(t1 ), . . . etc. For convenience, we only consider even order m. The formulation for the odd order is similar but slightly more complicated.
The blending operator leads to the real-time spline interpolation. For real-time issue, the
wavelets have to be minimum supported in time. We can design the wavelets with the
same number of vanishing moments as the spline. Meanwhile the wavelets have minimum
support and maximum order of vanishing moments.
Let m, n ≥ 1 be arbitrary integers, and x an arbitrary knot sequence. The spline basis
functions is then as follows:
(n)

ψx,m;n,k (x) := Nx,m+n,k (x),

k ∈ Z,

(8.8)

Algorithm 1 Real-time implementation of the blending operator
First, pre-compute the B-spline values Ns,m,l (tj ) =: nl,j . Then for each k, since Mt,m,k ∈
Ss,m , there exists a finite sequence {bk,l } in the formulation of
Mt,m,k (t) =

X

bk,l Ns,m,l (t).

l

Also pre-compute dk,j = Mt,m,k (tj ).
Now, while the data sequence {g(tk )} is acquired, compute

and then up-sample {gl∗ } by m(l − 1)/2; that is, set

and gl# = 0.

Then, we have an on-line computational scheme for the quasi-interpolation spline interpolation:

for increasing number of samples from g(tn ) to g(tn+1 ), . . .; and this can be implemented

That means the arbitrary chosen n in the interpolator leads to the vanishing moment order
of the wavelets if we use this spline basis as the wavelet function. The wavelet transform
can successfully eliminate the n order polynomial as a trend component.
Let m, n ≥ 1 be arbitrary integers. Then the derivative of the wavelet ψx,m;n,k on an
arbitrary knot sequence x, is given by

This property permits us to conveniently calculate the derivative of the wavelet, which
is required to calculate the frequency reassignment in Synchrosqueezing transform.(see
equation 4.3)
Then, we can proceed to the Synchrosqueezed CWT to obtain the real-time time-frequency
analysis as real-time tvPS. Using this tvPS, we can apply the research in previous chapters to quantify the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon in real-time. Using the
clinical data to “emulate” the real-time calculation of NRR index, we obtained a comparable performance of the correlation with sevoflurane concentration during spontaneous
respiration: The PK value of real-time NRR index is 0.711 ± 0.021 (PK of off-line NRR
index:0.732 ± 0.018)(6.2).

Conclusion
9.1

Research Findings

Thanks to the advancement of science in anesthesiology and neural physiology, I can propose a theory and modeling to investigate the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon.
Furthermore, because of the advancement of signal processing technique, I am able to use
multitaper Synchrosqueezing technique to compute the NRR index. Anesthesia creates
dynamic changes to the human body, and due to the time-varying ability and good TF
resolution, the NRR index is a particularly suitable tool reflecting the constant changes
during anesthesia[43, 61].
The numeric result from clinical database is positive [69]. NRR index performs better and
faster than BIS index when detecting motor movement reaction. This also supports the
fact that different brain regions mediating various functions, with differential susceptibility
to anesthetics may require multi-modal assessment of these anesthetic effects. NRR index
is therefore able to provide additional value. In addition, LF index provides good results
as an indicator for noxious stimulation, for both skin incision and endotracheal intubation.
ECG waveform is standard information in current anesthesia, while the IHR is not. My
study shows that these new indices derived from ECG waveform can provide additional
information that could be beneficial to patients undergoing anesthesia in the future.

5. Positive clinical value of the NRR index was obtained from a clinical database
6. Improved performance of classical HRV parameters was obtained using tvP S
7. A real-time scheme that provides real-time tvP S and real-time NRR index.

9.3

Future Directions

The results of my project indicates several future research possibilities.
In clinical anesthesiology, more studies should be conducted to answer questions regarding the value of NRR index in different kinds of anesthetics (i.e. propofol, ketamine,
dexmedetomidine or xenon), in different types of patient (i.e. children, lying-in women,

Chapter 9. Conclusion

elderly patient, or patient with severe illness). Since the NRR index may indicate the
activity of subcortical areas, this poses questions on if the application of the NRR index
can lead to less stress response and better long-term outcomes, and if it is possible, how
can we obtain those results. On the other hand, the IHR is derived from the ECG signal,
I wonder whether it is possible to calculate the NRR index from photoplethsmography or
intra-arterial pressure waveform. It also needs more clinical study to better understand
the clinical role of NRR index and the tvLF index.
It is possible that a thorough understanding of the basic mechanism can lead to better
clinical benefit. The origin of “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon should be in the
brain. However, the neural mechanism has not been addressed according to my best knowledge. For example, where exactly is the anatomical location that creates this phenomenon?
What could cause the multiple component phenomenon as previously mentioned? Lastly,
how do the neurons coordinate with one another during this phenomenon? It is foreseeable
that the answers of these questions can directly contribute to the brain science. Thus, the
neurophysiological study based on the animal model is a potential future research.
The signal processing technique directly contributes to the performance of these clinical
indices. The current result of tvPS is helpful in revealing various features in the TF plane,
but there are still a lot of room for improvements. The time-frequency analysis is based
mostly on the Fourier transform. I am interested in whether it is possible to discard the
idea of frequency in order to have a better understanding of the signal’s features. The realtime calculation and display of the clinical indices provides benefit to individual patients.
Technique developments in real-time processing is imperative.

9.4

Summary

My study focuses on the qualifications of the “rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic” phenomenon.
I have verified that my proposed model and quantitative index through using clinical
database. The positive results support my proposal on using the adaptive harmonic model
and time-varying power spectrum based on the multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform.
The NRR index also presents unique values in clinical anesthesia. The achievements in
this thesis fill a gap in the fields of medicine and provide a new perspective on many of
the issues that could be understood in the future.
