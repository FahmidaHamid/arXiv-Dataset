Abstract
Different numerical mappings of the DNA sequences have been
studied using a new cluster-scaling method and the well known spectral methods. It is shown, in particular, that the nucleotide sequences
in DNA molecules have robust cluster-scaling properties. These properties are relevant to both types of nucleotide pair-bases interactions:
hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions. It is shown that taking into
account the cluster-scaling properties can help to improve heterogeneous models of the DNA dynamics. It is also shown that a chaotic
(deterministic) order, rather than a stochastic randomness, controls
the energy minima positions of the stacking interactions in the DNA
sequences on large scales. The chaotic order results in a large-scale
chaotic coherence between the two complimentary DNA-duplex’s sequences. A competition between this broad-band chaotic coherence
and the resonance coherence produced by genetic code has been briefly
discussed. The Arabidopsis plant genome (which is a model plant for
genome analysis) and two human genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, have
been considered as examples.

Introduction

A DNA molecule carries information in the form of four chemical groups or
nucleotide bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, represented by
the letters A, C, G and T. The order of bases on a DNA strand is the DNA
sequence. If we read along one of the two DNA-helix sides we get text like
GATACA... In the double-stranded DNA, the two strands run in opposite

directions and the bases pair up such that A always pairs with T and G
always pairs with C. That is because these particular pairs fit exactly to form
effective hydrogen bonds with each other. The A-T base-pair has 2 hydrogen
bonds and the G-C base-pair has 3 hydrogen bonds. The G-C interaction is
therefore stronger than A-T, and A-T rich regions of DNA are more prone
to thermal fluctuations and to initiation sites (origin) at unwinding stage of
DNA replication process. The bases are oriented perpendicular to the DNAhelix axis. Constant thermal fluctuations result in local twisting, stretching,
bending, and unwinding of the double-strands. In solution DNA assumes
linear configuration because it is the one of minimum energy. The helix axis
of DNA in vivo is usually strongly curved because the stretched length of
the human genome, for instance, is about 1 meter and this length needs
to be ”packaged” in order to fit in the nucleus of a cell (the diameter of
the nucleus from a typical human somatic cell is about 5 × 10−6 meters).
Therefore, the DNA has to be highly organized. This packaging of DNA
deforms it physically, thereby increasing its energy (less stable than relaxed
DNA, due to less than optimal base stacking). In this situation certain
strain is relieved by supercoiling: helix bends and twists to achieve better
base stacking orientation despite having too many bp/turn. The difference
in A-T and G-C interactions can be used for optimizing the free energy. The
base-pairs stacking energies (the main stabilizing factor in the DNA duplex,
see for instance Ref. [1]) are highly dependent on the base sequence [2]. These
interactions come partly from the overlap of the π electrons of the bases and
partly from hydrophobic interactions. Quantum chemistry calculations give
rather different energies for different stacked base pairs: Fig. 1 (cf. Ref.
[3]). Therefore, certain clustering of the base-pairs can be used by nature in
order to minimize the excess energy that builds up when DNA molecules are
deformed during the process of packaging. The physical constraints given
by the supercoiling of the DNA sequence, in particular to the positioning of
nucleosomes along the sequence [4], play significant role in creating of the
clustering.
Moreover, the increase in stored (potential) energy within the molecule
2

is then available to drive reactions such as the unwinding events that occur
during DNA replication. Before replication of DNA can occur, the length
of the DNA double helix about to be copied must be unwound and the
two strands must be separated by breaking the hydrogen bonds that link
the paired bases. The process of replication begins in the DNA molecules at
thousands of sites called origins of replication. Because the location and time
of initiation of origins is generally stochastic, the time to finish replication will
also be a stochastic process. The random distribution of origin firing raises
the random gap problem: a random distribution will lead to occasional large
gaps that should take a long time to replicate. Despite this each cell in a
population must complete the replication process in an accurate and timely
manner (see for instance, Refs. [5],[6]). Different solutions to this problem
have been suggested (see, for instance, Refs. [7],[8],[9],[10]) .
If the spacing of origins is not completely random then any regularity in
the spacing of origins will tend to suppress the large gaps [7]. For instance,
origins within specific clusters could be preferred to fire [11],[12]. Since a
G-C base pair, with three hydrogen bonds, is expected to be harder to break
than an A-T base pair with only two bonds, a clustering of these two kinds of
the base-pares can be operational in order to solve the random origin firing
problem. The stacking interactions can also contribute to solution of this
problem. It will be shown below that a chaotic (deterministic) order, rather
than a stochastic randomness, controls the energy minima positions of the
stacking interactions in the DNA sequences on large-scales. This chaotic
order not only introduces a regularity into the spacing of the origins but
also results in a long-range coherence between the two complimentary DNAduplexs strands.

Cluster-scaling

Because of many orders of space scales involved in these processes one can
expect that the clustering will exhibit scale-invariant properties (see, for instance, Ref. [13]). A cluster-scaling for stochastic systems was recently
suggested in Refs. [14],[15],[16]. The genome data can be readily checked
on the cluster-scaling properties in a ”1 or 0” mapping. In this presentation
(see, for instance Refs. [18],[23] and references therein) one should put A=1
and C=G=T=0 in an original DNA sequences to obtain an A-dominated
sub-sequences (one can obtain C or G, or T-dominated sub-sequences in

along the sub-sequences. For the 1 or 0 mapping this running average will
present a weight of the sub-sequences in interval [j,j + τ ]. Following to Ref.
[14] we are interested in scaling variation of the standard deviation of the
running density fluctuations hδnj (τ )2 i1/2 with τ
hδnj (τ )2 i1/2 ∼ τ −α

(2)

where h...i denotes average over the sub-sequences, δnj (τ ) = nj (τ ) − hn(τ )i.
The power law, Eq. (2), corresponds to a scale-invariant (scaling) behavior.
The exponent α in Eq. (2) was called in Ref. [14] as cluster-exponent. For
white noise zeros (intersections of a white noise signal with time axis) it can
be derived analytically that α = 1/2 (see Ref. [14] and references therein).
This value can be considered as an upper limit (non-clustering case) for the
cluster-exponent. If 0 < α < 0.5 we have a cluster-scaling situation, and the
cluster-scaling is stronger for smaller values of α (see for examples Ref. [14]).

In this paper we will present, as an example, results obtained for the
genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a
model plant for genome analysis [17] and for two human genes BRCA2 and
NRXN1.
Let us start from the Arabidopsis. Its genome is one of the smallest plant genomes (about 157 million base pairs and five chromosomes)
that makes Arabidopsis thaliana useful for genetic mapping and sequencing.
The most up-to-date version of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome is maintained by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (see, for instance,
http://www.plantgdb.org/). The results of computations for the genome sequences associated with the Arabidopsis are shown in figure 2. We show in
Fig. 2 results for the T-dominated sub-sequence, whereas the results for A,
C, and G-dominated sub-sequences are similar to those shown in the Fig. 2.
The Fig. 2 shows (in the log-log scales) dependence of the standard deviation of the running density fluctuations hδn(τ )2 i1/2 on τ for the T-dominated
subsequence. The straight line is drawn in this figure to indicate the scaling
(2). The slope of this straight line provides us with the cluster-exponent
α = 0.33 ± 0.02. The results of computations for the genome sequences
associated with genes: BRCA2 and NRXN1, are shown in figures 3 and

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Molecular location of gene BRCA2 on chromosome 13: base pairs 32,889,616 to 32,973,808). BRCA2 gene helps prevent
cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. By
helping repair DNA, BRCA2 plays a role in maintaining the stability of a
cell’s genetic information. Gene NRXN1 (neurexin 1) is among the largest
known in human, molecular location on chromosome 2: base pairs 50,145,642
to 51,259,673. NRXN1 gene represents a strong candidate for involvement
in the etiology of nicotine dependence, and even subtle changes in NRXN1
might contribute to susceptibility to autism.
We show in Figs 3 and 4 results for the T-dominated sub-sequences, whereas
the results for A, C, and G-dominated sub-sequences are similar to those
shown in the Figs. 3 and 4 (for each gene respectively). Fig. 3 shows (in
the log-log scales) dependence of the standard deviation of the running density fluctuations hδn(τ )2 i1/2 on τ for the T-dominated subsequence of gene
BRCA2. The straight line is drawn in this figure to indicate the scaling

consequence of the finite-size effects for the cluster-scaling is a wavy character
of the scaling data in the log-log scales (cf. Ref. [14]).

Hydrogen bonds

The most popular potential for modeling the hydrogen (H) bond within a
base-pair in the DNA chains is the Morse potential (see, for instance, Refs.

in the ith site respectively (the A-T pair includes two H bonds, while the
C-G pair includes three H bonds, see Introduction); a−1 is a measure of the
potential well width; variable yi is a dynamical deviation of the H bonds from
their equilibrium lengths at position i. The ratio D C−G /D A−T = 1.5 is often

used for the model purposes (though recent quantum chemical calculations
[29] results in a ratio D C−G /D A−T = 2).
Randomly distributed along the DNA chain bivalued H-bond coupling
strengths D A−T and D G−C are usually used in the DNA dynamics models.
This would be appropriate for an arbitrary base pair sequence. However, as
it is follows from previous consideration, homogeneous random distribution
is not realistic even for the most long genes like NRXN1 (see, for instance,
Ref. [30]). The dynamic heterogeneous properties of DNA molecule was
considered, for instance, as a reason for the so-called multi-step melting [31].
However, the assumption of a random and short-range (delta-) correlated
sequence made in Ref. [31] do not result in the multi-step melting and
only an additional assumption of an additional backbone stiffness due to
the double-stranded conformation of DNA molecule allowed to the authors
to observe a multi-step melting in their model. In the model suggested In
Ref. [32] the sequence randomness considered as a quenched noise with finite
sequence correlation length. In this approach regions dominated by A-T or,
alternatively, by C-G pairs play significant role in the bubble (i.e. locally
denaturated states) formation.
Taking into account the cluster-scaling of the DNA nucleotides is a natural

step toward more realistic dynamical model. Because of the bivalued H-bond
coupling strengths: Di = D A−T or Di = D G−C , this can be readily done
using following bivalued mapping: A = T = 1, C = G = 0 or, alternatively,
C = G = 1, A = T = 0. Figure 5 shows cluster-scaling behavior, Eq. (2),
for the former mapping of NRXN1 gene. The cluster scaling exponent α =
0.32±0.02 in this case. For C = G = 1, A = T = 0 the mapping calculations
give the same result as well as for corresponding mappings of the gene BRCA2
(indication of an universality). Therefore, the bivalued sequences of the Di
coefficients for the DNA dynamic chain should be chosen as cluster-scaling
ones with certain cluster-exponent α Eq. (2) (for the considered genes α ≃
0.32).

Stacking interaction

Two factors are mainly responsible for the stability of the DNA double helix:
base pairing between complementary strands and stacking between adjacent
bases (see Introduction). It is shown experimentally that DNA stability
9

is mainly determined by base-stacking interactions which contribute greatly
into the dependence of the duplex stability on its sequence. (see, for instance,
Ref. [1]). Therefore, it is interesting to check whether the stacking interactions dominate also the above-considered cluster-scaling phenomenon (cf.
Introduction). In order to check this let us use following mapping: in combination AT = T A = 1 1, and A = T = G = C = 0 otherwise. An alternative
mapping is: in combination CG = GC = 1 1, and A = T = G = C = 0 otherwise. If the stacking interactions dominate the cluster-scaling phenomenon,
then one can expect that the cluster-scaling will be more pronounced just
for these maps (cf. Fig. 1). It means that the cluster-exponent corresponding to these maps would be smaller than cluster-exponents observed for the
above considered maps. As one can see comparing Figs. 6 and 7 with Figs.
3,4, and 5 in reality we have an opposite situation. This comparison indicates that the stacking interactions do not dominate the above-considered
cluster-scaling phenomenon (at least for the examples given in the paper).
In a realistic dynamic model of DNA molecule one should take into account also the cluster-scaling of stacking interaction itself as it is shown in
Figs. 6 and 7 for instance (see also Refs. [33],[34] for heterogeneity of both
pairing and stacking interactions). This can be done in the frames of a commonly used approximation for the stacking potential (see, for instance, Ref.
[35])

where ∆Hi can take different values for different stacked pairs {yi , yi−1 }. Because the situation is not bivalued in this case this task seems to be more
difficult than for the hydrogen bonds. The main problem here is hybridization of the nucleotides in different types of the stacked base-pairs (Fig. 1).
The fact that the cluster-scaling exponents for the different types of stacked
base-pairs have approximately the same value can help to solve this problem.
This is not the case, however, for hybridization problem if one will consider
a realistic model taking into account cluster-scaling of both hydrogen bonds
and stacking interactions (the cluster-scaling exponents are different for hydrogen bonds: Fig. 5, and for stacking interactions: Figs. 6 and 7).

Chaotic order of the stacking interactions

Both stochastic and deterministic processes can result in the broad-band part
of the spectrum, but the decay in the spectral power is different for the two
cases. An exponential decay with respect to frequency refers to chaotic time
series while a power-law decay indicates that the spectrum is stochastic. Not
all chaotic systems have the exponentially decaying spectra, but appearance
of an exponentially decaying spectrum in the system under consideration
provides a strong indication that we have deal with a chaotic (deterministic) process [36]-[39]. The previously observed spectra of the DNA-sequences
mappings exhibited power-law decay indicating a stochastic origin of the
DNA-sequences randomness [18]-[24]. It should be noted that all the maps
used in these investigations operated with simple use of the A or/and T
or/and G or/and C numerical mapping. It seems, however, that a deeper
insight in the underlying physics can be obtained using numerical maps operating with the combinations AT and TA which represent energy minima for
the stacking interactions (cf. Fig. 1 and Ref. [15]). For this purpose we will
put combinations AT = T A = 1, and A = T = G = C = 0 otherwise in a
DNA-sequence under consideration (the multiple AT/TA combinations will
be also considered as a single ’1’ in this mapping, for example: ATATTA=1).
This map will represent a {0,1}-values map of the stacking interactions energy minima sequence.
An additional technical problem will appear when one will try to analyze
spectral properties of such map. The sequence will be very spiky and the

usual spectral methods (such as the fast Fourier transform or the maximum
entropy method, for instance) will be practically useless. In order to solve this
problem we will use an additional mapping of the spiky series into a telegraph
signal. The spikes (symbols 1) are identical to each other and the dynamical
information is coded in the length of the interspike intervals and the interspike
intervals positions on the sequence, therefore it is the most direct way to map
the spiky sequence into a telegraph signal, which has values -1 from one side
of a spike and values +1 from another side of the spike. An example of such
mapping is given in figure 8. While the dynamical information is here the
same as for the corresponding spike sequence, the spectral methods are quite
applicable to analysis of the telegraph series.
Figure 9 shows spectrum of a telegraph sequence corresponding to the
above-described map constructed for the genome sequence of the Arabidopsis
thaliana. We used the semi-log axes in the Fig. 9 in order to indicate
exponential decay of the spectrum (the straight line). It should be noted
that value of f0 is not the same for different species (for human genome, for
instance, f0 ≃ 0.05).
Many of the well known chaotic attractors (’Lorenz’, ’Rössler’, etc.) exhibit the exponentially decaying spectra [37]. Here, for comparison with the
Fig. 9, we will consider a chaotic spectrum generated by the Kaplan-Yorke
map [40] (relevance of this choice will be clear immediately). In the Langevin

Figure 10 shows spectrum of a chaotic solution of the Kaplan-Yorke map

exponential decay of the spectrum (the straight line).
Although the exponential part of the spectrum in Fig. 9 is apparently
extended to the frequencies f ≃ 0.3 for frequencies larger then f ≃ 0.2 (i.e.
for scales n ≤ 5) corresponding telegraph signal is a random one. This can be
seen from the figure 11, which shows autocorrelation function corresponding
to the spectrum shown in Fig. 9 (the correlation length ζ = 2). We have a
chaotic order on the large scales only (see also next section, Fig. 13). Fig.

Large-scale chaotic coherence

In the double-stranded DNA the two strands are complementary in a local
sense, i.e. the nucleotide bases pair up such that A always pairs with T
and G always pairs with C. But what can one say about nonlocal coherence of the nucleotides’ sequences in the two strands? Actually, because of
the local complimentary behavior this question can be answered by studying coherence between the A (map: A=1, T=C=G=0) and T (map: T=1,
A=C=G=0) dominated sequences along a single strand (analogously for the
C and G sequences). Due to the complementary properties of the A and
T nucleotides the chaotic (deterministic) order of the energy minima of the

stacking interactions should result in a large-scale coherence of the two DNA
strands’ sequences. This is mainly relevant to A and T sequences because
just the AT/TA compositions correspond to the energy minima. Certain
(however considerably smaller) large-scale coherence can appear also in C
and G sequences as a secondary effect (see Fig. 13 and the explanations
below). In order to compare coherent properties of the two DNA strands’
sequences we will use cross-spectral analysis. The cross spectrum E1,2 (f ) of
two processes x1 (t) and x2 (t) is defined by the Fourier transformation of the
cross-correlation function normalized by the product of square root of the
univariate power spectra E1 (f ) and E2 (f ):

the bracket h...i denotes the expectation value. The cross spectrum can be
decomposed into the phase spectrum φ1,2 (f ) and the coherency C1,2 (f ):
E1,2 (f ) = C1,2 (f )e−iφ1,2 (f )

(7)

Because of the normalization of the cross spectrum the coherency is ranging
from C1,2 (f ) = 0, i.e. no linear relationship between x1 (t) and x2 (t) at f , to
C1,2 (f ) = 1, i.e. perfect linear relationship.

the C (or G) dominated sequences (dashed curve). While the A (or T) dominated sequences exhibit rather high (> 0.5) coherency in a low-frequency
domain f < 0.15 (i.e. for the length periods ≥ 7 nucleotides, cf. last paragraph of the previous Section), the C (or G) dominated sequences exhibit a
low coherence even in this domain. The last (low) coherence is a secondary
effect to the the former one (see above).
It should be also noted that the C/G coherency has a strong burst (the
peak marked by an arrow in the Fig. 13) in a narrow vicinity of frequency
f ≃ 0.33. This resonance peak comes from a very low coherency background
and corresponds to the codons’ period T=3 nucleotides (T=1/f). Let us recall
that a codon is a sequence of three adjacent nucleotides constituting the genetic code (a specific amino acid residue in a polypeptide chain). Therefore,
one can speculate that the two complimentary DNA strands can have relatively strong coherence related to the genetic code content in the case of the
C/G containing codons, whereas the large-scale chaotic coherence related to
the large-scale chaotic order in the A/T containing codons can suppress the
genetic coherence (cf. Fig. 13). However, this speculation leads us beyond
the pure physical frames of present paper.

Discussion

For the Gaussian-like processes there is a very close relationship between
their spectral and cluster-scaling properties [15]. If the system under consideration is non-Gaussian, then this relationship is broken. The section V
provides a good example of such situation. Indeed, figure 14 shows the standard deviation for δn(τ ) vs. τ for the energy minima {0,1}-mapping used in
the section V. The straight lines (the best fit) indicate the scaling law Eq.
(2). Thus, for the considered non-Gaussian system a robust cluster-scaling
(Fig. 14) can co-exist with the non-scaling spectrum (Fig. 9). Therefore, the
long-range correlations (which correspond to the power-law scaling spectra)
in the human genome [18]-[23] are not directly related to its cluster-scaling
properties. These two types of scaling behavior are independent for the
non-Gaussian systems that makes the cluster-scaling method an independent
tool for studying these systems. Moreover, while the previously used for the
spectral computations simple maps indicate stochastic behavior, the intrinsic map for the energy minima of stacking interactions indicates a chaotic
(deterministic) interactions in an underground of the stochastic system on
large scales. This large-scale chaotic order can be operational in the resolving the random gap problem mentioned in the Introduction and should affect
the DNA-duplex dynamics creating, in particular, the large-scale coherence
between the two strands of the DNA-duplex.
