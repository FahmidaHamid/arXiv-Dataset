Abstract

Bacteria have remarkably robust cell shape control mechanisms. For example, cell diameter
only varies by a few percent across a population. MreB is necessary for establishment and
maintenance of rod shape although the mechanism of shape control remains unknown. We
perturbed MreB in two complimentary ways to produce steady-state cell diameters over a wide
range, from 790±30 nm to 1700±20 nm. To determine which properties of MreB are important
for diameter control, we correlated structural characteristics of fluorescently-tagged MreB
polymers with cell diameter by simultaneously analyzing 3-dimensional images of MreB and cell
shape. Our results indicate that the pitch angle of MreB inversely correlates with cell diameter.
Other correlations are not found to be significant. These results demonstrate that the physical
properties of MreB filaments are important for shape control and support a model in which MreB
dictates cell diameter and organizes cell wall growth to produce a chiral cell wall.

Introduction
Bacteria come in a large variety of shapes and sizes. Their diameters can range from 200 nm in
the case of Mycoplasma to 750µm or more for the macroscopic Thiomargarita namibiensis (1).
Cells also come in a variety of shapes from spheres and rods to spirals and squares. These
shapes can be important for many aspects of bacterial life such as motility, growth, predation,
and packing within biofilms (2).

Cell shape in the majority of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is defined by the rigid,
exoskeletal peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall (3). Bacterial cells modify their existing cell wall by
cutting existing PG and inserting new glycan strands during growth and division (4). In most rodshaped bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, the bacterial actin-homolog
MreB organizes the cell-wall growth machinery such that cell wall insertion is spatially driven by

the localization of MreB (5-7). MreB is required for rod shape, and thus mreB deletions or
treatment with MreB polymerization-inhibiting drugs such as A22 lead to spherical cells with
weakened cell walls that are prone to lysis (5, 8).

The structural properties of MreB and MreB polymers have only recently begun to be
elucidated. In-vitro experiments suggest that MreB forms anti-parallel filaments that bind to
membranes (9). These filaments induce curvature similar to that found in cells when bound to
the outside of membrane vesicles. The length of MreB filaments is a heavily debated subject.
Estimates of in-vivo MreB polymer lengths range from below the detection limit (10) to over
1.4 um (11). Swiulius et al. concluded that filaments were shorter than 80nm based on the fact
that unlabeled MreB polymers have not been observed in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
although the sensitivity to detect thin polymers near a membrane has not been demonstrated
with this technology. Reimold et al. estimated the lengths of filaments in cells expressing MreBmCherry to be micron-sized using structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (12), but they were
unable to gather 3D data due to the poor quantum efficiency of mCherry. To date no studies
have demonstrated that polymer length or any other feature of MreB polymers is important for
cell shape determination.

Recently, it was shown that fluorescent protein fusions can generate protein aggregation
depending on the fluorescent protein used, resulting in misfolding or mislocalization of the
protein (13). This is a possible cause for the shape anomalies observed in cells expressing
MreB-mCherry and could affect the observed MreB structure. More representative in-vivo
measurements of MreB polymers should be attainable through the use of better fluorescent
proteins and a 3-dimensional polymer measurement technique.

We previously confirmed the long-held hypothesis that MreB spatially localizes the various
synthase molecules responsible for modifying and inserting material into the peptidoglycan cell
wall (14). However, two competing hypotheses link MreB localization to growth (15, 16). MreB
has been suggested to serve as a scaffold that co-localizes multiple synthase molecules at
random positions along the cell cylinder (6). Other evidence suggests that MreB polymers serve
to spatially organize cell-wall insertion over long distances in a helical pattern that gives rise to
the growth of an ordered cell wall and twisting (17, 18). Given these conflicting views, a key
question that has emerged is whether spatial organization of MreB is important for cell shape
regulation. Furthermore, MreB structures have many different properties such that if MreB
organization is important for shape control, we must understand whether that is a result of the
amount of MreB, the length of the polymers, the orientation of the polymers, or other properties
of MreB.

Here we address these key outstanding questions by generating a better MreB fluorescent
fusion and using high-resolution, 3D imaging to quantitatively correlate MreB’s physical
properties with cell diameter across a range of MreB perturbations that also perturb shape. We
show that the only property of MreB that significantly correlates with cell diameter is the helical
pitch angle of MreB filaments. These results provide the first evidence that the structure and
organization of MreB filaments is important for defining cell shape. Our findings also support a
model for cell shape determination where the helical conformation of MreB polymers gives rise
to helical PG insertion, which in turn leads to different cell diameters due to changes in the
organization of the cell wall.

Results and Discussion
MreBmsfGFP is minimally perturbative

Previous live-cell fluorescence microscopy studies of MreB localization used fluorescent fusions
of YFP to the N-terminus of MreB or of mCherry inserted internally at a non-conserved surfaceexposed loop in the protein (12). Both of these strains suffered from physiological defects. The
N-terminal YFP fusion, which manifests as a single large helical filament, does not complement
a deletion of the MreB protein. On the other hand, the mCherry internal “sandwich” fusion yields
multiple small fluorescence structures and does rescue the viability of MreB deletion strains, but
frequently results in significant cell shape defects suggesting that it too disrupts MreB function
(Fig. S1).

Because mCherry has recently been shown to stimulate aggregation when fused to proteins
(13), we sought to find a better probe for live-cell studies by replacing the mCherry in the
sandwich fusion with 9 different fluorescent proteins, 6 of which have been shown to cause the
least amount of aggregation (Table S1, 13). The majority of the fluorescent proteins tested were
not able to restore rod shape in place of the sandwich fusion (Fig. S1). The fusion that
generated the most native cell shape was MreBmsfGFP (monomeric-super-folder-GFP) encoded
on the chromosome at the native mreB locus under native regulation.

We used two criteria to determine the level of perturbation that tagging MreB with msfGFP
would cause. First, the tagged strain should have the same growth rate as the untagged version
when grown in different media. We grew the fluorescently tagged and untagged strains in three
kinds of media: high-sucrose media (M-media), rich Luria Broth (LB), and a minimal media with
glucose and casamino acids (M63). MreBmsfGFP shows unperturbed growth rate in all media
when compared to the unlabeled wild type (Fig. S2). Both strains exhibited identical exponential
growth doubling times in all media, with doubling times of 19 minutes in M-media, 17 minutes in
LB, and 28 minutes in M63. Our second criterion was that the fluorescent fusion should
minimally alter cell width as we were primarily interested in studying MreB’s role in determining

!

cell shape. Using our custom cell-shape analysis software (see Materials and Methods), we
found that MreBmsfGFP is approximately 5% wider than the unlabeled parental strain and equally
as rod-shaped (Fig. S3). The average diameters of the unlabeled and labeled cells are
893±3 nm and 934±6 nm respectively (All values are reported as mean ± 80% confidence
interval). Using these two criteria, we conclude that the MreBmsfGFP fluorescent fusion is
minimally perturbative.

MreBmsfGFP forms ~500-nm long polymers along the cell cylinder
We next examined MreBmsfGFP and calculated its polymeric properties. Combining 3D imaging
with polymer detection and segmentation software developed in our lab, we were able to
calculate the size and orientation of MreB structures with respect to the 3D cell surface. We
used a previously-developed forward convolution fitting method to estimate the 3D cell shape of
cells stained with FM4-64 (14). Polymer detection was performed by fitting the 3D fluorescent
images of MreBmsfGFP with linear segments confined to lie on the measured surface of the cell
(Fig. 1A, Materials and Methods). This analysis revealed that MreB forms extended structures
that are larger than the diffraction limit. In M63 media, we measured the average polymer length
of MreBmsfGFP to be 500±10 nm(Fig. 2B). Examples of fits to both MreBmsfGFP structure and cell
shape are shown in Fig. 1B, with the surface color showing the fluorescence intensity of
MreBmsfGFP at each point on the surface, and the detected polymers shown in white. We
measured on average 7 polymers per cell and these polymers were mostly found in the
cylindrical portion of the cell and excluded from the cell poles (Fig. S4).

Our analysis also enabled us to determine the helical pitch angle of MreB polymers relative to
the cell long axis. Due to the effects of blurring by the microscope, pitch angle was only
calculated for polymers with a length greater than 300 nm. On average, MreBmsfGFP polymers
had a right-handed helical pitch angle of 91±1o. The angle is measured relative to the long axis

of the cell (Fig. 1C), with angles above 90o indicating a right-handed pitch (p=0.08).
Interestingly, the handedness reported is opposite of the left-handed polymers we previously
measured for E. coli using the non-complimenting N-terminal YFP fusion. Based on the
functionality of this fusion, we have a higher confidence that this measurement more faithfully
represents the normally unlabeled state of MreB and can be used as a basis for further study of
MreB function.

Generating different cell shapes by perturbing MreB
Armed with tools for the 3D quantification of cell shape and MreB polymer conformation in the
wild-type MreBmsfGFP strain, we sought to probe changes in bacterial cell shape due to the
perturbation of MreB. Amino acid substitutions and the application of the MreB polymerizationinhibiting drug A22 at sub-lethal concentrations both result in cell shape changes that are
directly linked to MreB. Although these treatments have been previously shown to cause
changes in cell shape, no studies have examined the biophysical properties of MreB polymers
to determine the cause of the observed cell shape modification.

A22 has been shown to inhibit rod shape through a specific interaction with MreB (8, 19).
Growing E. coli in the presence of different sub-lethal concentrations of A22 resulted in the
growth of cells with varying steady-state cell diameters (Fig. 3A). We used concentrations of
A22 up to 1 µg/mL because higher concentrations lead to high lethality and potential disruption
of nonspecific targets (20). Using this range of A22, we reproducibly generated cell populations
with stable steady-state diameters ranging from 934±6 nm without the drug to 1700±20 nm at
1 µg/mL. Each of these treatment conditions contain measurements ranging from 42 to 474
cells, with an average of 297 cells.

To generate MreB-dependent changes in cell shape genetically, we created a collection of
mutations in mreBmsfGFP. The simplest way to generate such a collection of mutations is by
selecting for A22-resistant suppressor mutations. Using this method, we isolated 12 different
MreB amino-acid substitutions in MreBmsfGFP which showed varying levels of A22 resistance.
Importantly, the mutations were distributed across 3 of MreB’s 4 subdomains (IA, IB, and IIA,
Fig. S5), indicating that the mutations likely perturb a range of MreB properties. We also used
site-directed mutagenesis to generate A53T and the deletion of the 53rd amino acid (ΔA53) as
this residue was previously shown to increase cell diameter depending on the amino acid
substitution (21). We grew all strains in M63 media with casamino acids and measured between
64 and 1228 cells (478 on average) for each of the 14 different mutations. These mutations
altered the average cell diameter compared to the wild type MreBmsfGFP during steady state
growth (Fig. 3B) generating cells ranging in diameter from 790±30 nm (thinner than wild type) to
1590±60 nm (wider than wild-type). Depending on the specific amino acid substitution, the
average MreB polymer length ranged between 328±7 nm to 690±50 nm (Fig. 4A).

MreB polymers in A22-treated cells and the effect of A22 on suppressor mutants
While high concentrations of A22 abolish MreB polymers (19, 22), the effect of sub-lethal
concentrations on MreB structure is not known. As expected, we find that MreB polymer length
is inversely correlated with the concentration of A22 in wild type cells when moderate amounts
of the drug are used (Fig. S6). Lengths ranged from 500±10 nm for untreated cells to
440±10 nm for cells at our maximum treatment level of 1 µg/ml. This result is consistent with
previous work showing that MreB bound to A22 weakens the inter-protofilament interaction (8,
19), decreasing the stability of MreB polymers.

We next examined A22 resistance and polymer length in each mutant. A22 resistance
increased with polymer length, likely due to specific amino acid substitutions leading to polymer

stabilization and a reduction in the turnover of MreB monomers (Fig. 4B). It has been
hypothesized that the ADP to A22 exchange happens in the post-ATP-hydrolysis monomeric
state (23). This would stabilize MreB states that promote an ATP-bound conformation and
would increase A22 resistance. The most A22-resistant mutant we isolated was E143A, which
was previously proposed to be deficient for ATP hydrolysis (22). The cell diameter for this strain
is 930±40 nm, identical to that of the unmutated strain, and it shows robust growth in A22
concentrations less than 100 µg/ml. Above this level, A22 begins to bind non-specifically to the
ATP pocket of other proteins which increases lethality (20). Future work on the MreBE143A
mutant could shed light on MreB function as it is currently thought that the turnover of MreB
monomers is physiologically necessary.

Correlation analysis between MreB polymeric properties and cell morphology
Our fluorescence analysis of dual-labeled cells yields a number of quantitative metrics of cell
shape and MreB polymer conformation. These include cell width, cell length, cell volume,
polymer number, polymer size, polymer helical pitch angle relative to the cell center line, and
the fraction of MreB that appears to reside on the inner membrane. We used a correlation
analysis of these quantitative metrics to investigate which properties of MreB were most
predictive of changes in cellular morphology (Fig. 5).

The two strongest correlations with cell diameter in both data sets are MreB helical pitch angle
and MreB polymer number. In order to analyze the significance of correlations that are
consistent between the two datasets, we combined the data from both treatment cases and
recalculated the correlation (Fig. 4C). The largest correlations were between cell diameter and
MreB polymer angle (-0.69, p=0.023) and between cell diameter and polymer number (0.76,
p<0.001). Both show significance p<0.05 after accounting for the effect of multiple comparisons.

MreB pitch angle is highly predictive of cell diameter for both A22 and mutant
experiments
The correlation between MreB polymer number and cell diameter is due to the coupling
between cell volume and number of MreB proteins. Cell volume is strongly correlated with cell
diameter and cells with more volume, and hence more total protein including MreB, create more
detectable polymers. This results in a significant correlation between polymer number and
diameter with correlation coefficients of 0.70 and 0.92 for the mutant and A22 treatment data
sets respectively. We also observed a reduction in the total number of MreB polymers as
polymer length increased, with an inverse correlation coefficient value of -0.71 and -0.64 for the
mutant and A22 treatment data sets respectively. This is expected as a larger percentage of
MreB is present in the longer polymers, decreasing the total number of short polymers. Thus,
polymer length and number correlations confirm previous findings that MreB assembly is
important but that these properties are not specifically informative with respect to cell diameter
control.

In contrast, the unexpected inverse correlation between MreB pitch angle and cell width across
all conditions tested yields new insight into shape control. We observed an inverse correlation
between MreB helical pitch angle and cell diameter, with correlation coefficients of -0.78
and -0.95 for the mutant and A22 treatment data sets respectively. The sign of this correlation
indicates that a reduction in pitch angle leads to an increase in the cell width. Interestingly the
average handedness of the polymers changed from the right-handed (93±1o) to left-handed
(84±3o) crossing 90o as cells get wider. This observation is in agreement with previous work
showing that the growth twist of E. coli switches handedness with increasing concentration of
A22 (18)

!

A22-specific correlations
We also observed correlations specific to the A22 treatment. We measured an inverse
correlation coefficient of -0.57 between MreB polymer length and cell diameter in the A22 data
treatment, but the same correlation was insignificant in the mutants (See Materials and Methods
for significance determination). The inconsistencies between the correlations from A22
treatment and the mutants are likely due to the mechanism by which A22 effects MreB
polymers, namely reducing the concentration of MreB monomers available for polymerization. In
the mutant data set, we see that mutants with longer polymers are more resistant to A22 with a
correlation coefficient of 0.62. Mutations that lead to longer polymers stabilize MreB in its
polymeric form and counteract the effects of A22.

The correlation between the fraction of MreB that is membrane bound and cell diameter shows
opposite correlations in the two data sets. For the A22 treatment, there is an increase in the
cytoplasmic portion of MreB as cell diameter increases, with a correlation coefficient of -0.80.
This is consistent with previous work that shows A22 increases the diffuse MreB monomer pool
by preventing polymerization (8). In the MreB mutant data set, the reverse trend is seen and the
membrane bound MreB fraction is positively correlated with cell diameter with a value of 0.69.
This contradiction suggests that the proportion of MreB localized on the membrane is not a
direct contributor to the determination of cell diameter.

A proposed mechanism for MreB-mediated helical growth
Prior to this study, we hypothesized that the helical pitch angle of MreB could help organize cell
wall synthesis in a manner that leads to chiral growth twist. Our simulations suggested that the
chiral order of the peptidoglycan would primarily alter cell diameter. At that time, we had no way
of making measurements of functional polymers, nor a way to alter the helical pitch angle of
MreB to test this hypothesis. Here we addressed both of those limitations by generating a

!

minimally-perturbative MreB fluorescent fusion, using 3D imaging and automated image
analysis to quantify both polymer and cell shape characteristics, and using both A22 treatment
and mutagenesis to alter MreB. Our analysis of correlations between all biophysical parameters
showed that cell diameter has a significant correlation with polymer angle regardless of
treatment with a correlation coefficient of -0.95 in the A22 data set and -0.78 in the mutants.
Both treatments lead to similar cell diameters for a measured angle (Fig. 4C), and a significant
correlation is observed across datasets. The similarity across these independently-derived sets
of MreB perturbation supports the conclusion that helical pitch is a key determinant of cell
diameter.

We hypothesize that the mutations and A22 treatment alter the mechanics of the interaction
between neighboring MreB monomers and/or between the MreB polymers and the cell
membrane, resulting in a change in the angle of the helical fragments relative to the curvature of
the cylindrical cell (24). In cells treated with A22, MreB mimics its ADP bound state (23). A22
treatment and mutations perturbing the nucleotide-binding pocket of MreB have the potential to
alter the geometry of the polymer as it has been shown that the angle between adjacent MreB
monomers depends on the state of the bound nucleotide (25). In addition, mutations in the
MreB-MreB binding surface or near the membrane-binding domain can directly affect the
structure of the polymer and higher-order filaments. These types of structural changes have
been shown to affect key parameters in the determination of the helical conformation of MreB,
such as the stiffness, bending angles, and twisting angles (24, 26), which could result in
polymers with different helical pitch angles inside the cell.

Changes in helical pitch angle can affect the chiral organization of the peptidoglycan cell wall
(17). It has been recently shown that as cells are treated with increasing amounts of A22, the
chirality of their cell wall shifts from right handed to left handed. Thus, changes in the MreB

!

12!

structure appear to propagate to the structure of the cell wall (18). Moreover, we observe not
only a change in the degree of the helical pitch angle, but also that the angles cross 90o,
indicating a change in handedness of the MreB. This consistency between our observed change
in handedness and the change in handedness of the MreB polymer motion and the cell growth
twist recently observed by Tropini et al. supports our model (18).

Conclusion
MreB was previously shown to be necessary for establishment and maintenance of rod shape in
its role localizing the cell wall insertion machinery. However, the mechanism via which rodshaped bacteria establish specific diameters remained unclear. Bacteria such as E. coli and B.
subtilis exhibit a chiral growth twist that is determined by the organization of the PG cell wall.
Here, we examined the biophysical properties of MreB polymers using 3D fluorescence
microscopy and a minimally inhibitory MreB fluorescent fusion. MreB mutations or treatment
with sub-lethal concentrations of A22 both lead to cell shape changes and changes to the
biophysical properties of MreB polymers. We detected a consistent correlation between MreB
helical pitch angle and cell diameter, suggesting that a major role of MreB is to set the cell
diameter by organizing a chiral cell wall structure. Importantly, these results indicate that rather
than simply acting as a scaffold to cluster various aspects of the cell growth machinery, proper
cell shape control requires MreB to form extended polymers and that the biophysical properties
of MreB polymers can dictate specific aspects of morphology such as cell diameter.

These results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that the helical pitch angle of MreB
dictates the chiral organization of the PG cell wall, and they allow us to build a model that links
the atomic-scale properties of MreB to the micron-scale cell shape. Specifically, we propose that
the MreB molecular structure determines the intrinsic morphology of the polymer and the helical
localization pattern of MreB on the cell membrane. This patterning regulates the chiral

!

organization of the cell wall, which in turn, contributes to the control of diameter of the cell as
new material is inserted heterogeneously into the pressure-strained cell wall. This work brings
new insights into the multiple functions of MreB. Not only is MreB essential for establishment
and maintenance of rod shape, but it helps establish the specific diameter of cells at steadystate growth.

Though we have shown one role for MreB in determining steady-state diameter, bacteria can
also dynamically adjust their morphology in response to environmental and internal conditions.
The final cell diameter is likely a complicated function of the MreB polymer angle, cell turgor
pressure, and details of PG insertion governed by growth rate and nutrient availability. It will be
interesting to see if there are similar principles connecting MreB and cell shape if width is
altered by changing other parameters such as pressure or growth rate. In addition to MreB,
there are a number of MreB-associating proteins. How these proteins interact with MreB and
influence its polymeric structure remains unclear. The division machinery also likely plays a role
in the determination of cell diameter (27), and it may be possible to investigate this by
performing experiments similar to those described here with the tubulin homolog FtsZ.

Materials and methods
Construction of MreBmsfGFP
The construction of MreBmsfGFP was previously described (14). The specific MG1655 strain
differs from that precious work as we found that there are physiological and metabolic
differences between MG1655 strains in different labs, presumably from accumulation of
genomic mutations over time. For this reason, we chose to use MG1655 that could be traced to
back to the Yale Coli Genetic Stock Center. We moved the csrD-kanR-mreBmsfGFP-mreCD
operon from our previous MG1655 to MG1655 (CGSC #7740) using the lambda red method

followed by selection for kanamycin resistance (28). Colonies were picked and screened using
fluorescence microscopy and then sequenced.

Media conditions
Multiple media compositions are used for comparison of cell shape between fluorescently
labeled and unlabeled MreB strains. The three media used are M media, Lysogeny broth with
5g NaCl per liter and M63 with glucose and casamino acids (29, 30). All measurements of MreB
polymers and cell shape were conducted in M63 media. Kanamycin sulfate (sigma) at 20 ug/mL
was used in overnight cultures and plating, but was not used in subcultures used for imaging.

Selection of mutants
Individual colonies of MreBmsfGFP were grown overnight. Cultures were spread the following day
on LB plates containing 30 µg/mL kanamycin, 1.5 µg/mL cephalexin, and 10 µg to 35 µg A22.
We find that 1.5 µg/mL cephalexin aids in the selection of A22 suppressors since cells that lose
MreB function are hypersensitive to cephalexin. Individual colonies that grow on the plates were
grown in liquid for imaging and mreB was sequenced to identify mutations.

A22 resistance quantification
Each strain was grown in a 96 well plate in LB containing serial dilution of A22 ranging from 100
to 0 µg A22. We used a BioTek™ microplate reader to record the OD600 over 16 hours of
growth at 37oC. The A22 resistance of each MreB mutant was calculated by its IC50.

Imaging of mreB mutants
Strains were grown over night at 37oC in M63 media in the presence of Kanamycin in order to
prevent contamination. The next morning, cultures were subcultured in the morning to 1:10000
to 1:30000. When OD600 of the culture is between 0.15 to 0.3 cells are imaged on 1%

!

UltraPure™ Agarose (life technologies) pads made of M63 media. Imaging was conducted in a
20oC temperature-controlled room on a custom-built inverted wide field fluorescent microscope
with a 1.43NA 100x objective (Nikon). Images for stacks were taken at 100 nm increments in
stage position.

A22 treatment imaging
MreBmsfGFP strain was grown over night at 37oC in the presence of Kanamycin in order to
prevent contamination. The next morning, cultures were subcultured to 1:10000-1:30000 in the
presence of A22 at concentrations of 0 µg, 0.125 µg, 0.25 µg, 0.5ug, 0.75 µg and 1 µg A22.
When OD600 of the culture was between 0.15 to 0.3, cells were imaged on 1% UltraPure™
Agarose (life technologies) pads made of M63 media containing the same concentration of A22
as the liquid media. Imaging was then conducted in the same manner as with the mreB
mutants.

3D cell shape reconstruction
Cell shapes were measured by fitting 3-dimensional images of cells stained with FM4-64 with an
active mesh in MATLAB (Mathworks). An initial surface is found by fitting a series of active
contours to axial slices of the cell (31). Convolving the surface with the 3-dimensional pointspread function (PSF) of our microscope creates a test image that can be compared directly to
the image stack from the microscope. The surface is then iteratively deformed to minimize the
square difference between the simulated image and the real image (32). The PSF was
measured by averaging image stacks of multiple individual 0.1-µm TetraSpeck™ microspheres
imaged at 100 nm steps in the axial direction.

MreB polymer measurements

!

16!

Polymers were measured by fitting the 3-dimensional MreB images to a set of polymers
confined to the membrane. Using the surface determined by the membrane fitting, a
2-dimensional unwrapped image of the MreB polymers is created. Segmentation is performed
on this image to determine the number, location, and initial length of the polymers on the
surface. Each polymer is modeled by an active contour confined to the membrane and then
deformed to fit the 3D MreB image. The polymer positions are convolved with the PSF to create
a simulated MreB image. Once again, the polymers deform to minimize the square difference
between the simulated image and the image from the microscope. The length of the polymer is
measured in 3D and the polymer angle is measured as the angle away from the circumferential
direction, with positive angles corresponding to a right handed helical pitch and negative angles
corresponding to a left handed helix.

The surface is then used to calculate measurements of cell shape such as length, volume and
diameter. Radius is measured as the average distance from the surface to the centerline after
the removal of the pole regions. Membrane fraction is measured by comparing the MreB image
to that of the FM4-64 image and a simulated image in which the cell envelope is filled with
uniformly distributed fluorophore. After the poles are removed, axial projections along the
centerline of each of the images are taken and then a radial projection is performed on this. The
MreB projected image is represented as a linear combination of the normalized FM4-64
membrane projection and the filled simulation. The fraction of MreB on the membrane is the
weighting term of the membrane projection.

Correlation significance testing
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze relationships between different datasets.
In order to determine if correlations between two parameters were significant, we compared our
data to a noise model in which both datasets were shuffled 10,000 times to create a distribution

!

of correlation values. Correlations were significant if the values were within the 99.67th
percentile of the noise distribution, which is equivalent to p <0.05 after accounting for multiple
hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni Correction with 15 tests.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Cell shape and polymer fitting. (A) Diagram outlining the cell shape and polymer fitting
algorithm. Cells expressing MreBmsfGFP under native regulation are membrane stained with FM464 and imaged using fluorescent microscopy. The imaging process can be written as a
convolution between the point-spread function (PSF) of the microscope and the spatial
distribution of fluorescent molecules, in this case the membrane. To estimate the shape of the
surface, a model cell is convolved with the PSF to create a simulated image. The surface is
relaxed so that the simulated image best matches the experimental image. A similar process is
used to fit the MreB polymers. An initial segmentation is performed to estimate the initial number
of polymers. Each polymer is modeled as a stiff elastic rod confined to the surface of the
membrane. Again, a simulated MreB image is created and model filaments relax to best match
the experimental image. The angle of the MreB filaments are measured from as the average
angle of the filament relative to the axial direction of the cell. (B) Representative surface fits of
cells expressing MreBmsfGFP. The surfaces are fit from 3-dimensional images of FM4-64 stained
cells. The color of the surface is determined by interpolating the intensity of the 3D MreB image
at the points of the surface. The detected polymers are shown in white. (C) Figure showing the
measurement of angle of the polymers. After fitting the polymers to the 3D image, the polymer
angle is measured in an unwrapped space as the angle the polymer makes away from the
cylindrical axis of the cell. Angles larger than 90o indicate a right-handed helical pitch.

Figure 2. Probability density functions of (A) cell diameter, (B) MreB polymer lengths, and (C)
MreB polymer angles in E. coli expressing MreBmsfGFP. Data is derived from 459 cells, with an
average of 7.3 polymers detected per cell. The distribution in (A) shows an average diameter of
934±6. The average MreB polymer length was 500±10 nm . The angle distribution of monomers
in (C) is made by weighting the angle distribution of polymers by the length of each polymer,
and had a mean angle of of 91±1o. All values are shown as mean ± 80% CI.

Figure 3. Two independent methods to perturb cell diameter. (A) Cells expressing MreBmsfGFP
were grown to steady state in different concentrations of the MreB-polymerization-inhibiting drug
A22. All treatments are below the lethal concentrations of A22. As A22 concentration increases,
cells significantly increase their diameter. (B) Cell diameter can also be changed with single
point mutants in the mreBmsfGFP. 14 mutants were generated with diameters both larger and
smaller than the unmutated form (WT). Mutants are arranged in order of increasing diameter.
Error bars represent 80% confidence intervals.

Figure 4. MreB polymer measurements. (A) MreB mutations can alter the MreB polymer length.
In some cases the polymer length is increased with respect of wild type and in other cases the
polymer length is decreased. Mutations are arranged as in Figure 2A, in order of increasing
average cell diameter. Error bars represent 80% confidence intervals. (B) MreB polymer length
correlates with the level of A22 resistance of the MreB mutants. Mutations that have longer
polymers have high levels of A22 resistance while increased sensitivity to A22 is seen in
mutations that have shorter polymers. A22 resistance levels are shown as a fold changes from
wild-type MreBmsfGFP, with levels capped at 100-times that of wild-type since higher levels of A22
can effect proteins other than MreB. (C) The average polymer angle inversely correlates with
the cell diameter in both mreB mutant data (Black) and A22 treatment data (Green). The cell
diameter increases as the average helical pitch angle of MreB decreases. The handedness of
the helical pitch changes in both data sets as 90o is crossed. Unperturbed MreBmsfGFP is
indicated by the A22 treatment with the smallest diameter.

Figure 5. Cell shape was modified using either point mutants in mreBmsfGFP or treatment with
sublethal concentrations of A22. Correlation maps between cell shape metrics and measured
MreB properties were created for each set of conditions: (A) Mutants (15 conditions), (B) A22

Figure S1. The MG1655 mreB deletion strain was complemented with a plasmid
containing the MreB operon in which MreB is labeled with different fluorescent fusions to
MreB. The florescent proteins that have been previously shown to cause the least
amount of dimerization are msfGFP, mVenus, mGFPmut3, Dendra 2, Dronpa, and
meGFP. msfGFP was best able to complement rod shape and had optimal quantum
yield for prolonged imaging. Venus is known to form dimers and both dsRed and E2Crimson form tetramers. Each fusion is imaged using phase microscopy (top row) and
fluorescence microscopy (bottom row).
