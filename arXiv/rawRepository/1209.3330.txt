sands of birds, seemingly without any form of leadership [2, 3]. During their monthly breeding seasons, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) aggregate
into schools comprising hundreds of millions of fish to
spawn offspring [4]. Perhaps most notoriously, desert
locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) form massive swarms
with billions of locusts that devastate entire agricultural zones in Africa, the Near East, and southwest
Asia [5].
While swarm-like aggregations could arise for relatively simple reasons, e.g., to converge on a common
resource [6], in many cases swarms are formed via behavioral mechanisms that coordinate the movements
of individuals to ensure group cohesion [7]. Since
swarming may incur a variety of fitness costs (e.g., increased attack rate from predators on larger swarms),
considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the compensatory benefits of swarming [8]. Many
such benefits have been proposed: Swarming may
improve mating success [9, 10], increase foraging efficiency [11], and provide distributed information processing abilities [1]. In this study, we focus on swarming as a defense against predation [8].
Evolved swarm behaviors could protect group
members from predators in several ways. For example, swarming improves group vigilance [12–15],
reduces the chance of being encountered by predators [15, 16], dilutes an individual’s risk of being
attacked [17–19], enables an active defense against
predators [20], and reduces predator attack efficiency
by confusing the predator [21, 22]. Given the long
generation times of many of the animals involved
(months to years), it is exceedingly difficult to discern which of these benefits, if any, are sufficient to
produce swarming as an evolutionary response, let
alone study the properties of swarm behaviors as they
evolve [22, 23].
To address this challenge, we investigate the evolutionary origins of swarming behavior in a digital
system. Digital systems have previously been used

Swarming behaviors in animals have been extensively studied due to their implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition, and predatorprey dynamics. An important goal of these studies
is discerning which evolutionary pressures favor the
formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that swarms
arise because the presence of multiple moving prey
in swarms causes confusion for attacking predators,
but it remains unclear how important this selective
force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predatorprey system, we show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the evolutionary effect of predator confusion on
prey could in turn exert pressure on the structure of
the predator’s visual field, favoring the frontally oriented, high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on swarming animals.
Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve
swarming in response to predator confusion, there is
a change in the shape of the functional response curve
describing the predator’s consumption rate as prey
density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively
simple perceptual constraint—predator confusion—
could have pervasive evolutionary effects on prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions between predators and prey.

Introduction

The sudden emergence of a cohesive swarm from
the behavioral decisions of individual animals is one
of nature’s most striking examples of collective animal behavior [1]. For example, European starlings
(Sturnus vulgaris) are known to form spectacular,
coordinated flocks composed of hundreds of thou1

to provide key insights into core evolutionary processes [24, 25], and several well-known studies have
adopted digital systems as a method to study swarm
behavior [26–28]. More recently, digital systems have
even been used to elucidate the emergence of prey
swarming behavior as a response to predation [29].
These previous studies have provided insight into the
fundamental dynamics of swarming behavior. However, most have not focused on isolating the evolutionary pressures that might favor the formation of
swarms, and none have explored the coevolution of
predator and prey behavior. In fact, except for only
a handful of studies [30–34], this literature typically
has not studied Darwinian evolution as a process affecting the properties of swarms. Here, we present a
model in which predators and groups of genetically
homogeneous prey are coevolved in a two-dimensional
virtual environment. Predators are endowed with
a retina that enables them to observe prey, while
prey are equipped with a retina that enables them to
sense both conspecifics and predators. In this model,
predator and prey are preferentially selected based on
how effective they are at consuming prey and surviving, respectively. Swarming is a possible solution for
the prey, but is not selected for directly.
While there are many different selective pressures
that have been hypothesized to produce swarming
behavior, within this digital environment we specifically study the evolution of swarming in the presence of predator confusion. In the predator confusion hypothesis, the presence of multiple individuals moving in a swarm confuses approaching predators, making it difficult for them to successfully execute an attack [21, 22, 35, 36]. In a recent review of
predator-prey systems with swarming prey, Jeschke
and Tollrian noted that predators appeared to become confused by swarming behavior in 16 of the 25
systems reviewed [22]. However, evidence that predator confusion is a seemingly widespread phenomenon
still leaves open the question of how effective predator confusion could be as a selective force favoring the
evolution of swarming behavior.
Predator confusion is broadly interesting for two
additional reasons. First, it provides an opportunity
to study how swarming behavior can in turn exert
evolutionary pressures on predators, especially on the
perceptual constraints that allow for predator confusion in the first place. For example, once swarming behavior evolves in prey, predator confusion may
in turn provide a selective advantage for predators
that are no longer confused by swarms. Second,
predator confusion may influence the functional response describing the predator’s consumption rate as
prey density increases [37], as suggested in a previous

study [38]. Understanding how pervasive mechanisms
such as predator confusion affect functional response
relationships is critical for accurately modeling the
dynamics of predator-prey interactions over ecological and evolutionary time [39].
The contributions of this work are as follows. First,
we demonstrate that the predator confusion effect
provides a sufficient selective advantage for prey to
evolve swarming behavior. Furthermore, given prey
that swarm as a result of the predator confusion effect, we show that predators could in turn be selected
to evolve a frontally-oriented, high-resolution visual
field. Finally, we provide evidence that the shape of
the predator functional response curve can be affected
when prey evolve swarming behavior in response
to the predator confusion effect. Consequently, we
demonstrate that predator confusion could have extensive evolutionary effects on traits ranging from
prey behavior to predator sensory mechanisms, as
well as the ecological interactions between predators
and prey.

Methods

To study the effects of predator confusion on the evolution of swarming, we create an agent-based simulation in which predator and prey agents interact
in a continuous two-dimensional virtual environment.
Each agent is controlled by a Markov Network (MN),
which is a stochastic state machine that makes control decisions based on a combination of sensory input
(i.e., vision) and internal states (i.e., memory) [40].
We coevolve the MNs of predators and prey with a
genetic algorithm, selecting for MNs that exhibit behaviors that are more effective at consuming prey and
surviving, respectively. Certain properties of the sensory and motor behavior of predators and prey are
implemented as constraints that model some of the
differences between predators and prey observed in
nature (e.g., relative movement speed, turning agility,
and, for predators, maximum consumption rate).
Predator confusion, described in more detail below, is
implemented as a constraint on predator perception
that can be varied experimentally. The source code1
and data2 for these experiments are available online.
In the remainder of this section, we summarize the
evolutionary process that enables the coevolution of
predator and prey, describe the sensory-motor architecture of individual agents, then present the characteristics of the environment in which predator and
prey interact. A detailed description of MNs and how

Figure 1: An illustration of the predator and prey
agents in the model. Light grey triangles are prey
agents and the dark grey triangle is a predator agent.
The predator and prey agents have a 180◦ limiteddistance retina (100 virtual meters for the prey
agents; 200 virtual meters for the predator agent) to
observe their surroundings and detect the presence
of the predator and prey agents. Each agent has its
own Markov Network, which decides where to move
next based off of a combination of sensory input and
memory. The left and right actuators (labeled “L”
and “R”) enable the agents to move forward, left,
and right in discrete steps.
Once we evaluate all of the predator-prey
genome pairs in a generation, we perform fitnessproportionate selection on the populations via a
Moran process, allow the selected genomes to asexually reproduce into the next generation’s populations, increment the generation counter, and repeat
the evaluation process on the new populations until
the final generation (1,200) is reached.
We perform 180 replicates of each experiment,
where for each replicate we seed the prey population with a set of randomly-generated MNs and
the predator population with a pre-evolved predator
MN that exhibits rudimentary prey-tracking behavior. Seeding the predator population in this manner
only serves to speed up the coevolutionary process,
and has negligible effects on the outcome of the experiment (Figure S1).

We coevolve the predator and prey with a genetic algorithm (GA), which is a digital model of evolution
by natural selection [41]. In a GA, pools of genomes
are evolved over time by evaluating the fitness of each
genome at each generation and preferentially selecting those with higher fitness to populate the next generation. The genomes here are variable-length strings
of integers that are translated into MNs during fitness
evaluation (see SI text).
To perform this coevolution, we create separate
genome pools for the predator and prey genomes.
Next, we evaluate the genomes’ fitness by selecting
pairs of predator and prey genomes at random without replacement, then place each pair into a simulation environment and evaluate them for 2,000 simulation time steps. Within this simulation environment,
we generate 50 identical prey agents from the single prey genome and compete them with the single
predator agent to obtain their respective fitness. This
evaluation period is akin to the agents’ lifespan, hence
each agent has a potential lifespan of 2,000 time steps
(enough time for the prey to travel approximately 400
body lengths). The fitness values, calculated using
the fitness function described below, are used to determine the next generation of the respective genome
pools. Parameters describing the operation of this
GA are summarized in Table S1. At the end of the
lifetime simulation, we assign the predator and prey
genomes separate fitness values according to the fitness functions:

where t is the current simulation time step, S is the
starting swarm size (here, S = 50), and At is the
number of prey agents alive at simulation time step
t. It can be shown that the predator fitness (Eq. 1) is
proportional to the mean kill rate k (mean number of
prey consumed per time step), while the prey fitness
(Eq. 2) is proportional to (1 − k). Thus, predators
are awarded higher fitness for capturing more prey
faster, and prey are rewarded for surviving longer. 2.2 Predator and prey agents

where they are under predation because we are inves- Figure 1 depicts the sensory-motor architecture of

organized into “layers,” where a layer includes 12 sensors, with each sensor having a field of view of 15◦ and
a range of 100 virtual meters (200 virtual meters for
predators). Moreover, each layer is attuned to sensing a specific type of agent. Specifically, the predator
agents have a single-layer retina that is only capable
of sensing prey. In contrast, the prey agents have
a dual-layer retina, where one layer is able to sense
conspecifics, and the other senses the predator. (We
note that there is only a single predator active during
each simulation, hence the lack of a predator-sensing
retinal layer for the predator agent.)
Regardless of the number of agents present in a
single retina slice, the agents only know the agent
type(s) that reside within that slice, but not how
many, representing the wide, relatively coarse-grain
visual systems typical in swarming birds such as Starlings [42]. For example in Figure 1, the furthest-right
retina slice has two prey in it (light grey triangles), so
the prey sensor for that slice activates. Similarly, the
sixth retina slice from the left has both a predator
(dark grey triangle) and a prey (light grey triangle)
agent in it, so both the predator and prey sensors
activate and inform the MN that one or more predators and one or more prey are currently in that slice.
Lastly, since the prey near the 4th retina slice from
the left is just outside the range of the retina slice, the
prey sensor for that slice does not activate. We note
that although the agent’s sensors do not report the
number of agents present in a single retina slice, this
constraint does not preclude the agent’s MN from
evolving and making use of a counting mechanism
which reports the number of agents present in a set
of retina slices. Once provided with its sensory information, the prey agent chooses one of four discrete
actions: (1) stay still; (2) move forward 1 unit; (3)
turn left 8◦ while moving forward 1 unit; or (4) turn
right 8◦ while moving forward 1 unit.
Likewise, the predator agent detects nearby prey
agents using a limited-distance (200 virtual meters),
pixelated retina covering its frontal 180◦ that functions just like the prey agent’s retina. Similar to the
prey agents, predator agents make decisions about
where to move next, but the predator agents move
3x faster than the prey agents and turn correspondingly slower (6◦ per simulation time step) due to their
higher speed.

tions inside a closed 512 × 512 unit two-dimensional
simulation environment. Each of the 50 prey agents
are controlled by clonal MNs of the particular prey
MN being evaluated. We evaluate the swarm with
clonal MNs to eliminate any possible effects of selection on the individual level, e.g., the “selfish herd”
effect [30, 32].
During each simulation time step, we provide all
agents their sensory input, update their MN, then allow the MN to make a decision about where to move
next. When the predator agent moves within 5 virtual meters of a prey agent it can see, it automatically
makes an attack attempt on that prey agent. If the
attack attempt is successful, the target prey agent
is removed from the simulation and marked as consumed. Predator agents are limited to one attack attempt every 10 simulation time steps, which is called
the handling time. The handling time represents the
time it takes to consume and digest a prey after successful prey capture, or the time it takes to refocus
on another prey in the case of an unsuccessful attack
attempt. Shorter handling times have negligible effects on the outcome of the experiment, except for
when there is no handling time at all (Figure S2).
To investigate predator confusion as an indirect selection pressure driving the evolution of swarming,
we implement a perceptual constraint on the predator agent. When the predator confusion mechanism
is active, the predator agent’s chance of successfully
capturing its target prey agent (Pcapture ) is dimin-

Simulation environment

We use a simulation environment to evaluate the relative performance of the predator and prey agents. At
the beginning of every simulation, we place a single
predator agent and 50 prey agents at random loca4

ished when any prey agents near the target prey agent
are visible anywhere in the predator’s visual field.
This perceptual constraint is similar to previous models of predator confusion based on observations from
natural predator-prey systems [21, 22, 38], where the
predator’s attack efficiency (# successful attacks /
total # attacks) is reduced when attacking swarms
of higher density. Pcapture is determined by the equation:
Pcapture =

ANV

(3)

where ANV is the number of prey agents that are visible to the predator, i.e., anywhere in the predator
agent’s visual field, and within 30 virtual meters of
the target prey. By only counting prey near the target prey, this mechanism localizes the predator confusion effect to the predator’s retina, and enables us
to experimentally control the strength of the predator confusion effect. Although our predator confusion
model is based on the predator’s retina, it is functionally equivalent to previous models that are based
on the total swarm size (Figure 2, dashed line), e.g.,
in [21,22,38,43]. As shown in Figure 2 (solid line with
triangles), the predator has a 50% chance of capturing a prey with one visible prey near the target prey
(ANV = 2), a 33% chance of capturing a prey with
two visible prey near the target prey (ANV = 3), etc.
As a consequence, prey are in principle able to exploit the combined effects of predator confusion and
handling time by swarming.

Results
Effects of Predator Confusion

Qualitatively, we observed significant differences in
prey behavior over the course of evolution between
swarms experiencing predators with and without
predator confusion. Figure 3A illustrates that prey
hunted by a predator without the predator confusion
mechanism dispersed as much as possible to escape
the predator. No replicates containing a predator
without predator confusion resulted in prey behavior
that resembled a cohesive swarm. Conversely, when
evolution occurred with predator confusion, prey exhibited cohesive swarm behavior in the majority of
the replicates (70% of our replicates). Figure 3B depicts one such swarm in which prey follow the conspecific directly in front of them, resulting in an elongated swarm. Similarly, Figure 3C shows another
swarm where the prey circle around their nearest conspecific, resulting in multiple small, cohesive swarms
with the prey constantly trying to circle around each

other. Both of these swarms evolved as defensive behaviors to exploit the predator confusion effect.
Furthermore, predators exhibited divergent hunting behaviors when hunting prey with and without
predator confusion. As seen in Figure 3A, predators
that evolved in the absence of predator confusion,
and hence had to contend with dispersed prey, simply tracked the nearest visible prey until it was captured, then immediately pursued the next nearest visible prey. On the other hand, predators that evolved
in the presence of predator confusion, and hence were
challenged with cohesive swarms, used a mechanism
that causes them to attack prey on the outer edges
of the swarm. This strategy is similar to a predatory
behavior observed in many natural systems [45, 46],
and effectively minimized the number of prey in the
predator’s retina and maximized its chance of capturing prey. Figure 3B demonstrates this behavior,
where the predator just captured a prey on the topright edge of the swarm (prey capture location denoted by a black star). Videos of the evolved swarms
under predation are available in the supplementary
information (SI videos 1-5).
To evaluate the evolved swarms quantitatively, we
obtained the line of descent (LOD) for every replicate
by tracing the ancestors of the most-fit prey MN in
the final population until we reached the randomlygenerated ancestral MN with which the starting population was seeded (see [24] for an introduction to the
concept of a LOD in the context of digital evolution).
For each ancestor in the LOD, we characterized the
swarm behavior with two common behavior measurements: swarm density and swarm dispersion [47]. We
measured the swarm density as the mean number of
prey within 30 virtual meters of each other over a
lifespan of 2,000 simulation time steps. The swarm’s
dispersion was computed by averaging the distance to
the nearest prey for every living prey over a lifespan
of 2,000 simulation time steps. Together, these metrics captured whether or not the prey were cohesively
swarming.
Figure 4A demonstrates that the prey hunted by a
predator with only handling time (i.e., without predator confusion) moved close to each other by chance
but never coordinated their movement at any point in
their evolutionary history (mean swarm density ± 1
standard error across 180 replicates: 0.69 ± 0.02). In
contrast, when hunted by a predator with predator
confusion, the prey coordinated their movement to
remain close to each other and form a swarm (mean
swarm density 12.48 ± 0.8 at generation 1,200). Likewise, Figure 4B shows that in the absence of predator
confusion, prey evolved to maximize their dispersion

was measured by the mean number of prey within 30
virtual meters of each other over a lifespan of 2,000
simulation time steps. Swarm dispersion was measured by the mean distance to the nearest prey for every living prey over a lifespan of 2,000 simulation time
steps. Survivorship within the swarm was measured
as the mean number of surviving prey (out of an initial total of 50) at the end of the simulation at a given
generation. Prey hunted by a predator with predator
confusion (black circles with a full line) evolved to
maintain significantly higher swarm density and significantly less dispersed swarming behavior than prey
in the swarms hunted by a predator without predator
confusion (grey triangles with a dashed line). As a result, significantly more prey survived in the swarms
hunted by a predator with predator confusion than
the swarms hunted by a predator without predator
confusion. Error bars indicate two standard errors

1,200), whereas with predator confusion, prey evolved
increasingly cohesive swarm behavior (mean shortest
distance 22.54 ± 1.32 at generation 1,200). Taken together, these results confirm that predator confusion
provided a sufficient selection pressure to evolve cohesive swarming behavior in this model, even though
the swarming prey actually experience an increased
attack rate from the predator due to this behavior
(Figure S3 & S4).
Figure 4C shows that as a result of these evolutionary trends, the cohesive swarms that evolved
under predator confusion experienced significantly
higher survivorship than swarms that evolved without predator confusion (34.7 ± 0.6 and 25.54 ± 0.49
prey surviving the simulations, respectively). This increased survivorship confirms that swarming behavior confused the predator, leading to fewer successful
prey captures. We found these results robust to a
variety of experimental parameters, including weaker
predator confusion effects (Figure S5 & S6) and applying a minimum threshold to predator attack efficiency (Figure S7).

or less, due to the predator’s focused retina. As the
predator’s visual field was incrementally increased to
cover the frontal 90◦ and beyond, predator confusion
via swarming again became an effective anti-predator
behavior, as evidenced by the swarms exhibiting significantly higher swarm density at generation 1,200.

Evolved Predator and Prey Behavior

from moderately dispersed, elongated swarms similar to Starling murmurations (Figure 3B) to tighlypacked cohesive swarms reminiscent of fish bait balls
(Figure 3C).
As for the predators, the evolved behavior we
observed at generation 1,200 with predator confusion appeared to be rather complex: The predators
avoided dense swarms and hunted prey outside, or
on the edge, of the swarm. However, the algorithm
underlying this behavior was relatively simple. The
predators only watched the two center retina slices
and constantly turned in one direction until a prey
entered one of those slices. Once a prey became visible in one of the center retina slices, the predator
moved forward and pursued that prey until it made a
capture attempt. This process was repeated regardless of whether the predator successfully captured
the prey. The simplicity of the predator algorithm
and relative simplicity of the prey algorithms supports the findings of earlier digital swarm studies that
complex swarm behaviors can be described by simple rules applied over a group of locally-interacting
agents [48, 49].

To deduce how swarms emerge in our model from
individual-level behaviors, we next determined the
functionality of the evolved predator and prey MNs.
We accomplished this by first visualizing the MN connectivity to discern which slices of the retina and
memory nodes of the MN were causally connected,
then created a truth table from the MN mapping every possible input combination with its corresponding
most-likely output from the MN. With this inputoutput mapping, we computed the minimal descriptive logic of the MN with Logic Friday, a hardware
logic minimization program. We used the mostlikely output for every input combination due to the
stochastic nature of MNs, therefore the functionality
we determined was the most-likely behavior of the
predator or prey.
In all of our experiments, the prey at generation
1,200 ignored the presence of predators and instead
only reacted to the presence of conspecifics in their
retina in order to follow the other prey in the swarm.
This was particularly striking because it suggested
that prey can evolve swarming behavior in response
to predation without the ability to sense the predators hunting them, which was suggested in a previous study [29]. We observed that the prey evolved
a wide variety of simple algorithms that exhibited a
diversity of emergent swarming behaviors3 , ranging

near the target prey are visible to the predator.
This is meant to simulate the difficulty, arising from
attentional or cognitive limitations, that a biological predator might have in choosing among multiple
available prey at the moment of attack. To examine
the effect of relaxing this constraint, we coevolved the
predator and prey again and experimentally reduced
the size of the predator’s field of view. This procedure reduces the possibility that multiple prey can be
detected at the moment of attack, thereby reducing
the probability of confusion. For example, experimentally decreasing the predator’s field of view from
180◦ to 60◦ decreases by two-thirds the area within
which the presence of multiple prey can confuse the
predator.
Figure 5 demonstrates that when the predator’s
retina only covered the frontal 60◦ or less, swarming to confuse the predator was no longer a viable
adaptation (as indicated by a mean swarm density
of 0.68 ± 0.02 at generation 1,200). In this case,
the predator had such a narrow view angle that few
swarming prey were visible during an attack, which
minimizes the confusion effect and correspondingly
increases its capture rate (Figure S8). As the predator’s retina was incrementally modified to cover the
frontal 120◦ and beyond, swarming again became an
effective adaptation against the predator due to the
confusion effect (indicated by a mean swarm density
of 6.13±0.76 at generation 1,200). This suggests that
the predator confusion mechanism may not only provide a selective pressure for the prey to swarm, but it
could also provide a selective pressure for the predator to narrow its view angle to become less easily
confused.

time also lowers the plateau of the Type II functional
response (Figure S9).

Discussion

We demonstrated that swarming evolves as an emergent behavior in prey when a simple perceptual
constraint—predator confusion—is imposed on the
predator. Further, we found that measuring swarm
density and swarm dispersion, proposed in [47], serves
as an effective substitute for qualitatively assessing every swarm to determine if cohesive swarming
behavior is present. A diverse collection of prey
swarming behaviors evolved in our model, suggesting that predator confusion could allow for a wide
range of swarming behaviors to evolve. Strikingly,
most evolved prey strategies used algorithms that responded to other prey, but not to the attacking predators. This raises the interesting question of what selection pressures would favor the evolution of prey
that detect and respond to the predators themselves.
In contrast to the diversity of evolutionary outcomes for prey, a common behavioral strategy
emerged among the predators when evolved in the
confusion condition. Namely, the evolved predators
focused on attacking prey on the vulnerable edges of
the swarms, which is a phenomenon commonly observed in nature [45, 46].
We also found that we could reduce the advantage

Effects on Functional Response

Predator confusion has been hypothesized to be not
only a selective pressure favoring swarming, but also
as a determinant of the functional response [38], i.e.,
the number of prey consumed by the predator as a
function of prey density [44]. Figure 6 supports a
key prediction of functional response theory: Both
with and without predator confusion, the system displayed a Type II functional response (a saturating
effect of prey density), but when predator confusion
was present the functional response showed a lower
plateau (24.01±0.49 prey consumed without predator
confusion; 15.18±0.57 with predator confusion). The
fact that there was a Type II functional response even
in the condition without predator confusion was the
result of an additional constraint present in both conditions: The handling time that was imposed on the
predator after prey capture before it can attack again.

of swarming by diminishing the predator’s field of
view, hence decreasing the level of confusion affecting
the predator. This suggests that predator confusion
could impose a selective pressure on the shape of the
predator’s retina: Once swarming has evolved in the
prey, selection will favor predators that are no longer
confused by swarms. Following the trend in Figure 5,
we would expect selection to favor predators with a
narrower, more frontally focused retina, as observed
in the visual systems of many natural predators [50].
Modeling functional response has been an important problem in ecology [51], and is critical for constructing accurate models that capture the dynamics of predator-prey interactions over ecological and
evolutionary time [52]. We provided evidence that
predator confusion has significant effects on functional response that are not captured in traditional
models [38]. Most of these traditional models, including the original formulation of Holling [37], capture
the ecological interaction between predator and prey.
Evolution is assumed to shape the behavioral strategies and constraints that influence predator-prey dynamics, but only recently have biologists begun to explicitly study the dynamics of predator-prey interactions over both ecological and evolutionary time [39].
We have shown that a Type II functional response
evolves even when it is not directly selected for, and
the shape of the functional response can be attributed
to specific constraints such as handling time and
predator confusion.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that predator confusion provides
a sufficient selective advantage for prey to evolve
swarming behavior in a digital evolutionary model.
This suggests that predator confusion likely contributed to the evolution of swarming behavior in
animals which were hunted by predators that relied
on visual systems to track their prey. Furthermore,
in this work we (1) proposed a new method to directly test hypotheses about the evolution of swarming behavior, (2) provided an example of how to apply this method, and (3) demonstrated that by considering swarming behavior in the context of evolution, we are able to make discoveries about swarming
behavior that were never previously considered. Of
course, there are many other evolutionary pressures
that have been hypothesized to lead to the evolution
of swarming behavior [8], such as the “selfish herd”
effect [30, 32], that remain to be explored in future
work. Our results suggest that digital evolutionary
systems can provide a powerful tool to tease apart
