Recently, a three-state model is presented to describe the intracellular traffic of
unconventional (single-headed) kinesin KIF1A [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 118101 (2005)],
in which each motor can bind strongly or weakly to its microtubule track, and each
binding site of the track might be empty or occupied by one motor. As the usual
two-state model, i.e. the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with
motor detachment and attachment, in steady state of the system, this three-state
model also exhibits shock (or domain wall separating the high-density and low density
phases) and boundary layers. In this study, using mean-field analysis, the conditions
of existence of shock and boundary layers are obtained theoretically. Combined with
numerical calculations, the properties of shock are also studied. This study will be
helpful to understand the biophysical properties of the collective transport of kinesin
KIF1A.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular motors are biogenic force generators acting in the nanometer range.
They are responsible for intracellular transport of wide varieties of cargo from one
location to another in eukaryotic cells [1–6]. Linear motors produce sliding movements along filamentous structures called protein tracks; for example, myosin slides
along actin filament [7–10], kinesin [11–15] and dynein [16–20] along microtubule.
Microtubule and filamentary protein actin are protein filaments which form part of
a dual-purpose scaffolding called cytoskeleton, act like struts or girders for the cellular architecture and, at the same time, also serve as tracks for the intracellular
transportation networks.
However, experiments found, one single filamentary track is usually traveled along
by multiple motors. Fundamental understanding of these collective physical phenomena may expose the causes of motor-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). In
literatures, these phenomena are usually described by the totally asymmetric simple
exclusion process (TASEP), which is originally proposed in [21], consists of particles
hopping unidirectionally with hard-core exclusion along a 1D lattice. TASEP is one
of many examples for driven systems with stationary nonequilibrium states, which
cannot be described in terms of Boltzmann weights. To model the attachment and
detachment of motors to and from tracks, Parmeggiani et al [22, 23] discussed a class
of driven lattice gas obtained by coupling 1D TASEP to Langmuir kinetics, in which
the attachment and detachment of motors is modeled as particle creation and annihilation respectively. Furthermore, Lipowsky et al [24, 25] suggested a more general
model, in which the diffusion of motors in the cell is considered explicitly. However,
in reality, a motor protein is not a mere particle, but an enzyme whose mechanical
movement is coupled with its biochemical cycle. Therefore, recently, a three-state
model is presented by Nishinari et al to describe the intracellular transport of singleheaded kinesin KIF1A [26, 27]. In which, the microtubule (MT) binding motor might
be in two states: strongly MT binding state and weakly MT binding state, denoted
by S, W respectively. Biochemically, the strongly binding state corresponds to bare

3
motor or ATP binding motor state, and the weakly binding state corresponds to ADP
binding state.
One of the important feature of the collective motion of motors along one single
track is the possible appearance of shock or domain wall, which is defined as the
interface between the low-density and high density regions. For the usual two-state
TASEP, using mean field method, the existence and properties of the shock have
been discussed recently [28]. In this study, similar analysis to the Nishinari’s threestate model will be presented, the efficient and necessary conditions of the existence
of shock will be given theoretically, and with the aid of numerical calculations the
properties of the shock will also be discussed. The method used in this study can be
regarded as a generalization of the one presented in [28].
In the next section, the three-state model and its mean field approximation will
be briefly introduced, and then in Sec. III the conditions of the existence of shock
will be presented. The existence of boundary layers and the properties of shock will
be discussed in Sec. IV and V. Finally, this study will be shortly summarized in Sec.
VI.

II.

TASEP WITH THREE INTERNAL STATES

The three-state TASEP given in [27] can be mathematically desccribed as follows.
Let Si and Wi denote the probabilities of finding a molecular motor in the states 1
and 2 at the lattice site i at time t respectively (states 1 and 2 correspond to strongly
bound and weakly bound states of molecular motors). Then Si , Wi are governed by
the following master equations
dSi
=ωa (1 − Si − Wi ) − ωh Si − ωd Si + ωs Wi
dt
+ ωf Wi−1 (1 − Si − Wi ) + (1 − c)ωf Wi (Si+1 + Wi+1 ),

(1)

4
dWi
= − (ωs + ωf )Wi (1 − Si+1 − Wi+1 ) + ωh Si
dt
− [ωs + (1 − c)ωf ]Wi (Si+1 + Wi+1 )

(2)

− ωb Wi (2 − Si+1 − Wi+1 − Si−1 − Wi−1 )
+ ωb (Wi−1 + Wi+1 )(1 − Si − Wi ),
where ωa is the rate of a molecular motor binding to the empty lattice site i, i.e. the
transition rate of state 0 to state 1, ωh is the transition rate of state 1 to state 2, i.e.
the rate of ATP hydrolysis, ωd is the transition rate of state 1 to state 0, i.e. the
rate of detachment, ωb is the rate of random Brownian motion. After the release of
ADP, the motor steps forward to the next binding site in front with rate ωf , stays at
the current location with rate ωs . c is an interpolating parameter (0 ≤ c ≤ 1). The
corresponding equations for the left boundary (i = 1) are given by
dS1
=α(1 − S1 − W1 ) − ωh S1 − γ1 S1 + ωs W1 + (1 − c)ωf W1 (S2 + W2 ),
dt
dW1
= − (ωs + ωf )W1 + ωh S1 + cωf W1 (S2 + W2 )
dt

(3)

(4)

+ ωb W2 (1 − S1 − W1 ) − ωb W1 (1 − S2 − W2 ) − γ2 W1 ,
where α is the rate of attachment of the motors at the left boundary (i.e. the lattice
site i = 1), γ1 , γ2 are the rates of detachment of motors in state 1 and state 2 at the
left boundary respectively. The equations for the right boundary (i = N) are give by
dSN
=δ(1 − SN − WN ) + ωf WN −1 (1 − SN − WN )
dt

(5)

+ ωs WN − ωh SN − β1 SN ,
dWN
=ωh SN − ωs WN − β2 WN + ωb WN −1 (1 − SN − WL )
dt

(6)

− ωb WN (1 − SN −1 − WN −1 ),
where δ is the rate of attachment of the motors at the right boundary (i.e. the lattice
site i = N), β1 β2 are the rates of detachment of motors in state 1 and state 2 at the
right boundary respectively.
It should be pointed out that the exclusion process described above is different from
the one discussed in [29], where multiple occupancy of sites is allowed if particles are

5
in different internal states. Here, the multiple occupancy is unallowed. However,
the particles bounding to the lattice site might be in two different states 1 and 2,
corresponding to the strongly bound and weakly bound states. As in [22], attachment
and detachment of a motor are modeled as, effectively, creation and annihilation of
motors on the lattice. Moreover, the transition between states 1 and 2 is described
by the rates ωh , ωs , ωf , the Brownian ratched mechanism is described by rate ωb .
Mean Field Approximation: In the large N limit, we can make the continuum
mean field approximation to Eqs. (1) and (2). Let ∆x =

1
N −1

and x = (i − 1)△x.

Obviously, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, since 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Using the Taylor expansion
S(x±∆x) = S(x)+

W (x±∆x) = W (x)+

(7)

The continuum limits of Eqs. (1) and (2) are then
∂S(x, t)
=ωa (1 − S − W ) + ωs W − (ωh + ωd )S
∂t

Thus, the probability density ρ(x, t) = S(x, t) + W (x, t) of finding a molecular motor
at lattice site x at time t satisfies [summing Eqs. (8) and (9)]
∂W (ρ − 1)
∂ρ(x, t)
=ωa (1 − ρ) − ωd S + ωf
∆x + O(∆x2 ).

(10)

As the discussion in [30], in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞, there are three
regimes to be distinguished. If ωa and ωd are of order [1/(N − 1)]α with α < 1, then
at the steady state, the system, Eqs. (9) and (10), reduces to


 ωa (1 − W − S) − ωd S = 0,


 cω W (S + W ) − (ω + ω )W + ω S = 0.
f

h

(11)

6
So the probability S satisfies
ck(k + 1)S 2 + [(k + 1)(l + 1) + n − c(2k + 1)]S + (c − l − 1) = 0,

(12)

and W = 1 − (k + 1)S, ρ = S + W , where l = ωs /ωf , n = ωh /ωf , k = ωd /ωa (because
of the particle-hole symmetry, we restrict the discussion to the case ωa ≥ ωd , i.e.
0 ≤ k ≤ 1).
For the cases that ωa and ωd are of order [1/(N − 1)]α but with α > 1, the local
kinetics is negligible and the system will be


 W (W + S − 1) = C,

,

(13)


 cω W (S + W ) − (ω + ω )W + ω S = 0
f
s
f
h

where the constant C is determined by the left or right boundary conditions [31, 32].
The case of the local rates ωa and ωd being of the order 1/(N − 1) is the most
interesting one, and will be investigated further in this study. In the following, we
always assume that the local rates ωa and ωd are of the order 1/(N − 1).

(14)

then at steady state, the leading terms of ∆x of Eqs. (9) (10) are



 ωf
+ Ωa (1 − ρ) − Ωd S = 0

The second equation implies

W =

n + l + 1 − cρ

(17)

7
The steady state flux is then proportional to
J = W (1 − ρ) =

nρ(1 − ρ)
.
n + l + 1 − cρ

(18)

The same as in [27], at the steady state, we can obtain the left boundary conditions
S(0) =

α − [cα(α − ωs )/ωf ]

cα + ωh

and the right boundary conditions

(20)

One can find that Eqs. (16) involves only the first-order derivatives of ρ and
W with respect to x whereas there are two sets of boundary conditions (19) and
(20). Therefore, if we integrate the equations (16) with the left boundary conditions
(19), the solution (denoted by ρl , Wl , Sl respectively) may not, in general, match
smoothly with the solution (denoted by ρr , Wr , Sr respectively) obtained for the
same equations but with the right boundary conditions (20). This discontinuity
corresponds to a shock or domain wall. However, at any position x, the continuity
condition of motor flux, or equivalently Jl (x) = Jr (x), should be satisfied, where
Jl (x) = W (x−)[1 − ρ(x−)] and Jr (x) = W (x+)[1 − ρ(x+)]. At the shock position xs ,


 W (xs −) = Wl (xs ), ρ(xs −) = ρl (xs ),
(21)

 W (x +) = W (x ), ρ(x +) = ρ (x ).
s

So the continuity condition Jl (xs ) = Jr (xs ) implies

nρr (xs )(1 − ρr (xs ))

Therefore, in the following, we always assume that ρ0 , ρ2 , ρ4 ≥ 1, and

≤ ρ3 ≤ ρ1 ≤ 1.

The general solutions of Eq. (25) are
F (ρ) = x + C,

(30)

where C is an arbitrary constant and
F (ρ) = −

[A ln |ρ − ρ0 | + B ln |ρ − ρ1 | + D ln |ρ − ρ2 |] ,

,
(ρ0 − ρ1 )(ρ1 − ρ2 )

D=

ρ22 − 2ρ0 ρ2 + ρ0
.
(ρ0 − ρ2 )(ρ1 − ρ2 )
(32)

So the solution of Eq. (25), which satisfies the left boundary condition ρ(0) = S(0) +
W (0), see Eq. (19), is
F (ρl ) = x + F0 ,

or ρl (x) = F −1 (x + F0 ),

(33)

where F0 = F [ρ(0)]. Similarly, the solution of Eq. (25), which satisfies the right
boundary condition ρ(1) = S(1) + W (1), see Eq. (20), is
F (ρr ) = x + F1 − 1,

or ρr (x) = F −1 (x + F1 − 1),

(34)

where F1 = F (ρ(1)). In the following, we assume ρl 6≡ ρr (otherwise, there would be
no shock and boundary layers).
Combining (21) (23) (33) (34), one sees that, at the shock position xs


 F (ρl (xs )) − F (ρr (xs )) + F1 − F0 − 1 = 0,

These are the efficient and necessary condition of the existence of shock at the position

Using this property of the function H(ρ), we can obtain the following results:

see Fig. 1 (a). From (25) (31), one can find the function F (ρ) increases with ρ for
0 ≤ ρ < ρ3 and ρ1 < ρ ≤ 1, and decreases with ρ for ρ3 < ρ < ρ1 . Thus

Therefore, the conditions presented in (40) are generalizations of the ones obtained
in [28] for the usual TASEP with motor detachment and attachment:
ρ−1
l (1 − ρ(1)) < 1,

and ρr (0) < 1 − ρ(0).

(42)

In fact, if the parameter c = 0 (i.e. γ = 0), the Eq. (24) reduces to
(1 − 2ρ)ρx = Ωah [(l + n + 1) − [(l + n + 1) + k(l + 1)]ρ],

(43)

11
which is similar as the model discussed in [22] for the usual TASEP. For such reduced
cases, ρ3 = 0.5, and the conditions (40) of existence of shock is reduced to (42).
(II) For 0 ≤ ρ(0) < ρ3 and ρ1 ≤ ρ(1) ≤ 1, the conditions of existence of shock in
interval (0, 1) is

Therefore, conditions (44) are also generalizations of the ones for the usual TASEP
[28]:
ρ−1
l (1 − ρ(1)) < 1,

and ρ−1
r (1 − ρ(0)) > 0.

(46)

(III) For 0 ≤ ρ(0), ρ(1) ≤ ρ3 , the condition of the existence of shock in (0, 1) is
ρ−1
l (ρ3 ) < 1

and

ρ̃r (0) <

1 − ρ(0)
1 − γρ(0)

(47)

where ρ̃r (x) is one of the solutions of differential equation (24), which satisfies ρ̃r (1) =
ρ3 and ρ̃r (0) > ρ3 . See Fig. 1 (c).
(IV) For ρ(0), ρ(1) > ρ3 , there exists no shock in (0, 1). It can be readily verified that
the function f (ρl , ρr ) = ρl + ρr −γρl ρr −1 increases monotonously with 0 ≤ ρl , ρr ≤ 1,
and f (ρ3 , ρ3 ) = 0. For ρ(0), ρ(1) > ρ3 , one knows that ρ3 ≤ min(ρl , ρr ) < max(ρl , ρr )
(note: we always assume ρl 6≡ ρr ). Thus f (ρl , ρr ) = ρl + ρr − γρl ρr − 1 > 0. It is to
say that there exists no shock [see (35)].
(V) For 0 ≤ ρ(1) < ρ3 and ρl (0) > ρ3 , there exists no shock in (0, 1).
In conclusion, ρ(0) < ρ3 is one necessary condition of the existence of shock in
(0, 1).

IV.

THE EXISTENCE OF BOUNDARY LAYER

Generally speaking, if ρl 6≡ ρr and there is no shock in (0, 1), boundary layer will
appear at least at one of the boundaries 0 and 1. Similar as in [28], we have the

following results:

THE PROPERTIES OF SHOCK

Finally, we discuss the properties of shock briefly. From the discussion in Sec. III,
one knows that ρ(0) < ρ3 is necessary for the existence of shock. So, at the shock
position xs , ρl (xs ) < ρr (xs ), see Eq. (23), and the height of the shock is [see Eq. (37)]
εs = ρr (xs ) − ρl (xs ) =

1 − 2ρl (xs ) + γρ2l (xs )
.
1 − γρl (xs )

(55)

The derivative of the height εs with respect to ρl (xs ) is
γ−1
∂εs
=
− 1 < 0.
∂ρl (xs )
(1 − γρl (xs ))2
At the same time, ρl (0) = ρ(0) < ρ3 means

∂ρl (xs )
∂xs

(56)

> 0 [see (25)]. So

∂εs ∂ρl (xs )
∂εs
=
< 0,
∂xs
∂ρl (xs ) ∂xs

(57)

which means, the shock height εs decreases with the shock position xs . Therefore, we
only need to give the relations between shock position xs and the model parameters
Ωa , Ωd , ωf , ωs , ωh , ωb , c.
Because of the complexity of the function F [see (31)], it is difficult to get theoretical results as in [28]. From numerical calculations, we find that, the shock position xs
decreases with parameters Ωa , α, ωb, ωs , but increases with parameters Ωd , β, ωf , ωh , c,
see Fig. 5. In the calculations, xs is obtained by (36) and (33).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this study, the three-state process, which is presented in [26, 27] to model
the intracellular transport of single-headed kinesin KIF1A , is theoretically analyzed

14
using mean field approximation. By similar methods as for the usual TASEP [28], the
conditions of the existence of shock or domain wall, which is defined as the interface
of low-density and high-density phases, are obtained. With the aid of numerical
calculations, the parameters dependent properties of the shock are also discussed.
The results obtained in this study will be helpful to understand the real biophysical
properties of motor traffic in eukaryotic cells.
