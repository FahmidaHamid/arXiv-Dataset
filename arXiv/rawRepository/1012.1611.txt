Broken chaotic clocks of brain neurons and depression

Irregular spiking time-series obtained in vitro and in vivo from singular brain neurons of different
types of rats are analyzed by mapping to telegraph signals. Since the neural information is coded
in the length of the interspike intervals and their positions on the time axis, this mapping is the
most direct way to map a spike train into a signal which allows a proper application of the Fourier
transform methods. This analysis shows that healthy neurons firing has periodic and chaotic deterministic clocks while for the rats representing genetic animal model of human depression these
neuron clocks might be broken, that results in decoherence between the depressive neurons firing.
Since depression is usually accompanied by a narrowing of consciousness this specific decoherence
can be considered as a cause of the phenomenon of the consciousness narrowing as well. This suggestion is also supported by observation of the large-scale chaotic coherence of the posterior piriform
and entorhinal cortices’ electrical activity at transition from anesthesia to the waking state with full
consciousness.

INTRODUCTION

All types of information, which is received by sensory system, are encoded by nerve cells into sequences
of pulses of similar shape (spikes) before they are transmitted to the brain. Brain neurons use such sequences
as main instrument for intercells connection. The information is reflected in the time intervals between successive firings (interspike intervals of the action potential
train, see Fig. 1). There need be no loss of information
in principle when converting from dynamical amplitude
information to spike trains [1] and the irregular spike sequences are the foundation of neural information processing. Although understanding of the origin of interspike
intervals irregularity has important implications for elucidating the temporal components of the neuronal code
and for treatment of such mental disorders as depression
and schizophrenia, the problem is still very far from its
solution.
The mighty Fourier transform method, for instance, is
practically non-applicable to the spike time trains. The
spikes are almost identical to each other and the neural
information is coded in the length of the interspike intervals and the interspike intervals positions on the time
axis, therefore it is the most direct way to map the spike
train into a telegraph time signal, which has values -1
from one side of a spike and values +1 from another side
of the spike with a chosen time-scale resolution. An example of such mapping is given in figure 1. While the
information coding is here the same as for the corresponding spike train, the Fourier transform method is
quite applicable to analysis of the telegraph time-series.
On the other hand, recent dynamical models of neuron activity revealed new and complex role of regimes of
a (deterministic) chaotic irregularity in the neuron spike
trains (see, for instance, [2]-[5]). Therefore, we have to
use all available mathematical tools in order to study the
experimental data on the deterministic chaos properties
(and, especially, in order to separate between determin-

In present paper we have analyzed three types of experimentally obtained spike trains: a) obtained in vitro from
a spontaneous activity in CA3 hippocampal slice culture
of a healthy Wistar/ST rat (the raw data and the detail description of the experiment can be found online at
http://hippocampus.jp/data and in Refs. [6],[7]), b) obtained in an electrophysiological in vivo experiment from
neurons belonging to red nucleus of a healthy (SpragueDawley) rat’s brain (see Ref. [8] for more details of the
experiment and a preliminary discussion of the data), and
c) obtained in an electrophysiological in vivo experiment
from neurons belonging to red nucleus of a genetically
depressed (Flinders Sensitive Rat Line) rat’s brain (see
Ref. [8] for more details and a preliminary discussion of
the data).

Motivation to study the hippocampus and red nucleus
areas of brain in relation to the psychomotor aspects of
depression is based on the recently discovered evidences
of their deep involvement in this mental disorder. The
hippocampus is a significant part of a brain system responsible for behavioral inhibition and attention, spatial memory, and navigation. It is also well known that
spatial memory and navigation of the rats is closely related to the rhythms of their moving activity. On the
other hand, the hippocampus of a human who has suffered long-term clinical depression can be as much as 20%
smaller than the hippocampus of someone who has never
been depressed [9]. Inputs to the Red Nucleus arise from
motor areas of the brain and in particular the deep cerebellar nuclei (via superior cerebellar peduncle; crossed
projection) and the motor cortex (corticorubral; ipsilateral projection). On the other hand it is known that
humans with deep depression have intrinsic locomotors
problems. Therefore, investigation of Red Nucleus for
genetically defined rat model of depression (these rats
partially resemble depressed humans because they exhibit reduced appetite and psychomotor function) can
be useful for understanding the mental disorder origin.

The spike trains were mapped to telegraph signals as it is
described above (see also [10]). Figure 2 shows autocorrelation function for the telegraph signal corresponding
to the cell-21 (800 spikes). Insert in the Fig. 2 shows
corresponding spectrum. Both the correlation function
and the spectrum provide clear indication of a strong
periodic component in the signal (the oscillations in the
correlation function and the peak in the spectrum). The
periodic component can be seen at frequency f0 ≃ 0.3Hz.
Figure 3 shows the spectrum in log-log scales. One can
see that at high frequencies the spectrum exhibits a scaling behavior (power law: E(f ) ∼ f −1.7 , as indicated by
the dashed straight line). The real power law can be more
pronounced but under the experimental conditions individual spikes emitted at firing rates higher than 5Hz were
experimentally inseparable [6],[7]. Figure 4 shows spectrum of the telegraph signal corresponding to the spike
train obtained for the cell-25 (692 spikes). The spectrum
is rather similar to the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 (for
cell-21). The more broad peak in Fig. 4 can be related

THRESHOLD EFFECT

Now let us speculate about physics which could result
in the spectra observed in Figs. 3 and 4. And let us recall
some basic electrochemical properties of neuron. Nerve
cells are surrounded by a membrane that allows some
ions to pass through while it blocks the passage of other
ions. When a neuron is not sending a signal it is said to
be ”at rest”. At rest there are relatively more sodium
ions onside the neuron and more potassium ions inside
that neuron. The resting value of the membrane electrochemical potential P (the voltage difference across the
neural membrane) of a neuron is about -70mV. If some
event (a stimulus) causes the resting potential to move
toward 0mV and the depolarization reaches about -55mV
(a ”normal” threshold) a neuron will fire an action potential. The action potential is an explosive release of charge
between neuron and its surroundings that is created by
a depolarizing current. If the neuron does not reach this
critical threshold level, then no action potential will fire.
Also, when the threshold level is reached, an action potential of a fixed size will always fire (for any given neuron the size of the action potential is always the same).
Depending on different types of voltage-dependent ion
channels, different types of action potentials are generated in different cells types and the qualitative estimates
of the potentials and time periods can be varied. Recent
reconstructions of a driver of the membrane potential using the neuron spike trains indicate the Rössler oscillator
as the most probable (and simple) candidate (see, for instance, Refs. [10],[12]-[17]). Figure 5 shows as example
the x-component fluctuations of a chaotic solution of the
Rössler system [18]

where a, b and c are parameters). At certain values of
the parameters a,b and c the z-component of the Rössler
system is a spiky time series [19],[20]: Fig. 6. It can
be shown that the Rössler system and the well known
Hindmarsh-Rose model [21] of neurons are subsystems of
the same differential model with a spiky component [20].
Previously the ’spiky’ component of such models was interpreted and studied as a simulation of a neuronal output. For the spontaneous neuron firing (without external
stimulus), however, we suggest to reverse the approach
and consider the spiky variable as the main component of
the electrical input (which naturally should have a ’spiky’
character, see above) to the neuron under consideration.
For each neuron the height of the spikes, which the neuron generates, is about the same. However, the heights

of the spikes generated by different neurons are different. Also the signals coming from different neurons to
the neuron under consideration have to go through the
electrochemical passes with different properties. Therefore, the spiky z-time-series (Fig. 6) can naturally represent a multineuron signal, which can be considered as
a spontaneous input for the neuron under consideration.
If we use the usual interpretation of the x-component
as a driver of the membrane potential P (x) and the ycomponent as that taking into account the transport of
ions across the membrane through the ion channels [21],
then the position of the input (the component z) in the
first equation of the system Eq. (1) has a good physical background (cf. Ref. [21]). Then, the quadratic
nonlinearity in the third equation of the system Eq. (1)
can be interpreted as a simple (in the Taylor expansion
terms) feedback of the neuron to the main component
of the neuronal input. This model with the strong nonlinear feedback can be relevant to the most active neurons of a spontaneously active brain (see below results of
an in vitro experiment with a spontaneous brain activity). The details of the function P (x) is not significant
for the threshold firing process, what really matters is
that the membrane potential function P (x) reaches its
firing value when (and only when) its argument x crosses
certain threshold from below. In this simple model the
driving variable x may overcome its threshold value (Fig.
5) due to the deterministic (chaotic) spontaneous stimulus. Let us consider an output spike signal resulting from
overcoming a threshold value x = 7, for instance. Fig. 7
shows spectrum of the telegraph signal corresponding to
the spike signal.
One can compare Fig. 7 with Figs. 3 and 4 to see very
good reproduction of the main spectral properties.
In order to understand what is going on here we show
in figure 8 spectrum of the x-component itself.
The semi-log scales are used in these figures in order to

indicate exponential decay in the spectra (in the semi-log
scales this decay corresponds to a straight line):
E(f ) ∼ e−f /fe

(2)

While the peak in the spectrum corresponds to the fundamental frequency, f0 , of the Rössler chaotic attractor, the
rate of the exponentional decay (the slope of the straight
line in Fig. 8 provides us with and additional characteristic frequency fe . Thus Rössler chaotic attractor has
two clocks: periodic with frequency f0 and chaotic with
frequency fe . If one compares Fig. 8 and Fig. 7 one can
see that the periodic clock survived the threshold crossing (with a period doubling, see Appendix). The chaotic
clock, however, did not survive the threshold crossing at
spontaneous activity: the exponential decay in Fig. 8 has
been transformed into a scaling (power law) decay in Fig.
7, which has no characteristic frequency (scale invariance). The scaling exponent value ’-1.7’ is not sensitive
to a reasonable variation of the threshold value (∼ 20%)
and even to Gaussian fluctuations of the threshold value.
Therefore, it is not just a coincidence that the scaling law
in the Rössler case agrees with results of the in vitro experiment (cf. also [22],[23],[24] and Fig. 16a). It should
be noted that for a wide class of deterministic systems a
broad-band spectrum with exponential decay is a generic
feature of their chaotic solutions Refs. [11],[25]-[27]. It is
shown in Ref. [25] that the characteristic frequency

CHAOS VS. STOCHASTICITY IN NEURON
FIRING

Both stochastic and deterministic processes can result
in the broad-band part of the spectrum, but the decay in
the spectral power is different for the two cases. An exponential decay with respect to frequency refers to chaotic
time series while a power-law decay indicates that the
spectrum is stochastic.
Figure 9 shows a power spectrum obtained by the fast
Fourier transform method applied to a telegraph signal
mapped from a spike train measured in the red nucleus
of a healthy rat (we can use the fast Fourier transform
here due to sufficiently large number of spikes in the spike
train: 2170). The spike train corresponds to a singular
neuron firing. Figure 10 shows analogous spectrum obtained from another healthy red nucleus’s neuron (2139
spikes). The semi-log scales are used in these figures in
order to indicate exponential decay in the spectra (unlike
the situation discribed above for a spontaneous activity):
in the semi-log scales this decay corresponds to a straight
line - Eq. 2. The characteristic frequency fe ≃ 1.1Hz in
the both cases. Figure 11 shows a power spectrum obtained by the fast Fourier transform method applied to a
telegraph signal mapped from a spike train (2022 spikes)
measured in the red nucleus of a genetically depressive
(the ”Flinders” line) rat. The spike train corresponds
to a singular neuron firing. Figure 12 shows analogous
spectrum obtained from another genetically depressive
red nucleus’s neuron (2048 spikes). The log-log scales
are used in these figures in order to indicate a powerlaw decay in the spectra (in the log-log scales this decay
corresponds to a straight line):
E(f ) ∼ f −α

(4)

In this (scaling) situation there is no characteristic time
scale. The scaling exponent α ≃ 1.5 ± 0.1 and ≃ 1.4 ± 0.1
for these two cases.

CHAOTIC NEURAL COHERENCE AND
DEPRESSION

In order to work together the brain neurons have to
make adjustment of their rhythms. The main problem
for this adjustment is the very noisy environment of the
brain neurons. If their work was based on pure periodic inner clocks this adjustment would be impossible
due to the noise. The nature, however, has another option. This option is a chaotic clock. In chaotic attractors certain characteristic frequencies can be embedded
by broad-band spectra, that makes them much more stable to the noise perturbations [28].
In the light of presented results one can conclude that
for the considered cases the healthy neurons firing has deterministic clocks (periodic and chaotic), while the genetically depressive red nucleus’s neurons exhibited a pure

stochastic firing and it seems that their background deterministic clocks were broken. The existence of the background clocks can be utilized by the healthy neurons for
synchronization of their activity [2],[6],[7],[29]-[31].
In order to compare coherent properties of the healthy
and the depressive neuron pairs we will use cross-spectral
analysis. The cross spectrum E1,2 (f ) of two processes
x1 (t) and x2 (t) is defined by the Fourier transformation of
the cross-correlation function normalized by the product
of square root of the univariate power spectra E1 (f ) and
E2 (f ):

multi-second oscillations, for instance, are known to be
synchronized nearly brain-wide [32],[33]. In the case of
depression, however, the chaotic neuron clocks can be
broken in a significant part of the brain neurons. That
can result in certain decoherence in different parts of
the brain. Since depression is usually accompanied by
a narrowing of consciousness (and a distorted sense of
time) this specific decoherence could be considered as a
cause of the phenomenon of the consciousness narrowing
as well. The coherence is important for attention,
sensorimotor processing, etc.. In humans, in particular,
being low in attentional flexibility magnified the effects
of private self-focused attention so typical for depressive
persons.

the bracket h...i denotes the expectation value. The cross
spectrum can be decomposed into the phase spectrum
φ1,2 (f ) and the coherency C1,2 (f ):

In order to support the possibility of the extended
chaotic coherence we will use analysis of simultaneously
recorded local field potentials from three sites along
the olfactory-entorhinal axis (the anterior piriform,
posterior piriform, and entorhinal cortices: aPIR, pPIR
and Ent C) reported in a recent paper [34]. The
measurements reported in the Ref. [34] were performed
in lightly anesthetized healthy rats (the Long-Evans rats
with electrode bundles implanted in their anterior and
posterior cortices, and with vertical, silicon probes in
their entorhinal cortices), which were emerged from the
anesthesia to the waking state with full consciousness.
Since the measured local field potentials time series
are not spiky ones one does not need in the special
data mappings in this case. The authors of the Ref.
[34] discovered a new form of coherent neural activity
across the three widely separated brain sites, which they
named Synchronous Frequency Bursts (SFBs). The
high-energy bursts of spontaneous momentary synchrony
were observed across widely separated olfactory and
entorhinal sites (which have also different architecture:
the 6 layers of the entorhinal cortex vs. the three layers
of the piriform cortices). Moreover, a significant rate of

E1,2 (f ) = C1,2 (f )e−iφ1,2 (f )

(6)

Because of the normalization of the cross spectrum the
coherency is ranging from C1,2 (f ) = 0, i.e. no linear
relationship between x1 (t) and x2 (t) at f , to C1,2 (f ) = 1,
i.e. perfect linear relationship.
Figure 13 shows comparison of coherency in firing for
the healthy (solid curve) and for the genetically depressed
(doted curve) neuron pairs in a low-frequency domain
(the in vivo experiments). Despite of the deep anesthesia
the healthy neurons exhibit bands of rather high (> 0.5)
coherency in the low-frequency domain, while the depressive neurons activity is rather decoherent in this domain.

the SFBs simultaneous occurrences was also observed
across the different functional processing systems: motor
and olfactory ones.
The stereotypical duration of the SFBs was about
250 ms and the power spectra taken across the events
were exponentially decaying. Figure 14 shows a typical
spectrum for the posterior piriform area. The straight
line is drawn in this figure in order to indicate the
exponential decay Eq. (2) in the semi-log scales (cf.
Figs. 9 and 10 for the singular neuron firing). The
exponential decay indicates a chaotic nature of these
bursts (see above). The decay rate Te = 1/fe ≃ 0.1s is
significantly smaller than that observed for the singular
neurons (Figs. 9 and 10). Taking into account Eq. (3)
one can conclude that the chaotic mixing in the phase
space (determined by the Lyapunov’s exponents) is
much more active for the multineuron activity than for
the singular neuron firing (that seems quite natural).
This more active mixing shifts the spectrum into more
high frequency range. Moreover, one can expect that
expansion (globalization) of the chaotic coherence on the
larger brain areas will shift the coherent chaotic activity
even into the higher frequency ranges (cf. below).
The authors of the Ref. [34] computed coherence
across SFBs in a pair of brain regions. Figure 15 shows
the coherency calculated for the SFBs in the posterior
piriform and entorhinal cortices (which are separated in
brain space by about 8mm). One can compare this figure
with the Fig. 13 (where the coherency was calculated
for a pair of neighboring neurons). In this case the frequency bands of high coherency can be observed as well.
The coherent frequency-range is shifted considerably in
the high frequency direction for the multineuron case
(see above for a reason of this shift). Actually, ”the
main purpose of SFBs might be to coordinate multiple
frequency bands across different processing subsystems”
[34]. Such coordination provides a sufficient level of

coherence for the work of these separated subsystems
with speed and efficiency impossible in the case of
transmission of a specific behavioral content. This can
be considered as the main advantage of the chaotic
coherence. The hardware for these effective ’management’ can be provided (at least partially) by recently
discovered in the cortex and hippocampus interneuronal
networks with long-range axonal connections [35],[36]
and for the high frequency γ-range (30-90Hz) oscillations
”via neurons (and glia) inter-connected by electrical
synapses called gap junctions which physically fuse and
electrically couple neighboring cells.”[37].
The authors of the Ref. [34] observed also that the
SFBs occurrence is a function of level of consciousness.
They found ”that the SFBs occurred far more often
under light anesthesia than deeper anesthetic states,
and were especially prevalent as the animals regained
consciousness”. They did not observe the SFBs after
the rats regained full alertness, but as they comment
this can be a technical problem of inferring the specific
signal from the highly complex local field potential of
the awake state. Therefore, one cannot rule out the
possibility that the phenomenon is still in a full swing
also in the fully consciousness state (at least at certain
conditions).
Finally, it should be noted that the transitional states
of consciousness (emerging and decaying) have a very
interesting relationship to associative human creativity
(H. Poincare called these states as semi-somnolent conditions, see Ref. [38], Chapter: Mathematical discovery).
The very creative and unexpected associative ideas
that come in these states can have the above described
long-range chaotic coherence as their direct physical
background. Moreover, the same mechanism can also be
in work at full consciousness (see previous paragraph).
In this case, however, its results are considered as ones
coming from the ’clear sky’ and we tend to interpret
them (may be wrongly) as a result of a prolonged period
of unconscious work. In the full consciousness state
these results are more often turn out to be adequate
ones, unlike of those obtained in the transitional states
[38]).
”A new result has value, if any, when, by establishing connections between elements that are known but
until then dispersed and apparently unrelated to one another, order is immediately created where chaos seemed
to reign” [38].

the autocorrelation function Eq. (A1) calculated for p =
0.25, as an example. For comparison figure 16a shows
also a superposition of the autocorrelation functions for
the telegraph signals corresponding to the cell-21 (the
solid line) and to the spike train generated by the the
Rössler attractor fluctuations overcoming the threshold
x = 7 (circles). In order to make the autocorrelation
functions comparable a rescaling has been made for the
Rössler attractor generated autocorrelation function.

In order to understand how the fundamental chaotic
clock survives the threshold firing let us consider a very
simple and rough model, which allows analytic calculation of its autocorrelation function. In this model the
spike firing takes place at discrete moments: tn = nT +ζ,
where ζ is an uniformly distributed over the interval [0, T ]
random variable, n = 1, 2, 3... and T is a fixed period.
Then let us consider a telegraph signal constructed for
this spike train as it has been described above. If p is
a probability of the spike firing at a current moment
(0 ≤ p < 1), then the autocorrelation function of such
telegraph signal is:
