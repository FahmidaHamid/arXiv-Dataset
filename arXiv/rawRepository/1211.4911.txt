Abstract
Species interactions form food webs, impacting community structure
and, potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global climatic
perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant
influence on species interaction patterns. Here we integrate stable
isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of trophic
interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited
mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern
Alaska (Beringia) during the late Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing
model to quantify the contribution of prey to the diets of local predators,
and assess how the structure of trophic interactions changed across space
and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that
severely impacted mammoth steppe communities. We find that large
felids had diets that were more constrained than co-occurring predators,
and largely influenced by an increase in Rangifer abundance after the
LGM. Moreover, the structural organization of Beringian and European
communities strongly differed: compared to Europe, species interactions
in Beringian communities before - and possibly after - the LGM were
highly modular. We suggest that this difference in modularity may have
been driven by the geographic insularity of Beringian communities.

Introduction

The structural patterns of species interactions may affect ecosystem dynamics
[2], and are sensitive to external perturbations such as climate change [55, 62].
Impacts of climate change and other perturbations on food web structure may
be immediate or lagged [60]; they can affect communities by reorganizing
interactions [47], changing the magnitudes of interactions [33, 6], or
eliminating species [60, 54]. However, observations of community organization

2

across a perturbation event are typically confined to short timescales and to
populations with fast turn-over rates. To assess the long-term effects of
climate change empirically, it is necessary to use paleontological or historical
information [21]. A climatic perturbation of global significance occurred in the
late Pleistocene and culminated with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5
to 19 kyr BP) [18], strongly impacting mammalian communities worldwide,
including the one that extended across the Eurasian mammoth steppe [67, 24],
an environment with no modern analogue [28]. An examination of species
interactions across this climatic event is well-suited to assess the effects of
large perturbations on the organization of animal communities.
Although evidence of many paleontological species interactions is
irrecoverable, interactions that involve a flow of biomass are recorded in
animal tissue and can be reconstructed using stable isotope ratios
[31, 44, 43, 66]. As a consequence, they can be used to compare patterns of
interaction across the mammoth steppe environment. Mammoth steppe
communities were taxonomically similar across Eurasia [8], although the
inherent plasticity of species’ roles from Beringia (a region that includes
Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon) to Europe is not known. Nor is it known
whether generalized features of trophic systems, such as the degree of dietary
specialization among consumers, varied across this expansive ecosystem.
Global ice sheets attained their maximum volume during the LGM [18],
separating warmer, mesic periods before and after. This change in global
climate had a tremendous impact on the mammoth steppe ecosystem,
eliminating temperate species (particularly in Europe), and initiating a shift
from tree-covered habitats to xeric grassland-dominated habitats across
Eurasia [1]. Although the mammoth steppe experienced dramatic climatic
shifts during the late Pleistocene, whether such changes impacted trophic

3

interactions or by extension community organization, is unknown.
Quantification of trophic interactions over both space (across the mammoth
steppe) and time (across the LGM) permit an examination of whether specific
patterns of interactions characterized these ecosystems, and to what degree
climate change may have influenced the roles of species in these mammalian
communities.
We employ a three-pronged approach to address these issues. First, we use a
Bayesian isotope mixing model to quantify the structure, magnitude, and
variability of trophic interactions from stable isotope ratios of mammals in six
independent Eurasian predator-prey networks spanning the LGM. Second, we
compare species’ resource use across the mammoth steppe environment,
determine whether these interactions changed in response to the arrival or
extinction of co-occurring species, and assess the degree of dietary
specialization within and among predator guilds. Third, we determine how
community-level patterns of interaction change from eastern Beringia to
Europe across the LGM using recently developed tools from network theory. In
tandem, these combined approaches reveal the variability of mammoth steppe
predator-prey network structures, the degree that trophic interactions varied
over space and time, and how these changing patterns of interaction influenced
the structural properties of mammalian food webs over long timescales.

2.1

Materials and Methods
Study Sites

During the late Pleistocene, the mammoth steppe extended from western
Europe to the Yukon [8]. The mammalian community that inhabited this
steppe has been noted for its species richness [29, 28] despite the assumed low

4

productivity of local vegetation. This ‘productivity paradox’ [29] suggests that
mammoth steppe vegetation differed from modern tundra-dominated flora
[28, 67]. Indeed, palynological evidence indicates that tundra and boreal
vegetation retreated to isolated refugia during the height of the LGM
[28, 67, 15]. It is now generally accepted that before and after the LGM hereafter the pre-Glacial and post-Glacial, respectively - mammoth steppe
vegetation consisted of relatively mesic coniferous woodland mosaics in
Beringia and Europe [15, 16, 42]. Evidence of forests during the LGM is
restricted to south-central Europe [65]. In contrast, LGM Beringia was a
nearly treeless, hyper-xeric, and highly productive steppe dominated by
low-sward herbaceous vegetation [67, 69].
Mammalian communities were taxonomically similar across Eurasia [8]. From
Beringia to Europe, large felids (the saber-toothed cat, Homotherium serum,
in pre-Glacial Beringia and the cave lion, Panthera spelaea, in Europe as well
as Beringia after the pre-Glacial) [5], brown bears (Ursus arctos), and wolves
(Canis) were the dominant predators, while short-faced bears (Arctodus) were
exclusive to Beringia and North America, and cave hyenas (Crocuta crocuta)
were exclusive to western Eurasia and Africa. Smaller predators, including
wolverines (Gulo) and Lynx tend to be preserved in European fossil sites.
Mammoth steppe herbivores had similarly large geographic ranges, and
included wooly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), caribou (Rangifer
tarandus), yak (Bos mutus), bison (Bison spp.), horses (Equus ferus), caprine
bovids (Symbos cavifrons in Beringia, and Rupicapra rupicapra in Europe) and
the wooly rhinocerous (Coelodonta antiquitatis). In contrast to Beringia,
Europe hosted a diverse cervid community, including red deer (Cervus
elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and the Irish elk (Megaloceros
giganteus). Although the eastern Beringian mammoth steppe ecosystem was

5

not significantly influenced by humans or human ancestors before ca. 13.5 kyr
BP [32], Homo neanderthalensis is known to have occupied European systems
(sometimes sporadically) from ca. 300 to 30 kyr BP [39, 20], and modern
humans occur in the region at ca. 40 kyr BP [39], including sites on the Arctic
Ocean in central Beringia [49]. Neanderthal diets in continental regions were
dependent on terrestrial animals [12, 13, 51], though their role as predators
relative to co-occurring carnivores is not well understood.

2.2

Estimating diet from stable isotope data

Ratios of stable isotopes can be used to infer trophic interactions between
predators and prey. Because prey isotope ratios are recorded in consumer
tissues, and are robust to diagenetic alteration over long periods of time, they
can be used to reconstruct historic or paleontological patterns of resource use
[30, 31, 44]. If ratios of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes are known for both
predators and potential prey, and if the fractionation of stable isotopes by
metabolic processes between predators and prey is characterized (using trophic
discrimination factors), then mixing models can be used to quantify the
proportional contribution of prey to a predator’s diet [41], thereby establishing
a per-capita measure of mass flow between interacting species in a food web.
Values of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios are expressed as δ 13 C and δ 15 N
respectively, where δ = 1000{(Rsample /Rstandard ) − 1} and R = 13 C/12 C or
15

N/14 N, with units of per-mil (h); reference standards are Vienna PeeDee

belemnite for carbon, and atmospheric N2 for nitrogen.
We used previously published stable isotope datasets to reconstruct trophic
interactions for six independent predator-prey networks from eastern Beringia
to western Europe, before, during, and after the LGM (figure 1). The three
European predator-prey networks include the Ardennes (ca. 44.7 to 28.7 kyr

6

BP) and Swabian Jura (ca. 44.7 to 28.7 kyr BP) during the pre-Glacial, and
Jura during the post-Glacial (ca. 16.9 to 14 kyr BP) [10, 12, 14].
Unfortunately, we have no European datasets from the LGM. The three
Beringian predator-prey networks were all located near Fairbanks, Alaska, and
date to the pre-Glacial (ca. 50 - 27.6 kyr BP), LGM (ca. 27.6 to 21.4 kyr BP),
and post-Glacial (ca. 21.4 to 11.5 kyr BP) [24]. To assess the role of H.
neanderthalensis in pre-Glacial European networks, we used published isotope
data for western French and Belgian neanderthal specimens dated to ca. 48 to
34 kyr BP [13, 9, 51]. Because the isotopic values of Equus and Mammuthus
tissues are similar in the neanderthal sites as well as the Ardennes and
Swabian Jura [10, 12, 11], we consider an assessment of neanderthal diet from
these combined assemblages to be meaningful. Accordingly, we include
neanderthals as potential predators in both pre-Glacial European communities.

2.3

Dietary analysis

We used estimates of trophic interactions quantified from stable isotope ratios
to reconstruct paleontological predator-prey networks. Predator-prey networks
typically consist of species (nodes) connected by trophic interactions (links).
In quantitative networks, link-strengths describe the relative importance of
individual trophic links connecting predators to prey [66]. To calculate
link-strength distributions for each trophic interaction in a network, we used
MixSIR (v. 1.0.4), a Bayesian isotope mixing model [41]. In this context,
link-strengths represent the proportional flow of biomass from prey to
predators, such that the links connecting all prey to a given predator are
constrained to sum to one. Because Bayesian mixing models account for
link-strength variance, proportional prey contributions are quantified as
posterior probability distributions, thereby accounting for actual ecological

7

variability, variation in trophic discrimination factors, non-unique solutions,
and measurement uncertainty [41]. Accordingly, each link is described by a
unique probability distribution, such that link-strengths have associated
probabilities for all interactions in a predator-prey network [66] (online
supplementary materials, appendix I). We corrected for metabolic
fractionations between consumers and prey by applying a range of potential
trophic discrimination factors for both Beringian and European systems
(online supplementary materials, appendix II).
Herbivores from each paleontological assemblage are assumed to be potential
prey for all co-occurring predators. Although adults of large-bodied taxa such
as Mammuthus and Coelodonta would escape predation from most consumers,
they may represent important scavenged resources, and are included as
potential prey for smaller species. In contrast, cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) are
not considered to be predators, and are included as potential prey for
Panthera, Crocuta, and H. neanderthalensis in European systems. This
distinction is supported by evidence for strong herbivory among cave bears
[11], and for predation on cave bears by large-bodied carnivores [64, 17].
To measure the structural organization of predator-prey networks, we
quantified the degree of nestedness and modularity for each system.
Nestedness quantifies the extent that specialist predator diets are subsets of
generalist predator diets (calculated using the Nestedness based on Overlap
and Decreasing Fill metric[4]). Nested trophic interactions can arise from
groups of predators avoiding prey that fall below different optimal
physiological or energetic requirements [36], due to competitive hierarchies
among co-occurring predators [19], and/or as a consequence of body size
constraints on predation [48]. Modularity, or compartmentalization (calculated
as a function of local link density [70]; see online supplementary materials,

8

appendix III), is often observed in extant trophic systems [27, 59, 7, 66], and is
thought to promote stability [37, 59] by isolating extinction cascades [58]. To
account for link-strengths, measures of nestedness and modularity are
evaluated across cutoff values i, such that a given property is first measured
for the whole network (i = 0), and again at successive intervals as weak links
are eliminated for higher cutoff values (i > 0). Therefore, measurements of
structure at high cutoff values correspond to the structure generated by the
strongest interacting species in a network [66]. This analysis enabled us to
examine how network structure is dependent on the strength of trophic
interactions in predator-prey networks [61].
Many structural properties correlate with network size [23]. To enable
comparisons between networks with variable species richness, we measured
relative nestedness and modularity: ∆Ni and ∆Mi , respectively. As before, i
refers to the cutoff value, and ∆ measures the difference between the
structural measurement of an empirical (isotopic) network and a model
network with 1) the same species richness, and 2) the same predator:prey ratio
[66]. A value of ‘0’ indicates no difference between the structure of the
empirical network and that of the model; if ∆ > 0, the empirical network has a
higher value than expected by chance; if ∆ < 0, the empirical network has a
lower value than expected by chance.

Results

To determine the degree that predator-prey interactions varied across space,
we first quantified the proportional contribution of prey to predator diets using
the stable isotope ratios of predators and prey. Posterior probability densities
that describe the dietary contribution of prey groups to predators present in
both Beringia and Europe were compared. If predator diet was constrained

9

over space, these probability densities were not expected to vary from Beringia
to Europe, thus falling on the 1:1 axis when plotted against one-another (figure
2; see online supplementary materials, appendix IV for additional details).
During the pre-Glacial, felids in both Beringia and Europe had relatively low
proportional contributions of prey groups that were found in both regions
(median contributions for 5 shared taxa, Beringia: 8%; Europe: 7%), while ca.
60% and 65% of their diets were derived from herbivores unique to each
locality, respectively. By comparison, both Canis and Ursus arctos had
posterior probability densities of shared prey that were variable (figure 2A).
We note that the posterior distributions for the presence of Caprine bovids in
the diets of Canis were bimodal in Europe. Bimodal link-strength
distributions are interpreted as alternative hypotheses of prey contributions,
with probabilities given by the densities of prey contribution estimates.
During the post-Glacial, felid prey-contribution distributions revealed strong
dependencies on Rangifer in both locations (median contribution, Beringia:
57%; Europe: 51%). Canids show a strong dependence on Bison in Beringia,
but not in Europe (mean contribution, Beringia: 57%; Europe: 8%), whereas
post-Glacial ursids were dependent on Rangifer in Beringia but not in Europe
(median contribution, Beringia: 66%; Europe: 2%).
The degree of dietary specialization can be used to summarize consumer
dietary strategies, and is a useful metric for comparing consumer populations
over both space and time [43]. We calculated dietary specialization for
predators in each mammoth steppe predator-prey community (Fig 3). Dietary
specialization () ranges from 0, where all prey are consumed in equal
proportions (dietary generalist), to 1, where one prey is consumed to the
exclusion of all others (dietary specialist; see online supplementary materials,
appendix V). We determined Arctodus to be a specialist predator in Beringia

10

(particularly in the pre-Glacial;  = 0.58; this and hereafter are median
values), relying primarily on either Rangifer or Symbos in the pre-Glacial, and
switching to Bos during the LGM ( = 0.35; electronic supplementary
material, figure S1). Ursus, by contrast, was a generalist in the pre-Glacial
and LGM (pre-Glacial:  = 0.22; LGM: 0.23), but after the extinction of
Arctodus adopted a more specialized diet on Rangifer in the post-Glacial
( = 0.42). Canis and both Beringian felids had generalist diets spanning the
entire time interval (Canis pre-Glacial:  = 0.24, LGM: 0.23, post-Glacial:
0.32; felids pre-Glacial:  = 0.22, LGM: 0.23; post-Glacial: 0.28).
In Europe, predators tended to have more specialized diets. Canis (greatest
dietary contribution from either Rupicapra or cervids;  = 0.48) and to a lesser
degree Ursus (greatest dietary contribution from Rupicapra;  = 0.36) had
relatively more specialized diets in the pre-Glacial. In the post-Glacial, Gulo
and Lynx had specialist diets, scavenging (it is assumed) on Mammuthus
( = 0.55) and specializing on Lepus ( = 0.51), respectively (electronic
supplementary material, figure S2). The consumption of Lepus by Lynx is
consistent with observed predator-prey interactions in North America today
[57]. In contrast, Crocuta had variable dietary proclivities in the pre-Glacial
(Ardennes:  = 0.21; Swabian Jura: 0.41), while H. neanderthalensis had
relatively generalist diets (Ardennes:  = 0.30, Swabian Jura: 0.32, based on a
δ 15 N discrimination factor of 4.5h, see online supplementary materials,
appendix II). H. neanderthalensis was primarily consuming Mammuthus in the
Ardennes (46% median contribution) and both Mammuthus and Equus in
Swabian Jura (46% and 26% median contribution, respectively; electronic
supplementary material, figure S3), supporting results reported by Bocherens
et al. [13]. An assessment of Neanderthal diet with a δ 15 N discrimination
factor of 3.5h increases estimates of Mammuthus specialization to 52% median

11

contribution in the Ardennes, and 73% median contribution in Swabian Jura.
Both proportional contribution and specialization estimates can be examined
for each predator separately, or for the predator guild as a whole, the latter
resulting in measurements made across predators in a community. In Beringia,
the across-predator reliance on specific prey showed strong similarities across
the entire time interval (figure 4A). In the pre-Glacial, Bos, Symbos, and to a
lesser extent Rangifer, were heavily preyed upon by the predator guild. After
the local extinction of Symbos during the LGM, Bos and Rangifer remained
important prey resources, while the proportional contribution of Bison
increased slightly. Across the interval, Equus and Mammuthus had the lowest
proportional contribution values. Dietary specialization of the predator guild
as a whole did not change between the pre-Glacial LGM (g = 0.26 for both,
where the subscript g denotes guild; figure 4B). Specialization among
predators increased in the post-Glacial (g = 0.35), indicating a heavier
reliance on a smaller subset of prey. This trend appears to be driven largely by
an increase in the importance of Rangifer to the predator guild (figure 4).
Although European predators did not show consistent trends in prey reliance
between the pre- and post-Glacial, predator guild specialization increased in
the post-Glacial period, from g = 0.34 in both pre-Glacial Ardennes and
Swabian Jura, to g = 0.44 in post-Glacial Jura (electronic supplementary
material, figure S4).
Analysis of relative nestedness (∆N ) revealed that trophic interactions in
Beringian and European predator-prey networks are not more nested than
expected by chance (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). The
absence of nested interactions has been observed in other predator-prey
systems [59, 66], and our measurement of nestedness across cutoff values shows
that this property is absent in both the whole network (low cutoff values -

12

accounting for both weakly and strongly interacting species) as well as for
strongly interacting species (high cutoff values). Analysis of relative
modularity (∆M) showed Beringian networks to be modular in the
pre-Glacial, particularly for strongly interacting species (where only
proportional contributions of prey ≥ 0.3 and 0.5 are considered, corresponding
to cutoff values 0.3 to 0.5) (figure 5A), non-modular during the LGM, and
with some modularity (for cutoff values 0.2-0.3) in the post-Glacial (figure 5A;
solid lines). In this analysis, we consider two δ 15 N trophic discrimination
factors to be equally likely (online supplementary materials, appendix II),
however measurements of carnivores in the sub-arctic suggest that this value
may be closer to ∆15 N = 4.5h. If a δ 15 N TDF closer to 4.5h is considered for
the Beringian systems [24], modularity is increased during both the LGM and
post-Glacial (figure 5A; stippled lines). This suggests that our estimates of
modularity may be overly conservative. In contrast, Europe showed little to no
modularity across all cutoff values (figure 5B).

Discussion

The cooling and drying trends associated with the LGM were particularly
significant in northeastern Siberia and Beringia [28], but had large effects on
the environment across the entire mammoth steppe. Analysis of the
organization and magnitude of trophic interactions in mammalian
communities before, during, and after the LGM provides insight regarding 1)
the extent to which species interactions varied across the mammoth steppe, 2)
if interaction structures, measured on different scales, were impacted by the
LGM, and 3) if so, whether these structures returned to a pre-perturbation
state after the LGM. Understanding the flexibility of mammalian
predator-prey networks, and whether the interactions that form these systems

13

can be re-established after global climatic perturbations, is relevant to current
problems facing modern ecosystems.

4.1

Spatio-temporal patterns of species interaction

Our comparison of Beringian and European link-strength distributions show
felid diets to be more constrained over space than those of Canis or Ursus,
particularly in the post-Glacial (figure 2). Rangifer became an important
component of felid diets in the post-Glacial, coinciding with an observed
increase in Rangifer abundance, particularly in North America ca. 20 kyr BP
[35], although we cannot rule out that this dietary switch was a consequence of
behavioral changes independent of prey population dynamics. The strongest
dietary estimates, corresponding to the peak densities of prey contribution
distributions, for Canis and Ursus show different patterns than those of felids,
however the increase in Rangifer abundance may have impacted these
predators as well. The dissimilarity in Canis and Ursus diets highlights their
ecological plasticity, particularly during the post-Glacial. Previous studies
have shown Canis to be a generalist predator during the Pleistocene [34, 24];
we show that not only are they generalists at the locality level, but that they
are also highly flexible in prey choices in both space and time. Modern wolves
are opportunistic predators [45, 56], but often specialize on locally abundant
cervids [40]. Some of the variability in Pleistocene canid diets may relate to a
greater diversity of wolf ecomorphs. The eastern Beringian population, for
example, had a more robust cranial morphology associated with scavenging
[34]. Although the intercontinental ranges shared by felids, Canis, and Ursus,
are a testament to their success, felids appear to have more constrained diets
over the mammoth steppe ecosystem. If dietary constraints lead to a greater
risk of population extinction [38, 63, 50], these differences among taxa may

14

have contributed to the range contraction of large felids across Eurasia, while
Canis and Ursus retained their spatial distributions into the late Holocene.
While felids consumed a similar diet across the mammoth steppe (especially in
the post-Glacial), our quantification of dietary specialization reveals that they
were strong dietary generalists, particularly in Europe (figure 3). Canis and
Ursus were also generalist feeders, with some temporal variation. In contrast,
the short-faced bear Arctodus was a dietary specialist in the pre-Glacial,
relying primarily on Rangifer (supporting results by Fox-Dobbs et al. [24]).
During the LGM, however, Arctodus prey-contribution estimates reveal a
switch towards Bos, after which the short-faced bear disappears from the fossil
record. It is interesting to note that Arctodus is the only Beringian predator
whose reliance on Rangifer decreased after the pre-Glacial. If Rangifer was a
preferred food of Arctodus (as the pre-Glacial isotope record suggests), a
scenario in which short-faced bears were competitively displaced by
co-occurring predators is a possibility.
In Europe predator specialization is more variable. The low  values among
felids in the pre-Glacial (possibly due to dietary specialization among
individuals [14], which could result in population-level generalization) are
similar to those for neanderthals, however prey-contribution results show felids
consume relatively greater amounts of Rangifer (particularly in Swabian Jura),
while neanderthals consumed Mammuthus and Equus. We have not considered
the impact of Homo sapiens in European sites, and cannot rule out the
possibility that the presence of human hunter-gatherers may have contributed
to observed predator specialization.

15

4.2

Spatio-temporal patterns of community organization

Consumption of prey species by the predator guild is strongly consistent in
pre-Glacial, LGM, and post-Glacial Beringia (figure 4A). Although it has been
noted that Mammuthus was under-utilized in Beringia in all time periods [24],
our results show a similarly low reliance on Bison and Equus. The low
contribution of Bison may be the consequence of a sharp decline in Bison
abundance beginning ca. 35 kyr BP, and accelerating after 16 kyr BP [53, 35].
A shift to a reliance on Rangifer by the entire predator guild mirrors the
dietary switch observed for felids. There are no consistent patterns of resource
acquisition among European predators between pre- and post-Glacial times,
but in contrast to the situation in Beringia, Mammuthus is a more important
prey resource across the entire time interval, while Equus is an important
resource in all sites but the Ardennes.
We find in both Beringia (figure 4B) and Europe that specialization in the
predator guild as a whole (g ) increased in the post-Glacial, indicating that a
smaller proportion of available prey species were more heavily used across
predator species. Changes in prey abundance undoubtedly affected predator
species differently. The observed increase in dietary specialization at the guild
level indicates a general trend towards increasing resource specialization
among predators, coincident with a general decline and range contraction of
many Eurasian herbivores [35]. In Beringia this trend appears to be largely
influenced by the increased contribution of Rangifer to the diets of predators,
while European predators tend to have more idiosyncratic specializations.

4.3

Linking species interactions to large-scale community
structure

Our analysis of relative nestedness and modularity (∆N and ∆M,
respectively) reveals within-region similarities and between-region differences
from the pre- to post-Glacial. Thus there are large-scale structural differences
in the organization of species interactions, despite the presence of similar taxa,
across the mammoth steppe. Nestedness is low in both regions across all time
intervals. As dynamical analyses have shown nestedness to be a destabilizing
structure in food webs [59, 3], its absence may have promoted stability during
the dramatic climate changes across the LGM.
Modularity is also low in Europe, but is relatively high in pre-Glacial Beringia,
as well as in LGM and post-Glacial Beringia if trophic discrimination factors
were large (figure 5). Modularity in pre-Glacial Beringia chiefly originates
from a strong similarity in prey choice by Canis and Ursus, whereas felids and
Arctodus have more idiosyncratic diets across the LGM (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). Modularity is associated with dynamic
stability and increased persistence [27, 59, 58], and implies that the pre-, and
perhaps the LGM and post-Glacial Beringian systems were more internally
stable than European systems. Although the modularity of species
interactions changes from Beringia to Europe, it does not appear to change
much over time, suggesting that the LGM had little impact on the structure of
predator-prey networks, despite significant changes in the interactions between
species. It also suggests that mammoth steppe communities were well-adapted
to the climatic perturbations associated with the LGM, and is consistent with
the notion that climate change was not solely responsible for the
end-Pleistocene extinctions [32, 25].
There are two potential explanations that account for the spatial differences in

17

modularity across the mammoth steppe. In Beringia, the spatial segregation of
plant species with either physiognomic differences or preferences for different
micro-habitats could result in modular predator-prey interactions. For
example, modern East African food webs are compartmentalized into spatial
guilds (woodland vs. grassland) [7], that are especially pronounced for
strongly linked species [66]. These spatial guilds have distinct δ 13 C values
because of the differences between C3 - and C4 -photosynthetic plants.
In Beringia, spatial variability of plant isotope values could arise from 1)
isotopic differences in plants inhabiting different micro-habitats (where small
differences in humidity, rainfall, or soil moisture may impact the isotopic
values of local plant tissues [46]), leading to differences among herbivores that
consume plants in these micro-habitats (and by extension, their predators), or
2) isotopic differences among different plant functional types (e.g. shrubs,
grasses, lichen), such that the dietary preferences of herbivores result in
isotopic differentiation among browsers, grazers, and their respective predators
[8, 22]. Two lines of evidence suggest that the latter is more likely:
within-region variation in herbivore dental micro- and mesowear reveal strong
dietary differences among herbivores [52], and significant differentiation exists
in the isotopic values of different plant functional groups [24]. Thus, we
conclude that it is more likely that herbivores accumulated distinct isotopic
values as a function of dietary differences rather than from foraging in
isotopically-distinct micro-habitats. Although the spatial patterning of
vegetation in Beringia is disputed [28, 68], there is little support for spatial
differentiation of plant functional types at the scale present in African
savanna-woodland environments, particularly during the LGM [28]. This
suggests that there may be an alternative explanation for the modularity of
Beringian predator-prey networks.

This explanation of modular network structure invokes the insularity of the
Beringian mammoth steppe community relative to that of Europe. Modular
food webs are defined by dietary resource segregation among consumers [27].
Resource segregation can occur over ecological, but also evolutionary
timescales, where coevolutionary relationships may begin to constrain the
plasticity of trophic interactions, promoting compartmentalization [26]. In
isolated environments, where neighboring systems are similar and invasions are
rare, differentiation of resources and the subsequent development of modular
interactions may be more likely to occur and reinforced over time. In contrast,
systems that are bordered by a diverse array of animal communities and are
highly diffuse may be held in a transient state such that niche diversification is
continually interrupted, limiting compartmentalization. We suggest that
pre-Glacial - and possibly LGM and post-Glacial - Beringia may have been
modular due to stronger homogeneity with, and periodic isolation from,
neighboring communities. This insularity would serve to limit invasions of
species from dissimilar communities, allowing consumers to minimize
competitive overlap while maximizing resource diversity. Europe, by
comparison, was an ecological nexus [1], where the periodic influx of species
from diverse communities may have limited niche diversification among
species, preventing compartmentalization, and resulting in the unstructured
predator-prey networks that we observe across the LGM. We are not aware of
any analysis designed to test this specific mechanism for preserving (or
disrupting) modularity, and we suggest that this would be a fruitful theoretical
exercise.
Modern mammalian communities are remnants of a rich Pleistocene heritage.
Knowledge of the relationships among Pleistocene species will inform our
understanding of extant ecosystems. Moreover, studies of past ecosystems

19

permit an examination of how communities responded to climatic or other
external perturbations over long timescales. Because many species inhabiting
mammoth steppe environments are present (and in many cases at risk) in
modern ecosystems, reconstruction of the structure of species interactions
across the LGM is increasingly relevant for understanding the potential
resilience and plasticity of modern species.
