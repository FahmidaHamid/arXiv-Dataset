Abstract.
As a harvested species is depleted, its harvest price often rises due to falling supply, rarity value, or
both. There is concern that high price flexibility can cause extinction by buffering harvest profits
against abundance declines. However, harvest costs also tend to increase as a population declines.
Here, I derive a simple rule of thumb for determining whether prices might rise faster than costs as a
population is depleted – indicating susceptibility to severe overharvesting under open-access.
Comparing this rule of thumb to a review of empirical evidence from marine species, I find that
conditions leading costs to be insensitive to abundance declines – particularly catch rates insensitive to
abundance declines, termed ‘hyperstable’, usually as a result of range contraction – are much more
common than high price flexibility, even in highly valued species such as bluefin tunas, sturgeons,
whales and abalones. My analysis suggests that factors potentially causing coincident range contraction
as a population declines – including herding or schooling behavior and habitat destruction – may be
important but underappreciated factors contributing to price-related extinction threats.

Introduction
There is concern that a number of species may be threatened with extinction by the market
values of their harvest products. These include species hunted for trophies (e.g., Biggs et al. 2013),
collections (e.g., Tournant et al. 2012), body parts regarded as having medicinal or aphrodisiac
properties (e.g., Angulo & Courchamp 2009), or luxury foods (e.g., Gault et al. 2008; Collette et al.
2011; Purcell et al. 2014). Many of these species have already suffered substantial population declines,
prompting listing by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (IUCN
2013), the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES 2014), or both.
Expanding human populations coupled with rapid economic growth in developing countries with large
luxury harvest markets may increase pressures on these species in the coming decades (Graham-Rowe
2011; Purcell et al. 2014).
Some are concerned that the market value of these rare species’ harvests might increase as they
become rarer, leading to an extinction spiral in which profits – and by extension incentives to harvest –
are buffered against rising search costs as the populations are depleted. Courchamp et al. (2006) termed
this ‘the Anthropogenic Allee Effect’ (AAE). Recent studies have provided empirical evidence of
rising prices coinciding with declining abundance in sturgeons (Gault et al. 2008), mammals (Palazy et
al. 2011, 2012a,b), and beetles (Tournant et al. 2012) (see Angulo & Courchamp 2009; Angulo et al.
2009 for more general experiments) – citing these trends as evidence of extinction threats from AAE.
However, others (e.g., Mysterud 2012; Harris et al. 2013; Lyons & Natutsch 2013) have
disputed the strength of this evidence, pointing out that: (i) rising prices in response to declines are not
a sufficient condition for extinction, as costs also rise; (ii) the AAE framework is built on an
assumption of open-access harvesting, which is likely to be violated in harvests that have some form of
central management, cooperative governance, or property rights; and (iii) in cases where only a specific
segment of the population is targeted (e.g. trophy hunting of only large males), the population as a
whole may not be as susceptible to collapse.
2

Here, I address the first of these concerns. I derive a simple rule of thumb that provides a first
approximation of whether the harvest prices of a species or population are likely to rise faster than
harvest costs as they are depleted – an indication of AAE susceptibility under open-access.
Prices will be sensitive (‘flexible’) to abundance declines if consumer demand is inelastic
(Asche et al. 2007) – meaning quantities demanded are relatively insensitive to prices; if rarity itself
fuels increases in demand (Courchamp et al. 2006; Hall et al. 2008); or both. Moreover, any flexibility
of prices driven by consumer demand must be transmissible through the supply chain to the harvesters
themselves (Asche et al. 2007). Costs will be insensitive to abundance declines if catch-rates are
insensitive (often termed ‘hyperstable’ (Harley et al. 2001)) to abundance, or if there are economies of
scale – meaning that larger harvest quantities come at lower average costs, holding abundance constant
(Torres & Felthoven 2014). The rule of thumb I propose compares the strengths of these relationships.
I then review past empirical estimates of price flexibility, catch hyperstability, and returns to
scale in marine species, emphasizing species thought to be threatened by their rising harvest prices
currently or in the past. Drawing on this evidence, I argue that prices, even of the most valued species,
are rarely responsive enough to declining abundance to allow profits to be maintained unless catch
hyperstability or returns to scale is significant. Significantly hyperstable catch rates are quite common
however – caused by aggregation behavior (e.g. schooling or herding) (Winters & Wheeler 1985;
Bjorndal & Conrad 1987; Mackinson et al. 1997), technology or communication among harvesters
(Hilborn & Walters 1987; Gaertner & Dreyfus-Leon 2004; Thorson & Berkson 2010; Torres-Irineo et
al. 2014), and also, I hypothesize, by habitat destruction.
The AAE mechanism, which is the focus of my analysis, is one of many possible mechanisms
of extinction by overharvesting (see Dulvy et al. 2003 for review of some of the others). For example,
a species might also be driven extinct if it is caught opportunistically or accidentally in a harvest
targeting other species that can support large harvest efforts (Branch et al. 2013; Gaines & Costello
2013). A species might be driven extinct if its growth rate is smaller than the market interest rate or the
3

discount rate of harvesters; harvesters would then have an economic incentive to harvest the entire
population as quickly as possible in order to convert it into a more productive asset (Clark 1973;
Swanson 1994). Extinction would be likely if a population experienced either depensation (Courchamp
et al. 1999) or extinction from stochastic forces (Lande et al. 2003) at population sizes large enough for
harvesting to still be profitable (Berck 1979). These other overharvesting threats are beyond the scope
of my analysis, but the development of integrated approaches to assess combinations of harvesting and
other threats is an important area of future research.

Methods
Model
I derive a rule-of-thumb test for AAE susceptibility using simple but fairly standard models of
harvest productivity, price formation, and population dynamics. The rule of thumb is designed to
provide a simple indication of whether harvest prices might rise faster than harvest costs as a
population of interest is depleted. The models are kept quite simple to maximize the breadth of
empirical applicability, but aim to capture as many important aspects as possible.
I assume the following general model of the population’s dynamics:
dN
= Ng ( N ) −Y (1).
dt

Here, g(N) is the per-capita growth rate of the population, and is subject to negative density
dependence (g!(N) < 0) with no depensation (g(N) ≥ 0); Y is the harvest (yield).
I assume that harvest (Y) is a function of harvest effort expenditure (E) (in monetary units (e.g.,
dollars), not search time, traps, hooks, or other raw effort units), and population size (N), with constant
elasticities to each sensu Clark & Munro (1975),

Y = qE α N β (2a).

4

Here, q, α, and β are non-negative constants. Parameters α and β are ‘elasticities’ because they
measure the percent change in yield resulting from a one percent change in expenditure (α) or
abundance (β), all else equal (i.e. (δY/δE)(E/Y) = α; (δY/δN)(N/Y) = β). Elasticity α represents the
returns to scale and β is the elasticity of production to the stock size. The cost, C, of obtaining a unit of
harvest, as a function of abundance, can be derived by setting Y = 1 in equation (2a) and solving for E:
−

1

C (N ) = q α N

−

β
α

(2b).

I assume that the price of a unit of catch, p, in a given time period is a function of the total
supply of catch in that time period (Y) and other unspecified factors, X (X = {Xi}i). I again assume a
constant elasticity of price (p) to supply (Y) and that factors X (e.g., size of the economy, supplies of
related goods, etc.) are not directly related to either abundance (N) or supply (Y) (i.e. δXj/δN = 0, δXj/δY
= 0 for all j).
p (Y, X ) = p0Y − f PX ( X ) (3).

Here, p0 is a positive constant, and f, assumed here to be a non-negative constant, represents the
elasticity of price to supply, which economists term the ‘price flexibility of demand’ (Houck 1965;
Barten & Bettendorf 1989; Schrank & Roy 1991; Eales et al. 1997). The price flexibility is related to,
but distinct from, the demand elasticity (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information for brief
discussion) ((δp/δY)(Y/p) = –f). PX(.) is an unspecified function.
Though perceptions of rarity, which might be directly related to abundance (N) more than
supply, are thought to be important in driving price increases (Courchamp et al. 2006), I posit that
these rarity effects can most likely be captured by estimates of price flexibility in practice for the
following reasons. First, if abundance (N) is not known, then perceptions of rarity likely come from
observations of supply (Y) (e.g., Gault et al. 2008), and would thus be incorporated into f. Second, if
abundance (N) is known, but strongly correlated with supply (Y), estimation of f alone would capture

5

the perceived rarity effect on prices; and f would probably be more reliably estimated than separate
effects mediated by supply and abundance, due to high multicollinearity. If rarity influences consumer
demand through discrete (rather than continuous) perceptions (i.e., a species is perceived to be ‘rare’ or
‘not rare’), then rarity effects on demand could be accounted for empirically within a price flexibility
(f) estimation framework that allows for discrete shifts in the demand function (see Asche & Zhang
(2013) for an example and estimation method).
The core question in this study is whether prices should be expected to rise faster than costs as
the population’s abundance declines. It makes sense to ask this question under biological equilibrium
conditions (i.e. dN/dt = 0). In other words, we are asking what the resulting unit price equilibrium (p*)
and unit harvest cost equilibrium (C*) would be if abundance was fixed at N*; and we are asking how
changing N* would affect p* relative to C*. Fixing N without assuming biological equilibrium would be
self-contradictory because dN/dt ≠ 0 would mean N was changing. At biological equilibrium, N*,

Y = N * g ( N * ) (4a).
This implies that,
−f

p* ( N *, X ) = p0 N *− f g ( N * ) PX ( X ) (4b).

Putting equations (2b) and (4b) together gives the following equation for the ratio of
equilibrium unit price and unit cost (p*/C*):
p* ( N *, X )

Thus, the percent change in the equilibrium ratio of price and cost (p*/C*) resulting from a one percent
change in abundance (N*), (δ(p*/C*)/δN*)(N*/(p*/C*)), is given by:

The population’s equilibrium harvest price (p*) rises faster than the equilibrium harvest cost
(C*) as abundance (N*) is depleted if (δ(p*/C*)/δN*) < 0. Because abundance (N), price (p), and cost (C)
all must be non-negative, (δ(p*/C*)/δN*) < 0 implies (δ(p*/C*)/δN*)(N*/(p*/C*)) < 0, and vice-versa,

Moreover, because g!(N) < 0 and N, g(N) ≥ 0; implying Ng!(N)/g(N) ≤ 0; inequality (7a) can only be
satisfied if:

α
If (β/α) > f, equation (5) implies that the ratio of price to cost (p/C) approaches 0 (equivalent to profits
(π = Y(p – C)) approaching 0) as the population declines to extinction (N→0).
Thus, the AAE is only possible in this model if inequality (7b) is satisfied. The assumption of
constant elasticities (α, β, f) is unrealistic, though likely as accurate and complex of an approximation
as can be supported by data in most harvests. Moreover, even if these elasticities (α, β, f) were
dynamic, inequality (7b) might still need to be satisfied for AAE, which would still require prices to
consistently rise faster than costs as abundance declines, even if the magnitude of the difference varied.
In Appendices S2 and S3 (Supporting Information), respectively, I briefly discuss the impacts
of incorporating substitute goods and technical change in the model. I refer the reader to Squires &
Vestergaard (2013a,b) for excellent summaries of the impacts of technical change in harvests in
general. Briefly, the main results (inequalities (7a,b)) are robust to these complexities, provided there
are no perfect substitutes (goods that are indistinguishable from the harvest product of interest to
consumers) and technical change is either unrelated to expenditure (e.g., learning by doing (Squires &
Vestergaard 2013b)) or related to expenditure in a manner that can be captured by measuring returns to
7

scale (α). The existence of perfect substitutes negates the possibility of an AAE threat unless equation
(7b) is satisfied for all species within a group of perfect substitutes. Though relevant to extinction in
general (see Clark 1973; Swanson 1994), discounting is not included in the model because it is
irrelevant to the question of whether prices rise faster than costs as a population is depleted.

Application
The available data for a species or population of interest determine how rule of thumb (7b)
might be most precisely and accurately tested. At a bare minimum, estimating price flexibility requires
price (p) and quantity (Y) data; but additional data – on incomes, consumer expenditures, and quantities
of related goods – is preferable to guard against omitted variable bias. The simplest regression equation
for estimating price flexibility (f), assuming it is constant, can be derived by taking the log of both sides
of equation (3), which yields equation (8):

log ( pt ) = a − f log (Yt ) + log ( PX ( Xt )) (8).
Here, a is the intercept (a = log(p0)). More sophisticated estimation methods also exist, but tend to have
larger data requirements. For example, most modern methods jointly estimate systems of inverse
demand equations for groups of related harvest products (e.g., fresh and frozen tunas in Chiang et al.
2001) to estimate f, rather than separately estimating separate equations for each product. This typically
requires short time-scale market-level price and quantity data for all products, as well as other data
deemed relevant (e.g., household expenditures or income) (e.g., Eales et al. 1997).
If effort expenditure (E), total harvest (Y) and abundance (N) data are available, then elasticities

β and α, or their ratio (β/α) can be estimated from the regression equations (9a,b) (derived from
equations (2a,b)) (e.g., Amundsen et al. 1995),
log (Yt ) = b + α log ( Et ) + β log ( N t ) (9a).

where b and c are constant intercepts (b = log(q); c = log(q(1/ )).
α

Detailed expenditure data are often not available, however (e.g., see Lam et al. 2011 for a
recent review in fisheries). If expenditure data (E) are not available, but abundance data (N) and catchper-unit-effort (CPUE) data (in units of catch-per-days harvesting or -hooks, -trips, -traps, etc.) are,
then estimating the elasticity of CPUE to N (here denoted γ), from equation (9c) below, can provide a
useful proxy for either β or (β/α), depending on how scale affects costs (measured by α):
log (CPUE t ) = c + γ log ( N t ) (9c).

Harley et al. (2001) discuss more sophisticated methods for estimating γ from equation (9c), which
they call β, and is often measured or approximated in fisheries. If scale affects the average costs of
effort (hooks, days, etc.) (e.g., bait and fuel is cheaper in bulk quantities), but CPUE is impacted mostly
by the population dynamics, then CPUE ≅ Y E α , and γ and β can indeed be treated as equivalent.
However, if scale primarily affects the relationship between the quantity of effort (hooks, days, etc.)
and catch rates, with costs of effort being mostly constant, then CPUE ≅ Y/E, implying that γ ≅ (β/α),
not β. A species’ catch rates are said to be ‘hyperstable’ if γ < 1 (Harley et al. 2001).
Abundance data are also often not available. In such cases, I hypothesize that β can be
effectively approximated as follows, if fractional changes between two time periods (denoted 1 and 2)
in both abundance (ΔN = (N2 – N1)/N1) and geographic range size (denoted A) (ΔA = (A2 – A1)/A1) are
known for the population of interest:

β≈

$ 1+ ΔN '
% change in density

−1) ΔN (9d).
% change in abundance % 1+ ΔA (

As a proof of concept, I apply this approximation method to tunas in Appendix S4 (Supporting
Information). Estimates of β from equation (9d) are consistent with β-values from the literature.

Equation (9d) makes use of the fact that range contraction in declining populations is thought to
be one of the main drivers of hyperstable catch rates (γ < 1) (Winters & Wheeler 1985; Mackinson et
al. 1997). Range contraction buffers population density (the main biological determinant of CPUE)
against reductions in overall abundance (see Brown 1984; Lawton 1993 for theoretical discussion;
Ceballos & Ehrlich 2002; Laliberte & Ripple 2004 for terrestrial examples; Winters & Wheeler 1985;
Worm & Tittensor 2011 for marine examples). Aggregating species (forming schools or herds) often
manifest declines to a greater extent as range contractions than density reductions (Winters & Wheeler
1985; Mackinson et al. 1997), for example. Other factors (besides range contraction) can also cause
hyperstable relationships between CPUE and abundance, including technological improvement,
learning, and information sharing among harvesters (e.g. Hilborn & Walters 1987; Gaertner &
Dreyfus-Leon 2004; Thorson & Berkson 2010; Torres-Irineo et al. 2014). However, these might more
likely be components of α than β.
Elasticities of scale (α) may be difficult to estimate in low-data situations, particularly when
illegal harvests are involved; there are no easy ways around requirements of cost (E) and abundance
(N) data (e.g., Amundsen et al. 1995). In such cases, I suggest assuming either constant returns to scale
(α = 1), or assuming a value of α estimated from a related harvest type. If estimates or approximations
of β and f are available, then inequality (7b) can be used to determine the threshold value of α that
would signal a potential threat (α > fβ). This allows the rule of thumb to be applied even with large
potential uncertainty in α (or analogously, in one of the other parameters).

Results
Review of Empirical Evidence
Estimates of price flexibility of demand (f) for fish products have varied among species,
commodity types, and estimation methods, but have mostly been 0.5 or smaller, even for high-value
10

products (e.g. Schrank & Roy 1991; Eales et al. 1997; Jaffry et al. 1999; Chiang et al. 2001; Asche et
al. 2007; Asche & Zhang 2013; Scheld & Anderson 2014), suggesting an often proportionally small
response of fish prices to falling supply. Moreover, studies of fish demand have found ex-vessel prices
to be less flexible than retail prices (Asche et al. 2007). Studies of market integration (substitutability)
have found high substitutability between species within broad classes of fish products, including
salmon, whitefish – including cod, haddock, saithe, hake and pollock (see Asche et al. 2007 for review;
Scheld & Anderson 2014) – and substitutability, but not perfect substitutability, between most tuna
species (Chiang et al. 2001; Sakai et al. 2009).
Even the most highly valued aquatic species seem to have relatively inflexible prices (f << 1).
To illustrate this point, Figure 1 shows aggregate price-supply relationships for several populations
believed to be threatened by high and rising values currently or in the past: bluefin tunas (Atlantic
bluefin tuna – ABF – Thunnus thynnus, Pacific bluefin tuna – PBF – Thunnus orientalis, and Southern
bluefin tuna – SBT – Thunnus maccoyii)) (data from Ricard et al. 2012; Sea Around Us Project 2014;
R. Hilborn, pers. comm.), caviar-producing sturgeons (Acipenseriformes) (data from FAO 2014), the
Northeast Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) (a relatively data-rich whale example;
data from Amundsen et al. 1995), and abalone species (Haliotis sp.) harvested in California (data from
Hobday & Regner 2000; Courchamp et al. 2006).
The price flexibility, f, of fresh bluefin tuna (lumped ABF, PBF, and SBT) in Japan was
estimated by Chiang et al. (2001) to be 0.19, indicating a 0.19% increase in price for every 1%
decrease in supply, with low to moderate substitutability between bluefin and bigeye (Thunnus obesus)
and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas. This is consistent with relative historical stability observed in
aggregate prices (Figure 1A,B). Historical caviar prices (1976-2010; Figure 1C; FAO 2014) have risen
more than those of bluefin tunas (~0.3% for every 1% decline in catch), but are still consistent with the
common finding that harvest prices tend to rise by half of the percentage by which harvest supplies
decline, or less. Northeastern minke whale prices showed a stronger price trend (~0.65% increase on
11

average for every 1% decline in catch (Figure 1D)), before the International Whaling Commission’s
moratorium on whaling came into effect in the late 1980s (Amundsen et al. 1995). Abalone prices in
California seem to have been more flexible, increasing by roughly 1% (0.98%) for every 1% decline in
abundance over the period 1950-1993, before the 1997 ban on fishing (Figure 1E) (Hobday & Tegner
2000; Courchamp et al. 2006). These historical trends do not necessarily reflect the magnitudes of
underlying market-level price flexibilities, but they are mostly consistent with the pervading pattern of
low price flexibility (f < 1) seen in other marine harvest products (Figure 1F). Controlling for catch, the
residual prices of none of these species (for which data are available) are significantly correlated with
abundance (Figure 1G), suggesting that rarity effects in these species may indeed be more strongly
associated with supply than abundance, and thus likely captured by price flexibility.
The pervasive observation of low price flexibility (f < 1, often < 0.5), even in highly valued
aquatic species, suggests that threats of AAE may be uncommon except among species that have
exceptionally stable harvest costs in the face of declining abundance ((β/α) < 0.5) – via hyperstable
catch rates, economies of scale, or both.
However, combinations of hyperstable catch rates and economies of scale of this severity are
quite common in marine systems. For example, across 15 fisheries for which estimates of either scale
elasticity (α) or an equivalent measure of returns to scale (RTS – a composite measure used in studies
of multiple factors of production (e.g., see Torres & Felthoven 2014)) were available, returns to scale
were on average 1.40 (s.d. = 0.50) (1.40 = RTS ≅ α) (Table S1, Supporting Information). This implies
that a population with price flexibility of 0.5 would need an elasticity of production to abundance (β) of
on average about 0.7 or smaller to be susceptible to AAE; a population with price flexibility of 0.2
(e.g., ABF, PBF, or SBT) would need β of on average about 0.3 or smaller.
In fact, estimates of β or γ among schooling species have often been <0.5 and frequently not
significantly different from 0, meaning that CPUE is nearly uncorrelated with abundance. This
12

includes lower-trophic level forage fish, such as the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) Pacific
sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus) (MacCall 1976;
Winters & Wheeler 1985; Bjorndal & Conrad 1987; Bjorndal 1988; Mackinson et al. 1997), in addition
to some larger species. For example, Pintassilgo & Duarte (2002) assume α = 1 and β = 0.2 for most
gears in a model of ABF. Amundsen et al. (1995) estimate α = 0.86-0.87 and β = 0.12-0.14 (though
not significantly different from 0) for the Northeast Atlantic minke whale.
If β = 0 (or γ = 0), then any price flexibility whatsoever (i.e. f > 0) can result in extinction,
termed ‘catchability-led stock collapse’ in fisheries (Pitcher 1995). Other tunas (e.g., SBT, skipjack
(Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin) are thought to have moderate hyperstability (β ≈ 0.3-0.7) in their
surface fisheries (e.g. purse-seine, pole-and-line), which target schools, but little hyperstability (β ≈ 1)
in longline fisheries (Kennedy 1999; Gaertner & Dreyfus-Leon 2004; Ward 2008; Campbell &
Kennedy 2010; Campbell et al. 2010).
A meta-analysis of flatfish (megrim, plaice, sole) and gadiformes (cod, haddock, hake, pollock,
whiting), mostly from trawl fisheries, estimated γ values averaging 0.64-0.75 (Harley et al. 2001).
There have been few estimates of β or γ for commercial fisheries for diadromous species (e.g.
salmonids, sturgeons), but recent estimates of γ from anglers have ranged from ~ 0.6-1 for salmonids
(Tsuboi & Endou 2008; Ward et al. 2013). Though there is little information with which to estimate β
for sturgeons, there may be reason to believe that catches are quite hyperstable (i.e.β << 1), because
many of the most severely depleted caviar-producing sturgeons (e.g. Beluga sturgeon (Huso huso),
Russian sturgeon (Osetr) (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii)) have suffered significant habitat destruction
caused by pollution, hydroelectric dams, and other forms of encroachment (IUCN 2013), which has
likely led to range contraction. There have been no estimates of β in abalones to my knowledge, but
their mostly sessile nature may suggest β ≈ 1.

Discussion
Several studies have empirically demonstrated that harvest prices of rare species rise in
response to falling supply and rarity value (Courchamp et al. 2006; Gault et al. 2008; Angulo et al.
2009; Palazy et al. 2011, 2012a,b; Tournant et al. 2012), sparking concerns about possible AAE
threats. However, it was unknown whether rarity value or other factors could drive prices up fast
enough to maintain harvest profits as a population was depleted (Harris et al. 2013). This study derives
a simple rule of thumb for answering this question: the harvest profits of a population will only be
robust to declining abundance if the own-price flexibility of demand of the population’s harvest is
larger than the ratio of the elasticities of production to abundance and scale (i.e. f > β/α).
To date, the literature on AAE has mostly focused on price trends (Courchamp et al. 2006; Hall
et al. 2008). However, the evidence reviewed in this study suggests that, at least in marine species,
AAE threats are likely to be driven to a greater extent by hyperstable catch rates than rising prices;
prices generally rise proportionally more slowly than catches decrease (f < 0.5 in most studies).
Economies of scale are also common (Table S1), and may exacerbate populations’ susceptibilities to
AAE.
There are several possible reasons for the pervasiveness of low price flexibilities. One
possibility is that even the most highly valued luxuries have at least partial substitutes. Populations
whose harvests have perfect substitutes are very unlikely to be threatened by AAE (Hall et al. 2008),
because perfect substitutability causes the impact of declines in a population’s abundance on its price to
diminish as it approaches extinction (see Appendix S2). A second possibility is that processors and
other market intermediaries may buffer prices against supply shocks (Asche et al. 2007). More research
is needed to estimate price flexibilities and substitutability between highly valued harvest products.
Greater collection and dissemination market- and ex-vessel level price and quantity data for such
products is important to advancing this research agenda.

14

Because price flexibilities are often smaller than 0.5, most harvested populations would likely
need small catch elasticites (β < 0.5) or significant returns to scale to be threatened by AAE. Among
harvested fish populations, those with catch elasticities this small have been predominantly schooling
species, which manifest population declines largely as range contractions, thereby maintaining
population densities (Winters & Wheeler 1985; Mackinson et al. 1997). Some schooling populations
have catch rates that are seemingly uncorrelated with abundance (β ≈ 0) (Mackinson et al. 1997),
which can lead to population collapses regardless of demand or substitutability (‘catchability-led stock
collapse’ (Pitcher 1995)).
Thus, highly valued species that aggregate should be of particular concern for AAE threats. For
example, based on f- and β-values from the literature, Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tuna may be
susceptible to AAE (Chiang et al. 2001 estimate f = 0.19, Pintassilgo & Duarte 2002 assume β = 0.2;
small β is consistent with observed abundance and range trends Appendix S4, Figure S1)). This
possibility merits careful further study, as there are good data in these fisheries – likely sufficient to
quite rigorously estimate β and returns to scale (α). Though seldom studied, it is likely that many
terrestrial harvested species that aggregate have hyperstable catch rates as well. Estimating β in
terrestrial harvests has likely been hindered by difficulty in obtaining catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)
data, particularly in illegal harvests. I offer one possible approach (equation (9d)) to approximating β
from range data, and provide some empirical support for this approach (Appendix S4).
Because range contraction is an important driver of hyperstable catch rates, habitat destruction
could exacerbate overharvesting threats, by buffering population densities against declines in
abundance, and shrinking the search area for harvesters. Habitat destruction is unlikely to be a major
issue for high-seas marine species (Worm & Tittensor 2011), but may be an important consideration
for terrestrial, freshwater, reef, and diadromous species, likely including sturgeons (Lenhardt et al.
2006). Investigating extinction threats posed by catch hyperstability in harvested land animals, and
15

interactions between threats of habitat destruction and overharvesting, are important areas of future
research. The extinct passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which aggregated in large flocks and
suffered both habitat destruction and overharvesting (e.g. Bucher 1992; Hung et al. 2014), is one
potentially interesting historical case study. Climate change could possibly also lead to range
contraction-related overharvesting threats to some species.
This study focuses on AAE, which is an open-access mechanism of extinction. There are
property rights in many harvests, including some poaching (Harris et al. 2013) and many fisheries
(Worm et al. 2009). There is currently some form of management governing harvests of whales
(International Whaling Commission (IWC 2014)), bluefin tunas (CCSBT 2011a,b; IATTC 2012; ISC
2012), and California abalones (Hobday & Tegner 2000). Trade in sturgeons is regulated under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2014). Cooperation, governance, or
management can prevent extinction of a harvested population under many circumstances, but it is
nonetheless important to understand open-access incentives, as access restrictions are rarely perfectly
enforced, particularly in the oceans. There is significant illegal and unreported fishing of southern
bluefin tuna, for example (Polachek 2012), despite a very strong recent tradition of management, led by
the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).
This study considers one type of overharvesting threat (AAE), among many. Direct threats of
incentive-driven extinction due to high discounting (Clark 1973) are not considered; nor are indirect
threats from ecological interactions with other species (e.g. Estes et al. 1998), stochastic forces (Lande
et al. 2003), market interactions (e.g. Sakai et al. 2009), or multispecies or opportunistic harvesting
(e.g. Branch et al. 2013; Gaines & Costello 2013). Future work expanding or combining the rule of
thumb approach presented here with other approaches considering these other factors is a fruitful area
of future research. For example, the indirect threat posed by AAE to bycatch species might be assessed
by comparing their depletion rates (e.g., sensu Burgess et al. 2013) to those of species estimated to be
susceptible to AAE by the approach presented here.
16

Overharvesting threatens many species worldwide (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
Highly-valued, rare species, such as caviar-producing sturgeon species (Lenhardt et al. 2006; Gault et
al. 2008), land-animals hunted for trophies (Johnson et al. 2010; Palazy et al. 2012a), large whales
(Clark 1973; see also Branch et al. 2013), marine invertebrates (Purcell et al. 2014), and highly valued
tunas (Collette et al. 2011), are rapidly declining and are thought to be threatened with extinction as a
result of their rarity-value (Courchamp et al. 2006). This study provides a rule-of-thumb
approximation method for empirically evaluating this threat; and provides evidence suggesting that
hyperstable catch rates resulting from aggregation, range contraction, and possibly habitat destruction,
may be larger drivers of AAE than rising prices, at least in marine species. More research is needed to
evaluate the possible threat of hyperstable catch rates to hunted land-mammals (e.g. rhinos, elephants,
ungulates, large cats), and this study illustrates one possible method that does not require catch data.
The possible synergy between habitat destruction and overharvesting highlighted here merits further
study and conservation attention.

Appendix S1. Price flexibility vs. demand elasticity
Throughout this study, I use price flexibility (f) as a measure of the price-quantity relationship.
It is worth briefly justifying this choice, in relation to the more common measure of quantity-price
relationships, own-price elasticity of demand (usually denoted ε), which measures the percentage
decrease in the quantity of a product demanded in response to a 1% increase in its price. Price
flexibility, f, is related to ε, but not an exact reciprocal for most goods (i.e. f ≠ 1/ε; see Houck 1965;
Schrank & Roy 1991; Eales et al. 1997; Asche et al. 2007). Price flexibility (f) is considered a more
appropriate measure of the quantity-price relationship than ε for harvested products, because quantity is
determined before price, in contrast to many other types of markets (Houck 1965; Barten & Bettendorf
1989). There is also empirical support (e.g., Eales et al. 1997) for price flexibility being a better
measure of quantity-price relationships in harvested species than demand elasticity.

The existence of substitute goods impacts the sensitivity of a population’s harvest price to its
supply because it potentially reduces a consumer’s willingness to pay a higher price (when they could
shift demand to the substitute instead) (Asche et al. 2007). Substitutes can be incorporated into inverse
demand models (those estimating price-dependencies on supplies) by including the substitute supply
quantities in the regression model estimating price flexibility (f) (e.g., Scheld & Anderson 2014). As a
simple example, suppose the price flexibility of population i’s harvest was estimated from an equation
of form (S2.1):

log ( pit ) = a − fi log (Yit ) + ∑ fik log (Ykt ) + log ( PX ( Xt )) (S2.1).
k

Here, PX(X) is again an unspecified function (e.g., of income, etc.), Ykt is the supply of good k in time
period t, and fik is the cross-price flexibility (the elasticity of the price of population i to supply changes
in good k). Good k is a substitute if fik < 0. Provided all Ykt are independent of Yit, and no good, k, is a
perfect substitute of i, the relationship, (δp/δY)(Y/p) = –f, and by extension rule of thumb (7b), still
hold.
However, it is important, for the purposes of both estimating f and more generally predicting
extinction threats to a population, to identify any other species or products that are perfect substitutes,
meaning that consumers do not distinguish between the two products. Perfect substitutes are defined,
for the purpose of my analysis, by the Law of One Price (LOP), which states that perfect substitutes
must either have identical or proportional equilibrium prices (where any proportional differences result
from differences in quality or transportation costs that are immune to arbitrage) (Hotelling 1929; Asche
et al. 1999, 2007). The simplest test for perfect substitutability between two products, 1 and 2,
involves estimating the parameters in the following equation:
log ( p1 ) = a + b log ( p2 ) (S2.2),

2

and testing the hypothesis that b = 1 (perfect substitutability). This equation can also be used to test a
hypothesis of no market interaction (b = 0). Asche et al. (1999, 2007) review other methods for testing
for substitutability (often referred to more broadly as ‘market integration’ in economic studies, as the
LOP depends on both equivalence of products for consumers and ease of arbitrage between markets in
a spatial sense) that can allow for non-stationarity in prices and other dynamic complexities, when
longer unbroken time-series data are available.
Identifying perfect substitutes is important for two reasons. First, if a good, k, is a perfect
substitute for harvest of a population, i (i.e. the LOP holds), then treating them as separate products
creates bias in estimating fi (even if log(Yk) is included in the regression, for example), as the ‘true’ fi
will vary with the supply of the perfect substitute good at each time period. Second, and more
fundamentally, if harvest of population i is part of a set of populations producing equivalent harvests
(denoted S), then the price responds to changes in the total supply of harvest of all populations in S. In
other words, price flexibility, fi, would really describe:

# S Y &
% ∑k=1 k ( ≠ ∂pi #% Yi &( (S2.3).
fi =
S
%
(
∂ ∑ Yk $ pi ' ∂Yi $ pi '
k=1
∂pi

(

)

Under biological equilibrium conditions, Yi = Nigi(Ni), it follows from equation (S2.3) that (δpi/δNi)
approaches 0 as abundance (Ni) approaches 0, eliminating the threat of price-driven extinction, if there
are other more common populations or products which are perfect substitutes (i.e. Yk > 0, for at least
one k). Thus, with respect to price-driven extinction threats, a group of populations whose harvests are
perfect substitutes are only as weak as their strongest (i.e. most slowly depleted) member. This result
may have important implications for rare fish species that are aquacultured. However the assumption
that aquaculture is a perfect substitute for wild harvest remains untested for most species, and evidence
so far suggests that perfect substitutability may be rare (Asche et al. 2001; Natale et al. 2013).

Appendix S3. Technical change
I briefly consider very simple extensions of the modeling framework in this study to account for
technical change, but I refer the reader to Squires & Vestergaard (2013a,b) for a much richer treatment
of technical change in fisheries and other harvests. Recall that the main text assumes a Cobb-Douglas
harvest function (Y) of effort expenditure (E) and population abundance (N):

Y = qE α N β (2a),
which results in the following equation for the costs of obtaining a unit of catch:
−

1

C (N ) = q α N

−

β
α

(2b).

Technical changes can either be exogenous to capital investments by the harvesters (termed
‘disembodied’ by economists), making them a function of time (e.g., learning by doing); or they can
endogenous (‘embodied’), and therefore functions of capital investment (e.g., better equipment)
(Squires & Vestergaard 2013a,b). Thus, a simple way of incorporating technical change into this model
is adding a function representing technology, T(t,K), of time, t, and capital formation, K, into equation
(2a), such that:
Y = qE α N β T (t, K ) (S3.1).

Setting Y = 1 in equation (S3.1), and solving for E, the cost per-unit-catch, C, is given by:
−

1
α

C=q N

−

β
α

−

1

"#T (t, K )$% α (S3.2).

If capital formation, K, and overall expenditure, E, are independent (i.e. K does not depend on E); or if
technical change is strictly disembodied (i.e. T(t,K) = T(t)); then (δC/δN)/(N/C) = – (β/α), and rule of
thumb (7b) applies.
However, things are less straightforward if capital formation is dependent on expenditure (i.e. K
= K(E)) (most likely the case) and technical change is embodied ((δT/δK) ≠ 0). In this case, in order for
effective elasticity of scale (δY/δE)/(E/Y), denoted s, to still be constant, the technology effect, T,
4

would also need to have a constant elasticity to expenditure (δT/δE)/(E/T), denoted τ. With this
assumption, (δC/δN)/(N/C) = – (β/s), where s = α + τ, and rule of thumb (7b) could apply provided the
estimation of returns to scale included embodied technical change (i.e. s, not α, was being estimated).
However, embodied technical change with non-constant elasticity to total expenditure (E) would not be
captured by rule of thumb (7b) and merits explicit consideration when appropriate data are available.

Appendix S4. Proof of concept for equation (9d)
As a proof of concept for equation (9d), I approximate average (i.e. across all gears) β values
for tunas by combining the average observed 1960-1999 range change across the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Indian Oceans estimated by Worm & Tittensor (2011), with estimates from the RAM Legacy Stock
Assessment Database (Ricard et al. 2012) of the abundance change in each population (in units of total
biomass) over the same period. Multiple populations of the same species in the same ocean were
aggregated to be compatible with Worm & Tittensor’s (2011) range change estimates. Estimated range
changes in SBT were averaged across all 3 oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian).
Estimates of β using equation (9d) for tunas are fairly consistent with existing hypotheses
(Figure S1A, B) (e.g., Kennedy 1999; Pintassilgo & Duarte 2002; Campbell & Kennedy 2010;
Campbell et al. 2010). Species caught mostly in longline fisheries (albacore (Thunnus alalunga),
bigeye, SBT) had average β estimates close to 1, while species caught mostly in purse-seine, pole-andline and other surface fisheries targeting schools (ABF, PBF, skipjack, yellowfin), had mostly low to
moderate average β estimates (Figure S1B). Estimates of average β for both ABF and PBF using this
method were close to or below 0, as their ranges have contracted as much or more than their
abundances (Worm & Tittensor 2011; Ricard et al. 2012). It is possible, though unlikely, that the true

βs for these species are negative (this would mean CPUE increases as abundance decreases), but likely
that they are indeed very low. This analysis suggests that range contraction may indeed be a key driver
5

of catch hyperstability, and equation (9d) may provide a useful tool for empirically estimating catch
elasticities (β) when CPUE data is difficult to obtain.

Figure S1. Estimates of catch elasticity (β ) from range in tunas. Panel (A) compares 1960-1999
abundance and range trends in marine tunas (data from Worm & Tittensor 2011; Ricard et al. 2012).
When range does not change with abundance, β would be expected to be 1 (solid grey line). When
range changes proportionally with abundance, density is not correlated with abundance, and β would
be expected to be 0 (dashed grey line). Panel (B) shows estimates of average β for tuna species
calculated using equation (9d) plotted against the fraction of total catch from purse-seine, pole-andline, and other surface fisheries (data from FAO 2014). The solid line is fit to all points, and suggests
an average β of 1.13 in tunas with no catch in surface fisheries, and an average β of 0.03 in tunas
caught exclusively in surface fisheries. The dashed line is fit excluding negative β estimates, and
suggests average βs of 1.04 and 0.79 with no surface fisheries and exclusively surface fisheries,
respectively. These values, and their differences across fishery types, are consistent with estimated
ranges of β for tunas from the literature.
