  High read depth can be used to assemble short sequence repeats. The existing
genome assemblers fail in repetitive regions of longer than average read.
  I propose a new algorithm for a DNA assembly which uses the relative
frequency of reads to properly reconstruct repetitive sequences. The
mathematical model shows the upper limits of accuracy of the results as a
function of read coverage. For high coverage, the estimation error depends
linearly on repetitive sequence length and inversely proportional to the
sequencing coverage. The algorithm requires high read depth, provided by the
next-generation sequencers and could use the existing data. The tests on
errorless reads, generated in silico from several model genomes, pointed the
properly reconstructed repetitive sequences, where existing assemblers fail.
