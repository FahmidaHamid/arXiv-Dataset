  A large number of studies have shown the existence of metabolic covalent
modifications in different molecular structures, able to store biochemical
information that is not encoded by the DNA. Some of these covalent mark
patterns can be transmitted across generations (epigenetic changes). Recently,
the emergence of Hopfield-like attractor dynamics has been observed in the
self-organized enzymatic networks, which have the capacity to store functional
catalytic patterns that can be correctly recovered by the specific input
stimuli. The Hopfield-like metabolic dynamics are stable and can be maintained
as a long-term biochemical memory. In addition, specific molecular information
can be transferred from the functional dynamics of the metabolic networks to
the enzymatic activity involved in the covalent post-translational modulation
so that determined functional memory can be embedded in multiple stable
molecular marks. Both the metabolic dynamics governed by Hopfield-type
attractors (functional processes) and the enzymatic covalent modifications of
determined molecules (structural dynamic processes) seem to represent the two
stages of the dynamical memory of cellular metabolism (metabolic memory).
Epigenetic processes appear to be the structural manifestation of this cellular
metabolic memory. Here, a new framework for molecular information storage in
the cell is presented, which is characterized by two functionally and
molecularly interrelated systems: a dynamic, flexible and adaptive system
(metabolic memory) and an essentially conservative system (genetic memory). The
molecular information of both systems seems to coordinate the physiological
development of the whole cell.
