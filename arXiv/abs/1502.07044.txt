  Protein mobility is conventionally analyzed in terms of an effective
diffusion. Yet, this description often fails to properly distinguish and
evaluate the physical parameters (such as the membrane friction) and the
biochemical interactions governing the motion. Here, we present a method
combining high-density single-molecule imaging and statistical inference to
separately map the diffusion and energy landscapes of membrane proteins across
the cell surface at ~100 nm resolution (with acquisition of a few minutes).
When applying these analytical tools to glycine neurotransmitter receptors
(GlyRs) at inhibitory synapses, we find that gephyrin scaffolds act as shallow
energy traps (~3 kBT) for GlyRs, with a depth modulated by the biochemical
properties of the receptor-gephyrin interaction loop. In turn, the inferred
maps can be used to simulate the dynamics of proteins in the membrane, from the
level of individual receptors to that of the population, and thereby, to model
the stochastic fluctuations of physiological parameters (such as the number of
receptors at synapses). Overall, our approach provides a powerful and
comprehensive framework with which to analyze biochemical interactions in
living cells and to decipher the multi-scale dynamics of biomolecules in
complex cellular environments.
