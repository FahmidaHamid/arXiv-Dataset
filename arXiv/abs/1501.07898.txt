  Polymerization of fibrin, the primary structural protein of blood clots and
thrombi, occurs through binding of knobs 'A' and 'B' in the central nodule of
fibrin monomer to complementary holes 'a' and 'b' in the beta- and
gamma-nodules, respectively, of another monomer. We characterized the A:a and
B:b knob-hole interactions under varying solution conditions using Molecular
Dynamics simulations of the structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D
complexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob 'A' mimetic) and GHRP (knob 'B'
mimetic). The strength of A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes was roughly equal,
decreasing with pulling force; yet, the dissociation kinetics were sensitive to
variations in acidity (pH=5-7) and temperature (T=25-37 C). There were similar
structural changes in holes 'a' and 'b' during forced dissociation of the
knob-hole complexes: elongation of loop I, stretching of interior region, and
translocation of the moveable flap. The disruption of the knob-hole
interactions was not an "all-or-none" transition, as it occurred through
distinct two-step or single-step pathways with or without intermediate states.
The knob-hole bonds were stronger, tighter, and more brittle at pH=7 than at
pH=5. The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser, and more compliant than the
A:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, but stronger, tighter, and less compliant at pH=5.
Surprisingly, the knob-hole bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated
temperature (T=37 C) compared to T=25 C due to the helix-to-coil transition in
loop I, which helps stabilize the bonds. These results provide detailed
qualitative and quantitative characteristics underlying the most significant
non-covalent interactions involved in fibrin polymerization.
