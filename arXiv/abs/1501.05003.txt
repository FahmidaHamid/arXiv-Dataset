  We present an experimentally guided, multi-phasic, multi-species ionic gel
model to compare and make qualitative predictions on the rheology of mucus of
healthy individuals (Wild Type) versus those infected with Cystic Fibrosis. The
mixture theory consists of the mucus (polymer phase) and water (solvent phase)
as well as several different ions: H+, Na+ and Ca++. The model is linearized to
study the hydration of spherically symmetric mucus gels and calibrated against
the experimental data of mucus diffusivities. Near equilibrium, the linearized
form of the equation describing the radial size of the gel, reduces to the
well-known expression used in the kinetic theory of swelling hydrogels.
Numerical studies reveal that the Donnan potential is the dominating mechanism
driving the mucus swelling/deswelling transition. However, the altered swelling
kinetics of the Cystic Fibrosis infected mucus is not merely governed by the
hydroelectric composition of the swelling media, but also due to the altered
movement of electrolytes as well as due to the defective properties of the
mucin polymer network.
