  Recently, a three-state model is presented to describe the intracellular
traffic of unconventional (single-headed) kinesin KIF1A [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
95}, 118101 (2005)], in which each motor can bind strongly or weakly to its
microtubule track, and each binding site of the track might be empty or
occupied by one motor. As the usual two-state model, i.e. the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with motor detachment and
attachment, in steady state of the system, this three-state model also exhibits
shock (or domain wall separating the high-density and low density phases) and
boundary layers. In this study, using mean-field analysis, the conditions of
existence of shock and boundary layers are obtained theoretically. Combined
with numerical calculations, the properties of shock are also studied. This
study will be helpful to understand the biophysical properties of the
collective transport of kinesin KIF1A.
