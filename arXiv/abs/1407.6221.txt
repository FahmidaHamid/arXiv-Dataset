  Prion is a misfolded protein found in mammals that causes infectious diseases
of the nervous system in humans and animals. Prion diseases are invariably
fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases that affect a wide
variety of mammalian species such as sheep and goats, cattle, deer, elk and
humans etc. Recent studies have shown that rabbits have a low susceptibility to
be infected by prion diseases with respect to other animals including humans.
The present study employs molecular dynamics (MD) means to unravel the
mechanism of rabbit prion proteins (RaPrPC) based on the recently available
rabbit NMR structures (of the wild-type and its two mutants of two surface
residues). The electrostatic charge distributions on the protein surface are
the focus when analysing the MD trajectories. It is found that we can conclude
that surface electrostatic charge distributions indeed contribute to the
structural stability of wild-type RaPrPC; this may be useful for the medicinal
treatment of prion diseases.
