  In this paper, we develop further the theory of thermostated systems along
the lines of our earlier paper. Two results are highlighted: 1) in the Markov
limit of the contracted description, a least dissipation of Helmholtz free
energy principle is established; and 2) a detailed account of the
appropriateness of this principle for nano-biology, including the evolution of
life, is presented.
