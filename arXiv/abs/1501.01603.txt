  We study inhomogeneous host-pathogen dynamics to model the global amphibian
population extinction in a lake basin system. The lake basin system is modeled
as quenched disorder. In this model we show that once the pathogen arrives at
the lake basin it spreads from one lake to another, eventually spreading to the
entire lake basin system in a wave like pattern. The extinction time has been
found to depend on the steady state host population and pathogen growth rate.
Linear estimate of the extinction time is computed. The steady state host
population shows a threshold behavior in the interaction strength for a given
growth rate.
