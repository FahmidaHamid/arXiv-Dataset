  Tissue Engineering (TE) is an interdisciplinary field dealing with the
principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of
biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function or a
whole organ. Currently, TE is emerging as an invaluable field of study and is
one of the most promising fields for the next century. The ultimate goal is to
develop powerful new therapies for biological substitutes - that will
successfully restore the structural and functional disorders of human and
animal system.
