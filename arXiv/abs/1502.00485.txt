  Cells generally change their internal state to adapt to an environmental
change, and accordingly evolve in response to the new conditions. This process
involves phenotypic changes that occur over several different time scales,
ranging from faster environmental adaptation without a corresponding change in
the genomic sequence to slower evolutionary dynamics involving genetic
mutations and subsequent selection. In this regard, a question arises as to
whether there are any relationships between such phenotypic changes over the
different time scales at which adaptive evolution occurs. In this study, we
analyzed simulated adaptive evolution in a simple cell model, and found that
proportionality between concentration changes in adaptation and evolution over
all components, and the proportion coefficients were closely linked to the
change in the growth rate of a cell. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
phenotypic variances in component concentrations due to (non-genetic) noise and
genomic alternations are proportional across all components. These global
relationships in cellular states were also supported by phenomenological theory
and transcriptome analysis of laboratory evolution in {\it Escherichia coli}.
These findings provide a basis for the development of a quantitative theory of
plasticity and robustness, and to determine the general restriction of
phenotypic changes imposed by evolution.
