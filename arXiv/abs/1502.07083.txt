  The study of genetic map linearization leads to a combinatorial hard problem,
called the {\em minimum breakpoint linearization} (MBL) problem. It is aimed at
finding a linearization of a partial order which attains the minimum breakpoint
distance to a reference total order. The approximation algorithms previously
developed for the MBL problem are only applicable to genetic maps in which
genes or markers are represented as signed integers. However, current genetic
mapping techniques generally do not specify gene strandedness so that genes can
only be represented as unsigned integers. In this paper, we study the MBL
problem in the latter more realistic case. An approximation algorithm is thus
developed, which achieves a ratio of $(m^2+2m-1)$ and runs in $O(n^7)$ time,
where $m$ is the number of genetic maps used to construct the input partial
order and $n$ the total number of distinct genes in these maps.
