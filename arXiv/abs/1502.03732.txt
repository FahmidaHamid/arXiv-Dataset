  An approach for approximately calculating the number of genes in a genome is
presented, which takes into account the average protein length expected for the
species. A number of virus, bacterial and eukaryotic genomes are scrutinized.
Genome figures are presented, which support the average protein size of a
species as a criterion for assessing life complexity. The human gene
distribution in the 23 chromosomes is investigated emphasizing the genomic
rate, the mean 'exon' length, and the mean 'exons per gene'. It is shown that
storing all genes of a single human definitely requires less than 12 MB.
