  The toxins associated with infectious diseases are potential targets for
inhibitors which have the potential for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Many
antibodies have been generated for this purpose, and the objective of this
study was to develop a simple mathematical model that may be used to evaluate
the potential protective effect of antibodies. This model was used to evaluate
the contributions of antibody affinity and concentration to reducing
antibody-receptor complex formation and internalization. The model also enables
prediction of the antibody kinetic constants and concentration required to
provide a specified degree of protection. We hope that this model, once
validated experimentally, will be a useful tool for in vitro selection of
potentially protective antibodies for progression to in vivo evaluation.
