  RNA polymerase (RNAP) is molecular machine that polymerizes a RNA molecule, a
linear heteropolymer, using a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as the corresponding
template; the sequence of monomers of the RNA is dictated by that of monomers
on the ssDNA template. While polymerizing a RNA, the RNAP walks step-by-step on
the ssDNA template in a specific direction. Thus, a RNAP can be regarded also
as a molecular motor and the sites of start and stop of its walk on the DNA
mark the two ends of the genetic message that it transcribes into RNA.
Interference of transcription of two overlapping genes is believed to regulate
the levels of their expression, i.e., the overall rate of the corresponding RNA
synthesis, through suppressive effect of one on the other. Here we model this
process as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP motors that are characterized
by two distinct pairs of start and stop sites. Each group polymerizes identical
copies of a RNA while the RNAs polymerized by the two groups are different.
These models, which may also be viewed as two interfering totally asymmetric
simple exclusion processes, account for all modes of transcriptional
interference in spite of their extreme simplicity. A combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation of these models demonstrate the physical origin
of the switch-like regulation of the two interfering genes in both
co-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of RNAP motors.
