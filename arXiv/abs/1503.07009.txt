  Subdiffusion has been proposed as an explanation of various kinetic phenomena
inside living cells. In order to fascilitate large-scale computational studies
of subdiffusive chemical processes, we extend a recently suggested mesoscopic
model of subdiffusion into an accurate and consistent reaction-subdiffusion
computational framework. Two different possible models of chemical reaction are
revealed and some basic dynamic properties are derived. In certain cases those
mesoscopic models have a direct interpretation at the macroscopic level as
fractional partial differential equations in a bounded time interval. Through
analysis and numerical experiments we estimate the macroscopic effects of
reactions under subdiffusive mixing. The models display properties observed
also in experiments: for a short time interval the behavior of the diffusion
and the reaction is ordinary, in an intermediate interval the behavior is
anomalous, and at long times the behavior is ordinary again.
