  We present a simple model to study L\'{e}vy-flight foraging in a finite
landscape with countable targets. In our approach, foraging is a step-based
exploratory random search process with a power-law step-size distribution $P(l)
\propto l^{-\mu}$. We find that, when the termination is regulated by a finite
number of steps $N$, the optimum value of $\mu$ that maximises the foraging
efficiency can vary substantially in the interval $\mu \in (1,3)$, depending on
the landscape features (landscape size and number of targets). We further
demonstrate that subjective returning can be another significant factor that
affects the foraging efficiency in such context. Our results suggest that
L\'{e}vy-flight foraging may arise through an interaction between the
environmental context and the termination of exploitation, and particularly
that the number of steps can play an important role in this scenario which is
overlooked by most previous work. Our study not only provides a new perspective
on L\'{e}vy-flight foraging, but also opens new avenues for investigating the
interaction between foraging dynamics and environment as well as offers a
realistic framework for analysing animal movement patterns from empirical data.
