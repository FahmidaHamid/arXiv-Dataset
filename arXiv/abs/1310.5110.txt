  Extrinsic environmental factors influence the distribution and population
dynamics of many organisms, including insects that are of concern for human
health and agriculture. This is particularly true for vector-borne infectious
diseases, like malaria, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality in
humans. Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population
processes for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate
change on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important
measure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number
$R_0$. However, understanding the mechanisms linking $R_0$ and temperature, an
environmental factor driving disease risk, can be challenging because the data
available for parameterization are often poor. To address this we show how a
Bayesian approach can help identify critical uncertainties in components of
$R_0$ and how this uncertainty is propagated into the estimate of $R_0$. Most
notably, we find that different parameters dominate the uncertainty at
different temperature regimes: bite rate from 15-25$^\circ$ C; fecundity across
all temperatures, but especially $\sim$25-32$^\circ$ C; mortality from
20-30$^\circ$ C; parasite development rate at $\sim$15-16$^\circ$C and again at
$\sim$33-35$^\circ$C. Focusing empirical studies on these parameters and
corresponding temperature ranges would be the most efficient way to improve
estimates of $R_0$. While we focus on malaria, our methods apply to improving
process-based models more generally, including epidemiological, physiological
niche, and species distribution models.
