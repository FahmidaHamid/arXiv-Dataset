  To recover the long-time behavior and the statistics of molecular
trajectories from the large number (tens of thousands) of their short
fragments, obtained by super-resolution methods at the single molecule level,
data analysis based on a stochastic model of their non-equilibrium motion is
required. Recently, we characterized the local biophysical properties
underlying receptor motion based on coarse-grained long-range interactions,
corresponding to attracting potential wells of large sizes. The purpose of this
letter is to discuss optimal estimators and show what happens when thing goes
wrong.
