  In this article, we introduce the new approach "fluorescence grid based
aggregation (FGBA)" to justify a dynamical model of protein expression using
experimental fluorescence histograms. In this approach, first, we describe the
dynamics of the gene-protein system by a chemical master equation (CME), while
the protein production rates are unknown. Then, we aggregate the states of the
CME into unknown group sizes. We show that these unknown values can be replaced
by the data from the experimental fluorescence histograms. Consequently, final
probability distributions correspond to the experimental fluorescence
histograms.
