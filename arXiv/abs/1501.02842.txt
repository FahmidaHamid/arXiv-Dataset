  Crosslinked semi-flexible and flexible filaments that are actively deformed
by molecular motors occur in various natural settings, such as the ordered
eukaryotic flagellum, and the disordered cytoskeleton. The deformation of these
composite systems is driven by active motor forces and resisted by passive
filament elasticity, and structural constraints due to permanent cross-links.
Using a mean field theory for a one-dimensional ordered system, we show that
the combination of motor activity and finite filament extensibility yields a
characteristic persistence length scale over which active strain decays. This
decay length is set by the ability of motors to respond to combination of the
weak extensional elasticity, passive shear resistance and the viscoelastic
properties of the motor assembly, and generalizes the notion of persistence in
purely thermal filaments to active systems.
