  The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins is involved in
regulating cellular fate activities such as proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis. Their fundamental importance has attracted considerable attention on
different aspects of the MAPK signaling dynamics; this is particularly true for
the Erk/Mek system, which has become the canonical example for MAPK signaling
systems. Erk exists in many different isoforms, of which the most widely
studied are Erk1 and Erk2. Until recently, these two kinases were considered
equivalent as they differ only subtly at the sequence level; however, these
isoforms exhibit radically different trafficking between cytoplasm and nucleus.
Here we use spatially resolved data on Erk1/2 to develop and analyze
spatio-temporal models of these cascades; and we discuss how sensitivity
analysis can be used to discriminate between mechanisms. We are especially
interested in understanding why two such similar proteins should co-exist in
the same organism, as their functional roles appear to be different. Our models
elucidate some of the factors governing the interplay between processes and the
Erk1/2 localization in different cellular compartments, including competition
between isoforms. This methodology is applicable to a wide range of systems,
such as activation cascades, where translocation of species occurs via signal
pathways. Furthermore, our work may motivate additional emphasis for
considering potentially different roles for isoforms that differ subtly at the
sequence level.
