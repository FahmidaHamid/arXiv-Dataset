  Most sensory cells use cross-membrane chemoreceptors to detect chemical
signals in the environment. The biochemical properties and spatial organization
of chemoreceptors play important roles in achieving and maintaining sensitivity
and accuracy of chemical sensing. Here we investigate the effects of receptor
cooperativity and adaptation on the limits of gradient sensing. We study a
single cell with aggregated chemoreceptor arrays on the cell surface and derive
general formula to the limits for gradient sensing from the uncertainty of
instantaneous receptor activity. In comparison to independent receptors, we
find that cooperativity by non-adaptative receptors could significantly lower
the sensing limit in a chemical concentration range determined by the
biochemical properties of ligand-receptor binding and ligand-induced receptor
activity. Cooperativity by adaptative receptors are beneficial to gradient
sensing within a broad range of background concentrations. Our results also
show that isotropic receptor aggregate layout on the cell surface represents an
optimal configuration to gradient sensing.
