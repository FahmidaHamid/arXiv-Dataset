  To understand dynamic developmental processes, living tissues must be imaged
frequently and for extended periods of time. Root development is extensively
studied at cellular resolution to understand basic mechanisms underlying
pattern formation and maintenance in plants. Unfortunately, ensuring continuous
specimen access, while preserving physiological conditions and preventing
photo-damage, poses major barriers to measurements of cellular dynamics in
indeterminately growing organs such as plant roots. We present a system that
integrates optical sectioning through light sheet fluorescence microscopy with
hydroponic culture that enables us to image at cellular resolution a vertically
growing Arabidopsis root every few minutes and for several consecutive days. We
describe novel automated routines to track the root tip as it grows, track
cellular nuclei and identify cell divisions. We demonstrate the system's
capabilities by collecting data on divisions and nuclear dynamics.
