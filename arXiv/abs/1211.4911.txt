  Species interactions shape predator-prey networks, impacting community
structure and, potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global
climatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant
impact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these
patterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is
particularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we
integrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of
trophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited
mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during
the Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional
contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the
structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe
communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained
than other co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in
{\it Rangifer} abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization
of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared to Europe,
species interactions in Beringian communities before the LGM were highly
compartmentalized, or modular. This modularity was lost during the LGM, and
partially recovered after the glacial retreat, and we suggest that changes in
modularity among predators and prey may have been driven by geographic
insularity.
