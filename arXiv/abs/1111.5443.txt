  We investigate the role of long-lasting quantum coherence in the efficiency
of energy transport at room temperature in Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic
complexes. The excitation energy transfer due to the coupling of the light
harvesting complex to the reaction center ("sink") is analyzed using an
effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that, as the coupling to the
reaction center is varied, maximal efficiency in energy transport is achieved
in the vicinity of the superradiance transition, characterized by a segregation
of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the sink (which
provides a quasi--continuum in the energy spectrum) is the dominant effect in
the energy transfer which takes place even in absence of a thermal bath. This
approach allows one to study the effects of finite temperature and the effects
of any coupling scheme to the reaction center. Moreover, taking into account a
realistic electric dipole interaction, we show that the optimal distance from
the reaction center to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson system occurs at the
superradiance transition, and we show that this is consistent with available
experimental data.
