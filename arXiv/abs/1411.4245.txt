  Cyclic, nonhierarchical interactions among biological species represent a
general mechanism by which ecosystems are able to maintain high levels of
biodiversity. However, species coexistence is often possible only in spatially
extended systems with a limited range of dispersal, whereas in well-mixed
environments models for cyclic competition often lead to a loss of
biodiversity. Here we consider the dispersal of biological species in a fluid
environment, where mixing is achieved by a combination of advection and
diffusion. In particular, we perform a detailed numerical analysis of a model
composed of turbulent advection, diffusive transport, and cyclic interactions
among biological species in two spatial dimensions and discuss the
circumstances under which biodiversity is maintained when external
environmental conditions, such as resource supply, are uniform in space. Cyclic
interactions are represented by a model with three competitors, resembling the
children's game of rock-paper-scissors, whereas the flow field is obtained from
a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence with
hyperviscosity. It is shown that the space-averaged dynamics undergoes
bifurcations as the relative strengths of advection and diffusion compared to
biological interactions are varied.
