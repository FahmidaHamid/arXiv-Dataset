  To maintain bone mass during bone remodelling, coupling is required between
bone resorption and bone formation. This coordination is achieved by a network
of autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast
lineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of
signalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of
experimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper
understanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a
mathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to
include the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This
inclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to
play an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased
rate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of
proliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone
mass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new
model to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt
signalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells
by transforming growth factor \beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the
new model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to
bone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to
release some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone
remodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal
signalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to
either bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model
developed here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the
evolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone
microenvironment
