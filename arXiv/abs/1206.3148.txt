  We study the effect of intracellular ion diffusion on ionic currents
permeating through the cell membrane. Ion flux across the cell membrane is
mediated by special proteins forming specific channels. The structure of
potassium channels have been widely studied in recent years with remarkable
results: very precise measurements of the true current across a single channel
are now available. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the behavior of
the channel is still lacking, though molecular dynamics and kinetic models have
provided partial insights. In this paper we demonstrate, by analyzing the KcsA
current-voltage currents via a suitable lattice model, that intracellular
diffusion plays a crucial role in the permeation phenomenon. The interplay
between the selectivity filter behavior and the ion diffusion in the
intracellular side allows a full explanation of the current-voltage curves.
