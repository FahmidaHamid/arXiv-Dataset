  Multipotent differentiation, where cells adopt one of several cell fates, is
a determinate and orchestrated procedure that often incorporates stochastic
mechanisms in order to diversify cell types. How these stochastic phenomena
interact to govern cell fate are poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate
decision making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of
differentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work,
we focus on the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to
trigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral
inhibition, i.e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling
between neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic
decisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e.g.~as ones found in the
regulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations,
attributed to micro-environmental factors. However, the effect of intrinsic and
extrinsic noise on cell fate determination is an open problem. Our goal is to
elucidate how the induction of extrinsic noise affects cell fate specification
in a lateral inhibition mechanism. Using a stochastic Cellular Automaton with
continuous state space, we show that extrinsic noise results in the emergence
of steady-state furrow patterns of cells in a "frustrated/transient" phenotypic
state.
