  In recent years Bayesian Inference has become an efficient tool to analyse
single molecule trajectories. Recently, high density single molecule tagging,
Langevin Equation modelling and Bayesian Inference [10] have been used to infer
diffusion, force and potential fields at the full cell scale. In this short
comment, we point out pitfalls [1, 2] to avoid in single molecule analysis in
order to get unbiased results and reliable fields at various scales.
