  We introduce the gonosomal algebra. Gonosomal algebra extend the evolution
algebra of the bisexual population (EABP) defined by Ladra and Rozikov. We show
that gonosomal algebras can represent algebraically a wide variety of sex
determination systems observed in bisexual populations. We illustrate this by
about twenty genetic examples, most of these examples cannot be represented by
an EABP. We give seven algebraic constructions of gonosomal algebras, each is
illustrated by genetic examples. We show that unlike the EABP gonosomal
algebras are not dibaric. We approach the existence of dibaric function and
idempotent in gonosomal algebras.
