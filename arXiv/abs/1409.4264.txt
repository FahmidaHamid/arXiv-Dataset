  A microtubule (MT) is a hollow tube of approximately 25 nm diameter. The two
ends of the tube are dissimilar and are designated as `plus' and `minus' ends.
Motivated by the collective push and pull exerted by a bundle of MTs during
chromosome segregation in a living cell, we have developed here a much
simplified theoretical model of a bundle of parallel dynamic MTs. The plus-end
of all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable `wall' by a
device whose detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The
only requirement is that the device allows polymerization and depolymerization
of each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence of external force and
direct lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs
attached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing
MTs and vice-versa; the load against a group is shared equally by the members
of that group. Such indirect interactions among the MTs gives rise to the rich
variety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have identified by
computer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes. The
bi-directional motion of the cargo, caused by the load-dependence of the
polymerization kinetics, is a "proof-of-principle" that the bi-directional
motion of chromosomes before cell division does not necessarily need active
participation of motor proteins.
