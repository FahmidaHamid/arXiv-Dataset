  The RNA world hypothesis, that RNA genomes and catalysts preceded DNA genomes
and genetically-encoded protein catalysts, has been central to models for the
early evolution of life on Earth. A key part of such models is continuity
between the earliest stages in the evolution of life and the RNA repertoires of
extant lineages. Some assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet
direct continuity between modern RNAs and an RNA world has not been
demonstrated for the majority of RNA families, and, anecdotally, many RNA
functions appear restricted in their distribution. Despite much discussion of
the possible antiquity of RNA families, no systematic analyses of RNA family
distribution have been performed. To chart the broad evolutionary history of
known RNA families, we performed comparative genomic analysis of over 3 million
RNA annotations spanning 1446 families from the Rfam 10 database. We report
that 99% of known RNA families are restricted to a single domain of life,
revealing discrete repertoires for each domain. For the 1% of RNA
families/clans present in more than one domain, over half show evidence of
horizontal gene transfer, and the rest show a vertical trace, indicating the
presence of a complex protein synthesis machinery in the Last Universal Common
Ancestor (LUCA) and consistent with the evolutionary history of the most
ancient protein-coding genes. However, with limited interdomain transfer and
few RNA families exhibiting demonstrable antiquity as predicted under RNA world
continuity, our results indicate that the majority of modern cellular RNA
repertoires have primarily evolved in a domain-specific manner.
