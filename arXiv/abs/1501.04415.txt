  Microarray analysis to monitor expression activities in thousands of genes
simultaneously has become routine in biomedical research during the past
decade. A tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in
the public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect
differentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased
statistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed
$p$-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which
Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw
data and $p$-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies
that are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a
certain $p$-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with $p$-value${}<0.001$) are
reported in journal publications. The truncated $p$-value information makes the
aforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to
apply a less efficient vote counting method or na\"{i}vely drop the studies
with incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective
meta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored $p$-values.
We developed and compared three imputation methods - mean imputation, single
random imputation and multiple imputation - for a general class of evidence
aggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special
examples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and
subsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established.
Simulations were performed to investigate the type I error, power and the
control of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data.
The proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal
cancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder
(MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing
na\"{i}ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed
the best and are recommended for future applications.
