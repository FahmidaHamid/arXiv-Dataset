  Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a key pathway for transporting cargo
into cells via membrane vesicles. It plays an integral role in nutrient import,
signal transduction, neurotransmission and cellular entry of pathogens and
drug-carrying nanoparticles. As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the
plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending
and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension
conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this
study, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide
fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,
namely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane
tension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through
instability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination
to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR
proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we
present a new counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the
shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins,
supported by actin-BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing
of vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a new
stress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the
shapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through
transition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the
intriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into
detached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.
