  To facilitate the analysis of large-scale high-throughput capillary
electrophoresis data, we previously proposed a suite of efficient analysis
software named HiTRACE (High Throughput Robust Analysis of Capillary
Electrophoresis). HiTRACE has been used extensively for quantitating data from
RNA and DNA structure mapping experiments, including mutate-and-map contact
inference, chromatin footprinting, the EteRNA RNA design project and other
high-throughput applications. However, HiTRACE is based on a suite of
command-line MATLAB scripts that requires nontrivial efforts to learn, use, and
extend. Here we present HiTRACE-Web, an online version of HiTRACE that includes
standard features previously available in the command-line version as well as
additional features such as automated band annotation and flexible adjustment
of annotations, all via a user-friendly environment. By making use of
parallelization, the on-line workflow is also faster than software
implementations available to most users on their local computers. Free access:
