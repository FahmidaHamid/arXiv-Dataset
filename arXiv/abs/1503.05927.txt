  Gaussian network model (GNM) is one of the most accurate and efficient
methods for biomolecular flexibility analysis. However, the systematic
generalization of the GNM has been elusive. We show that the GNM Kirchhoff
matrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter, which is a special case of
a wide class of correlation functions underpinning the linear scaling
flexibility-rigidity index (FRI) method. Based on the mathematical structure of
correlation functions, we propose a unified framework to construct generalized
Kirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to correlation function based
GNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of the diagonal elements gives rise to FRI
method. We illustrate that correlation function based GNMs outperform the
original GNM in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins. We
demonstrate that for any given correlation function, FRI and GNM methods
provide essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the
correlation function is sufficiently large.
