  Gene regulatory networks arise in all living cells, allowing the control of
gene expression patterns. The study of their topology has revealed that certain
subgraphs of interactions or "motifs" appear at anomalously high frequencies.
We ask here whether this phenomenon may emerge because of the functions carried
out by these networks. Given a framework for describing regulatory interactions
and dynamics, we consider in the space of all regulatory networks those that
have a prescribed function. Monte Carlo sampling is then used to determine how
these functional networks lead to specific motif statistics in the
interactions. In the case where the regulatory networks are constrained to
exhibit multi-stability, we find a high frequency of gene pairs that are
mutually inhibitory and self-activating. In contrast, networks constrained to
have periodic gene expression patterns (mimicking for instance the cell cycle)
have a high frequency of bifan-like motifs involving four genes with at least
one activating and one inhibitory interaction.
