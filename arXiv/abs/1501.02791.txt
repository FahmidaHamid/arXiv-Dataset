  Long, elastic filaments cross-linked and deformed by active molecular motors
occur in various natural settings. The overall macroscopic mechanical response
of such a composite network depends on the coupling between the active and the
passive properties of the underlying constituents and nonlocal interactions
between different parts of the composite. In a simple one dimensional system,
using a mean field model, it has been shown that the combination of motor
activity and finite filament extensibility yields a persistence length scale
over which strain decays. Here we study a similar system, in the complementary
limit of strong noise and moderate extensibility, using Brownian multi-particle
collision dynamics-based numerical simulations that includes the coupling
between motor kinetics and local filament extensibility. While the numerical
model shows deviations from the mean field predictions due to the presence of
strong active noise caused by the variations in individual motor activity,
several qualitative features are still retained. Specifically, for fixed motor
attachment and detachment rates, the decay is length is set by the ratio of the
passive elasticity to the active shear resistance generated by attached motors.
Our study generalizes the notion of persistence in passive thermal systems to
actively driven systems with testable predictions.
