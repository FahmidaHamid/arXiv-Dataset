  We develop a quantum scattering model to describe the exciton transport
through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) complex. It is found that the exciton
transport involved the optimal quantum coherence is more efficient than that
involved classical behavior alone. Furthermore, we also find that the quantum
resonance condition is easier to be fulfilled in multiple pathways than that in
one pathway. We then definitely demonstrate that the optimal distribution of
the pigments, the multitude of energy delivery pathways and the quantum
effects, are combined together to contribute to the perfect energy transport in
the FMO complex.
