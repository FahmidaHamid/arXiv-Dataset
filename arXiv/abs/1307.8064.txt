  Mississippi River nutrient loads and water stratification on the
Louisiana-Texas shelf contribute to an annually recurring, short-lived hypoxic
bottom layer in areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico comprising less than 2% of
the total Gulf of Mexico bottom area. This paper observes that the NOAA and
LUMCON have now published errant predictions of possible record size areas of
temporary bottom water hypoxia ("dead zones") three times since 2005, in 2008,
2011, and 2013 and that the LUMCON predictions of the area of hypoxic bottom
water average 31% higher than the actual measured hypoxic areas from 2006 to
2014. These systematically high predictions depend on the assumption that the
susceptibility of the Gulf of Mexico to forming hypoxic areas in response to
nutrient loading has been relatively constant since 2001, though the
susceptibility has been occasionally adjusted upward in different models. It
has been previously suggested that tropical storms in a given year that occur
on the Louisiana-Texas shelf between the peak nutrient loading in spring and
formation of the hypoxic zone in summer can mitigate the size of the hypoxic
zone that year through mixing of stratified well oxygenated lighter and warmer
surface layers and oxygen depleted heavier and cooler bottom layers. This paper
suggests several reasons why the Louisiana-Texas shelf may be systematically
growing less susceptible to a given level of nutrient loading over time so that
predictions based on the measured area of temporary bottom water hypoxia prior
to 2006 tend to be too big in recent years.
