  Aging changes including age spots and atherosclerotic plaques develop in a
manner of in-homogeneous and accelerated. For understanding this phenomenon,
development of aging changes is analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, which is
introduced in Misrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of
repair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism in situations of
severe injuries; however a Misrepair alters the structure of a tissue, a cell
or a molecule, which are the sub-structures of an organism. II. Alteration of
the structure of a sub-structure by Misrepair also alters the spatial
relationship between local sub-structures, and this change will lead to
increased damage-sensitivity and reduced repair-efficiency of these
sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a tendency to occur to the
sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an old Misrepair has taken
place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again the damage-sensitivity of
these sub-structures and the surrounding sub-structures. The frequency of
Misrepairs to these sub-structures is increased and the range of affected
sub-structures is enlarged after each time of Misrepair in a vicious circle.
Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. III.
Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to formation and growing of a "spot"
or "plaque" in a tissue. Growing of a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots
grow faster than new ones. New spots prefer to develop close to old ones,
resulting in an in-homogenous distribution of spots. In conclusion, the
in-homogeneous development of aging changes is a result of self-accelerating
and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; thus the process of aging is
self-accelerating.
