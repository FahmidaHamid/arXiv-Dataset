  These lecture notes in Lie Groups are designed for a 1--semester third year
or graduate course in mathematics, physics, engineering, chemistry or biology.
This landmark theory of the 20th Century mathematics and physics gives a
rigorous foundation to modern dynamics, as well as field and gauge theories in
physics, engineering and biomechanics. We give both physical and medical
examples of Lie groups. The only necessary background for comprehensive reading
of these notes are advanced calculus and linear algebra.
