  Biofilms are antibiotic-resistant bacterial aggregates that grow on moist
surfaces and can trigger hospital-acquired infections. They provide a classical
example in biology where the dynamics of cellular communities may be observed
and studied. Gene expression regulates cell division and differentiation, which
affect the biofilm architecture. Mechanical and chemical processes shape the
resulting structure. We gain insight into the interplay between cellular and
mechanical processes during biofilm development on air-agar interfaces by means
of a hybrid model. Cellular behavior is governed by stochastic rules informed
by a cascade of concentration fields for nutrients, waste and autoinducers.
Cellular differentiation and death alter the structure and the mechanical
properties of the biofilm, which is deformed according to Foppl-Von Karman
equations informed by cellular processes and the interaction with the
substratum. Stiffness gradients due to growth and swelling produce wrinkle
branching. We are able to reproduce wrinkled structures often formed by
biofilms on air-agar interfaces, as well as spatial distributions of
differentiated cells commonly observed with B. subtilis.
