  The motor part of a crawling eukaryotic cell can be represented schematically
as an active continuum layer. The main active processes in this layer are
protrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers,
contraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active
bonding of trans-membrane proteins to a substrate. All three active mechanisms
are regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical
feedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In
this situation, it is instructive to take a reverse engineering approach and
study a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements
inside a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this
paper we assume that (in the range of interest) the energetic cost of
self-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion,
the maximization of the overall velocity. We then choose a prototypical
setting, formulate the corresponding variational problem and obtain a set of
bounds suggesting that radically different spatial distributions of adhesive
complexes would be optimal depending on the domineering active mechanism of
self-propulsion. Thus, for contraction-dominated motility, adhesion has to
cooperate with 'pullers' which localize at the trailing edge of the cell, while
for protrusion-dominated motility it must conspire with 'pushers' concentrating
at the leading edge of the cell. Both types of crawling mechanisms were
observed experimentally.
