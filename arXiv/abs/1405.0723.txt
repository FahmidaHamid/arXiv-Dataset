  Most published studies on the statistical analysis of count data generated by
next-generation sequencing technologies have paid surprisingly little attention
on cluster analysis. We present a statistical methodology (DGEclust) for
clustering digital expression data, which (contrary to alternative methods)
simultaneously addresses the problem of model selection (i.e. how many clusters
are supported by the data) and uncertainty in parameter estimation. We show how
this methodology can be utilised in differential expression analysis and we
demonstrate its applicability on a more general class of problems and higher
accuracy, when compared to popular alternatives. DGEclust is freely available
