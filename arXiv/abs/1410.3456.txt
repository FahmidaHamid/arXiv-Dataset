  Fundamental properties of macroscopic gene-mating dynamic evolutionary
systems are investigated. A model is proposed to describe a large class of
systems within population genetics. We focus on a single locus, arbitrary
number alleles in a two-gender dioecious population. Our governing equations
are time-dependent continuous differential equations labeled by a set of
genotype frequencies. The full parameter space consists of all allowed genotype
frequencies. Our equations are uniquely derived from four fundamental
assumptions within any population: (1) a closed system; (2) average-and-random
mating process (mean-field behavior); (3) Mendelian inheritance; (4)
exponential growth and exponential death. Even though our equations are
non-linear with time evolutionary dynamics, we have an exactly solvable model.
Our findings are summarized from phenomenological and mathematical viewpoints.
From the phenomenological viewpoint, any initial genotype frequency of a closed
system will eventually approach a stable fixed point. Under time evolution, we
show (1) the monotonic behavior of genotype frequencies, (2) any genotype or
allele that appears in the population will never become extinct, (3) the
Hardy-Weinberg law, and (4) the global stability without chaos in the parameter
space. To demonstrate the experimental evidence, as an example, we show a
mapping from the blood type genotype frequencies of world ethnic groups to our
stable fixed-point solutions. From the mathematical viewpoint, the equilibrium
solutions consist of a base manifold as a global stable attractor, attracting
any initial point in a Euclidean fiber bundle to the fixed point where the
fiber is attached. We can define the genetic distance of two populations as
their geodesic distance on the equilibrium manifold. In addition, the
modification of our theory under the process of natural selection and mutation
is addressed.
