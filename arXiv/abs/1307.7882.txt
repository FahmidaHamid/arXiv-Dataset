  This article is devoted to applications of projection operators to simulate
phenomenological properties of the molecular-genetic code system. Oblique
projection operators are under consideration, which are connected with matrix
representations of the genetic coding system in forms of the Rademacher and
Hadamard matrices. Evidences are shown that sums of such projectors give
abilities for adequate simulations of ensembles of inherited biological
phenomena including ensembles of biological cycles, morphogenetic ensembles of
phyllotaxis patterns, etc. For such modeling, the author proposes
multidimensional vector spaces, whose subspaces are under a selective control
(or coding) by means of a set of matrix operators on base of genetic
projectors. Development of genetic biomechanics is discussed. The author
proposes and describes special systems of multidimensional numbers under names
as tensorcomplex numbers, tensordouble numbers, etc. Described results can be
used for developing algebraic biology, biotechnical applications and some other
fields of science and technology.
