  Maintenance of plasma IgM levels is critical for immune system function and
homeostasis in humans and mice. However, the mechanisms that control
homeostasis of the activated IgM-secreting B cells are unknown. After adoptive
transfer into immune-deficient hosts, B-lymphocytes expand poorly but fully
reconstitute the pool of natural IgM-secreting cells and circulating IgM
levels. By using sequential cell transfers and B cell populations from several
mutant mice, we were able to identify novel mechanisms regulating the size of
the IgM-secreting B cell pool. Contrary to previous mechanisms described
regulating homeostasis, which involve competition for the same niche by cells
having overlapping survival requirements, homeostasis of the innate
IgM-secreting B cell pool is also achieved when B cells populations are able to
monitor the number of activated B cells by detecting their secreted products.
Notably, B cell populations are able to assess the density of activated B cells
by sensing their secreted IgG. This process involves the Fc{\gamma}RIIB, a
low-affinity IgG receptor that is expressed on B cells and acts as a negative
regulator of B cell activation, and its intracellular effector the inositol
phosphatase SHIP. As a result of the engagement of this inhibitory pathway the
number of activated IgM-secreting B cells is kept under control. We hypothesize
that malfunction of this quorum-sensing mechanism may lead to uncontrolled B
cell activation and autoimmunity.
