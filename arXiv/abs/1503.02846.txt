  Modeling social-ecological systems is difficult due to the complexity of
ecosystems and of individual and collective human behavior. Key components of
the social-ecological system are often over-simplified or omitted. Generalized
modeling is a dynamical systems approach that can overcome some of these
challenges. It can analyze qualitative system dynamics such as regime shifts
despite incomplete knowledge of the model's constituent processes, but has been
used primarily in theoretical contexts. Here, we review generalized modeling
and use a recent study on the Baltic cod fishery's boom and collapse to
demonstrate its application to modeling the dynamics of empirical
social-ecological systems. These empirical applications demand new methods of
analysis suited to larger, more complicated generalized models than is common
in theoretical contexts. Generalized modeling is a promising tool, in both
participatory and research settings, for rapidly developing mathematically
rigorous, process-based understanding of a social-ecological system's dynamics
despite limited knowledge of the system.
