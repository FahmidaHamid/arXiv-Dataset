  In the present paper we propose an improvement of the Gillespie algorithm
allowing us to study the time evolution of an ensemble of chemical reactions
occurring in a varying volume, whose growth is directly related to the amount
of some specific molecules, belonging to the reactions set. This allows us to
study the stochastic evolution of a protocell, whose volume increases because
of the production of container molecules. Several protocells models are
considered and compared with the deterministic models.
