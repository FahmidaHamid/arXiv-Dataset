  The standard approach to analyzing 16S tag sequence data, which relies on
clustering reads by sequence similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs), underexploits the accuracy of modern sequencing technology. We present
a clustering-free approach to multi-sample Illumina datasets that can identify
independent bacterial subpopulations regardless of the similarity of their 16S
tag sequences. Using published data from a longitudinal time-series study of
human tongue microbiota, we are able to resolve within standard 97% similarity
OTUs up to 20 distinct subpopulations, all ecologically distinct but with 16S
tags differing by as little as 1 nucleotide (99.2% similarity). A comparative
analysis of oral communities of two cohabiting individuals reveals that most
such subpopulations are shared between the two communities at 100% sequence
identity, and that dynamical similarity between subpopulations in one host is
strongly predictive of dynamical similarity between the same subpopulations in
the other host. Our method can also be applied to samples collected in
cross-sectional studies and can be used with the 454 sequencing platform. We
discuss how the sub-OTU resolution of our approach can provide new insight into
factors shaping community assembly.
