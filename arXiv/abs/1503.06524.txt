  This is a protocol for a systematic review of the effects of music therapy on
offenders. Based on randomised controlled trials, the review aims to assess the
effectiveness of music therapy on adolescent and adult offenders in custodial
institutions including forensic psychiatric hospitals, and offenders or
probationers in the community. The outcomes to be evaluated include alleviated
symptoms of mental illness, psychosocial competencies and reduced recidivism.
