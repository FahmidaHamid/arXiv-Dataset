  In this paper, we introduce the software suite, Hermes, which provides fast,
novel algorithms for RNA secondary structure kinetics. Using the fast Fourier
transform to e?ciently compute the Boltzmann probability that a secondary
structure S of a given RNA sequence has base pair distance x [resp. y] from
reference structure A [resp. B], Hermes computes the exact kinetics of folding
from A to B in this coarse-grained model. In particular, Hermes computes the
mean ?rst passage time from the transition probability matrix by using matrix
inversion, and also computes the equilibrium time from the rate matrix by using
spectral decomposition. Due to the model granularity and the speed of Hermes,
it is capable of determining secondary structure refolding kinetics for large
RNA sequences, beyond the range of other methods. Comparative benchmarking of
Hermes with other methods indicates that Hermes provides refolding kinetics of
accuracy suitable for use in computational design of RNA, an important area of
synthetic biology. Source code and documentation for Hermes are available at
