  We consider a model for plankton ecosystems with resources, self-limitation
effects, and time dependent parameters. The model takes into account the
extinction of multiple species. We show that the model is well posed and
investigate its dynamical properties. The number of species which can coexist
depends on both parameters and forcing. Our numerical simulations show that the
system is more stable under chaotic forcing.
