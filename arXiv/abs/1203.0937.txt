  Next-generation sequencing techniques have facilitated a large scale analysis
of human genetic variation. Despite the advances in sequencing speeds, the
computational discovery of structural variants is not yet standard. It is
likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced
individuals. Here we present a novel internal segment size based approach,
which organizes all, including also concordant reads into a read alignment
graph where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of
alignments. A specifically engineered algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques
and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or
deletions (indels). For the first time in the literature, we compare a large
range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a
fully annotated genome and present various relevant performance statistics. We
achieve superior performance rates in particular on indels of sizes 20--100,
which have been exposed as a current major challenge in the SV discovery
literature and where prior insert size based approaches have limitations. In
that size range, we outperform even split read aligners. We achieve good
results also on real data where we make a substantial amount of correct
predictions as the only tool, which complement the predictions of split-read
aligners. CLEVER is open source (GPL) and available from
