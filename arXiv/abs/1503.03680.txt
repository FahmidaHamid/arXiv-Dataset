  An analysis of breast cancer incidences in women and the relationship between
ethnicity and survival rate has been an ongoing study with recorded incidences
of missing values in the secondary data. In this paper, we study and report the
results of breast cancer survival rate by ethnicity, age and income groups from
the dataset collected for 53593 patients in South East England between the
years 1998 and 2003. In addition to this, we also predict the missing values
for the ethnic groups in the dataset. The principle findings in our study
suggest that: 1) women of white ethnicity in South East England have a highest
percentage of survival rate when compared to the black ethnicity, 2) High
income groups have higher survival rates to that of lower income groups and 3)
Age groups between 80-95 have lower percentage of survival rate.
