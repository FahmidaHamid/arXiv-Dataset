  Most of our understanding of bacterial chemotaxis comes from studies of
Escherichia coli. However, recent evidence suggests significant departures from
the E. coli paradigm in other bacterial species. This variation may stem from
different species inhabiting distinct environments and thus adapting to
specific environmental pressures. In particular, these complex and dynamic
environments may be poorly represented by standard experimental and theoretical
models. In this work, we study the performance of various chemotactic
strategies under a range of stochastic time- and space-varying attractant
distributions in silico. We describe a novel type of response in which the
bacterium tumbles more when attractant concentration is increasing, in contrast
to the response of E. coli, and demonstrate how this response explains the
behavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this "speculator"
response, bacteria compare the current attractant concentration to the
long-term average. By tumbling persistently when the current concentration is
higher than the average, bacteria maintain their position in regions of high
attractant concentration. If the current concentration is lower than the
average, or is declining, bacteria swim away in search of more favorable
conditions. When the attractant distribution is spatially complex but
slowly-changing, this response is as effective as that of E. coli.
