  We use Monte-Carlo simulations to study the effect of variable rigidity on
plectoneme formation and localization in supercoiled dsDNA. We show that the
presence of soft sequences increases the number of plectoneme branches and that
the edges of the branches tend to be localized at these sequences. We propose
an experimental approach to test our results in vitro, and discuss the possible
role played by plectoneme localization in the search process of transcription
factors for their targets (promoter regions) on the bacterial genome.
