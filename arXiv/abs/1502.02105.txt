  Experimental evidences show that in gene transcription, RNA polymerase has
the possibility to be stalled at certain position of the transcription
template. This may be due to the template damage, or protein barriers. Once
stalled, polymerase may backtrack along the template to the previous nucleotide
to wait for the repair of the damaged site, or simply bypass the barrier or
damaged site and consequently synthesize an incorrect messenger RNA, or degrade
and detach from the template. Thus, the {\it effective} transcription rate (the
rate to synthesize correct product mRNA) and the transcription {\it
effectiveness} (the ratio of the {\it effective} transcription rate to the {\it
effective} transcription initiation rate) are both influenced by polymerase
stalling events. This study shows that, Without backtracking, detachment of
stalled polymerase can also help to increase the {\it effective} transcription
rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. Generally, the increase of bypass
rate of the stalled polymerase will lead to the decrease of the {\it effective}
transcription rate and transcription {\it effectiveness}. But when both
detachment rate and backtracking rate of the stalled polymerase vanish, the
{\it effective} transcription rate may also be increased by the bypass
mechanism.
