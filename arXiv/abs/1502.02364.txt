  We present an algorithm to estimate the configurational entropy $S$ of a
polymer. The algorithm uses the statistics of coincidences among random samples
of configurations and is related to the catch-tag-release method for estimation
of population sizes, and to the classic "birthday paradox". Bias in the entropy
estimation is decreased by grouping configurations in nearly equiprobable
partitions based on their energies, and estimating entropies separately within
each partition. Whereas most entropy estimation algorithms require $N\sim
2^{S}$ samples to achieve small bias, our approach typically needs only $N\sim
\sqrt{2^{S}}$. Thus the algorithm can be applied to estimate protein free
energies with increased accuracy and decreased computational cost.
