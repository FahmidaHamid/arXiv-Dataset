  Steady state analysis of dynamical systems for biological networks give rise
to algebraic varieties in high-dimensional spaces whose study is of interest in
their own right. We demonstrate this for the shuttle model of the Wnt signaling
pathway. Here the variety is described by a polynomial system in 19 unknowns
and 36 parameters. Current methods from computational algebraic geometry and
combinatorics are applied to analyze this model.
