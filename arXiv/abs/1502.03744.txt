  Summary: We present a new tool to correct sequencing errors in Illumina data
produced from high-coverage whole-genome shotgun resequencing. It uses a
non-greedy algorithm and shows comparable performance and higher accuracy in an
evaluation on real human data. This evaluation has the most complete collection
of high-performance error correctors so far.
