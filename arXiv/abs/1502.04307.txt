  Although it has long been suggested that accumulation of errors in
transcription and translation is one of the most important molecular mechanisms
leading to ageing, a quantitative link between the error accumulation dynamics
and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. We study stability
properties of a generic gene regulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that
phenomenology of ageing and the associated population mortality rate can be
naturally described in terms of critical dynamics of gene regulation and
metabolic profiles. We analyze age-dependent microarray datasets and metabolic
profiles for \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} and explicitly show that the
resulting GRNs are nearly critical and inherently unstable. This instability
manifests itself as ageing in the form of exponential distortions of gene
expressions and metabolic profiles with age, and causes the characteristic
increase in mortality rate with age as described by the Gompertz law. On top of
that we explain the plateau in mortality rates observed at very late ages for
large populations. We show that ageing contains both a stochastic component,
related to regulatory error accumulation in transcription/translation/metabolic
pathways, and a strong deterministic component, which can be naturally
associated with a part of a development programme. We conclude on this basis
that two opposing hypotheses of ageing, error accumulation and programmed
ageing are in fact compatible with each other. Since mortality in humans, where
it is characterized best, is mostly associated with age related diseases, we
support the idea of ageing being the driving force behind the development of
major diseases.
