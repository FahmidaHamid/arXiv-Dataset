  Allosteric communication in proteins is a central and yet unsolved problem of
structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and
Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate
protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known
PDZ-2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric
pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property
was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through
the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a
normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 {\AA}) that acted as a thermal rectifier. In
contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60
{\AA}), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat
diffusion was due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of
residues that, in turn, was also mediated by hydrogen bonds. This
asymmetrical/symmetrical energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal
communication directionality in proteins and for the control of heat flow in
materials science.
