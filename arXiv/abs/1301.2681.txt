  We demonstrate simultaneous measurements of DNA translocation into glass
nanopores using ionic current detection and fluorescent imaging. We verify the
correspondence between the passage of a single DNA molecule through the
nanopore and the accompanying characteristic ionic current blockage. By
tracking the motion of individual DNA molecules in the nanocapillary
perpendicular to the optical axis and using a model, we can extract an
effective mobility constant for DNA in our geometry under high electric fields.
