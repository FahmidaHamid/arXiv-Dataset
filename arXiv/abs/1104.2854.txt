  Evolutionary biology shares many concepts with statistical physics: both deal
with populations, whether of molecules or organisms, and both seek to simplify
evolution in very many dimensions. Often, methodologies have undergone parallel
and independent development, as with stochastic methods in population genetics.
We discuss aspects of population genetics that have embraced methods from
physics: amongst others, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, travelling
waves, and Monte-Carlo methods have been used to study polygenic evolution,
rates of adaptation, and range expansions. These applications indicate that
evolutionary biology can further benefit from interactions with other areas of
statistical physics, for example, by following the distribution of paths taken
by a population through time.
