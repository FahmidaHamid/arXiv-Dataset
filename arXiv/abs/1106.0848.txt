  An epidemiological model which incorporates synergistic effects that allow
the infectivity and/or susceptibility of hosts to be dependent on the number of
infected neighbours is proposed. Constructive synergy induces an exploitative
behaviour which results in a rapid invasion that infects a large number of
hosts. Interfering synergy leads to a slower and sparser explorative foraging
strategy that traverses larger distances by infecting fewer hosts. The model
can be mapped to a dynamical bond-percolation with spatial correlations that
affect the mechanism of spread but do not influence the critical behaviour of
epidemics.
