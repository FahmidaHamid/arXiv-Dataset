  Measurement in biological systems became a subject of concern as a
consequence of numerous reports on limited reproducibility of experimental
results. To reveal origins of this inconsistency, we have examined general
features of biological systems as dynamical systems far from not only their
chemical equilibrium, but, in most cases, also of their Lyapunov stable states.
Thus, in biological experiments, we do not observe states, but distinct
trajectories followed by the examined organism. If one of the possible
sequences is selected, a minute sub-section of the whole problem is obtained,
sometimes in a seemingly highly reproducible manner. But the state of the
organism is known only if a complete set of possible trajectories is known. And
this is often practically impossible. Therefore, we propose a di?fferent
framework for reporting and analysis of biological experiments, respecting the
view of non-linear mathematics. This view should be used to avoid
overoptimistic results, which have to be consequently retracted or largely
complemented. An increase of speci?cation of experimental procedures is the way
for better understanding of the scope of paths, which the biological system may
be evolving. And it is hidden in the evolution of experimental protocols.
