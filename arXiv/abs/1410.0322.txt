  As a harvested species is depleted, its harvest price often rises due to
falling supply, rarity value, or both. There is concern that high price
flexibility can cause extinction by buffering harvest profits against abundance
declines. However, harvest costs also tend to increase as a population
declines. Here, I derive a simple rule of thumb for determining whether prices
might rise faster than costs as a population is depleted - indicating
susceptibility to severe overharvesting under open-access. Comparing this rule
of thumb to a review of empirical evidence from marine species, I find that
conditions leading costs to be insensitive to abundance declines - particularly
catch rates insensitive to abundance declines, termed 'hyperstable', usually as
a result of range contraction - are much more common than high price
flexibility, even in highly valued species such as bluefin tunas, sturgeons,
whales and abalones. My analysis suggests that factors potentially causing
coincident range contraction as a population declines - including herding or
schooling behavior and habitat destruction - may be important but
underappreciated factors contributing to price-related extinction threats.
