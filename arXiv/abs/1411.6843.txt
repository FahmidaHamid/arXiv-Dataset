  An increasing number of dissident voices claim that the standard
neo-Darwinian view of genes as 'leaders' and phenotypes as 'followers' during
the process of adaptive evolution should be turned on its head. This idea is
older than the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of inheritance and has been given
several names before its final 'Baldwin effect' label. A condition for this
effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic plasticity
or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a population. This
gives the necessary time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and
the adaptive trait can be eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential
paper published in the late 1980s showed the Baldwin effect to happen in
computer simulations, and claimed that it was crucial to solve a difficult
adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various
disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary
emergence of high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language
almost hopeless. Here, we use analytical and computational approaches to show
that a standard population genetics treatment can easily crack what the
scientific community has granted as an unsolvable adaptive problem without
learning. The Baldwin effect is once again in need of convincing theoretical
foundations.
