  In order to replicate within their cellular host, many viruses have developed
self-assembly strategies for their capsids which are sufficiently robust as to
be reconstituted in vitro. Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually
assume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity
over the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,
binding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during
the self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible
advantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,
we use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us
to switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we
implement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become
active only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly
to be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural
reorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with
small dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.
However, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during
the final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a
weak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly
schemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here
for T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous
hexamers in the hierarchical scheme. In order to complement the simulations for
this more complicated case, we introduce a master equation approach that agrees
well with the simulation results.
