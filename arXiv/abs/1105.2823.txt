  The precise mechanism that causes HIV infection to progress to AIDS is still
unknown. This paper presents a mathematical model which is able to predict the
entire trajectory of the HIV/AIDS dynamics, then a possible explanation for
this progression is examined. A dynamical analysis of this model reveals a set
of parameters which may produce two real equilibria in the model. One
equilibrium is stable and represents those individuals who have been living
with HIV for at least 7 to 9 years, and do not develop AIDS. The other one is
unstable and represents those patients who developed AIDS in an average period
of 10 years. However, further work is needed since the proposed model is
sensitive to parameter variations.
