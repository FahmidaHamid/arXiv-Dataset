  Recombination plays a fundamental role in meiosis, ensuring the proper
segregation of chromosomes and contributing to genetic diversity by generating
novel combinations of alleles. Using data derived from directUtoUconsumer
genetic testing, we investigated patterns of recombination in over 4,200
families. Our analysis revealed a number of sex differences in the distribution
of recombination. We find the fraction of male events occurring within hotspots
to be 4.6% higher than for females. We confirm that the recombination rate
increases with maternal age, while hotspot usage decreases, with no such
effects observed in males. Finally, we show that the placement of female
recombination events becomes increasingly deregulated with maternal age, with
an increasing fraction of events appearing to escape crossover interference.
