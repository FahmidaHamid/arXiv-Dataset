  One of the new discoveries in quantum biology is the role of Environment
Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT) in excitonic transport processes. In
disordered quantum systems transport is most efficient when the environment
just destroys quantum interferences responsible for localization, but the
coupling does not drive the system to fully classical thermal diffusion yet.
This poised realm between the pure quantum and the semi-classical domains has
not been considered in other biological transport processes, such as charge
transport through organic molecules. Binding in receptor-ligand complexes is
assumed to be static as electrons are assumed to be not able to cross the
ligand molecule. We show that ENAQT makes cross ligand transport possible and
efficient between certain atoms opening the way for the reorganization of the
charge distribution on the receptor when the ligand molecule docks. This new
effect can potentially change our understanding how receptors work. We
demonstrate room temperature ENAQT on the caffeine molecule.
