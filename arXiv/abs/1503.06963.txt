  RNA molecules in living cells form what look like liquid droplets formed by
liquid/liquid phase separation. But unlike the molecules in conventional phase
separating mixtures, RNA molecules are transported by molecular motors that
consume energy and so are out of equilibrium. Motivated by this we consider
what sort of simple rules for the dynamics of model mRNA molecules lead to
liquid/liquid phase separation. We find that dynamics that slow as the local
density of molecules increases, drive the formation of liquids. We also look at
the analogous separation of the two blocks of a block copolymer, in which the
monomers of one block have dynamics that depend on the local density of
monomers of that block. We find that this block condenses and separates from
the monomers of the other block. This is a simple model of the
out-of-equilibrium domain formation found in the chromatin in the nucleus of
cells.
