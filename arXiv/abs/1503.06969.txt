  Although metazoan development is conceived as resulting from gene regulatory
networks (GRNs) controlled by Hox genes, a better analogy is computer
architecture: i.e., a task accomplished in sequential steps linked to an
external referent that "counts" each step. A developmental "step" equals the
expression of genes in specific cells at specific times and telomeres represent
external "counters" wherein "counting" is a function of telomere shortening at
each cell division that permits the sequential expression of Hox genes and,
ultimately, complex form. Metazoan development thus best resembles a Turing
machine, which could be used to model the development of any metazoan.
