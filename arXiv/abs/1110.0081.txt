  In this article, we follow the trajectory of a photon in the human cornea.
Prior to experimental evidence of the cornea's gradient refractive index (GRIN)
nature, schematic eye models used a constant or average as the corneal
refractive index. A few recent models respect the intra-corneal GRIN, but are
based on the paraxial approximation, and thereby have limited validity in
peripheral visual field analysis and non-paraxial photon tracking. Here, we
introduce the Trajectron algorithm. It uses a closed form solution of the ray
equation of constant axial GRIN media, and evaluates over piece-wise constant
GRIN. Using Trajectron, we present the first quantitative demonstration of
non-paraxial intra-corneal light-bending phenomena. This demonstration has
significant implications in the development of refractive surgery algorithms.
