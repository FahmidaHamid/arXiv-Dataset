  Biodiversity conservation becoming increasingly urgent. It is important to
find mechanisms of competitive coexistence of species with different fitness in
especially difficult circumstances - on one limiting resource, in isolated
stable uniform habitat, without any trade-offs and cooperative interactions.
Here we show a mechanism of competitive coexistence based on a soliton-like
behaviour of population waves. We have modelled it by the logical axiomatic
deterministic individual-based cellular automata method. Our mechanistic models
of population and ecosystem dynamics are of white-box type and so they provide
direct insight into mechanisms under study. The mechanism provides indefinite
coexistence of two, three and four competing species. This mechanism violates
the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle. As a
consequence, we have proposed a fully mechanistic and most stringent
formulation of the principle.
