  The aim of this paper is to give an introductory review of the cryoelectron
microscopy as a complex data source for the most of the system biology
branches, including the most perspective non-local approaches known as
"localomics" and "dynamomics". A brief summary of various cryoelectron
mi-croscopy methods and corresponding system biological ap-proaches is given in
the text. The above classification can be considered as a useful framework for
the primary comprehen-sions about cryoelectron microscopy aims and instrumental
tools. We do not discuss any of these concepts in details, but merely point out
that their methodological complexity follows only from the structure-functional
complexity of biological systems which are investigated in this manner. We also
postu-late that one can employ some of the cryoelectron microscopic techniques
not only for observation, but also for modification and structural
refunctionalization of some biological and similar soft matter objects and
microscopic samples. In other worlds, we start with the cryoelectron microscopy
as a tool for the sys-tem biology and progress to its applying as an instrument
for system biology and functional biomimetics; i.e. "system cryobi-ology" goes
over into "synthetic cryobiology" or "cryogenic biomimetics". All these
conclusions can be deduced from the most recent works of the latest years,
including just submitted foreign papers. This article provides an up-to-date
description of the conceptual basis for the novel view on the computational
cryoelectron microscopy (in silico) approaches and the data mining principles
which lie at the very foundation of modern structural analysis and
reconstruction.
