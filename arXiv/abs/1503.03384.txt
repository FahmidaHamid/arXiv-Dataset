  Aedes aegypti is known as the responsible vector in transmitting dengue
flavivirus. Unavailability of medication to cure the transmission in human
blood becomes a global health issue in recent decades. World epidemiologists
are encouraged to focus on inves- tigation toward an effective and inexpensive
way to prevent dengue transmission, i.e. mosquito control. In this paper, we
present a model depicting the dynamics of mosquito population based on
indoor-outdoor life cycle classification. The basic mosquito offspring number
is obtained and analysis of equilibria is shown. We bring along a discussion on
application of optimal control model which engineers two simultaneous schemes.
The first scheme is done by disseminating chemical like Temephos in spots where
eggs and larvae develop, meanwhile the second scheme is done by conducting
fumigation through areas where adult mosquitoes prevalently nest, indoor as
well as outdoor. A version of gradient-based method is presented to set down a
workflow in minimizing the objective functional with respect to control
variable. Numerical results from analysis of the basic mosquito offspring
number with constant control and from optimal control suggest that one has to
enhance the usage of fumigation rather than Temephos. It is also suggested that
applying both control schemes simultaneously gives the most significant
reduction to the population.
