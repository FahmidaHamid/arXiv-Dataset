  Knots are abundant in globular homopolymers but rare in globular proteins. To
shed new light on this long-standing conundrum, we study the influence of
sequence on the formation of knots in proteins under native conditions within
the framework of the hydrophobic-polar (HP) lattice protein model. By employing
large scale Wang-Landau simulations combined with suitable Monte Carlo trial
moves we show that, even though knots are still abundant on average, sequence
introduces large variability in the degree of self-entanglements. Moreover, we
are able to design sequences which are either almost always or almost never
knotted. Our findings serve as proof of concept that the introduction of just
one additional degree of freedom per monomer (in our case sequence) facilitates
evolution towards a protein universe in which knots are rare.
