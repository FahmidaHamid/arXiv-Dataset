  The emergence of cross species interactions at protein level is a part of
molecular mechanisms that lead to parasitic diseases. Comprehensive modelling
can capture such interactions and could be useful to understand their
pathophysiology and assist in identifying novel drug targets. Using combination
of databases, text minig and predictive methods, we expanded the sparse
information space of protein-protein interactions in three parasitic diseases
namely, malaria, sleeping sickness and cattle east coast fever. These network
models revealed significant similarities in molecular mechanisms underlaying
host's invasion, immuno-modulation and energy metabolism. The models also
suggested new possible pathways in the inter-species protein interaction maps.
Enrichment of these maps with drug-target informations showed a plethora of
drug space to be explored and led to proposal of two new targets for each
malaria and sleeping sickness.
