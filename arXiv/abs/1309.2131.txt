  Phospholipids are essential building blocks of biological membranes. Despite
of vast amount of accurate experimental data the atomistic resolution
structures sampled by the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup in
phoshatidylcholine bilayers are not known. Atomistic resolution molecular
dynamics simulation model would automatically resolve the structures giving an
interpretation of experimental results, if the model would reproduce the
experimental data. In this work we compare the C-H bond vector order parameters
for glycerol backbone and choline headgroup between 14 different atomistic
resolution models and experiments in fully hydrated lipid bilayer. The current
models are not accurately enough to resolve the structure. However, closer
inspection of three best performing models (CHARMM36, GAFFlipid and MacRog)
suggest that improvements in the sampled dihedral angle distributions would
potentilly lead to the model which would resolve the structure. Despite of the
inaccuracy in the fully hydrated structures, the response to the dehydration,
i.e. P-N vector tilting more parallel to membrane normal, is qualitatively
correct in all models. The CHARMM36 and MacRog models describe the interactions
between lipids and cholesterol better than Berger/H\"oltje model. This work has
