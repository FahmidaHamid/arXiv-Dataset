  The Ebola virus is currently one of the most virulent pathogens for humans.
The latest major outbreak occurred in Guinea, Sierra Leonne and Liberia in
2014. With the aim of understanding the spread of infection in the affected
countries, it is crucial to modelize the virus and simulate it. In this paper,
we begin by studying a simple mathematical model that describes the 2014 Ebola
outbreak in Liberia. Then, we use numerical simulations and available data
provided by the World Health Organization to validate the obtained mathematical
model. Moreover, we develop a new mathematical model including vaccination of
individuals. We discuss different cases of vaccination in order to predict the
effect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time. Finally, we apply
optimal control to study the impact of vaccination on the spread of the Ebola
virus. The optimal control problem is solved numerically by using a direct
multi-shooting method.
