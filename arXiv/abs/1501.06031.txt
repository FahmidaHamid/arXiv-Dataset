  One major challenge in neuroscience is the identification of interrelations
between signals reflecting neural activity and how information processing
occurs in the neural circuits. At the cellular and molecular level, mechanisms
of signal transduction have been studied intensively and a better knowledge and
understanding of some basic processes of information handling by neurons has
been achieved. In contrast, little is known about the organization and function
of complex neuronal networks. Experimental methods are now available to
simultaneously monitor electrical activity of a large number of neurons in real
time. Then, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the spiking activity
of individual neurons is a very valuable tool for the study of the dynamics and
architecture of the neural networks. Such activity is not due to the sole
intrinsic properties of the individual neural cells but it is mostly
consequence of the direct influence of other neurons. The deduction of the
effective connectivity between neurons, whose experimental spike trains are
observed, is of crucial importance in neuroscience: first for the correct
interpretation of the electrophysiological activity of the involved neurons and
neural networks, and, for correctly relating the electrophysiological activity
to the functional tasks accomplished by the network. In this work we propose a
novel method for the identification of connectivity of neural networks using
recorded voltages. Our approach is based on the assumptions that the network
has a topology with sparse connection. After a brief description of our method
we will show some numerical results with some data obtained from numerical
simulations.
