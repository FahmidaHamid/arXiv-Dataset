  Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural
selection, but extracting this information for short, widely scattered
noncoding elements remains a challenging problem. Here we introduce a new
computational method for addressing this problem called Inference of Natural
Selection from Interspersed Genomically coHerent elemenTs (INSIGHT). INSIGHT
uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and
divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites,
pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for
variation among loci in mutation rates and genealogical backgrounds. The method
is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and
positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism
and divergence. Information about divergence is obtained from multiple outgroup
genomes using a full phylogenetic model. The model is efficiently fitted to
genome-wide data by decomposing the maximum likelihood estimation procedure
into three straightforward stages. The key selection-related parameters are
estimated by expectation maximization. Using simulations, we show that INSIGHT
can accurately estimate several parameters of interest even in complex
demographic scenarios. We apply our methods to noncoding RNAs, promoter
regions, and transcription factor binding sites in the human genome, and find
clear evidence of natural selection. We also present a detailed analysis of
particular nucleotide positions within GATA2 binding sites and primary
micro-RNA transcripts.
