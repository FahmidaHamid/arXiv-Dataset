  Two sequentially Markov coalescent models (SMC and SMC') are available as
tractable approximations to the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). We present
a Markov process describing coalescence at two fixed points along a pair of
sequences evolving under the SMC'. Using our Markov process, we derive a number
of new quantities related to the pairwise SMC', thereby analytically
quantifying for the first time the similarity between the SMC' and ARG. We use
our process to show that the joint distribution of pairwise coalescence times
at recombination sites under the SMC' is the same as it is marginally under the
ARG, which demonstrates that the SMC' is, in a particular well-defined,
intuitive sense, the most appropriate first-order sequentially Markov
approximation to the ARG. Finally, we use these results to show that population
size estimates under the pairwise SMC are asymptotically biased, while under
the pairwise SMC' they are approximately asymptotically unbiased.
