  Parameter ensembles or sets of random effects constitute one of the
cornerstones of modern statistical practice. This is especially the case in
Bayesian hierarchical models, where several decision theoretic frameworks can
be deployed. The estimation of these parameter ensembles may substantially vary
depending on which inferential goals are prioritised by the modeller. Since one
may wish to satisfy a range of desiderata, it is therefore of interest to
investigate whether some sets of point estimates can simultaneously meet
several inferential objectives. In this thesis, we will be especially concerned
with identifying ensembles of point estimates that produce good approximations
of (i) the true empirical quantiles and empirical quartile ratio (QR) and (ii)
provide an accurate classification of the ensemble's elements above and below a
given threshold. For this purpose, we review various decision-theoretic
frameworks, which have been proposed in the literature in relation to the
optimisation of different aspects of the empirical distribution of a parameter
ensemble. This includes the constrained Bayes (CB), weighted-rank squared error
loss (WRSEL), and triple-goal (GR) ensembles of point estimates. In addition,
we also consider the set of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and the
ensemble of posterior means --the latter being optimal under the summed squared
error loss (SSEL). Firstly, we test the performance of these different sets of
point estimates as plug-in estimators for the empirical quantiles and empirical
QR under a range of synthetic scenarios encompassing both spatial and
non-spatial simulated data sets. Performance evaluation is here conducted using
the posterior regret. Secondly, two threshold classification losses (TCLs)
--weighted and unweighted-- are formulated and formally optimised. The
performance of these decision-theoretic tools is also evaluated on real data
sets.
