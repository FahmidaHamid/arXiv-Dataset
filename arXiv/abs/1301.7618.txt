  Molecular biology knowledge can be systematically represented in a
computer-readable form as a comprehensive map of molecular interactions. There
exist a number of maps of molecular interactions containing detailed
description of various cell mechanisms. It is difficult to explore these large
maps, to comment their content and to maintain them. Though there exist several
tools addressing these problems individually, the scientific community still
lacks an environment that combines these three capabilities together. NaviCell
is a web-based environment for exploiting large maps of molecular interactions,
created in CellDesigner, allowing their easy exploration, curation and
maintenance. NaviCell combines three features: (1) efficient map browsing based
on Google Maps engine; (2) semantic zooming for viewing different levels of
details or of abstraction of the map and (3) integrated web-based blog for
collecting the community feedback. NaviCell can be easily used by experts in
the field of molecular biology for studying molecular entities of their
interest in the context of signaling pathways and cross-talks between pathways
within a global signaling network. NaviCell allows both exploration of detailed
molecular mechanisms represented on the map and a more abstract view of the map
up to a top-level modular representation. NaviCell facilitates curation,
maintenance and updating the comprehensive maps of molecular interactions in an
interactive fashion due to an imbedded blogging system. NaviCell provides an
easy way to explore large-scale maps of molecular interactions, thanks to the
Google Maps and WordPress interfaces, already familiar to many users. Semantic
zooming used for navigating geographical maps is adopted for molecular maps in
NaviCell, making any level of visualization meaningful to the user. In
addition, NaviCell provides a framework for community-based map curation.
