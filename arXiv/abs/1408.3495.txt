  Background: Influenza A/H3N2 has been circulating in humans since 1968,
causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Although H3N2 incidence is highly
seasonal, how such seasonality contributes to global phylogeographic migration
dynamics has not yet been established.
  Results: Incorporating seasonally varying migration rates improves the
modeling of migration. In our global model, windows of increased immigration
map to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased
emigration map to epidemic decline. Seasonal patterns also correlate with the
probability that local lineages go extinct and fail to contribute to long term
viral evolution, as measured through the trunk of the phylogeny. However, the
fraction of the trunk in each community was found to be better determined by
its overall human population size
  Conclusions: Seasonal migration and rapid turnover within regions is
sustained by the invasion of 'fertile epidemic grounds' at the end of older
epidemics. Thus, the current emphasis on connectivity, including air-travel,
should be complemented with a better understanding of the conditions and timing
required for successful establishment.Models which account for migration
seasonality will improve our understanding of the seasonal drivers of
influenza,enhance epidemiological predictions, and ameliorate vaccine updating
by identifying strains that not only escape immunity but also have the seasonal
opportunity to establish and spread. Further work is also needed on additional
conditions that contribute to the persistence and long term evolution of
influenza within the human population,such as spatial heterogeneity with
respect to climate and seasonality
