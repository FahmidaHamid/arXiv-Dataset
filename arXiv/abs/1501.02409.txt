  The antifungal effects of orthorhombic (~10 nm; spherical) and monoclinic
(~50 nm; tetrapod) sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) were studied against the
NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (GR) mediated xenobiotic detoxification
system (GSH-GSSG) in filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger as a model organism).
Both the SNPs induced significant reduction in fungal growth and spore
formation, and also introduced marked deformities on the surface of
conidiophores at their sub-inhibitory concentrations. A genome wide
transcriptome profile then revealed manifold reduction in the expression of
GSH-GSSG transcripts among SNPs treated fungal isolates, which is unusual for
the micron sized elemental sulfur but probably effective in terms of antifungal
efficacy.
