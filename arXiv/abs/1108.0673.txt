  In this work we address the question of how oscillations are arrested in the
mouse somitogenesis clock when the determination front reaches presomitic
cells. Based upon available experimental evidence we hypothesize that the
mechanism underlying such a phenomenon involves the interaction between a limit
cycle (originated by a delayed negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch
(originated by a positive feedback loop). With this hypothesis in mind we
construct the simplest possible model comprising both negative and positive
feedback loops and show that (with a suitable choice of paremeters): 1) it can
show an oscillatory behavior, 2) oscillations are arrested via an
infinite-period bifurcation whenever the different gene-expression
regulator-inputs act together in an additive rather than in a multiplicative
fashion, and 3) this mechanism for oscillation arrest is compatible whit
plentiful experimental observations.
