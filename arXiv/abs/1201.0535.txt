  One of the more interesting themes of the mathematical ecology is the
description of the mutualistic interaction between two interacting species.
Based on continuous-time model developed by Holland and DeAngelis 2009 for
consumer-resource mutualism description, this work deals with the application
of the Mickens Non Standard Finite Difference method to transform the
continuous-time scheme into a discrete-time one. It has been proved that the
Mickens scheme is dynamically consistent with the original one regardless of
the step-sizes used in numerical simulations, in opposition of the forward
Euler method that shows numerical instabilities when the step size overcomes a
critical value.
