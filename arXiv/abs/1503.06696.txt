  Recent studies reported complex post-transcriptional interplay among targets
of a common pool of microRNAs, a class of small non-coding downregulators of
gene expression. Behaving as microRNA-sponges, distinct RNA species may compete
for binding to microRNAs and coregulate each other in a dose-dependent manner.
Although previous studies in cell populations showed competition in vitro, the
detailed dynamical aspects of this process, most importantly in physiological
conditions, remains unclear. We address this point by monitoring protein
expression of two targets of a common miRNA with quantitative single-cell
measurements. In agreement with a detailed stochastic model of molecular
titration, we observed that: (i) crosstalk between targets is possible only in
particular stoichiometric conditions, (ii) a trade-off on the number of
microRNA regulatory elements may induce the coexistence of two distinct cell
populations, (iii) strong inter-targets correlations can be observed. This
phenomenology is compatible with a small amount of mRNA target molecules per
cell of the order of 10-100.
