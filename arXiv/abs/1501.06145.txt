  Marine protected areas (MPAs) have attracted much attention as a tool for
sustainable fisheries management, restoring depleted fisheries stocks and
maintaining ecosystems. However, even with total exclusion of fishing effort,
depleted stocks sometimes show little or no recovery over a long time period.
Here, using a mathematical model, we show that multiple stable states may hold
the key to understanding the tendency for fisheries stocks to recover because
of MPAs. We find that MPAs can have either a positive effect or almost no
effect on the recovery of depleted fishing stocks, depending on the fish
migration patterns and the fishing policies. MPAs also reinforce ecological
resilience, particularly for migratory species. In contrast to previous
reports, our results show that MPAs have small or sometimes negative effects on
the recovery of sedentary species. Unsuitable MPA planning might result in low
effectiveness or even deterioration of the existing condition.
