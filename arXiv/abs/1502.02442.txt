  The Filament Based Lamellipodium Model (FBLM) is a two-phase two-dimensional
continuum model, describing the dynamcis of two interacting families of locally
parallel actin filaments (C.Schmeiser and D.Oelz, How do cells move?
Mathematical modeling of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. Cell
mechanics: from single scale-based models to multiscale modeling. Chapman and
Hall, 2010). It contains accounts of the filaments' bending stiffness, of
adhesion to the substrate, and of cross-links connecting the two families.
  An extension of the model is presented with contributions from nucleation of
filaments by branching, from capping, from contraction by actin-myosin
interaction, and from a pressure-like repulsion between parallel filaments due
to Coulomb interaction. The effect of a chemoattractant is described by a
simple signal transduction model influencing the polymerization speed.
Simulations with the extended model show its potential for describing various
moving cell shapes, depending on the signal transduction procedure, and for
predicting transients between nonmoving and moving states as well as changes of
direction.
