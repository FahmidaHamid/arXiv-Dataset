  Mapping of the forces on biomolecules in cell membranes has spurred the
development of effective labels, e.g. organic fluorophores and nanoparticles,
to track trajectories of single biomolecules. Standard methods use particular
statistics, namely the mean square displacement, to analyze the underlying
dynamics. Here, we introduce general inference methods to fully exploit
information in the experimental trajectories, providing sharp estimates of the
forces and the diffusion coefficients in membrane microdomains. Rapid and
reliable convergence of the inference scheme is demonstrated on trajectories
generated numerically. The method is then applied to infer forces and
potentials acting on the receptor of the $\epsilon$-toxin labeled by
lanthanide-ion nanoparticles. Our scheme is applicable to any labeled
biomolecule and results show show its general relevance for membrane
compartmentation.
