  Physical properties of capsids of plant and animal viruses are important
factors in capsid self-assembly, survival of viruses in the extracellular
environment, and their cell infectivity. Virus shells can have applications as
nanocontainers and delivery vehicles in biotechnology and medicine. Combined
AFM experiments and computational modeling on sub-second timescales of the
indentation nanomechanics of Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) capsid show
that the capsid's physical properties are dynamic and local characteristics of
the structure, which depend on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input.
Surprisingly, under large deformations the CCMV capsid transitions to the
collapsed state without substantial local structural alterations. The enthalpy
change in this deformation state dH = 11.5 - 12.8 MJ/mol is mostly due to
large-amplitude out-of-plane excitations, which contribute to the capsid
bending, and the entropy change TdS = 5.1 - 5.8 MJ/mol is mostly due to
coherent in-plane rearrangements of protein chains, which result in the capsid
stiffening. Dynamic coupling of these modes defines the extent of elasticity
and reversibility of capsid mechanical deformation. This emerging picture
illuminates how unique physico-chemical properties of protein nanoshells help
define their structure and morphology, and determine their viruses' biological
function.
