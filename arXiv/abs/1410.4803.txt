  PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the
steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies
has exposed a strong need for even faster and more scalable implementations of
key functions. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently
contain probabilistic calls, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants,
none of which can be represented by PLINK 1's primary data format.
  To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for
PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces
extensive use of bit-level parallelism, O(sqrt(n))-time/constant-space
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher's exact tests, and many other algorithmic
improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4
orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit
in RAM. This will be followed by PLINK 2.0, which will introduce (a) a new data
format capable of efficiently representing probabilities, phase, and
multiallelic variants, and (b) extensions of many functions to account for the
new types of information.
  The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in
performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to
high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the
feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.
