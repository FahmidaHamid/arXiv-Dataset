  In this paper I explore the human organ procurement system. Which is better
for saving lives and limiting black market use, the present altruistic system
of donations or a free and open sales market? I explain that there is a risk
with maintaining the present system, the altruistic vision, and that people may
die who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is
no guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current
supply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to
discussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to
increase organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and
explicit consent. Ultimately, I conclude that the altruistic donation system,
bolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate
financial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of
its shortcomings.
