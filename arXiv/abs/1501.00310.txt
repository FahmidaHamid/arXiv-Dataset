  Geometry of the metabolic trajectories is characteristic of the biological
response (Keun, Ebbels et al. 2004). Yet, due to unavoidable inter-individual
variations, the exact trajectories characterising the biological responses
differ. We examined whether the differences seen between metabolic trajectories
of a specific treatment, correspond to the variations seen in the other
biological manifestations of the same treatment. Differences in trajectories
were measured via alignment procedures which introduced and implemented in this
study. Our study revealed strong correlation between the scales of the aligned
trajectories of metabolic responses and the severity of the hepatocelluar
lesions induced after administration of hydrazine. Thus the results confirm
that aligned trajectories are characteristic of a specific treatment. They then
can be used for comparison with other treatment specific or unknown metabolic
trajectories and can have many metabonomic applications such as preclinical
toxicological screening
