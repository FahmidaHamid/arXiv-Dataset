  The main goal of Multiland is to generate neutral landscapes made of several
types of regions, with an exact control of the proportions occupied by each
type of region. An important feature of the software is that it allows a
control of the landscape fragmentation. It is intended to theoretical studies
on the effect of landscape structure in applied sciences. It has been developed
in the framework of the PEERLESS ANR project "Predictive Ecological Engineering
for Landscape Ecosystem Services and Sustainability".
