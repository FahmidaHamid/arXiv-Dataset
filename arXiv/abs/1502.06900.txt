  We describe the current state and future plans for a set of tools for
scientific data management (SDM) designed to support scientific transparency
and reproducible research. SDM has been in active use at our MRI Center for
more than two years. We designed the system to be used from the beginning of a
research project, which contrasts with conventional end-state databases that
accept data as a project concludes. A number of benefits accrue from using
scientific data management tools early and throughout the project, including
data integrity as well as reuse of the data and of computational methods.
