  Apoptotic death pathways are frequently activated by death ligand induction
and subsequent activation of the membrane proximal signaling module. Death
receptors cluster upon binding to death ligands, leading to formation of a
membrane proximal death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC). In this membrane
proximal signalosome, initiator caspases (caspase 8) are processed resulting in
activation of both type 1 and type 2 pathways of apoptosis signaling. How the
type 1/type 2 choice is made is an important question in the systems biology of
apoptosis signaling. In this study, we utilize a Monte Carlo based in silico
approach to elucidate the role of membrane proximal signaling module in the
type 1/type 2 choice of apoptosis signaling. Our results provide crucial
mechanistic insights into the formation of DISC signalosome and caspase 8
activation. Increased concentration of death ligands was shown to correlate
with increased type 1 activation. We also study the caspase 6 mediated system
level feedback activation of apoptosis signaling and its role in the type
1/type 2 choice. Our results clarify the basis of cell-to-cell stochastic
variability in apoptosis activation and ramifications of this issue is further
discussed in the context of therapies for cancer and neurodegenerative
disorders.
