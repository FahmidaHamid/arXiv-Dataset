  Several papers published since 2006 describe effects of magnetic fields on
elasmobranchs and assess their utility in reducing negative interactions
between sharks and humans, including bycatch reduction. Most of these repeat a
single untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs
detect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of
magnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have
magnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field
detection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly
narrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that
magnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates
the impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.
However, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several
teleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present
in many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect
magnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as
demonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer
from inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic
detection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies
depends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in
target teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be
independently tested with adequate sample sizes.
