  Here we propose the approach to design of the new type of hybrids of
oligonucleotides with fluorescein-functionalized single-walled carbon
nanotubes. The approach is based on stacking interactions of functionalized
nanotubes with pyrene residues in conjugates of oligonucleotides. The amino-
and fluorescein-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes were obtained, and
their physico-chemical properties were investigated. The effect of carbon
nanotubes functionalization type on the efficacy of sorption of pyrene
conjugates of oligonucleotides was examined. Proposed non-covalent hybrids of
fluorescein-labeled carbon nanotubes with oligonucleotides may be used for
intracellular transport of functional nucleic acids.
