  The study of games and their equilibria is central to developing insights for
understanding many socio-economic phenomena. Here we present a dynamical
systems view of the equilibria of two-person, payoff-symmetric games. In
particular, using this perspective, we discuss the differences between two
solution concepts for such games - namely, those of Nash equilibrium and
co-action equilibrium. For the Nash equilibrium, we show that the dynamical
view can provide an equilibrium refinement, selecting one equilibrium among
several possibilities, thereby solving the issue of multiple equilibria that
appear in some games. We illustrate in detail this dynamical perspective by
considering three well known 2-person games namely the Prisoner's Dilemma, game
of Chicken and the Stag-Hunt. We find that in all of these cases, co-action
equilibria tends to correspond to `nicer' strategies than those corresponding
to Nash equilibria.
