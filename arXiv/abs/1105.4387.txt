  Living organisms produce metabolites of many types via their metabolisms.
Especially, flavonoids, a kind of secondary metabolites, of plant species are
interesting examples. Since plant species are believed to have specific
flavonoids with respect to diverse environment, elucidation of design
principles of metabolite distributions across plant species is important to
understand metabolite diversity and plant evolution. In the previous work, we
found heterogeneous connectivity in metabolite distributions, and proposed a
simple model to explain a possible origin of heterogeneous connectivity. In
this paper, we show further structural properties in the metabolite
distribution among families inspired by analogy with plant-animal mutualistic
networks: nested structure and modular structure. An earlier model represents
that these structural properties in bipartite relationships are determined
based on traits of elements and external factors. However, we find that the
architecture of metabolite distributions is described by simple evolution
processes without trait-based mechanisms by comparison between our model and
the earlier model. Our model can better predict nested structure and modular
structure in addition to heterogeneous connectivity both qualitatively and
quantitatively. This finding implies an alternative possible origin of these
structural properties, and suggests simpler formation mechanisms of metabolite
distributions across plant species than expected.
