  Although, several factors have been attributed to thermostability, the
stabilization strategies used by proteins are still enigmatic. Studies on
recombinant xylanase which has the ubiquitous (\b{eta}/{\alpha})8 TIM
(Triosephosphate isomerase) barrel fold showed that, just a single extreme
N-terminus mutation (V1L) markedly enhanced the thermostability by 5 {\deg}C
without loss of catalytic activity whereas another mutation, V1A at the same
position decreased the stability by 2 {\deg}C. Based on computational analysis
of their crystal structures including residue interaction network, we
established a link between N- to C-terminal contacts and protein stability. We
demonstrate that augmenting of N- to C-terminal non-covalent interactions is
associated with the enhancement of protein stability. We propose that the
strategy of mutations at the termini could be exploited with a view to modulate
stability without compromising on enzymatic activity, or in general, protein
function, in diverse folds where N- and C-termini are in close proximity.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the development of
therapeutics involving proteins and for designing effective protein engineering
strategies.
