  Equipment sharing among people who inject drugs (PWID) is a key risk factor
in infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV). Both the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing HCV transmission in this
population (such as opioid substitution therapy, needle exchange programs or
improved treatment) are difficult to evaluate using field surveys. Ethical
issues and complicated access to the PWID population make it difficult to
gather epidemiological data. In this context, mathematical modelling of HCV
transmission is a useful alternative for comparing the cost and effectiveness
of various interventions. Several models have been developed in the past few
years. They are often based on strong hypotheses concerning the population
structure. This review presents compartmental and individual-based models in
order to underline their strengths and limits in the context of HCV infection
among PWID. The final section discusses the main results of the papers.
