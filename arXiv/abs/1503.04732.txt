  We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is
responsible for periodic sometogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is
one of the main regulators of various cellular functions, and switching of
various oscillating states by investigating p53-Wnt model. The variation in
Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to
different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even
to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin concentration in Wnt could able
to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled
ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state
approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and Gsk3 interaction
rate, due to hypothetical catalytic reaction or external stimuli, can able to
regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control their
dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).
