  Many real world systems are at risk of undergoing critical transitions,
leading to sudden qualitative and sometimes irreversible regime shifts. The
development of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge. Recent
progress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is
described by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key
variables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.
Here we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we
frequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism
leading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been
missed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type
mechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a
saddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over
substantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type
transition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological
data. This work thus establishes a connection from critical transitions to
networks and an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition. In
complex models and big data we anticipate that saddle-transitions will be
encountered frequently in the future.
