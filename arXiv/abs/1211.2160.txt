  Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental and ubiquitous technique
in bioinformatics used to infer related residues among biological sequences.
Thus alignment accuracy is crucial to a vast range of analyses, often in ways
difficult to assess in those analyses. To compare the performance of different
aligners and help detect systematic errors in alignments, a number of
benchmarking strategies have been pursued. Here we present an overview of the
main strategies--based on simulation, consistency, protein structure, and
phylogeny--and discuss their different advantages and associated risks. We
outline a set of desirable characteristics for effective benchmarking, and
evaluate each strategy in light of them. We conclude that there is currently no
universally applicable means of benchmarking MSA, and that developers and users
of alignment tools should base their choice of benchmark depending on the
context of application--with a keen awareness of the assumptions underlying
each benchmarking strategy.
