  In recent years single molecule force spectroscopy has opened a new avenue to
provide profiles of the complex energy landscape of biomolecules. In this
field, quantitative analyses of the data employing sound theoretical models,
have played a major role in interpreting data and anticipating outcomes of
experiments. Here, we explain how by using temperature as a variable in
mechanical unfolding of biomolecules in force spectroscopy, the roughness of
the energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about the
underlying reaction coordinate. Estimates of other aspects of the energy
landscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations
could depend on the precise model used to analyze the experimental data. We
illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location
from loading rate or force-dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition
state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied, which is reminiscent of
the Hammond effect, it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data.
The independence of the TS location on force holds good only for brittle or
hard biomolecules whereas the TS location changes considerably if the molecule
is soft or plastic. Finally, we discuss the goodness of the end-to-end distance
(or pulling) coordinate of the molecule as a surrogate reaction coordinate in a
situation like force-induced ligand-unbinding from a gated molecular receptor
as well as force-quench refolding of an RNA hairpin.
