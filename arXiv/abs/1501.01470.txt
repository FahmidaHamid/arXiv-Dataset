  The active site of superoxide reductase SOR consists of an Fe2+ center in an
unusual [His4 Cys1] square-pyramidal geometry. It specifically reduces
superoxide to produce H2O2. Here, we have reacted the SOR from Desulfoarculus
baarsii directly with H2O2. We have found that its active site can transiently
stabilize an Fe3+-peroxo species that we have spectroscopically characterized
by resonance Raman. The mutation of the strictly conserved Glu47 into alanine
results in a stabilization of this Fe3+-peroxo species, when compared to the
wild-type form. These data support the hypothesis that the reaction of SOR
proceeds through such a Fe3+-peroxo intermediate. This also suggests that Glu47
might serve to help H2O2 release during the reaction with superoxide.
