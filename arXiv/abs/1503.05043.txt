  Mounting evidence indicates that our planet might experience runaway effects
associated to rising temperatures and ecosystem overexploitation, leading to
catastrophic shifts on short time scales. Remediation scenarios capable of
counterbalancing these effects involve geoengineering, sustainable practices
and carbon sequestration, among others. None of these scenarios seems powerful
enough to achieve the desired restoration of safe boundaries. We hypothesise
that synthetic organisms with the appropriate engineering design could be used
to safely prevent declines in some stressed ecosystems and help improving
carbon sequestration. Such schemes would include engineering mutualistic
dependencies preventing undesired evolutionary processes. We hypothesise that
some particular design principles introduce unescapable constraints to the
engineered organisms that act as effective firewalls. Testing this designed
organisms can be achieved by using controlled bioreactor models and accurate
computational models including different scales (from genetic constructs and
metabolic pathways to population dynamics). Our hypothesis heads towards a
future anthropogenic action that should effectively act as Terraforming agents.
It also implies a major challenge in the existing biosafety policies, since we
suggest release of modified organisms as potentially necessary strategy for
success.
