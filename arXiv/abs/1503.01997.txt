  Bistability is considered wide-spread among bacteria and eukaryotic cells,
useful e.g. for enzyme induction, bet hedging, and epigenetic switching.
However, this phenomenon has mostly been described with deterministic dynamic
or well-mixed stochastic models. Here, we map known biological bistable systems
onto the well-characterized biochemical Schloegl model, using analytical
calculations and stochastic spatio-temporal simulations. In addition to network
architecture and strong thermodynamic driving away from equilibrium, we show
that bistability requires fine-tuning towards small cell volumes (or
compartments) and fast protein diffusion (well mixing). Bistability is thus
fragile and hence may be restricted to small bacteria and eukaryotic nuclei,
with switching triggered by volume changes during the cell cycle. For large
volumes, single cells generally loose their ability for bistable switching and
instead undergo a first-order phase transition.
