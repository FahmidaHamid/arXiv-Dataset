  In this paper we provide the derivation of a super compact pairwise model
with only 4 equations in the context of describing
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic dynamics on heterogenous
networks. The super compact model is based on a new closure relation that
involves not only the average degree but also the second and third moments of
the degree distribution. Its derivation uses an a priori approximation of the
degree distribution of susceptible nodes in terms of the degree distribution of
the network. The new closure gives excellent agreement with heterogeneous
pairwise models that contain significantly more differential equations.
