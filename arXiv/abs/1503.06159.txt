  Glioma is the most common form of primary brain tumor. Demographically, the
risk of occurrence increases until old age. Here we present a novel
computational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the
lifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are framed
in a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To
decrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate
recent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since
evidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of
glioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem
cell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our
model. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual
demographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts
for the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,
without the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the
population. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by
randomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.
Based on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)
decrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate
during aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests
that different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to
tumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are
sufficient for the formation of glioma.
