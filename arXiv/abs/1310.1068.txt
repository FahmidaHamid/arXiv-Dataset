  The increased availability of time series genetic variation data from
experimental evolution studies and ancient DNA samples has created new
opportunities to identify genomic regions under selective pressure and to
estimate their associated fitness parameters. However, it is a challenging
problem to compute the likelihood of nonneutral models for the population
allele frequency dynamics, given the observed temporal DNA data. Here, we
develop a novel spectral algorithm to analytically and efficiently integrate
over all possible frequency trajectories between consecutive time points. This
advance circumvents the limitations of existing methods which require
fine-tuning the discretization of the population allele frequency space when
numerically approximating requisite integrals. Furthermore, our method is
flexible enough to handle general diploid models of selection where the
heterozygote and homozygote fitness parameters can take any values, while
previous methods focused on only a few restricted models of selection. We
demonstrate the utility of our method on simulated data and also apply it to
analyze ancient DNA data from genetic loci associated with coat coloration in
horses. In contrast to previous studies, our exploration of the full fitness
parameter space reveals that a heterozygote advantage form of balancing
selection may have been acting on these loci.
