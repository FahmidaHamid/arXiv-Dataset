  We provide, on an extensive dataset and using several different distances,
confirmation of the hypothesis that CGR patterns are preserved along a genomic
DNA sequence, and are different for DNA sequences originating from genomes of
different species. This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs of
genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. In particular, we
compare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic
sequences originating from the genomes of six organisms, each belonging to one
of the kingdoms of life: H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana, P. falciparum,
E. coli, and P. furiosus. We also provide preliminary evidence of this method's
applicability to closely related species by comparing H. sapiens (chromosome
21) sequences and over one hundred and fifty genomic sequences, also 150,000 bp
long, from P. troglodytes (Animalia; chromosome Y), for a total length of more
than 101 million basepairs analyzed. We compute pairwise distances between CGRs
of these genomic sequences using six different distances, and construct
Molecular Distance Maps that visualize all sequences as points in a
two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, to simultaneously display their
interrelationships. Our analysis confirms that CGR patterns of DNA sequences
from the same genome are in general quantitatively similar, while being
different for DNA sequences from genomes of different species. Our analysis of
the performance of the assessed distances uses three different quality measures
and suggests that several distances outperform the Euclidean distance, which
has so far been almost exclusively used for such studies. In particular we show
that, for this dataset, DSSIM (Structural Dissimilarity Index) and the
descriptor distance (introduced here) are best able to classify genomic
sequences.
