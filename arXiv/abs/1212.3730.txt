  Many biological characteristics of evolutionary interest are not scalar
variables but continuous functions. Given a dataset of function-valued traits
generated by evolution, we develop a practical statistical approach to infer
ancestral function-valued traits, and estimate the generative evolutionary
process. We do this by combining dimension reduction and phylogenetic Gaussian
process regression, a nonparametric procedure which explicitly accounts for
known phylogenetic relationships. We test the methods' performance on simulated
function-valued data generated from a stochastic evolutionary model. The
methods are applied assuming that only the phylogeny and the function-valued
traits of taxa at its tips are known. Our method is robust and applicable to a
wide range of function-valued data, and also offers a phylogenetically aware
method for estimating the autocorrelation of function-valued traits.
