  Several studies suggest that one possible cause of impaired wound healing is
failed or insufficient lymphangiogenesis, that is the formation of new
lymphatic capillaries. Although many mathematical models have been developed to
describe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis) very few have been
proposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Moreover,
lymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at
different times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary
differential equations is presented to describe the formation of lymphatic
capillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell
densities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters
are estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved
numerically and the results are compared with the available biological
literature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as
a starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the
enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors
involved. In particular, the balance between TGF-$\beta$ and VEGF levels,
rather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective
lymphangiogenesis. In addition, the results indicate lowering the
macrophage-mediated activation of TGF-$\beta$ and increasing the basal
lymphatic endothelial cell growth rate, \emph{inter alia}, as potential
treatments. It is hoped the findings of this paper may be considered in the
development of future experiments investigating novel lymphangiogenic
therapies.
