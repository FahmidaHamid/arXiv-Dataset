  Binding of a ligand on a protein changes the flexibility of certain parts of
the protein, which directly affects its function. These changes are not the
same at each point, some parts become more flexible and some others become
stiffer. Here, an equation is derived that gives the stiffness map for
proteins. The model is based on correlations of fluctuations of pairs of points
that need to be evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. The model is also
cast in terms of the Gaussian Network Model and changes of stiffness upon
dimerization of AKT1 are evaluated as an example.
