  Unveiling the mechanisms through which the somitogenesis regulatory network
exerts spatiotemporal control of the somitic patterning has required a
combination of experimental and mathematical modeling strategies. Significant
progress has been made for the zebrafish clockwork. However, due to its
complexity, the clockwork of the amniote segmentation regulatory network has
not been fully elucidated. Here, we address the question of how oscillations
are arrested in the amniote segmentation clock. We do this by constructing a
minimal model of the regulatory network, which privileges architectural
information over molecular details. With a suitable choice of parameters, our
model is able to reproduce the oscillatory behavior of the Wnt, Notch and FGF
signaling pathways in presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells. By introducing
positional information via a single Wnt3a gradient, we show that oscillations
are arrested following an infinite-period bifurcation. Notably: the
oscillations increase their amplitude as cells approach the anterior PSM and
remain in an upregulated state when arrested; the transition from the
oscillatory regime to the upregulated state exhibits hysteresis; and an
opposing distribution of the Fgf8 and RA gradients in the PSM arises naturally
in our simulations. We hypothesize that the interaction between a limit cycle
(originated by the Notch delayed-negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch
(originated by the Wnt-Notch positive cross-regulation) is responsible for the
observed segmentation patterning. Our results agree with previously unexplained
experimental observations and suggest a simple plausible mechanism for
spatiotemporal control of somitogenesis in amniotes.
