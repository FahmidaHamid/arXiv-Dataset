  Mathematical models, with some simplifying assumptions, can provide clarity
into the workings of complex biological systems. Despite their seeming
simplicity, even so-called 'minimal' models can exhibit a diverse range of
behavior in various regions of the parameter space. These models can be studied
using simulations and analytical methods. Simulations are often parameter
dependent and fall short of providing a complete understanding of the full
range of system responses. Analytical approaches on the other hand provide a
framework to study the entire phase space. Here, we outline a largely
analytical method for studying reaction-diffusion models. Using a prototypic
model of cell polarization, we characterize protein activation in response to
an external stimulus and highlight the importance of phase-space analysis. We
demonstrate how comprehensive treatment of the phase space can guide
experimental design and supplement simulation studies. In order to make such
analyses more accessible, we provide an easy-to-use graphical user interface
