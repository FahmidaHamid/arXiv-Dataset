  The reversible Frank model is capable of amplifying the initial small
statistical deviations from the idealized racemic composition. This temporary
amplification can be interpreted as a chiral excursion in a dynamic phase
space. It is well known that if the system is open to matter and energy
exchange, a permanently chiral state can be reached asymptotically, while the
final state is necessarily racemic if the system is closed. In this work, we
combine phase space analysis, stability analysis and numerical simulations to
study the initial chiral excursions and determine how they depend on whether
the system is open, semi-open or closed.
