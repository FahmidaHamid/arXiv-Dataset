  The two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases belong to an emerging class
of enzymes involved in oxidation reactions in a number of metabolic and
biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. One component is a NAD(P)H:flavin
oxidoreductase, which provides a reduced flavin to the second component, the
proper monooxygenase. There, the reduced flavin activates molecular oxygen for
substrate oxidation. Here, we study the flavin reductase ActVB and ActVA-ORF5
gene product, both reported to be involved in the last step of biosynthesis of
the natural antibiotic actinorhodin in Streptomyces coelicolor. For the first
time we show that ActVA-ORF5 is a FMN-dependent monooxygenase that together
with the help of the flavin reductase ActVB catalyzes the oxidation reaction.
The mechanism of the transfer of reduced FMN between ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 has
been investigated. Dissociation constant values for oxidized and reduced flavin
(FMNox and FMNred) with regard to ActVB and ActVA-ORF5 have been determined.
The data clearly demonstrate a thermodynamic transfer of FMNred from ActVB to
ActVA-ORF5 without involving a particular interaction between the two protein
components. In full agreement with these data, we propose a reaction mechanism
in which FMNox binds to ActVB, where it is reduced, and the resulting FMNred
moves to ActVA-ORF5, where it reacts with O2 to generate a flavinperoxide
intermediate. A direct spectroscopic evidence for the formation of such species
within ActVA-ORF5 is reported.
