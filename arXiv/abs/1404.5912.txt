  When there is conspicuous under-exploitation of a limited resource, it is
worth asking what mechanisms allow presumably valuable resources to be left
unused? Evolutionary biologists have generated a wide range of hypotheses to
explain this, ranging from interdemic group selection to selfishly prudent
individual restraint. We consider a situation in which, in spite of high
intraspecific competition, individuals leave most of a key resource
unexploited. The parasitic wasp that does this finds virtually all host egg
clusters in a landscape, but parasitizes only about a third of the eggs in
each, and then leaves a deterrent mark around the cluster. We first test, and
reject, a series of system-specific simple constraints that might limit full
host exploitation, such as asynchronous maturation of host eggs. We then
consider classical hypotheses for the evolution of restraint. Prudent predation
and bet-hedging fail as explanations because the wasp lives as a large
well-mixed population. Also, we find no individual benefits to the parasitoid
of developing in a sparsely parasitized host nest. However an optimal foraging
model, including empirically measured costs of superparasitism and
hyperparasitism, can explain through individual selection, both the
consistently low rate of parasitism and marking.
