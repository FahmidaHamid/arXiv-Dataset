  A model to describe the mechanism of conformational dynamics in protein based
on matter interactions using lagrangian approach and imposing certain symmetry
breaking is proposed. Both conformation changes of proteins and the injected
non-linear sources are represented by the bosonic lagrangian with an additional
\phi^4 interaction for the sources. In the model the spring tension of protein
representing the internal hydrogen bonds is realized as the interactions
between individual amino acids and nonlinear sources. The folding pathway is
determined by the strength of nonlinear sources that propagate through the
protein backbone. It is also shown that the model reproduces the results in
some previous works.
