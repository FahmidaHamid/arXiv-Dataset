  Mitochondrial research is important to ageing, apoptosis, and mitochondrial
diseases. In previous works, mitochondria are usually stimulated indirectly by
proapoptotic drugs to study mitochondrial development, which is in lack of
controllability, or spatial and temporal resolution. These chemicals or even
gene techniques regulating mitochondrial dynamics may also activate other
inter- or intra-cellular processes simultaneously. Here we demonstrate a
photostimulation method on single-mitochondrion level by tightly-focused
femtosecond laser that can precisely activate restorable fragmentation of
mitochondria which soon recover their original tubular structure after tens of
seconds. In this process, series of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
(mROS) flashes are observed and found very critical to mitochondrial
fragmentation. Meanwhile, transient openings of mitochondrial permeability
transition pores (mPTP), suggested by oscillations of mitochondrial membrane
potential, contribute to the scavenging of redundant mROS and recovery of
fragmented mitochondria. Those results demonstrate photostimulation as an
active, precise and controllable method for the study of mitochondrial
oxidative and morphological dynamics or related fields.
