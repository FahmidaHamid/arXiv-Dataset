  Computational convenience has led to widespread use of Bayesian inference
with vague or flat priors to analyze state-space models in ecology. Vague
priors are claimed to be objective and to let the data speak. Neither of these
claims is valid. Statisticians have criticized the use of vague priors from
philosophical to computational to pragmatic reasons. Ecologists, however,
dismiss such criticisms as empty philosophical wonderings with no practical
implications. We illustrate that use of vague priors in population viability
analysis and occupancy models can have significant impact on the analysis and
can lead to strikingly different managerial decisions. Given the wide spread
applicability of the hierarchical models and uncritical use of non-informative
Bayesian analysis in ecology, researchers should be cautious about using the
vague priors as a default choice in practical situations.
