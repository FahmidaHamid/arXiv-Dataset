  We report that M\"uller cells contain bundles of long specialized
intermediate filaments about 10 nm in diameter; most likely, these filaments
are the channels providing light transmission to photoreceptor cells in
mammalian and avian retinas. We interpret transmission of light in such
channels using the notions of quantum confinement, describing energy transport
in structures with electro-conductive walls and diameter much smaller than the
wavelength of the respective photons. Model calculations produce photon
transmission efficiency in such channels exceeding 0.8, in optimized geometry.
We infer that protein molecules make up the channels, proposing a qualitative
mechanism of light transmission by such structures.
