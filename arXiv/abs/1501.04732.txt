  Strabismus can be found in association with congenital heart diseases, for
examples, in velocardiofacial (DiGeorge) syndrome, Down syndrome, mild
dysmorphic features, in CHARGE association, Turner syndrome, Ullrich-Turner
syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome.1-4 Some types of strabismus is
heritable (e.g. infantile esotropia syndrome), particularly the ones associated
with multisystem disorders, e.g. Moebius syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome,
craniofacial dysostoses, and mitochondrial myopathies.5 Due to the complexities
that a case of strabismus may pertain to, it is worthwhile to get to know more
about the strabismic syndromes and syndromic strabismus. This brief review -as
its name implied- does not attempt to cover every angle of the syndromic
conditions, but offers a refreshment on our knowledge about more prevalent
strabismus-related syndromes.
