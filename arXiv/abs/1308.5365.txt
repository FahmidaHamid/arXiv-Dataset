  Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern in the United
States and globally. While influenza vaccines are the single most effective
intervention to reduce influenza morbidity and mortality, there is considerable
debate surrounding the merits and consequences of repeated seasonal
vaccination. Here, we describe a two-season influenza epidemic contact network
model and use it to demonstrate that increasing the level of continuity in
vaccination across seasons reduces the burden on public health. We show that
revaccination reduces the influenza attack rate not only because it reduces the
overall number of susceptible individuals, but also because it better protects
highly-connected individuals, who would otherwise make a disproportionately
large contribution to influenza transmission. Our work thus contributes a
population-level perspective to debates about the merits of repeated influenza
vaccination and advocates for public health policy to incorporate individual
vaccine histories.
