  Rhythms in electrical activity in the membrane of cells in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are crucial for the function of the circadian
timing system, which is characterized by the expression of the so-called clock
genes. Intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ ions seem to connect, at least in part, the
electrical activity of SCN neurons with the expression of clock genes. In this
paper, we introduce a simple mathematical model describing the linking of
membrane activity to the transcription of one gene by means of a feedback
mechanism based on the dynamics of intracellular calcium ions.
