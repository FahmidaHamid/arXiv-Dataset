  Heterogeneity within tumour cell populations is associated with an increase
in malignancy and appears to play an important role during cancer metastasis.
Using in silico experiments, we study the interplay between collective
behaviours and cell motility heterogeneities in a model system. Working with
tumour spheroids that contain two non-proliferating cell populations of
different motile properties, we explore the conditions required for maximal
invasion into surrounding tissues. We show emerging spatial patterns of
cellular organisation and invasion which are consistent with in vitro and in
vivo observations. This demonstrates that mechanical interactions at the
cellular level are sufficient to account for many of the observed morphologies
of invasion and that heterogeneity in cell motility can be more important than
average mechanical properties in controlling the fate of large cell
populations.
